Could be because I'm 80ish

---
---
Gz! Still working my way up there.
---
Eso gets its fanbase tbh. They release amazing stories with new and returning fan fav characters and lore the lorenerds get to really go over while also pleasing the normal mmo peoples needs usually. Pvp people tend to never be happy in anygame really lol.
---
I wish they implemented ESO’s system where all enemies levels are normalized to the individual players so a high level player can enter low level zones and still fight enemies their level while the lower level player with them fights enemies at their level
---
I agree to some extent, but a lot of players prefer not using power armor until they need to. I love the look of my character's armor, and I really get tired of the sounds PA makes when walking. Plus, if it's in your inventory, you get to save your cores. You really don't realize just how quickly they go once you get a jetpack...
---
Probably not. I havent been camped for caps the one time I was attacked on my low level I had no caps
---
Personally I would like to see when you respawn at a station it placed you at a random location near the station so someone can't spawn camp.
---
Thank you
---
Was not expecting a reply on a comment from two weeks ago. Fair play.
---
My friends and I built next to Pleasant Valley/Whitespring/Watoga station for a few thousand hours playtime combined. Everyone who fast travel to train station see our camps. Our decontamination shower never get destroyed. The only thing got killed by other players are tamed creatures and I guess that is understandable since some players kill whenever they see a deathclaw/megasloth. We are on PC.
---
Welcome to the club
---
Same here.  PSN "Cryocide"
---

---
I sent you a friend request
---
Calm down. If a game is exploitable, it will 100% be exploited. Are the exploiters lame for intentionally exploiting? Totally. Games are supposed to be fair and balanced, so trying to exploit goes against the spirit of things. But that actual problem is that the game is poorly designed. And getting mad at the exploiters is a complete waste of time and effort. 
---
&gt; You’re probably one of those idiots waiting for someone to spawn. Quit trying to be witty you look and sound like a bitch nigga
---
And you seem like a super butthurt babyman. But let’s not call names here.
---
Yeah I agree. Funny thing they try trade with you after they behaved like a douche which is hilarious and again I don't give them the satisfaction ..
---
Quad explosive double barrel.
---
EVER NOTICE HOW they never respond to this issue?
---
The only time someone did that to me, it was a team of 2 who interfered with my spawn at west tech. 
---
The current strategy is for a team to lay in wait at an area where high levels and legendaries can spawn. Manipulate a PvP situation and then try to steal the spawns. 
---
I always check the map as I approach an area. They were hidden upon my arrival, then one jumped into my line of fire (the mob spawn points are well known) and I unknowingly struck them. Then the other killed me from hidden range, collecting caps.
---
I did not seek revenge but instead respawned back at west tec and followed them throughout the rest of their time there, my weapons stowed, jumping in front of them, harassing them and making their time unenjoyable. I ignored their attacks.
---
I usually do not use a mic but in the future will annoy these fucks even more and pester them.
---
That's really cool almost as cool as your journal I will always remember the first time I saw it.
---
Lol, this may actually get their attention.
---
Vats crits are your friend
---
beauty

PC?
---
On low level, in order to quickly level up, I’m using the workshops. I just go claim 5 of them and waiting for the Reclaim your workshop (not the defend it) it’s way faster. Yes you are open to PvP, so sometimes you can get shot by other player, but if you don’t build anything in the workshop, usually nobody is coming to claim them. Also sleep in bed gives you +5% xp, and at Arnold Homstead you got cranberries that can give you +5% xp or as Cranberry relish is +10% xp for an hour.
---
There's no objective information, though. Whether you'll enjoy the game or not is an entirely subjective thing. When it comes to your concern about performance issues, I'd say simple logic suggests that all those crashes and stability problems would've been long since fixed by now, otherwise the game would be dead... which it's clearly not. 
---
Just log on and play if you're interested in coming back, *we* can't tell you whether you'll enjoy it or not, especially when you're asking a subreddit full of people who've been playing consistently since launch. There's already a clear difference in opinion there, so we really can't give an unbiased perspective, nor one that would align exactly with your expectations.
---
Most often than not, the reason i get wanted is from leveling a turret camp behind the golf club. Sometimes it's a bait where the coward waits until you level their camp and get wanted then tries to collect the bounty from a distance.
---
I'm with you, despise seeing them in game.
---
Alternatively, no judgement here you could play with home grown organic weapons. I’ve got a level 60 rifle character that’s never used a legendary weapon and played through all quests.  A sneak headshot from a gauss one shots level 68 Scorched, SM, etc. it takes more shots and reloads but so what?
---
You want to be on of those TSE shotgun pukes that go spraying the loot and corpses everywhich way at WS?
---
Wanda Pierce (please pass along to your wife that her sense of style is awesome)
---
Seriously though, I thank atom for my vampire's minigun everytime I do that event. Without it I'd be out of stimpaks in no time.
---
EVER NOTICE HOW they don't respond to even 1% of posts at all? This is literally as close as I'll ever get to them actually seeing something I post and hopefully they add my comment to the thousands of suggestions that they get every day. Idgaf
---
It’s not a bug.
---
Bloodied builds do so much damage that she dies before you can do enough damage to qualify for rewards.
---
Exactly my point I would require to trade in two accounts full of “god tier” for a bloodied explosive lazer rifle fully upgraded and the whole kebab
---
I think they mean they activate all the pylons by themself then stay away from enemies and just keep healing while everyone else takes care of the sheepsquatch.
---
The problem is bloodied builds.
---
If only they'd fix Chainsaws...
---
Was checking to see if I had an extra... sorry no luck..
---
I was too slow when I was gathering the 100 raw violet flux for the calibrated shocks for my excavator armor. I think some of it spoiled before I got to a chem bench so I only ended up with 9 stable. First thing I'll be looking for is that last stable flux so both legs are done. Of course that's the same time I'll be able to get scrip for all the legendary crap I've been lugging around and no longer be stuck using it all the time any way.
---
&gt; Lol, you sound personally offended. 
---
Can you explain how you came to this conclusion? Because it sounds like you just pulled it out of your ass in an attempt to save face. But I’ll hear you out.
---
&gt; Take it easy big guy. 
---
I think you’re confused. I’m telling you to take it easy. So obviously you don’t need to tell me to take it easy. That doesn’t make any sense. Again, just feels like you’re pulling this crap out of your ass. 
---
&gt; Over 99% of TSEs in the game are dupes. 
---
Ah good, you’ve finally said something relevant. Unfortunately, you can’t prove this statement either. You have no fucking clue what percent of TSEs are legit. Literally no fucking clue, except that they’re rare. 
---
&gt; That's what i meant
---
Unfortunately what you meant is equally as stupid for the exact same reasons.
---
Ah yes now I see. That is random as fuck. He have been playing a lot of nuka tapper lol
---
Go to Harper's Ferry and sell all the dropped weapons daily.
---
I usually let the train station be a peace zone if possible, wave to the guy and rush to my stash. In all fairness though he should’ve waited to store his stuff first then buy, he’ll learn lol
---
As a heavy gunner and having a CAMP on an acid vent, I make tons of bullets for my mg42 &amp; Gatling. I have nearly 50,000 5mm and 45,000 .308 ammo stocked up. Took me several weeks. I can craft 100,000 of 5mm within 30 days without much issue if I wanted. I hope BSG isn't simply banning for crafting over 100,000 regular bullets. I thought ultracite ammo was what BSG was looking for. There is no way a person can make that much ultracite ammo in a month. Maybe when nukes were popping of every 30 seconds back before the purge, but now with nuke events much rarer, it would be near impossible.
---
South of Lake Eloise, right near to and even at the Southern edge of the map. There are lakes, there are NO scorch beast attacks if you're far enough from the fissure, and there's plenty of flat ground to build upon
---
I'm a month late to this. had to google to make sure i wasn't missing something.  I waited a while to come back to the game to see if it got better. It got worse? like a lot? with one really bad decision? it makes the game unplayable nearly, i just want to roam and shoot shit and be able to build and repair armor and weapons.
---
yes but i want to fight a tree. nothing happens. just a standoff between the dweller and a literal tree. that is my final boss.
---
I'm gonna destroy everyone until Tuesday, then I'll just server hop like a decent person.
---
Same
---
That's why I said interior. As in the white side of the walls.
---
I’ll sell one for 1.5k
---
I’ve got a level 40, 2 star executioners Ripper with 40% faster swing speed and +50% more damage when target is below 40% health 
---
I’ve got to work out how to mod it and what perk cards to use because I assume it will be an absolute monster with that right build 
---
What is the build to get that?
---
Tesla is an odd weapon...  it may behave a bit differently.  Have you tried it to see how it behaves on single and multiple enemies?
---
Ah ok, thanks for checking anyway
---
I'm not reading all that. Take care dude
---
Has anyone actually completed this? I’ve tried everything, even a new character. 
---
I feel like they may have left it open ended for future DLC?
---
Sure. But to be fair, that was because this was easier to monitize. And they knew it would turn people off, which was why they stressed so hard that you could play it solo. And you still can. They just didn't mention that they were going to push you towards the other end of the spectrum, presumably because they knew the reaction they would have gotten.
---
How about eating corpses to simulate the Gormonds? Just a thought...
---
No fun allowed per Todd
---
Hell, here's my $10, I'll take one prefabricated No. 8 house please.
---
Not only do prime receivers do extra damage to scorched , a prime receiver does more damage than a hardened receiver to everything else. 
---
My handmade was doing 90 damage w/ hardened . With a prime reciter and ultracite ammo it does 131
---
Try the vendor in Watoga, it usually sells most furniture plans.
---
This would be nice -- just like they do for plants. It's also better for looting with teammates.
---
Unless you're not playing a sneak vats build, or any pvp optimized build for that matter.
---
If you server hop overseers camp one of the random events is a tent with trapper plans. Plus you might get civil war reenactor
---
The park just south of lewisberg has a tent that often spawns trappet plans
---
The watoga north of nar railyard random event also can spawn tent
---
It annoys the hell outta me being stuck with 18 holotapes.
---
It's performance has increased for me for sure. Nukes don't seem to effect the server as much, I'm getting a higher frame rate in areas where it'd plummet. There is definitely still a persistent but ignorable delay/lag/stutter issue. Went from the standard CTD to it being rare (twice yesterday but first time in at least a week, maybe longer, don't tend to pay too much attention to it). 
---
Hope this helps, I'll answer what I can (seem to be getting flak I don't get why)
---
&gt; How would they tell the difference between your dupped ammo and my crafted ammo? 
---
Easy, the crafting materials required to make the ammo decrease as the amount of ammo increases.  If you magically become in possession of more ammo than you should ever be able to craft and no one on your server shows a decrease in their amount of ammo your account gets flagged for investigation.
---
“All that”, what, the half a paragraph that I wrote? Sounds like you just know when to accept that you’re wrong.
---
Take care dude.
---
It’s super convenient. I have it right next to a bed and guitar. Every time I leave my camp I’m well rested, well tuned, and free of rads.....
---
Hahaha
---
Seriously though, why do people kill the vendor bot?
---
I did multiple server hops and checked him out because of this and still nothing
---
Would be really cool. Hopefully they add this with the camp decor update.
---
I guess I don't understand your monetization point. It was easier to monetize an online Fallout? 
---
Compared to the sales of a traditional Fallout? 
---
And you should have known they were going to push for multiplayer...... From the very first trailer..... It made it pretty obvious.
---
Your arm is completely in from the elbow down
---
Or you can keep asking people you meet at events to go snap a photo and have them blow you off. Your experience may vary. Which is the problem.
---
Unless it changed in the last couple patches, Responders vendors should sell them. They may not always be in stock.
---
It's possible that two-shot only adjusts the ballistic damage, which the Tesla doesn't have. Maybe shoot some Watoga robots to check whether it's just a display bug. You'd still get two projectiles and the accuracy decrease.
---
I'll keep an eye out for you
---
My sample is nowhere near 100 but it’s not far from 20. I’m not sure how the 6% paint drop rate interacts with the 31% outfit drop rate (ie can you get both or is it just one or the other?) but my sample size is large enough that it’s odd that I’ve gotten nothing. 
---
Even a sample size of 10 would imply a 97.6% chance of at least one outfit. (1 - (1-0.31)^10).
---
It’s not absolutely conclusive, I admit, but it’s unlikely and frustrating.
---
I’ll keep trying, the XP isn’t terrible and it’s close to my camp so the travel cost is manageable.
---
Great write up by the OP, BTW, super helpful.
---
you just missed our first WVPCo team up about an hour ago. Gorione, Steam, and I fixed up thunder mountain, we claimed the work bench there and set up the fusion core generator (I got about 6 total out of it ) the other two power plants were running already. I was low on oil and we took Beckley mine exhibit and ran the extractors there for a bit ( you can set 3 extractors there) we also did Uranium fever and heart of the swamp. then I logged for work leaving him the claimed workbenches. I have you added to my add list and i will send it tommorrow my ign is garlandtd.
---
Well in the text at the bottom of loading screen I remember it saying their dna mixed with mole rats.
---
Lol
---
Is ThIs HoW you GeT iNtO tHe DeV rOoM?
---
That fight is already an event that rewards loot as soon at the queen dies. The event is called "Scorched Earth" and it shows on the map once prime is nuked. The event quest starts if you just come into proximity of the event zone highlighted on the map. It doesn't matter who nuked the zone, everyone gets the event quest if they come into that zone.
---
This quest rewards a variety of things like stable fluxes and those random ultracite armor plans, etc. The first time you do it, you get Decon shower, its random other times. The body also has additional loot, but only if you do a certain amount of damage as far as I am aware. I don't think tagging it once will work.
---
So, its already an event, but the event loot doesn't require damage while the body loot does.
---
This video shows this:
---
Event: Scorched Earth quest Started just by walking into zone (at 3:13 in the video):

Punjabi boards? 😂
---
I had one do this to me in the Point Pleasant church. Couldnt find him at all. Until he ran up the underside of the stairs towards the safe and I saw the soles of his feet coming through the stairs... Had to melee him when he went to melee me as it was the only time he showed through the floorboards.
---
That went really well today it was cool running with you man hope to do more of it. also to supplement your mothman egg sell you can also go to a farm on the west side of the map called billings homestead. theres corn and just down the road razor grains. if you have green thumb and pick up all those crops thats 400 or 500 worth in caps to sell.
---
Ok seeing as yall must not read before you start moving your little fingers to say something... TIRED OF IT BEING ON EVERYDAY!!!!
---
Nah its just hella funny
---
Bethesda please give us interior walls.  Whats up with the framing. Probably easy as hell to drop flat drab water stained walls over the skeleton they give us.
---
How did you add the garage door to the wall?
---
that sucks :( it would also explain why i couldnt ad you :P
---
Omg...... i wasted soooo much time...
---
I was expecting something really simple like turn in 2 legendries and get 1 new one of the same star level back. Maybe at the most there would be some slim chance you'd get another star on the new one.
---
Yeah, it certainly was easier. Micro transactions. They didnt know sales were going to tank. And of course, everyone was worried they were going to push it, and they rushed to calm everyone down about it. If it looks like someone's going to do a crappy thing and they swear they're not, then then donut anyway, they don't get a pass for doing it just because you expected it.
---
I made a point of server hopping for it for around an hour a day between levels 35 and 80. Then I got bored and bought one on bazaar for around 2k lol. Honestly it’s quite a bit but personally I think it was worth every cap. 
---
I always carry an additional torso with the stealth boy mod so I can switch between them without exiting the suit, which is handy in nuke zones lol.
---
Yes. For example, the current meta is what Steelsight is unhappy with. Nerfing one meta creates another, with the exact same problems as the current one (demand goes up, supply cannot go up, prices skyrocket outside the occasional lucky find).
---
Thank you!!!  I wasted soooo much time doing this....
---
The way its worded just made it seem like i had to replace my camp
---
Its even better if you have the team medic perk. You become a walking heal bot for anyone on your team.
---
Because people are too lazy to try ot for themselves. The want the opinion of others instead of forming their own
---
You're getting downvotes cause you're an asshole. Also you decided to make a joke about raping my family just because I said camps like these don't affect you or your game play. You're the second most toxic person I have ever witnessed on this reddit. THAT is why you're getting downvoted.
---
I consistently have 40-60 glowing and hardened masses but zero HRF. They used to be the most common.
---
:(
---
I like the sound of that
---
Exactly! Bring back the barrels, the crates, the boxes of documents types of stuff from Fallout 4! All of the assets are surely still here, just make them available again.
---
I absolutely adored being able to fill my settlements with ambient junk like that; it makes them look lived-in in that immersive make-do way.
---
Yep, I *just* started playing and claimed a workshop on a quest. I didn’t care about it and kinda hoped I’d lose it when I didn’t respond to the follow up “protection” quests. Nek minnit some level 80 dude is shooting up my camp. I just quit immediately to save my camp. It’s been an interesting first couple of days in fo76...
---
ok I tried to invite you today and failed just now see I spelled your name wrong. I will try again tomorrow.
---
Really not, in the situation I was coming out of a nuked Whitesprings. I didn't really have much time to store my stuff and exit the armor. And again, that's avoiding the problem rather than fixing it.
---
^^^
---
If you are still looking for one tomorrow, I’ll have it to sell.
---
You have to be joking. In Fallout 2 you could make poop rain from the sky from a quest, and you could have a super mutant molest you and put a ball gag in your inventory if you lost at arm wrestling. It's always been immature.
---
I think it’s a sign of the game’s health. A good sign.
---
What platform? If it’s Xbox and there’s an extra one going after you sell this one, I’m after another for my hybrid p/a set.  Will gladly pay 1.5k when I’m on tomorrow.
---
Also too lazy to use the search function.
---
Headcannon: They're relatively normal people and relatively sane, but due to their damage suits and radiation exposure, they can barely see and think every normal person they come across is a raider. The Purveyor is basically proving them wrong.
---
I miss the move where they picked you up and slammed you into the ground..
---
Level 115. The closest I've gotten is a TS auto 10MM pistol. 
---
Hell I just got my first 3* piece of armor last weekend.
---
I sent you an invite today o7 today went well I think this is gonna be neat.

It's bad for the economy. Vendors sell that stuff. People buy it. People sell that stuff.
---
Doesn't work against stealth boy, or someone wearing one piece of chameleon.
---
Starting a new character oh for heavens sakes no. Resetting lvl back to like 55 or 60 yes
---
In game, one terminal describes what they are going through, and it's similar to ghoulification, so they're basically radiated but not dead. It talks about their gloves melting and their suits getting stuck on their skins... wouldn't be shocked if the suits themselves were highly toxic, resulting in a different sort of ghoul.
---
Yuuup. Ran a second character just to clean up trophies too.
---
Xbox, I’m online now gt: xxXNEGANXxx 
---
I’ll be online for 10 mins
---
I often do just that I take the shop leave the doors open get the food processor running and put some water purifiers in the front.
---
I wouldn't exactly say it tanked. 
---
And I'm sure they knew it was going to be a risk. However I doubt they made Fallout 76 because it was easier to monetize. Based on the risk it would have just been a safer bet to pump out a new SP fallout game, and could have used a similar monetization model 
---
Also, it didn't "look like someone was going to do something crappy and then swear they're not"
---
They said Fallout 76 will be a multiplayer Fallout game from the moment it was announced......And then it was.
---
Noo it wouldn't start your adventure/survival character over. It'd be an entirely new game-mode called Seasons maybe. That's how Diablo's seasons work and you'd get cosmetic wings or gear for your normal character from the seasons.
---
I got a partially complete set of nukacola t51
---
I guess the only thing I could say is to try the Whitesprings vendors.  Either the faction vendors there or the resort furniture vendor might sell it.  Sadly, I don't remember where I got mine from (but I certainly got it from a vendor somewhere).
---
Nimble fingers I’d legit love.
---
Also throwing mini nukes is funny.
---
tried to send you an invite today and failed as well but that was spelling it wrong on my end..saskaphone is what I wrote down ...
---
New player here, got my camp shot up by some level 80 dude I guess because I claimed a workshop I was walking by. He didn’t attack me, just methodically circled my camp wrecking shit. If I knew claiming would force me into pvp I wouldn’t have done it, and don’t plan to again. That was my first bad experience, hope it’s not a common occurrence.
---
That wanted one is hilarious
---
Contesting/claiming an owned workshop in either mode.
---
It's still PvP based, but not done in survival and most of the time if you try to take someones shop they won't fight back.
---
Hooters.
---
[removed]
---
Have you done the munitions factory gives the most instrument plans from my experience
---
Making a new character ever couple months?? **No thanks**
---
Why would I want to do that? Plans and recipes don’t roll over and I play on a character I’ve had since launch. No way in hell im starting over and losing Christmas paint for t-51b
---
These would be fun
---
Sorry I can’t get on until tomorrow, I’ll message you to see if you still have it if that’s cool?, as I 100% want it. My GT is my name here.
---
It's not competitive though. If I wanted that type of game I'd play Rainbow Six or CS. Fallout is, at it's core, a PvE game with a optional PvP mode. But the "optional" is either let people roll over you or try to fight and instantly die. There's no skill involved with looking up a broken PvP build. I laser these guys with my guns, hitting every shot on them but it doesn't matter. No damage is done and I lose caps for trying to defend myself, sounds fun to me.
---
Does your character look like Sandra Bullock?
---
Sad to say it seems to be getting more frequent
---
There are 2 visible "arcs" just shooting it into the air. I'll do some damage tests later when I go back in game.
---
 I just tried equipping and comparing a few different guns to test.
---
Standard vs 2 shot:  
---
Tesla both say 126
---
LMG 63 vs 78 = 20%
---
Gatling gun 129 vs 160 = 20%
---
Gatling plasma 87 vs 91 = 5%
---
So  something is certainly bugged here. The LMG, and gatling gun both show a  20% bump, the gatling plasma only 5% but still shows a bump and the  tesla shows nothing at all.
---
@Ladydevann, @Valseek, Can we please get 2 shot weapons looked at so they all properly show the damage increase &amp;/or if they are getting the correct/any increase.
---
Activating the 3 pylons is required to be able to do damage to the sheepsquatch, but doing so will drain your health while activated. So doing all 3 yourself allows others to damage the sheepsquatch while you hang back and heal using still or cola to counteract the health draining.
---
Power Play sounds beyond amazing
---
It would all be optional, have you ever played Diablo 3? The character from the seasonal would be deleted after the season is over. It's so you would be able to obtain items for your character you've had since launch.
---
Sure, that’s fine, around 8-9pm EST
---
It's also easy points for your internet fame. But no, they will continue forever.
---
😂
---
does that mean you want a friend invite for powerplant restoration missions as well ? or are you erecting a sentry because your brotherhood and thats what brotherhood does.

Yes. **And those are items I’m talking about plans and recipes.** What about all the plans and recipes that don’t roll over?
---
Exactly.
---
i love it, but it makes me a bit paranoid, i find myself always looking behind me, like something is coming after me, lol
---
i got a 3\* instigating buzz blade.
---
Run with Unyielding/ adrenaline runs through things like a beast
---
Mechanic sounds awesome
---
You wouldn't need them in seasonal mode? Because that character would be deleted after the season.
---
Consider it completed!

Can you join now?

Theres a keyhole bit mod, I think it adds armor penetration? That's the only one though
---
Could you recommend any?
---
I have played every entry—including the progenitor, Wasteland.   This game is lore-breaking but is otherwise definitively Fallout.   I would rank it higher than Fallout 2–and vastly higher than Tactics or BOS.
---
Appreciate that :)
---
My main weapon is a vampire explosive gatling gun, so I can go danger close due to the heals. In my friend group, I always am on crowd control because they use TSE weapons. I contribute as much as I can, but my primary focus is always to take out anything on the ground. I do the same at scorched earth. Plus, since I heal myself with every shot, I can use my stims to revive others and give team heals.
---
I mean its not naked skydiving fun but gorione, steam, and myself had good time today and by the time I logged off the server was better off for our activities. I will send you an invite when I get home tomorrow..in the game... not for naked skydiving... just in case there was any confusion.
---
Except if you well equiped in ammo you don't want to meet one...   You can find them in almost all random event spawn in Cranberry Bog, if you are over lvl80 you will get a lvl80 * or more * it's random. But really be prepared they are the biggest bullet sponge in game so far. For exemple with my AA .50 cal MG i take down in less than 150 bullet any SB, Deathclaw, Mirelurk Queen.  A sheepsquatch lvl80 take between 750 bullet to 1000 bullet.
---
Ease of use. No menu hopping while the deathclow tries to murder your ass.
---
Zoom, which makes it easier to catch good shots of things that would murder your ass under other circumstances, like said deathclaw.

I’m out of the loop, they’re getting rid of camp damage? I don’t know how I feel above it that - I don’t like getting griefed, but I’d like to be able to set up some turrets and defend against *something*. I guess players can still pvp me and trigger defenses even though they can’t destroy the camp...
---
And put 3 caps and a screwdriver in random drawers.
---
In like 15 mins
---
While we are at it, let us plant more plants (i mean like those you find only in the wild).
---
So you hear it too?!? Guess I’m not crazy after all.
---
I check the atom challenges, swear to myself over the 3 or 4 that there's no way I'll do then go do the 1 or 2 reasonable ones. Check the map for my nearest mission to work on and do that. Mix in the occasional event or really any random distraction that pops up close enough for me to bother with.
---
I had this same problem a while back. I wound up just spending some time away from it and when I came back to try again I didn't have ANY equipment on me, just stashed it all. I highly doubt that entering naked helped though. Pretty sure just spending a bit of time away from it and then letting it reload itself did the trick.
---
Sounds good.
---
For 5 dollars maybe...
---
Nah I’m good. If they wanted to do something similar to Diablo’s seasonal then they should just add a bunch of odd and actually difficult challenges to complete within a certain time frame (1-2months or so) and said challenges wouldn’t be restricted to survival or regular modes.
---
Like “kill 30 players in one day” or “defend a workshop 20 times” “steal a workshop 20 times” “kill 100 SBQs” “launch 3 nukes within an hour”
---
Stuff like that would be fun
---
I mean, I got the atom points to cover that. So I'm all good.
---
Cool, that 2am here, will definitely be on then lol, this is the first day I’ve not played in months ironically. Still on here getting my fallout fix.
---
I’m still fairly new to the game so can I ask why you removed your rad shower?  Can they actually take it from your camp or destroy it?
---
The only ones I ever do are: Uranium Fever, AWOL Armaments, Free Range, Encryptid, and any nukes really.
---
No it was in the trailer at E3 or whatever
---
Negative bounty.
---
The player has to earn caps back to be able to buy anything or fast travel outside of CAMP.
---
np glws bro!
---
Don't we all
---
Some way to transfer things between characters. Don't care if its an account bank, stash, a mail option, or something else.
---
This is a great idea!
---
I mean, there doesn't necessarily need to be a spot held. I'd argue there's no need at all. The client could simply store the contact info for the last world, and try to reconnect to that world. If that world has since filled, the disconnected player could be added to the queue for that world, the way players are queued for full worlds right now (ie. in the case where you try to join a friend whose world is full). That's a trivial solution, and costs nothing.
---
**BETHESDA WHY CANT I HAVE A COMPANION LIKE IN ESO??? TAKE MY 55$**
---
Just saw this doing the wolf quest line.
---
Shame I didn't have a friend to play with. 😣
---
Great pic.
---
It's a drop from the SBQ
---
They’ve implemented quite a few ideas from feedback on here. I think the player vending may have been mentioned by Bethesda pre launch, but I’m not 100% on that. Either way, bravo Bethesda on 76, played since launch and it just keeps getting better.
---
Just from what I know from the trading forums PC has the tiniest amount of traders. Now that may or may not mean they have the smallest population idk
---
Man if you wanted a glass Joe build you had it. You're missing out on adrenaline and a ton of other stuff making you a halfway pistoler and rifle-er.
---
I did run into mole miners today with mike rats, but no mines!
---
Idk, like I said I like the game. Just prefer the single player entries I suppose, especially New Vegas. I was just curious as to why people were saying the franchise is dead. It's not, regardless of whether 76 was a success or failure, one bad or mediocre game doesn't kill a franchise (unless you're owned by EA, then they'll kill your studio before you can say War Never Changes)
---
&gt; You’re a coward if you spawn ~~kill at Train Stations~~
---
FTFY
---
Will there ever be an end to the "Will there ever be an end to the 'im coming back to this game, is it good yet?'" posts?
---
yeah, the event should be something like a minimum of 1 landed shot per minute if you’re not contributing 1% dmg overall or something like that.
---
If you don't mind. Let me fix your builds. I'll give you one for rifles and one for pistols
---
Yeah, imagine all of that on seasonal with a new character. It wouldn't be as hard to do some of those challenges because most people's characters are super powerful.   
---
The challenge would be so much higher. The burrows imo only did so badly because it was just too easy and we were all over-leveled. This would also give us the ability to make new characters with other people not being 200-300+ scaling the enemies in the area to them.   
---
As I've said it would be optional so wouldn't have to do it unless you wanted said items.
---
I did run into mole miners today with mole rats, but no mines!
---
Once people start thinking and acting for themselves, maybe.
---
14.99 used on gamefly.com
---
There's no rules about running from combat with your tail between your legs and screaming "Don't hurt me!" either.
---
No one said you can't do it. They said doing it makes you a coward.
---
I think the OP is saying that it DOES affect them because the body disappears if they can't get to it in time (because it can get pretty crowded).
---
Otherwise, I know what you mean in that I don't really care who loots what.
---
Both pianos are in the same single set of plans, there isn't a separate one for the grand piano. Responder vendorbots are listed as selling them. I think I bought mine at Charleston Station.
---
Squad up and have a healer- save stims.
---
I’m on
---
Agreed. I've resorted to levelling up my alts so that I have a few different ready-to-play builds for when they hopefully add some challenging content i.e. raids, but other than that there isn't much that I haven't explored or discovered. I really hope the Nuclear Winter shakes things up a bit - I know people are speculating that it's gonna be battle royale, but I want it to be some sort of hardcore PvE thing where they make all content super difficult. However I am looking forward to player vending, as I'll probably spend quite a few hours perfecting my shop front!
---
Deathclaw are still terrifying early game but in FO1 and 2 i remember shredding them with my good old Winchester plasma rifle and my bff .223 Pistol in FO1 in Boneyard Warehouse. Better Critical perk and lot of Luck was quite ultimate in those 2 FO.
---
No one said it wasn't allowed, just that it's a bitch move.
---
Best practices: when you see the event trigger, scrap and dump your loot before going. Also, don't loot anything before the SHEEPSQUATCH is down.
---
You know what makes you sound like an ass, calling someone else an ass while overstating how I personally feel inside my brain. I don't give a shit about the internet points except that its a great metric for activity and opinions. The fact is that it went -8/9 faster than OP went 12-15, and now he's at 15. A bunch of people just throw their opinion with a downvote instead of a discuss why I'm wrong. It would be great to be told why I'm wrong so I can learn....without being called an ass. Oh and I wasn't talking about OP specifically, but the other guy that disagreed with me and went bitchmode. He's blocked now.

How do you kill the survival player hiding in this base? No stairs btw, likely placed only when they are there.
---
This. You pretty much always have plenty of time to just block those losers.
---
Yeah can only add so many Atom items to my base with a maxed budget and they keep releasing more
---
I also said I didn't support spawn killing. I was only saying that people should stop complaining about this since there are solutions to it.
---
Thanks for the input!
---
That and it can make ice cold drinks that have increased stats like from 4
---
Some say auto-fire got nerfed, and it works better with single clicks. Personally, i have no idea.
---
Awesome to hear.  I think it could have been a few things. Glad I checked in here and excited to figure out how to get more rad-away!
---
I'll buy that off you if you're on ps4.
---
Thank you for the assistance!!
---
Built a section for mine already, I have a fort with shops, bar, lounge, workshops, bedrooms... I’m far more ready than I should be. 
---
(Although being at max budget might be an issue lol)
---
R Kelly is that you?
---
Don't see how, you can only sell so much per day also there's a cap limit, plus you're stash is limited.
---
This would make it less awkward in areas with other players might even encourage more team play.
---
Are they? I didn't know they were in the same set (obviously).
---
Understandable for people trading with you. If you pull a good trade, you get karma. Lots of good trades = lots of karma. Low karma = low good trades and gives people the idea you're probably a scammer. Stick by these rules and don't let people take advantage of your low karma and you should be good. Private messages are something to stay away from as well, I do all my trading and talking on the trade post so I have proof if it was a scam.
---
If you're trying to shoot something with a high-end explosive gun that does a lot of damage, sometimes your splash damage is enough to kill a low level turret or basic shack wall if it happens to be near to what you're trying to kill.  It almost never happens unless the player is intentionally making a very weak structure to fudge high level, geared up players into an unintentional situation by using a fragile camp and a slip of area awareness to force PvP, where they can then smash you in 1-2 hits while you're still processing what's happening, mostly helpless and collect a high bounty on a lvl 200+ player.  It's the same tactics inner city muggers use, and really effective when you're not prepared.  I've been mugged twice in my life, both times being fooled by a "helpless" foil and robbed from behind.  I was totally not expecting it while participating in an event in a video game.
---
PC, sorry
---
You sound like you have issues my man.
---
The characters aren’t powerful. The problem is duplicated items ruined the game. Flooding the game with god rolled legendary weapons. They were initially supposed to be extremely rare and hard to obtain but now TSE weapons are as common as any 1 Star. 
---
If the game was going to be difficult then they need to buff enemies or nerf weapons, making a new character won’t make anything easier or harder.
---
yeah, I know. but it seriously limits your range of motion especially indoors.
---
That's lame.  Instant death no.
---
This must be a new bug, I had this but it was a bottle of vintage nukashine, said “steal” and nothing happened anyways.
---
sure, but if you want a wall inside one side of it is unfortunately going to be the brick side.
---
Sure but karma comes from all pages and if I created a community that I was a part of and had a separate profile could I not just give myself the karma and it seems as though I carry the karma over from page to page so it doesn't seem like the karma is specific to a specific trading community but it's more specific to the person's activity within Reddit am I incorrect in this
---
I'm level 74 and the only good legendary I've found was my explosive vampire gatling gun. It's fantastic but it's not TSE, sadly. I think it would be entirely too OP if it were, tbh. But I definitely would take it over a TSE without vampire. The heals are just too good.
---
Boot camp is the closest(the one I use cause I'm so sexy) and tough enough I think is like a buzz cut .. what really pisses me off is there's no warhawk ,,, there's some cheesy poofy looking mohawk but no raider style WARHAWK DAMNIT!! this game is shit!!!!!!!!
---
I saw someone just walk out into scorchbeast territory while a guy was harassing him. They were so busy trying to get him to fight, they didn't notice him aggro the scorchbeast until it started bombarding the area. Then he just calmly stood back in his power armour while the troll got caught in the blasting, and backed off when they engaged it to let them draw aggro. He waited patiently for the troll to finish off the SB, then grabbed the loot and waved. It was glorious.
---
Yes, those dupped items are what makes everyone powerful lol.. In a seasonal those weapons WOULD become hard to obtain. And everyone and their mother wouldn't run around with them because that character would be deleted in a month or two.
---
It's also coming from my excavator and T:51 without the paint. I think it's an audio glitch, but it sounds kind of electrical right?
---
Sorry no libtardians here.
---
This worries me as I am reaching that one (81, but I mean I'm getting there!) and the friend I play with (same level) never got the achievement for reaching 25.
---
Right now all I got is 1091 if you want I can give you a last bastion or something with it
---
I'm only lvl 37 sniper, but found the dry spot around lvl 24 to 30.  In that time I did a walkabout to find as many places as possible, side quests, and some easy event like Grafton Days, 
---
However, it was the walkabout that did it. I'd drop my junk and head out with a who cares if I die attitude.  That freedom allowed me to test limits and figure out what I could and couldn't do.  Learned that at lvl 26 I could take down lvl 58 ghouls, which showed that o was being a bit too cautious and could earn more exp due to increased risk.
---
Bottom line, explore more, side quests, and take some chances
---
Rumbly
---
Search the person’s  trade history.  You can track if the karma is coming from successful transactions.
---
Np, some of the plans are named oddly. Like, the bed with the blue Vault Tec blanket is called Simple Modern Bed while Vault Tec Bed 2 is the one with the green blanket. Makes it a lot easier to find when you know what the heck they labeled it!
---
If you're defending people playing like assholes, that makes you an asshole too.
---
Thanks. You can't actually play, but the chance for pictures is pretty cool.
---
Kind of justifying my position? I wouldn't want to tempt you to exploit even more. Lol (note: I said tempt. I know you said you haven't used exploits even though you could.)
---
But good point. We need the option to forfeit workshops too.
---
I genuinely have no idea what I hit at, I use rifleman max X 3,  tank killer max , covert op max, bloody mess maxed.
---
(Think that’s it lol)
---
Using a max level instigating gauss rifle.
---
I use my *bloodied and *anti-armor gat at Wesy Tek all the time works wonders. I'd pay 5,000 caps, but I bet you could get 5x as much easy if you posted it for sale.
---
Yepper
---
They can break it, this costs materials and caps to fix
---
Yea my buddy actually is sayin the same thing now
---
It's well known.
---
I am on PC, but I'm specifically waiting on player vending to avoid the hassle of meeting up with people and time zones and what not. I also won't have time to get on for a while due to exams
---
Oh wow. Thanks for letting me know. 
---
Is that the only camp item that works that way?
---
Anything in your camp can be damaged. So if you know there's a griefer around, it's a good idea to stow anything you don't want to get smashed up.
---
i didnt see what sub this was on and got really concerned for a moment
---
Spawn a chest of some kind at the point of death.
---
I guess the reason i didn't know I wanted these is because I don't want these.
---
Every. Single. Day.
---
Possibly Tuesday?
---
I think you're looking at it from the point of view of someone that would only sell scrap. There are tons of people out there that buy scrap, even from vendors. Plus, you can sell more than 1400 caps per day if you're also buying things (not just scrap), which is what happens in a healthy economy. I don't buy scrap, maybe you don't, but it is bought and sold. 
---
And if being able to loot each other's kills and sharing perk cards isn't getting folks to team up, 100 more plastic probably isn't going to tempt them either.
---
And if you had skill, you'd go after people who can fight back.
---
I don’t know.. maybe it’s just me but I’d hate starting over and having to collect plans and recipes all over again. All my hard to find weapon upgrades, armor upgrades, power armor upgrades.
---
have a medics dragon 
---
and got a hunters dragon from a SBQ fight today
---
I knew that part but didn’t realize the extent I guess lol
---
I just thought you could log out or just move your camp to fix items but also thought it didn’t take as many items to fix it. 
---
I am still very much a newbie lol
---
This is why i wear hats. Also i dont let people see their futures for free :)
---
It's not multiple accounts. Everyone just thinks you're an asshole.
---
It's because I'm at level 190. I use all kinds of guns, just not melee. I keep around a vampire's cultist blade for the hell of it but 99% of my damage is from guns and explosives. At this point I already have a decent 1* legendary for all my weapons. Not much is worth to me unless it either beats the decent stuff I already have, or if it's something good I can sell later where the price outweighs the stash space it takes up
---
They can. They have 30 seconds of invincibility. That's plenty of time to locate and get sights on or flee from the area
---
will remember that little trick
---
Spawn killing in adventure?  Never heard of that before.  In survival?  Better watch your ass.  You travel into Whitesprings Train Station or Resort and you know someone will try to gank you.
---
I loved that helmet. I wore that for a very large chunk of my first few weeks. Idk why I stopped, I need to pick it back up. Pretty sure I still have one in my stash
---
Will there ever be an end to the snarky comments on the "Will there ever be an end to the "Will there ever be an end to the 'im coming back to this game, is it good yet?'" posts?"
---
Brick roofs?
---
I would be sad to lose what I have gained in 203 levels but it would be nice
---
That is what I thought I would have to do as a last resort.
---
I didn’t know that about One Violent Night, thanks!
---
I had it built in my two story, hotel style house as a free amenity for anyone that wants to use it, complete with an on/off switch leading into an interior garden intended for health and well-being, but I can opt to store it in the CAMP build menu to replace for free at my discretion.  The reason I stored it was that I was playing with two friends and couldn't quit the server without losing my team, and the shower requires stabilized flux to repair.  Of course I could just gather new flux, which is a slight chore, but why do that when I see a threat on the map and simply store it until the threat is gone?
---
Dickheads can't physically "take" anything from you, aside from junk and caps, but they can ruin a large camp in minutes and force the owner to spend resources in the interest of providing a refuge in a premier spot intended for the overall community.  My camp is across the tracks from the Whitespring Station, and 99.9% of the time players are really happy to have a fully stocked house open to the public with multiple beds and workbenches that's just outside the nuke zone. I have three guest rooms on the second floor and it's not uncommon for all three beds to be occupied by AFK players when a Whitespring nuke is underway.
---
Seems great actually
---
Any item you can build works this way
---
I was about to guess it’s not allowed in order to stop RMT. Then I realized what I was about to do and... yeah. 
---
I agree. I always liked being able to drop guildies surprise pets, or subscriptions if they’re in a pinch. It’s a good social function.
---
Plans should be fine because AFAIK we can currently sell them, they just aren't worth anything.
---
All ammo is literally unsellable.
---
For me I just find myself going into survival mode more often.  Adventure mode is just grind city.  Not that you can’t enjoy it, but that can be boring.
---
They can’t just randomly kill you in adventure mode. You have to do something, in game, to get flagged as pvp. 
---
Taking of someone’s caps (which is a little amount) is to add risk to pvp. And it makes sense.
---
Either dont take workshops or turn on pacifist mode. Theres no other way someone can kill you unless they use a trap in their house.
---
If you don’t want to be competitive then don’t re-engage the slap damage
---
did you own a workshop? if so then you did engage in PVP it tells you that
---
Yes finding everything and starting would be a pain but recipe farming wouldn't be the point of seasonal. The point of seasonal would just be to create a new character in this game mode and complete a series of events for a rare item that would disappear after that season. Don't think of it as recipe/item farming lol.
---
Take my upvote for using hypothesis and not theory.
---
As a new user I've noticed people edit listing and edit post reply as well. So believe veteran scammer would likely just deleted a post if it contained negative feedback.
---
&gt; I'm only saying it's allowed and you have to learn to deal with it.
---
Yeah. You're not wrong, but what you're talking about has nothing to do with what OP is saying. Just because something is "allowed" doesn't mean that it's not cowardly to do it.
---
That makes no sense. I owned a workshop, I didn’t take it from anyone, and someone just randomly came up and killed me, didn’t even try to steal the workshop. Regardless it’s been done while I’ve been adventuring around. I literally don’t pvp ever. I think it’s stupid.
---
I have pacifist mode on all the time.
---
Yesterday the SBQ fell through ground after we killed her. It was disappointing to not getting the loot after using the supplies needed to kill her. Also if people weren't as worried about tagging her, they would probably help clear the ads more.
---
doesn't matter the game tells you in several load screen taking a work shop is a PVP act
---
It's slightly less annoying than the "I'm leaving and here is my essay on why that matters" we had during the first few updates. I'll take this over those if we have to choose one
---
That seems like a very fair sentiment.  Given that you have limited fast travel options in Survival, there should really be a safe zone around and within all fast travel points, save your camp.  PvP is a red hot smoking mess right now on so many levels.
---
Nah dude you're just an asshole. Get some help, since camps in a game set you off so much. And if you're referring to me, you bet your dumb ass I went "bitch mode" on you. You made a joke about rape towards me and immediately deleted it. You deserve it.
---
Workshops have a risk reward. It’s been know and people are fine with it because either they stay away or take them and know the risk. It’s not stupid. Just don’t take them or go play something else if you’re going to cry about a mechanic that’s been in the game.
---
You need to look for positive posts though.  Confirmed trades where karma is exchanged is how you identify people that have participated in good trades before.
---
I also thought 2.0 would have npcs and actual quests but with the actual option of single player, also mod support :P
---
I’ve learned the plan but don’t have one to sell. I can mod your staff when I’m back online tomorrow, if you see me stop by, gamertag “Digital Press”.
---
Sentinel/assassins is but one symptom of a much bigger problem though.  PVP is basically gear dependent, and getting the right gear involves grinding that frankly, just isn't my idea of fun.  And yes, I consider trading with people on reddit to be part of the grind.   You either have to grind for caps or grind for gear that people are willing to trade for. 
---
I don't find any of it fun. 
---
I haven't played for about a week because it got to wear my team mates spent most of their time talking about plans and gear and I just got sick of hearing it because I just want to play the game.
---
Lol this is so well done I thought it was official for a second
---
Tickles!

If you are going to start fresh, research the build you want and carefully pick your perks. I'm starting 2 new characters and plan on not wasting any perks like I did on my original.
---
Yeah I miss football season too :)
---
First of all find new weapon, and don’t use its till they buff damage and decrease breaking rate
---
From someone who plays on xbox..it was hearsay, don't take it as fact lol. Just adding my input.
---
Commenting in case I get home from work around then.
---
Well the tse laser does 400 DMG each time I shoot it.
---
I ignore them too, until they exploit game mechanics to force PVP on me.
---
U playing Bloodied build? 
---
Do I use shotty modifier? How many shots it can do before destroyed?
---
Nice! Please don’t track blood on the carpets.
---
Lol that’s hard to do when that’s literally the only thing you do in this game (farming for items)
---
How would said item roll over when items are deleted and have no “roll over” feature at all in the game? And if they did implement a roll over feature when would you ever play your main character when your always grinding that new character you just created for the new season?
---
If there weren't assholes, there wouldn't exist the opportunity to help someone in trouble. It's all part of the game.
---
Everyone past 50 is on equal ground.
---
Not until it’s “good yet”
---
Then there's really no way you can be killed. Something you're missing I think.
---
You realize you did exactly what you were fearing would happen to you?
---
So no different than your mom?
---
It's a part of the game they have to learn.
---
Whoever wrote that has no idea what they're talking about.
---
Well I use ammo Smith. It can actually last a decent while. And no I’m not a bloodied build. Like I said I don’t even know what I am. And yes I also use a shorty modifier. Yes I know it’s highly inaccurate but as long as I see the person, they get shot.
---
TSE being OP? You're joking, right? Not even the better legendaries are OP. Also, TS and Vampire's are both 1st star effects, so VE is possible, but not V and TS.
---
Tip i learned was to just stay in passive and follow them screaming the most annoying sounds you can make into area chat
---
Go to a vendor buy everything he has ... sell it back to him .... repeat.
---
In a game that doesn't hide the cap limit I fail to see how anyone could get themselves up to it.
---
Definitely! GT: AlexAutoAxe PLEASE let me know, I've been looking all over for someone to help me

I would take a greenhouse as well.
---
I know there are better builds, certainly. Bloodied seems to be the best for dps right now from what I've seen, but I was more meaning if there was a TSE with vampire, it would be a lot of dps and healing.
---
I didn't know that effects were related to stars, though. That's good information.
---
Here is the article if you wish to read it! I havent played PVP mode so I wouldn't know. :)

---
Oh lordy what a plethora of bad ideas
---
Where is this?
---
I had a dude take a shop and fill it with lamps and it costed 100 caps to take back lol.. excellent troll move
---
No, just no.
---
BE at 75% HP is better than TSE. You don't need a build for it, it's always better to use it than TSE.
---
There's also FE, which caps out at a higher boost than TSE, and AAE, which is also usually higher damage than TSE. Then there's IE, which is better than TSE for 1-4 hit kill weapons.
---
TS VATS is also completely useless and TS breaks way easier. You don't need a specific build for TSE to not even be top 3.
---
At least you didn't waste any caps on buying TSE, right?
---
Yeah, but they're immersion breaking and ugly.
---
He really made a comment like that? Good god. I had this whole reply for him and was about to post it and guess what? He deleted his comment preventing from replying to it. I was right that whole deleted comment chain was mostly his...
---
Definitely toxic as fuck.
---
ive seen it and it says how its in nevada and how its literally just new vegas with a new name
---
Just the ability to rejoin a previous server would add to world permanence.
---
That’s not the point, besides a lot of the time you have to. It’s either get rolled over or die trying to defend your stuff. It’s ignoring the problem as well.
---
I did the same thing lol
---
Thankfully, it seems! Thank you for the information. So I need to be looking out for BE heavy guns ideally. I normally have high health (given the vampire) so I never considered a bloodied weapon. But thinking about fighting the queen, I'm never at full health for that fight.
---
Where do you find the pianos in the building screen?
---
I never do 0 cap trades for anything unless ive played with them multiple times and trust them. Only do cap trades if you are skeptical. I dont trust anyone from reddit with 0 cap trades. If It's weapons then trade for 5k 10k or whatever you feel the value is so if they run with it you get your moneys worth anyway.
---
There is no problem if you’re not forced to be killed by people you don’t want to fight.
---
What’s the problem?
---
It feels like you’re making one to complain that you need better gear without putting in the hours these guys do.
---
Lol, it’s easy to think that about people when you don’t put much thought into it. If you have something significant to contribute, by all means, but otherwise maybe keep these kinds of comments to yourself :)
---
Thank you. It really bothers me when people use 'Theory' as well. Not knowing that a Theory is when a series of tested Hypothesis all come to the same conclusion.
---
It's irritating and reduces the impact of what a Theory really is.
---
Yup! He sure did. All because I said that people having camps like these don't affect him or his game play. Dude decided to say "OH I'LL RAPE YOUR FAMILY THAT SURE WON'T AFFECT YOU HAHAHAHA" and then deleted it right as I tried to reply to it. So I sent him a nice lil message 🤷🏻‍♀️ he needs help, big time
---
I agree with that, but was also joking and think they **do** cause problems. If the griefers can come up and 1shot my turrets and blow up walls that look nice on my open-door camp, why can't i destroy this floating foundation/floor pile of raw fertilizer?
---
I just don't understand.
---
Well that's the other thing, they already said they are making a system that allows people like you to 'reset' to lvl  1, but as a sort of 'legendary'. This, while at first appearing to be end game content, I think will also allow for old users to get to the same lvl as new users.
---
I lost mine somehow. I checked both Colonel Kelly and Bolton Greens, I couldn’t find one. Any suggestions?
---
I’m level 40 and still haven’t “left the vault” lol
---
I'm one of those guys. I've tried to come back several times and it still isnt grabbing my attention for more then an hour at a time and I leave it alone for a few months.
---
I have had someone initiate the capture process then fast travel to me, and kill me asap.
---
No fun, as I wasn't even aware that the process had started as I was in combat with a mirelurk queen at the time.
---
Would like there to be a range limit on how far the PVP flag is in effect.
---
Quick question- is there a way to check the health of your camp in the Pip?
---
A single player mode would be interesting, but I imagine that any character made in single player mode would not be able to be imported to the online mode. The reason is simply that this would allow for too much cheating.   
---
And yes, I imagine the mod support will also be a key feature of this. Especially when going to Steam.
---
It's like telling your kid no. They're gonna do it anyway
---
Ignore this guy, folks. He was being SUPER toxic on a post from earlier of someone just showing off their camp, made a comment/joke about raping my family cause I said people having camps like the one in the post don't affect him or his game play, and deleted the comment as I was replying. He also deleted all of his comments from the same post. Dude needs serious help, ignore his opinions and posts. ✌🏻
---
Same thing is happening to me. Been playing since day one, never had any issues but three times in the last week someone has broken everything in my camp. This patch can’t come too soon.
---
Not at all. The problem is that I can have the same hours and get slammed because of broken mechanics that make combat unfair.
---
Dear god yes. I think this would be really great. I hate it when I get disconnected after meeting someone new and not friend'ing them, because then I can't go back.
---
UGH I hate that shit so much. And I know I'm going to get reported for the things I say over the mic when they do that. I can be very creative with my epithets
---
There will probably be actual seasons in the "Nuclear Winter" update lol
---
What exactly is unfair?
---
I swear I’m not usually this dumb I’m just not following.
---
It should be clarified that the rad shower specifically is quite expensive to build, and also expensive to repair (multiple pure/stable fluxes aren't the cheapest things, along with other materials). The majority of camp items aren't nearly as expensive to build and repair. The fusion generator in terms of materials is about as close as you can get to the rad shower. Everything else is significantly cheaper.
---
Yeah that makes sense
---
Too much of a hassle? Why not go ahead and block them at least? Otherwise you just encourage them. If everyone who ran into them blocked them and / or reported them they'd fucking STOP being asshats
---
Thank you!
---
Well thought up. *claps* I miss football too. I’m hoping Atlanta has it this year
---
I think those discover challenges are just still bugged. I made a new character, have discovered Hemlock Holes and Grafton Dams on both characters, still no credit.
---
Ive got this challenge for all the reigons. I keep taking photos but its not accounting for them. Am I doing something wrong?
---
No problem! Yup, that's why good BEs are always 10k+ while TSEs are typically around 5k. I always run BE guns, Bloodied melee, and Unyielding armor. It's amazing, especially at 20% HP. You don't even need to be that extreme, though. The 50-75% mark is still the best possible damage over other legendaries.
---
Depends on what your doing in there 🤨,..
---
Platform? Not interested but had to be asked
---
The sets are pretty lacking. I'm really sad they took away the glass walls/ ceilings from FO4. I'm also sad that there's no good balcony walls, and you have to use the Defense short wood slat walls to make a porch/balcony
---
Jesus Christ I thought I was geeking out over here. I noticed it today and kept turning around hitting the vats and yet nothing was there. I even asked my wife did she drug me or am I hearing shit. I only hear it with the headset on
---
I block them because it's like making a police report, you want to get their name on the report in case they escalate. One guy was kiling me and my friends over and over before they took away slap damage in adventure... He griefed us and blew up our camps so I reported him EACH TIME and sent video to Bethesda (he was using one of my friends as a spotter, the fuck). Eventually Beth said they had taken action and the guy wasn't heard from again...for a long time. I just saw him again a few days ago ... ALEXSLOAN if you read this, please kindly eff off so I don't have to get you suspended again
---
Farmed 100 fusion cores from Monongah and Thunder Mountain. Got murdered 3 times doing it and lost about 400 caps total. Never going back to workshops. They are simply murder dens for desperate PVP griefers. I still have the 100 fusion cores (for laser gat &amp; PA) but the Power User perk really makes a difference and I keep finding fusion cores in the wild so I haven't had to use any of them yet. Fusion cores are the only thing I needed from workshops. Everything else I can get via ore or scrapping.
---
I started a new character after beta just to start fresh entirely and still don't have these achievements I should have.
---
i have this issue on my alt running full auto and heavy. have a quad auto tesla that appear to be my cause stoped using it have not see issue. my main uses tesla charging barrel with no issues. (mains is vampire) so suspect its either the auto barrel or quad.
---
it comes spiral bound :)
---
I absolutely think they're going to add NPCs. It fits in with the lore as well - the whole point of Vault 76 is that, over time, some of these vault dwellers will settle down, build new towns and reproduce. It doesn't invalidate the main story either, since adding NPCs in this way isn't backtracking or retrofitting, but rather just progressing the world over time. I believe Bethesda had the intention to do this from the beginning, as it's a natural progression and I think they intended for the world to feel desolate and empty because that fits with the whole 'everyone died' atmosphere. My guess is they just failed to make that clear and wanted to keep it a mystery and evidently backfired because of mis-placed PR lol, but again that's just how I imagine everything went down.
---
I LOVE the idea of anchoring to servers. I remember playing on a Minecraft server which had player-built towns with dedicated areas to build houses, shops, farms etc and I had so much fun building a town of my own and getting people to move in near me. Of course I think it's unlikely that we'll get the same level of sandbox in FO76, but something along those lines would make my C.A.M.P feel like less of an individual shack in the middle of nowhere. Another benefit of this is that you get to know regulars on the server over time, which creates a feeling of community even if you're playing solo.
---
I really hope you and I (and everyone else with these wishes) are right on some of these aspects. Fallout 76 is an unpolished diamond with the same comeback potential as ESO and No Man's Sky, and with the recent hard work of the devs I personally think it deserves a second shot at becoming a hit title.
---
They can't go to survival, they'll be killed lol
---
Xbox I forgot to put that
---
Perverts!
---
Yes! I play Liberty Prime soundbytes over and over until they log off
---
I vaguely remember the glass, those could have been nice too. Especially if we got planters. It just drives me up the wall they make nice flooring/items for sale in Atomic shop like the laminate floors, etc and then expect you’re gonna put that stuff in what basically amounts to a shit shack on the outside.
---
Why not?  🤔
---
Ikr? Can't wait to see what comes then.
---
Sure thing. I share because lots of people don’t know how awesome it is, or the best way to slow down and maximize the ghoul attacks. It’s an awesome event, especially when groups show up and ghoul swarms increase. :)
---
This. Be the change you want to see
---
Faction PvP and Challenges.
---
Raider faction example: Kill x number of players while wearing Raider outfit and hat
---
Thanks for writing that up. I now realize this has happened to me before. I just thought they had figured out how to keep stacking bobbleheads like in the old days because I got one shotted and that never happens in adventure anymore
---
If you don't want to be found, just go into a building
---
No, it's best to give up forever.
---
Mutations, namely Marsupial and Adrenal Reaction. Fighting somebody constantly flying into the air while using VATS to guarantee hits on you is one. 
---
VATS in PvP is also kinda dumb, being able to 100% hit somebody with auto-aim and crits, but I can live with it.
---
Perks mixed with Legendary effects. Anti-Armor as well as explosive for crippling limbs and extra damage is a brutal combo, mix that in with Assassin’s gear and you’re basically unstoppable.
---
Throw in a stealth boy so they can’t target you with VATS on top of it all, and it’s just unfair.
---
You and me both lol
---
No! Because pretty soon Bethesda will add acorn skinned fusion cores to the atomic shop along with the flaming hot rod PA skins that buffs the explosive vent PA mod when applied. So no! They wont fix those little annoyances since they have to make money out of those things too.
---
Dang
---
sadly nope. you can’t search dead enemies once they’ve turned into meat piles. 
---
it kinda sucks
---
But why can’t you get that stuff?
---
On the vats, I agree; I hate it and don’t ever use it.
---
I didn’t even use it in 4. 
---
If you’re on Xbox I have s few serums I can give you for free.
---
I have unyielding sentinel armor and an BE Laser rifle too but those are my personal items lol
---
My first nuke was somewhere south of Flatwoods (i think). Me and a friend barely managed to get the nuke launched, so actuslly looting the nuke area was just burning AP getting away from foes. Lotta Quantum went into that. Heheh good times
---
Yeah, it's weird the things they added/ didn't add. All this pristine junk to decorate the house, and then a crappy door and smashed up walls. If we can build a working plasma Gatling gun from scratch, we can slap some wood and drywall together.
---
The rad shower is extremely expensive in rare materials like pure flux to fix after being broken by griefers. So people often dont even leave them out
---
Yeah, I think that they intended on creating a sort of desolate atmosphere so that we could rebuild the land. But, I also think this was due to them not being able to properly incorporate NPC's at the start. I think that they didn't have the time to make this work (the evidence being the very launch of the game being so buggy).
---
So, they figured that they could make this the 'atmosphere' of the world until they could develop the game and servers to fit NPC's and player interactions with them (and not just blank humans that would be no different than the NPC's we have today in the game).
---
And yes, FO76 is a very, very unpolished diamond that could be amazing IF they put the time and effort into it (and a new marketing campaign to boot with said changes).
---
Stupid question (well, there are no stupid questions, just a lot of inquisitive idiots, uhh, which makes me an idiot I suppose) but what does blocking a player *do*, gameplay-wise?
---
Fair enough. Just let me know your IGN and when you list that item ;)
---
usually when people start breaking my camp (it’s happened twice to me before) i leave the world
---
Amen brother
---
They can't see you and you can't see them on the map, they can't send you messages on console, I think, (I'm on PC)... it just helps you stay away from them.
---
That sounds like the Laser Musket idle sound lol ... do you by any chance have a Laser Musket that you shouldn't ?
---
\[Everybody Liked That\]
---
Maybe. I think problems could happen if a random player who hadn't seen this post misconstrued it as you trying to cheat in some way and reported you. Bethesda have banned people for less. But, if you're describing it correctly, it does sound pretty harmless and you've just found a cool way to make a secret lair rather than trying to use it to gain a competitive advantage. So you can't be certain either way, and it's probably best if you don't use the glitch while other players are around.
---
Pretty genius. Seems like this could all be made with existing assets/mechanics. Would add a much needed endgame for high level players and give Survival mode something special. Hey Bethesda, hope you paying attention.
---
Wasn’t this added late into FO4s cycle?
---
I’ve drawn one person who was level 90ish (was level 50 myself)  into an ambush doing this. Had my squad of level 200+’s waiting in hiding in the trees along a road as I led him in, fired once back at him and then watched him get obliterated ..
---
On one of the trading subs they have karma devoted strictly to that sub
---
It had been a lot more frequent on Xbox
---
Count me in.
---
Fun weapon, OP. This weapon would've have duped like a m-fer. Please hold onto it tight so it doesn't end up in the hands of some a-hole. I had the opportunity to trade for some god drop weapons during the height of the duping era but chose to remain "pure" despite the temptation b/c I wanted the real experience and to earn it. I'd rather have 1 semi-god drop that I earned organically than 100 duped copies of one. 
---
Op, did you happen to record the kill when you got the drop for the proof or ownership? When I get my god roll, I am recording it so nobody can accuse me of finessing.
---
I can get all that stuff, I just feel like a level 5 should be able to defend his or her C.A.M.P. from a level 300. 
---
And that’s not the case right now. Hell, even a level 147 like myself can’t stop that level 300 who’s geared towards PvP because of the mechanics in place at the moment.
---
I was messaging someone who I'm pretty sure was distracting me and I didnt hear things break so I couldn't do that this time
---
 Went to watoga high and killed some lvl 52  Gutsys(Gutsies?). Both the 2 shot and the no legendary took 15 shots  to kill and both list damage at 126. I'm not seeing by tooltip or using  it any kind of damage increase on the tesla. I tried both direct  shots and reflected off the ground at their feet. Shots  to kill were the same each time.
---
I lived through a tornado that hit everything around me but didn't hit my house too hard. Just broke a few storm windows but my neighbors had parts of their roofs missing and my landlord's  carport roof got picked up and carried over the house and sat down next to my bed room window. 
---
I will never forget the feeling of coming outside afterwords. No electricity. It's quiet as can be and everyone is emerging slow and careful, and people group together and start talking about what happened and then they start firing up the grill and getting in cars to go get supplies like to the hardware store first and foremost to get stuff to fix things with. And coffee! 
---
I built a temporary fence for my neighbor that I'd never even talked to before. Poor thing was disabled and couldn't walk her dog and couldn't let it out due to the fence being torn down so I went to Lowe's and got all the stuff and built the fence a couple hours after the storm had passed. It brings the whole community together in a way. But then they forget all that within a month and you never talk to them again
---
Ok seems legit
---
Exactly! I'd love for others to see my character identified sort of like:
---
Vyncynt  
---
DeadMeat (Level 55)
---
...instead of just plain old "Vyncynt"
---
Good point, that could very well have been the case. Either way, I think it would be a mistake for them to leave adding NPCs until almost a year after launch. I think even if they just added some simple NPCs like a Vault 76 version of Grahm, they could have shown that there is *some* development happening in the game's lore. Deeper questlines can be added over time (I believe their new "main quest" during the Summer update will be the first instance of proper NPCs), but I think players just want to see some sign of life - some sign that all their work against the scorched is having an impact and is allowing civilisation to rebuild.
---
ah, i gotcha. that’s terrible i’m sorry :(
---
THANK you. Every time someone gushes over Tactics, it vexes me so much, because it was basically a tactical board game that pretended it was an RPG, and terribly balanced to boot (Fun fact, I never finished the game, because after playing two thirds of it against ghouls and super mutants and raiders, &gt;!the robot whatevers!&lt; show up and were basically immune to every weapon I was running with. Not, "Oh, tee hee, that hurt," just straight up impossible to kill unless you had specific builds ready to go.
---
It basically took out what made Fallout 1 and 2 good in exchange for more clicking on a square and watching your AP drop.
---
BOS? There was no BOS. You must have imagined that absolute shit show.
---
I'd give two-thirds of them that level of credit after seeing the periodic "games dead" comments on FB Fallout 76 group...
---
Actually if it was on ps4 I would be interested but seeing as I can't be on for the next 10hrs I can't.
---
Try to search it as soon as it dies while it's still a corpse and not a meat pile
---
You can find previously encountered players in the Social menu if I'm not mistaken - not quite as good as re-joining a server but it may solve your problem regarding losing contact with non-friend players.
---
It is. This isn't some shit you make up about a person for shits and giggles, this is serious shit. Serious shit that he said. So, yeah, it's legit.
---
Almost reminds me of when the mic was open all the time. Someone was watching some pretty intense gangster movie in the background...
---
Ok I believe you sorry the guy seems like a dick
---
They players who are geared towards PvP lose out a lot on stuff geared toward PVE as well.
---
For example, I have *ZERO* quality of life perks.
---
If it weren’t for healing factor I’d die of hunger or thirst all the damn time lol.
---
My carry weight would be incredibly low if not for radical and my unyielding sentinel set.
---
If a piece breaks, I’m over encumbered and am forced to drop stuff or hobble to the nearest work bench. 
---
My health is constantly low, if I’m attacked by more than 3 ghouls outside of my PA (which is like 99.9% of the time) I’m probably gonna die because they run fast and if I shoot them close to me I’ll kill my self with my own explosion unless serendipity procs. If I don’t shoot them they’ll rad me to death in 3 hits because I keep my health at 20% with rads.
---
So it’s a pretty big trade off in terms of PVP for PVE mechanics.
---
I don’t PvP a lot, but I like the feeling of one-shorting almost anything.
---
&gt;the rest at the Scorchbeast Queen
---
Lol, epic...
---
Less than 1 day between you putting your foot in your mouth because you didn't know what you were talking about and the post being deleted. Bravo, SailorDak.
---
Tbh I've always assumed it was because we leave Vault 76
---
Half walls are available for all building sets. The Metal Building Set (not warehouse) has a very nice look that has no holes. The window selection is also better. As for the roof I can help you out if on xbox. Check out my profile to see the different and unique ways to build the roof. If all else fails I build bases for people. Check out reddit profile for more information. Have a great day!
---
It is. Just having fun with it.
---
Yea, but have you seen Haven Church?
---
Not your fault dude, people suck sometimes and say shit they shouldn't say (referring to OP) and he appears to have deleted his post
---
I am also having the same issue on Xbox one. My buddy I play with is also stuck. Customer support gave me no help except a power cycle open routers blah blah... if any one finds a solution please help. Or hopefully this post gets their attention
---
Ah gotcha okay sorry haha
---
Ah, OK.  I've never had any issues reaching a lootable part of her body.  In fact, the body usually covers up a bunch of other corpses because it's so big.  Wings etc. sprawled everywhere just give me the SBQ loot window.  That is, when looting her body isn't completely broken.
---
You can use standard defense fencing on standard floor base (not floor floating from staircase.
---
Oh I didn't realize it limited your range. Thanks for the info.

This may help you to beat the Free Range event solo.

Build a metal shelf and make it face backwards, or alternatively, use the actual gas prices sign and face it backwards.
---
Mines gonna be on the porch. I have expanded my porch and included an acoustic guitar, table with punchbowl and a chair!
---
Nukashines on me!
---
I just want Uranium Fever.
---
Given Nuclear Winter has some signs of being an entirely separate experience from the base game, this isn't entirely unlikely. That said, I would guess that private servers and the like are going to come out in the winter after Wastelanders in the fall.
---
Mine got destroyed 2 day sago and I haven't rebuilt yet.
---
You'll just have to get used to being in par with everyone else now.
---
I should probably clarify I meant the actual walls being like half walls not the literal half walls. I meant how the interiors of the build walls have all the framing on them whereas the brick walls don’t so they don’t cause clipping issues with posters and paintings.
---
But I will have a look at your roofing stuff 🤔
---
Yeah, it was pretty fun.  Although, soon as I got back to Thunder Mtn., I got attacked by three scorch beasts.  And then struggled to find the workshop console because I didn't know where to find it!  
---
God that was a pain in the ass.  Nearly broke the Dragon!
---
Bring some friends, dude! This community is always willing to help.
---
I've found a few on ghouls/ in suitcases at WS lately.
---
Exactly. Plus I just think that the human psyche doesn't want to have a world without human NPC's in a game, especially in a series that has had them before and had them as a cornerstone of the game in an RPG sense.
---
We run with a party full of 8 on PS4 and usually have other parties in our friends group on the server with us as well. We have a community page and use it to organize. I’m sure if we get large enough (currently at 20) we’d be forced to use some PC/Mobile clients like discord or Teamspeak in order to stay as organized as we are now.
---
Btw, honestly berserkers will never be meta with the way it works currently. The damage bonus caps out at 30% with 0 armor, meanwhile there are several other legendaries that cap at 50% and dont leave you nearly as vulnerable. Even if armor pen penetrated legendary effects, the meta wouldn't really shift much. If anything, armor would stay the same and people would use AA/E for weapons.
---
Because i was the 15th thread of the day asking not the first. I understand it’s frustrating but the first thing any logical person asks when starting to play a game they haven’t played in awhile is “so what’s changed and how do I make the most of those changed” it actually helps a lot. Also this community seems to have a weak spot when you mention the game was poorly optimized and pretty baron on release. I haven’t loaded the game since like day 4 and I’m excited to get back into the game.
---
Fallout 17, the search for the lost keys.

Fallout 23, another cold winter.

Fallout 47, a stumble, then wake up in the hospital, dazed and confused.

Fallout 80, so very, very tired.

Oh I gotcha. Yeah hopefully some kind of wall paper that will create a solid surface on the walls will show up.
---
DeLaWarrr is correct. There is one trading sub where you reputation does matter in that specific sub. Karma can ONLY be added upon successful trading by the people involved.
---
Unfortunately, we can't link to that hub here because of bad blood and actions between the heads of this sub and that one (so I've heard). If you search for a "market" of this particular game on Reddit, you should find it. Follows the rules regarding posting and your bad trading experiences should be almost nil.
---
No. Not at all. Prices will mostly be horrendous as everyone overprices their sales and end game gear will not be sold at all.
---
I suspect the legendary exchange "scrapper" is so that Bethesda can figure out just how much scrip will be handed out so that they can set the prices at the Purveyor accordingly.
---
It would likely be best if no one returned ALL their legendary items until after the prices were known.  Return some now.  So the scrip amounts given are set.  Return the rest later when the Purveyors prices are set.
---
Well even if someone had the camera you still need the tourist to start the quest.  They are at one of the several spots on every server.  
---
What console are you on?
---
Maybe offer caps to whomever finds it first on your console?

That's true but I like the idea the op brought up. Other games have done that like ff14 as well as eso. I think it could work. Maybe they rework the legendaries so they are balanced better along with the perks. I think that's better than just starting at 0 in the same game again
---
Ugh. Little to no interest at all.
---
If your on PC I can give you an engineer outfit for free. Lord knows I don't use it.
---
I will give it a shot. Thx
---
I finally completed the achievement of leaving vault 76 after making a second character, only took me 4 months to figure out how to open the door.
---
Yeah it's not worth it at all. Example: Base handmade is 92 damage. Explosive handmade 110. With rank5 demolition 120. Not worth 5 perk points.
---
It doesn't affect some weapons at all. I have a explosive plasma Gatling and adding demolition gives no bonus.
---
Massive Clan camps, don’t know how’d it work or how to do it... I just want to see it lol
---
On xbox, unfortunately. Thank you for the offer though.
---
Can't add things you don't have the rights to. Obsidian screwed them on that one.
---
Same here I have been trying since 6:30 EST, as soon as I join the world I get disconnected.
---
I never thought of recording it dropping. It dropped for me at Crevasse Dam. I didn't know what it was until at least 10-15 minutes after it dropped. I tend to mass loot until my bags are full then look at what ive been picking up.
---
It's never leaving my side so long as I can help it. If you ever played WoW I played a paladin from 2006-2016. I have all of the Vanilla WoW paladin quest reward items still sitting in my bank. https://www.wowhead.com/item=20620/holy-mightstone ive got this thing still in my bank. I collect items to put on my figurative mantle piece.
---
It seems like everyone has missed the point of what I’m asking. I’m asking “what’s changed, what’s different” from release. Apparently that upset a lot of people. It basically only shows me that the sub either 1) isn’t welcoming to people who don’t know everything or 2) allow a vocal minority to run rampant. I never once said “this games shit change my mind” I’m simply asking a question about how the game has changed since the last time I played. Like I said, if that’s too upsetting to answers countless times a day, because new people log on for the first time every day, maybe you (the community) should get the mods to make a small post in the side bar with noteable updates and starter tips. I didn’t come to reddit because I couldn’t find the information I came because I didn’t want to real 1500 different articles and watch 200 different YouTube videos to get a general sense for how the games changed. I don’t understand why that’s a sin.
---
Can kinda be done at the moment with glitches... Hopefully legitimate soon.
---
What happened to the post, did the north fall?
---
Yeah, totally agreed.
---
&gt;What changes would you like to see?
---
* There should be ONE fast travel location with a vendor and stash box that is also a safe zone.  
---
* The scoreboard is dumb. Either remove it or tie in-game rewards to a high score. "Competitive but not" is fun for no one.  
---
* There should be PvP quests and events exclusive to Survival. King of the Hill. Capture the flag. Bombing run. Payload. Etc. Get crazy with the cheese wiz.  
---
* The current legendary rewards are joke guns. Award weapons and armor  that actually function in the meta.  
---
* Give players a way to earn seasonal cosmetic awards in the form of camp objects (trophies, decorations, dynamic objects that display your last five victims' heads on sticks including their names, that kinda thing).
---
I like it except I would make it at only one place and allow players to use the same building system as their camp for the 5 mins for defense
---
Its way wayyy more common.  I guess people get bored and want to destroy other people's belongings.  :(
---
Yeah, I understand the trade offs. But like I said earlier, people who do only PvP are unstoppable for the PvE players like myself. 
---
I have 2478 in Fallout 4 and not at one point was I thinking to myself, “I’d love to fight another player, in a multiplayer Fallout.”
---
I server hop the burrows, whitespring and that damn mine that’s next to whitesprings that I suddenly forgot the name of....Damnet. But anyways I end up with decent legendary loot from those 3.
---
True
---
How do you think it's going to be an entirely different experience? Like all new perks or gameplay? Nuclear Winter to me is a total mystery.
---
Eff you! I did almost the same thing! Threw down an extra foundation, punchbowl, Nukashine and benches. 
---
Great minds and whatnot..lol.
---
I need cobalt to make serums and ultracite 45 ammo. Whitesprings has shit for cobalt, so unless I want to smack ghouls for crappy drops I'm going for Morgantown.
---
I’ll be doing it tomorrow after 6pm central. Work first **shrugs** but I have a keycard already so it’ll speed things up
---
Isn't it a quest reward?if so find someone who hasn't completed it or just trade for it.
---
That could be cool too. Like a shared workshop almost.
---
Is this an out of season April's fool post?
---
I play too much but it's worth it
---
I've seen better sides of beef 'been run over by a combine
---
As far as I can tell, all of the leather armor plans are theoretical rewards for Forest events. Chances are probably very low though.
---
Can't wait to gift my friend those sweet repair kits
---
Would be nice if there was a tab where we could see all active events and how long before they expire and see non active events that will start soon.
---
Yeah the only universally midwest thing is 'ope'
---
😱🤢
---
Or build mini camps nearby in addition to
---
I do the mire events while praying for rare outfits. Awol, free range and the encrypted. Pretty much it.
---
I’m calling bullshit
---
Armor would still shift, because everyone will run AA for SentAss anyhow, and if that negates legendary armor effects, then having good SentAss would not be vital any more, but depending on exactly how it works, it might shift to one of the stat boost legendaries because it would end up being at least +5 to all stats but Endurance, assuming it dosn't negate entirely. 
---
But yes, I see your point on the weapons, I was not aware of the relative damage caps.
---
Running gun,some Clint Eastwood movie soundtracks,Johnny guitar,Johnny Cash,Chuck berry,more ambient songs that change based on region,and a robot dj
---
ah ok, thanks for that.
---
I made a new character only the other day to get the missing trophies too like leaving the vault (main character is level 87 and playing since BETA)...I'm hoping I can do the discover locations ones too, but don't sound hopeful after reading this thread..
---
That said, whoever keeps nuking the fissure next to uncanny caverns. It's a dry hole. There is nothing there worthwhile except for the lookout tower crowned enemy.
---
Also if you're in adventure mode and go to take over a workshop *just to start PVP* with somebody that's not suspecting it and fast travel to them outside the workshop, with no intention of taking the workshop, and shoot them in the back while they are fighting NPCs. Then shoot up their power armour while they are dead.
---
"Meh it's just part the game". What being too much of a bitch to try to fight people that really want to fight in survival? Yeah you can do that in the game. It makes you a coward little bitch that's scared to take on people in a straight fight.
---
I'm talking to you, AlexS****. You pathetic wank shite.
---
Oh, also as the Raider Robot Rose says she has reactivated the radio tower to bring in more raiders...well that right there I think totally confirms human NPC's as enemies. Not only that, but I think is kinda the reason why everyone else shows up.
---
And the BOS sends in more troops after last communication from the BOS fighting the scorch.
---
Disappointed if this is true.
---
Yeah I remember the great Todd said the tokens would be used to reroll additional legendaries in a interview. However then the last info we got on the weekly post made it sound like you would use the scrip to buy legendaries from the vendor whenever he shows up in his shop.
---
The second is super fkn lame imo. I felt it would really make crafting weapons useful to be able to add legendary effects to crafted weapons. Especially the more unique ones like sheepsquatch staff, or rerolling uniques like the fixer or that lever action from survival with a unique skin.
---
Well, at the moment all we have is [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bfi9v8/nuclear_winter_is_likely_not_a_harder_mode), which would imply it at least has a different story if nothing else.
---
Two birds with one stone - a fun event *and* it lets people move their Whitespring turret camps to a place where they would benefit everyone!
---
Harpers Ferry is a really good spot if the goal is violet flux and 3 star enemies.
---
hmmpp .. lol exactly :)
---
Just what I wanted....more battle royale games. 👎👎
---
Every time I am about to open my mouth to say something bad about Survival-mode I remember how many psychopaths it's pulling out and quarantining from the Adventure mode.
---
I don't think it will be that bad. Since they showed the mole miner vendor he will probably have a stock of random legos you can buy. 
---
However the will probably be as rare as the responder bot in Charleston and carry trash legos.
---
How is this Fallout?
---
I've played since day one. I've stuck by through the bugs and the glitches. I've applauded the added free content. I've stayed positive through the storm of negativity that has plagued this game.
---
I've kept hope alive.
---
But weepin', creepin', Jeebus...what new thing can you do that the other 50,000 battle royale clones couldn't do??!
---
New player here, 
---
Ive been on the game for about 2 days now (roughly 16 ish hours) and a lot of the complaints/bugs that are talked about on YouTube and other subReddits are still live in game.
---
As someone who isn't emotionally attached to this game like some of you die hard fans are, I can see objectively why they would ask this. They paid money for a AAA game title and this game has a nice scavenger theme to it, but it feels clunky still. Just today I was chased around by headless ghouls who I thought were actually headless, until I got curious and took a blind headshot and killed it. The head wasn't rendering. My computer has a GTX 1080 on it which is overkill for this game. So my video card wasn't the issue.
---
Folks, alot of people dont want to hear it but the game is nice for what it is, not what it SHOULD be.  
---
So then they come in here and ask "is it good yet" they're hoping that Bethesda will deliver a AAA title as they always did because they paid at MINIMUM AAA prices.
---
I personally got it for 25 bucks on sale so I dont really give a shit. Just my 2 cents.
---
If a group of people or a leader comes to the point where people cannot give their opinion or ask a legitimate question like: "has this game improved" without being attacked, then you're closing yourself off to useful critique and this place will only serve as a circle jerk (for lack of better words)  
---
Critique is necessary so that one day when someone asks : "Is this game good yet" the answer can be "Absolutely, all has been fixed and the rest is being worked on. The Atomic shop has awesome cosmetic items for sale, please jump right in and join us in Appalachia."
---
Are they releasing the machine and the vendor at different times?
---
I am XBOX One 
---
I would assume most are either PC or XBOX, not just because that’s two of the three options, but because I’ve always assumed that they share servers. Not that I’m sure on that, I just know Microsoft (unlike Sony) is cool with cross compatibility of multiplayer games. For instance, I’ve played fortnight with my PC friend from my XBOX.
---
I hope so.
---
What’s your source for PC Numbers? I know the trade subreddits PC is like 5% of the posfs
---
I don't bother with Bethesda, but I do report them to xbox live which eventually effect their reputation if they get enough reports, before they realize it is too late and they have to now work to be able to play online again if they go into the yellow, probably takes a lot of reports, but at the very least they won't see me on the map again ever since they blocked so there is that ..
---
Well, to be fair, he said:
---
&gt;...you can basically...somewhat customize and roll for the legendary that you want
---
Honestly, it sounded like he didn't really know.  I bet that's half of the issue.
---
Went back to grafton steel to see what was going on... I found that you don’t even need to claim the workshop - just repair the helipad. And, you have to get real close to it, almost to the edge of the helipad, for it to register.
---
Headed to whitespring to get most of the others, to vault 76 for a liberator (box is small on these, too), then back to my camp for a turret - challenge complete! Took about 30 minutes, most of which were dealing with the supermutants at grafton steel.
---
Oops I shouldve clarified that I only have a PC, thanks though!
---
Any idea what location that terminal is in? Dont think I saw that one
---
Sounds like hot garbage.
---
Any perks involved? Aside from adrenaline?
---
Thanks for your response!
---
pro tip:
---
Just scroll on by....
---
&gt; Rewards will also be a cap or atom reward.
---
Damn, you should have made this a bit more believable. You know Bethesda would never give people a way of farming atoms
---
Good point, thanks!
---
Hi again, I will have to test this. I one shot L68 Mutants with my L25 1* Instigating even before Adrenaline kicks in so now I’m very curious to see if an IE is less effective for some reason.
---
Damage glitch only exists with an automatic tesla gun. Not sure about the lever, are you running the same mods? Damage drop-off outside of range is pretty significant in this game.
---
All they have to do is yank the mod from Fallout 4
---
That was the giveaway. The rest of the dumb ideas I can believe could come from the Fallout 76 team. But not giving away their atoms.
---
I'm wondering if the explosive AOE is hitting first, then the round isn't doing instigating damage
---
I really miss my greenhouse from Fallout 4!
---
Fake.
---
Exact same build and mods.
---
Interesting theory. If so, another reason to be anti-Explosive!!
---
Me too. I'm actually inside the architecture of a building and can't plant or sink a water pump
---
Technically it means there is an endless amount of possible games if they will continue naming them after the place you come from. Consider something like FNV - Fallout Goodsprings, or Fallout Doc Mitchell's House. They could remaster the original in the modern engine and call it Fallout 13!
---
Ooooooh...interesting.
---
I really like what someone else said about Nuclear Winter being the 'consequence' of dropping another nuke. This would change the world, be reactive to what players have been doing, and would push the story a little further along while also bringing in new gameplay features.
---
Make sure you leave teddy bears in weird places. In 200 years people need to find these things.
---
That, and giving the name of a supposed leaker. It could be a joke name but if it is then I don't get the hidden meaning
---
Yes, is an actual bug. I have the same problem. Have 2 Teslas (AA and TS) and both do the same dmg.
---
I've never seen so many people fall for an awful shitpost like this. Come on guys &gt;.&gt; Even sadder than the idiot who wasted 15mins to type this out
---
&gt; as an enclave soldier if you don't harm any pedestrians
---
Didn't help either.
---
It would be this guy [https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-korn-0058131](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-korn-0058131)
---
Was easy to google so I expect that's where he got name from.
---
Not sure if they have done it but they were nerfing explosive. Instead of double damage it was only going to do +20%. I believe they did it in patch 8.5
---
Not really sure then. Could be something lag-related causing the explosion to screw it up. I know for example that two-shot does not display properly on the rocket launcher; it adds 1 additional point of damage to the pip boy damage counter, but seems to work fine in game. Same with the bunker buster (+20% damage). Maybe the game treats all explosive weapons as two instances of damage, one being a 0dmg or 1dmg "impact" explosion and the other the actual explosion that deals the specified damage
---
I know there was that communist scumbag Jimmy that tried to get his father and other miners to go on strike! But he was just for communist detection purposes in Camp McClintlock.
---
&gt;It seems like everyone has missed the point of what I’m asking.
---
They missed the point because that's not how you phrased it. Even in your initial post you implied that you expected boredom from the game. The game has had plenty of changes and updates since you last played, that's why I'm telling you to log in and see it for yourself. All of us on this sub think the game is worth playing, and there are far, far too many post-launch changes to list. If you honestly expect someone to sit here for hours digging through patch notes, and typing it all up *for* you... I don't know what to say, and if you wanted just a basic overview of more recent stuff, there's always the [content roadmap](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019), easily found by googling "Fallout 76 content." 
---
Anyway, I return to my original point: if you think there's even a small chance that you'll enjoy the game again, *log in and play it*. Knowing that they added some extra content further into the game won't change how fun you find the basic gameplay.
---
Yeah. 400+ hours in game and never seen the alien, let alone grab a selfie with it (for a 20 whole atoms). I spent 20 U.S. Dollars on atoms last week because I had to have the killer "War Rider" skin. I am lovin' that thing. 
---
\*Truth though, through the total, weekly and daily challenges Bethesda is achieving their objective! (at least in my ca$e!)
---
I do wish they would rotate the staff who makes these challenges.
---
Don't pass on false info. That's with shotguns only.
---
Dude I'm level 129 I've been playing since beta but stopped playing for a while and I Never encountered the flatwoods monster
---
I love this idea !  If I’m remembering correctly ESO has a similar system of spending coin to upgrade your storage.  Upgrading the work bench and having your relevant (unlocked) perks apply passively would be amazing.   Switching crafting and repairing perks several times a day is getting really tedious.
---
I see dead game because of poor mtx decisions, slow development and lack of end game content, but will see
---
I'd rather see the OP "meta" PVP build stuff removed, I don't think it was implementated with a full PVP mode in mind.
---
Explosive weapons, as near as I can tell don't do good damage at all on direct hits. You have to get them with the splash damage for them to be effective. It's way explosive shotguns work so good compares to a precision weapon like the lever action.
---
I thought about this a couple of months ago. Then went looking to see if there was a way to do it and sadly no 😞. Too bad. Definitely needs to be a thing!
---
I've seen like 5 in 900+ hours, it's just part of a daily challenge today and I'm tired of server hopping and checking spawn points
---
I’ve been curious about this; does this mean that Bethesda can’t remaster NV? I have no clue about the legalities of something like this.
---
Thanks for the heads up
---
If it’s the consequence of dropping a new nuke, it could fit in well with the “new main quest line” promised in the wastelanders set of dlc. A new quest line in the new game mode. Maybe lock our characters to the nuclear winter game mode to give fallout 76 a fresh start and opportunity to balance legendary weapons and enemies .
---
I’ve killed him three times.  Never in Flatwoods though, always in the mountains around my base close to Spruce knob.
---
There are holes in the map. Seems you have discovered one.
---
I can see that, but to me the tape sounds a lot more indicative of the immediate aftermath of the Great War. A prequel of sorts would be a decent way to "introduce" human npcs and work out how to use them later on for Wastelanders which would hypothetically introduce them to the main game.
---
That's one of the few known spawns I haven't been checking today.  Guess I'll add it to the list, thanks!
---
Bethesda can do anything they want with New Vegas and never even shrug in Obsidian's direction. They own all rights to New Vegas, Obsidian has no say in the game at all, they made it on commission for Bethesda Softworks, so they have nothing to do with the game sale or support wise in anyway. They could remake New Vegas a hundred times over and Obsidian wouldn't get a word in edge wise
---
*Jingle Jangling intensifies *
---
I went from a bloodied lever to a BE lever and can guarantee the damage difference between the two is significant.
---
Wrong. its the mentality that you are seemingly agreeing with that is part of the problem.
---
Thanks, man, I’ve wondered about this
---
Oh, so basically show who these 'wastelanders' are before bringing them into the game?
---
Also, couldn't the vault dwellers fro 76 (us) be the Wastelanders? I mean, we've been in the wastes for a while.
---
Yeah no problem...... I always found him at night kinda roaming around. One time he was close enough to my base and he stopped all my missile turrets from firing. They were glowing kinda purple ish...... it was pretty cool
---
No because laser rifles are moderate speed moderate damage guns that don’t benefit from any armor piercing. Preferred bloody rifles are lever-action or handmade rifle.
---
Ok, I may have lost track as to what we were discussing. I got the BOS paint "mod"... not "plans" to make any combat armour.  I got those from the vendor in Watoga. I don't believe there is actual "BOS armour", just the BOS paint mod that increases all the stats and adds the BOS logo.  Of course I could be wrong?
---
I see no downside to this. There's already a quest reward, why not just change the loot tables?
---
Yeah he's a pretty cool enemy.  Can't wait to see more Zetans
---
On PC with PLM and only one DC all weekend. It may be a problem with your connection. It could be a system between you and the server that is causing your disconnect also. I have seen that with another game and a trace route showed where the problem was.
---
Sounds like somebody isn't happy with their customer service rep. And posted their name.
---
Yeah that’s what I’m thinking. My old stuff was super messy. Do you happen to know if non-power armor is viable? I’m not too big a fan of using power armor so I’d prefer not to if possible. Seems as though it’s required for nuke zones, unless there’s another way around it?
---
Nice! Can't think of such a weapon in better hands. It's gonna age well when the 3\* and 4\* starts dropping too. Have a blast with it! Post vids regularly!
---
According to the new Internet Historian video on YT, people were told the bags would take 3-6 months.
---
It's been 6 months lmao
---
True, but the songs were specifically licensed for use in it, this why they don't appear like the fo3 titles which were licensed in perpetuity for the series.
---
So what is the damage on other weapons?
---
Well, no idea.  Just repeating what I know.
---
I store mine except when I need it. Then I lay it down, use it, then store it again. That’s one thing I do not want to keep repairing.
---
Prime barrel fires far faster than the tri barrel for minigun. But miniguns buuuurn through ammo. That’s why the 50cal is the best one to Prime. Lose nothing, gain everything
---
I think this is only a problem on PC, as on the consoles you can gift other friends with gift cards that they can use?  
---
But keep in mind that Fo76 is coming to steam, which ***may*** make that stuff easier.  Probably depends if you can connect accounts, which you can in ESO if you buy the game twice. :/
---
Actually, it'd be more likely we'd see various NPCs who are dead from the base game, I more so meant that they'd figure out how to use human npcs in quests, etc, and then if human npcs were added to the base game in Wastelanders, they'd use what they've learned.
---
Also, sure, 76s inhabitants could be considered Wastelanders, but even the [promo image](http://i.imgur.com/ZSEFITU.jpg) for it on the road map has a non-vault dweller, as well as some kind of community.
---
Mr. Squeeze. A new addition added in with Nukashine. Idk of any lore before hand or currently that refers to him but Jimmy is a common name. I came across an entry Abbie or Ella made to Calvin so who knows.
---
PS4 xbox or pc
---
For anyone that is looking for info on nuke locations Riflegaming on YouTube has lots of videos dedicated to nuking new areas.
---
And before anyone jumps on me for promoting him, yes I know he used to advertise website that sell caps, and I also am aware that he cut the deal off with the website after learning of Bethesda’s terms and conditions against it. Just thought I’d come out ahead of the curb on that one since people still seem to hate him for some reason.
---
Anyway the content is a fun watch and he’s one of the only guys taking the time to test nuke spots. Check his Morgantown video for a ton of great info.
---
I hope to god. I preordered this game and played it up until December and haven’t touched it since until coming back literally today making a new character. I was disappointed to see that the game is basically the same as it was when I left.
---
I personally only trade an item for caps. That eliminates the possibility of being scammed.
---
And all they'd have to do would get a new license for the songs, or just remake the games without them. Which is a mote point, because Bethesda has made clear they have no intentions to ever remake their older games
---
I cam back as well and I'm having a lot of fun with it. It's not perfect, but it's actually stable and runs correctly.
---
Could we just get every song from Fallouts 3, 4 and New Vegas? And a DJ?
---
Sometimes it is, watching them run as you follow them for the inevitable end. No offence.
---
Bullet shield is worthless. I’d dump that and grab ordinance express if you want to use explosive launchers or grenades and mines. HW/PA builds make great bloodied builds thanks to innate PA resistances and the Emergency Protocols torso mod; you aren’t quite as tanky as you might be looking for but you’re still damn tough and do insane damage.
---
I love camp builds that utilize existing structures!
---
I think they have a narrowing time window of a few months (basically their 100 day roadmap) to really show off some big new content drops. If they disappoint with Nuclear Winter and the new main quest then I would agree that they'll lose a lot of the remaining player base due to boredom, but fingers crossed that won't be the case!
---
I have had it with battle royale games!
---
Tbh its not so much loot, but perk loadout
---
I got an email last week saying I needed to confirm my address bcs I entered it wrong and they were preparing to ship
---
Pass.
---
It is a really poorly thought out game mode. Good concept, horribly executed. I personally thought it was a PR move on Bethesda. Like... They had a guy change a few numbers in the code for maybe an hour and act like it is a new way to experience the game.
---
And Todd's idea to look into having "Seasons" for survival mode.... Doesn't sound like it'll get much better.
---
I, too, love the concept. But I don't think BGS is going to do anything good with it :(
---
I believe you can rename your armor now. That's what I've done to keep track of what I'm going to use where.
---
Maybe next time read the post instead of jumping on the bandwagon like the sheep you are.
---
If you read closely you’ll see that I’m never defending spawn campers, I’m merely stating the simple fact that with the new spawn invulnerability, spawn campers are at the disadvantage.
---
But you keep being a sheep.
---
big iron doesn't fit with the region, but uranium fever does.
---
oo Charleston sounds interesting might have to try that
---
I'd be happy if Whitespring had no music anymore. They need to change that up asap.
---
I think the next installment will take place in U.S. annexed Canada, and it will be called “Falloot A?”
---
Honestly though, I would be pretty stoked if they did an installment in NC/SC, called it “Fallout: New Carolina”, and takes place around 2350
---
Idk why but the game just is overall blurry a lot and most of the time there’s a constant strobe light effect from the shaders in the foreground and background. Kinda dizzying and hard to look at which makes it difficult to play for long.
---
For most gun builds unyielding isn't really that strong or important. Assassins sent is still gonna be meta because you can't totally penetrate the armor or legendary effects and any reduction in damage is better than none. Besides, if pen negates armor effects, it'd negate the stat bonuses too.
---
I don't think so.  The only possible way for you to get in trouble is if you get reported for some reason, but even that might not since people only get banned for doing things that hurt others' experience in the game (like modding, hacking, getting free stuff from the developer room).
---
In your level range I’d suggest the ash heap or the savage divide. I’d expect the mire and the bog to be a bit too tough for you. Ash heap Enemies I think top out at 30ish; divide goes to max level but usually they aren’t anywhere close to that.
---
My first play through I never felt like I was grinding; I don’t know what I did but I really felt like I followed the natural progression, I was ready to launch a nuke very shortly after hitting 50 (as in I finished all the quests right then).
---
I'm down with the CTF and factions stuff. Battle Royale is on its way out but whatever keeps the game afloat.
---
Regular cop uniforms count for the challenge! And there’s always a spawn of the cop uniform at Morgantown airport in the north west, in that... weirdly half-cylinder trailer building?
---
I keep hearing TSE this, sentinel that, when in truth the Fo4 gameplay just doesn't lend itself well to pvp.
---
yes, legendaries do give a lucky few a massive edge over everyone else. but the point is that you don't really ***need*** that edge.
---
people would be able to oneshot you with a regular shotgun, handmade or fist. you don't need to be fully stacked to pop a stealthboy and crit randoms.
---
all they need to do is make it so if you want to play survival you would need to create a new survival only character that way everyone starts on a even playing field
---
Highly unlikely TBH
---
very nice!
---
Yep. I feel like moments like that sum up survival, well that and the random group of 5 people endlessly spawn killing each other at a train stop.
---
Thank you.
---
Find me another thread in the past 2 days that has the same topic as mine...
---
Yes. Machine is this Tuesday, the vendor was scheduled for the 23rd, but some have been claiming we'll get it a week early. Either way, they aren't releasing at the same time.
---
Fay and Gake.
---
I HATE the idea of seasons and would like them to direct their attention elsewhere. I'm all for Survival+ servers that are harder and require people to make new characters
---
PVP is so broken it's not even funny.  Winning at PVP should be based on the skill of the player, not what over powered weapon and armor they bought on a trading page for 100,000 caps.  Perk cards do play into it, but these weapons and armor are ridiculous.  It's one thing to have such things for co-op play, but entirely another thing for PVP.  It's not fun.  It's a type of cheating that the game allows.  It takes zero skill to win at FO76 PVP.
---
If you drop the nuke so that it touches Arktos Pharma you'll get a lot of green ghouls there since the building is open-air, then run from there to Mama Dulce's for tons of cobalt.
---
yup , I barely log on anymore went from like a everynight kinda thing till level 300 now ....there is zilch to do... I was really hyped for the dungeon but that was more just a new area to kill ghouls and nuke , not really a dungeon ...so I resort to farming 3 star spawn locations , and trying to track down the few remaining crafting plans I am missing....do a few events only for a chance of getting one of the rare outfits...and thats pretty much it....
---
I've been doing it alot more. Too many camps blocking my Charleston Vendor farm.
---
Sheeowlpsquach
---
I saw one when I was level 5
---
Yeah. People got real angry at the idea of it. When the reality came around... dead silence. Why? Because it isn’t anything. Didn’t break the game, didn’t become p2w, it’s just convenience for lazy people. Zero actual advantage. So once the chicken littles ran out of breath from screaming so much, everyone kind of looked around, went “huh, it doesn’t matter at all, does it?” And moved on.
---
Exactly this, I get 90% of my kills without the other person even knowing I’m there, my full sentinel assassin isn’t doing much there is it. And with the right build it doesn’t matter if you’ve got god rolls or not, or if they have god roll armor, you can down anyone quickly, just have to know what you’re doing.
---
That could essentially be the same as seasons. It wouldn't just apply to Adventure but also survival. Make a new character for the game mode and it's deleted afterwards lmao.
---
I have to say. Killing is very fun lol.
---
Jesus Christ. Stop talking about BE weapons.
---
I said the same thing but made sure to point out was abusing exploits. Downvoted to hell and called and asshole.
---
Yep and in all those deleted comments I said the same and pointed out its abusing exploits. Downvoted to hell and the only replies called me an asshole. Pathetic ass community is my only regret about buying this game.
---
Hope your alright. Nebraska just got hit by a smaller tornado (Lincoln area), and the ice cream shop like 10 or 12 miles away is just gone. The chicken shop across the street is practically gone with it, and it was am experience I hope I never see again. A valuable one I guess, but not one I hope that repeats.
---
Exactly. You simply need to think tactically. You can't treat other players like any other enemy. I see alot of people just running in blindly shooting and then complaining that they get shot down by "TSE wielding duped armor griefers."
---
These people obviously have no clue about how to spec for PvP, or that TSE weapons are NOT top tier and haven't been for a good while. 
---
You absolutely NEED dense modded chest and fireproof for PvP. If you don't have those things, don't PvP. And if you're going in without these things, you have zero right to complain, because you lack the knowledge of what you're talking about.
---
Poison. And yeah, there’s very few sources of poison resistance (it’s a second tier legendary effect, so you’re only going to find it in at least 2star legendary armors.
---
It’s the biggest hazard to my bloodied power armor build, since I can’t get any poison resistance. 5hp/sec really hurts when I have no resistance to it and about 40 health.
---
Exact.
---
Unless I'm mistaken, Lewis got a taste of Quantum by being a taste-tester at the cola plant and recreated it from memory.
---
Especially when they don’t now you’re there
---
Did you ever double-check this? Because I'm trying to see if anyone has ever actually found it and can prove so.
---
ok...uhm waffles get soggy in rain!!
---
The one's in lewisberg are so beautiful, the glasshouses too
---
Hard to get materials at that.   Looking forward to Tuesday.  I keep mine indoors and enemies never go inside my base.
---
I was able to get the responder picture done thanks though.
---
Oh I saw your post and joined to your world for help. :)
---
It’s not about killing blows though; as long as you both do a bit of damage, you both get credit.
---
Problem is if you’re a sneaky sniper type, well, those are usually 1shot 1kills, so not much kill sharing there.
---
Accidentally gave away my second best shotgun today (not my TSE thank Todd), just gotta remind yourself it's just a game.
---
Oh I was able to get it done, do you need it?
---
There is a text chat mod that works like an official one. Seriously its too good. O lot of people uses it.
---
That's where games like CoD and such come in. This is an RPG and your progress and build should matter in every aspect. ESPECIALLY PvP.
---
Weapons ? How about the immune players who after you attack them, their health drops only to 25% and never die ?  I sat there repeatedly attacking and their health wouldn’t budge. Then one swipe and I’m dead. 
---
Shit like that turns people off to PvP.
---
Yeah exactly. I almost died fighting the SBQ because of one of these stingy boys. It's ridiculous how basically any creature that inflicts poison dmg is more dangerous than the SBQ.
---
Some walls get glitched into others lately, without saying it would intersect. This guy clearly uses "totally harmless" camp building exploits.
---
And yes repeating glitches intentionally, whether providing a drastic gameplay advantage is exploiting.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/66luzJA](https://imgur.com/a/66luzJA) how did this person get so many floating foundations?
---
It's a grind to get your rifles up to that level, and your giving up other perks doing so
---
That's a band aid and not a long term fix,  if certain types of builds are still possible and certain types of gear continue to drop.  And if the ability to dupe is not completely eliminated.  I  am not entirely sure that duping has been completely eradicated.  I think it is, but they need to be absolutely sure or having people start new characters won't make any difference long term.
---
The original Fasnacht Mask was ingame before the event, I’m pretty sure
---
Here's my camp! https://v.redd.it/981ns1gp8iw21
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fasnacht_Man_mask
---
If it was this one, it normally spawns in a few places around the map. If you’re on PC and you want one of the masks, I have a lot of all of them.
---
that mask will always be there, it was in the base game. all the other masks are now unobtainable from events.
---
Also, FYI, the armor-type mods all seem to work, but most of the variety-type mods don’t. Ultralight does, but that was about the only one I found to work, I didn’t try them all though.
---
i think he was the one who left the best review in the nuka cola plant for their taste testing rooms
---
Is it this one you found? 
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fasnacht\_Man\_mask](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fasnacht_Man_mask) 
---
If that is the case it has been in since launch. The other Fasnacht masks were added by the Fasnacht DLC in the Wild Appalchia add-on.
---
And why the mirelurk queens are such a massive threat. That freaking “acid” they spew is a poison attack. They are always first priority for me if I see them. Fortunately as a bloodied PA build I have the firepower to drop them in about 5 seconds, but still.
---
Jesus, "enemies". What has the world come to?
---
But ay thats a good tip
---
What do you mean about the rad shower? I dont have one unlocked so I'm just wondering why you would need to put it in storage
---
I delete comments, and you get free reign over what I said....
---
Since when are other people able to speak for other people?
---
this is an exploit thread through and through....nice slander attempts though.
---
You can just click the quest on the map and untrack and  it will stay hidden for the rest of that session
---
Number 4 I like (although it means more investment for crafting) as well as number 5, I don't use PA often but it's annoying when I do.
---
Congratulations!
---
Help me please I need so much help help help help
---
exploits = asshole
---
id love it if it had snap zones for the metal lettering on it so you can make it have custom sayings on it
---
** in weird places and akward positions.
---
Lol I have no idea how those are spelt
---
Random. Be aware that the non armor-type mods are pretty buggy- most can’t be applied. Ultralight is the only one that I know actually works.
---
Not from when that was said
---
Success in PVP seems entirely gear dependent, which makes me not want to bother with it.  But the game's overall focus seems to have shifted to PVP because people have run out of stuff to do.   I know what needs to be done to make a build that is viable for PVP, but frankly, doing it is not my idea of fun. 
---
  
---
Getting good gear requires grinding that I am not willing to do because I don't find it fun.  So more and more I find myself just playing other games that I set aside when this game dropped.
---
Red Dead Redemption (single player mode) is one of them, and I just finished it today.  Spider man game is next.
---
uhhhhh
---
ok
---
Oh yeah
---
I went to that location possible a dozen times and I never knew there was a Overseer's holotape there.
---
Problem is that nuking a place doesn't actually do anything other then change ghouls to glowing ones and flora to flux.
---
No spawns are altered and no new enemies are generated.
---
So nuking is kinda pointless anywhere else then whitesprings or prime
---
I kind of have a bloodied PA as well. What weapons do you use?
---
I was looking on the Fallout wikis before I wrote this, wondering if I missed something. The only holotape/notes I could find were Lewis talking about needing to get a warehouse to store his stuff, and even his own recipe for Nukashine requires an actual bottle of Nuka Cola Quantum.

Funny that I was talking about exploits and delete comments because getting messages being called an asshole is actually toxic and harassing and annoying and I would rather not listen to it. Telling me how raped they were over something I didn't even say. What the fuck is wrong with this place?

No, I completed already, I just came to help you.

Its lik a throwing knife but with poison
---
Sometimes he likes to spawn at my camp, a bit below the crashed plane in the Mire, but never when there’s a challenge that requires him :|
---
Remind me what that note says?
---
I see thanks
---
its like a throwing knife but it does poison damage
---
Lol yea that's one of the spawn points I've hit probably 30 times today
---
FYI you can kill assassin sentinel guys with vats crits to the dome.
---
Just get the damage reduction perks like lone wanderer, supressor, blocker or dodge and you are good.
---
Would love this! So many lost SBQ bodies and Imposter Sheepsquash bodies.

Every time the game updates it breaks everything so I'm not using mods.

Anytime :)

My dude, sometimes just playing the game is enough. There’s a lot of fallout history buffs, and I get that it’s neat to keep a linear progression of events, but sometimes it’s good to remember it’s a game.

**ONE WORD OF ADVICE**: Don't do as I did and drop your camera after the quest! If you do ..... you loose it forever. There are NO other Broken ProSnap DELUXE cameras in the game world as of yet (needed to make a 'new' camera). Bethesda are aware of this and looking into it. They were going to patch this in Patch 9 but looking unlikely now. There are broken ProSnap cameras in the game world (not the DELUXE version) and broken cameras but they cannot be used to make a new camera.
---
Hope this helps in some way :)

He just meant he never got the trophy for leaving the vault.

It is, and one I've been playing since the series came out. I can still enjoy the game and be frustrated at something, no?
---
Just because it "requires" doesn't mean you can't make it without it. Thus the experimentations and the different ones.... plus...... reasons.... I mean everything else in the quest.
---
[deleted]
---
Only... if you want to be.
---
No. (Sarcasm just in case no body could tell)

lmao you right. I truly don't think it is coming.

This is way too complicated to be something Bethesda would do. They do Ultra Simple. Period. Fake.

Should have been to areas of lousiana after hurricane Katrina. Hell, how everything looks a few days before a hurricane is surreal. Most people have boarded up the house and packed and left. It's just empty and the sky has the red hue. It looks like the world is gonna end. Its something about being in the middle of what's supposed to be civilization and its empty that's absolutely chilling.
---
Remember. It isn't PvE it's Adventure. PvP will still, and always has been intended to be a part of adventure mode.
---
Easy to fix most of the issues with pvp, just remove legendaries effects from weapons except assassins. The reason pvp isn't fun is due to insane buffs from legendaries that are meant to deal with overpowered bullet sponge enemies.
---
Waiting for the comment that fluffes a YouTuber for being lore god.
---
Jk f that live it in your own words and use the power of imagination
---
Berserker is really difficult to make viable right now. While adding any amount of resistance (ballistics/energy) will start lowering it's damage, I suspect that % damage reduction might not affect it. Try experimenting with Lone Wanderer and Dodgy, they might not affect the damage. If it turns out to be true, perhaps getting a set of lv1 Sentinal armor would be best to pair with. While it is in no way viable for PvP, it might be fun for PvE.
---
Pics or it didn't happen 🤣
---
Have you tried server hoping ?
---
Some servers seem to be more unstable then others , I’ve experienced high lags before and sometimes a hard reset would help the situation

REDACT YOUR FRIENDS NAME YOU FOOOOOLLLLLLL

I've got a lot of hours in this game, not as many as the die hard people but this is the plain and simple truth.
---
Ay mang, all I'm saying is the Internet Historian 76 video opened up my eyes to all the fucking hypocrisy and terrible shit they have done to consumers.  I bought this game for $15 on ebay a few months ago after getting bored with fo4.  I am a late bloomer to getting into games at 35 years old. 
---
So anyways...if it weren't for the decent, nice people Ive met through this game (and play with) I would've stopped long ago.  Will never give this shitshow a dime of my hard-earned money -- but WILL play the game I already bought until I'm ready to stop.

Bloody 50cal for big boys or hordes of fast moving ghouls. It’s just a 1star, I’d love to upgrade it to a bloody explosive version. I have a loooooot of legendaries saved for the legendary vendor.
---
My daily carry is a Instigating 25% fire rate gatling gun. Super ammo and repair efficient, very accurate, and it 1shots a lot of enemies. 
---
I’ve got a vampire’s LMG for health recovery vs the imposter, and a bloody autogrenade launcher, plus 2shot missile and mininuke launchers. Plus a few other mess-around weapons, some bloody melee weapons, a pistol with a recon scope, at least a few of every explosive in the game, you know, fun stuff.
---
What the duck ?
---
This would make me go to the bottom of a river and unload my 800 lbs of god tier stuff down the crapper

No if every other exploding gets nerfed so do shotguns

Huh, I’ll have to investigate

New Vegas was the best Fallout of all.  Although Fallout 1 was epic—especially for its time.
---
Yeah, it unlocks. It just takes a metric fuckton of armor pieces to unlock the last few mods of pretty much any armor due to the way the “learn” system works. So if buttressed is your last mod... yeah, be prepared to scrap 50-150 pieces to learn it.
---
As I understand, they are removing camp damage from players. You’d still need to defend from monsters.
---
Until they do add it use the Text Chat and SFE mod. People call out events, Free range, SBQ, and friendly chat.
---
The Chat mod is how I found the camera. People can be very helpful if you give them a chance. Microphone is ok for local chat, but we need a global text chat, so we can find events, hard to find stuff, like the camera, lemonade stand, etc.

I have a 1 star vampire submachine gun ( tommy gun ) and with a massive rate of fire the healing its almost as fast as a stimpack as long as you’re landing the shots

No need to get nothing crazy since having this a sub would eliminate ( if done properly ) the need to have stimpacks
---
Outside of legendary armors in that range, I think combat armor is going to be your best in that level range...but if you're avoiding power armor you'll also want to make sure you pick up the right matching Perks.

Someone made me BOS deep pocketed combat armor at both 20 and 30.  Its by far the best non-legendary armor I've seen.

I played the BETA and the first two weeks on PS4. I set time off from work to play during that time, and by the end of it my PS4 pro was near it's breaking point (gpu nearly fried). I had a backup pc copy, so I've been playing on PC since (runs much better).

I need cobalt flux. I really like it when some one nukes Morgan town cause it has a ton. It is hard to get it in white springs (which seems to be all yellowcake) or the big area.

---
Next Atom challenge will be doing a challenge on another Bethesda game so you have to own multiple games lol.
---
But it's *not* an RPG.  Certainly not in the traditional sense.  This game can't decide *what* it wants to be.  So, if they really want PVP they need to balance things in survival.  It doesn't encourage new players or really anyone but those who have to go outside of the actual game to buy O.P. legendary weapons and armor.  Those are the only people consistantly winning at PVP.  If you have to go outside of the game to win, the game is broken.

This is actually a rather bad idea. They should be focusing on fixing the issues we currently have that cause us to not be able to loot like we should. We already have enough problems with event loot and the major inconsistencies we have to deal with.
---
Makes sense. If you could find a simpler case then we could probably prove it. You'd need to find an enemy against which you deal near-fatal (or otherwise accurately measurable) damage with a non-stealth body shot, no adrenaline, no Tank Killer and no Demo Expert. Maybe tweak damage perks until you find an ideal setup. I'd need to know your paper damage.
---
Look now, the post has been removed. Too many upvotes?
---
I traded with a guy once who had a full set of lvl 5 Assassin’s/sentinel leather armor and a berserker/explosive/+250 dr handmade and he said that in most PvE applications he was good lol.  
---
Dude went deep on it.
---
That's pretty disingenuous. If you order a thing it's not unreasonable to expect you get that thing.
---
The concept of preorders doesn't "drive up prices for the rest of us". These things usually cost more than the standard game for that exact reason.
---
I did not preorder so it's not something I'm invested in but your comment is pretty weak reasoning all around.
---
This is a problem with a LOT more than just beta characters. This is a general issue with challenges and they are supposed to be putting a fix in for this sometime soon.
---
I should bring the family and kids next time 😂
---
They’re called Nuka Grenades.
---
Same for me. Sucks so bad.
---
there's a little purple flower on the map near Whitesprings and the Top of the World, I had my camp there for the longest time, there's a pond with 3 brahmin in it. The brahmin re spawn every time you go there so it's good for milk/meat farming too.
---
Yep
---
How about the fact that you can see the tags on dead bodies in the viewfinder?
---
but it *is* dependent on skill. you don't *need* top gear to win at pvp, someone with a 1\* handmade, or even just a regular one, a fist and a healthy supply of stealthboys can take on any TSE sentinel.
---
Never going to happen new copy of game $30,

Playing with any effort at all 6000 atoms in one week. Person gifts all the stuff. If you push it closer to 10k atoms in one week with someone towing you.
---
To do a berserkers build. You want to ether lvl 5 sentinel armor or lvl 5 unyielding armor. Depending on your build. Other perks like dodger ricochete serendipity nerd rage, lone wander. The idea it to have damage reduction perks but not stat boosters.
---
The easy route for mid-level armor is to make your own heavy leather. The plans are widely available at Responder vendors and aren't expensive. You can easily acquire most of the mods by crafting and scrapping a big pile of level 1 light arms, and the non-scrap mods are relatively common drops.
---
Combat armor may also be an option for self-crafting as the plans spawn at vendors (heavy plans may be unreliable), but it's far more difficult to unlock the mods. Main advantage is that it has much higher condition. The ballistic resistance isn't much different from leather.
---
Ideally find a couple of heavy metal pieces and throw those in for improved ballistic resistance, but the heavy plans are rare. You can craft light metal arms to unlock metal armor mods, but they cost two screws apiece.
---
if you have the skill, you can literally top the leaderboards with a regular handmade and a power fist.
---
Ahh! Yup thats the one. LOL oh Well.
---
I haven't played this in months. Worst 60 bucks I ever spent

i think i can make combat armour.  but you can make a lot of armour work with fix it good, making the durability 200%.  if you're on PC i can make some armour.
---
But it's so loud and boomy
---
Course it does 😑😑
---
I think its under floor decor. Try closing fo76 down then load up. Sometimes purchases don't register until you do that.
---
Try "toggle buildable" while you're searching through your items in build mode. I'm not sure if it'll work, but that's how I get my shop items to appear when they're not showing up.

120 days or so
---
I am on PC. What would you need from me as far as caps and resources to make armor?

yeah, even when you make yourself invisible the camera is still tied to the same position as if you were in the center. that's why you'll get the "not enough room" message occasionally.
---
I think you’re under estimating what others want to do, which must be the death match style you dislike (and I avoid). Every time I’m in survival it’s constant, people killing each other. 
---
It’s not my ideal “survival” setting, but it appears it’s something others want or they wouldn’t keep chasing each other down. 
---
I think there needs to be some more pvp events (that are _Super_ _Simple_ to understand) introduced to give it more structure. Maybe that’ll come with fractions and they just letting people go hard for a while.
---
Do you know of a noob guide for understanding armor? I’m having a hard time wrapping my head around how armor and crafting works in this game.
---
Damn, I mean it's only been a few hours since lunch, I wouldn't have thought those folks would be bored of it yet
---
There is a reason a high lvl player like my self fears a lower lvl aria like the forest 
---
You go in and you can bet your sell your gona get all kindes of infections from them rats and bugs
---
And maybe wallpaper ;)
---
Yeah it's ridiculous. Last time I played survival I was dropping people left and right in an actual firefight (which was a lot of fun), and then came the invincible guy. I had to have put maybe ten or more 5.56 rounds into his head and he took no damage, then just killed me.
---
Its random. I farmed West Tek from 40 to 294. Sometimes 0 Legendaries, once, 5 3* and hella 2*and 1*. It happens
---
Trade completed. Thank you for your purchase. Enjoy the mutations!
---
&gt; One of my teammates got super pissed and tried to get some revenge with her bloodied unarmed build and some stealthboys,
---
&gt;but these guys were geared up with sentinel armor.
---
&gt;She had no chance.
---
but that's exactly how you deal with sentinels. you should've stayed and gotten their attention, with a build like that she might've been able to clean every single one of them.
---
I progressed through the game very slowly. Some of my challenges like "Discover Harper's Ferry" are not checked off. Although I bought the game on launch day, I did not get to the Mire until probably late December.
---
Maybe don't sit around all day for 6 months and play it? You guys have an INSANE amount of hours played. No content is unlimited. Your fault. Not the developer.
---
Nope.  Just learned from making friends in the game who knew more than I did. 
---
I'm only lvl 43 BTW. :). But I've gotten HUGE compliments and questions from EVERY player I have played with asking "what's a level 20 player doing with BOS armor?"
---
💗💗💗💗💗 ur a fucking hero cheers
---
They'll just rename this game when they reach the real 76. My Recommendation for the rename is Fallout: Last Words, considering nearly all the dialog is recordings of well... You get the idea.
---
On PC here too, can craft pretty much everything. Most highlevels won’t need resources :)
---
I gave away most of the ~L30 legendary armors i had a week or so ago to a trio of folks i found playing together, so i can’t hook you up with legendaries, but I’d probably make you some marine armor. Slightly less physical armor and moderately less energy armor, but much better radiation resistance than Combat, which has zero radiation resistance.
---
I thought it was just me. The wiki said trying to listen to all of them at once in order, and doing that as well as other things still did not finish it for me. I just stopped tracking it and accepted having all the logs in my inv forever
---
Its a pretty terrible game for expecting tutorials or how-tos.  Which annoys me endlessly.
---
let me login.  IGN panoflex.
---
West Tek is a fickle bitch. Ran it Friday, 6 legendaries, 2 three stars and walked out with an explosive Gatling gun. Ran it yesterday, nothing. I basically live at West Tek, sometimes you just get skunked.
---
It’s not even that creative, unfortunately. I’ve had this happen a few months back. It’s exploiting holes in the pvp design in order to trick people, which I’d say qualifies as griefing. They usually have someone who exits the event and tries to bait anyone not in pacifist mode.
---
But for reals, if you play alone I suggest scrapping every single piece of armor you can to get mods from them and build your own.  Wait til level 40-50+ for any legendary armor.
---
Its how I normally find a good server, if you get a legendary outside then inside is worth checking. 
---
Yesterday I had 2 *** &amp; a 0* outside &amp; none inside. Then jumped to Whitestone &amp; had 3***
---
Now if only they dropped good loot
---
Me too. Bought it in B.E.T.A., along with my brother and best friend. All of us stopped playing by Christmas. I recently picked it back up again, and it's basically the same. 
---
I will say I don't get the regular loading screen crashes that I used to get, but it's still pretty buggy, and I honestly don't think it will ever be the game I wanted it to be or a game I enjoy for long stretches. It is what it is, and Bethesda already has our money, so we move on. 
---
I understand both people asking the question and people getting tired of the constant asking, because I think the answers won't ever change.
---
If the narrative integration and lack of NPCs or traditional RPG elements we're part of your problem, those won't ever be "fixed." It isn't now and won't ever be that thing. 
---
If it's general bugs, balance, and lack of content,  those will continue to get incrementally better for as long as the game lasts.
---
Butcher’s bounty doesn’t work on any pile- meat, ash, or plasma. One more (somewhat)significant drawback to energy weapons.
---
Raider-esque events would be the best way to do it tbh
---
add me, panoflex.  it shouldn't cost you anything.
---
I ran my mule up to Grafton Dam-  nope no credit  
---
I was able to unlock a whole lot of recipes that I had already learned by the end of the b.e.t.a. so that is almost done  
---
but a little less than a month ago- I spent 20 minutes killing a Legendary Deathclaw on my main to not have it register- needless I was not happy, especially given that it was a 3\* and I got a 1\* crap armor piece.
---
No it won’t, it’s been happening for battlefront 2 for ever, but battlefront 2 just recently started getting good and I’d definitely recommend it. People who do this need to play the game themselves, scroll past, if they don’t bother they don’t deserve the game.
---
Doubt it, outside of a player reporting it. The fast travel point for my old base was inside a rock against a cliff, I had fun with it when someone came chasing my bounty after i accidentally hit a structure during a defense of someone else’s workshop ;)
---
Well, once you get into the business of balancing things for PvE and PvP at the same time, you're basically fucked. Bungie is *barely* managing with Destiny, and they're some of the best shooter designers working today. 
---
I'm fine with the broken, unbalanced whackadoodle of 76's PvP, I just want some more enticing window dressing.
---
You’ll only get your money’s worth if you play until your eyes bleed. You there yet?
---
I wholeheartedly agree with this. It breaks my heart when my friends say they can't afford something in the Atomic Shop that they're really excited about and I know I can't help them purchase it.
---
This. Or at least thats been the case in the past, IDK if its been changed since then.
---
\&gt;   I doubt it’s fun for the one doing the killing. 
---
Oh, no. It's fun for them... until you run out of caps.
---
You could just walk away.
---
The new dungeon is called the burrows, it's accessed through a manhole cover in Harper's ferry and has an associated quest. 
---
Brewing is cool, you do a quest to learn the station plans, and there's a daily quest to learn new alcohol recipes. For example one is called ballistic Bock and increases ballistic damage by x%. (I don't remember how much exactly)
---
There's a quest for a new camera, it's hell to find because it's a random spawn, you need to find a tourist corpse. But the camera is cool. People show up on here every once in a while to let people know they've found the tourist.
---
All vendors now share a pool of 1400 caps instead of 7 factions with 200 each, and a bunch of new vendors have been added to the whitesprings basement. For example one sells all the excavator armour mod plans.
---
Thenew cryptid is called the sheepsquatch, it has an associated questline to find it, and 2 repeatable associated events, "Encryptid" and "Free range".
---
I'll edit if I think of more, but some tips to make life easier-
---
Some events always spawn legendary creatures-
---
"Horde" events
---
"Awol armaments"
---
"One violent night"
---
"Uranium Fever" spawns 3
---
Also
---
"Free range"
---
"Encryptid"(both only available after previously mentioned quests, I believe)
---
Welcome back :)
---
Swing speed doesn’t work on auto melee weapons, unfortunately. Bloodied is insane of course, and furious works well too. Vampire is basically unlimited health as long as you can touch an enemy. Executioners wouldn’t be bad on scorchbeasts etc, but furious/bloody are better
---
I usually head to the radio array up the road after I clear west tek. I can usually get 1-2 more drops that way.
---
Popular.
---
PC
---
Very neat indeed
---
Yeah, for a post-apocalyptic world, it isn't very scary at all.
---
I've had it pop up twice at vendors, only purchased the one. But GODDAMN that clean space suit is the real beauty I want ... elusive beauty.
---
Im pretty sure that quest only requires you to install something on the roof of that building, going inside is just one way of going up there. If you have marsupial or a jetpack there is a metal fire escape around one of the sides you can jump on to get to the roof. Not exactly a solution, I know, but its a possible workaround.
---
She left behind a bunch of resources at her camp to get us started, and the camp is a good place to keep it safe for us and make it obvious where it is. It’s less about the camp itself and more about what it contains.
---
I asked a similar question when Blade Runner 2049 came out.
---
I made it inside wearing power armor. Not sure if that really did anything. I just tried again and again (on different servers) until I eventually got in.
---
Uh, why can't you add new things and still have the deathclaw be the strongest enemy? Consistency is not a bad thing. Wouldn't you get upset if vaultboy suddenly wasn't the Fallout mascot? If suddenly the vault suits were green instead of blue?
---
Most plastic sources have been dry for me lately
---
Mines underground... that’s literally the only way to play these days, hidden and blocked off
---
for me it's "Queen of the Hunt" that annoys me the most I think, as soon as I enter the mire on my second character it instantly triggers. On my main character: nothing. Not even if I open the terminal. I sent in a ticket about it and I got: have you tried re-installing? Also if you are on xbox or ps4 (I clearly stated I was on PC), perhaps you could do this or this ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Far out. I've got 5 points in Demolition Expert for my AAE Handmade and thought it was a good thing.

Guess I'll grind out another 10 levels to move them and upgrade other Perks.

You are correct, plenty of videos on this

Lol you're not the first.

Nothings scarier than a Colonel Gutsy. Those things do so much more damage than anything I've encountered.

Son you just ain't doin' it right

Then your opinion is just that garbage.  ✓
---
I just want to know, if I am going to be disconnected after 1 hour of playing the game. It got annoying when I owned 2-3 workshops then bam! Server disconnect. I would miss out on my junk and it felt like I was just wasting my time on the game.
---
i saw one to buy at a train station, think it was the one near ws, stupidly i didnt buy it as i thought 'broken' was useless.. doh
---
Buying a flamer off of the market place is normally cheap for decent ones and its RnG random number generator

If you dropped the armor in order to check its pieces then obv thatll happen, gotta place it

Typical hive-mind fad game player.

Bethesda will implement this feature to the game, but you can't use Atoms to those gifts that are earned by playing the game. They are going to allow gifting only if you have bought Atoms with real money.
---
plastic is why I quit shotgun I was on yet another litter pick up at the fair and vatbowl search when i realized i was spending waaaaay to much time pucking up trash in the fairgrounds, went to gauss rifle 2mm is lead and steel both far easier. dun.
---
Well, I’d say pick a weapon/playstyle and focus on it, at least for now. The game is a lot easier if you specialize in a combat type. All in on snipers, or automatic rifles, or heavy weapons (which generally also means power armor), or shotguns, or one of the 3 melee types. Pick one and focus on it, and an appropriate weapon that fits you style. For unarmed, the 3 gauntlets are all very strong. For 1h, its a choice between fast knives and medium swords. For 2h, its mostly about the big slow bastards- best is super sledge, but modded polehooks and sledgehammers are good too. Handmade is considered the best auto/semi-auto rifle, gauss or lever action the best sniper rifles, depending on preference. Heavy weapons have a ton of variety, but 50cal or gatling gun are the general best choices- gatling gun is slow, hard hitting, accurate, and efficient. 50cal is all about raw DPS with good damage and very fast fire rate, but poor accuracy and repair/ammo efficiency. 
---
Shotguns is usually pump or combat shotgun, but a good legendary effect on the double barrel isn’t bad.  They are definitely short range weapons though.
---
lol
---
Yupo its pretty good. Lived in Charleston SC When Hurricane Hugo it. 
---
You are 100% right, I have never seen a community come together like we did after Hugo.
---
I think this could be a really cool event, but I'm not sure about not warning all players, especially unaware lower-levels in the Mire. 
---
Maybe only give players who have gotten to that point in the quest line the ability to travel to the event, and have two separate notifications; one for us, letting us know there's been a horde detected, and one for anyone without that quest completed saying vaguely that there's a disturbance in the Mire and to evacuate if possible. One is a civilian warning and the other is a Responder/Brotherhood call to action. We still get notified, and low level players won't be caught completely off guard while having the option to stay and attempt to help if they'd like.
---
Besides the notification though, this all sounds amazing.
---
Which will big out and appear underground where nobody can loot it. But the basic idea isn't bad. Have the conclave drop a chest in with loot so it appears above ground.
---
Nope.
---
Yup. A proper low health build (especially adding in Unyielding armor and VATS) does like 200% more damage right off the bat, and with unyielding armor and vats perks, you can dump a crit headshot every other shot for whatever your crit bonus is. Add in sneak multipliers and I can knock off 3/4 of a scorchbeast’s health with my first shot with a 1star bloodied lever action and zero buffs.
---
Pastor clothing counts too!
---
Dude i got so many tips i dont eve need one anymore sorry
---
I can’t remember how but I had that issue and fixed it by editing the .ini file or something. Remind me tomorrow and I’ll take a look at the fix if you want
---
Nah you don't have to hold onto them, just find the sheepsquatch quest and continue on with it. :)
---
Theyre only used for crafting the three weapons that are possible drops from the sheepsquatch event free range, besides the skull it has no use yet, they seem to be slowly adding more cryptid stuff each week
---
posiden power plant in the ditch next to it. I spend most of my time farming fusion cores. there's almost always one in that ditch when I fast travel to posiden.
---
Bloodied has a higher damage cap than furious, and its always active (if you stay at or below 20% health). Furious is the best bosskilling legendary for non-bloodied builds. Bloodied builds... just always choose bloodied.
---
Was just there on xb1 and they were there. Has it been 20 hours since you looted there?
---
it's the same for alot of people let me guess it's mainly the ones in the mire?
---
You sure it wasn't just a regular Broken ProSnap camera? I haven't seen a single Broken ProSnap Deluxe camera? I know for a fact you get the regular ones in vendor lists. You ain't the first to say this to me though and I'll deffo keep an eye out and **I hope I am wrong** as I want that camera back lol :)
---
i miss queen of the hunt :(
---
Sometimes when I log in and keep getting the "We couldn't place your camp" message because someone else took my spot I just nuke the usurper's camp.
---
I know it's petty, but god damn does it ever feel cathartic.
---
The prices in this game vary a lot due to demands, some items dont even sell for caps only trades. So there will never be a long term “base value”
---
I mainly try to start the mire ones yes, but all of them except that one in the toxic valley are still broken as well
---
Why can’t I repair anything since the last patch?
---
They need to fix the fight itself first. Yesterday I launched two nukes, the first one flew outside of the map after the health regen and the second crashed me halfway through the fight, then I couldn’t get back into the server. These things shouldn’t be happening in a fully released game.
---
AFTER, and if they fix these issues they can tweak other areas.
---
thank you!
---
LOL very ingenious, unfortunately all the football lingo was a huge turn off for me. I really only read a portion of the way down and got mostly something something football from that text wall. lo.
---
Haha we all have prob done that mate
---
No problem :) have fun
---
May I ask why they’re bad in your opinion? I feel like being able to upgrade your workbenches would be neat, maybe not as far as op suggested, and I feel as if new legendary effects being added in aren’t a “bad” idea so long as they’re balanced correctly so if it’s just balancing being the issue it’d be on Bethesda’s end to iron that all out. It’s not as if op is suggesting something like “removes camps and have workshops be the only place you can build in” which would be bad since a ton of people enjoy building their camps. 
---
So it feels like maybe you just don’t particularly care for the ideas op suggested, so what would you change about them to make them better and why change them in that way?
---
My dumbest purchase was that i accedently pushed buy button instead of view on the lets play PA pain some months ago... Atoms streight into the sea..
---
Iirc achievements were disabled during the Beta. Then when the game itself was released, most achievements one already completed were awarded instantly, except for achievements to complete the first couple quests, such as to leave the vault.
---
That is a VERY popular spot for plastic as well as the near by High School. I'd recommend also looking into Watoga High School as well for plastic junk in the cafeteria.
---
Interesting, but "lucky" needs to go. Those kinds of stats ruin games. Anything that increases loot becomes mandatory and boring. It also turns players into leeches because they rather use a shitty loot increasing weapon than one that will deal damage.
---
Truth!
---
For everyone saying it’s because it’s popular, that’s not the reason. Op looted it in the last 20 hours and it hasn’t respawned for him yet. Some loot doesn’t respawn simply by server hopping.

You could always start a new character role playing Cap’n from the whitespring shops.

Happens AAAALLLLL the time.. Damn near every encounter involves 2-3 melee hits not registering with the game.

Don’t knock heavy leather. It’s good fully modded. At least until you get legendaries. You can buy the plans at most vendors in the forest area.
---
Dont feel bad I did the same thing lol
---
Enemies,  as in aggressive NPCs.
---
Never happened to me until yesterday.  I was hitting some enemies 4 or 5 times before it would register.  Not sure what is going on
---
You actually usually do end up in the same server as you were in last time, for me anyway. It makes server hopping a fucking BITCH to do now because I can end up in the same server 5 times in a row, except when I actually want to, obviously.
---
Considering there has been 12 fallouts and where only at fallout 4.2 I wouldn't worry.

well if you go to watgoa medical and talk to the gutsy inside do you at least get that one "cop a squatter" it's concidered a cranberry bog daily, other than it i only get the toxic valley ones and the "Ecological Balance" from forest
---
power plant restarts. I am over level 200. xp, loot, none of that really matters to me anymore. I only need to maintain a supply of fusion cores for my laser gatling. I started taking the powerplants to get rid of the annoying message when I zone in to get my fusion cores, over time I started getting better at them , now I enjoy it and feel like bob the builder when I have repaired it. its also a little satisfying to know people in the community can access free power even after I log out for awhile.

One of the trading subReddits offers middlemen who can escrow the transaction. That same subReddit has its own karma system—and if someone has 20 karma there they are likely safe.   I also read the post and comment history of anyone I would trade with and refuse to trade other than for caps with those without detailed credible histories.
---
People always talk about how we need to plan for our future generations to protect them from global warming, deforestation, overpopulation. But this, this is the real issue.
---
You may not have, but I and others have.
---
Bloodied builds can get damage into the range of ~10k-12k with melee, they can kill the SBQ within 30 seconds if she stays grounded.
---
When compared to a non-bloody build that can average anywhere from 200-400, you don’t get much time to do enough effort to get rewarded from her death.
---
End game content needed - an online game like this can only survive as long as new players drop in very reguraly. Then when the new players start lacking end game and so on . Just my thought
---
I can't afford to keep up Live Gold and have Plus as well unfortunately, because I can get 76 on PS here in Australia for around $10 for tricentennial edition physical. Ah well!
---
They probably have serendipity.
---
I bought my flamer mod from Watoga after world hopping maybe 10 or so times just 2 days ago. You can also permanently unlock it by just scrapping Chainsaws but they extremely rare and limited to only specific spots with one daily pickup.
---
Got 3 3 star legendaries just outside yesterday.  Only 1 1 star legendary inside tho.
---
Permanently awful font forever.
---
Sometimes it does trip out and it just won't place the blueprint, it sucks but if you delete the blueprint you will still have everything that is included in the blueprint, letting you rebuild without spending resources again.
---
At some point they're making it so only the first foundation has to be properly placed in the ground, and after that you'll be able to connect them even if they end up floating. Hopefully that should solve this problem.
---
Best thing to do is monitor Reddit for someone to post they're holding it. Granted it didn't work for me and was only able to help 1 person out of all 3 of my posts.

pew pew pew!

Yes especially as the events reveal your position to the whole server! 😡
---
When I’m fighting bosses like queen or Imposter I don’t like to go under 50 % health. Any other time I’m normally between 20-50%. So Furious Gatling might be better for me for boss fights?
---
Does anyone know the increase % of Furious and is it that each time you mis a shot, the damage just rebuilds from the base dmg again?
---
I dont play it on PC
---
You don’t need weapon balancing, you need the option to respec. 
---
It’s bullshit that you can’t easily re-spec between PvP and PvE setups.
---
You typically can't build anywhere that's already built up. There are a few exceptions, but generally it doesn't work. In New Gad, I haven't done it personally, but you might try the single foundation/stair then build technique?
---
Ever play new vegas?
---
Still depends on how much is negated by the hypothetical legendary penetration. As for the legendaries, Bethesda is infamously no good at balance. Usually there is some sort of optimal meta, and then a half dozen alternatives. In 76, there seems to be exactly two, SentAss or Bloodied Facepuncher.
---
Then again, when you don't care about PvP or multiplayer, "balance" becomes somewhat irrelevant, so I am guessing this is a learning experience for them.
---
I know it's at the very entrance to a mine. I want to say it's either the one north of Flatwoods near Slocum Joes, or the one that has Uranium Fever near Whitesprings. Fairly sure it's the WS one.
---
Ahh, but how much of that is subculture and play style (or just not using the subreddits you know of)? I know it used to be super heavy PC trading, but then the ~~fire nation attacked~~ bans started being handed out.

I suspect it was named that way specifically to set it apart from the "normal" fallout games.

Ok so don't get discouraged. Is there a set spawns that might be legends?
---
Once i used tesla on SBQ. Yeah i got tones of XP, but one guy used it too and somehow it triggered pvp with him. So he died. And he toom revenge in middle of queen fight. As he was doing very low damage to me, but didn't stop and was realy anoying, i choosed to kill him second time and he again seeked revenge. WTF man? Then hid group killed me instantly. Great gaming experience. Tesla FTW.
---
Man I found a 3* exploding railway tonight lol what r ppl thinking
---
Best knowledge currently is furious stacks 5%/hit up to 50% (personal testing has roughly matched this). It doesn’t reset if you miss, but supposedly does if you hit a different target (i can confirm misses don’t hurt; haven’t confirmed different targets resetting it).
---
Unknown how long the stacks last before they fade.
---
Basically its a great effect if you’re going to spend a lot of time on the same target. But you gotta stay focused; that’s one of the reasons i don’t use Furious- I like to kill adds to maintain Adrenaline for +60% damage bonus, and with furious, every time you change targets you (supposedly) start over. 
---
But I also hover between 10-20% on most fights (including queen) so Bloodied is a no-brainer for me.
---
Are you gonna remake the whole game in FO4 because I play the fuck out of that. lol
---
I've been traveling between a few spawn spots for a while... No luck :(
---
“Is it good yet” is hardly criticism and very subjective. I get what you’re saying and literally no one here denies the game had and still has issues that can be improved. But going into this sub and asking “is it good” is like going into a restaurant and asking the host “is this restaurant good” what do you expect.
---
I know right

The friends list barely works... I would NOT trust gifting items to friends to work properly... lol

What sucks too is sometimes I land on the same server like 5 times in a row. I wish there were a "new server" option. I also want a "go to the last server option", though. 
---
I'm so needy! lol
---
From personal experience it seems to help to allow some time between runs, but there's no hard numbers to back that up. Since I only play on weekends I find that first West Tek run I do after several days is extremely fruitful and slowly fizzles out with subsequent runs within the 48 hour period. In the meantime I do other events as they proc, like AWOL Armaments and One Violent Night and Horde events in the the Mire and Bog. Also just taking walks in high level areas seems to produce legendaries at a decent rate.
---
Dude that is intense, congrats on surviving! I'm almost to the point where I would've stayed to fight and not run for the hills. Almost.

😂😂😂 perfect

over 800 hours so far. still liking it alot I hope 76 stays working for a long time.

There are so many single player mechanics left over from what this game was built on that simply don't work at all for multiplayer that it hurts. It really ruins the game in a lot of cases. The worst offender is spawn. For a while we could circumvent the spawning issues with abusing the system, but they shut that down, now you have to server hop non-nuke zones to farm. Thanks bethesda, you sure made nukes the go to end game.
---
You are the one legend that made it out alive!
---
What is the long pew?
---
Brahmin milk.
---
You lose your crayons, bud?
---
I'm on XBox as opposed to PS4, but I might still be able to help, since I had a similar issue. I found the table and bar under floor decor, but then the wall hanging part under wall decorations, and the bar stools under the chair menu. Also when you're scrolling thru all the stuff in each respective menu, you should see a bright yellow atom icon on your Atom Shop purchases.
---
Next patch is patch 9
---
Out on the 7th
---
That's awesome.
---
There's so much lore. I love reading notes, listening to holotapes, and just reading the story of the placement of things.
---
Go an finally live out my dream of selling chems
---
Well, at least you didnt get nuked.
---
I respecd and now am taking it down in about 3-5 shots of my BE lever, I also have a dragon that’s troubleshooters + more vats crit damage now for when I’m getting pissed off
---
Working as intended. Git gud.
---
Welcome to the game :) it's so awesome lol
---
on road to flatwoods down from overseers camp is  a fairly common spawn point for the stand
---
I’ve found him a few times north of fissure prime as I was heading up north to turn in technical data. You can see him from pretty far away because his stand has a bunch of blue and yellow balloons attached to it.
---
There’s always a scorchbeast fighting a mirelurk queen and a death claw at Site Alpha. Usually scorched show up also.
---
Congratulations, now you can look like everyone else. Stored mine after I saw every third player wearing one.
---
I wouldnt...maybe on a new character thou
---
am I the only person who plays survival mode for the added XP and the chance of having those scary moments when you(rarely) interact with another player/group?
---
In my opinion it’s a survival mode. Not a pvp mode. I think it’s so fun not being able to fast travel and to actually have to think about how you’re gonna get where you’re gonna go + what you’re gonna take with you... and how laying low and just surviving and being tactical with your actions is part of the experience.
---
I’ve never gone into survival for the PVP.. I’ve had epic pvp experiences before, some lame ones, but mostly since I am just there to play the game normally with some added difficulty, the people that I kill or kill me are just basically higher level bosses 
---
Adventure after a certain point is too forgiving
---
Mister Korm's Ultracite Armaments! ... Too wordy. Think I'll shorten it to M.K.'s Ultras
---
my go to weapon for the SBQ, mines does arouns 120/120 when im ready for the queen.
---
Yeah played since launch and about 2 months after. Game was something. So many server crash dupes LUL
---
im on xbox no problems here.
---
They also kinda have to make a battle royale mode. It's the old new hotness.
---
Yeah, I've had one guy target me during workshop defense quests, it's annoying as hell because I just want the plans :\
---
You're probably right, Had a TSE shotgun before it and getting muddled by termanology/not understanding.
---
Cheers for the correction.
---
Gave up on melee because of this. Hell, sometimes you hit an enemy and they get the damage animation and no damage.
---
Screw you that's ridiculous!
---
this is the game changer
---
Yeah true good point
---
Sorry for not selling it for 1k then
---
Added u. Vicarious+
---
Do you see many around without backpack?
---
Lol...no i dont need to prove anything
---
I would be more excited if I weren't maxed out on caps...
---
👍
---
I think so, but I don't remember anything special happening there.
---
Is that the one from the rare charleston trader robot?
---
I thank Todd for flipping on the spawn switch
---
As a solo play, it’s hard to say that the LMG is worth it for the specific reason you said, ammo cost. But, as a group with your crippling chance and some other helpful perks (meat tenderizer lets say), I say it’s still worthwhile. 
---
I play my guy as a taNKY LMG guy. So I run in first, draw aggro, and just hold down the fire button until they drop dead.
---
Yes please
---
Scorched Earth rewards the improved ones, regulars are only from the store
---
You get improved repair kits from killing the queen.
---
Know how walls have two facings when snapped to one section? The garage door can occupy the second facing, in my experience, so long as you're snapping it to a section between two floors/foundations.
---
Killing the Scorch Queen drops them as a reward for the quest. Same happened to me.
---
I agree, but more than that should change. All legendary armor modifiers should only be pve. No pvp armor bonuses. Then balance all weapon legendary modifiers, bloody shouldn’t be beating everything else.
---
I literally just stopped playing tonight. My ign is roundyroundy. Add me and I’ll catch you online sometime.
---
I dunno man, I didn’t know what I was doing at all when I tried pvp for the first time the other night, still racked up some kills. People run up to other players like they’re regular enemies, I think that’s where the issue is. The dude who killed me most was good at hiding and had a knife, that’s it. He didn’t jump around and spray bullets like he was playing fortnite, he crept up and shanked people, and it was effective.
---
I have one as well and was wondering if I should put the automatic receiver on it.
---
on the t-60 armor as well 😱
---
No, they're called mini nukes aka football of death and they are perfect the way they are
---
Will do!
---
How that song didn't make the list, I will never know.
---
Is the weightless chameleon build better than just using some chameleon armor? I'm legit curious.
---
Fireproof and dense say hello
---
Some way to focus farm would be cool though.
---
Yeah but they don't all but knock you on your ass.
---
Also, I guess you haven't met a "Super Duper" Mutant yet. Once in a blue moon, a Super mutant will just deal like triple damage for no reason. Tends to just two shot me through my PA lol. Last I saw one was a week or two ago, then like a month before that.
---
I picked up a Quad Explosive Harpoon Gun at a vendor awhile ago . Ended up trading it for a 3* Unyielding Sentinel chest :)
---
It's only going to get worse, unfortunately. At least this build required some work and planning (a single floor section out-of-place required starting over from the beginning, etc.)  
---
We're about to see floating foundations from hell, and everywhere. However, the ability to make your base a fast-travel point and the removal of attacking C.A.M.P.s without provocation may well encourage a rebuild to a non-floating hotel/bar.
---
I just found an alien at whitespring !
---
Igt. KimHyuna
---
Come asap !
---
True, that.
---
Pews are what you sit on in most churches. Long pew is an extended length pew.
---
Lol i almost did the same thing thinking it was the legendary laser rifle pew pew from fallout 3 and 4.
---
wait until 40 to 50, the struggle was real LOL, events do a shit ton off events and killing and more killing
---
I play... hmmm... my own version of solo.
---
Which is to say I play as a party of four but all four are me.
---
However shy of running afoul of The Zenimax Overlords for playing the game 'the wrong way' and finding myself on the business end of a banhammer I only control one character at a time rather than trying to take all my merry toons out together to party though so is a 'Solo+' of sorts.
---
Like the church bench
---
Ahh ok thanks
---
I just turn it off and play bobfm in the background.
---
Just buy weapon plans, sell weapons to mid levels.
---
Congrats! Still working on it myself.
---
Lol forgot about that place.....yep when i found it i chuckled...like alot
---
if you wait til they selfdestruct the problem should be solved
---
I had this happen a while ago as well, I dropped all of them and it stopped.
---
You don't actually need the code pieces in your inventory to launch a nuke so it doesn't effect gameplay that way.
---
Good luck hope that works :)
---
You can abandon certain quests already, but a way to block specific events would be nice. I'd rather just build a fgen for my fusion core processor than power up whichever plant
---
Its ammo is just heavy af thou
---
Also decent plastic is the top floor where rose is....all those plastic plates.
---
I know this but the popping up every few minutes is quite annoying. I’m going to  wait till they all self destruct
---
That's why I said if you drop them lol, it stopped for me after that
---
They mentioned something on the pax live show about permanent camps, but they don't have the tech for it yet.
---
Personally i would dislike not being able to server jump between events and vendors, and i would hate to see 100+ camps all over the map in it's current form, and the absolute worst would be not being able to place my camp where i want because the spot is taken. It works for games like archeage, with much, much bigger maps and very specific build zones. But in 76, it would ruin the "the fallout experience". It would need much more limitations to be permanent.
---
Lol I can relate. The fiancée has her own account and whatnot and on an occasion or two I’ve used it to help spawn and whatnot, and mule stuff to other characters. 
---
I’d probably stray away from the LMGs then,  switch over to a rifle or shotty. Maybe break it out if ya got a party you’re playing with, or crowd control during SBQ/Sheepsquatch
---
And it costs crystal to use.
---
You get atoms off it though, so that's something I guess.
---
That'll be 1600 atoms per plant
---
You can already do it if aesthetics aren't too important to you, just put campfires down, the dirt within them counts.
---
Same with metal walls
---
Really good stuff overall, and while I agree forcing Raiders into being a PvP only faction seems lop-sided.  
---
An amendment I'd recommend is "You can earn Currency if you represent your Faction in PvP."  but also from doing some other things.  
---
For Raider, I think taking Workshops could work, and expanding Rose's quests to have more "Events" 
---
Like making chems, raiding a location for chem components or weapons and other gear.  
---
I'd go all in on the chems for Raiders and unlocking new recipes
---
Stash space is 800 now
---
I doubt it. Will probably have more posts inviting people to check out their camp and vending machines. High priced items will likely still be posted for trade.
---
We do actually its under your missions in pipboy bottom of screen.
---
I got scammed the other day, trader posted a pic of 3* explosive, meet to get gun, he gave another 3* non explosive crap, you can’t see all 3 perks when trading with players...my trust level is pretty gone right now, I sale every day to other players...but will def be more careful when buying...
---
Thanks for the honest advice.
---
I have a shotty toon too but that one is about to meet the nerfhammer tomorrow; need to think what to respec it to if the blow is TSE level 'we do not condone or endorse the use of these weapons we ourselves put in the game in this state, you should have known better and go poke fog crawlers with a rolling pin or something rather than becoming reliant on them' - which somehow I think it will be, they are not in the business of half measures these devs.
---
I think I will do as suggested, flog the LMG before I do something I later regret and stay as they guy that does some DPS against these walking HP bags and cleans the ankle biters and face huggers from the field.
---
+karma
---
I play melee while everyone else I play with uses TSE's, so I generally play the bait.
---
The trick is to have as many people as possible on your friends list. This way you can join friends server after server and be sure you are on different map each time.
---
Not exactly a spoiler, the flatwoods monster has been in game since beta
---
Oh damn really! Is that a bug or is it just completely useless then?
---
Weight reduction perk for that
---
It is much greater than a lot of people say, and it’s only getting better and better with each patch.
---
Welcome!
---
Nice! Me and my wife also enjoy the environmental story telling, just wandering off in the middle of no where we often find interesting stuff that make us try to wander what happened
---
Untrue I haven’t been there in weeks. Thank you for your assumptions relayed with such conviction.
---
I made a alt character and bought my friend a copy of the game 2 weeks ago. We’ve played 14 hours and are both at level 20.
---
Just did it again and got 4-5 but all 1 star but still better.
---
Yes from the Queen. I have six of them, had eight but I used two. Not one came from the atom shop.
---
Have 2 on the house to try them. Just like heroine. Before you know it your hooked.
---
Your cat piss in your cereal this morning? Why so negative? Life is good man, enjoy it.
---
Lol yea there drops but just remember if you dont use them they still weigh like half a pound....so use them. I dont think you can drop them.
---
I feel like I have a decent amount of friends, but they're practically all off line all the time.
---
This is like.....epic man
---
Add me - IGN Maneetoe, I can probably hook you up with some decent legendaries. Best thing I can recommend is getting to 32, get starched genes and marsupial mutation at a minimum, and then farm the crap out of Whitesprings. I did this on my second character, who is now lvl 125 in less time than it took my first character to reach 56.
---
Remove all the percentage buffs from guns and gear, just make them flat numbers. Hard cap max damage and max resist on everything. This would actually make PvE a challenge again too, and so much easier to balance both modes. I'm in the same boat, I really enjoy PvP but on equal terms.
---
This game is sadly like a typical asian game, stripped from all balance. When you get the best gear, you're walking around like a god.
---
Want plastic, I can tell you a better way to get it, learn mods, and get steel all in one go. 
---
Hit up anywhere where muties are common. Slaughter them. Equip the scrapper perk and start scrapping their laser rifles. Each one yields like 10 plastic. Also get plenty of steel scrapping the other guns.
---
But always-on PVP brings so **much** to the game! /s
---
This kind of fuckery is why I knew the PvP system was going to be a trainwreck. Until the game is changed so enabling Pacifist means you can't PVP at all, including damaging other people's stuff, this kind of thing will continue to happen.
---
How about, a guy kills you with a bloody explosive dragon a few times. It's downside is slow fire rate and reload, but also it breaks fast. 
---
This guy can use repair kits and use the dragon indefinitely, popping them in between your respawns.
---
Sounds like a competitive advantage to me.
---
 Even just being able to hold a position indefinitely, never needing to leave to repair your weapon. I can remember countless times my rifle has been close to breaking during intense PvP matches. I have had to retreat and fall back to my camp or elsewhere to repair up.
---
Also, repairing armor on the fly, especially the armors that matter in PvP, is a huge boon. If a piece of armor breaks on a Sentinel Assassin set, you become much more killable. Explosive damage actually does alot of durability to them, and I have also needed to back out of fighting to repair armor.
---
All of these things seem competitively advantageous.
---
This is correct. Fort Defiance is a known, guaranteed spawn.
---
Are laser weapons at all viable or able to be used effectively?
---
Sounds like you became the griefer.
---
Good! Hahaha
---
Yep, totally second this method.  Scrapping every piece of amour and weapons you find to unlock mods and then crafting and scrapping them over and over will give you XP, materials and unlock more mods.
---
Nah. I'm not gonna be nice to some level 235 trying to be macho. He was stupid enough to do it.
---
This happens if you pick up multiple copies of the same code from a single carrier corpse. Usually relogging resolves the duplicate conflict and leaves you with a single version of the offending code.
---
classic bugthesda but considering they earn money off the atomic shop they will probably fix it asap
---
It is, and it will continue after the patch. The change only effects players who aren't hostile to you. If you have a workshop and someone uses it to make you hostile, your camp will still be fair game.
---
I do events. Easy to earn stimpacks and sometimes plans. I usually am the only one doing it. Sometimes 1 or 2 more people come in but usually just me.
---
I've seen something similar exploited in survival. He was inside a house, completely inaccessible. There were a handful of holes he could shoot out through, but since he was crouching or the walls were blocking us, we couldn't VATS to figure out exactly where they were and randomly firing shots towards him was doing no good.
---
OwO
---
Says the wannabe raider.
---
Automatron was so fun in Fallout 4 and I got so many mods that added new weapons and parts. I would love to build a whole army and march across the wasteland with my metallic friends.
---
I say sucked in to him. If you're going to go around attacking people you know that you might lose your junk. 
---
Dickhead should have stashed it if he was so precious about it.
---
That's not being a griefer at all. 
---
A griefer is someone who attacks someone unprovoked. 
---
It's just this time the griefer got fucked over. 
---
EAD to them I say!!!
---
All Praise to Todd.
---
Jus hope pacifist camps come with patch 9 cus it would be griefers paradise otherwise.  Just imagine some asshat visiting every camp on the map and destroying them all 😱😱😱
---
I use mele as a backup and I've noticed this as well more since this patch.
---
I have two, explosive is kind of shit depending on the weapon. On a combat rifle it's pretty garbage; lever action? Amazing.
---
Thanks.  
---
I'm @Ruben76uk.
---
Dumbass 😂😂 i would have mad his pay for his junk back good one🔥🔥
---
No. Why would there be?
---
Oh no, my camp is *crayons* now!
---
Team up?
---
Problem progressively worse Since launch...
---
If I do the Queen with my sniper, I'd rather kill all the annoying adds and let the heavy gunners focus on the bat. According to your plan, I shouldn't get the rewards.
---
It's a great purchase. I have not come across any pew plans to be picked up.
---
Now start the Church of Atom!
---
Your lucky, 9/10 times i cant even see owned items
---
F
---
Your rifle broke in that desaster? Just hit up the atom store, we've got you covered!
---
Well put mate and I couldn’t agree with you more. I am mostly a solo player and am there for the xp bonus so when I come across another player it’s often nail bitingly terrifying.
---
I've never really had a problem with anyone doing this, pretty much everyone i've seen we just wave to each other and go about our day. 
---
Are there a lot of issues with hyper aggressive players? I haven't played in several months and just got back into it.
---
If you remove legendary effects on weapons, you remove melee build instantly. Basically everyone will play lever action furtive vats build. The only issue with pvp is not weapon effect but armor. I don't think the +15% should be stackable with the +8%.
---
Just reading about someone carrying 200 adhesive makes me feel nervous for them
---
Still bugged here, can't complete cranberry bog, the mire, savage divide and toxic Valley. Aggravating
---
have you tried reinstalling the game
---
I agree cuz i do trades on my alt but give caps on my main so I have to get them to shoot me another team invt it is weird why they made it a thing
---
Is this the one folks are paying unbelievable caps for at m76?
---
I thought so but even at max rank it’s a 45% chance. If I’m repeatedly stabbing or shooting and they just don’t take any damage - something is broken. I’d love to post a clip but it won’t change the game.
---
This would also fix the issue of not having loot on the SBQ load and you could just get the loot anyway
---
Isn’t there a subreddit for this
---
Hey, after player vending machines come into the game, come by my camp south of silo alpha.
---
I've got a bridge to sell you.  😉
---
I didn't get far into this game, Just wondering why Train stations specifically?
---
Hmmm.  Might be fun to build a church as a main building in a camp.
---
I spend my whole time on survival for xp. I’m level 55 well built melee with no legendary Armor or weapons and 95% of the people I run in to pvping who are level 100+ its an even enough match 
---
I think people just need to have more specific PvP builds if they want to play survival and PvP, I’m sure a lot of people are running around with perks that are redundant for PvP such as white knight, pick lock, weapon breaking or power Armor perk cards etc.
---
This I love as well
---
I bought that plan today but just wanted it for my church of the divine atom
---
First post to make me chuckle
---
You're searching every med kit, right? I normally have like 60 radaways, how are you not finding any?
---
makes sense that we get kicked out of the team when we join another server but i definitely agree that it’d make things so much easier if it asked us to leave the team only after we hit play again, it could have play and play with team as separate options too
---
Peeeeeeeeeeew Peeeeeeeeew Peeeeeeeeew!
---
I love the sound of Long Pew in the morning.
---
This is a good idea.
---
Could also turn Responders:Raiders faction war. Which would be extremely interesting. 
---
As for chems I’d suggest turning in chems to rose but I imagine that certain players have been hoarding chems either from dupes or just muleing then. So I agree that Rose should have more events or even daily quests to find Chem stashes for her in heavily enemy populated areas.
---
&gt; This game can't decide *what* it wants to be.
---
Exactly. The Survival/PVP component of FO76 celarly shows the tremendous lack of design and foresight on behalf of the developers.
---
Where do you normally keep your health? And are you in Cav armor, or what? I'm thinking about changing up my build, I mostly do shotgun, but honestly I'd rather do a rifle but my shotgun is Vampire so I never die. Hard to give that up, as I've not found a really awesome rifle yet.
---
I've read up on that and they can be applied it seems but leg mods have the same exact name as arm mods so sometimes you can't apply it because even though it seems like you should be able to its not the mod for the limb you're modding
---
"Groups are competing to get world first clear", Calm the fuck down, WoW is the biggest MMO in the world and most people still don't give a shit about worlds first. Those who attempt it are a super small percentage of players. There's hardly enough people playing FO76 anyway, who HONESTLY gives a damn about world first.
---
They a Silver Shroud Cosplayer came
---
Begone miscreant for I am the Silver Shroud
---
I'm coming back to this game, is it good yet?
---
It's probably per a shot. Since the weapon arcs haveing two shot I can go pretty crazy. I use a quad Tesla 60 shots and not sure if I want to make it a auto or shotgun.
---
I can just imagine a line of heavy gunners with PA guarding the main gate and on towers with sniper back-up. Other guns on walls thinning out the hordes from to of the walls.
---
I have rank 2 on a lvl ~20 and I get it quite often
---
Sneak attack gives a 2.5 with high sneak I just crouch before each shot
---
ARE YA READY KIDS?
---
Lol you bought 2 copies of Tricentennial Edition, they don't give a single fuck about your opinion at that point, you already served your meager purpose to them.
---
Am I missing something, if you were in pacifist mode, then you should not be damaging either him or the camp, no?  If you dont damage the camp, then they cannot hurt you.
---
Now if people had turned off pacifist in order to hunt the bounty then that makes sense.
---
I'm perfectly calm. You guys are the ones that are fuming and raging over my personal view of something. And it's hilarious i might add :D
---
and the fact that it's literally the name of an in game event
---
The best idea I’ve heard is that you get a choice, whether you’re in the workshop or not, to either defend or relinquish the workshop when they try to take it. 
---
If you choose to hand it over, they just get ownership. If you choose to defend, then there’s a grace period for fast traveling (and so you can’t cheese kills with a friend like it works now), and then pvp starts. And if you choose neither, then it defaults to passing ownership.
---
That's why you never retaliate.
---
Caveat emptor
---
On xbox you can quit the game from the home screen and still stay on your team.
---
Depends on your perks and level...  
---
I am primarily melee, but typically carry a heavy weapon to deal the SB's that won't land, and I switched to the LMG in a heartbeat after trying it out.  
---
Fully perked up, between the good damage, exceptional RoF, manageable recoil and fast reload it is fantastic weapon.  
---
    
---
It's only draw back is the ammo of course, but I'd argue it's worth the investment, just find a weight reduced Gatling to carry as the "Trash mob" gun and save the LMG for the better fights if it's that much of an issue.
---
I don't touch workshops because it makes you an open season attack target _anywhere on the map_.  Of _course_ you should be attackable in the workshop itself or after engaging to defend the workshop, but hanging out in your CAMP only to have someone mini-nuke you into oblivion so they can snag your workshop?  No, thank you.
---
Yes, that's what I do to solve this. But it doesn't seem right, to kill the software for this.
---
Why hide the rad shower?
---
And you keep being a troll.
---
Not a very good one, but a troll nonetheless.
---
Oh hello you! where have you been lately?
---
You know me, I am more prone to store resources than to toss them at mobs.
---
Maybe one day there will be a mechanic that allows me to crush mobs under the sheer weight of the stuff I have hoarded over the months.
---
Let's just stop pretending we care about making npcs immersive. Give it 3 legendary stars then we will talk.
---
Im perfectly calm. And i'm not the one raging and fuming over someones personal view on things. Which is againts using exploits  to build these type of unimmersive things btw. Watching you guys downvote and yell like kids is the best &lt;3
---
My friend kept getting killed by a lv105 so I DESTROYED this guy I took like 100 stimpacks from him dont spawn kill
---
Is it the raider Power Armor? I found a full suit raider power armor in Pleasant Valley Station and took it
---
By Lake Elloise, near the Fissure Site there, there is a lateral cave that you can put your camp at the absolute bottom of it against the far wall and you can encompass the Lead node on the top of the cave and (I think it might be) a copper node on the bottom.
---
Me pew.
---
I have 250 acid
---
The pvp modes they have currently aren't very popular. I'd prefer they spend the time and resources on the game mode people actually play.
---
Add me disorderlyduke
---
Honestly, that's one that Bethesda should patch out. Going into PVP with someone automatically when you try to take their workshop is so that people can defend themselves. If the attacker's not at the workshop, they don't need to defend it. That one ought to result in Quest Failed and being taken out of combat mode the moment they get a set distance from the workshop.
---
Anyone know where to get the wooden desks plan?
---
...said the person using ambush tactics because they're not "gud" enough for a fight where the other person shoots back.
---
You have to be careful pvp'ing with 200 adhesive, you could end up in a sticky situation.
---
I'm pretty sure they're always shop locations, which means some of the few places you can reliably offload junk for caps, fish for new blueprints, etc...
---
I totally agree, but would you bet against a battle royale mode being released?
---
An apocalypse is the end of a world, not a confined nature disaster. But those pictures do look similar to 76, just real. Nice.
---
How?
---
Yeah, it did kind of piss me off after farming up the coat just to see it become the most common outfit in the game.
---
i bought a sheepsquatch staff plan for 2000 caps
---
Damn you posted the one thing I was always too embarrassed to say! I thought it was a gun too lol.
---
Yeah same, I have about 300 Diluted Stimpaks to sell.
---
Then explain what the point of assassins on armor would be?
---
Very good idea. Just not okay with the quest failing if any one fortress is taken, since it will almost automatically happen seen how broken scorchbeast can be sometimes.
---
Let's say you have two scorchbeast that do not land, it's doomed to fail
---
And now Google Searching for "Long Pew" puts this page as the top result.
---
On the survival mode you can only fast travel to vault 76, train stations, or your camp. The first two became popular places to camp people spawning in.
---
It's an mmo-f/tps-rpg game. Not that hard to understand.
---
Some people carry around their junk instead of stashing it and then use the pack rat perk. Since weight reducing perks don’t apply to your stash, carrying your junk around allows you to store more weapons/armor/etc. in your stash, with a minimal penalty to your personal weight.
---
Seasons would remove the players who have these God tier items from the game and force everyone to go from the beginning each season.

Your account seems to be a fake. Bethesda worker?
---
It has. If anyone is still duping Bethesda now has mechanisms to find out who that is and ban them very quickly
---
This is why i switched to shotgun pretty early. I just got tired of it.
---
If you join survival you know it's going to happen. Fast traveling or spawning at train stations is suicide. It's a well known game mechanic. Short version, git gud and stop doing it.
---
After reading the title I had to check you didn’t come across any deathclaws, I can sleep at night again now!
---
If you use Nerd Rage, having Photosynthetic might be a bad idea. You want to keep your Health low.
---
Wish i had saved the bevy of ammo i had. I will sell junk, chems, ammo, legendaries, boiled and purified water. Pretty low priced too, i just want to do it for the fun of it really.
---
I would love the option to abandon workshops. I usually claim one or two if I'm low on a specific resource but I never install locks on them. I figure this way it acts as a co-op and if anyone needs something they can just grab it right? Isn't bounty only applied on locked items? (Still a relative newb to 76)
---
Honestly, I love using melee. Because I jumped back into my game as my dad progressed quite far ahead, he was able to give me some parts for my power armor and now it’s full so I don’t think I am able to use any gauntlets. My preferred type of melee weapon is the super sledge, last night I went through the game getting the 10mm that shoots fire bullets, pyro lazer which I can’t use for the lack of ammo and the nuke launcher what’s also 90% less weight. I would like to be able to combo something that’s more dps based, would you advice I go hunting for dragon and upgrade it from there because from what I’ve heard, that upgraded can almost 2 shots legendary beats at a certain level and I have the team that could achieve that

I think we have a different definition of exploit. Camping spawn points may be weak but it's hardly an exploit.

Nuking helvetia actually gives you a lower chance for high level legendaries to spawn. Charleston and harpers ferry are mostly only good because of a bug in inside instanced areas as the capital building and burrows should not be effected by nukes
---
Haahaha a friend of mine had the same issue, thought it was a pew-pew gun. If Beth wanted to mitigate confusion they could’a just called it a church bench. Who tf knows what a pew is?
---
And all I hear is "Waaah! Waaah! I shouldn't have to learn how to play the game to get kills!"
---
This is correct, if you can crouch you can dodge a raider and a dodge ball

This is called latency as by the time youve hit the enemy is out of range

I've actually croaked in a SBQ fight and dropped like 30 fluxes, hundreds of screws, adhesive, aluminium, etc. One dude peeked into my stash and left everything alone, other 12+ players left it be even though I died in plain sight.
---
Don't start no trouble won't be no trouble. (Maybe)
---
He mentions reclamation day which doesn't happen until the start of 76 so it CAN'T be from before that point
---
That's a good plan.
---
I'm just glad some randoms got you to the point of sniveling on Reddit about intended game design. See you at the white spring station rook.
---
If they had assassin/sentinel armor that would be why you couldn't damage them. Add Lone Wanderer and you're doing around 12% of the damage you would normally be doing. And that's not even taking into consideration damage resistance yet. 
---
This is why stagger perk cards are mandatory in pvp, since they essentially "turn off" the sentinel or cavalier effects.
---
Adhesive isn't even rare in FO76, how the screws were a real loss.
---
Well yes, but actually no
---
That's the exact definition of what this game is. Is a massively multi-player online game that is focused around a first person/third person shooter combat style with rpg elements included like questing, npcs, perks, loot, a pve environment. Tell me again how this isn't what the game is?
---
Chill B, my response was a meme. You’ve seen that meme right?
---
Preach.
---
Nope which is why I reacted the way I did. Apologies in that case as I didn't know.
---
the photo of the alien works this time?

Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
&gt; I'm perfectly calm. And i'm not the one raging and fuming over someones personal view on things. Which is against using exploits to build these type of unimmersive things btw. Watching you kids downvote and yell is the absolute best &lt;3
---
Says the guy who deleted his comment...
---
People who delete their comments after getting downvoted don't get to have an opinion, especially when that comment was quite toxic.
---
I wonder what the chances are of you deleting the comment this is replying to... probably quite likely since you've made it pretty clear that you can't handle differing opinions. Can't expect much from an overly sensitive and temperamental manchild who gets so easily triggered over something so basic...
---

---
Rebuilding top of the world as a faction hub would be great and Rose starts Events and sends the whole crew out on a mission. 
---
Also with a faction system, perhaps also a control point/territory system as well?  
---
for PvP and controlling workshops to build up your faction's resources 
---
and you can get rewards for how well your faction is doing
---
I was very hyped up, but the closer we get the more I dread the awful look of it. I can build a bar with the beautiful bar set from the atom shop. I can build the antique funriture from whitesprings in my stylish bar, but when I want to sell stuff I gather the burnt out lockers and weld on rusted out netting... Where's the stylish vending machine? No, not just a recolour, but a good looking one! I would be happy with the look of the vending machines at the train stations.
---
'massive'?
---
is it a long bridge?
---
Yes. Massive does not necessarily mean a lot of people on one server it means a lot of people playing the game.
---
Came for the testiggles, left with an deserved upvote.
---
9/10 - would read again
---
Thanks, corrected Bloody Mess -- typo and added Incisor to Melee
---
Found this in beta! Everyone wanted it in trade up until the event because it's hard to see in there. I played without mic but dm'd a couple of people the location to hook them up.
---
Faster swing speeds help. You miss 2 but the next 6 land
---
Folks the grind is the game. I know most of us didn't have what this game is in mind when we thought about a multiplayer fallout but this is what we've got and it's not going to morph overnight into something else. I struggled with a lot of these feelings myself, even quit the game for a couple months. 
---
When I came back I came back with a different perspective. I embraced the game for what it is and I've enjoyed it a lot more. 
---
If you don't have your perks and mutations in order then it doesn't matter if the God level weapons and armor being sold on Ebay showed up magically in your stash, you will get rolled tf up by people who know what they are doing. I'm not going to delve into that here, there's no shortage of great info on reddit and elsewhere, look it up.
---
As for gear, yes it's very important. Yes, the assassin effect stacking with sent/cav needs to be adjusted. The effect that allows sent builds to avoid stagger by jumping in place needs to be removed. But there's no getting around the fact that to get a load out that will go toe to toe with top pvp players you have 2 choices: grind, or buy it with real money. If grinding isn't fun for you, or you're unwilling to spend real money (I'm not either) then this probably isn't the game for you. 
---
If you want to keep playing, stay in adventure mode or get with the program. Loot and barter for better stuff and maybe most importantly learn how to pvp. Good luck out there
---
No other game which also has a thing called latency does this. At least it shouldn’t play the SE then
---
Had this happen to me at a workshop. I saw the guy coming and prepared for him. He still managed to 1 shot me with a TSE gun. I came back and used a stealthboy to sneak up on him. I hit him once with my bloodied melee weapon and took him down to around 25% and then the next six hits did nothing. He was busy screwing around in his inventory and yet still managed to live long enough to close out and kill me again in one shot. 
---
I just stopped playing for a while.
---
Yeah, it's leaving at the same time as the current apocalypse horseman PA. The new big update's coming this Tuesday and they usually rotate the lots on the title page of the atomic store when the game comes back online.
---
Sorry but i haven't deleted any of my comments. Ever.
---
Name another game like this one?
---
I'm assuming you are going for a low health build?
---
Yup. Stagger perks and VATS criticals are essential - grenades are helpful too.
---
You can't make them dangerous without redesign whole combat system. Even if you boosted current Deathclaw damage to point where they could kill anything with 1 hit, I still wouldn't feel threatened by them, because...
---
1) I go inside building or top of something or jump over concrete road splitter or fallen tree- Deathclaw can't do a sh#t.
---
2) If Deathclaw was able to get everywhere, there would be no way to kill it, because it would kill you in 1 hit.
---
3) Even if you boost its damage, but not to 1 hit kill, it wouldn't make them more dangerous, because all you have to do, is press Heal button.
---
You see, with current design, there is no way to make them dangerous, without making ridiculously pointless. To make them actually dangerous, you need to actually design combat mechanics, that is dependable on experience, preparation and ability to counter different attack.
---
Watch out -- your wife is colluding with Bethesda to gaslight you.  Maybe she is having an affair with Todd.
---
I will say I'll be on intermittently over the next two weeks. I have my final year finals so won't be on too long or too often until after next week
---
I was farming steel prior to an ISS spawn today, saw it spawn, teleported without dropping off, didn't think about it. Died at the very end of the fight and some asshole took the 112 steel i had on me. Not a big deal, but I had just run out after making ammo. Point being that people often take my stuff without being provoked.
---
Alternatively you can save almost as much weight by storing your armor on yourself instead of junk (armor perk gets 50% reduction for 2 points packrat gets 75% for 3) and your junk is safe in your stash that way.
---
This is really well said. I love pvp but treat it more as something emergent I come across in the world rather than a death match mode. Tonight I hit Harper's, the burrows, sugar grove and west tek, all without seeing another person. At the end of my session I picked a person on the leaderboard, and went after them just for the fun of it. Tonight i killed them, other nights I get killed. That's the fun of it
---
I did manage to add you just now so you should have a request from me!
---
No one has mentioned it but huntersville is south of west tek and is right up there with west tek and generals steakhouse
---
I don't know why you're getting downvoted - this is absolutely true. A handmade with a VATS crit build and the basic defensive perk cards and you can take on anyone. Not saying the sentinel doesn't have an advantage, but they also tend to over-rely on their armor. I would also recommend grenades - they have to stand there and jump in place, which makes dodging 'nades pretty tough.
---
&gt; even though they have VPNs.
---
Because they have (and need) VPNs, surely.
---
Could only be fixed with local servers, and that's not going to happen.
---
I just hope we see another Fallout on the same level as New Vegas eventually.
---
Yup. My main (adventure) character is horrible at PVP. The new one I built for survival has mostly different perks and is pretty bad at PVE. Very different worlds.
---
Oh, yeah, *just* a game.  A game where China and the US were at war.  No way playing that is going to get you in trouble in China.
---
Yeah, he was 300 screwed.
---
So the Flatwoods monster counts as an alien for the daily?
---
While all true, I think there's an argument that it's unhealthy to the game. Having manditory cards limits the types of builds. If you're a sniper and you run into somone who's using Assasin's/sentinel armor you're kind of fucked, since stagger only lasts so long, and snipers don't generally use automatic weapons.
---
Just curious. But I play in Beijing on PS4 without a VPN and it works pretty decently. I imagine you are on PC, do you need a vpn to access the game?
---
You know, I hear this happening far more often on console than I do on PC.  What is it with console players?  Not you, of course or most of the good folks here, but this puzzles me.
---
sending nudes olden day style
---
Haha!

Was doing the "take a photo of players" thing and took a photo of a level 2 outside vault 76.  Totally forgot about the bug and waved at them after taking the photo.  Boing!  Wheee!  Splat!  *Server Disconnected*.

---
Yes I thought about that but wouldn't it show the correct weight in the stash though? If not then I still think it's something to look at, as its not very clear.
---
Good guess, I plan on doing that I just wish everyone else would.
---
Pew pew pew
---
&gt; NPC's with actual quests involving choice and consequence 
---
So, how does this work in a shared world.  Whose choices have consequence on the world?  What if two people made different choices?
---
Maybe your choices could have consequences *for your character*, but unless they invent an Everett style "Many Worlds" branching of the servers I don't see how your choices could affect the world.  (And if they did that the end-point would be everybody ending up all alone on their own server).
---
The [Pew Pew](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Pew_Pew) was a pretty good unique laser pistol in FONV.

I have over 800 hours and I am mostly happy with it, recently I have been very happy with it. others hate it. no one will be able to answer this subjective type question but you after you have plonked down your money and seen for yourself. IF money is an issue for you and you cannot afford to be disappointed then don't buy it. that's not just advice for this game its advice for life. If spending the money on anything is a gamble you really just cant afford to lose don't make the gamble. also don't go around asking strangers how you should feel about something. make your own decision. gambling with money and or things in life can ruin you. friend wants to borrow your car? can you afford to lose said car ? no? tell your friend to fuck right off. don't gamble with money the house always wins.
---
Flux is good, as long as you can find fauna to give you the fluids'n'mass to stabilise it.  There are only so many orbital strike beacons one can carry.  (Not to mention fibre optics is nearly as hard to find as fluids'n'mass).
---
dang yeah your right
---
The simple reason this unplayable environment is persisting is because Bethesda doesn't know how to create balance in PVP, shit, they don't know anything about PVP. It's understandable since they have never done it before, but it's not excusable.
---
You cannot mix PVP with PVE and expect it to turn out fair and balanced, nobody does this. Best way for fallout to have balanced PVP is no perk cards and no legendaries, if Bethesda doesn't do that, they will not find balance in PVP. Also doing that would mean the PVE would be affected too, how do you combat that? You don't, they aren't supposed to be mixed, it doesn't work.
---
Fallout isn't even meant to be PVP, the mechanics of the game do not work with PVP, and I have no idea why Bethesda are trying to guide this game down this route. I've said this already and I'll say it again now, what you want to do Bethesda, is to focus this game on co-op mechanics and story, like you're doing with nuclear winter, that is what the whole point of creating fallout 76 was about, you wanted to create a world where people could explore the world of Fallout together, well PVP isn't in that vision, it doesn't work in fallout, you can't keep the same combat mechanics as the previous games and expect it to work in 76, not against players anyway.
---
Last laugh perk (I think that's it) and some grenades.  Just for that little bit of revenge.
---
I definitely see your point! 
---
Thanks for the compliment. I try to stay reasonable with this game because I really like it and would like to see it improve but sometimes it’s too easy to slip into some overly polarized and frothy arguments.
---
It's mad annoying when you're using a bloodied build and die because your hit won't register
---
I had a very similar experience when i was around level 40 or so. I had a workshop that was under ghoul attack so i tp'd back to it to find a over level 100 player with a 200+ bounty running around in X0-2 power armor with a ax hacking away at the ghouls. Not knowing his intentions for sure i emoted a heart and tried to run by him to get to my stash to dump my junk (heh) while my turrets took care of the ghouls. as soon as i exited my stash i started attacking the ghouls when the other player hits me from behind with the ax. i spawned not too far off and returned to the camp with a minigun and shredded the player a lot quicker than i thought i would. when i searched his bag he had plenty of junk for me and even some rare fluxes i had been trying to get. not to be too mean i did leave him a pinch of salt.
---
yeah theres power saver and batteries included and with both of them the gatling laser suddenly becomes usable lol. it makes fusion cores weigh.03 each and doubles their output. keeping up with the ammo consumption can still be work a queen typically costs me 10 to 20 fusion cores. 2mm is also classed as an energy ammo even though it has kinetic damage it becomes super ammo efficent with a good rifle build
---
It would be nice if the card affected food &amp; water in the stash as well; I don't want to be carrying dozens of pepper and spices all the time.
---
I recommend using a gatling plasma. I have a bloodied 1* but it's absolutely devastating. I have tse variants of most heavy weapons but damn the lmg and the .50 cal eat through ammo so fast.
---
sometimes in vats I'll be clicking away with my melee with full AP and it doesn't even move, not sure if there's a reason or it's a bug
---
I get what you said. But im just getting the general feel about the game from people that have played it.
---
Not to be harsh or personal, but I see many posts talking about decorating player homes. Why don't you play The Sims if you want to have so many option available to you? Fallout may not be the place to really get in depth with the color of your walls, in my opinion of course.
---
Yeah well...tough luck then :) encrypted VPN is known to be slow.
---
Wrong post meow?
---
Yeah it can be confusing as weight display always indicates weight when you carry it. But anything you place in stash reverts back to original weight as your weight reduction perks no longer affect it. As far as bugs go, not very high on priority list. So it may never get addressed. Everything actually works, it's just the visual indicator for weight.
---
Are you even playing the same game as the others? :D Imo just ignore that overpriced bs
---
You can't get improved repair kits from the atom store, only basic ones.  Basic repair kits only repair to 100%, improved ones repair to 150%.
---
Yes I heard it's the best for damage out put
---
i would love to use LMGs more (loved it since beta), but using it regularly is not viable because of the ammo cost.
---
i have two that i keep on me:
---
-an ultracite one (current one is furious, trying to replace with zealot) to help melt the queen when we dont have enough DPS to finish her otherwise
---
-a vampire one for easy healing. i might actually make it ultracite too because the crafting amounts for ultracite .308 are like triple what they are for regular .308
---
Naïvely one might think of looking near Flatwoods, no?
---
Why yes!  With a deep ravine, which I'll throw in as a bonus!
---
Not a bad idea!
---
I played 900 hours and had 3000 loot drops, logged more than 2000 with two different builds.
---
1. No, however, certain enemies and laggy servers make a legendary enemy not drop any legendary/drill/syringe if you attack it (or kill) it too early. Sheepsquatches are especially prone to this.
---
2. No. Seems that each patch changes the ratio. Before patch 8, I got 40% chance for a 3\* to drop a 3\* item. Between patches 8 and 8.5, this went down to 20% but the the number of 3\* enemies went up to 25%. After 8.5, I get 30% 3\* drop but only 15% chance of encountering a 3\* enemy. [See my loot drop log for further details](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtrJVYcwz60aokD5QenY6lhMpHgiIyYQQGq_XgKtJz0/edit#gid=1724794853).
---
3. Well, it depends on how [fast you can farm them](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtrJVYcwz60aokD5QenY6lhMpHgiIyYQQGq_XgKtJz0/edit#gid=197047020). **Whitesprings** is quick but pretty low on 3\* drops. **Harper's Ferry** used to be good, now it's hit or miss. The **SBQ event** could be a nice source if you concentrate on the mobs (and the queen glitches out). **West Tek** is decent but hit or miss lately. **The Burrows** can be good, but the layout is annoying and mobs tend to spawn based on the previous visitors.
---
4. Yes, you only get lvl 40 Mole Miners. I stopped farming that event exactly for this reason (and also the 1-shotters).
---
That would solve the 1v1 but not the 4v1
---
1, can stay in the workshop the other three will cross map to kill you.
---
I can already see myself having to change the perks to avoid getting out of the PA. How does that make my life easier, anyway?
---
Sit naked in front of Vault 76 and go for a coffee. That pretty much gives the idea.
---
I know that feeling.
---
Brought a Ultracite Gatlig Laser Mod.
---
Thought yeay I can finally mod my Gatling Laser to a Ultracite Version... Just to find out it was a mod *for* the ultracite Gatling Laser. Wich I didnt even got once in the Game (Level 150+)
---
If you liked the following things from fallout 4, then 76 might be a good time for you.
---
* Survival mode
---
* Crafting guns and armor
---
* Modding guns and armor
---
* Exploring the map
---
* Building settlements (Not including managing settlers)
---
* Searching for Junk and Loot in a apocolyptic setting
---
* Character building
---
* The Gun-play (shooting/punching people/things)
---
* The Lore
---
* Stories told by holotape or by observing an area closely. \\
---
* Power armor
---
Fallout 76 adds Multiplayer, as well as some new game systems, but feels very much like fallout 4 to me.  If anything on the list I've made interests you, I'd wager you'll have fun with it, assuming you're playing on PC and have a powerful enough computer  
---
Protip: Buy a game key off a site if you can, and if it's out of your country just use a VPN to activate it with Bethesda. I bought one for $20 Canadian, was entirely worth it.
---
My dumbest purchase was the 70€ Version of this Game and that dropped to 30€ one Week Afterwards .. I had a good time, but that was Just scammy Shit from BGS...
---
I have an Anti armor explosive combat shotgun and an Instigating double barrel explosive and find myself favoring heavily on the instigating. whether or not that continues after patch 9 we will see.
---
That does not say anything at al.. I was wondering is the LS per character or account? Since you can't give it to other players, you can't move it between your toons with the help of a friend.
---
I haven't looked at it that way. For the cost of 1 Violet and 1 Ultracite I triple the yield... and the main purpose would be the SBQ.
---
Thank you for pointing that out, I was blinded by my hate-hate relationship with Ultracite ammo.
---
Food for thought :)
---
The fanboys will downvote you!!  Don't forget once you've read everything there's no new lore left to find.  The quest lines they have added have been subpar
---
Bear.  Unless you need to strip off to delete your pics.
---
What's with the pseudo white knight bullshit concerning people who make turret camps near white-springs? Seems childish to me.
---
I live in Puerto Rico, after we got hit by Hurricane Maria...well it was all different, the once proud palm trees had been thrown about like paper, signs we torn as if picked up like toothpicks, houses had lost their roofs, electricity poles laid on the road with cables strewn all about, there was debris and flooding everywhere, but the first thing everyone did upon coming out was check on all their neighbors and see if they were alright and needed something, everyone gathered to clear a large tree that had fallen near the entrance of the road, people cleared a block sewer to allow the flood waters to drain, it was a lot like in-game when you get random strangers helping you suddenly or gifting you things because they see you need them.
---
Alright cool. Thanks for the quick response
---
Well, if only they truly gave us a "shitton of atoms just for playing".  Not this 10 atoms for leveling up 3 times.  That takes quite a while late game, and is not worth the reward.
---
Atoms are no longer given graciously.  It's a slog to earn any for the items you want.
---
Even with all the atoms given out, you wouldn't be able to get everything in the shop.  Truly disgusting
---
np! it costs fluorescent though, which is great because whitesprings still gets nuked sometimes :D
---
I found an emea code for 8e on a site, that i dont need a vpn for.
---
Oopsie... jumping to conclusions again...
---
Thanks for the heads up :)
---
Funny that I have more fluorescent than I do violet so... bonus :)
---
Pew pew was a laser pistol in Fallout New Vegas, not a rifle in 3 or 4. 
---
You get it once you hand 50 star bottle caps to Festus in the Sunset Sarsaparilla Headquarters.

Yes I heard it was the best I just remembered nukershin having a 300% Unarmed buff too so might swap cards around to fit in a drunk first style.

is the keyboard a full wallpeice? if so i had similar issues with wall placement and had to put a floor/foundation on the other side of it. then when i stood on the new piece it would let me snap the wall how i wanted it to go. i just deleted the floor after.
---
pain in the ass just to make a wall work but hopefully this will work for you
---
If you can get the plans for heavy leather armor it's the best.  You can make and scrap ordinary leather armor to learn most of the mods (not deep pocketed unfortunately).
---
Studded heavy leather armor has almost as much DR as heavy combat armor, doesn't look ass and has way, way better ER.
---
I like to drop 1 salt when I loot someone who was being a bitch.
---
She gets her own loot in Containers and enemies one of you kills.
---
I've run out of:
---
Steel
---
Wood (!)
---
Oil
---
Fibre Optics
---
Lead (like, every time I play)
---
Plastic
---
... in fact, more or less everything.
---
Environmental storytelling isn't enough of a selling point for me but I'm happy you have a game to enjoy. I was okay with the game for a while but it feels like a chore now because of the inventory management, I almost made it to lvl50 but lost interest.
---
Yeah I saw a post ages ago, with a psa about it lol
---
PC players being older on average might have to do with it.
---
I'm sure that lesson will stick with him.
---
What platform coz if your on PC add me up username:jackamish
---
I’m on pc
---
Well yeah if you wanna add me then go ahead dud
---
More like tse shotguns instakilling everything
---
I had a 3* break on me last night, strait up gone. I'm on xbox.
---
Put walls on either side and place it from the inside, i think thats how i made it be my bitch
---
Yeah i feel like it's gonna get nerfed as well so now is not a good time to buy that armor
---
Fallout is a pc game first, just because it is ported to console as well doesn't mean we on pc should be forced to use voice chat, likewise consoles shouldn't be forced to use text chat. They should offer both like every other online pc game.
---
No official source, just going by the activity on discords for PC players.
---
Yeah I don't think it broke or it would still be in my inventory. It's not in my stash either, just really kinda bums me out lol.
---
If you go into it thinking you would like more Fallout but don't expect a revolution in gameplay, graphics or much in the way of story other than go here, do that - then I think it is great.
---
Agreed. I can’t seem to find any screws.
---
What do you mean? You keep saying no one is referencing dupes, yet you did, which is why I'm bringing it up.
---
&gt; Fallout 76 is not a proper Fallout game
---
It's not a Fallout RPG, it is a Fallout game.
---
If your on pc visit a website called g2a you can get it for about 10 pounds (don't know hoe much in euros or dollars)  if you purchase it that way and you don't like it there's not much money spent on it
---
You think it’s a mule account?
---
I had let my condition go. It broke mid battle, when I got to a work bench I was missing my right arm.
---
I think items randomly disappearing from your inventory is a lit more than a minor bug man. Heard about this a lot actually. Genuinely think that would be the last straw for me if I ever lost any of my end game gear this way. Crap like that shouldn't be happening...
---
Toy cars, desk fans, etc. You can find a list of which item gives you what or just tag it for search so when you look at items in game it'll show a magnifying glass for that junk type.  Sugar grove, and other places can be farmed for them.
---
What the hell is a Long Pew anyways?
---
BRO!
---
First ever purchase back in the BETA was the same thing!
---
Thought it was some kind of long rifle or something lol!
---
Just Wanting to make sure you’ve checked the rename button. Repair go under there from now on. 
---
Idk how much you play or been playing. 
---
If not, could be a bug then. 
---
GL m8
---
To be fair, plans really could have had small pictures of the things that they give you attached to them.
---
Scorchbeast only need to land if you are only players that only use melee.
---
Yeah been farming sugar. Just seems after this last patch, screws are in high demand.
---
In solidarity we stand, Long Pew's at the ready boi!
---
Over on r/Fallout somebody accused me of not being a "Fallout fan" because I said I liked *some* Fallout games.  Went seriously quiet when  asked him whether he liked Fallout:BOS.
---
They felt pretty rare to me for a while, I'm at the point where I'm stocked up so they aren't an issue for me at the moment. 
---
Now Ballistic fiber, that's a resource I can't keep in stock and even rarer than screws
---
100% this!
---
The thing that got me excited about a MP fallout title was the idea of co-op gameplay in the fallout universe. Just the thought of having friends with me that can actually help me in a fight instead of NPCs (who most of the time are pretty useless) got me so pumped for this title.
---
The mechanics are not really suited for PVPing: 
---
let's be honest the movement is pretty clunky, secondly the hit reg is not really accurate and simply locking on to someone with VATS does not require much skill.
---
IMO the game needs a HC mode (like we've had in previous titles) but one that's a bit tougher to survive on your own, and would require a group to survive.
---
You would have to rely on the help from other survivors out there to help you survive this harsh environment.
---
This would be the ultimate PVE experience which the fallout environment is prefect for.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!! That's awesome. That's really made me smile.
---
If/when they “correct” workshop PvP then it would be useful. 
---
Overall, workshop PvP is imbalanced. Even if Legendaries didn’t exist it’s still broken.  And (certain) legendaries break PvP full stop.  
---
Assassins as a weapon buff is fine, you can only use 1 weapon and 1 10% buff is fine. Multiple 15% and 8% Damage debuffs not fine, even before stacking.
---
You are definately not the first! I bought a nuke silo status disc for much money. I had it allready. Can't sell it...
---
Consoles are way less expensive, so there's a greater chance it's just some rando kid being scummy. I'm on PS4 and can't imagine sinking a good grand into a PC, and then choosing to be a jerk with it
---
So what your saying is, it’s impossible for it to break permanently
---
I’m xxvillain19 by the way
---
True enough.
---
It should not be possible for it to. No
---
Why would you destroy someones camp in the first place?
---
being able to machine stuff from raw materials would be great.
---
Bottom line dont build there.
---
Okk cool
---
In adventure mode BTW*
---
Wow, way to go with the controversial opinions.
---
Fuckin ey!! Dude I hate the miserable P.O.S that do this..especially if your in adventure mode. Survival is one thing. But hell do your own work an grind like 95% of the people in the game..why so much hate, is I grinded for a good 3 or 4 weeks. Had all my junk mega high..I avoid events for this reason...but I seen a bunch of level 150 an up, there around the pylons. So I Went up started the event, seen no one was activating the pylons so I did. All 3, the whole event. I'd say about 5 minutes before the event was done, an the imposter was near death, I took a wrong turn around a building an ran into a bunch of robots an lasered sheep. He kills me. So I spawn in, an a level 175 is looting my bag. I literally got nothing...at the time I was level 78..I called the dude out. He said shut the f%&amp;k up an quit being a bitch. Yes, yes Im being a bitch cause lazy ass players do this shit here..wanna steal peoples loot, go to survival...but most of us know why they won't do that...if you didn't kill me you don't deserve the loot. However, The other fine people at the event over heard me an this ass over chat, an started to drop me there junk. It didn't get me back to where I was. But nonetheless I got some junk back..
---
I usually leave pacifists mode on, so grief baiting attacks causes me no damage. Unless I respond.
---
Yeah man I just didn't want to come off as bitching about it. For me i guess it's more like oh this sucks, might as well say something in case it's happened to other players. I did submit a big report, i'm just waiting to hear back at this point
---
I like the idea, expect the dj part, i dont want to hear some annoying unlikeable guy like mr new vegas or travis, killed travis in fallout 4 just to have him replaced with the little kid, what a mistake, he was even more annoying
---
Don't feel bad, right after the beta there were a good handful of post titled "PSA long pew is NOT a gun"
---
Classic Bethesda.
---
This is what Survival should be, and occasionally is, however, it appears that Bethesda’s marketing (and to a degree the dev team) doesn’t really know what the majority of its player base wants, and with “Battle Royale” being so popular they are trying to get their own slice of that pie, not really realising that most of the players don’t play/ buy in to Fallout for that experience.
---
I see, Thank you
---
Mate...if one of my unyielding sentinel pieces disappeared, I'd be doing more than bitching. I'd probs be shopping for a new TV because I threw my controller through it ha! Bitch away because it's a joke that this stuff happens.
---
U sure? Looked up that name and couldn't find it ure Bethesda account username yes?
---
I’m super sorry, for some reason I came back to my base and it was next to some meat pile
---
Skyrim still crashes with 8 years of patching under its belt. That's a single player game playing to the engines strengths.
---
Sorry to say, but crashes are here to stay.
---
I’m sorry I found it next to a meat pile in my base even though I was in watoga
---
what weapon do you use
---
Feel for ya man! Think most of not all of us have been there. So frustrating and a huge waste of time and resources. It can put a fast stop to a endgame challenge.
---
You think after half a year this would be fix. And by now it should be!
---
Not really, it's possible the robot mentioned had some kind of insider knowledge. Plus, there's the section talking about the world being over, "This part of the world is over. Might as well be the entire world from the looks of it.", which sounds more like a reaction to the time immediately after the war, not years later given the world part.
---
Stealing another players loot after they've practically solo'd the queen with their bloodied melee build need's to be a hostile action against that player, or give them a bounty!
---
I got 1k steel 100 ballistic fiber and 30 bulk aluminum off some moron who fought me at watoga station the other day
---
Try capital For both X? I’ve sent you a friend request
---
Completely true but having just gain 30 weight in my stash by taking out the glowing Mass it's for me a quality of life thing. At least now I know I will just have to carry all the stuff on me!! 😄👍
---
I just mean it shouldn’t happen, as it seemed that reply was some sort of justification i.e  ‘Oh it’s called latency so it’s fine’ 
---
Fair point though the game is unique, awesome and ambitious with the engine. I just really want melee to actually work for me (and it seems many others)
---
Congrats!  Level 74 here.  So, I will see you soon.  😊
---
Is this all you do lmao, the like 3 most recent comments in your post history are all about buying a bike with the money you earned from duping and selling on eBay, are you that sad of a person that you have to go into subs and tell them they’re playing a bad video game and be an all around dick-head?
---
Let me guess. You main melee?
---
Yeah, thankfully.
---
While I understand this, they can still query peoples inventory so they could estimate the total amount of potential scrip with or without people trading in.
---
I'd day the good and the bad almost perfectly balance each other. If you liked the combat / building from 4 and long for a multiplayer version of that, with stripped out story / NPCs and interesting quests, etc, it's pretty serviceable.
---
Got 200 hours out of it before getting super burnt out, so there is something there that's fun.
---
Not bad for £13. Wouldn't have paid a penny more though.
---
I used to run that game with over 200 mods installed... Gave up on the load order and accepted my game was liable to crash every 20 minutes.
---
I'm playing Fallout 76 on PS4, and my game is liable to crash every 20 minutes... Fortunately, I need not worry about saving, but the loading time is truly horrendous.
---
I’ll see how much I have in a couple of hours.
---
When I see those I always say it’s a dumpster fire and suggest they stay out still.
---
Why encourage others to compete for the same stuff you want lolz
---
Note I’ll probably get hate for this but, people who publicly ask the internet, rather than  take the initiative and decide for themselves, I really have no compassion for.
---
If  you spent the money to buy the game, then make the effort to play the game.
---
will a vampire's hunting rifle do? /s lmao
---
Meh go ahead I will still be playing I think many of you are overreacting tbh
---
Then stop playing??
---
Haha! I feel ya. I have lost hours of progress spread over various Bethesda games because it crashes while I've spent an hour wandering about.
---
I implemented my own "Save every 5 - 10 minutes" policy with Bethesda single player to stop me ripping my hair out.
---
&gt; The worst crime BSG committed was not controlling the major economy breaking cheaters early in the game. 
---
This.
---
When I find a bag of junk on the ground I feel it’s only proper to guard it.  I have no idea who the owner is, but I’ll stand there next to it hoping the person returns.  
---
When I find them in low level zones, I’ll add a few stimpacks.  
---
I don’t need anyone’s junk.
---
While I would never take another's loot.  It's part of the game mechanics and if your bloodied build means you die all the time maybe it's time to think that build isn't the best thing to fight the Queen with it or events in a big group of people.
---
Maybe make a build were you don't die?
---
What platform?
---
&gt; A game where China 
---
nukes the US
---
Well I have to respectfully disagree because lighting changes the mood of everything and I enjoy that. But I alternate between grinding and ambient exploration :)
---
Am I the only one that heard this  in my head with the Enclave voice?
---
Of course but my characters all now survive on Inert Flux, Purified Water is just used for diluted Sims and Radaway or for change to soak up the last of a vendor's caps.
---
Stealth Commando is powerful itself, but when you combine it with bloodied, you can take out a scorchbeast in less than 10 bullets each time. I once took out a scorchbeast in four 5.56 rounds while having adrenaline damage and being a low health
---
Hey, it's in the game. At least until tomorrow.
---
&gt; For example internet historian recently made a video on 76 
---
Did he?  Or did he make a video about the *launch* of FO76, vast chunks of which were about the various merch "outrages" and not about the game at all.
---
I be interesting myself. At 1 point whenever you logged in as long as you didn't do that specific daily in 24 hours you had a chance of getting it. Then a couple months ago it seemed like they switched it to one random daily every  24 hours per region on the map. That was what I initially thought until a couple days ago I got two at the same time, the hemlock holes grilling 1 and the hunt master 1, which now leaves me confused as to how exactly they work as well
---
AYE AYE CAPTIAN!
---
With the addendum that I have got nothing from the mire in months
---
The FO4 walls were supposed to be more than 200 years efter the war. Walls just reused from FO4 are a bit too srcappy looking just 25 years after the war and a few years after the last inhabintants died. On the other hand, the warehouse set apparently looks right for todays Appalachia...
---
Nothing like wasting 50-100 plastic because you forgot you were holding bulk to sell.  
---
I just sigh and head to the cafeteria.
---
The fixer is a great gun, I wouldn't disagree, but it isn't bloodied, so it is nothing compared to my bloodied handmade rifle in terms of damage. By the way, this bloodied stealth commando build is so powerful that I can still take down scorchbeasts in five-eight 5.56 rounds despite my bloodied handmade rifle being level 35
---
Extreme overreacting
---
Thanks for all your thoughts guys and gals. My first nuke was so typical of this game. The One of Us quest bug held me up (the holo tape wouldn't work) so I ground out levels until 120 then finally launched a nuke. What a high! The power! The devastation! The... crash to desktop. Oh well.
---
These pics are fantastic ! It's joy to see big part of the ppl in this game helping each other to complete events &amp; challenges.
---
Most saine people will keep playing the rest can go to anthem lol im just sitting here with my 200% repair and armour and weapon perks for less degrade
---
I felt the same way earlier this year when someone took 100 wood from me because I was stupid enough to carry it all with me instead of leaving it in my stash box 
---
So I remind all of you gathers out their if you are gunna go into battle put all of your junk in your stash box so you don’t lose it to someone
---
This happened to me on PC, but with pieces of my power armor. The "dupes" all poofed when I relogged.
---
Hope they 'rebalance' assassin and leave Sentinel alone.
---
As a pure PvE player I am a bit weary of being in the receiving end of all these PvP related 'rebalances'.
---
For me I'm thinking I couldn't be bothered dealing with all the crap with trading it any other way.
---
For other people maybe it just doesn't suit thier build feel the same
---
Some servers are better, that's for sure.
---
I believe the last update buffed legendaries.
---
Last night was the first time in ages I've seen 3  3* super mutants at westek &amp; then found another couple at the resort &amp; then at least another 5 1* or nil stars as well in that one run.
---
Unfortunately didn't drop great items though, most seemed lower level :(
---
And the found they couldn't do it, which is why they gave the project to a whole new team after FO4 came out.  Bethesda Austin can only have been working on FO76 since 2015, and probably later than that because in 2016 they were working on Doom.
---
I doff my hat to you sir.
---
Meh... Whitespring lite.
---
If the devs let you build there, who are you to police it? Like, blow up other people's camps if you like, but don't pretend you're on some high horse because of it. That's why I said it's childish, its easy to avoid it if it bothers you, and you're clearly taking offense to it rather than just getting a long with your life fam.
---
Yes it’s not supposed to break permanently. Sry
---
You can already teleport any where it just cost caps
---
Nice! Do you use the lever gun to take down trash mobs and the bloodied combat rifle to take down scorchbeasts? From what I've learnt (currently level 174 - probs learnt a lot :)), lever guns are best for taking down trash mobs like mutants and ghouls (got an instigating lever gun lvl 45 - very good for this) and combat and handmade rifles are better at taking scorchbeasts because of the high fire rate and DPS
---
Get glowing mass, hardened mass, and high radiation fluids from blast zones. Mix with 10 cobalt FLUX 10 times at a chemistry station. Do that 5 times per color...on PS4.
---
Sometimes this can be a blessing in disguise when you're looking to move and you really don't wanna have to spend the caps
---
 Place another floor or foundation down then place the wall facing any direction you want.
---
Your loss good by good riddance
---
I though the Excarvator was the signature armor for 76.
---
Ultracite Armor is just a slightly touched up T-51.
---
Honestly, people with turret camps near whitesprings think the same thing about you as you do about them. They don’t like people just grinding ghouls out right there for XP and it’s a slightly effective way to combat it.
---
Outside of the clubhouse it seems like such a drag to run all those long distances on boring golf fairways while everyone else is chasing a diminished number of glowing ghouls. Was a great way to power level and grab loot for levels 50-100 though.
---
If it takes 5 days (earliest video of a SBQ kill I can find, so that may not even be the first) from release for the endgame boss to be killed in an MMO, then it is the developers problem. No content is unlimited, but when they promise that the game will last for 10 years, it feels like they have no idea what amount of content is required. I'm still playing it and enjoying it but I have no end of gripes with missed opportunities, or the fact that it feels like it's coming out of BETA now, as opposed to release day.
---
nice brand new shitposting account, can't you be a 1/10 troll elsewhere? or at least grow the balls to do it on your main account
---
Oh how original you must be proud
---
But since you probably don't care I've played for hundreds of hours and have not paid a cent past the original purchase
---
Warframe is still massively pay to win also I can repair my armour to 200% with defense bonus for free by playing the game
---
/u/valseek plz
---
Yes.
---
Makes it 10x better too.
---
I'm guessing that nukes will still destroy camps. 
---
It requires a lot more effort to drop a nuke than it does to bash some walls, so I'm guessing devs didn't really take into consideration that someone might spend 45 minutes in a silo just to destroy someone else's camp. I mean WE thought of it, but that doesn't mean they did.
---
Oh ok
---
Some people don't like it when people build camps of turrets near spawn points to farm exp and loot, and rather than just server hop to avoid it, or just ignore it since there's tons of farming areas, they dispense "Justice".   
---
It's just children getting upset because they feel like it. I don't use Turret camps but the animosity toward them feels unjustified.
---
Of course yes, silly me. Orbital Strikes were just as good. Allegedly.
---
If it happens I will get outraged now it’s nothing and your just fear mongering an makeing stuff up
---
Yeah, I love this community btw! And the in-game chat mod helps immensely, there's always someone who needs something or has something to offer (SBQ fights, other global events, spare resources for people who need them free of charge, you name it) and everyone is so friendly that it creates quite a pleasant experience overall. I don't even play the game much these days, just doing dailies and weeklies hoarding atoms, but it's always nice to hang out with people who just have pure fun playing the game -))
---
I haven’t spent a single cent, got multiple skins for weapons and armor, lots of camp stuff – all from the atom shop. People create their own problems when there are non to complain about.
---
Yup, failed Encrypted twice -- one time somebody else started it but nobody but me came, even the person who started it had gone.
---
One time I started it, one other person came and stood around doing nothing.
---
Looks like I'm going to have to overcome my social anxiety again and look at some way of coordinating this.
---
Stop making shit up
---
Here's the problem:
---
They need to aqcuire the license for the song they want to play. You don't buy general licenses, you buy them for a specific use or period of time. Like: I buy the licence to a song to be played in my commercial which will be aired for 2 years in the US of America. Or: I wanna buy a license for your recording of a song to be inlcuded indefinetly in a vdieo game sold worldwide. Those deals are more complex of course, Behtessda is probably only paying for a sold copy, not a flat number of items, and is paying a certain percentage of the selling price or a certain price range. Like if Beth sells the game full price it's x% for the license, if they sell the game in the price range 20-30$ its half-x%. Something like that
---
Bethesda payed for those licenses, and we payed Bethesda with the money for the game.
---
If Bethesda now adds more titles to the game, the would have to pay the license owner, but they would not receive additional money from us, as we have already payed. The same is true if they would offer a 10-song-apck in the atom store, as most players don't buy atoms, but earn them in-game. So again Beth would have to pay for the license, but would receive only a fraction money from us.
---
So the answer is: No, very unlikely. 
---
Maybe they'll sell a song dlc which you can only bux ith hard currency, but other than that I don't think so.
---
And alternative would be to record songs which copyrights have expired with no-name, hired artists, but they would not be the recording you already know.
---
Anyone seen anyone with a base here?
---
Maybe Bethesda will release skins ofthe player vending machine on the atom shop like they did with everything else.
---
A vault tec themed player vending machine.
---
I don't think Sentinel is healthy in the PvP or PvE meta. Standing still and not moving while being immortal isn't balanced, unless you can provide a reasonable argument to why it would be.
---
I agree and disagree with this. I'm totally on board that this game is going to be great. But looking at other MMOs that I've played (in particular Wildstar) the content was more vast and varied, and there was also a lot more difficult content, which meant people were striving to get there. Wasn't for everyone, but that said, when there's enough content to get you to endgame that you're still satisfied having not done the endgame was good. 
---
Whereas with FO76, I haven't felt fully satisfied with anything other than the world building. Which is phenomenal, but only one part of a very large game.
---
TLDR: There should have been more content, or harder content (or both) from the get go. But there eventually will be enough
---
he also has to launch a nuke. For cobalt, around white springs and white springs station. violet, i forgot where
---
There's a SB at Morgantown airport so you should have seen one before you get the inoculation quest.
---
I farmed Nuke plants for the plans but I no longer do. They have few enemies and rarely legendaries (except Poseidon where there can't be legendaries due to location and level restrictions). I nuked Monongah and encountered a couple of legendaries outside and inside, but they don't respawn so was not really worth it.
---
Back in the early days, when the damage to initiate PvP wasn't null nor properly capped and TSEs were the rare weapon of the Gods, a low level guy attacked me out of the blue, shooting me repeatedly with an embarrassment of a gun. I killed him and found a huge amount of materials in his junk bag, which I of course claimed as victor of the fight. I had just gotten it properly stashed when a different character with the same name comes along, attacks me and two shots kills me before I even manages to shoot back. He stands over my body for a while, but of course nothing happens since I just stashed the new junk. He then starts following me around the map and pleads to me via voicechat to return his junk since he was on his mule, which he forgot, and attacked me thinking he was on his main. 
---
So... he killing me with a über-weapon and a broken system to take my stuff would have been ok, him attacking with the wrong toon was not, and I should return his stuff. I gave him a thumbs up emote, blocked him and jumped server.  Good times!
---
they need to specify exactly what a plan gives you, they have a inspect screen for a reason, or like you could be able to "READ" or "STUDY" a plan
---
to be honest, and i hate this as it doesnt help, i really cant remember if it had deluxe or not infront of it.. the vendor was selling a ton of legendary at super low price (medic crossbow for 12 caps for example) so my focus was elsewhere
---
Harper's Ferry, West Tek, The Burrows, Fissure Prime and Watoga Clinic to name a few beyond Whitesprings. [This table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtrJVYcwz60aokD5QenY6lhMpHgiIyYQQGq_XgKtJz0/edit#gid=197047020) may help you evaluate the options.
---
Yes there is and buy sell threads have recently been named from here
---
Addiction model wtf are you talking about? There are not loot boxes or gambling also just get free repair kits which are better or just repair to 200% for free by playing game with added bonus defense only by playing the game lol but if you want to quit go ahead snap your disc in half good bye
---
Obsidian doesn't hold any exclusive rights to the songs they used. Bethesda could re-license the recording for their use very easily
---
I had a weird experience last night. Whitesprings was seemingly overrun with spawns -- the usual ghouls and such but also two honey beasts, two deathclaws, two scorchbeasts, etc.  
---
Another player in power armor (around level 100) was also in the area, and we were working them together. Then he died between the maintenance shop and the gold club. I stood guard over his bag as his body blinked out, but then I got killed too, right next to him. When I respawned and got my gear, I didn't check the bag contents until I got back to my stash. When I did, I noticed that I'd picked up stuff I didn't have before -- black titanium, etc.  
---
Around that time, the other player sent me a message on X-Box thanking me for not taking his loot. I messaged back and told him I think I might have, actually, and offered to travel back to him and hand it over. He insisted I didn't, and that his was there.  
---
So...either the game gave \*both\* of us his loot, or we picked up each other's bags.  
---
First time I've had this happen. Don't know if it's a glitch or what, but...
---
Do you actually play the game or just want to be outraged about something?
---
I’ve seen some silly stuff where folks are leaving their X01 power armor unattended while using the crafting stations at WS.
---
I seriously struggled NOT taking it but  decided to server hop instead.
---
If you’re doing the same thing, consider this your final warning.
---
Yes redo it. I always tell people, every time you rebuild, you get better.
---
That still costs money. Thus why they haven't.
---
Yeah you're right bloodied melee builds should stay out of the fight so all the weak players can shoot at her constantly for 30 minutes till she flies away, seems legit
---
Yeah I agree with you. I ran a bloodied build an then switched to a sniper guy...the bloodied is way too strong. In general that perk tier needs to go away. Its bullshit on survival mode, an it is on adventure. To much of the game is boring when everything takes one hit to kill. Idk about you, but I like atleast a challenge when I'm runnin N gunnin. Dont think its right. Especially, with these events that are supposed to be a challenge..
---
Queen of the hunt popped for the first time in awhile for me yesterday.  So did organic solution.  Hadn’t seen either since I can’t remember when.  Only thing that was different was I did the Red Rocket daily before they popped.  Not sure if that helps.
---
I agree with this. Also, the SBQ poachers are up there with these guys. Like, if you don't wanna contribute toward the fight, then piss off. Atleast they could kill the enemies killing me, whilst i am putting in 3k rounds of 5mm. Mr level 190 sat there crouched taking pop shots every now and then.
---
And it can stay a part of the game mechanics but there needs to be repercussions for it.
---
Well you saw it. I wrote the long comment cause I was bored
---
I have seen a pattern, at least in the nuked Whitesprings. It often happens when the last wave of Glowing Ghouls spawn before the radiation goes away, right before all those pesky eyebots spawn at lvl 1 instead. Often if I get there and some flowers are still mutated but the radiation is gone there is often that wave of almost all legendary Glowing Ghouls. And then, if I do another lap, the eyebots spawn instead. 
---
This is purely an anecdotal observation, but it has happened more than once.
---
I'm saying that no one has even referenced any current duping glitch still in the game, which is why I'm saying that there isn't one.
---
How much clearer can I get?
---
I think you over estimate your contribution. You do know the health bar lowering is the damage everyone is doing not just you.
---
Maybe you shouldn't go into battle carrying a heap of stuff you will actually miss if it means that much to you seems logical to me
---
Bethesda who ships pre-order items =/= Bethesda game devs  
---
Just an FYI before the lynch mob starts trying to argue the game is flawed because they didn't get a dog statue.
---
I think your problem is that you're comparing FO76 to MMOs. This is not an MMO. It is an action RPG with online elements tacked on. If you compare this game to other fallout titles, it will take just as long, if not longer, to "beat" this game compared to the others.
---
Lol go ahead quit your loss good by good riddance gonplay anthem
---
r/falloutlore might be able to help.
---
I play late at night. have noticed, if your the ONLY one there, there's maybe 3 others on the server,..... the drop rate gets way better. Still a load of junk mind you.
---
I would very much welcome the removal if sentinel / Cavalier and Blocker together with an overhaul of the Armor Perk Cards.
---
Maybe add stuff like stagger (dmg over time instead of directly) mechanics to cards and maybe stuff like disease resist / limb dmg resist to armor.
---
I’d love to use weight reduce or fall dmg armors if it werent for the almost mandatory need of sentinel
---
you are stealing someone elses junk so unless you killed that player and claim that loot as a reward then it should be marked as stealing and the player should get a wanted status, if people want to play as raiders then they should be marked as much
---
How the fuck does no one know what a pew is? That's really sad.
---
I'd love seasons but not in the pubg/fortnite sense and more in the "new set of general game parameters like weather" meaning.
---
More ghouls in spring? More scorched in summer? Sure those seasonal mechanics sound fun. We'd maybe have a reason to use zealots items. Specific rewards for specific seasons? Let's hunt in the fall ... travel in the spring ... etc. ... with some related challenges.
---
No I don't think I agree, junk is the only thing you lose (asside from caps if from another player) if you die. The devs intended carrying large amounts of junk to be risky, and it is. The've even gone as far as to spell out that because death doesn't really have a down side, losing your junk is the only real punishment. It doesn't always happen, but sometimes it does. But I also don't carry around valuable junk I don't want to lose because "I don't have enough stash space".  
---
Also lore wise: You fuckin' died bud, your junk is forfeit to the other dwellers.
---
Music licensing is tricky. They may have rights for several songs (which is why they get repeated) but often times, the license is for a specific product/project or for certain use only.
---
One example is licensing for films. There are different usage rules for certain licenses that limit where a song can be used, and sometimes limits the length of the clip. It's much cheaper to get a song for a  trailer that is only 30 seconds long and is only used for promo than it is to put a full song in a commercially sold product.
---
If I want to "buy" usage rights for a song for a film, it's a lot cheaper to get the one that is only good for film festivals, but not for broadcast or distribution.
---
Long story short, it is unlikely that new music will ever be added to Fo76 just for economical reasons. It would not be profitable for them to license them to add to the game because the licence may be too expensive.
---
I think you're underestimating the damage I'm doing bro, my bloodied swing speed deathclaw gauntlet hitting for  over 2k damage with all relevant perks tears chunks off her and when I stop attacking her health ever so slowly ticks down from all the other player's.I killed her in 2 minutes yesterday and I estimate at least 70 percent of the damage was from me alone
---
 But it’s “pay to win” now and your not allowed to like it Bethesda lied to you and you must be outraged and upset all the time and go to every store and break every fallout 76 disc
---
You can kill Travis? And he's replaced? Interesting...
---
Had group of melee players rush in and kill enemy without allowing others to tag or just tag and fall back for others to kill. Change my light damage weapon for heavy gun and wiped out the enemy at a distance before the could. Went back to just killing after every body tagged when they left.
---
And I don't carry any stuff in with me dude, its all the flux that you get as a reward for the quest that's getting stolen, please get some perspective on the matter
---
Don't feel bad homie. Dis the same thing myself lol
---
They aren't the same ones. You can't craft with those.
---
Many people playing the game are not from english-speaking countries. The vocabulary for church-related stuff is so unimportant that noone learns them at school and in general communication they are hardly used. I've also learned about the word "pew" by similar mistake as OP. Hell, even in my native language there's a word for "pew" but it's so archaic and obscure that I can never recall it. For me it's simply a bench...
---
Check your effects tab for debuffs. The Rad Ant Lager gives +50 carryweight for 5 minutes and -50 carryweight when you get a mild hangover. In addition, some underarmors also break the PA carryweight calculation. Also see if you lost a leg if you had calibrated shocks.
---
Thanks. Now if you would be kind enough to point me towards the direction of such files. Download link or specific website would be highly appreciated.
---
Preacchhh
---
I've head this is true but man that unlock chance is super low!
---
the pictures are amazing, so why is the like-feedback on Imgur negative? Are people as the comment on that side suggest so much full of hate?
---
Dont let that stop you the perspective and the quality of the pictures are amazing
---
The fun thing is that these are the very same people that graced us with those essays. File under #iamentitledto.
---
 It bethsids bad game pay to win must delete game or break disc in half or your a shill your not allowed to enjoy the game any more Bethesda lies wahhhh
---
I met someone the other day in whitesprings who was OHKing all of th ghouls. He accidentally shot one of the robots and they killed him. I looted his stuff as a result.
---
He came back into whitesprings and shot me with his TSE rifle. He died by the explosion XD
---
AYE CAN’T HEAR YOUUUUUUU
---
They probably will. It'll still be like the skin for the stove. It's still a crappy looking pile of garbage, but in new shiny colours. I wish there would be a new model for the stove with the haning door fixed. I wish they would make a player vendor model with lockers without damage like the oned we can find plans for instead of the scrappy ones. Mostly I would like a vending machine like the ones at the trainstations.
---
Most who have mentioned this, my friends included, are American, or at least primarily English speakers.
---
Regardless of what context the word is used in, it's such a simple word that you should almost definitely have heard if you've ever been religious. Even if not, TV shows, movies, etc. should have definitely exposed you to the word.
---
It just doesn't make sense if you're a native English speaker.
---
Technically if he steals your loot, you are literally 'giving' a shit
---
AYE AYE CAPTAIN!!!

This was such a slog getting the wood.

I found it slightly quicker going to dried up river bed by Flatwoods, as it only counts per search, not how much you get.

I picked up a wanted level yesterday, (lock picked a safe in a farmhouse; didn't realize it was part of workshop, let alone an owned on). Went back to my base camp, took off my PA and put all the valuable junk in my stash while I waited for someone to come claim the caps. Dude showed up, (EpicAssasin?) and actually sent me a message that said, "Would you like to die for your sins?". Gave him the thumbs up. He didn't even take the the scrap I still had on me. How cool is that?!
---
She’s such a diva.
---
Stand by my statement of you guys datamined the code. Couldn't have been solved in under a few hours of reset, nice try.
---
Maybe.
---
As other people have suggested, use % incoming  damage reduction perk cards if you want some sort of protection. I've gone Berserker with full sneak attacks melee + ranged, chameleon, harder to detect at 75% but with no damage resistant at all. I also, sometimes, use the Garb of Mystery at lvl 15 and Eye of Rah to give another 20% harder to detect but with its 15 ballistic damage protection it does reduce my Berserker weapon damage by about 15%. You can walk / crouched around Whitesprings solo with ghouls still lying on the floor, one hit them, from about player lvl 35, (i did this using a Instigating fire axe) and move onto the next very easily. They even run past you to attack the rest of your team or someone else who makes too much noise.
---
its not the fact that the camp is where it is.Its when your turrets blow the shit out of everyone else in the single most public place on the map. so YES, others will get extremely miffed. If you can't understand that......................................................................................................

Definition from googlr:

(in an online game or community) a person who harasses or deliberately provokes other players or members in order to spoil their enjoyment.

Buy things for horrible prices at the company store.
---
&gt;You load sixteen tons, what do you get?

&gt;Another day older and deeper in debt
---
&gt;Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
---
&gt;I owe my soul to the company store
---
I am experiencing less random disconnects by now, certainly not after just one hour. I would strongly advise any casual newcomer or returning player against owning 2-3 workshops (or **any** workshop, for that matter) now, though, if they are unprepared for PvP, because you are just asking to be griefed (= killed out of nowhere, wherever you are on the map) by that.
---
DAE wish the plans included more info on what you were buying?
---
I dig this.
---
Also, I'm starting to do events because finally, at LvL 105, I've seen enough of the massive environment/game that I'm starting to get bored. Well, that and it takes you about a hundred levels to get your character up to where you are a couple hours into the previous Fallout games, (pretty sneaky business strategy Bethesda!).
---
I can see them capping the buffs from sentinal, I had a chest and a left leg on, a guy was hitting me repeatedly an everytime my health would just jump from about 10% to 30%. I moved a bit an he finally killed me.
---
The most effective builds I've seen are stealth based, I suck at stealth just don't have the patients, but some people have popped out of nowhere to quickly but me down with a few swipes from a gauntlet.
---
Both protection buffs and strength need a max cap. The only thing that should be putting out 700+ is a fat man.
---
This is beautifully poetic.
---
Peeeeeeeeeew peeeeeeeeeeew.
---
It doesn't make you invincible in any shape or form.
---
Stageer defeats sentinel so any mob that can stagger has already gotten past that. Most heavy hitting mobs do have means to stagger so rebalancing this for PvE is a solution looking for a problem.
---
Moreover the damage mitigation is not additive.
---
The first piece gives you a flat 15%, the second one however gives you 12.75%, the third one 10.84%, a fourth one 9.21% and the fifth and final one 7.83%, so even with five pieces the flat DM is 55.63%. Really nice flat DR but hardly immortality.
---
Is still a nice thing to have - and that is why I like it, because is a pain to get a 3\* armor of the kind one wants to roll all the prefixes one wants but when it happens is glorious - and because of the diminishing returns it invites to mix and match.
---
Cavalier (blocking, not sprinting) mixed with sentinel makes for a good combo when the shit hits the fan.
---
A way of balancing it would be giving more 'challenging' mobs means to stagger - and they did just that with the newly added sheepsquatch so at least the devs are doing their own thing rather than just blindly nerfing to appease the part of the community that just cannot think on ways to overcome the obstable and want everything to be beige for everyone.
---
point forward (at player) point at self do a finger slitting throat gesture and give two big thumbs up the icon above their head could be vault boy with X in his eyes giving a thumbs up
---
or two finger guns two the head that could also work
---
Please do not exchange all your LEGENDARIES!!! Please try to do no more than 3 and make sure to use test dummy legendaries first. That means Lvl 10 Regen Wood Chest piece
---
Lol, Last night I was almost out of fusion cores I had 25% on my last one. So I had to buy some to get me through farming power station work shops. 
---
I'm embarrassed to admit I bought 3 Plasma cores from the enclave thinking they were fusion cores. Then I'm wondering why I only have 1 left. Worst part is I don't even use plasma cores I have like 20 in my inventory. I won't make that mistake again.
---
Solid advice all around.
---
Scrip, like money, is an uncountable noun. "Scrips" means different kinds of scrip, not more scrip.
---
I'd say if your almost 100, then you never needed one, and still probably don't.
---
STAY FAR AWAY!!!
---
Try setting the game's processor affinity to 2-4 cores max.
---
I've heard this at least 5 times on the sub now. I just can't help but feel *some of them* are in it for that sweet karma
---
Can Camp mechanic send Mr. Prize bot to enemies? Because that would be awesome!
---
You are right. I'm not a native English, so...
---
You heavy mfr lol
---
&gt; When I see those I always say it’s a dumpster fire and suggest they stay out still. Why encourage others to compete for the same stuff you want lolz
---
Ok, but if you want Bethesda to keep the servers up one or two years from now, you shouldn't be doing that, you know. The game needs a healthy player base in order to succeed.
---
It's bad enough that whenever I dip my toe into Survival mode for the weekly legendary I'm almost always immediately in 2nd or 3rd position (meaning: visible on the map to the griefer that is at #1), because there are so few people on the servers (on PS4, can't speak for other platforms).
---
Yea, I don't understand what makes you think that their camp placement that isn't cheating is a reason to be so angry. Its populated sure, but its far from the only farming spot.   
---
The impact it makes on you is very small, and your outrage is disproportionate to the situation.
---
...and after selling it, complain to Bethesda it's all Bethesda's fault that they spammed selling things to a vendor. Even going so far as to say, yeah, I was just spamming and wasn't paying attention to a game I play so much I know this can happen.
---
Is that a bug? I keep doing that to people, their health drops to a sliver then magically regenerates faster than I can damage and I'm fucked
---
Not happening to me at all on console. Are you on PC and using mods?
---
100 percent agreed
---
That horrible sound explosive shotguns make. Sounds like something throwing gravel at a wall. *That* sound just pisses me off now because everybody and their mum uses it.
---
Lol :D
---
How did you start the Red Rocket daily?
---
I will keep saying this don't bring anything you don't want to lose. if your in adventure nobody can hurt you anymore unless you attack back, if you died that's your fault even if its a bs enemy attack. You need to be accountable for what your carrying. Minecraft has harder death mechanics.
---
I hope so, theres so many fusion cells and cores that i do not need!
---
It is not only holotapes and paper notes, even how things are arranged, for example: 
---
the unmarked church on the west side close to the farms/cementary. Close to altar there are lots of clean glasses upside down on a table, a large decanter and a pack of rat poison. If you examine the skelettons on the benches, you will notice an empty glass besides every one... :-/
---
The Fatman can't even output that!
---
Yeah I wish we could build turrets. Oh wait we can.
---
I dropped 1.3k caps on Power Armor Station plans and proceeded to finish building the legs on my excavator power armor 10 minutes later for the quest...
---
especially at the silos my game very frequently crashed. Every single one of them crashed for me, when unlocking the fears lasernet and regarding the endgamecontent it is very annoying
---
yeah hes replaced with the kid who sells water near the back of diamond city he has way less lines and keeps advertising his water
---
I mentioned the same thing once. It was kind of a shock seeing children.
---
Thanks for the kind words -)) I assume people who post comments like this are most likely the ones who never tried the game and just feel the urge to be rain on everyone's parade. Well, it's their funeral, I guess.
---
I have lots of fun playing it with my friends and I'm excited for the new content that's already around the corner -) So yeah, I'll proceed with making mods and lurking here for a little while -))
---
That’s Bethesda role not mine to keep their servers running. 
---
Longevity and sustainability value is defined by Bethesda’s willing to identify what their customers have, map solutions in the 1-3-5 year scale.
---
Me,  running my mouth isn’t going to persuade Bethesda to improve. 
---
Fwiw, I’m IT. Historically built and supported servers and workstations, and infrastructure. If Bethesda doesn’t constantly improve, another company will.
---
Was playing survival mode last night and 3-4 players were just killing each other over and over again.  I come over from farming ghouls at WS and some kid (sounded like he was about 12) was mic’d up talking all sorts of shit.  I get close and let 3-4 nuka grenades fly and he literally says “ha ha ha you missed me” and then 3 seconds later gets ganked and all I hear is “aw that sucked” 
---
I don’t know what’s worse - the fact he was mic’d up in survival mode or the play by play commentary.
---
I know you can build turrets. I just think it would be cool to also build protectrons. No need to be an ass about it
---
Agree here, I can't stand PvP but now solo two shot weapons and all non legendary effect explosives are all useless now due to how over nerfed both got!
---
i had the workbench freeze also several times.
---
I don't know why, but I find this hilarious.
---
I don’t think so, threads are a way to see what somebody has without having to check camps. Plans might be sold more on vending than Reddit though
---
I didn't " bring anything " they were my rightful flux rewards for practically killing the SBQ myself that some little weasel acquired because the fools didn't know how to launch the nuke properly and I died from the rads, i'm not asking for the stealing players loot to be removed ,I'm asking for a way to get it back, it's only fair
---
Nice, but not possible. What if you fill up your stash to the limit and then unequip the cards? People would use the cards to stash in, then switch the cards to something else while fighting, exploiting the system.
---
I personally don't like seasons. I'd like to keep my gear in survival. I already had to work hard enough for it.
---
Yeah I have 5 of them, but don’t use them as I can repair to 200%.
---
cant they add certain songs that are in the public domain for free almost all if not all the songs on the classic radio are public domain
---
Haha no
---
I think this is because of RNG. When you scrap you learn a mod and it's "known" but every time you scrap it still RNG's the next mod and doesn't omit learned mods. This makes it harder to learn new mods on weapons you have a lot of learned mods for because it's still rolling ones you know.
---
I think first Beth needs to add item for item trading. Take how Diablo 2 did it. Each player can add whatever items to the trade screen(money included), and when both players are happy they bother accept the entire trade and all items/money are swapped. 
---
After that we can find another item to use as currency
---
People that are not the best and brightest lived their lives in appalachia as normal as possible even in total nuclear radiation and they all died horrible ironic deaths. Hell they even needed to kill each other just because some animals went into full evolution mode and made some of their friends into red mush zombies that want to kill everything else that is not red and mushy.
---
Why are you getting downvoted? They hated him, because he spoke the truth.
---
speaking of, where do you find plans for the decon shower?
---
Happened to me this morning at the Golf Club.  I’m busting up ghouls inside and someone runs right through the front door trying to gank.  They got 1 hit on me and since I was fully adrenalined up I capped his ass with 2 shots.  Was sort of surprised as he or she was a lvl 150 ish.  But given my tank build you ain’t going to melee me.  Next time bring don’t bring a knife to a gunfight.
---
Lead belly + iron stomach = never worrying again
---
Just after a SBQ fight the other day, a couple of players managed to somehow kill me and my friend dispite the fact we were both Pacafist. This was adventure mode and we certainly didn't return fire to accept a dual. Still they stuck around to murder other players so we got that flux back with interest due to their stupidity!
---
You obs haven't used a bloodied or 2 shot
---
I didn't buy it, but I thought it was one also.
---
Funny u say that cause it was exactly this. No radiation but nuke flora and glowing ghouls. Then the eyebots.
---
The corpses of the Elderly couple in the scout tower overlooking the Cranberry Bog. Reading that note made me tear up.
---
Hi welcome to reddit!! My response is actually rather tame compared to some of the crap I see on here. It's just a little friendly sarcasm.
---
I assume the pink thing means missing texture.
---
Since this same pink error effects happens while I interact with the Hero of the Wasteland Statue.
---
Just repeating the only thing I hear in the community
---
Whats that bird thing in bioshock infinite called loved that boss lol
---
My two shot adrenal reaction Fatman would't even kill a lv 20 molerat, I don't have abloodied Fatman.
---
Only suitable for celebration fireworks, not for combat!
---
It is but here in a day I can script the loser stuff.
---
Found the dialog and its freaking hilarious https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDSmbE_kTjc
---
I agree that they should....but they likely won’t as they can’t monetise it / turn it into a revenue stream for themselves. 
---
The player vendor thing is on that path in that they take a 10% caps cut for every transaction.....that’s all ok until you later add in the option to buy caps / scrips using atoms or vice versa, and then things change....
---
Nice. I'm a little disappointed this doesn't happen to me more often because I do enjoy killing griefers and pests.
---
Then there's people like me who run both perks. 
---
...cause hording.
---
Yeah it sucks when you forget to stash your bulked junk. Been there done that. I've gotten into the habit of stashing immediately after bulking.
---
Song bird thats it remember now lol👍
---
Ballistic fiber is driving me mad. I feel like the game is designed for you to play only in PA due to the lack of ballistic fiber. There's only, like, 20 possible spawn locations all over the map, and it can't be farmed anywhere.
---
Also a pew is the name for a long bench often found in churches. You guys being stupid isn't a dev problem, funnily enough.
---
Losing junk is the ONLY bad consequence of death right now. In many ways you get a lot of positive effects from dying;  renewed health, loss of radiation, removed addictions etc. If we make death even less meaningless, ie even lesser chance of losing your junk, then what is the point? We could all just be immortal and the game pointless.
---
I’ve had situations where players have swooped in during a SBQ fight to grief for that very reason.  They know players are preoccupied fighting her and most likely are carrying a lot of flux or loot gained during the battle.  It’s totally annoying but no less annoying than some tool that sets up their turret camp behind the golf club.
---
This. This is the one where the guy said he woke up and she was gone but he kept watching the plants and all that even though he knew he was gone right?
---
If the cap limit stays at 25k this player vendor will mean almost nothing. Unless they add a global stash / cap transfer of some sort for ALTs...
---
Fastest way Bethesda could lower the insane prices on the top tier weapons is by making them drop more often. If they increase availability, prices would drop.  
---
Make three star monsters always drop three star legendaries!
---
&gt;  and they did just that with the newly added sheepsquatch so at least the devs are doing their own thing rather than just blindly nerfing to appease the part of the community that just cannot think on ways to overcome the obstable and want everything to be beige for everyone. 
---
There it is. Look man, I get that you like your build, but understand that it isn't balanced for most types of play in a game that is, even in adventure mode, supposed to have an element of pvp to it. When you're talking about how the community that just cant "Think on ways to overcome the obstacles" it really shows your bias. People aren't complaining that they aren't counter-able, they are complaining that if for example you happen to be a sniper build, and want to use sniper rifles in pvp, Sentinels and cavalier both make that impossible, since the rate of fire for a sniper rifle isn't large enough to use for most high damage rifles, leaving your ONLY available option is to use vats, meaning you can't run a non vats build and be even close to repetitive.  
---
Its a very restrictive meta, where only a handful of weapons, armors and builds are capable of even competing (In PvP, PvE you don't even need sentinels unless you're melee to be competitive, and even then power armor is a great option). If you listen to what they talk about in regards to balancing this, they are aware that some balance changes might only take effect in pvp. However, I won't agree with the idea we need to balance the game around these specific builds.   
---
Yes, they added a mob with more staggers, however its easier, better for the economy of the game, as well as to cut down on differences between survival and adventure if these armor sets are brought in line with other legendary affixes like Vanguards and Bolstering, both of which work with the games regular damage resistance rather than straight DR. Frankly, and this is entirely my opinion, Flat DR is a dangerous thing to have in a multiplayer game especially, since it can so often either be abused or hard to balance other forms of resistance against it.   
---
My suggestion would be that Sentinels just gives a reasonable boost to damage and energy resist while standing still, rather than actual damage resistance, because as it stands, flat DR is so much more powerful than anything else, even power armor to an extent.  
---
&gt; On the matter of rebalancing, make Assassin a 'third slot' affix so armor can only be Sentinel or Assasin. Problem solved. 
---
Now legacy armor is either worth an incredible amount, restricting the top tier of play to a handful of people, or useless because they lose thier legendary affixes. I get you really like your build, and don't want any changes to cause you to feel as though you've been nurfed, but at some point one build might be nurfed so that all the others can shine as well.
---
In the knee-jerk reaction to the TSE fiasco they totally shafted actual explosive weapons, which weren't in a particularly good place to start with.
---
Theu haven't really recovered so if you want to play as a explosive weapons character you are pretty much SoL.
---
They could have made it so Demo Expert did not affect the explosive legendary affix in any shape or form and leave the perk alone.
---
But nope, they went the other way and fucked it up for everyone, nothing to see here, move along.
---
They seem to be getting slightly more judicious over time so hey, there is hope.
---
And the reason they added dozens of new songs that cost money to Fallout 76 was?
---
Just a thought, but what about adding the ability to play as another race, such as a super mutant? You could be like Grahm or like all the other super mutants in the waste land; complete with its own quest-lines.
---
But if they didn't fight, you would have had no way to retrieve you're rightful loot and you would have been irritated yeah?
---
I still chuckle every time I hear it called "survival". There is nothing survival about it. The fact You can level up on easy mode and switch between modes anytime is a joke.
---
The leader board is just beyond stupid for a FO game.
---
The bells and whistles when someone gets killed make me look for a quarter slot to add my next quarter.
---
It is a poorly put together gear vs gear ffa arcarde style death match. I played for a few hours, never actually fought anyone but all those things I mentioned completely turned me off from ever going back.
---
That mode is fine for those who want to pvp and pvp only. That not fun for me.
---
I want a true survival mode:
---
Create and lock characters to the mode. Need to start a new character with no mode jumping at all.
---
Updated bounty system, a REAL risk vs reward system.
---
I could make a whole post just about this.
---
No player map positions,  at all.
---
No slap damage, unrestricted pvp.
---
No legendary weapons and armor (still unsure about this suggestion,  I'd like hunter and mutant slayers ect to still exist. No pvp legendary bonuses.)
---
Train stations, base, owned workshops and vault 76 are only spawn/fast travel points. 
---
Train stations are no fire zones to protect from scummy spawn campers. (Maybe have unkillable robot guards protecting stations).
---
No leaderboards or notifications that others died.
---
 I have a lot more rules in mind but those are the important ones to me.  I know it's just a pipe dream since bethesda seems to be catering to the adhd kiddy br crowd.  Oh well I'll stick to adventure I guess.
---
We had the revenge respawn, and turned off Pacafist, one shotted each with a crit head shot, recovered our and probably other players loot then server hopped away!
---
your accusing someone you don't know calling them a weasel because they showed up to a PUBLIC event stole like 5 stable flux and some ultracite from a bag
---
Well yes technically... Damn lol
---
I love this. Pew pew pew!
---
Yeah, I would love to run either, but frankly I can't fit them into my build. Hell my rifle toon is running 1 str with no weight reduction anything. It's hell walking around with 175 weight. Excavator with double calibrated shocks fixes that though. Gotta have that damage though!
---
You-Ray-Neeum, You-Ray-Neeum
---
Whitesprings has been my only 3 star legendary drops! Had no luck anywhere else on the map!
---
If you can dodge a severed head, you can dodge a ball
---
Black titanium is dropped by deathclaws I thought? (Like every time)??
---
I do love the map and world of 76, but to see it in a singleplayer game would be great!
---
I found a terminal in the RRMS.  It’s in the last big building as you are headed towards the mire.  The dumpsters are outside it.
---
They aren't useless, that's hyperbole at best. My TSE gauss rifle does me wonders in PvE, and my regular TS 5.56 even does quite well for itself when I want consistant DPS rather than burst (Like SBQ). I have a TSE 10mm sub with -25% vats cost that kills everything i put in front of it.   
---
Also again, I don't think its a legitimate argument that we shouldn't balance things because it might make something "Useless". Not all balance changes are equal, and in all games balance is a constant struggle back and forth, but being unwilling to change just because you like something is ignorant to all the other people who might play a different way.
---
Both things that need fixing , I don't wanna shock any of you guys,but this game has flaws! I can tell by all the down vote's I'm getting that people think the game is perfect as is and doesn't need any changes from here on out lol :p
---
I would bet he bought the materials with cash, maybe even the whole account.
---
This is why I eventually had to drop some per and spread it out for QoL. I'd rather do a bit less damage and enjoy playing the game more.  Besides the fact that even at full strength the sniper build just doesn't stand up currently.
---
I only do half of that but I’m still working on it, I appreciate someone with a good build
---
nobody really comes here to say the game sucks
---
See I don't think it is.
---
They branded as an MMO and with how it is, it's somewhere in between both.  Just because it's only 30 ish people per server and that it falls down on the MMO aspects doesn't make it not an MMO. 
---
I completely disagree on the "beating" this game. It took me well over 300 hours to feel like I had done enough for one playthrough of FO3, not including new playthroughs with different choices. I have around 600 hours clocked on FO4 on steam, and I have yet to do the DLCs on that. 
---
This on the other hand I'm around 1-200 hours into the game, and everything feels rinse and repeat now. Go somewhere everyone died, there was something interesting about their deaths. They would have been better off making a graphic novel for that.
---
As is mentioned by a lot of people, it would have been cool if Factions mattered more. 
---
I'd personally like to see something like what FFXIV did, with Realm Reborn. Things weren't going well so they changed it and made it better more in line with other MMO's etc.
---
In my opinion, there isn't that much they need to do. World events is a big thing I'd like to see. Akin to Nukes, but not always player driven.
---
While I'll agree the unintended side effect of nurfing actual explosive weapons is really unfortunate, I can't say I blame them for balancing TSE the way they did. If anything, a decent solution would be just to slowly bring explosive weapons back up in power so they fall in line, which if the most recent balance patches are to be used as evidence, balance weapons so all are useful is definitely on their mind.
---
I have 9 bulk
---
Avoid the actual issue? You're in the minority here arguing that the current design is good. Just a bad troll tbh
---
Ok i have no luck with good weapon in that game... need one of those;)
---
My heart broke reading that he dropped 300 screws. Sucks for him, awesome for you! I only loot the junk off someone who was being a dick to me or others. Personally have messaged people before asking if they want the junk they dropped if they just simply had a 5 cap bounty or was just some random person I got to PVP with for fun. But if you're being a dick, your junk is miiiiiiine. But they get one salt in return :)
---
What? Those aren’t even real sentences. It hurt my head trying to read.
---
I'm talking 1* two shot, or explosive without a helpful primary. Or explosive weapons like the missile launcher, grenade launcher, all grenades and Fatman being crippled by the nerf! 
---
TSE is still decent on PvE, not the best but suitable end game weapon. It's all the other weapons that got hit because TSE was used in pvp!
---
What if all these items disappearing was from anti dupe code?
---
Not saying every item that has disappeared was a dupe.   Just that maybe code they introduced to find and remove dupes is misbehaving and flagging legit pieces
---
So when they break or some other inventory event happens they are removed?
---
It just seams odd.  From a programming stand point.  That items would.   “Disappear”
---
Some system has to be doing this
---
Give it some time.   
---
The game is good. I really, really enjoy it, and I've been playing since beta. However, Fallout 76 and "Amazing" are not two words I would ever associate with eachother.   
---
The game is good. "Deserving of the Fallout name", whatever that means, maybe. I would like to see a bit more content with a more serious tone than "LOL so whacky random robot LMAO fortnite!"
---
I don't even need the flux, it's the principal of it that irritates me,if you steal from someone there should be repercussions and they should be able to get back what's rightfully theirs, please explain why you're opposed to this
---
I don't even run these prefixes most of the time, I am currently running a 'naked' chameleon (mutation) stealth low health build because I like the fact that a bunch of radioactive barrels I missed or a mob that I didn't spot are the difference between life and death.
---
But I also like to have a choice rather than fun per hour limits enforced everywhere, leaving less and less space to breathe.
---
I have at least 6 months ahead of me until private servers are 'a thing' and I no longer need to appease the fun police, let's see if I can make it without being strangled first.
---
Just give me some caps. Perfect plan. ;)
---
Most "crashes" like that are user side, not server side. Meaning your end failed to process or handshake quick enough. Because it's not like everyone else who was looting in that moment was also kicked. 
---
If you're not hard wired, try that. Should reduce the game drops.
---
I'm a melee build and use heavy metal armor. Once you get good enough armor, the best way to play melee is to just sprint at enemies and power attack your heart away.
---
Major perk cards I use:
---
Martial artist allows you to swing faster and melee weapons weigh less.
---
Iron fist rank 3 for unarmed (mole miner gauntlet, power fist, etc. Only use this perk if you use a weapon it affects.
---
Slugger/expert slugger/master slugger for two handed weapons.
---
Gladiator/expert gladiator/master gladiator for one handed weapons. I don't recommend putting 9 points into one handed or two handed, maybe 6 or 7.
---
Makeshift warrior lets melee weapons last longer and are cheaper to repair.
---
Other than that, strength 15 and any of your other quality of life perks. Good luck!
---
Well it depends on what kind of build you like right now, the meta right now is a sort of high damage low health, using Armour such as unyielding with +3 to specials except endurance and with 5 that’s 75% increase to damage. Bloodied weapons (more damage lower your health) also stacks aswell and adrenal mutation is similar to Bloodied.
---
However if you don’t use bloodied I would suggest PA as you normally take much more damage than fellow sniper/rifle builds. If you really want, then barbarian (strength) ironclad (endurance) evasive (agility) all provide extra DR. Hope this helps a bit
---
I gotcha now
---
I can't wait until the day that people finally realize that TSE weapons aren't good, and that you're just bad.   
---
Also, marsupial is a strange thing to describe as some sort of ace in the hole.
---
Yep, I am hard wired, thanks anyway
---
1200 isn't bad man, you're definitely a heavy hitter :)
---
Yet you can’t even mention how I’m trolling, because you can’t, because I’m not. Sheep.
---
Tale of Two Wastelands may be able to fix that for you, if you don't mind New Vegas' quality of life and other minor changes such as the Skills and damage calculation making it not quite Fallout 3.
---
I'm totally, totally fine with this. I think bloodied needs to be looked at as well, not to be nerfed, but to bring other dps builds in line.   
---
Nobody that is running assassin's sentinel or unyielding sentinel is running an organically acquired set of gear. It's duped items, ebay purchases, or both.
---
I am too. Still happens occasionally, and it's annoying but inevitable in an online game. 
---
That's why until they release an "reconnect to last server" option I always will send out a batch of team requests when I log in and plan on playing for a bit. Makes it easier to rejoin the same server if something happens. 
---
If you had someone else on the server, you could have still gone back to that same corpse and grabbed your loot.
---
If you are running mods check your Fallout76Custom.ini file something may be a miss in there. you should be adding the entire \[Archive\] text from fallout76.ini into the Fallout76Custom.ini then adding the mods text after. do this after every game update as well.
---
Personally wouldn't mind if they just removed the sentinel bit altogether, from current armor and all future armor. Being able to just stand there and take little to no damage is ridiculous. PVP overall needs a rework and to be balanced. It sucks terribly right now. Personally wish they would make adventure mode PVE and leave PVP to certain events and workshops
---
Why not max dmg perk? Useless? What about legendary armor? Or it's OK to play without legendary armor?
---
Lol that's how these mobile games work lad don't be naive.
---
But you would have to kill them to get it back, again I'm not asking for the removal of this mechanic only for it to be considered a hostile action against that player
---
I use a 1\* Two shot Handmade rifle and it does great, not sure what makes you think they don't. Its a % damage boost of any kind, that isn't effected by enemy type (even armor piercing has its downsides if fighting something with no armor). Yea, a TSE one might do more damage, I'm also more likely to kill myself, which is actually why I haven't bothered with getting a "Better" one.    
---
As I said in a previous comment, its unfortunate when there are unintended side effects to balance changes, but that's just the reality of an online game. Balance is a constant back and forth, with the developers goal to try and keep as many play-styles relatively playable. Sometimes while trying to do this, they unintentionally create a divide in power strengths. Its not exclusively a bethesda problem, which is why I don't personally get bothered by it.
---
I'm heavy spec and sometimes it just flies too far for me to reach consistently with a weapon.
---
I logged in for shits and giggles a few days ago after not playing for 4 months, and honestly... I was just bored.  Everything is still so clunky, and the same reason I stopped playing the first time still hold true: it feels like work.  There is no enjoyment in blowing through 3000 rounds and 40 grenades in the span of 30 minutes (SBQ) and having to go out and farm it again.  It feels like work.
---
I did just hop on PoE on the PS4, and MAN has that game come really far since I quit the PC client in 2015.
---
I’m keeping my copy of 76 for a couple more months just in case there’s a big overhaul, but I think I might just be wishing for the impossible at this point.
---
Got it myself on sale about 2 weeks ago and already racked up 40 hours. Went back to fallout 4 just now and i honestly prefer 76.
---
Not a fan of this low health high dmg builds. But I'll keep it in mind. Thanks.
---
I hoard all my Legendary items on alts and are going to scrap a ton of Legendary items tomorrow when the scrip machines go live at the train-stations. I also buy all cheap legendary items i find on vendors just for the upcoming scrapping.
---
For my rifle build I like to add the perk that increases your sneak critical attacks
---
So basically as long as is someone else that has to give up their playstyle(s) to make room for the playstyle(s) you want you are OK with it.
---
Did I get that right?
---
MODUS would like to speak with you face to face, the Enclave might have some work for you
---
&gt; the sniper build just doesn't stand up currently.
---
??? My sniper literally 1 shots everything except for ISS and SBQ. I haven't got to test it out on regular sheepsquatch, but I've 1 shot lvl 80 scorchbeasts. They don't have quite as much dps output but their damage efficiency is far higher than most other builds. You need to have a bloodied and instigating lever action rifle for a sniper build though. Hunting rifles can tide you over, though their dps is substantially lower than lever action. Also an instigating dragon is good to 1 shot all the big nasties you don't want to deal with (mirelurk queens/kings, deathclaws, scorchbeasts, shit like that).
---
I understand.  I'm approaching L80 in a melee build, and run across the same issue as you.    Most of the 2\*s I get as loot @ WS are better suited for heavy weapon builds.
---
Probably wont affect market pages. It is good for people like me that don't use the market pages. 
---
I have lots of 3* weapons. Bloodied, AA, explosive, ts ect. ect.
---
I also have some great 3* pvp armor collecting dust in my stash.
---
Been waiting patiently for this to come for what seems like forever. 
---
Whoever finds my shop will be pleasantly surprised. I don't plan on charging much.
---
Bloodied 50cal beats a bloody gatling plasma pretty handily right now, since energy weapons dont benefit from armor piercing.
---
I was just olaying around with a level 40 bloodied plasma gat i found, burning off some plasma cores. Definitely not on the same level as my bloodied 50cal.
---
Decide first if you want to focus on one or two handed. My personal preference is the Gladiator perk tree, and single handed weapons for inflicting faster damage. 
---
A good legendary switchblade or combat knife with faster swing speed can deliver massive damage very quickly and put to 2-3 hits on a mob before they can hit you often, especially if you get in little sneaky sneaky.
---
So many perk cards to layer on for melee, but for me bloody mess since it also boots gun damage is a great choice.
---
Load up on glowing meat steak, and other meats that add strength and melee boosts like Mutt Chops, Deathclaw and Stingwing to multiply damage, hell, add some whisky for 6 points of short term strength boost on top if you want to disembowel a Deathclaw solo.
---
So much fun, oh, and high priority on finding Vampire Legendary blades, they’ll give you health boosts with every cut on an enemy to help make being up close and personal a more survivable situation.
---
Good luck!
---
Supposedly legendary vendor and backpacks coming too, pretty fat content update right there
---
Yup, ever since I got my decon shower I only fix camp by moving it. Cheap and quick.
---
&gt;I didn't " bring anything " they were my rightful flux rewards 
---
You have to craft stable flux if you brought stable flux to a SBQ fight then you deserve to lose it. The Raw Flux is under the aid tab and you don't lose it upon death. 
---
Did you forget this or did you actually take Stable Flux to a Queen fight?
---
Are you sure? Because my Gatling plasma deals about 300-400 dmg per shot and it shoots very fast and the ammo is easy to come by
---
You do not need to constantly hit it. I give it a tap or two every time it fly past. Few had been dumb enough to hover over me and died very fast.
---
You should play it. Give it a week of new playtime.  The games changed ALOT since you last played Ps try to have a nice day today sir
---
they didn't steal it they picked up a dead mans bag its a game mechanic. your suggestion where you can fight a stranger back for junk you dropped would be abused. For instance I kill myself in a open area where I know a new player will find it and this low level player finds a bag full of junk and decides to take using your system that player is either in combat with me or wanted I can now kill that lower level player without consequences and get my stuff back plus whatever junk they dropped.
---
Your demands were too high man, they won't listen to these great ideas. Pretty sure if you want a good idea seen and to get done you have to pay them or have some kind of seasonal idea pass.
---
If you need a god roll weapon to be viable, that isn't going to be standard. 
---
I can get the same basic effect off a few spins on a furious or tse Gatling plasma without even needing to perk spec much. 
---
I'm not saying you can't do it, just that it requires a lot of sacrifices and grinding for the right weapon just to get to a viable level for end game matches.
---
Well basically its a build at your own risk site, if you wanna put your camp there and ruin everyone else on the servers experience with whitesprings then just expect to have you camp leveled repeatedly
---
&gt; I don't even run these prefixes most of the time, I am currently running a 'naked' chameleon (mutation) stealth low health build because I like the fact that a bunch of radioactive barrels I missed or a mob that I didn't spot are the difference between life and death. 
---
And I play stealth sniper. And while I agree having options open is great, but if it's at the cost of having some things be demonstrably better than others in a competative enviroment, I don't think its worth it at all.
---
&gt; But I also like to have a choice rather than fun per hour limits enforced everywhere, leaving less and less space to breathe. 
---
Such an obtuse statement to make about a live service game. You obviously haven't played many other online games.
---
Have you ever done a Queen fight bro ? You are rewarded flux upon completion
---
Raw flux is an aid item you do not lose it upon death. In fact all the items needed to turn raw flux into stable flux are also aid items.
---
Stable flux is a "junk" item but you have to craft it first.
---
I've found that it's better to invest in perks that help with carry weight like bandolier and traveling pharmacy. If you're someone who only carries what you need, then you can probably get away with max damage perks. For legendary armor, it's great if you find any good ones, but I've been fine with just a legendary chestpiece and an arm and leg. I've never really put much focus on it. I'm by no means an expert, but this is what has worked for me.
---
Thats been around for a while.  Also happens if you die and respawn.
---
 Really annoying when you are in the middle of nowhere - crawling back to your junk bag is tedious, to say the least....
---
I think the system sometimes gives you the standard excavator carry weight bonus (+100#), then applies calibrated shock to bothe legs (another 100), even if you dont have calibrated shocks.
---
When you exit/reenter your armor, it applies the correct weight bonus.
---
I agree with the sentiment but I doubt Bethesda could handle something like this. I could see them patching it in and everyone on the server getting the rewards or something like that.
---
I found a spot where there's a skeleton with baseball bat, with a dog carcass in front of him, then a few steps along there's another dog carcass and a skeleton laying protectively over a pram. 
---
It's up a cliff path, under a pointer dog top right on the map.
---
How'd you fuck that up.
---
How did you die after the fight? I assumed you meant the raw flux you harvest.
---
I hope the purveyor coes out earlier than expected.
---
The vendor is on may 23 but we are getting backpacks and a machine that lets us break down legionaries for a currency the vendor uses https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/3ExPLDXM5fgLJm9WiWLGrK/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-patch-9-preview
---
Which is the point if it becomes public it would get patched.
---
I'll buy them all my psn is disorderlyduke
---
&gt; I think bloodied needs to be looked at as well, not to be nerfed, but to bring other dps builds in line. 
---
I agree, but removing any sort of perceived power from these builds will be considered a nurf no matter what, however I don't think that's a bad thing. There are definitely orders of magnitude when it comes to balancing, some being a lot more harsh than others. 
---
&gt; Nobody that is running assassin's sentinel or unyielding sentinel is running an organically acquired set of gear. It's duped items, ebay purchases, or both. 
---
I'll agree that I have my suspicions about the authenticity of a large amount of the gear out there as well, I don't think that in itself warrants it being nurfed. If the legendary vendor actually allows for some sort of control of legendary progression like they've said its supposed to in the video I linked, then everyone could have the full set and it would still be a problem. 
---
Also if you're right, and people payed actual money for these sets, their going to raise a shit-storm when they get nurfed.
---
It will mean a lot to people like me who don't use trading pages.
---
 I have some ridiculously good gear waiting to get put on my market stall. Lots of high end 3* gear. Been playing and collecting since launch.
---
Played 292 days? Impressive.
---
I quit doing the event because of this.
---
SBQ fight has flash ferns around the trees. I'm not sure where else this spawns.
---
&gt;  tse Gatling plasma
---
Lol a legacy god roll weapon that also happens to be the strongest in the game? Strangest statement ever, "Don't quote what godroll weapons can do, look at what my most godroll weapon in the entire damn game can do." ???
---
Also I never mentioned any god roll weapons. 1 star bloodied weapons are cheap and easy to come by. I've farmed up 3 bloodied rifles in the past week. Also, I can hunt in a nuke zone just fine with a non legendary lever action, it just sucks compared to having a bloodied/instigating rifle where I 1 shot everything. A god roll weapon would be bloodied/explosive/15% crit fill rate or 25% reduced ap... Not 1 star weapons that you can find people vendoring in a nuke zone.
---
This is the world's future. We are doomed.
---
Congrats! I have have the Platinum on PS4 too and hope that future content add some new trophies/achievements!
---
I have, but I stopped. I have played everything from Ultima Onlike to FFXI (which is when I went, after five years of playing it, purely single player becuase that wasn't a game, it was a second job).
---
Guilty as charged, given that single player gamers are who took BGS where it is today I thought that this game would be a single/ cooperative game with a small element of PvP, not the other way around.
---
I am finding coexisting with the 'PvP crowd'... grievous.
---
The problem is, I like the game. Most of the time I forget there is PvP, so is not all doom and gloom.
---
Thing is, when I'm reminded that PvP is a thing is generally for all the wrong reasons.
---
I sometimes get this, and sometimes my melee has god range hitting people behind me
---
OK EVERYONE, LISTEN UP! OXHORN **WAS** A BAD GUY, **BUT HE HAS CHANGED, 'CAUSE THAT'S AS HUMAN AS IT GETS, MY DUDES. THE MAN** **WAS BAD BUT NOT ANYMORE. PLEASE WATCH HIS APOLOGY VIDEO BEFORE SAYING BAD THINGS ABOUT HIM (that he was, but not anymore). THANK YOU.**
---
I ran into a behemoth last night. He hit really hard but was easy to stay away from.
---
Well it would teach them to be cautious about which bags they pick up and not to steal peoples thing's if they aren't ready for a fight. Of all the broken mechanics in the game this would be the least abusable,just look at survival mode, a mode built on broken mechanics! Also I would suggest items dropped from pip boy be different to item's dropped upon death, maybe the bag that drop's upon death is black so players know not to touch it unless they are ready for a fight.
---
You know the only things in this game with no armor are level 5 or less right, and any enemy above that has triple their level in armor at least, except ghouls and scorched which are only double.
---
Armor piercing is just a straight damage bonus
---
Yeah, main place is camp McClintock, chancy manor or whatever in the top left, and the brotherhood fortress in the old asylum.
---
If you submit a ticket Bethesda can reverse that for you
---
Played longer than the game has been out , must’ve been playing in the Bethesda’s office janitors closet prior to release 😬
---
The fact you think 'everyone' uses X-01 and that power armors need a nerf, kinda undermines anything else you might have to say based on your 'many hours of playing'
---
Lol, not those guys. Just a regular old super mutant that has whacked out damage
---
For sure its one or the other, data mining has shown  the way the loot is calculated is that it first rolls for BOS Underarmour (but only if you have learned the others) if that succeeds it drops and no other loot drops, if it fails, it'll then roll for apparel, again if any of the apparel succeed it'll drop and stop, and finally it will roll for paint, if none of these are successful you will only get random aid and ammo. 
---
 If its just the apparel you want, and you are on PC, I can gift you whatever it is you are looking for.
---
Touche I though I read "broken" in the title
---
&gt;I also like to have a choice rather than fun per hour limits enforced everywhere
---
Nothing is more fun limiting than having one build tower above the world and demolish everything else effortlessly. Either you play one way or get wiped.
---
They created a problem (item degrade way too fast, scarce materials) then their provided fix is payed consumables. They are solving their own introduced problem by asking people to spend money... It's shady as hell. They have also continuously nerfed perks or drop rates to further the grind of farming materials. This was all planed way back.
---
You on PS4?
---
there is no end yet the story will continue in future patches.
---
Because fans always want new songs, but that doesn't discredit the fact that it would be a zero profit act to go buy songs, even if they were different ones, right now. This isn't .99 cents at the iTunes store, these are expensive licensing deals. So while I would like to hear the songs again, Bethesda won't do it because it won't bring people to pay for the game, which is the overarching goal of the game.
---
I think you missed the point, it was that the weapon was doing more of the damage than the perks and that anyone getting the right legendary weapon can be a damage powerhouse. 
---
You have to judge a build based on what it can do with standard weapons, not base it on RNG hopefully brings you. 
---
Because I've been playing since beta as well and I've probably only gotten maybe 6 bloodied weapons, and only one was a decent rifle (2* radium). So the fact that you've found a ton is anecdotal because there's no way to determine what someone else gets and you'd need a weapon that does decent damage before you can even start farming and grinding to try and find the better weapon.
---
Did it work?
---
Same here. Level 200 and my best handmade drop was a level 35 with bashing damage. Have had two explosive drops (single action revolver and .44).
---
Isnt it a bit late now? Got any link go that ticket form?
---
I got the challenge of play that amount of hours yesterday so either a bug or something but either way played game since beta that’s what I’m trying to say
---
At least you get to sit on your mistake!
---
The accuracy of the long pew doesn't out way the short pews speed. Is so much easier to get the short pew around corners perfect for indoors.
---
what is the point of death if your bag has a immunity to other players even touching it? dropping all junk items is very lenient when they could have you drop more valuable items.
---
Since beta seems the 7600 hours part was a glitch or something when it said I had yesterday
---
But Sentinel is OP. PvE or PvP. Needs balance or people still going just for it, breaking diversity
---
You can definitely find a bloodied handmade rifle on fo76 bazzar - it's the fallout 76 in-game community where you can buy and sell in game items for in game items!
---
I use All Rise but it isn't really upgradeble (rocket powered sledgehammer)
---
I see where youre coming from now. Maybe bethesda will introduce more models.
---
Only equip the Hard Bargain when you\`re going to sell or buy from a vendor, grab travel agent. For Charisma, i don\`t think you need that many points in there if you play solo. I run with 4 in there and just lone wanderer. I would max out concentrated fire as well. Also i would go for evasive and covert operative. 
---
The other things i\`m still not sure about myself. Rebuilding my charachter from Melee to Rifle
---
7600 hours = 292 days.
---
Game hasn't been out that long, even if it has you would have to have been playing 24 hours a day, everyday.
---
It’s so dry man like one Explosive since beta I think they should higher the weapon levels and make certain end game enemies that will drop certain lvl weapons or make servers for high and low lvl players the high lvl servers the loot pool is better
---
Yeah I dont carry junk to or near a blast zone.
---
Game glitch then as I haven’t played all day everyday
---
Oh, scrappers fine  i guess as i got a couple sledgehammers taking up room in my stash.
---
Kinda blueballs but at least we can grind before vendor launches
---
The only way to rebalance PvP isn’t a nerf to sentinel assassins it’s to make actually good legendaries that rival it
---
I’m using that atm but I’ve heard it would be better to find a weapon I can obtain from a legendary beast and be able to upgrade what I find
---
They didn't position the nuke properly and I'm bloodied melee build we we're able to fight her outside of rad zone just barely, but her body landed in rad zone, I went to retrieve my loot all the while popping radaways and ran back to safety but the nuke zone border seemed to have changed or something because I got to safety outside of zone but still managed to keep getting irradiated. I would say it was probably a bug, but I don't wanna say that as it might offend all the people that have been down voting me for accusing this game of being less than perfect lol
---
there is a mod for this...  Perk Loadout Manager,  Perk Loadout Manager is a mod that allows you to import up to 12 unique Perk Card builds, and swap between them as needed.
---
&gt;Guilty as charged, given that single player gamers are who took BGS where it is today I thought that this game would be a single/ cooperative game with a small element of PvP, not the other way around.  
---
&gt;I am finding coexisting with the 'PvP crowd'... grievous.  
---
&gt;The problem is, I like the game. Most of the time I forget there is PvP, so is not all doom and gloom.  
---
&gt;Thing is, when I'm reminded that PvP is a thing is generally for all the wrong reasons
---
As someone who's played BGS for thousands of hours I do understand the frustration. Even the small things, like when encountering a bug not being able just to fix it by opening the console catch me off guard and tend to annoy me. 
---
My hope is that going forward, they'll continue to separate and refine both game mods. Personally, the little bit of pvp left in adventure mode (Worshops) is a great balance between pvp and pve for people that aren't into pvp, since while they're great for resourses (I've taken 4 just for me because I needed all the lead) but the cost is putting yourself out there.   
---
I'll never advocate for actual griefing, and generally don't understand people who after a bout of pvp can't act like adults and have a friendly chat afterwards. I'll definetly admit there are a lot of people who like to PvP just because they want to upset others, and I totally get where that's frustraighting.   
---
Then to have the game be balanced for, what I assume you perceive to be, the worst players/aspects of the game is annoying for sure. Personally in a perfect world, I want PvP to be balanced (or at least somewhat competative), while people doing PvE can have as much freedom as possible in thier playstyle. Bethesda games always are at thier most fun (IMO) when you're imposing limits on yourself for a challenge rather than doing whats the most powerful, and restricting how armors work could concivably impact your ability to do so.
---
Bloodied already got its nerf (with adrena reaction).   
---
You are sacrificing health for damage, its balanced the way it is, the problem is people running that build with sentinel or cavalier.
---
The dragon is the opposite of dps- it does high damage per shot, but the reload is very slow, it’s actual DPS isn’t very good. Still, as a weapon for a melee user to carry for the rare cases you can’t reach an enemy, it’s not a bad choice. Fairly light, and hard hitting.
---
Unless you buy it from the vendors.
---
Remove legendary effects from armor, that’s what makes people invincible. Or just remove all legendary effects. Or don’t let them stack.
---
I do this but this is starting to make me think back on doing it
---
Well, hard to say exactly- I mean, you don’t “swing” auto melee weapons, so why would swing speed affect them?
---
Can get on that missile launcher buff, like nobody is going to carry 20w on top of the 50w launcher for 200 damage or whatever the launcher deals at its base.
---
The game predicts the results of you shooting before it tells the other person they got shot, but your game doesn't know whether their perks and armor effects negated or reduced your damage to meaningless levels, so when their game tells yours what actually happens you game puts the health bar back where it should be.
---
The All Rise can be gotten by completing the mayor's questline in Watoga. It's pretty good and a guaranteed reward so it's easy to get. It's a 2 handed weapon. There are 1 handed, 2 handed, and unarmed melee weapons and each have associated perks.

End game should be more challenging and rewarding
---
No idea, I’m not trying to claim anything, I’m just sharing the only source/evidence I know of, and wondering what T4H is basing his statement on
---
You are not by any means the only one who thought that
---
What immunity? They can still take it lol but now they can't just stand there flipping you off with corny emotes while you shoot them for no damage
---
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!!!!!
---
Then limit 'competitive' PvP to the survival mode and rebalance things there would be a solution?
---
Or PvP players are not satisfied unless the entirety of the available content is balanced for and caters to them?
---
Not being an arsehole here; the last game I played that had PvP on it was Ultima Online so I have no idea what the average PvP player wants today.
---
My favorite atm is a vampire Mr Handy. I use the adrenaline perk so when surrounded by enemies, I can keep my health up pretty easy because of how fast it attacks
---
Yeah, I’ve been thinking and with three of us, it would be cool if they are able to fight and I’m able to take out the main enemy pretty fast
---
Im on PS4. Is that available?
---
Seriously like if there was like an event you can only get after a certain lvl or house of game okay that gaureetes a 3star gun not a 3 star 
---
Enemy a gun(armor)
---
&gt; I understand people either worked very hard for their gear, or payed good money for it
---
"hey bro can you dupe that set for me? I wanna try it too. thnx!"
---
"Yeah I have like eight TSE handmades, will that be enough for the set? Awesome, thanks bro"
---
probably fits about ~90% of cases
---
Might have to restructure your sentence mate, doesn’t make sense.
---
That would be great
---
It is a bad connection. I was playing a little on Hotel WiFi over the weekend, no melee hits would register at all, but at home on a good wired connection, never see a problem.
---
I’ve heard of the mr handy weapons
---
I’ve been stressing my system and V-Sync FAST is definitely IT for me, no stuttering any more I’m chuffed :)
---
What a fun name to give my plasma rifle now!
---
The problem with that is power creep. By doing additive balance changes (adding in content thats powerful to rival others) games become harder and harder to balance. If you google just the term its used a lot with mobas to describe when a new hero is introducted to counter a certain kind of play style, and it causes a lot of problems.   
---
Yu-gi-oh the card game has that problem, where each set makes the last one obsolete by either being better or countering it.
---
My theory is theres going to be an event in the winter season, they hinted at world wide events so i’m thinking maybe after scorched earth is completed, the scorched die out and people move in, the factions come out of hiding and its an npc faction war with scorched getting replaced by various factions and raiders with higher tier loot and perhaps increased levels (character resets with legendary perks are supposedly coming in the nuclear winter event this summer, perhaps increasing max gear level too)
---
Yes, because I wanted to surprise my girlfriend and so we could both play the game togehter
---
even 80% is too high given that it still uses your armor value to reduce damage again after, and because it's based on the ratio of damage to armor, that 80% reduction to damage multiplies the effective armor value by 5, meaning it's almost certain to reduce your damage to 2% or less
---
Does upgrading concentrated fire increase the damage done aiming down sights or only using vats?
---
I feel like we have played two completely different games. I guess it depends on your standards.
---
I'll be doing the same, specially with lots of plans and stuff i've been having collecting dust there.
---
Anyway , no I don’t think there are any new legendary farming spots apart from the standard events and standard 3 locations , I mean I’ve gotten one explosive weapon and I’ve been playing since beta but that weapon was trash and was obtained from a radrat that I found near the sat array.
---
&gt; also tomorrow obviously the legendary vendor is coming out ( or not ) so once that’s come out I reckon legendaries that you want will be much easier to get.
---
I didn't miss the point, again you're not listening. I can easily clear nuke level mobs with a non legendary lever rifle. You keep skimming over and ignoring what I'm saying because you don't want to hear it or you already think you know better.
---
Also your loot is also anecdotal. Want some facts about loot? It's seed based off your name, players have proven it. So I'm more likely to get bloodied weapons than you are and you're more likely to get other things. The point about my getting all those bloodied isn't that **I** get them often, it's that they can be found often. If you bother to trade, bloodied rifles are ~3-6k on the market depending on level and model. You don't have to rely on RNG, you can farm up some caps and after about a week, you've got yourself a 1 shot rifle. Nothing special, nothing impossible to get, none of the bullshit you're talking about.
---
Again I don't need a "decent" 2/3 star to ruin absolutely everything, I use all 1 star weapons except for my instigating/+25% fire rate hunting rifle. Hell my bloodied lever action is a lvl 35 weapon and it 1 shots bloated glowing ones without the glowing perk.
---
I feel stupid. I just posted this suggestion
---
Only vats, covert operative will increase the sneak attack damage.
---
here is mine:

---
crafting perks, hard bargain, weight reduction stuff, and iten finding perks are all situational stuff not something you really want to full time. this set up i use when i am out hunting, then switch out a card here or there for certain things.
---
I could have done it a lot sooner if I was trying to but I just thought I'd let it take its course haha.
---
Decide on 1H or 2H - gladiator is focused on 2H.  
---
I use mainy 1H weapons, so ony have 1 pt in gladiator.
---
Pretty much mandatory perks for either 1 or 2h melee are Bloody Mess3 and martial arts3.  
---
glowsight3, especially for nuke zones.  tenderizer for 5% bonus damage.
---
fireproof (helps with SB sonic attack)
---
good doggy
---
Recommend a couple points for auto rifles (damage and ignore armor, b/c you will find them useful on occasion.
---
If you dont want to use PA, you'll need a hazmat suit (-1000 rad restance)
---
I stayed out of PA until I started farming legendaries b/c some very effective melee weapons do not work when you are in PA - but now I carry way to much weight.
---
That aside, before going into PA, I mixed and matched armor pieces.
---
One piece each for chameleon, reduced damage from robots, reduced damage from ghouls, 
---
health regen out of combat, and cloaking.
---
Agree with another post - vampire weapons are very good.  I used a vampire machete as my primary for +20 levels.  Now alternate between a vampire switchblade and standard cultist dagger.
---
As for effectiveness, solo kill L91 glowing deathclaw with the cultist blade
---
 (and)
---
A couple days ago, met my first legendary sheepsquatch in the wild - solo kill with a L50 vampire switchblade (modded w/ serrated blade).
---
It has been suggested and I think is brilliant.
---
I don't want to intrude in other people's fun.
---
If blowing each other up is their poison fantastic, we are all here to enjoy the game.
---
I just feel that the more I don't want to encroach on their 'fun grounds' the more entitled they feel to encroach on mines.
---
I've been going door to door since beta, will be nice to be able to set up shops somewhere and be seen.
---
I think i was with you during the event you got it done for me for the first time i tagged and hide but thats because i didnt have anything to heal and fight with my team was judging me and i couldnt fo anything i felt bad for not helping as much and now fell more bad knowing i couldnt help someone i know on reddit
---
And bloodied builds
---
Does this bug also affect deep pocketed armor?
---
I have deep pocketed marine armor (all pieces) and that gives me about a 336 carry weight (iirc) I jump into my power armor and it drops the carry weight into the 200's.
---
I disagree, for multiple reasons;
---
1. Death has Consequences, and they are well known.
---
2. Your suggestion would simply be another way for griefers to exploit unsuspecting players.
---
3. In events such as SBQ, or Sheep Squatch events, you should not carry Junk, you know there is a good possibility of dying.  
---
4. Outside of events I don't take most players death loot, and will sometimes even protect it until they return, but other times there is someone who deserves to lose it, for those I will take their junk and give it to others if I don't need it.
---
Someone posts one of these every couple weeks. 
---
As a tip, pharma pharma works on medicine cabinets(the mirrors in bathrooms) and can do works on many garbage containers!
---
Honestly I think the idea is to have as level of a playing field as possible, and that goes for PvE as well. TSE is a great example for how yes, they were amazing in pvp, but also in pve.   
---
I actually play a lot of adventure mode, since like I've stated before PvP is broken/Unbalanced atm, and some of my favorite encounters have come because I've taken somone's workshop to try and steal their lead but we end up shooting each other out, then having a laugh about it after the dust has settled. The problem is that while I might be a reasonable adult, there are people who will use the same systems I'm using to have a fun, and even somewhat lore friendly experience to grief others.
---
Some PvP players might be wierd and want PvE nurfed, but I think generally people want everyone to be able to have fun doing what they want. It's just really tricky when something you might use in a way that's both balanced and not effecting other people might get used to do the opposite by a shitty person.
---
So
---
Who are you pvp’ing since you can’t play in survival?
---
So, to be clear, you decided to play a high risk of death build, in a rad zone, and when that poor decision resulted in you losing some flux and your response to this natural and entirely predictable result is not to blame yourself but instead to go online to a historically unforgiving forum towards those who have fundamental misunderstanding of how the game works to try to blame everyone (the ones who launched, a magically moving rad zone, or the person who got lucky enough to find a treasure bag that someone dropped) except yourself? Buzzkill indeed.
---
It's a bold move Cotton, lets see how it works for him.
---
We getting tomorrow vending machines to sell legendary gear. Purveyor, the legendary vendor will be released later this month
---
checks and balances. I get what you are saying,and agree with most of it......but......
---
I'de go the opposite way. nerf ALL the overpowered weapons and melee and perks.
---
i can go to flatwoods for an item, and one shot ANYTHING, with the lowest powered weapon that i have. If the whole game was like that, then time to quit.
---
like the mutant "wot, dead already, I was looking for a good fight". "urgh".
---
loads of u-tube videos of this or that weapon flattening west tech in 2 mins. no challenge, utterly boring.
---
Now if they were to go with something more realistic, like real weapons, with real ballistics and damage, and same for incoming fire, now thats a different game .
---
I would be REALLY interested in that.
---
personal opinion with all the usual disclaimers.
---
I Think that would be awsome, but for balance reasons i would like it to be out of combat only? 
---
Like u Said, perhaps a heavy card build, melee build and a crafting/repair build? Would be great! Instead of jumping back and forth to swap cards around all the time
---
I bought the War. Passing on Death - not a huge fan of how it looks. Considering Pale. 
---
Figure if my trio all keeps playing we can all rock one moving forward. 👍🏻
---
Yeah mine either.
---
Check around for my other posts in the thread I have tackled each of these points
---
Proud to say haven't bought a thing from the outset ;-D
---
Yea but out of respect for the 10% of people who do get it legit I didn't want to really go into that lol. Plus if I don't phrase it like that dupers just lie and try to high road me lol.
---
320 mph winds is not just bad weather, friend.

Its Bethesda's own fault for including PvP - in a builds based, gear dependent game.  I'll pass on PvP because its pointless when its largely just picking the right perks and buying/trading for the right gear.  A proper shooter based PvP is far better in regards to balancing - and I'm far from a twitch god player myself.
---
Just hoping they don't mess up the rest of the game now for the sake of balancing PvP.
---
Did the same on the moth man armour skin... I don’t even use PA. 1400 Atoms down the drain.
---
Great tip for those that do not know as of yet - started farming for my T51B last night (...which will make my third as well 🙂)
---
Adhesive is not too problematic. You check basically farm it in your camp (corn, mutfruit, tato). But the screws...
---
Why does it matter if every other player has one? Just wear what you like man
---
Generally happens after logging into a server. 
---
You’ll then lose the glitched bonus weight on death or removing the power Armor. 
---
Can be “glitched” again by logging out and then back in.
---
Seems pretty low on exploits to be fixed but useful when you just need that little bit more carry weight to get to a stash
---
It's one of those weird things, every player wants to win
---
but only a % can win.
---
I don't need to be able to win every fight, just a reasonable percentage, I am not built for pvp, but I have some interesting weapons and items to turn the tide if someone gets careless, so like 10% chance, opposed to now where it is close to 0 given the \*HUGE\* power disparity. Things shouldn't be so out of line that there is only one way to win fights. It's like if there was a perk card that cost 15 end that gave you 1,000,000 health, it would be so mandatory, so out of line with everything else that you either have it or can't win at all against anyone that does.
---
The most fun fights are the ones I had a chance to win or lose, so there was some measure of duress and a need to do things well. Fights where one person derps in and fires indiscriminately until the other is a meaty paste while being invulnerable are not fun.
---
That’s like the time I bought the pool cue because I had just gotten the pool table and thought it went with it.  I couldn’t figure out why I couldn’t find it in my building menu and was getting irritated. Then a teammate burst my bubble. 🤦‍♀️
---
Meanwhile I saw a lvl 20 walk into a blast zone alone so I followed him. He died within a minute and dropped 100 screws, nothing else. 
---
I was a nice boy and delivered it to him outside the zone
---
That is nice to hear. Sadly at some time it simply was popular to hate that game. Like it was popular to hate Nickelback, even though many like them. It is kind of paradox but it simply is a complex expression of a socialisation that is very easy to do and easy to relate to, since it is easyer to find differences than similiarys. Some sadly want to force their oppinion on people without constructive criticism and so on. People that constructively critice the game (which is good, since it helps) will most likely not force their oppinion on you, but help to resolve the problem. The rest on the other hand are destructive and it is sad, that this reddit and Imgur and other services have to bear this at some point unreasonable hate
---
Man I'd kill to get some Grifball in 76!
---
Sorry, IDK on that one.  I have never used pocketed armor.
---
I really, really enjoyed the game for a while, but trust me the performance of the game is a real issue and will hit you at some point, there are a lot of bugs. I love the setting though, and despite the obvious effort that's gone into the worlds design, i felt the quests were mostly lackluckstre. On launch and for months after there were serious game breaking issues which drove a lot of people crazy, it eventually became too much and i stopped playing.
---
Despite that what you’re saying isn’t possible, I’d literally give you my explosive weapons (except for the laser rifle) since you have bad luck and I dislike the aesthetics of explosive rounds.
---
100% with you but not as easy as a hot key. it is what it is for a reason.
---
WHO LIVES IN A PINEAPPLE UNDER THE SEA!?!?!?!

At the Generals Steakhouse there is a holotape of the head chef rendering his resignation.

He talks about the decline of the economy in Apalachia and the continuing changes the restaraunt has to make to the menu to keep serving the needs of the locals.
---
It ends with him saying he's not a soup kitchen sort of guy and he has to move on. I'm not sure why it really got me but it just seems so real and genuine and really sums up how hard things were getting before the bombs fell.
---
A legendary fully upgraded all star baseball bat can be much better than all rise granted you have the right perks
---
thanks. Yeah i just read someone suggested it and i feel really silly because i searched here and couldn't find it :(
---
Elaborate ? Bc I have no idea what you mean here,you say you DONT find more in a container, you have to actively search?
---
Also for the people saying death has little consequence I agree, so here goes... Death should heal much less rads and not cure addiction, but my idea is sound you guys can shove you're down vote's up you're a**
---
Was basically implying that in the brackets 🤥
---
So far its the guy at the farm that was seeking a cure for his dogs cancer.
---
Havent reached the end of the story yet, but I'm pretty sure it was not a happy ending.
---
I think people are downvoting you for whining. 
---
“Oh I’m so important, I killed the queen on my own, they didn’t position the nuke properly, I’m a bloodied melee build and the rads got me because the nuke zone changed”.... You come across as so entitled. 
---
Maybe just, accept your flux has gone and move on?
---
I think it was a mixture of a lot of things. No one was running cripple so she hardly ever landed, and we didn't have many melee players to damage her when she did land. Not to mention that we didn't have any real high level players. That was the worst run of that event I've had so far. I've retooled my own build to add crippling so that maybe we can keep her down for a while.
---
It was bad enough that I ran dry of 5mm and broke both my legendaries.
---
Don't worry, pedants'R'us are always on the job.
---
Have a nice day.
---
That's totally fair. Honestly a great compromise in reguards to gear is just have some legendary effects behave differently against players or in survival mode, so that they can balance them separately.  
---
I'm sure it feels PvP gets favored in regards to balance sometimes, but Bethesda forsure know a large portion of their audience play this game purely for PvE, so I can't see them getting too hardcore with nurfs.
---
you want people drop a really obvious DEATH BAG™ on death so only assholes with op pvp builds or oblivious people touch your junk. you want to make the penalty for death even easier because some person you don't know took YOUR junk after YOU died in the first place.
---
Your camp sounds nice, any pictures to show it?

---
&gt; how low the damage gain is.
---
How low is it?
---
I can even accept going to a meno and swap inside some builds/setups. If we are fearing this to be exploited on PVP for example
---
Go break a fog crawlers legs and let him lay on the ground screaming in pain, feels awful, but I need my fiber optics
---
Wooby?
---
you do realize that sentinel players are abusing jumping to prevent stagger while also keeping the legendary effect on? This reason is why heavy weapon PA players, which are already fragile (the irony) became obsolete once people found out and started bunny hopping all about. Then there's the Tesla rifle bug that allows the arcs to do full damage when you aim at the ground, and the splits do full damage instead of weaker % of the damage anyhow, meaning a charged shotgun build can be tapped to down people in a couple shots.  These things need fixing, badly.
---
Dope, I'm glad you agree with me entirely.
---
I have a 2 star bloodied explosive lever action rifle.  I go back and forth with that one and my AA auto handmade.  The handmade does a lot less dmg, but against certain enemies the fire rate can just cut them down as I can squeeze off 25 rounds in no time and distance and accuracy is really good. I’ve surprised a lot of players in survival mode with that weapon.

&gt; Its Bethesda's own fault for including PvP - in a builds based, gear dependent game. I'll pass on PvP because its pointless when its largely just picking the right perks and buying/trading for the right gear. A proper skills based twitch shooter with PvP is far better in regards to balancing - and I'm far from a twitch god player myself. 
---
There are several RPG based shooters that have done pvp pretty well. It's not easy though, that's for sure.
---
I can't imagine they will mess up PvE in any real meaningful way, a ton of the content they are making is straight up PvE.

I use the Lever Action when I am not rushing and conserving bullets. It's just as effective as the Combat Rifle as Speed Demon gives me a quick reload and Gun-fu switches targets for me. The Lever Action is fine for non SBQ fights, ghoul hunting at the GC, or mutie stomping.
---
&gt; which more and more people are using because of low game price of ~10e or so on cdkey stores
---
You don't need a second game key for a mule account, it's easy enough to do it with just one.
---
Okay that one I do have. Thanks for heads up.
---
What type of build are you wanting? Did you have a specific play style you enjoy?
---
That's what I was imagining - it would be a really cool way to see how different builds can work together on a larger scale, which is something you don't really see in SBQ or Encryptid as everyone kinda has to lump together in the open.

Yes. Spacebar for PC, I don't know for console

"a griefer is someone who attacks someone unprovoked."
---
Lmao you seriously define this as being a griefer? The word means someone who harasses using UNINTENDED mechanics in the game. Everything that happened was perfectly normal here. No hacking. No server stalking. No verbal abuse.
---
Sounds like OP is just another one of you softies, afraid of any human interaction aside from being given free shit. It's fucking sad. "OMG this guy killed me and wrecked my base! Griefers!"

lol, poor guy, my stash is 90 percent junk, and i still carry 200 pounds of it on me, i just cant get rid of it. thats why i play in pacifist
---
WOW.. THIS REALLY HELPS! THANK YOU!
---
Sorry I made a mistake there - I meant the quest fails in the sense that it ends. If any waves are completed, the quest technically succeeds and players get rewards proportionally to how many waves they completed.
---
Haha, what part of Northen California are you from?
---
Green thumb gets you the raw flux.  Now tell us how you're getting the fluids'n'mass to stabilise all of that.
---
To be fair I haven't thoroughly tested all games but the one where they didn't work was Elder Scrolls Online - I had the Summerset expansion and my wide didn't, when we got the second xbox she couldn't get to summerset without paying for it (the expansions are account bound but it might be just on that game).
---
That's tough because there are people who aquired those sets through legitimate means, and while I agree, its obscenely powerful, there's got to be a middle ground so that while its not god tier, its still viable for people to use.  An example would be if the % numbers were much lower, it would be great for snipers since they don't move as often, but again it would have to be brought down a lot so that it isn't so frustrating outside for staggering/vats/radiation.
---
Neither does anybody else apparently lmao.
---
Everyone agree with you that the game isn’t perfect, that is not why you are getting downvoted.
---
You are getting downvoted because you came to a online forum to complain about something that is your fault and your fault only. It’s a survival game, you die and there is a slight “penalty” which is loosing the junk you are carrying. You take the risk to run a low health high dmg build, the risk seems to have not worked in your favor this time and instead of sucking it up like an adult and take the blame for your risk you come here and blame everyone else and want to change the game because of it. Loot bags dropping on death isn’t a bad mechanic or anything it’s part of the game.
---
The auto stimpack mod/perk card maybe he could be healing through the damage while serendipity triggers repeatedly.
---
Lost my Unyielding Sent Chest this week, just disappeared. Not a happy feeling at all.
---
doubt, its not that hard to get that much stuff. i have more and its always on me, pacifist ftw
---
The requests for multiple decks we can switch between has been around since launch, have an upvote to try and keep momentum. 
---
I feel this is a major QOL issue that could easily be resolved.
---
I've been playing with 3 pieces of unyielding armor and the results are amazing. Specially you get lots of carry weight thanks to the extra strength. A good combo is to keep your rads high, i keep my radiation around 80% and the perk card that gives you extra strength (max 5) when radiated to maximize effects. My bloodied miner gauntlet can deal almos 1K damage on regular hits. Add also perks like tenderizer or adrenaline and you are a monster killer. You can get killed fast, which is why I keep the mysterious stranger   that revives me on the luck tree
---
i barely see ANYONE using the X-01 these days. most PVP players are using normal armor with legendary prefixes. most PVE players are using Excavator, T-51, or legendary Armor
---
Flux is the real currency.
---
other guy got it maybe right "out of combat" like back to camp and spend to much time swapping cards in and out.would be nice to go 'camp perks please'. going out to play can I have my 'night time perks in '.
---
diddy........... iv'e forgot to swap out happy camper and super duper  AGAIN.
---
There should be another option that says workshop repair
---
I don't know what you are talking about
---
For sure, full auto weapon dps is pretty unreal. People complained about them pretty hard for a long time because they were so **incredibly** inefficient, but they were always the superior damage. Now they've been buffed pretty heavily and frankly unless you're not into farming enough mats to play a full auto playstyle, you really should be using them over single shots. Imagine if your AA auto handmade was also bloodied explosive... I want to take a moment to talk about AA. A lot of people are mistaken about how armor works, once you pass certain damage thresholds enemy DR means less and less. Once you're a bit above 1500 damage per bullet no enemy reduces your damage by any meaningful amount, including SBQ. That's why AA is much better on low damage high fire rate weapons and it's totally worthless on melee and snipers.
---
&gt; It's easy to end up with a ton of spare flux, especially now that HR fluids, glowing and hardened mass are instanced.
---
It's a lot harder.  Now you have to tag the mobs, you used to be able to get fluids'n'mass from left over meat pies.
---
After you you hit triangle to inspect, you should then be able to hit square to repair it.
---
Who tf is Wooby?
---
finally going to sell my insane amount of junk, i can make 50 bulk lead in an hour, i can finally sell it, now if i could just turn it into stimpacks
---
TSE needed help because my 'primed' TSE 50 Cal made me wonder where the tool tip 'recommended 8 players' came from for the SBQ. Were we talking '8 people with tomhawks' here?
---
And it is lvl 35. There was room for improvement. LeL.
---
Just seems to me they chose the worse possible way to 'fix' the problem and whoever got shafted be damned.
---
Fast forward to today and many of the rebalances still come across as ham-fisted, including the one coming tomorrow that is going to severely castrate one of my toons and I still don't understand why. Luckily I am currently weary of the 'steamroller' playstyle but thing is, after tomorrow I cannot go back to it even if I want to.
---
Another choice taken away by decree due to PvP.
---
So now every time I see people clamoring 'dis OP, plz nerf' I get a visceral reaction to it.
---
If youre thinking about it pretty hard, and got the atoms for it, buy it already!! Pretty sweet looking imo.
---
But it still need to has more dps than the other builds or whats the point of sacrificing health?
---
--close
---
Don't feel silly, the squeaky wheel and all that.
---
You don't show up on the map if you don't kill anyone. To you everyone is a griefer right?
---
my camps on top of the senca rocks, ill be selling mats and beer
---
Not until item for item trading is possible. At least, I won't be making any large purchases with it. 
---
The problem with flux is that it weighs so much. Seems like you'd need a mule to hold it all.
---
You on Xbox, cause I’ll definitely give your camp some business lol
---
Yes and yes. Only a couple though.
---
Good old head-cannon.
---
that took a couple of moments before I twigged
---
wow. #hotcakes.
---
Hmm. Any idea how to fix it?
---
Ps4, sorry about that :(
---
reguardless, that doesn't disprove my point that Two shot is still viable. My point was that I liked Two shot more than Armor piercing.
---
Also tongs, which are petty common. I have like 300 screws, but no springs.
---
Y for Xbox
---
Here we go. Another TSE situation. More nerfs. Yay.
---
all the time, whole area
---
The woman locked inside Morgantown airport or the ranger that attacks alone the raiders to recover his dog. You find them together in a cage at the Freak Show
---
Cool ok. It may be as we've just had an update.
---
It's easy to chalk it up to inventory mismanagement until it happens to ya; luckily the only thing I've had go missing was a Bone Raider painted calibrated excavator leg during a West Tek run. 30 mins to do some nuking to replace that. That's over 420 hours of gameplay.
---
Haven't experienced any mutation or perk card related weirdness.
---
.. maybe this is the goal of the upcoming high level vault raid we've been waiting for
---
&gt;You don’t need weapon balancing, you need the option to respec. 
---
&gt;It’s bullshit that you can’t easily re-spec between PvP and PvE setups.
---
Do you really need a full special Respec between pvp and pve? For that matter, do you even have time to not only swap your perks, but move all your special around? Running around fighting some super mutants and another player was in "oh hey dude, hang on a minute, let me go in and swap my build so we can fight."
---
How about buffing other effects to bring them in line, not more nerfs.
---
Jet pack.
---
&gt; each unit of ammunition always costs 1 flux
---
By "unit" you mean each "n rounds" you craft at a time, like each 100 (180 with ammosmith 2) rounds of .50 cal.
---
Since you use the auto handmade wanna give me that b/e lever action? :D *wink, flirt, wink*
---
this is what I do.. much quicker than finding it in the pipboy to untrack it from there...
---
It was a glitch on the game it said I completed the challenge of play 7600 hours but I have played since beta and wow really
---
No it ends. I've beaten it. There's either one or two you're missing or it's a bug.
---
Wednesday for my fellow Australians
---
Legendary exchange machines... hmm sounds like borderlands grinder. Are there specifics on the mechanics? Like two shotguns plus rocket launcher equals explosive shotgun?
---
When i have this active in falloutcustom.ini i cant load into game world,with old one when some textures is missing in atomic shop and any textures in game is purple i can load into gameworld.
---
Get them from loot drops, event rewards, or vendors.  
---
Drops and vendors are random, most event drops are fixed.  
---
Vendors have whatver has been sold to them recently.  
---
My favorites are 1H fast or medium, most of which I've gotten as loot drops.
---
Which one is "best" depends on what level you are..and to an extent, what perks you have.
---
What level you are is going to dictate where you can go to get more.  
---
At about L27, you can start farming WS.  your legendary take will climb, 
---
then you get to experiement and find what weapon works for you and what doesn't.
---
Oh just you wait lmao. When you get to the cabin, make sure you look at the little overhang/porch thing. You’ll discover their fate there
---
i dont see server anchoring, but im gonna set up a private server once those come out. i want to have tons of camps to build. with infinte budget. :)   and i could see weekly challanenges to rebuild a location, like  a weekly challenge for steel, 1 million steel needs to be donated to start fixing harpers ferry, and each player can donate 100 a day, and if you contribute you grt a reward
---
Gotta grind for that glowing meat steak and the other food to up my melee to keep my damage up😂
---
Yea, I just purchased that too, is that the only other good one that you know?
---
Dude you’re horrible. You think ballistics need a buff? No one runs melee anymore, they’re horrendous in PvP. Melee hits don’t even connect half the time. A vats crit automatic gun is by the far the most powerful in the game. These are all terrible suggestions.
---
Make the game a bit better maybe? Make stealthboys reveal you if you attack, make automatic rifles build crits in vats just a little slower. These two changes would make a massive difference in game balance
---
Looks like in strength you’re dabbling in multiple weapon areas.  Choosing a specific build like unarmed or 2 handed and getting more perks that help that type would work to increase damage output. Having a bit of all maybe makes for a more mediocre output for all. Dunno.  😊
---
See TSE nerfs.
---
The game's lone human NPC trapped deep within the bowels of Bethesda's development room.
---
I learned that that game was decent but it was the people that I was playing with that made it so enjoyable.  I have 240+ hours and I quit playing in January. Now that they have all moved on I'm solo and cant get invested enough to find friends again.
---
Survival mode is pretty cool the 2 times I tried it out, but obviously I wont be making to many friends there. 
---
I'm on PS4 to btw if you wanna give it try together one of these days.
---
I like pancakes!
---
Yeah, this is just the ash heap. There’s awful stuff happening under ground, you’re witnessing like, tectonic instability?
---
There are multiple builds that are viable. Not just one.
---
When you have one of these perk cards active and you walk up to search said vessel, whether it be getting double meat from a Brahmin after you kill it or more Kim from a chem box, you'll see that there is the option to press y to search the container or body.
---
After you press y if the search is successful the animation will pop up on the left side of your screen and additional items will pop up in the box or body.
---
You sure? It *really, really* shouldn't work like that. The server should share that with all clients
---
It'll be interesting to see if this has any overall effect on the in game economy or trading markets.
---
Searched up inside the vault and this was the recent post , got me good tbh.
---
Optimized Servos are good for legs. And VATS matrix overlay for increased  vats hit chance. Optimized Bracers for less ap cost for power attacks. I use those.
---
You're going to need all three Picklocks and all three Hackers - regular, expert, and master - for the silo.
---
What's Bethesda's current stance on mods like this? Are they ok with people using mods as long as they don't affect gameplay?
---
They aren't invulnerable. There are more than one way to win fights.
---
Oh. Yea free this man.
---
You might also find that getting travelling pharmacy 3 and nixing strong back in favor of more damage for one weapon type might be better.  Then get deep pockets on your armor and calibrated shocks on your excavator power armor. Lots of carry ability then and again more space for focused damage output.
---
I have seen her getting stuck quite frequently, but she is still taking damage every time I've seen it.
---
A couple of players in my group (myself included) use weapons and perks that cause Stagger, which will also keep the SBQ on the ground, but this doesn't seem to be working as well since the last patch.
---
The reason you say this game is easy it’s not because you’re able to one shot everything but because this game never penalizes you. No matter how many times you die, how bad you play, eventually everyone will reach lvl 300 and will have all perks unlocked and better and better weapons. If everytime you die you loose a perk card, a level or 50% of your stuff (including weapons) you wouldn’t be here telling me how you one shot everything, which I agree with you, this game is really easy but for other reasons, not because weapons are OP.
---
All those mine fires don't help either.
---
[Power Creep](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+creep&amp;rlz=1C1ASRM_enCA793CA793&amp;oq=power+creep&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.3199j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8). It's a real threat to any online game. Also making other effects better doesn't solve the issue at all. The issue is that these sets make a large variety of playstyles 100% non viable. You straight up, no matter how good you are, cannot use a non Vats sniper build and get anywhere close to what a guy with a "Proper" sentinel vats build.  
---
These sets are different from the others in the way that they force specific perk cards or weapons to be used (Staggers, Vats, Radiation damage). This is the chief complaint people have, as it is basically a "Either do this or get fucked" situation, where the rest of the game is made around you fidning a play style that best suits you.   
---
I don't think rational people want these sets to be useless, they just want to be able to do things like play a Sniper and not be forced to use Vats, or play a melee build but be able to use power armor, all while being AT LEAST competitive.
---
I may have done the same thing with a "short pew" blueprint
---
Good points there, that's what I keep telling myself to avoid a big let-down.
---
&gt;You may find more value in selling you multi-star items through player vending.
---
You mean somebody out there is looking to buy my 3* rolling pin and tire iron collection? :-P
---
I dont think they should increase drop rates, I like the elusive rarity of things right now. The only fun thing about this game tbh is the market stuff.
---
But yeah the legendary 3* enemies dropping 1* stuff is unnerving
---
I don't see how it wouldn't affect the market as it stands.
---
I think it will on some level. So many high level items are trade only or over 25k caps now, i doubt people will sell anything crazy.
---
Im sure itll be good for people selling bulk and aid items
---
I can guarantee you that in PvE anyone is using only melee
---
So this exploit needs fixing, totally fair.
---
But 'castrating' Sentinel because is exploitable is not the solution.
---
Fixing the exploit and handing a nice temporary suspension - as in 'a couple of days', not as in 'temporary forever', I am a great fan of measured response, punishment fitting the crime and nuance - is.
---
"Big Bad John" "give me 40 acres" "put my little shoes away" the list is endless.
---
Depending on the 3rd star, I'd give you 5k. ;) /s
---
I'll never understand why people think adding an aoe effect to your gun alone isn't a great effect, it also has to pile out damage, same with two shot.   
---
They work just fine, stop being so angry about nothing.
---
Thanks this helps a lot
---
For the Free States personally I’d replace ‘killing cryptids’ with ‘killing military robots’. Free States has little to nothing to do with Cryptids, but hated the US Govt; so killing military grade robotics would likely be more their speed.
---
Good tip!  Though I feel even worse now that these posts show up every so often, and somehow I missed them all.  When I think of all the stimpaks I missed out on!
---
It’s not a mobile game and yes your just makeing shut up baseless assumptions
---
Alright. Time to get off of your high horse. You're in the same boat as the rest, and if Bethesda is encouraged to nerf, we are all going to suffer.
---
Claim the munitions factory.  Seems like every time I claim or defend that place ballistic fiber is included in the rewards.  I stockpiled a bunch pretty quickly that way
---
Nerf all % dmg reduction armor and replace it with + armor while standing. + armor against players etc. %damage, % damage reduction should not exist this game. Also, All players should have passive that reduces damage from another players by 50%. i hope that will make pvp something else than one-shot fiesta. Also armor ignoring perks are ridiculous too. what's the point of armor if you can just ignore 75% of it? poor PA users
---
Kinda funny that a "Mothman cultist" is struggling with ballistic fiber. Just go find your lord and savior and ask for some of his wings.
---
McClintock is the best place to find it though. I had my camp near it during my early levels and would do a loot pass through there first thing every day I logged in. I've never fallen below 100 since that time and I even have to sell the excess when I get over 150.
---
If anything, PA should be markedly buffed.
---
The downside is they aren't very durable but I use the perk card that gives a chance of repairing a weapon when attacking. It procs fairly often. I also use the weapon artisan perk to get it 200% condition so the weapon damage gets boosted too. It goes from about 18 dmg to 40 something
---
Especially french speaking people.  Thew work "PEW" sounds like the french word "PIEU" wich is a "Stake", so easy mistake.  A pew in french would be litteraly translated to "church bench"
---
The balances are ok as it is. Melee does a lot of single target damage but has to get to the target. Ranged hides behind chameleon and does quite a bit of damage. Armor types all have a weakness, the same for builds. The problem isn’t balancing anything, it’s lack of strategy to overcome those obstacles.
---
To many people complain about this sort of thing and it all dumbs down to the same thing. Lack of knowledge of getting around these obstacles. I have two high levels. One melee and one ranged. I can tell you that ranged complains about melee and their damage/armor but when does melee get an explosive vampires deathclaw gauntlet that you can throw?
---
Other than ranged hiding in chameleon, I’ve literally never found a situation in ranged or melee that I couldn’t overcome rather easily. Ballistic damage is high enough, melee is high enough, even energy is being balanced and near enough.
---
So in summary, balance isn’t needed, better players are needed. To many people want to be able to one shot everything, until they are one shotted because Bethesda listened to the complaint.
---
Lol, i have fun just going around photographing shit.
---
haha...I'm with you.. Gonna make the longest looking gun possible and name it Long Pew.
---
If I had some advice for your steel gains, scrap weapons, kill some bad guys, loot their weapons and scrap em, easy steel to be earned that way
---
Yesterday I went to help someone out against another player. I walked in and this player hit me once and o was done. I’m level 149, and not a weak character. He had an explosive gun and level 140, and I didn’t even get one shot off. I’d say that’s a bit unbalanced. How is that not unbalanced?  I personally would rather actually have a fight if I’m playing PvP, how is that even fun?!
---
Breach &amp; clear or lode bearing events starting/ending?
---
maybe if it worked only if you're really stand still. Not moving, jumping, shooting, etc, it would be balanced
---
The purveyor is coming, you just get a bunch of rolling pins and lead pipes, exchange them for tokens, then buy your dream god tier Legendaries, no more grinding needed 👌
---
Your statement shows you neither have the knowledge or authority to even comment on such a matter. Nobody is immortal in this game without hacking. You can kill a player using this with a simple vats headshot critical.
---
Not that silly lol, the more people that bring it up hopefully the more likely.
---
I'm not on a high horse fam, I'm just not going into hysteria about balance changes like you obviously are. If they nurf something that's too powerful, that doesn't do anything but help everyone.
---
What was the hardest to do?
---
I see it more as a dropping some shit
---
I understand your complaints and have a set of the Ass/Sent. I don't at all feel like I am as invulnerable as you describe it. I lose half of my PvP fights easily but maybe I'm not good or only fight other god-like-equipped  opponents so my anecdotal experience doesn't prove anything as fact... just like yours doesn't.
---
Here is what I'd like you and everyone to consider. Stop trying to go back and alter the fundamentals of the equipment and perks every time the player base finds a way to formulate a winning solution to a \*specific encounter\*!! Instead, alter the settings on a per-server-basis so (using myself as example) I can set up my adventure build the way I think it works best and if I take that build into PvP the server may be set up to 'balance' things \*in that server\*!! 
---
That way people will gravitate to the servers with the settings they like...the player base will dictate by voting with their joining certain types of servers and avoiding others.
---
A simple solution to my god-armor versus a player with crap armor...in a server that has (for now we will call it) 'Armor Balanced' settings ( labeled so you know when you join what you have got into). The damage resistance of my great armor and my opponents crap armor are averaged and apply to both of us. Voila! And if I don't like it I start avoiding Armor balanced servers and I don't have to go and continuously respect my build overtime the powers that be decide to reinvent the wheel instead of simply design new race tracks for all the wheel owners to ride on!!
---
That is just one off-the-top-of-my-head way to do it, granted there are likely many better ways but you get the idea.
---
That isn’t the point of the tax at all.  The tax is to reduce inflation.
---
There are a lot of us that PVP almost exclusively and have friendly chats or exchange "gg".
---
I think it'll have very little impact. Most of the Market is Trade or Discussion posts with very few Sell/Buy posts.
---
Preach it brother. Glad to see other people see how fucking weird of a situation this is. In what world is power armor useless but leather armor stops nukes? SMH.
---
What’s skill set it this on?
---
If it doesn't, there is no way I'm launching player vending.  I'll just sit on it until camps are protected
---
Apparently you can’t get good Legendaries from the purveyor as your supposed to ‘adventure’ into the wasteland to get your godly weapons
---
Seriously dude, you've replied to every single post in this thread and said get a be weapon get an fe weapon, you should sell your Tse for 2k caps, etc.  Wtf is your goal here?  Like, every SINGLE comment you have replied saying the same shit.   I don't get it
---
Its a good game. It has technical issues, we can all admit that. Can play for hours without crashing one day and the next day you can't stop.
---
The world they've created is beautiful. The story telling is diferent than previous titles. You have to dig for it, read a lot of notes and terminals and listen to holotapes... you get as much out of the story than you put in... But it's there and it's damn good.
---
You have perkloadoutmanager in both misc and archive2list.
---
Move betterinventory.ba2 to misc.
---
May not fix the issue you're having, but that isn't helping. Worst come to worse, backup your custom.ini and remove mods one by one to find out which one isn't compatible.
---
If you don't complete them in the correct "order", then it bugs out. I have the same issue.
---
I should also add that the purring sound during the Bethesda logo plays but as soon as he gets to the main menu and beyond it just doesn't work.
---
Looks like we've got someone who paid money for thier gear and don't want to lose thier pay to win advantage.
---
The last patch seems to have opened up the window a bit on what gets lost and how far back on a server crash. I lost 20 min of nuke flora farming, it just never saved before crashing.  Hopefully you did not actually lose the materials as well.
---
What I mean is, my sheep staff does in regular damage at 20% health is 450. But regardless of what my health the poisoned staff or club only does 1 cldamage
---
Yep, looting corpses is not as fun as it used to be. Been here since beta level 100+.  Over the weekend playing in several areas around the map, ran into a lot more 3-star enemies than normal with as usual sh!t rewards. I stopped even picking them up.  I have limited time to play consistently so when I do get to play, i play for as long as possible...maybe 2-3 hours at most. But playing the last week or two sucks...so many 3 stars that drop just a scalpel, a sweet roll...or that trusty zero star level 25 shish kebab or two shot laser gun or wood armor.   They are all high level kills with non-scaled loot.   Hopefully a patch will make it better...lol but i doubt it.
---
You know that’s BS right? Rockstar for example used the other guys definition of griefing when they spoke about how they were going to deal with griefers on the dead mode they call a multiplayer. Your definition of other more widely accepted definitions are quite different. In fact judging by how defensive you got I would assume that you are a griefer as well but hate to be labeled as such.
---
HOO DINI!
---
Thx i will try it.
---
Yeah I usually do. I'm sitting on 600 atm, again I had just started farming for it. I was only out because I just used a bit more than 400 steel for ammo. When you do that use the scrapper perk for maximum scrap gains. Thanks for the advice though.
---
Yup, pays to be patient. Everyone else goes there when the bomb goes of, I try to time it before it wears off.
---
My worry is the legendary vending machines will take a lot of legendary items out of the player pool because people will want script more than caps. Thus they won’t be putting their legendary items up for sale in the player vending machines. Checking the markets any good 3* legendary items almost always seems to be held by people who don’t want caps just trades, so I figure some/most of those will go to the legendary vendors for script.
---
Of course friend, good luck out in the wastes
---
For me, kill 20 players as I avoid PvP as much as possible haha.
---
Not until they fix laser damage
---
Gods yes, when they announced the new system I started putting every legendary I got into storage.
---
Then I started swapping out 3-stars for the 1-2 stars because my storage is full of crap legendaries.
---
Then I started swapping out light 3-stars for the heavier 3-stars (though I'm not too far down that road).
---
Now, I just need to decide if I should turn in all the ones that are crappy (wood armor?  Sickles?  Fat mans?) and hang on to the ones that would be worth re-rolling if it turns out they put something like that in.  Or, do I assume they don't and just turn in everything that isn't worth something as-is?
---
Something tells me I'll have decision paralysis until they actually announce what the system will be.
---
If you are willing to feed it, yes. But I admit that I have only used a bloody explosive version. So it was probably the best LMG...
---
If Bethesda keeps nerfing I will leave the game.  If Bethesda brings out new legendary effects that upset the “meta” I would be excited.  Never ask for nerfs—especially for things you do not own.
---
Bethesda’s note basically said get more of those tokens so you can buy more Legendaries. They didn’t say you need to scrap certain weapon type in order to get that legendary of the same type, that could be harder, because if you want to buy a better lever action, you need to find and scrap a bunch of legendary lever action first. What they’ve said is all garbage count as long as it has stars. This makes it soooo easy.
---
It's the same tactics lad anyone can see the parallels between them and see where f76 will go next so it might as well be referred to as such
---
I know that's the official line, but reducing the money supply whilst leaving demand unchanged does not solve inflation....it does the opposite...
---
Yeah, which means many would not touch the junk. Which means you would not even lose junk on death. Which means death would only have positive effects. 
---
No. Simply no.
---
I would say this could be a nice feature if we had a Karma system and if there was other negative effects of dying. But as it is right now it would make the game silly.
---
Unyielding will not help a range build
---
I'm a full time PVPer and PVE to me is just a grind to get mats to continue to PVP. I don't want it to be nerfed for those that play it exclusively, but let's be totally honest here... it's not a challenge. The only mildly difficult encounter is the sheepsquatch robit' and that's because it sucks to be bloodied and be a conduit. The queen is just a bullet grind.
---
My best legit drops are lvl 25 1\* Bloodied Handmade and 3\* Assassin's Sentinel armour piece -- I'm level 91 or something like that. Never seen anything with explosives, don't really need it for my build, but they're rare as ass.
---
I've bought better 3-star weapons and armor from Vendors that anything I could get in a drop. 
---
Even if I do get a 3 star, I don't think my 3 star rolling pin is something useful.
---
RC
---
Yesh, IF the script is of value. No one will trade in a high-level 3-star if they need to trade in 20 of them for 1 "Item" If anything I'd assume they would trade in 50 1-star. But until we know what the value is, I don't think anyone should do anything. :)
---
Correct me if i'm wrong, but with shotguns specifically aren't they doing an update to them because the damage isn't intened to work the way it currently does so they are fixing it, rather than tuning damage numbers? 
---
I mean yea, TSE weapons could get really out of hand, even in pve.
---
I guess I'm unclear as to why you blame pvp for these changes, since to me they feel important to pve as well, since you don't want someone capable of soloing SBQ but also want all builds to do decent damage.
---
Calm down Satan, you can friend the Murder Church pastor and build for him, all is not lost....
---
I really love the whole automation vs. Workers story bits.
---
I’m level 126, I’ll often invite new players to team up. There are no real npcs so it’s a good way to show people around, open up some fast travel points for them and earn them some caps and xp. The goody bags are quite normal, most high level players do this 😃
---
picked me up all wrong. I'm saying that in easy areas, I can one shot. If it were ALL like that, then boring. If o/p weapons make it ridiculiously easy.............then, whats the point.
---
just my personal opinion........and I dont have any of the super duper guns anyway.
---
as to penaltys...... thats a good idea... getting killed should be an "oh Shit" moment.
---
Stick with 1* in Concentrated fire, the additional 2 points only increase dmg by 4% in VATS.
---
I've had a few times were they don't show up in the "stored" tab but they are still stored and when viewing them in their respective normal tab (wall or floor or whatever) you see the number in parenthesis that shows how many you already have stored.
---
I like that idea. Will I be able to keep bear arms though? Most of my heavy weapons I plan on selling to the legendary vendor but I want to keep my Gatling gun for the ranged damage. I also use Power Armor quite a bit( anywhere that has high level enemies like a nuke zone or the bog(
---
Nothing to do with level, it's just people being people. Some are alright, some are dicks.
---
What if I don't use vats? what if My character is a no vats Sniper? The whole point people are making is the meta you obviouly love because you're geared for it requires a handful of cards and weapons or you lose. Its bad design and the devs know it.
---
The bone raider excavator paint makes an animal noise when you land
---
I did this too.
---
They need others to tell them what to play because they can't form their own opinions.
---
You're going from a  small segment of the player base participating in the trade market, to facilitating every player to participate through vending.  Presumedly you're increasing supply of all goods across the board. This *should* affect the value of things at the very least.
---
Clipboards for Springs, they're everywhere, I got like 300
---
That's a childish outlook man. Look at any MMORPG, any MOBA, hell even card games. Power creep is to be avoided, and balancing by adding content rarely ever solves any problems, it just makes more.  
---
Leave if that's all it takes to upset you that much.
---
There really isn't one "best" weapon. 
---
For solo leveling, you want the fastest weapon that can one-shot enemies with. Early on that might be an two-handed weapon. The more strength, melee mutations, perks or other boosts you get, the faster weapons you can use and still one-shot. Regardless of what weapon, instigating is king for solo melee clear speed. 
---
For boss fights, you'll need to maximize damage per second (DPS - via bloodied, furious, attack speed...) and sustain (vampire). Only some of those legendary affixes can appear together.   
---
With player vending, you might be able to buy reasonably priced level-appropriate 1\* weapons for a modest amount of caps. We'll see Tuesday.
---
Thanks. Was thinking to post it on the the official forums as well, but those seems to be under maintenance now. At least last time I checked
---
I have a exterminator 50% limb damage reduced weight death gauntlet, an executioner swing speed +1 endurance knife( one of my faves) and a newly acquired assassin swing speed reduced weight fully upgraded mahogany bay. Which one do you think I should use?
---
Lots of sources for Cobalt at WS.
---
Violet, I believe you have to visit a different nuke zone to find sufficient quantity.
---
Without putting on a tinfoil hat, this would have been an effective way for Bethesda to remove all of the heavily duped items from game after the bannination waves. They could just load up dev characters with max caps to purchase everything, and then just sit on it.
---
😊👍
---
I almost never see legendaries at westek. Its just RNG.
---
Nice!!
---
True true
---
Well, I would. But no silver skin for the SMG.
---
Because they made PA so useless compared to leather, I like the new PA skins but won’t spend an atom on them.
---
*”I’m sure that lesson will... ... stick with him”.*
---
Why do you farm sugar?
---
any item i want that isn't unreasonably priced (i.e. 1 canned dog food = 500 caps)
---
Fingers crossed!
---
Oooo what I wouldn't give to be thrown into a deep ravine
---
Enclave with the dad jokes.
---
Seconded. It's probably going to be a lazer rifle for me.
---
The range of melee weapons is extremely low with no reach. In swinging you must compensate for the movement of your enemy.
---
Granted, this is too much to ask against players and VATS melee misses often there.
---
A lot of people and critics says this game is not for the Fallout Fans, but i think it's exactly the opposite! If you are just searching for a MMO or a competitive shooter, you will be disappointed.
---
But if you like the Fallout Universe, from the flavor of the futuristic 50's to the Vault Boy, you should have a lot of fun.
---
Anyway i hope Bethesda will seriously work on the game to improve it and to make it living for a very long time ! But i trust them !
---
ABSORBENT AND YELLOW AND POROUS IS HE!!!
---
Has this been changed? I can't find anything anymore that does double duty.
---
I saw I have 20 of them under MISC and thought maybe I clicked a wrong button and bought them in Atom store, then I remembered they said you can get it by killing a boss.
---
Martial artist plus 3 armor pieces with weapon weight reduction. Carry ALL THE WEAPONS
---
&gt; I understand your complaints and have a set of the Ass/Sent. I don't at all feel like I am as invulnerable as you describe it. I lose half of my PvP fights easily but maybe I'm not good or only fight other god-like-equipped opponents so my anecdotal experience doesn't prove anything as fact... just like yours doesn't. 
---
Its not that you're invulnerable, its not that you can't be killed, its the meta of only being effected by a handful of effects/perks that restricts build variety that is frustrating people. I am aware staggers, Vat's Critical, and radiation can bring someone using this set down, I think a lot of people feel as though its frustrating because they don't want to use those things in thier builds. Being forced to use an aim bot, or automatic weapons, or radiation weapons, because there is literally no other way to defeat someone with that set just feels bad. That's not to mention the fact if you wanted to use power armor in pvp you're just straight up fucked because again, regular in game damage resistance is nothing compared to flat DR.
---
Aw, now I miss my Wazer Wifle.
---
He’s talking about nerfing builds that can make PvE unbearable or consistently one dimensional which is what happened since they nerfed TSE’s. They needed a nerf but not like they did.. now every person &amp; their mom is using a melee build or a sneaky sniper one shot build lmao. Then there’s the occasional heavy user but that’s it. Destiny is a game that balances PvE &amp; PvP similarly &amp; typically destroys something in PvE to bring down its effectiveness in PvP. Obviously much different games but if they completely break the sneaky sniper build for example then everyone in this game will be running around with melee’s. &amp; imagine if they nerf melee’s..? Wtf do we use them lmao
---
The damage was a little bit over the top but it only became a cause for concern because of PvP.
---
Hence me blaming PvP.
---
And my misgivingns stem from the fact that there is a measurable difference between what the devs say they intend to do and how in actuality this intention translates to implementation.
---
There is a distinct possibility that after tomorrow explosive shotguns are rendered obsolete given how poorly they seem to understand how certain mechanics in their own game work and how they interact with other mechanics.
---
Said that hey, there is always room for things to go right. It would be unfair to say that they have not done certain things very right lately - the Impostor event being one, a challenge that has actual mechanics, colour me impressed (no sarcasm here) and the actual Sheepsquatch being another along with the event that goes with it.
---
Said that past behaviour and the wording in the announcement make me... queasy.
---
I took that toon for one last blood fest in Wes-Tek last night and then with a heavy heart I let him go and went back to the drawing board to see what I can make of him next.
---
I'm pretty sure that's due to not being able to wear armor *and* Power Armor at the same time.
---
Yes! Huge quality of life improvement, I'd think.
---
Be warned, that at 5 hours in you could plausibly be 25% or more through the content of the main quest. You may become extremely less impressed when you hit the point you realize how little content there is and people boasting of 700 hours mean they looped around a few small areas for hundreds and hundreds of hours.
---
I did a 15 intelligence build before.  It felt like overkill. Power patcher is only necessary at camp, gunsmith 2 is plenty with luck of the draw for in the field, i almost never fix guns, but keep a 5 for camp when you do.
---
bloodied mess in luck is important. 15% more damage is huge the way it is calculated. lone wanderer in charisma is also good for % damage reduction as well
---
I would also look at slow metaboliser again, not a great card. but i dont really like the endurance cards any way.  still like at least 5 point there though.
---
Has this been changed? None of my soups give hunger and thirst perks... they on work on thirst. I've been away from the game for a while and a lot has changed...
---
When I get bored and run into a low level player, I’ll sometimes add them to show them around and gain xp faster. I don’t have a mic, so I usually message them. My favorite thing lately is helping people join the Enclave at very low levels.
---
Lode baring. Does it at start and finish of event.
---
Or keep the game the way it is and you leave.  These things you want to “nerf”—how many of them do you own?
---
You wanna know what’s worse?
---
I found 2 three star enemies that didn’t even drop a legendary. Wtf.
---
I know right.
---
They had those at one point in [this trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Og3A5yIs3b8) around 47 seconds as the man runs into the portable toilet there is a robot station by the windmill. This trailer is weird because some items don't exist in like the barn walls that look different but they also have some things that are or have been added like the deer skull decoration that was added in the last patch and the early version of player vending machines coming this Tuesday. so I think there is hope of them being added sometime in the future
---
You are right on both counts.
---
They really need a trading system overhaul.
---
it deserves a name. not the fallout name, but a name.
---
This is not a thing unless you're dumb and fast travel with a weapon out. It's actually the opposite problem now where if I die around a train station, I can use my spawn immunity to my advantage.
---
Dirty camper
---
Has BGS released the actual mechanics of the legendary trader yet? Im thinking it would work something like Borderlands where you pile in your junk and it splits out new stuff that is probably also junk but has a chance of being much better.
---
They work just fine? You clearly don’t own a TSE or you’re delusional. I could whip out my balls &amp; do more damage than a TSE Handmade will do. Even a TSE pump with all shotgun perks (which I have) does absolute dog shit damage compared to my combat knife.. MY COMBAT KNIFE
---
Oh shit nice one
---
Sometimes it's fun to be homeless.
---
Named my 3 star ski sword 'OwO' because the effects are '+30% to scorched enemies' '+1 luck' and '+30% swing speed' mixing the effects with martial artist makes the sword a nightmare.
---
So far most I've met so far are nice.  The ones that aren't are certainly in the minority.
---
Most of my stash is junk
---
The luck tree has luck of draw and intelligence tree has weapon artisan
---
Just keep searching Fort Defiance unfortunately.
---
Trust me—they need caps sinks.  Things I paid 3k caps for 6 weeks ago now sell for 20k.   I suppose I don’t really care about game economics that much.  But for those that do, that tax should just be a start.
---
The mic thing on xbox is kinda ambigus since even if the people are using them you might not be able to ear them. It all depends on their and tour configuration.  Some people use the game voice chat for area, others for group only. Some use console party chat  with their friends.  I only use a mic when doing events or bartering since I had the misfortune of farming WS while having a teen nearby having verbal diarrhea
---
They’d probably be happy to give you your money back.
---
  Oh, and for events that are known to drop legendaries - for example, the fasnacht parade - the sloth dropped a random legendary for each player that scored hits - check the closest vendor after the event ends.  Lots of higher levels sell off their reward item - and you can get them at a good price.
---
I guess its also about perspective. I've been using my TSE Gauss rifle with a TS Handmade on my stealth sniper forever with no real problems in PvE. The nurf was for sure harsh, the damage drop off I got was massive considering how sneak attack works, but I didn't find my character was made useless.    
---
I do think its hyperbole though to say your build is useless because a legendary got nurfed. Yes, legendary items are the endgame content, but just because you're not doing as much as before doesn't mean you're not viable. The idea isn't that all builds are exactly as powerful as eachother, just that the difference in power isn't too great between them.
---
It would be better if they would focus on fixing bugs instead of adding more content.
---
Posted a similar thread about this recently. I’m hoping the vending allows us additional caps by putting say 25k to character and 25k to shop - total 50k. Then we add items to shop up to what we think worth up to 25k. Then buyers can buy and not overrun the characters caps limit.  I can dream!!
---
Hmmm.. Level 265 here, and in all honesty.. I'm kind of at a loss for words. Unfortunately, it seems the first team you've joined where a bunch of dicks.. and I get the feeling they might of been hoping to use  you as a lure. Meaning, they get people to attack the lower guy.. *you* in this instance.. I'm afraid, and hoping you swing back/retaliate at the attacking player hoping that you initiate combat and thus they can jump in and kill the unsuspecting person. **Or...** They could just be **DICKS** looking for people to kill.  
---
With the second person, he seemed like a geniune person looking out for you by giving the stims and such. With the fact you were earning some caps from this person, simply meant he was doing some activities that shared caps with you. Bounties are shared with those that are in a team, as are some quest rewards caps and Xp can be shared with others in the group it seems.  
---
My best advice for you is, find yourself an activity party to run around with, as being in groups can be very beneficial for all. As you can share perk cards amongst your team mates. Must remember for each perk card level you will need 3 levels in *Charisma,* i.e Level 3 Inspiration perk card, will require you to have Level 9 in your Charisma S.P.E.C.I.A.L Stat.   
---
Hope this helps clear up any confusion, or I could have just been waffling on about non sense.. Who knows. Take care out there in the Appalachian wastes friend.
---
Specifically, third level.
---
oof that's gonna be hard because I'm over weight outside a train station waiting for the machine to drop so I can drop over 300 pounds of legendaries into it
---
Now I like that idea. Thanks.
---
Yes, this 110% how it works in all PvP situations. I was testing heavy weapon damage/messing around when I found out. My buddy was spraying me with a gattling plasma and when he stopped, I told him I had X amount of HP. It was at this time he said "really"? "Because on my screen it looked like I had killed you three or four times"."But your Health just kept bumping up". This is when we learned about the mechanics behind the health bar.
---
Yes, and piling on to fixing Bulking, why no Asbestos bulk?
---
found 2 3-star Scorched Wedigos together near the ash heap...received only a scalpel from one and a plasma mine from the other. I even waited for a couple minutes to see if anything would spawn and the only thing that did were 3 lvl 80 scorched beasts. Immediately logged off.
---
Yeah that's a good point.  I don't play many MP games, actually very rarely so I guess I'm new to that aspect too.
---
I think I also read that if you are in a team, the game will only output voice chat to your teammates and also disables area voice chat.  It was an old post so I'm not sure if that still applies today.
---
Does the game have any sort of text-based chat?  I have a keyboard, but it seems the only way I can send text messages to people is via actual xbox live (the social tab seems to just interface with live when a message is sent, for example).
---
NOO NOT MY P2W ARMOR!!!1! BUGTHESDA AT IT AGAIN WHAT AN AWFUL GAME
---
I'm not sure to be honest, my perks are set for ballistic weapons so I haven't used them too much. I will say I like them for basic PvE stuff. Even without perks it works well enough, and the nice thing is fusion cells are everywhere.
---
Never take CHEMS from strangers...unless they shot at you and are now dead. Then,  grift Away
---
I was having your problem before someone on the sub showed me a solution. If you are high level, and preferably have a clown suit, go to Abbie’s Bunker in the North East part of the map. Follow the road south until you get to a truck that is getting picked up by a tree/vines. (I know that sounds weird, but trust me, you’ll know it when you see it.) There is always a Wendigo there, and if there’s not, hop servers. Put on the clown suit and hat, and you get screws, caps, and xp, along with fiberglass or fiber optics, but I don’t remember it exactly.
---
Ok thanks guys, I found the hats but not the outfits themselves I thought there was maybe more to it than that.
---
Input appreciated
---
Do you know how regular these sorts of events occur and where?
---
Awesome. thanks guys. was afraid I had wasted ATOMs on them somehow...
---
Knowing they can drop from SBQ, helps.
---
Also helps to know there is possibly weight other than gunpowder in the misc section.
---
Believe it or not we’re in agreement - a 10% transaction tax will do nothing to arrest inflation like that.
---
Why Tuesday? Is that when the new legendary vendor is out or something
---
I think this might be the pot calling the kettle black. I have a TSE gauss rifle that works amazing, its a gauss rifle that has a ton of aoe (compared to vanilla) with a serious boost to damage. Also, I can solo nuke silos with my 1\* two shot Handmade no issues, same with the new dungeon. Ghouls are a one shot kill if I get a headshot, maybe 5 if its all torso no sneak with the handmade.
---
Obviously my evidence is somewhat anecdotal, however its not like these weapons with ought legendary effects aren't also useful with the right builds, but I have a feeling you think differently.
---
Are you sure you're using them correctly? The end with the hole should be pointed at the enemies.
---
You know, I think you figured it out about the guys using me as a lure.  I didn't attack back, and after that encounter I actually enabled pacify mode (I stumbled on it in the menu) so the guys just ended up wasting their own time, and mine with it.  I am not a PVP guy; this is not what I'm after when I play games.
---
What's an activity party?  Is it something special I can seek out?  Or do you mean, just a group of same-ish level guys adventuring together?
---
I am trying to step outside my usual "solo" mentality and have fun with random folks, and I'm using this game (along with Warframe) as my conduit lol.
---
The TSE conundrum could have been handled with more finesse for sure however the people that really got shafted by the 'fix' are the ones that hoped to develop as explosive weapon 'experts'.
---
You will be hard pressed to find someone that honestly thinks it was 'uncalled for' for the rest.
---
I know it was frustrating at the time because I was one of the ones that found it frustrating, but it needed to be done because even in PvE it was a source of grief.
---
And things have to be pretty bad to be grievous in PvE because pretty much 'you make your own fun' and still were intruding in that fun.
---
I clearly remember the feeling of 'here we go again' when the inevitable arsehole du jour turned up with his TSE shottie at the WS golf club.
---
One that is more situational than anything but very useful is the medic pump, it’s great for SBQ events and the Encryptid event as every time your health goes below 50% you are hit with a stimpack with no cool down period, you can still die if the imposter Sheepsquatch slaps you so your not immortal but it makes it much easier to keep the pylons on as long as you’ve got plenty of stims in your inventory. If you have marsupial you can jump on the shed roof after taking all the pylons with ease without the need for a jet pack and then after the event just switch to a 2nd torso with a jet pack or whatever your preference for regular adventuring which helps to conserve stims. I’d also say the Bright Headlamp is a must but I haven’t seen a plan for that so it might just come as a mod I’m not sure.
---
Iirc in ITV, they said the vendor would have their own currency gotten by trading in legendaries. You can then buy premade stuff with the currency. Don’t quote me on that though, because I’m not sure.
---
Hey there! Have you [filed a ticket](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10) for this yet?
---
But didn't you hear? No NPC's, so there's obviously no story. 
---
/s
---
There are more NPC's than you can count, most of them just happen to be dead. But all the one's that are alive have quite the charm to them. Grafton Mayor, Rose, Grahm... Hell, even the cornel Gutsy's give me a kick everytime I hear about how I need my ass kicked!
---
I had to server hop a the landmark locations for a few hours before I finally picked up the broken camera off the tourist to repair.  I'd imagine with so many unsuccessful attempts to find one, it will take a while to get a new one.

Tuesday is player vending. I expect there's a fair number of players who will list useful 1\* legendaries. 
---
The legendary vendor won't appear until May 16th (per Bethesda e-mail) or May 23rd (per the original roadmap).
---
It's not about what I want, bethesda has said outright they watch and intend to "nurf" things they deem are too powerfull / are winning too often, and spoilers: All the tops of the survival leaderboards are people with these sets. You're the one who's threatening to leave if they make your favorite toy slightly less overpowered.
---
In front of the red rocket truck stop.
---
motion assist servos on the torso for +2 strength.  Plans are cheap, and the mat requirement isn't too bad, either.
---
Ah right explains a lot
---
You're right! Sweet
---
Had a similar situation early on in the game's release.  I was maybe a level 30 and some wise ass level 15 starts melee-ing me.  Being the passive mode sort of guy I am in this game, I just shrugged it off.  
---
At some point I just grew tired of his hits (went on a good 10 mins) and I took off passive mode and decided to end his misery.  2-3 hits of the All-Rise and he was done.  Of course he apparently had a buddy who was with him that only saw me take him out.  So after a few seconds he starts to go after me not realizing all that led up to things and he suffered the fate as his buddy.
---
Needless to say their brown bags were mine as a consolation prize here, but as you can understand I didn't feel bad.  Got a few key items of springs and screws I could use and did without giving it a second thought.
---
I really have to wonder what some players are up to in the game when stuff like this happens that they are surprised when they get slammed.  Needless to say I saw them respawn nearby and both went to the NE of me rather quickly and logged out shortly thereafter.
---
Watch it get delayed again
---
Hi 70! Thank you for reporting this, we'll take a look.
---
I run a melee build and can take the robots (crowd) down on one hit. But the imposter is hard as he just pounds you. Its hard for me to tag the imposter or find the corpse at the end. So I usually focus on the bots and don't get the reward.
---
maybe they are busy deleting trading posts?
---
As an owner of a near full set of Assassin/Sentinal I can say it is pretty OP. Especially those with the Chameleon affix unlike myself, that can single handedly make the whole set 10x better

The railway rifle can be made ridiculously long with a "silencer" x)

Where can you actually purchase fusion cores?

Yes exactly.  I've used two of the ones that dropped from the queen. 150 percent repair as you say
---
Huh... Never noticed it before
---
Apparently some of them are quitting, and most of them aren't on Reddit a lot.
---
I bought the lets play PA for my Ultracite power armor... doesn't work with Ultracite. Says in the description which ones it works for. Derp

Can I take skills of certain skill sets?

Your sure it's not your intelligence that's taking a hit? \[Intelligence\] 1 - It's like it's trying to communicate using the English language, I just know it.

Lol, if it’s any consolation, I accidentally bought that loin cloth outfit in the atom store for goddamn 700 atoms! It was a “controller sliding off my leg, reflex grab it” purchase.

I wish the store asked to confirm purchase...
---
So you want to make it legit to buy items for real money. Like in Elder Scrolls.
---
And of the soups still do. Corn soup, pumpkin soup, etc.

Huh, shows that I still have it equipped, thought that meant it was on. Was that like that in FO4?
---
Start an alt. I carry a spare on my mule.
---
why is this getting downvoted? it's the players responsibility to abuse the system so the developers adjust it
---
...*what*
---
Also saying "How many of them do you own?" show's your bias. Its obvious you use these sets to get a competitive advantage against others, and feel threatened when that is at steak.
---
Me, too! I hoard too much for PvP...
---
I wonder if this bug affects everyone?  Using the [weapon calculator](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html), I'm right at where my shotgun should be post nerf.  The calculator says I should have 390.9 damage and I have 400ish.  If the Explosives legendary effect wasn't nerfed from the bug, then I should be close to 769.96 damage according to the calculator.
---
I know Bethesda said there was an additional bug that displays the shotguns damage lower than it actually is, but I tested this on several enemies whos HP numbers I could find like the Whitesprings Sentry bot.  Shooting them head on at a short distance took 3 shots.  They have 1075 HP from what I could find. That should indicate I'm doing around 400 damage.  Their HP bar also reflected around 400 damage each hit.
---
If it is a nerf even further I might just have to switch my gun and perks.  I have a 2 star TSE Double Barrel Shotgun with 9/9 shotgun perks and 5/5 demolition.  Look at the calculator and test it out if you want.  I'd be curious to see if there's any difference tomorrow to your damage.
---
Can't remember where it was, but there was a holo of a Doctor who got stuck inside a storage locker or something and records her inevitable starvation.
---
he ate his already, now he's a bit grumpy.
---
On their website it says (paraphrasing) Mods are time asking as they are not causing exploits but if they break your game, that's on you. 
---
[here](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44429) Is what they say on it, no mention of bans.
---
Yeah it sucks. I need to recraft myself.
---
Thank you. I was worried that my 3 lvl 50 PA would have to be scrapped to make room in my stash. Now that extra chassis will actually come in handy. Idk why I didnt think to rename the chassis too. That will solve a lot of mixups with my currently usable power armor.
---
[IrwinJFinster](https://www.reddit.com/user/IrwinJFinster) is forsure one of those guys. He's always in these threads defending the op armor he's payed for. Very strange IMO.
---
This^^
---
&gt; What if I don't use vats?
---
If you aim at the head, you hit the head. VATS or not.
---
Reported...
---
It's a little bit of two things - when you last looted it, and the last time someone else did it.
---
One time I went there and deliberately left some of the bowls on the shelf.  The next day, on a different server, it was exactly those bowls that were still there.  But, if another player ransacked the location before you do, there will be nothing.
---
How dafuq were you getting 4k per shot? O\_o
---
The same thing happened to me the other day, i saw that someone was wanted on the map and when i killed them i looked into their bag of dropped loot only to discover that they were carrying 360 aluminum and 50+ ballistic fiber and other junk. Needless to say they weren't happy. They followed me around for quite a while before leaving the server.
---
Considering you can get a TSE handmade literally anywhere it's not a bad deal.
---
Yeah, I meant active.. Not activity. Aha, that was my bad.   
---
Yes, an active group of player around your level or even high levels who play with you on a daily basis makes the game 10x better in my opinion, I am a partial solo player, but I do have a small group of players that I team up with from time to time, and I find it fun.  
---
Being in a group can be rewarding, if you're in a group with a player that can share the perk card "Inspiration" you can benefit from bonus xp from that as well as having fun with like minded players enjoying the Fallout experience of Appalachia. :)
---
If your on Xbox you can go to the lfg for the game and Access Trades / groups / events
---
That doesn't get through sentinels/assasins the way a vats crit does.
---
Ya don’t know what you’re saying and/or didn’t read my post. Unyielding is a massive boost for VATS builds, as well as stealth builds.
---
don't say that my stashbox has been weeping for 2 months now!
---
There's MUCh bigger issues with the Social Menu than this. I mean.. joining a team isn't that hard and can be accomplished before you even load in.
---
I want a fix to the bug where a friend I'm currently playing with shows up in the Social Menu as at the Main Menu.
---
That would be nice... But I believe that is a dream :)
---
Pretty sure pacifist camps is tomorrow
---
Is that without any buffs, at 20% health? Pip-boy damage should be a little higher than 50cal, but missing out on 45% armor penetration is a big deal, plus several enemies have more energy resistance than physical resistance, which puts energy’s in an even worse place.
---
found the 12 year old, noone else uses "cringe" like that
---
and if you ARE older than 12, please stop using the word "cringe" like that. you are not 12.
---
Really?  I haven't found this but it sounds great.  I had a look at the social tab and don't recall seeing this but I'll have another gander tonight.
---
I am always puzzled by the amount of hate this game still get on every Official fallout 76 tweets, but the trend startsto change side, somehow.   
---
It's time for Bethesda to get some credits for the tremendous job and passion they put on their world.
---
(also I have high hope for the patch 9, tomorrow, at first glance there are a lot of things there)
---
Great job!! I'm also addicted to achievements. I made it a point to get [every single one](https://imgur.com/gallery/wYr4uFZ) in all our xbox-released Fallout games! Once you get started it's a crazy addiction.
---
Ah that's good news, I had been avoiding them out of fear of getting banned. Thanks for letting me know!
---
Glad I could help!
---
The amount of great stuff I had to scrap/sell prior to this make me sad.....

Yeah Really Excited for tomorrow to check out people's C.A.M.P.S and do a little buying and sell off all the damn plans and other odds and ends i been hoarding.  i have damn near close to 200 pounds in goddamn extra plans.
---
It just works
---
I know it's a dumb question but...what is the pew?
---
When I had asked about where to farm ballistic fiber, lots of people chimed in saying to go to Defiance, pick up straight jackets, and the ammo bags/military duct tape.
---
After that, you head to WS to sell the straight jackets and buy the bulk ballistic fiber. It works for me
---
#MAX HASS
---
With 10% tax on vending I'm only selling ammo serums mats chems and plans. No one in their right mind will be selling high end weapons or armor with the tax. Will have to go through the person for that.
---
Bad guess
---
That, friend, is amazing! Now I am going to have to go through my plans and dig out all the "useless" ones and see what I can make with them! You're an inspiration to us all. :)
---
Guess it's revenge for nuking America?
---
Yes I’ve done tests on several types of creatures including mirelurk queen, king and sentry bots, the damage is where it should be post nerf, there’s no ‘bug’ needs to be fixed. Now they simply want to give it another 80% reduction and using bug fix as excuse.
---
I bought the game 1-2 month ago and that challenges bugged to me too. It is not connected to beta characters.
---
Ok so I’ll just move a point from endurance and a few from intelligence into charisma and I should be good?
---
Don’t forget to equp bloody mess with it
---
New questline also.
---
As a melee player (except for SBQ fight) I have been seeing this for months.  It's always been a once in awhile kind of thing for me and usually goes away fairly quickly.  I either have been noticing it happening more and more here recently because it is occurring with more regularity, or I am just noticing it because more and more players are voicing off about it here.  I'm not a bloodied build, so I rarely have had it cause me any issues other than mild agitation.  Irregardless, I hope the devs. are at least aware of it.
---
Do you mean Bloodied explosive or Two Shot Explosive? If it is the desired costume AND the player doesn't assign any worth to a Bloodied weapon he could easily see that as a beneficial trade. I had a kind soul trade me a Berserker Explosive reduced weight gauss for 500 caps, because he assigned no value to Berserker and wanted it to go to a good home.
---
My guess guy was tired of farming Encryptid, had an item he didn't care about and saw a chance to stop farming an event that was no fun for them anymore.
---
Ugh fine I'll take my anger out on the scorched ugh
---
Can’t see how they solve the overrun of caps otherwise on the character in a good way. It may all just be a little clunky probably when we get it your right
---
Oh man, Whitesprings is such a meat grinder all of the time.
---
The resort itself isn't too bad, because no one can make it there since everyone gets ganked at the station.
---
I only runn with 3 star combat armor lvl 50 im not to keen on any nerf but atleast its gona be on a legendary i dont use
---
I'm tired of carrying junk
---
So I take em all out of my stash
---
And only place about 150 of each
---
and only allow more than 200 to uncommon/high demand ones
---
The rest stays in my char inventory forever because I go around looking for players to give them to.
---
Then my friends log in and I have no time to go looking for people to give junk to.
---
So I end up carrying everything on me for months.
---
I made a huge effort on Springs and screws, i ended up with almost 600 of each. I had to drop it to 200 each so i went around dropping them in random places
---
How do you know this without going in there?
---
This. 100% this. Sorry for the downvotes.  TSE sentinel is very counterable in a number of ways. Rad damage, critcals, pulse mines,  just to name some of the counters.
---
I have wondered this myself it would make since
---
Kind of dumb, at least I can drop all these hoarded legos
---
\+1 ;)
---
Yeah, that tax is just absurd.
---
The collision barrier needs to be altered on walls so that objects and decorations can be set flush against them, otherwise it looks superficially placed and ruins the aesthetic.
---
We don't typically pin the inside the vaults, because as a rule, we don't pin users' posts, and you guys are the first to post it.
---
I have adrenalal reaction and that's about it. Gotta check how much dmg it has when using nerd rage. Yeah it doesn't have armor Penetration but it shoots crazy fast
---
I've just made a post asking if we can get a final "no we won't ban you for QoL/UI mods" but QI mods have always been apart of both the fallout universe and MMO games so I wouldn't worry.
---
I made a post about how good a classic gauss skin would be
---
I just keep saying over and over... It'll be interesting. :)
---
There have been a few posts about this bug. It also affects ranged weapons, but to a less noticeable degree. If there is an obstacle or item that is being affected by the games physics, then your hit will not connect, but make the sound of contact(melee) and your projectiles will not go where your crosshair is(ranged). Ive seen it tested with regular and explosive projectiles with turrets, waste bins, cans(inconclusive), and a few other tests Ive done myself with melee weapons. 
---
It’s a weird bug, but once you know to avoid standing too close the hip level objects or moveable ones while meleeing or firing you weapon, it’s manageable.
---
I have a TSE combat shottie that I use - or used to use, the jury is out on the matter of what will happen after tomorrow - in my 'in your face' VATS crit shotgunner when I needed to 'clear the room'.
---
Then I switched to the AAE if there were still mobs standing that they needed reminding that they should be resting in pieces.
---
Sure, I cannot one shot an entire corridor full of bloated glowing ones like people used to pre-nerf but I don't think shotguns were ever conceived to do that.
---
TSE handmades used to rip the SBQ to shreds too, again not quite the intended outcome?
---
Sure, fully buffed I can do absolutely ludicrous damage with my bloodied melee build, but I still need to walk up to every single mob in the room one by one, and in 99.9% of the cases I do a 1000% more damage than I need to to one-shot it, which is to say that it only matters against the SBQ, Impostor and Sheepsquatch, but with the much more contained numbers in my shotties I still clear *the entire room* in 5 seconds flat, which is what I do most of the time funny that, clear trash.
---
So let's not be disingenous here, the TSE nerf was brutal and ham-fisted and had far reaching consequences for many people for whom it should not have had but was needed and it did not render all TSE weapons obsolete.
---
It just made room for other weapons so it wasn't TSE or highway because the only contest was bloodied, and that playstyle comes with a long list of caveats that the TSE weapons do not have.
---
From the many changes I don't particularly agree with and I fully intend to re-change once private servers are *a thing* this is one that I will leave for last and if anything probably just tweak the spread.
---
Pacifist camp comes with players vending, don't worry :)
---
Ahh, so you have none.  You’re like the guy puttering a along in a Fiat 500 lamenting “they should do something about those big-engined cars!”
---
Unfortunately, the way that the achievement tracking works on consoles, it will record the progress you made during BETA but will not trigger those specific achievements until you've made a second character and left the vault. I'm not entirely sure that's something we can specifically fix since that's a platform mechanic.
---
Craft alcohol i would guess

The hanging wall cabinet had been broken since launch. It clips to the floor or ceiling; nothing in between.

They are only elusive because you have teams of players who use mules with their only job is to keep sever jumping a particular area for hours, swap their gear to their main characters and throw the stuff on ebay or the market. They effectively remove high level items out of the pool from that server and hop to the next. RNG a legendary anything useful is probably close to 5%.  My level is in the hundreds...never saw an explosive weapon drop, sentinel or cavalier armor drop, power armor plan/mods drop. Never received anything of note from technical documents drops, treasure maps (Waited until level 100 to use the treasure maps) or even looting Behemoths and mega sloths. I have loved fallout forever and will still play...but the assumed balance and "RNG" certainly is neither balanced nor random.
---
It just got spooked by something, so now I'm standing over the corpse.
---
I like it. It keeps pricing down. Just don't sell anything for a ton of caps and it won't be much of a hit.
---
hi, im on PS4, id FritoZ, id like to check out your selection tonight after work if that is ok!  i am looking for my first actual good end game gun, all my grinding has yet to reward me with anything epic.  I have some caps saved up and ready to spend em!
---
Can also use those to store your excess fusion cores :)
---
As a community we help eachother, show eachother how to do things and where to go. That's what I like about the fallout community, we see the good in the world and we help each other out. If you need anything or have a question then ask the community, I'm sure one of us will have an answer. Good luck in the wastes
---
Is this something the mod team could post as an update in the future?
---
If they are wearing chameleon and crouching their sentinel effect is gone and stealth boys aren't very common. Can always use a berry mentats
---
You get caps when a teammate finishes a quest. You also get caps when a teammate kills another player. At higher level, many people use a mutation called "Herd Mentality" where if you are in a group you get a +2 to all SPECIALSand if you are solo you get a -1 to all SPECIAL. 
---
I try to give crafted items and healing items to those lower level, and I will often ask if they want some assistance.
---
That's what I'm Apprehensive about. lol
---
Is that a skill and can I take skills off certain skill sets to reuse them somewhere else
---
Yes agree. Not long now wastelanders!!!
---
In 350 hours of gameplay I've only found a flatwoods monster twice! How could you find it in one week?
---
Yes Perk Loadout Manager BUT it's clunky in it's current form, you have to manually import your builds from a third-party site. Beth def needs to implement this in-game.
---
MG42 is really fun to shoot, damage is comparable to 50 cal but way more accurate. Prime it so the ammo yield will be much better (uses fluorescent flux which is really easy to get in WS).
---
I don't agree. Aside from the +25k cap items... People will just build in the 10% they want for an item. I think this affects the buyer more than the seller.
---
You have to find the tourist at one of the random spawn points, this should help you:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bgkq7y/tourist_location_masterpost/
---
We're looking into setting something up to where it'll auto-pin things like that in the future. It's taking time, but we hope you'll bear with us.
---
The questions your asking are very good. As with everything, my expectations are extremely low.
---
I don't think you can have a TS and bloodied on the same gun since it fills the same star. The TSE hand made while still a great gun is the most duped weapon but still commands a good price but some dupers have excess of that gun. A if you got a bloodied explosive then that's harder to get.
---
It’s a random spawn at a few locations throughout the world. I would recommend you to watch Rifle Gaming’s video on where you can find it. It’s how I got mine https://youtu.be/VhaH9dIGtAQ
---
I think you answered your own question. In legal speak they are saying that if you use mods it could break your game but it's your decision they are not saying it's bannable just that you are taking a risk of breaking your game. I'll say probably more pc players use the mods your refering to and experience little to no issues.
---
Would also be nice to have a 'bulk all' option
---
I've been buying all the cheap 2 -3 star items sold after queen event from watoga vendor in anticipation of script
---
Or Just sell it on the market and get no tax and max value. You would be foolish to stick any weapons or armor in them.
---
You have to find the body of a tourist to start the quest. If you want to know the possible locations, there's another thread that links to them, here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bgln59/tourist\_and\_camera\_all\_possible\_spawn\_locations/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bgln59/tourist_and_camera_all_possible_spawn_locations/) 
---
Please keep in mind that it can be a very frustrating search involving server hopping, and the camera quest itself isn't all that exciting. Keep expectations low.
---
I agree and it aggravates me when I try to place something down.
---
Object must be in terrain
---
Part of the structure will not be accessable
---
Outside of CAMP
---
Interferes with another object
---
Within radius of another object
---
Object cannot be in water
---
I don't even see the object I use doing anything wrong. 🤔😒
---
On top of that the floors have an invisible ramp that allows anything to walk up it in mid air. Or when a foundation is placed down and you stand next to it below the floor leve, you can't be close to it as if it's a wall. They need to fix this.
---
Or factor 10% loss into price so 20k item sell for 22k
---
We have a long way to go before we get anything close to balance OP. I know Bethesda said they are looking at the top builds but the truth is they need to be far more agile and active than they have if we are going to get the kind of balance this game needs.
---
Yea, there is not much penalty to knocking a few points out of intelligence with the way legendary stuff works. Maybe a few of those points to luck? 
---
I always feel like I need like 5 more points than we get anyway.
---
At some point you will also be rearranging cards. I drop first aid, sturdy back, bear arms, bandolier, thru hiker, and batteries included as well as the sneak and lock pick cards when I get to a big fight and add stabilized and tank killer and the damage cards. Same at camp with contractor, happy camper home defence etc.
---
Dirge.
---
I do this and I don't feel bad, put your junk away before you go somewhere you'll probably die, and don't expect people to play the most unfair section of the game just because you don't like that they take advantage of your idiotic decisions
---
I've got a couple of pieces, but I'm trying to trade them for some specific weapons I want.   
---
&gt; Ahh, so you have none. You’re like the guy puttering a along in a Fiat 500 lamenting “they should do something about those big-engined cars!” 
---
The fact you think somone who doesn't have these sets should be unable to compeate with people who have them shows that you obviously don't understand competative pvp in an RPG.   
---
Either you payed real money for your gear and want to quit if the nurf it because you feel like you've lost an investment, or you're to shit at video games so you're scared with-ought your competitive advantage you'll constantly lose to those "Fiat 500s". It's one or the other, take your pick.
---
u/zirfeld described it very well! There is a lot of licensing talk that happens to get songs into the game. While I'm not sure if there are any current plans to add more in, it is a pretty complicated matter that would take time to implement due to that licensing.

I haven't gotten the plans for that yet. I can't wait to get them. But that issue needs to be resolved.
---
You said that a lot of people know about it, and clearly not all of them are cheaters, so why haven't the devs talked about it then?
---
Sometimes I put away the essentials and go to survival just to clear it out
---
Things are so ridiculously OP in this game that they absolutely need to be nerfed. It cannot be avoided.
---
It gets posted just about every single day. Don't worry too much about it.
---
Always wanted to put them into my garage/shop. Very cool looking
---
I found a Furious Swing Speed Mr. Handy Buzzblade, it super shreds!
---
Funny story, that’s my name as well lmao. From one Todd on to the next
---
Sad but true. Hopefully now that survival has started they'll at least be working with a good data-set to make these decisions, not just the opinions of us reddit folk.
---
Why does there have to be a goal? I don't see a problem with starting conversations with multiple people. How does that bother you?
---
You can always juggle around your perks to fit what you intend to do.  It’s awkward and time consuming but possible.  You may need to compromise sometimes.
---
Don't forget about all the NPCs in Wastelad and Grognak and the Ruby Ruins!
---
Yeah, that's what I figure most will do. Not impacting the market or economy at all.
---
I do the Bloodied melee as well. I use the Bloodied Axe &amp; SS which give me just shy of 1200 damage per hit. I have 5 unyielding pieces, which I added pockets too for more carry weight. I use Nerd Rage, Bloody Mess, Slugger, Radicool, and some other perks. I also have Adrenal Reaction, Twisted Muscles, Marsupial, Bird Bones, Healing Factor, and Herd Mentality mutations. When I’m just farming I use Slugger and a few others without the Bloody build and my PA.  I’m still dealing almost 400 damage. Again, I use an Axw with faster swing speed and the All Rise.
---
For me, it's the first body you come across right after you leave the vault on your way to Flatwoods. I think her name is Willie Mae - on the porch? Her Survivor Story tape says she was glad her grandchildren made it to the vault. So I like to think that maybe she's my character's grandmother. But if that was the case I'd give her a decent burial. :(
---
Echos of old nerfs in this thread for sure, similar reactions to the TSE nerf. Ppl coordinate on discord to manipulate  the conversation here. I will say that you have to opt in to PvP, a full set of armor isnt the same menace to other players as the TSE stuff was. I completely avoid PvP because it's not fun, so kids spending 20$ on armor is whatever for me... Embarrassing as fuck, but not impacting me.
---
The others have covered most of your questions, but I just want to add that while you're in a team with someone, you can fast travel to them for free. This is also why people might send you random team requests as it's a cheap way to get to the other side of the map. I'm level 186 and mostly I just spend the caps (the travel agent perk helps) but if you're low in caps and need to get from abbies bunker to Welch, well...
---
ITV does say that (and that's my assumption, though there are still variables that could make 'buying' most interesting).  
---
&gt;The more Legendary Scrip you have when the Purveyor arrives, the more legendary weapons and armor you will be able to buy!
---
Todd, however, made contradictory statements, or at least statements that possibly, seemingly point to a different assumption, maybe kinda.
---
Honestly, I'll believe the ITV (which I'll assume was vetted by at least a few people), over what Todd said (which was vetted by 0 people, including himself).
---
Or put it up in the market and possibly have it bid up to 30k. No reason to sell weapons or armor in there. Just sell it through personal trading.
---
Good to know, this is what i have know. Might help a little. There is still some melee stuff here.

FWIW, I've used it on and off (every patch seems to break it, so there have been time when it wasn't available) since it was released, I dual box (2 accounts) and have crafted 150K ultracite ammo in under a month's time. No bans so far.
---
very close to the ash heap,and that whole area rumbles and shakes at random intervals.did it yesterday while at the vendor. if I remember correctly,goes all the way back to the nukola plant.
---
There’s still people with hundreds of tse handmades he could be one of those people and it was a great deal for him, You never know
---
There are no other 'Broken' ProSnap Deluxe cameras in game apart from the one you get when  you start the quest. Anyone who says other wise is wrong - sadly :(
---
Screw's are scares rather give then fertilizer.
---
When you get high level you look for more things to do other than grinding events. Some people help. Some grief. Some do random shit. I've done all the above. Lol. Well, I dont grief I go sniff out and instigate pvp at workshops. I dont troll and destroy camps.  Unless your camp sucks then I shoot it a few times to let you know you have no creativity. 😂😂
---
And the headset thing, I've found most are in a party with their friends already. Either playing fallout or different games. I go around dropping stuff but in a party and I dont want to switch to game chat.  Just drop and emote and shoot gun to get attention. 
---
I've also invited people to a team just to use them as a free fast travel.
---
Hmm... I've been able to amass quite a large collection of junk 2-3 stars without having to buy them or even farming them. I'd be interested to hear approximately how many you have with the trouble you've gone through.
---
I think +60% is fine, out of the context of weapon viability Demo Expert is better than other damage perks since it only costs 5 points as opposed to 9. The real issue imo is that the base damage of all explosive weapons is way too low. The fact that a super sledge can deal comparable damage to a fat man, and more damage than a missile launcher, is really stupid. Explosive weapon damage across the board should at least 50%-100% higher.
---
Hate that when it happens.
---
The knife  you said you like power armor and gauntlets don’t work there.   Exterminator- meh.  Who’s worried about bugs.   Executioner- nice extra damage at the end of the kill.   Assassin- better against olayers pvp sure but I would want something faster than a bat.
---
I don't know as I really don't trade around much, but he does and says not many people want to let theirs go during trading, so I got the feeling they were fairly rare.  Thanks for the reply.
---
If only mods were legally allowed to finish their job for them...
---
My best advice is to find the "game trails" in the wild and follow them.  If you come across a beaten path in the middle of the woods and follow it, you will probably trigger a few spawns. Much more likely to find a high level 3\* in the wild than trying to server hop at a specific place.
---
I prefer unarmed. High base damage, lower perk investment than 1H/2H, and faster swing speed than 2H. Power fist or deathclaw gauntlet are my preferred options. Mole miner gauntlet is also good but I don't like how big it is on the screen.

Three hours ago I was ready to flog it.
---
Now I am not only not flogging it but crafting ultracite ammo which I promised to myself I would never ever do again.
---
The thing with asking questions is that sometimes you get answers... :P
---
Either way I will make a small batch of a 1000 rounds or so and take her for a spin later, see how she handles :)
---
This has happen to me like 10+ times. Why do you carry that much junk into a prime fight
---
We are getting the ever upwards pioneer scout questline which includes the utility backpacks, I can’t wait 😁

Sorry, edited my post for the confusion about the gun.  Thanks for the insight, but as the costume pieces drop so regularly for all of us we were just wondering if the community at large was having issues getting it.
---
Ya I don’t have high expectations for missions in this game, I do enjoy the game tho.
---
But can everyone harvest the camera from the body. Like if I find it and my friends join me can they get the camera as well
---
Gotcha, I was confused by the way it was worded.
---
Fashnacht ran more or less on the hour.
---
Vampire weapons restore a portion of your health each time you get a hit on an enemy.  
---
Keep in mind legendaries are not the be-all end-all.  
---
My primary weapon from L20 to about L50 was a vampire machete, 
---
If I was out of PA (not in a nuke zone), I used a non-legendary death tambo.
---
Been using a a non-legendary cultist blade for the last 20 levels, but am now alternating between than and the vampire switchblade.
---
Weapon drops are random; I've gotten all types of weapons as drops.  
---
Sometimes, non legendary enemies will drop legendary weapons.
---
Sometimes you find them in the green or red boxes guarded by other critters.
---
Regularly check vendors.  
---
Bloodied and junkie doesnt suit my build, so I sell any of those I find.
---
50cal and plasma gat have the same fire rate afaik- 91
---
Me too. I wish the issues would be worked on and test even thoroughly by the team. They need to have players at their studio telling them every issue they find with the camp.
---
Wdym by 1H and 2H and I can’t use them as I’m always using power armor
---
Dirge?
---
Marquee arrows are not ammo for crossbow...
---
that's easy for you to say.... 
---
*because I have no clue what you ARE saying hehe*
---
Jeez anyone who says you cannot nerf things has no idea what their talking about. There has to be Yin and Yang when it comes to nerfs and buffs. Its clear there are legendary effects that are OVERPERFORMING and its also clear some are UNDERPERFORMING. 
---
Lets nerf sentinel/cavalier to 10% per piece. Assassin to 5% per piece. Bring those down a notch. While at the same time buff the crap out of Nocturnal or Mutant armor. Just some examples.
---
Same vendor as the X-01 mods in the Enclave bunker
---
I didn't understand at first, apologies, so you mean you pull up the transfer menu when searching bodies to get it to work right?
---
If players dropped 300 screws, I would be one PvP mofo.
---
The voicechat switch to team and leave area if you're set on auto.    the game itself as no message chat but people do send messages via xboxlive by looking the player's profile (I personally hate that since I only get the notification when logging off 3-4 hours later). I know there's rumor of a comming ingame msg chat, but I hope it's only on PC since I have already so much text in my screen and playing console I'm standing to far away from the screen to read anything (even the quests resume.  Wish they would let us change the size of the text).  Once upon a time I used to play WOW on PC and text chat was easy with a hotkey to switch between game and chat but on console that wouldn't be the same.   
---
Maybe Bethesda could add a mic emote so we could signal people we want to speak to them using voice.
---
Fortnite in fallout confirmed?
---
Its a PC mod.
---
Dont purchase Fusion Cores. Go to Thunder MTN or Monagah Power plants or both. Claim the workshops. Install a fusion generator to the Fusion Core Processor. Or do the power up event for the plant. You will get about 3 an hour. Plus the XP for defending the place.
---
Ah yes I couldn’t remember if the pioneer scouts questline came with the backpacks or not
---
The long benches in churches
---
I would totally love these
---
Pacifist should be disabled if u steal another players loot
---
*What will happen if our cap limit is maxed and the items sell?  Will they go out for free or will vending machine say " out of order till cash emptied by owner"*
---
Really? Well maybe i'll try getting a Bloodied 50 cal then. Though the ammo is kind of expensive. Also i already have a TSE one
---
I asked friends and they told me it usually appears on the cliffs at savage divide. So we started to server-hop at the southernmost part of the map near the watchtower (there's a random encounter spawn point on the cliffs overlooking the savage divide) It literally took 5 minutes for three of us to make it spawn.
---
I guess we just don't travel that much during standard gameplay to encounter these cryptids.
---
I need to come visit you! Haha.
---
You aren't the only one. I wish they would push the Survival part more.  I want difficulty.   I want challenge.  I want player interactions to be stressful  and uncertain.  Survival has problems, but just like 4, I can't go back to normal once I've tasted survival. 
---
Lower my carry weight.  Make diseases worse.  Make food scarce.  Up the repair requirements on equipment.  Make enemies deal lots more damage, but also make them less bullet spongy. Keep the pvp elements that contribute to uncertain interactions. Make me work for it! 
---
I want to be challenged:  getting Spawn Camped is not challenge.
---
666 upvotes agree
---
Get it ALL the time. Reinstalling didn't help me either.
---
Same, it's nice but I have so much rad away from WS runs plus the area around me is FULL of fungus so i'll never run out. in fact i'm trying to sell my rad away to free up room.
---
This is usually my experience. Often when you come back, someone is standing on the bag helping you locate it. And, I assume, making it impossible for anyone else to loot.
---
I have lost bags in events, but I have recovered far more than I have lost. One time I come back to find the bag full off plans and a stack of the type of ammo I use (5mm).
---
Where and  how?
---
That's what he gets for screwing around.
---
Tse needed that neft, I just think they wend a little too much with explosins pve
---
Extra note on renaming: if you include the level in the rename you won't have to guess when you're high enough to use it.
---
My normal PA name is:
---
0-PA-{Type}-{Level}-{Missing Parts}
---
Like
---
0-PA-Raid-45-No LA
---
Means: Sort this to the top (0 prefix), it's power armor (as opposed to anything else I want at the top), Raider variant, level 45, missing the left arm. If it only has 1 piece or something, I'll change the missing parts to "Only {piece}"
---
There has been a lot of talk about it and from what I hear if it's a well known mod on the Nexus it should be fine as Bethesda tends to look there as well.
---
Fully agreed
---
How can I find the game trails
---
Bloodied death claw extra claw mod
---
https://i.imgur.com/gRk1uZm.gif
---
That damage number is correct.
---
That is a good Gatling gun, the only problem is it’s low level (level 40) so you might want to try and trade it for a good max leveled version. Lots of “rich” players like to buy good lower level weapons to give to their mules.
---
Also, maybe keep it until the legendary trader comes out. He might give the option to level up your legendary as well, who knows 🤷‍♂️
---
Please tell me how to do this. I want to be at this level of trolling of the trolls.
---
Probably thought the win was in the bag...
---
You're correct that the construction system needs updates to enhance immersion and realism; I said so in my original post. 
---
However, the implication that I've used multiple accounts to downvote your comments is patently untrue: the downvotes represent community input on the fact that your comments included sideways slights in what is supposed to be civil discussion.
---
The game has received a bad reputation for the same reason that exploits exist: Bethesda. You asked for my counter-point and that is the core of it. I didn't create this exploit (yet  unlike dupers who would say the same thing) and don't impact the balance of the game whatsoever by having a float house 5 ft. from the map-edge. Your issue is that Bethesda does not have a construction system like Ark: Survival (and probably others) with structural integrity requirements.  
---
i.e. this same base with no foundations would be no more stable were the foundation and beamed-stairs there in the real world. I look forward to the day when I'm forced to rebuild this house due to improvements in the C.A.M.P. system
---
Todd is like a onion
---
Just found this holotape yesterday! I was some excited. Like I was playing a Gameboy game out in the wasteland! That's exactly what I'd de doing after a nuclear apocolypse. Gotta entertain yourself ya know!
---
I play in PA, I am constantly selling bulk ballistic fiber to the vendors.
---
I think you have a misconception on the store. You don't place items into it Bethesda said. You post them for sale from your stash. So when people buy through your vendor thingy, it goes to them directly from your stash. There's no additional inventory space alloted or anything.
---
This is is just speculation, but I believe it's a balance thing. Like I see what your saying, it would be nice to equip more cards for utility and what not. But lets say they do add this in. Is someone able to buff past 15 special? If so PvP just changed a bunch. Casual and raider shielded linings offer, +7 special points 3 being Agility and 3 being perception and a random one. That means, for example a bloodied Sentinel build just got + survivability and depending on what they choose longer stealth boys. In addition to adding vats hit chance and the ability to equip a long range rifle and be decent with it. I don't want Sentinel and Cav buffed right now. I would rather the game get balanced out before we have significant changes like this.
---
Interesting.  How do you fast travel to team mates?  I tried to do it yesterday to join the guy who had re-invited me after the first time and I couldn't figure it out.  I "moused over" his icon in the map screen and didn't notice any options.
---
I started as someone who enjoyed really trying to break the system but I've found more enjoyment switch up my playstyle to be more rounded. They mentioned it during the linked panel that they intended for most players to be a sort of jack of all trades. Honestly moving towards that has really increased my enjoyment of PVE. Encounters feel more real to the point where if i see 3 lvl 50+ glowing gulpers I'm most likely running away because it would be a bit of a fight and a small ammo sink.
---
Yes. If you find the body, others can join you to get the quest list and broken camera.
---
Reading this makes me happy
---
Cannot place object, item is floating.
---
That's true, it's less impactful than TSE in adventure, but in survival it really takes any catharsis out of the experience when it's pay to win.
---
About 40 3 star and maybe 100 2 stars. I only buy if they are under 250 caps
---
Thank you for the response.
---
Because you can sell it directly without bulking. Wish you could do this with everything as bulking only saves weight for Al and Pb and is a waste of plastic for everything else.
---
The word is simple, but the use case is exceptionally rare. Even if a movie (or a TV show) mentions church stuff, it hardly ever speaks about pews. What context do you mention a pew anyway? Unless the pews themselves are relevant to a plot, I can't see a reason to speak about them.
---
no one makes anyone buy anything.   Relax a little
---
That is the better option for sure
---
Wow.
---
 I edited my post for the "Bloody" confusion on the gun. We talked about that and he only saw 1 in the guys inventory, but that means nothing.
---
History has proven this could be a long conversation.
---
No problem. You have to think that a TSE is the most duped weapon in the game vs an outfit that is somewhat rare and has only had a month to drop. Gun for outfit was fair. The extra stuff he probably didnt need to trade.
---
Explore, dont fast travel. Wander around. The map is full of trails.
---
Im sorry... what? Did you even read my post?
---
Very true. But as we all know the current state of 76 is so unbalanced. From the ecomny to builds like bloodied and unyielding etc. But adding the perks of under armour could be a benefit of reaching level 75 or 100. Rewarding playing who made it that high.
---
what are you guys doing with all this adhesive?  i have like 300 in my stash and another hundred on me because i dont need them and dont really care if i lose them.  i just bulk and sell them.
---
Berserker is much more risky than Bloodied and it's nowhere near in DPS.
---
I just think it's the most sought after. I've seen asylum outfits go for a TSE or 25k caps and you can just server hop for a few hours to get the color you want. Some people just hate server hopping or grinding hard and value the items higher to save them the trouble.
---
A buddy of mine once asked "what kinda gun is a short pew?" 
---
I had no idea what he was talking about till i got to the vendor he was at.
---
Then I never stopped laughing. Some say I'm still laughing to this very day.
---
unfortunately yes.  That's 30 seconds of my life I'll never get back.
---
Same thing happened to me with that set of suits... 800 atom gone forever man...
---
Nono, that would be the long pew pew
---
There is a huge contingent of FO76 players that simply don't want to hassle with personal trading. I use it all the time and even I find it tedious given the high rate of people wasting your time with junk offers, low balling tactics and total no-shows for agreed upon sales. 
---
Lots of people will be selling armor and weapons in player vending. The trader niche is just that, not representative of anything approaching a majority.
---
That's me with most Bethesda games. Do a playthrough where I just break the shit out of the game, but after a point the fun is in the challenge, risk assessment and gambling.
---
I think you need to click on their name, not just mouse over (it's muscle memory at this point, lol, trying to describe it is more difficult than I thought!). Or, open up the social menu and go to the team tab. When you select their name there, some options should pop out that include fast travel.
---
No, I understand how it works. It's EXACTLY like the Punch Bowl. If you haven't already, check it out.
---
I like reactive plates and calibrated shocks as often as possible.  With marsupial I don't need a jetpack and I'll take any advantage to deal out a little more damage. Also the targetting hud for darker areas or nuke zones when they're not glowing.
---
very sticky situation mon ami
---
and run 2 Xboxes. run 2 xboxes. 2 xboxes. 2. Nuff said.
---
The way I interpreted the patch notes, I beleive there wil be no separate weight for vending - item still counts to overall stash weight limit.
---
It needs a tribute at your camp
---
I didn't mean you and your accounts. The "literal trash" person was the first one to start being annoying and then after i blocked them the downvotes poured in and your post didnt go up any.
---
NOT you. It's really hard to get people to read and think.
---
I call it "Crackle Crackle Respawn."
---
 With Fireproof and Dense armor I can walk through a hail of missle turrets and it's barely a scratch.  That poprock shooter gets me every time before I even know what's up.
---
I don't know if assholes seek it out, or if you become an asshole when you get one, but it seems predominantly like an asshole weapon.  I won't even try talking to anyone I see with one.
---
I haven't done anything with punch bowl. So I'm ignorant there. But store is not adding inventory space.
---
Huh...guess I never noticed it before.
---
Does jet pack and marsupial not stack? If so that’s disappointing.
---
Your impressions of the player vending and the legendary vendor after about 3-weeks of it being live will be interesting. Hopefully it was worth it in some aspect at least.
---
With any luck the purveyor will bring item costs down by allowing people to build their own legendaries.  Also works to take a swipe at the duper’s, so a nice two-fer.  All a cap limit boost will do is raise prices, you have to attack the source.
---
could i possibly get one ive messaged you already QXNightmare
---
You know what. Never mind. I see what you're saying. Good day!
---
Google it is lol
---
though it's not Bethesda's responsibility if they paid outside of the game for something in the game
---
The fee is to combat inflation. Making it lower defeats the purpose of having a fee in the first place. 
---
There are a fuckton of posts explaining why the fee is a good thing, go read those.
---
My guesses  
---
1: You don't place anything in the vending machine, you flag it in your stash to appear in the vending machine, and when it sells it sells straight from your stash.   
---
2: The caps above 25k vanish into the ether,  just like now  
---
3: Probably rounded, as with Charisma, berry mentats and Hard Bargain. Anything priced 0-4 caps = no commission, 5-14 caps = 1 cap commission  
---
4: Unlikely I suspect  
---
5: Maybe setting buy orders down the line will be possible, but not for release. It's a huge undertaking as you basically have to be able to call on everything in the game in order to choose what you want to buy. I sell a specific unique TSE Cucumber from my inventory, but if I were to set I buy order, I'd have to allow for every single unique cucumber that has ever dropped, or is ever likely to drop. I can't see it myself. Maybe for junk or chems/food it would work though  
---
6: Worry less about an old bug being fixed, and more about the potential for new bugs. Your main weapon vanishes while you're in the middle of a SBC fight because someone in Whitesprings just bought it for 1c, even though you never put it on sale.  :p
---
The woman in the airport that locked herself in that room broke my heart. 
---
And I didn't know he did find his dog :(
---
Best way of getting it?
---
I believe the Vault 76 suit which is lined does offer some perks.
---
The threads can be read by everyone.  Going into every post and saying the same shit annoys people.  If someone wants to reply to your repeated suggestion that they "sell their Tse for 2k caps and buy a BE" they can reply to you.  Plus, it's stupid advice because no one would sell you a BE anything for caps, and the Tse is probably still worth more than 2k.  So you're just over there chirping the same bad advice to anyone in the entire post.  It just makes it seem like you have some kind of agenda because normal people don't do that
---
There are many words that aren't heard often but are still known.
---
Thanks for the info now if I could figure out how to manage a low health build with out dying alot.
---
Across the water from Harper's Ferry - there's a walkway and if you go all the way up and over the rocks - there's a dead couple and their dog is still there and alive and just staying with them.
---
Just wondering if maybe you mixed it up with Psychobuff or Bufftats?
---
Yup! Skyrim is a great example. 1st playthrough was a wood elf stealth archer that crafted double enchantments on armor to make 2 schools of magic entirely free. 2nd playthrough I was a heavy armored Orc that used sword and shield that needed to go forage for alchemical ingredients to heal. I enjoyed #2 way more.
---
Not anymore. Check the change log.
---
Thanks for the info. I’ve already put the line wanderer in charisma now all I need to do is remove power patcher and put gunsmith at rank 2 then transfer those points to luck and charisma. When the purveyor comes out ( in 2 days I think) I’ll just sell all my légendaires as most of them are heavies then I should just rank up gladiator( I already have gladiator rank 2 and 1 and master gladiator rank3).
---
I read this will be addressed in the patch, so hopefully I can get another one tomorrow. Thank you!
---
From game press the big X button it’s will take you to the drop down menu select fallout and press the little button with the 3 lines ( not sure what to call it) from there go down to Looking for group and browse 👍
---
Good one, I use a note in my phone with missing/under level parts.
---
Funnily, I use the same name type, PA T-60 for example.
---
I am carrying about 800 lead but have even more in stash. Problem is everything is full. Have a bunch of legendary items waiting for the legendary vendor patch so I can sell them. I do make ammo when I get steel.
---
Got him out of a sticky situation
---
It does, but usually I don't have to use it because I can jump it.
---
One trick to initiate pvp is invite some one you want to kill in a group then they attack a friend not in the group which initiates PVP with the group and then that person can now kill you with out you initially starting PVP. It's a dick move.
---
I had a mini war that turned into a server war by the overseers camp. It started with me, a high level and a mid 20 hanging aroung when some bitch starts spamming fatmans. I have max two handed damage snd the all rise so i two shot his lvl 180 xo1 ass back to ws. He comes back with a friend and i die. The other two fight him and slowly everyone starts heading are way and get caught in the middle of a fire fight and say f it and join in. My camp was obliterated and the neighbors camp was sadly caught in the cross fire and lost alot of the base
---
Than they better hope their rng is good because you won't find any good weapons or armor in vending machines. Because the small amount of traders own close to 50% of the high end weapons in the game. They've hoarded them all over multiple characters. To get the high end stuff you essentially have to go through them.
---
I did the same thing at first, maxxed out pack rat because that was what Bethesda recommended. Then I realized that carrying all your junk on you is INCREDIBLY stupid.
---
Kind of don’t understand what you mean by trails pal sorry
---
Way to be the villain in your own story.  Not really sure this was the right thread though to brag about ganking someone and stealing their stuff but grats on your junk.
---
Then you have a misconception of my post. I never alluded to additional stash space. The punch bowl works just like the fermentor, you to add things to your bowl but doesn't remove them from your stash. The difference being that people can drink from your punch bowl, removing said item from your stash once they do. pretty much exactly how the player vending will work, and I imagine this punch bowl was a test for player vending.
---
Nope. Its not. 
---
DR is overrated. I'm using a broken wood armor (so no DR) with all the damage mitigation perks in a bloodied build and can tank for days. 
---
Berserker can do the same with 100% health bar, so more survivability
---
I have two handmade rifles.  One explosive version and one AA auto version.  The explosive does more dmg, but when perked with tank killer the AA can be pretty deadly.
---
Bottom line, get a life.
---
I'd kill Preston Garvey's grandfather.
---
It does but I'm referring to allowing those perks affect your special. In regards to use more cards.
---
I think it's adorable that you spell "nerf" "nurfed."
---
My god I'm old. Have nerf footballs become so old that there are grown ups playing video games that don't know what they are?
---
The Serendipity perk in Luck is your best friend, and you may want to consider running Dodgy in Agility as well
---
How are they going to know what I said unless I reply to them?
---
It's not stupid advice. I was able to get both BE Lever and Handmade for caps.
---
Most TSEs mentioned here on this thread were definitely not worth more than 2k.
---
So, how is it bad advice?
---
Base damage needs increasing and so does durability.
---
My memories of the Missile Launcher are mostly trips to the bench to repair it :P
---
And if you wanna run in with your one shot melee weapon and kill everything before anyone else gets a shot you're just a cool guy?
---
Meaning? I assume from your comment that you believe I'm a duper, but you couldn't be more wrong.
---
  If he had more than one of said weapon, or it didn't suit his build, then why not trade it for something he wanted ?
---
I know what you mean.
---
There are too many restrictions, stripping away most of the creative freedom that would allow players to really experiment and create something unique. 
---
For a game where the CAMP building functionality is a particular focal point, there needs to be a whole new, revamped, less restrictive system where things can be snapped at angles less that 90 degrees, where objects can clip through one another (as long as there are no exploits), and ultimately where players can build things that are less linear and "blocky", and more thematic and makeshift, as would be expected in a post-apocalyptic world where you wouldn't have the luxury of find a perfectly empty, flat piece of land with nothing obstructing your plans.
---
Heh it's an epic dagger from WoW that for no explainable reason's very mention could grind chat channels to a halt.
---
Lolz d$&amp;! you spellcheck!🤬  I meant screws.
---
I had this one guy kinda do the same thing, but instead of a nuke zone, a Behemoth at the Whitesprings murdered him as he was hitting me, He had like, Bulk everything, screws, gears, springs, wood, acid, It was insane, obviously I wasn't gonna pass it up, so I took it and stashed it in the station, I then went to my base and he showed up, destroy two walls then my missiles I had practically everywhere took him out. And then the hate messages started, so I ignored him and went on my merry way making a bunch power armor I was meaning to make for a while.
---
I did have a misconception. I never used punch bowl. Or fermentor, for that matter. So i misunderstood your warning. 
---
But if we can put 10 items up that would be plenty for me. Anything more than that is a bonus.
---
But now im going to raise prices due to tax inflation. Im all for a normal tax or a once a day maintain fee, but a 10% tax on every item is insane to ask for. I do alot of high value sales and im going to keep doing them in person so that way i dont have to pay the tax. 
---
There are better ways to stimulate the economy than to tax the crap out of people. I mean no one is going to pay more than 200 for a serum.
---
Just slap on Weapon Artisan whenever you go to repair it. You start off with your gun at 200% condition.  Then you don't have to worry about running Gunsmith, although if you do this in combination with it you have effectively made your weapon last 4x as long...
---
Let’s be honest , caps are worthless if your trying to get anything valuable ( unless you get lucky) All AAe, Be, Sent/Cav items are primarily trade only,.. so in a nutshell economy is already broken
---
So just a suggestion, there are people playing that would be willing to pay for a subscription to make things like this possible outside of the current cash shop.
---
The Music of Fallout is something that absolutely sets the tone. Given that many of us are going to be playing this game far longer than any other fallout title the music is even more important. There is only so many times you can hear the Beach Boys before you start wanting more music.
---
I personally would love to pay you guys on patreon to pay lesser known bands to make 40/50's style original music that was actually made for the Fallout world that you can use for anything going forward in all your games.
---
There are a ton of rockabilly bands out there that would love to take a crack at music in this universe and it would be far more cost effective compared to licensing old songs from the music industry.
---
Same question for you—do you own any of the items you want reduced in effectiveness?
---
I don't expect that we would get any increase to our current weight limits with the Vending machine, just wondering how much we can post for sale at one time.
---
Farming (possibly Whitesprings) or if your on Xbox join (The Fallout Store) and buy one
---
My 1-shot explosive handmade is my go-to (when I'm not sniping).  It clears stuff easier than my AAE shotty ever did.  TSE would be a cakewalk.
---
Also, melee vs ranged is a shit argument, because of the shit balance (which is at least somewhat justified, but there's still a huge discrepancy in damage output between the two).
---
Protectron robots drop five things: fusion cells, aluminum, lead, steel, and military-grade circuit boards.  This is not scientific, but after farming Watoga for a couple hours yesterday, I found aluminum to be hit-or-miss.  For a while I kept getting aluminum and fusion cells - just what I needed.  Then, for a longer time, I kept getting lead and steel.  The lead was okay for me, but not if you need aluminum.  So anyway, some other people here have made some good recommendations, and maybe those are a stronger pick if you just need aluminum.  Happy hunting!
---
Wtf are you talking about? You are far from immortal against anyone with a brain .
---
Yesterday i spent 4 hours straight looking for him. Got him once, and he didn't have hunters or longshore. Never again.
---
I had that quest as well kill a wendigo in a clown suit.  That mire location was heavy assautrons for me.
---
I think the last patch had me go against a sentry bot.
---
&gt;My guesses
---
Exactly, I see a ton of Speculation on the subject, just very few real answers.
---
Surely those who pay actual cash for stuff can just... you know, buy whatever is the current fashion trend?
---
Or have they truly patched duping now and you cannot just take "a trip to the eBay armoury" anymore if a patch renders the gear "sub-optimal"?
---
Other major legendary prefixes need a buff imo. Who the fuck would use a rifle that deals 15% bonus damage to animals
---
Yes, you are right, it was my mistake about the gun and I edited my post  thank you! We talked about it as a duped gun, but he only saw the one in the guys inventory but he could have others on alternates. From the content of the replies it is starting to look like that gun isn't as rare as my friend thinks.  Appreciate your input.
---
Bethesda could pay a band to make original music for fallout. It would nullify the licensing fees and start bringing in licensing bucks.
---
Obviously, an insult.
---
But why?
---
View it as an advertising fee because everyone will be able to see your camp
---
Same here. People are so damn creative, I can’t wait to see everyone’s places.
---
I agree.  but over taxing people had never solved anything lol. This is just going to make me use their machines as a beacon for my camp. The problem is also with the vendor bots. Nothing cool spawns there anymore. I would honestly start there. Have the bots actually spawn legendary items that are player specific. Doesnt have to be a badass spawn everytime but something cool with a high cap price.
---
Fuck yea my thoughts exactly. It's about brining some things down and some things up to hopefully have them all meet somewhere in the middle.
---
Sorry I missed you man, I got the time zone wrong and showed up an hour late.
---
Yeah. I get the economics of it. I do wish there was an in fiction reason for it. Like it goes to the Grafton Mayor as a tax or something. Or it goes to the G.A.S. and those prize certificates actually are worth something.
---
This is clearly an example of a TROLL post as they:
---
\- are insulting (calls the OP a duper with absolutely ZERO evidence, and wants him to "stay gone" which is ignorant)
---
\- didn't read the OP 
---
\- didn't understand the OP
---
**MODERATORS:** This person should be banned from this forum as this is exactly the sort that waste space in forums and say nothing of value.  They have been reported.
---
My question to ANYONE who immediately starts to flame / troll anyone's post about suspensions:
---
1. Are you 100% that no one was accidentally suspended or banned by Bethesda?  
---
2. Is Bethesda perfect and incapable of making mistakes? (even though they have clearly buggered up this game many, many times from day 1 and have admitted as much)
---
3. What will you say when you get banned? (for doing nothing wrong)  Will you enjoy it when some ignorant troll says "stay gone, you duped" ?
---
I am all for the guilty being punished, but I cannot believe for a second that Bethesda's suspensions were 100% accurate and they didn't suspend any innocent players (given their track record, and that ALL people make mistakes).
---
No worries
---
The changelog seems to indicate good things, even if the mod description still has it seeming like it's a royal PITA to use.
---
I will definitely be taking a look at that again.  I couldn't be bothered with it in the state it was in earlier, but it seems like he's found a solution needed to make it worthwhile!
---
Ya got any more of that pink kool aid to help me make a purchasing decision?
---
I see heavy weapons and shotguns doing the best these days . Crit snipers definitely get theirs but it requires more strategy
---
Someone save me a high-end shotgun (on PC), won't be back online till late next weekend....
---
But as im reading the article, the fee is only associated with buying. If you buy and power a vending machine it will advertise for you.
---
Agreed... though the overall impression from the community seems to be is that they have 100's of items they want to sell.
---
No, your also a cunt, even more so when theres already people there and were using things like tesla rifles to make sure were not killing everything immediately , then you run in and start killing everything before we've even tagged it, then you can go eat a dick
---
Wait until items start disappearing from your inventory. You won't be so happy with it then. Real problem is Bethesda won't acknowledge the problem exists. They just blame it on player mistakes. And some probably just that, mistakes. But at over lvl 140 I know better. This game introduces new bugs every patch and many never get fixed.
---
You'll be fine with that build. I would reccomend raising Tank killer to 3, and saving green thumb for situational use. Especially against later game mobs, the armor piercing is especially important. 
---
I'd say the same for Gunsmith in INT. I would use it primarily, and swap in first aid and scrapper as needed. Gunsmith is probably the best QOL perk for riflemen, as without it you'll be constantly repairing. With batteries included, I'm assuming you're going to be an energy rifleman, and with energy weapon durability Gunsmith is almost a requirement.
---
Probably duped nobody just trades a bloodied handmade anymore. I didn’t see the edit though sorry
---
Only need to revive 20 players.
---
It’s hard
---
Poor lvl 8
---
I think I have it figured out now but there’s only one problem. I only have 3 level ups. Do you know by any chance any sort of fast exp farms or anything of the sort?
---
Agreed with OP.  My expectations are in he middle at this point about both player vending and the legendary vendor.  I think both will make things better than it is today but I don't think they will do everything exactly the way most folks would like.
---
Personally, I was hoping player vending would use a separate stash that was limited to a number of items (or stacks of items if they stack) but free up player inventory space.  I think that would help folks be able to sell heavy items easier.
---
I am also curious if they will raise either the player stash weight again to help accomodate player vending or increase the cap limit which many of us to play the game daily already have reached.
---
Even though my expectations are managed I am still excited to see these changes happen in game.  Any kinds of improvements to make the game more fun is appreciated.
---
The ranger locked in the cage with his dog at the freak show
---
STILL trapped? How do you know? You still entering the dev room? 
---
Yes Bethesda, this comment here..
---
yeah, same, i have seen a lot of what looks like great camps, but for some reason i just feel i would be trespassing, so never went into them to look around, this will be great :)  ( i am only a lv187 lol )
---
Triangle on the PS4! Been playing since November, just found this out a few weeks ago!
---
Just pick one? Honestly, this game has unexpectedly wrenched my heart out for characters I'll never know more times than any other game I can think of.
---
Meh it's probably more that I can't spell or type properly rofl. I always spell it nurfed but everytime I use it I remember that old meme with WoW where they photoshopped a warrior to wield a nerf sword. Good times.
---
&gt; before the base game could be where everyone wanted
---
Except that isn't up to us.
---
I got the mystery pie recipe. But I'm not seeing the mounted head in my camp. No plans for it dropped either. Can someone confirm the mount is a part of the quest?
---
Private servers will destroy this game as we know it.
---
lmao
---
I've yet to see a fog crawler and I just hit my 76 hour mark
---
Wait, sorry, I didn't see the update anywhere.. camps will be immune to damage tomorrow after update in Adventure mode?
---
Yeah I'm fine with using mods, I was more making this so I could get an answer for my friends (and people on the fence over mods). 
---
Perk Loadout Manager has saved me life!
---
Yup. It is. 
---
It's very simple, really. 
---
Bloodied: perks like Serendipity and Nerd Rage. Mutations like Adrenal Reaction. Access to *legendary armor* - especifically, Unyielding or Bolstering are the best choices. Insane damage that scales with every 5% of health missing.
---
Berserker: no perks or mutations to boost your damage. No access at all to legendary armor, because for Berserker to have at least some noticeable bonus damage, you need to have **0 DR and ER**. Of course, no armor available to help you survive and do more damage; no chameleon, sentinel, cavalier... nothing. And even then, it's nowhere close the damage you can get with Bloodied. 
---
I know what I'm saying; I have tested both builds, and I have been using a Bloodied one for quite some time.
---
DR isn't overrated. And even more, DR + Legendary effects on armor isn't overrated. Berserker doesn't have access to any of those.
---
I don't know what kind of enemies you usually fight (probably not players) and which playstyle you use. But I will have to call BS on your claim that you can tank for days without DR. Been there, done that.
---
I mean technically it is P2W, it’s just not *too* predatory
---
Ok, so please, tell me EXACTLY how we should play so we don't ruin everyone else's experience.
---
1. Don't build where Bethesda tells us we can build
---
2. Don't use weapons that Bethesda designed for us
---
3. Don't be so powerful that you can kill people right away (I'm guessing here)
---
What else?
---
Go to dolly soda or the treetop village in the mire of one of the two should have some for sure
---
Yeah they get 10% off the top and you don't have to find a conspicuous place to put your camp. I personally am viewing this as an advertising fee for the added convenience.
---
It may also help fight in game inflation ..allegedly.. I don't know enough about economics to make an argument for or against this. But I have read some convincing post.
---
I can’t/ don’t want to stash anymore 1* items, but that’s a good idea on buying from vendors. Maybe that will help the economy if more of these high level players buy up items with their topped out cap surplus.
---
Im not subed to trash the game tho
---
While I want them to continue buffing under-performing weapons like the laser gun, the game isn't supposed to be balanced around one-shotting everything. So I think anyone who wants Bethesda to rebalance the game by power-creeping everything to Bloodied or Sentinel power levels, is gonna be sorely disappointed.
---
No i have 38 fusion core\`s on me right now. stash if full with legendaries. I\`m using a Bloodied handmade and vats lever action.
---
The best is to avoid them
---
I'm a fan of survival, if everyone starts over and no legendaries allowed. It would make fights more based on skill and tactics than a lucky roll/ duped/traded legendaries.
---
The caps limit absolutely hurts the game and makes caps pointless in the long run.
---
All the folks I know that have hit it and have nothing left to buy just stop playing. It is a bad deal.
---
Hopefully it works for the best.
---
You level up and pick new perks.
---
Laser Musket was cut from 76
---
I didn’t sub to see videos about more randoms trashing the game
---
Hm, serendipity plus lone wanderer plus spamming sweet rolls or canned coffee or nuka cola to keep your ap up so blocker is also active, yeah I can see how that would work. Huh and you wouldn't even need assassin's/sentinel/etc.
---
Yeah and it might give new idea for our camp :)
---
Happens accidentally still, if there is a low-health CAMP part nearby, and a stray shot destroys it, you'll get a few caps bounty.  I've personally seen it happen.
---
Honestly, the emote for this is too situational, and with the changes coming soon, getting a bounty accidentally won't happen at all.  Personally, I'd dump all my junk, get naked, and sit somewhere like the entrance to WS or in the hallway inside and wait a few minutes.
---
They can only sticky 2 post it's a reddit rule not a mod thing. They don't like it anymore than we do.
---
If you have Pacifist on, your CAMP will be immune to player damage unless you're in pvp with that player.
---
I have signage telling people to make themselves at home and I always invite folks in by opening every door.  
---
But I understand where you are coming from.  If I see a CAMP that doesn't have something saying, "Hi, come on in!" I tend to leave without exploring it.
---
It sounds like you play alot, serious question here, do you find that without legendary weapons your builds don't work? I just happened to play steath sniper like every other BG's game I've played so I never really noticed legendarys being necessary to PvE for me.
---
You on PC? I can show you how
---
Wrong , the people who suck at pvp and are basically piñatas filled with caps will find the next fotm build to cry about . I’d be more of a fan of adding more good legendary effects instead of nerfing everything into the ground . This isn’t cod , if you want a 100% equal playing field than you are playing the wrong game
---
What the?! I'm glad I didn't spend the caps on it then. Thanks for the info.
---
This guy knows. Vampire's Buzzblade is just a great fun.
---
Is that how it's going to work? The last inside the vault update gave me the impression that it would just be a "trade your stars for scrip and buy what the legendary vendor has randomly generated when you have enough" thing.
---
But the mod author is really quick with a fix. usually within a few hours.
---
The same can be said about explosive weapons and the hard counters to those. Aka dense and fireproof. Those are necessary to be competitive in PvP. The reliance on a mechanic to counter something isn't reason alone to nerf it. Simply because people fail to research how to, or apply the effective counters. 
---
And Assassin sentinel is NOT a build. It is a set of armor that can be applied to ANY build.
---
Or in the Cranberry Bog's forest. Theres tons of scorched Fog Crawlers there.
---
Okay, cool.  Thank you!
---
I think he ate some Play Doh too, he might be feeling sick.
---
I run a holotape game tournament at my arcade themed camp every Thursday night for the PC crowd.  I even keep a scoreboard for tracking purposes. 
---
I know it isn't much but there is a whole world of friendly competition to he had there that can freshen up the game a bit if you are interested.
---
If I’m not using energy weapons, should I just stop all of my ammo? I just i could scrap instead.
---
You need to update. It does in game saves again. You have to load SFE as well for it to work properly.
---
There's no level cap and you can use levels to rearrange SPECIAL. Unless they plan on constantly nerfing/buffing multiple perks, I don't think they need to put in any kind of compensation beyond that. It's not a card game like Hearthstone. In the future they might add a more robust respec feature, or the legendary perks feature on the roadmap might serve that purpose.
---
There's only 1 now though...
---
It's also pretty easy to level a character to 60 in two days . You just need aluminum, steel and a good level friend/partner
---
I am on PC. But I am at work. I will not be online, for at least 10 hours....
---
bro this happened to me in a nuke zone ones getting grief off some dude I kill them and he was carrying no joke over 300 pounds worth of junk already broken down
---
Look in the container, take the goods
---
Now, if you look at the options under the window, on the right side you should see "search".  Hit whatever key you need to and the dice are rolled to see if you get a "bonus" item (s).  Take the items if you get lucky (or just "jump" if you are on PC (inside joke)).
---
It's like this so they can have 2 separate scripts, one for everyone, and then the second if the perk card is used.
---
They know it's an issue, there's technical limitations that make doing it correctly somewhat less than simple.  They've brought it up before.  It's doable, just talk a little finesse in the coding.
---
IMO, bulking should *ALWAYS* reduce weight, otherwise there's no point.  Maybe so that you can sell stuff that's not worth 1 cap per piece, but that's it, not really worth a whole system just for that.
---
This post right here shows your true colors . You say a sniper can’t do anything about sent/cav users but snipers is one of the main builds that counter them . You just don’t know how to play
---
True enough, one person's perceived junk can always be another's treasure. I guess since we actively farm the event we didn't realize that it might be a rare drop for some.  I know it's a pain to get a server to activate sometimes, but we rarely have to hop for it here lately. From the sound of it, the gun isn't as rare a find for others as it is was for my friend, but
---
Said it before, say it again. Wandrin' Star
---
You're right!! That's unusual
---
Oh yeah, Nerd Rage is a must. I've been meaning to get some perks on endurance for the Ironclad Perks, which honestly help a lot on survivability butIi'd had to sacrifice from other trees, maybe science. Lone wanderer on charisma helps a lot with an extra 20% less damage if you get it to level 3.
---
Serindipity, iron clad, blocker, there’s a couple perks in Agility that are good defensive perks, there’s some really good mutations like scaly skin. Or you could get power armor and use emergency protocols
---
lol read your screen
---
This to, equip a shotgun and the enforcer card tho ,you'll break it's legs and it just lays There screaming in agony
---
I mean it’s a company, no shit they don’t care.
---
I dont understand why this wasnt a thing even before release. Shows how stupid they are in design. Its awkward.
---
Agreed. It's unfortunate because whenever you reduce the effectiveness of something in a game, people almost take if personally, where it's more for the sake of avoiding power creep that studios tune stuff down rather than up.
---
Rockstar studios isn't the defining authority for the word "griefer." It is intended in the game that you may be attacked by another player. How effective or ineffective they are is irrelevant. End of story. 
---
The game intends it to happen (as of the current state) so it is NOT griefing. The OP has to deal with the perils of the game. This includes other players. For them to call the guy a griefer for trying to kill him in a game where it is allowed, is ridiculous.
---
I have gotten my bloodied Fatman to 5900 DMG.
---
A person tried to attack me and my brother. They lost, and drop 500 of everything. While I carry maybe a bag of fertilizer and tp. It was a good win on my part! Never carry anything good!
---
Out of combat I think that would be fantastic.I would love to switch between: normal, trading, crafting, fast travel card builds.
---
I really like this.  The universal symbol/location to become a standard.
---
10 caps says someone will figure out a way to get around that in the first couple days, then we wait another 3-4 weeks for that to get patched.
---
Maybe less waiting if it makes vending machines vulnerable too.
---
Personally, between the possibility of that, and the possibility of someone finding a way to use vending to rip sellers off somehow, will very likely make me sit back and wait before trying to put much of anything in the machines.
---
I'm all for a higher cap max, but as far as stash space goes, I'm fine with 800. I've come to the conclusion that no matter what the limit is, people (myself included) will want it to be more. I don't think any number will ever be enough when you think about 6 months from now...
---
I was wandering the Savage Divide after completing the Encryptid event and came across a cat named Murgle. He crawled up to me and began purring and I turn away. I access my pipboy to drop the cat some food (for immersion purposes) and I hear Murgle screeching. I look up from my pipboy and see Murgle lying on the floor dead. I don't know what killed him, or what he died from, but it was heartwrenching to see some poor random cat get killed just like that.
---
&gt;All these "i was banned for no reason" people are simply lying.
---
So you state: “All these "i was banned for no reason" people are simply lying.”
---
Do you have evidence of this?  Can you PROVE it?   Or is it simply your poorly founded opinion that you masquerade as fact?
---
So you are calling anyone who proclaims their innocence a liar,  that is ignorant and unfounded (as you couldn’t possibly be able to prove that).
---
You should be banned from Reddit for making such a claim. (you have been reported) I cannot believe the level of ignorance from people like you, who know nothing, have zero actual knowledge, but flame and insult complete strangers (for no reason other than to be a troll).
---
That's a login glitch once you exit the power armor the extra 100 pounds will go away if you equip calibrated shocks then you can get an additional 100 pounds carry weight.
---
"but enjoy exploiting" is a sideways slight. No sense in mincing words on that.  
---
Rather than be as you described yourself, remember that you're responding to a "look at my house" post from someone who also wants these exploits fixed. If you're wanting to take those feelings out and are on PC, add me (same username). I'm currently unsure if I can repair broken walls/roofing on the structure, given that I cannot move either due to a "lack of support" post removing the foundations.
---
Yes. I literally made a new character for survival. There’s 0 chance a non-PvP optimized character is killing them in a straight up fight.
---
Ok so never leave the power armor got it
---
On a similar note, don't be a dick and kill people who came to do an event just to steal their junk. Happened to a friend and I the other day and by the time I came back with power armor and a flame thrower the assholes were gone.
---
Correct
---
Omg this idea needs to happen. They need to make a new system like this will less limits.
---
Looks like we found someone who sucks and wants to cry to mommy instead of getting better
---
Wrong. Nice try though, I farmed for and traded for all of my gear. And I do have BiS everything for my build. Just because others failed to do so, is not grounds for me, or others like me, to be punished.
---
With hard farming, selling and trading on the market, it is EASY to attain your "god weapons and armor." People put fourth no effort.
---
Nobody believes anything drops, and that their luck applies to everyone else too, and its not fair, etc. They think these items are pulled from thin air? If they are duplicated, an original HAD to exist somewhere right?
---
I didn't found this, I have to come back to the vault
---
it happens with the calibrated shocks as well. Running around with 555 Carry Weight is interesting.
---
That was the plan but sadly it's looking like it won't be in tomorrows patch. I'll go dig a link up I saw yesterday (I think) .......
---
You know how berserker's legendaries are crap because you need to be practically naked for them to do anything?
---
Think of how well a level 1 berserker's weapon would work for a low level player.  And what that might be worth to someone leveling up a mule.
---
Now take another look at those level 1 legendary eye bots...
---
I'm just going to automatically price things %10 higher. I'm sure I'm not the only one.
---
Same here. I have no idea what numbers are, but I know I never seem to repeat a server so long as I wait 10s before logging back in, no matter the time. EDIT: on PC
---
Bloodied, 2 shots, adrenal, explosive buff... Will get it past 700 eaay
---
Objectively look at it. There are other things that need "nurfed"
---
Hang around the Encryptid event lol
---
Do you remember where you got the plans to make the syringer itself?
---
You don't understand how inflation works.
---
I do this with deathclaws. Necessary but... unconfortable
---
You arent lol. But on large ticket items ill still do a person to person trade. Im not giving the man thousands in caps🤣🤣
---
Even if my example is wrong, it doesn't invalidate my point.
---
Also I was referring to non Vats snipers who don't get vats Crits to cut through the flat dr.
---
Unless your telling me that non Vats snipers can somehow manage to both get a stagger on one shot, then land enough headshots during that one stagger to do any meaningful damage, and that is a reasonable thing. If that's the case idk what you want me to say man, that's really fucked up.
---
SBQ Reward
---
Oh, you gotta get out of that tin can and get yourself some nice legendary armor. Way better.
---
But 1H means one handed weapons like swords, 2H means two handed stuff like sledgehammers.
---
Shills
---
Grow up.
---
Bud you already told me I was wrong. It is a straightforward hope that you enjoy it, and don't just do it because its there. Let's end this.
---
☹️ thanks for the info!
---
Oh ok👌👎
---
I have a keypad locked door because I like it, but I just put the Code over the door so people can still enter, and a rooftop exit. I had an amazing base, moved it, and could never lay it down again. Now its just decent and functional.
---
that is what I called my armor piercing lever action rifle because of the number of times I saw these comments lols
---
Where can farm power cores?
---
Raising the prices will lead people away from your shop.  Even though you'd be getting what you think is fair, the consumer will be paying even more.  Bethesda is hoping that when the cap abundance disappears, then prices for goods will drop.
---
My question is how the 10% is determined.  Is it like real world tax where the 10% is added onto the original price, for example, a good for 100 caps would be automatically priced at 110?  Or will the 10% be deducted from the sale price?  Countries in the real world add the tax onto the base price and it seemed to decrease inflation like expected.
---
Agreed. It is an RPG with build and character development. Your gear, levels, and thought mean nothing if you cannot benefit from your build.
---
The whiners are the same who run in with a heavy machine gun, wearing power armor, and get mowed down. Then they cry about how it isn't fair these guys have "god tier one shot" weapons because they have a job etc. Can't put in the time.
---
I have a full time job, and many other responsibilities. I'm one of the "Sent/assholes" with a bloody sniper build, what's everyone's excuse then?
---
Mate it's not out, we don't know.
---
Are you focusing on bloodied?
---
You can get out of it just re-enter it and server hop and you get the 100 pounds back. Also kill Brahman and Ragstags they will give you a bonus 20 pounds carry weight when cooked and kill Mole rats and cook them also it with give you a plus 1 strength bonus.
---
I need more details on this.
---
Not everyone is constantly chasing legendaries, and it wasn’t directly addressed. Also it’s not a bug, it is meant to affect those interior cells. The only bug regarding that is that you don’t take rads while inside
---
Then that’s your dumb ass fault ,It’s part of the game . If you don’t want to use it then that’s you handicapping yourself. Fallout is vats and vats is fallout . Your basically saying , why can’t I use my drill and lock picking perk cards to kill this guy that has played 1000 hours to get good gear
---
finally nerf sentinel or make all the others better
---
Literally every game ever will have people losing their shit over nerfs. Doesn't matter how minor the nerfs are.
---
Bloodied build is powerful but it has a huge trade off. 
---
I am not sure how other builds can compete with no trade off
---
Glad to hear it. Offer is still up to help break this place, if you've the time. Cheers!
---
Just make sure you hit the capital building
---
I think we will have to agree to disagree on the impact this will have being added at any level or having it implemented in this fashion. Here's another example, on the PvE side of things without perk cards going past 15 points. Everyone that has a couple of these shielded suits is automatically less SPECIAL imo. They now have the ability to re-spec their build on the fly. Need to pick a lock? Change your suit. Overencumbered and then some? Change your suit. Need some wood? There's a suit for that. It makes certain niches that make certain builds so fun available to everybody. My main cant pick a lock for the life of him. He can whip up some mean brew and wields a double barrel like its apart of his body and can drop enemies like nothing in his drunken rampage. But one thing that constantly makes me happy/amazed is a player running up and picking a safe on the fly. In my head im like "how". But I know I'm not Special that way. Needless to say Mr. or Mrs. Lockpick usually end up on my team. You add in the shielded suit re-spec this interaction is completely eliminated. Toons need to be unique not a master of all trades. I think with the legendary effect being added you might see the cards you need added. Like for example walking Arsenal has the community believing its an all out weapon weight reduction perk you can add.
---
Hell no.
---
With a couple of caveats:
---
- SBQ is an absolute chore with self-crafted gear, even as melee. I think this is compounded by the fact that the longer you take to kill her the more people turn up and the more adds she spawns, which results in an stygian mess of instanced loot piles, lag and server de-syncs.
---
- The new mobs - Impostor and Sheepsquatch - seem 'tuned up' for 'gear+' which would be consistent with the devs giving us the ability to craft 'gear+' once the relevant plans have dropped for us.
---
However legendaries enable different playstyles that would be impractical or frankly a total chore to run without them either because you are going to be forever tied up to the lead/steel/gunpowder loop to feed your weapons, because you are going to die a lot if you cannot remove the threats fast  enough - and we know that the game only will allow so many respawns before you hit the dreaded infinite loading screen - and because you are going to be more dependent on consumables.
---
It just boils down to what you want to do. If you stay away from the SBQ you can easily log in, do your dailies (both for exp loot and the atom ones), do some farming and log out with self crafted gear.
---
If however you want to see how quickly and 'cheaply' you can do a WS &gt; Steak House &gt; Rob-Co &gt; Harper's &gt; Wes-Tek loop legendaries help a fair bit.
---
That's on you for pre-purchasing a game that came out less than 2 weeks before the biggest sale day of the year.
---
Thanks for the tip! Ill be hunting one down!
---
You forgot about Butchers Bounty, for meats.
---
Hey, you. You stay gone too.

Yea I just flat out don't believe you. No, I don't think how you aquaired your gear matters in regards to if it needs balancing, but I sure do think it makes people like yourself very suspicious. If you really cared about balance, you wouldn't care that the set you use might get nurfed, because you can always just find a new set to use. It's irrelevant to the argument as a whole.
---
My whole point saying that is because your obnoxious and not really contributing anything of value anywhere in this thread. So either you farmed hard for your shit and are just an impudent child who doesn't understand how game balance works, or your  some dumbass who payed for the gear and is upset your losing value. I chose wrong, but forgive me, it was a 50/50 shot.
---
Actually I don't think so, not exclusively anyway.  Usually CTD (or the console equivalent) are conflicts at the local level, *regardless* of the network situation.  Definitely local, but not definitely network.
---
Most of the time, it's a graphics issue, but unhandled exceptions/situations involving anything with a number attached (so, anything) can cause the game to stop if it doesn't know how to handle the numbers.  Bad packets and other network problems *can* cause this, but networks these days handle data pretty redundantly, so it's less common to see data corruption causing issues.  It's still *possible*, but it is pretty unusual.
---
I'm assuming OP knows the difference between 'crash' and 'disconnect' though, if not, then what you said is completely applicable.
---
Hence the “with any luck” comment.  Another form of monster mash legendaries with the randomness of server hopping to find something good...  well, just hold onto hope!
---
There is a human npc in the dev room all alone named wooby
---
It's "equipped" but not active if that makes sense. the only attribute, legendary or mod that are still active are the weight reduction ones.
---
Bethesda why can't I have Brotherhood of steel themed camp items like barricades and flags? Take my $5 dollars each for at least 20 different items.
---
You afraid of free LSD?
---
Be careful asking for help not being one-shot because when people complained last time Bethesda made it much harder to one-shot kill people. "Isn't that a GOOD thing!?!?" you ask? Well, no it actually made Survival mode MUCH worse. Previously, if you ran into someone with a god weapon and a set of "Ebay armor", you could save up a crit and still one-shot drop them if you had a decent weapon and build, which mitigated their advantage somewhat. You could be careful, stealthy, and hit-and-run these Uber-Tryhards with their duped weapons and cheat-gear. Now, you can't do that unless you ALSO have a god-weapon. After these whining bitches complained about getting killed:
---
 "Waaahhhh! I have all this ultimate gear I bought and sometimes I get sniped because I think I should be invincible and did something stupid that got me killed! Waaaahhhh! This isn't fair! Wahhhhh! I should just win every time because I paid good money for this armor and duped gun and I'm special! Waaaaahhhhh!!!!"
---
Bethesda put this stupid first-shot percentage damage limiter in the game that made it so only explosive shotguns or god-tier weapons could overwhelm it and still one-shot people, but the average Joe with a decent gun couldn't VATS crit down the god-gear people any more. So YOU, the average player, was still getting one-shot toasted while the people who already had a HUGE advantage got yet another advantage: Basic immunity to being one-shot. You can still bust them for about 2/3 of their health, but they just stim and two seconds later are back to full health, and you are dead. 
---
So if anything, it needs to be EASIER to kill players, so that guns and armor don't matter too much, outside PVE (Player Vs. Environment), and then stealth, good positioning, cover, and smart gameplay will matter more in PVP like it should instead of just being invulnerable to attack and spamming your TSE Handmades and Shotguns.
---
There is no compensation for any changes made to any perks. That was what sparked so many ragequits after the TS and explosive nerfs.
---
My guess is because he's not in the game.
---
its actually not a legendary its just a normal bear but still free bear loot
---
What platform are you? I'm on Xbox and have a Cuckoo clock plan
---
Ah right, that helps and where would you advise the best locations to get armor from
---
I feel you there. I was doing this last night myself. Plus it never helps that people put their camp so close to where he is supposed to spawn. 
---
I was lucky though and found him after countless tries, but he had almost nothing on him to purchase. Oh well! Till I find him again.
---
I just wish I had 200 to carry..... as a crafter I go through screws and adhesive like air
---
Can you build a nuclear generator yet?  If you can claim the workshops at the Poseidon energy plant  Thunder Mountain and Mongolith you will get 3 cores every 15 minutes per energy plant.
---
Be courteous of other players and dont be a fuckin knobhead, if this is too much for you to grasp fuck me you were raised wrong.  
---
I didnt say dont use 1 hit kill weapons, thats fine, but if theres other people there be mindful of them, dont be a prick taking every kill there for yourself.  
---
You can build behind the whitesprings all you want I didnt say you couldnt, what I said was if you do and its a shitty turret camp expect it to be torn down by the people your shoving your middle finger up to by doing so.  
---
3 is entirely on Bethesda, PvP needs balancing, cant blame the players for using the tools given to them here, you either be OP or lose in PvP
---
Yeah, the fact that the 50 has zero spin-up time is a huge benefit, and the 50 has far more manageable recoil as far as i can tell.
---
Hard same. It's good, and it's not bad, but it ain't amazing. Would have liked a stronger emphasis on the "this is all a vault tec simulation" angle.
---
What... It will work like this.
---
If you price something at 100 in your shop, you get 90 when that person buys it. You're thinking too deeply into this man, it's not an actual real world tax, the game just literally is taking 10% of the money your sales make when people buy it and disappear it.
---
Oh yea there's a huge horde inside! Thanks
---
Thats actually a interesting idea. From what i gathered, the fee will be paid by the vendor per item. It would be no different than using a card reader for a smart phone that charges 2.49% per transaction. The seller pays that card fee not the payer. So now its up to the seller on how and what to sell. This is why some places dont take card transactions under a certain dollar amount because they lose overhead on processing fees.
---
I am alright with things being brought into balance, objectively. However the majority here fails to do so, and lacks the capability.
---
It is simply something is perceived as unfair, so nerf it. Alot of people here don't have the experience or knowledge of PvP to know. It's those with little time to play, who want to be competitive against someone who has invested the hard work and time. It isn't right.
---
Lol I thought it was a actually player who got stuck and couldn’t leave. The fact it’s a NPC name is awesome
---
&gt;cant blame the players for using the tools given to them here
---
And yet (ability to build at whitesprings, no "be mindful" mandate) you CAN apparently blame players for using the tools given to them.
---
This is the fallout 76 community ^
---
Also,
---
You’re*
---
Swap some of those points in charisma to intelligence to make it positive again.
---
I think using them is safe, but Bethesda can ban you whenever if they feel like. It's like they unofficially officially hold the stance of allowing mods, but any cheating ones will get the hammer.
---
Rad Ant Lager gives 50 pounds carry weight, really handy to carry a few bottles for emergencies.
---
Not even PvP in mind for my idea to be honest, more that in current adventure mode everyone gets to a point where theyre just OP as fuck, like me at the moment, there is nothing in game that makes me think "oh shit im gonna die" its just "well this is gonna eat up a load of ammo"
---
The way I describe value is a combination of rarity and the need for the item. Adhesive isnt necessarily rare but you also need it to build and repair virtually everything so it's quite valuable. Same goes for screws. 
---
Before they changed the need for ballistic fiber to repair armor (I might be wrong but I havent needed BF once on my new level 30 account) it was insanely valuable because it was quite scarce but you needed it to repair armor. 
---
Something like nuclear waste is something that's very rare but it's also not needed that often, and usually when its needed the amount is relatively little. So nuclear waste is something of average value to me because it's relatively rare but relatively unneeded also.
---
Just a few examples of how you're right in that adhesive is not necessarily rare but it's still quite valuable.
---
I don’t use it often but it’s in a lot of repairs, and a good number of mods. I used a lot leveling up but very little now that I’m endgame level.
---
I bet the way around it will be to lure monsters to a persons camp. I haven't seen anything about camps being invulnerable to monster attacks.
---
Imo the only destructible thing in camps should be doors.
---
Probably the ghoul friend the young kids at Harper's Ferry, how they tried to keep it a secret and ultimately everyone ran him off and he hid. Hope to see him in 76.
---
Trust me, you'll be paying for it.
---
I like how this gets downvotes, but it's commonly accepted you don't camp there.
---
Well yeah... thats what this post is about. You just kinda summed it up bud. Relax!
---
I can see your point. I still think it would add a cool wrinkle to the game.
---
The only time I had to level some dudes camp is when a bunch of lower levels invited me to a party saying there was a guy who griefed their camps. So they showed me where his camp was and took out my two-shot fat man and then I leveled the guys camp. And then I let them take my bounty
---
They patched that put awhile ago I believe, you can only store 1 fusion core per chassis.
---
There are no longer guys with 100s of those in their inventory.  But there are 1000s of guys with 1 in their inventory.   Yes—he overpaid.  That TSE is worth 15k.  And that outfit is worth 4k.
---
Just FYI, scrapper perk on ballistic weapons nets a lot of steel. Miniguns alone are 25-26 steel.
---
Use the spawn point at Lady Janets Soft Serve. Just FT there, and run W down the road to the bus. Trigger point is right before the bus, the vendor will spawn on the road in front of you.
---
Now just complete all the in game challenges, I’ll see ya in 7,600 hours
---
No, it's not. Vats should not be mandatory, and withought sentinel/assassin it's not. If those affixes didn't exist, or weren't flat dr and where isntead regular values, it wouldt be an issue.
---
Luck, and by extension vats, is a build choice. my whole point is these specific legendary builds limit build variety by forcing specific strategies. So frankly, you kind of proved my point for calling me a dumbass for not using vats. I'm not a vats character, and shouldnt have to be in order to be somewhat competitive.
---
Your gear and hours played don't entitle you to force a playstyle upon other people, and that's exactly what the current "top tier" sets do. That's reality kid, like it or not.
---
Upgrade to a bloody build and get Unyielding armor. +15 str, +20 if you put an endurance point in Radicool
---
Then why are you complaining? I’m not a PVP player. I just want to login after a long day at work and murder some sheepsquaches. Is that so wrong?
---
Serums don't average 200 caps on PC. They're more typically 400 or 500 caps per, and you know what? They're still a great deal. If a serum goes to 220 caps due to tax, and you decide to avoid mutations, or to buy them for \~2,000 caps from the NPCs instead, that's just foolish. 
---
Besides, what better use do you have for caps. There isn't much you can buy with them for now.
---
This would cause worse balance issues than the crazy ones the game already has
---
If I decided to stand in a doorway and just talk to my friend for 6 hours while you were trying to get out would that be me just being a normal person or would you think im a prick, I mean, there no sign saying I cant block an entire doorway and piss off a bunch of people.  
---
This is common sense, be mindful that your actions affect other people, building a CAMP outside of the whitesprings clubhouse with the sole intent of killing every ghoul there before other players ever even see them is just a selfish thing to do
---
I found a rad roach on a toilet with a wedding ring and a top hat. Looks like the lad died with his wife
---
The cap limit is required to prevent further deflation of the cap’s value. Your claim that it makes caps worthless is blatantly false: without it, people would be sitting on millions of caps, massively over-saturating the trading community’s economy. Legendaries that vend for 10k caps will see their price rise tenfold to match the deflated value of the cap. It’s basic macroeconomics
---
Hahahah
---
I use an entirely different armor/weapons for pvp than I do with pve . My ghoul slayer set makes whitesprings/burrows super fast
---
On my 100th or so queen i finally got a good 3* weapon. My 75th ish one i got calibrated ultracite shocks which is awesome. So I hope you have better luck than I do! The flux and repair kits are good too you always get them after completing the event.
---
im sorry to hear that, that is why im scared to ever move my existing houses, to get around it i just made new characters to build new houses heheh
---
Why would their sentinel effect be gone? Crouching counts as standing still.
---
I agree, it is unfortunate that the moderators allow such witch hunting / flaming / trolling on posts (I am going to look for a better moderated Fallout forum for reasonable people to have discussions, free of trolls).  
---
Many of the people here apparently believe that Bethesda is incapable of making mistakes (in spite of all the mistakes they have made and admitted to) and that everyone who was banned is guilty and a liar (which is absurd)
---
Yup crafted over 40 handmades and scrapped them.before I got the damn suppressor...
---
The same thing happened to me over the weekend OP, it totally blows. I am hoping they fix this in tomorrow's patch.
---
I already think you're a prick, but that's just because of your attitude.
---
It's funny because I agree with everything you say, I just think you say it in such a bossy bitch way that it comes off as unappealing. Maybe it's me, who knows. Remember, this is just a video game.
---
What level are you or what weapon are you using? You must not be doing enough damage to her. e.g. My level 25 mule doesnt have enough damage to get through her armor so I dont even bother with her. Vs. my level 100+ characters with proper builds and god tier weapons only needs to hit her once and it counts.
---
Yeah, I would have traded the outfit for just the caps or maybe just for the ammo even, but they both obviously thought it was fair or I'm sure or they wouldn't have made the deal.  I personally am now much more educated about the availability of that particular weapon and it doesn't appear to be extremely rare for others.  The costume is not a rare thing for me and my group (I have 2 full sets in my stash now), so I guess it's all in the perspective of what we each see as valuable.
---
Well add me in game when you get on and next time you see me online come say hi
---
All I do is swap cards.  Low luck build.  3 points taken up by Class Freak.  Every ammo container, med bag / box or cap stash I have to swap out cards.  It is a very tedious and slow process.  Same thing happens when I hack or pick locks.  It’s laborious.
---
Dumb question because I can't remember - how do you get frames (not PA pieces) again?  I can't remember how I got the one I have...
---
Haha just be prepared. Once you start shooting close to every ghoul in the building is gonna show up, you’ll have to fight through 20+ ghouls at once
---
SHH. DO NOT TELL THEM ABOUT THAT PLACE.
---
So it’s our fault u want to play a shit non vats sniper build? Lol you are funny
---
Just to make your life worse, anyone who gets to fort defiance can get the plans for the entire Ultracite suit once they finish the vos quest line.
---
Dev room?
---
Oh sorry I thought you were replying to another comment. So. On your phone, Google 'liberty prime soundboard' then play clips over the microphone of your headset
---
This. When I got them, I farmed a bunch of legendary eyebots and got some nice level 1-5 instigating weapons. Love my lvl 1 instigating pump action!
---
Worst case I got some semi interesting stuff to do weird builds on. Finished my Berserker and love it, next up is Weightless Wood Stealth build, next was thinking of doing a Suppresors/Empath Build. Keeps it fun for me. And if I can turn over the items into script for something I actually will use then I will consider it as a profitable experience, if it is disappointing, well I had to spend caps on something XD
---
Okay, I understand, thanks.  For me though, I was not even planning on putting expensive items in the vending machine.  I'd rather personally trade expensive items to players in case bugs or exploits exist on release.  Besides, I'm pretty sure people dont buy diamonds from a vending machine irl.  I'm planning on keeping things like 1-2 star legendaries, ammo, meds, and some food in my vending machine at lower prices than vendor bots anyway.
---
[MMO Economics](https://youtu.be/sumZLwFXJqE)
---
There's a reason for it. Accept it as a small fee to keep a healthier in-game economy.
---
You're way overthinking. And my guess is you play this game way too much. 2 Xboxes?  Constantly max Caps?  Damn dude. How are you not burnt out
---
That aside, it's going to be as simple as this:  mark 10 - 20 items for sale from your stash. Someone goes to your storefront and buys it.  It goes to buyer directly from your stash.  10% of that sale goes to Uncle Howard. Think of it as a convenience fee.  Boom. That's it.
---
 What more can we possibly want?  To view item, yes, we can just hope for this. If it's not available I'm sure it will be eventually. And to barter through a vending machine??  Its a vending machine. Not gonna happen. It's a simple mechanic, dont overthink or try to complicate it.
---
  Just put up a sign saying "message me to counter offer or save 5%!"  Then you can also save on the tax by having them in person.  Example, gun posted for 2k.  Someone counters with 1800k.  You come in person and can sell it for 1710.  Save on tax. Buyer got a discount for reaching out.  They don't reach out?  Convenience fee of not stopping what youre doing.
---
Lastly, what's 10% of 0?
---
Absolutely! They are totally worth playing too!
---
I can not find that one at all.
---
Yes it is a competitive advantage
---
Against those running wood troubleshooters are but if one person out 1000 hours into the game and the other has 200 , shouldn’t the person with 1000 hours have the advantage ?
---
If the camp has turrets, that might work, otherwise it might be hard to get the mob to stop attacking you and start attacking that inanimate object over there...
---
I see destructible camp items as being the risk you take for putting your camp somewhere too active, though I don't think a level 5 mole rat should be able to take out my whole camp even if given enough time...tie your player level to your base items, and anything more than X level lower just ignore them.  And/or (I'll take either or both), get the announcements working again that something is attacking your camp.
---
I managed to put my camp in a higher level area (near Lake Eloise, so near a fissure site as well), but somehow I've only seen mobs 10 or less attacking. I think because there are no spawn points near enough, but camp attacks are scripted even without spawns nearby.  But I still manage to lose the occasional railing or crop.
---
The developers room holds every item in the game or items yet to come out and people got in there a couple months ago but if you are caught you will be banned.
---
Yeah you need to deal a percentage or you wont get a item drop or xp from the queen kill. This prevents low level characters from swooping in for free xp and also the SBQ scales based on the number of people. During the early days (November) everyone would come in with no damage and make the SBQ life insanely high and also doing no damage because their gear was crappy. She'd just fly away after 20 mins.
---
Yeah I was glued to the spot reading this
---
&gt;I already think you're a prick,   
---
An excellent judge of character I see.  
---
Now you say bossy, but If you looks at my original comment you'll see I said it was entirely up to the person where they pace their CAMP  
---
&gt;Well basically its a build at your own risk site,  
---
But that building there annoys a lot of people and it will probably get leveled for doing so, I didnt say dont build there, I said be prepared to lose it if you do
---
Gauss rifle gets comically long with a silencer.
---
i checked this losers post history, this is his favorite "reply" like a 12 year old boss baby
---
Absolutely, and they need to be brought in line with other items otherwise the game will continue to be totally broken at the highest levels.
---
Just FYI - you can fast travel to teammates / friends for free.
---
The woman or the ranger?
---
nice :)
---
I actually was not until a few days ago. never really looked at the damage increase. somehow i still think it\`s tricky to go for a low health build. But it is tempting. Right now i\`m running with 45% health.
---
Oh, and I imagine the Caps limit will be handled like it is everything else.  You have 24k. Someone buys something for 2k.  They spend 2k but you only get 1k to your cap.  Seller will be responsible for not going over. How pissed would you be as a buyer if you couldn't buy something cause the seller is a hoarder?
---
There's absolute asshats that go to the iss event JUST to steal people's loot bags.
---
yeah its pretty bad on some servers, then others seem to be fine
---
since betheda hasnt fixed this bug for a long time now, my advice if you notice it, try to switch servers, hopefully it will be better on the next one
---
Comically huge too!
---
So yeah, not only do they need to add more poison weapons and mods, but they need to buff poison damage. That's what I'm saying. Like the sheepsquatch shard does 75 ballistic and 3 poison I think, but if that were something like 50/28 or 40/40 there would be more versatile mechanics and strategies to combat DR and DOT can force people to use stims (I can see this as a possible tactic against bloodied builds) or chip away at in-game enemies without poison resistance like SBQ. Just throwing ideas out.
---
I absolutely understand that, but with nothing to spend caps on (the real problem) and an artificial limit in place they currently hold no value to the long term players who have nothing to buy.
---
The high end traders of the game have long since stopped using caps as a currency, which is far worse.
---
No worries, I figured that's what it was.
---
This is essentially the golden rule for trading. Ive seen the outfit go for 4-6k which is usually what a tse handmade goes for unless someone over pays. Plus you never know if this dude was sitting on a ton of caps and ammo on alt characters so the extra he gave you could have been of little value to him.
---
Well if you own that which you seek to destroy, you have a valid “vote” in my opinion.
---
Given that the Wazer Wifle has shown up more than once I cant really fault you for that.
---
Is there a source that we can look into?
---
well lets hope Bethesda reads this and the other threads about this, since the Survival mode is still in BETA, there is hope they will make adjustments
---
What kind of build did you go with? I haven't played since a bit after launch and I want to get back into the game but have no idea whats viable or whats been nerfed to all hell.
---
I get that it's part of the game but pick a fair fight earlier in the week I helped defend a workshop with 2 level 21's I am a 150ish player they were a little cautious but I dropped some extra plans and chems and walked away when I was going to fast travel to my camp I noticed a level 47 player at the workshop I went back and he was crouching and sneaking around which I  found suspicious  so I waved to him and flashed my weapons quickly then sat on the players couch till he left.
---
FO76...
---
Downvote just got that edit.
---
Sorry I misunderstood your question hope someone with more info can help you out
---
I'm going to do this later as I'm wanted for lock picking a government supply drop. Had no idea it triggered the wanted thing.
---
Dont get in a hurry. Take your time and enjoy it.
---
Also dont follow the main quest too far, tooearly. It will lead you into areas you arent ready for.
---
No it doesn't
---
Lol borderlands gun maybe.
---
The reality is that you don’t use vats so you want to nerf the builds you can’t kill . The truth comes out
---
I've offered 1,000 stable violet flux for BE / B25 weapons and been turned down. Item for Item is the only way the big guys will trade, and rightly so - you can easily get everything else yourself. We BADLY need a real currency. If rerolling legendaries was a thing with the Purveyor, we could trade in Legendary Scrip (her currency), but sadly scrip is not tradeable and AFAIK you can't reroll slots on legendaries. You can only purchase random legendaries she has on her, which will be garbage 99.999999% of the time, meaning if you want to use up your scrip, you'll need to server hop over and over looking for her. Just.... dumb.
---
I killed the imposter sheepsquatch robat a few days ago, and got a drill.
---
Same here, happened a lot yesterday. Happened before to. I'm on PS4.
---
where does one get this info. i've looked, cant find any info on this ?
---
Railway
---
My method: see a workbench anywhere, pick up everything in sight and scrap it. Keep screws (or whatever target material you want) , leave everything else in a container
---
Keep your junk !
---
I really don't want to see things destroyed, just balanced so we have a better game. I hate nerfs, but there are so many things out of whack here that I can't see any other way out of it here.
---
I agree, I really wasn't trying to made a case for him being a bad trader, don't even know the guy.  It just seemed  a bit much for a costume.  I was really just trying to get a better idea about the popularity/rarity of the costume and thanks to the replies I've gotten, it seems to be a fair deal all the way around.
---
Exactly, I launched the Nuke solo and everything but nope
---
did it yesterday afternoon and got two diseased legendary squatches.
---
I'm not complaining, you are the one complaining your build will get a Nerf. I'm simply saying you will then be doing same damage as anyone else that isn't a melee.
---
I do pvp and would like to see balance across the board. Right now shotguns do vastly more damage than other ranged. This is what happens if you build around a super op build.
---
You sure try hard at playing ignorant. Do you honestly belive that if all the top players on the leaderboards have the exact same sets, those sets don't need to be changed? The fact that a full set of vanguard is nothing compared to a full set of sentinels is the best example, one makes you capable of taking multiple hits, the other won't stop anyone from one shotting you. I'm not arguing that other sets don't also need buffs, but if all sets functioned like sentinel/assassin/calvalier work the game would be even less playable.
---
Staggers, vats Crits, and radiation damage should not be the only viable ways to fight people in a game with so much diversity, even if it means the gear you love so much doesn't give you such a massive advantage. 
---
Frankly, this whole complex you have where you have "put in the time" so you deserve this massive competitive advantage is just pathetic. Google how game balance in any MMO works and show me an example of a successful dev not nurfing over preforming items. I guarantee they don't fucking exsist because to balance a game, your constantly tuning things down.
---
I mean come on kid, in the same paragraph you say people calling for nurfs just precive this as unfair, then you end it with "it isn't right", like you feel it's "unfair". Your allowed to be sad when your favorite toys get nurfed, you aren't allowed to be a hypocrite and not expect me to call you on it.
---
He might not exist at all any more. There's only one way to know.
---
That would make a great bit at the next E3. Pete Hines and Todd Howard doing good cop/bad cop with Wooby. Poor Wooby lol
---
Just got to know where to look. Try trading as much as possible. Whether your selling or buying. Plus you might sell something you are carrying ATM that you might just drop later. I bought my bloodied,explosive,double barrel in game no app or anything. Found the dude trading at overseers, 2500 caps. Got a couple of Sentinel pieces I bought for no more than 600 caps. You'd be surprised at the number of "Arturos" and "Lucas" you find. This is all going to be easier with player vending. The grind to get better gear is much easier starting tomorrow.
---
i have a few questions on your updated build if you have a bloodied handmade and vats lever, why the melee stuff? and i would also suggest fireproof even at lvl 2 it makes you pretty much immune to car explosions, explosive weapons (turrets) and scorchbeasts air attacks.  
---
if your running a bloodied handmade id suggest optimizing that to up its damage, radicool, nerd rage, adrenal reaction, possibly unyeilding armor. just because its bloodied doesnt mean you have to run radded out but as you take damage the damage on your weapon increases greatly.  
---
i get wanting the qol perks like lead belly and good doggy but really food and water are not really hard to come by in the game through normal play.  
---
as far as batteries included only carry 2-3 on you 90% or higher, usually more than enough to last through a SBQ event and keep 10-15 in stash, almost 40 is overdoing it unless you spend all your time in power armor which on a rifles build is kinda wasted. i am constantly dropping fusion cores due to not needing them since you can find them everywhere and they also drop off mobs as well and thats even ignoring ones that are less than 85%.  
---
as far as weight reduction instead of cards look for armor with it.. go for like unyeilding set with 2 peices weapon weight red, 2 with food drink and chem reduction, one with ammo reduction those would do more for you in the long run allowing you to use more defensive or offensive perks, and the points you put in evasive would be better spent in adrenaline. if you want to be a stronger ranged build DR on a "Sniper" is kind of pointless considering if they see you or can get to you, you are not doing your job right.
---
I am so bummed about this! Fingers crossed!
---
I can agree with those points, my hope is that legendary vendor coupled with player vending will not impact our hardcore traders too much, hopefully it will make a surge of 3* items since 1* will be scrib fodder
---
Aww man I'm about to launch a weeks long contest in which the ultimate prize is a full set of assassins sentinel marine armor. Don't kill the hype lol
---
They already have figured it out. It isn't even that hard to figure out.

Med kits, chem boxs, bathroom mirrors, and doctors bags. Scrounger works on ammo boxs and some duffle bags.
---
For the life of me I have no idea why anyone would choose to fast travel into WS Station or near the Golf Club when in survival mode.   There are so many choke points and open areas that even with the 10 second delay (or serious weapons/armor) you will likely get ganked before you can get a shot off.
---
I started scrapping all the Laser Sniper Rifles I came across to learn the mods.  With Rifleman or Comando perks you can get the damage up some.  I never found a silencer mod for them and couldn't make them work with my sneaky, sniper build.  They aren't worthless....but I was dissappointed overall.
---
Triangle for ps4
---
A couple months back I was transferring my X01 power armor to my other character by giving it to my friend to hold and it all disappeared (rip). I lost my jet pack and haven’t been able to find one since but that was mostly due to me only just coming back to this game yesterday after taking a couple month long break
---
I always wondered the same thing
---
cheeers
---
I can't imagine they can nerf it so bad that still wouldn't be a great prize lol.
---
Hey, never say never. I'm still bummed that Bethesda's shot at a Fallout set in the "south" (to most) was spent on West Virginia.
---
That's normal,  I've been playing since black Friday and I couldn't explore much areas further out than that until I was about lvl 45-60. If the going gets too hard power armor works wonders if you can build a nice set your level with calibrated shocks
---
Thanks for responding!
---
I added you many minutes ago, still nothing, but im not a griefer and don't resent you like that. Maybe you'll be inspired by my base with like 2 walls that pass through a solid object. 
---
The encouragement to build a base that is more immersive is that you avoided the exploitable bugs in code and now your budget is maxed.
---
Dane Cooks' brother didn't have to steal 12 million dollars from him but he did because the chance was there and it worked for a while. For example.
---
Lol got 600 steel this way
---
How do you figure out how to bypass a system that hasn't been implemented yet?  I guess I'm not quite sure what you're referring to.
---
What are your combat perks and what kinda weapons are you using? Are you solo or group? If solo and you don’t have lone wanderer on out that on.
---
I am currently lvl 124 and it doesn't matter how many stars they have I end up with the 1*'s of - Instigating Spear, (Robot whatever) Armor piece, A pipe pistol/bolt action rifle, an Auto Stim leather piece, or some other weapons that I will be going to the new vendor that is coming soon and into my Vendor DooDad at my camp. 
---
The only 2*-3* Items I have found are a 3* Bloody Power Fist (I don't use it), 3* Anti Armor Laser Gat, a lvl 20 2* Anti-Armor Exploding bullet small gat, 2* Trapper Chest Chameleon and Leather Leg, 3* BOS Combat Chest. I have found all of those before (except the Power Fist) by lvl 60, I have other multi * items but I have bought those.
---
Bethesda has started to walk on the right path recently. Not that it matters but I've heard several youtubers mention how the game is doing better.. so that's good
---
How do you reconcile your account with the information, provided by other commenters, that there is no way to obtain a second camera if you lose/drop/give away the one you find on the tourist?
---
By exploring, they’re in many places.
---
I personally think sneak is boring, but it is probably more realistic. There's 2 styles of pvp games.  PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds vs fortnite. Rainbow six vs. halo. The former being one shot kill games and the latter being more run and gun. 
---
However, the fact that giant power armor cannot even take 1 bullet, seems fake to me. If anything we should all start with PA and then once it gets broken, we switch out and fight with normal armor. Pretty much you cannot use PA in PVP and that's a shame. It's so iconic for fallout.
---
Creatures will still do damage, almost a guarantee.  I have a spawn point that generates high level enemies. So if I install a vendor machine and some Alpha Deathclaw generates because of customers and those customers don't kill it there is a possibility of damage to my camp.  My defenses should work but turrets are still unreliable in my opinion.
---
That would be absolutely terrifying.
---
Staggers are incredibly easy to do to an Ass/Sen. It's not immortality by any stretch of the imagination.  I don't understand how nerfing Ass/Sen would help mitigate the "1 shot fest" you've stated PvP happens to be right now.  I think it would actually make it worse..
---
Just play around with the perks too see what you like the most some perk cards are pretty obvious to avoid others will help once in a awhile really depends what you are going for. Try falloutbuild to see the the perk cards and know more about them.
---
I hope so
---
At least it wasn’t the monocle
---
I'm seeing a lot of mostly uselesss perks. Goat legs, tormentor, etc. And things like Ammosmith and Weapon artisan dont need to be on all the time, only when crafting.
---
Responding to a three month old thread. Lol k
---
It amazes me that a weapon that spits out a beam of light is one of the loudest weapons in the game. 
---
I mean wtf
---
Easiest way (assuming you're appropriately high enough level) is to get to the entrance of Whitespring and reload until it shows up.
---
The body will be on the red car right outside the main entrance, laying across the hood, just a few steps from where you load in.  I've seen him a number of times while server hopping WS.
---
Yea exactly I'm excited to go to others camps and to have company at mine. I'm definitely selling a lot of crap
---
Don't build a Turret camp at White Spring club house.
---
Early on I built my C.A.M.P on a junk pile it helped a lot with resources.
---
Claim workshops you will get plans and other items but don't keep any junk on you in case of griefers.
---
Get excavator power armor at level 25 I am a level 150 and still use it.
---
White Spring has a fountain in the gazebo that will cure all diseases. 
---
Pick your S.P.E.C.I.A.L points carefully cuz you have to wait till level 50 to respec.
---
Ask for help here there is a wealth of knowledge and the community is great.
---
You have a lot of perks that you don’t need to keep equipped. All your crafting and repair perks can be swapped out as needed. Also if your going for a rifle build. It’s best to put point into sneaking. As you’ll get double damage for ever hit. Get rid of iron clad and replace it with It serendipity. Replace weapon repair perk for nerd rage. Get rid of hard bargain and put on lone wonderer. You can swap over 10 of your perk cards out for better pve cards. You can always put your crafting cards on when your crafting and repairing weapons and change them back when your done.
---
Not gonna lie, I would give my lefticle for a Be double 😂, lucky find congrats
---
 Get rid of QOL perks for damage or vats perks. Swap them in when you need them.
---
Just toss ‘em a couple plasma grenades and they’ll have a blast!
---
No it's specific grenade explosive radius, grenadier helps mirv mod on fat man, auto grenade launcher but not explosive shot weapons.
---
Did they fix lever action rifle reload?
---
How often do you play?
---
Nerfing sentinel or cavalier would destroy them.  If one cant make an entire set effective then they have no point.
---
At this point there should just be one permanently pinned to the top of this sub.
---
I second this.
---
Now theres going to be a new sweeping epidemic of griefing and I call it poo bagging it. Its when you go onto of a player bed and leave some fertilizer in it.
---
Absolutely there needs to be progression of some kind, however the issues with sentinel assassin armor is the advantage is alot of things hours played can't control. If I want to play a non Vats sniper with non automatic rifles in PvP, that's just 100% not an option. I'm not even saying all builds need to be equally viable, just that no matter how long youve played, there is a point at which your advantage is too great, and sentinel I think is an example of that. No one wants your high end gear to be worthless, just less obnoxious.
---

---
"StOP GriEfIng ME!!!!11"
---
Everytime the squatch dies in the pond, it immediately disappears and we get nothing. Happened twice to me yesterday.
---
Hahaha. You still think they have control over this game. It's a monster - once built you just gotta stand out of its way and let it do its own thing.
---
I had a 2 shot launcher that broke after 5 shots or so XD I stopped carrying it shortly after I figured that out, would have loved to make a pure explosive build centered around that.
---
"Never trust a man who can only spell a word one way."    
---
\- Not Mark Twain
---
My recommendations; 
---
Add in 3☆ Bloody mess in LCK for an additional 15% dmg. Swap in super duper only when crafting.
---
Drop Fire in the Hole in PER, for 1☆ concentrated fire. This will let you focus on headshots and leg cripples for additional dmg.
---
In AGI, maybe consider taking Sneak and Covert Operative for the sneak bonuses? You don't need to keep home defense and ammosmith when not crafting.
---
It only works for people that are not flagged hostile to you. People claim workshops all day long without thinking about the dangers.
---
We will still be hearing these stories after Tuesday for sure.
---
It has been confirmed. When the wendigo came there were two quests. One for the mount one for the pie. Mount quest can be started picking up a paper at southern Bell motel
---
I just enable pacifist for that. But it seems there's a bug (wow really) where using the Tesla on enemies + players (on pacifist) kinda triggers the pacifists on enemies. Then none of your guns do any dmg... until you relog. *Noice!*
---
I did not know this thank you I will name my next born mikewoodsays ( symbolically at least) in your honor
---
I built my camp with a giant warehouse at the base that's missing all foundations except the outer one's that the walls are connected to, creating a big hole with exposed ground. I put my camp directly on top of a junk pile and can now farm crops, harvest scrap, and purify water all from the comfort of a completely safe bunker with a luxury home at the top :p
---
I'd be so happy to get planter boxes so I can build in crazy locations
---
                                  its ethernet not wifi 
---
will try a trace this week
---
There is room to bring them down from where they are without totally destroying their usefulness.
---
Okay, so that means if I have this with an M79 Grenade launcher, the DMG will spread out more and make it so I clear out more, correct?
---
I would take off Super Duper and all best in Bloodied Mess and Better Criticals. One point for each since you you’re looking to use vats and deal more damage. You can just switch those cards in and out with super duper when you want to craft something.
---
If you use a mod that actively breaks the game (duping items, crashing servers, things that give you a significant advantage (think aimbots, not that VATS is much different), you absolutely can get banned.
---
I haven't seen any mods like that, but I suppose it's possible.
---
Other than that, some mods seem a little bit iffy (but not much), like ones that highlight caps stashes/plans/etc.  Likely OK, not likely to get a ban without warning.  Others that reskin, make things higher resolution, or just make the game functionally easier to use (sorting mods, your perk manager, etc.) are unlikely to be an issue, and I'd bet Bethesda would let the modders and users know if they though things were over the line (as opposed to going straight to a ban).
---
So that assassin gamma gun I found is useful?! XD
---
You say its hard to make to lure a monster to a camp and make them destroy it instead of you but its actually super easy, tested it on friends camp 5 times. Trick is to lure a monster and jump on top of base with jetpack or marsupial. Monster then will randomly attack stuff.\*
---
\*Friend gave me approval to test it as I built him everything at his camp.
---
the one thing i dont undrstand about people in this game, is that there are a group of players who inconstantly post about how they hate floating bases because it ruins "immersion" and they arent based in reality
---
This is in the same game that we have 30 foot high Mirelurk queens, huge mutated bat scorchbeasts and robots with human brains in them.
---
BUT!   a floating house RUINS the reality of the world ! lol
---
makes no sense
---
Use the perception perk that lets you target limbs. The head is a limb. I only use one point in gunfu. Extra is a waste imo.
---
Found the turret farmer
---
Prepare to be disappointed in my CAMP, its literally a square box next to an acid extractor, adhesive farm outside purifiers and gennies outside and turrets on the roof. :P
---
Unless you don't use automatic weapons, unless you don't use vats. The reason these sets are popular is it forces your opponent to use a handful of things to counter you, rather than anything being able to do the job, even if poorly. 
---
Assassin sentinels forces a meta and playstyle a lot of people find frustrating in a game that is supposed to let you use whatever weapons or playsyles you want and at least be somewhat competitive. 
---
End of the day the power gap between the assassin sentinel sets and all the others is way too big, and reducing the high end is a good place to start, then you can also bring up the lower end. It's been mentioned before but power creep is an important thing to keep in mind, and flat DR like sentinels fucking reaks of it
---
It's when you add together Assassin, Sentinel, Dodgy, spamming duped canned coffee / halloween candy to keep your AP up, and Empath that you become immortal. "Just stagger them" isn't really a viable tactic. By the time you get a stagger, you're dead 10x over. Taking literally zero damage is just bad gameplay design - I don't care if it's situational, it's dumb. And it IS literally zero damage - I've tested with a friend, unloading a full 250 shots of my bloodied .50 cal that does 331 damage per shot unbuffed and his HP bar did not move at all. I also tried hitting him with my BE harpoon gun for 1800 damage in a single shot - did nothing while he was standing, one shot him while moving.
---
This is just my opinion of course. The most fun I've had in pvp was pvp without legendaries. Everyone is deadly, but you can take a few hits. It comes down to player skill and min/maxing your build at that point. 
---
I also hate that power armor is completely useless in pvp. You may as well be naked for all the good it does you. That's just stupid.
---
You running Berserker items? If not you should be! If you are on PC I have some you could have/use as I love Berserker and currently have over 110 of them stashed XD
---
I thought it was implied that they didn't make it, because right after she says, "I know because I saw it in a dream" which to me meant they didn't but she lying to herself to make her feel better
---
I agree. Some of these cards just need to be benched until their needed. There’s a great resource online for builds. I forgot what the url is, but if you go to google and type in Fallout 76 builds, you’ll find it. I used it to help me with my Bloodied Sniper build.
---
Yes
---
Who gives a shit about game balance when it comes to PvE? We all kill NPCs easily. Game balance adjustments should be applied to PvP because they affect players ability to compete with other players. 
---
Who cares if it take you 3 shots to kill a scorched but 1 swing of someone’s melee?
---
Maybe I should move my camp from it’s glitched spot so people can access it but...that’s too much work
---
As long as you're in adventure mode other players cannot do anything to you besides maybe earrape in area chat, unless you fire back. Though I play in pacifist mode.
---
as others said it's all RNG. 
---
One night i walked in and almost every 3rd SM was a legendary, with at least 3 3star legendaries. Then i went to harpers ferry and there were a few more. it was where i got my executioners explosive LMG with 15% reload speed. Then a nuke in WS yielded far too many legendaries, all crap mind you but i haven't seen a drop rate like that ever.
---
Awesome camp! Is it PC?
---
Full bloodied with perks/mutations I get 700-800 base damage with a BE lever, and 400-500 with a BE semi-auto handmade. I have several perk sets I run depending on circumstance.
---
I found her at the light house first try.
---
When i fly to ISS with junk on me, I'll walk over to an out of the way bush and drop it all before i start, scoop it up at the end
---
All the passive cards should have an extra slot for them... or something. Games literally unplayable if you don't have all the weight reduction cards. And there are like 7 of them...
---
ps4
---
The vending machines better be free fast spawn points or the shit show starts......
---
Relog
---
Added, thanks!
---
Honestly this thread has been pretty good. There's been like 3 people I obviously triggered but honestly that's pretty good.
---
Thanks for all the info here.. Helped take care of this much quicker that I expected..
---
Everything spawns at Macs Farm South of Watoga Station..
---
I highly recommend jumping on the farmhouse if you can..I made gathering them together alot easier.
---
Also remember it is a dead or alive challenge.. so just make sure you draw each of them into the same area before dispatching them.
---
Afterwards I tried to let 4 spawnlings munch of me to contract woopsies... 20 minutes later. no disease.. I got bored and gave up.. one more bugged thing for the list.
---
One day I'll get there. It took I think a month of playtime for me to get all the Fallout 4 achievements on the XBONE.
---
My gun is named Shooty McPewPew, so I'm kind of honoring them.
---
I haven't found Atomic Command yet, but I actively seek these games out and buy extra copies from players.
---
Most of them are found in random magazine spawns that take a loooong time to find. 
---
Grognak and the Ruby Ruins and Nuka Tapper are the only ones I have found in a static spawn reliably.
---
If you are into the Holotape games I run an arcade that does tournaments on PC on Thursday nights.
---
What’s getting nerfed hard?
---
I know the feeling, trying to unlock mods for my Lever Action and my Handmade as well as keeping them fed means I’m constantly on short supply of just about everything, even steel and that stuff is about as common as it gets. The only commonly used material I have tons of are gears and springs. My vender stand is probably going to be bulked gears, springs and cloth... due to the 2000  raw  cloth  I unwittingly accumulated while looting other materials.
---
He mentioned that at the end. But this isn’t an update video, it’s a video about the launch.
---
Nah, I'm a ninny so I run bloodied instead.
---
The faster you remove the threat the quicker is no longer a threat :D
---
The game has been very kind in this sense and handed me over a bloodied MMG and a bloodied power fist - which I haven't even 'broken in' yet.
---
Upload the picture to Imgur and share the link in a post and it should post the picture with it for us to see :p
---
I know this trick.
---
pls no patch, although it feels pretty cheap.
---
Gotta, thanks.  Looks like I just missed mirrors this time.
---
Westtek
---
Yep, I'm going to name my sniper rifle 'long pew'.  And long may it pew.
---
Thanks
---
If you have the bloodied power fist I’d buy that. I’m on PS4
---
Pretty sure Deathclaw Matriarchs are in the game, but they are just another variant of deathclaw.
---
Level 1 Lone Wanderer.
---
I've been focused solely on group dynamic perks. Faster healing, more healing, shared healing, revival, etc. 
---
Combat perks are mostly energy weapon focused (I know, energy weapons are underpowered, but... he's a mad Doc, he's gotta have a giant laser gun). I have a cryolator, and a gatling laser as well.
---
Back when they added biv. Bloodied got nerfed and laser rifles got a buff as well as heavy guns getting a durability buff. Depending on the laser, they can be pretty good. The only down side is durability did not improve.
---
Okay, That's really useful to know! Thanks! I thought it only effected thrown grenades!
---
I thought the scouting party story line you find from the Harper's ferry terminal was great. Hearing the holotape of the leaders wife and kids telling him he's a good father right before you hear him murdering people he knew before the war was rough
---
Haha! I was thinking of going ULTRA Squishy and using Adrenal REaction to run a low life Berserker. I may update with the results XD
---
I just remembered. Something not apparent with Unyielding armor sets is that you increase, a lot your Luck Stat. My character has base luck of 10 and sometimes he gets around 20 luck or so. That's just amazing to farm for Legendaries. I get lots of at least 2 or 3 start legendaries if i'm farming on the brink of death. I've found myself sometimes taking walks overencumbered on whitsprings and then doing runs to the vendors at 2 kms/h
---
Westtek or Glassed Cavern if you’re powerful enough to survive waves and waves of scorched.
---
this I have been saying this  just like d2 trade screen is all we need
---
I bought the tactical under armour.  But not by accident.  It looked cool in the pictures, but in the game it just looks meh.
---
Missed out on that epic gold and black power armour paint job =/
---
This is why I love the new imposter event. You're level 54, no PA, bloodied build and still bring 100lbs of junk with you??? Almost like they deserve to lose it.
---
I personally think so too, and my friend said he knew the gun was worth at least 15k, but I suppose the other thought he got a great deal since he offered the deal outright.  I appreciate someone putting a value of some sort on the costume, since we (my group) all have multiple sets and he just happened to have one in his inventory when they were trading and it immediately became the item the guy wanted.  Maybe I'll stop giving all mine away.
---
I have one?
---
Thank you so much. If I’m honest the community is the main reason I want to jump in. Everyone seems lovely
---
That's cool. I have a garden.
---
Yeah I’m getting tired of running around with Ammo Smith instead of Action Boy all the time.
---
Good on you for even knowing what that means!  (or at least being willing to google it to find out).
---
That used to be pretty near step one in figuring out game issues back in my day.  But then again, back then we had to deliver all the packets directly to the game server by hand on post-it notes &gt;.&gt;
---
Thank you :)
---
I see a huge red flag in your argument: duped.
---
I thought duping was a thing of the past, if it isn't how about they fix it first and once that is out of the way and there are no more duped consumables - if that is indeed the case - we look at what needs rebalancing?
---
Because from your post it is fairly clear what the problem is, and is not assassin or sentinel.
---
Welcome to the club.
---
Stale cookies, meaty meat, glowing ferns (for the vegetarians) potently radioactive hillbilly pop and liquor are all on the table. Help yourself!
---
Nah, ive said it before on my mod pages, im only working on 76 areas waiting for modding to come out. I dont plan on going somewhere with it.
---
Free pink eye for everyone!
---
Yeah this happened to me once on a failed event. Haven't failed afterwards on the next 50 events or so. If SBQ is being engaged too far from its fissure site or far outside its nuke zone, the event can bugged out.
---
With the amount of aluminum and steel it takes, its definitely not cheap lol
---
Or even a basic description.  Or a preview of the actual object instead of the literal plan.
---
The woman in the locker/cupboard/closet at morgantown.
---
I typically assume those low bounties are cap traps. Dudes get wanted on purpose and only lose 5 caps on death but if they get you they claim the full payout. That system needs work
---
I gonna say not really. It's super low on damage output. With the bullet sponges walking around the wasteland you need some damage output. 
---
15 strength is really good. Lots of room to choose different weapons. Shotguns, heavy weapons, and melee all play off strength for their primary perks. You've also got room for all the secondary perks for those categories. Perception for skeet shooter, and agility for enforcer. (Enforcer 3 is probably my favorite perk in the game) Intelligence for stabilized and luck for one gun army with heavy weapons. Dump strong back 4 and take at least one point of each card in a weapon damage family. Three level 1 cards is 30% damage, three level 3 cards (9 points) is only 60%. It's an efficient way to save points. Carrying multiple weapon families all the time is a short road to major disappointment. Less damage with more bullets leads to more ammo farming, more weapon repairs, more armor repairs because enemies die really slowly, etc. If you're running melee then carry one good ranged weapon and call it there. Incisor 3 is critical to any melee build. Best armor penetration in the game.  
---
Your perception should really be on more functional perks most of the time. Pick lock 1 isn't going to get you much, but glow sight in a nuke zone, concentrated fire 3 will. Fortune finder/Perceptibobble/pannapictagraphist is a cool combo, and bobble heads sell for a healthy amount. Once you've used one of each for the challenge, you can sell all the ones you don't need. 
---
Endurance is good. It leaves lots of room to play around. I like to make room for a maintenance perk like good doggy, or cola nut (cola nut is great). On top of that there's ghoulish for nuke zones, or fireproof. Day to day I use a couple points of solar powered and sun-kissed to keep healthy. Iron stomach, lead belly, and aqua-boy are all pretty meh. Radaway is plentiful, and there are much better endurance perks.
---
I think charisma 3 is a must so you can have hard bargain 3 when dealing with vendors. More Charisma means more caps from vendors too, so don't sell it short. Charisma also has a fist full of really handy perks that can justify a lot if you've got a team. Otherwise suppressor and tenderizer are the big ones. Field surgeon can be useful. There's really a ton to consider.
---
I'd move some points out of intelligence. 15 intelligence is disappointing to play. There's really not much in intelligence that's worth carrying around all the time. Lots of utility, very little pop. Maybe 8 points? Then you can run first aid 3 and gunsmith 5 if you want. Or sprinkle in power user, and batteries included. Power patcher is pretty much unnecessary. Power armor breaks amazingly slowly, even for front line fighters. If you play even a little smart, it's no worries.
---
Agility is awesome. Enforcer for shotguns, thru-hiker to ease your cola nut addiction (cola nut is great, again), action boy/girl if you're playing vats. Born survivor is great if you're tanking, gun fu for vats. Adrenaline for consistently increasing your damage. Sneak and escape artist are great for stealth builds, but that's not really the direction you seem to be taking here. Also, escape artist doesn't seem to be working these days. My poor stealth rifle character. White knight is ok, but if you're using power armor regularly it's not so useful. That's more up to your play style though. 
---
Crank up your luck to make room for starched genes and class freak. Mutations are just too good to ignore. Bloody mess is a must pick. Must. Pick. It's a 15% increase to your total damage, not your weapon damage. Best damage perk in the game. Works with all weapons, all the time. Then there's the utility of swapping in vats perks or farming perks. Pharma farma, can do, scrounger, and cap collector all serve a purpose when you're low on supplies. If you're brawling in the burrows then you can grab four leaf clover, better criticals, grim reapers sprint, etc.
---
Hopefully this helps you choose more of a direction for your build, without pulling too much out of it. Happy hunting!
---
I had the exact same problem a few months ago until I talked with a few of my friends and they helped me pick out some of my perk cards for a nerd rage build based around rifles and I've been really satisfied with how much damage I do during Pve encounters. I mainly use a lever action rifle with a hardened receiver for maximum damage and a TSE shotgun. In my opinion I would invest into the damage cards for whatever weapon you prefer using and the Adrenaline card as well. But if you choose a nerd rage build I would recommend using power armor that mitigates ballistic and melee damage. 👍

My character is always overloaded with junk because my stash is full and i don't want to toss any junk because i want to craft stuff to scrap to try and learn the mods.
---
Sorry XB1
---
I literally have no idea what your talking about. All I watch on YouTube is people getting hit in the balls and tutorial videos on how to fix shit.
---
Too bad I'm on PC, would like to take a dip into that pool :)
---
Gronak's Axe staggers, shotguns stagger, many different weapons do.  There is also the "Tank Killer" perk card.
---
There is more than one way to skin a cat.
---
Ahh good thinking ^*evil ^grin*
---
I guess that makes sense, if no one else is there that's reachable, they must just lash out in frustration (or the equivalent in 1's and 0's)

Shift perks for crafting etc
---
why? If *YOU* left the area, *YOU* went quest failed as well and the situation is a null.
---
Either stay and defend it, or move on and lose it once you are out of the area.
---
Yeah I *made* a few plasma cores thinking they were fusion cores.
---
These are good suggestions, plus if you're dying all the time, why not lean into it and get mysterious savior and revenant?
---
Not completely true my self and most of the people I play with have never resorted to here or any outside source to help with trading.   I have quite a few sought after items I will be putting for sale in the player vendor. Much easier in my opinion than creating posts about looking for or trying to sell.
---
A lot of these are situational and don't need to be equipped all the time. Lockpick, Happy Camper, and Power Patcher can be equipped when you need them.
---
Why are you wanting to use Bear Arms if you're not perking into heavy guns? Sturdy Frame also isn't really necessary with this build. You'll have plenty of carry capacity with max strength. Mod your armor with ultra light or deep pockets instead of this perk. I'd recommend looking into Blocker in Strength. It's very useful against super mutants and ghouls.
---
Most of your Endurance perks are unnecessary, imo, with the exception of Aqua Boy. Healing and food items are abundant and rads aren't really a big deal. Same applies to First Aid. Get Fireproof in Endurance and keep Aqua Boy if you really want it. It's kind of an open secret that most Endurance perks are pretty terrible. Fireproof protects you from explosions and scorchbeast sonic attacks, hugely helpful.
---
If you're going to be playing alone you absolutely want to max out Lone Wanderer. Less damage taken and AP refresh is great.
---
I'd recommend dropping Intelligence to 8 and picking Gunsmith or Makeshift Warrior to go along with Batteries Included.
---
Put some of those saved points into Agility, it will help with sneaking immensely. Consider a rank or two of Ninja or Covert Operative to increase sneak attack damage. You also want at least one rank and probably more of Adrenaline. It's great for boosting damage since you're almost always facing groups of enemies.
---
Definitely add Bloody Mess, it's straight 15% damage increase across the board. You always want that. Luck of the Draw is not great, imo. Invest in Weapon Artisan instead and only equip it when repairing.
---
Here's an older reddit post that went into depth
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9wrx8g/how_to_turn_off_depth_of_field_distant_textures/
---
Some things may have changed a bit, but it was helpful to me when I first started playing with the settings.
---
Hmmm yeah like other people are saying you have a bunch of QOL equiped. Your a rifle build? Lose the strength its all going into luck now. Add starched genes, and class freak if you need or research some mutations to help make you even stronger. Eagle eyes is a great start. Also add anything thats going to make you crit even more if that means taking off QOL cards so be it. Lose the grenade perk in perception. And add concentrated fire. Vats crit heads all day. You could throw some sneak in there for more damge and wouldnt hurt to max perception by possibly losing some intelligence but that depends alot on the weapon you want to use. I hope this helps some what 👍 i
---
I agree that players should consider holding off on putting their 1/2/3 star legendary (unused) items into the Legendary Exchange Machine, until we know what the "Scrip" is worth and what the mechanics are.
---
Second floor, there is a blue door with a terminal. It's easy to miss, I had to search it for a while
---
Man go check NMA if you want to see real butthurt in a constant state, from decade to decade :-)
---
I really want to, but I can’t get on today. So I just want to know if I’m about to be disappointed tomorrow. Lol
---
The reason it appears non legendary ghouls drop one star legendaries, is because the "diseased" tag overrides the legendary tag. It is a know bug that has been around since beta.
---
So your answer is hell no, but also yes...
---
Same. Level 100+.
---
Better criticals is a good choice. With 8 LCK, and no mutations, I would probably take 3☆ Bloody Mess, 3☆ Better criticals, and 1-2☆ Four Leaf Clover and maybe 1☆ in Grim reapers sprint or Serendipity
---
How did you submit a ticket? Everytime my friend and I tried it told us Microsoft deals with it. Like what options did you choose when submitting it?
---
I will look into those perks I am unfamiliar with them
---
We all been asking why since day 1, really hope they change it or add more variations.
---
We do blame the devs for including PvP in this game.
---
I'm cool with people wanting to RP as raiders...but this guy was fishing for pvp. I was on my level 33 &amp; didn't think of them out of place in Flatwoods, Just assumed it was a team  ....until both started crowding &amp; blocking my way that became annoying. Normally I've seen real higher levels in Flatwoods area being all nice &amp; dropping loot of for low levels. I was grateful to the 30 stims someone gave me yesterday at the church.
---
A pew is what the bench in a church is called.  A long pew is a long bench, basically.
---
Will team members be able to destroy your camp? I'm solo but accept random invites trying to get achievement for 20 teams. Because of this my camp is nothing more than the little machine that you place down.
---
It is, but I hadn't looted the corpses yet, because I got killed (right next to where the other player got killed). When I respawned and retrieved my dropped loot, I suspect I grabbed his instead?
---
I did, even closed the game and restarted. Still persists
---
Do you remember where you found it?
---
I strip down to nothing but a stupid hat, and follow them around EVERYWHERE for the next hour.
---
But isn't server hopping good? It's like an alternate take with different players and items?
---
Do you rapidly scrap your items? I heard that a possible cause is that if you scrap too fast, you actually open a secret hidden menu with every bit of loot that's not meant to be accessible.
---
I've been taking my time slowing down scrapping and so far for me I've not lost anything again (yet). But I can't say if this is a fix or sheer luck, as prior to me losing my stuff, I had it for a while already.
---
Here is the Power Armor Rifleman build i was using a couple of months ago:
---
[PA-Rifle SPECIAL](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=2f145fe&amp;d=p02pd2pk2pl2pp2l12lk2lv2lt2l71e80id0s10ih0i10sg0st0ao0a32ar2an2s70a03c72ic0&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=5c)
---
This was using the Gauss Rifle which breaks quickly, hence the one or two star gunsmith.  You also get double the bang for your buck with "Power User" as the gauss ammo counts. For upgrades, you want to use VATS matrix overlay in the helmet and Core Assembly in the torso.
---
I haven't played for a while (re-starting on the PC soon) so maybe somethings have changed, but this worked really well.
---
You’re right. As a rifle build, I think he needs more points in Luck to allow for that. If he can do what you’re advising, he’ll be good money.
---
Looking at the shop now... the war raider showing a 21hour timer.... the nukashine paint......... “drum roll please” ...... .... ... .
---
No timer (yet). You got time
---
&gt;If you are into the Holotape games I run an arcade that does tournaments on PC on Thursday nights.
---
That's awesome man, unfortunate I don't have a PC. Appreciate the invite though!
---
The only options are caps for atoms (not going to happen), or continually adding things to buy.
---
Evil me says start limiting things like junk and consumables, and start selling them more commonly in shops, but really that both takes away the supply *and* the source.  Maybe just take away stims drop and sell them more?  Not sure
---
Wow u went to the Nuka-Cola pageant lucky dog....
---
Generally, I’d rearrange as others suggest as well.
---
(1) Do not keep anything camp related active most of the time
---
(2) Take a hard look at your carrying capacity perks ... do you need them all? You may find the best for your points are BAndolier (1 or 2) and the armor weight reduction
---
(3) Blocker 3 in STR is good; probably far better than Ironclad 5
---
(4) I find that Fire Proof 3 and Sunkissed 2 are huge quality of life quirks. If you have Healing Factor, this greatly reduces your need for Stimpacks in most cases.
---
(5) Definitely Concentrated Fire ... 1 or 3
---
(6) Amen on Bloody Mess
---
(7) Take a look at Agility as well ... Gun Fu and Adrenaline are solid ... for a rifle build I think I probably would have minimum Action Boy 3, Gun Fu 1, Adrenaline 1. 
---
(8) You’ve got too much in
---
(9) If you are really using VATS, there’s the Luck Perk that resets your AP on a kill. Combine w/ Gun Fun, Adrenaline and you can head shot folks down then every 3rd or so get your AP back.
---
(10) Probably too much INT
---
(11) Lone Wanderer, unless you group all the time. The damage reduction is nice, but the AP refresh is excellent for someone like you.
---
(12) What mutations do you run?
---
Yea, kinda of wish they made all camp items immune to damage(only on adventure mode). Just because how easy it is to cause enemy to destroy a base without turrets, the easiest monster to get to destroy players bases I found so far is scorchbeasts. All damage they deal is AoE damage and if you can run into the building then the scorchbeast will destroy roof and walls easily.
---
Or it could be cause I already got it... 🤔.  In any case you got 21hours
---
Ah, the Southern Belle. Haven't done that yet. Thanks!!!
---
I didn't spend caps on the plan, but I did have it dropped.  If you're building a wooden structure, they're not too bad up against a wall on a balcony, for example.
---
lol well then you will be set then.
---
It is nice to save up a few low level legendary ites for the next x2 Xp weekend, that way an alt can level up in no time easy.
---
...I thought they were.
---
Heh, now I know what they are.  I'm gonna go get that plan.
---
This...is somewhat troubling.  If this turns out to be a common solution, Beth needs to know about it.  Good find in any event.
---
Played both builds and i'm playing this game since beta. I'll stick with my experience. Berserker is perfectly fine since you can use full health with chems. is a 50% damage boost for it, perfectly fine. 
---
They just need to nerf some armor leg mods, like sentinel and cavalier to fully balance bloodied.
---
Scrap your junk first.
---
Have a supply of cranberry cobbler, bobbleheads, magazines and other items that boost xp. Take over the munitions factory up north. Put down a bed to stay well rested, have your friend share inspiration. 
---
They then repair the vertbot pad. From the sneak position you shoot it 3-4 times to get damage on it and then you friend shoots it to destroy it. Nets around 280 to 350+ xp depending on bonuses. If you can get a good rhythm going you can continuously spawn verboten and take in the cp fairly fast. It just takes a ton of steel and aluminum to get to level 60. I
---
If I understand you correctly, you have sounds at Bethesda menu after logging in, then no sound for the character inside the game? If yes, I suggest looking up the sound setting inside the game (press escape for the menu). It could have been muted.
---
Also, I'd like to know the version of DirectX and its error message, and type of your video card and sound card.
---
The story of the FEV testing where the woman's son is taken from her and she's screaming and crying for him I couldn't even
---
Now i will have players leaving even more bags of random.stuff on my doorway and bed.  Getting so sick of those dang commie propaganda posters....
---
*Screws (no need for a possessive apostrophe as that is the plural) 
---
*scarce
---
Basically just consider it as not actually being equipped. The only reason the game doesn't actually unequip it is so that you don't have to re-equip it when you exit the PA. If you're always in PA (like I am, unless I'm using a workbench) then there's really no point to use armor at all.
---
I've picked up a ton of great stuff from vendors so I always check the main ones, Whitespring, Watoga, Harper's Ferry, etc. Hopefully the legendary vendor will be reliable for good stuff. You can also check the trading subreddits
---
Other than that it's just farming. Whitespring, West Tek, Harper's Ferry/Burrows. I've also had decent luck finding legendary enemies just wandering up and down the main highway that runs from the Mire to the Bog.
---
I can already make enemy mobs destroy player bases. Its super easier especially if you have marsupial and jetpack. But yea workshops will still be a easy way to force pvp plus once vendor update hits we will know where their camps are at if they selling stuff.
---
The interaction required to do that is worth the less thru the vending machine imo. I don’t always have time to watch bid wars and meet with people. I’ll lose 2.5k caps to put 22.5k in my pocket with zero interaction with others and I can just keep playing my way.
---
Well there's still a little hope for Whitespring then!
---
I remember seeing something about the whitespring one but I was mid mission, I’ll check it out and start stacking for that legendary vendor
---
You and [This player](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a16ju6/dont_make_the_same_mistake_i_did_plan_small_pew/) should meet!
---
For clarification it should be the “Long Pew Pew!”
---
Eh.  It's a word that's slowly becoming old fashioned, I think.  I know it only because I read a lot of old fiction.  I remember being confused and having to look it up as a teenager.
---
Damn you're fucking toxic. We delete comments because we actually don't care about the karma, but also don't want a little red message of someone just being annoying. If anything it gives harassers like you more of a platform to be hateful, as expressed here.
---
Seems like I remember that being a bug in fo4, so not surprising it is happening in 76 also.
---
Can you clarify?  Does one simply need to leave the vault or rediscover all of those places on the new character?
---
Same. I gave up and deleted them
---
Yeah training mobs into a base will absolutely still be a thing. Probably more now than ever.
---
I've only just hit level 50 and I've been getting by with a level 25 Laser Gatling. Burned through so many fusion cores but it's carried me for 25 Levels.
---
Yep.
---
Or you can say 'horses for courses'.
---
Is not black or white, either/or.
---
Is playing PvE with self crafted gear feasible? Yes.
---
Is playing PvE with legendaries more efficient? Yes
---
So, currently is up to the player to make his/her own fun.
---
Ultimately if you 'cut out the middle man' with legendaries by being less tethered to resource limitations - you kill faster so your equipment degrades slower and you need less consumables - you are just left with doing an endless loop looking for better legendaries. That is it.
---
Or, you start making up stuff, like I am currently doing. 'how well can I do with no armor at all'.
---
Well, then all will just go PA + Melee with 200% repair...
---
[A more recent](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ai6o3t/pc_useful_ini_settings_everyone_should_check_out/), but not sure about enhancing visua settings. I tried some of the settings, and I'm working to make the settings work, but there's [also this wiki page](https://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Fallout_76)
---
Wish they’d remove the tapes we’ve already completed. Hate having them all for no reason and being forced to scroll thru them. QOL Bethesda. Never any QOL
---
Crouch, get off the map, and don't loot the dropped bag.  *Really* leave them wondering.
---
I sat above Red Rocket mega stop over the weekend a few times, waiting for someone to try taking it over (though I probably would have died, I'm not that much of a PvPer).  But no one even stopped by, other than to wave and walk through.
---
Issue is that this was nerfed already , and they effed up and unfixed , people that noticed stood quiet ,I know I did my shotty was taking down the sheepsquatch in a few shots ...
---
Hopefully they nerf explosive bloodied Lazers
---
Maybe you had been carrying something he thought was more valuable than what he had and just let you keep his stuff instead?
---
I have an abundance of springs, screws, and gears because I obsessively collect all of their junk pieces.
---
Yeaa i know you dont NEED one but its nice to have :)
---
I could see making stim sales for caps and removing them from event rewards to help. But yeah, something drastic needs to be done if it is desired to keep caps as a functional currency.
---
Took a while but it came up again.
---
I spent so many perk points trying to tame this doggo and give him a good home, super sad he's up there on his own.
---
Also ... herbivore is quite nice. Generally better than carnivore.
---
Not many people know that the revenant perk will proc when you self revive using mysterious savior or life saving armor.
---
I'm finding it's very contextual though - most of the time roaming around the world nothing can kill you so it never procs. The only things that are strong enough to kill you are SO STRONG that you get gibbed and can't be revived. Like during the sheepsquatch or Encrypted or Scorched Earth events. I feel a little ripped off.
---
If you talking about turrets camps then yes and only if enemies has a ranged attack but if you have regular mobs like Bears, ghouls, and even enemies with range attacks they will not be able to defeat turrets unless scorchbeast attacks them.
---
Slander Slander....can only get you so far. :)
---
Feel you there. Just spent some actual cash on some Atoms with the intent of getting the nuka power armor... Got distracted and started browsing round the other new items, when I accidently tapped "A" twice on the lighted letter set...
---
Not a happy boy right now lol.
---
Or just text chat...this is like the 10th emote request post you guys need to stop just ask for text chat will solve everything
---
Next: griefers use camp placement to enrage players. like placing turrets right by V9 so the queen won't land. And of course the ever-loved classic rocket turrets at the golf club.
---
I did not care about drops since i have enough "godly" weapons &amp; armor...BUT i have to agree its getting fucking booring to see these shitty 1* drops.  From about 10 3* enemies max 1 is a 3* drop.
---
You didn't even see the message and just listened to this person named "literaltrash69"
---
Hilarious at best. (it's not at its best...)
---
I encountered 2 players like that and managed to kill both before they did too much damage
---
Problem is you can't barter which will scare people off. Ive been a trader for months and months. Dealing with randoms in world is very unpredictable. Ive never sold anything to a random for more than 5k. It seems thats the threshhold where they start getting spooked. If you have a gun in there for that much it will sit in there for a long time.
---
I was [referencing this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcQEWGjDS2o)
---
Awesome! Where on the map is this?
---
What do you do after the main mission? I have to launch a nuke right now but I'm holding off on it because I use a lever action build that does not enough damage for big monsters.
---
FYI, on FO76map.com there's a filter for power armor that will show possible spawn locations.
---
If I put my BE lever for 25k I can guarantee you it’ll be gone after a few visits. Certain items sell themselves. Obviously gotta list prices that make sense for them to sell.
---
Easy to comment after and put words into my fingers. Sorry that not liking exploits is toxicity in your city.
---
I think the real draw of bethesda fallout is not the main story itself but how it tells hundreds of stories with world building. And to that end, this game does not dissapoint. Exploration is still very rewarding.
---
my solution: make any camp invulnerable if it has no turrets. Place a turret- now it can all be damaged.
---
I've found at Top of the World in different magazine spawns around the raider flea market (what I call it lol) and a couple of times at the shack next to Whitesprings that has a few super mutants chillin in it. Also has a mod spawn.
---
They generators will pump out 8/hour, but they only hold 3 at a time so you have to empty it every 20 minutes or so.
---
Yeah, my CAMP os built on an acid node, and the extractor holds a whopping **10** acid at a time. I get 10-30 acid from it a night, depending on if I remember to harvest it.
---
It's more of a novelty, than an actual useful resource.
---
Yea....that person really tries some slander because the comment is gone, then the post is gone. They can put whatever words into my mouth as they want and it will mean nothing. I hate exploits and literal trash people.
---
A good suggestion, thank you!
---
We'll see if it works. 
---
&gt;we made an Adventure Mode change to prevent you from taking attack damage from players you are not hostile against (a.k.a. “slap” damage).
---
Yesterday I got killed four times at the train station by some guy whom I did not return fire against. So they basically said they removed slap damage, but there's some way people are exploiting it like dude did with his TSE Shotty.
---
I have played since Beta too, so what?
---
Full health in this game means nothing. It's all about the Legendary effects. 
---
Bloodied is risky too, but it has all the advantages that Berserker doesn't, *and* it provides a much better damage bonus.
---
So no, Berserker isn't fine.
---
Agree 100%. I love this game, I’ve been playing since BETA. I am almost always in adventure mode so I’m glad to see the recent addition of Survival for those who dig that kind of thing. But I’ll be glad for the day when Adventure is balanced out more and Survival is balanced so people can actually have fun. 
---
I’ve seen griefers back in Adventure mode because they don’t like Survival and that sucks. I’ve played Survival and even though I’m high level and have good weapons I get one shot killed. That sucks. 
---
The game needs to be: Adventure mode is “Fallout with your friends” and Survival is straight up PvP but without the ability for one-shot kills.
---
The boy who gets kidnapped from the water park, and eventually gets free and nakes it home to find everyone is gone and he is all alone.
---
Where is the missile silo exit (on the map)? I’ve never been able to find it but have always wondered where it would be
---
Im sure it wont always be amazing but as far as im concerned if i get 50 good hours out of exploration and questing, i would say its a good buy!
---
Not weapon upgrades, perks. Melee can do insane damage with the right build. 1000+ damage in a single shot
---
found the griefer.
---
Good point, tonight will probably be the biggest Camp attack grief-fest ever!  I'll pray for the "Your camp cannot be placed".
---
I think a pinned "Newbie Tips" thread would be awesome.
---
On one of my first days playing, a level 150+ came up to me, used the "Follow me" emote and led me to his camp full of food and water, and crafting benches. He PM'd me saying "feel free to use whatever you need" and then waved goodbye when I left. 
---
Nothing major, but things like that are what I had envisioned when I first heard the game was going to be multiplayer.
---
Fair to say. No one can ever know from a random player trade what each players situation is. People just putting a price on the costume has been very helpful as far as I'm concerned.  At least I know I probably should quit just giving them away in the future.
---
Interesting how it’s usually the same assholes who aggressively tempt fate who usually think the world is owed to them on a silver platter. Karma is alright sometimes.
---
Like how someone figured out how to kill you with slap damage? Some dude was doing it to me yesterday, I never returned fire and yet he still killed me.
---
In my mind I imagine it as the room in the Matrix with all the guns.
---
What perks could I invest in to do such a thing? I usually use the super sledge
---
diffidently should be part of the game, i do not use the mod myself but i will say swapping around cards is about the most aggravating things in the game. I can not remember the last time i picked a lock. gotta fix my guns and make ammo lets move around 6 cards then back again.... oops forgot the supper dupper card well i guess i'll go back out for more lead for the next 2 hours.
---
Are explosive bloodied laser weapons that good? Compared to explosive bloodied handmade
---
That keypad with a public code... Isn't that just pointless?
---
How do you turn pacifist mode on? I’ve never done it
---
I have a legendary quad capacity that I made into a fully automatic with beam splitter. Does 55 damage per shot and fires same rate as gatling laser. Takes down scorched beasts pretty well and ever since the energy weapon ware fix last patch it is usable. Only thing is that it burns through fusion cells like crazy so I stock up on ammo after time then around 4k rounds I'll keep it handy. 
---
I have a anti armor plasma gatling as well that I use often.
---
I dont really know what im doing tbh. Right now i am just using what weapons I can get. One thing that I dont love is how weapons are tied to levels
---
I haven't caught one in the wild yet, but if you spot a standalone foundation with a light and some posters, it pretty much means you're welcome to come in, just don't be a jerk.
---
I think Mr. Krabs had the right train of thought: dont bring something with you that you aren't prepared to lose.
---
Are Holotape Games random spawns?
---
I really can't recall. I want to say it was somewhere towards watoga, I spend alot of time in the mountains in between Charleston and the watoga area. 
---
Are you on XB1? I'll be happy to give it to you.
---
Power fists can be OP.  
---
Bloodied build may get you in 3 or 4 hits, the piercing mod will destroy your power armor and stagger you as well.
---
Again my post was about hating exploits.
---
There is another example of a floating base...this one primarily floating foundations you can't even access without a jetpack. Tell me how this doesn't affect gameplay, especially in survival where your camp is supposed to be a defensive position. Tell me I'm a dick and that someone else puts words into my mouth.
---
Right now I have a friend I play with who I wait to do the main story with. So far so good with that! I do exploration on my own and we team up for the story.
---
I got you. Right now I have a brick camp so if I switch back to a wooden structure I'll consider them. Thanks again.
---
He's speaking in #pcmr
---
It was likley a legendary like bloodied rather than a mod.
---
"You are addicted to Achievement-Hunting"
---
Noooooope. =(
---
i like this idea but i just want the machine to be able to hold alot at once, the only reason i build so many water purifiers is because they only hold 5 at a time and this goes for the resource gatherers at workshops buff the amount they hold.
---
"Once you play the game theres nothing new" yeah I think that is most games.
---
Map &gt; Settings &gt; Game &gt; Pacifist
---
Had that guy, but a TSE shotgun. rushes to each legendary and wone-shots them before anyone can get a hit in.  Just walked out, no point in being in the event with that asshat around.

Don't panic too much dude, it's all going to be broken when it gets updated tomorrow anyway.  
---
Playing the vanilla game is bloody awful after running with mods!
---
It took me about 2 hours to go from one tourist location to another. Server hopping may be faster, I don't know, I just used the opportunity to re-explore areas for loot. I found mine by the generals statue.
---
You can access them from the map or the map menu. You can select each one to see the progress you've made...7/9 Robot Pics will show you the ones you need to get the challenge and what you've done for example.
---
You need to trigger them again. [From our help site here](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/43906/kw/achievements);
---
&gt; If there is an *achievement*/trophy for a quest, such as leaving the Vault, that you completed during the B.E.T.A., you will need to use a new character to earn that *achievement*.  *Achievements*/trophies for things like building a C.A.M.P., crafting a weapon, or destroying a number of things should unlock when you do those things.  
---
So for example, say you collected 200 junk in the beta but never got the achievement, you would need to make a new character, pick up one piece of junk and the achievement would unlock.
---
Blocking them from the social menu doesn't stop them from using the console messaging system. You'd have to block them on PSN for that. Not sure about XB1.
---
West Tec + scrapper = 250 plus steel in just minutes. 
---
In fact anywhere with a high concentration of supermutants. Assault rifles break down to 19 steel, pipe guns to 6-9, sledges 6. 
---
The penitentiary in the toxic valley is a nice one because there's work benches all over it plus some weights in the yard.
---
Ty❤️
---
Agreed. I’d like to see more workshops similar to the bullet factory or power core generators. Unique areas that provide unique resources. It is much easier to do a resource run through a location than to take a workshop, avoid the pvp, and come back every hour to clean them out. Not to mention there are so many resource nodes scattered around the map you can build your camp on.
---
I was having trouble with adhesive until I was guided on building a farm. Makes me happy to see so many helpful players in game. 
---
I cant remember his name but this one guy also saw me withing at Whiteslrings and motioned to follow him. He gave me a legendary gold club with the ghoul slayer effect on it.
---
Yes! I'm a creeper when it comes to peoples camps, I love to look around and appreciate their decorating style. I recently had someone shit on my camp just to be an asshat, so I've been nervous when players come close to my base. I'm excited for this change!
---
Omg this didn't even occur to me; selling all the clothes for ballistic!
---
You made sure to message me about how you were raped and your family were raped after you put these words into my mouth. I don't care about you or your past, since your present is pathetic and annoying.
---
 I delete posts to avoid literal trash people wasting my time with messages. One day you'll realize that slander isn't working.
---
Frames are under photos.
---
IIRC, Options, then triangle gets you to photomode.
---
Because the shopping plaza is super convenient while in Survival mode.  All the crafting, merchants, and Stash access, all right there.  While trading or crafting, you usually have pretty good visibility of anyone running by, and there are lots of little places to hide and take cover.  
---
Usually the people looking to murder are busy at the train station where they have them in an open field with no cover nearby.  Also, I've seen camps built into the electrical tower there and they have an amazing snipers nest for that area. I have speed demon and I can manage to run away when spawn camped there 1 out of every 3 or 4 tries. 
---
Which is why the Train station usually turns into a meat grinder.  My usual strategy is to finish Uranium Fever and then head towards the shops while avoiding the station by circling south.
---
I've got a similar char that uses a cryolator and gatlin plasma so some perks in heavy weapons will help but that requires strength. Power armor is very useful for this sort of build while out solo as they tend to be a bit squishy. This is an awesome build for events like Encrypted as the healing perks mean you can hold 3 pylons no problem and a cryolator is the imposter's worst nightmare.
---
What if you could make your camp a mission. Have an access door that requires a four digit code. The owner of the camp gets to choose any two fallout quests where at the end of each quest the player opens a safe and gets a two digit code. After completing both quests to get the full code they access the locked door and enter the camp. Then the player goes to the vending machine to collect the loot the camp owner stashed for the reward.
---
I do the same thing when it comes to crafting materials in my stash, though I've upped it to about 350-400 for things like wood and steel, then everything else at 50-150 depending on how often the materials are used for repairs.  When I am over those numbers I bulk down to them, sell the excess, and stop gathering those materials for a bit though, and if I'm even close to my carry weight limit I find a stash ASAP.  
---
I've even taken it further in survival mode, only carry 10 stimpacks, 10 diluted stimpacks, 2 rad-x and diluted, 2 rad-awa and diluted, then just my food and water.  My stash usually hovers around the 600 mark
---

For the salute emote, you have to "expand" – you have to press of the shoulder buttons, the on-screen display will say which one – the emote wheel when you have the default greeting (the hand wave). You can select either as the default at that point. Also, I believe you have to equip the emote first in the Atom Shop.
---
The tricentennial frame should appear as one of the photo mode frame options.
---
Ballistic fiber is why I'm one of the only Mothman followers left.
---
Who pays for weapons? I seem to get lucky and find everything I need.
---
Started playing a few weeks ago. I am lvl 68ish with 76 hours played last night. I have not seen a single 2 or 3 * legendary so far even though I have killed them countless times including 2 SBQs and dozens of sheepsquatches.
---
I’m not sure of the PS4 buttons but on Xbox you find the emote by bringing up the emote wheel then hitting RB I think to “expand” and then you can select between the default greeting or the tricentennial one using the thumb stick as with any emotes you buy from the atomic shop, but basically just look for the “expand” option and you should see it
---
isn't it W00by?
---
Yes , you could potentially make a lazer weapon hit a rof of 99...
---
Pretty devastating in the right hands , opposed to the handmade you could only make it higher rof at the cost of damage , even with the right cards lazer is god

---
Not allowed.
---
Might try the trading subs. I will warn you tho, the plans are highly sought after and usually go for an outrageous amount.. Just get someone to put the mods on for you. Most people do it for free. Just my opinion tho. Good luck!
---
i thought this sub regained their consciousness back a while ago. Glad to see that they actually didnt, my supply of salt is short.
---
I don’t run a melee build so there are others more qualified to to recommend something. There are several posts on Reddit dedicated to those builds, just need to do a bit of digging.
---
And then you kill a random regular ghoul that drops shit like hunter’s lead pipe
---
Some guy gave me a TS laser rifle and zealot fatman. Some other guy gave me power fist and missile launcher plans. But the best was when some guys came to my camp, gave me and my friend items and took photos.
---
Guy Fawkes and the Burners
---
Are you talking about where to buy emotes that you don't have? Or how to use an emote in game?
---
From the main menu, go into the Atomic Shop, from there you can buy stuff for ATOMS, including emotes. You can buy ATOMs from the PS Store and also earn them in game for completing Challenges. The Challenges section is accessed from the in game menu, just hit your options button to get there.
---
As to emotes in game that's on your directional pad. I forget off hand if you need to press up or down, but one accesses emotes and the other accesses your favorites wheel.
---
Follow the road from The Overseer's Camp to Flatwoods, it's where the next line of quests will take you. Take your time and get used to things.
---
I'm on PS4 usually later in the evening after 6 or 7 CST and can help you out with some supplies if someone else hasn't yet.
---
My PSN is the same as my user name here.
---
By the frame are you walking about a Power Armor Frame? Those spawn randomly in specific locations and once you have cobbled together a full suit (lowest level is 15 for PA pieces) you can then modify your power armor at a power armor workstation and ass paint to it, in this cast Tricentennial paint.

....Another one bites the dust.....
---
Gods I hate that. Wasted about 200 plastic bulking up excess to sell.
---
Days of scrap farming to build reserves and replenish cash. finally ending with multiple crazy-cat high school runs for the plastic. Bulked everything I was going to sell over the next couple of days. chatting with a friend in game, forgot I had not sold or stashed yet and scrapped as I always do before heading out. 
---
Just stood there a bid, sobbing quietly.
---
I’m starting to think Lucky would work better as an armor effect, but then people would make it even more mandatory and it wouldn’t have a major downside like when put on a weapon.
---
Hmm, I’d still like a way for legendary drops to get boosted in a way, but It could cause problems if on a gun... maybe a consumable earned through faction rep? bought with caps as an additional cap sink?
---
Cap sink *and* faction rep sink for 10 minutes of chance of double legendary drop? What do you think?
---
No.  Because they are not particularly effective as it is.  I get killed all the time even in PVE with a complete unyielding/Sentinel set.   Any further reduction in effectiveness make them worthless—weapon weight reduction would be superior at that point.
---

---
If you’re on console maybe try to hard reset it
---
I hate when people know they can one shot and do it anyways. I know that if I use my auto TSE handmade, I down enemies really quick. Even with my no legendary combat rifle, it's the same way. Which is why I will bash a legendary or make sure to hit with only one round, wait for everyone else, then go ham on them. My group while protective and supportive of each other and focused mainly on just us, we will also  make sure others get their pay and gear as well.
---
Thanks - must've grabbed the chassis when I found a station.
---
Shotguns will do pretty nuts damage. I keep a steady supply of booze and chem and at the moment I do 1241dmg. So I should be hitting around 993dmg after patch if I did my math correctly. And honestly I'm more than ok with it. It will force more close quarters encounters if you want to use your weapon at its full effectiveness. Which, shotguns are made for. Its cool to one shot stuff from long rang with a shotgun. Buy thats not what they are used for. So putting them in line is great! And you can still do amazing damage. All you have to do is get closer and you will 1 to 2 shot most everthing still if your playing your cards and buffs right.
---
I think the issue with higher end weapons/gear is random players will be less likely to pay market value for them.
---
I'm mostly expecting to sell bulk ammo and junk.
---
No, you didn't.
---
I'm excited, but also a little apprehensive. Personally, I'm going to wait a day or two to throw my best stuff up on the vending machine to avoid any potential bugs/exploits.
---
&gt; IMO, bulking should ALWAYS reduce weight,
---
Or at least work out the same for things that do not reduce. A few items result in a net increase in weight for scrapping. bulk item weighs more than the individual items plus the 2 plastic to bulk them.
---
Wow indeed. That's amazing
---
You said exactly what i am thinking mah guy !!!!
---
I cant wait to chrck out other peoples camps and for fellow vault dwellers to vome to mine. 
---
Have spent alot of time on my current csmp since they anounced this patch . 
---
AD VICTORIAM !!!
---
You can be salty the first time you get spawn killed at a train station, but if you keep coming back and keep getting killed, that's all on you.
---
I'm just glad to see you were a "Phoenix " after all Frito.
---
Thank you much.  I understand now.
---
In addition to the viewing all the challenges in the various categories in the "Challenges" menu, you can also choose specific ones to track on-screen on your map. It does eat up screen real-estate (upper right hand corner) on the map though, so you probably don't want to track too many.
---
Huh, thanks for the info!
---
The powered doors are so dumb. Why would you want a keypad on the the inside??? Obviously players are going to want these to lock their doors but the only way to do it is to have one dumbass looking wall facing the other way.
---
I'm pretty stoked. I have my wasteland bar ready to go.
---
Not use power armor and use a fist weapon.
---
Same thing happened to me..
---
Encryptid event:
---
850 lead
---
900 steel
---
Misc shit above 100.
---
Why would you bring that shit to an event where health drains fast as a mf. Well their loss? My gain.
---
I would suggest putting one point in each, regular, expert, and master, as it will give you the most damage for the least amount of point allocation. 1 point in each gives you +30% as apposed to only 15% if you maxed one all the way. I would also suggest incisor rank 3, it ignores 75% of enemy armor, and the one that increases swing speed, I cant remember the name right off hand. My build is set up to allow me to use any of them as I desire, I just switch out the ones I want. I mainly run a unarmed build though. twisted muscles and talons are important mutations also.
---
In theory this works. In reality the guy who wants that BE but isn't going to pay 25k is going to get mad and destroy your base. This is what wi'll happen more often than not. Youre going to set yourself up to get griefed.
---
I wound up teaming up with a nice guy last night and we did the burrows run, which is way better with a partner, lots more enemies. Anyways, I died at one point and had a ton of loot on me once we found each other, he leads me back to my bag. One of the most enjoyable team ups I've had so far. Before we started he bought some .308 ammo from me so when we were done I dropped the rest of it I had for him. Lots of fun.
---
Same. my melee tank switches to a shotgun. My bloodied heavy gunner hits the rad shower (and maybe switch to smg if needed). You know you one-shot, so it is pure selfishness to do it.
---
I just keep mine in storage anymore. People seem to think it's just the epitome of wit to destroy them.
---
And how to get this mutations?
---
What was nerfed....shotguns or exploding effect?   What do you think will be affected with the upcoming patch?
---
Yet it breaks in 300 shots vs 20k for an ak.
---
Speaking about carrying items if you are killed twice by mole miners, ghouls etc before picking up your junk does it disappear? I’ve had this happen numerous times if I die once then die again trying to reach junk bag. All my stuff disappears
---
In my experience, a mob with a ranged weapon (especially you *#$&amp;(*# muties with rocket launchers) generally are out of range of my turrets.  I never experimented with different turret types though, straight from basic to missile, maybe some have better range.
---
It’d be nice if they also made certain perks passive, such as perks that allow you’ve to repair items beyond 100% condition, the perk that makes fast travel cost 33% less caps, the one that decreases/eliminates rads from eating and drinking. It’s annoying that I have to switch to perks like this just to benefit from them when I already have the perk unlocked. There isn’t even a possibility of this type of system being abused so it doesn’t make sense why they don’t do it. Just makes the game more tedious and adds to the list of frustrations...
---
I’m gonna sell a ton of plans. Furniture, a couple of power armor plans, and recipes. And sell legendaries that I don’t use
---
Holotape games are mostly random magazine spawns. A couple are on fixed terminals, but the majority are from any old magazine spawn. Basically, they are magazines with a covermount holodisc
---
You don't even have to farm it in camp, it's *everywhere*!  Duct tape, military grade duct tape, packets of duct tape... not to mention wonderglue and so forth.  Appalachia is basically held together by duct tape and glue.
---
But yeah.  Screws are my eternal annoyance.
---
There are assholes in this game. Not everyone, but they're there. THis happened to me yesterday. I had been looting a very high-level area because I desperately need supplies and a level 101 spawns in the area causing all the enemies to respawn suddenly. This is against all etiquette us players follow. We wait our turn in a few areas. The high level runs past me to loot everything on my way through the building. I do all the work but I get overwhelmed and die. Then said 101 grabs my 50 lbs. of junk. I'd say 20 screws, tons of much needed plastic, the whole bit. 
---
So I'm just left sitting there full of anger realizing that Bethesda perpetuate this kind of feeling. There are a few mechanics in this game that serve no honorable benefit to others and can only cause someone on one end of the stick to feel completely hopeless and enraged. I've considered ejecting my disk on several occasions and throwing it in the trash. You spend a lot of time in this world and it becomes important to you. 
---
I love this game but I don’t have any respect for Bethesda anymore. I use to defend this game but I won’t anymore. It’s more than the aforementioned thing that happened to me. It’s the money hungry and flat out lies that have given me this perspective. Every bit of criticism this game has received isn’t true but it is deserved.
---
Oh! That's good to know. I guess I'm just going to have to keep spawning into the same location
---
Only thing I refuse to deal with anymore are scorchbeasts. They're not even fun, just annoying sponges that eat up my stims. They're not challenging in any way, and kind of cheap since their attacks can go through walls and they often fly out of reach of VATS/ normal weapons for a while.
---
Wouldn’t matter all mag spawns are random. Look up the watoga spawns and you can find like 6 mags in a few mins. All RNG
---
I'm on xb1 never team up and always drop massive amounts of plans or ammo in the overseer's camp or watoga station. I would like to find a better sniper weapon though. I just have the lvl50 standard one. I don't have any * weapons beside the dragon and all rise.  Oh and I always leave a drink in a Dropbox 😝
---
All mags are random
---
Its just for fun. The keypad is to entertain me not to block players from using the benches and purifiers.
---
Be kind everyone.  This is very easy for people to miss if they haven't used these perk cards before. You get so accustomed to looking at the normal container inventory box, it's easy to miss the Search option at first.
---
Thx for the correction.  Edited post to reflect same
---
That would be great for mags but I really want the games.
---
Tbh, when I post, I post things that I notice in-game that would be interesting to have for my player. I ONLY do so because I know for a fact that Bethesda uses reddit to crowd source opinions and ideas on currently released content, as well as ideas about what players would like to see in the future (by which I mean they want to know what to sell us next). With this in mind, i like to break down these things i think of into funny little blurbs on this subreddit in the hopes that they might catch one of my ideas and implement it in the game at the cost of A.T.O.M. points. So I'm actually giving Bethesda exactly what they are hoping for: a funny little story that shows them something that they COULD potentially make some money off of that they can make for players to continue enjoying their game. And since I have 240 upvotes atm, I'm thinking I'm not the only one who would throw down some duckets for painted walls. Thanks for your reply, I appreciate your opinion. 
---
P.S. painted walls isn't exactly something I would say I'm "in depth" about as you put it, I just thought it might be kinda neat. Closed mouths don't get fed, but the squeaky wheel gets the grease yeah?
---
Note: I am not breaking any rules like duping or whatever. Wouldn’t know how if I wanted to.
---
Since you seem to know how the math works, can you explain how perks like Dodgy, Blocker, and Serendipity stack with sent armor?
---
what kind of Recipes?
---
Bloody mess in Luck gives +dmg across the board
---
A question I have and I'm hoping someone can answer this. Does this mean everyone can build their camps in WS and completely ruin that area for people looking for legendary weapons?
---
Had my camp destroyed because I wouldn’t  sell this dude a map.
---
I'm probably gonna sell fusion cores, and run some really good deals on high end guns since I have max caps on 3 accounts I'm gonna have fun with this.
---
Yesterday I got a +40% swing speed executors power fist and it is dumbly overpowered at level 45.
---
I may have a spare addictol if you need it! JK awesome job!
---
You don't think "rug"/ "modern chair" is descriptive enough?! Even if there was a Reddit master list that was easy to reference, the game is terrible as far as descriptions go.
---
Aim for the weak spots! Vats helps. Heads on lots of things, belly on deathclaws, combat inhibitor on most robots, thrusters  on Colonel Gutsies, Fusion Cores on sentry bots (once they overheat)
---
It was just so perfectly fit into the map under the radio tower above Mononga power plant. Couldnt even lay it directly back in the same location, and it was too large to find a flat location where it would place anywhere else. I searched for a few hours to no avail.
---
Is that adventure mode?  That sounds more like Adventure mode.  I've heard PvP is a lot more mercenary.
---
That could work and you know dam well there would 240 turrets less per server if they did this, imagine the horsepower the servers would save. 240=10 per player and max 24 players
---
Did they say you’d be able to see a camp machines inventory without having to go there? I hope that’s not the case, i think you should have to go to the shop to see what they have.
---
I agree melee reigns supreme, usually...
---
Bloodied is best for guns. The boost from adrenal, nerd rage, and the bloodied affect amounts to about 300% damage
---
I had someone drop a lv40 T-60 Power Armor set with the black and red BOS paint, Calibrated Shocks and a jetpack back when I was lv 10 on a new character - just hit lv40 and can use it 😁
---
Hey, hey, hey. Don't lump these people with the USMC! You could entertain them with a shiny rock and not let the Marines starve
---
Thanks!
---
I have a Gatling with 100cores but never use it.
---
Tbh the long pew worked well on my house at covering the level change from the outside.
---
Great now we just need to make Websters Dictionary accept this as a new word.
---
Oh I know, I usually pack up between 500 and 1000 steel then just churn out ammo until I run out of lead or gunpowder. Then go out and do my normal thing and not worry about steel since it reduces my ability to carry other junk, rinse and repeat until I run out of steel... then I go and collect tons again.
---
Yeah I do rapidly scrap lots of weapons for the steel. Thanks! Noted! I also lost an unyielding AP refresh chameleon combat leg( think that's what it was) :( sad sad day. It was even painted with AS paint. Best piece I ever had...gone. I still enjoy the game tho.
---
(Only level 60/zilch experience with SBQ) But I’m happy to try and help if you have trouble finding people. 🤷‍♀️
---
I just don’t think Assassins should be on the same piece as cavs or sent
---
Omg I forgot all about this!!!  I was so excited and grinding legendaries to trade in that I forgot all about this.   Being an actual scout when I was younger has me excited for this!!!!!
---
Lets face it, looking at his post history he is in fact probably at oldest 12
---
Thank you, and funny enough I do want power armor as soon as I can get it LOL it's part of an idea I have.  Thank you for the offer I'll see if I can take you up on that although I'm on the East coast so it will be a little later for me.
---
No problem. I’d do it for you but I only know the chest.
---
It'll continue in a further update/s.
---
Oh really? Thanks for info.
---
I was thinking about that perk, but I didn’t want a Fallout 3 problem I had, I don’t like enemies exploding all the time. Hope this isn’t the case anymore.
---
I play pvp, so its gonna be annoying to keep having to store the shop. But its worth it :)
---
Gonna sell all sorts of cheap stuff away haha
---
It was legendary 1star when I found him, didn’t even know it was associated with a quest
---
Anything crafting related, ones that require you to be in your camp, and other small ones like lock picking and hacking should be passive.
---
But with anything crafting related something like gunsmith it should be passive for the level 5 weapon mods, but not for the reduced weapon degradation.
---
I'm going to wait until it's live before I decide on if I'm going to move or not. I'm already within sight of a train station, and have plenty of water to go around, as well as a decent stock pile of ammunition and basic aid items. I have some legendaries, surplus plans and some stable flux sitting in my stash.
---
I'm pretty much selling anything I don't need that can be of use to others. Possibly with a fire sale on most things between post patch tomorrow and Sunday night.
---
You'll notice I didn't mention anything about immersion. I also hate the people that complain about immersion all the time, it's basically a meme at this point. Although I've seen it far more in relation to FO4 than 76.
---
I just prefer camps that look like they belong in the world. In addition to floating camps I also hate the giant square boxes full of empty rooms people seem to love so much. Most people are just bad at building things.
---
A few alarm bells goes of here....
---
You take "free candy" from a total stanger and even let him take photos of you ? not good....
---
(Just kidding, lol)
---
Okay I take there's more
---
ah yes the filthy casual beacon!  I keep my eye out for them too
---
I cant wait to take the locks off my doors and actually show people my camp again.  One too many times I came home to a wrecked shower and fusion generator and nothing else.  Made me lock everything up despite people wanting to know how I made my camp.  Will be really nice to be able to share it again.
---
Everything I don’t use. Thought about crafting A LOT of healing salves to sell low as a cheap alternative to stimpaks for those in need, may even make a sign to state to message me to negotiate for anything you see in my shop
---
lol after just 4-5 hours.....
---
Get adrenaline in agility it’s probably the best perk in the game
---
Same here, but I have a table with Fasnacht Balloons and Punch Bowl with booze in it outside!!
---
I love it when they pick a fight, lose, and demand their junk back. I'm like nope, that's what it cost you this time to be a d%$K. That is literally why you drop your junk upon death. I play in pacifist mode for a reason. If you annoy me enough to go in and turn that off, you deserve to lose your screws.
---
Another Redditor said the same, thanks.
---
One more thing if you don’t mind, I’ve put some perks in shotguns, I’m close to level 40, do you think I can undo this error in the future? According to Google it seems it’s possible?
---
Only way your gonna get it or from buying from someone
---
Oh they changed it and have 4 rocket turrets that decimate super mutants at lvl 68 with ease every time I spawn into my camp.
---
The game itself
---
Thank you everyone for the advice!  I looked at the atom shop but couldn't find the emote or the frame.  I don't see them in my already available things either.  Should I contact Bethesda?  I wonder if they removed them?
---
Well i was referencing Wolfenstein
---
Oh I have killing the SBQ down to a science, only time I've failed recently is when she glitched out and flew away. You just have to wait for me to have a big chunk of time to do it and unfortunately my son is graduating this weekend so I won't be able to for awhile
---
Bethesda might actually do this because it helps them get more money!
---
Aquabeast Queen
---
I have a feeling it will have to do with wanted status.  I am unlocking all my doors and resources because I have a feeling that if someone pics them and becomes wanted, they will then technically be hostile towards me and be able to attack my camp.
---
Bloody mess, adrenaline, tenderizer, nerd rage. There's a lot of perks all over the place that boost general damage. Pretty much at least one in every special category.
---
If you are on ps4 i can negotiate for a furious swingspeed +str bat when you are at max lvl
---
oh ill have to google that one!
---
I will check them out, thanks!
---
Yeah!! I was just hoping for clean one-tone walls but printed patterning on wallpaper would be swanky af! Lol
---
RP as raiders?  
---
Sure, so long as they RP as raiders and don't use vendors they should be attacking as well as attacking every single non-raider player they see, regardless of level.  
---
Otherwise they're just using a weak excuse to cover up their antisocial toxic behaviour.
---
yeah hopefully they will also decide to make the area directly behind the golf club off limits to CAMPS
---
**NEVER! YOU'LL NEVER TAKE ME ALIIIIIIIIIIVE!**
---
#**I'M AN AMERICAAAAAAN!**
---
What booze and chems and what build?   I’m max explosive expert,  shotgun perks, shitgunner, 2 levels of grenadier, and I think my best exploding shotgun shows 324 or so.   Is 1241 the damage it reads on your pip boy or is there damage there that isn’t on the roll?   What am I doing “wrong?”  I run a full health no rads build.
---
sorry buddy...
---
Already have a great location and established shop. Vending machines will just help me get out in the world more.
---
There's meant to be, sometime in the future yeah
---
Or even under build mode if in the description for things that aren't unlocked yet, it told you which set of and it could be found under. I feel like plans/mods in general are terribly described and hard to navigate, especially the armor and gun mods.
---
Oooh right next to the Top Of the World.
---
details are not 100% yet, but im willing to bet that they will just be shown on the map as a location to travel to, and not list the inventory within
---
but we will know more tomorrow!
---
Yeah... only problem is people who might RP as raiders and attack my base
---
😂 lmao
---
that would save alot of caps, but i cat see them doing it do be honest as they seem to need cap sinks to fight inflation (see the new 10% tax on player vending transactions)
---
I'm honestly assuming at least 700 points per color. Just like how they had so many different floorings and they were all like 700 points per style. So unless you're gonna spend 1400 or 2100 points, you can still only have white and one other color.
---
I is a bit of an odd choice but for me it was Camp Mcclintock. Just thinking about how inadequate the training would be for combat troops. A whole quarter of it was anti-union propaganda, and the rest was just lack luster. No wonder troops were so willing to use lethal force in civilians during riots. The worst part is, the army is was the only ones hiring every where else was automating just about everything. If you couldn't afford a top dollar university all you could do was kill and die.
---
Fuck
---
If we got a Bottle cap for every player who complains about this, we would enough to pay stupid trade prices from other players.
---
Right now I'm in the odd position that I can't buy anything from the new PC vendors because I've got too much stuff in my stash ready to sell on my PC vendor, and I can't sell anything because I'm maxed on caps ready to buy stuff. I really didn't think this through, did I...
---
You kill my imersion with your lack of creativity :(
---
I've been so fortunate not to have my base attacked, knock on a legendary wood right arm. Seriously though I just started to work on my base (lvl 162) and it's time consuming and fun. I couldn't imagine if someone destroyed it lol  if someone did yeah I can rebuild it but it's nice this is getting fixed! :)
---
I have extra plans that I have been ghosting lower level players and dropping them at their places. I will have to put some on the selling block also.
---
I was until I read about how the raiders are salivating over knowing where everybody's camp is. 
---
Would be nice if we could set up vending machines at the Whitespring...
---
Mine will be out in the boonies and I'm going to have some NICE STUFF so come on down to crazy eddie's! Hopefully it will not be on fire!
---
We shall see
---
He revives a short while later.  Seriously.  Murgle is immortal 🐱
---
How so much lead? My camp is on a lead deposit so I normally have around 3-400 depending how much ammo I'm making, but I'd love a way that's not camp dependent to get a lot of lead so I can move.
---
There's just some garbage people in this game man. Social media and online gaming just gives people a chance to be like this without any real consequences. This example is minor but we won't be able to retaliate
---
Did you try to close out completely and reload? This happened to me once after I had been on standby for an extended period and there had been a patch to the PS4 system
---
Missile turrets.
---
What about them
---
Getting involved in SBQ fights also helps. I have a full set of 2-star Unyielding heavy combat armor I got from her.
---
I can run though the base myself, it's not easy but I can do it more so than actually killing the queen lol
---
Since they put all caps in 1 vendor I actually have caps now and don’t waste fast travelling to each vendor.
---
Well I’ve only jumped in 2 weeks ago after getting the game on launch and waiting for them to iron out the PS4 version. So I am not full on caps but I also haven’t been able to keep as many items as I’d like for vending. I understand it’s to stop the game crashing but I think if they were two separate stashes we’d be fine.
---
Dang, some good ones here that I missed   😁👍
---
I think the way that worked, one person got the fluids or mass from the original corpse, while one person could get them from the meat pile. If you were the second scavenger in either case, you got nothing.
---
If you're solo then it may have been easier before. I normally play in a team so it was a pain.
---
Ill raise you 100 caps.
---
Fingers crossed
---
Description is misleading. Add in the other mod (actually a .dll instead of a .ba2 file) and it's back to the old functionality of \[SHIFT\]+&lt;NUMBER&gt; saving current configuration to that slot. Could not be smoother.
---
whenever I see a player call balance changes "ham-fisted" or that it "shafted" parts of the player base and using every other tired cliche to argue against balancing, it's just glaringly obvious screaming "I chase FOTM".
---
this is not a true mmo and Bethesda knows it. it's how they designed the thing. don't hold it to the same standards as, say, WoW. not to mention, they can barely keep up with the bugs, let alone serve as community managers. I doubt anything will ever be done about scammers.
---
what *you* can do is not trade with strangers and get middlemens. of course some random after a queen fight is gonna scam you, that's obvious. use the market sub and rely on karma. they also have dedicated middlemens for big trades.
---
I get those sometimes.  They have always self-corrected.   IMO number one cause is your network going down temporarily.
---
Did the same... Felt so stupid when I found out what it was...
---
Uh, I've gotten 3 pro broken cameras from scorched -- repaired, and gave to other players who had lost theirs for the quest.  So they CAN be replaced.  Just do a search on reddit.  Its possible.
---
The logic behind bulking is that most materials aren't worth 1 cap each. Imagine how quickly people would accumulate caps if you could sell things like wood and steel for 1 cap each. A 10 minute walk from flatwoods to Poseidon collecting wood, kill all the scorched at the power plant, scrap all their weapons, and you'd probably have 600 wood and 300+ steel. 
---
That said, I'm surprised some things like ballistic fiber and acid have to be bulked. They're definitely worth at least 1 cap each.
---
Just what a commie would say.
---
Better dead than red
---
I have been making that healing salve (?) and with that Green Thumb and Super Duper I ended up with 350 last time. Its real good for cleaning out a vendors cap.
---
I can solo her, no caps necessary. I use bloodied melee FYI. Just let me know when and shoot me your psn
---
I’m helping new players level up now. Nothing else to do.
---
Me too. I like to visit the doggo from time to time to just check on him
---
It gets posted all the time because it's a damned good idea and frankly as a PC user with Perk Loadout Manager available I don't get how console gamers aren't just screaming and pulling out their hair every thirty seconds. Keep posting, hopefully Bethesda will listen.
---
Hopefully, but once I can scrap out my pile of legendaries I've been hoarding for scrip that will help me out loads
---
&gt;  and hope that future content add some new trophies/achievements!
---
Hah!  Trying to get platinum for FO3 and continually being knocked back by new achievements in the DLCs, ah, fond memories.
---
Uh, I know what I've done to help other players?  Look at my "comment" history for proof?  Not assume everyone who speak "facts" are speaking pure gospel?  
---
I have personal experience, darling.  Why else would it be on our tinkerbench as an option?
---
I'm not sure if, technically, the person scamming you broke any of the Ts and Cs... 
---
There's a lot of legal formalities, and in-game scamming without using game exploits often goes unpunished.
---
The cave at the bottom is an acid mode, but yes. Spot on.
---
Yogi's keep looking over their shoulder at you in a bit of a pathetic manner after you cripple them.  I always get a bit of conscience right before I hack them into pieces.
---
In Adventure mode, if you turn on pacifist, your CAMP will be immune to player damage with tomorrow's patch.
---
(Xbox One)
---
Im sure you know by now that you can. Just in case. have only one in your person inventory, go to armor bench, click the x button to scrap, click the button to RS inspect. Click Rename.
---
Yeah, not looking forwards to that one.  Hell, even the join 20 teams looks like it might stretch out into the distant future...
---
heavy guns have double that, what are you talking about? not to mention they'll last a whole minute with a rof of 99 because of the terrible durability.
---
I am going to sell useful one stars.  AA handmades, bloodied knuckles and the like.
---
It's hard because it's hard to find anyone doing Encryptid :(
---
Yeah I have been trying to do that but don’t have the space. :/ and it’s not like I’ve got old weapons or costumes weighing me down. It’s ammo I can’t sell and don’t use, and the stuff I’ve been saving for roleplaying a brewery for my camp :P
---
And they are placed in inventory as weapons.  Look in my comment replies as proof and ask the guy I gave one too if you need proof.
---
Does this spot happen to be slightly northwest of a flower on the map?
---
I'm not really a fan of building in those spots. I call it the "Triangle of Your Camp Can't be Placed". They're good locations, but the problem is that a lot of other players also think they're good locations. I tried having a camp on top of the acid deposit where the flower is, but the number of "Your spot is already taken" messages I got became too frustrating so I decided to move.
---
I personally wouldn't pay much for that because they take up more space than I'd like and I wouldn't actually use it... but it's super cool you have one!!
---
But to stick to your point thats what I meant specifically.
---
Yeah i know  but even so it’s the best location in my opinion
---
I've been dumping ammo. Bandolier helps but once I get several thousand bullets of something o don't use I throw it in a station suitcase
---
As do I.
---
Ivory grip plan: 1 cap!! lol
---
Ok, that makes sense to solo me.
---
Maybe I live in a different...wasteland...than most people here, but I don't even *know how* to lock anything - never wanted the option, never looked for how to do it.
---
I've got a full shop (minus decom shower, until things are safer), with purified water and crops available to whoever wanders by.
---
Not, it was a bit different when I had my camp on a road near a quest location, but right now I'm fairly hidden in a small canyon (out by Johnson's Acre, near vault 96).  Only people I've seen anywhere near my camp...are other people who have their camp in the boonies too.
---
You would be surprised at how often people drop 300+ of all sorts of things. Just this week a player dropped me over 400 stims, mostly super. Several players with 100+ junks. One had like 700 wood drop. I unfortunately can't pick most of it up due to stash space. It took me 2 days to give away all the stims.
---
Yeah I’ve got bandolier but I’ve got 11 mini nukes and didn’t have space for the fatman etc. I thought at least I can sell the mini nukes but they weigh so damn much :/
---
I don’t remember the names of them but I have a lot
---
I almost did the same thing because I named my shotty 'Pew Stick'
---
It still is 25k. After these transactions it requires you transfer the caps to a mule character. That's the market I don't understand
---
Yes I am... dookiestorm... what ya want for it
---
but.. meat tastes better.
---
I don't care the "technical aspect"
---
Do you think letting this things happen is the good for the game and for the players community?
---
I'll have to try this spot... thank you
---
Those of us with auto weapons and sets of armor are constantly repairing.
---
yeah playing Fallout 3 with my elementary school aged kids watching was... not good for them
---
Nice try fbi
---
I'm in a nice spot now, but it's pretty far from anything. I'll miss having it where it is but am gonna take the opportunity to expand it, I have lots of budget left.
---
Getting caps has become easier I feel. However just surfing though the market page, I think I will never participate in a trade. Won't be surprised to eventually see "selling 3\* X item for $5"... fuk
---
I just wanna address the discussion not on what things are now, but on what the could/should do to make them better....
---
Oh damn. Where was your camp?
---
When you are in build mode you can select an existing door or container, and then while its selected, there is an option to lock it.  I only lock one of my purifies so I always have water if I need it.  I even leave my coal extractor unlocked.  I took the lock off last night as even if someone takes it, it will come back before I notice, and I don't want people getting wanted near my house.
---
I don't get the people who do this, but I really don't get the ones who go for the freshly minted lvl 5's and 10's. what could they possible have for them?
---
I've lost an explosive SMG that vanished from a mule's stash right after a trade, and several items on my main during fast travel (and especially when I crashed during a fast travel). Usually it's an equipped weapon, but once I lost an equipped piece of armor. Now I do two thing: (1) I always try to unequip all weapons before I fast travel and (2) I go to great lengths to secure backups (or as close as I can get) for my favorite gear.
---
It's a bit sad that Bethesda hasn't figured out the most basic of all IT concepts - transactional integrity.
---
Oh okay I was trying to get the trophy on PS4
---
I had a load of mini nukes. Then I got the MIRV, went a bit stupid with it at New Gad, and like magic the mini nukes were gone 🤣 on a side note I think we should be able to scrap out our bullets and reclaim some lead and gunpowder for ammo we actually want.
---
Sure, when your camp is allowed to exist there and you don't have to server hop multiple times to get a world where it isn't already taken.
---
This has happened to me too, but I just went to my CAMP and 'repaired all structures' and it was fixed. Doesn't that just put it back the way you had it? It's not like you have to start from the ground up.
---
I see that (from work, so 'see' is relative), I will absolutely be checking that out when I get home.
---
Everyone needs to message the creator to update that description!
---
that's why it is good to not build a camp near any of the "Meta" Nuke spawns. White springs, Charleston, Harper's Ferry (The Burrows)
---
I'm planning to turn in most of mine for tokens, but I have a few really nice 3* I'm going to try to sell. Assuming they raise the cap level. They also really need to push stash limit to 1000 too to account for what you're selling.
---
Just keep in mind that the grenade drops when you're downed; it doesn't wait for you to actually die.
---
You can gamble and just get radiation till you get a mutation and equip strached genes 2 (so you dont lose the mutation, it is found under luck at like lvl 30 or 40) and then heal your rads. server hop and repeat. that is the cheap way, but what mutation you get is random and there are a couple that will lower your strength and affect your melee damage a little bit. Or my prefered method is to just buy the serums from another player  for the mutations you want. they run between 100-200 caps each. but be sure to equip starched genes 2 or you will run the risk of losing them when you heal your rads. I have heard that grape nuka cola will cure rads while not affecting mutations, but I have not tested that out. I personally run grounded, electrically charged, talons, twisted muscles, carnivore, marsupial, herd mentality (I always run on a team), and maybe one or 2 that I am forgetting.
---
What is a long pew?
---
Pew Pew Pew, Murica
---
Holy shit this explains so much
---
Yeah I’d get rid of all the stringer ammo I’ve got, cause I don’t think anyone will actually buy it :P
---
Shitgunner lol I must of missed that one 😂 And yes, that is according to my pip boy. But bethesda recently stated the damages indicated are higher than what is being displayed in the pip boy. So I'm just going off my pipboy. I have a bloodied,explosive, faster reload double barrel. All max shotguner perks in strength. Max demo perk, max nerd rage, and max bloody mess are all pretty good in the terms of maximum damage. As far as the chems I go for the long time favorite of mine psycho thats another 25%. And the latest is thanks to bivy boy down in the cellar. Ballistic Bock adds 15% to ranged damage and is super cheap to make.
---
Here you go. =3

I don't have Bravo's hatch location (wouldn't be hard to find), but I did list Charlie's with a map marker. The silo hatches aren't as close to the actual silo as you'd think, so most people seem to overlook them because they're a bit further out than you'd expect.
---
No problem! Glad to help.
---
It would be helpful if a notice came up warning of that but I doubt they’ll do it unfortunately
---
Still need power armor to farm junk
---
Yeah but we should at least have a warning before coming in and not total unprovoked decimation .
---
My Responder character is going to sell medicines, ammunition, and a variety of tools and weapons suitable for home building and home defense in post-war Appalachia.
---
My selfish, carefree character is going to sell chems, booze, Halloween costumes and whatever bits and pieces of interesting garbage she’s hauled back home after her adventures.
---
Move your camp somewhere else. It fully repairs everything and blueprints your house. After you move it somewhere else, place your house,boom fully repaired for free
---
The oil extractor only holds 5 oil, it makes it pretty much useless for actually farming oil.
---
I'm on PC, I just went right to Bethesda's support section 
---
Not a clue how to help for Xbox and PS4 since it likely is through Microsoft but I doubt you'll get a refund from them (mostly because if they refund, Bethesda might outright ban your account for 'free content')
---
For options, I think I selected something along the lines of "description inaccurate", not sure
---
Bethesda follow up community on reddit. We can pretend everything is fine and let these thing continuing, or we can propose solution to have the game always better and better
---
Yeah I get that but I don't plan on charging a whole lot.
---
 Some of the weapons I have I have seen go for 20000 caps. I am not going to get anywhere near that price.
---
 If someone's lucky enough to stumble across my collection then they get really good weapons and armor for cheap.
---
I don't plan on putting them all on at once as I don't want the rich reseller to come buy up all my wares and re sell them for more money
---
&gt;What am I doing “wrong?”
---
&gt;I run a full health no rads build.
---
that's what you're doing wrong. 300 is the roof for "regular" shotgun damage. ever since the TSE nerf, ranged weapons have no way of dealing high numbers other than bloodied builds. a bloodied pump can top at 1500.
---
if you want more damage then you'll need to rely on stealth or vats. invest in sneak, escape artist and covert operative and/or four leaf clover, critical savvy and better criticals. or a bloodied build, of course. check captainoob's latest video, it's a bloodied stealth/crit build.

Finally, I can made a trade outpost CAMP like I always wanted to. Trade medical items and whatever people need for what else others would. Yes I legit made my level 128 a trader/raider (technically not a raider but has that grungy about to bust though your door and finish her makeup look). Honestly I suck at building plus hoping someone doesn’t take the nice view spot..
---
Thanks for info
---
I'm not a melee expert but i can see a few issues anyway.
---
&gt; Picklock, Expert Picklock, Hard Bargain, Weapon Artisan, Armorer, Home Defense.
---
These are passive perks. You only want them when you perform those specific actions. You don't need the lockpicking perks when you're fighting something. Only equip it when you're next to a lock you want to pick. This applies to all of those mentioned above.
---
&gt; Fortune Finder, Good Doggy, Aquaboy/Aquagirl
---
Fortune finder is pointless, waste of a card slot, you can just check a youtube guide with cap stashes locations and not waste a slot. Good doggy only works with dog food. Just get the carnivore mutation and you'll never worry about food again. Aquaboy/Aquagirl is useless too. West Virginia is mostly land. How often do you find yourself swimming?
---
&gt;Concentrated Fire +  Long Shot
---
Concentrated fire is focused on VATS, Long Shot is focused on manual aim. It's better to chose one or the other, but it's a minor thing...
---
&gt;Fire in the hole
---
If you must.... But if you want to use grenades and throwables why not add demolition expert? 
---
&gt;Mysterious Savior
---
I guess you picked this one so you won't die a lot? It's a wasted slot too... Get better armor, or a PA, i'm in a PA most of the time and i'm sturdy as heck. No need to waste points on mysterious savior.
---
I've gotten the Ultracite left arm 3 times in a row from the queen lol
---
Love the pool 😎
---
It won't let me place it anywhere else because I had to muck around with the stairs to place them and it now counts as un placeable anywhere.
---
I had a level 150 player save my level 6 ass against a horde of ghouls
---
I spent almost all day working on my CAMP yesterday for player vending.  I want others to see what I have built.  It is not exactly what I had envisioned but it was the best I could do.
---
The items stay in your stash, displayed in vending machine, until bought.
---
With Serendipity is fairly easy, barely an inconvenience: it doesn't.
---
Senrendipity is like the incoming damage rolls a 'to hit' dice, 0 misses, 1 hits.
---
Depending on what level of the perk you have this imaginary D100 has 15, 30 or 45 '0' sides.
---
Some people insists that luck has an effect on the perk allowing to exceed the stated %, personally I don't know if this is true or false.
---
Regarding the other two... Is an absolute ballache because the damage equation was already beautifully convoluted in FO4 and I am unsure if is the same in the current iteration of FO76...
---
Short answer: I don't know for sure.
---
Long answer: may I point you to the original FO4 damage equation:
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance
---
Then direct you to the xEdit discord where infinitely more knowledgeable people can answer the question.
---
Now excuse me while I go and cook something elaborate to eat away this feeling of inadequacy you have just elicited.
---
Turrets are hostile to wanted people in general.  Unless this is changed all a would be griefer needs is to server hop until they find a lock to pick.
---
Thanks I added it now.
---
Fair enough but it is literally the best spot
---
I wasn't expecting this long of an answer, and I have to agree with you to some extent. We need squeaky wheels over here to push the game to where it should be. The game is stills everely lacking right now. Bethesda needs to pick up steam to improve Fallout 76. The added content so far was shallow in my opinion.
---
I just think that giving us painted walls shouldn't be a priority (right now). But yeah, we definitely should speak out about what we want.
---
Thank you for taking the time to respond. Most wouldn't, and would just down vote. Negativity almost always feels unwarranted to the things you like/love. I only critize things/people I care about.
---
i bet its awesome! as long as you are proud of it, then that is the only opinion that matters!
---
True.  But I don't use turrets, so I don't have to worry about that.
---
Could still move it, delete the blueprint, and all the walls, floors, furniture, etc. From your blueprint will be fully repaired and added to 'stored'. Would have to rebuild your house, but it would be repaired for free.
---
Got to love how majority of fallout 76 players are nice to one another, recently had someone come with a bunch of players to encrypitd event and saw him just run to bodies to steal junk and hide through entire event, I don't hold junk so I wasn't worried but theres still vermin like that and players who come to SBQ fights to get a hit in and hide.
---
Looks more like Freddy Mercury and the group scorch queen
---
I mean you really must not pvp much. You can use tormentor and tank killer to stagger anyone in sentinel and they are forced to stand and take your damage. You can use cover and when they move do full damage, or catch them crouched and sneaking. They are not invulnerable and have handi caps. I don't see any complaining towards full cavaliers running you down and ko you for about 100x your hp bar.
---
The standard combination is Bloodied powerfist or deathclaw gauntlet, Adrenal Reaction and Twisted Muscles mutations, a full set of Unyielding armor, Nerd Rage and Radicool (with 80% rads).
---
Not sure whether you can break PA pieces in one punch without exploits though. One-shot kills are easy enough.
---
I would love to have fishing added to the game too. You could fish up enemies and bosses with the new mechanic.
---
the *community managers* follow up on things here and then send reports to the devs, which are probably promptly ignored and sent straight to the trash considering bugs people have been reporting since release still plague the game.
---
it's like I said, Beth's current stance on the game is clearly hands-off. they don't even have a system to restore vanished items. you're asking for way too much.
---
OP doesnt know what death metal is.
---
The game client doesn't know if there's a nuke zone until you load in.
---
Nice place.
---
So YOUUUUREEe,,, one of the causing my camp cannot be placed messages to appear on my screen lol
---
Yeah but I have done that previously and it took a solid boring half hour of replacing and moving round to make every thing fit.
---
Call it Freddy Mercury-Poisoning
---
Yes, and probably flatwoods. Catch the new players as they come in, sell low level guns and ammo. I feel  its more profitable to make small amounts of caps quickly then large amounts slowly.
---
My super sledge will be called hard pew in your honor
---
I've found and given 3 away.  They can be fixed via tinker bench and are under "weapon" in inventory.
---
I sorry I wouldn't know about that. I guess that removes all option of a pre-load warning.
---
Hmm, good question..
---
I might put up a camp very close to the nuke border at fissure prime, selling nuke cards, cheap, i love SBQ fights, lol
---
Not even getting into the gamma gun, you wanna make anyone in PvP fear you just pull one of those out.
---
The despair the whitespeong people had when being forced to leave by the robots. Just got me for some reason. They had a safe place to stay, but due to tech glitches they couldnt stay.
---
Scorched have them.  I've found, fixed, and given away 3.
---
I’ve had this issue since imposter sheepsquatch was brought in
---
the game is buggy as hell and rm sellers still get their stock *somewhere*.
---
so yeah, while I can't present you with any evidence, it's hard to put 1 and 1 together.
---
Enlighten me oh wise one...
---
I've been gathering a collection of level 1-10 legendary pieces so that when the patch goes live tomorrow I can set up shop somewhere near Flatwoods and hook up new players with fun weapons. I'm not quite sure how to price it yet, but I'm sure I can find a happy balance between what I spent to mod them out and what a new player would find as a good value. I'm thinking like 100 caps for things like baseball bats, axes, and other things that don't require too many mats to repair and upgrade, and something like 200-300 for things like deep pocketed treated leather armors and instigating hunting rifles with recon scopes, suppressors, and all the other bells and whistles.
---
You can also run out of the woods and across the street from your  spawn point, where there is another random spawn event point (usually 3 enemies, and a chance to find something cool). then hang a right and run to the bus through the woods. this way you get to avoid what ever time waster is lurking in that trailer home unless they see you. This method is just to make it faster and less ammo wasting if your going to server hop.
---
Aye, either you're spending time farming resources to repair everything, or spending time rebuilding your freely repaired stuff. Either way...you're fucked. lol
---
Nah. That's just the game. Don't hold on to to much junk, make ammo when you can to cut down steel lead n gun powder weight. You don't really need more than 100 wood at a time. Just look at the junk that you have a cut what you don't need
---
Damn it.  Yeah he was probably trying to help me out further but I was too much of a dummy to figure out how to get to him lol.  I'll try this out next time for sure, thx man
---
Borat has a band now?
---
EXXAAACCTTLLLYYYY!!!!!! #CampersAcrossAppalachia
---
I'm a bloodied melee build and I want it to work too. I'm just not sure how they would make it work
---
I've only had one crash in 4 days
---
Whenever someone makes vaguely disqualifying statements picking holes on perfectly adequate language and throwing around random acronyms with varying degrees of obscurity rather than making a counterargument is glaringly obvious that they are graduates from the University of Reframing, in 1 Straw Man Lane.
---
Ok I get it.  I’m just a tanky PA guy who’s happy with my 325dmg in pve.   If they don’t fuck with that I’ll be ok snd wont whine anymore.
---
wow.  you genius!
---
Scrap it first than toss it into the stash.
---
I try keep around 100 of each material 200 of the rare stuff like springs or ballistic fiber.
---
I don't keep anything like aid or ammo in there. 
---
As for weapons and armor. If you can't carry it you probably don't need it.
---
Question: what's the best way to know how much you should charging for items?
---
&gt; What if I don't use vats? what if My character is a no vats Sniper? 
---
Not every build should be viable against every other build.
---
Exactly, I have found myself creating bulk and selling due to excess. So now you have enough materials and a few extra caps. 
---
Just pick up everything you see for a while.
---
I tried.... In my country we say something that can be translated as "the sea is plenty of fishes"....
---
I have 3 accounts all above level 150, I've only struggled with my stash limit really late game because of all the crafting stuff you need for repairing weapons/armor. 
---
Maybe check for cloth, wood, concrete and lead? I always have a huge abundance of all that and you really don't need all too much. Do you have ammo stored? Weapons can be 20 pounds a piece and that adds up quick as well.
---
I'm tastefully furnished. Can't wait to see all who likes my build
---
Yeah. I should probably pack up and move further away but I don't wanna leave that aluminium extractor or the large supply of cranberries nearby.
---
You mean to tell me you got the terminals done before the Queen of the Hunt?
---
xD
---
They are rolling out the protected camp with this update. From what understand, players will no longer be able to destroy camps if certain conditions are met. So camp greifing due to prices should be a non-issue.
---
I just came back to the game and I’m a lowly 15 seeing people’s camps would be cool and give me more incentive to explore.
---
I can confirm nickybeth. They graciously gifted me one the other day. Seems to be a rare drop from scorched. The other way to do it is have an alt character complete the quest, then give it to yout main via a mule.
---
yeah but they can still lure creatures to your camp and have them destroy it
---
One certain spot I always go to when I need a frame is Morgantown Train yard. There's a green rail car that almost always has one, and if it doesn't, there's an unmarked warehouse just south of there (just a bit west of mama dolce's) that has one. It's been a very rare situation where a frame wasn't in at least one of those two spots, usually both. Plus it's all low-level scorched in that area so you don't have to worry too much about enemies.
---
HA! i love it! 
---
im not one to body shame, but those girls could do to add some moisturizing in their daily routines
---
They seem to respawn more frequently, but there doesn't seem to be as many legendary enemies. If you're just looking to farm for XP its fine, but there are better places to hunt for gear.
---
Well there are still glitches to where you can still kill people in passive mode so we will see how it works.
---
I have a camp over a strem with a open view of it inside. It's nice hearing the water while I'm chilling in camp. Id welcome more visitors
---
I dream of an update, long in the future, that does away with the perk card system entirely. Cards are fine if you can trade them - like, say, there's a rare card that gives an extra +15% melee damage, and you draw it but you're a rifle build so you trade with someone who drew a VATS-through-walls perk. But that's the only way they make sense. Without that, they're immersion-breaking tedium. What, like I suddenly forgot how to pick locks because I needed to get better aiming in VATS?
---
Perk Loadout Manager removes a lot of the tedium, for PC players that can use it, but it only makes an awful system tolerable. It's clear that the devs wanted (or, more likely, were told) to include a card system which made the cards a solution in search of a problem. It certainly explains why the implementation is so bad and clunky.
---
Yes it still works. 
---
And no I won't post how to do it.
---
There are still many bugs and exploits in the game even some that are from the beta which they haven't bothered to fix.
---
The way to do it is complete the quest on an alt, then transfer to your main via a mule. Also, nickybeth gifted me one the other day and is not full of bs
---
I got a vampire ffr gamma gun. When a turret camp shows up, I will running my won open range event where I herd ghouls to turret camps and spam gamma to keep them alive. I'm looking forward to trying it out
---
45 minutes? It really shouldn't take more than 15-20, even faster if you have level 3 lockpick to skip the reactor segment.
---
oh that sounds nice! very relaxing...
---
 im up on a mountain on one of my characters and i like to listen to the sound of the wind in the trees
---
im gonna repeat my post from earlier
---
let us make rat poisoned wine, it kills you 15 seconds after you drink it. unless you use a disease cure. the more you drink the more disease cures you must pop
---
Free Wooby or I won't pay my taxes from sales from vending machine!
---
The good thing about how I *think* things will work, is that you won't need to put your camp in a high traffic area to get visitors (it may still help though).
---
I'm so far out of the way that the likelihood of someone finding my camp is about 0 unless they're out exploring for no other reason than to sightsee, but it's a great location.  It would be worthless as a storefront if people couldn't see it on the map, but if someone can see where it is and just fast travel (it's not all that far from Watoga or Whitespring), I'm sure I'll get at least enough traffic to make it worth the trouble of listing things.
---
Personally, I don't plan on being a customer of any shops that is set up to get in the way of regular gameplay (Whitespring, across a highway, a stone's throw from a trainyard, etc.)
---
Could you perhaps DM me how? Asking for a friend (;
---
Don't forget talons when using a fist. That's another 25% plus bleed
---
First of all, the album cover would just be autopsy photos. Second, the garb here looks more like black metal or power metal. Death metal is essentially just the musical equivalent of the original Evil Dead films.
---
Even the rarer weapons don't really have value unless they also have good legendary stars, so you can scrap those. Similarly with armor.
---
Unless you have a specific project that you're saving for, use your junk to craft &amp; scrap weapons and armor to unlock mods. Vendor any excess that isn't screws, especially if you know a place you can get more of it.
---
Don't keep high weight ammunition like 40mm grenades, low charge fusion cores, plasma cores, railway spikes or 2mm rounds. Dump any gunpowder (under misc) that you have.
---
FYI, the camp being too close thing is a lie. It just changes the spawn point from near the pond, to the other side of the upper train bridge. I have actually never gotten him to spawn by the pond, but have gotten him multiple times at the upper bridge when there is a camp at the pond. Over all though, I would say that in my experience  "Lady Janes soft serve" has a higher success rate than Charleston or Grafton stations.
---
I’m not worried about that personally. My camp is merely foundations under a bridge with benches. If someone wants to destroy my benches because of my prices, whatever.
---
What do you mean?
---
Didn't he end up part of the group of ghouls that ended up in the dyer chemical sub tunnels?
---
Thank you, this is why I posted it here.
---
For the passive perks, would you recommend replacing them with something else or should I simply unequip them?
---
Fortune Finder is there because I always need caps. I run out a lot, and it's an easier/more immersive way to find caps. for the carnivore mutation, does it work for prepared food like tea and cookies? there is a lot of benefits to cooking that I'd hate to lose out on. But I guess you're right about Aquaboy, I'm usually not swimming.
---
And, you called it. Mysterious Savior is there because I die a lot. I'm working on getting better armor, but I only wear power armor for nuke zones. The sound power armor makes, and how slow I move in it, drives me up the wall
---
it's exactly what Pohra said: transactional integrity. I believe items disappear due to server (de)sync. what you're seeing on your end, the client side, isn't what the server is seeing. and of course the server information trumps yours to avoid cheating.
---
for example, say you press R/square to reload. that's also the key used to drop items. except the server thinks you have the pipboy open when you actually don't, at least on the client side. so it performs the action bound to the R/square key while on the pipboy, drop whatever is highlighted.
---
this is of course just an example. essentially, it applies to anything that moves items around, maybe even the favorites wheel. **what I did was rebind reload to the F key and physically remove the R key from my keyboard**. I also avoid moving things to and from my stash and vendors.
---
I CAN'T WAIT NO MORE GRIEFERS IN ADVENTURE!!! don't care if they come for a settlement i took or anything I just care about my nice base not getting wrecked by some 12 year old who couldn't take munitions from me. Hate having to server hop to avoid the damage
---
Your character oddly looks like Serj Tankian so I have reasons to believe this is a System of a Down album cover
---
I really wasnt intending to give such a long winded answer, so I'm glad it didn't upset you. The only reason I've already posted it is simply due to the ease with witch it could be made. They are working hard on actually important issues, yes, but they also like to pump out nice small things to keep us occupied, just like the clean generators, different types of flooring, PA paint jobs and stuff. So if they ARE gonna spend the time making little things, I may as well try. I try hard to post with a cool head and not downvote cuz it doesn't help me get my point across.
---
Would love this and is really needed since Free states missions seems entirely pointless.
---
Never heard of that, and apparently neither have anyone I've played with. I was unaware that could be skipped. I've only dropped 4 nukes, 2 of them solo.
---
Where is this shortcut? Before the broken pipe part?
---
I'm most excited about scrapping the 500+lbs of legionaries from my stash
---
I'll help, I can launch the nuke by myself as well if that helps.
---
Officially named my Instigating Lever Action in honor of this comment.
---
I think Bethesda’s biggest mistake on pvp servers is making train stations and stuff into pvp zones. That’s probably the number one reason why I don’t play pvp servers. Those should be the only safe zones and inside whitesprings resort/enclave.
---
I was originally excited for pvp servers until I heard how they did it. I’d rather randomly find someone and it can either turn into a friendly encounter or a bad experience. Of course there’s going to be spawn camping if your only fast travel points, even very limited travel points are easily marked.
---
Ranged in chameleon all the time waiting for someone to spawn in the same exact spot every time wouldn’t be an issue if they were forced to actually move. But what do I know? Ranged says nerf melee lol.
---
When my friend first got the game he bought the clean skin for the purifier thinking he would get the actual purifier.
---
yes i dont get it why there are these heavy bugs and we dont get any information on it. id like to know on what bugs they are working.. like dayz does it on their dev tracker.
---
i.e. send a ticket about 6 weeks ago about a mod on combat armor arms "increased unarmed damage". the mod is not working. never got a response.
---
found a uny/sent marine armor yesterday with +25 rad. but the +25 rad is bugged so most people dont accept it for trades. this bug is known since beta, never fixed, never got any information on it.
---
but when we cant put mods on our x-01 they fix it in 1 week so people will buy more atom skins...
---
i remember during the fortnite hype a dude was asking via reddit sub if they could make it able ingame to use keyboard and gamecontroller at the same time because he was handicapped. next patch they implemented it. 
---
i dont have the feeling that anyone from the devs really care for the problems people are listing here.. really frustrating and feelsbad.
---
Yep lol
---
Its a glitch from fallout 4 and doesn't seem to be getting patched anytime soon as its been issue since day 1.
---
I'm going to specialize in making players feel better about themselves, given I'm a level 82 and have garbage to show for it.
---
My gift to the world is lowering the bar, so you don't have to.
---
Maybe Bethesda will allow tip jars.
---
I agree, it would make better sense to limit it to one per person per camp. I have a bar on mine so if I'm about people can always buy more drinks for a cap. 🤷🏻‍♀️ I'll probably loiter more with player vending to interact with others and tend the bar.
---
What tha fuck? Lol, I had no idea.
---
Looks like that’s exactly what happened, I’m a spaz. Thank you!
---
That's a fair point. But honestly, as much as the vendor bots charge for some of it, they could use a little bump in cap value.
---
Queen fights often have people going down too
---
Prepare to be disappointed in my Vending, but please enjoy the Camps I've worked hard on.
---
Keep an eye out for nuke zones. People will often dump their unwanted stuff at the nearby vendors. If someone nukes Whitesprings be sure to check the train station and the Artisans Corner store inside the hotel. If someone nukes the Queen go check out the watoga train station. It's best to check every hours or so as people will become over encumbered at different rates and will be stopping by to unload stuff regularly.
---
Probably. Selling armor plans and ammo.
---
Im going to selling 133 Mini Nukes.
---
Well I'm online... add me or find me...
---
I'm lucky in that probably 90% of the time I'm playing with my partner, otherwise yeah it's hard for a solo!
---
Out of all the base protection, the missile turrets work
---
I’d love them to fix laser trip wires, allow us to use a terminal to set key codes on doors and a red highlight of what piece of your base is preventing you from putting something down. I honestly don’t have much complaints but I think these were forgotten and thrown on the back burner because no one brings them up anymore. I’d also love for them to finish making powered doors. I don’t like wood or brick door frames. I’d love metal ones though.
---
PACIFIST, NOT PASSIVE, MODE DOES NOT MAKE IT SO YOU CAN NOT GET KILLED. We as a group need to stop this misconception. Pacifist mode only prevents you from dealing damage to other players, preventing accidental and or unwanted PVP. It DOES not prevent you from taking damage. And yes I know there have been reports that reactive plates and or the electrically charged mutations "could" bypass pacifist mode. But it has been awhile since I have heard of that being an issue, they were supposed to fix that a few patches ago.
---
Added
---
Whenever you take the melee route, remember that every strength level adds 5% to your melee damage. This means using a bloodied weapon, combined with unyielding armor, and keeping your health below 50% is extremely powerful. Keeping your HP below 20% is game-breaking powerful. There are also perks which greatly increase your damage resistance the lower your health is. You'll want to avoid using power armor though, as some of the perks and the unyielding effect won't work then.
---
My personal favourite weapon is the pole hook. Less view bob when swinging, slightly longer range, and no annoying PFFFT (super sledge) sound when you swing it. However, any melee weapon becomes a killing machine when you're using the right perks and armor!
---
I was a WS station last night listening to a conversation between two players that were trading. The 'trader' was basically saying he knows someone that dupes, and that's where he gets his stock from. He also said you could pretty much get the exact weapon/effects you wanted within a couple of days requesting them. 
---
Don't know how it works, and I don't really care, but all of the obvious night quality handmades and lever actions I see must've been duped, and not neccassarily during the duping golden era
---
I don't remember that part, but maybe you're right. That just makes it sadder.
---
Excavator armor + luck hole mine + acid = 1000 lead for 15 mins of work
---
Someone shot me in the back at a train station while I was using the vendor. I then went to where they were and was inside their base. I tossed a large nade inside, didn't Kil them then they came out and killed me. They then left their base, I went back a destroyed the hell out of it.  Maybe I'm lame cause I couldn't kill them, even though they were on some one shot kill bullshit.  However IMO if you shoot someone in the back at a vendor then a destroyed base is only the minimum you deserve
---
Plasma weapons with the sniper barrel + gamma reciever or flaming barrels works for me.
---
I think just showing the death points on map like they do now without the top three markers would be best.
---
Could use the death markers to slueth where the where the top dogs are near, or, where firefights are going down.
---
I was thinking that was the answer. I gave away my excavator then I heard about lucky hole mine and recrafted it. I guess the issue then would be acid
---
So THAT'S what that is. I found it and thought it might be a location for a vault or something.
---
Yes it changes it from lead to acid.... though in the top of the map there is a workshop with 3 acid deposits
---
Yeah I kind of got Screamo vibes from it :\
---
Most heartwarming thing I had was when me and 9 other low lvls ran to Uranium Fever in Survival for weekly quest to get sole survivor then 4 other super high lvls murdered us all and wouldn't let us partake in the event by killing us if we tried to enter the room for Uranium Fever, then once event was over we all ran since we knew they would murder us for the caps which I can proudly say I out ran other 8 players and didn't lose the caps from the event besides ones they murdered out of me earlier.
---
Level 175 checking in. I invite low level players all the time because I have perks that only work when I'm in a group. I have Inspirational level 3 for 15% bonus XP if I'm on a team, and my charisma is high enough that I can share it and my teammates get extra XP too. This is great for power leveling new palyers.
---
I also have Rad Sponge level 3, so if someone drops a nuke and none of my RL friends are online I'll try to team up with a random player so we can both enjoy the nuke without micromanaging our rads.
---
Be my friend on Xbox? 😀 thanks for the info! Really appreciate this
---
Do you know if there are plans to add more trophies/achievements?
---
You still need the proper materials to repair. Some items like the rad shower require flux.
---
I don’t have the technical skills for this in the slightest, but this would be an awesome resource to have.! I hope one day it comes to reality.
---
For sure. Yesterday, I come across this guys camp. I check it out and move on. 2 minutes later, I'm getting pelted by exploding ammo. I turn around and it's the guy. I move along but he just keeps following me shooting me in the back. Finally, I turn around and let him have a shot of my legendary furious dragon. We kill each other, so I head back to his camp and dump about 500 5.56 rounds into his shit. I'm wanted for 200 caps, so I run around waving to everyone I see. Everyone just gives me the finger guns and moves on. 1 dude even helped me kill a scorchbeast and all I wanted was to die..
---
I accidentally bought the harpoon plan and wanted all my caps
---
When you have no weapon on you and you're in the middle of a trade and some guy lays waste to both of you in 1 shot is an exploit. Happened to me this weekend. I also thought it was fixed. That dude found a way around it somehow. That makes me leery that it will only be a matter of time to find an exploit to wreck someones camp.
---
Hey so before you put extra points in slugger or expert slugger you should absolutely pick up master slugger.
---
You get 10% at the 1 point level but less for each additional level of the card.
---
Lock pick and hacker should be passive. Perks just make it easier
---
The pile of wood pieces and rolling pins I looted from three star creatures. Thank goodness Bethesda listened and will let me exchange them for scrip then buy more legendaries with them (laughing uncontrollably).
---
Yeah Yogi the bear needs to chill. I understand that they are mutated bears, but the US Military didn’t create them or use them for war - and the Master didn’t alter Yogi Bears, they altered Deathclaws. Therefore Deathclaw &gt; Yogi The Bear
---
It’s something I have to balance out. Having more cards in my pile VS having better stats
---
Weird I said this same thing, pointing out it was exploiting even the slightest, and I was the asshole and slandered on.
---
I moved my camp 20 feet and plan on selling holotape games in my machine.
---
Yeah, it's very hard to make much about 76 look good.
---
I should have them all, but the game didn't award them
---
Because they never changed the loot pool after adding the plans to the terminal in fort defiance. Queen used to be the only source.
---
Maybe not one shot, maybe 2. I just want to see it shatter power armor in one swing.
---
Im hoping to see players sell dicease cures + fusion cores. I hate power armor and only keep a few cores in stash for sbq sometimes.
---
Drill was my first loot from ISS, then it's been non stop wood legs and arms
---
Buff pistols and add big iron in, a perfect match
---
Those legs tho D:
---
Does losing equipment to Feed the People count?
---
Legendary Camp has mutated into floating legendary camp? Theres lore for the mutant creatures and bugged code for the floating buildings with ZERO foundations.
---
Oh man that sucks!
---
&gt;Im assuming this is an intended game mechanic?
---
more like an oversight.
---
&gt;Is it recommended to run survival on a team, or at least have a wing man?
---
it's better, yes. but not necessary. with SiN you can do some pretty silly things.
---
&gt;Any tips would be greatly appreciated.
---
DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT listen to anyone saying that survival is "unplayable" due to TSE weapons and sentinel armor.
---
I mean no offense, but Fallout players are mostly singleplayers. they just can't perform in a competitive environment. they assume they can just hop in with their ill-built adventure character and tackle survival as if they were fighting scorched. that's not how it works. I mean, most of these people actually invest heavily in weight reduction perks.
---
you can be successful in survival with regular equipment. yes, op legendaries like sentinel and \*not\* TSE give people an advantage, but you don't need that advantage. first, bloodied is a no-no for the most part. second, go with a vats-critical full auto build. your weapon of choice should be a handmade or a radium if you're crazy. and most importantly, **always have a healthy supply of stealthboys**. you'll be popping them every other minute.
---
to deal with TSE sentinels just crit them in the head. that's it. if they're invisible themselves, sneak up to them (literal sneak, no game sneak) and power attack with a power fist, which should be your secondary main weapon. rad weapons (radium but mainly gamma guns) also work. or just spam a combat shotgun with enforcer equipped, that's actually a nice sidearm.
---
My bad, I just assumed Death Metal was like Black Metal ramped up a level ://
---
Some friends of mine like to raid players while in survival by assaulting their Workshops then going after the player, and you’d be surprised how much junk people just decide to risk carrying around. Like, how full is you Stash that you need to carry around 500 adhesive, 1000 Steel, etc
---
Indeed. I regularly prune my junk drawer of excess, and I've never kept more than 100 adhesive. Now I keep 50 of it, because I just don't use that much.
---
Can’t tell if sarcasm? Sheepsquatch goes down as soon as he comes out of his hole...
---
Yeah. It really doesn't look anything like an actual [nuclear silo](http://rbase.new-factoria.ru/sites/default/files/missile/topol_m/spu.jpg). The hatch itself is fine, but the giant metal UFO-like structure around it sticks out like a sore thumb.
---
In real life like they're meant to be hidden and easy to miss. They stick out like sore thumbs once you see them in game.
---
I have over 20 fake "cheater" and "unsporting" reports (each) on Xbox that resulted from me taking some jerkoff's bag after killing him or watching him die while trying to kill me.
---
You can go into the social menu on the map and select them and then fast travel to teammate, as well.  You can also fast travel for free to their camp by just hovering over it like any other location.
---
They look like they're in a metal band whereas you look like you're releasing an album of Bing Crosby covers.
---
I also can't help but notice a lot of the people who have lost something have a mule char, probably just a coincidence.
---
i also get a lot of people that come up to you while you are trading with a vendor, and immediately start attacking you, because they want to sell to the vendor
---
if anything that just makes me take longer at the vendor to spite them
---
They don’t have a projectile anymore. Part of the fix they implemented due to the fact that plasma weapons had massive hit detection issued since they were actual projectiles, not hitscan weapons.
---
Or maybe have my pet spawn in again since its still taking up budget. I lowered my charisma for other perks and it took my pet away, but I never gained budget from it.
---
I’m excited. I’m tired of worrying about greifers and I hate other players chasing me out of their CAMPs when I just wanted to look around. :-(
---
To be honest, I'm going to have a vending machine, not because I have a lot to see, but because I want people to check out my sweet builds.
---
Hopefully i'm wrong here, but does that mean if you have a workshop, a malicious player can initiate PVP by starting to take your workshop, then fast travel to your CAMP (now conveniently marked on the map thanks to having a vendor) and wreck it?
---
My CAMP has never had any issues with hostile players (i assume due to being well away of any normal path), i wonder if this may cause issues if say i have a vendor at my my camp while i'm farming power cores at a power station.
---
We could have a bulking mechanism and only be able to sell it in bulk.
---
Bring on the fishing boss! Man I want fishing so bad. And giant mutated catfish to fight
---
They do, all the time. The other day I got over 20 of pretty much every bulk from some guy at a workshop. He was apparently muling. LOL
---
My worst accidental bug was when I bought the bomber outfit for some crazy amount of atoms I think I was either 1200 or 800 atoms
---
Did you have a workshop?
---
I agree 100% some bugs are just unacceptable
---
Did you or your teammate have a workshop? That will initiate PVP anywhere on the map. Or if a teammate hit the guy that killed you, or one of his teammates will initiate PVP. and as far as getting one shot, if you are flagged for pvp for whatever reason, you can still get oneshot. there is no mechanic to prevent it. 99% if all cases where people are saying there was a glitch and they got oneshot outside of pvp, one of the 2 situations I mentioned were involved.
---
I have yet to move to a good location and make my CAMP look inviting as anyone's else because I have no good CAMP items unlike you guys.
---
I thought FC Beacon was a cardboard standee pointing at a campfire
---
The public workshop section to my CAMP is what I am most proud of.  I also got a little spot ready for the player vending machine.  It is hard to describe but it is a two-story room connected to my quarters that is pretty compact but looks like it has everything a person could need.
---
They banned the most egregious dupers, but many people got away with it because they didn't go too overboard. There was no way for BGS to tell whether your stack of 40,000 canned coffee, nuka cola quantums, etc., was legit or not. AFAIK they only went after people that had hundreds of thousands of these.
---
More visitors! Should be fun.
---
This is a fantastic idea, I would love to see it happen
---
I have a main breaker on my generator that I toggle to get them working again.
---
Setting mine up at whitesprings and selling ammo, flux, food and junk
---
I have a powerfist with a 40% swing speed boost, the suppressors legendary effect and 90% reduced weight. I threw an armor piercing attachment on it and have the max rank of iron fist, couple that with adrenaline and after a couple kills I can one or two shot most normal enemies and take down the beefier ones pretty quickly
---
that is also true. it kinda looks like a massive metal plank anyway so I guess I just never thought of it as outrageously long as it really is.
---
Weightless now is a very useful legendary effect.
---
I was ready for some lame list of wanted bug fixes for nit picky things (like many lists are), but you pretty much nailed the exact problems that I would have listed as well.   Well done.     Agreed on all points 1 - 15.
---
Re: bug 9. Data miners report that the “broken” rad resist pieces are actually meant to be disease resist, but it’s still broken and doesn’t add that either. There’s two different effects, but they both are labeled “rad resist”, but the script for one is actually a (broken) disease resist script
---
Hyperbolic? No. I am going off the memory of my childhood when my dad got us Fallout 1 from a bargain bin at the commissary when I was like 11 or 12. Deathclaws shattered my world view.
---
Definitely. It sucks 'cos the Free States are one of the more interesting factions and have basically not been mentioned outside of the main quest.
---
Yesterday I moved mine two floorspaces to the left. There was some grass poking through the floor that was bugging the shit out of me.
---
I just had to die. that's an annoying bug.
---
Yes !!!
---
Been a while since I was level 10 or less, but I'm not sure I had even that many caps at that point in my life.
---
Even unmodded, a berserker's or instigating weapon would be great for a beginner.
---
I'd think twice about selling an explosive shotty to a new player though, not a great new player experience to blow yourself up repeatedly ;-)  But I've got a couple 4x ammo pipe guns and the berserker's that I'm sure would be excellent help.
---
I mean, yeah, they're the ones moving things around the most.
---
you'll only ever notice something missing on login/fast travel. an important detail I forgot to mention.
---
that's because fast travel works the same as in Fo4, it saves/refreshes your character. so if you had an item disappear after a fast travel, it wasn't really caused by the ft itself, but rather something you did prior to it that caused the item to be dropped, sold or scrapped, and it was only completely removed from your inventory when the client resynced with the server on ft.
---
Absolutely, have a whole bunch of those. When I add lighter build mod they literally weigh 0.
---
In regards to 4 and 8. 
---
4) there are trade offs already in place, with a bloodied set up you have low health and not much in the way of sustaining what you do have, but damage is insane, vanguard is the exact opposite, wicked high health with major sustainability without the super high amount of damage. Bloodied isn't for the faint of heart, I die alot, like alot alot, but knocking scorchbeasts out in 2 whacks is what I want to do.
---
8) nobody is being punished by the cap reset. If you can't cover your fast travel fees by what you loot off of enemies you're doing it wrong or you aren't searching. Every time I fast travel I can break even of cut a profit just from what I pick up off most enemies, especially super mutants, pretty sure they were congressmen before fev got them.
---
I agree with most everything else though, well thought out and well written Imo.
---
Mine seemed to work a lot better after hooking a computer terminal.   There is an option to control targets.
---
Too late....
---
Ahhh shit...forgot about that one. After reading that note I kinda hung around that tower for a bit, checking out all the stuff they left behind and imagining a day in the life of an old couple making the best of a world gone to shit, because at least they had each other.
---
its called survival dumbass
---
No ider, but i can offer you 500 caps for it, i need a ledg. flamethrower :)
---
Also looking for a ledgn. Cryo ...

second play thru 1-50 was rough with a x01 saved!

\*ding-dong\* "Good morning. Do you have a moment to talk about our lord and savior, Chairman Mao?
---
I'll give you tree-fitty.
---
i agree 100%
---
I love trying to figure out how to break into locked bases without breaking anything.
---
I just wish the repair kits weighed nothing. I'm already at 60+. I have so many I don't know what to do with them.
---
I am missing the „Reach Lv 10“ and  one from Rose but just because I got them on the BETA.
---
Home defender, weapon artisan, super duper, and ammosmith should all be unequipped until you’re crafting or repairing. Replace ammosmith and home defender with adrenaline for more damage or an agility perk that helps avoid damage, or do both and have them at level 2 each
---
Seeing Madigan’s corpse hanging from the cage at the Ski Resort. Knowing the struggle he was going through to literally save Appalachia and possibly even the entire country, only to be tortured and killed like a dog by some ignorant, opportunistic raiders. 
---
Rose extorting you in order to get the one scrap of information you need to continue your quest was just insult to injury.
---
I wish you could place them anywhere in game.  Imagine the commie poster bombs that could happen
---
Yea I usually try to put my weapons away before I fast travel or craft anything. Hopefully that helps super paranoid lol.
---
Had an exterminator cryolator but sold it as it was terrible. I did like how the name rhymed.
---
Like someone said, always scrap your junk before putting it in your stash box to keep the weight down.
---
When picking perks, keep in mind that you stop being able to point more points into SPECIAL  at level 50 (so you can't be level 105 and have 15 SPECIAL across the board) you only have those 50 points to work with so you have to figure out what's important to you and what you just can't justify putting points into. My final build only has 1 Charisma, 1 Endurance because I prioritize having points into perception, agility, and luck.
---
Keep in mind the levels of your weapons and armor. When you hit level 10, you want to start swapping out your weapons to the lv 10 versions and scrapping or selling your lv 5 versions.
---
If you're using a type of weapon/armor and want to continue using them, loot every one of them you find and scrap it. That's how you learn mods to improve them. 
---
If a higher level is jumping up and down shooting at a paper bag at their feet, they're trying to give you a gift
---
That's... really friggen creative. Eventually they could win a fight against any base, given enough time through constant healing.
---
Yup. If you look at the trade subreddits, you’ll see occasional posts from high end traders who basically have every “best” item except for a handful of specific legendary combos on different pieces... and they’re willing to trade what they have to get those pieces. Why would you want to lose one piece of your collection and gain a different piece... unless you could actually have multiple of what you already have? They’re just trying to get literally 1 of everything so they can dupe anything, on demand.
---
based on what they said, you're not really dealing 325 damage though. it's around double that. and there will be a massive reduction once the patch hits.
---
their wording was kinda confusing and I'm worried about shotguns myself. but seeing as how well they perform in a bloodied sneak/crit build, there's always hope.
---
It is.
---
But we casual so it’s okay to use whatever.
---
I’m using this idea!!! Fo76 geocaching time!!!!

This is like playing Dark Souls 3 without an ember, Wimps.

---
Some group of guys harassed a friend of mine. Me and another dude tried to kill them. I lost about 600 caps but my other friend was able to kill a guy and take stable flux, over 30 screws and 20 black titanium scrap, etc. Not as much as you got, but he hit the jackpot with that flux.
---
I think, in part, this is the reason for player vending machines.
---
Removes the middleman, you dont have to be present, and you get your desired payment.  
---
As a buyer, you get what you see, not what the other person decides to drop, or quicky change price, or however else the scam works.
---
Barring a server crash in the middle of the transaction, its probably about as safe as you can get.
---
Just because he got downvotes and you got upvotes, doesn't give you the right to be over-confident
---
I keep saying I'm gonna put time into my camp but then Uranium Fever is up and I'm distracted.
---
I do as well, but I still find myself in situations where I burn through all of one of them (or more) because I realize that I don't have any mods learned for some new thing I pick up.
---
Then again, I inevitably find out that I don't learn any mods after crafting a bunch of them, only to find out there aren't any mods to learn.  I *really* need to look that up beforehand :P
---
I'm not going to move my camp I have a pretty sweet spot with great views.
---
I've already set up a little area of my camp ready for player vending, going to specialise in plans and recipes as I have an absolute ton spare of them lol
---
I made the mistake of previously having my camp at the whitesprings.
---
What's crazy is that, this was introduced a few patches ago. You used to be able to scrap all without scrapping bulk. Idk why they haven't fixed it because a lot of people made note of it
---
Seems like a possibility, but nobody can really answer this until tomorrow.
---
Confucius say "Man who go to bed with itchy butt wake up with stinky finger..."
---
When i was a low level a bunch of dudes invited me into a team and gave me some cool stuff for my camp. I still haven't changed it. Also this one guy gave me a lot of tse weapons and i almost didn't have to pay anything
---
I've not heard a thing either. If it's any longer I'll have to change my delivery address as my lease runs out soon
---
Yes indeedy.
---
People here seem to think it won't affect things but I really think it will. It's a lot easier to just set a price and forget it, than it is to come make a thread on Reddit and hustle to get your item sold. Only really top-shelf items won't be affected, but I bet you'll see prices start to go down for lesser items and fusion cores and stuff.
---
Only durable enough to fend off a dozen scorched, so yes laser's durability still suck. They need to last at least 5x longer to be comparable to conventional weapons. That's why you don't see them in queen fights, and if someone used it, he likely won't get any loot because the weapon will be broken long before he could put in enough damage.

That is good to know! Thanks

Thanks! I'm currently working on a program to accurately and completely map resource locations. But annoyingly putting them over that tourists' map you get is making the accuracy of the mapping less helpful.

---
Yes, I like to stop in and visit Murgle. Yesterday around sunset I snapped a photo of him napping on sunny spot of his couch. First time I saw that, as I usually visit when the sun is not at thy angle.
---
No. I jumped on the server to make a trade with the guy and we never teamed up. He might have had one but I just entered and the only thing we had going is he was on my friends list. Ive had people get pissy and shoot me and just mocked them because no slap damage. Saturday though that guy knew the exploit. Apparently doing it to the entire server because his bounty was like 500 caps. Ive heard of it happening and didn't believe it. Im a believer today.
---
Yeah it sucks 😭. There really should be something to stop it.
---
can do, butchers bounty, along with green thumb and you'll never want for food.
---
Ouch, that really sucks. 😕
---
There is a silver lining I guess: with the latest 'absolutely max weight' limit there is only so much canned coffee you can store and if they are burning through it and more cannot be duped eventually they will run out.
---
Is fairly uncommon unless you have an army of minions using 'Can Do' on every container over and over again.
---
Halloween Candy however... The wretched thing is weightless.
---
As much as it aggrieves me to add weight to stuff maybe is time to do it, even if is temporarily?
---
The tokens from Lode Baring have weight; arguably you need an order of magnitude less of them si maybe make them weight 0.05? I don't know if that resolves anything.
---
In all honesty PvP is a rabbit hole for me.
---
I found it to be miserable and wasn't able to complete it. :D
---
Oh, I got that part.  I especially liked the part where he hid in the bathroom long enough to shoot someone in the back while they were stuck in vendor windows.  And people wonder why survival isn't doing so hot.  But honestly, the best part is watching you get triggered from someone else getting called out for bragging about being a coward and a thief.  But please, justify it however you like.
---
It's surprising they haven't added this in like the laminates for floors in the Atom Shop
---
I have noticed the same, coverage has gone from "this game is a flaming shitheap" to "This game's not bad, but here is a problem", which is a great deal more reasonable.
---
I mean, you can’t fight in the water, so at best You’re looking at amphibious enemies who come out to fight you
---
This is the hardline extreme away from me.
---
I saw a nice C.A.M.P. in the Mire and literally spent ten minutes scaling a tree so I could go through their second story balcony/platforms to look inside because the front door was locked.
---
lol yeah, but a furious cryo would probably be nice, not into bloodied and stuff like that, my alt isn't build for it and i don't pvp :)
---
Yeah. Gets annoying having to put on Scrapper, Ammosmith, Super Duper, Weapon Artisan, and Armorer after a good day of blast zones.
---
I think it’s luck.
---
When both of those are full, which has happened a few times , I use the cash register next to the Flatwoods vendor bot
---
I thought that too and kinda assumed we would see it eventually. Probably will cost about the same as the laminates
---
Equip the armorer 3 perk, take out every piece of armor in your stash, and add the (ultra) light build mod to them. Easy way to clear up some junk, and take a couple hundred lbs of weight off the armor
---
Someone get this guy some Big Iron
---
Bruhhh i feel you on a spiritual level
---
I would advise not to bother doing this. L50 power armor spawns all over when you are L50. Don't even waste the 10lbs per frame.  
---
When it comes time for you to get serious about being a PA user you will have someone craft a set for you.
---
Some perks should be permanent/passive.
---
If I've tamed creatures in the past (they've died since) is the budget permanently showing them there?
---
I am FOR saved perk card setups. (Or at least an easier way than having to switch things like lock picking on and off.)
---
However, I have wondered. If it gets too easy to switch between setups, then isn't it basically like allowing you to have all perks armed at the same time? If you can functionally have max level everything at your fingertips then why even make it so you can't arm all the cards at once in the first place?
---
Would it make more sense to divide perks into two different categories? Like passive (always on and not bound by special cap,) and active (bound by special cap so u can only have so many armed at once.)
---
While they make camps indestructible, they should also mark certain areas free fire zones (such as WS golf lawn) where any camp in those areas can be freely destroyed by others. Build your camp in those area at your own risk. Without this you'll see tons of turret camps around WS in no time.
---
Damn alright, thanks anyway!
---
hahahaha :)
---
Yeah, oneshotting power armor pieces sounds like hacks to me. Granted, I don’t PVP, but in PVE I go weeks without having to repair a piece of armor.
---
I don't think the vending machines will manage tradings, and if they manage just caps, there will be allways the problem of the 25k cap limit.
---
pics or it didn't happen.
---
You have to go there to buy it, but you can see what categories of items they have on the map, iirc.
---
I took a pic. This group doesn’t let me post pics though. LAME!
---
Look up one of the million similar posts just try it and form your own opinion
---
I wouldn’t be surprised if a dupe exploit still existed, however if there is one it is definitely not nearly as bad as the old ones. People would dupe something thousands of times and crash servers before, and going near some players who were carrying thousands of duped items would tank your FPS or just disconnect you from the server. Haven’t seen anything like that in awhile so if there is one it’s probably a small scale exploit and someone’s well kept secret. Until they get banned and post 30 things here about how they’re innocent
---
I would assume so too
---
The unfortunate thing is that somebody claiming your workshop will remove that protection, regardless of your pacifism.
---
There are still bugs,but not really game breaking bugs and it's still pretty fun solo
---
Do some dead NPC’s have scripts? Like can you revive them through console commands and they’ll walk around?
---
There are a lot of opinions on it both good and bad. Read back through the posts, questions like this get asked daily.
---
I wish they would spend some time working on the server drops.     It is absolutely ridiculous.  Losing time and caps everytime, eg....setting up a workshop for resources only to be bumped shortly after.   Exciting about player vending yes.
---
Uhh... I'd say more "[Christian Rock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aXIEhuWsr8)." (Sorry for potato quality, all I could find quickly)
---
Yeah. My friend's base got demolished just yesterday. Only thing I need to lock now is my copper extractor.
---
Pvpers: Nerf assassin cav/sent!
---
Bethesda: nerfs assassin, sent, cav, bloodied, AA, instigating, explosive again, stims, first aid perk, bear arms perk, class freak perk, and some other random stuff nobody talked about.
---
I had a story once when my friend who was low level was attacked by a bunch a high level Aholes and destroyed his small house. Me and my other friend went to help him and kicked their asses out the ball park. Finally glad that they’re adding this. F*ck griefers. They deserve a special place in hell.
---
Yeah but invicible player camp is great I can lock in griefers and force them to leave the server.
---
this is the problem. Once spawned, it is just another land beast.
---
The main problem isn’t that sentinel, assassins, cavaliers, unyielding and the other one is good it’s that they are the only good legendaries for PvP armor so you don’t get much choice between stand still build or constant run build. Then again sentinel and cavaliers both have their counters, such as staggering and sheer power. My point is that nerfing sentinels, assassins and others isn’t the correct way to go, they need to make better legendaries instead of nerfing the existing ones.
---
I buy only if its something I want and only if I have enough ATOMS from challenges.
---
That way, over priced doesn't factor in.
---
for some yes for others no personally i have 800 hours and love it.
---
Facts
---
If you're part of a team and your teammate initiated combat with him, you're also in combat with him.
---
I have lit up arrows showing how to get in through the front gate, via a button on the ground.. and a secret entrance via underwater. If they get it before the 6 flamethrower traps, 8 Tesla arks, and radiation traps go off.. well, they shouldn't be so trusting.
---
With melee you want more cards, there are too many important cards that need attention, like incisor to ignore it.
---
Have you tried turning it off and back on again?
---
but seriously, a switch makes this process easier.
---
The irony is that Ultracite and X-01 are the 2 PA sets that are easy to get the plans for, but mods are very hard to come by. T-51 is a great set, minus the low rad resist, but you can make up for that with diulated rad-x and rad shield.
---
I have a lot of bobble heads and magazines I'm looking forward to getting rid of.
---
o\_o we... can have two?
---
If the pet you tamed had died and not respawned, their budget space should be removed when you relog, giving you space back
---
Mild inconvenience at best, I'll just store my vending machine if I want to take a workshop.
---
Taking someone else's dropped loot is the biggest dick move IMO. When you're in PVP sure that's fine, but just taking your fallen comrade's bag in the golf club? That's low.
---
Though I do have to mention that it's not really their fault for respawning the ghouls. Fast traveling and entering an area does not respawn anything. Supposedly it's only if you're logging in and spawning in, and you can't really blame someone for just logging on, not to say this guy isn't a douche canoe.
---
I think my favorite moments at the golf course are when you form an unspoken agreement with someone to work together instead of flying through hoping to outrun them to kill everything first. Yesterday me (a rifle build) and some random (melee build) cleared our way through whitesprings with him running in and hitting the ghouls once, and me shooting them from afar to finish them off. Bethesda for sure has made some questionable decisions, but I believe that the community as a whole is more full of good people than bad.
---
What system are you on? I'm drowning in screws on PS4 and can pass some along
---
If I were to dump/sell all my weapons and armor that I don't want and am just saving for vending/script, I'd have more than enough stash space.
---
I know people want to have backup/different weapons just in case, and a couple different sets of armor isn't out of the question.  But when you're hoarding 25 different bloodied weapons because they're too good to get rid of, even though you'll likely never switch your build any time in the foreseeable future...it's time to just let them go.
---
The only way to be 100% sure you wont lose them is to drop them off the side of Seneca Point. 
---
As my grandmammy always said; "you can't lose, what you don't have"!
---
Do creatures have an armor rating? I ignored it because I don’t fight players
---
repost from a thread just now:
---
&gt;I believe items disappear due to server (de)sync. what you're seeing on your end, the client side, isn't what the server is seeing. and of course the server information trumps yours to avoid cheating.
---
&gt;for example, say you press R/square to reload. that's also the key used to drop items. except the server thinks you have the pipboy open when you actually don't, at least on the client side. so it performs the action bound to the R/square key while on the pipboy, drop whatever is highlighted.
---
&gt;this is of course just an example. essentially, it applies to anything that moves items around, maybe even the favorites wheel. **what I did was rebind reload to the F key and physically remove the R key from my keyboard**. I also avoid moving things to and from my stash and vendors.
---
&gt;you'll only ever notice something missing on login/fast travel. an important detail I forgot to mention.
---
&gt;that's because fast travel works the same as in Fo4, it saves/refreshes your character. so if you had an item disappear after a fast travel, it wasn't really caused by the ft itself, but rather something you did prior to it that caused the item to be dropped, sold or scrapped, and it was only completely removed from your inventory when the client resynced with the server on ft.
---
of course, I can't guarantee my "method" works.
---
I don't think anyone knows. That's what's makes it such a boogeyman. There's little known about how to replicate the bug; or even to prove that it wasn't a drop, sale, or scrap player error. We can only hope that Bethesda knows more based upon support tickets and under-the-hood information.
---
That's you being entitlted and deliberately taking words out of context. It doesn't read "There will be 10 years of content in the initial release." Again, your fault. Use your brain and stop being dramatic. This also isn't some linear story game. No one told you to ignore everything else the game has and to defeat the big bad boss in five minutes. The story is short on purpose: it isn't a story-driven game. 
---
You're making me sound like a Bethesda fanboy, but I just want to be clear: your complaints are stupid. Make real ones and I'll agree with you. Like the beta remark. That's accurate.
---
yeah i thought that is what we were talking about?
---
i thought it also had a poster of the cat running for president and a stash box
---
Most people on PS4 just build the floating shoebox anyway, so that kills all excitement over visiting peoples camps. The only immersive camps I've seen have been made by friends.
---
Mmmk. Good to know. Thank you.
---
It’s fine that they’re in the game, the problem is that they don’t give you a counter other than staggering cancels both sentinels and cavaliers. So the correct solution would be to make better legendaries instead of nerfing the existing ones.
---
lol ok
---
My camp is by the Whitespring station and I load into nuke zones all the time. It won’t destroy your house unless the nuke touches down once you’re loaded in. Sucks though, I’ve had mine destroyed by a nuke a couple times
---
&gt; If you're trying to shoot something with a high-end explosive gun that does a lot of damage, sometimes your splash damage is enough to kill a low level turret or basic shack wall if it happens to be near to what you're trying to kill. 
---
Not if you have pacifist on. Always have pacifist on. Those guys were dicks but that move was still quite smart.
---
The tape from the lady trapped in the supply closet in the Morgantown Airport comes to mind. Or the chem addicts and former raider in flatwoods who talks about all the horrible shit that happened for her and her ex boyfriend.
---
U/yaboidannytanner we were messaging about this the other day. Seems to still be some prevalent duping in the game.
---
That wasn’t my point I’m saying that they shouldn’t nerf it not that they can’t. Besides the few legendaries there isn’t a good PvP choice.
---
If you've enjoyed the gameplay aspects of fallout 4 then you'll like this one too, you don't need to play with other people but it's fun. Though it still has a lot of bugs. Perhaps there are less bugs compared to the launch version but compared to other games it has a ridiculous amount of bugs, like honestly it's insane. I still love the game though.
---
k.
---
I'm doing just fine exploring anywhere and everywhere on my level 40 heavy weapons/melee character that has no tse weapons. I rarely die at all.
---
I’m just curious what makes you feel the Stash is safer than on your character? 
---
I’ve renamed my key armor and weapons and feel I’d rather risk having them on me. 
---
The only time I’ve ever lost a weapon was in a crash to desktop in the process of dropping a bagged legendary weapon I had just repaired and modded for a friend.
---
There is a difference between minorly inconveniencing someone and completely destroying their base and continuing to harass them. Some people put a lot of work into their base even if it might not impress others.
---
Or they can fast travel? Lol
---
Wasteland Whisperer gives you 1, and animal friend gives you another. I’ve never gotten two at a time but I’ve seen it before. Some creatures can be tamed by either perk while others can only be tamed by 1
---
Why sell it back when I got great use out of it? I was able to fix up/mod everything I have and still have plenty left over.
---
I actually got a 3\* 50 Cal from the Imposter.  I don't remember what kind it was, but it was a good drop.  I ended up giving it to a teammate though because I don't use them.  I've also gotten both a 2\* &amp; 3\* Instigating Grognak's Axe from it, which I do use as i'm a melee character.  The rest have been random armor pieces.
---
Well you're not wrong
---
Nobody is forcing you to do anything, man. If you enjoy the game just enjoy it, why are you being all prissy while justifying yourself here?
---
Self control?
---
Bruh... I’m lvl 105 and I’ve never known this. All the potential loot passed without notice.
---
\*loud whisper\* I don't think they know about the whole "Atoms for Sale" thing.
---
Agree 💯
---
if I'm right, they're more prone to be dropped, sold or scrapped if non-legendary.
---
then again, I've heard reports of people losing their entire stash. so there's that.
---
Sneak + Escape Artist. Those two things plus your already high agility from the unyielding armor makes you basically invisible. Maybe add some of the stealth based armor mods if you have them unlocked.
---
Enemies can't hit what they can't see.
---
I'm a softie? I had no idea playing the game and just ignoring trolls meant I was soft. Also didnt know a wannabe raider had a horse in this race.
---
&gt; 7.99
---
Too high.
---
Yeah but you are still getting less in the end since those items cost a lot more
---
Like 1200 for a skin? Doesn’t that equate to roughly £10/£12? (Not sure about dollars)
---
I work 5 days a week and I do care about what my income goes on. If I could get more for those points I would’ve spent a lot by now. It’s sad they’ve chosen this disastrous economic model for this game. They’re pushing people away
---
This is very helpful, thank you!
---
I was weak, I admit it, had to have the Nukashine paint set as soon as I saw it. That said, I don’t think there’s any way Bethesda’s Atonic shop will ever get me to drop real coin. I’ll spend in-game atoms, but that’s it.
---
I'd love this.
---
Give me this anyday over someone destroying my base.
---
the problem i have with the crossbow is there are no mods for it the devs could have made this a truly awesome thing to have. poison bolt, exploding tips hell a scope would be nice, its just to plan. imo
---
I know nothing of the sort.
---
Boring.
---
Considering this is Reddit, and 100% of the people on here are shit, I'm gonna go ahead and safely assume the OP is just a piece of shit. People should really be required to post videos of things like this.
---
So you like this guy taking a piss on everything else until he starts taking a piss on something you like?
---
Nice.
---
I've dropped $20 on the store. Really don't see the big deal. You shouldn't have the mindset that you need everything.
---
East of Harper's Ferry, atop the cliffs are a couple and their dog. The dog is still alive. And it's sad as fuck. Every once in a while I stop by to drop off some canned dog food.
---
In the forest, there's a lookout tower with a skeleton and a bunch of baby toys and stuff in the tower. At the base of the tower is a grave, the name of the baby spelled out with wooden blocks. I accidently looted the blocks the first time I found it and felt like a huuuuuuge piece of shit
---
I didn't ask you to prove that you have helped other players. I'd just like to know where, exactly, the more detailed explanation presented below is incorrect.
---
Well because in all of the cases i've heard of the weapons usually get lost while fast traveling or trading or even repairing.
---
The nuke zone was already active by the time i loaded in, it had already been around for an hour as I loaded in on my friend. Still broke everything.
---
Upload to imgur, put the link in the body of the text post. Ezpz.
---
We may have been in the same session once, as I found several plans in the overseer stashes over the course of a game session. I keep going back hoping for more ;) And have started doing the same when I find them.
---
Yes. Also, without the benefit of perks extending it's shelf life.
---
I hoard so much many junk items because when I stop picking up or crafting things is when I go from 300 adhesive/springs/screws/ to zero and I have no idea where it all went.
---
After fast traveling, someone said, "Hey, you're missing your arm." Yup. Power armor arm gone. Luckily easy to re-craft. 
---
I cannot prove that I didn't scrap, sell, or drop it, but if I did, it was the first mistake I didn't realize at the time it occurred. 
---
The reports are getting to frequent to ignore.
---
&gt; I like this guy but u don’t like him taking a piss on my interest
---
Why are you wasting time rationalising with someone with a mentality like that?
---
I think you mean professional virgin
---
Oof. Being called a piece of shit because I took junk out of a deatjbag and didnt return it? Are you the guy I ran into last night? I bet you are.
---
I haven't played in a while... have they increased the build limit yet? Or are there plans to do so?
---
I totally agree. Crossbows are a unique weapon in terms of customization. I’m not too caught up with the Fallout news but I’m pretty sure there’s an archery update coming up which could add to the crossbow. Even without mods I’m having a great fun with it though
---
It spoils in the stash, hopefully there a fridge on the way for vending.
---
Are you playing in a group?  The problem with a support build like that is... it needs someone to support. The game expects everyone to be able to hold their own in combat. If you don’t have combat (damage) perks... you’re gonna have a bad time.
---
Spoils in a heartbeat. Not worth it.
---
Yeah that’s what I thought. Thanks
---
I've taken a lot of great pictures showcasing fantastic views especially one of the forest where it's nothing but fall trees. Can see Landview Lighthouse and Top of the World but my god, it is beautiful.
---
Dang that sucks, I guess I'll just sell alot of water then
---
They absolutely do
---
Bloodied weapon, unyielding armor with +1 strength as a 2nd legendary effect. Even better if the weapon also had increased swing speed or power attack damage, and +1 STR.
---
Perks: 
---
STR: 9 points into the correct damage perks for the weapon (punching, 1h or 2h). Incisor, martial artist. Having all these requires level 15 STR.
---
Endurance: Radicool. Up to +5 STR when radiation bar is filled
---
Perception isn't needed, unless you want to use VATS.
---
Charisma: Lone wanderer and Tenderizer
---
Agility: Adrenaline. Adrenaline. Adrenaline. Could add Dodgy but I think it's annoying.
---
Intelligence: Nerd rage is sweet, but being below 20% hp in pvp is dangerous. Add weapon artisan to further increase damage by repairing weapons to 200%.
---
Luck: Bloody mess, starched genes, serendipity, class freak.
---
Mutations: Twisted muscles and adrenal reaction. Add marsupial, grounded and speed demon for extra fun without real downsides.
---
Keep hp below 50%. Preferably around 20%.
---
Rek.
---
Disclaimer: I may or may not have forgotten about a few things.
---
The same could be said, and was said, about another player's camp. The game could be programmed to look for nuke zones.
---
Iys better with mods 😉 i have old archive,that works afrer last 3 patches 😉 but without some textures
---
So the weapons are safe in the stash? Having awesome weapons but not being able to use them. Oh Bethesda
---
Right, but if he can easily rebuild everything \*except one rad shower\* I feel like this is a moot point. Press the button, rebuild everything except for your one fancy item, everything's pretty similar to how it was before.
---
THe lower level you are, then more likely you will die, especially if you are not in level appropriate areas.  Its a learning curve :)
---
Discovering what weapon works best on which critter will go a long way to reducing death rates, too.
---
Camp related stuff is fluff, you don't really need it.  I don't   
---
 remember the last time I was at my camp.
---
the "find extra" perks (except green thumb) are useful at low level, but eventually you will collect so much stuff you wont need them much.
---
I like good doggy.  3x health per can, plentiful, never spoils, no other food source required.
---
If you are in PA, batteries included to reduce the weight of cores.
---
glowsight3.  Especially useful in nuke zones.
---
martial arts for swing speed
---
bloody mess 3 - 15% damage
---
super duper, ammosmith. (crafing only, sswap out otherwise) 
---
green thumb (great when gathering flux)
---
fireproof.  Helps when the SB sonic attacks you
---
ghoulish - radiation heals.
---
Rifle perk or two for either extra damage or armor penetration.
---
I keep lockpick 3 loaded all the time,  I should swpa out as needed, but sometimes, I'm just lazy :)
---
If you run solo most of the time, you dont need much in charisma - just lone wander and tenderizer.   Keep hard bargain (and grape mentats)  on hand for better prices, swap out as needed.
---
Actiongirl/boy for faster AP regen - especially important if you are regularly overencumbered.
---
L78, and have never been into vats.
---
I did not have a workshop
---
So melodramatic. You were honestly crushed? You couldn't even play anymore? Douche-nozzles? What are you 8?
---
I appreciate this post.
---
That’s so weird, I’ve never experienced that. Well that sucks, sorry for your loss.
---
For what it worthes, I am using it since it has been released, amongst  other QoL mods, I never had any issue or warning or ban.
---
Keep in mind that mods are work \*because\* the game framework actually allows them (even is they are not supported per se).
---
Upvote!
---
That more reasurring cause i bassically want it for event reasons (FireWorks) to help embrance in the festivities and with the ammo increase with crafting i can make and use it more. Woohoo
---
Then I’d know to avoid enemies with rolling pins and tire irons lol.
---
That's why I lock the door to my bedroom
---
I find it really stupid that we use acid to "smelt" metal. We have all this advanced stuff we can build, yet to get viable metals, we have to dig up ore and then dump acid on it. How does that make any sense? Metals are not resistant to acid. How does this refine metal?
---
Further, how is it that we can break down steel scrap to be used for all kinds of other things from weapons and armor, yet we can't build a furnace and refine ore there? Let me build smelting furnaces and dump all of my ore into there. Hell make it take a while to work - that's fine. I'll let it run at camp and do other things.
---
And finally - if the above isn't an option, can we at least get larger collectors in the workshops that produce more on certain things like acid? I'd take it and hold it if I didn't have to go back and empty it every 30 minutes. If I could hold it for several hours and then empty it out and get 200-300+ acid, that would be worth it.
---
Well fu**. So there's literally nothing i can do. This game...
---
I built my CAMP trying to look inviting to passersby, door is always open to people, if you're on PC I will be opening a Lemonade stand.
---
Same here. I usually can go weeks without repairing my armor. But this dude one shots it from 125% health. That was probably the first time I had said someone ‘devastated’ me
---
I have a ridiculously long list of plans I plan to sell - just need to research the vendor cost (if any) so I can undercut that a little.  Maybe some ammo and a few mods and legendaries, but not until the dust settles and there are no exploits.
---
I am in the boonies, and I plan to boycott any stores that are too in-your-face annoying (WS ones, anything taking over a whole road, *maybe* ones too close to train stations, not too sure about that though).  No reason to be annoying by getting all up in people's business when you can look at a map and see what people have for sale (assuming of course that it actually ends up working that way).
---
I'm in a great location, and won't move just to sell things better.  On the other hand, I *may* have an alt that has a camp on prime real estate that would be open to putting up a billboard advertising *YOUR* camp location, for the right price ;-)
---
So you’ve been subscribing to him for a while bcz you enjoyed his content talking shit about everything else, but the moment he starts talking shut about something you like, you have a problem with it.
---
Yeah, don’t let the door hit your ass on your way out.
---
I was not in a team, I did not have a workshop. Dude kept following me and hitting me with the butt of his gun, then after 10 or so hits it did damage and then he opened up fire on me and killed me.
---
I can't stand those people who use extremely low resistance and health builds but can somehow take on 20 Glowing Ones. Have seen it happen.
---
The quest doesnt end yet and you keep the logs, but you should be able to get the achievement/Trophy. Try listening to all the logs again, just run down the line. If you have them all then it should pop.
---
Big B wants to you get around that by buying another copy of the game to make mule accts... lol just saying... which I would have done myself with just about ANY other company product, but after playing FO4 and now this and knowing how poorly they have done with "upkeep" not happening... I'd have to see them fix the issues that have been asked to be fixed since launch then NOT break ANY of them again on the next "patch or update". For me I don't think this is the worst start, for a game that IMHO noone asked for (meaning FO5 anyone?) But since it's here it should be doing better and it technically is coming along better and faster then FO4 did I guess??? So thats that right?
---
I, for one, welcome our new Cannibal Corpse cover band overlords, the "Scorched Hails."
---
I work 5 days a week also, but what I get in the end makes no difference,  as I buy only what I'm interested in. Since I don't buy ATOM,s how much it costs per ATOM or in total per item makes me no difference.
---
The point is, I'm not spending my income for ATOMS.
---
Laser (well, energy )weapons have a couple issues.
---
Currently they do not benefit from any armor piercing effects.
---
Magazine sizes are weird (automatic lasers get a SMALLER mag size.)
---
They can’t be silenced.
---
Ash piles can’t be searched with butcher’s bounty.
---
Also the sniper variants are strange. I need to play with the laser sniper more; plasma snipers are fairly semi-auto but with smallish magazines. Hit hard though!
---
Are you a software developer by day?
---
Yesterday I saw a new trading post camp all set up next to the Overseer's Camp. There were signs advertising cheap medicine and other gear. I'm hoping I can see that camp again once the vending machines are actually working.
---
Someone who sees through it 😌
---
I get along just fine without them
---
Triggered jesus christ.
---
Sometimes somebody gets worse over time and then theres a breaking point, but you sound like the sort who just yells at people.
---
Killed my first Queen yesterday, too. Very underwhelming...
---
Yeah it happened before up near Grafton dam. Which is why I moved originally.
---
Come at me EdgeLord.
---
It must suck to be you
---
His video topics are always something not so current, bcz he needs time to document and research about said topic. So are you saying he should’ve rushed out a video regarding FO76 during the first week just like any other click-Barry YouTube back then?
---
yes. I tend to toss in any non spoiled stuff and convert it to fertilizer later.
---
Because he didn't do his research and he has stans like you to jump people for him to try to drown dissent :D
---
I’ll upvote your upvote then sir.
---
Well shiney shark I no longer "need" caps, xp, legendaries, and any improvements I can make to my level 200 plus main right now is incremental at best. I tinker with the build and shift things around still but theres no real urgency to that any more. 
---
  I feel like I am most rebuilding america when I repair power plants I have to farm the fusion cores anyway so repairing the power plant gives me free power (so I dont have to farm for screws and gears) 
---
Most of my time spent playing is spent looking for the best way to minimize time crafting and in loading screens. 
---
example i recently experimented with vampire gatling laser and no longer have to farm or craft stims. i carry 3 or so each and sell the rest now. I aslso dont "craft" ammo. I take workshops and passively generate them while I tinker with things on base defense etc. 
---
I have much less I "need" to do and really get to just enjoy the things I like most about 76 more now. I am very tempted to see if i can skip cooking altogether by farming only purified water and the food factory with never spoiling salisbury steak. in the past i have failed at that but now days this are a bit more efficient for me.
---
I use melee and the gatling for everyday encounters and use a legendary 50 cal for bosses.
---
Ansel's holotape hit me. 
---
Lost my mom to cancer several years ago. Anything to do with cancer hits me in a way nothing else does.
---
just drop them
---
Have fun playing in your moms basement.
---
Well you’ll be disappointed with mine XD it’s barebones and rather bland and boring.
---
I actually built my camp near Whitesprings because I was constantly running out of plastic with my shotgun. 
---
Wood I can usually stock back up pretty quickly if I run around in woods for a bit.
---
It’s been so long since I’ve had to worry about running out of lead oil or steel that I would have trouble figuring out where to go to replenish those en mass. 
---
Today I’m very pleased with myself because I did a full repair on my ultracite pa for the first time, and that was an adventure. 😊
---
Thanks to both of you.
---
Massive only refers to a lot of people on one server, otherwise it's just a multiplayer online RPG, which is what 76 is.
---
i dont know you , but i dont like you.
---
im sorry your life is so bad you feel the need to attack people on a video game forum.  at first i felt you were just another ahole on the internet, but the more i thought about it, i actually feel sorry for you.
---
i hope your messed up life gets better so you can be happy as opposed to act like this on video game forums.
---
2 days ago guy show up to my camp. Wanted to buy my two shot minigun(i ask for 750 caps which is a very reasonable price) he says to much caps and then proceeds to start destroying my camp. Me and my friend killed him then hunted him down continuously for an hour till he left the server.
---
Lucky he didn't destroy my rad shower, everything else was easy to repair.
---
Insulting the guy that was on your side bcz you’re to dumb to decipher his comment, nice.
---
I thank new haven church for being so mysterious i had to check every inch of the building and noticed the pews.
---
I started buying mods with just single names not stating what there for thinking i can put them on w.e. wepon or armor.....  Nope
---
So your going to waste alot of resources for little to no gain because most people will leave the server if nuke is inbound on their camp or just rebuild sounds like someone needs a life.
---
\*\*\*in theory
---
another theory I have, based on the fact that this game is essentially the same as Fo4, is that characters with big save files are more prone to being corrupted or losing their stash. remember Skyrim on consoles outright refusing to work after you clocked a certain amount of time? it's pretty much the same.
---
so to be *really* safe what I'd do is create a mule just to stash your valuables.
---
become dev, fix game, play game.
---
Where does Wooby live?
---
Pass 😂
---
Band name - Deathclaw
---
Album name- Raiders of the Scorched Earth
---
I'm sorry I triggered a douche by cringing at a bad pun. It will happen again.
---
Time to put up those 10 missle launcher bases aimed at white spring eh?! 
---
God save us all.
---
fr tho who would buy purified water instead of farming it in their own camps...
---
i just gather a bunch and sell it to an npc vendor for a healthy profit
---
geez, you offered a very reasonable price, that guy was probably just looking for an excuse to be a dick
---
Yea it is a bit late, but to be fair he’s not the type to cover “trendy” topics, cz he takes time to prepare one video.
---
I call them You-ee Goo-ee's lol I said it once during Fallout 3 when I panicked after being attacked by one the first time and it stuck in my head.
---
when you hit 50, at each level after, you can either pick a new perk card OR move a single point from one special category to another.
---
At 40, you can unequip the shotgun perks and put something else from the same category in its place.
---
Dirty casual
---
yeah, you probably will have a lifetime of being an asshole.
---
at least you can rest easy knowing everyone hates you.
---
When I saw that plan I knew what it was but I wished it was for a gun called the Long Pew.
---
Ah, I see. I hadn't seen his videos before, so wasn't aware of that part.
---
I have a personal in-game spring/screw/gear factory. I like to call it the junk extractor. Not very fast but it is effective. But I agree there should be some method of machining steel into said items.
---
10+ hops and still no luck.
---
I think tha bandwagoning is dying i honestly think that it all was a temper tantrum over a MP fallout,
---
I had all of my .308 ammo gone after fast traveling few days ago
---
Dragon is an absolutely crap weapon - after the first shot.  With instigating, it's one HELL of a first shot too.
---
Show your friend (or get someone to show him) how to use that to fire the first shot then immediately switch to a different weapon - if anything is alive after that first shot.  The reload on the Dragon takes forever, so you don't want to be getting beat on the entire time it is going through that animation.
---
They get away by Bethesda not actually caring
---
Where its incorrect?  Well, just because you haven't had it happen yet (finding a camera) does not mean it cannot happen.  
---
If you want specific information in relation to MY experience, just ask.  Save the vagueness.
---
Just knowing I got a few tears from you is enough.
---
Never workbenches for me, just the most consistent thing is aid. The only way to not have it freeze is to fave it and bind it to a key
---
Yeah for level 100 guys but its on a different level when you are a non power armor melee build who gets slowed by this bitch
---
if you need one item, you can't hit the repair all button.
---
I'd just remove Sentinel and Cavalier effects from assassin's gear and vice versa. No reason for them to be on the same armor.
---
It's hard for some to look at the irony of a statement instead of the surface. I knew what I was getting into 😂
---
I’m going to grab the bar set from atomic shop and run a bar that sells homemade drinks and food... roadside outside white springs
---
It is sort of like that
---
Do people only want this so they can come here for karma, telling everyone they gave someone else a gift?
---
But I've never met someone who was violently allergic to polite generalities before, and it was so interesting to watch!
---
Welcome to the Upside Down?
---
0_0 i need to find a list of things then 
---
cause i have a snallygaster right now. wonder if i can have a snally and a deathclaw?
---
No problem.  Sure, I'll be your friend!  Found them (mostly) on ghouls/baddies in white springs BTW.
---
When you see an item you like but you're too broke to buy it.. just nuke em'
---
Oh that’s great, thanks!
---
Look trough a window and try to see if a workbench is in reach. It will teleport you inside if you use it. Don't ask me how to get out again though...
---
They're around, keep checking the vendors.  I've seen them there - hell, I've PUT them there.  They're mostly not worth the trouble for most people (they can be good situationaly though)
---
OT - Me too, i just love my two shot legendary i picked up a while ago. It's my favourite to go weapon in the forest area
---
I think its not guaranteed to pick up all but mostly and yeah maybe it's depending on luck.
---
Happy hunting!
---
I don't think someone not having a cap mule character is a good measure for calling them broke... if you need but can't buy bulk ballistic fiber... that's broke.
---
I'm still curious if it has something to due with pc mods not working right similar to the atom store issue a little while back. From what I've seen it seems like a pc only issue. But I could be wrong seeing as reddit is actually the minority that plays the game.
---
Can we get a sticky post dedicated to a search result link for whether it’s worth picking up this game now? Then we can just post a link to it and move on.
---
Its not polite at all.  It's catty, obnoxious, and boringly transparent.
---
Get..... wait for it......... Gud.
---
Every day. Like, 20% of lands don't strike. I'm on gigabit fiber, there's no excuse for latency. And yeah, as others have reported, sometimes I even get audio/animation of strikes and no damage impact to the enemy. I haven't stopped to look and see if the missed hits count towards weapon damage because I don't like to see how the sausage is made.
---
If was something like 3$ here 3$ there less then it cost for a large soda, before you know it you spent 100 bucks.  The way it is now it's like I don't even want to test the water.  I've have friends spend 2 micro transaction on mobile games every now and then, come to find out they spent over 600 bucks over the year
---
A new twist on Halloween. NUKE OR TREAT!
---
No doubt. One of the more interesting ones I've run across was a guy using electric conduit for a handrail on his balcony.
---
“He didn’t do his research”.
---
So you’re implying that everything he stated are false then? So the nylon bag didn’t happen? Nor did the cheap and overpriced nuke-a-cola? Nor did any of the bugs? Everything in this video is 100% fabricated? 
---
I’m not saying he’s perfect, I’m just saying the fact that **MAYBE** the reason that he launched this video so late it’s because he took time gathering infos unlike other YouTubers that’s rushing out trendy video since day 1.
---
Read my reply.  I've found 3 broken quest cameras, fixed them at a tinker bench, and gave them to poor souls already. They show up as weapons.  
---
Found 2 on scorched in white springs, one on a legendary elsewhere.
---
Server hop at the Teapot, I got it after a few attempts.
---
Many cubes as well though.
---
Thank you. &lt;3
---
They got nerfed quite badly a while back. I never understood why. I thought Bethesda wanted us to fight over workshops to encourage PvP. Currently there are easier ways to get loot than the workshops so a lot of people don't bother.
---
&gt; triggered 
---
Thats funny cz this whole thread started bcz a certain someone was triggered in the first place, and that’s not me :)
---
So?
---
Camps that have active vending are shielded from nuke blasts now I read.
---
*pew pew* hahaha
---
What I personally do as a precaution is whenever I load Into a world I switch it to my aid tab and keep it there unless it’s absolutely necessary to switch it to another one. This way if for some reason it randomly drops something it will be like a can of dog food or something. I only select weapons from the scroll wheel and I never spam the scrap button or sell button at vendors.
---
I got an Instigating Explosive Gauss rifle the first time I went to a queen fight.  Then, I got a TSE handmade the second time.
---
I though it was going to be the greatest farming event ever after that.
---
Well, probably a hundred fights later and I've never pulled something useful off of her since those first two meetings.  RNG is a fickle mistress.
---
Dude I have a guy I gave one to say so ON THIS POST.  You are in denial.
---
How did you see it was an explosive lmg and not take it?
---
Not saying it will manage it (or replace it). 
---
just that it will give players another way of buying/selling stuff, and it will eliminate some of the problems associated with live interaction.
---
It popped up on screen and a split second later the ghoul vanished, my reflexes are sadly lacking =/
---
I am mainly a PvP player in many games. If you are saying that hiding in a bush with chameleon armor and wait ten minutes for someone to run around so you can VATS his ass is competitive...
---
If I find one today I will hunt you down (after fixing it of course) and throw it at the back of your head!! :). Nicely, of course. 
---
If you're on xbox.
---
Vendors reset every 20 hours. But if you're at 25k caps, maybe go over to one of the trading subs to spend some money? Or go buy all the plans in game that you can.
---
Also, learn to let go of junk, which actually isn't as difficult as you think! If you don't use a lot of fiberglass, or rubber, or whatever, maybe keep 25-50 each and dump the rest. Marie Kondo that stash box! If you have 100+ stimpaks in your stash, maybe go tuck a few into the overseer's cache at her camp outside flatwoods for a newbie to find. If you have shitty legendaries in your stash that realistically no one wants to buy, luckily you'll be able to dump those tomorrow for scrib (scrive?) to open up some space.
---
Omg an underwater entrance?! What platform are you on? (I’d love to see it.) Do you have pics?
---
I’ve kept 4 or 5 on the off chance I can decorate with them. That and scorched heads in jars lol
---
I think it's safe to assume pvp via workshop will enable camp damage.
---
Oh I have like 15 different robot figures XD
---
Yeah, the Friends Welcome sign was such a godsend.
---
Explosive isnt a prefix so you were in the transfer menu? I could be wrong but im pretty sure it doesnt kick you out of that
---
You, yourself, provided so little information about your process that phrasing specific questions requires an inordinate amount of effort, but, since you insist....
---
Where do you find additional cameras? On the same dead tourist? If so, does that mean that there's a random variable that's only applied to players who have found a camera already, and which determines whether the tourist's body holds another? Is it like looting a container, where the passage of time for loot to repopulate is relevant? In this case, would the dead tourist be the same container no matter where he spawned, or does each location use a new container? Is it, perhaps, possible that each location can produce one camera per player? Etc., etc.
---
Not so sure we need an emote for this, but I'll give you an up for performing a public service. I finally came across one of these scumbags camps the other day.  Owner wasn't around, but I guess he saw me prowling around on top of it via his map and was guessing my intentions.  I went into settings to switch off pacifist and when I came out, I was standing alone on the edge of the walkway and his camp was gone. Went on about my merry.
---
How do you know he plays in his moms basment!!?
---
Stop looking in peoples moms basments!...creep
---
Damn dude! Very cool!
---
&gt; toy sound like the sort who just yells at people
---
lol which part of my initial comment give you that idea? Not once have I used aggressive words or tone when talking to you, is that how you argue? Just accuse people of something hoping that you’d strike a nerve? Keep trying, buddy.
---
and most people here can't even do that. yeah.
---
regardless, that's the Fo4 combat system for you. but there's more to survival mode than just camping at train stations.
---
How have I not figured that out yet?
---
No thanks.  You had your chance to ask nicely, darling.
---
Just dump everything you own at the nearest trainstation, then buy a single, max cap .38 bullet from the lowest level player you can find.
---
It's a liberating feeling to be completely naked, and without a single resource. 
---
Then, you can use the opportunity as a learning experience to manage your weight/stash better.
---
Usually, yes, I am. 
---
But my group isn't always on... and mats must be farmed.
---
There will be a way around it if they join your team and just start deleting shit
---
Yeah seriously on the junk though, look at your gear and only really keep what your gear requires to repair.
---
I wish my mom had a basement. MOM... MEAT LOAF!
---
There is a mod for it but I haven't been able to bring myself to use mods yet.
---
Where else would he make idle threats from?
---
Hahaha upvoted!!
---
What even are the plasma cores for? I keep hanging on to mine for player trading/vending because they are allegedly valuable, but I don’t think I’ve found anything that actually uses them.
---
Yes, but mostly because many of us have been hoarding legendaries.
---
nice, my character works up quite an appetite when killing ghouls!
---
hard to say if it's on par yet for me, i only have 800 hours into my lv187.
---
I also have a lv97, lv31 and a lv33 alt, so i might give you a good answer soon, lol
---
FYI, there is also a quad shot legendary.
---
Or....
---
Don’t try to be a fucking hoarder. 
---
You really need 800 in your stash and ~1600 on your person, after weight reduction perks?
---
so you spend 15 to 20 minutes getting a nuke card clearing the silo and targeting my camp you launch the nuke i hear the alarm look at the map and spend one minute jumping to a new server. ?? you greifers waste a lot of time trying to waste others time. criminally stupid.
---
online games unfortunately drip-feed you content so you'll spend more time playing. that's Fo76.
---
Oh yea I forgot to mention I'm trying to make my settlement the best nightlife spot to come and spend your caps, pretend to play some pool, or check out New Gomorrah on the 3rd floor the hottest nightclub in all of the wasteland. We got strobe lights, we got a punch bowl, you want some chairs WE GOT THOSE CHAIRS!!! So if you're on PC and watch to check it out Tuesday add me IGN: Lmaolikeacow
---
There are display cases coming in the next couple of patches
---
Oof, I haven't played in about a week, so doubtful. I really don't believe anyone has ever actually been "griefed" on here, aside from the people who run into to people like you. 
---
And stop using lame Reddit lingo. Makes you sound even more like the imaginary person you're writing about.

FREEWOOBYMOVEMENT

Cubes are not creative.

Oooh, that's right.  Forgot that minor detail.

Points 1-15 absolutely.
---
Suggestion #9 might open a way to cheat if that data isn't on the server with the server overriding the local.
---
Suggestion #14 Whitespring should be free once you discover it.
---
Suggestion #18 Definitely. But I think they can't because if too many bases were in one spot the cell would be too large to run smooth/stable.
---
Awesome list
---
Ok that's cool to know maybe then they'll sell lol
---
You'll have issues with scale depending on the Z-axis height you're taking the 'photo' from.
---
The provided map is great, as an illustration.  But the markings can be particularly useless, especially anything relating to cliff, mountains, and water (90% of water doesn't slow at all).
---
I don't know if there is a systemic way to do what you're looking for (if there was a mini-map that shows actual terrain, it may be possible to code one up).  If you're relegated to camera-mods screenshots, you've got a monumental task on your hands.
---
Someone *may* be able to take the game files and create an environment to play with, if you can do that and disable FoV and add infinite view distances (and what a resource hog THAT will be...), you may have a chance at something like that.
---
And why should they? WoW, etc. Do it all the time.
---
We needs an apology emote as well.
---
Yeah I’ve bought the game but not spent a penny though not for lack of wanting too. I spend my atoms on camp stuff and that’s really all I want
---
Fast travel
---
lol yeah I just took your post literally. sigh you got me. upvoting you now lol.
---
Not going to move, made a definitive camp on the hills by lucky hole mine, I've been working on it past week to be sure it's ready for tomorrow's update. I'll be selling ammo, chems, plans and legendaries worth selling.
---
Can confirm same thing on PC when network drops.
---
Do it per-player, not per team. You leave the zone, you're not in the fight, no matter how many of your friends are. Give the zone a big enough bubble that snipers are still useful in a fight, but not so big that you can harass someone across the map.
---
My camp is in Charlston and I have it set up to be a diner of sorts, it’s called The Waterhole. I’m going to sell water, alcohol, and food if it doesn’t rot...
---
A social stop in the wasteland for the dweller on the go.
---
So meta will be sentinel and things that beats sentinel. C''mon, i saw it in hearthstone already
---
here, there, everywhere, but a little less Reddit time...   
---
Ha, that would be great!
---
If there is atom store paint available then I would recommend painting it. It stops accidental drops or trades of the item so it can't do any harm. I've painted my lever action rifle Betsy.
---
Yes, this 100% ^^^^
---
I don't even know.
---
True, there are more things to do. But most people either do that, or bounty baiting in a fortified position with a bunch of teammates.
---
I call shenanigans.
---
It’s not about needing everything. There are some things I don’t want but the settlement menu is quite barebones in comparison to 4 so the game pushes it on you especially in the menus
---
I get your point though, I should be happy with what I’ve got and I am but I’d like to have abit more and not feel like I have to overreach my spending budget. 
---
It’s more bad for Bethesda since they could be earning a lot more from me as a player but the systems they’ve created push me away from that
---
I'll buy more weapon paint please!
---
I up voted and approve of most of your list, but I have a few items I disagree with:
---
Suggestion #2: Nerfing Power Armor rad resist. I've said this in other threads- It's lore correct and logical, really, that Power Armor provides the best damage and radiation resistance of any armor in the game.  If the pre-war military could have achieved that level of protection with rough sewn animal hides and scrap tires, they would have done so.  So I say, leave the Power Armor as-is and enter a nuke zone in your Mad Max villain cosplay at your own risk.
---
Suggestion #5: Raising cap limit.
---
Honestly, I don't really care about this one because I don't buy anything from other players, and I think the asking prices on some gear is already insanely high.  With that said though, if you raise the cap limit, I would almost guarantee asking prices on good gear will eventually go up to match and it will be pointless.
---
Suggestion #8: Vendor cap reset.
---
I'm on the fence with this one.  As someone with a wife and kids and a very busy schedule, it might take me 3-4 days IRL to get 3 hours of in-game time.  At the same time though, players who play more SHOULD have more rewards. So maybe this isn't a terrible idea.
---
Evil shenanigans.
---
And again, I ask “so?” I’m not expecting every player to have amazing CAMPs, and they shouldn’t be judged if they have four walls and a mattress on the ground.
---
Woe is me, for I am both chagrined and utterly convinced of the validity of the inscrutable claims, devoid of any explanation or detail, presented by the unfortunate camera fairy who, succumbing to anaphylactic shock, was unable to provide any additional information when asked politely.
---
Yikes! Someone smashed your camp and you quit for days? The real world must be a nightmare.
---
man ive been looking for some quality CHAIRS!!!! this is right up my alley!
---
but seriously, sounds like you have a cool spot too bad im on PS4, maybe someday you could post pics of your base and club
---
:)
---
Yeah I don't do teams, not an issue to me.
---
I'm think less about things like that (where it's working more or less as intended, like workshops and teams and such), and more like things I'd worry about as an anti-social loner who doesn't trust anyone ;-)  Like initiating a buy from a vending machine then pulling the network cable, or oddball things that most people don't ever think to try.
---
(and no, that is almost certainly not going to work, it was just an example)
---
Fast Travel...
---
That’s what he said tho, “I like this guy but I don’t like watching people take shits on my interests”. Not faulting you or anything, just saying you shouldn’t waste time trying to talk sense into someone with that kind of mentality. 
---
Cheers.
---
then I would be robbed of the immersion building experience of looting a laser and ammunition off of a creature attacking me with a knife.
---
That’s currently what it is. Don’t act like sentinels means no effort though because you still can’t move and cavilers can’t stop. Staggering is the only effective counter to sentinels or assassins.
---
I keep saying I’m gonna do Uranium Fever but then I log in to my camp and I’m distracted.
---
I'll assume you actually know a way, and that you already reported it to Bethesda, and continue to.
---
Wow!
---
Yep, very common bug unfortunately. I see it during most sessions. I feel like it's reasonably new as well.
---
I think the one at Blackwater Mine usually have a couple of pieces.
---
Same.
---
That had me in hysterics, thank you.
---
Checking other players CAMPS will help with the creative juices for my own boring camp.  Also, glad that I no longer will have to stash the RAD shower upon leaving my CAMP.  This will be a welcomed patch for sure.  Am hoping at least some players have some stable flux in their sale items.
---
Yeah but it's not free. So they got to spend a few caps on top of their bounty.
---
I like this one, good idea!
---
They are good scrap. It’s another source of plastic and screws.
---
Have you verified your network connection and DNS resolution are reliable?
---
Yeah, I like to buy things in the Atom store but I've just stopped because it's too expensive. It's a shame - I \*want\* to support Bethesda financially, I want them to produce more content, I'm willing to buy stuff. 
---
But I'm not a fricking charity either. These things are \*ridiculously\* overpriced.
---
Because most folks dont need a law saying it's illegal to poison the village well.  We just dont do it cause its wrong. You are argueing it's okay cause no one put up a sign.
---
The hunting rifle has been one of my most reliable ranged weapons so far, so id mod that. And for melee i would go with the super sledge
---
Agreed. CAMP building and checking out other CAMPs is one of my favorite parts of the game.
---
Every legendary roll is different, so how would that work with multiple players?
---
well you can sell off all the extra stuff over time by waiting for vendors to reset. while that character waits you can start an alt. OR you can just pitch all the extra caps and experience play like i do. unfettered by a huge piles of inventory to manage and not havng to worry about caps. currently at 10k plus caps. i dont really go aout of my way to accumulate a lot of caps anymore it just hapens.
---
The raider camp next to top of the world has almost a full set of you get it before someone else does. Or just server hop. It’s in a circular arena type area
---
I hope so. In my opinion, for how the market works now, and for what these machines do, they are totally useless. But I really whish to be wrong
---
I remember Fallout 4 is like so. Some legendary enemies were pretty deadly because of it.
---
Being a dad, that was a rough one.
---
For snipers: grenades and rad weapons (automatic gamma guns, doesn't matter if you're perked for them). I'm not sure how well it would work but I would test out hair-trigger mods for faster fire too. Also worth pointing out that if you're a sniper build you prob have a lot of perception, and can swap in cards for automatic without having to move around special points - I don't know about you, but I have cards that aren't strictly 'mandatory' that I swap in regularly (super duper, ammosmith, etc...). I agree that sentinel/assassin needs a nerf, but there are workarounds.
---
Wait, I kind of love that as a start to a challenge run.
---
Yeah this same guy attacked me on my post saying I'm a piece of shit griefer for taking a junk bag from a guy who was harassing me. I think the poor thing needs to back up and re-evaluate its life.
---
Yeah I respect that, you don’t have to spend, just grind abit more and only get the items you want. 
---
I get your point but over £4 to buy a floor piece? My point was I want a better selling point.
---
For example compare the prices of the complete DLC packs with tons of new skins, lands and content for 14.99
---
Bethesda’s economy is leading me to believe 4 floor pieces are of the same value as an entire DLC they’ve made previously using the same engine and tools. 
---
My brain can’t escape that thought, 
---
I am willing to cash in but I need a fair value for what I’m paying for otherwise I’m feel as I’m getting less for more
---
The one caveat here however is, if you have turrets and griefers shoot at those turrets, those turrets will return fire and then your camp can be attacked....
---
I love all the salt op is causing
---
Joke's on you, you wasted 30 minutes.
---
So when i set like 6 or 7 workshops maxed put turrets some 12 some 15. Well built defencive parameter. Lights, resources, food and water all going housing for multple people. 
---
Than the server starts shutting down for maintenance. This explains alot Thanks
---
Tell ya what: you get another shot at trying your very best to insult me. Although I feel this was indeed your best attempt. Sorry you have to try and save your main accounts karma by being an insufferable manchild on an alt.
---
This happened to me on Xbox. Figured out it was set too close to a wall. Give that a try.
---
I’m very excited for this too because I’ve put a lot of effort into making my CAMP comfortable, but I’m worried that if people won’t be able to fast travel directly to it for trading that no one will see it, since I built mine atop the southern peak of Seneca Rocks :(
---
Use excavator armor to mine other nodes and deposits. This can add greatly to your resource. I am currently on iron deposit because I don't need lead.
---
&gt; If people know Bethesda was actively hunting Dupers then a lot of people would stop
---
Would they? If you can sell virtual items for more than the price of a Fallout copy, you still win.
---
That's weird last patch my durability for laser rifle went way up. 200% used to only last 250-300 shots, now I get about 1200-1400.
---
Do what I do. Sell your junk to players when you get full or make a mule. I’m always looking for plastic and acid. Other players like acid, steel, aluminum, screws, springs and such. Just make sure you offer reasonable prices. I tend to be high on steel all the time and sell it 1c per piece. Usually fetches me another 1500-3000 caps.
---
Less money in the system = money is more valuable.
---
Economics 101
---
Reducing demand doesnt fix inflation, reducing the amount of available currency does.
---
KNOW WHAT'S REALLY ANNOYING?!
---
So they made it so you don't instantly become wanted if you shoot someone's C.A.M.P anymore unless you destroy an item, sounds cool right?
---
Until someone comes along and shoots and damages everything down to low health, I came back to my C.A.M.P one day to a high level shooting everything down to a sliver of a health then walked away with my entire house damaged
---
Worst part is, you can't repair any of it unless it's destroyed, so I had to go and replace everything manually so it wouldn't get one shotted by a random mob, and the guy got off free without a bounty or anything.
---
Yeah I agree, I don't know why I bothered really.
---
@25, my 2 favorites melees were a death tambo and L20 vampire machete.  I used the machete until about L49.
---
Ranged : hardened sniper rifle.  (Found on several rooftops throughout)
---
Take it easy there Satan.
---
We need to know more!!!!
---
That sounds awesome. I’m fairly new to the game, so what does it take to get a legendary weapon? I’ve been searching plan locations on YouTube, but I doubt I’d be able to find it on there.  
---
Do legendary weapons spawn completely randomly? Do they spawn in certain areas (eg post-nuke areas)? Any help regarding where to get a legendary crossbow would be great haha
---
Go to the southern belle motel. Look at the tables out front. Table furthest to the left has a paper that will start the quest. It will lead you to a shack that you have to solve a puzzle about cats and then it will lead you to a sunken church. Beware the sunken church has a Bendigo in it. When the Bendigo dies, you get the plan
---
dont even get me started on green cubes
---
yeah, a bit strange, looks kinda half done, i think it was suppose to be a mirror somewhere i the description,.
---
Hope they fix it in an update :/
---
Sounds like mine, only throw around some easter eggs to hide troublesome plants.
---
the patch should be able to make it so that wont happen again at least
---
Yeah! That’d be great at low prices 
---
Have community made skins and sell that for 25/50 atoms based on designs, I’d be grinding those atom quests if I could micro work toward smaller items
---
Hawkes refuge, pleasant valley, locked trailer in the junkyard, wendigo cave, most places in savage divide.
---
Go on now ya damn Loch Ness monster.
---
It's been making me sad since the beginning of time. My [first hit](https://streamable.com/2p08t) often doesn't register damage.
---
Yes, but (I believe) slower than on you (without perks)- my understanding is certain things like fast traveling have a larger impact on spoil rates. In your stash, they aren’t fast traveling. 
---
This is all heresay though. Take it with a grain of salt ;)
---
I was totally excited for tomorrow's vending patch until I saw [this](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/339461/2-things-i-gotta-ask-about-patch-9/15?language%5B%5D=en) from /u/valseek:
---
&gt; Currently, there are 30 slots you can assign items, or stacks of items, to in C.A.M.P. Vending Machines at any given time
---
The font and text stay the same from what I have tried. I haven't been able to change the text but the other items in the set are pretty neat!
---
Lol what a fucking loser!
---
I love the cold storage idea.
---
Yeah, it's definitely a mirror. It's not uncommon to see in older bars or bars going for an older aesthetic.
---
maybe you are too close to another object and it wont let you squeeze in?  you could try moving it to another spot...hope that helps
---
I mean, I don't disagree with you, but none of that takes away from what I said. most people here don't know how survival works.
---
I'd also rather prepare and try to enjoy myself rather than just shy away completely because of the train stations.
---
You sound like a really fun person to be around.  With a huge variety of serious both personal and emotional issues.  
---
Have fun with that. :)
---
"rare in game items"   
---
so you're 100% sure that regular 5.56 ammo is the ONLY thing you had?   
---
I've know a decent few legit players that mass craft Ammo daily and have never had a complaint, flag, or ban. None of my legit friends are banned, the one guy I know personally that was admittedly duping got banned. 
---
Is it possible to have a legit player get caught up by accident, sure. But Most of the guilty lie and cheat and try to get out any way they can so nobody is going to believe a false ban argument any more. Once the ban hits, you may as well accept it and if you truly were legitimate then hate the cheaters that caused the bans to be necessary.
---
Oh wow. 
---
Yeah I’ve...been doing this wrong.
---
The kid who thought the bombs fell because he was being bad, and promised to change if he could have his daddy back.
---
Oh, I assure you, I do!
---
Never did just in case.
---
so you wanted more than 30 i take it?
---
i wonder if that means 30 TOTAL or 30 instances of items, and you can have say 99 per item
---
I saw a low level on the map in the woods and decided to visit and give him some water/food like I normally do with lowbies, but when I got there I found a sad kid who had his C.A.M.P destroyed by something when he was out, nothing left but destroyed walls and floors, it was a tiny shack with wood walls and floors, but something blew it right the hell up, it was clear he had put time into it because it had multiple rooms and floors, he sounded so sad...
---
"It's all gone...came back and everything was ruined..."
---
He sounded so sad it nearly broke my damn heart, I helped him repair everything and gave him the plans to make a brick house so it wouldn't easily get destroyed again, he was so happy and grateful, to this day the dude still plays, haven't talked to him in a bit but I hope he pays it forward and helps someone else out in the future.
---
That is very, very clear by how you treat strangers on the internet!
---
Yeah I feel you it’s a silly system but I don’t think it’s broken. They could put more weapons paints at lower values. So a single 10mm pistol paint for 25/50 points dependant on design. They could make small decorative camp items for low costs and even have community stuff on there with curation
---
ah ok thank you, that is too bad.. i wonder who thought it actually looks good like that?
---
Blizz used to turn a blind eye because it helped the game. or because China paid them off, who knows.
---
Beth is in a very precarious situation. you can bet the whales buying stuff are keeping the game alive. no matter what they do, someone loses.
---
would be nice if there was a voting system. and maybe they can feature the highest rated camps monthly
---
for early game the hunting rifle is definetly a good choice expecially as you have good access to mods however once you reach level 30 or so you could start saving for the lever action which in my case proofed to be a viable endgame weapon till you get hands on a good legendary
---
with the melee weapons id say go for a unarmed weapon so you have spare strength perks for convenience purposes, the deathclaw gauntlet or the powerfist are both good however in time you will definitely find legendary pieces you like
---
also if you happen to be on ps4 i would be happy to craft you a fully modded ranged weapon and i even think i have good one star legendarys i just hold on too because i dont want to sell them to a vendor so feel free to stop by 👍🏼
---
there are a &gt; a dozen PA spawn points in the forest.
---
Any one of them will randomly spawn parts.  Raider PA levels up to 45, so its quite possible you will be high enough level for a different model by the time you find a full set (of any armor), or build your excavator.
---
Try camden park, west gorge, nuka plant, WV lumber, pharma chem, and the basement of the hornwright HQ building.
---
I hope so, even though I only had it happen to me once, it was insanely annoying, had a big house and the guy must of spent forever carefully damaging each and every item without destroying it.
---
Bethesda just needs to create new workshops in existing locations that can make very specific stuff. Sort like the Sunshine meadow farm and the ammo factory where you select what type of food/ammo you want on the terminal.  
---
Some examples:
---
\-Body shop/repair shop-screws, springs, gears
---
\-Nuka cola plant-nuka products
---
\-Clothing store/dry cleaners-ballistic fiber, cloth, leather
---
\-Airport-aluminum, steel, copper, scrap, concrete
---
\-Liquor store-alcohol products
---
\-Mama Dolces-canned food (dogfood, seafood, beans, etc)
---
\-Generals Steakhouse-cooked meat
---
\-Saw mill-wood products
---
\-Water treatment plant-purified water
---
\-Dyer Chemical-acid and toxic waste
---
\-Arktos pharmacy-Chems, mentats, etc
---
\-Refinery-plastic
---
\-Robco-Circuit boards, etc
---
These workshops would be amazing and actually worth conquering and defending!
---
Feel free to add more ideas.
---
You can get a complete set (I think max. level) from a random encounter: when facing the [Converted Munitions Factory](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Converted_munitions_factory) from the south, turn right and go around the corner, so to speak: the encounter spawn point is on the other side of the small mountain ridge in front of you. Other encounters you might face there are albino deathclaws, crashed satellites or vertibots, unexploded nukes, halloween or historic re-enactors (those give you rare costume plans), and so on. 
---
There might also be nothing there, but this spot is easy enough to farm – just quit &amp; reload, and you'll find yourself facing the factory again.
---
Idk i was kinda hoping that you could change the text at least to whatever you want or at least to a few preset variances. But unfortunately no. I really just wanted the set for the bar and chairs though. I set up a shop/bar outside the overseers camp to help new players become acclamated to the game and for a fun easy to reach social setting.
---
That "one fancy item" requires a lot of rare and hard to get mats to rebuild, having it destroyed is a nightmare, and unlike most stuff in the C.A.M.P it's actually insanely useful which is why it costs so many mats to build to begin with.
---
Tomorrow.....I destroy my camp. Tis a sad say.....but I will rebuild!
---
I have been Stuck on Learn Armor Mods 75/76 for a while now, even though I learned 4 this past week.
---
Haha, I've been saving blood packs since day one until I got chemist and the stimpak recipe
---
I feel like $14 is a ridiculous amount of money to spend on a PA skin, especially since they've put out \*so many.\* $5 would be about right. All the prices should be scaled down by at least 50%. Sad because I want the Nukashine armor but I just refuse to put real money in it now and I won't be able to earn the atoms before it disappears.
---
Honestly the difference between my t51 with rad shield and without is that I wasted the rad shield.  Probably due to diminishing returns but the difference is like half a rad.  Aka if I forget to rad shield I almost never even notice.  Especially with how much radaway you get in nuke zones.
---
"at a workbench"
---
That's it right there.
---
Claiming a workbench flags you for PVP. It even says so I game when you get the confirmation message. You are unpacified the moment you proceed with claiming.
---
According to their recently emailed newsletter, they moved up the legendary vendor up to 5/16.
---
Depends what level you after, there are multiple locations, Camden Park, Cliffwatch in the mountains to the left of WhiteSprings, there is a truck on the cliffs above Prickets Fort, there is a truck in Jorge's Junkyard, Middle mountain Cabins are just some of the spawn points.
---
I got all my level 15's at Cliffwatch, but they may have nerfed that location.
---
Dude, you need to add a spoiler tag to this...
---
Idk about the whole mule being safe. Transferring things from characters I've lost 100s of weapons because servers haven't been the most stable lately. If you're going to transfer stuff. Do it in small amounts.
---
Thank you... I got him after 12 hops at the soft serve!!!
---
Lol downvotes from people not wanting this to catch on... ps you can do this at graften steel mill as well!
---
These posts probably do more harm than good in terms of breeding new people that do this . Did you claim a mine/workshop prior to being attacked?
---
I will soon and nothing wrong with opening up a new franchise on the ps4!  Its up to us to rebuild and make the wasteland our own!
---
I seen the shit and stepped right into it. I'm still wishing I had a basement to live in though. Sounds comfy.
---
Are you excited that you'll only be able to list up to 30 maximum items (including stacked) to sell?
---
only at the golf course! bdum-bum!
---
Don't try to patronize people if you suck at it. Who's the one who took to the internet to write a fucking essay how how sad they were that someone destroyed their base? Oh yeah.
---
I did say workbench but clearly stated a line or 2 below I was in my CAMP.
---
top two easily abused ways that it happens: 
---
1. someone triggered your workshop to be comtested, opening you to pvp anywhere
---
2. you have reactive plates, if they melee you while wanted the plates causes the damage he receives to act like you "accepting" his duel (also works with some mutations)
---
If you have multiple black powder weapons you can scroll between them pretty quickly and get some decent DPS but try to avoid mobs..
---
Thanks 💗✌
---
Yes! I am so very excited for this! And I don't think it's strange at all. Whenever I come across one if it's open I check it out, look around, take pictures, and then cook something up and leave that along with some purified water, stims, and a Nuka Cola. Just your average resident C.A.M.P. afficiando.
---
Even when someone has their camp locked, I either find a way in if they don't have a roof (thanks Marsupial mutation!) or leave a care package on their doorstep.
---
How do I do that,I'm new to Reddit , apologies if I muffed anything up for anyone, he asked/I answered my Bad
---
I don't see them in the atom shop weirdly.  But thank you!
---
I, too, an aspiring Filthy Barkeep!
---
Let me know if you come across The Filthy Inn!
---
Great list, well done. I am playing since day one of PC beta and for me, the two major points in this game are CAMP budget and stash size. These two can directly affect the success of the game, so number nine of the complimentary list is really important. Talking a bit more about it, we have to make a little stock of the junks items to build various necessities during the game, store our best weapons, best armor and rare clothing, store aid items to survive, power armors, magazines and bobbleheads for the displays, ammunition and some mods, so the current size is really a problem. The last weapons introduced in the game, through the event Free Range, weight a lot and we want to use them as they are one of the coolest weapons in game. I am at the point where I leave my base, get new legendary weapons and armor, collect junk and when I return my stash is 800. I take 30 minutes looking to the stash deciding if I should sell all my fancy magazines or my bobbleheads knowing the displays are coming (I already sold them one time but started to collect again). The same happens for the CAMP budget where I am looking forward to make my first ATOM purchase but I do not have space to make a bar at my base neither construct a proper location to place the upcoming player vending machine. All other bugs I know that Bethesda will address them sooner or later, but these two points are really important. We also know that Bethesda said that we will have more stash size in the future and also more CAMP budget (we did not have a CAMP budget increase yet, only some limitations were implemented to lower the weight ratio of some items), but we need it now with all the new content coming. Regarding the fact of server stability and performance issues related to these two points, yes, they are a concern but there are inumerous ways to solve these issues using inumerous software programming techniques that I will not discuss once I am not apart of the game architecture but, as a computer scientist developing software for some long time, I can assure that they can address (only saying to people know that the performance is really an issue but not something that will prevent the raise). Finally, I keep confident that Bethesda will continue to make a great job on the game, as I am really enjoying it as my unique playing game since the very beginning. And you guys, the Fallout community is incredible, I have never seen anything like that. All the data and information provided by you is a dream for any company that develop a software / game. See you in Appalachia.
---
Absolutely don't expect to be able to tag 50 items for your vending machine.
---
They've already stated that the maximum will be 30 items (including stacked items).
---
You can store stuff in your camp and it won't spoil kinda. What I mean is you plant something, you then store it on your stored tab and it is available. Your downside is budget. Obviously you can plant crops and just pick when you need it or have an alt with a farm and find a way to pick and transfer between characters.
---
heck yeah! we can rebuild it, we have the technology, your CAMP will be better, stronger, faster! the 6 million dollar CAMP!
---
They can initiate PvP with you anywhere if someone in their group claims your workshop.
---
I am unsure, I know you can add tags when you create a post. I wasn't trying to be rude. Sorry about that.
---
That doesn't matter. As an owner of a public resource, you can be attacked anywhere.
---
This really puts a damper on my dream of opening a meat shop for my hunter.
---
oh no, definitely. you're always at a risk of losing stuff when moving items around.
---
but it's better than leaving them on your main that's constantly dealing with vendors and scrapping stuff. a mule at least remains static most of the time.
---
it's about minimizing risk, really.
---
thanks for the reply,i agree the other items make the set totally worth it! good luck with your bar! ill keep an eye out if im in the area on ps4
---
I haven't played on xb1 in a while what lvl are you?
---
GT: boik20
---
Yeh but if you console gets blocked which I have seen happen and you get prosecuted for intellectual property theft then you don't.
---
You weren't, no problemo , it's a good thought anyway, I don't like spoilers so why would anyone else
---
Good for PC folks who arguably have an easier time anyway with a KB&amp;M. 
---
Not so great for us console folks.
---
ooooh that is  a neat idea!

Yeah it just says pickaxe pilsner on it and looks very bland - you also cannot put letters over it as they will float - however one of the landscape paintings does fit on the front and looks nice as long as you can't see it from the side. would have been better as just a mirror

North of vault 76 just to help ya find it

Just because people are selling items on eBay doesn’t mean they are duped . Some people play these games like it’s their job and the smart ones actually make it their job. Hell I have a tse lever that I’d rather sell for 15$ than 25k caps but I’m too lazy so it just sits in my stash
---
yeah, its ridiculous
---
Mine is open for use to anyone. But I also have mixed signals all over it like the no restrooms sign next to the port a johns.
---
I just found one of these last night! A little Mr. Handy but he has protectron arms and legs! Definitely put him in my Stash just in case!
---
Found a “note for trespassers” in a lookout somewhere in the savage divide. (Not sure if exact location, sorry.) Man had been surviving up there with his dog, but someone took him so he went out after him. Neither made it back, would be the implication.
---
yeah $5 is the sweet spot for me
---
I figured it was too absurd to be believable but here we are 😂

The grave with my angel spelled out in blocks. As a mom this hit me hard.

Whats wrong with turret farmers?
---
I hope we get another 200 stash.
---
Just hold on til Tuesday and scrip all those legendaries you're hoarding.
---
You're not gonna sell a ton of anything.
---
They're limiting the maximum number of items you can sell (including stacked) to 30.
---
There wood be so many ghouls in would armor it’d woodnt even be funny
---
ah, good idea! then the painting would have a nice wooden frame!

Im just shit posting testing the waters of Bethesda's reddit its pretty funny im pretty proud of myself. Plus i work to much and care to little.

Another barkeep joining the thread, I've got a beergarden just near Charleston Station! Come visit me if you're on ps4.

Is it actually tomorrow?
---
Hey buddy, the human race ain’t that shit, it’s just that circlejerks appear anytime there’s a small subreddit for a group of people who like a certain game. It’s just how it happens. You would probably be better off posting a opinion on the general fallout or games subreddit for a less biased view. Plus not everybody here thinks the game is Skyrim 2, there’s people who probably will agree with you.
---
hehe im also guilty of glitching into peoples houses to bypass the locked doors by accessing crafting things near windows
---
but i just look around! and like you i enjoy leaving a little surprise gift for the players once they come home like a stimpack or some radaway
---
Well this is true for some builds. I run an unyielding bloodied melee build on my main. It is overly powerful when attacking, in a good way. Sure I die if someone farts on me, But I can kill almost anything with 1 or 2 hits. I also get the added benefit of an enormous carrying capacity. The unyielding meshes great because of the extra strength buff from it. I also see the use for bolstering for a bloodied snipers build. Vanguards makes obvious sense as logic dictates keeping your health as high as possible. My issue is more with things like junkies. When was the last time you saw someone looking for a junkies item. Or desperately looking for furious. I think my issue is that they are not powerful enough. Executioners does 50% more damage when activated. This should be double. Basically, the inverse of instigating. All the enemy specific weapons only give a 30% buff. This should be 50% or even double. None of them compete with a bloodied, instigating,  or 2se weapon. There should be a balance where you could run a junkie build that is just as enticing as a bloodied one. I have never heard of anyone running one. because it is underpowered. Most lvl 200+ run a bloodied build. If it was balanced, this would not be the case. I believe in letting the market balance it. Buff and nerf until you are getting the same amount of requests for all legendary effects. Let the market dictate the balance. Currently, bloodied, two shot, and instigating dominate it, which shows the other effects are less useful and need to be buffed.  
---
We may have to agree to disagree on the cap reset. While it is true, most places you can get enough caps to cover your fast travel fees from killing enemies, there are other uses for caps than just fast travel. Otherwise, there would be no need to sell to vendors at all and people wouldnt be selling out as much as they could whenever they could. Days in game time should trigger all resets. Your food spoils that way, as it should. Your hunger grows that way, as it should, and I believe time for vendors should also pass that way. Playing the game for 5 hours should allow you to sell the same amount of times whether or not you play those 5 hours in one setting or spaced out over a month. If 2 people put 20 hours in the game and are both saving up for some mutation serums, one of which plays 20 hours straight and the other one plays 10 minutes a day. The player playing less each day has a playtime advantage, which by definition means the player playing consecutively has a disadvantage.
---
I just want to know how on earth you go through more than 1400 caps a day.  I literally stopped using the travel perk card cause I kept hitting the 25k cap once a week even with buying expensive plans I didn't need at all.  Are you buying ammo or meds?  Are you not looting caps?  Is there a hole in the pocket of your PA?
---
I'll be honest, I thought this was going to be one of those FB type whingy posts, but I have to say your absolutely spot on with the majority of your post. I hope BGS takes these into account.
---
*snap* AWW man! That was my secret. Now people will build camps there preventing it from spawning
---
its still kind off boring but now people nuke the burrows

Hi Orlandithi, so we've tried the sound settings it makes no difference and the sound doesn't play in the main menu either - it's strictly during cutscenes now. 
---
The version of DirectX 11 and the error message is 'An internal system error occurred. Please refer to DXError.log and DirectX.log in your Windows folder to determine problem'. Also running directx as admin doesn't do anything nor temporarily disabling his antivirus. The cards are - Intel(R) UHD Graphics 630 and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti. (Quick mention neither of us are particularly tech savvy so I hope that's what you meant haha)
---
Keeping mine in the same spot it's almost always been, just up the hill from Summerville in front of the lake, bright bold lighting to let everyone see it.  
---
Now does the CAMP invulnerability come with this patch too?  Because I don't want to enable any selling if I'm going to advertise the location in game and it can still be trashed.
---
ALL of this.  Nail on the head.  
---
Adding BLACK SCREEN OF DEATH.  I’m so tired of FT to a friend and getting a black load screen.
---
Don't the mutated berries at the prime site give crimson? That's usually where I go for violet and I thought crimson also.
---
Just make a mule or 2.
---
I'm planning on checking the prices at the NPC vendors and then adjusting my prices accordingly
---
Do you have a link to that statement?
---
Used to be this way in fo4, and was changed literally for the reason you just pointed out.
---
You’re missing a ton at Whitesprings then. There is 120 easy depending on the nuke location.
---
Seen this many times myself with some slight differences, but basically same thing.
---
I could unload close to 800 rounds without even breaking

so far it is, unless something changes last minute, they pushed it back before, pray they dont alter the deal further.  Emperor Palpatine style.
---
Hahahaa this is awesome
---
this is one of my favorite cosplays
---
It surprisingly has to be pretty far away from the wall or it won't let you
---
It wasn’t a secret to begin with. In at least 100 server hops I’ve never seen a camp there.
---
I doubt this will be noticed seeing it is 7 hours late but inside the mine to the very very bottom right, there is a holotape of a dying man saying he will miss his wife and talks about how great she is. One of the best acting in the game tbh.
---
with a beam splitter? because that's the only reason why they're slightly op and it breaks them really, really fast.
---
Just do it, scrum
---
It did look really nice- as long as it's on a back wall or somewhere people cant see the side cause the mirror part shows lol
---
I would love to see a Fatman wielding deathclaw come into existence!
---
Do you want a water level?
---
Cause this is how you get a water level.
---
Ahhh I see. I should be more observant. Hopefully Bethesda might tweak it then.
---
you either had a pvp workshop or you were wanted
---
Isn't this the update that blocks camp griefing?
---
Excellent! That's better than I expected.
---
They still made money for what is essentially infinitely repeatable goods, with no additional effort on their part.
---
So how does it work if I don't own a workshop? Because I'd only been on the server for 5 minutes. And hadn't even left my CAMP before I was killed.
---
This is great
---
I think i already figured out a way. The only way for you to be safe will to not have any turrets in your camp.  It said that as long as you or your turrets are not hostile towards a person.  Turrets automatically fire upon wanted individuals.  So i have 2 accounts, all i need to do is get a small bounty on one account by killing the character on the other account find a camp with a turret that attacks me and it’s go time.
---
Yeah there weren't at the soft serve before, now there will be. I avoid Charleston because it's a waste of time, 4/10 servers usually have a camp when I do it.
---
IN THE FAAAACE
---
and i still think it's better just nerf it and mako not so meta instead of making it must have items and items that counter it as well
---
If someone found a ghoul with a two shot bloody explosive whatever whatever could all 24 people on the server tag it then get one? Could you call in all your friends to join the game and tag the enemy to get a copy?
---
Why'd you leave the caps upon the table?
---
I second Whitesprings. The entire front entrance area (Left from the first guard post coming in from the train station) is nothing but red hot bloom. And the enlightened fungus at the dumpsters around back too. That whole road south east of whitesprings and around the bunker is also great for it.
---
Correct. Targeting ebay is effectively whale hunting.  Those who spend $100 on a virtual rifle are also able to and inclined to buy lots of Atoms.
---
Trapper Chest piece has a nice one too
---
You will refer to Mister Pebbles by name or be banished from this great nation.
---
Mr. Pebbles poster means something.  I usually have the Imagine! poster up.

---
So this is why I said we can use an orthogonal perspective; that eliminates all the FoV / view range etc.
---
Essentially the system in my head would be like a dot-matrix printer in reverse:
---
+ Start at map 0,0.
---
+ Look directly down.
---
+ Capture a single pixel of colour representing the surface directly below you. 
---
+ Write this colour to a bitmap.
---
+ Move to map 0,1
---
+ Repeat
---
Does that make sense? Obviously you'd use more exact coordinates.
---
Having a jack-of-all-trades build is not good to do at all.  You will be carrying way more stuff than you need and you will be doing poor damage to tougher enemies.  
---
You should focus on one category of weapons.  For example, use max Slugger perks and perks that affect Melee combat if you want to use Two Handed weapons.
---
You should also try to avoid weight reduction perks for less important things.  Bandolier and Batteries included are a must if you plan on using guns and energy weapons.  Traveling Pharmacist serve little purpose later on in the game.  I use only a Level 1 Traveling Pharmacist right now.  Thru-Hiker is just so bad and a bad habit hard to break.  It is really only good for water and farming Flux.  You do not need tons of food and water on you anyways.
---
Only use Makeshift Warrior if you are using Melee Weapons or Gunsmith if you are using guns.  Do not put both on.
---
Lol.  
---
MOM!   THE MEATLOAF!!!
---
Not necessarily. There have been posts of items missing from Stash as well :/
---
Is there an laser or tesla skin?
---
Its still WS farming mostly... They added a few new quests that are cool. Soon you'll be able to trade in legendaries for tokens to buy dome from a legendary vendor. Think that's the closest to endgame until vaults release.
---
This seemed like it was designed to display the name of whatever we had in our punch bowls/beer kegs but for whatever reason was just released unfinished. It would look better without the text, it's so out of place.
---
So on intelligence, I’ve got skills that I’ve got before I knew there was a cap. Is it possible I could maybe take it off intelligence and put it on perception
---
Damn
---
But the kicker is , you couldn’t buy that dlc with atoms earned in game
---
Yesterday I looked in the map to fast travel to west-tek and saw a level 62 and 67 sitting right on my camp (for relative location, it’s in the long tunnel under the road in the Bog) and fast traveled to see what was going on. My camp is basically in the middle of the road so I thought they were just checking out the cave I made. Well one of them became wanted and the other started killing him, so I did a “no” emote and revived him. The 67 killed him again, and I attacked him just because. Now I’m only level 111, but the Deathclaw Gauntlet I use does a consistent 400-800 Damage, so he ended up dying in two hits. He respawned and tried killing me with a Gatling gun, once again, he died in two hits. This went on for five minutes until he left, and then I checked his junk bag. He had over 300 adhesive and 100 screws, 70 springs, and around 500 steel. I don’t normally take people’s junk because I just feel bad, so I left it for him. He eventually came back for it and I kept shooting at it for him to pick it up. He grabbed it, and guess what happened next? He started to shoot me with his Gatling gun again. He died in two hits again, and I snagged his screws and left him alone.
---
Sorry for ruining the secret... lucky most people dont read or pay attention to what is up on here unless its something to complain about
---
if you need a shotgun there is a mission you can do that gives you a legendary shotgun called the civil unrest i waited until endgame to get it so i could use enforcer and it is very effective
---
Right on!
---
It’s definitely worth it! I’m not sure about the name but I like it!
---
Please like me to a dictionary that you didn't pull out of your ass.
---
Because MMO isn't a noun. It's an acronym for "massively multiplayer online"
---
How stupid are you?
---
G'day. Do you still have mutation serums remaining?
---
Hmm ok
---
Great
---
He wasn't at a workshop.
---
Just a quick bit of advice for the exploding, invisible, Impostor Sheepsquatch...you know, just in case Bethesda does Bethesda and fixes none of these bugs, but does nerf Bloodied to be on par with Nocturnal*. 😀
---
When you can't spot the Impostor Sheepsquatch, whip out your camera. Angle the frame so that your view is parallel to the ground and slowly walk around the combat zone, swiveling to make sure you don't miss a spot. As you do so, pay attention to the text on the right-hand side of the screen which lists the subject(s) in the frame. With enough patient wandering, you will eventually see "Impostor Sheepsquatch" listed! Once you know that her (invisible) body is in the frame, begin to lower the view angle. By paying attention to whether the name disappears as you walk or turn, you can narrow down where the body is to the point where you either spot the visual distortion or suddenly have the ability to loot it.
---
I know that's not an adequate substitute for bug fixes, but it's a workaround that I use all over the place. Where did that legendary enemy go? The camera sees through the grass and bushes! 
---
* I tested Nocturnal maybe two patches ago, and my conclusion was that the description is misleading. During the day, the legendary effect is inactive. At night, it provides a boost. Still not great, but ¯\\\_(ツ)_///¯
---
Ive got a bar too at the Devils backbone. Got a nice view of the SBQ nuke and Watoga on a nice day.
---
I see jet packs all the damn time. Can't get the calibrated shocks to spawn. Ever.
---
Electrically Charged and Unstable Isotope mutations will also trigger PvP.
---
Yes, you are soft. No, you weren't playing the game as intended.
---
It's as if you were playing Fallout 4 and ran from a raider NPC. Then went to complain about the enemies attacking you. In Fallout 76, other players are the NPCs, so you have to deal with them like it or not. No matter their intentions, and that includes nefarious ones.
---
I'm not a programmer by any means, but if it wasn't a one time issue that just happened to me, it's more concerning. It could be an antidupe program, but my piece was a legit drop, so I don't know. I'm just chocking it up to an unfortunate glitch right now.
---
No, stay away, it's total crap, and that's why I played it for 765 hours already! /s
---
Blame beth, we told them that their changes to survival would cause mass griefing in adventure. Now we wait for bandaid fixes instead of making survival worth playing.
---
Nah, you’ll be fine.
---
You can use the camera to help find the cloaked corpse. Pull it out and look around. When it’s in view it’s name will pop up in the top right corner.
---
I know where the ones by the main entrance are, other than the 15 or so red hot blossom I not sure where another good spot around there is
---
Try to grind atoms. Been playing since beta and have spent over 8k without spending any money at all. Those fuckers got me with the neon bar signs, man. spent 750 of what I had banked and now I'm down to 1800
---
It's the best spot to farm him - no one ever places their camp there.
---
"Currently, there are 30 slots you can assign items, or stacks of items, to in C.A.M.P. Vending Machines at any given time."
---
&gt;You have to deal with them like it or not.
---
Pretty sure I did by running through a blast zone and letting him die.
---
Try again. I'll give you one free redo.
---
Based on the trading subReddits, I don’t think widescale duping occurs any more.  I suspect it is  relegated to small-scale one-off duplication of highly valuable items
---
Just admit you enjoyed being a raider for once. You took what was his and you enjoyed it. You have no idea why he was attacking you either. Yiu might have been the asshole that stole his kill, or loot, or broke his base....
---
these are all great suggestions!

Mmo actually is a noun. An acronym can also be a noun. They are not mutually exclusive
---
Ok thanks but i feel like it's so tedious. Like honestly why isn't Bethesda fixing this i mean come on this is unacceptable
---
This would be a waste of nukes, most of the time.
---
Not really - this is a pretty well known spawn point and I see people telling others about it in pretty much every thread that pops up in regards to the bot - i hop there all the time - never seen a camp - it's a pretty useless spot for a camp anyways -no water - ground isn't really flat - no resources
---
Ah, yes. Because me run ing theough an area triggered him so hard he had to follow me like a moron.
---
You should stop while you're ahead. You look like you're the type that needs to wear a helmet when you go into public at this point.
---
mine just said Legendary Son of Fluffy but he wasn't a stared
---
hehe yes i did feel bad for not remembering
---
It still has a few bugs, but is profoundly improved over launch.  It is a great game overall and a lot of fun.
---
yeah I have one but it also limits build location and also people use up those sites pretty often
---
Enemies can take things out of bags. I dropped a rifle for a teammate and before they could grab it a scorched picked it up and started firing it at us.
---
Is VATS overlay available on t51b?  I've never been able to find the mod, and none of the vendors sell the plans for that mod... if someone can craft that on my helmet I'd pay for the service
---
Sorry but you are wrong - there are no Broken ProSnap ## DELUXE ## cameras available in-game after you complete the Bucket List quest. Even Bethesda has admitted it is so. There are broken ProSnap cameras in the game world but not the DELUXE version sadly.
---
they said a while back that a refrigerator like object may be coming. but they also implied it'd be in the atomic shop. hopefully it's a camp item like a stash box, and not a consumable resource, so you only have to get it once.
---
Thats exactly why it doesn’t work that way currently.
---
Setting up a 99 Cap store next to WS.  Everything  99 caps or less.  The more valuable stuff will get turned in for scrip.
---
What's your platform? I'm on ps4 at king_karnage117. I watched a few videos on building to get my house the way it is and met a guy who plays in the same style as yourself who came and furnished the whole place. So if youd like to check it out just send me a request as I'll be sure to be unlocking my doors soon to allow more visitors since they cant damage my stuff anymore.
---
Had her get stuck in hover mode and take no damage a couple times last week.  One of the guys in group shot her with Rosies Syringer and she immediately came unstuck and started registering damage, but I don't think that's a thing because the second time she got unstuck on her on as far as we could tell.  The guy with that syringer wasn't in the group the second time. The week before she got stuck for another group over the Flooded Trainyard and wouldn't take damage.  The event timed out.  My group launched an hour or so later and she flew over and joined the new Queen.  We were able to kill both and loot both.  Lot's of problems still with the SBQ for Beth to fix.
---
Gatling plasma. There may be other weapons but I'm not sure.
---
It is gone, my friend.
---
I think so but you'd still exist in a nuked zone. Could slow or stop business.
---
I can check my stash in just a little while, but I'm pretty sure the golf course up in the Toxic Valley has an acid seep at the workshop you can pop an extractor onto.
---
yeah but your not a crafter I can go through thousands of springs screws and gears trying to get all the mods and I have 3 friends who give me junk as well to help me I'm getting far more junk anyone with a life could come close to
---
so like tom petty you were "FREE-BALLIN!"
---
It is still a lot of fun, in my opinion.
---
Oh well. Do you know why it would have disappeared ?
---
Hit a camp like this once. Got my junk back by leveling it. &gt;:)
---
What if wooby is a physic who is telling todd howard and the development team what is coming up in future dlc. At the end of convergence, wooby says, "make it happen."
---
nice, thanks!
---
Just do the challenges really - I haven't spent a dime on atoms and I've been able to pick up everything I wanted just with that including the new Nukashine skin for PA.
---
Do you play solo or with groups?
---
I make cap stash runs every other day.  Fortune finder is important because sometimes stashes don’t load in and if you don’t have it on you’ll legit sit there looking for something that isn’t there.  When you’re ready to do your cap stash run (wait a good 48 hours so they all reset) then equip fortune finder and cap collector 3 maxed and voila, 4-6000 caps in one run.  There’s a guide on reddit called “known cap stashes” and once you memorize it, you’ll be swimming in them.
---
Was it painted with atom store paint?
---
There's nothing you can do. Dropping painted armor destroys it. If you need to get into a PA, place it down using the place function
---
Dude, I LITERALLY FOUND, fixed, and gave away THREE OF THEM.  I did not make it up!!  Got two of them off of scorched in  WS, and one on a legendary.  Why would I lie about this?  
---
I find it SO strange how insistent you are about this.  I would not go out of my way to lie about this dumb shit.
---
I’m usually on it every day that I’m on but it still doesn’t meet my needs :(
---
nope - wrong - incorrect they would be Broken ProSap cameras and not the Deluxe version that was introduced by the quest. You need the Broken DELUXE version to make a new camera. Please do not get me wrong .... I HOPE I AM WRONG IN THIS but to be honest Iain't - sadly :(
---
I'm on Xbox and I do agree with your conclusion. But it just takes a few bad apples to taint everything on occasion. The Whitesprings ettiquete you follow is a perfect example how people should behave
---
my psn id is FritoZ, im always open to meet new people and check out how they build!
---
Actually I just noticed you said a nuke. Nukes would still destroy it. You sick son of a bitch! lol I just had a funny thought, what if someone hopped servers but they hopped back into the same server
---
Demand and scarcity dictate supply and price. If BSG wants to stop the sale of items for cash; they only have to give us a reasonable path to attaining desired items in game.
---
how the hell
---
Items with Atom-store paints get destroyed if you drop them.
---
&gt; Would it make more sense to divide perks into two different categories? Like passive (always on and not bound by special cap,) and active (bound by special cap so u can only have so many armed at once.)
---
Which ones would be in catagory? Crafting passive, combat active?
---
Ditto - if I’m playing at 6pm which is when my buildings network takes a dip every no and then I’ve gotten these errors to on PC. Just close down and reboot the game
---
Hah, fair enough. You could always try hunting Yao Guai? They tend to have a couple on them each.
---
I can certainly do that. And good to know about the 48 hour plan
---
I know, i was trying to give it to someone
---
At least I don't fucking kill people right as they spawn in
---
Nice yeah I'll add you and I'll probably come see your house too. Players who devote that much time to camps have the coolest places
---
 &gt; evidence of duping going on at the moment?
---
Some dupers in eBay still have in stock +50 copies of the same god drops: AAE weapons, assasin/sentinel armor, serum recipes… and they restock often as they sell ítems (thousands of feedback prove it).
---
In my book, that is an evidence.
---
You laugh, but maybe an album of Bing Crosby covers is just what the world needs right now.
---
Mine is a foundation with campfire, stash, stances and since fasnacht confetti on the floor.
---
They don’t ban for 100k 5.56 anymore. I know this for a fact. If this guy recorded himself crafting 100k 5.56 during the first ban wave, then I’d believe him.
---
I generally play solo due to my schedule.  As with many things in life playing with a group is better but sometimes one just has to go it alone.
---
oh man you must have loaded in JUST before the bomb hit! ugh bad timing, sorry that happened
---
You are insane.  Sadly. :( 
---
Just because YOU haven't come across one doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  
---
My direct experience proves that you're wrong.
---
I'm a crafter to get all the mods for 1 gun I used 2200 screws - 3 friends helped me get them and it took us 2 weeks 
---
also I run excavator armor and can hold around 200 weight of junk (x4 = 800 weight with pack rat) and I fill up 2-3 times a session on junk and even at 100 screws or more a day I have 2 in my stash 
---
sure junk alone is fine if your just a player doing things like repairs but if your a person crafting and building things in any amount its nearly impossible even with workshops and junk extractors to keep up
---
In that case there is nothing you can do. Always remember to double check atom paints. Best of luck.
---
Sad to say this took me a minute to wrap my head around
---
I think it's gone in that case. It's to prevent players reselling atom store stuff
---
That's what you get for living in the future, buddy.
---
How much are you trying to get just curious.
---
Between the Acid at my camp, the Acid at hemlock holes, the Acid in the hallucinogen canisters at Poseidon, the abraxo at whitesprings, the Acid in each yogi bear, snally, grafton monster, and bloodbug - I’m still short
---
Yeah I got dunked on out of nowhere by a random legendary spawn that had a two shot Gauss rifle once, it didn’t spawn when I came back :(
---
Yeah. . . I took some valuable mats out to craft some stuff. Did it. Logged out. 
---
Time passes. 
---
Logged back in and died. Get disconnected trying to get it back. Check stash a bit later - realized it was the majority of mats.
---
My husband keeps his camp simple mine on the other hand isn't simple or blah.  Lol
---
Re-rolled items should become un-tradeable
---
Don't think so. Very limited amount currently. Lever rifle is the only one I use
---
Thousands
---
Do I?
---
Escape Artist
---
considering my camp is a public rest stop with no locked doors (even my water purifiers are unlocked for everyone to take) and i have plenty of resources in my stash to rebuild ten times over (no, i do not have a life), all you'll do is waste your own ammo while i watch. and i'll wait to rebuild until you leave.
---
I don't understand why they need months for 5 min fixes. Game development is too slow atm. not fast enough for good multiplayer game
---
With a silencer it's more of a long pif lol given the sound it makes afterwards
---
Where did you read this?
---
If you pick one up and it shows under your "weapons" under inventory, its the right one.  It's happened a few times to me already.  Ignore the naysayers.
---
Also curious about what you are trying to do with all that acid. Better road trip to the dessert!
---
[https://bethesda.net/community/post/2087737](https://bethesda.net/community/post/2087737)
---
That's what I've been wondering. How will people know there is a player vendor out in the boonies? I prefer my base to be remote, so having a vendor is pointless otherwise.
---
Perhaps I'm a cynic, but people will find a way.  Wonder if this immunity applies to tamed pets for example.
---
Buy some serum recipes or PA mod plans...unless you’ve literally bought them all?
---
Ok, I'll give you that it can be a noun.   Now show me a link to an actual online dictionary, not a Google search.
---
Smelting. I’m a munitions Merchant.
---
Broken pro snap cameras drop off scorched?
---
You are literally the only person I have heard make this claim.
---
So they basically don’t want people selling ammo?  Seems weird.
---
Thanks.  The hardheaded (or insane.  Or both) in here seem to be totally ignoring reality at the moment though.
---
i havent spent a penny on atoms.
---
but i grind like hell to earn the "free" ones.
---
it is a pain. I do not feel smarter than one who just buys them...
---
Cause it’s just the same trash every other fallout 76 hater has made recap in a video it’s nothing at all just click bait for easy views cause I guess he needed the money
---
Wow that's bad luck.
---
Double the lulz I suspect 😂. I've only ended up on the same server when swapping in survival.
---
They don’t even show in our inventory. Not sure how they would take up space
---
Are you on XBOX?  Can I have a gander at your camp plans?
---
The game lockup when accessing inventory started before Patch 8.  I noticed it after Patch 6.  At the same time, I lost the ability to kill the game using Windows 10 Task Manager.   My only fix is to restart my machine.
---
You can get the trophy. Check in your challenges it will tell you which tapes/stash locations your missing
---
Read the replies from dookieinmyhat.  I gave one to him a week ago.  Its in my "comments" history.  He was looking for a replacement, I gave it to him.  I've found 3 since the quest started.
---
Dumpsters in front of Enclave service entrance. Lots of brain fungus.
---
Why would you spend half an hour to nuke a place when someone can just leave and save their stuff and it isn't really inconvenient for them because people can just -come- from the new server?
---
Or the storage facility from Indiana Jones that almost doesn't seem to end and houses the worlds most dangerous artifacts and secrets
---
craft a bloatfly syringer.
---
Every enemy will cough up a bloatfly, and many will drop glands. Farm acid all day long.
---
I always see a few at Whitespring but there is usually activity all over the map, I've been spending my last few sessions wandering about and exploring.
---
No, sorry if I confused anything.  They will count a stack of items as 1 slot.  I envision them allowing us to sell ammo, you'll set a per quantity price.  So the stack of 5,000 5.56 you want to sell will be 1 slot.
---
https://www.dictionary.com/browse/mmorpg
---
better?
---
I don't think that I've explained myself well.
---
I'm afraid that you're not right as there are many factors effecting inflation and you've picked just one. Also I think that you're assuming that the supply of currency is linked to the supply of stuff which it very much isn't in this case.
---
I've focused on Demand-Pull inflation in my previous comment (as the supply of genuinely desirable things is so very small versus demand for those things), although I could equally have pointed out that the transaction tax approach also results in Cost-Push inflation (as it increases the costs of the individual selling - it is entirely avoidable though).
---
More money can also drive inflation of course, but only where demand is otherwise relatively fixed, and a transaction tax does little to remove money from the system considering the rate at which caps can be generated. If anything a transaction tax simply reduces the number of transactions which is also detrimental to the market.....unless there's an attractive alternative way of working (e.g. Different currency options, bartering, etc) in which case it might simply hasten the demise of caps as a currency.
---
Maybe just a cooldown of how long your current drink effect lasts.  So you can chain drinkings, but not stack them.
---
I think these would greatly increase the quality of life in the game - the trade bug is my bane when I'm doing my little trader thing and I'm frustrated they said they fixed the endless loading but I still get trapped on the black screen and have to close my game and reload. 
---
Hopefully they can address these soon.
---
Ah ok.  Yeah that was a bit confusing sorry haha!
---
I'm holding out hope that they release new areas with the coming expansions instead of just sprinkling in new 15 minute quests every few weeks.  The previous Fallouts had at least two new areas each in their DLC's.  Even if they are the same size as Far Harbor or Nuka-World that would be awesome.  The current map is getting stale in my opinion, even if they took a queue from Fortnite and changed up the map every now and again it'd be a welcome change.  I would love a new area to explore.  They cold expand on the whole North American cryptid thing they have going on too.  Like we could skip on over to Ohio and hunt the Loveland Frogmen, or jump over to Kentucky to hunt the Thunderbirds.  There is also potential for them to change the map to a snowy wasteland in Nuclear Winter as well, with all the nukes we keep dropping which eventually causes the drastic change in weather / terrain.  Just a change in scenery would be great.
---
&gt;its still kind off boring
---
so you never enjoyed it? Why bother reading this sub then, never understand you guys :/
---
Wow what I could do with all that acid. I farm Yao Guai at the Mountainside Bed and Breakfast and just server hop until I get around 100-150 then it's smelting time.
---
Wow, you really went all out. I don't think you can call it a camp anymore, more like your own fortress or castle :D
---
Neat trick! I’ll have to give that a shot
---
This is so disaapointing!......
---
Dupe one or get a friend to dupe one for you fully upgraded too if posible ...
---
Btw this is possible to do for whoever says it’s not possible I got a certain way to achieve this , hoping it still works after patch
---
You need to switch your build to lever action, minigun or fatman, or a pick axe, otherwise Bethesda won’t protect you.
---
The Mothman, The Flatwoods Monster and Wendigos drop lots of acid. ;)
---
With deep pockets on all my armor and a 36 in strength, I carry more outside of PA than I do inside it with 2× calibrated shocks.
---
For me, if I do not farm caps, I will not go above 3 or 4k. If I spend time farming to empty the vendors every day I can approach the limit.  
---
But why? The only time I farm is when I want a plan from a vendor that is more than I have. Latest one was the gatling plan, since it was not dropping for me from any event. A couple of days farming junk got the plan.
---
I don't want to do that
---
And those miserable parasites broke the economy and the market when they started to offer 25K caps (duped caps o/c) for any item that was "interesting to be duped".
---
I mean I see the option ob a tinker bench but I have yet to see a single broken pro snap camera drop that allows it to be used.
---
I totally understand why people are skeptical of what you are saying, I myself am.
---
This game is getting very close to wrapping up all the loose ends related to PVP, at least for me. I don't want to worry about damaging someone's CAMP on accident even when I have Pacifist on, I just want to explore the wasteland with likeminded nerds. I also want to check out their CAMPs without making them paranoid. I'll be damn happy when this goes live.
---
About all that's left is some solution to Workshop PVP loopholes (e.g. one person contests your/teammate's workshop while their team unloads fire on you without warning) and a better differentiation between "stealing in a karmic sense" and "stealing in a way that will flag you as wanted".
---
My character geared out for pvp can barely carry a few meat steaks without getting over burden
---
In case this happens again, be sure to look in the windows and see if there are any workbenches or furniture nearby. If you can get close enough to sit in a chair or use a crafting bench the animation will glitch you through the walls and bypass the locked door. You'll probably have to fast travel to get out, but at least you can satisfy your curiosity.
---
God, i've got loads of legendary armour pieces in my stash and have never thought of doing this. You just saved me alot of space, thanks :P
---
camps will be invulnerable? that will be interesting LOL
---
Bethesda thinks camp props and costumes are way more important than weapons in a wasteland scenario.
---
Baffroom, MOM, BAFFROOM!
---
dont worry OP, the joke didnt go over all of our heads.
---
i already moved my camp to the golf course south of whitesprings (im like right on top of that picture of a snake). i figured that'd be a good location since it's like a two minute run from the unofficial hub of the game.
---
ironically, despite trying to get good stuff to sell for the last month, all i have worthwhile to sell is booze. so i decided to make my place a rest stop. free water purifiers, a workshop room, a bunkhouse with like four beds, and the ground floor is a tavern. which, if i am at the location and not questing, i will tend personally (i plan to stash everything, load up on all my food and drink, and do actual trades with people).
---
Mike's Rest Stop, open for buisness! (All factions welcome, even Raiders. Must act civil inside the establishment. Take any physical altercations outside.)

---
That's a nice Woody.. getting a lick.
---
I use it for my "Mad Doc" build. Snipe from a distance first... tag everything with the syringer. Then focus on one. When he dies, spawns a bloatfly, which distracts the others, and then you can take your time and pick everyone off, finally switching to melee and killing the flies. Then just junk 'em.
---
Also, Kanawha Cemetery is great for farming flies. and you can spawn a fly from a fly.
---
BoS Scribe outfit has a good one.
---
I think the consumable crashes on PC started after Patch 6.  Lost the ability to kill the game using Windows 10 Task Manager at the same time.
---
ran into a younger player, probably age 13 or so. noticed his camp was... not good. gave him some supplies and advice. his older brother joined and thanked me for being nice to his brother by giving me a gun.
---
the gun sucked compared to what i already had, but the gesture was appreciated.
---
That is a concern with the nerf argument.  Given how they have handled other system updates and changes it could screw up several other things intentionally or not.
---
I've been brainstorming ways to show off player CAMPs on our weekly streams! That is a fun idea, I'm just not sure how could we implement a voting system for all the players across each server in game. However, this is inspiring me with a few other ideas!
---
I just finished a maze on my mule character this weekend, turned out ok i think, but i ran out of build space pretty quick
---
the tough thing was since my mule is super super super overencumebred (he has about 1400 pounds on him)  the building went very very slow heheh
---
Can’t they make a torso mod for the backpack? Durrr...
---
To add to what /u/asianmoocowfromspace said, if there's a piece of furniture near a window you can also abuse the animation glitch to sit or lie down on it and teleport through the wall.
---
I wanted to buy weapon skins since the first day i played it, but Bethesda has been too busy making hairs emotes and costumes. Thank you Bethesda for saving my money.
---
I'd say your best bet would be a re-install
---
If it has a stash and some workbenches then it's the greatest thing ever if I'm midway through a walkabout when I realize I need to build/repair/mod something.
---
Why? I doubt players who kill other players and destroy camps need encouragment from a reddit sub, it's part of the game mechanic so meh?
---
I got TSE one shot killed today at a workshop, I just went somewhere else.
---
This seems like trade secrets and for that I am grateful that you decided to share! I have a feeling this is going to up my Acid game.

Instead of focusing on a particular gun type, try focusing on a "playstyle". VATs/Crit works wonders and you can use basically any kind of gun you want.

---
&gt;  Bloodied isn't for the faint of heart, I die alot, like alot alot, 
---
yes, and no. Bloodied snipers hardly ever die in PvE. A good set of bolster/unyielding armor, chameleon, and marsupial means you will hardly ever get hit.  
---
Last time I died I was sniping supers, leaped up on a bridge to stay out of melee range, and delivered dinner to a hermit crab waiting there.
---
The one where the man waits for the woman to return and can’t go downstairs because of his wheelchair. 
---
That one got me.
---
I usually don't get that upset while I'm playing but this is actually #1 on my list
---
Ouch. I'm not built for PvP per se, that much is true, I have waaaaay too much carry weight and no need for my perk placements. I'm also a bloodied build so I def catch the one shot kills all the time in pvp though it seems like it's kinda happening to everyone. I wish I could have perk card presets so that I could swap around better for pvp, but at this point I'm just keeping my lvl 52 alt to the side to see what's up with legendary players when that patch comes out.
---
i giggled
---
Aquaboy + 3* Natural Resistance = underwater CAMP - can we not encourage them to put enemies down there with my stuff?
---
I think you underestimate how determined griefers are.
---
Also from what I understand you can get put into PVP with another player if they contest a workshop during a workshop defense event, even if you don't own the workshop. Since I show up to those all the time to farm blueprints, that's not cool.
---
Party at your house!
---
I’m glad!
---
Same here, level 168 and no TSE drops.  i have a couple explosive guns but no two shots.  Best gun I have now is my Anti-Armor Explosive Lever gun.
---
You guys look awesome! This rules.
---
Doesn't power armor get +200 carry weight from calibrate shocks? Do you really need backpacks on top of that?
---
I'm guessing that's exactly what will happen. I can also guarantee that there will be several threads complaining about this from people who are too fucking stupid to deactivate their vending machines before claiming a workshop.
---
Manual update of your custom.ini to include the missing official files.
---
&gt; trying to unlock mods for my Lever Action and my Handmade
---
I presume you mean crafting and item just to scrap it and try for a mod unlock? I've been wondering if that was worth it. I presume it is for some of the more rare weapon/armor types?
---
I almost never find trapper armor to scrap, so I've been considering trying that, but that ballistic fiber cost hurts.
---
Definitely makes a difference if you're farming nuked WS for 2 hours though. It's more of a convenience thing for me - not having to hit the diluted radaway as often. Also makes a difference if you're farming gloated glowing ghouls non stop that entire time (and I am) - they add a lot of rads.
---
Holy cow yeah I bet it did. I honestly don't have the attention span for such a thing, hence why I paid a decorator to spruce up my place. I cant wait to see more player builds, I feel like it's been kind of a missing element to the game
---
Much better now than launch. Average only about one crash per hour. Back in November it was like 3x more frequent.
---
Yikes. Don't know that any advice I can give ya would help then, seems like you got all the bases covered.
---
i think sometimes stuff gets removed. it happens to me with emotes all the time. try checking the atomic shop and seeing if they are "selected" or whatever.
---
Not quite: if they fast travel away they stop contesting your workshop. However, teammates of someone contesting a workshop also get put in to PVP with the workshop owner. It's generally done with a team: one player fast travels to your workshop and contests while the rest of the team then unloads on your CAMP and destroys it.
---
Free wooby
---
In my experience, the losses come from doing any kind of selling/scrapping/dropping too fast. I haven’t lost anything except a blade of bastet, I’ve been playing since BETA and have multiple highlevel characters, 2 accounts, 7 mules. So far nothing has come up missing now that I’m paying attention.
---
Obviously this is all outside of server crashes- I lost some valuable mods when I dropped them and picked them up with my second account, logged out with my main (thus saving my character sans mods) and then the server crashed (thus NOT saving my mule picking them up). 
---
What I HAVE seen is the game “grabbing” the wrong item when selling/scrapping/dropping too fast. Had it happen with dropping junk from the junk tab. Somehow a couple hundred rounds ended up in the same bag (I noticed something weird flash by on the confirmation popups so I checked the bag)
---
Yeah, folks like to crap on the syringer as useless... I use it all the time. 
---
Just... you gotta balance how patient you are, or the enemies will kill your flies before you get a chance to tag them. I'm not using the amount of acid you are, but I go through a lot of it... and by using this, I haven't found myself short yet.
---
But it does take a certain kinda playstyle.
---
It's so hit and miss sometimes. Last weekend I racked up 16 hours of crash-free gaming. This past Sunday I had five crashes over 4 hours of gaming.
---
That is only with Excavator power armour with calibrated shocks, you have less DR and ER than in normal armour though, not to mention that Backpack is not only about bonus Carry Weight
---
How would you know it’s explosive, since it’s a tier 2 effect and won’t show in item’s name.
---
I guess so. I guess I’m just more annoyed because it’s my day off
---
which is what defenses such as turrets are for.
---
plus my camp/public rest stop is in the whitesprings golf course (just outside the typical nuke zone) so i got a few robot guards lol
---
There are only three ranks of Iron Fist for unarmed weapons. Which is awesome because they have higher base damage to compensate and it frees up points to use on other perks. Unarmed is fantastic.
---
Where can I get the barrel mod?
---
it was never truly fixed, only improved slightly. it's worse depending on the server.
---
Per last week's preview, when you build and power a vending machine it'll make your camp visible to everyone on the map. Should be easy enough to wire it to a switch so you can turn it off and go incognito if needed.
---
yeah tell em squid
---
&gt; Getting so sick of those dang commie propaganda posters....
---
It'd be nice to be able to do something with them. Maybe a little nod to the Book Chute in Old World Blues, have something that turns them into Blank Books or similar. Breaking them down into cloth at least would be good.
---
Breaking News: Crazed gamer runs rampant terrorizing domestic street cats he says are "Legendary mutants" trying to kill him. We'll have more on this as the story unfolds.
---
No!! Then I'd have no reason to farm/sell them!! I mean I get what you mean, but it just tears out a little chunk of the market (one I happen to deal in lol) and it sucks to have to find something else that other players will want to buy. Just the opinion of a lowly merchant who likes his business though.
---
That sucks. If it weren't for stabilized perk requiring PA, I wouldn't bother it (PA) at all.
---
I've never seen this and I run PC and sniper a lot...never seen a "gray" out on the health bar either. Not saying its not happening just not seen it on my install on PC
---
Were you in a group?  Hunter/Hunted accidentally? 
---
If you don’t have any of the mutations that spark, and you didn’t have a workshop I’m just confused as you are.
---
Claim workshops and defend them. You're guaranteed to get camp plans for each one. If you're worried about PvP, just claim them, do the defense mission, and then server hop to ditch them.
---
nice!
---
Wow pretty impressiv argumentation. I never realised those facts before you mentioned it.
---
[Boogie Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlcP6Q-siJQ) from Fallout 3, it hasn't been in another Fallout game since and it was my absolute favorite back when the game first came out. Epic underated song that i would always tune into GNR for if i heard it playing in the background, stop what i was doing and just take in the post apocolypse.
---
Yeah, I guess I should have specified that I do bloodied melee. I like the in your face kind of approach lol.
---
Gotta find the plan. 
---
Then it requires 10 bloatfly glands (Kanawha Cemetery for farming... BUT DO NOT "JUNK ALL" when farming to build the weapon... store your glands first, before you junk everything).
---
I'd make you one happily... but I'm an XBoner.
---
BTW... gland drop rate seems far higher when using melee weapons to kill flies, rather than ranged weapons.
---
Every time I get a minigun, I'm tempted to name it "Easy Break" based on my experiences with using them.
---
While this is unfortunate for your camps, this sounds more fun than the usual one-shot-then-server-hop pvp I witnessed.
---
Trend and demand drive prices in this game. Not necessarily specific item value on paper.
---
I just kill the megasloths that spawn outside my camp. Have been overflowing with the damn things by the hundreds so I sell them and never have to worry about my crafting needs for them.
---
yup, i agree totally! simpatico, as they say!
---
Brotherhood recon rifle if you can bet someone with the plan is great
---
There is an odd bug with Atomic Shop Emotes. Not sure if it’s related to your issue. 
---
 Sometimes all of your purchased Atomic Shop emotes will disappear in game. When you check the Atomic Shop it shows them unequipped. Just deselect them.
---
I'm probably not going to move my CAMP since I like its current spot, but I do plan on a couple changes here and there to make the vending machine space a little more welcoming. As for stock, it'll mostly be things like plans, mods, bobbleheads, chems and some other stuff depending on what I have available. The only thing i'm not sure on are item prices.
---
your world has been invaded...
---
I have done that. It is a blast, but a deathfest. 
---
I found that a good bloodied hammer hits plenty hard enough when not bloodied, so I tend to just rad up for events like the Queen.
---
it was a common occurrence to find people posting things on this subreddit to the tune of "i found the tourist, here is my username on Xbox, add me as a friend and come get it!"
---
hell, that's how i found her. gave the player i got invited from some water as thanks.
---
I think it should say NukaShine on it.  Or give the option to have it say whatever you want.  I'm sure we'd have some interesting bar mirrors out there!
---
Thanks for all the info.
---
The Forest / Flatwoods - radstags and brahmin
---
Maybe its just my perception of it, but it seems to be more related to how long iv'e played. Like it doesn't start before I have played for at least 15 minutes. Maybe you are right, and it depends on the server and it wasn't truly fixed.
---
I just know I haven't experienced it in at least 2 months, so it's highly dissappointing to have it start up again.
---
Damn it beth
---
Go to the Farris wheel on the north west of the map. Those stuffed animals give you leather.
---
Yes so I can just.. use the ominous mannequins.
---
Eh it's Reddit after all 😂.
---
&gt; it was quite scarce but you needed it to repair armor. 
---
That's still the case from what I can tell. Crafting/repairing both combat armor and trapper armor requires a hefty amount of ballistic fiber for each piece. I have a farming location that can get me 10-12 per trip if I'm lucky, but I never have enough no matter how much I have.
---
Yeah vats crits will one shot anyone. I have ridiculous defense, full sentinel, dodgy, serendipity, lone wanderer. If a player doesn't know much about pvp they barely scratch me. If they know how to stagger or vats crit it's still insta death. People think that the build is invulnerable but it definitely is not by any means.
---
Like, a gun for Super Mutants.
---
Like "long shoota"
---
They didn't increase the overall limit, but they made a tweak to lighted objects and turrets that helped considerably. Basically, they capped how many you can build (10 turrets and 50 lights), but each one now takes significantly less budget space. 10 turrets takes up roughly 20% now, which was about what 2 took under the old system.
---
ok, but nerfing sentinel assassins is also a way to rebalance pvp :P  
---
But I'll bite, what good legendary effects would you suggest to rival it?    
---
Personally I can think of "staggering" from fo4, as that would be a hard counter to sentinels.  Especially if it stacked with perks that stagger to generate a higher chance of stagger.
---
You should send in a ticket.
---
No just solo. That's the only reason I posted on here tbh. Sheer confusion lol I'm over it now anyway, just thought I'd see what others had to say about it.
---
It means that Thumper will be balanced as it was supposed to be, and instead of doing 100% damage (double damage), it will do 20% as every other Explosive weapon.
---
It's instances.  So you could still sell 1,000 of an ammo type and only occupy a single vending slot.
---
Ive seen reports on a bug that explosives deals more dmg then they show. Or it could be opposit of the rad immun bug, you dont take dmg until x amount is dealt. Dunno just a guess lol
---
maybe we could have it changed so we can choose from a preset list of things- like for example we could make it say "open for business" when we are there then if we go out adventuring we could change it to "bar is currently closed for trading" or something like that
---
I think the game may have trouble tracking all those entities. It's why stuff you drop is put into a paper bag instead of just dropping; the servers could be overworked. I'd also like to see mannequins, but I don't think the game is quite ready for them.

---
Holy shit, that's genius, and probably looks a hell of a lot better than the busted ass wood railings I have on my balcony.
---
You're not wrong. There are issues of consistency in complaints about immersion. A mutation that allows you to jump 15 ft. vertical, count as being stationary and firing a shotgun while you do it? Folks seem to love that.  
---
Similarly, the complaints of exploits around the house I posted were based on being able to remove the foundation and supporting stairs. Personally, the following [https://imgur.com/gGVnkyz](https://imgur.com/gGVnkyz) presents the same issue to me as what is posted above: immersion-breaking and structurally unsound...yet photos of that iteration of my C.A.M.P. would receive half the complaints.  
---
We need a better building system. There has been progress (see: stacking foundations) but there are fundamental flaws that may not ever be addressed.
---
Farming has kept me with a surplus. I have enough corn, mutfruit, tato, and water purifiers at my CAMP to make eight vegetable starch each time they regrow. And Green Thumb is your friend -- doubles the amount of crops you pick even on the first rank, so 16.
---
Ok thanks i am very cautious when i drop items or sell/scrap stuff
---
Are pets included in the immunity??
---
Sometimes, I would love to inspect some other player's camps, but I usually pass, in case the owner prefers privacy.
---
Beautiful! Thanks again!
---
Bethesda do not care. Simple as that. All it would take to unban my account is 1 human to look into it. But they just don't seem to care. Expect the temp suspension to really be a perma ban. That's my expectation.
---
Just drop a nuke on their camp. Sure, takes about
---
15-20 minutes and a little bit of effort, and they get a generous 3 minute warning to wrap up whatever they're doing and hop servers, but if they don't get out you destroy literally everything in their camp and don't even get a bounty on your head.
---
I think this may be the new way of grieving in adventure mode
---
one time, a guy came up to my camp and stabbed me. i put on my headset and told him, "all my scrap is stashed, i am broke in caps, and i am already at my camp. i do not feel like pvping now. if you want to kill me, then kill me."
---
apparently he didn't like that i wasn't willing to play with him so he proceeded to destroy my camp, likely to antagonize me into shooting back. instead, the dumbass got wanted for destroying a wall. i stood there as he destroyed everything he could (he even got his friend to join in). when he was finished, he ran up to me (i had not moved an inch, i just watched him) and stabbed me again. i asked him if his temper tantrum was worth the wasted ammo and weapon condition, and he logged off.
---
i barely spent a tenth of my supplies to rebuild. i was never more pissed off at a griefer, but also never amused by their own stupidity. they coulda just left and found someone willing to pvp with.
---
survival mode was added like a week later. havent had an issue like this since.
---
Will the Prime receiver ONLY take the Prime ammo or can you use regular ammo, just not doing as much damage?
---
I have only gotten the mods from the vendor, never from scrapping the actual pieces.  I have a bunch saved in my stash for if they EVER release legendary versions because it absolutely looks the coolest out of all the armor in the game but I just can't get rid of my full Unyielding set, my character build relies on it too much.  A full set of Unyielding Scout Armor has become a wet dream of mine...
---
Libel.
---
Is this a serious problem?
---
pvp with 2 bloodied ass/sent builds with all the pvp perks is actually pretty balanced. It's about getting one to stagger abit more than yourself.
---

There is no way they're going to make them free FT spots.

Higher level players sometimes get a bad rep with low levels because we all have one thing in common: Higher Level.  Hopefully your interactions with most of us will be positive.  I know for a fact that most high level players in Adventure are friendly to lower levels.  This may range from just leaving you to your own thing without bothering you, all the way up to inviting you to team up and building you an awesome camp or outfitting you with guns and gear.  It's the few bad actors that have made low levels cautious of us and with good reason.  It's gotten so much better here lately and hopefully one of the last remaining griefing pastimes of camp smashing will be coming to an end this week.  I'm sure there will always be exploits in the system for these players to take advantage of, but I hope you can eventually come to trust a LvL. 200 player striding by in your area without shrinking into the brush or Fast travelling away because you think he's about something sinister.  Good Luck out there fellow Vault Dweller!
---
I have started over haha made a floating 
---
Flat  with obnoxious amounts of turrets under the floating flat (no reason)
---
Thank you for having a look.
---
Yikes. That's quite the error since so many commentators specifically noted and/or praised that it was expected to have benefits for all characters.
---
awesome!
---
Does that mean that turret towers at the golf club are now invincible from other players?
---
Did this works like a charm now. 😬
---
Your best bet would be to just buy them from someone.
---
I think if you pay $20 or less it's fine (I got it for $18 and like it a bit). Any more than that and I think you're pushing it in terms of value.
---
This is the kind of thing I want to see.
---
OH! and I nearly forgot... there's an acid seep in the far northwest of the map. Middle of nowhere. Safe as houses. Walk northwest til you find the corner of the map.. .then head east-ish, sorta zig-zagging along the way, it's near a cliff.
---
I’m 99% sure it doesn’t and every time someone has said they are rocking a full set of chameleon armor, I ask them why and they don’t respond. 1 piece is sufficient as far as I can see.
---
Mod learn rate goes something like this:
---
Say you have a 1 in 10 chance of learning ANY mod. On a d10 you learn when it rolls a 10 (for argument sake).
---
If your weapon has say 30 different possible mods, that creates a 2nd table with 30 items in it.
---
1- receiver A
---
2 - receiver B
---
3 - barrel A
---
4 - barrel B
---
etc. all the way to 30.
---
So you scrap a weapon, the game rolls a d10, 1-9 you don't learn anything, but on a 10 you "win".
---
Now it jumps to the 2nd table and proceeds to random a # from 1 to 30. If you don't already know that particular mod, then BAM, you just learned it. BUT... it never removes that mod from the 2nd table of 30 possible choices.
---
Scrap another weapon of the same type. The game rolls another d10 and you hit 10 again! Woot woot.
---
Back to the 2nd table and it randoms the same 1-30 as before... but wait... It picked a # you already knew, so you learn squat because you already knew that mod.
---
In the beginning... you learn mods quickly because that 2nd table is basically free game. But as you happen to hit the same learned mod(s) over and over, you don't learn anything new and it takes more and more scrapping to hit that last couple elusive mods you are still missing.
---
It doesn't help that a couple of patches ago, they across the board nerfed the rate at which you can learn a mod to begin with (especially armor).
---
Using the above example, in the beginning, if it was a 1/10 chance to learn, now its closer to 1/40 chance.
---
\-----------
---
I have two FO76 accounts, both with close to the same amount of hours now. My original account main character easily knows 99% of ALL the weapon and armor mods for every item in the game. My 2nd account, with close to same # of hours knows maybe 40-50% of the same stuff. On both accounts, I scrapped EVERY single piece of non-legendary armor I came across.
---
I have a feeling that if they wiped all legendary weapons and armor people would be whining about the regular gear.
---
While I love PVP, this fan base is filled with people who don't want conflict. Multiplayer probably should have just been co-op PVE but then half the fan base (me included) would have left months ago due to a lack of high end content or anything resembling a challenge. The reality is PVP is a ton of fun and somewhat varied when you stop complaining and start adapting. You're going to die and lose a little bit of aid and a small amount of easily replaceable caps. Get over it, get a squad together and take it to the server.
---
My group has had a running war with another group the past week and it's been the most fun I've had since November and filled with "GG" after.
---
im not saying it's okay to do it, i'm saying that if there aren't measures in place to stop people from poisoning the well there's always going to be someone to come along to do it. especially so when the well is an online video game with no repercussions for being a dick.
---
Restarted after reading i keep everything after scraping a blueprint thanks for the info.

1. 1. the action or crime of making a false spoken statement damaging to a person's reputation.

With every game there has to a good/bad. Take wood armor for example, how many players have you seen running wood armor as opposed to combat or marine? The same applies for legendary builds. Biggest problem with the theory is that Bethesda only believes in nerfs, so if they nerf bloodied the way they did 2 shot then what's left? There's always going to be an undesirable. I have actually doing a junkies set up on an alt character just to see what it can do, it could be the most powerful thing in the game. I truly believe that it's just based on popularity than anything else. Everything in the game has its place.
---
A player playing consecutively will always make more caps than someone that logs on only to sell. If the same 2 players are saving up for the same thing then the player playing the most will get it first, between enemies, cap stashes, events, random finds, it's very easy to come up with 2-3k in caps just by playing. It's also based on the in game economy itself, they have cap sinks in place such as fast traveling, if they reset it based on playing time that would throw it way off balance, as well as cause the game to have to save more on your character, it runs rough enough as it is Lol.
---
I used to load up a vats crit before going into survival, but I havent been able to gets VATS to lock onto a human target in over a week (even if they are just standing in front of me, weapon drawn) so I've just been blazing people with my bloody LMG and using chameleon armor to sneak up to them. I use serendipity, lone wanderer, tank killer, and full unyielding armor. So usually doesn't matter the build, if I can land 3 hits with my LMG, you're toast. Which is easy if your stealthy enough to get in close cuz of its fire rate, but I'm a pretty good shot too so I can usually pull it off from a distance or while mid-firefight.
---
Charred Ghouls with drills and wooden armor? Pass. /s
---
What? I dont know if youre kidding or not. 5.56 is so hard to come by. Ill easily use 800 rounds in 3-4 hours. This is why i generally stay at camp and try not to use my 5.56 unless its a bigger fight. 
---
Finding shotgun ammo is easy peasy though.
---
I always invade others camps, unless the doors are locked, or the player is inside.
---
Sadly, I never come back go my camp to find someone looking around.
---
I have a double barrel explosive shotgun.  With enforcer 3, adrenaline 5, bloody mess 3, and all shotgun perks (9).  Skeet shooter 3, demo explosive 5.  Plus tank killer 3. It does plenty of damage.  The problem is you have to get up somewhat close to stagger.  My experience (much like melee) has been you’ll get ganked before you can stagger the ass/sent player.  And I’ve got Dodgy 3 and Fireproof 3 for defense. I've tried longer range sniping with better results but it takes a lot of shots to get there if you aren’t doing the whole vats crits thing.  So, learn and adapt which means you probably need to fight fire with fire and acquire similar armor.
---
The community gets so salty haha, ima be nuking bases aswell
---
I have my camp on an acid extractor and it seems to suit my needs. Basically I collect acid whenever I go to camp. Self explanatory I know, but doing Lucky Hole for lead, it keeps my ammo stocks nice and plentiful. 1000s of ammo of multiple types.
---
I guess for some caps aren't an issue, but it's my bottleneck right now (in my level 40s). I end up bulking and selling all but ~150 of any scrap just to get the caps I need. Keeps the stash clean as well. Consequently, I constantly need to farm plastic.

I just feel like i'm not cool with how they handle this game. I simply do not understand how they could release a game that's not even half finished  and it still isn't. I thought i'd be fine when i buy the game a few month after release but that obviously wasn't the case. I hate bugs but i could handle a few server crashes and visual bugs and minor, annoying stuff. But when you lose a weapon which took you many hours to get, that's just unacceptable. Fortunately it hasn't happened to me yet but if it does i'm gonna be so pissed.
---
I just checked and it went back up to 60.
---
I paid $35 at launch and I definitely got my money’s worth. If you are a fan of Fallout you will like this game. If you aren’t a fan of the series, there’s a decent chance you won’t like it.
---
I've lost a few items in the game, including Equipped Items, Items from my inventory, and Items from my Stash, I frequently find my Stash weight to be less than I thought, with some basic materials being fewer than I thought or in some cases knew I had.
---
There is no rhyme or reason that this occurs that I have noticed, and upon reporting it to Bethesda Support, the only response I have ever received was a canned email stating "We are unable to replace Lost Items".
---
It is a trash fire but it is a fun trash fire. I got it during the BETA and it has had a LOT of issues. They are slowly beginning to fix most of them and yes, more will turn up, but I would recommend it. I am a die hard Fallout fan but can admit when shit's hit the fan with Bethesda.
---
I just bought the keypad door for my camp, I am very excited about it. I left the code in plain sight but you have to use your brain to figure it out somewhere in my camp. If you figure out the code, my PA station is up for grabs in the back of my "shop"  
---
Side note, will CAMPs withstand a nuke now? I would like to go back to where I had my camp the first time in the train car north of Whitespring, but it kept getting destroyed by nukes that players would drop on WS, and I didn't want to lose my decontamination shower to a nuke anymore.
---
That is awesome. Thank you for the information. I haven't seen that preview.

DESTROY ALL RED CHINESE COMMUNIST

Death fest is the absolute truth, I also go through stims like candy, but luckily diluted heals about 10 hp a shot. Running PA with protocols has helped cut that down, but the damage is reduced as well.
---
Lost my All Rise.. It's not like I can redo the quest to get one back.

The vendor spawns anyway if there is a camp
---
it happens mostly with shotguns and autos.
---
thats what ill do from today. i just wanted to write exactly what happenend. so people might see this and say "thats exactly how it happened with me". i always thought this was a human mistake when i read the threads. but i had the weapon on me, did nothing with the char (nothing with the inventory i.e. selling stuff), changed to my mule, changed back, weapon gone. never had this before. i already accidently scrapped my pa legs, but in this case it was a legendary. thank god not with a big value
---
I don't know for sure, I've heard both yes and no.
---
That too
---
This whole fiasco got me thinking... I should start eyeballing workshops 😂
---
You can also trap an enemy monster in there so that they cannot fast travel since they would be under attack.
---
I am fully aware that it doesn’t transport to the owners inventory but if the owner has gone to that much effort and thought to put the turrets there then they must be thinking to every so often check for loot. My frustration is that when I ft into whitesprings and I’m trying to get hits on the ghouls and 10 missile turrets are pounding into the place, it’s making it my frame rate is so bad I can’t do anything or my game nearly crashes. I am now aware of the fact they don’t get XP as you stated, thank you. No shade in this comment simply stating my frustration in the matter.
---
It’s definitely not as rare as 5mm since very few enemies use miniguns. Handmades are also way better than guns like the mini so it’s viable investing in a stash of 5.56, even if you’re burning through it
---
Great game, as long as you quickly accept it's very different from the other Fallout games. A lot of the bugs have been ironed out, though there still are some to fix. For the price I bought it, £15 on CD Keys, it's 100% worth buying. Bang out the first few missions, even if you find them mundane, because the game soon gets much more interesting once you get them initial quests out of the way. You just need to be patient, and get a feel for what type of game this is and how you should approach it. Remember this is intended to be drawn-out and updated over time, so you can't really rush and get all the best weapons and armour straight away, you have to grind and develop your character, their stats and your CAMP as you go along. For me, as I was massively into building on Fallout 4, most of what I do on 76 is based on progressing my CAMP. With the Atom Store, and how easy it is to unlock Atoms without paying real money, there are plenty of cosmetics worth saving up for, and Bethesda frequently add new items, be it timed exclusives or not, to the store so there is often new things to add. 
---
Take all this from someone who was among those who both had irrational ideas of what the game was going to be, and also gave the game unjust hate without giving it its due when it was released. Now I have been patient and played it properly, I stand by what I said above.
---
Thank you! I can never find that bot and I've noticed a lot of camps at his spawn point blocking the random events
---
Yeah with backpack i 'll have more space without PA. Excavator wil still rule for that but on the others,there will be no meed for cali shocks.
---
That is why I made my camp as simplistic as possible so if it did get destroyed, it wouldn't have mattered because I didn't go all out on it lol
---
I do the same in Minecraft. Make a box, put a bed, a door, a chest and done xD
---
So an 80% damage decrease? RIP Thumper
---
Isn't this the Flatwoods monster
---
Not a problem
---
Pure luck after all at least what legendarys you get.
---
They drop from events as legendary enemy encounters.
---
Whitespring for exampel is the most targeted and crowded spot to find legendary enemies.
---
Heard from several people it doesn't, and in all the times I server hopped for the vendor if there was a camp there no random encounter would spawn at all.
---
Can you kill all the SMs at Westek by yourself?  Clear Whitespring by yourself, or hold your own in a nuked WS?  My level 30 can’t do any of that with conventional  ammo unless I’d use a ton of stims, a thousand rounds of ammo, and take forever.
---
Ahhh, making a syringer maybe? You know those meatbags hanging around where you find super mutants?  Check those 👍
---
I'm right there with you. I'm excited to see my neighbors. Of course, anyone is welcome at my camp. Acid node east/southeast of Yellow Sandy's. If you fell off the cliff, you've gone too far.
---
I think it is overpriced but I do it because, for some reason, I still have a lot of hope that this game will become what it should be eventually. I hope me buying from the Atom Shop helps that in some way. If that even does justify it. Sometimes I even just log in to buy something that came out and not even play.
---

It has been crashing since launch on PS4 for me. It’s crashed well over 100 times. I have 100+ other PS4 games and those have crashed a combined 3-4 times in 5+ years.
---
Yeah lmg is beast, awesome range and laser accurate. Add in tormentor so you can stagger them instantly too.
---
Do you know how we get the rad shower plans?  Is that just a lucky drop from the SBQ or is does it happen every time?
---
Are you sure that wasn't your fault? Because i have never seen that happening and i'm lvl 150
---
&gt; some seem to get mad you dont want to trade
---
I've never understood that. I had to block someone just last night because they wanted to trade and I didn't. Chased me around for five minutes trying to PVP me. 
---
Dude. I don't have anything I'm willing to part with, and there's nothing I want from you. I'm trying to adventure here. Leave. Me. Alone.
---
I really wish there were better "No" emotes, as the current ones are far too dramatic and more of a "hell no" than just a "no".

I found the First Aid perk maxxed out makes a dilluted heal as much as a full one. That was a game changer, worth the 4 points.

 I have 2 pieces and it works better. Stuff is more confused as to my location and wanders off sooner.

 I use knives so I do get right in there with em' and have a pretty good feel for how they react.
---
 This is not PvP though and that is quite different.
---
I have quite a few on ps4 if u want to buy. But yeah they drop from the queen
---
I've been wearing chameleon armor for quite some time in this game. from my observations one piece works just fine. The rest do not add anything to it as far as I can see.
---
Yeah but your also the person that might be causing some people to stop playing the game. Not trying to be rude when I say this but I think it’s really mean to do something like that.
---
the description give you the hint that i does not matter but ive seen 300 lvl people wearing full set of chamaleon , even content creators, so it really makes me doubt
---
alright time to fucking end my life im wrong again
---
That’s another 10 perk cards ahead of where I am.  Can you clear Westek pretty easily?
---
My AA auto handmade does pretty well against most PvPs in survival, but I’m still prone to getting killed as it takes a healthy burst to knock down the decent armor.  In my PA even with Fireproof and Dodgy engaged I can get lit up like an Xmas tree by a high powered Gauss.  Surprisingly I’ve only been one shotted once in survival and that was over the weekend.  I was in stealth and opened up on a dude from a distance and he must have vat critted me.
---
Someone can probably describe it better than I can, but when you go into the reactor room turn left and look for the level 3 door. Crack that and it leads to the storage room that connects to the "break the mainframe core" section. 
---
I've done it a couple times when I'm in a group, but since I'm usually running them solo I just spend 60 seconds fixing the pipes rather than spending a minute fucking with my perk points while in hostile territory.
---
You’ve been asking some very nooby questions the past few days yet you  understand how the game works so well . I call bs
---
[](/celestiafrown)Really, I want to disagree with you, but my defense is just the Gatling. It sips it's ammo so slow it's really efficient, but the Minigun, MG42, and the 50. cal all drain their ammo in the blink of an eye.
---
Agree. I am very lazy with optimizing my fast travel and I struggle to stay under 25k caps. So unless you are traveling just to look around, you should more than make up your expenses with event completion cap rewards and caps you find looting  containers and killing enemies. The most I've ever spent on a fast travel was around 40 caps. You'd have to travel corner to corner 35 times to blow through 1400 caps.
---
That said, the other suggestions are spot on. Bug #1 is now happening to me on my stash all the time. This is a fairly new development and it super annoying. As an extension to bug #8, I often get out of my PA and then can't stash it. I don't have the option. I know it will 'recall' to me shortly but that makes me nervous and I'd rather do it manually. So I have to stand there like an idiot for a minute until I ether finally get the stash option or it does it on its own.
---
Yeah that’s correct. I fight the SBQ a lot and always walk away with a ton of crimson and violet from there.
---
I guess I dont notice it as much now that I think about it cause I'm burning radaway most of the time just to get rid of them all.  I pick up at least triple that I need just looting all cause its faster than trying to make a decision what to take on the fly.  And yeah, whitesprings ghouls suck for rads during a nuke.  Doesnt help my gfs nickname for my toon is sick boy cause I am ALWAYS diseased and it's almost always rad worms so I feel ya.
---
What platform are you on? If PC, perk loadout manager mod does this. It's great
---
Thanks! But believe me I have been, been serving hoping checking West tech and two other mutant spots, been checking scorchbeast guano piles and killing scorpions at the cabin near ws. Been doing for weeks and have three stingers Lol
---
and floods
---
When you come into the reactor room, turn left and and first locked door you come to on your left, pick the lock, go into the room and hang a right into the next room beyond. There's a console there to hack and you can shut down the reactor sequence from there.  This opens the door to your left and you can continue on through it from there
---
Be happy to use turrets if they didn't eat my budget for breakfast
---
Thanks, but I'd like to try and earn it the regular way.  I haven't beaten the queen yet.    Is it a guaranteed drop every time?
---
Yeah only one of the few I've interacted with turned out to be an odd duckling.  The rest have been great!
---
I didn't even know my camp could be attacked by others!  Thankfully all it is now is a few shops and a stash chest lol.  I lack the resources for more stuff.
---
Check amazon for physical copies. I saw used ones around $17. If you want digital, then that might be hard.
---
Abandoned bog town, snallygastors hide has a lot.
---
Yeah I know thanks, I've got one drop of a stingers from there in weeks of server hoping. Seems like Bethesda doesn't want me to have the syringer Lol
---
Where is that at? I haven’t heard of that gun.
---
Yeah I have that perk but I took it off, the most I ever use is 2 at a time, I'm usually only around 20% or less health.
---
It says in the post that it is blocking the bot, only there, and people assume that's the only spot. The post is clarifying that Janets soft serve is another location, so if it's blocked at Charleston then this is another place, and that Charleston is not the only spawn point.
---
If I'm understanding you correctly, you're asking about moving points from one stat to another, like shifting a pint from intelligence to strength, right? If so, you can do that eventually, but only after you hit level 50. Every time you level up after 50 you have the option of choosing a perk card or moving a stat point from one SPECIAL category to another.
---
You can move camp. You can repair camp. If this breaks your spirit, maybe videogames aren't your problem.

I believe they do. Other major and minor prefixes stack (unyielding, sent, and cav for example) so there's no reason why Chameleon shouldn't. Obviously you don't get visible interns of the squiggly invisibility you and other players see, but I think it does affect how enemies perceive you. It's anecdotal but I've noticed a big difference while gathering my full set. from when I just had 1 piece and was in danger a few shots in, vs a full set just crouching still in the middle of 15 super-mutants running around me literally bumping into my character and still being in caution with them unable to find or shoot me. I always feel untouchable with my full set tbh.
---
There is a red rocket near the abandoned bog town.  On the roof there will be a wide variety of pelts and clown dolls (Which give you leather).  That should give you quite a bit of it.
---
You already have voting machines - let us build a small one in our CAMP if we would like to be considered - then people can use the voting machine to give the camp a 'like' - tally them up and presto.
---
Any locations for T51b mods? I can find the plans easy but would rather not waste thousands of caps for plans lol
---
You make some fantastic points.
---
Wouldn't a perk that extends the duration of one be nice? Same amount of healing, but over say 20 seconds. That constant medium level regen would be a lifesaver.
---
Surprisingly, I have found 3 of them, and I am not ultra hardcore, have I character only. 2 I found from farming the responder bot, and another I found at white springs, someone must have sold theirs to the vendor there
---
I had countless of them since the first time taming was discovered. My budget never went down after each death.
---
And yes i agree i would like them to be in line with the turrets, which means damage scaled to the owner,same budget space,and possibility of respawn or repair like any ither asset
---
That's true.
---
Savage, my spot has some tin can spawns and is a nice little mt spot
---
That's stupid.
---
Awesome!
---
Myself, I live in a van, down by the river.
---
yeah that's one of the reasons i've traded my minigun for .50 cal. with minigun as a main weapon my sole purpose in life was to feed it with steel, lead and gunpowder.
---
Fuck that’s got me laughing still
---
Ok my base hasn’t been attacked at all it’s so peaceful
---
Wow this is great, I was there for the event but I find this very cool!
---
loool so we got a car hobo here !!
---
Never really thought of that, but yeah :D There's going to be a lot of "competition" like that I suppose, trying to up each-other, and maybe even teach each-other neat building tricks etc. I also cannot wait for the vending machines at the train stations where you can dump in all your unwanted legendaries, and get tokens in return to use at the future legendary vendor. My stash is SCREAMING for space lol..
---
I think Todd Howard addressed this awhile ago at that exhibition... He basically said it was just too much stress on the game, and CAMPS were actually a last minute addition to the game. Another Bethesda guy did say however they definitely want to let us do way more with our camps and are putting a lot of work into it... So there is hope.
---
Easy there, Satan.
---
Rad worms aren't a disease for me anymore - they're just a part of my bloodied build lol. I vendor them. Make my 1400 vendor caps every day across 10 toons by selling excess radaway, rad-x, glowing blood, etc.
---
He said he didn't own one. Many posts ago.
---
No and I’ve loved every other fallout
---
Yeah this happens all the time.  Mostly with legendary mobs.
---
How so?
---
I was going to do ammo as I seem to find and dump so much of it, as well as some outfits, chems, armor &amp; weapons.  I haven't been hording stuff because I just don't have the room, but have kept a few 3\* weapons I've picked up.
---
They're pretty rare. Your best bet is to find a crafter to make the ones you want for a small fee - usually 500-1000c.
---
Hold on.  Are you saying that only one person can use a given vendor at once?  I'm a new player and this... shocks me.  Does this apply to any other "NPC" like quest or event terminals, etc?
---
Not at this time; they're only good for powering the Gatling Plasma.
---
Since you seem well versed in the art of stims, is there more to them other than just half the heal, or does it do anything similar to radaway diluted
---
Nuclerean Rhapsody.
---
I have been getting the game freezing on PC a lot.
---
Gonna be honest - I dropped these perks the second I realized that. Takes too damn long to hit search and wait to see if you get a result.
---
 Pricket's Fort. There are hides all over, in the fort.
---
I want a guest book people can sign.
---
My camp is just some work benches and my stash sits above the grass, seemingly levitating because I just can't be arsed.
---
All the power to those who build cool camps; it's just not for me whatsoever.
---
Isnt it?
---
RIP your stash size holy shit
---
I guess that is true I think it really just depends on point of view I guess. One could be thinking you are a jerk for breaking their work but you may just be wanting to play the game you feel it should be played. I won’t judge you too much but other people might, but still good luck out on the wasteland.
---
I had to ditch my full FC beacon - short on build space and needed to add a mini adhesive farm. I did put neon "FC" next to my door with a standee.
---
I usually get a few defend workshop from radscorpions events when I claim Grafton steel. Its usually 3 waves of radscorpions.
---
Shit, Camps are becoming immune to damage? That's just on adventure mode right?
---
Since Survival Mode was added, i don't think I've seen anyone WANTED anytime I am playing Adventure mode.
---
I just don't get some people and the tantrum they have to throw if you don't indulge them.
---
Remove it. Focus on playing around ballistic/energy/rads. Then people can rock paper scissor over weapons. It's way better this way.
---
The post clearly says  that camps don't block the bot from spawning at Charleston.
---
Yeah, I don't carry any junk in survival, use bandolier instead.
---
I still do, yes. I continuously make them to keep a supply of 3-5 of each in stock at all times. What is your IGN and when will you be on next? My IGN: jchamlin
---
[](/celestiawink)[These](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a9wogg/event_related_cosmetics_reward_list_full/ecntvu8/) are some of the rarest. Also not mentioned in that post is the Hunter's Long Coat which is sold by a roaming trader(not the supermutant one).
---
I picked it up at full price at launch, which I think maybe was 40? I dont remember. I would've paid 60 easy though. My first playthrough was easily 100+ hours. And I had a great time. I didn't experience many of the bugs people were experiencing, though I did run into some, however most bugs in games dont bother me much.
---
I didn't speed run the game. My friends and I just played it naturally. Running missions and events as we came across them. The story was nothing earthshattering, but I did enjoy it. The world is VERY well crafted and fun to explore. Its definitely a huge world space filled with interesting places to explore around every corner. 
---
I also didn't care if the the fake digital thing my fake digital character was talking to was a fake digital robot or a fake digital human. Either way, I had fun with the gameplay. I enjoyed the character building process. There's plenty of potential in the game, beyond what's already there.
---
All in all, I'd still recommend the game even at it's current price point. Even if you only get 30 or 40 hours out of it, that's better than a lot of triple A offerings these days.
---
The problem always lies with the viewers that fail to get the actual point of the video and use it as another "game sucks and will always suck" "argument"
---
Glad you think so! Hope you find me in game!
---
PS4
---
Hehe, I hope you have enough cork scrap though as that always seems to run out first when I do this
---
That's good ol' Roachy! He's not just a Radroach. He's the Raddest Roach. It's a reference to the Monster Factory series on Fallout 4. That's also where my username comes from.
---
All I can say for heavy weapons is they seem to be the king in terms of raw damage per second. The main issue I figure is the lack of armor penetration and inability to get anything meaningful out of damage boosting abilities like sneak attacks and critical hits.
---
Thanks for the wonderful comment &lt;3
---
What I want is interior brick walls it looks crap having a brick internal wall when the rest are plastered, and yes why can't we have coloured inserts like some Fo4 mods
---
What platform
---
The preview mentioned player vending, a vending machine that will exchange legendary items for "Scrip" that will somehow be used with the legendary vendor coming in a couple weeks, and a bunch of buffs/balance changes. Here's a link to their blog post from last week:

I have a personal limit for junk in my stash; 50 of general crap, but things I know I use a lot of I allow 100-200 of, 200 in the case of springs and screws. However i'm usually carrying around hundreds of excess in addition to those 200 in my stash as I can't bear to drop them. 
---
(I've given up carrying adhesive around as it kept building up, so it all went into my stash - now I have about 700. But I can't stop picking more up.)
---
So just like how Yao Guai eat tons of springs, Megasloths eat screws? time to move.
---
PC, should’ve clarified earlier
---
You can't just remove it when people already have items with it.
---
You're absolutely right! I'll edit it in right away
---
I have a 2star Bloodied Bowie knife with swing speed What console and anything good to trade
---
I was way up high on the monorail looking down at a Behemoth fighting a Scorchbeast, that was incredible to see. I let them pluck away at each other but neither of them had done much damage at all. Eventually I went down and finished off both of them.
---
Guess I just got lucky
---
You met the "Beach Boys" or their wannabe's. They have a reputation good and bad depending on who you ask. Lets leave it at that. 
---
\- Roll with friends... pvping solo is pretty tough at least when you start.
---
\- Spawn into train stations with your weapon away and pick direction and sprint. Your spawn immunity will get you away most of the time. White Springs is really the worst of the train stations too. 
---
\- If you kill someone near a spawn point be aware that they will be back and invulnerable. I always back off so they come to me when spawn immunity is almost gone. You can light them up when they turn red (no VATS) but a lot of people use it to their advantage and run right up on you.
---
\- You can crit through Assassin's Sent/Cav. It helps to have a high fire rate explosive weapon or use VATS if that's your thing. AAE/BE handmades were the king but have been replaced by legacy energy weapons. All the people I mentioned above seem to have them. 
---
\- Damage mitigation perks are a lot more useful than DR perks. Max Dodgy and Fireproof are requirements along with Serendipity for bloody builds.
---
*lots* of times the name is the primary effect and the first “description” is the second effect.
---
O cool ok, I haven't tried that yet... Thanks
---
Player-based economy.
---
I think it would only apply to weapon users like scorched, mole miners, and super mutants. Maybe robots too?
---
But yeah, everyone would be flocking to get tags in and there would be so many copies of grained weapons. Especially explosive since it is an obvious trait.
---
very cool!! thanks for sharing!
---
If you haven't already done it you need to do the "Mistress of Mystery" from Riverside mansion great Quest.
---
Lol Whenever it says "You are suffering from rad worms" I have this bad habit of saying out loud "Oh I wouldnt exactly say I'm suffering" for exactly the same reason.  I dont exactly run bloodied but I do have adrenal and do the same thing sometimes.
---
I've honestly just accepted it.  For a while I ran the  plague mutation because I always had at least 2 diseases, course griefers had to ruin that fun.  I am however hoping they will fix the auras and on hit effects eventually so I can put it back on for no other reason than to make me smile.
---
Thanks for the input and info. Looks like it's time to go back to melee. Or maybe Heavy.
---
This apparently isn’t as uncommon as you’d think. I’ve seen at least 2 or 3 other posts claiming the same thing. Don’t feel too bad, it happens
---
I'm on PC and don't keep anything really, only have caps, but everyone seems to be Max Caps now.
---
Yeah definitely not like a BR season. I take it a lot of people in this subreddit may have not played Diablo before so they're probably sort of confused about seasonal characters in PvE games sadly. But it would be super interesting to be able to always start over and pretty much speed run the game every 1-2months with a new character for a reward at the end.
---
I’ve only been noticing it since the last patch or two, and not *common*, but oh boy, I’ve noticed :P lost a legendary when i couldn’t find the body/meat pile after it vanished
---
Yeah, I think everyone pretty much covered everything.  I'm level 149 and would be happy to help you out.  I usually play at night during the week and most of the days on the weekends.  My GT is the same as my name on here.  I can help you with some of your quests, get you some XP, and get you going.  I love helping out new players!  If you see me on, feel free to send me a team or party invite!
---
I'm not sure if I'll be moving my camp. But I do know anything I do not want will end up in that vending machine.
---
I also think that if you log in, transfer something, then log off too quick, the server sometimes just doesn't checkpoint / record the transaction at all. Happened to my 1 star bloodied .50 cal. Not a huge loss - I have spares, but shows that it happens. I also have had a full suit of excavator power armor disappear. I crafted the pieces on my main and modded them, then gave it to my alt account character (I run 2 accounts simultaneously), then I logged off of the alt. Logged back into the alt, and although he was wearing a power armor frame, all of the excavator power armor was gone. Just an empty frame. 
---
When I finally got my end game GG weapon (B25 .50 cal) this weekend, I made sure to use it a bunch in that same game, repair it, and stay in that game as long as possible in the hopes that the server would realize I had the item and not take it away. So far so good. I did experience a really odd bug though. I changed the receiver to be prime, and it kept telling me I didn't have any ammo of that type, even after I hit reload and had 250 ammo showing in the magazine. I had to swap to a different weapon and back to the B25 .50 cal for it to work. Also getting health rubber banding again, guess my dps is too high with this thing. Oh Bugthesda.
---
Do we know for certain that camps will be protected tomorrow?  I mean, a lot of us have been assuming so but I don't recall seeing anything official confirming it
---
Ask people to make you an offer.  Then double it.
---
The other thing is “loose bolts” in the world can’t be picked up. Theres a few very consistent spawn points for bolts; you can never interact with them.
---
Oh. Ok then. May buy it and start building that church of the mothman I do wanna build then.
---
Also check events, there is Rad Scorpion Horde event sometimes.
---
Great! Been playing off again on again since the release but never really build a CAMP for the reason of players attacking it. Time to build one now I guess.
---
how much you asking?
---
We really need a way to abandon a workshop claim.
---
Pretty sure half the heal is the only thing about them, but if you use maxed out first aid it makes them give 29% hp and since I always use stimpaks at around 70% hp it would be a waste to use normal stimpaks, so I just use diluted stimpaks. It also gives me way more stimpaks since I can turn 1 stimpak into 4 diluted ones.
---
Haha I’m a level 17 and I visited whitesprings today to buy some plans. And I can totally see why people would go there for legendary enemy encounters haha. I barely made it inside alive. Thanks for the help!
---
You are a saint. Thank you very much.
---
not useless! i have to farm those pale tongues!
---
I recently started doing it right and I hardly ever get any hits off the perk. It'll be the first one to go when I want a slot.
---
Thanks for confirming! 
---
I do so agree. I really hope we some day in the future see torn capes with hoods or something like that. Would make the coolest wasteland scout ever with the enclave armor!
---
And btw
---
U sir, have now made that a dream of mine as well...
---
Put a silencer on it, respecialize into covert operative and mister sandman, and start dealing 2.5x-3.5x (3.75 if you bug it out) damage instead.
---
Now you're dealing more damage than just running and gunning.
---
Which is also exactly why the game received as much hate as it did.
---
that last step is a doozy!
---
I thought tormentor was just a shotgun thing... explain like I'm five?
---
this is the big question, i hope they do make the area behind the gold course off limits to building camps
---
it wont be tomorrow after the update! hooray!
---
This list of bugs is fantastic and I’ve experienced some or maybe all of them. Bethesda needs to read this!
---
Yeah I see bolts on occasion but can’t pick them up. Thankfully the materials required to make them are fairly easy to get
---
Absolutely. I bet 2/3 of the "reviews" were from people who didnt even play
---
i hope so, but it hasnt been explicitly addressed yet by the devs
---
The only one that sucks is Sludge Lung. Man, seriously, screw Sludge Lung. And once in a while I'll randomly get flap limb or shell shock, which also really suck.
---
Actually it's rifle, dunno of it works with lmg or not. Could test it but adds 15% chance to cripple which acts as a longer stagger.
---
Hold that thought; I believe I have a Bloodied 3* Cultist Dagger, but I’m at work. Will edit later.
---
Sure I can. I can remove anything. *Snap*
---
You on Xbox?
---
Instigating only doubles damage the first time, when they're at full health. So on an automatic weapon like the Minigun it sucks ass, but it's amazing on slower high-power weapons like the Gauss Rifle or Black Powder Rifle.
---
Radscorpions up by Wavy Willard's. And the raider camp NE of the fallen space station.
---
Can you even use console commands on 76? If so that’s a true slap in the face for us consoles
---
Please don't ...
---
Exterminator1 on PC.  probably gonna sell em for a a couple caps each just to get rid of everything.    not sure yet though.
---
Or people who simply booted the game up, hit level 5, and fully believe they have experienced all the game has to offer and promptly writes the game off as a bad game.
---
OK, no hurry, safe journey home.
---
The key is normally the fire and a stash box, the cardboard standup is recommended, as are posters specific to the player (what they're feeling up for), and, if you can spare the space, the camp owner's user name.
---
I've packed a little more into mine, using a cooking station instead of fire, stuff like that.
---
Nothing is selected also, i need to exit build mode for it to start working again.
---
No PS4 :(
---
It is also a random event point, just off the west side of the road. So you can search for the vendor and collect crashed satellites at the same time.
---
I believe it’s at the prison, and it’s a quest reward.
---
No one likes that they're there or that Bethesda broke their commitment to only offering cosmet microtransactions, but they're also pretty useless and definitely a waste of atoms. I haven't even used any of the Improved Repair Kits you get for doing the Scorchbeast Queen event.
---
Swamp Gas makes my inner 12 y/o giggle.  Every.  Single.  Time.
---
Some 176 attacked me and my friend (lvl 62 and 32) my friend (lvl 32) wrecked this kid. So what does he do? Him and a friend spent 2 hours searching the map for my friend. He was at my base when they found him. The one dude comes over and one shots my turrets then destroys as much of my gorgeous base as he possibly could. 
---
I was so happy that he did that. My stash is almost completely full and it gave me an opportunity to use some of those mats on repairs. I simply stood over each thing and pressed one button to repair them 😂
---
Boy did he show me.
---
Granted, it's not without its flaws. In some ways it felt rushed. Beta testing was a joke and nothing but marketing hype. But this game has come a long way over the last few months
---
No problem. Heavy weapons seem to be in a good spot now.
---
Camps don't block him from spawning. Here is a post explaining where he can spawn.
---
Mate, you’re more than welcome to come down to my CAMP if you’re on PC. I didn’t go all out on decorating but I always get new ideas when I see someone else’s work.

I’ve got like 30 of them on me from SBQ drops. Don’t really see the need with the right perks maxed out (weapon artisan 3). I forget I have them on me until I see the choice selection while at a workbench.
---
I’m usually left with a lot of acid I don’t use from gathering abraxo for the antiseptic. Maybe we could trade 1:1 if you have an overabundance of antiseptic. Unfortunately I just sold all my acid last night but I’ll keep you in mind in the future.
---
Yup, and if you think you know me IRL, you probably do. I don't dox myself here, but I'm not exactly hiding with my username either :P
---
Filthy casual here too! I have this but I’ve yet to see another one which is a shame!
---
I’m on XBOX
---
I have more repair kits than I know what to do with and I never purchased a single one from the atom shop.
---
Remember House Fancy from spongebob?! Throw that on the tube and now we're cooking.
---
everyone was mad when beth announced it
---
now? no one cares / uses it
---
consider it an atoms sink..
---
In my last time around DS3, I got more use out of dung pie than Blue Sentinels.

When 76 launched there were so many ways to exploit other players through the PVP mechanics it was insane.  Launching Survival has helped and each update they have added more tools for Pacifist players to be able to control their encounters with other players without being exploited somehow. Smashing camps has always been a way for certain people to build up their bounties to lure PVP encounters or to be sociopaths and do it just because they can.  They will be doing an update this week that will prevent damage to your camp from others you are not currently hostile with.  I think there might still be a way to exploit it through contesting a players workshop or even by attacking their turrets, but the exact mechanics governing it are unknown at this time.  Most of us have stuck it out through all of this and are having a grand time.  I hope you get there too.
---
I need to get a proper camp made for my mule, but I'll sell everything. I have a mule filled with 1700 lbs of junk, aid, ammo, weapons, and armor, and he has all the weight reduction perks and -20% junk / weapon / ammo weight gear on too.
---
1700 lbs is 771.8 kg
---
I believe that agility caps out at 15 for stealth benefits. So I would say yes, sneak perk is still beneficial.
---
Join my world btw
---
Just some friendly info: if you're gonna move you should put your camp east of harpers ferry, somewhere along the river. Two megasloth spawnpoints in the trees just about 75m south of the dam there. Theres also the new free range event spawn to the north of the dam along the dilapidated bridge (which has a hermit crab spawn point toward its middle), follow the bridge east till you spawn the event (will happen as you get to the end of the bridge). Theres also Tanagra town to the near east of harpers ferry that has a spawn point of either a deathclaw, a fog crawler, or a 3rd megasloth. Plus the bonus of being right next to harpers ferry and the burrows for easy looting. PLUS being so close to a vendor/town that you CANNOT fast travel to in survival is critical. If I get a kill in harpers ferry, chances are good they aren't going to be able to spawn any closer than the station by top of the world (about a 6 minute sprint back to harpers ferry) and I can take my time getting their loot and find a good hiding spot before they get back seeking revenge.
---
I don’t care. I get the better ones for free.  It not hard for me to get the mats needed to repair something. I could care less about “slippery slopes.” This game will do what it needs to make money. If it bothered me that much, I would have stopped playing.
---
37?
---
You seem to be new. Caps were extraordinarily exploitable before and people are sitting upon millions between mules.
---
short answer: no
---
but def keep escape artist
---
Yeah I can understand the frame issue. Especially in a game where the frames aren’t perfect already. I was just a little defensive, because I put turrets in my camp where ever it currently is, just for the sake of camp protection. I did however see a post on here saying camps in survival would be made indestructible so that’ll probably change.
---
I don't, but I can recognizer a fellow developers organizational when I see it.
---
Welcome to capitalism
---
Man I’m on Xbox would have given it to you for junk or ammo :(
---
I noticed that at times. It's the only way to reset something. Another issue is when you place something down, something disappears or the object you try to place appears elsewhere but not attached to anything.
---
Smh. And what stat is it under again? Now I feel like an idiot and need to figure that into my build since I use tank killer already
---
Good to know!
---
Luck
---
The patch notes say that once you pick it up, it’ll become available at vendors for you for that character
---
Ok I didn't know those spots either
---
&gt; It doesn't make you invincible in any shape or form.
---
Assassin + Sentinel grant ~71% damage reduction. Even if you just take that in a vacuum it's not OK for a person with a full set to take so much less damage than a person without. Gear alone shouldn't make a survivability gap so large between two players.  
---
Anyone PvP minded is going to stack this with low health affects that add additional damage reduction and damage avoidance perks.
---
An off the shelf PvP build has more like 83% damage reduction (91% vs melee) ***before damage resistance*** and a 62% chance to avoid hits.
---
Good luck staggering when the same build one-shots you with the game's built-in aimbot.
---
thank you kindly for the invite, however, unfortunately im on ps4
---
I went through my stash yesterday and found 15 repair kits in my misc. tab of my stash? Huh! I got them from SBQ kills and events I guess! I had no idea I had them. Beth should store them in weapons or ammo even aid? not misc. I haven't used them because it defeats the purpose of clearing items from the stash to make more space. I will use them if I remember to go into the misc tab.. :)
---
Hopefully they'll fix the annoying bugs first and not this one
---
Not with the queen, but randomly walking the wasteland I'll be near some bad guys and hear them die. No one I can see nearby, no sounds from weapons.
---
That's what I'd assume
---
Sorry, the god-roll pins'n'irons are trade only! /s
---
[](/kcelestiareally)I remember a [quest for wasteland glory](https://youtu.be/m9jQepX4fi0) over just such a sword. Hail to the ***PIMP KING OF BAHSTON***.
---
In honesty yes, I've only put in a few weeks of 76 but been around the fallout series for a while. 
---
Maybe somewhere down the road in a patch, new use for caps rather than just fast travel. Events with a real cost, there has to be a way to make it valuable to carry around 10k caps. (no not for a trade.. lol)
---
Just curious does anyone knows what time the patch will come out tomorrow or have they not realized it yet? I am trying to figure out if I should study all night for finals or go to bed like a normal person.
---
Here is my anecdotal findings, will hop on later to verify and ensure im not just blowing smoke.
---
Crouch with one on then crouch with three on. I believe i become more transparent with three. 
---
Also it seems each of the stacked peices disengege seperatly rather then all at once when you move. It feels like i get an extra half second of invis.
---
I grabbed a six pack from the shop because, meh, why not, might need 'em. Probably the same reason I still have a Fatman in my stash, 'cause..ya never know ;)
---
Can you give the long answer?  I’m genuinely interested in the numbers.
---
I've had instances when doing Surface to Air and  some others that enemies can spawn as 'friendly' disabling vats. It doesn't seem frequent but annoying when it happens.
---
Haha that’s my go to outfit, easy.
---
(The one from the atom store)
---
would be great to have a video or datamined data to proof what some people are saying
---
I noticed this when my Camden daily stopped, then all my dailies stopped. I was randomly walking around and started walking towards the ash heap when the Camden daily started after that all my dailies have been fixed. Maybe it'll work for you? 
---
Went from "Relay Tower DP-B5-21" next to Uncanny Caverns and walked to Lewisberg when the Camden daily triggered again. Hope that works for you.
---
That's really cool, any close up or interior pics?
---
Yes, I’ve seen this at Whitesprings a few times lately. A ghoul will make a sound like they were hit or shot and die. I thought it was odd.
---
Oh, yeah I just looked it up. Its specifically to limbs which does not help me much since I don't use VATS for human combat (has not been working lately?) And I don't have concentrated fire either cuz I don't like the way it works in-game. So I'll stick with bloody mess and 9 points in heavy weapons lol.
---
I ran a church in the mountains west of Watoga for a while. It was really nice and peaceful there. Kinda miss it.
---
The reality is, Good gear is, as a drop rate percent, \_stupidly\_ hard to get in this game. It's completely unbalanced on the server end in a \_bullshit\_ way. The gear you want to be cheaper isn't over priced, bethesda is just  \_comprehensively\_ making it harder and harder to get quality gear, with a nerf to spawns, spawn locations, or 3 star drop chances every few patches.   
---
It's one of the dumbest things they're doing with this game, and that's saying something.
---
I was wondering this same thing...
---
I was surprised how much I like it. Maybe one of my characters will wear it one day lol.
---
I mean you could just shoot them in the legs, but I have no idea if it will work with lmg. Bethesda isn't very accurate in their descriptions
---
I'll personally never purchase atoms if that item, or items like it, are in the shop. By lying to us and putting pay to win bullshit of any stripe in the shop, they've lost any future purchases from me on this title.
---
Dude you got it wrong, it's blocking what people think is THE bot, but it's actually A bot and there are more
---
my advice is focus on your school work 100%
---
you will have the whole rest of your life to play games! you only get the chance at finals once
---
Nice offer. I don’t need it but wanted to applaud your effort.
---
I have had people straight stunlock my character with this
---
ghoul whale time
---
You can still buy high-end weapons for 10-20k . Hell, you can get a decent weapon for 5k. Nobody is going to sell their god rolls for caps... Ever. It doesn't matter how many cap sinks they put in, a max level Bloodied Explosive weapon is always going to be a trade only item. If you had one would you ever let it go for caps?
---
Repost
---
Unfortunately I can't, I would've also celebrated but I'm a PS4 player. Respect for your efforts though!
---
Capes and hoods and scout armor, now I have a new wet dream
---
Necro of an ancient thread, but did we ever find out?
---
I was suspicious until I heard it was ultracite ammo.  With Ammosmith (2), you make over x80 a pop.  With Super Duper (3), you average making over 300 with three craftings.  The recipe requires pure flux, but of a type that is super easy to get the raw version of in a nuked Whitesprings.  With Green Thumb and Super Duper (3), you could easily make enough Pure Flux that you are drowning in it, and crafting ultracite ammo is a good way to get rid of all the excess.  So a player who is farming Whitesprings back when it was constantly being nuked could have made 300K ultracite ammo pretty easily.
---
Thank you everyone for the help about the emote and stuff, and this is why I feel silly and need to work on my anxiety because all I had to do was completely reset the game. Yesterday was my first day playing and when I turned it on today and went to the atomic shop I saw both the emote and the photo frame.
---
Any DR reduces the damage output significantly. I’d suggest using berserker with hazmat in nuke zones. Avoid mutations that give DR/ER to prevent lowering berserkers damage output.
---
They mentioned being able to see a prewview of the type of items being sold. I took that as like this person has "weapons" or this person has "weapons, chems, and drinks"
---
A month ago you could get a full assassin's sentinel set for 10k. Now you can't even buy a piece for 20k. I blame the vendor cap limit being raised. That is the key exploit here. You can theoretically buy a bunch of flux for 30-50 caps ea, make a bunch of serums, put them across 5 characters per account, sell them all to a vendor and clear 7k caps per day. Caps are WAY too easy to obtain now. The only way to make real caps though is to actively trade. I've gone from nothing to a full arsenal of weapons and armor just by merchanting.
---
Rifleman, Tank Killer, VATS/Crit perks
---
my agility is currently 35 (max agility, unyielding &amp; mutations)
---
going full unyielding + escape artist = invisible to most enemies
---
only robobrain can detect me, i think they have the highest perception ingame (correct me if am wrong)
---
since you cant really “measure” how effective sneak is, it all comes to experiment.
---
&gt; better?
---
Yes it is.  Because it doesn't leave out **Massively**.
---
24 per server isn't massive.
---
Just don't claim any workshops. You might have to eat your own words.
---
my IGN is pokerplayr. I will be on by 5pm EDT.
---
Sweet!  Will you be on this eve?  Would love to have a look what you have!  I’m plan hungry right now haha!
---
Well it’s just that I have work Wednesday and Friday and my last two finals are Wednesday and Thursday. So I thought if the update is like 4 am I am going pull an all nighter and write up my final article for my JLMC302 class. If it’s like 11 am I will go to bed.
---
btw your girlfriends breath smells REALLY bad
---
Cheers, very kind of you :)
---
First, look at your fire rate. See the number? Divide that by ten. That is how many bullets shoot per second.
---
Next, calculate damage per bullet. The pipboy will do that for you. The only issue is the furious effect. It will vary with your ability to hit enemies and caps around 50% bonus, I think. I think it is 5% per consecutive bullet.
---
Now multiply your damage by bullets per second to determine damage per second. If mathing is difficult for you, just tell us the damage and fire rate for both and we'll just do it for you.
---
Also, instigating should suck on a minigun. Furious beats that out.
---
Is it good to put all 3 points in every rifleman? Or 3x1 is good enough?
---
It was my understanding you can just turn the power to the veding machine off and it would no longer show on the map
---
Mine isn’t all that fabulous, but it gets the job done. 
---
I bet you’ll find a lot of vending machines next to locked doors though.
---
The in game economy is controlled by a portion of the player base that  literally has nothing else to do in their spare time but play the game.... they can farm more, craft more because they're spending pathological amounts of time playing this game.
---
I agree with you. If more players just laughed and said "hah, hell no... keep your pretend weapons and gear, I'll go trade with that dude over there that doesn't think caps are real" then we'd see it level out. 
---
Hell, I trade stuff piece for piece. A few hundred caps, maybe a sweet plan I don't have.. you get, I get, everyone is happy.
---
Also, who are these people that think it takes 30 minutes to launch a nuke?
---
Agreed but I also think Sentinel and Cavalier are a little too over powered. Having a 75% damage reduction gives such a huge advantage. Even people with massive DR/ER don't stand a chance.
---
Very cool!
---
I need to find a better place for my camp...the issue is though that there's not enough flat spaces big enough for my camp. My camp is long as I designed my house as a 1950s era house so it looks like one of those but finding a place that's flat and big enough to hold it is...pretty impossible.
---
not really since if they gave us like 10 a hour for 100 steel you would still need them in bulk it would just slow the need for crafters
---
also if you made it flux needed to make the factory it would also reduce it to end game people who need massive amounts
---
Yes, and that shit ruined the economy of the game.
---
I see where you are coming from but if you go back to my original comment I said I was hoping they would 'rebalance' Assassin and leave Sentinel alone which is what I referring to. Somewhere around this thread I proposed the not-very-original solution of making both Sentinel and Assasin 'third slot' prefixes so an armor cannot be both.
---
Moreover the comment you are replying to is exclusively aimed at PvE where Assasin is irrelevant.
---
Said that yes, I can see how stacking flat DM over flat DM can become frustrating, more so if is true what another fellow player was saying about some people abusing AP refreshing consumables - possibly obtained illegitimately - and an exploit I wasn't aware of that allows to jump in place and still keep the Sentinel effect active.
---
Ultimately rather than 'do not change anything or else' is more of a 'stop changing things with PvE as an afterthought'.
---
Maybe Sentinel does need rebalancing for PvE. maybe it doesn't. But no one is discussing that, even though they created an entire PvP centric game mode I only read that is causing issues in PvP and the entire mechanic has to change for everyone like yesterday, PvE be damned, instead of changing how it behaves in PvP so is no longer an issue and then looking and if and how it needs rebalancing in PvE.
---
Nope. Solo player with maxed caps . But good for them!
---
Simple: If you play the game you quickly figure that those kits have zero impact on gameplay.
---
The hate train was from people who whine before trying or don't even play the game.
---
Omg that would be wonderful lol, I don't have alot of problems as far as that goes, but that would be nice.
---
I think I chose a good time to play, because that would have pissed me off (someone destroying my stuff).  Seems like good changes IMO and I'm glad that they have made a separate mode for this sort of thing.  It just doesn't interest me at all.
---
yeah i made a post about that today as well
---
it just seems like they forgot to finish it or something? 
---
I mean what artist thought that it looked ok like that?
---
We should be able to craft many more ammo for heavy guns...like: 50.Cal 180 bullets to 300 bullets.
---
Or at least a non-traditional-RPG Fallout
---
Well they do if you look when at a work bench and your repairing
---
NPC vendors could be a solution to remove caps and create more "Item for Item" trades.
---
Ahhh fuckin' ell, that's where it is!  Thanks man, I wouldn't have thought to check there.  Cheers
---
...and you're welcome. 
---
It's a slow road to gathering acid, but it's consistent, and can be done while doing other stuff.
---
The songs all sound the same to me, but they get me with their radiant energy.
---
Dont think so....
---
I enjoy the game so I throw $10 or $20 at it sometimes. I will say the atomic shop doesn't have much that really interests me. Hoping there will be more exciting content later.
---
I thought all Fallout games limited teleport in interiors?
---
Griefing, uh... finds a way.
---
It depends on what you're going for in your build, but 9 is better than 3. I'm curious, why no stealth perks? Non Auto rifles are basically made for being sneaky.
---
&gt;Maybe Bethesda could add a mic emote so we could signal people we want to speak to them using voice.
---
Fuckin briliant, that is.  I'd definitely use it if it was available.
---
Probably
---
I'll take it :) I'm on Xbox
---
Fair enough. I just like being able to sell 300 at a time to single player and make a grand out of it. Really just wanting the market to stay the same cuz I'm already falling behind to the try-hards.
---
May not be a popular position, but I'll upvote.
---
Been playing long enough to see some stuff at vendors for under 500 caps, but live dealers asking multiple thousands for the same item...think I'll pass and keep playing with the weapons and armor I've found...that usually work quite nicely for me....
---
Exactly! Item for Item trades should be pushed at this point.
---
Yes they said you'd only be visible on the map if your vending machine was powered. Personally I'd probably forget to disconnect or turn it off with a switch, or I'd forget to turn it back on after. Storing is just the solution that would work best for me personally :)
---
Okay...its been like years since i played so....yeah pistol rifle whatever...
---
So if we have to get rid of turrets to stop griefers from shooting them and initiating combat how are we supposed to protect our bases from the random mobs?
---
Bloody explosive weapons are not always trade. I do alot of in game trading and ran into a dude at overseers camp who sold me my bloody, explosive, faster reload double barrel for 2500 caps. I also like to throw up the trade emote after events to see if anyone would like to do any buying or selling. I have got a couple of Sentinel pieces this way for no more than maybe 700 on avg per piece. You can get pretty much everything on the cheap if you take your time and look around.
---
yeah but silencers really kill the range/accuracy on shotties
---
 i understand since youre going to try sneaking you can get up close and personal, but still it must be taken into account
---
I'll keep the spray and pray thing in mind, great tip.  I think there's a lot of high level players who are either bored, or like helping newbs out, or both lol.  Because I've only had one person my own level invite me to a group; the rest have been over level 80.
---
Have to get killed by another player.
---
Just store your junk and let someone kill you, alternatively, a friend, and they can give you the caps back.
---
Got it. Thanks. So, basically even is Sneak was doing something at those high stat numbers, it’s marginal at best and not worth spending the points.
---
Legendary affixes just shouldn't stack, full stop.
---
Ah damn, well, if you’re looking to farm out legendaries, I have had good luck at Watoga EMS and West Tek, and Whitespring Nukezone is still killer on occasion, you’ve just gotta get lucky with it.
---
Sounds good! I have a LOT of antiseptic
---
Yeah well 25k is stupid....for a coat.
---
You either live long enough for it to drop off or you die. Just store your junk now and then die by someone
---
Yeah, if you can get it for 20-30 USD. It might be worth that, in my mind.
---
Store your junk and let it happen, good buddy. 👍 Best case scenario. 
---
And thank you for the story.
---
i think there is a perk card that gives heavy weapons armor piercing if you are in PA
---
Dunno don’t like the way it plays
---
Ok if it’s automatic? What perks good for auto?
---
But 15 agi = 75% Stealth bonus. 75% is not the cap? 
---
15 agi + sneak = 150% stealth bonus?
---
Probably a set of Unyielding armor
---
I’m really unlucky though
---
That's not a glitch. When you take a workshop, you agree to be open to PVP. No geographical restrictions. If you are engaged in PVP with someone, they can attack your CAMP. The solution is to decide that the risks associated with taking a workshop are not outweighed by the benefits and not take them or be on your guard (which includes not showing hostiles where your CAMP is by avoiding it entirely while you engage in risky and rewarding behavior). You don't need to visit your CAMP. You can build benches at all your workshops.   
---
I both capture workshops and hunt people at them. While I don't destroy CAMPs myself, the issue isn't a "glitch" with workshopping. It's that you left yourself open to it by accepting a warning box that tells you you are open to PVP.
---
For big guns I guess it depends on which ones in particular you are using. I use a gatling gun when I'm out and about around the map and about and get a similar ammo experience to my rifle build. 5mm are fairly cheap to make and can be found on super mutants. My gatling one or two shots most enemies. Other big guns like my plasma gatling are for special occasions like the queen and sheepsquatch.
---
Going up dolly sods way I'll see the bears be fine one second and suddenly they'll just fall over dead. Sometimes it's a ghoul officer since they have to be able to be killed by players and not random enemies, but still
---
Yup, randomly dying mobs...I too can confirm that this happens sometimes.  You'll hear their death noise - what's really harsh is that I can't even loot them if I find their corpse. 
---
One time I actually saw the ghoul at Whitesprings die like this. It was just walking along on the porch of one of the buildings and died for no reason I could see - I  didn't see anything in the terrain that could have caused it.
---
Seems sporadic though. I can go for an entire session without seeing it happen once, other times it seems like every other mob just dies before I can get to it.
---
What? That looks awesome! How do you have the budget? Is it mostly un-furnished?
---
well i hope the turrets will act like the other CAMP items and be player-damage proof if you are in pacifist mode
---
For 10 cap bounty? Stash your junk then ask someone to kill you. I had a small bounty due to missed shot and went to WS and climbed on car at main entrance in my underwear and asked anyone that could hear me to take my bounty. Took all of 15 minutes.
---
The railway rifle is stupid long with its long barrel. Thats your best bet
---
yeah, for sure, people can still kite enemies into your camp and let them do the destroying i guess
---
Did I hafta read this just before pizza was ready?
---
My psn is darthdudical. When do you usually play? I’m on around 2am EST US. I can hop on during the day for a quick trade sometimes though.
---
To my knowledge, yes. I've never gotten them consistently in the same spot. The highest chance at any game is the mutant shack from my personal experience.
---
If not mistaken the plan is for all future content to be free. They expect to make their money from the atom shop.
---
The last 4 3* enemies I’ve killed I’ve got wooden cloaking left arm
---
Ammo, junk, or trade
---
They want you to spend real world money for Atoms.  As they should.   But I do think they would make more money if they charged lower prices at higher volume.
---
15 agi + full unyielding set + Bird bones Mutation + Harness underarmor + 1 point from my weapon = 38 agi = 455 action points
---
Is there any other confirmed way to get the Advanced ones? I've not had a one in my inventory, advance or otherwise, but still.
---
Honestly, drop $20 every couple months. As long as you aren't buying power armor skins and such you can deck out your CAMP on the cheap. I'm considering dropping another $20 soon.
---
It is a combination of things really, duping getting a smackdown has caused values to rise as well
---
For a sec there I thought it said Warhorse armour.......
---
Its hilarious how people get so mad about someone destroying your camp ( yes its happened to me too ) but all you have to do is repair all. Meanwhile people seem to accept all bugs &amp; glitches in the game 😁
---
yes, from what i’ve seen, having 3xSneak is pointless once you have 35-37 agility, better use something else since there are many perks in agility skill trees :)
---
The universal sign sign for 'please kill me to get rid of my bounty' is hanging around a train station naked.
---
It's gone now, but it was a hangout for theme park employees, Imagineers, Houston Astros, and locals. They served drinks in mason jars, their signature drink was "Swamp Water", and the walls were covered in name tags and mementos left by patrons. For a while there was a bar in Minute Maid Park named the Bamboo Lounge in honor of the original.

---
Ya I think it does
---
What do U need most? I have lots to trade - plenty of bulk junk, can craft lots of ammo etc.
---
I was speaking more about the trading forums, but I do agree with you, other players you just meet in game sometimes do sell high end stuff for cheap. I personally wouldn't buy something like that shotgun at that price without talking to the other player first and making sure they know what it's actually worth.
---
Well luckily nobody is forcing you to buy it 👍
---
I do that anyways I guess I’ll get it over with
---
The kits in the store are ridiculous. The kits dropped off the queen are better and have essentially removed the need to repair your own gear with how many drop.
---
Oh hell... If I'm playing a melee build... ammo and guns are worthless to me. I'll happily trade them for stuff I'll use...  same goes for all builds.
---
Turning a video game into a full time job, enlisting friends to act as mules while I swap characters and jump servers to hoard items and caps, and exploit weight limits... is batshit crazy behaviour, IMO. This shit ain't real, and in five years, looking back, it will all just be wasted time and effort. Are you having "more fun" than I am, sitting on your virtual hoard of fake bottle caps, and spending all your time trying to "sell" fake weapons? 
---
I, honestly, can't wrap my head around the mentality.
---
About 75% of the time I get him to spawn at Charleston station, he isn't by the station but is on the north side of the red train bridge north of the station, which isn't blocked by people building camps at the pond.
---
Id have to take more today.
---
People are still mad

If you find me ask me a question about faschnat and you’ll get a free mask!

IGN: Bilgerat23
---
Can someone let me know if this is normal? I've spawned the vendor twice today, the first time, he fell over and died for no reason before I could reach him to trade. Now the 2nd time, I bought some stuff off him and then he fell randomly fell over dead while I was still browsing his inventory. Is this normal?
---
your post should be pinned as a bug tracker, so we can add informations and stuff and have it all in one thread. anyways.
---
bugs:
---
9: i hate this one. found an awesome item. cant trade it for the awesome weapon i want because of this bug. to know its there since beta really feelsbad.
---
12: i think this has something to do with you base rendering into the world. after its complete you'll be able to fasttravel.
---
new: not all mods working. i.e. the + unarmed damage mod on combat armor limbs.
---
new: melee attacks often dont register. this made me stop playing melee.
---
new: item vanishing or whatever bug. it just happened to me. there are some strange things happens. i.e. quickslots changed or deleted after every serverjoin. after a while weapon gone. another example: joined a world and had no pa left leg. it was in the inventory but was somehow faded and i couldnt bring it on the chassis. after one restart the leg was back on the chassis and everything normal.
---
suggestions:
---
new: a small weight stash which all your characters have access to. so that you can mule items easily. this would be that i want the most.
---
new: a LOT of more pa-paints, outfits, weapon paints etc. inside the game. maybe very long questchains. i like the atom shop and already bought some stuff, but a game with full price should have way more of the stuff they selling for money inside the game.
---
new:  more worldbosses. we could have a supermutant boss (behemoth?), a crafton monster boss and so on. would be cool if everyone have a different way to summon.
---
new: factions and special faction themed perks you only can use when playing that faction. nothing overpowered or damage increasing stuff so we dont get the one to go faction.
---
cheers and good evening.
---
Silt beans (these are even cultivated in a plot in flatwoods), starlight creeper, ginseng root, tarberries, cranberries, aster flower, soot flower, rhodedron...
---
what else is wild-harvestable but not plantable?
---
I got a BE lever and bloody handmade for 6k package deal a few months ago. Grinded like hell for that 6k too lol.  Probably the most fun I've had this far.
---
This. The kits in the store are useless.
---
Why would anyone put anything else in? They'd want their loot. Then the punch bowl would go from 99% nukashine to 99% poison.
---
For auto you'll want Commando instead of rifleman, everything else the same.
---
Furious by far, dont even need to know the numbers for that.
---
#DeadGame
---
If you hit the imposter sheepsquatch with a Cryolator in the last moments before death the body will glow blue.
---
Its cuz someone else spawned into the area... its stupid
---
Would it make you feel any better if I told you that he/she dies of old age? Because that is quite literally what probably happened. :)
---
I'm serious, too! lol   
---
The game will "kill" stuff after a certain period of time after they've spawned, to make sure they don't become "stale" for the next person who wanders in. For example, if you are a high level and spawn in a bunch of lvl 68 beasties, a lvl 20 won't encounter them, they'll respawn more their level.
---
You can see this in action all the time at Watoga. You'll see a bot in the distance clanking along so you run (or sneak) up to it to turn it into a scrap pile and just as you get to it.... \*ragdoll collapse\*  
---
Or when you get near one of the Bot Builder Tubes. The sound cue happens, the door opens, and right as it takes its first step ***\*RAGDOLL'ed!\**** lol
---
So dry those eyes. Murgle lived a long and happy life!  
---
.... Unlike the Murgle I encountered a couple weeks back, who screeched the same way, only for me to find.... it had went out of phase with our dimension only to phase back in right in the middle of the wall on one of the counters! &lt;\_&gt; Front half was sticking out facing the road, back half was under the counter, bifurcated by the piece of plywood (but not two 'pieces' of kitty heh).
---
BE Careful of items you select for sale to avoid a rage-filled wtf when your favorite TSE whatsis items disappear unintentionally.
---
Would be a great idea if a For Sale tab could be created so you can dump whatevers into that, to keep seperate.
---
They are trade-only at this point.
---
I found that adding spotlights helped my turret reliability a lot!
---
I'd like to have every single one on PS4 too but stuck at 97% because of "the hacking 50 terminals" broken one even if I hacked more than 64 (much much more than that in fact) ...
---
Yeah that's exactly what happened before. Dupers got banned, prices went up. Duping came back for a bit, prices tanked. That got patched, prices went up, but now they're skyrocketing almost exponentially it seems.
---
why the heavy weapon damage perks wile using a tse if they say " your non explosive weapons "
---
I play just fine with the traveling pharmacy perk, and a few other rank one reduction perks. I dont know why you think it is "unplayable". Unless you want a game that just allows you to carry whatever you want with no survival mechanics.
---
It's not just software developers that do that kinda thing... tech-savvy photographers, web developers, tech-savvy people who just really like to organize their files... lol
---
Many moons ago I said that the legendary mechanic in general was a bad idea that got in the way of properly balancing the game and I was almost eaten alive.
---
Here we are, months later and the legendary mechanic is getting in the way of balancing the game.
---
Not because is not possible, because possible it is.
---
It just takes a lot time and effort to evaluate how this 'magical mumbo jumbo' properties interact with each other and the devs have their hands full pressing on with the road map schedule - which is behind schedule - which leads to them having to be reactive - sometimes protractively reactive if that makes any sense - rather than proactive and that always ends up leaving a bitter taste in my mouth.
---
You get the games by collecting Robco mags. Looting the mag gives you the game. Except Grognak Ruby Ruins which is a set spawn and Nuka Tapper which is as well. However Nuka Tapper can world spawn as well. Found the mag for Nuka Tapper at the Sons of Dane compound a few weeks ago.
---
Hopefully when i come home from work, the problems is resolved. 
---
I see im not the only one reporting this problem today.
---
Wtf Bethesda! Your communication is shit
---
Agreed. And if we are being honest there's grief in war lol. Bethesda has modeled a utopian atmosphere that feels cooperative but it's artificial.
---
Hey, I got that unable to stash PA, for me it was because it would cause me to be over encumbered. I switched a couple of Perks and it let me pick it up. annoying af, but I think that's the mechanics behind the "bug"
---
Really fantastic! Do you guys have any more cosplay pictures?
---
It's a hard world out there, son. Pay yer caps and move on. And let this be a lesson to you - even churches aren't Sanctuary in West Virginia.
---
Yeah. Cooked meats are actually pretty valuable vendor fodder. Plus the experience you get from cooking.
---
They really shouldn't be that much - although idk what platform you are on but I picked up a 3star bloodied / swing speed / bowie knife for like 4k and a combat knife with the same perks for 5k? don't overpay! if you're on xbox I can try to help you find them?
---
I'd have way over 300 screws if I didn't sell them on a regular basis
---
thanks for the links , it was neat to check out
---
i wonder how the disney employees partied at night after having to be all goody goody all day
---
&lt;blinks&gt; Thought that bare-ass looked familiar....
---
You could easily up your difficulty yourself if you wanted to by running higher health :).
---
look at the gallery.
---
Yeah if the caps limit stays the way it is, that’d suck really bad..
---
Found those as a wet-behind-the-ears whippersnapper just trying to get to the cool-looking water slides. That was *not* a good day.
---
My eyes look like they are bleeding but that's unrelated.
---
thanks but im well aware of the "glitch"
---
**Workshop PVP in Adventure Mode should stay in the Workshop**
---
THIS is how it should work:
---
I take a workshop, and i leave the workshop area to go about my business, then, i see someone has contested my workshop
---
I should have 2 options:
---
1) I ignore the contesting player, and i lose my workshop, pvp is over as i've lost my workshop
---
2) I decide to defend the workshop, pvp does not start until I return to the workshop and enter the green-border limit- then PVP is on! 
---
PvP can then happen anywhere on the map until either myself or the other player dies.
---
that is it!
---
ill say it again: WORKSHOP PVP in Adventure Mode SHOULD STAY IN THE WORKSHOP
---
none of this "2 players team up, one stalks the workshop owner back to his house, the other then initiates workshop contesting, then the other teammate who has been stalking the other player simply 1 shots them at their house"
---
Be aware that "raider" oriented discord channels are planning to go for one last "bash" tonight.  Hide your camp, hide your kids.
---
I did, are those all the rooms then?
---
I’m on very often. Chances are you will see me online.
---
I have that issue with bots on parade.  For some reason half the enemies show up friendly and since one of the recent patches vats no longer targets friendlies.
---
I've definitely had things go missing from my stash, as I note down every weapon and armour piece I put in there. Could be desync after I've just stashed something and logged out, who knows.
---
All future DLC will be free! Best place to soak up some info would be on their weekly "Inside the vault article" \_ I'd link you but I'm at work rn D: 
---
Plus lucky you - there's an update tomorrow with a new questline for backpacks!!
---
He hasn't played in a while, doesn't know where to place a camp, and needs advice on an armor set up, (all according to his post history) but also knows a very secret and guarded way to dupe items.
---
He's totally legit, dude.
---
Grab your x-01 and put a little paint on
---
I haven't had my CAMP destroyed yet luckily, but couldn't you just scrap it then rebuild without losing extra materials? Whenever my crops get destroyed I just scrap them and rebuild it using the same corn instead of repairing it.
---
If you have the plan, build some rifles and scrap them, that will give you the mods, if not, collect from enemies and scrap :)
---
good call, i kinda thought they might, im actually hoping to get the "your camp could not be placed" message tonight hehe
---
Yeah Level 17 is a bit tricky lol 
---
When i did my first try to visit Whitespring i took the road east of Charleston as Level 20+/-
---
Well...the scorchbeast encounter taught me that the ash heap would be also nice to visit lol
---
Dw, I listen to all forms of metal and still have no clue what half the labels mean
---
True, but with escape artist you could potentially run straight at an enemy, crouch down, engage point blank sneak, and dump into them.
---
Ill be honest I only use 2 mods, better inventory and the perk loader manager, the latter requires a .dll in the game directory so who knows if thats bannable probably not if its not doing any thing malicious. the only other issue is that you have to modify the custom.ini, if the game updates like it will tomorrow, it may add more files that won't be told to load through the custom.ini so you have to manually update your ini every time the game updates (assuming it adds new files to load) because they won't load and you'll have invisible walls and missing textures and other weird shit.
---
Alright well now that I know that, I'll be sure to hurry up if there's someone near me who looks like they want to use the same vendor/npc.  Strange game design though.
---
That's a ridiculous system you've devised. It's also not remotely how it works or how they intended it. Workshops are meant for PVP. It's the one area where they don't go full carebear in Adventure.
---
#COMMUNISM IS THE DEFINITION OF FAILURE
---
I know I've talked about it before with a couple friends to have like a bank that opens up like an event and then you can defend the bank and things like that. So you can store caps but could have a chance to lose like a percentage or something? I think it would be fun- and a way to store caps + caps sink a little bit?
---
I'm sorry I just read that like loud Howard from Dilbert. Lol
---
The supply of currency is primarily linked to events and vendors.
---
And i agree items hold value rather then caps but that is what the tax is trying to change, items hold a larger value then caps because they are limited in numbers compared to caps.
---
When you start to take money out of the economy suddenly the value of the currency increases and they will be used more when buying items from other players thus increasing their value even more.
---
We need cap sinks because people can get insane amounts of currency everyday with minimal effort that never leaves the system.
---
And i really don't think 10% does little to remove money from the system, compared to how it is now.
---
At the moment basically the only constant capsink is ft and that only removes a very small amount of caps, but i cant say anything for sure and we will just have to see what happens.
---
The text on the mirror is why I will never use it
---
I believe it is the white knight perk, rank 3, drops the ballistic fiber required to one or 2 per repair. I only equip it when I repair armor because it does not fit into my build. But that and heavy farming early on has netted me an abundance of the stuff. (100+)
---
I'm clicking as hard as I can but am not getting the free picture
---
I have heard rumor of a decorator mode in the future that will let us place junk as decor. I haven't seen anything from Bethesda but several streamers and forums have mentioned it.
---
Hype for Backpacks.
---
Yes absolutely, regardless of the price, its worth it
---
Did you ever manage to sort this out?
---
I know they made, or are making PvP dedicated servers. Does that mean that there is no more PvP on normal servers? Or is it still that stupid pacifist thing, where people can attack you, and just deal reduced damage? Outside of the massively flawed and empty game, the biggest reason I stopped playing were all of the assholes that would just start following me around attacking me for no reason, other than them just being assholes.
---
Fair enough but that dons't mean shotguns shouldn't get a nerf to they never got one.
---
Or babe them like the Brahmin, with an object that spawns them. So if they die I can fix them. My black cat lasted less than 24 hours. :(
---
Don't know how to post video but can prob do screen shot of 1 v 3 pieces.
---
Get killed.
---
I’m lvl 82, and have been playing the game since November. I never knew that you could select a second wheel of emotes! Thank you!
---
Sentinels is fair, assassins is fair, a full suit of sentinel assassins isn’t. That is the entire problem with nerfing it.
---
Best use of atoms I've spent
---
I thought this happened once. A scorched with an assault rifle was killing me off super quickly, I think he was applying stacks of poison per hit. I was still relatively new to the game so I thought he spawned with a bleeding assault rifle, got super excited. He ended up dropping a 1* lead pipe or something. I guess the game just bugged and combined two enemies again, he probably just had the poison effect of stingwings or ghouls or something else that spawns in the area.
---
That really sucks
---
Hello if anyone is still looking at this, I’m also looking for possible rewards to spend faction currency on
---
Are they increasing cap stash limits? 25k will go fast if you’re selling a lot of good stuff
---
I almost bricked a save because I saved moments before getting assaulted by a synth with an explosive SMG
---
Does the Manta Man outfit count?
---
"Just breathe deeply and relax. It'll be over quick if you're real quite like," he said while Dueling Banjos played in the background.
---
Wait... what? The punch bowl is functional?!
---
In the immortal words of Henchman 21 - Why doesn't anyone tell me these things?!
---
Explosive heavy weapons are hilariously underpowered* 
---
Non-explosive heavy weapons could still use some buffing for sure.
---
Ooh, good to know. I'll definitely be looking into that. Thanks!
---
I play with the u/fo76filthycasuals community and there are a couple of people who can blast through the silo in about 30 with melee. They will do 3 in a session for scorchbeast queen.
---
Way above my pay grade (or actually education level),  I know it's been done in the past to map WoW continents, but the method was different there in that he system had an overhead feature built in (the mini-map) that could be 'borrowed' from.
---
I'd assume the easiest way is to capture larger images than 1 pixel, but the process would be essentially the same.  You couldn't easily do it in-game, but I'd think the whole model-space of the world could be gotten somehow, at which point it becomes much less technical in execution, and more simple data gathering and stitching at whatever resolution you wanted to work with.
---
Two thumbs up.
---
No its the one in the miyer the green one with the back pack with duck tape on it
---
Can't wait for the first "how log will it take?" comments lol
---
On Amazon I saw new PS4 copies for 18 bucks. "Used" PC copies for under 30.
---
That's like comparing call of duty to world of Warcraft, sure both are online but that's almost the only thing they have in common.
---
All those games (which you mentioned) run on dedicated servers, that's the difference.
---
Sure fallout could just swap to completely player run servers but they'd have to make extensive tools for server hosters to combat cheating etc etc
---
Also that would completely ruin this game because this is not a open world survival game like all the ones you listed, this is a lootershooter/rpg that heavily relies that people keep playing to grind for the cool stuff.
---
That just doesn't work if i can make my own server, open console and spawn every god tier item in the game.
---
Yeah you may be onto something there.  Definitely worth a test run or two to see how it works (before committing too much into a new storefront build).
---
The crew I play with does silo in about 15 minutes, solo or duo. 5 minute queens.
---
That looks so cool!!
---
"I've got an error when login in, am i ban ? This game sucks &gt;:("
---
what is "drifting" and bad deadzones
---
Country scorchcore anyone?
---
I know the lighting is cool, but that only lasts as long as anything other purely visual thing.
---
For about 10 minutes, then you remember its just the same place but with different lighting.
---
I would love that vendors were able to owe us money. As much they wanted! 
---
Maybe via perk?
---
Same 1.400 caps/day limit is fine, but we could sell ALL our unwanted ítems to vendors, over 1.400 caps. vendors give us 1.400 today and they owe us the rest.
---
Deathclaws have always been pretty easy by end game across all the 3D fallouts in my experience - u just need to find a good build that can handle them - so FO76 is no different in that respect.   I was plenty terrified of them in early game play...
---
And If you want them to be more difficult, that’s not hard to do just pull out some perk cards u are using or whatever ... Bethesda doesn’t need to do this for you !  You can do it yourself!
---
Lastly - other players are the new deathclaws in FO76 - you want  to get the adrenaline pumping just head over to survival mode and you will learn to fear the *crackle*crackle* that proceeds a very quick death 😂😂. If you want tougher enemies there  are plenty ....
---
No, that is evidence of the fact that they had/have many accounts, each with five characters, that held inventory.  They were wiped down to one each just like everyone else but may have had 25 characters,  If duping was ongoing you’d see prices lowering in the trading subReddits.
---
Hyped for backpacks, player vending, and new atom shop datamines
---
Also, i need to offload my stash of legendaries.
---
It is! I plan on posting the entire journey/story at some point. I'm still working on it quite a bit.
---
So far it seems like it’s the only way to get plans for some weapons and armor at any reasonable rate, because they certainly aren’t dropping very fast. Combine that with fact that you don’t always get a plan from scrapping a weapon and relying on random drops is certainly not the best way to do it.
---
That would be awesome. A separate bank that allows you to go over the cap, but it's going to require you to defend it from time to time. I could see that being an entirely new story mission with an old bank filled with Mr. Handy tellers.
---
Enemies in some events - Bots on Parade being the best example - have been spawning as 'neutral' for quite a long time.
---
However a couple of patches back they changed VATS behaviour so it would only target hostiles.
---
This was a welcome change becuase targetting neutrals/friendlies was a PITA in events with 'high attendance' or 'defend NPC x' situations and particularly frustrating if one used Gun-Fu.
---
However the side effect is that those 'spawns' need to be made hostile before they can be targetted in VATS.
---
Lol ok
---
Both locks count in an owned workshop. You probably experienced server lag and the flag just happened to finally show up about the time you picked up buttercup.
---
I am all for this.  Of course, I'd hardly ever know because of snipering.
---
That being said, it would seriously limit what you can get from enemies.  So many pipe, laser and assault rifles off super mutants.  Soooo many shotguns and gauntlets off mole miners.
---
Would all animals, bugs, robots and cryptids only drop armor?
---
I would love to have a doorbell on my camp. I think that would be hilarious to have people at the door. Or even if they rang it and ran away I would laugh my ass off. Damn kids!!!
---
Well, it's a scrap mod, with a chance of 10% per scrap. You can get unlucky and not unlock the last mod after 20 scraps, but usually it's faster.
---
It's possible that you bugged out your account, given the bogus notification. Log on and off in case there's a desync.
---
Angry Enclave Soldier strikes back,
---
When you go to out your stick back in center but it doesn't center all the way, so your character will walk a little or move the cursor.
---
A bank bot, even if just for caps, would be great.
---
From an outside perspective, we probably both do. Arguing over a video game.
---
I accidentally used one to repair my weapon last night. :(
---
And one of my teddy bear collection apparantly has lead in it because the tinker bench keeps wanting to turn it into bullets.
---
Hopefully when the display shelves arrive, to objects on display will be protected from scrapping and crafting!
---
hmm, I haven't had that issue.
---
Only the top contributor, tagging will earn you a rad-x and a random rolling pin. This will make people play harder and less tag-and-hide. Most of the usual taggers simply won’t show up, which will save everyone a lot of time.
---
It's all on the bethesda site, the road map.
---
Thats not bad. And tbh it's not too resource heavy if you buff melee and dash through.
---
Staggering is currently the only counter so I’d suggest pro-stagger effects. They could add something that either makes your character move, or stop moving to the syringer. You could have the bat from Jamaica Plains effect that could work on players too. We need other options for armor which I’d suggest be something along the lines of avoid x% of damage for being over encumbered which wouldn’t be as strong as sentinel/cavaliers but it could be a fun packrat build armor. If I had more time I could list them all day, so these are just some of my ideas.
---
I've seen the bot up by WV lumber, also.
---
Like a paper receipt for a specific amount of caps that you could turn in at any time as long as the vendor has that amount of caps. That would be pretty nice. I could do a weeks worth of cap farming in one day and then just turn in a receipt once a day for the rest of the week. I don't think Bethesda would like that though.
---
yes
---
Incorrect.
---
Only started playing again recently, game feels a lot smoother. I feel like I'm not getting nearly as many legendary enemy spawns nor good drops from Nuke Zones though. Did they change something?
---
I generally only use heavy guns for the scorch beasts and SBQ. Otherwise its rifles and melee. Almost finished getting a pistol wielding alt leveled up but still use the action hero with him in a SBQ fight.
---
This would go against the spirit of the game:
---
1 step forward, 2 steps back.
---
As such, I cannot support this.
---
And I can almost guarantee you that one of tomorrow's daily challenges will be 'Claim a Workshop'.
---
Yeah I think it would be a lot of fun personally. Also a way to transfer items / caps between your own characters safely via a deposit box?
---
Usually happens with controllers there a bit older and games that have small or no deadzones
---
Mmm, I've clocked up over 150 hours with only a single crash... at probably the most insanely annoying time though (low level, first time doing a powering up event, by myself, not knowing at all what to do and completely under prepared, scraped through by the skin of my teeth, one or two more repairs to complete the event and... Boof).
---
This is sooo me it hurts lmao
---
90% of the reason I wanted Marsupial was to get into/get a better look at peoples' locked CAMPs.
---
Do we know if they keep perks under PA?
---
Corn soup, ultra light armor mod and canned coffee
---
The cultist dagger non legendary is very good as well.
---
The flatwoods monster actually counted for the challenge?
---
Prove it
---
I just did this yesterday...i spent tge last two weks grinding atoms for whatever pa comes out tomorrow..bought lets play..back to 240..
---
 *do not offer any benefits while you are in Power Armor*
---
There is the civil unrest which gives an extra 10 ap but that's all o can think of
---
Are you on Xbox? I want to come visit!
---
Visual is emotional. I'm a photographer in the real world.
---
Hell yeah.
---
Yeah, I can't be mad at whoever did it. No one MADE me go check out this new location on the map instead of heading down to Whitespring.  And to do it in a Hazmat suit instead of my power armor. They took a gamble with their time, and it paid off.
---
On market you constantly see people wanting to trade several god tier weapons and armors for something unique, that tells ya those people have plenty of those common god rolls but want you to give up your special ones so they can... maybe dupe it you’d think?
---
Plz tell me you are on xbox you will be the only vendor I go to
---
Never once have i been hated on for my junk bag..
---
Dear Bethesda, fix Grounded mutation Class Freak bug, please.
---
Shame one can't unlock achievements on PC due them being bugged :(
---
Lakelurks any1?
---
This.... But only due to the chronology of my experience of it...
---
Friend and I were trekking West/North-West from Watoga when we came across the Freak Show. 
---
At that time *(and I think there may have been a hiccup in where the human corpse spawned)*, it appeared to me as though the dog was in the cage and was being jabbed at by someone outside with the pitchfork. As a person who has almost always had a dog as a member of the family, this hit me right in the feels. Mainly because I think there was a note on the ground, or maybe a name tag on the model, but *something* indicated it had an owner and wasn't just a feral dog. 
---
Fast forward a month or so while playing on my other character, who had also already been to the Freak Show by that point...
---
I had read that there was a Random Encounter up the hill more. So I wander in from the nearest place I had previously discovered, which much to my surprise the location doesn't look like what is painted on the map; it's actually a Ranger Tower... Rather well fortified with traps, too. So clearly this was someone's home *after* the bombs fell.
---
I get up there to find quite a bit of the usual sort of supplies, completely discounted the fact there's a dog bowl given it's not the first one I've up in a watch tower... Then I discover the note...  
---
Whomever lived there had their dog stolen and added into some asshole's tra...veling fre... freak show... Awww hell :(  
---
That dog was this man's best friend... T\_T And... he has left everything up there to me, because he's going to go get his dog back, or will be happy to have at least died trying! ;(
---
R.I.P. Good Sir and Four-legged Companion...  
---
 *\*sniff\** Hits me right in the feels aaalllll over again.
---
Nice! Thanks for the info, not really considered utilising unyielding yet.
---
hehe well im glad i could be the one to enlighten you!
---
Bingo, that’s exactly my observation as well. The ‘god roll’ they offer is worthless to them because they have mules upon mules carrying them, it’s your new find that they are after.
---
yes, I know that is how most of them are acting, and yes, I know many of them opened an insane amount of accounts, to stock "one single copy of every top item" in every character to make fun of Bethesda and to make fun of legit users.
---
tbh, some eBay sellers restock, but some others don't. ( I follow them)
---
Sure duping is nothing compared with what it was in the "free duping era", but I am pretty sure it's still going on.
---
So would explosive cryolator or tesla viable for PvP?
---
We'll tuned, legendary armor effects, and several different power armor mods.
---
yeah im not sure what id do with all those caps... i guess it will be a good problem to have though
---
Treetops in The Mire, North of Camp Venture.
---
One of my favourite places in the game - honestly I cannot wait for a FO76 version of Place Anywhere so I can attempt to build a CAMP like that - and is full of hides everywhere.
---
Fundamentally, it's far easier to make 25k caps than to find a good weapon with two good stars, particularly now that the vendor caps take so little time to farm.
---
If you don't want to spend big money on top-tier weapons then just stick to one-star stuff. It makes the game slightly less of a cakewalk at least.
---
The "sunshine" holotape in Glassed Caverns.
---
For Fo4, it was [David's Holotape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhWYHDPBW1M).
---
Agree.  Just boost the perk to 5 levels topping out at 200%.  There’s plenty of crafting only perk cards, good that agility gets a buffed one of its own beside white knight!
---
Can't see any reason to buy them from the atomic shop. The queen drops improved repair kits. I've used the ones I've gotten from the queen.
---
There is a lore way to expand on this:
---
The cthuluesque; interloper, that involves tentacle monsters. 
---
*My name is Jeff Lane, and I will lay bear this... watcher. No matter how deep I must go, I will come to know the true nature of the Interloper...I have heard a tale of this entity made real... deep in the earth...His believers wept, for their new home lacked water and their throats were dry. He gathered their tears in His branches and spread them upon the earth, and from that came forth the springs.”
---
The interloper creatures live in the deepest parts of earth. Possibly in caves at the bottom of lakes as well. 
---
If Im the one to expand water creatures, this is how id do it. It’s already in the lore.
---
good news: they did remove "slap damage" in a recent patch
---
*You thought it was over...*
---
Most don't want utility items.
---
Many don't care. 
---
A few are completely fine with it. 
---
A few are **loudly and boisterously** against it and see it as the beginning of the end of the world as we know it.
---
By following the trading subReddits I can see lots of TSEs entering the market.  When I talk to the seller they are invariably someone who stopped playing in January and have started again.  I can also see the prices rise as more caps chase fewer items—if the game were dead you see less demand.
---
I saw something similar on the river near the Overseer's camp, but the door was lvl3 locked. :(
---
Oh okay cool thx for the link. Can I ask you one more question? I found an item called the Letterman’s Jacket and Jeans is this rare? Should I keep it or sell it for caps?
---
Be sure to take a look at reshade and some of the mods out there. Lots of great improvements, and I definitely recommend the Text Chat mod!
---
:( 
---
I don't think my brain wanted to believe it
---
Do you still play this one?
---
It was so hard to find in the previous games, MUST HOARD GLUE
---
What i heard from someone who I got the impression was a data miner, was that the legendary effect had a script effect of “+20% stealth”. That was in comparison to the Chameleon Mutation, which did “+100% stealth” Something like that implies the armor effect would stack.
---
Take that as you will.
---
Was feeling good until you made me imagine a cat implanted in a counter
---
Honey gives some too.
---
Wait, the fire rate on guns isn't some arbitrary bullshit number!?
---
I don't have to sit there and time my gatling laser with a stop watch and waste a core just to find out it's actual fire rate and true dps!?
---
You can get cores from killing the sentry bots at the white spring. They are generally 80% plus and if you're quick to loot them you can get one before and after they explode.
---
It's supposed to be a 40% chance but I get so few hits it feels like it's broken. It could definitely just be bad luck, but how many chems do I need anyway...
---
ok, what dont you like about it?  you think its ok for people to stalk you to your base and kill you instantly as their friend initiates the workshop takeover?
---
why do you not think it good to have the actual pvp be limitied to the workshop are to initalize pvp?
---
if there is a timer and you dont return to the workshop in time, you lose the workshop flatout, and pvp is over.
---
if you DO make it back to the workshop to contest the takeover, then PVP can happen anywhere on the map until one or the other is person is dead.
---
please explain what issues you take with this
---
I’ll be on the day the update comes out at around 8:00 pm CDT
---
Yeah, it was confirmed in an Inside the Vault post that backpacks would maintain their effects while in power armor.
---
Stabilized at max level ignores 40% armor and gives excellent accuracy to Heavy Guns.
---
yeah food items are the only things you can get 100% of the material back to rebuild instantly
---
With the Imposter Sheepsquatch body, what I've had to do is just wait until the body transforms to the default robot pile of junk. When that happens, I'm able to find it and loot. A super annoying waste of time, but it's worked for me.
---
Yeah it’s cool
---
Just tonight in adventure, had some lvl 263(ish) contest Berkley Springs, but then fail, they became wanted (5 Caps).
---
Interesting points, The only thing I had built at Berkley was a Stash box, so that was the destructible object. They sat a Berkley for some time, now doubt looking for me on the Map, (I was sitting in a chair, so off map, In my wifes CAMP, waiting for daylight as I had 90% Rads). 
---
After 10-15 minutes of them at Berkley, Me still owning the Workshop, with the Misc Quest "Berkley is under attack" I sent them a message, "Nice try at baiting me", within a minute they were walking out of Berkley, within 5 they were no longer on Server.
---
It still happens on Adventure mode.
---
You might wanna put up a sign so people don't miss it
---
Thank you for this. Bless you kind person!
---
I’m kinda annoyed that you can’t destroy the kits.
---
Oh cool, I’ve already done 8 levels since ysterday
---
Imho I think those are reasonable prices considering most low level players atm are actually alts of high level players but they will outgrow the majority of the gear in a dozen levels or so, so you cant ask the moon and the stars for em either.
---
Might I suggest you also sell shielded moded underarmor?  While I hate to have the competition I love that your are catering to low levels and offering them a decided QoL boost.  Good luck bro.
---
I was at the Sunrise Farm in the Cranberry bog region for the weekly challenge and the Mirelurk Queen in the distance suddenly dies almost out of sight. I really hate the auto-death bug on enemies that are at their maximum level at 50 but still die like their level 1 scorched.
---
Not even close to underpowered. I’d call them some of the most powerful, personally.
---
Hard to keep ammo in? Depends on the weapon. Gatling gun isn’t so bad, especially if you kill super mutants.  Minigun? Ammo whore, but at least it crafts in bulk. LMG? Fuck that noise. Highest DPS in the game... for the 15 seconds you can fire it before having to go back to farming ammo.
---
50cal is probably the overall best heavy weapon,  but 50cal ammo is super rare, you’re pretty much crafting or buying all of your ammo.
---
Nuka cola cherry and quantum with cola nut for immediate bursts.
---
It says I can craft my targeting HUD for my X01 but it won't let me. Even after I have everything. Thankfully it doesn't use the materials tho. Makes the sound n everything like it's on but it won't equip... Wtf am I doing wrong? Ppl r saying I might not b the right level but I'm level 109 n it won't let me do a thing... Ugh
---
I feel like I must have missed something, as I was doing the quest with a friend and not checking every nook and cranny like i normally would.  Would you expand on what I missed?
---
Same .. everyone's saying it's my level but I'm level 109 n still won't work.... I'm mad af
---
Lol nice
---
but basements are spoopy and fulla spooders 😬
---
Remove them from the Atomic Store. If there is another non-cosmetic addition the outrage will repeat against it.
---
Freddie Mercury Poisoning
---
.... oh fuck that. The fact that we could run mods like Calibrated Shocks *sort of* made up for a lack of Legendary power armor effects. Backpacks basically eliminate the value of C Shocks.
---
Yep, can't get out of that FO4 mentality. Every desk fan, duct tape and wonderglue gets picked up regardless of if I actually need the components.
---
As someone who runs silenced shotties in one of my builds you get used to it.
---
I can even take SBs no problem via 'enforcer'.
---
You will do bugger all damage until by means of crippling you coax the beast into landing, so three or four shells will be 'wasted' unless you position yourself in such fashion that is flying low directly above your position but still pretty much piece of cake.
---
Don't get me wrong, stealth is not for everyone, it is slow paced and not very thrilling unless it bugs out :P
---
Also blowing oneself up - much mitigated with Dense and Fireproof perk but I'm a stingy mofo so I run Biocommesh on my torso - becomes more of an issue.
---
Still worth a try, maybe you'll like it.
---
In the way South end of the Savage Divide. That big green tower (which is a workshop), just to the South-East is a small building painted on the map (looks like a store, oddly). That's the Ranger Tower that the note is found in.
---
Huntersville (Huntsville?) is due-North, and if you follow the road East out of town, down around the hairpin, you'll run into a small place place someone had set up. 
---
That story picks up there.
---
Open wheel
---
Go to the section it would be (it’s the shaking cash emote)
---
It will give you an RB selection to pull up your options in that section
---
its a trap!
---
I'd say yeah if it was like fallout 4s survival. The increased player and enemy damage was fantastic. 
---
As is I don't think it would work, personally I find that low level range savagely boring, the limited weapons, squidgy generic builds make doing anything a chore for me. 
---
Found 45 and up was when the game picked up for me as it opened up the world and its possobilitys to me as my increased power made everything more accessible.
---
good breakdown, thank you
---
This is a great game.
---
&gt;shielded moded underarmor
---
That's a great idea, thanks!
---
There’s no way you can wear a backpack inside a power armor. I knew it, and yet I’m disappointed to learn that.
---
I cannot agree with you more. Please upvote this so Bethesda listens just like they did with the Repair Kits in the Atom shop :D
---
Oh, like how I've killed every major Legendary in the game since the patch and only the SBQ droped them? Just a little salt with my upvote, sorry.
---
I see random enemies fall over dead all the time. This just started happening in the last few weeks.
---
What happens if your character hits max caps? With it stop all incoming sales?
---
I have had the same basic CAMP setup since around level 30 (I'm level 65 now) that was built solely for utility, it has all the crafting benches, some plants, a water purifier and that's about it. I keep meaning to upgrade it now I know so many more plans, but just never got around to it. That's gonna change tommorow, I'm going to build a nicer, better camp both for myself and for any potential customers who come to my Vending Machine
---
That'll disappoint the turbo-players who want to become wasteland tycoons, but I think it'll work out fine. TBH I think a lot of people are going to be more disappointed when they realize no one wants to buy their massive stacks of common plans and one star legendaries.
---
Honest question, but how do you play? I pick up nearly everything and loot every body I kill. I end up with a ton of crap and can easily empty out a vendor's caps at the end of play. Any left over items I sell the next session when the caps have regenerated. Do you just not pick stuff up or only pick up what you absolutely need and can use right away?
---
I full support it. My wife is missing out on a significant portion of the game, because of  assholes using the Workshop system not in the way it was intended.
---
Same stealth with crazy gas
---
Makes player vision fuzzy too iirc
---
But then all the enemies wielding Stalkers Lead Pipes will always have 95% VATS accuracy on me and there'd be no escape till they run outa AP instantly. :(
---
that's because the writers/Vbloggers are being pretentious like any other critic with an unusable college degree  and the bands are trying very hard not to be labeled mainstream metal (like bands used to avoid the label pop music)
---
And toy cars/trucks/aliens. And typewriters. =x
---
Diseased Scorchbeast doing fly-bys with it's Mutant Slayers Combat Knife is a funny thought.
---
That's my basic plan yeah! I just haven't touched Creation engine ever so had my fingers crossed somebody could drop some pointers
---
Ive done that with an unyielding stealth build w/ultralight armor (I’ve had SB’s literally land on me and stay in caution) but thats with a massive agility boost. Doing that without it... maybe full chameleon or full weightless+chameleon mutation.
---
I actually think that Heavy Weapons outperform both Rifles and Shotguns in terms of DPS and ammo efficiency. Sure you might not find many enemies that drop the actual 5mm/.50 rounds but that doesn't matter when you can just scrap the weapons they drop for steel, then you only have to worry about lead and gunpowder.
---
For example a .50 Cal vs a Handmade:
---
\- About 20% less damage per shot.
---
\+ Stabilized is better than Tank-Killer but requires you to be in Power Armor.
---
\+ Magazine size is far greater.
---
Similar range.
---
\- Less accuracy but mitigated by taking Stabilized.
---
\+Higher fire rate.
---
\+Better weapon durability.
---
Unless you use a VATS/Crit or a sneak build, don't like using Power Armor or you like using scopes/silenced weapons , the .50 Cal will outperform it every time.
---
About ammo efficiency(Ammosmith 2):
---
36x 5.556 rounds = 4 gunpowder, 6 lead, 12 steel ---&gt; 9 rounds per gunpowder, 6 per lead scrap, 3 per steel scrap
---
180x .50 rounds = 12 gunpowder, 10 lead, 40 steel ---&gt; 15 rounds per gunpowder, 18 per lead scrap, 4.5 per steel scrap
---
Super Duper procs favor the .50 rounds more since you craft a higher amount.
---
When I get that I just close the build menu and reopen then I can place the item where I wanted.
---
For instigating you need a weapon that has huge damage per shot in order to benefit from it, because the effect only applies to the first shot, you want your target dead after that.
---
Heavy metal chest piece has a small bedroll... not a full backpack.
---
That's why you build a one square foundation with stairs leading up to the "real" building. You can place that type of structure almost anywhere.
---
/pats your big metal shoulder 
---
i know the feel. surely we can get a fridge mod for power armor?
---
Brotherhood officer suit/road leathers will probably be where the money is at.  Both are black and "tough" looking.  One is str/end and the latter is per/agi/luck so you're covered for melee and ranged.
---
Happy vending =)
---
&gt; as my increased power made everything more accessible
---
See I see this as an issue, ive become powerful to the point that I dont have to worry about anything other than some players taking advantage of the workshop pvp anywhere anytime exploit.  
---
Scorchbeasts are nothing now, can be killed in a few seconds, scorch queen is just a bullet sponge but not actually threatening, silo's can be run solo in about 11 minutes.  
---
I had most my fun in the beta when me and my crew went to explore watoga, we were under level 10 i think, we were constantly dying, running out of ammo, breaking weapons ect and it kept us on our feet and enjoying the game.  
---
Since then my friend and brother no longer even play the game as they just feel like theyve done 'everything'  
---
I do like being powerful dont get me wrong, thats why I would see this as a good alternate game mode, like how survival is separate from adventure now
---
Well it’s like having a home instead of a CAMP, you should look for the forever spot and build your home there.
---
showing that i makes you infact more invisible or difficult to detect. In my own experiencie , its does not
---
I’m going to get set up for a test tomorrow, getting one of my characters to maximum bounty then tomorrow when i log him into the base we’ll see what happens.
---
In the ESM, the armor does cast the effect with 20 magnitude rather than 99 (stealth boy and chameleon), but the magnitude isn't always used so I can't confirm either way.
---
Ran I to this bug a ton last week. Very frustrating when you run over and you read the legendary item only for the body to disappear immediately. 
---
I’ve moved onto looting extremely quickly during combat which is a terrible way to play.
---
That seems like a decent limit - I wonder if items will stack tho - things like nuka colas or something?
---
That is all I want. My steaks spoil way too fast as is!
---
Maybe it had something to do with the fact that instead of saying 'oh goodie, I can do away with calibrated shocks and maybe run kinetic servos or something' people went 'oh goodie, Excavator + Shocks + Motion-assisted Servos + Backpack I can now carry *all the things!* on me' :P
---
In addition to the other comment - you made need to make sure they are active via the atom shop - sometimes mine turn off.
---
as what others have said, gotta move it. For a bit that was actually a glitch to display PA in your camp- if you tried to mod PA in it, it would place the PA in position, and pause while trying to put you in position, and when it failed... the PA would just chill there indefinitely. I only learned about it a few days before that got patched, sadly.
---
Most of the time I just have lead, screws, and acid flagged, and only pick up what is tagged. Weight is an issue in 2 of my 3 characters.
---
I also split my time between 3 characters, so that is a factor here too.
---
Pleasure :)
---
How about so pretending it's a legendary every time I pick one up
---
one time i broke a dubber ring and made away with like 800 screws hahaha. i killed them both almost one ontop the other grabbed all in both bags and bounced from the server. 
---
there was crafting items in the thousands in my inventory. i only took the screws tho.
---
It might have just been a consistency thing. Other armor pieces have no effect in power armor, so why should backpacks? And maybe there was a bizarre interaction with some of the backpack mods and some of the power armor mods.
---
Same thing that happens with any other incoming caps? It just says MAX instead of amount. My guess.
---
I had a ridiculous WS run yesterday too. Seemed like 1/4 glowing ones was legendary and even some of the regular glowing ones had legendaries too. Got 2 1* unyielding pieces (one combat armor and one leather) and plenty of trash weapons. Bring on the scrips!
---
I've found a few, they aren't crazy rare. If you don't want to wear it yourself I wouldn't bother with it.
---
It didn't suffer... I'm sure of it. =^_^=
---
There's one relatively lower level (30-ish) that has his under the bridge just NE of Safe 'n' Clean Disposal. Mine is just NE across the street from New Appalachian Central Train yard so I'm in that area a lot, although I've only seen him once.
---
He didn't look like a troll, and he didn't complain when I "borrowed" his purified water, but then I had 120 levels on him so what was he gonna do besides yell at me?  XD
---
(For the record, I dropped some plans for him so I kinda sorta paid for those waters...)
---
First thought... If you insist on only using heavy guns, then yeah, you're gonna need to devote part of your play time to feeding your guns. 
---
Second thought... you're right, this eventually leads to a lack of diversity in character builds.
---
K cool I would say I’m disappointed but I didn’t really expect much by finding something at level 8 :) thx again!
---
For sure. I solo it with my excavator and bloodied super sledge. I clocked my self once at 18 minutes. Never need to repair before queen unless I'm playing melee support that run.
---
the quote from u/valseek in the thread: "Currently, there are 30 slots you can assign items, or stacks of items, to in C.A.M.P. Vending Machines at any given time."
---
So yeah, stacks of items count as just one slot for the limit.
---
The luck of the server.
---
I think the issue for me is how enemies interact with me. I like being challenged, killed ect but the problem I found early game was that because 76 version of difficulty is to just add more health fights become boring as hell. I'll sit there plinking away with a hunting rifle for ages which is hugely unsatisfying. 
---
At least at a high level I have more weapon diversity, perk cards change how I use my character and mutations can change how I use my environment. At mid to low levels everyone is essentially the same.
---
For me difficulty should come from ai and opponent mechanics. For instance, assultrons stealth ability totally changes the way I engage them with my vats sniper, the robo brains smoke cloud also causes issues. More enimies need specific roles, like support/ dps and tanks. 
---
I've started my third character and am in the early game and I'm struggling loads to stay motivated.
---
As a level 230 player, I'm not sure if anyone is going to be selling anything of worth to me. Suppose the dupers (is it still a thing) may have something.
---
It’s very efficient and the tribarrel is more accurate than 50 cal, I shot them side by side for a while and shoot mostly mini now. Gatling is awesome but a little bit slow for boss fights after they nerfed Martial Artist’s benefit. Ammo isn’t an issue, lucky hole is my go to place for lead, and steel is everywhere.
---
To be fair it did sound peculiar, but again we have weapons that by means of blood magic do more damage the closer you are to death so who am I to judge?
---
I wouldn't discard the cross-interaction 'thing' though.
---
The Excavator carry weight bonus is already iffy as it is and glitches so often that some people doesn't realise that is a glitch so who knows what would happen if you throw a backpack into the mix.
---
w...wow. That's what I get for replying through the Unread page, where Markdown is manually done and there's no Rich Text editing...
---
IN A VAN! DOWN BY THE RIVER!
---
It's still the case, ballistic fiber is hard to keep in stock
---
I guess I'll be more direct. 
---
I'm saying that there isn't a functional monetary system in Fo76 and that what we really have is a barter economy where caps are just one of many goods that can be traded. The real value of all these goods are driven by their own supply / demand situations, and to a degree the means to store each of these goods (stash size / cap limit / etc.)
---
The game effectively limits the supply of all "scrap" goods by limiting spawn rates and preventing successful use of server hopping, however their usefulness is also fixed by the game design in that the cost of upgrade / repair versus dirability of guns / armour is also largely fixed. They cannot be used to create legendary stuff though which really does put a ceiling on their value.
---
Legendary stuff, the things we really value, is created separately in what appears to be a random way. Good stuff persists and is traded, rubbish stuff gets left in bags all over the place, and may get traded to in game vendors for caps, so inevitably you would expect the pool of good stuff to grow over time......just at the moment no where near in line with demand.....hence the inflation we see now. 
---
The situation is the other way around for caps with supply more and more outstripping demand, not just because their are loads of caps in the system, but more so because they just cannot be used anymore by those wanting to deal with high value lengendaries. Demand for caps is tanking and tweaking the supply side situation is just playing around on the other side of the decimal point.
---
Ammo and supplies that you can't be bothered to farm? Players are likely to heavily undercut vendor prices on bulk mats and chems.
---
Or who play and love the game and don’t like what this kind of item can mean for a game.
---
I don't think you're doing anything wrong, I think it's just a leftover bug from the previous, wide-ranging one. Hope Bethesda sees this.
---
That's still a shit situation. There's no counter play/ player agency. It's a coin toss.
---
What in the goddamn
---
With that limit per player i hope i'll find a new weapon :( (Visiting new camp will be nice though :3)
---
Elaborate?
---
One man's trash is another man's treasure.
---
I've had plenty of folks pay seemingly outrageous prices for really average legendaries.

---
The game RNG drops ammo that you need, i get 5mm and 50 cal ammo drops from ghouls and scorched all the time. Normally super mutants can drop 101 rounds of 5mm, but a couple times they dropped 501 rounds for me 🤩
---
I think so with the right perks, but those weapons don't drop anymore. If you don't have one now than you won't ever.
---
Anyone who would want 40k for anything is just flat out ruining the game. Person who pays it, is not helping.
---
I'm just across the street from you.  Hello neighbor!
---
The real benefit of player vending, playing wasteland Cribs ;)
---
That won’t be an issue much longer, thankfully.
---
System?
---
Sooo many potential ideas of camp by visiting others :D
---
Im sure I'll earn all downvotes possible soon. I knew what I was getting into, hence the title. But many players have begun to complain yet no one stood up to say it...
---
You're awesome thank you! I didn't check that emote, I figured the "ghoul" one would be the misc lol
---
It’s not a fix, just a nerf. Its current damage is where it should be after TSE nerf, but they want to nerf it more, smart enough they call it ‘bug fix’ so that people will be ok with it.
---
One of my best vendor finds was a bloodied swingspeed combat knife. Best 27 caps ive spent in game.
---
In FO4 I picked up my explosive shotgun off a legendary radroach. I'd love to see that in 76.
---
Did you claim a workshop?
---
Feral ghouls wearing pool noodles would be amusing, even if they die en masse just like other ghouls.
---
It could be a UI glitch due to latency?
---
The local client shows you 'alive' and with plenty of health but in fact that mob actually killed you is just that the client did not refresh fast enough.
---
I had that ammo thing happen to me as well. I have a tse prime 50 and a reggie tse...if you keep both ammo types on you it confuses the game lol. I now keep the one im not using at the time in the stash and no issues
---
Tbh it seems like since last patch enemies got a dmg buff or something.... using the same perks I used a week ago I noticed I’ve been taking a ton more damage. This is my tin foil hat theory I have nothing but a feeling that something got “unintentionally” changed
---
Looks like it's just north of the Pleasant Valley station.
---
Come one come all to the fabulous crafting, merchant emporium and bar!!!  
---
Welcome to The Drizzling Shits located just NW above the Top of the World ;)
---
I ran into this ass hat a few week ago
---
Griefers?? They are a great fountain of caps and resources!! Ohh, and hear them crying when you blow up their assassin/sent equipment with a gamma gun, that's music!! It's really nice for let new players build their CAMPS, but I'll miss that kiddos crying (they don't enter to Survival :(, so no chance to farm them there)
---
Crap, that would be vital information. XB1
---
Did you pick any locks on player-property?  Maybe you picked a lock on a resource generator on a workshop he owned, or picked a lock on a door in his camp without realizing it was a camp and not part of the game itself.
---
Best guess, but it'll almost certainly be related to workshop or camp ownership on his end.
---
The easiest is corn soup.
---
Then you have hard lemonade for a 10 ap regen for 10 minutes. Takes lemonade+vodka. Best for short moments.
---
Finally there is company tea. Takes a bit of uncommon resourses,but it's 10 ap regen for 1 hour.
---
If you don't worry about turrets and don't go bonkers with lights and conduits, it's not hard to make a really large camp.  Floors, walls, etc don't cost that much, but lighting, power and turrets are a huge budget sink.
---
Sure could be. Someone posted a zoomed in pick that showed a lever and reels. That would be kinda cool.
---
Send a ticket, Another player linked a page in this commentsection, hopefully we can get it back, orelse when the death rider skin comes, time to bring in some cash in this damn game 🤣
---
All the spawned stuff in the game is on a timer, and as such, will eventually "despawn" (just die) in order to allow new stuff to spawn in (at potentially higher or lower levels). 
---
I encounter this ALL the time in Watoga. Even bots that are "Fresh" out of the manufacturing tube, because they've actually spawned in long before and are waiting for the door to open. So when it does get triggered by me being nearby, they take a step out and collapse! lol
---
Most likely the item will sell the buyer losses the caps and you get none
---
I might have to go hunting for plans. I'll I can craft at this point is the vault suit and forest operative underarmor.
---
If it’s not to much trouble link me to it please. I haven’t seen it yet. Thanks!
---
Luring monsters to your camp as well. Even a lowly molerat can do some damage.
---
I wasn't saying that two shot wasn't good.
---
I was saying that trying to claim armor piercing isn't good because you might fight something without armor is flat out wrong. There are no enemies you will fight without armor. It does have a few nuanced situations where it isn't needed on a weapon in combination with certain perks/builds, namely you don't need ap on a super sledge when you have incisor and are dealing over 300 damage per swing, or can deal 1200 damage per hit, but those situations are not ordinary for most people.
---
Just search legendary vendor. Its been within the last few days.
---
Yea so far ive only sorbt realy money to push my atoms enough to get the war rider..plague and bone i grinded for..but i would vet..based on circumstances and my luck..that death will come out tomorrow.
---
Ty !
---
You’re right. One of the problems that I see with my second suggestion would be the fact that doing that would leave your camp open to monster attacks.
---
I just hope I can add stars to my existing items, or at least add stars to completely non-legendary items.
---
If you’ve got the supplies you can restore your camp to brand new.  Confused why a few people are so concerned about their camp being blown up.  It’s happened to me.  I simply just restored it all.
---
I've been collecting both 5mm and 5.56 on my shotgun character, and I have about twice as much 5mm. You find it less often, but in much larger quantities. 5mm is also far cheaper to craft.
---
Still wouldn't main a minigun unless you love farming ammo though. Just get Bear Arms and carry something more efficient for the easy stuff.
---
Same I feel like an idiot... was thinking the other day the perk was useless, because I never find anything extra.
---
Exactly. Curious to see how it works out. Only doors should be destructible in my opinion.
---
Haha yea... probebly... If we are lucky it will come next week, but we know f76 by now.. so prob tomorrow haha
---
ULPT: trigger the event right after Scorched Earth completes. People will FT there and forget to stash their newly acquired stable flux. I camped a guy's bag until the event was over. Gave a couple min for someone to come back for it and they never did. Free violet and crimson flux for me.
---
If you are dumb enough to venture around taunting people with that amount of stuff on you... 
---
You deserve it lose it all.
---
That would be cool. I’ve got some high hopes for it but everything seems to come with a catch lately. 2000 caps to kill a robot that still drops drills .
---
I think it's a scrap mod; also you can get a lot of weapon mods from treasure maps
---
True, but even you have at some point in the game ran out of supplies to repair things in the game. Some people don’t care about Griefing. Some do. Especially those with expensive camp decor (ex. Decon Showers)
---
Ran into an invincible legendary giant ant the other day, my son and I were both lighting it up, I burned several plasma cores through my executioner's Gatlin and it just rehealed until we just gave up and ran for it.
---
I've seen other legendaries heal but eventually I was able to kill them and I'd just assumed that they were able to heal themselves, I mean they do sometimes carry stimpacks.
---
A couple hours previously.
---
I seem to be missing something. 
---
*why* would I want to use this vendor vs a different one?
---
Same server?
---
@im\_mrmanager, @La3Rat - Was anything ever concluded on this?
---
No. I never received a notice that I had gained wanted. Just out of nowhere ganked...
---
Only when I have workshops setup and running
---
That’s what I thought.  Thx
---
That’s what I thought too.  Thx.
---
Da fuk did u say
---
Just move your camp.
---
Even a foot.
---
Completely fixes everything when you place the camp back down.
---
No resources used.
---
Small cap hit.
---
Ah hah. Yes.  Thank you.
---
can you destroy placed armor by shooting it? in fallout 4 id break it right off the frame/former user so it weighed nothing lol
---
Or they just don’t wanna waste money on a shit tier, unfinished game. 
---
2$ is 2$.
---
Right.  That is what I figured.  Thank you.
---
That’s what happened to me. I got on the mic and called the person out and then *poof* they left the server. It’s just a game so I learned a lesson.
---
But that contents already in the game though
---
Yeah Colonel's was pretty sad. He does have a second holotape in town that expands upon his story a little bit more and shows how he grew as a person.
---
If you still had that workshop claimed (doesn't matter how long since you last visited), then he initiated a claim and then found your location since you were now flagged for PvP vs him.
---
I've got a couple dozen great "starter weapons" saved up for tomorrow.  One star stuff that's really nice, like an anti-armor handmade, an instigating hunting rifle, two-shot western revolver/assault rifle/handmade and a handful of bloodied gauntlets and instigating fire axes.  Second and third effects are nice, but I saved up some meaty primary effects for newer players to be sold at affordable prices, to help them get their foot in the door for end game events and efficient legendary farming.  Also planning on offering plenty of serums, rare outfits, plans and a couple dozen single star unyielding combat armor pieces.
---
We’re u trying to die repeatedly
---
Hes a troll. We got a job ya know. 
---
If you dont pay the toll u can pass the troll loool
---
Do you use rejuvenated perk? The second you fall out of "well fed" your hp freaks out a bit. More so with rejuvenated. A couple of months ago it was really bad especially with bloodied. I just stopped topping off food because of it.
---
Yes, fire rate is how many rounds fired in ten seconds. So you can just divide by ten to figure out bullets per second. I think some guns, like the gatling gun, lists a broken number though.
---
I was amazed when I figured this out too. My own stopwatch timings helped back this up.
---
What about those players whose camps are stationary because they have built around existing objects?
---
I use the wind chimes. They are often used in unmarked locations to audioly tell passing players there is something interesting there, go check it out.
---
I think theyve toned down how many legendaries spawn in certain areas now but increased the likely hood of getting a legendary item from a legendary enemy
---
I'd rather spend hours adventuring with friends getting my money's worth out of the game and then eventually coming across high-end gear kinda like a rewarding feel after time invested.
---
Yeah, also a lot of enlightened fungus in the ditches, I think mostly in the north-east of the usual nuke zone. You can certainly get far more than 30 crimson per run.
---
At lvl180 I've never once had my base damaged intentionally by another player, however one time my base was within a nuclear blast zone and I didn't notice before it was too late. I returned to a cindered building frame.
---
The worst damage to my base has come from scorched beasts.
---
Traveling to thier camp is free :/
---
No it's a talent which is effortless for me.
---
Hmmm
---
How’s this different then one in white spring ?
---
because it sells unique outfits, like Hunters Longcoat or clean spacesuit outift and helmet, and others
---
I think is a bugged COBJ record.
---
The plans to craft X-01 mods exist as BOOK records in the esm but they cannot be obtained in any way, not even from the dev cells. The only way would be console commands and the console is disabled.
---
You should only be able to apply mods, not craft them.
---
I were getting shredded by a lvl 30
---
Yeah i know what you mean there, i had the modern weapons mod on fo4 and it basically upped the damage you dealt and dealt to you by loads, so you could basically 1 shot most enemies but they could basically 1 shot you too, got very tense after that and it would also be good for a more hardcore mode of this
---
My problem with tri-barrel is low deeps. .50 cal dishes out like twice more damage at roughly the same rate of fire. Also resources for ammo weren't the problem. Problem was constant need of collecting them. 210 RoF, low dmg per bullet and inability to tap-fire made it impossible to save ammo.
---
I'm under the bridge between NAR and the Whitespring on one character.
---
Thanks for 'ur' support.
---
So he can attack my workshop, find me on the map (at my base), kill me, loot my junk, and destroy my base (which I dont have the resources to rebuild). And there is NOTHING I can do to prevent that!?
---
Interesting. That's unfortunate because I have and use a TSE .50 cal as well (purely to blow up the mainframe cores during silo runs) that uses regular .50 cal ammo.
---
No worries mate :)
---
With the scrapper perk, laser rifles are like 10 plastic per. Anywhere with a lot of super muties will give a nice haul.
---
I'm just wondering what happens when/if you hit your 25k limit and more caps come pouring in?  I'm hoping for a new cap sink item (or ten) so I can get poor and not have caps "boil over", so to speak.
---
I don't plan on selling anything for over 1000c, no matter how rare, but I'm sitting at 15k right now with almost nothing to spend them on aside from picking up plans to make wood axes, revolvers and T-45 explosive vents or similarly useless squandering.
---
I still like the fact that camps are destructible, but only if you’re wanted or engaged in activate pvp.
---
I think this might be 'by design' to entice players to visit the shop often.
---
I am by no means expert but it does sound like a tactic to get people browsing.
---
Most games do this, the thing is in most games both sides know how much health and defense the other has, so the difference between the predictions is negligible.
---
This game has so many defense buffs in place that it doesn't tell the other side about that the prediction is essentially meaningless.
---
Well that’s why then. If you take a workshop anyone can go there, contest it, and attack you anywhere on the map. It’s stupid, but it’s currently the rules. Sorry.
---
They have started a posting on their blog recently that showcases all new items in the Atom store and in this post there is a section for sale items that will be available for that week. I have only found this recently myself as I used to think the same way - it was hard to keep up with things and then I would miss my chance.
---
Here is the post from last week - [ATOMIC SHOP: PATCH 8.5 ITEMS AND SALES (UPDATED APRIL 30)](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6zK9b9qMb0kWcnBxUNJOlB/atomic-shop-patch-8-items-and-sales)
---
And I am sure they will post one tomorrow for next week. I hope this helps!
---
Yeah that's the thing about "micro-transactions" they're never micro, at least not on my budget.
---
Sadly PC :(
---
Make the Matriarch as frightening as a Queen. That’s one fight I’d _love_ to jump into.
---
I had someone try this the other day. He just showed up and started blasting me with an explosive Handmade, but I was running an  explosive build too so it wasn’t doing really any damage and I logged off. If I had not changed my perks/armor a couple of hours prior I would have been dead before I could log out so I got lucky. Some people are assholes. That said, if you claim a workshop as I had, you are taking the risk of it happening.
---
Why hello!!
---
u/JBarracudaL
---
Well, I wouldn't expect to be attacked for asking the question, and I wouldn't expect to hear people complain about being asked the question.
---
Either scenario would be enough for me to never come back to the restaurant ever again...
---
Yup. Don't claim a public resource.
---
Damn it, OP baited me in with the promise of something Death Metal looking. Instead I got Freddie Mercury.
---
I’d like to make houses closer but have the same thing, too hard on the servers.
---
How do stims drop, I thought it was only Junk items?
---
Yea. It will still take me a while to sell through my 400lbs of plans. I hoped they wouldn't have an item limit lol
---
Is that the brick building set? Looks awesome!!!
---
Thank you!! It helps a lot!
---
Where does the vendor spawn ?
---
I will be there!
---
Pick axe pilsner went up at -50% off, 250atoms :)
---
Multiple people can use the same terminal, it just shows up on your pip-boy. It is a lot nicer interface if you ask me. Not a lot of people know this.
---
Wait they changed it now? Cmon Bethesda...
---
I can use it for carnivore serum
---
I found the responder bot twice in 2 different locations yesterday. Both times i only got a prompt to interact with it, no prompt to trade. Are there different versions of the bot or something?
---
You could change the map to an ordinance style map to see. (I’m away from home or I’d look)
---
You mean while selecting a nuke zone?
---
It is totally unrelated to your OP so my apologies but the whole drill thing in the legendary levelled list is really grating on me now.
---
The first time it happened, many many moons ago, I thought it mildly humorous.
---
After a DIY store's worth of them I don't find it as funny anymore.
---
&gt;Store your turrets
---
I don’t even have turrets, they get in the way of all my pretty things xD
---
Guess I’m safe
---
What?
---
Want to know things to do as I’ve completed the game and my luck is terrible so I don’t get nothing from Legendary enemies
---
lol, you’re good money then, mate!
---
Congrats! Glad you were able to get one for yourself.  
---
I got one on my very first attempt from the Responder vendor bot a while ago and wore it all the time.  Then during a laggy/frame dropping moment while fighting the SBQ, I was trying to switch weapons in my pipboy and ended up accidentally dropping the coat and couldn't find the bag anywhere.  When I tried to spawn the vendor bot again and buy a new one, I realized how rare it truly was.   I ended up just buying an overpriced one from another player after I got sick of farming for it.
---
Oh no don’t get me wrong! I completely agree with having to have turrets to stop griefers or enemies wrecking your precious camp. As I myself have fallen victim to my camp being obliterated by assholes before. Yes i am glad they are doing that despite my post on here saying I am a turret slayer. I’m not saying I’m against turrets just the people who abuse them in the wrong places 😊
---
It's really the people paying. Like I said there are too many caps in game now. This is what things like the 10% tax on vending will help with (other than a steam of messages from players asking to trade directly for 10% less). I made a post the other day saying not accepting caps and some dude offered me 25k a piece for some assassin's sentinel pieces. I doubled back and reposted that item and the bids were up over 50k and some ridiculous weapon offers. I guess it's a combo of the cap devaluing from the vendors, mixed with the rarity of rare items again.
---
Go do belly of the beast and you get a full set of the pa and three is terminal in the bos fort defiance to learn the full set
---
Shielded Vault suit actually offers a very nice balance of special bonuses for the starting char and I personally believe it is better overall if you aren't trying to min/max dps stats or you want your char look a certain way.  I believe I'm in the minority with this opinion however.
---
Just to confirm, I’m running it on mine and didn’t have any issues.
---
I had no expectations of getting those offers to clarify. I've been off the game for a few weeks cus of lack of new content/boredom with the stuff they released. Couldn't believe the prices on market and around the marketplace.
---
I know there is... I've completed all the main quests so I have it all
---
Risk is what makes a game fun.
---
You ain’t lying.
---
You could be a raider and add a fun player NpC element to the game! Oh wait...
---
Survival mode
---
Oh wait ......??
---
At least give us a legendary drill .
---
Thank you!!
---
That’s awesome. I’m personally really happy to see that new people are starting to play the game and enjoy it! Keep up the exploring!
---
It's a known bug that has been around since launch. But Bethesda being Bethesda don't know when/if it is gonna be fixed. Only way to get targetting hud to X-01 is to find the mod directly from vendor or other player. No way to craft/attach it yourself if you have the plan.
---
It is what it is
---
We don’t have other cool ones as of now, but this is our picture from Bethesda Game Days.

---
Nice bar! By any chance do you remember where you got the plans for those stools?
---
Did you get to that small cabin at the end and finish the quest yet?
---
Not specifically, but something to look at. Thanks
---
Then why not sticky it to the sidebar?
---
I will visit in my heart!
---
If anything, I'm charging him to be my neighbor. ;)
---
Yeah, totally finished all the unsolved case quests.  The cabin was totally empty because everyone else on the server looted it clean before I logged in.  I didn't have a chance to look around too much.
---
I'm opening a [bar](https://imgur.com/a/oZsXD6Y)!  30 slots gives me just enough room to sell every single kind of booze in the game, even if they ever get Firecracker Whiskey and its cocktails working.  I'll sell off duplicate recipes in the meantime, as I'm doing Biv's daily every single day and have many, many duplicate recipes.
---
Don't think I'm going to move, I'm just outside Morgantown close to Biv and positioned to sell alcohol and plans to help with his daily quests.  My camp is (obnoxiously) taking up most of the road so I might try to relocate somewhere nearby just to get it off the asphalt and make it feel more like it fits in, but I like the area for natural resources, water access, and proximity to Biv.
---
I have heard this from several others. I have a large supply of stimpacks (mostly diluted) that I use during fights only, and I've been using them a lot more in the last 2 weeks.
---
Not sure. I just know it's happened not just to me, but to a teammate so I was just wondering if anyone else saw this kind of thing. I'll try &amp; take a screenshot next time.
---
It is.  Looking forward to visiting your place on PC.  My IGN is shankwell.  Hopefully our camps aren't too close to be placed together.
---
Im afraid its shared stash. From inside the vault:
---
Once you build a Vending Machine, you can assign items to it directly from your Stash and choose the Cap prices you’d like buyers to pay for them. Items you place in your Vending Machine will remain in your Stash, but they will also display a new vending icon next to their names so that it’s easy to identify what you’ve marked for sale at a glance. 
---
I can see the appeal of going around drilling Super Mutant knees with a Furious Drill :P
---
I thought camps were supposed to be invulnerable with this update or did that get postponed?
---
Dang. Xbox here. Well that's that lol hope ya find others to explore with you :) it's just dangerous out there
---
They are...unless you or your turrets attack someone.
---
There is one at the Crosshair raider camp right to the top of the map above and to left of Hemlock Holes.
---
I was scrolling through and didn’t see this listed, but the invisible rake is back and keeps hitting me, and when I’m trying to get flora, it’ll appear as I collected the flora, only to reappear as I never grabbed but I can’t grab as it’s the same plant.
---
That last one isn’t super important, just aggravating
---
that's why there is a 15 second count down timer till death so you can use a disease cure. more then enough time to see the message "You have consumed poisoned wine" open your pip boy, use a cure
---
Can you add me? My psn is Orcaman20206
---
Oh ok. I see what you mean now. Thanks for the tips!
---
There is a message when you go to claim a workshop that you will be flagged for pvp, though it does nothing to explain the ramifications of that.
---
What you can do, if you want to keep doing workshops, is log out as soon as anyone starts to annoy you, and go to a different server.  You'll lose any progress on your workshop and have to claim it again (if you want to), but that will unflag you and the person won't be able to bother you any more.
---
I think it’s going to be like the “exotic vendor” is Destiny. (Xur?)
---
I wonder if they’ll aggro you instead of the camp?
---

---
I've ran pharma since the beginning. It's a good supplemental income stream. You got the first aid boxes, chem boxes, medicine cabinets (mirrors). I can do a run at whitespring and hit a dozen of these while doing the normal ghoul run. Annoyingly, there are 3 medicine cabinets in the club restroom by where the wendigo spawns that don't let you interact with them.
---
Probably better ways to spend perk points, but at this point I'd feel kinda sad about not being able to search those containers. I also run level 3 lockpick all the time, even though i hardly ever find anything good in safes.
---
why would i willingly drink poison?
---
The “third” would tertiary my guy
---
I love lore and building to, so if you have a mic, we can totally hang out together. I'm currently considering to start a new character myself, and new buddies to play with are always welcome. \^\^
---
Turn it off and play something else until more content arrives.
---
It sells unique outfits and clean versions of other outfits.
---
My bad I’m from the south we have shitty schools.
---
Games going to be collecting dust then
---
That's the old mine forman's tape to his wife? Yeah, that one hit a nerve as well. Good call!
---
Oh look the carebears have destroyed the game more than Bethesda could have done by themselves.
---
Will do, I'll be back inside in a sec, wasn't expecting a response so fast lol
---
Not on yet but I’m Wall3yMasta if you want, only 32 though
---
Ah, thank you.
---
Haven't seen that one yet? Location?
---
Okay haha. This is probably the best discussion I’ve ever had on Reddit lol. Most of the time I’d be getting chewed out. Thanks for keeping a calm head.
---
Anyone with turrets on their camp should ask themselves what good do they do?
---
Saw that one! Good call!
---
For sure, add me on PSN and send me an invite anytime, I have a mic
---
There are two, one is just a responder protectron, the other is an actual vendor that spawns there, sometimes having rare outfits.
---
Awesome, will add and see!
---
I have had my head bitten off a few times on here myself. So I get it. No worries. Happy hunting on fallout 😊
---
I love how the imgur comments are always from salty losers who have never played the game and just regurgitate the toxic rhetoric from months ago.
---
Barn set, actually! &lt;3
---
I think the new atmos pharma dungeon is coming I soon .
---
Totally fine, like I said, I have some friends who are just starting. I'm just interested in meeting anyone who loves fallout as much as I do 😊
---
I did have pacifist enabled.  I was in a three person team, so I can't speak to what my friends were doing or had enabled.  I don't know the tricks to over-riding the pvp rules on adventure, but I was "enemies" with the griefers really quickly, and they relentlessly smashed me and everyone else as I tried to participate in the event until I just quit the game to spare my remaining caps.
---
Update: I'm convinced instigating isn't being applied. 
---
Took all my perks off, base 121 damage, no armor Pierce, shots on lvl 68 supers did about 10% damage, added perks one by one, damage slowly went up on first shots. 
---
Then I went up and gun bashed to remove any chance of instigating, did same amount of damage. 
---
If you're on XB1 I'll let you play around with it
---
Hell no man it’s 2019 we just need built in settings sliders 🤦‍♂️ this stuff is so standard now bgs
---
Wow. That super sucks!
---
I know the note he's talking about, but haven't seem the attraction you mentioned. Thanks for the tip! Always wondered if the dog's owner got revenge or not.
---
Start a new character using weapons you never have before. Or try a "survivor" character, level up endurance and use just one or two weapons, no legendaries. It's tough and you won't be a powerhouse, but it's rewarding bringing down a lvl 60 super mutant with just a non scoped bolt action rifle in leather armor. It makes the game fun and challenging again, and if you're not using legendaries you won't be farming the same few spots as usual.
---
Mats &amp; ammo is great to buy from players if you want to save a little or spend a bit less time farming :)
---
Mind you I have 9/9 rifleman, bloody mess and 3/3 tank killer and I'm not one shotting direct chest hits
---
what, you do not wanna drink the forbidden grape juice?
---
But this is a limitlessly spawning currency that’s inflated to absurd levels. This is not the same as a real world currency
---
Might have to try this I’ve also wanted to try the survival mode but just don’t have any good weapons
---
That’s good. I would hate to only be able to sell 30 of one item and that’s it. Thanks for the info!
---
In PVP I can see them being useful because they actually release a cloud of smoke, so even your blur should be hidden.
---
Berry mentats are basically wallhacks though, and probably work through the smoke.
---
When I am wrong I am wrong and I freely admit it looks like I was wrong. I went on information from a [beth.net](https://beth.net) community manager and they were wrong along with my experience of not finding a single broken deluxe camera. Apologies to you NickyBeth - please see link attached: 
---
 [https://bethesda.net/community/topic/339009/has-anyone-found-another-broken-camera-on-ansel/29?language%5B%5D=en&amp;page=2](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/339009/has-anyone-found-another-broken-camera-on-ansel/29?language%5B%5D=en&amp;page=2)
---
Fuckin A. Good on you brother. Good on you. I do the same thing. Makes the game much better to play.
---
When about?
---
Will do in a bit. (I'm Proxytato :))
---
Can't promise I'll get much playing done tonight, but I should definitely be around again tomorrow.)
---
A glitch where you can’t fast travel to shop camps that are on the map , I don’t know if it’s even going to be a feature but I reckon if it’s an Intended feature it won’t work.
---
Mind you I have 9/9 rifleman, max bloody mess and tank killer, and 5/5 explosive and I'm not one hitting
---
Didnt you hear they pushed it back again?
---
The times I've engaged in PVP I can count on one hand.  I have a textbook idea of how to beat them, but almost no practical experience.  The stealth boy/vats crit rifle headshot has always worked for me when my camp is being ruined.  I don't know how to coordinate squad tactics, nor was I willing to stick around and lose all 15k caps I had on me until we figured it out.
---
THAT one just about made me cry, especially when you read his other notes, as he gets older. But you're right, the first one is hard to listen to.
---
I’d haft to look at the road map but I believe in the next month. Could be wrong but I know the legendary vendor is coming this month.
---
no they all have the same chance but of course if you save all 3 cows the rewards are better and IMO the easiest place to do that at is the one in the mire at Delano Grange , that one is just easier to control IMO
---
I’m *really* disappointed. I feel like heavy weapons mains (who basically require power armor) are basically being crapped on even more :(
---
They kill ghouls in the Golf Club.
---
They might do something like that if they ever get around to making player dedicated servers on PC. Of course that does leave out console players, unfortunately.
---
Or maybe those punji  boards as well?
---
When your rad shower is destroyed, it requires a variety of stabilized flux to repair.  Not the end of the world, but I'd rather not wander around a nuke zone picking flowers for 30-45 minutes if I don't have to.
---
Ha! I took the blocks too. And...also felt like a schmuck afterwards.
---
What is up with that dog btw?? Not hostile, can't befriend him, he's just ...there, taunting me because I don't have a Dogmeat by my side :-/
---
Its should be done like an HGTV show. I would even watch F76 cribs.
---
Nothing is worth more than 25k, imo
---
I saw an interesting post the other day about a guy working over the points of caps being created out of the blue and how devaluation vs people hoarding on them making it meaningful and skyrocketing prices. 
---
Maybe a re-structuring in currency (nearly impossible).
---
More in-game uses for caps. Imposter Sheepsquash requires 2K to redo but the hype for that I think has died. Outside of trade, the only use it has is for fast travel and there is a perk to make it cheaper.....
---
Survival mode is fun, but too scientific for me. Too many people min/maxing and using legendary heavy  builds for my taste. I think the game is less fun if you're worried about the math aspect of getting 150% out of your character. The only legendary I have is a 1* Hunter's rifle, since I hunt for food and only eat that and sell the collected food for caps
---
Is this a cult? I uh, think that's my ride. Im gonna go.
---
Good picks! Also, the responder that's stuck in the fridge. What a fucking good awful way to die.
---
I hope! I have like 10 dog helmets 😂
---
I'm looking forward to being able.to sell the shitloads of disease cure I always seem to have. And getting build inspiration front others...
---
if it is a 1 star, then about 500 to 1K sounds accurate IMO
---
Heh heh yeah, why not?
---
The cap is the only thing keeping player sold stuff in check.  Full suits of Sentinel armour would double overnight if the cap was lifted.
---
The legendary system in this game is server based. Some servers have loads of three star legendaries some do not. I like to start at watoga and check inside the buildings. If I find a couple of three stars it’s usually a good server to grind for legendaries.
---
Been in the game since forever. Not saying it doesn't mean anything, just that they're not new.
---
Damn. First time my boyfriend and I have seen it since the beta. Killed a million dogs. But good to know! Hopefully soon.
---
Most games have a slightly larger deadzone to compensate for old controllers or imperfect center positions. 
---
This is basically the only solution because windows doesn't have any apps to change settings like that for controllers either. Steam just happens to have the overrides for the steam controller that works with other types.
---
100 caps on another player's vending machine's contents not showing up for you. xD
---
200 caps on buying stuff causing some wacky duping glitch getting you banned without knowing why. xD
---
Re-structuring the currency (at this point practically impossible) would be the only solution.
---
I mean yeah, I'm rebuilding Appalachia here not doing lame PvP.
---
Okay thanks
---
True.
---
Yeah I’m just saying this should just be a setting in game and not just for pc
---
That is really cool! Also, you can server hop different areas for the bot. I actually did it myself at Lady Janet's soft serve, just north of vault 76. I farmed the vendor bot twice at that location, got my long coat and some other neat outfits.
---
Lmbo
---
Agreed
---
Todd is going to give you the ultimate prize a fasnacht mr sun mask
---
Frankly it’s the axial deadzones that seem waaay too high for my liking
---
Never tried it!
---
Thanks for the info I also heard what is dropped from a Legendary is based on what’s in your inventory?
---
The only thing I hope they give us with player vending is more camp budget. I've got mine just the way I want it, and it's going to suck if I have to start removing things to squeeze the vending machine in.
---
I bought it but that's because I'm building the church of atom for my camp at some point.
---
Claim the workshops while you have a buddy running through the silo, the pvp distraction will allow the nuke to land 😆
---
Yes it does seem that if you get a drop you like equip it and the drops tend to lean towards it for whatever crazy reason I don’t understand.
---
Need deeper and more numerous cap sinks. That’s why things like cap cost for fast traveling exists. The endless generation of currency needs balanced by having that currency removed frequently as well
---
Serj Tankiens' new project! Nice!
---
True and I just collect glowing meat and cook that to get a 10% melee damage boost seems my only good weapon is a Bloodied meant hook
---
Yeah if you controller is new it's no issue. However after it gets a bit worn, you need to increase deadzones or buy a new controller.
---
Damn you beat me to it
---
Thanks for the help
---
Yeah, I'd be OK with them not holding much if they just produced at a decent rate.  The numbers that show up when you hover over a workshop on the map supposedly are the rates at which the shop produces resources.  I can tell you from experience that my CAMP produces junk from its extractor faster than the ones at the landfill.  The same goes for my water purifiers, although having more than one doesn't make them produce any faster--they just hold more so I don't have to harvest constantly.
---
Very cool! You all have been quiet lately, glad to see you're back
---
Sneak damage and getting my damage to 361 with adrenaline results in one shot, but I don't know how much life a level 68 has or how to calculate DR
---
Has anyone actually confirmed that camps can block spawn points? I thought it’s been reported that”s not the case and any random spawns will still happen just not exactly in that spot.
---
Second this
---
If you're going to take workshops, be prepared to defend them anytime, anywhere on the map until you log out.
---
I advise people to crouch to prevent remote sniping or if they are at their workshops to avoid being a visible and easily hunted target for potential raiders.
---
The first thing I do when deciding to assault a workshop is locate the player on the map, check their level, and note their potential campsite if they are in a random location where I know there is nothing of interest.
---
Crouch. Get off the map. And if you have a workshop, expect that someone is just waiting for an opportunity to take your caps and junk when you are least prepared.
---
Just keep it stored. Even after the patch you should since mobs can destroy it too.
---
Maybe take the occasional break from the game and do something else?
---
Seriously I see these "I'm level 200 and max cap and have done everything" posts while I'm still piddling through the content at my snails pace thinking Jesus log off once in a while.
---
Roll an alt, maybe go around hooking newbies up with gear and goodies.
---
It's a sandbox game, make some content for yourself and others.
---
Of course the problem with a sandbox game is that you have to use your imagination to think up new ways to play.
---
I don't play as much as I'd like (family, job and the like get in the way) but I can play for hours just wondering around exploring.
---
Stop treating it like a race and treat it like the leisure activity that games are supposed to be.
---
You don't have to do PVP. Just go out and do PVE until you have good gear. You will meet some friendly people.
---
Shouldn't be in power armor anyway.
---
Verbally
---
100 caps that the camps with vending wont show on map
---
and they're now fucking useless.
---
Thing is that Extractors have a stash limit. So even if it says it produces 9 an hour, the max weight could be reached with 3. so you'd have to go back every 33 minutes to get all 9 in 1 hour.
---
i've always had my doors open and everything unlocked for people to come and check out my camp but nobody ever has, even when they're close by and i'm there stashing stuff. can't wait to have more visitors
---
One handed melee could really use some work.
---
1k caps says they'll fuck up Bobby pins again
---
I recently had an AA pole hook with swing speed drop. And a friend just gave me the puncturing mod. I love it.
---
To OP, I'm not opposed to switching my weapon as better ones drop for me.
---
Yeah.  I got a little sweaty in the eyes, thinking about my own wife.
---
The legendary scrapping machine will "eat" your legendarys
---
What gear should I look for? I am mostly a power armor player but are there some non power armor gear I should be on the lookout for? Especially with backpacks and the new legendary trader on the horizon, I may be looking to ditch power armor
---
300 caps someone figures out how to remove items from a player's vending without paying
---
Im in the same spot. The billboard points left and i used 2 garage doors to make a drive-through. You can put 3 vault boy pointers on top of the billboard as well!
---
Fair price which is actually pretty rare lately.
---
and they're fucking useless
---
My 10mm for lower level areas is just called “Pew Pew” 😂 clearly we’re a creative bunch
---
I don't really use it. But every time there is a patch I see if it still works and report it again.
---
Read the whole post, multiple people reported getting him to spawn while a camp was over his spawn point.
---
I get what you are saying, but this happens to any enemy, not just legendary enemies. The legendary enemies will heal/mutate when below 50% health, and if you shoot at them during this healing, they will be "invincible". You have to wait for them to fully heal before being able to damage them.
---
In my instances, the enemies, legendary or not, will just start healing any damage, except for melee.
---
You are wrong again there partner. 
---
In fact, one could call you a Griefer 😂

I mean, for reals!  It's a non-legendary legendary!  It even pops up a dramatic screen graphic every time you pick it up! haha
---
WV is the northernmost southern state, the southernmost northern state, the westernmost eastern state, and the easternmost western state.
---
Yikes. Wendigo cave.  Thanks
---
It says it will be destroyed so that’s what happened. Are you looking for scrap steel and molded plastic from it?
---
I noticed even the very small dr of my underarmor  took away a lot.
---
the last one is the most arguable, but it has West in the name, so I count it.
---
Lots of Handmades there...
---
Oh I think you're onto something
---
I’m sure Bethesda would of put that in the patch notes though if that were the case :kappa: :)
---
Yes, they are having fun doing that. Some people exclusively sell items as merchants in a RP fashion.
---
I have almost a full set of t51 but thought it had to be a lower level to build Excavator
---
People are going to flip out when the steam version is released and it's not made of actual steam.
---
Confirmed. I accidentally bought an Excavator skin, and had it refunded within an hour.
---
Dee Reynolds
---
Cool thanks
---
Sure they can, they do with excavator armor.
---
I was hoping this was a rare item I could trade
---
try running into a super mutant warlord with a bleeding minigun.
---
The constant crashes on PS4 in nuked areas are still fun, you also drop all your junks when you get blue screen.
---
You can sell up to 30 items at a time. If each is 1 k then you have more than 25k for sale. 
---
The limit should definitely be raised imo.
---
I've been set on having a store downstairs with a bar/hostel upstairs since the moment I started. In beta I had a simple setup, and on day 1 I was able to place is right next to Vault 76 stairs as a way to welcome new users with a safe sleeping/crafting area.
---
With the new bar Atom Store items and the vending machine, my next version is going to be epic.

---
How does cap limit affect the amount of good legendaries in existence if they are based on RNG?
---
Right! Yea me as well..just sucks. Im on the hubt for explosive 50s rn ..my prime tse ia pretty good with the queen..i wanna have two on me for when the first one breaks.
---
Huh? 30 or so raw or stable?
---
Thank you! I was starting to think it was a bug.
---
Get off me grass!!
---
Just a heads up - I have used both TSE and B25 and regular bloodied. 1 star bloodied with a proper bloodied build absolutely blows the TSE away. Easily double the dps. B25 is even more.d Another bonus? They break 50% slower due to not being 2 shot.
---
I actually have an alt with nothing but Mini Nukes most of them are on the character itself as perks don't work inside stash box :(.
---
Yea, thankfully there's a better spawn north of 76, Jane's creamery or something like that, it's and ice cream shop.
---
That is literally one of the ways you refine metals.
---
You dissolve the rock and other components, separating them into layers that you can they take out, and refine into purified materials.
---
The other way is by melting everything with heat, allowing you to separate it into layers that you can...
---
Obviously we aren't using blacksmith forges here.
---
There is the third way where you use electricity to separate things into layers...
---
Which could work given fusion tech, but often this goes with the first so.
---
How many you looking for? I'd do 3 caps per up to 100.
---
I tried OVN last night along with Uraniam Fever, thank you for the info!
---
Luck doesn’t affect legendaries I don’t think but the durability of the weapons you find
---
Math, you mean 20 mintues. 33% of a 60 minute hour.
---
I have not figured out the bloodied build yet. I cant do it. Idk how. I die to quick and spend more time finding my bag than its worth.
---
Thanks for the replies, everyone.  I'll just keep server hopping, just acquired the jet pack  :D
---
I got two outfits today, army fatigues and Medic Scribe. It was the first time in months I've gotten anything besides ammo and meds.
---
It's definitely best to have people lined up. I used mine and only 2 people showed up.  Lol
---
Whats ur method for farming fusion cores?
---
There's a very sad letter at the top of East Mountain Lookout.  Seeing the decor of the tower on the way up made it even sadder.
---
Also, the note To Janet in Morgantown pinned on the board in a bar near the tattoo shop.
---
Omg that's an amazing idea with the garage door drivethru!!
---
I believe what they are trying to say is that the cost of those kinds of armor would double.
---
Bethesda actively hunting what? I thought all they did was running a script so accounts with millions of same items were singled out and banned. Other than that I don’t think there’s much to do anyways. They’re not gonna do sting operation and capture dupers, too much work.
---
You cannot change anything in a player’s CAMP that they have placed, even in a team.
---
i thought it was a laser rifle plan until i read this post. ha too funny.
---
That’s true I forgot about that lol
---
I was happily sniping at the SBQ atop the trailer, died instantly and respawned two more times before I figured out what was happening and saw I was losing a lot of caps.  I never tried engaging these guys, but like I said, my bloodied deathclaw friend has a bit of a mean streak in her DNA.  Who knows.  From observing the evidence, this was a carefully crafted plan to ruin everyone's Sunday afternoon SBQ, and I'm impressed at the lengths some people will go to for the sake of fuckery.  I was taken completely unaware and the slow dawning of the situation at hand was simultaneously gross and amazing, which is the point of my post.
---
Why build a generator at Poseiden, just repair the reactor and have all the power you need. Can run all of the resource harvesters just have to run power connectors and lines.
---
Something that I only figured out yesterday is that you can lock them, it won't stop the determined thief but at least they get a nice wanted tag.
---
Glad you enjoyed. OVN is one more people should join. I wish every server had it run about once an hour :)
---
Someone will have forgotten to move the decimal point over or something and scrips will weigh 10 lbs each
---
No worries, man.  At least you'd try.  If you're on the webpage, you highlight the text and click the ( ! ) button in the editor below the text.  It makes the text &gt;!do this.!&lt;

Raw

For 2 hours when new content comes out
---
I stumbled across a guy whom I’m 99% sure said he got the sentinel paint from forbidden knowledge. He showed me his at least, when I was talking about grinding it more often. 
---
Hope it helps a little
---
You can have more than one person can actually purchase at the vendor. The limit definitely has to be raised.
---
mines on a death blossom event area, so they keep my camp safe from the mobs that decide to detour
---
Ha ha. yeah.
---
That was the second place i hit up. Got the bot that doesn't trade twice in a row.
---
They already cost more than 25k so what's the difference? I full assassins Sentinal will run you 30k+ easy. If it's already over the limit then a limit change won't matter.
---
The woman locked inside the supply closet was the one of the most depressing stories of the game.
---
I started the same day!
---
But then it's floating and looks unrealistic? I'm going for realism, which is why I did a 1950s era looking house as it fits the game.
---
My theory on sneak is as follows: 
---
There is an enemy perception check thats rolled against your sneak. Each thing you do modifies your sneak parameter - shooting silenced weapon takes less of your sneak than shooting unsilenced one. The perception check works both in PvE and in PvP. In PvP it defines vatsability range, and various tactical insights - i.e. your character may be aware of your invisible enemy and you see the red trianglish icon above their heads.
---
What chameleon does it gives you a huge bonus to sneak upon its activation. Combined with Escape Artist it makes you loose your aggro. But is 5x huge sneak buff better than one huge sneak buff? I can guarantee you its not. I have 1x chameleon and 2x harder to detect while sneaking  (so 3 slots total taken for maximum sneak, not 5 like in full chameleon set) and not only this single huge buff is enough to make my life easier, I don't need it as much as my base sneak value lets me to jump onto monsters heads and they still fail to notice that fact.
---
What’s that ?
---
This is what I'm wondering about. I'm actually running down my caps this evening, but surely the limit should be raised for vending. I'm also curious if the vending stash is separate from our personal stash.
---
Definitely try to squeeze some adrenaline perks in. Even a few and you'll see a diference.
---
I started using melee just to save ammo, but kept using it because it's so strong. Also because I never played fallout as a melee character. They really need to drop the base damage for all melee by 20% and add it to the base for all guns. Then they need to add a damage modifier to guns based on the stat that applies to those guns and make it the same as what strength does to melee. THEN they can start tweaking individual types.
---
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
---
Standing still and not moving is what snipers do for hours on end.
---
Too funny, I  was about say you look alot like Freddie Mercury! Awesome picture.
---
There’s way more in those areas bro.
---
Heck yeah, it’d be cool to have a section when you first start the game up of featured houses. Click on it and it takes you on a tour of the abode
---
if they REALLY want to not allow legendary drops for the new weapons. they could give us a new item. Legendary chips. they would allow you to make a legendary weapon listed in the name a legendary, you cannot remove the chip once it is installed. 
---
so example, with the Shepard's Crook you could find an "Instigating Shepard's Crook Chip" on a legendary enemy. go to a weapons bench and install the chip from there.
---
Got more than 100?
---
The harpoon gun is bugged for everyone.
---
Understood.
---
I know this is late but no he doesn't, Modus talks to what would become Eden you can find the chat log between Eden and MODUS in the generals armoury, we're you get the X-01 schematics
---
get the green thumb perk. or w.e perk that let's you harvest 2x plants per plant
---
I built my camp on top of a rail car on the tracks. Every once in awhile I'll get an xbox message from someone saying they love my camp. Lol I get so nervous that they destroyed it and fast travel back to make sure lol. This fix will make me rest a little knowing they cant hurt it anymore lol
---
Haha! nice one my man
---
I’m with you on the reward thing. The thing is, though, that I’m not going to spend 12 hours grinding on one of only two days every two weeks that I have off work for a Ghoul Slayer’s radgun or an infuriating rolling pin. There’s a point where the reward isn’t worth the trouble.
---
23
---
I guess that would explain the majority of what I've gotten in the past week have been bloodied...nothing really good, but getting better
---
FUCK YEAH
---
Flatwoods is loaded with food if you need a place to go!
---
That’s why I took mine down a while ago. They didn’t work when they were supposed to and would randomly just fire off when there was nothing around. They were more annoying than anything. I had my camp griefed a while ago and my turrets did nothing. That’s when o got rid of them.
---
That's priceless, lmao! And for everything else there's Mastercard or bottle caps. Lol. I have a secret to share as well, I made the same mistake on another set of plans awhile back. Lol. It happens to the best of us.

I don't, but here's a list.

---
How about legendary enemies stop despawning. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve killed a legendary only to walk up to it, read the legendary weapon drop, and then the body disappears. It’s immensely frustrating.
---
gives a whole new meaning to when the mutants call us little bleeders
---
They just need to improve laser rifle durability
---
Silva homestead have tons of corn and wheat  and if you use the green thumb perk you'll get double. Idk how much exactly but I say you can easily get over 30-50+. That's usually where I go to collect corn to make corn soup when I first started lol
---
I have a question about the camp damage immunity. does that mean that you could trap someone in your camp and they wouldn't be able to escape?
---
I camped out that workshop for half a day a couple months ago and between all I got from that plus what I naturally collect in the wild I haven't run out since
---
If it is a 1 star it probably isn't worth too much
---
Doesn't sound like a bad idea honestly. I just want to actually be able to use my Sheepsquatch Poison Club. :(
---
Do you know what are more rare than 3* Level 50 legendary items...?
---
1* Level 1 Legendary items, the are not supposed to exist all and can be used on brand new characters right from the vault.
---
Gotta disagree there are things worth more i.e. explosive laser rifles, flamers, cryolators, AAE Handmades. Various sets of armor
---
People didn't complain about these sets in PvE.Only some people do once they face the challenge in PvP, some of us accepted the challenge and enjoy trying to tilt that windmill.... so why nerf them anywhere but PvP?!? And if you are going to do it do it right give us options to enter 'balanced risk' servers and unbalanced risk servers. THAT is what would be fair.
---
Tried silver shroud or grognak?
---
Something with the scrip
---
I'll be on around 11pm EDT. Does that work for you? If not, I will be on tomorrow on and off most of the day. Send me a friend request in-game and I'll accept it and we can look for each other online. IGN: jchamlin
---
Btw, serums go for only 200-250 caps WITH the flux
---
I really hope they fixed the game freezing because of too many friends
---
Anyone looking for marsupial on PS4 I know someone who will sell it for 150caps
---
I did not. Aren’t those Atom Shop items tho?
---
It's honestly how I keep fed and watered... and find chems to sell to those robots who are so oddly eager to get 'em ;)
---
Can Do (luck) and Good Doggy (endurance) are basically the unsung heroes of Fallout 76! A jaunt through Whitesprings Hotel (or anywhere with a high concentration of trash cans, food receptacles and the like) will potentially net a LOT of canned foods, enough of which is dog food. The rest gets sold. Throw in a couple of water purifiers at home and I never run out, nor even low... I sell off or mule excess every couple weeks when I get over 3 digits of either.
---
Even better, if you're on PC you can get [Perk Loadout Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124) for all sorts of combined searching fun! I have a loadout just for doing the food/chem searches (meh on the ammo one), plus maxed lockpicking and hacker along with hard bargian. Sort of a catch all of money making options.
---
They're not doing hot, heavy weapons, since their main effective use was to cause stagger on sentinel players and burst them down with DPS. It was effective, and it still can be if you got the drop on someone or they don't know about the bug, but anyone else? No. You're at a disadvantage once they start hopping and whip out the tesla to aim at the ground.
---
FIX EXPLOSIVE VENTS I WANT SUPERHERO LANDINGS NOW
---
I actually got a lvl 1 executioners hunting rifle a few weeks ago. Was very shocked
---
Support 110%. My camp is also on a hill. The game is pretty generous about letting me plant stuff, but the crops look wonky as hell half floating in the air.
---
I have so much ammo I don’t use that I’m going to sell in the vending, but I need a permanent camp place. It’s sad when I’m bouncing my camp every where to put stuff in my stash
---
I might be interested in the Furious Lever Action Rifle.
---
Can you define "iirc"
---
Thx had no idea there was an established market.
---
I’ve gotten everything else, currently got 7x shielded plans and all other paint plans but never seen sentinel. Been grinding it since beta too
---
Going to take a fucking long time to get rid of my plans then. At least it says stacks of items so my drug peddling business is still viable.
---
I picked up a bunch from a glitched WS eyebot swarm. Level 1 instigating hunting rifle? Some fresh newbie is gonna love paying 10 caps for that when I set up my shop by the Overseers Camp :)
---
Yeah. They were. Not sure if they're even still available tbh. May have been lto.
---
Yea, 150 is the most average price, 250 will be on the highest end but im sure you may get one or two buyers at that price lol
---
Sounds good. The shop probably won’t be open until Wednesday, however
---
Or who have grandfathered in designs like stacked foundations :(
---
People may value those things more, but it doesn't change the fact that the majority of people aren't suckers. I mean honestly, how much would you pay for an item that was obviously the aftermath of a duper?
---
*I have only one problem but it is one of my own making I keep running out of ammo and tend not to have a melee weapon.*
---
Stick to the forest locations - left side of the map and loot all the ammo boxes and dead scorched. Scrap the extra weapons for mods - materials and add the newest mods to your weapons - armor too!  You can usually find a hatchet, bowie knife or axe while on your adventures..
---
It’s usually mid day. 11am my time
---
There is... go to your CAMP.  As long as you have all the materials
---
I'm running a bloody build, can't fit radicool in. I like my armor current armor, it works better for stealth. That being said a few pieces of unyielding would probably help quite a bit while I'm not in power armor.
---
Thanks for asking! I was also wondering.
---
I paid 40k caps for a TSE Ultracite Laser Rifle and I know it wasn't duped
---
Doing ENCRYPTID then I’m in! Gt: Chucknoris281

I think I remember seeing posts about the war drum and super sledge when they were made.

Also, whoever made that edit needs more exposure! It genuinely took me a few seconds to figure out which is the in-game picture

Do you have the recipe?
---
My CAMP has never yet been destroyed by another player
---
Only one more day, bois. I think I'm gonna make it
---
I suck hard with timezones lol I am GMT-6 (along the Rockies)

For the caps maybe, but for fusion cores or legendary melee weapons it might bring eyes.

long pew is definitely the rarest gun in the game

Are you applying real world economic laws to a video game? Don't.

If doorbells were a thing, I would load up a soundboard with Vault Tech Salesman lines from FO4 and go door to door.Maybe record the answers I get and share them here or on fo76FilthyCasuals.
---
Also... awesome account name there. Got a genuine laugh from me.
---
No but Serums for days just in case you want back ups for what ever reason.
---
Guess I'll list my plans in order of most popular, then? Shame I can't sell off all 200 in one go
---
I was actually expecting as few as 10 since that's how many slots the fermenter and punch bowl have. Pretty happy with 30 tbh.
---
when i get them.. i give away plans i already know...
---
Ouch, I'm sorry
---
I agree entirely, but at least I can use it now.
---
Legendary enemy spawns can be weird. Sometimes it's like you get all the legendaries, or none of them. They're not consistent in any way. Same goes for all spawns, really.
---
Watoga was also nerfed and legendaries were removed from the city.
---
I like the closet lady more than fridge guy because it's truly horrific because she has the time and understanding to record her mental decline and approaching death. Fridge guy sucks, but at least he passed quickly.
---
If anything you should give plasma weapons a try. A gamma reciever can give the sniper barrel 15 rounds
---
People win back to back games on Apex Legends using cheat engines. Some people don't give a fuck. They just want to ruin it for others.

Right in to the cash register at Artisans Corner myself
---
I play PC, since day 1 beta.  I play pretty much daily, even if just to login on workdays and vendor.  I have 4 characters:  Melee, Gunslinger, Rifleman, and my most recent, a heavy gunner.  I have beaten the game and exhausted the quests on my first three and now am focusing on the gunner (lvl 34 now).
---
All of my characters are explicitly devoted to their fortes and do not deviate weapon types.  Heavy gunners are by far the most difficult to play, maintain, and level up.  
---
1. Most weapons are not available till 25+ levels.
---
2. Perks start in the 30’s.
---
3. Ammo consumption is high without perks in the level up process.  
---
4. VATS is negligible vs useless.  
---
5. Damage (without perks due to level availability) is sub-par.
---
Were it not for my other alternate characters and their ability to make ammo/craft weapons, I would plainly not be able to effectively play my heavy gunner.  Also, my comrades in arms I’ve met along the way are the only viable way to funnel the ammunition I greedily consume.  
---
I am not impressed with damage yet, though I anticipate by level 60 it should be at a comparable point to make firm decisions on viability...
---
In summary, I feel that the weapons need to be available/craftable at lower levels.  I think the damage perks should be accessible at lower levels.   Heavy guns feel like an endgame objective for bored perk heavy players than an option for a player to take initially.

---
I just put some in Overseer's box at her camp. Some good ones you can sell. But ones like tinker work bench I give away.
---
Since it's linked to your stash and consumes stash space, it seems like plenty to me as well (for now).  I hope that with stash space increases we will see that 30 slot go up accordingly.
---
If you think it's overpriced now, you should have seen the 1,800 atom vault paint power armour. That was a piss take.
---
Charleston station, Grafton Station, and a few other spots.
---
This is exactly what will happen.  It will be the same thing that happens when you run around with max caps.  The caps beyond that go to Oblivion.
---
Does this consume stash space like the fermentor or punch bowl?
---
It seems like it should be, but nobody knows how it's going to work yet.
---
great find.... see ppl are generally stupid
---
For the uneducated, me mostly, what did they do?
---
Yes, so the same can be said for kids entering a chamber and thinking they're adults.

Always makes you wonder how some people have nothing better to do with their time.

---
Yes. I’m a PC player. From what I know, pc players have to use some just-for-games VPNs to boost the game. If not, the lagging situation will be more serious.

Yeah, just feel like the Nerf was too much is all. And I know they can adjust pve and PvP damage to different legendary effects cause it's already happened
---
Super frustrating for sure.
---
I use chameleon, and I believe that more pieces reduces the range at which you appear on an enemies hud. The bonus from multiple pieces isn’t worth it.
---
I would assume so. Don't see why this would be any different.
---
Thanks for all the advice,  I'll have to level up a few times to get some of those cards, and I think I'll move a couple points from strength to luck. 
---
I'll update in a week nor do with my results.
---
Awesome job. Those weapons looking great. It would be funny to make a stash box on one of those rolling suitcase setups to wheel around.
---
What platform are you on??
---
Yeah but it used to be required for lower-level armor if I'm not mistaken too. So early game on my first run through I was always looking for BF even if I was using leather armor and I could never keep all my armor fixed since it was super scarce and expensive to buy in bulk.
---
*sigh* I wish games that rely so heavily on loot would not nerf loot.
---
Got it from SB Queen drop?
---
Yeah it’s over
---
Long time ago, yeah
---
Simply go to where you want your camp and place it. The game will auto blueprint everything for you bro
---
If I remember correctly
---
I  haven't spent one penny. Spent enough hours grinding to acquire several power armor skis but that's all I plan on buying because I'm out of atoms.
---
I’ll take 1 😇
---
Yeah I did spare a thought for those who want to sell plans, seems like they are the only ones who may be a little disappointed.
---
I guess in a way this will force people to somewhat specialise. Meaning it will be more worth checking out people's shops, because it's less likely to have the same items up for sale as another.
---
They're referred to as "cap sinks". In the early game plans served this purpose fairly well. I spent most of mine on vendor plans but had them all eventually. Now there is nothing to spend caps on except trading with other players or wasting them on weird power armor plans from vendors for obscene prices. It leads to a sense of boredom that makes players stop playing. Something like charging 5k caps for a legendary reroll would have been a good one for example. But they chose to create a new currency which will affect the market in an unknown way.
---
Can't destroy camps anymore after tomorrow.

Fun fact, the 10mm submachine-gun, fully built up, totally rules. The ammo is super common. You slap a piercing mag and a good bashing stock on it to max its condition... then you rank up commando, concentrated fire, and all of your damage increasing stuff. Holy crap, best kept secret in the game. What stacks is the fire rate + concentrated fire. If you can find an AA, double/quad, or an explosive  variant, you're set. Same goes for auto handmades. The raw damage and suppressor on those makes up for the low fire rate. I imagine the auto radium rifle is pretty similar, and its got the most common ammo in the game!
---
GIRL, same. But my inside is super adorable. Got that dark wood from the atom shop, the nice navy blue dressers set and the four poster bed. It’s cozy in my place and looks like a real home, even if it’s just a rectangle on the outside lol.
---
Amen to that! And, can I have a hallelujah and praise the lord for more ammunition! F@ck you griefers, suck deathclaw sausage, from the bottom of my heart!
---
My take, and I say it with about 95% confidence is that it will function like caps, as in each character on your acct will have separate scrip accounts.  The best thing to do will be to wait til the morning when the ITV releases.  You can in theory still trade scrip.  Like if I said I wanted 20, you could give me 20 random one star items.  I still highly recommend waiting though.  It’s still speculation if she will have her own inventory pool, or you will bring in items you want to have different effects for “rerolls.”  I have a crap ton of garbage one star weapons and armor, but some could be amazing with one or two other effects added on.  Just be patient and see what’s said in the morning.

It's to summon the sheepsquatch imposter. Need a few people to help kill that fugger

Well pm me, if I can get the stupid thing to stream out here to Michigan I’ll check to see if I can even make one. If I can’t get on I’ll try next week

Definitely gonna list my legendaries first. It's nice that they at least made stacks count though

It didn’t work for the pvp challenge : /
---
Oh I would love that.
---
It's a look and feel preference at this point. Ash piles vs goo. That Stormtrooper-esque pewpewpew.
---
Green Thumb, Aaronholdt Homestead (top left of map if you haven't found it yet).
---
HUGE fields, lots of Corn, Pumpkins, Cranberries, Razorgrain, etc.  Veggies for DAYS.
---
Get/plant lots of corn, get herbivore mutation, make corn soup
---
You no longer need any other food or purified water, win
---
This is, without a doubt, the best use of the garage doors that I've seen. Really well done!!
---
Love! I have the 4 posted bed but I traded up for the modern. I need lamps! And better furniture. I really really love my bearskin rug tho.  I’m way into decorating for sure.
---
Did they say anything about cap limits? Like if my vending machine sold more than 25k.
---
Also selling ammo for less than 1 cap?  How will that be implemented?
---
I just did mine with a friend we weren't on a team in a regular server and he hit me with passive off and I hit him back and both him and I got it
---
Those downvotes are from people cap farming you using full Asshole/Sentinel armor and "legacy" duped explosive weapons who are DESPERATE to not lose their unfair advantage. Every time I bring all this up, the scum comes out of the shadows of the internet with their downvotes. But the unbalanced gameplay and dying PVP servers tell you what's really going on. These same idiots are starving themselves to death by killing off their own prey and not wanting change for the benefit of the game in general. And I have a big ol' middle finger for you whiny, skill-less gear whores.
---
Yeah I noticed someone managed to bypass the adventure mode pvp block after I did a queen fight, managed to get revenge after respawn because he got greedy, but was surprised that they managed it....
---
I’m gonna say something weird like infinite caps from player vending
---
Let's not forget some people haven't been able to complete the main quest since the game released due to the 0/5 motors crafted bug *still* being a thing almost 9 updates later.
---
I’m excited for the DMG immunity! I thought of being a total bully and put my base at the golf course, but then I had a little heart and made only spotlight! But I can’t wait for vending as well, but then it will be hard to find anyone wanted, but it makes sense to make them immune if there gonna be on the map
---
Ah. Sweet. Thanks a lot
---
I love the modern but there has to be sheets on it for me. It’s only 25 years post end of the world, some sheets must still exist lol.  Oh but yes to the rug. Got that and the deathclaw one downstairs in the workshop.
---
Unyielding boosts agility, which not only boosts stealth but also action points. I run similar build, bloody stealth vats rifleman with a lever action. All unyielding armor (my prize pieces are the two legs with reduced fall damage- it combines for 100%!)
---
I like the goo piles, but a plasma flamer is a lot of fun to use too especially if its a vampire flamer or has a 25% firerate.
---
That is straight up amazing, and super clever. Puts mine to shame, I really dig it.
---
"I havent had any problems with the most powerful gear in game"
---
Well at least tell me who’s selling those Serums for 150. I kind of want that.
---
Thought I had it all till now. No sentinel. I have initiate, knight cpt, knight, knight sgt and officer.
---
God I wish there was a mohawk, I could me Joakim from Sabaton
---
I let my teammates look through them to see if there are any they don’t know. Whatever they don’t need goes to low level players. I’ll drop them in the Overseers cache or just find a low level and give them to them. It just did that last night 😁
---
Yeah, I used to be old-hat too, the reddit lingo is very efficient to make a quick replay though, haha
---
I remember there being so many posts about this when the game released
---
They announced that it will be patched at 10AM EST.
---
Apartment above and workshop down? Mounted heads on workshop walls. Large party deck even though I have few guests. Glowing map (love this). Yup. Never did put that fucking egg anywhere tho I need to find it. :)
---
Amazing job by you two, love it!
---
There's punji boards all over the ground and another button inside that triggers the trap again once they're inside, so unless the traps break it just constantly causes damage no matter what you do- you can't fast travel while taking damage. The traps have 100% coverage and the only people I've seen survive had the healing factor and manage to kind of stand still against a wall.
---
Thanks! The added benefit is Graham will walk right through sometimes!
---
I have nightmares of the Water Temple from Ocarina... X.X
---
I'm generally pretty nice to other players, this is Fallout, the game core has nothing to do with PVP, but if a guy is being a dickbag I'm glad he got his just desserts.
---
YES! It's, funny enough, a very powerful weapon in PvP, and instigating in the files does double damage on all effects, so Rad damage is included as well. The only issue with the gamma gun is the very small capacity, and the slow 'bullets' it fires. Gotta be sneaky with them, or get the jump on someone to suddenly pop them :D
---
Alright its cool. Good luck with it.
---
Go back there at night. There's a chance something may happen.

Yeah! Workshop is open the everyone who comes by and has everything. Don’t have the budget for a real patio (it has the reactor on it lol), but visitors can get some free water and use the workbenches. Thinking about having free food in the vending machines once they arrive tomorrow.
---
I have the glowing map too! And I have the eggs lined up on the floor lol. I’m excited for the display cases, because I plan to put them there.
---
Real money not backed by "value" too. But no one cares.
---
Virtual economics works like this: Generation of currency (caps printed by rate of ~1400 per character) / Generation of goods (i've seen not a single TSE drop in entire playtime). And this fraction is VERY SMALL.
---
Everything is printed, only our time has value. Game changers on this territory: mechanically imposed exchange rates between currencies or artifical separation of them (reputation and stuff bought only from rep, incoming non-tradeable scrip), caps to prevent hoarding (25k), cooldowns (capstashes inventory respawn) and limits (imagine mountains of caps printing *without* vendor daily cap limit). Beth actually made everything to try to counter inflation, but then slapped this bullshit rng loot mechanics on top.
---
And no power can enable "demand should be this and that". No one will sell hundreds of hours to grind top roll for couple of hours to grind caps. (Still, you can snatch some items from dudes, who underestimate their value.)
---
No big cap sinks isn't a problem (sinks don't solve inflation on big picture, but tone it down), no ways to spend caps except on rng legendaries is a problem (sheepsquatch cards didn't lasted long), so it furthers devaluate caps value.
---
I'm on PS4, if you are too, you're welcome to come by. No pics, it's more of an experience really :D I actually placed my camp on a floating intertube on a shallow lake to make the entrance work.
---
The secret entrance was almost completely invisible and required you walk down and to the side to actually get in, but my friends had issues with it and so I had to redo it slightly higher and you can kind of see under the wall where you come in, just walk in.
---
I had some noob the other day keep jumping on the trigger until all the traps broke, then he walked into the less-secret entrance and gave me a thumbs up, lol.
---
Ammo-R-Us
---
I just want to get rid of all the unused ammo I have compulsively picked up and do not want to just drop somewhere.
---
Oh I really hope we can create a player made city someday. Preferably in a non-pvp zone lol.
---
Reminds me of those drive thru liquor stores. Awesome!
---
Mod it with the powerful automatic receiver and suppressor with all three commando perks, bloody mess, tank killer, adrenaline and stealth perks. You should take down most things with ease.
---
I really like the way your stairs lead up to an ominous house. You've inspired me as well.
---
Any food or armor recipes go to alts to learn to count towards my “Learn 76 of X”
---
Another bug, during adventure mode, after events, such as the SBQ fight, player slap damage exists, and people can kill players without the PvP dual agreement!
---
What sort of stealth perks?
---
