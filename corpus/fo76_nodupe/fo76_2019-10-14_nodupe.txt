I've been terrorised by the Flatwoods Monster three times in the past two days. The last time was at Whitesprings clubhouse... Purple Scorched, purple Feral Ghouls and not one, but two purple Scorchbeasts. At level 78, and all alone, I took an absolute pounding! 
---

---
All I wanted was a frog for my frog habitat!
---
---
---
Caps havnt had value in a long time
---
Haha nice, I can solo it with my bloodied meat hook build, I just die about a hundred times
---
Why are you encouraging people to exploit a bug?
---
I really hope wastelanders is this games come back and brings alot. I hope they take this chance to show how much they listen. Because I see near to no dev interaction with the community directly
---
Quake halo and counter strike arnt MMORPGs. Unless you‚Äôre trying to compare nuclear winter to them. 
---
We are talking about a queen kill here. Two completely different styles of games. Hell let‚Äôs include Tetris in your discussion.
---
Currently, there are not, Answered by /u/Gearsthecool
---
I suspect it does. Explosions deal limb damage to every body part. Cripple abilities hook the Mod Limb Damage entry point, with a chance to multiply that damage by 999 (not actually a direct chance to cripple, but usually the same thing). It seems likely that Mod Limb Damage would be triggered separately for each limb.
---
If you really want to know, your best bet is to test it. Once something has an entry point interaction, it's not strictly a data mining question.
---
That‚Äôs happen to me at the sbq event. Always gotta love being the one doing the most damage then not being able to loot it lol.
---
Very nice. I had built a treehouse a few months ago, across the highway from White Powder Winter Sports. But mine was mich smaller, I wrapped mine around the trunk of a very tall tree.
---
If it was open world PvP, many people, myself included wouldn't have even touched this game. There's a reason survival mode was always empty and got removed.
---
Nobody is around me when it happens so doubtful this is the issue.
---
Unless you know the other player wants to do it, it's nothing short of bully behavior.  Just because somebody parks their car on a street doesn't mean they agree for it to be broken into.  But, the risk is there, right?  Same thing.
---
But, if you like to be a bully, go for it.
---
This is why I don‚Äôt team with anyone.
---
Least you‚Äôre not as downvoted as me for saying ‚Äúwalk away.‚Äù But in a much harsher way.
---
I've had this problem on and off for like 2-3 months now. I stopped doing queens for a long time because of it. I just started again this week and have only been able to loot maybe 6 out of the last 10 I've been a part of.  
---
Even had one this morning where it registered, and I was able to loot the body, but there was no legendary on her, just the other junk. Like WTF?
---
I thought having a high level super mutant ravaged DC would be a cool addition. Like always in a rad/ nuclear storm.
---
Heard the datamining ama group is gonna be working on them soon
---
Okay pog
---
I have now had somebody trying to do this to me two times today.  WTF is wrong with these messed up people.
---
Thanks for that info. I've been wondering that for a while but never got around to testing it.
---
Guess I'm going back to using radshield then instead of these miserably weak glowing bloodpacks..
---
I can share my build for an example. Since I use bloodied weapons, I play at low health, so negating as much damage as possible is the goal.
---
There's no rational argument to be made with people who genuinely see nothing wrong with camping the few zones they're allowed to exploit to make the game shitty for other players.  
---
Like OP is _actively lobbying_ for the ability to make the game actively shittier again.  
---
You're actively defending your _right_ to make game zones unusable, because your little spike of glee from making someone rage quit the game forever is more important than Bethesda maintaining a steady player base of non-griefers. 
---
And you wonder why I'm mad about people like you destroying the fucking game? 
---
There's no rational debate to be had with people like you dude. The only thing I _can_ do is voice my disgust at shit like this, over and over and over again.
---
Nah, I can get enough Furious Fat Mans and Exterminator's Lead Pipes off of random drops.
---
Wait if you team with someone they can edit or build in your camp ?!!!
---
No argument here.
---
You can extract the curve tables from the game using Bethesda Archive Extractor. There's a fairly obvious pile of JSON files somewhere in there.
---
Junkies is +10% per addiction, capped at +50%. Blooded is +0 to +95% in 5% hp bands. Quad is actually a bit non-obvious due to stacking order. In general, legendary effects are better known and more clearly implemented than the non-legendary effects, but I don't know if anyone compiled a complete list, so you'd need to be specific. The relevant data for those is mostly in the ESM rather than the curve tables.
---
Faster weapon breakage from two-shot is probably due to item condition loss being triggered per projectile, but that's somewhat speculative. The readable data only allows you to guess at core game mechanics. Two-shot itself has no direct effect on durability.
---
I think this was true up until Legendary Power Armor became a thing. I think they should make a Hazmat over or under armor that is a grindable Raid rewards the same way Legendary Power Armor is.
---
lmao no.
---
I have enforcer and skeet shooter
---
I don‚Äôt even want it CLEAR. Just more aquatic and less lazy-hue-used-since-Morrowind.
---
Yeah, I had no idea armor penetration wasn't working, I just thought it was negligible.
---
Well I was never intending to violate anything. I just wanted to keep my shop open for a longer period than ten minutes when I was home and not able to actively play. Not everyone has hours a day to devote to a game. I also mad a Halloween themed house for trick or treat.... but looks like very few people will see it.
---
:(
---
Pass. I play games to get away from work but good luck to you.
---
Amen sister.
---
Yeah.  I have friends who keep building musical instruments in my camp.  One of my friends accidentally invited a griefer into our group.  The griefer destroyed my friend‚Äôs camp and left anti-black and anti-gay slurs on my camp.  Because I was looking for them and didn‚Äôt think that someone would do this, I found them two days later.  I realize that I wasn‚Äôt paying attention and could have had better situational awareness, but I don‚Äôt really pay attention to my camp unless it‚Äôs broken.
---
Two days of people coming to buy stuff through my vending machines and seeing the slurs.  I don‚Äôt think I was reported, but can‚Äôt be sure.  I actually still made a fair number of sales during that time.
---
lol this is such a weak attempt to influence the community. Nobody is gonna link Nuka mines to survival tryhards griefing. How many alt accounts you need to play amateur psychologist kid?
---
Yeah actually if a person is loitering in the zone of the unclaimed workshop while someone else is trying to claim it, it stops. It will not let them claim it until the person leaves the area. 
---
This guy showed up to a workshop I was claiming innocently. He wouldn‚Äôt leave and I needed it for a challenge. He was prob wanting to claim it after me. I try messaging him to go away and shooting at his feet and the air but he didn‚Äôt get the message. Finally just shot him one time execution style in the head and it killed him. He could had shot me without slapping too. 
---
Found out he had about 2,000 lbs of not broken down scrap on him so I claimed the shop then the bag and logged off. 
---
So yeah it‚Äôs totally possible and makes me edgy any time someone is in my workshop. Just don‚Äôt trust people.  I had enough people screw me while I was trying to experiment with builds that I just prepare to shoot on sight
---
Here's a free upvote
---
Ha think i care what you got to say
---
Nuff to respond my guy
---
EDIT: sorry that original comment was kinda mean spirited, you're not a bitch
---
Funny thing...I've bought any number of items and I've never been asked to "bid" on shit....
---
Thank you, it's good to see others feel the same. It really annoys me when idiots think getting better at a game means cheating to do better. Cheat against a computer program all you want, but giving yourself unfair advantages in ANY way over real people who are also playing? Not at all cool.
---
I hope its new it would be good xp to make up for ON a claim where you dont have to clear anything beforehand, a nice prologue to tge initial defend event, like i hear about in these mmos sometimes, a miniboss, itd be nice actually to have this implemented like per region by prime cuts standards, novice areas get deathclaws and anglers medium areas get yao guai and cryptids like sheepsquatch or wendigos and then in most of the high level areas you get a stray scorchbeast here and there but imagine if you had to take out a behemoth, mirelurk queen or like if they just had the chance for high level workshop defend events be waves of megasloths or any of those id be so stoked
---
Not sure what nuff means
---
Ok, I will definitely come by for a drink.
---
It means... You know. üòè
---
I'm a food build, I'm gonna keep playing the game how I want, and won't whine at how you choose to spend your time. 
---
I hope PvP comes back so you've got something to engage with in the same way that I enjoy cooking and building and selling preserved and freshly cooked food in my restaurant.
---
Loved Survival Mode. 
---
Completing quests and dailies in Adventure Mode is an absolute bore. At least with Survival Mode, navigating through a hostile map made these quests and dailies a fun challenge.  I miss the thrill of farming ghouls at The Whitesprings, knowing that at any moment, some Stealthboy'd Raider hopped up on med-x and lead champagne will come after my junk and aid. I miss chasing low-levels around Flatwoods with a chainsaw. I miss the skirmishes at West-Tek, where the victor earns the honor to do the XP run. Regardless of how flawed the PvP is, this game desperately needs late-game PvP outlet (That doesn't involve Workshops or Loadscreen-Royal)
---
Same here but fake bidding is 100% a thing
---
Level 166 here and have seen him once. Good luck!
---
I mean if you're home, just go over and jiggle the mouse every so often. 
---
And here's another factor...if you get kicked after ten minutes and you walk back in say, five minutes later and join a new server, MORE people will see your stuff, not less.
---
I always check out new camps as they pop up, if they've got stuff to buy, as a for example. So if you're hopping into a new world every half hour or so...that's actually BETTER for your goal.
---
sounds like one of the perks like born survivor or a piece of armor that does something similar 
---
also the whole bloodied builds are great if you fight normal enemies they are pretty burly - in a rad zone or raid they tend to get over run and die in like 30 secs in my experience
---
Some may not agree, but I still think Bethesda will fudge the numbers, and we get the rewards, regardless of totals. I've been saying this from day one. This has been hyped too much, and the only reason why this "event" existed was to act as a stop-gap until Wastelanders. Bethesda is only interested in people playing the game, no matter what they're doing, and they don't want to alienate anyone or piss us off by saying, "You guys were close but, sorry!"
---
I always more ammo than caps. And I think the market outside the game Is a bit silly and overpriced. I sold a faster fire Tesla Yesterday for 5000 caps and a junkie's handmade for 3000 because I bought an instigating 10mm for 1000. Everyone happy.
---
Perhaps! Thats what I have been doing......but seems like I am more off than on.
---
So helpful thanks
---
Oh my God that awful! Who even has the kind of time and energy for that ?? I'm sorry that happened to you. 
---
I had NO idea that people in your party could edit your camp. Definitely good to know so I can be more careful
---
Lol whatever man
---
No one is solo‚Äôing the ESO dragons.
---
:shrug: if they want you to bid, just don't bother.
---
[deleted]
---
rad sponge and ghoulish - problem is if you run that the bloodied build in the team is no longer bloodied and thus gets angry 
---
also beating the vault is easy depending on type and level - I've beat all 3 on all 3 difficulty settings (I refuse to do hard again till they get those damn timers working right) and novice is easy to the point most well armed people can solo it
---
Just circle and hop servers when it was a picture thing.
---
There‚Äôs a map somewhere of all the spawn types seems quite a few in that area.
---
I showed up late to Scorch Earth and the Queen has literally just been killed.  I did not get a shot on the Queen.  I still got the two star piece of armor, but none of the other event loot.  I‚Äôm certainly not saying I deserved anything, but have any of you guys seen a split like that before?
---
I showed up 3 minutes after it started and they had already killed it.  I wasn‚Äôt trying to leech.
---
GO BACK TO WHENCE YOU CAME FOUL BEAST
---
This guy is just making the same post on multiple accounts. Both users "witnessing" the griefing, and multiple "raiders" who are perpetrating the griefing method, or at least story. If they're found out, then they'll claim it was a "social experiment" and gloat how everyone was so easy to manipulate
---
I think I have visited three dif. Continentals. The best one was this hotel with real rooms, fully equiped, really big and classy near the Whitespring.
---
A true warrior never walks away from a chance to passively yet aggressively fight for social justice in a virtual world where the outcome matters not
---
medic legendary heals only on crit hit doesn't get bonuses from the bloodied build and doesn't help with radiation 
---
vampire would be a better choice but still wouldn't help with bloodied or rads and since I said RADS were the primary issues it wouldn't be a factor with either
---
I mean, lets be real...the really toxic crowd never really went away.  The real annoying assholes have been there all along, because making PVE players rage-quit the game is their jam.   
---
All they need to do to fix this is get rid of all global PVP, that way, hey, if you're into PVP and fighting over resources and workshops and shit? Awesome! If not... you can farm your scrap in peace.
---
That was probably the event drop. If you show up and you enter the event area, even if you don‚Äôt get a shot you‚Äôll get the item.
---
You are right, I cannot apologize enough for what I have said. I can only ask for forgiveness.
---
Bethesda's got the numbers. I doubt reddit had much influence in getting rid of it.
---
I dont agree. Fallout has never been a peaceful genre. Pvp belongs in the game

To each his own. üëç

---
I will agree with the whining about pvp on this sub and find it hilarious.. I occasionally get the urge to mess with other players too and would go into survival for that, if someone had a workshop in adventure I'd either server hop or wait.. Oh well I'll be waiting for these food builds to place their fusion generators down at a work shop and I guess that's my new outlet when I feel like pvping now.
---
Poor shotty's got nerfed into the ground. I realize that the explosive aspect was waaaaay OP but man, even with all the perks loaded in and I can't take on a Cave Cricket or a rad rat without contracting 5 diseases ? I would love an adjustment so that when a 3 star combat shotgun drops I can get excited for a moment instead of, "sheit! more CaCa for script"
---
I lucked out and found one in a med kit earlier, but I'll keep that in mind next time those stupid alcohol dailies roll around.
---
I've seen it at these locations. 
---
1.Behind the building with mines and explosive box at whitesprings  
---
2.Around the cliffs at the northern end of whitesprings
---
3.Northeast of haven church and around the sunken church 
---
4.Close to a copper deposit Northwest of darling sisters lab
---
It's all grey areas... I would be called a raider (or much worse) but it's not to bug someone or get a reaction... It's about caps and junk! So much junk. It purely business. Business hasn't changed since survival is gone. I play less actually. Once I get my big fish I call it a day. Somedays i see someone else trying to move in on my business and i can't have that.
---
And when business is done and im filthy loot rich I need places to spend someone elses hard earned caps! Like this one chef guy i came across had all the foods! Prefect stock up so when i log on next time all is well and it's straight to business.
---
Everybody's got to eat.
---
Conspiracy theories are fun, but sometimes they're more than just theories
---
How did you get it to go up there?
---
I have a deathclaw ands it great to see peoples reaction to it walking around
---
[removed]
---
What‚Äôs the claim button
---
True that makes sense. But i think the people that dislike it have been a lot more vocal than the people that do. But either way you may be right
---
Ive had a much more lucrative business model from finding my own junk to be honest. And caps are never an issue what with vending machines and the robot vendors. 
---
Sounds like you may have been to my restaurant.
---
I've been wanting this from the beginning. At least make the atomic shop skins universal. I'd like to see more variations; Clean, Urban, Cyberpunk (like bright neon colors), Muddy, Scorched, and so on. Only not make them applicable to one gun but everything, including the ultracite lasers. Why cant I put the blue skin from NW on ultracite? It's the same model as the normal laser. 
---
I'd like to see this with armors too, but again universal. And instead of monthly things it should be in world challenges like the possum badges, lockpick challenges, etc. 
---
Monthly limited skins could be cool though, wont happen though cuz the pockets are filling from atomic shop and you dont dare steal from law.
---
lol, uhh, what?
---
Like, I agree that pvp SHOULD be in the game. As an OPTION. A lot of games fix this with a PVE/PVP server system. Or with private servers, with customizable game rules. 
---
YOU shouldn't be able to force ME to be your fucking victim. Thats what people are actually objecting to. _forced_ PVP has no place in the fucking game. 
---
Any number of systems could exist to enable PVP without making it possible for a level 400 player to shit all over a level 50 player. Without making it impossible to use entire game features, because, inevitably, before to long, some one will _exploit_ that feature, not for it's intended "struggle for resources" purpose, but purely as a way to exploit the system and murder players who have zero interest in PVP. 
---
At the moment, baring people desperate for fusion cores, and "build in workshop" challenges, that's all that workshops really get used for, because griefers have destroyed the system.
---
That's it, then. Find a nice one and give it the longest barrel. 
---
I heavily suggest you take your time to test damage. The game has trouble trying to read damage correctly and higher damage means higher chances of "healing" enemies because of overkill. 
---
I had to stop using my instigating shotgun because of that. 
---
My shotgunner Also had basher 3, for roleplaying reasons. But it doesn't kill shit and you end up shooting anyways.
---
That is the spawn point for the normal extra grafton monster that roams kind of south but it is very rare to get any other spawn form that point so cool find.
---
But players have to fill the roles of npcs like raiders and bos. Plus, no one can force you into pvp. You have to be in a workshop or turn off pacifist
---
3* instigating fire axe with 50% limb damage and 90% reduced weight
---
Thanks :)
---
I just mute the TV (xBoxOne) until I'm in-game.
---
I have one but don't use it except for sbq fights. It feels too overpowered. Killing Lvl 80 creatures with a single blow is wrong, just wrong.
---
protip: start picking out ur halloween costume haha
---
Until then, raiders will keep raiding pve players in adventure. They need to revisit pvp quickly as it is a big part of the game for everyone who has beaten the game
---
Did nobody in the event get legendaries or did someone essentially two shot it and no one else did enough damage?
---
I'd like this. Like complete all the weekly challenges for the entire month and get a drawing for a random skin
---
Who the \*fuck\* says "ring pull"?
---
Exactly, pvp is the end game content. It needs a major revisit. Otherwise, they will lose the players that have beaten the quests and I cant imagine they are taking on many new payers at the moment as anytime i bring up fo76 to someone who hasnt played it yet, they say it looked bad and heard it was bad so they wouldnt waste their money.
---
The semantics of english are powerful.  The specific wording says "MAY" -- not "WILL."
---
Just like these two sentences are worlds apart:
---
"Parking your car on the street MAY lead to it getting stolen."
---
"Parking your car on the street WILL lead to it getting stolen."
---
The text doesn't say, "Claiming a workshop means other players WILL use every unbalanced play tool possible to help their frail ego's feel better about their bad life choices, while they make your life miserable as you try to use the workshop."
---
It is a known fact that the Workshop mechanics are nerfed right now, entirely because of this.  That's why you never see anybody really spending time in a workshop.  The PvP mechanics are unbalanced, and people then take them even further to be a total tool.  The result is toxic and ruins the gameplay for everybody else.
---
If anybody reading this post feels defensive and wants to argue, then I'd suggest deeply looking inwardly and considering why...
---
Not medic then maybe it reviver? The legendary that gives you a 50% chance to revive
---
The Pitt(Pennsylvania) is literally north of applachia. So hopefully we can see what it looked like before the events of the pitt dlc
---
Or the rats that follow the eyebot posing as the Pied Piper
---
Your response is gone now :(
---
Downvoting me because I like to use mines and grenades?  Whatever
---
I haven't had to deal with the plague Walker part but have had several encounters where players are throwing down a shit ton of nuka mines to try to kill me and take all my junk. It's pretty annoying. I'm not a bloodied build so luckily I dont just die instantly but yea. Was trying to do a trade and out of nowhere these random people pop up and try to kill us -_- pacifest works for hits but the mines give you rads so it can kill you
---
Nice. I really like that it‚Äôs not just a floating blob In the sky!
---
I wanna say from my play, FW Monster and Mothman are rare random enemy spawns at your C.A.M.P. Other than that statistically the most times I've seen, fought, and killed the FC Monster I was at the Whitesprings Golf Course. **Happy Hunting!!!**
---
I have this exact same problem right now and can‚Äôt fix it. I‚Äôm only level 20 and did all the enclaves solo so I really don‚Äôt want to redo that. Any luck fixing it?
---
That‚Äôs the exact thing I thought haha go back! But uh wait a second we need your loot
---
Thank you i kinda forgot to ask directly for a tech perspective, super cool to know that now though i hope i find a grafton monster inside the workshop boundaries next time!
---
GENIUS
---
That worked! Thanks so much!
---
That worked for me at the Soft Serve location! Thanks :)
---
A buddy of mine got one of each when we did a messenger quest at the bottom of cranberry bog just the other day.
---
This. This all day. OP is an ass, and not nearly subtle enough.
---
Up by Arktos there is one. Just North of it above the mine.
---
I haven‚Äôt figured out how to tame any animal. But the way I‚Äôm playing this current run isn‚Äôt a good blend with a pet.
---
We have the power. We can rebuild your camp.
---
I plead guilty to boredom - but thanks for being a great sport! I got another shot of the spread at your camp:  https://imgur.com/Mb1V2J1
---
It was great!!!
---
Yes they can add stuff if you have budget
---
It would be nice, but I think that would mean the game having to load all those pictures. I am against asking more from the game when there are so many things to fix.
---
To put it in perspective: have you ever lost a loved-one? Imagine someone finding the name of that loved-one, and say hateful, derogatory things about them over and over again. How would that make you feel? To constantly be reminded of that lost loved-one, all the while they're being spat on by someone else? That (and worse) is how it feels to be on the receiving end of racism or homophobia, and it has no place in real life, in a videogame, anywhere. The fact that you've never been the victim does not make it ok. You'd be supporting BGS' banning of racism too if you had experience, empathy or common sense.
---
If you roleplay as a racist or homophobe, Bethesda will roleplay perm banning you.
---
Honestly, one other thing I'd like is what ESO has, which I don't know why it's never been implemented.
---
A (on Xbox) is justed to jump...AND interact with things. It would make my button mapping easier. I've gotten used to making Y reload and X interact, but those all mess me up in other games. I'd rather have something like A interact and jump, X be reload and Y be switch weapons like every other game but nope.
---
It Is always like that. Negative experiences are voiced more often and enthusiastically.
---
Same at the Whitespring. I could usually run it a couple times and walk out with enough loot to clear the 150 easily but the last few months have been really stingy with the legendaries.
---
I‚Äôve got three in my shop for 25k just to flex... I don‚Äôt actually want people to buy them.
---
You know, now that you mention it.. I cant count how many times I've seen a legendary Scorched. It isn't often at all, it's more.. rare for some reason
---
So a good way around this is to make sure I Max my budget ? Can they move or delete stuff ??
---
https://fo76map.com
---
Flatwoods monster carrying a toy rocket ship, lol. Great video!
---
Another thing I didn't like is how the info was kinda hard to find. Like, finding it on the website wasn't that easy. I had to have someone give me links on here. So for the average player, they might not even know much about this event from the get go. They need to post things in the game itself about what's going on so everyone knows what to do because I have hardly seen people doing runs of scorched when I have been
---
It also doesn't like being hit for over 80k damage and (I guess?) one-shotted, because it never opens back up, nothing else happens in the event, and it ends in failure.
---
I honestly had no idea that would happen. üòÅ
---
Is there a cap on AP refresh effects from armor? I heard that 3 pieces maxes you out, is this true, or is the effect still being applied afterward?
---
Can confirm, the actual plans were there the other day--I did a double-take.
---
What do you mean by that?
---
Filling the punch bowl. You can put nukashine and then watch people go byebye
---
Sounds more like a bug than intended behavior. I've gotten there seconds before the end and hit her with a quick burst of LMG fire, maybe 30 shots, and got loot from her.
---
Yeah. And if you want to play a raider, with people who want to play responders or brotherhood or whatever, let your freak flag fly. 
---
My issue is when that's not what ever happens, what actually happens is "Oh, there's a daily where I have to build ten things at a workshop" claim and...oh, I'm dead. 
---
Because workshops aren't used for RP. They're exploited by griefers, 100% of the time.
---
The Zeta species on true weakness: Narcissism
---
The kill count on fallout.com hasn't been updated since Friday because the person responsible for updating it had the weekend off. There's no reason they couldn't have a bot post updated numbers.
---
Yes just noticed elsewhere(gilded mingun) somehow stuff happens that shouldn't. Not a coder, just asking you anything, as well as noting my ignorance of my friend's  situation., Ad well as this game.

I have killed it twice at the thorn.  I spawned in each time and it was to my left on each occasion.  I also killed one near the Skyrim wagon in the divide.

Get a thicker skin. In real life, you won't always be able to petition an authority to moderate others' victimless actions.

I wish I got him standing in front of the sign looking at it but he immediately saw me and started attacking.
---
I think it sucks that this is pvp now. Just this meta of stealth boys teslas and mad hops all over. I miss when you could manage to take ppl down with reg weapon etc. And the battle went back n forth more opposed to ass/sent armor with Tesla's. 
---
But apart from my opinion, good job dropping the three of em. Held up well and fought well
---
Saw it today in the Ash Heap. Never seen him there before. He took off before I could engage him
---
Thanks man and I totally agree. I use handmades primarily and got some handmade kills throughout this video as well but it's hard to fight teslas with a handmade so sometimes ya gotta fight lightning with lightning. I'd much prefer a handmades and no SB fight! There's no way sandman could hang with that though.

I have decided to keep one of my characters with it, but the rest carry just ten radaways and ten stimpacks. No need for more.

Have you ever lost a loved-one? Well he/she was filthy sub-human piece of filth that deserved to die.
---
If you have indeed lost a loved one recently, I am sorry but you now have an idea of what being the victim of racism/homophobia feels like.
---
Oh, you poor, sweet, summer child.
---
Wait until you run into a competent BE, AAE, or JE build.
---
Well... Lucy Harwick didn't make it to Wastelanders. 
---
We should see some ghouls, but maybe it Is toooooo soon for people to give them rights.
---
No. I don't want someone good at manually aiming being able to choose to have an advantage over me, not to mention that you've just deactivated VATS-crit builds. Either both players opt in, or things stay as-are
---
The rp of raiders is to murder and steal (griefing)
---
Had a player spend 11,000 caps on five three star pieces of armor and an explosive LMG. He immediately ran over and scripped it. ??? Wtf. 
---
All I can think is he was trying to max out before the sale weekend. I‚Äôm at max scrip ( nearly, at 890 ) so I get wanting to have plenty but it wasn‚Äôt worth 11k for 150 scrip.
---
Yeah this fixed it for me
---
also, Anti-Armor is slightly better but affects *all* opponents.
---
Ive relegated back to masturbation
---
I team with just a few and they have become personal friends. We aren‚Äôt all bad. You might be surprised.
---
Worked on another character and mess around my camp getting it ready for halloween
---
Maybe you should try not to build disgusting floating camps if you did.
---
What's happened to nuke zones?
---
This guy gets it
---
Bruh that's completely fucking stupid of you
---
üòà
---
I didn‚Äôt know I needed rad-Nadoes in my life until now. Take my upvote
---
Squash 1 bug, 2 more pop up.
---
Ok here's my rant...I really think the community is getting played on this 50% off scrip thing....yes there's a benefit to it but...I'd rather have a period of time where you could turn in unlimited scrip rather than 50% off....let me go out there and grind and turn in as much as I can....it doesn't benefit the majority like myself that have 1 alt compared to the minority who have multiple...if I saved 1000 scrip and turned in all at once more than likely its going to take me a couple of days just to get back to normal weight even with the discount...
---
This was a community link, man. The only trading server that's worth any salt is the market
---
He also can‚Äôt just smack the fuck out of who‚Äôs doing it. He wants an avenue to get some justice. 
---
I hear you though, I feel much the same way and share your view of victimless actions. 
---
It‚Äôs still fucked up though.
---
I'm L. 151 by now and I like helping people when they need it. I also like to charge cheap prices in my store so people can get the stuff they need. It only seems fair.
---
Yeah I wanna know too
---
Shotguns need either a decent range buff, slug mod, damage buff, or really all the above
---
They can‚Äôt move or delete.
---
I can‚Äôt. Just dropped one :/
---
This is why the tyranny of the enclave needs to be eradicated from the wasteland!
---
Just trying to express my hate on floating camps, they are disgusting unless it's like an airship or something lol
---
Oh man :/
---
But Deep Pocketed, Unyielding and +1 STR armor pieces actually increase your carry weight?
---
I never knew any of that. I even have the aqua boy perk, but I avoid the water at all costs.
---
What is there to do nowadays?
---
I mean what are you asking or wanting to know. If you don‚Äôt care about making a min max build, take QOL perks like pharmacy and thru hiker. Events are now on server. Big patch is coming in a month. You can trade legendaries for script so nice second chance. 
---
It‚Äôs the same thing, few less bugs but still buggy. Little better gameplay. Always fun with friends
---
That's your personal opinion. It's just a camp. Doesnt matter if it floats or not
---
We drop on the SBQ and leave spots open for unPA‚Äôd folks. Nobody really nukes WS anymore. There are better spots like Morgantown.
---
The people with this dev room item better sell it fast
---
will they update it tonight?
---
It‚Äôs still casual. You‚Äôve missed a lot depending on your hiatus. Click some posters tadpole. Join us.
---
Nothing really you gotta make your own fun
---
I find them disgusting because they are so unrealistic, and you might find someone around with the same thought.
---
I remember I even saw a post asking about all the hate towards floating camps lol
---
Did a loop today. West tell. Radio. Hawk. Steakhouse. White spring. Sunken. Watoga. Huntsville. Harpers ferry. Went to script and wasent at cap. 
---
I was like wtf...
---
I doubt it. Probably tomorrow morning they'll let us know how we did.
---
I think this is what he found: [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/File:FO76\_scorchbeast\_concept\_art\_03.jpg](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/File:FO76_scorchbeast_concept_art_03.jpg)
---
Yes it Is. In fact, the guerrilla build allows for infinite vats AP if you take a 10mm and mod it with the auto receiver, aligned barrel and grips and Green dot sights. 
---
It needs to be said, however, that you will suffer from the same issue commandos suffer (ammo consumption) without hitting as strong as a commando.
---
Yeah I understand they are off on weekends but it's weird that they cant have a bot upload it every few hours
---
Just dropped one.
---
In my toilet.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
Yeah but then you have to maintain them, the way i play the only things i ever have to repair at all is my two guns, plus the very rare camp once over since i don't have any vendors and thus players don't often lead shit to my compound. 
---
I am not saying my build is meta tier, it just works really really well for a guy like me who fucking hates the shitty durability mechanics. 
---
Now if the game worked like F3 or NV and i could fix my shit anywhere as long as i had the skill and parts then i would promptly abandon this, but as long as i have to stop what i am doing and go searching for a bench every twenty minutes i am gonna avoid doing that as much as possible.
---
Solo the silo, speed run it, buy guns, make serums, sell shit, farm, join free events, help low levels, triple nuke the queen, drink Nukashine, go see Biv, hang out with teammates, watch the pied piper robot lead rad rats around, visit player settlements, give free shit to low levels, etc.
---
Weird. I found 5 at the radio, 2 at the damn, 3 at Huntersville in one run today and 3 at some random small house on that side of the map (I run my farm route). Hardly ever find anything at the steak house tho.
---
500/1500/3000 is going price for max weapons 1/2/3 star. You can get that all day if you know where to look.
---
so bloodied is not OP, stealth is not busted, shotties are not useless, pistols apart from a full scale niche crit build are not useless, rifles are not better than any other weapon (especially for pvp)? 
---
are we sure we are playing the same game?
---
Wow never seen this before, so they weren't actually bats from the start? That things looks menacing, but I'm glad they went with bats, irl some breeds (?) can look pretty mutant as it is and they have a lot of superstition around them.
---
Well you're idiots. This is a fucking game with two headed cows and bdsm robots and a world stuck in the fifties. If anything, floating bases fit.
---
The armor pieces were shit but he scripped that three star explosive LMG. That‚Äôs the one that killed me.
---
I have a big one im building too (my first camp) but mine is up on top of the hill next to the boy scouts platform jumping across from the resort up the hill from the overseer's camp, kinda pissed you beat me to it, but good job it looks great.
---
99% of the time when someone mentions they bring a gun with them for snakes while doing outdoorsy stuff, the implication is that it's for venemous snakes
---
I'd like to see that, and agree with another reply that they should apply to more than one thing. They ALL should. $5 in Atoms for a weapon skin that only works on ONE weapon? What a joke.
---
They seem to tweak the drop rate all of the time but something seems fucked these last 3 days. Not only can I not find any legendaries but they are dropping trash. Since I've posted this I'm up to 7 2/3* legendaries and I've gotten 6 1* drops and 1 2* drop.
---
I've been playing for 2 hours straight and gave not even gotten half of my daily scrip.
---
Nuke zones aren‚Äôt nerfed. I‚Äôve had one Queen not be legendary in 10 launches.
---
Nothing has.
---
Level 57 here. I‚Äôve killed him twice, once solo and once with my son and daughter-in-law (#FamilyGoals). 
---
Solo kill was at Whitesprings Golf Course. It was night, and he was just standing in the fairway. Took a far away sniper shot (.50 cal receiver on a BOS Rifle), which aggro‚Äôd him. He attacked and I finished him quickly with my AAE Handmade. 
---
Group kill was in the Divide, up the hills to the west of Autumn Acre Cabin. My son encountered him and was under attack. My daughter-in-law and I fast-traveled to him, and we all took him down (I used my AAE Handmade again). 
---
I took a picture of the solo kill with my camera, and now it‚Äôs one of my loading screens. 
---
[Dead Flatwoods Monster (WS Golf Course)](https://imgur.com/gallery/NA4Q5C6)
---
Yes please
---
Well those are well explained, backed up with game lore, floating camps aren't, and theybare bot physically possible.
---
If you get so riled up because you built one of those, then maybe you camp could look better lol
---
You're thinking "Heart of the Swamp" event, I'm not talking about that.
---
No issues other than my trapper chest piece displaying over an item I "bought"
---
Thanks, documenting and submitting
---
Team mates can only add items to your camp, not delete or scrap anything from your camp. The only way it can be destroyed is by NPC enemies, pvp, or nukes.
---
I don't think tank killer has an event on shotguns.
---
Just the fixer because it‚Äôs an earned plan.
---
how about the rise of 'ronto, or the first stirrings of the master's army from the west, or Unstoppables world (like nukaworld, but comics based)...
---
Yeah, it helps to go Junkies for more damage, Anti Armor 10mm
---
Sometimes, killing them too fast makes that. Take your time, don't use your best weapon and pray other players do the same.
---
Maybe try closing and reopening the game? I bought and crafted that awhile ago with no issue.
---
It should be wired for electric
---
The purveyor provides legendaries for scrip.  There is no other or alt function.  The purveyor provides legendaries for scrip.
---
Bloodied is a trade off. High output for surviveability. That‚Äôs called a balance. Max stealth is only achieved with complete build for it with perks, not every build using stealth. Pipe pistol gets double buffs. Shotguns are still very strong, I think you confuse them for when they were META with TSE. Game wasn‚Äôt developed around PvP and there will always be a ‚Äúbest‚Äù weapon for PvP. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs ‚Äúbest‚Äù TSE use to be best and was changed. 
---
An unbalanced game would have positive perks without drawbacks. Mutations are balanced. Get something lose something. 
---
I think you‚Äôre confusing the type of game this is with others. This is a MMORPG. Not a first person battle Royale shooter. Each game isn‚Äôt started from a zero slate.
---
I agree. It is fucked up.
---
But does someone really deserve "justice" over using a naughty word? Just don't buy the guy's stuff. If you want, go find him and tell him how much you disagree with him.
---
Reddit has turned into tumblr 2.0, over the years, with its culture being pushed toward hysteria and authoritarianism. It's really too bad. 
---
I miss the early days of gaming where chat was unmoderated; everyone gave each other shit, regardless of race or nationality. If some white kid called a black kid the gamer word, the black kid would call him a "honky" and everyone would live another day. Competitive trash talking. It was *fun*.
---
Have fun with your sterilized safe spaces, I guess.
---
Theres a neat one east of top of the world in a pond, i consider that "flat"
---
What was the first affix? Just cause it‚Äôs explosive doesn‚Äôt mean I would keep or sell.
---
Just play the fucking game. 
---
Why does everyone post the same ‚Äúis it worth playing‚Äù question!? You‚Äôre asking people on a subreddit dedicated to the game. Of course we‚Äôre going to tell you to fucking play it. 
---
Pop it in, give it an hour or two of play time. If you‚Äôre having fun, *great*! If not, do something else. It‚Äôs not like you were going to spend those hours doing something productive anyway. 
---
/rant
---
Actually my end game was when I no longer needed to run around wearing power armor because I came across the right combination of legendary armor.  And I can jump off Seneca Rock from the peak and suffer no damage.  It‚Äôs so beautiful...well, to each their own.
---
Completely disagree that PVP is ‚Äúthe‚Äù end game content, though.  Some of us wanted co-op and to rebuild America.  Instead we got this...pile of brahmin poop.  I just wanted to built settlements, so Preston Garvey would have something to do 175 years from now...
---
Are you trying to add an atom shop backpack skin to the small backpack? I wasnt able to do that when I tried..? Although I can craft a large shovel pack on my characters that have completed the order of the tadpole quest... I think that may be a current bug..?
---
And I have _zero_ interest in, and should not be forced to "role play" with people who's view of "RP" is literally just being as shitty a person as possible.
---
I love it, next time I join up with my black buddy I'm putting no crackers allowed.... see how long it takes him to notice
---
That is if sitting around with my thumb up my butt qualifies as masturbation
---
I know someone‚Äôs going to say, oh poor you... but I haven‚Äôt capped my script on my 3 main accounts. I usually have zero, and I mean zero problems capping by just playing the game. This week I‚Äôve had problems. Even bought some one day. 
---
Oh well probably just rng. Someone else is probably swimming in them.
---
Then play a single palyer game? Idk. Dont like the mechanics of a game? Go play a different game
---
I couldn‚Äôt agree more. We talked serious shit back when we played Quake. Best thing is, those crazy fuckers are still my friends. Hence the ‚ÄúNMP‚Äù in front of Rogue. It‚Äôs my old clan tag.
---
lol
---
Na you laid into them hard. I do miss the traditional weapon fights. But yea you cant sit back and not follow meta when it becomes the best option. Doubt we will see this in the next video tho hahaha. Video gets titled "getting laid out"
---
This game goes beyond that, its hilarious watching scorched unload all of their shells at 10m without doing any damage.
---
It was medics and I agree, garbage, that‚Äôs why it was for sale. My point was the price was 4800 c
---
Counter sniping with a slug shotgun was a highlight of BFBC2 and BF3/4.  BFBC2 had more brownie points for it though since you couldn't add a scope.
---
Oh ok cool. I haven't actually played the game yet, but I enjoy seeing what people come up with. :)
---
I literally killed a Fabled Flatwoods Monster for the first time yesterday and it was the first time I‚Äôd seen one since the first couple months the game was out, did they up the spawn count?
---
You require the -25% AP cost legendary to make this work. Otherwise it is around 4-5 AP per shot.
---
Bruh my camp is floors and some work benches. This is a fucking game and some folks take it way too seriously. Jesus christ.
---
I spent all day yesterday hunting down Scorched, hopefully we hit the goal
---
Congratulations!! Nothing like your first win. :)
---
It was a couple dozen foundation pieces with a total of four staircases holding up maybe eight upper floor pieces, with pillars for extra support.
---
Is that enough to meet with your personal approval? It really means a lot to me.
---
Well no it doesn't work like the pipe bolt action perk wise.
---
Imo you don't even need skeet shooter if you mod a combat shotgun right, I don't use the perk myself since I found little difference.
---
I just use the enforcer perk and the damage perks that's it.
---
This has been 3 days for me now on 3 characters. It's finally reached the point for me where I'm starting to feel that this isn't random variance.
---
You must be covered in dots from the ten foot pole.
---
Thanks for the clarification! Much obliged!
---
That's sounds good to me, nice camp. Actually sounds like a temple or something.
---
They may have? I have seen like 3 in the last month or so?
---
Oh stop already. In a post apocalyptic world (In game/lore) those things are to be expected (Racism, bigotry) because there's no law/order. Why thinking 'homophobia'/'Racism' in a nuclear apocalypse is something to worry about is beyond me. If people are role-playing as that then by all means let them. They're Raiders pure and simple or in a technical sense: Post-War neo-Nazis.
---
Ghouls are treated that way not humans of color. So stop comparing what people do in-game/universe with the petty nonsense and deal with it.
---
People are people, no need to be PC about human nature.
---
They nerfed whitesprings pretty bad
---
Can't have people gathering lots of scrip when she's offering a discount!
---
I used to see them all around the forest but until yesterday I hadn‚Äôt seen one since BETA either, then ran into one somewhere in the southern half of Savage Divide
---
Huh, interesting
---
isnt it a skin for the standard backpack?
---
it wont work on the small backpack
---
Well I don't think anyone is taking it too seriously, at least I didn't call others idiots over some camp problem.
---
Not looking to good unless we get 11 mil schorced killed by tommorow
---
Well I‚Äôll for sure be doing my part
---
How so?
---
Good luck
---
Well certain trees and bushes can actually be removed automatically when you put things on them, but I think they should increase the number of stuff that we can get rid of.
---
This quest doesn't work for me anymore.
---
Not really. It was mistakenly giving us more legendaries than intended and taking away from everywhere else. It is different now but it wasn‚Äôt nerfed, just corrected. 
---
I get more legendaries now than I ever have and maybe they will make some more adjustments to make it better at WS. I‚Äôm good regardless.
---
There was a mod in Fallout 4 that did this... easier to see through but less cool looking IMO
---
The only times I‚Äôve ever seen Legendary Scorched are Scorched Hordes and the one the pops up in the Airport
---
All five.
---
Have you tried relogging?
---
Fo76 takes place in 2102, super mutants didnt exist into 2287. Please explain how its backed by game lore...
---
That's been my experience most of the time when I ran that event!
---
I recommend building around Vats and critical hits to boost damage. 
---
10mms gain access to a silencer which allows you to use Covert Operative and Mister Sandman for 3.75x your night time damage. For comparison, 19% HP bloodied build deals about 3.24x the damage. Critical hits ignore any damage resistance an enemy may have and increases damage done. Concentrated Fire allows you to easily target heads for upwards of 2x more damage. Some enemies have different weak points and different values for bonus damage though. Yao Guais, for example seem to only take 25% more damage from head shots according to my tests. That combined with the 3.75x sneak attacks let's you deal 7.5x your damage per shot. Add in some critical hits (which are also doubled for head shots) and you have some disgusting damage.
---
It does fall off hard for any large group events like SBQ, though it seems everything sucks in comparison to a proper Meat Hook build on her. Also, if you plan on doing PVP, Vats is mandatory as you have no way to stagger players to turn off full sentinel assassins sets. A lot of PVPers are using the Strangler Heart power armor nowadays though for the poison stacking. You'll have no problem until you run into stealth boys. They are the hardest of counters to this build.
---
Horde events guarantee a legendary drop, and they pop up frequently. The daily quest Idle Explosives took me to Crevasse Dam where I found 2 legendary Super Mutants. AWOL Armaments produced 3 legendary Gutsy‚Äôs for me. Start looking in other places
---
Sticks and stones may break my bones but Chappelle shall live forever.

You can find him near the Charleston railroad station.

They rotates, for example ash heap dailies in Camden Park are 3 days rotation. The only buggy dailies for now are Cop a Squatter, Trick or Treat? If you logged off or disconnected the dailies removed from your quest log. Sometimes the Cop a Squatter daily can't be completed idk why. 
---
For Idle Explosives If you can't find the quest marker for explosives try to zone in and out of a building. Sometimes the quest marker for the explosives will appear.
---
I saw one in the forest today.
---
I neglected to mention that he had griefer friends to help him
---
The spawnrate of bloated ones was dropped pretty hard
---
You're so mean I bet you beat your own meat.
---
Can't be encouraging people to keep playing . That's for sure.
---
I‚Äôve noticed that. So I just nuke the Queen. :)
---
Some legendary affixes could use love too. Nocturnal is rather useless. If I have to be a glass cannon with Berserker's then why not just go Bloodied since it has higher damage scaling with lots of synergies.
---
I've reloged and even changed consoles. The issue is the same. 
---
Although, if it doesnt work with the small backpack, that's probably my issue. I didnt know that there was a shovel back pack. I thought it was just a reskin of the small backpack and I hate the way the small backpack looks.
---
Well the same studio that made Fallout New Vegas is also releasing [The Outer Worlds ](https://www.pcgamer.com/the-outer-worlds-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/) in 2 weeks. Soooooo, ....
---
If you don't like the forward progress to a less shitty game they've made, try playing a different game. Like Rust. You can be a real sack of shit in that game to anyone at any time. 
---
Fallout doesn't NEED to be like RUST, and it would be a _shitload_ better with zero PVP features than it is now, but a happy middle ground is just fucking much for you folks, because you don't enjoy PVP. You enjoy griefing.
---
No shit, they reward scrip? That's awesome! I gotta see how much I have now. Not a bad way to dailies honestly.
---
And it looks awesome
---
What they should do is allow you to add a ballistic lining to the hazmat suit. Maybe 50 DR or so. Or maybe have different levels of lining, but you have to give up some rad resistance per level.
---
 Idk. Think it would be a nice addition, especially for the low levels that cant afford power armor. I remember back when i first started playing the game. Someone launched a nuke, and i wanted to join in so badly. I just stood at the edge of the rad zone being envious of all the fun everyone else was having. Lol
---
Yeah. I've got 2 accounts with a level 350, 150, and 130. So I'm definitely aware of all of the spots to farm legendaries.
---
I haven't seen AWOL pop up at all. Horde events are almost non existent and legendaries flat out are not spawning. I hit a dozen locations on every run I do before server hopping just like I have been doing since the Beta
---
I dont take workshops from people because i know you'll complain on reddit cause youre not good enough to defend yourself. I pvp outside of workshops in pvp circles. So yeaahhh.
---
Well Fallout 76 established new lore saying that they were already doing FEV experiments in West Tek before the war, and created the super mutants.
---
Previous games also indicated Super Mutants exist before 2287, not sure why would you think they did not exist
---
Not even in the bunker?
---
Listen man... gotta level with you. You shouldn't speed "swing" your bone until it's Bloodied.
---
There's groups for that kind of thing down at the YMCA. Get help. We're rooting for you.
---
Crafted consumables, with reagents coming from plants at your camp, without taking stash space, and on need demand. Can‚Äôt get that with food or chems.
---
I would love bulked ammo.
---
It keeps spawning in my inventory instead.
---
Umm, plasmacaster?
---
that is definitely your issue.. its a skin for the standard backpack
---
I think a lot of people actually prefers SS over power attack damage.
---
The claim I‚Äôm making is there will only be 1 vehicle that is piloted by 4 + players. The others can be npc driven... or just standalone non-drive able vehicles. I‚Äôm explaining it essentially like this... the coming patch wastelanders is supposed to introduce factions with actual human/ghoul/companion-like npcs. So if we had factions returning to Appalachia like Brotherhood of Steel, or raiders, or Synth Enclaves, then wouldn‚Äôt it be possible to at least provide a driveable vehicle I.e. (B-52 Bomber at airport or Vertibird Gunship)/ or mountable creature I.e. (Raider Radscorpion..?)? I understand that the game can develop frame rate issues from a lot of activity in one area... that‚Äôs totally reasonable. I don‚Äôt understand though why 1 spawn per faction of a drive-able vehicle would cause these frame rate issues...?
---
The old cheese on the hamster wheel game design ... LOL
---
I only pvped in survival, and I'm going to join the raiders in wastelanders
---
It‚Äôs your damage. I‚Äôm telling you it‚Äôs all over the forums and Facebook. 
---
Turn on damage numbers and double check. She has huge armor and unless your pushing high damage or armor pen you will be surprised. 
---
What build are you? Hitting her soft but with a machine gun won‚Äôt cut it. What I tell people and it works, is get an axe or pole hook (armor pen modifier) use incisor. Power attack her. 
---
Turn damage numbers on and check first. You have to do substantial damage to her, you can‚Äôt just tag her anymore.
---
I just want protest signs and cool mods for it.
---
There is actually another concept art that looks different: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/File:FO76_scorchbeast_concept_art_02.jpg
---
It looks like Ultracite was originally going to be red based on the SB concept arts. This is how scorchbeasts would have looked like if Ultracite was red: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/File:FO76_scorchbeast_concept_art_01.jpg
---
Full sets of Power Armor? Where? I find that hard to believe since no chassis spawns a full set anywhere AFAIK.
---
Yeah, and its so much less annoying that the super sledges flame.
---
Depends on ammo junk or bear arms. Lots of my cannons have RW.  Usually though my stims and rads get outta control and I have it on.
---
Yeah, which wiki? Getting access is easy as hell.
---
Just like the Fastnacht rares...
---
You show no understanding of the Moth.
---
There is a huge list (over 400) of strange encounter points, but of those, the ones with any useful descriptions/locations for both the Mothman and Flatwoods Monster are:
---
- Clarksburg Shooting Club
---
- Abbie's Bunker
---
- Pumpkin House
---
- New River Gorge Resort Ropes Course
---
- Berkeley Springs
---
- Harpers Ferry Tunnel
---
- Sundew Grove
---
- Devils Backbone
---
- Whitesprings Golf Course
---
- Hornwright Air Purifier Site #02
---
There is no indication of any sort of way to improve your odds. 
---
From past experience, I know I have seen the Flatwoods Monster at Uncanny Caverns and Whitesprings Golf Course. I've seen the Mothman a few times (not from this list), but can't recall the exact location. Answered by /u/Sergeant_MQZ
---
They could have slavers go from the Pitt to dc too
---
I was once the king.   Visiting camps at my folly to spread the wealth of my hard work. Now I sell dirty teddy bears and used video games to whomever visits the the green grass of whitesprings
---
Fucking food builds lmfao
---
It should be different, unless they can tell who placed the letters. It could have been anyone they teamed with who did it maliciously just to get the person banned.
---
You got any specific build lists for this type of class? I really like using my 10mms and I have 5k 10mm rounds.
---
Reddit is turning into Karen?
---
Bear Arm as well i thought
---
&gt;You can still do the old water edge glitch that's worked since fallout 3
---
Since Morrowind, actually.
---
Inb4 the "Fallout 76 uses an all-new engine hurr-durr" comments these posts usually get.
---
TBH you might have a point, because it sounds like you play longer daily than I do. From my POV as someone who plays 1-2 hours nightly and maybe 4-6 hours on days off, Legendary drops are the same, or more frequent lately. That being said Whitesprings has few to none for me lately. There‚Äôs definitely a change to how and when Legendaries spawn, and I first noticed it 2 patches ago.
---
You can add things like Nails for bleed, Barbed Wire for Raw Damage, Replace the sign with a neon sign for energy damage. Hell the sky is the limit.
---
I use explosives, shotguns, missile launchers, grenade launchers. I‚Äôm dealing heavy damage.
---
This guy knows! Geurilla build is fun, i have one. Taught me how to sneak lol. Through that experience i made a commando build. Its definetly gonna teach you a few things
---
No, but I still see it in people's vending machines sometimes
---
Oh don't worry the 700 atoms for an ammo converter is probably coming in a few weeks.
---
Thanks for the tip. I had to manual reset my BIOS after my initial changes, but I just ran a dungeon without difficulty after I went back in and made some tweaks. It took some more Google searching on my phone, but I figured it out it seems.
---
Wait....Scorched can have legendary variants?
---
I don't think I EVER saw a Legendary Scorched.
---
The Unstoppable monster is great for power attack stealth kills.
---
I find a lot in the Charleston herald. Drop all you have an start a fresh collection. I had to drop 190 of them because of the bug.
---
Thought the experiments in appilacia only produced snallygasters and the Grafton monster.
---
I see what you did Ayn
---
You should be able to test these by using the damage numbers in your settings
---
I mean you could read my "I'm sick to fucking death of sacks of shit exploiting the workshop system by sneak murdering me, stealing my shit, and running like cowards" frustration as "Not good enough" like, yeah, if you're in a non-matched game where level 600 players are put up against level 20's, that's a legitimate concern. 
---
In practice, workshop hopper griefers are just all garbage humans. 
---
Enjoy PVP with other people who enjoy PVP. Don't drag me into it. Why is that controversial?
---
Children of Atom could be forming underground...
---
Still not updated and showing 23.9 million kills
---
Duct tape two signs together and put a lawnmower blade in the middle, or attach two axe-heads (one on each side) for armor penetration.
---
Or... my personal favourite? Make it function like the ballistic fist and have a frag mine duct taped to the end. Slam it down on someone, then "reload" it for a close range explosive delight.
---
All in all, ramshackle melee fun. Have the plans for different "skins" (dad needs jobs, end automation, etc.) all unlock through scrapping, and make it spawn legendary and go to level 50. Fun gimmick.
---
That's great!
---
He mocks the Moth.
---
Yeah, I will get them all the time. I've got a machine full of em!
---
Attack other players at workshops.
---
I quit game and came back and it was fixed quest complete yay. Now how do I find the ‚Äúexplore the command center‚Äù?
---
Why do you bring junk into workshops if you know someone's going to jump you?
---
Ballistic Bock, High Voltage Hefe do pretty good effects. Rad Ant Lager gives you the best carry weight buff out of anything in the game.
---
*THIS IS ALL I HAVE BEEN WANTING SINCE BETA I JUST WANT MY OWN PERSONAL PUMPKIN PATCH FOR PUMPKIN SOUP*
---
I see. That was super helpful, thanks!
---
I take power plants, build defenses and some crafting, and usually just build a generator to power the fusion core extractor.  I like having plenty of fusion cores because I use power armor alot, I also like having workshops spread around for the free fast travel.  I KNOW I can get fusion cores in white springs, but have no real interest switching servers unless it's to get away from someone who's irritating. otherwise I just want to play the game.
---
Thats what Im talking about, we have a shit load of melee weapons, and not enough mods. You never see people using things other than Super Sledges, and super sledges only have 1 mod. Theres no point to garbage weapons unless they:
---
1. Have end game mods that put them in comparison to late game weapons.
---
2. They have the ability to roll as legendary weapons. 
---
Like, I would love to have a chainsaw, with like 10 mods that I can think off the top of my head. Sadness however:
---
1. It has like 1 mod.
---
2. Does not spawn legendary.
---
I die a lil inside everytime I think about it.
---
I, too, wish to know where these full sets are.
---
People use those for the queen, for everything else, pretty sure BSS is the norm.
---
I didn't even know these were rare. My main has had both for months.
---
Planters are in the game already. I dont understand why we they haven't given them to us. But also yes a lot of us are praying they release Halloween decorations this Tues. If they wait until the 29th to release with the event to where they are only relevant for 2 days I'm gonna be really sad..
---
i have a mirelurk king, and 4/5 times the player im playing with will tell me there's a mirelurk king and its not attacking them.
---
When someone is excommunicated do we hunt them to the ends of the earth?
---
There's a spot in the toxic valley that is next to the water park where you can place an acid extractor, the land is flat there. It's a good spot, I used to live there!
---
Chainsaw actually has 4 mods, and theyre pretty cool, but there is definitely room for improvement. Problem with melee mods is that they dont have shit like barrels or magazines ot receivers, so they receive the short end of the stick mod-wise. I would still love more though, and pray bethesda adds more.
---
&gt; I personally have had something like this happen TWICE today in my CAMP, two different players.
---
No. No you haven't.   Nice try though :)
---
I mean you can but we dont. The excommunicated is just a blacklist but called differently
---
Listen to the holotapes, patients had their skin turned green, and some had their voices changed into a super mutant one during recording.
---
I am not so sure. I mean, I would love to be able to sell those types of ammo I don't use, but it Is important that we lose something in the process. Otherwise, ammo will stop being a problem, when it has to be.
---
Hypothetically - if we were blowing past the target and they didn‚Äôt want it to end with a whimper, they could just forget to update it.  I hope that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening, and not the reverse- that Bethesda doesn‚Äôt want to show us that we are way short.
---
There's a guide somewhere on the sub. Really comprehensive, I used it for my yao guai
---
How the mighty have fallen.....
---
No guys I mean mine still fires every time I hit jump.
---
Try them all to see what you prefer personally. Numbers mean nothing compared to how the item will effect your personal play style. I found that I really liked using Ultracite PA because it felt more agile than the other ones.
---
The former looks pretty dragon like tbh qnd whilst it looks wicked I can see why they didn't go with that, with Skyrim still being fresh.
---
The second one is really interesting though because I assume that's where the actual term '*Scorched*' comes from, bc as they are now I guess maybe scorched creatures look burnt? There's not much connection to the word really.
---
Thanks to you as well for sharing, I'm loving this AMA
---
Looks cool!
---
Copy pasted reply from a month ago
---
Not this again. 
---
Seriously how cheap do you have to be to fleece the taxi driver that comes to your shop.(yes I know the taxi driver is a mutibazillion dollar business that you all hate to death. Take solace that they don't see a single dime from your fast travel costs) 
---
A player just paid caps to visit your store and you want more and more. Here's an idea, maybe sell something worth buying and them you won't notice the pittance you would've received from the fast travel costs. I just picture you with your face pressed up against the window, thinking "that taxi driver sure has it made." 
---
Would it drive players away from normal centers? Sure maybe but I don't see it in anyway enticing others to visit you business. "Let me spend 3x more than I normally would just to find out this vendor is selling Halloween costumes and pipe rifles. Yeah he got me out here on false pretenses but I'm glad I rewarded him for his bait and switch."
---
There's a reason why the 3 first rules of business are location, location, location. Customers will much rather try hitting a new store if It's next to others as opposed to trying just one way out of the way,  in this case to minimalize fast travel costs. 
---
Regardless it's a lame idea for people who don't understand how to make a profitable business.
---
To be fair, it's been a while since I've actually tried to _use_ a workshop for it's intended purpose, because, and not even kidding, it got to the point where within fifteen minutes, 80% of the time, someone came in, murdered me, looted the shit I was collecting, and left. 
---
And that's my entire godamn point. Workshops exist, in theory, to generate resources. In practice, sneaking in to gather fusion cores is...pretty much the only viable use outside of atom challenges, because of shitty people who abuse the mechanic to be assholes.
---
Yea I was just thinking about how it worked in the movie.
---
How do you start the quest when you buy one from a vending machine?
---
Oh lol. We hunt them down till they chop off a finger and then it all cool. Lol
---
It‚Äôs showed us short by 11m since at least Friday afternoon.  Bethesda apparently doesn‚Äôt want to update it
---
And again, I have to say you make me laugh and think of Will Ferrell playing the guy. Gave you a Silver, last time. Don't have one now.
---
- Is there any point in using the "sleek" mod for leg armors if you already have the speed demon mutation active?  Meaning, does the speed boost while sneaking that "sleek" provides actually give you a speed bost if you already have speed demon going?
---
- What kind of protection from explosives does the dense armor mod for chest actually provide?  Anecdotally, it seems incredibly strong to me.  I can't really recall ever dying from explosions once I started using the mod, but I'm not sure whether to chalk that up to just increasing my DR in general or if the mod really a good choice.
---
I launched that nuke and crashed because of the bug. I managed to restart the game and get back just as the queen went down. I think I hit it twice.  Yesterday I saw the same thing happen when the nuke was placed leaving the sundue forest open. The server ended up crashing.
---
Will have to go for a visit. Good thing i use xbox!!
---
Yep! I also keep freezing in the damn vending machines!
---
1. What are the values of the Pneumatic chest armor mod? What kinds of stagger does it reduce?
---
2. What kinds of stagger are ignored while using the level 3 Adamantium Skeleton perk?
---
3. What other things can reduce or eliminate stagger?
---
4. What are the hidden rad resistance values that power armor has? Having similar rad resistance numbers with regular armor does not reduce the same amount of rad damage.
---
Just walk around, see appalachia, put your camp somewhere beautiful. There's more to the wasteland than conquest
---
Me too. I think it's the game's way of saying, "Are you SURE you want to go there?"
---
[This link](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=36545ff&amp;d=sg2p02pe2ek1eh2c72ic4ab0an2af0ao0a51ai0a32a02lv2lk2lt2l12l71lu0&amp;w=&amp;m=51cfa&amp;nw=&amp;n=) is my pistol build if I remember it correctly. You don't have much room for damage cards after the necessary sneak attack multipliers, so I spend three points in only the first rank of the three Guerrilla cards and then grab even levels of Adrenaline and Gun-fu.
---
For desirable legendary weapon effects in no particular order: **-25% AP cost in Vats** will allow you infinite shots on a properly modded 10mm pistol. 
---
**Faster Fire Rate** is incredible and I prefer it over explosive. Though **Explosive** is great for being able to target other players in Vats easier. Crouched players cannot be targeted unless shot first. The explosion effect will let you Vats them again. 
---
**Anti-armor** makes sense as pistols have no perks to help this. Though I use zero AA on my pistols and they melt enemies quickly thanks to critical hits ignoring all armor anyways.
---
**Two shot** seems really great for Vats. The critical hit secondary projectile rarely misses and seems to get critical damage itself. I have a TS FFR Plasma pistol and it is managing to kill faster than my PVP Vats commando character.
---
Hopefully that gives you some ideas. Small note for Concentrated Fire: it takes half a second to properly increase accuracy when shooting full-auto. Fan the trigger to ramp accuracy to 95%, then hold for full auto. For Criticals: hold the trigger to maintain that half-second accuracy ramp delay and the following two-three shots after a critical hit will hit every time.
---
True. But the goal seems unrealistic
---
This made me laugh.
---
I find it it's disgusting that you find it disgusting.
---
Your sensibilities insult me.
---
I will build a floating stairway to heaven in your honor that serves absolutely no purpose. Other than existing to disguste you.
---
You have now given me a reason to play the game.
---
Know that all things I build will now be floating till they shut the servers down.
---
FML
---
Before you pick a perk you pick the special that you would increase.
---
If you picked the ones other than charisma then navigate to the charisma perks, it will raise the special you picked and give you the charisma perk.
---
And, after level 50 you don't gain additional specials but you can reassign 1 point (or get a perk) per level.
---
But those arnt bud. Zero armor pen. Turn on damage numbers. I throw nuka mines for giggles and they do a quarter what my melee swings do at best. 
---
I urge you, this is your problem.

u/nwordcountbot

They don't update on weekends, last I remember.
---
Thank you for the request, comrade.

h377spawn has not said the N-word yet.
---
I'd love to scrap ammo for lead/steel/gunpowder. It would make ammo more exciting to get. As it is now, I have to park my camp on a lead deposit and go ham on super mutants with a deathclaw gauntlet for hours.  Just to be able to use my crappy non legendary homemade rifle at west tec for a crappy 1 star weapon that I trade in for scrip, to then get a 3 star craptastic weapon. A vicious cycle of recycling.
---
YES! THIS! A THOUSAND TIMES THIS!
---
You unfortunately can‚Äôt (unless something recently changed).  It has to be found ‚Äúnaturally‚Äù in desks, safes, etc.  They won‚Äôt trigger the quest if they are bought, or looted from paper bags...
---
Never said you do, but I feel for you on that one
---
Dude I am terrified of underwater, even in video games. I had just convinced myself that the water was safe and clear, ffs
---
Except it wouldn't really disgust me to the degree you'd think it would, or it wouldn't even disgust me at all lol
---
They would need to uncap PVP damage then since no survival =/= no more PVP. A proper critical hit build on black powder weapons was able to one-shot full set users. I've had someone tell me this was impossible before and my evidence is all anecdotal and it is impossible to confirm this nowadays. All I know is, when Survival first game out, I was dropping jumpy boys left and right with a black powder pistol critical headshot.
---
Damn, I'm ps4
---
I did pick the special charisma and then the card. Doesn't make since and it's a lvl 35 character

Then you sir are not a man of your word and I bid thee fare the well

Thank you for this.  I can finally queue up for a match without having my eardrums blasted out by music.
---
Do you know which items? Asking for a friend
---
What is the background on this? I didn't realize Sentinel and Cavalier got netted.
---
Collecting junk, scrapping it, bulking the scrap and selling it to vendor bots. You'll make your 1.4k a day, guaranteed.
---
Is his name his tag?
---
That'd be awesome, go into a nuke zone with Cav armor and be protected, that would be sweet
---
I don't get emotional towards or react to everything I hate, just to make life easier.
---
Why are you booing him, he's right
---
Ha, that's funny because I was once in the same boat. Now whenever WS gets nuked it's more like"...aarrgghh...here we go again". If not for the flux and the once in a blue moon chance at a decent legendary I'd never go into them. I don't find them fun. It's a utility event for farming to me...that's it. I do it as quickly as I can and get out of the  to enjoy the rest of the game exploring and questing. I like the game but honestly I find the events and nuke zones immersion breaking. Stop whatever quesy you're doing and go do this totally irrelevant(nuke zone, UF, Encryptid) thing for 20 minutes then go back to your storyline. I guess if you launched the nuke yourself that's different because that was your quest but otherwise no. I do it though for the same reasons everybody else does - flux, components, and legendaries though more often than not I haven't been bothering except that I just started making flux for the first time. Anyway, I'm done rambling now. Thanks for your input.
---
Just did the event today as well, 2 of the legendaries didn't even spawn
---
Do gilded miniguns still drop?
---
Hard to explain, generally small bushes, small rocks, thin looking trees.
---
Except that on a long enough timeline that is an infinitely guaranteed drop.
---
thanks so much üôè
---
Let me rephrase my question, do you know of any objects, that can ‚Äúbulldoze‚Äù a large tree
---
If youre on xbox ill team up and help you grind up
---
Ah, almost anything, if said tree can be removed.
---
LOL
---
Why are you grinding it?
---
There is a 0.058% chance of getting the Plan: Plasma Grenade, and I need it.
---
To go back to your question.... I never mentioned a ridiculous amount of drive-able/ mounted vehicles.... I did have ideas for upgrading the vehicles similar to how armor/weapons/ mods can be found and upgraded. There could be perks specifically there to address the problem of building and maintaining  a vehicle/mount i.e. (mounted mini-gun, rocket launcher, efficient engines, Stealth Boy Screening, respawn cooldowns, A component/junk locator for materials ‚Äútagged to search‚Äù). 
---
With regards to the vehicles/mounts being overpowered... it doesn‚Äôt make sense to outright rage about vehicles.... because the materials that would need to be gathered to build the entire machine (or to lure the required radscorpion  to the Raiders Pen for example...) would justify itself from the arduous tasks, and/ or quests required to even collect the parts necessary to build/ride/ and maintain one. This doesn‚Äôt even mention the fact that the vehicle/ mount would also need to be maintained with rare components/ammunition/ and fuel to drive/attack with its mounted weapons if they‚Äôre modified onto the vehicle... If that doesn‚Äôt justify a reason for having at least one of these per faction, then how does fast traveling everywhere even fit to a post-apocalyptic genre where survival should be challenging... I understand a limited fast travel option for each player daily, but you miss out on this game completely with it... It‚Äôs basically a non-realistic teleportation device that anyone can use to escape pvp/death/ actually playing this game... 
---
I understand I‚Äôm making this shit long af, but bear with me please. The questing is one difficulty, the cost of parts/schematics is another, but the perks required to pilot/ maintain the vehicle would essentially make the character an engineer role, and although they may seem powerful with the vehicle there will be negatives to the overall combat inefficiency of this engineer/(beast tamer for creatures) type class.. 
---
Essentially what I‚Äôm explaining is once the vehicle or mounted rider is either shot off/ or forced to evacuate the vehicle, then they are an easy picking for any combat aggressive player.  
---
So it seems useless to even include this feature right if it‚Äôs easy to kill, but painstaking to make... wrong! The upgrades that can be attained from questing/ random drops/ etc. can change the vehicle for the open-world/ survival pvp, and make gathering a team to assault/defend against opposing factions much simpler. This new in the sky view would benefit locating enemies, but it would also remove the stupid melee overpowered  players from running up to players and smashing their face back to kingdom come with one hit.  Sniping from a vantage point on a vertibird would also allow other weapons more advantage.
---
One hell of a poop.
---
Might have better luck. Running events like uranium fever and selling whole weapons to the whitesprings train station vendor.
---
Ah, that rare son of a bitch plan
---
I think they just need to expand the mod types they can have.
---
1. You can have different types of handles to increase swing speeds.
---
2. More varieties for the blades/heads of the weapons to add various types of elemental damage.
---
3. Fist weapons can have power armor adaptors, were the mod does not add any damage, but makes them usable with P.A.
---
4. Automatic Melee weapons can have different engines ro reduce their AP cost in vats.
---
The sky is the limit here. It just takes a lil bit of ingenuity.
---
Used to be 100% chance so sent or Cav was always active...when the changed the % it made it so the variance of it procing became pretty pathetic.  I get it, in survival Simone with a full set of assassins/sentinel was Uber annoying, but survival is gone and I‚Äôd like my sentinel PVE set to be de-sucked
---
I can confirm that the Clean Tea Kettle, Mouth Harp, and Pre-war lamp are unobtainable. 
---
You can only get the Triangle as a random drop from the **"Small Toy"** selection in the S.M.A.R.T. Choice Machine (Watoga High School) with a 1:16 chance (~6%).  Fun fact: this is the only item in the game that is exclusively dropped by this machine. It's also [covered in rust](https://i.imgur.com/UoJncGJ.png). Requires Halloween Candy, obtained from the Monster Mash event.
---
The High-Powered Microscope also has only one source: The Whitespring Bunker Science Wing vendors. I just picked one up on my second try. It's perfectly clean, [looks great on display](https://i.imgur.com/KMw6sTY.png)!
---
Good luck!
---
There is a trading sub. There is no trading here.
---
Very good to know, thank you. Put me on the "buff that shit" bandwagon!
---
Can you imagine the fall back and negativity if it wasent rewarded. Two things are happening or will happen. The slider bar is just fake advertisement, or it‚Äôs real hit we will reach the goal refuardless. 
---
This is pure advertisement and hype, trying to bring people together. Imagine if they say we are giving you 50% off. Whoopie. Instead let‚Äôs get the entire community to work together. 
---
Only way this would actually be real, as by example from other games, is if we reach a goal then get the bonus and it repeats. IE every time we kill 10million we get 48 hours 50% off double legendary drops and it keeps repeating.
---
This hasn't been true for me the last few days. I've done numerous horde events and over half didn't spawn a legendary boss.
---
Just found that out. Tks
---
I still haven‚Äôt run into this guy. I‚Äôm not the most prolific player but I still play on and off.
---
My guess is they will sell you small slices of DC for $10 a pop.  
---
https://youtu.be/AMyziQlKAhs
---
Not for me i mean just yesterday i was at west tek a got mobbed by 3 or 4 at one time never seen that many in one place before
---
I‚Äôm a little surprised they don‚Äôt have **MONTHLY** challenges with rewards like that.
---
Instead of atoms at all.  Like, ‚Äúkill 200 scorched = special leather armor skin‚Äù or ‚Äúcook 500 items = special cooking station for camp‚Äù 
---
Have 3 adventure mode challenges, 1 NW challenge, and 1 ‚Äúnew content‚Äù challenge (is vault raid)
---
Hey the can do perk, I've got so much canned coffee I use it for water. Crazy AP regen non stop.
---
Respec dude. Even with main 50 cards, there are still another like 35-50 for auxiliary uses. Max script and items from purveyor. Still participate in events around server to include queen, think if a lvl 15 could do that. All your extra resources and materials. Plans learned.
---
Sucks they jumped the gun so fast on the workaround. Really isnt an excuse at this point to not have planters, not that there ever was.
---
I bet grahm gives better massages than any assaultron lol
---
By not wearing armor you are giving up 15 legendary effects.
---
I don't wear armor for the damage resist, just for the legendary effects.
---
Yea I finally killed my first one about 2 months ago too I think, I was at level 17x ~ 18x.
---
Don't use too much or try to gain caps at your level, caps will come so much easier and with less effort after level 50
---
A flying purple people eater.
---
I think there is a terminal nearby?
---
No worries. I didn't expect you to. I appreciate it from the last time. Lol
---
As a compromise, maybe they should add legendary radiation suits? Or possibly an ‚ÄòArmored Radiation suit‚Äô variant as a midway point between radsuits and power armor? (Like, armored radsuit has a bit less radiation protection in return for better DR or something)
---
That‚Äôs too bad....üòï
---
I would except them to update it in morning Bethesda time. Which is noon for europe but if you are from Asia/Autralia then it would be your evening already.
---
the first time I killed one was in the bog. he was controlling 2 scorchbeasts and their minions.
---
To elaborate more, you need level 50 T51. For the highest resist.
---
Morgantown may be better, but I see WS still nuked fairly often, that not as much.
---
I sell junk, chems and mothman egg omelettes
---
Seriously camp building has become my end game.
---
It‚Äôs happened to me for both encounters. Lucky the last tome it happened I waited it out and got the plans for the fixer. Almost closed the game to reset to a different server.
---
The leveled list was adjusted so that it is no longer obtainable normally.
---
It is still possible to get if the game glitches out(not something you can intentionally do) and gives you an invalid weapon roll(which has happened, but is not something to rely on). Answered by /u/Sergeant_MQZ
---
Someone correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but I‚Äôm pretty sure that ones classified as a public event, so its activation is completely random as of Patch 13. To my knowledge there‚Äôs not really an ‚Äòoptimal‚Äô way to grind it beyond what you‚Äôre already doing until they fix how often public events pop with patch 14, and even that‚Äôs not a guarantee.
---
Honestly I probably would play Fallout with people if I was able to. The community and this sub has been awesome. The headphone jack doesn‚Äôt work on either of my controllers.
---
Battle Bot isn't a public event. A fellow Ash Heap event, Lode Baring, is public, though.
---
Oh yikes that sounded like fun. 
---
You: a couple beasts, should be easy

---
I would love for this to be a thing. I would doubly  love for this to be a thing in camp vending machines...the number of times I've traveled to see a pile of white wolf fedoras instead of armor....
---
I keep telling you he just wanted to visit your Scare-a-torium üòâ
---
bad RNG...I see one every few days.
---
I don‚Äôt farm for legendaries much anymore but the last 3-4 times I‚Äôve hit West Tek I get zero legendaries. My camp is near Harpers Ferry and two almost everytime tho.
---
Really hard to get through on the Xbox. Haven‚Äôt seen a single person with any of the armor yet.
---
Exactly! I want to get a set of it, but I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôll ever be available
---
Exactly. At this point anyone still playing deserves the reward and not giving it would be another bad move to add to the pile
---
It was datamined that there's a 'Secret Service Power Armour' which I assume to be that one, so I reckon there's a chance it could be Enclave related.
---
##SPOILERS
---
They were the main instrument in creating the SBs after all, so it would make sense. Why they aren't at the WS I don't know.
---
They‚Äôre capable of hot fixing now? Didn‚Äôt know they started that
---
Not edit, but build more.
---
Isnt there a terminal in that cell
---
One spawned near my camp near the food processing workshop i tried to kill it
---
Nothing is balanced in this danm game all it is is a bunch of Tesla users because they can't aim don't even get me started with vats that's the worst feature they added nothing is balanced this game is garbage about to go to game stop and get 5 dollars idgaf anymore.
---
Yeah I figured it out. 
---
Its pretty shit of them to have the quick repair kit option come up first though. 
---
I get you guys that played from day one know the drill but someone just stepping in will see the kit option first. (My friend and I both seasoned gamers had it happen like this)
---
Feels like a phone game tactic in all honesty.
---
There is - it doesn‚Äôt do anything for me.
---
I run a medic, so I'm full of stims of all sizes and rad aways, med x, chems, what ever my team could need.
---
Unless they (Bethesda) fixes the time available to complete objectives then no not really. Their are a few people who say they can complete it on expert but they don‚Äôt mention that they rely on luck and have failed it a dozen times because of the lag even after knowing the exact locations of all the keycards.
---
If you think that's bad, you should see the fourteen dollar horsemen power armor skins that don't even change based on what power armor you're wearing.
---
You have to use the terminal. If it's not doing anything, give it a few minutes, sometimes it's lagged.
---
So what was the problem? It may help others if you post your solution.
---
Completely anecdotal: When firing my heavy weapons at large targets the right most side of the bar does not move which would be odd if it were there to show individual contribution. This bar will disappear if I stop hitting the target for a second or if I hit reload. I think it is a player feedback tool to show players that they are indeed making progress at lowering enemy health and how effective the attacks are. **TLDR: I think you are right.**
---
Happens to me literally all the time. It's annoying cause it randomly happens too.
---
Yeah cause it's totally Adventure Mode people that took away your Survival Mode.
---
Fast travelled to a camp looking for ammo and found a level 3 super mutant hacking at the owner's crops. Killed him for a bloodied harpoon. I'm finding legendaries in unusual places lately. Also, a  2* ghoul outside the tattoo parlor coughed up a 2* death claw gauntlet. Maybe same amount of legendaries but spread around.
---
Power attack Is for one-shooting. And it works.
---
I feel like Casual play is the only play style available lol
---
Weird. Sorry i dont remember how to do it. I havent been there since it came out
---
Right? Why do people post this 15 times a day? Play the game, if you hate it, don't keep playing, if you love it, keep playing.
---
Unless I missed a recent fix (which is possible, haven't been keeping track lately), Endangerol is bugged and gives the *target* 75% armor penetration, rather than 25% to the attacker, so it's only useful for shooting at your friends. It doesn't stack.
---
Problem is you don't need power attacks to one shoot normal mobs.
---
I had the respawn countdown jam right near the end of Encryptid. Ended up having to restart the game, so the entire thing was a waste for me. I'm still pissed, because I was getting good shots on the imposter squatch and everything. Lost out on some legendaries from other robots too. I just want the fixer plan, and thanks to these events being so screwy, I know I'll probably end up having to pay a ton of caps for it from some vendor instead.
---
This is basically what I do every day in 76
---
I‚Äôve done it 3 times over the last week and haven‚Äôt gotten any plans...
---
Legendary spawn rates are a delicate balancing act. Player retention rates go down if they're both too generous or too stingy. The ideal spawn rate is one that lets players *feel* like they're making progress by filling daily scrip caps and participating in the item gambling system, but not so frequent that players are able to complete their desired item collections and lose motivation to continue playing.
---
  
---
This requires constant adjustment to keep the numbers optimal.
---
I'll take swing speed over power attack damage pretty  much any day of the week...because swing speed doesn't rely on AP to give you more damage. Power attack is great for a few hits, but then it's useless until your AP pops back up.
---
To be clear - you mean the terminal right as you come in, right? Located to the left of your stash?
---
 0.058% chance equates to 1 every 1700 times, though it is random.
---
Considering there's an entire road missing navmesh in that game still, I'd say ten years is being generous. I understand a little missing navmesh here and there, but a whole ass road?!
---
Now check your challenges... SBQ is one of the ones you got to kill to complete the challenge... BUT... you have to be the one that fires the last shot. If not it shows not complete.
---
I also found one yesterday at one of the whitesprongs entrances
---
Some clothes such as the golf jackets in Whitespring golf club actually worth a lot. Bump up your Charisma and Hard Bargain so that your sell price will be better. Also most of the stuff you loot can sell, including raw fluxes from nuke zones, they are nearly effortless to gather.
---
Hail Hydra!
---
I don‚Äôt think the event has started 1700 times...lol I think I‚Äôve opened every locked item and checked every yellow explosive crate 2-3 times and of course other events as well... crazy!
---
I don't know whether that particular function does anything at all, let alone what counts as a light level of 50, although you could take a guess that the range is 0-100. You'd probably need a PvP test.
---
Yeah, create a new character. It's not an existential crisis.
---
I forgot to say to keep the pipboy light off too
---
Thank you for the answer/reply.
---
Yeah I thought so, but I occasionally game with someone that just won't believe that. If I kill a legendary without letting it re-heal they become irritated at me. 
---
Even when getting three start items from a legendary that I one shot, they argue that the drop was a fluke. *shrug*
---
Anyway, thanks again!
---
Guess I‚Äôm fucked then
---
I did but I found it pretty frustrating to get my character to level the way I wanted. I ended up going back to my main and just grinded out the levels and got to where I wanted in a few days.
---
The only way I'd start a new one again would be if the legendary perks turn out to be amazing or a new mode like a hard core mode that only allows new characters.
---
While that may never happen, I would love to revisit the Capital Wasteland.
---
Yeah Cav makes much better sense. Sent is really moronic. What kind of shooting game let player stand still or do bunny hop and magically becomes invincible.  Why stop there, just make the bullets return to sender and kill those who fired them.
---
Not to sound racist, but this game has a lot of white characters. Probably like 95% white. I maybe saw like 2 black characters and Im at level 95. This also includes NW where you can see all the characters in the lobby. I seriously doubt any person of color saw that vendor but if they did, they should take an in game picture of their camp with them standing next to it looking upset, to get them banned. Remember when those players early on went around looking to mob up on gay people? I wonder if this means the community that plays fallout is mostly white or people wanting to play as white characters?
---
There's also many stories that are really interesting, but can't be found because they're under water. Like recently, I found a note next to a lake that said something like "We don't need [guys name] anymore, kill him (or something)" and that was that. Then, a little later on, I was helping my friend build her camp in the same lake, and what did I find under water in the lake with the note? An skeleton arm, handcuffed to a car engine. About 5-10m away, there was a skeleton with an arm missing and a saw in its free hand
---
Some of the story telling in this game goes a long way, I just wish we wouldn't miss it
---
Only 20,000 atoms
---
almost every other time i load up the game, theres either a mothman or a flatwoods monster INSIDE of my house.
---
Last night I got like 3 Legendaries the first hour of playing.. quad cross bow, quad +1Agi Gauss, and something else I can't remember.
---
That reminds me I need to get rid of my extra frame I was given
---
And I‚Äôm not asking for a full blown DC, parts of it would be great
---
Yes, it is pretty laggy at times. I have had to wait over a minute to have it show anything but a blank screen.
---
I don't think we'll get any halloween items in the atomic shop until the next update, which they still haven't announced. I'm assuming it'll be like the 22nd
---
Thanks erryone!
---
Don‚Äôt worry, everyone else knew what you meant
---
I defended red rocket from 4 waves of ghoulds and got 4 or 5 legendary s in them so i think you were just unlucky
---
I‚Äôm going to start a new one once Wastelanders goes live.
---
Yes.
---
There are set random encounter locations on the map that draw from a list of predetermined spawns.
---
So some places on the map you have a higher probably finding him.
---
I used studded deep pocketed heavy leather... best non-PA energy defense, and it‚Äôs super light... Now I run heavy BOS deep pocketed combat armor
---
Sometimes when Im not prepared for a fight I want to fast travel away. Sure, it tells you dont crouch or run on xbox by pressing down the d pad on either the left or the right. For the record I have fast travelled while walking around. But the fast travel option will cancel immediately once you get hit. Sometimes I don't want to grind a fight out.
---
I never farm legendaries i farm steel and plastic the legendaries are a bonus
---
Is this only available for PC?
---
There are perks and mods that mitigate this.
---
Oh shit I wish I had that
---
If you're on ps4 and see headless scorched all over the forest...It's me going guns blazing on them.
---
I want a new survival to start a new character. It should be mandatory.
---
i live up on the mountain above site bravo. crazy place up there
---
I still do pvp with regular guns. When the fights turn into this I bail. It seems a decent amount of times people don't fight this way until you pop a stealth boy, then they pop one, and the Tesla comes out. I just don't like it so I don't participate but I pvp on a smaller scale anways.
---
Fixer, Bear Arm, Sheepaquatch Club and Sheepsquatch Staff actually.
---
What are you talking about I'm asking about those drinks specifically?
---
Not only an apparel tab but a means (scrapping?) to make clothing items once you find them.  Make it to where the item if found in the world can be traded, but if you craft it‚Äôs like a backpack or atom shop item and you can‚Äôt sell or trade.
---
This would allow us to clear up item bloat in our stashes and simply make things as we desire.  Less stash items = better server performance as we have been told many times.
---
They were giving me Badges 3 days ago. I got one for each of the dailies. Haven't run Campfire Tales in a while, so I can't speak to that.
---
Well I suppose it was going to happen eventually.
---
All sorts of things to do....
---
Go back and complete the side (or main) missions you havent yet done.
---
(Ive done several queens but havent completed firebreathers)
---
Explore places you havent. 
---
Do events you havent done
---
Collect all the bobbleheads
---
Hunt for hard to find outfits, plans or recipient
---
Find a low level and help them out
---
Etc
---
You agreed to the mechanic when you took the workshop. 
---
Would I like for there to be an option for us to give up workshops without dying when others contest workshops we've claimed? Most definitely. 
---
However, if you're going to kill me at my workshop, I want you to take the workshop. What I don't want is for you to be a much higher level than me, kill me, take what ever little loot I scrounged up around the workshop to build unlocked extractors for everyone, and then leave without taking the workshop. 
---
Seal clubbing isn't cool, but neither is complaining about people properly using an in game mechanic by taking your workshop after they shoot you. That's like getting offended that someone picked up a teddy bear and scrapped it before you got the chance to pick up the teddy bear and scrap it.
---
It depends. My unarmed ninja Is not bloodied, and I use executioner faster swing knuckles at full health and decent DR/ER (450-450). Even when dying has no consequences, I don't like it happening for RP reasons and I need power attacks for those nasty glowing Yao guai. Problem Is, Deathclaw gauntlets look ridiculous, really.
---
They definitely could make the area across the river in the forest a playable area. Also vault 51s area.
---
Maybe we could explore Tacoma and deeper parts of DC as it wasn‚Äôt exploitable in F3
---
Check out in the hallway before timer runs out, sometimes..
---
But OP is showing a bloodied one.
---
Wut
---
Did you have any proof? Otherwise there‚Äôs not much to be done
---
He isn't cheating he just has a very powerful build.
---
I got a badge from dailies just yesterday but it seems to be a very low drop chance.
---
Nice job it looks really cool.
---
Not easy when he kills everything in 3 seconds and fast travels away
---
Haha
---
You can still earn them but I believe you no longer receive the notification for doing so when you get one for completing any related event.
---
Or running a sneak commando with a instigating weapon
---
Uh......yeah, you could take a few pellets from a buckshot as long as they aren't grouped.....or in the head or heart and a doctor could fix you right up.......well, I guess it could hit your neck and It could be bad too.
---
I know how this game plays and I know that he's cheating. You just have to see it for yourself
---
He was using a non explosive flamethrower. I doubt it reaches 200 yards
---
I‚Äôm just trying to say that there‚Äôs nothing in it for them, why take extra time to verify a claim that might not even be true
---
This has been happening to me alot. Also when i click on something to fast travel, it just exits outta the map and does nothing.. usually happens twice before it actually sends me off on fast travel.. so irritating
---
Pretty much this
---
&gt; went around looking to mob up on gay people 
---
Is that so? I need to put up a pro-trans sign at my CAMP. Fuck bigots.
---
The item you get from the Beast is the same as it would be for any random legendary. I think you should of gotten a new building plan from the quest. That was the real reward.
---
Old fisherman hat maybe. Ushaka or beer hat also.  Not sure if you are looking for something darkish something kinda fits the motiff or what. Trappers is a hard set to make look good all around, Bos officer under armor over the marine wetsuit for sure. Thinking on it the old fisherman hat from whitesprings would fit well
---
Some quests it does. This one it does not. There's only one 'complete' condition and one set of rewards. Answered by /u/Gilpo1
---
**Positives**  
---
* Total programmer billable hours: 0  
---
* Total artist billable hours: &lt;1 (Asset re-texture, icon jpg)  
---
* Total intern billable hours: &lt;1 (Goal chart updates)  
---
* Total hours users engaged: A lot
---
**Negatives**  
---
* Some users unhappy with arbitrary goal, lack of new content.
---
Happy cake day!
---
I have seen an increased amount of flatwoods monsters, and have also seen an increase in posts about them being sighted. I wonder if Beth turned up their spawn rate. Very cool tho! They‚Äôre fun and challenging to take on! üòÑü¶ÑüëΩüòà
---
I just want underwater monsters. I actually don't because that shit scares me, but I do want them because it's scary. My logic be damned.
---
Here is a secret there is always one in a desk in the military wing of whitespring bunker. Only loot one even if you see say 4 just fast travel and turn those 4 in, then you can server hop and there will be more in the desks but not in the 4 you looted before within the bunker you can find a total of 23 tech data.
---
Yes probably. I read an article one time about a small group of friends teamed up and put their mics on Area, they then went around harassing people calling themselves the homo hunters and asking if people were gay and attacking them. They were perm banned. If you report it he will likely get perm banned too.
---
Go way up northeast in the mire. Start at the house of scares work your way north and east. Theres some water up there and other cool spots. No islands that i remember. I looked in the past but never found much. Though i once saw someone built their camp in the middle of the lake by that power station. Idk how they did it.
---
A recent patch made them rarer.
---
Playing Solo is tough! You get some really sweaty teams sometimes. I usally have team fill on.
---
I 1 shot everything in there lol, it's not cheating, it's a bloody build.
---
Theres a boat in the lake you can use to place your camp then you carefully place 1 foundation at the right height so you can put down a staircase leading just upto the surface of the water, then you build your actual foundation with upper floors on the surface of the water and viola, its a nice spot but doing a town is already hard enough on a budget let alone having to make your entire towns barge that it sits on. Its an idea tho and ill keep it in mind because it does sound cool, a barge town right by the station.
---
Lmfao, i guarantee anybody who is role playing a racist is racist themselves. Nobody who isnt just decides "yep, today im gonna call people the n word online, because im role playing a racist, but im not actually" its not about being pc, its about deterring racist people
---
The laser and Ultracite laser plans are random spawns (well at least I found them that way) wherever you can find plans out in the open.
---
Where are those suits of power armor you've been talking about?
---
Yeah. They don't update it on the weekends.
---
Kill everything, pick up everything, don't fast travel unless it's for free. Super mutants are especially lucrative prey.
---
Rip
---
Relax, this is just a game.  If we are gonna nitpick technical and gross inaccuracies, we'll be here for the next decade.
---
you mean the advance connector plans or what switch plan you are talking about. trying to understand so I can better help you thats all.
---
If you are talking about the Fandom one, you just sign up. The way it is formated is a little weird but it is really easy to find a similar page, copy the format, paste into the new article, and fill in. Though I did find it a little frustrating that some people can just be assholes about edits...
---
With the giant mask and that awful green camo PA paint I was thinking supermutant.
---
That did the trick - thanks!
---
There was, and there was a lot of cool stuff under water.
---
You are entirely incorrect here. ALL Anti armor perks stack. there is no max cap but they are multiplicative not additive meaning that if you have tank killer which is 12% and the legendary effect which is 50% you end up with 50 \* 1.12 =  56 % armor pen instead of 62. ALSO Awareness has been known to be broken since they released the fix for anti armor on energy weapons. where is your actual evidence to back this up? why not try taking a weapon with and without the mod on your armor and seeing if it does different amounts of damage instead of trying to use awareness.
---
well im just waiting for wastelander at this point, just login to cleam free stuff in atom shop
---
armor pen is working. awareness is not. see my comment above on how armor pen is calculated
---
What system are you on?
---
Exactly. But image the chaos if everyone submitted a ticket for every high value item they lost!!!
---
Military Cap ftw if you like it clean. I currently wear trapper chests with Medical Goggles, Prisoner Collar and the raider eye patch (atomic shop) for a pretty unique/badassed 'Borg' look ;)
---
This also works with displays too. 
---
I discovered this by accident after I moved camp once. I managed to place my entire camp back down on my new spot, to find I didnt need to restock anything.
---
The machines can be on a foundation as well, providing said foundations are separate to the rest so get blueprinted separately. Handy for wall displays as you can build a wall on a foundation and put the wall displays on that.
---
Your better of just scraping supermutant ones of you trying for mods, atleast for the laser mods. For the laser gun plan you need to do the prison event, cant remember which one its called.
---
For Ultracite laser gun plan you can buy from Phoenix at Wartoga.
---
Well, I presume you know that you have to build your own extractor, so you're really asking for acid locations? I suggest you check out any of the online FO76 maps that allow you to see them all. There are heaps to choose from but the one in the far North of the forest might be best for beginners.
---
When I started, back in beta. I did the first few quests for the responders, up to the fire eaters quest, and then explored the forest and a bit of the toxic valley, for the next 25-35 levels! I took the gorge workshop daily and that can give you a lot of "cheap" experience with the defend events and a lot of really good materials,  both to use and to sell. The Gorge has a junk nose and a Black titanium node for excavators and you'll need that black titanium when you do the Miner Miracles quest.  The problem nowadays is that workshops can become magnets for people wanting to PVP, but few of them bother with the Gorge. It's also within easy walking distance to Morgantown for the rail station, airport and the rail yard, (another2  places to get experience quick!) And also to Flatwoods. It also has easy access to water and food. 
---
I played mostly solo for my first 60-70 levels but I'd highly recommend finding a couple people near your level and see if they'd like to try teaming up. I, personally,  had never played a multiplayer game before so I didn't realize how much better the game could be with a group!it does make doing some of the quests a bit longer because of the need for everyone to read through notes and terminals, so maybe quest solo and explore/do events with a group. 
---
Finally,  I say this with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight,  don't be in a hurry to level up and compete quests. Take your time. Read everything! EXPLORE! There are at least as many unmarked locations as marked ones.  Get off the beaten path and go see what there is to see...also don't use fast travel unless you have to,  you'll be amazed at all the things you come across in those blank areas on the map. 
---
Hope this helps you some! If you are on PC friend me, I can give you a boost of healing items and maybe some weapons and armor. IGN=The_zimmers
---
Nah, they‚Äôve been a little shaky tonight....I haven‚Äôt had problems in a long time with them
---
Good looking out, thanks for the heads up!
---
I've been beating the Pitt drum for months now. I'd love to have the northwest portion of the map expanded so that we get the Pitt as a major high-level city in the north. Ideally this would take place just as the city starts succumbing to the mutagenic disease that creates the wildmen, the trogs, and the nameless horrors that were destroyed by the Brotherhood.
---
In the process, I'd also like to see the northern panhandle of West Virginia get some love too. But that's mainly because that's my hometown area.
---
I removed mine months ago. No need.
---
Propably as the Silver Shroud and/or the Mistress of Mystery.
---
You really need the stealth to make this work. If you want to run and gun, a bloodied build would be better. Like I said, bloodied is about 3.24x your damage at 19% with all the required perks and mutations. It won't do as much as stealth vats in ideal situations, but it would fare better when detected or during group events.
---
Lol a few friends and I call ourselves the Wasteland Witches. We all wear the tattered dress, witch hat, and gas mask with goggles.
---
I got tired of looking for them when there's an atom challenge so i just left queen of the hunt incomplete on one of my alts. 4 or 5 server hops usually gets it.
---
Try server hopping, someone with high level must have been there before
---
Yes we got 2 days of old data but on average we kill 2.1 million scorched a Day
---
He killed the entire area, multiple enemies, with a single shot? Likely a hacker. Bethesda, to my knowledge, has only ever banned mass dupers once thus far. The hackers would be the obvious next target, but I've lost enough faith to not hold my breath.
---
I'm down if and only if they are free.
---
There's a small "island" in the central Cranberry Bog with a road, an intact and a collapsed bridge connecting to it. It also has a silver vein.
---
It's just a little bit west of Bog Town, if you follow the road from there to the Ranger Office.
---
Who gives a f*ck
---
Maintaining a half chub while it downloads and installs.
---
I'm kidding btw. Got a **full** chub going during install.
---
Are you on pc?
---
My group of friends left the game because of the stash limit. We will come back when its reasonably set.
---
Most likely a nurse. It‚Äôs been my favorite outfit recently.
---
Try subnautica
---
What if it was a nice place and the asshole slavers and all the environmental problems are OUR fault?
---
Which is really sad
---
That could be a possibility that the slavers originated from West Virginia. but there's not alot of evidence to back that case up. It will be interesting to see if Beth actually decides to go there with 76
---
There is no discount tho
---
Got 20 k for mine
---
That's nothing - imagine chaos when people start submitting ticket for items they've never have and want's them to be "restored"...
---
rofl
---
Same, except mine got scorched and people would either go "WOW" or "haha shame"
---
This is the one. Good on ya
---
One of my characters is level 100 and I haven‚Äôt even done the first responder mission. 
---
It helps to have another high level with you to watch your back and to help conserve ammo. (This works the fastest hands down) 
---
Otherwise you just have to keep grinding whatever level enemies you can,do events, participate in nuke zones, etc. 
---
Get well rested(5% exp bonus), participate in the mothman lighthouse event(5% exp bonus), create cranberry recipes(additional exp 2-5%), and do the feed the people event. It gives you canned meat stew (5% exp bonus). Also you can get perk card inspirational which grants 15% bonus xp if maxed.  This can net about 30-35% extra exp if you are lucky and events pop up
---
Dogs other than that one exist?
---
Meet Mr House.
---
Where'd my ding dong go?ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I still use shotguns to blast the heads off of creatures, that's still pretty entertaining
---
I bought ultracite laser plans from watoga two days ago 
---
Most mod plans are sold through vendor as well.
---
Should've tracked him down and shot him, like vermin
---
Apparently you have to jump on top of the locomotive to activate the whistle, which doesn't seem possible without a jet pack or Marsupial.
---
They can‚Äôt restore weapons. But they can restore from a backup they do.  So you will be given a new copy of your character from ‚Äúx‚Äù days ago when they last did a backup. So you might end up losing other stuff just to get back what was lost. 
---
There was a huge post on this a couple weeks ago. I‚Äôll try and find it.
---
I got nole miner bloodied with power attack damage and 1 agility it rocks
---
people asking questions like that just want to hear your opinions about the game 
---
no need to get triggered
---
Do some events and explore the forest, ash heap, and toxic valley fully before you try venturing farther east.
---
Yeah, I'm leaning toward a 2020 delay as well. If they really wanted to bank on Wastelanders being the game's 2nd chance to people, they'd make another trailer with an actual listed date to hype it up. I just really hope there's enough to do. Not just a 3 hour story, then its back to farming legendaries and SBQ.
---
It's definitely worse lately more frequent and frustrating when your trying to go to an event on the opposite side of the map.
---
Try modus, vender bot Phoenix, mall vendor, and vendor bot chad.
---
Idk but cant you get a decommissioned mini nuke all taken apart, or am I thinking of FO4
---
PS4
---
That would be awesome if so. I'm trying for a church of atom build. A bit difficult as there is precious little in the way of radiation themed plans and atom shop items thus far.
---
Don't ever go in the sea in Fo4 then. Some definitely spooky shit there.
---
Left 4 dead felt like one of those games that had realistic shotgun damage. Shred zombies apart.
---
Nope.  Only three of us in there, for the supervisors we all down gunned sp everyone gor several hits in but nothing dropped besides the basic junk on them.
---

Friggin annoying when your trying to shop around the map at peoples camps.
---
Apparently so, I've heard of them but haven't found one myself. I have found random spawn, tamable cats though. Also very rare to run into in my experience.
---
Yes I got one on both Campfire Tales and Stings and Thing yesterday, it was a good day.
---
Yeah, I guess the majority of the dogs left in Appalachia have been turned into mongrels
---
It's doable, it's a run and jump from the carriage, they even give you a little ramp
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Both myself and the wife have done it without jet pack or Marsupial.
---
Idk I like exclusivity of it, yeah it kinda suck when you've got shitty rolls that you can't do anything with. But it's nice to know who actually done them
---
Thus far is the right idea man
---
I imagine it is hard not going feral when all the humans turned into scorch-jerks.
---
Just press 'Sort' three times. This will get you PA on the top, then armor, backpack, then outfits.
---
Rename your favorite armor with '*' in the befinning to have this appear on top
---
Same here, I had switched accounts a while back (already lvl 17 woo!) and had no disconnects, old play through I disconnected every hour, good to see the game has improved a lot though.
---
Same, though I binned them.....
---
Is this game co op?

The char deletion glitch has been fixed. And it was under very specific cercunstanses that were hard to recreate.

My crews been running the raids since they dropped with no issues. We've slowed down a lot now since we've all got out set.
---
I've seen 2 people outside of our group with the armor, on xb1
---
I feel you on this, I did a messenger event in the divide last night and rocked up on a legendary mutant hound, and when arriving at the destination (mountainside hotel) found a 3* ghoul inside. Next I did a bloat fly horde in ash heap and out of the horde of 4 (!) Flies, two of them were legendary!
---
I think anyone who has played since beta can attest to the fact that legendaries don't drop like they once did and have really dropped off since patch 10. I feel what they have done lately to change the events and a lot of other stuff is simply to slow progress for wastelanders. Maybe not to be spiteful but clearly they are going for a re-release and this will keep a lot of the rarest and most desirable items from being farmed continuously. Just my opinion but I may be slighted as I miss playing 5-10hrs a day with real purpose before the events became all but non existent and legendaries stopped dropping from no star enemies. This game has changed, whitesprings/nuke zones were so exciting 6-12 months ago.
---
Yes but, as far as I know, they can't delete stuff you've build so if you max your building budget they can't mess around with it.
---
Where are you getting the other things you need to turn the raw flux into stable flux? That‚Äôs my issue. I can explore and pick a lot but I‚Äôm getting hardly any of the high radiation fluid and no hardened mass at all. I thought that stuff was dropped by enemies you kill but they don‚Äôt seem to drop for me. Any advice?
---
I want a new state, with a map size like WV. But I want it heavily destroyed by bombs. I want there dead flora, like Toxic Waste region and desert. I want there NPC and settlements completely degraded to barbaric like Arroyo. I want to feel again as the guy in power armor making his way through the remnants of civilization in the prehistoric world.
---
I want the orange pipboy back and a cauldron cooking station.
---
lvl 42 here, i was minding my vendor -adding cheap modded lvl 5-10 weapons and armour- and some lvl 150+ walked in and dropped many different plans, very useful and im grateful for that 
---
as if i was playing new vegas with a lot of karma
---
There is a trick tho that some people can pull on you. 
---
Somebody invites you who has another friend on the same server that isn't teamed up with him. If you accept he agrees to combat with said friend and because you are on his team you are now in PvP with this other player(s). Now he can freely destroy your camp...
---
That is very likely the case though, as so many items expire tomorrow
---
Good job
---
Here's what the actual model looks like: https://youtu.be/otxKe1CXOmE
---
There's also a question of what you're use case is.  Killing one or two tough mobs? Power's awesome. Killing a small army of not so tough mobs? Swing speed is awesome.
---
Ah, cool catch.
---
Adding friends from in-game doesn't wok, at least for me, only from the start game menu...
---
&gt;The supervisors at Uranium Fever put me in instant danger the moment they appear. Same with Primal Cuts. I was in danger as long as anything was alive. It‚Äôs like stealth was disabled.
---
I've expereienced this as well, in these situations I've just assumed that "No Stealth Kills allowed" which is annoying when you need \[HIDDEN\] up so you can heal.
---
No your not listening basically:You don't have any proof to backup your statement therefore its null and void. Unless you can provide proof to back it up like a video but if you dont then there is nothing you can do. Anyone can jump on this sub and say x, y, and z about somone happens all the time. And most of the time when somone posts oh this user is a scammer and a cheater they have no proof and end up being the scammer/cheater themselves. Unless you can provide proof then no one will listen no offence but if we take everybody's word for everything we'd all be banned at this stage.
---
How did you know where to align the initial floor piece so that the others wouldnt collide with the tree?
---
90% reduced weight? You got yourself a bone from someone with osteoporosis.
---
I think there are alot more than only three house camps.
---
You welcome :)
---
Restoring all of Charleston or Watoga to a habitable state would be a great idea for a future campaign or new questline. Enemy spawns could be adjusted to prevent them from appearing in the city, it could be a free fast travel point and be a "home" for every faction's vendors and some such.
---
It only glitches out like that if you kill it and/or its minions before it completes its first "closing" animation. After it opens back up, then you can unload on it.
---
Oh you would love r/thalassophobia . Subnautica is a game you would love as well
---
Well, they already sold a chrome minigun for $$$ so
---
The Sneak benefit from the Garb of Mysteries + Eve of Ra is it a Legendary effect?
---
What platform are you on? While I unfortunately can‚Äôt make you memorialized in game other players can keep you immortalized in their memories with fun raids and good times!
---
Dude, we are all specks of dust. Every one of us.
---
Whether we have kids or don't have kids, we're all forgotten. We all die two deaths and that happens whether you die young or old or inbetween.
---
I'm sorry you're facing your own mortality. It must be terrifying at your age.
---
We all matter but really none of matter.
---
Is this a piss poor troll? This feels like a piss poor troll.
---
Glad to hear you‚Äôre enjoying it, I‚Äôve been playing since beta...being a West Virginian AND a Fallout fan, I‚Äôve stuck through the bad bc it‚Äôs well worth it. I love it.
---
In case this post isnt an attention whoring lie like usually, I'd say contact Bethesda, but dont say it directly that you want to be immortalised in their video game, just sounds cheesy and demanding, and hardly believable. Only mention your illness on a sidenote.
---
Thanks this will be really helpful!
---
You have to go to the enclave bunker at Whitesprings, there is a computer where you can search for the officers and  a nuclear keycard
---
I still remember when two handed wa so damn so i never even used a gun
---
The places you listed in your rotation are EXP farms, not Legendary farms.
---
Servers can be "lucky" and "unlucky", its been proven by a few times that some servers give nonstop legendaries and some dont. You probably found an unlucky server.
---
This is my legendary farming rotation: https://i.imgur.com/6ASo0tF.jpg
---
these are random encounters where its 2 groups of monsters meeting and fighting each other, like super mutants and gulpers, or scorched and a sheepsquatch, or a deathclaw and a bunch of ants, etc etc etc. I will find a legendary at nearly every single hop, NAR repair yard and Creekside sundew grove being my favorites.
---
You can add this map (and many others) to your game on pc with https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/313
---
They added 2 quests and 1 gun in 1 year. How many decades to actually expand the map?
---
Pip Boy / Junk Tab /  Component View / Tag for Search 
---
(tag rare components and ones you are looking for at the moment)
---
you'll then get a magnifying glass symbol on junk items that contain a component you're looking for
---
Yeah but to make it in your C.A.M.P
---
Sounds like motion blur is on high
---
Hah! I never liked bloodied, I never liked VATS and I never liked PvP. Once I tried all three i don‚Äôt want to do anything else anymore! I miss survival mode :(
---
"Hate speech is violence!"
---
*proceeds to threaten irl violence*
---
You cowards are all the same.
---
Good to know that. Thanks!
---
Take workshops build a workbench, stashbox and fast travel mat skip defend event come back for the retake event. Get 5 or 6 on the left side of the map. Don't stick around long to minimize griefing leave the powerplant and packaged food alone explore in between retake events.Take advantage of all XP and intelligence boosts. I did this straight out of the vault on my last toon got to level 42 over a weekend got killed 4 times.
---
I didn't even think to look.
---
i would recommend taking a spare keycard when going to launch a nuke as it's easy to hit the wrong number
---
Try turning depth of field off.
---
My two characters are 140 and 170. I can count the number of legendary scorched I've seen on my hands and tell you where I killed most of them. (Big Bend, Morgantown Airport, Harper's Ferry, Lewis &amp; Sons Farm Supply, Sunnytop Base Camp, etc)
---
Idk I like it, it adds some randomness to the game. I dont like everything to be predictable because it just sucks the fun out of it for me.
---
Lol it‚Äôs like arguing with a child. Stay blissful my friend and irrelevant.
---
The event isn‚Äôt real. Bethesda doesn‚Äôt care how many Scorched are actually killed, they‚Äôre gonna say the community met the quota at the last minute all for hype and showmanship. Everyone could stop killing Scorched right now and we would still get the reward, because we were always gonna.
---
One thing I wanted to do, but haven't due to not wanting people getting super frustrated by seeing massive piles of armor, is gather the gear you  need for daily challenges and list em for like 5 caps. 
---
But no, I'm not doing that, because I don't want to over-inflate the six-eight actual armor items I have on display with a pile of fishermen outfits and bathrobes.
---
So do we... we should breed and have baby companions... and have them breatsfeed.... this game cant even handle 4 events on the map and you want breeding technics...
---
Only small trees and shrubs/bushes can be "bulldozed" by placing any CAMP item in its place. Large trees on the other hand are immovable.
---
I'd buy the s*** out of music if they released some. Damn it...why aren't mods available for consoles?!?!?
---
Some of us at least :)
---
They managed a brewing station, scavenger bots etc. I don't see this as more technical than another kind of crafting system really.
---
Oh no, I use bloodied explosive lever action which does around 4.7k in sneak to head of the super muties, pls dont report me for using a bloodied build :(
---
I ran around in the garb of mystery for a long time till I found a full set of legendary weightless armour. But I play a full stealth sniper, never used the weapons. Be prepared to die a lot. Otherwise the build looks good for role play.
---
that sounds so wild. how is it not set to update automatically, do we even know if we made it to the last milestone?
---
its the first place I check and I get a 1* sheepsquach or better about 50% of the time.
---
There has been a LOT more scorched spawns at locations lately too, I assume they did this to "help" us.. Blackwater Mine had Scorched Mole Miners and I have never seen that in almost 2k hours. I'm sure we will beat it...
---
Nah
---
Would make trades more safe cuz of right now we are using courier we need safer methods
---
Do you mean flatwoods?
---
That makes more sense lol
---
It will NOT work with the small backpack, its for the backpack you get after completing the order of tadpole quest.
---
Awesome
---
What the fuck are you on here for then
---
the better questions is, why you know claiming a workshop?
---
you know someone will try you after you claim it, now even more so than before. you are putting yourself on that position no one else.
---
Not updating the bar over the weekends is pretty lazy stuff. It's kinda hard to get enthused by these challenges if you can't keep up with the progress.
---
Oh damn :( Same here, but I at least have about 5 years to live and instead of Fallout, I more wish to get myself immortalized into TES6 and I'm afraid I will never see that game at this rate
---
I agree, unfortunately theres no difficulty setting and one-shotting everything gets so boring. Clocking up 800 hours and having some of the best weapons in the game I dont have anything better to do, because in Adventure mode theres not much enemies who stand a chance against an endgame player. It would be amazing if they added a separate server for at least level 100+ players, where mobs would be much more tankier thus yielding a little more exp bonus for killing them (lets say level 100 TANKY  mobs which cant be one shotted). Because going on another Whitespring run and finding level 10 ghouls because a new player was in the area before, is a turn down for me...  and yes I've completed all raid missions on expert, mobs there are just repetetive bullet sponges with 2exp per kill and are not a main focus of the raid.
---
To be honest, you're a toxic garbage person if you reported someone for having a bloodied build that you didn't understand.
---
Spawn rates seem ok. Just getting fed up of 3* enemies dropping 1* trash all the time.
---
Lol, i know I seek for fusion cores, I don't have many power armour related perks
---
4 Ballistic Bach, 4 High Volt Hefee, 1 Rad Ant Lager, and 1 Nukashine...its Nukashine Roulette.
---
I bought mine for 13k back in summer but now I've seen people offering up to 25k for it so it went higher in price it seems (Im on PC)
---
Bump. BGS restore this man
---
I mean u could just have it to where u kill a frog u shove its dropped egg into a reskinned fermenter and 30 mins later u have a new pet
---
Bruh I don't have 1000 scrip either that's why I said "if" but I easily turn in 150 a day...you with only 300 since last week are my friend a casual and not in between lol...but my point is yes it's a reward to be able to turn in 2√ó as much scrip but the part that bugs me is that it's still capped...we should want unlimited for that amount of time...rant done
---
*Nihilism intensifies*
---
&gt; ~~nasty~~ views that aren't my own
---
Naughty words on the internet can't hurt you, buddy. Also, I don't condone unpleasant, yet completely harmless, behaviour but I will defend a person's right to partake until the day I die.
---
No way they would do this unfortunately. Got a keep them for the atom shop so they can charge 8 bucks a pop
---
Beer and 1 Nukashine....
---
You can also tame rats, possums, and non fertizer producing brahmin, and wolves. They are low level and can die easily but they are fun if you can keep them indoors.
---
I ventured into the Mire for the first time yesterday...at L26. 
---
Killed my 2nd wendigo ever (encountered and killed my first ever...without dying,too...the day before). Ran into and killed my first hermit crab right after...and now I‚Äôm terrified of wrecked vans. Came out of a bunker to the sight of a Legendary Toxic Sheepsquatch (my first sighting ever) and realized I did almost NO damage to him, so I baited him into fighting the super mutants at the dam so I could sneak by. Was on my way to the next bunker and what do I see off to my left?
---
The Flatwoods Monster.
---
My immediate reaction was ‚ÄúOH FUCKING REALLY?!? COME ON!!!‚Äù
---
Also, fuck the Mire. *ugh*
---
i cant believe we are still talking about this subject, it has been the same since day 1. the more a location is religiously farmed by the community as a whole, the spawn rates for legendary enemies are decreased.
---
nice! i always need gears 
---
saved post
---
Join market76 discord, there are always people looking to group up for raids! They can also teach you a bit in the process. All it takes is a adding some friends and start doing it together :)
---
And character deletion is a myth, Ive been running raids since they launched, havent had any issues
---
I love 4 so I don't mean this negativity but it felt like it tried to get rid of the campiness inherent in the franchise
---
My 300+ hours says I'm a little more than a casual. I just don't go into dedicated hunts for legendaries. Most don't hence why turning in double the 150 scrip as a reward instead of the 50% price from the Purveyor is nowhere near as appealing to most people.
---
Either a Furious or a Two Shot Explosive 50 Cal MG would be beautiful, if such things exist.
---
If you think it's just a "naughty word", I suggest you go and look up the history of the word....
---
But hey, if you're not just another edge lord hiding behind a keyboard, go tell the next group of black dudes you see that it's just a naughty word and see what they think.
---
Oh yeah, permaban the players instead of fixing the exploit. Ironically you're the one who's toxic. Not that I kill people with nuka mines, but you might want to think about what you're saying.
---
same here so whats the point of discount at the purveyor when noone has any scrip?Balance it out bethesda or you're going to lose players..this along with the grafton mayor audio glitch are annoying
---
Can't be Flatwood monster I just killed him lol
---
Was there humor in 4? I always feel that Beth's Fallout's are little less humorous than the others. And if Beth Austin(BattleCry Studios) has a big part of the development of this game, then maybe it's Battlecry's humor.
---
Totally agree, being able to scrap ammo would be a great benefit, maybe being introduced as a perk card rather than something everyone can do so melee build don‚Äôt benefit too much.
---
I'm not here to argue or go back and forth but you do know there are people out there with close to 3000 hours played right? Myself I have over 1000 soooooo from where I sit....yeah
---
There was actually a lot of humor in 4,it just wasn‚Äôt that typical fallout campiness. 3 on the other hand had that campiness
---
There's a difference between being an insensitive punk playing a videogame and verbally harassing people in person.
---
Pumpkins and a little bathtub with water to grow tarberries
---
Oh Flatwoods, I've only seen him twice, once when building my CAMP up in Whitesprings then again at my friend's CAMP but the 2nd time I discovered he doesn't actually despawn he went invisible (his health bar was still at the top) so I hit him and he reappeared and I killed him, 1st time I sniped him and he disappeared I legit shat myself lol I'd never seen him before so I wasn't as to what to expect but eventually I realised he was gone
---
now the Mothman the litte fucker has been stalking me since I was level 3!! I first saw him as I turned around to see him disappear which obviously was unsettling as that was the 1st time, found out it was Mothman when I came across a CAMP that had the Mothman statue, I faced him again at level 23 at Whitesprings and after a grueling battle, I won, then again at level 33 nearby the Top of the World, near the Junk pile, won that as well, barely, then again at level 43 while doing a random quest then never saw him again, was expecting him at level 53 ngl lol but during all of that, I was interested in the Mothman, why he stalked me a lot so throughout all of that I obviously went to the Museum and learnt more about him and what he does and to this date since turning level 53, I'm level 62, I've not seen either Mothman nor Flatwoods monster
---
Yes! And cranberries for Thanksgiving too!
---
Maybe there was. I liked 4, but for some reason I wasn't totally sucked into it like with other Fallouts. It's probably because I had a little baby who ruined the game for me.
---
So I can't remember much of it and I only finished one of it's DLC's(and I am ashamed of this).
---
Thanks for this AMA, tons of useful info here. Hopefully someone compiles it somwhere
---
Yeah me too, do you guys use weight reduction perks? I have some feeling that it is a bug related to them. It sometimes think you are overencumbered, but are not because of the perks. Not tested it, but my son never has the problem and uses non of these perks.
---
Is there a way I as a level 30 could help. I know I can't really do much but dont really understand the event I guess.
---
What's your time zone?
---
I suppose that high dr comes from a bolstering set? try switching some pieces to unyelding, get +3 str each which means 15% extra damage every piece you use
---
SAME, if this actually happens I will scream so hard
---
He's come to give you that finger ONO!
---
We've all had this bug for months. About same time as the ammo bug. FUCK Bethesda.
---
Well they won‚Äôt be free that‚Äôs why you save up atoms you‚Äôve earnt for things you want. Not ideal but that‚Äôs how it is.
---
The Charleston Fire Department has a ton of weights.
---
If they became tradable, some people would hyperspecialise in the raids and would became sellers of those, the majority of the people who knew when their character outgrows the armor they can give it to friends would have more incentive, the lazy bums such as me would try to buy it, and I guess there are some dupers out there who came up with ways to dupe and sell those, and right now the prices are absurd, giving the black market good money - nontradeable equipment that is not implants is stupid and immersion breaking
---
I figured I‚Äôd be a lone wanderer.
---
By chopiness you mean like screen tearing? Cause it might be a V-Sync issue then. also can be a motion blur related. All settings can be edited in fallout76.ini file in documents folder, look up in google for more info, there are plenty of videos explaining all parameters there.
---
If you're on PC tho, there's an easier route - download Fo76 Mod Manager, open it and untick boxes for Depth of field, Motion Blur, V-Sync settings are also there so play around with it a little
---
I feel sorry for the poor bastard...but at the same time...yeah I don't want to play...hurts my head everytime we play
---
Definite RNG. Did census violence by statehouse, had 3 and that's a small event. 
---
If you want scrip, always do leader of the pack. Fast 4 legendaries.
---
It's obvious by now that Beth is playing with Leg rates.
---
Please know that that is a chinese officers sword. You'll piss a whole nation off saying that.
---
Intensive punk playing a videogame - edgelord hiding behind an online persona to spout fucked up views hes to scared to say in real life.
---
At work, dont have time for this... bye.
---
I honestly love that most of the player economy is already pivoting to ammo as currency.
---
&gt;‚Ä¢There are ALMOST NO LEGENDARIES.
---
I've encountered maybe 6 legendary scorched. 4 were 3 star and only one dropped a 2 star item. One star loot from 3 stars for life.
---
My playing hours are on the high end of the bell curve.
---
I didn't try to make the final goal but I sure shot up SBs.
---
"No idea what is happening down there but the bombs are still dropping. Pushed all the real crazies up here to the Pitt"
---
Wes tek and the normal places aren't reliable for me anymore because of all the buffoons running through with energy weapons leaving ash and goo piles.  But my level 26 character is hitting his daily limit, so it can't be that bad.  Just looking in the he wrong places I guess.
---
Yes, totally agree. Perhaps equipping scrapper would make the bodies glow bright green temporarily? Similar to a mod I use in 4... we have Pip-Boys, surely they could mark the bodies with a little square? Anything?!
---
Game feels a lot similar to nv in some aspects. This is a dangerous comment to make thoü§î
---
Trust me I know my stuff,  are you talking about Shaun or some other baby?
---
How do?
---
Oh yeah, there was Shaun, so I had two babies. No wonder I was so f*ckin tired.
---
At least almost as glitchy as NV.
---
Go farm when Heart of the Swamp event is active ... they bloom then.
---
Still only seen buds then...
---
Bloodied melee is VERY viable and is the highest damage output build so far if played correctly. To answer your question straight away - to get more strenght you would need a set of unyielding armor which boosts your special points when you're at low hp, so irradiate yourself to have only 20% health to get full benefits from it. Also, Radicool in Endurance will boost your strength by 5, and ofcourse dont forget Nerd Rage in INT. Assuming you will have 15 base STR, the perks you can choose from are obviously Gladiator(cause you're using sword), Incisor, Martial Artist, Blocker, Barbarian (for more DR). There are also useful perks in AGI such as Moving Target, if you're not gonna use stealth then you can equip Marathoner and Action Boy in agility tree. "Bloody mess" in Luck, coupled with Serendipity and Starched Genes, assuming you have essential Mutations like Talons, Twisted Muscles, Adrenal Reaction, Grounded and Marsupial ofcourse
---
I made a survey about PvP.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dfywtk/simple_change_to_loadbalancer_would_fix_the_main/
---
The conclusion from the results is that the main issue with both adventure and survival, when it existed, is that it has tried to carter to completely different audiences at the same time, and these audiences considered members of the other side "problematic" - for PvErs the PvP people are mostly assholes (to the point that if you mention you like PvP you usually get insulted few times), for PvPers, the PvE people are dilution of server slots.
---
All we, PvPers really need are servers where no pacifist players are connected. Hunter/Hunted is enough of thrill seeking experience if it ever manages to start, but it never starts, because chances of four nonteamed PvPers to be on a server are low.
---
The greatest fix to availability and quality of PvP can be done in under a day by tweaking how players are connected to servers when they press play, without touching any other ingame systems.
---
Gulpers do this too, they hang upside down from branches using the tail.
---
Regardless, cool shot :)
---
I've been doing this myself and it crashes all the same
---
I changed my combat rifle receiver to automatic .38 so I can empty my ammo cause no one will even take them free, lol. Let‚Äôs say the killing sure slowed down but got my last 1000 going from my starting +5000 in two days, lol.
---
It is probably a conscious choice of them to make e.g. pumpkins (delivery item for a daily) or cranberries (ingredient for 10% exp boost) not possible to grow im C.A.M.P.
---
Just out of curiosity have you been playing more/longer than your friends?
---
Its bc its Halloween
---
I started during the last beta test, they started a few days before me
---
Just having the ruins of Downtown D.C. would suffice.
---
BOS set and perks for good DR. So not really focus legendary effects. Will do in a second time.
---
I'm looking to do it this week. On European time, after 8 pm or daytime
---
Huh weird
---
environmental story telling and loneliness aspects struck a similar tone with me, and I feel like its wacky when it wants to be like nv, 4 was I felt like a little bit too much in your face wacky humor. also diseases, eating, drinking, sleeping etc all add a NV like vibe to me as I played NV many times with many mods but admittedly never touched FO4 after finishing it once. 
---
crafting edibles is cool too, collecting plants and stuff. 
---
and anticipation for wastelanders (and I'm sure its DLC waves will be like it too) is kinda like waiting for your favorite mod to come out; adding shit ton of stuff for free.
---
and if you are not running bloodied big dick 6k sentinel bolstered AND kinda not want to die because of ultra cool gamer instincts, game is kinda demanding. 
---
Comparing 2019 October's F76 and F4, man, I think F76 is the better game. no kidding.
---
Did you ask him politely to stop?
---
Yes, he screeched at me
---
The armor only seems to break pc. I've got a full set, have fought about 10 Queens since getting it and have had no problems. And I've been counting the people there before n after and have not noticed any dc for others.
---
As for the dmg it really dose not do that much. I kill everything to quickly dmfor it to matter, don't see it affecting the Queen much.
---
It really only breaks pvp I guess. Which I don't really play
---
Maybe I'm grasping at straws but for me it seems like the more scrip I have, the worse my drops are. The last time I was at 0 scrip I was getting 3 star drops from almost every 3 star enemy, but this morning as I was carrying 1000 scrip I fought five 3 star enemies and got exactly 33 scrip worth of drops. Including a stalkers limb damage pipe wrench.
---
Your raw agility score absolutely contributes the lions share of benefit to stealth. Going from a 23 agility at full health to 38 at bloodied levels, I notice a significant difference while sneaking through a place like West Tek. Same gear and perks, just missing the 15 point unyielding boost.
---
Typically I sneak right past any enemy without stars, and I can avoid caution altogether with 38 AG.
---
I love some of the ideas you guys came up with... scrapping ammo should be a thing, bulk ammo should be a thing... and how about selling ammo for less than 1 cap per round? I would love to be able to sell 500 rounds for just a random price, 5 caps.
---
This!
---
Lmaoooo bro welcome to the club. He ambushed me once long ago and has had it out for me ever since. Stalking me, attacking my base, INVITING THAT DAMN FLATWOODS MONSTER TO COME POSSESS MY COW
---
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay of that pile of fuzzy animals, boundless and bare; the lone and level grasses stretch far away.
---
Scorched glowing Yao Guai?
---
We can‚Äôt know for sure unless a dev chimes in, but I think the mole miner supervisor and Primal Cuts stealth nerf probably has more to do with buggy burrowing enemy omniscience than an intentional game mechanic. 
---
Typically when I get locked in danger, it‚Äôs because some enemy is stuck underground, just popped out of the ground, or just burrowed into the ground. Something about this game mechanic doesn‚Äôt jive well with concealment.
---
Just collect a bunch of plastic, get Hard Bargain and Party Boy/Girl, bundle the useless junk and sell it to vendors. EZ money.
---
Or buy lead from me for 1 cap each, I'm a melee player. I get enough shotgun shells from Scorched and Mole Miners to have more than enough ammo for crippling Scorchbeast wings and keycard drone thrusters, I don't need to craft it anymore.
---
I normally aim for at highest 45% of the default price it‚Äôs valued at, no one will pay for ammo that‚Äôs more than a cap. If im buying 2000 rounds I‚Äôm not open to paying 4000 caps for it.
---
I kinda love this, even though gourd soup provides the same stat buff as pumpkin soup.
---
Some server hops I get very little. Others it seems like west tek has 3 legendaries, one at NAR, one at watoga emergency, and so on.
---
It's all anectotal but it sure feels like some servers are better than others sometimes.
---
Poop
---
First one of those I killed at lv14 last year with a couple of friends, man that was a rough fight as it kept healing!
---
Odd... I was thinking yesterday that I've gotten more 3 stars than usual this past week. 
---
Funny thing though:   At West Tek earlier this week, I got myself into a situation and died. I had just started trying out the Mysterious Savior perk and it actually worked this time. The game got wonky for a moment while the Savior was reviving me and when I stood back up, there were three 3-star Super Mutants. 2 of them dropped 3-star items.
---
I tried it at Whitesprings and purposely died... Again the Savior awkwardly arrived and this time there were two 3-star enemies and a 1-star during my run (between the clubhouse and the rowhomes). Both 3-stars gave 3-star items.
---
I'm sure this is all just good-luck-charm, superstition BS, but I've been doing pretty well in the legendary dept since  he's been around.
---
He‚Äôs vacuum-sealed in his alien-metal flight suit.
---
Yeah we could get a notification it is hatching and if you're there when it hatches it becomes a pet, if not it tears up your camp.
---
We could leave "mystery eggs" in other people's incubators too. Come home to a Deathclaw baby eating your Brahmin.
---
Ugh... You're basically Wasteland GameStop at this point... That's rough.
---
Depend on what it is, I mainly sell plans. If it's rare or sought after I'll jack up the price and sit on it, itl usually sell. If it's something something lame I put it super cheap for new characters. I always have 76 as my last two digits unless something is going for 101caps. Just as a general rule for maxing out your profits, over price everything and lower prices over time until they start to go.
---
Lmg users suggest otherwise but in most other cases its 1 cap or nothing.
---
Didn't even have to use your handmade ...
---
I'm very near the Overseer's camp and I've never been able to sell low-level modified weapons unless they're legendary. What does sell are underarmors, even the lowest tier ones, since there's only upside and no barrier for low levels to wear them. I sell them super cheap, like 50 for lower tiered stuff or a couple of hundred if they require flux.
---
Also, plans that are pretty much locked in harder regions like marine tactical plans and such. The helmets are super easy to make and can sell them for \~30 caps at vendors, so it's a good source of income for low levels.
---
Need a trade ui like Fallout 1/2 or Elder Scrolls Online!
---
I didn't realize he's so rare. I've been playing since  mid July, and have about 200 hours logged. I've seen/killed him atleast 4 times. Had him appear during the SBQ, he got killed before he could turn her purple. I wasn't firing at him hoping that he would, woulda been so cool. I'd happily switch my monster finding luck for legendary drop luck though, because Im pretty sure I've seen the flatwoods monster more times than I've gotten a valuable legendary....
---
I have never seen scorched Mole Miners down there and I have pretty much the same hour count.
---
Moreover as I presume everyone else does I go there often, because fever.
---
If your on Xbox I bet I know exactly what person you are talking about. I had clips of this persons camp that had it over his house. I sent them pics and videos. After a month later that person is still not banned and still had that written on their camp....smh
---
this has been removed? Is the competition done?
---
People mutate because those have a benefit. No need to give an easy button. 
---
But I'd be good with it scaling to 20 or 30 based on mutations. Maybe 1% per.
---
All the specific target need to go to 50%. Berserker needs to scale better and have no downside .. nocturnal .. 
---
Mutants as it us now is basically no effort free boost.
---
Yea it makes sense to move into existing structures but instead we all build giant pre war looking brick mansions on a golf course. Would be cool taking over and boarding up buildings
---
He could be talking about the Shishkebab?
---
That‚Äôs a settlement item in FO4, unfortunately.
---
Whatever method they want to use, they need to make it so players who don't use power armor can go into a nuked zone.
---
I actually though that was the point of RadShield, but it's not as effective as PA... It should be. The rarity of the Strangler Blooms make it hard to craft, so it's perfect.
---
I mainly sell stuff as a community service because caps are really not something I sweat about - takes away from the enjoyment of the game.
---
Ammo is 1 cap for the types that sell at all, and otherwise gets dropped into a bag or nearby container. Plans are sold at a uniform 20% of face value. Legendaries are typically in the 1k-2k range, but I only sell legendaries that I think someone might use. I might go higher should I ever be in the situation to sell a god roll or a super rare plan. ;-)
---
Its scrip lol
---
Weapons I post a little less than what I would be able to sell them on a trade subreddit
---
Easiest way I've found is to kill the sentry bots at whitesprings. Server hop a couple of times and you're good to go.
---
We should get an ocean update
---
It pops up in the personal terminal
---
Gernades personally but agreed
---
I know I haven't been able to find it in there either.
---
1 cap per round is exactly how i sell it in my vendor.
---
I don't have any to drop.
---
Nope.
---
I'm totally with you. I don't even try to do it alone because I know I would fail because of this lame mechanics. Even with 3 friends together it's almost impossible to finish this mission on expert mode just because of the slow terminals. 
---
I talked to a new group yesterday and they told me they have not tried once to di a RAID because there is still the issue that some guys left their COMPLETE inventory (Armor, Weapons everything) because of a disconnect in the middle of a Raid. 
---
Did Bethesda say something new about this?
---
Same thing happened with me!!! It just won‚Äôt let me respawn!!
---
Getting all six pieces of power armor for 30 a piece when you get 2 novice, 4 standard, and 6 expert kinda sucks. Would like to see that upped. In all honesty vault 94 is okay but not something I want to run over and over and over again. Too many things go wrong on a performance level. Too many bugs. I think optimization should be a priority if you want people to raid the vaults so often. 
---
Fact is, Vault 94 is fucked. I get burned out just from shitty bugs. Its ass. I would be happy with a 3 steel for novice, 5 for standard, 8 for expert.
---
press the esc key to exit terminals, not tab.
---
I sell plans for 25% of their in-game value, full Fusion Cores for 50 caps each, Super Stimpaks and Stealth Bois for 10 caps each and ammo for 1 cap per round. Not too expensive, I think, and I still make more caps than by selling it to a bot vendor.
---
It was a short lived reality people traded the Strangler power amor via an exploit which was fixed like weeks ago. You could share atom paints aswell. Those strangler armors managed to get pricey as close as BE gatling plasmas legacies, but this shinenigans is over now.
---
I‚Äôm not sure about any updates from Bethesda, but I‚Äôd bet the reason some people have lost inventory is because of this new ‚Äúinstanced‚Äù technology they implemented.
---
You must have gotten lucky then my fps breaks down in the fight and some people yelled over the area mic to stop using it. Guess it hits differently.
---
Usually, the first time you  clear the Watoga Civic Center, you'll find a legendary scorched. Also, the first time I cleared Watoga EMS on one character (the other was a Super Mutant, and another was a ghoul). 
---
I've found it to be about 1/3 chance, in subsequent visits.
---
I‚Äôm playing on Xbox. My only option is the B button
---
Yeah, happens all the time. Pretty annoying. :/
---
Note to self: Pip Boy lights count as lamps too. xD
---
I know i am late on this and doubt I will get a response but have you guys through data mining found a way to craft the SBQ or Mothman wall mounts? they are in the build section but they are locked behind a blueprint
---
"All we are is dust in the wind, dude"
---
Is youuuuuu
---
Actually to the best of my knowledge you can still trade the PAs now and the BE gat plasma was so mass-duped that you could probably get twenty for a single Strangler.
---
Economy has just been bonkerised, and now everyone will be able to get great legacy 3* gear before 4* gear is introduced. I wouldn't bet on legacy remaining legacy - this explosive+beam splitter thing is going to be reworked for server stability sooner or later.
---
Yea, someone else said it's possible for me to team and do that myself... and since you dont know me personally, theres not much I can say to dispute that. But I would like to think that during the time its taken me to build 350+ karma by being an honest, fair trader, I've got a rep for being trustworthy.
---
Not to mention, if we had a problem with each other, he wouldn't have teamed with me to vandalise his camp in the first place.
---
So this was confirmed on PC and it was in survival mode that it happened. I havent heard of anyone losing their inventory in adventure mode. Bethesda was able to bring back their items from what i understand. This was the last i heard about it
---
I had the foundation elsewhere when I started building, but I moved it to where it is now because it gave me more room to build on the first floor. I just got lucky that it looked good where it ended up.
---
the problem with animations is they can happen at inconvenient times, like when you're drinking 6 quantums in a row in the middle of a fight because you ran out of stimpacks a long time ago, otherwise yeah awesome
---
This is why you need a team to cover you
---
I think that map button should work the same way (start?).
---
No I say this as a hazmat user. I would like to keep my underarmor on however. 
---
I would like to see a mod system for the hazmat suits. Like, pocketed, shadowed, 50% longer drugs, ect.
---
Will they lose players if most don't know about it and contribute it to RNG? Most players weren't mad about serum recipe removal and the queen since no one told them about and thought they just had bad luck but with this situation its more slowing the drip.
---
I found one during the beta as like level 5 on the highway to Morgantown, scared the shit out of me.
---
What would you buy it for? That is the correct price to sell for
---
You can use the pride icon and then it shows on every workshop you claim too.
---
I like the challenge of doing things solo sometimes.
---
There is a thing in arms race (evolution) that is called convergence. Its basically achieving the same results through different paths. Historically, being venomous has emerged separately from different lines of evolution.
---
Crude tech based on limited availability of prewar tech is one of greatest arenas for convergence - these are based on the same scarcities and same building blocks.
---
I've been a community organiser for quite a while. I recently received quite a few of those from different people.
---
PvE they are decent, not OP, something like weaker and faster to load Quad Assheads.
---
PvP they one-shot all bloodbuilds with HP lower than 111 which make it a game of tag - its pretty fun and to be honest, crude craftable weapons should be dangerous enough in skilled hands, I don't think having these publicly available would break the game - but it would change it for sure. I've stashed mine because if its not available to anyone, I wont be using it after initial testing period (I'm a tester IRL, upon being given one I couldn't NOT test it and I won't lie about this fact nor the results of the testing).
---
I don‚Äôt know where you got that information, because it‚Äôs definitely not the case
---
Irradiated Yao Guai from far harbor.
---
I was about to post this same thing yesterday and literally got possum badges from both dailies, and I saw campfire tales for the first time since last patch, but I didn't check if i got one from that too. Keep grinding it's just bad luck.
---
It allways a jump scare, because you never see it coming. You can fight giant bats, deathclaws and mirelurk queens, but they never shock like the mothman does. I allways freak out whenever I see one.
---
Sure. For 500 atoms you can have pumpkins.
---
Some people use bloodied at full health and think of the effect as a bonus for nasty fights.
---
I believe they've fudged the numbers all along. There's no reason not to and all the reason to.
---
The Flatwoods monster.
---
I feel like the legendary reward mechanism needs some tweaking in general, specifically with more weapons, more legendary effects, and a bump to the gear level cap.  It isn't fun to farm gear or play the purveyor if you don't occasionally get a good drop that you'd actually use in game instead of sell.
---
Took me a few months to run into one, sounds like you're having a great time!
---
plug in a keyboard? remap a controller button?
---
If you ran that build, would you buy it? That Mutant slayers, lockpick +1 intelligence wood piece might be 3 stars, but seriously just think. Would I use this?
---
Do Queen of the Hunt enough. It‚Äôll show up.
---
Some people use dog food with good doggy because it is a fast way to eat.  Adding animations and delays would add new problems for players to complain about.
---
You should need a team to cover you in a raid because it was designed that way and not because the game lags.
---
I bet he sensed your 20 lamps in your junk, he's just a hungry boi
---
Saw my first one max 2 months ago.  Might be still the only one I've seen, took a photo of it so it's permanently one of my loading screens.
---
The original games had them though.  Bring back the G11 lol
---
I found the purple eyed one randomly to the south east, just taking a stroll out in the wasteland. Instead of taking it's life, I took its photo, it spooked him off
---
Cool looking isn't it?
---
Cook. Meth.
---
Is that the Flatwoods monster's edgy rocker teen cousin?
---
Well, kill the enemies first. It's quite easy with bloodied riflebuild, no idea about melee, but you probably have better sneaking gear.
---
you can break it down again.. thats what I do when I bulk more than I can sell in a vendor session..
---
I scrap it again manually before I put it back in my stash..
---
Agree, kinda. There are SO many pumpkins near the Quest, and you still have to go there to turn in, there isn't much of an exploit there. Cranberries make more sense, but I think it should be an endgame quest for either a planter or the outright ability to plant them.
---
Woah woah woah, you mean to tell me, there's a way I can have a frog friend? I'm only level 27, so I'm new to the game, but this excites me
---
I did kill them all, but at a certain point while I was in the terminal for 30 minutes, the PA speaker said something about more security and then more spawned and I literally couldn‚Äôt leave the terminal. I‚Äôm a bloodied build, so I can only take so many hits before death.
---
Done.
---
So you posit that lag is the challenge therefore this is not a bug, is a feature.
---
Did I read that correctly?
---
I wish we could craft lamps using the bio fluid, to attrack them with a lure or something. That would be so cool.
---
Yeah, I think that was the first time I saw one like that.
---
Doesn't help that we still don't know where the hell they came from. Are they more West Tek experiments, like the snallygasters and grafton monsters? Are they just like any other mutated, giant bugs? Or are they something... otherworldly? I mean, Fallout has had paranormal stuff before (Dunwich, anyone?).
---
What scares me moat os the unknown, amd the mothman is the biggest question mark in the game... not Wise Mothman, tho. He gives me an XP boost, he's cool.
---
Raids are designed as a team event. I get your point though.
---
They can only be found in random encounter spots, so you have 2 get lucky in order to find one.
---
Kebabs are middle eastern... Prepare to be skewered, infidel!
---
I've been grinding for levels, respeccing towards a sneak crit rifle build, from Melee/heavy rifle (all over the place, right? that's why lol) and I've capped over the weekend, but I've been playing A LOT. I'm positive it's been WAAAAAY slower than it was. i mainly miss muties at meditation and uranium happening more than ONCE A MF DAY!!!! I used to server hop and initiate meditation on each server.
---
not surprised. I stopped playing a few months back after the atomic shop only partially loaded, they should focus on fixing the bugs, and not adding more stuff to the atomic shop.
---
Unfortunately was probably done on purpose. To keep people from banking too hard on the sale.
---
Just adding this here even though I know you're probably aware, but always use whatever trading group you're using's courier system. Don't trust just some random guy the person brought along. Seen a few scams with fake couriers
---
I respect and understand that. But I knew I could theoretically beat it on novice my first time doing it, and none of my friends were on at 7am. So I went for it. Definitely won‚Äôt do it again.
---
wendigos do the same thing. But it's a little more terrifying when you look up and see one of those things staring back at you.
---
How were you able to make a character with the "Alien" race?
---
At LVL 14? Nice! Mind you having friends with you does wonders. My first sighting was back in January and I was level 15, I was doing a quest solo he shows up as level 40... Ummm ya no I ran!
---
Yeah that could be. But personally I expect this will that Waslanders will be the final hurrah for Fallout 76 and there won't be much content going forward after this.
---
You can still play AND have fun. Mules exist because once you play long enough, you have tons of things. I see your point and share it, but there are some ways to fix it. Like shared stash, etc.
---
I recently drank the entire contents of a single punchbowl.. 10 Nukashines. The problem was, the cascading black outs. 10 back to back... god, that was a nightmare..
---
I agree but most people will probably disagree and start calling you names for having opinions
---
My camp/store is a public rest stop, so i like having all possible crafting benches available for my customers in case they need them. Also, making and drinking Nukashine is a fun way to explore areas of the map you probably would never think to go to.
---
Personally I'm salty I can't have a mule without 2 playstations.
---
Why do you think it is a victimless action?  Are you suggesting hate speech is victimless?
---
I have a mix of low level and high level stuff at Pleasant Valley Train Station @ Top of the World.
---
Regular decent weapons are suggested price plus level and I spec them for max damage and repair to 130%.
---
Regular Legendary runs 25 per star plus level plus suggested price.
---
High demand legendaries are priced $1,000 to $3,000.
---
Legendary armor is priced the same as regular legendary weapons.
---
Aid items are 1/2 of suggested except for high demand items like high radiation fluids, mass, and stable flux. In that case I check the marketplace.
---
Bobbleheads, magazines and maps are $75 and I don‚Äôt care if some are rare. I don‚Äôt have time IRL to keep up with pricing on those items. It is a game after all.
---
Camp plans and food are 10% of suggested price. Weapon plans and mods, and armor plans and mods are 25% to 50% off retail. 
---
Junk is easiest. 50% off all bulked stuff. Individual pieces such as gold are $2 each. Deathclaw hides and Halucigen cylinders are $100 because they‚Äôre relatively rare.
---
Ammo has 3 divisions according to rarity. Common stuff is $1. Medium stuff like 2mm EC runs $2. Highly rare ammo such as gamma rounds are $3. Fusion cores are $1 per percentage of charge. I usually only sell 100% charged for $100. Plasma cores are the same. I don‚Äôt deal in Cannon balls, fuel, .38, RPG ammo, or Railroad spikes. Stuff like that is dropped off at the train station in the blue suitcase.
---
Anything like plans that sit for a week or two and don‚Äôt sell will be dropped off at the Overseers camp. Any 1 Star weapons or armor that don‚Äôt sell after 2 weeks is used for scrip.
---
Eh, personally I doubt it will be the last thing they do. They've already stated they plan to expand Wastelanders even more going forward, and since it is Beth. Austin doing it, and not the main studio, it really won't affect their plans for their main games at all. 
---
Now if the total Wastelanders package doesn't pan out for them, then yeah they'll probably slow down the content a lot until they don't want to do it anymore, but as of right now they're likely hoping this so their Final Fantasy 14 moment.
---
Also theres a pumpkin patch near fort defiance that you can build on that has a ton of pumpkins so if you wanted theres already 1 spot on the map with an entire farm of pumpkins for you to camp at.
---
I remember awhile back in the patch notes (forgot which update, either 11 or 12) Bethesda said they tweaked it to favor 2 to 3 star legendary drops more. My ass, I have done the SBQ event 4 times in a row now and 4 times in a row it's dropped 1 star garbage like an assassin's Assaultron blade, or Auto stim wood leg.
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one experiencing this but it's really frustrating to grind several 3 stars for skimpy amounts scrip.
---
they dont update it on weekends but i estimate that these are the numbers because on average we kill 2.1 milion scorched a day
---
I will and now and then I do check out if any new mods are released to it's PS4 version and download those, so that I have everything that I want when I return.
---
you still would come back with most of your radiation and since the zones I'm talking about have a constant rad effect you would die nearly instantly again since it still has no effect on radiation 
---
why I love my 2 shot gamma gun in pvp (bloodied build jumps out +250 rads dies instantly)
---
There will in the next couple weeks. Save your scrip.
---
Of all the creature wall mounts present in the game's files, there are a little over ten that show up in quest reward lists. You can see what they are here: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/detits/all_the_obtainable_plans_and_recipes/
---
Unfortunately, the ones you are interested in are not available. We'll just have to see if that changes in future patches. Answered by /u/Sergeant_MQZ
---
Is that still true? Because the loading screen says gas masks protect from water borne diseases
---
No. That is all.
---
I had a plastic pumpkin disappear from my display case, so if you‚Äôre displaying junk be aware it might get scrapped.
---
thank you so much
---
not only all the bugs/glitches/broke shit i went in solo on novice and spent over 5k ammo and 90 stims just to run out of ammo and have to "die"...and then i find out cant even get plans on novice...such a mess.
---
You have no idea who I am or what my real life wealth is. I have no desire to have more than one computer or pay Bethesda for more than one game code. Thanks for your concern.
---
Didn't work for me on PC
---
I expect all new bugs
---
That can happen? Actually sounds fun might give it a go
---
Maybe it is the increase in public events? I seem to be getting so overwhelmed with legendaries by running the events that I don't even have time to run west tec or whitespings anymore
---
I got only 1 3 star equip in the last three days. Prolly about 30 legendaries total. I‚Äôd like to meet that one guy who is getting all our luck
---
Shared stash between several characters would allow people who cannot afford or do not want to run multiple game accounts and devices, I think this would help.
---
Places everyone on a level playing field.
---
Yeah and all the spawns are like nocturnal boards or assassins pipe revolver.
---
Already have ;)
---
They were VERY clear that these are not designed to be soloed and you are upset that they were right?
---
Nope :)
---
Yeah this is so cringe.
---
Better off paying a PR company to make a campaign for it to at least look organic.
---
this list is missing the prime Harpoon mod
---
I got the opposite problem. Every time I spawn in the quest starts because documents are ADDED into y inventory. I get 1 extra for each log in but it never pulls it from inventory when I turn it in. I had 9 but now that I‚Äôve logged in 3 times in the past 24 hours I have 12. And each tie the first thing I did was turn in the data.
---
aqua boy needs some love - also in one of the burrows photos we saw one of the devs in the diver armor from fallout 4 
---
really aqua boy should have 2 ranks - rank 1 your immune to rads and can breath under water - rank 2 you are immune to parasites and other diseases and the murkiness of water is reduced 60% and swim speed is doubled
---
I think the scariest enemies are the sleeping and sliding across the floor ghouls.
---
Thanks for taking the time.
---
Cook. *jet*
---
I feel you luckily on pc u can run two. I wouldn't know what I would do without a mule they should add a in-game transfer Atleast
---
This is the way
---
If it was static numbers each day then youd be correct. But with a final weekend push for a stupid good deal everyone wants, its anyones guess what that is going to bump the avg kills up to.
---
.50 cal
---
Any chance you could give directions to this spot? Or a map marker? Might want to build there.
---
I'll take another look. I appreciate it!
---
Yeah I think he was level 40, it took all of our ammo, and we had to stim each other a few times!
---
Thankfully its a much easier fight as you get better 0erks and weapons!
---
My Xbox gtag is the same as my reddit name. I‚Äôm original lol.
---
u/slayden10
---
Would love to be able to easily place something like that in camp. For now I have a hidden switch that explodes a wall revealing a hidden cave. I mean it's great but it was a beast to put together.
---
The whole Sheepsquatch questline is probably the most substantial so far.  Biv is fun but simple, Pioneer scouts are okay but the backpacks are worth the time investment.  Everything else is meh, with the raids being the most disappointing.  At least in my opinion.
---
The problem with this idea is FO76 isn't a MMO so if they were to lean into too many MMO ideas it could put off all the customers who bought it for what it is not what it isn't
---
I'm pretty sure that as you level up, so do the types of spawns you can get. I've noticed that since I've been over level 100, I'm seeing way more glowing wolves, yao guai and radstag etc when I'm the first one into an area.
---
Calibrated shocks sells for a good amount, around for 10-20k caps. And ultracite provides the best radiation resistance and scorched resistance
---
I e been searching for the plans for awhile now, haven‚Äôt gotten them or seen them
---
Go visit Lucky Hole mine if you didn't alread, should be a treat
---
Oh hell yeah! We took him down after less than a minute of starting the fight. I used a medics handmade with explosive rounds and she was using this none legendary pimped out 10mm auto
---
My first camp was by a radio tower that had a little makeshift shooting range that had two to three pumpkins. I loved it and made so much pumpkin soup.
---
All they do is restore a previous save so if you submit a ticket for an item you‚Äôve never had then you‚Äôll never get it restored
---
I've had this bug off and on as well. As recent as two weeks ago to as far back as March-ish. Usually results after fast traveling. Please fix, Beth.
---
At the same time, if you go in expecting to be disappointed then you'll go through it focused on all your negative experiences and it'll just become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
---
Props to you. I did my last three kill scorched with ______ weapons for a total of about 200 scorched kills.
---
Half Nukashine and half the other stuff I won't drink like the Lead Champagne and the one that gives a higher chance for diseases
---
They are extremely rare, like probably the rarest of all ultracite plans. Ultracite Jet packs are also rare, mostly because they started dropping not long ago. But calibrated is very hard to find
---
Fuck, so that‚Äôs what happened to my toy collection :(
---
Ah, I see, there must've been a high level in WS before I logged into the server
---
There is an event called Bots on Parade that runs really close by now and again. It's got a few spawn points but that's one of them. That could be your way to stumble upon it naturally.
---
\&gt;&gt; Also wanted to know if people playing a MoM still use the Blade of  Bistet, Garb of Mystery, Eye of Ra and the Voice of Set once past 50? 
---
My Alt is lvl 70, I use the Garb, Eye and Blade (100% Anti Armour is good) - I tend not to use the Voice, though I do carry it with me. I carry the Fixer and an Inst Lever for my ranged work. I use Barbarian and Evasive (Sometimes Iron clad as well) and combined I can get a DR of 200 (ER is around the 250 mark\*)
---
I do use Mutations though.
---
* Marsupial - Acrobatics
---
* Chameleon - To be really good at stealth
---
* Speed Demon - Athletics
---
* Grounded\* - No reason
---
* Twisted Muscles - To actually be good in melee
---
* Herbivore (Only to be different from my main)
---
The build isn't finished, but I can and do have fun with it.
---
Question, you are aware that you can "rebuild" the Blade, Garb and Voice?
---
Fo 76 will become a cemetery
---
Shielded Enclave Under Armor will give you +3 Strength.
---
Party Boy/Girl and Whiskey +6 Strength 
---
Mole Rat Chunks +1 Strength 
---
Glowing Meat Steak +10% Melee damage and I believe this stacks with other foods to increase melee damage.
---
Chems I love Fury it will boost your Melee Damage by 30%.
---
Mutations adrenal reaction and twisted muscles
---
Meat Hooks benefit from Iron Fist and Gladiator I just bought a max level Instigating Swing Speed Meat Hook for 3k caps from player vending.
---
Level 3 Sneak 
---
I like instigating swing speed weapons with a sneak attack you can get 4x the damage on the first hit.
---
Wow I‚Äôd like to see that
---
I actually don't agree on this.
---
1. People were using caps to buy items when dupers were running rampant. Now that they're not, the market is screwed, and people are hoarding their caps and multiples of weapons and armor pieces for...no real reason. I don't understand being so selfish in a game where you just hoard something that someone else would use that is just collecting dust in your stash box.
---
2. 800 stash space is nice, I like having room to store lots and lots of junk. And also any shitty weapons and armor that will turn into scrip!
---
3. People need to stop hoarding the multiples of weapons and armor pieces that they have. Start spending your caps, and then sell your multiples for caps. Buy serum recipes, go visit vending machines, I don't give a fuck. Just stop being a damn hoarder, you don't need multiples of God tier shit, I promise
---
&gt; no one will pay for ammo that‚Äôs more than a cap.
---
Tell this to the Player I saw with 1000+ 2mm EC @ 10 caps a piece
---
What is your name my friend? I can immortalize you in my camp. In this community, no one should be forgotten. 
---
There was another post somewhere where a friend honored a dying friend by immortalizing him in Fallout.
---
You did a great job on that.
---
Sorry, mate. It's just a ludicrous idea. 
---
If anything, they need to make a way for you to transfer between characters without having to have 2 consoles or trusting a stranger to help you.
---
Take the opiates they give you, take them all.
---
Downvoted for not wanting micro transactions, the state of the sub
---
Content. More content, that's it. I just want more content and story stuff
---
Capital Wasteland and the Pitt would be pretty cool. The whole areas starting out in their infancy, talking 200 years to get where Fallout 3 takes place. I think with/IF BGS is going to keep this game alive for years to come, something like that should happen. The Map is already huge, but making it even bigger with some areas where the low level enemies are at lvl100+ would be cool.
---
Ooh boy, not many legendaries around when I had started.
---
"Banning" or completely stopping this won't happen I'm pretty sure. All I can say is that we really just need shared space or something, maybe like 100-200 stash space that all characters can access. Muling has been a thing in a lot of games it's nothing new.
---
Not true. X-01 has best radiation resistance
---
Why would Bethesda put you in their video game when you just admitted to pirating Skyrim?  Honestly.  And what makes you more special than everyone else?  You play Fallout like the rest of us.  By that logic, we should all be added into the game.
---
I also do not buy your story because of your post comes off as demanding and your post history / active subs.  I think you are just looking for attention and need professional help.
---
I have one question.  If I was to be wearing full strangler power armor and I fire a semiautomatic weapon such as a handmade with the two shot effect and bullet "A" hits the target and causes acid damage will bullet "B"stack even more acid dmg. Or will it only take effect for the first bullet. I know a two shot rad rifle will double the rads in a single shot.
---
I posted it somewhat recently. It's the Bat Cave build on my profile. But basically there's a flamethrower that you trigger with the switch. It then breaks the wall and players can enter the cave there. Presentation wise it's great. But I'd love to have a secret door that doesn't give a headache to place lol.
---
There's a level 250+ dude in NW, who I believe is 280+ or 290+ right now, going by the rate he plays at (absolute lowlife who plays only NW every single picosecond of the day) that the entire continent suspects of cheating, or knows is cheating.
---
Look at Battlefield V's cosmetic shop.
---
They only give out halfway decent cosmetics as final chapter rewards, the rest are just basically pointless.
---
In return, the price of their cosmetics are jacked up so that whales will spend more each purchase to make up for the rest of the playerbase.
---
Rather than ask for how we get these things, ask for more. With the fridges and protectrons we've seen that we don't get a choice about HOW they are implemented.
---
TL;DR: We're better off suggesting WHAT we want, Bethesda will decide HOW they implement it.
---
Doesnt sound demanding. Just asking. 24 is really damn young and the wasteland is vast.
---
Exactly lol
---
Uh most specks of dust get 3 times the life though. It isnt nearly the same. Get over yourself
---
They haven't been teasing much about it even though it's their "biggest" update so I'm honestly not expecting much. We're just a few weeks away from it and they've really shown us nothing else and that's worrying.
---
Itt a bunch of jealous nerds apparently. God what a sad community we have.
---
At the moment, all we have is textures for the Gauss Pistol and the new Power Armor, but we don't even have models for those. Answered by /u/Gearsthecool
---
meldown is just terrible with bad raid design all over.
---
dead in the water is the most mechanically consistant to perform so it's good to run.
---
washout is probably the most fun to play however between the timer being reset to 30 seconds after completing the control rooms objectives and many of the puzzles dependant on RNG (eg. 3 randomly selected errors on a terminal require fixing and each of those fixes located on another terminal have random variables that change from raid to raid) the raids success is very luck dependant so failure on the higher dificulties can leave you feeling cheated with no substantial means of you/your group being able to improve on your next attempt.
---
It is ridiculous how rare Calibrated Shocks are. Clocking in 800 hours and I still don't have the plan (I launch 3-6 nukes a day when I have time)
---
I crafted whole suit of Strangler Heart power armor and now it's collecting dust in my stash cause it's unusable for me without Cali shocks..
---
I think there's something about TS and Plasma pistols that is not applicable to TS and balistic weaponry
---
Ouch.

I approve this message

---
Yep, I‚Äôm level 294, killed sbq a lot and lots of scorchbeasts and never got them plans, think Bethesda is messing with us
---
I suspect they will introduce new weapons, but forget to add the ammo to the game.
---
Poor mothman.
---
Austin has not worked on anything since february, they've shown (apart from all the NPCs and core stuff) at least 7 weapons, 1 PA, many armors, locations, mechanics etc
---
its make or break boys. they know it, they need holiday sales, we need new content ffs
---
I personally did less than my fair share... But I did sell over a dozen Zealots 3* weapons at cheap prices! How can you put a price on arming the forces that were what I assume to be  the bulk of mass slaughter
---
Agreed!  
---
IMO it makes little sense that they didn‚Äôt release Halloween as early in October as they could.  The longer we have to display the items the more likely we will be to purchase them.
---
Sorry Bethesda is in too bad of shape after forking over the cash for those gourmet canvas bags to give anything for free
---
wow
---
If you thought those were bad you should try to find the plasma grenade plan!
---
All i want for Halloween is a real event.
---
October is the month the nukes dropped.  Please make an event, does not even have to be good as those expectations are long gone, just add a radio snippet or something.
---
Can help you with that if you're on PC...
---
Haha I'm level 294 aswell üòÜ I've been searching for cali shocks plan for a looong time, and whoever has it, won't even take 25k caps, they want an endgame weapon trade for a plan... cmon bruh
---
Serious question, if you haven't thought about it.
---
Trading outside the game, how would you stop that from happening?  I mean, selling items from in game is against the ToS, but short of targeting one platform at a time (when there are a virtually infinite number of platforms that can be created), how would you police this?
---
Same issue with mules.  How does BGS prevent 2 accounts from trading with each other *only* when they're owned by the same person?
---
You make some good points, though I don't personally agree with some of them, but you need a way to actually enforce those rules, and that may be a bit harder than you think.
---
By rebuild you mean level up and modify?
---
He mentioned it wasn‚Äôt the difficulty of the enemies, did you read the entire thing?
---
i hope it made it as well. Been away for the last 3 days with family and wasn't able to contribute.
---
On that note, is the goal still acheivable by the end of today? (Oct 14th) or a certain time?
---
Well he was talking in present i logged in too se the discount and there was none
---
I'm Level 171 and i use a melee build and i know for me the biggest problem is the latency/input lag in there.     I have only ever gone in by myself on the Novice difficulty.    So Far the easiest one for me was "Washout"  i could plow through that pretty easily. with no real problems.       
---
"Dead In The Water" was a bit of a challenge for me as even on Novice enemies especially in the last room just keep coming and they hit really goddamn hard.    couple that the with the latency/input lag and randomly enemies rubber-banding around it got hectic real fast.        
---
"Meltdown"   I have yet to complete as of typing this.    The Keycard hunting coupled with all the crazy little side things you have to do in there with all the enemies up your ass every 3 secs and the sheer amount of "Aid" items i burn through in there finally made me just say fuck it.   It also didn't help that i ran out of Fusion Cores for my Power Armor half way through.    Which Making them at a workbench is a good option but i'd rather just get them at a Workshop which now thanks to Survival Mode being gone is a warzone 95% of the time now.     Literally had to sneak in.     Lockpick and steal some off  two competing "raiders" killing each other and wagging dicks as they flew through the air with their quad tesla exploding whatever fucking Unbalanced OP gun/build they use this week.
---
I would like to eventually try them on Normal and Expert but to be honest.   With the Latency the way it is in there at the moment and the pressure of the timer i don't think i'm ready for that just yet.    Really Surprised they don't and Wish they would have a matchmaker of some sort so you can go in there with random other people.    Because those were Definitely intended for a group of 4.
---
lol good luck. That's like saying "LFG groups out of game should be banned" because that's all a trade group is... A looking for group, it's just that the group just happens to be traders
---
I‚Äôd just be happy for someone to mod my legs for
---
Me
---
im saving my nukashines for Halloween. it's the trick part of trick or treat.
---
Yeah. I've been looking really hard for the hud plan (XB1). Hitting the trading sub like crazy, doing every Queen I can find. I've got tons of every plan but shocks n hud. Luckily I was able to buy the shock plan. Otherwise don't know if I could use my strangler armor.
---
I finally gave up and bought the plans for calibrated shocks lol
---
Do you have the plan? Cause I cant drop raid power armor for someone else to make it calibrated..
---
Can you DM me that ticket number when you're done?
---
Yes. Just take a bit of time to re-evaluate, trade, and obtain the pieces you need and you'll be better off. It is what it is. Not like you can fully ignore these pieces.

Isn't it funny? I got an alt up to level six and started roaming in sneak because I felt bad for all these people coming to give me things. It's very sweet, and I am using it (trying to level up without help from my main). Then I go back to that main, and everyone ignores her. Which is fine, too! It just makes me laugh. We all love to help the younglings!
---
&gt; I have no desire to have more than one computer
---
That sounds like you don't know how multiboxing or muling works.
---
For the ultracite pa?
---
Are you sure about that? I was doing service for couple of Strangler Heart PAs and there wasn't any problem. Were they fixed that lately?
---
Weightless armour does not get removed when equipping the Garb of Mystery?
---
That's interesting, so another build that needs me to struggle finding weightless gear.
---
A few days ago I got 4 legendary in one room at WS, then after that I'm lucky to find one one star legendary there. It's so odd, that's always where I go first when I log in and now it's not even worth it.
---
It probably does depend on whether Wastelanders turns out to be a success. If it manages to attract a substantial number of new players, then it would make sense to keep releasing more content updates over the years. The next single player Fallout is realistically a very long way off (and by that, I mean something like ~10 years), until then, plenty of revenue can be made if 76 becomes successful, even if that takes time.
---
Are you upset because you're unable to afford stuff on the trade subs or something?
---
See, for me, I decided to try out my pistols.  It was kind of fun hitting up the low-level Scorched areas in the forest and VATS-oneshotting everyone.
---
just rename anything you don't want to scroll down for with a symbol like a dash - or plus + at the start so alphabetical ordering will bring it all straight to the top of the list (eg. +Power Armour) . good way to keep your gear seperated from everything else in both the pip-boy and stash box.
---
Not really ludicrous just different, at the moment some people are living and benefiting from multiple worlds while new players and some out of choice do not, I think I've read people suggesting some high end mode where you need to be way up there in level to compete.
---
A level playing field for everyone would be a good idea, like an in game bank multiple characters can all access, transfer between characters is a great idea, Bethesda of course make money from selling more game codes.
---
Usually those people would have had to have done enough in life to warrant those left behind to create a memorial.  The memorial has to memorable, have meaning.
---
This is not meant to be mean or critical, however that‚Äôs how it works.  
---
‚ÄòIm dying of cancer but never stopped fighting‚Äô - strong memorial.
---
‚ÄòIm dying of cancer and gave everything to those in need‚Äô - kind memorial.
---
‚ÄòIm dying of cancer but never stopped doing X‚Äô - perseverance memorial.
---
But do realize in this kind of game people are more likely to talk about sex and racism in front of a memorial than a tombstone.
---
I should keep this in mind
---
lack of NPCs almost killed this game
---
yeah, I want ridiculous hoards for me to gun-fu headshot. even if it's not high level. but higher level would be more fun
---
The lag in this game is terrible. I have to turn the graphics all the way down to do any kind of timed mission where things need to be activated. I did the military recruitment and Pioneer agility courses for my lady who was about to lose her shit because the buttons wouldn't respond. Petty things like adding/destroying mainframe cores and the Scrounger perk drive me insane too.
---
If your game can't handle shit like terminals and activation in real time then don't put it in the quests until it can. I swear sometimes this game was built on a potato.
---
giving us quests to find stuff underwater would kinda make sense given the amount of underwater-breathing legendary armor that the purveyor has been giving out
---
I know, nothing new, just think it would make the game a level space if this mule business was removed. Banning was the wrong choice of word as it is too emotive.
---
I have no time to watch 30mins of a frackfest. But since when are there handmades below level 20?
---
take off all armour, put all your weapons away except a combat knife. drink a nukashine and try to get back to your camp without a map
---
Baseball outfit, my pink bladed bat and a mask. Probably the slasher one.
---
I‚Äôve just been attempting this, I‚Äôm at the exact right spot, however there‚Äôs nothing in the road at all, in the video the lady says there‚Äôs always something in the road. I‚Äôve served hopped 10 times and the road is empty.
---
Thanks! I've seen the Gulpers many times in the trees but this was the first time playing almost daily since launch that I had seen a sloth.
---
I love it
---
And I'm nearly certain (not playing right at this second so I can't go check) that the community garden next to Morgantown Airport has ten pumpkins for the related quest anyway. Besides which, I personally have been fine with the idea of also adding another SB kill to my total by harvesting pumpkins near the fissure. I seriously doubt they ever give us a CAMP item that breaks a daily event. And I wouldn't want them to do so.
---
...Dying the dream? üëç
---
Yes I did. If he had someone watching his back while he was IN the terminal he wouldn't have this problem. IE If he wasn't running solo this wouldn't be an issue.
---
not my idea but saw it a while back and thought it was something fun to do
---
Yup, all three can be re-lvl'd to 45
---
hasn't been updated for a couple of days.
---
* 25 caps for armor/weapon blueprints 
---
* 15 caps for any camp blueprints
---
* 500/1000/1500 for legendary items
---
* 100 for collectibles (bobbleheads and magazines)
---
* 350 for serums
---
That's the general rule for my pricing. Of course there's exceptions if I think an item is particularly rare. But I've never went above 4.500 on any item.  
---
I don't sell ammo or junk. No space for it really.  
---
I want to move these items, not hoard them. I also don't have much to spend caps on. Rarely finding an item in a playerstore worth buying.
---
Since always. Level 15 is the lowest level handmade.
---
I don't think anyone is jealous of OPs cancer mate. I'm not gonna jump on the hate train calling him attention-seeking, but I'm not sure I find their request appropriate either.
---
Maybe hoarding would be less prevalent if the build space was greatly increased so people could display much more in their camps, like in Fallout 4 we could build large display rooms, but in F)76 we were showing it off to ourselves, in Fallout 76 we would actually be able to share our display area designs with other real people players, that would be cool.
---
Shared caps between characters and bigger build space, that would be nice.
---
Ok good. Because we're at 23.98 million according to the page and today is the last day right?
---
Both are viable.  New character brings fun rediscovery, but is much slower to get where you are going.  Also, depending on what build you are going for, your target perks may not even be available until L40+.  In that case, I would focus on respec.
---
I won't be surprised if it's pushed back closer to christmas.
---
Ah, okay. Could have sworn it was! Sorry I can't be of any help then.
---
If you got to cranberry glades, it's a random encounter spawn and then to the northeast at the end of a line of trees, next to a pond with a tiny island in it, there's a big patch of red plants. It's also a random encounter, you can server jump over and over there until you get a solo creature to tame.
---
The standard Laser Gun Plan cannot be bought at a vendor, I know of only 2 places in the world it can spawn, making it quite rare imo. 1 is during the event Back on the aBeat, in the third safe room there are level 2 wall safes in the back. Here I have found them. Also the Charleston Herald building at the very top in a room on the desk the plans might spawn there, but it‚Äôs very rare.
---
How close can we settle near the pumpkin house?
---
Hes loyal to his owner and would never leave him for you!!!
---
I think that was a Thursday update if I‚Äôm not mistaken. Or thursdays data.

---
Here's the thing: the type of person chosen to be "immortalized" in a video game is more than likely not the type of person that would actually make a post requesting said memorial. They also tend to be community figures, cohorts, or people with exceptional stories that extol the company "ethos"  in some way, and inspire others.
---
 In your case, the only thing that any of us can gather from your posts is that you are either a troll, a textbook narcissist, or both. 
---
Whether or not this post is legit, or the characterization is legit...if you want to be remembered by others (in a positive light) then DO SOMETHING for them that is worth remembering. Write your own eulogy, and read then it back to yourself. Don't like what it says? Rewrite it; this time write what you WANT it to say. Now instead of a eulogy, you have a guide. It's never too late..
---
I want to agree with you, but I'm struggling to. Bethesda has previously pushed dates back to release things. I remember waiting eight months for Dawnguard after the Xbox folks were already playing, and when we FID get it, it was still a bit of a mess. They don't always plan this stuff well.
---
All if that aside, in it's current state, the game is wonderful... with lots of bugs. I'll keep right on loving it, but I don't know that your delays are going to be everything you hope. My fingers are crossed for you!
---
I don‚Äôt even remember how we survived 400 weight days.
---
I think they'll have a really hard time finding new players. This game has a hoooorible reputation among gamers. I've never mentioned this game to someone who didn't start playing at release without them mentioning all the bad things they've heard about it.
---
I tried the Raid once, at launch, and got so bored and frustrated that I just gave up. To date, I still haven't attempted it again; decided I'm not going to bother until Bethesda improves performance and/or reworks it to make it less of a slog.
---
I know these changes would be hard to impossible to implement, just something I was thinking about, a way to make the game space more egalitarian.
---
I used to run several accounts and machines when I played Eve Online *back in the day,*  I loved running mining fleets and they where in the same corporation so could share ISK and resources. Sharing between our characters would certainly make things more equal.
---
You sure do presume a lot. All the best.

Explore.  At level 68 there is no way you have seen everything the game has to offer.  Across my 5 characters I probably have a combined total of well over 700 levels and I am still finding things I missed.  Right now I‚Äôm on a personal quest to find, and photograph, every unique billboard I can to act as my load screens. 
---
Find the very perfect spot for your camp so that it is useful, gets excellent traffic for your vending, and isn‚Äôt at a location that someone else uses causing you to have to server hop to find it unoccupied.  I still haven‚Äôt accomplished this goal.
---
Alternatively roll a new character that is starkly different from your 1st.  If you leveled as ranged go melee this time.  While the subtleties of builds like stealth commando or heavy weapons specialist take a deep commitment to level high enough to flesh them out with all of their perks you can get a very different game experience, early on, by flipping the script between melee and ranged.  Use a web tool like https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks so that you have a focus on min/maxing your goal build right from the start rather than fumbling your way there like most of us did the first time around.
---
Welcome to the endgame of 76. Do the same few things over and over again with no real end in sight, no greater goal.

Yeh bro. You need to build a frog habitat at a chemistry bench, then go up to a frog and interact with it. Then you‚Äôll have a captured frog. Then underneath floor decorations in your CAMP build mode, you‚Äôll have the option to build a frog jar and it‚Äôll have a live one in it!

Community challenges should be easily smashable. They should be a free gift/event, accessed through a fairly easy challenge to make it a bit more interesting. 
---
I completely agree with you - this has been handled piss poor, but what do we expect by now.
---
No, not upset, just thinking out loud. I'm always max caps in the game and buy serum as a caps sink, my build and gear is just as I like it now. I've never visited these hubs, I'm a PVE player don't need God stuff.
---
Trade hubs make the game space unequal, not everyone uses them, maybe a separate mode for those who use real world money to pimp their game, unless maybe the whole point is to be Godlike and go kill noobs? :)

Go on get him good

---
PvP is pretty broken, I find it can be less skill and more about who has the better build + legendaries. However when you got a couple heads who got that on lock it's great and becomes more skill intensive. PvP is the most exciting thing in the game rn, people here are too sensitive to it lol but it's the same whenever you mention trvding, downvotes all around.

Yep

Thanks.  I do have Speed Demon and I have been able to jump from the ramp to the locomotive, but only to the edge with the faux door.  Didn't know about the "late jump" method and I will try it today, along with a liberal dose of X Cell.  Thanks all!
---
Is it really a 48 hr cool down?
---
:D
---
1. Either Rifleman or Commando, plus Bloody Mess and Demolition Expert
---
2. Dunno, these are different than the ones at Morgantown airport
---
Doesn't make the lag and glitches excusable.
---
It would be more fun if you had a 15-30 to explore before blacking out again
---
Wearing a hazmat suit under a full suit of unyielding armor would basically be godmode. Heavy radiation is the only danger to a bloody build outside of having a hit get through from the Impostor or Project Paradise boss. With a hazmat suit plus unyielding armor with a couple poison effects, you could just cheese through everything the game has to offer for PvE.
---
Without any drama, where‚Äôs the thrill of success?
---
I could possibly get behind a damaged hazmat underarmor that provided a permanent Radshield effect, but no one would ever wear any other underarmor and power armor would be obsolete. You can already blow power armor out of the water with a decent Vanguard suit.  Add in sentinel effects and power armor doesn‚Äôt even come close. The only benefit that PA exclusively provides is heavy rad resist with fairly high DR.
---
I mean, most the timenill pvp a little bit but it depends, if they are fully specced to PvP with unkillable god teir arnour wheres the fun in it for me who isnt 100% pvp specced who doesnt stand a chance?  
---
So yeah, basicalky if i get 1 shot by them and do no damage back to them with my TSE minigun with all damage modifiers then i wont bother
---
I've seen a few questionable ones on PS4, but nothing like what's going on on PC. 
---
They seemed to be focused on getting the dupers currently as they are the biggest threat to server stability.
---
How much to mod
---
My legs? Maybe trade?
---
Not trying to irritate you or anything but if you're playing on PC then you can easily run 2 instances of the game at the same time and the only other thing you'd need to run a mule character would be another Bethesda account and those are free. Just though I'd share some info for any that didn't already know
---
There is not much that can be done about multiple accounts, or at least not in a way that can be reliably enforced. However, I do think it would have been better if all the limits in the game were made account, rather than character based (for example, 3000 daily caps per account, instead of 1400 per character, which equals to 7000/account for mulers), and sharing between characters was made easy. The current system just unfairly punishes solo players who do not want to exploit the game, while mulers still circumvent the limits anyway.
---
There's currently nothing halloween related in the atomic shop files. We may see things next week depending on when Patch 14 is.
---
Same, the only ammo I sell for more are plasma cores which go for 25 caps.
---
I've enjoyed all the content but no doubt it has been buggy.  If I remember right the instancing was just for quest giver npc's. I think Bethesda wants people to have choice and this is how they do it.  
---
What the game really needs is more endgame content.  The tadpole quests were grindy, but we need more things like this. More boss creatures too.
---
I believe 90%
---
The drop chance was definitely lowered. I don't get nearly as many as I used to.
---
How about a gigantic nuke zone like that glitch shows up on the map sometimes.
---
Do everything in the game... events, storylines, the Queen.  Use cranberry relish, sleep alot, elevate your Intelligence perk, find xp even in the easiest places because it adds up.  It's all about the numbers.
---
Reached level 353... have not done NW or Survival, never been on a team, and just started a couple of weeks ago using vending machines.  I never run out of places to go or things to do.  Right now, I am going to places that gave me difficulty early in the game.
---
Just play!
---
My PSN is hobowithaneedle add me and I'll give you stuff and help you with whatever.
---
They now have dialogue trees, but all of the dialogue options come up blank. You can choose them, and your character says them, but you have no idea what it will be until you have selected it.
---
Yea bowing out when you know you're outmatched isn't a cowardly move. If I get into a match with someone who uses the stealthboy tesla meta you bet your ass I'm bowing out because in order to beat them I have to join them and jumping around like an idiot while everyone's invisible with guns that you don't need to aim is just..... idiotic honestly. On the other hand if you're gonna take the bait and fight back and you don't even have the right defensive and offensive perks you're likely going to fail instantly.
---
As far as I know 90% to each. I tested it and it cannot go above. If you have anything that goes to 100% without the perk, switch the perk card and use something else.
---
The lag is terrible. I ran thru washout, I think it is, with a 4 man team and we breezed thru standard so expert shouldn't be too bad, right? Well, when it takes 2 minutes for the water to drain, another 40 secs or so for the door to activate and before we can even get the door open, mission failed. All because of the lag.
---
Hi, thanks for the tag! Yes, we've seen the community's reports on this and we're investigating them. However, I don't have a timeline to share for a fix yet. Will let you know as soon as I hear any updates.
---
Huh. I'm in there all the time, have never jumped in there haha. I'll have to check them out next time

---
Was this a bug or ?
---
I posted day 1 about people cheating and was met with extreme hostility. It's such a shame that there's no anti cheat, could have been such a great game mode.
---
Oh god, yes!!! I would love to have Pumpkins at my Camp!! üòç I want this to be a thing!
---
Only problem is most people who try to workshop PvP only do so because theyve put a lot of effort ibto getting their PvP gear sorted and minmaxxing to the extreme, so like 99% of the time its someone i dont stand a change against
---
Wtf I thought display cases would protect it, just like a vending machine does
---
I'm late to the pvp game, but it can be really fun. The only thing I dislike is when you melt a guy a couple times and he comes back with a Tesla and stealthboy. As soon as that happens I'm out.
---
Boss creatures would be great. Right now every "boss" is literally just a bigger version of the little guys. SBQ is just an oversized SB. SM Behemoth is just a bigger version of a SM. The Sheepsquatch is the only one that requires a certain mechanic to win, but God help us all because people can't even figure that one out. I miss WoW style bosses that had different things going. Like at certain points damage heals the enemy, or reflects back on you. Anything besides point and spray would be nice.
---
I wouldn't mind
---
This is why I don't take workshops anymore. I'm not here for PVP, and I'm not here to be your target. I'll log off a server any time someone refuses to understand the simple concepts that no really does mean no, and tries to force me into PVP by way of being an annoyance. Screw yourself and everyone else on that server out of my amazing vendor prices, I don't care, people who aren't so effing stupid will be appreciative I'm sure. Some of us never wanted PVP in the first place, as there's plenty of PvE out there to entertain us. I seriously would prefer a non PVP server just so jerks who can't take a hint don't have the option anymore.
---
Downvote this comment all you want, it won't change facts.
---
I knocked out some scorched challenges.  Probably finish off the last two today.  I have a feeling they won't be as plentiful going forward.
---
Not too far off from what we had in vanilla FO4...
---
That feel when you have to grind for a stable server to be able to grind for loot that lets you roll for the chance at a minute upgrade.
---
I'm glad I got my strangler suit early on. It can be fun to do DitW or Washout once in a while, if you get a stable server quickly, but otherwise üò¨
---
Thanks, always very nice when we get feedback from you :)
---
Bummer. Its totally worth the investment of a new controller to have the option of mic'ing in though.
---
I suspect there are a lot of people who would want to play a more traditional TES/Fallout-like experience before 2021 (my current prediction for Starfield), and they would be interested in FO76 if it had living NPCs and dialogue choices, as well as private servers.
---
The bad reputation is obviously a problem, but marketing and a free weekend could help. ESO was also promoted with a free weekend at the time of the One Tamriel update, it would let those who hesitate try the game for free and see it for themselves if they like it. Of course, it should not be possible to play all the Wastelanders content in less than 10 hours then, but chances are at least the later stages of the story would require a high level character and/or progression in the original main quests.
---
Nothing but White Russians in my punch bowl. Everyone should Abide.
---
Your opinions aren't facts, and you sound like a total dick head.
---
Agreed.  My PC mod list for FO4 always includes additional tunes for the radio.  It seems like 76 only has about 12 songs, with half of them on a heavy rotation.  Paying for more music in the Atomic Shop would let Bethesda include more music on the radio by funding the licensing of more music.  It seems like they blew their budget on the Beach Boys Pet Sounds classic Wouldn't it be Nice.  They could avoid sync problems in groups if it is a new station and introduce a new voiced NPC for a DJ (perhaps a Raider DJ from Top of the World or even Rose).  The most memorable NPCs in the series have been DJs, from Mr New Vegas in FO:NV to 3 Dog in FO3 to Travis in FO4.
---
"I love PVP but only when I win, the moment the other guy switches out his gear I'm gonna be a lame ass and quit because while I pretend I like PVP I'm actually just a stupid bully."
---
Fixed it for ya.
---
And to be visited by the great pumpkin.
---
Spikewood lol
---
Bad performance is bad performance. You may be technically right, but you‚Äôre arguing the letter of the problem and missing the spirit of it.
---
Yea, these people you are fighting are not good pvpers.
---
Yeah I love propaganda delivered by eyebots and every radio near military facilities
---
Same. I think there's a kind of unspoken trust among a lot of PvPers thought that if you're gonna spark up PvP with each other that if I don't pop a stealth boy and use a tesla, you don't either, at least this is what I've found 75% of the time. When it comes to that point I'm out because it's not a fun way to play.
---
Seems like 90%, but I've noticed some ammo goes to zero weight (5mm off the top of my head, I think there are others) when my character is in max carry capacity configuration.
---
It is an absolute fact that some jerk who can't take a hint is stupid. It's an absolute fact that some people do not want to engage in PVP. It's an absolute fact that trying to force PVP on someone by being an annoying prat when they've already said no makes the griefer a bad person.
---
Sorry you don't understand the difference between opinion and fact. That ALSO doesn't change the facts.
---
Yea.. I dont like it. Trading and collecting is the only thing keeping me playing. And as a trader, I need to store my stock... that's where my 3 mules wearing full lv1 wwr armor come in.
---
And yeah, I'm the dick head because I refuse to let losers like you force me into PVP? Buzz off little fly, you're not entertaining enough for me to continue this conversation.
---
Cause I told him to pay no attention to the racism. Don‚Äôt see an issue, but apparently some people do.
---
Nice catch!
---
The internet is full of these fake sick people (fake physically, verry sick mentally) and they are enabled by endless internet white knights who can only find purpose in life by providing "support" to these wack-jobs.
---
I wish the mods were pro-active in removing these types of posts.
---
The real life pro tip is always in the comments
---
Not vast enough.
---
You claim bad performance but based on what metric? That the terminals in the raid run in such a way to prevent it from being soloed? Sounds like working as advertised to me.
---
They should respawn in less than a week.
---
Agreed.  My main character is on an XBox.  Playing on my PC just seemed too easy and MUCH less stable.  The only benefit was being able to use "unsupported mods" (which seem to run smoother than the o.g. game code!) to enhance the game.  Go ahead and mock me for using a console, but I do play for hours on end WITHOUT crashing!
---
Sometimes they take a little time to load in, try fast travelling away and back again, ive had it happen with the legendary vendor before when I had logged off at the train station
---
Well since you‚Äôre subbed to oxhorn I guess they‚Äôll HAVE to do something because that matters so much.
---
#ITS THE GREAT PUMPKIN CHARLIE BROWN!
---
Fun fact:  Raleigh Clay's name is actually comprised of two different WV counties.  Raleigh County and Clay County.
---
Craft a .38 auto reciever on a Combat Rifle, and use it for your low level / tag weapon.
---
You'll cut your ammo crafting time significantly
---
You should've turned in the stings and things stuff before scrapping/crafting
---
Or just pre built spots that only are accessible or appear when an area is nuked.  Ex. Caves, more destroyed models of buildings (whitesprings), remove the trees and foliage in an area temporarily.
---
Why?
---
I‚Äôll definitely check a lot sooner then!
---
It's actually pretty fun, except for the long queue times.
---
I really like how you select your spawn point and see everyone else's just before launch. Gliding/parachuting was never much fun for me.
---
If the cheating were mostly gone I'd be playing it quite a lot.
---
First time I fought one was,at the munitions factory, it took over the super mutants and the SAM turrets.
---
Well that's ironic. I'm pretty sure no one remembrs the kid that invented jet.
---
Lol. I don't think jealous means what you think it means.
---
Hi and thanks for the report! Being unable to craft a Hazmat Suit after learning the Plan for it is currently a known issue that we're planning to fix in our next update.
---
I always have multiples of each item ready in my stash so I can do the quest every day as I log in. You're tell me that you farm it from scratch every time you do it?
---
I just want them to be account wide like Atom shop items since they can't be traded. No reason I should have to do all the raids on each character to get what I want for each.
---
I'd really like Vault 94 to be rewarding...
---
I've made lots of Rad Shield this weekend. 
---
Note they are also susceptible to the interact-with-world-container-reset-limit thing ... make sure you do some other stuff too, or they will never reset.

Do everyone a favor and put Ant Lager
---
But dude... we all are in the game...
---
Or your own pumpkin spice latte? Lol jk
---
Ok, bye. Enjoy being killed by people who are better at a game than you.
---
You could always work up to a pumpkin, maybe start with something small like a lemon, and gradually increase size every weak and you have a pumpkin farm in your cave in no time at all.
---
/s
---
On paper, yes. 
---
If they had a serious downside there would be a significant choice to be made there. Significant choice. 
---
Right now mutations are a no-brainer, so the "mutant's" prefix should reflect the cost / risk / downside / difficulty involved (ie, low / none).
---
It's probably just RNG, but I've had the same experience. Went to all my usual spots and barely pulled any scrip this weekend.
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs how it works.
---
In GTA that happens because not many car models are loaded at anyone time (they took up a lot of memory). 
---
The car you have has to be loaded (of course) so it ends up appearing a lot.
---
But who knows.
---
Hahaha wow you really ARE stupid. You can't effing hit me if I'm not claiming a workshop and I'm not attacking back, dumbass. So you enjoy wasting your ammo until I decide you've been stupid long enough and hop servers.
---
You really are not at all intelligent if you don't understand things like this, and I would suggest shutting the hell up until you pull your head out of your ass and realize you're wrong.
---
I suppose asking for Survival mode to return would be too ironic.
---
I can‚Äôt be asked to put in effort so I just sell all junk for 1 cap per.
---
I've had them pop twice now, both times wearing a prisoner collar.  Maybe take it off and put it back on now and then?  
---
Each time was within a week of putting it on.  Haven't seen anything pop since, maybe we can only do it once.
---
With the vendor cap in all the robot vendors, it makes zero sense that you can't sell ammo. It's not like someone is going to get rich selling their ammo. Plus if they were making ammo to sell, the bulk steel, acid and lead would probably get you more caps.
---
Given that i saw somewhere recently the daily active player base is about 40k, every player would have to kill about 530 scorched like right now........
---
Everyone IS on a Level Playing Field.
---
You can go out and buy another account today.  You can go buy another PC today.
---
Nothing about Multiple accounts and/or mule characters is unique to any given player.
---
If you argue that "Its not fair, I can't afford it.  Or its not fair, I don't have 20 hours a day to play."  Then where do you draw the line?  People should only be able to play for 30 minutes per character per day, because that is the time I have?
---
Fairness is equal opportunity.  Not equal outcome.
---
Had the sun came up?  I've noticed if you start the event too late in the night and the sun ends up rising, it's not actually considered a completion.
---
Bloodied meat hook or death claw gauntlet imo
---
My guess is after patch 14 and the Halloween event.  So early November, we might here something.
---
I thought so too! Maybe I had a weird glitch? I‚Äôm going to try it again today and see if it repeats.
---
Lol you are an angry little douche. Sorry you hate yourself so much you have to lash out at others. Actually I'm not sorry though.
---
Yea, I wish the enemies were a one time deal instead of constantly spawning everywhere you‚Äôve already cleared. I walked out (or should I say teleported out since I died after using 50 stimpacks and running out) with 50 of each creatures meat and around 400 acid, so at least it was good on that part.
---
I'm 195 and couldn't complete it myself. About halfway through I realize the lag was going to make it impossible so I just started exploring. I'm on PS4 if anybody wants to help me try to do it üòëüòÇüòÇ
---
Dooms pushback was Id's decision
---
Obviously the best would be meat hook since it benefits from both unarmed and one handed perks (iron fists + gladiator cards), so you can stack quite a lot of damage, especially on a bloodied one.
---
There's no reason to keep bulk steel or acid in your Stash, it doesn't save any capacity. 
---
But bulked lead WILL provide a 50% savings, so just be careful with all those pipes and cans you're collecting üòê
---
MORE BUGS!!!!
---
I enjoyed the raids because it was new content and new lore.  But I won't even attempt the "Meltdown" instance since they took down the Survival server.  It would just be a waste of stimpaks and ammo with the current problems.  Instancing the raid in this case is probably the only way to make this content playable in this engine, but even if it is technically playable, it is far from stable or even enjoyable.  Even the easier flood raid felt more like a battle vs the game itself instead of a battle vs the NPCs.
---
Sadly this. 
---
I'm not expecting new info for at least 2-3 weeks.
---
I also made that point in the post...;-)
---
yea man. Wastelands is gonna unravel Bethesda like Oogie Boogie from The Nightmare Before Christmas.
---
One of these days I won‚Äôt be poor lol
---
Ooh, and another swing and another miss, that's three. You're out. At least you went down swinging.
---
You can't anger me, little man. You aren't important enough. And I wasn't lashing out at anyone with my initial comment, I was stating my own position (and that of others as well). I lashed out at YOU a but because you damn well deserved it. And now you're getting the block because you're too stupid to learn anything from your idiocy and the response to that idiocy. So bugger off.
---
Even a potato computer can run two instances at once. As far as the game code goes... well that's true, but it's also only about $15.
---
Do you mean like place them down or as crops because you can already have pumpkin crops
---
We had 6 people all over the area :/
---
My favorite interaction was having three "raiders" show up to my workshop while I was there. I have a chameleon piece and was crouched behind some stuff so I couldn't be seen, and I'm not 100% built for PVP as I prefer playing PVE style, but I understand the risks that come with owning a workshop. I got my mic and simply said, "hey guys, I don't know what you're doing, but if you wanna take the workshop you can. I'm not up for fighting over a workshop, I just needed the acid" all three of them responded with the raider salute, stuck around for a bit killing enemies there nearby, and then left. Thought they were some cool dudes!
---
I'm pretty new to the game and saw one of these. Didn't know it was rare to see. Didn't attack it because it was level 50 or 60 something like that and I was level 25 or so. It was on my way to get to whitesprings I was following the mountain line and it was up above me on a platue.
---
Yeah thats my only issue here, basically private servers are not "sooner than you think" they are either exactly when people thought or later
---
I use the force.
---
This happened for the NPC "Evan" in the Fallout 4 DLC Nuka World, and for the note in Slocum's Joe in the Forest region of Fallout76, so it is possible, lets just hope that Bethesda actually makes this.
---
That being said, im sorry man, like realy sorry.
---
I'm hoping they announce 'soon' that Wastelanders comes at the same time as FO76 being released on steam and that private servers are just shortly after that.
---
They kind of already have this at the power plant workshops.
---
The Grab will remove it.
---
I think it's mentioned in regards to the Chameleon mutation. It's uneffected by the Garb or by Weighless
---
&lt;gasp&gt; there‚Äôs couriers?! Any idea how I can apply? I made my character a mailman and this is perfect.
---
Strongly disagree.
---
From a practical standpoint, what logic would go into determining a mule? I have two accounts, multiple characters on each. All of them with full stashes and normally within a couple thousand caps of the limit. I only have one mule character and it isn't a level 2. 
---
Multiple accounts/toons have been utilized since the earliest MMO days for both good and bad. There is nothing Bethesda can do to to block 3rd party sites from talking about the game, or being utilized to facilitate trades within the game. It just isn't possible. 
---
The only viable solution would be to completely remove the ability to trade and/or drop items in game. Good luck keeping a healthy player base if something like that is put into effect.
---
You're right.
---
In all honesty, they probably should have said when they're ready as opposed to sooner than you think.  It set a false precedent that people seem to be confused by.  Maybe that's why they've been silent about Wastelanders?  Taking Sean Murray's advice possibly.
---
And you're right.
---
The OP appears to be a troll, so I sure fucking hope they don't grant his wish.
---
We still dont know when exactly even patch 14 will be here, was hoping for tomorrow, but not crossing any fingers :/
---
I gave up on Meltdown due to boredom. Wasting ammo while repeating the same boring task over and over did not qualify as fun. Some ass-hat tried to give me the ‚Äú your gear just isn‚Äôt up to snuff‚Äù bullshit.
---
Bitch, I said it was boring and a waste of ammo. They weren‚Äôt killing me, they weren‚Äôt challenging, they were just a waste of ammo without any loot to account for it. So I quit not because it was hard, but because it was boring and did not pay well. I could go to work and get that.
---
Yeah i been dying for some new information for weeks now.    really hope they announce something/anything soon.
---
I‚Äôm not sure which it‚Äôd be under honestly. Just the wall mounted on and off switch
---
I'll miss you..?
---
I have ran into them twice and each time they, for me, have been:
---
* East of 3 houses (2 demolished and 1 still livable) that are East of the Clarksburg Shooting Club.
---
* North of the Colonel Kelly Monument around the Tractor Trailer wreck.
---
each time I have not had the collar on.
---
I got a level 15 TSE Handmade from a molerat today. Not sure how I feel about that.
---
Maybe, would be nice to hear something though
---
Yeah i hope so
---
If I remember right, acid is one material that actually becomes heavier when bulked.
---
Where was that discussion? I only recall seeing people asking for a mode where everything spawned above level 50.
---
Too late now but could've tried dropping something to make a bag.
---
Rounding 'error'.  There is a weigh, it's just less than the number of the significant digits (what's displayed).
---
So if your wight displays in .01 pound increments, and the ammo weights .004999 or less, it will show a 0.  The weight is still there though.  Drop all that 0 weight ammo and check how much your inventory weight has changed, you'll see it that way.
---
Last ITV mentioned they would detail more about patch 14 in the upcoming ITV.  I'd guess next week as the earliest?  But not sure.
---
[Check this link](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=fallout+76+builds)
---
Yeah I knew that but thanks anyway.
---
You: "yOu Can'T aNgEr Me"
---
Also you: *admits to lashing out to the person you're obviously angry at*
---
My dude...chill
---
This, so much!!!
---
90%
---
So if you have 4 armors that have 20% reduction. That‚Äôs 80% 
---
5 armors would be 90% and you are missing out on the other 10%
---
I have a set of 4 weapon weight reduction and 1 piece that is 20% less food weight.  Such a great combo
---
Oh ffs yet another dumbass who can't read. I'm not even going to play along, moron, I'm just blocking you.
---
I specifically stated that I only attacked him verbally after he had done so for no reason. I'm sorry you're teaching institution failed you so badly that you can't understand such a simple thing, but mostly I'm just amused at your stupidity. So long loser.
---
They are rare to see. High level ones like you seen are better to take on when on a team, as what I did and I'm level 115. They don't scare just I get surprised, have yet to run into one that controls surrounding enemies, those are the ones you gotta watch out for
---
Unpopular opinion but you could always play another game.
---
This dude's insane lol
---
I hope you realize that you're just fueling the fire by raging out, ya silly goose
---
cant get pa plans if you dont run v94.
---
Please start a thread for the cauldron.  That would be so fucking dope!
---
You're right, my bad.
---
He's too busy calling everyone stupid to realize how stupid it is the join a thread of people talking about how they enjoy some PvP and screech at everyone like they pissed in his wheaties.
---
I get great amusement by people raging out for no real reason. I'm not a big fan of PVP in 76 myself, but you'll still find me taking workshops when I need Salisbury steaks or acid. I just use the "stay crouched while I'm there" method, or the "don't carry all my junk on me" method üòÇ
---
Sorry but I never changed my build and I'm unkillable 1 on 1. I even survive 2 and 3 on 1's as long as I can keep you from VATSing me. Up until the nerf most people free aimed but that's absolutely worthless now. VATS is the only way to kill people. The only thing that makes me run is multiple invisible tesla users. Even then I can survive a long time I just can't kill anyone. It's flat out broken.  
---
Also, when I PVP in adventure I'm average to slightly better than average. I am by no means elite.
---
Met them both times while doing the "Manhunt" event. And yes you need the prisoner collar.
---
If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, why should it be a pig?
---
Yeah I think the Garb is counted as Under armour but doesn't allow you to wear armour over it. That and Chameleon was one of the reasons I felt like running a MoM build.
---
I also wanted to see how far it would be viable as I think it should be buffed slightly since you are not allowed to wear any armour with it at all and from what I remember (not running gladiator or pistol perks) the weapons were quite lame for damage which is why I was wondering if people switched to Legendary 44's or Blades.
---
Log off and go outside.
---
Yeah its a tough one really. I personally dont have a mule yet but I have a second character created for if I decide too. I'm level 154 now and between stocking ammo and beggining to collect valuable/useful weapons I'm starting to get to the point where I need one.   
---
There are trusted courriers that anyone can use to do mule transfers. I kind of agree with your perspective though which is why I haven't made a mule yet. I can continue to manage as I am going but its starting to get really tempting to stash some weapons on my other character.
---
Shared offline stash space would be ideal.
---
Thank you!
---
Lmao pretty much. PVP can be fun, I used to enjoy it myself. Now I prefer playing PVE. I know I'm not built for PVP so if someone shows up to try and take my workshop, I'll just leave, or not fight them back, ya know, that IS an option. And it is a risk of taking a workshop. No one is FORCING me to PVP, I'm taking the well known risk of PVP by owning a workshop ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
It's par for the course. It's annoying when it happens but ffs if it makes someone this mad they need to get off the game and go do something else...
---
&gt; It is an absolute fact that some jerk who can't take a hint is stupid.
---
...he said, without any self awareness.
---
Truth üëèüèªüëèüèª
---
scrap the bulk materials when you put them in your stash, problem solved.
---
I feel like the numbers aren't fudged but, let's say you have 2 people on your team. I think if you both tag and kill a Scorched it may count as 2 scorched like you killed one and your teammate killed one even though there was only one to begin with.
---
I was going to wear my Mr.Fuzzy outfit, but apparently it isn't categorized as a costume, so it won't work for the Halloween event...... the majority I planned to wear won't work.
---
Unless they changed something the Fasnacht masks also won't work for the event. :/
---
Bad concept.  Raid should be an event triggered by 4 people but participants allowed from entire server.
---
FUN OVER LOGIC.  Not that hard, this is a video game, make it fun not annoying.
---
Plastic: Pool balls. I was thinking realistically and thought they'd be ceramic. Found out recently they're plastic.They're in containers everywhere.
---
Strangler PA can be only modded via ultracite plans...
---
Thank you for your service
---
Myron?
---
Okie dokie, thanks for adding yourself to the block list!
---
There wasn't anything for me to take a hint *about*, moron. It's PVP tryhards who can't take a hint when people tell them they aren't interested in PVP.
---
Not that it'll matter to you, since you're blocked.
---
That's for sure the best advice. I'll be doing that before crafting anything into the future.
---
I'd kill for a scythe.....or the plague doctor mask back
---
I usually pay 1c per every 5 ammo
---
Procedural generation it general pretty terrible, especially in open world games. I don't want it anywhere near Fallout. Bethesda's worlds are amazing specifically because they're all hand crafted.
---
I didn't save the post but will look for it. Maybe a month ago , I saw a post on here regarding loot respawn time. It said that it's not time based , but instead based on how many items had been looted in the world. And a separate count for loot in containers. I vaguely remember 180 being around the number for world items to reset . Too fuzzy to remember the number for containers.
---
If you are not interested in pvp then why do you go to places where you are flagged for pvp? What kind of stupid person doesn't get the hint that if you flag yourself for pvp then you are flagged for pvp?
---
Cool to know, thanks for sharing!
---
Isn't DCG on par with PF or does it do more?
---
I saw a guy who had all his crafting benches, brewing equipment, fusion generator and 3 vending machines in his bungalow. All usable.
---
Don't know how he did it.
---
I'm just afraid that will get fixed! Good point, though.
---
The info is that it‚Äôs not a major update but by being quiet about it the dumb fanbase can let their imagination go wild and hype it up as basically a new game
---
Probably tomorrow?
---
Bethesda, probably.
---
Meh, have more armour skins than I can use as is, and don‚Äôt care for the look of this one. Without the chance of more legendary weapons it‚Äôs just a huge time sink to me. If it was fun then I wouldn‚Äôt mind putting in the time.
---
My team and I ran and completed standard last night with 4 mins left over. You just have to find a good server. No nukes. Do a watet test. And go into the vault and check the door opening terminal for smoothness. Its a bit of a hassle but if you find a good server its a much smoother experience.
---
Exactly. You can melt me to pieces and I'll gladly come back so I can try and melt you, but if you want to keep taking my caps you best leave the Tesla's at home.
---
You seem nice

I believe in a video I watched on YouTube recently, they made mention to a similar number for items looted in the world, but never mentioned containers. It takes me about a week, maybe a bit less to loot enough items for things to reset. Lately it‚Äôs been more like 3-4 days but world items, I don‚Äôt pay much attention to how long it takes containers to reset though.
---
"Roleplay." Good one.
---
I do wish there was some sort of simple "lock" you could put on things in your stash/inventory to save them from scrapping. The number of times I've accidentally scrapped a needed weapon or component (like that syringer I was carrying so I could club a yao gui to death with or those molerat teeth I needed to add an extra blade) is ridiculous. I know better, but sometimes I'm in a situation where I need to scrap quickly to lower weight and forget...
---
Actually yeah, I'm a fairly nice person, when I'm not getting attacked for no reason. Like most people, ya know? Unlike most people, I'm not one who just sits there quietly when idiots are being idiotic. I say something. Don't like it? Don't be an idiot. In this case, that means don't try to force PVP on people who aren't interested and aren't taking workshops. If you aren't someone who does that, I have no problems with ya.
---
The world has become a very strange place, apparently it's "not nice" to defend yourself and your thoughts/feelings in a subject. Too bad, then, I guess I'll be "not nice".
---
There's a cooldown for sure, but I gave up a long time ago, and I don't remember its duration. 48 hours seems right. You'll have to do some tests.
---
Or even better, do something else! Less chance to lose your mind.
---
hey, just wanted to ask something to understand rules of the game - not that I'm gonna do it;
---
which one of you do you think are bad to put up in a camp? I'll add a), b), etc to make sure you don't have to type any problematic words if the option includes one;
---
a) I love sex  
---
b) I hate americans  
---
c) Go kill someone!  
---
d) Asians are the best  
---
e) Do chems drink beer kill people
---
e) should be OK lol
---
The power armor adds acid to your ranged attacks, making it literally the strongest PA set in game.  
---
Sure it looks bad, but that is what all those skins you own are for.
---
No, its highest. But also needs the most perks. Instigating with swing speed  melee weapons handle almost anything but the end game bosses, I used a ISS baseball bat for the longest time.
---
At some point you literally run out of things to buy, even if you start to play really sloppy and waste a lot of chems and ammo you still end up with more caps than you can spend. If you can't spend your caps on anything you need then you can't sell anything for any reasonable amount (even if you sell everything, including top tier stuff, below 25K).
---
The game needs more ways to spend caps on worthwhile stuff.  They should add some new plans in the vendors, and some of them should be really expensive premium stuff.
---
All the utility items in the atom shop should have been plans for sale in game for caps (like 30K caps so it's not easily obtainable without working for it) and the atom shop should have just sold skins for the stuff.
---
I would have happily parted with a few things I'm hoarding to gather caps to buy a collectron or a fridge AND bought a cool skin for both from the atom shop.
---
Meat hooks an boxing gloves are great if you get swing speed + instigating or bloodied.
---
My screen has gone black several times using VATS in first person melee. My map and HUD are visible, but everything else is glitched out.
---
Obviously I try to avoid triggering it, but it‚Äôs happened a handful of times in the vault raids. Cuz stingwings. They fast bruh.  I‚Äôve literally had to play the blindfolded trust exercise with a friend a couple times to get to the end. Luckily I still get red pips on the HUD map, so I still have some idea of where to swing.
---
IDK what triggers it, but there‚Äôs a side quest to ‚Äúinvestigate Berkeley springs‚Äù
---
True this. I'm a bloodied build full unyielding armor but I still use my instigating over bloodied hook. Its seriously unstoppable even on max lvl mobs.
---
&gt; The info is that it‚Äôs not a major update
---
From the road map:
---
&gt; Embark on a tale with true choice and consequences in Wastelanders ‚Äì our biggest and most ambitious update for 76. Wastelanders will include a new main questline, new factions, new events, new features and even more surprises.
---
Well, at least he won't need a life coach to get over this sick burn.
---
Explosive energy weapons fire a projectle that will have a glitched long range they do not drop anymore but are still available through trades.
---
Yea hasn't updated since late Thursday.
---
Don‚Äôt. Care. 
---
The raid to get them is not fun. So why would I put in what amounts to work due to the repetitive and boring nature of the raid? Why do I need the added attack when there‚Äôs nothing in the WV Wasteland that is hard enough to warrant me needing it in the first place?? And then I‚Äôd have to throw out stuff just to have it waste the last of my stash space???
---
Naw, you can keep all that. I‚Äôm good.
---
Assign one vendor machine for junk you are saving. Box it up with walls that have no windows and doors so that other players can‚Äôt access it
---
May have been the server you were on-sometimes Biv‚Äôs door doesn‚Äôt load in or says inaccessible but a server hop will fix it
---
It's actually pretty easy to tell which workshop owners are looking to pvp. Team of 4 lvl 150 plus hanging around the munitions factory are probably ok with or looking for pvp. Single player owning a workshop or two elsewhere and traveling to and from them to collect mats is probably just farming.  I don't just go ganking low hanging fruit my friend, that's not cool at all.
---
A ton of people take items an just straight up put them at their listed value. I've also seen 10c 2mm.  An I've also seen Bloodied FF Vats cost Handmade for 290c.. obviously bought it. A lot of people playing dont seem to either care or use any form of reference to items value.
---
I am intrested in your findings, though I highly suspect you will find it works.
---
In past 3 weeks or so I've seen several warnings about radiation damage being able to damage you without being in consensual PvP.
---
e
---
As the other commenter stated, it really depends on the legendary effects. I personally use Instigating/Swing Speed/+1Str Supersledge most of the time, it can one shot everything with a single blow and Im okay with that. But when I want to show off at a SBQ fight, i take out my bloodied/40%power attack Meat Hook, set up unyielding/sneak build and can easily do 15-20k damage to the SBQ's head while  stealthy crouching. You have to keep in mind that you can't have Meat Hook or any gauntlets equipped while in power armor, so your weapon choice depend on a situation aswell
---
Then yeah, I have no problem with you or those who think like you do. I just stay out of workshops now because unfortunately not everyone does. And that's fine, removes part of the game from.viability for me, but griefers gonna grief I guess.
---
They'll work out a way to monetize it!
---
No, *you* are doing good work. The Lord's work.
---
Basically scavenging really, cores are easy enough if you catch a break with a power plant(mainly Thunder Mountain), stimpacks come easy as they seem to drop quite frequently(and don't forget blood bags n chemist/chems plus super dupa perks), ammo basically just farm steel and lead with ammosmith and again super dupa.
---
Pretty sure microsoft does beth would have to put that in
---
Agreed. I‚Äôve never played a game where PvP is so imbalanced. It takes considerable time to research and collect the perfect load out to maximize the PvP build you‚Äôre going for. Once you do, though, you can shred most players in less than 3 seconds.
---
I could be wrong, but I don't the the tattered dress removes your armor. It's the garb without the ruffled collar
---
Why probably tomorrow?
---
And all I want is a halloween themed Power fist skin, or just a skin for the powerfist in general ;-;
---
Power User and Full Charge. I passively accumulate cores faster than I use them.
---
Ammo is a grind no matter what (unless you are melee). I use the slow shooting gatling gun with easy to obtain 5mm for 90% of my wasteland slaying. The .50 only comes out when absolutely necessary. Looting and scrapping every weapon on every corpse with the scrapper perk keeps my steel inventory high and all I really have to worry about is lead. 
---
Healing factor mutation helps cut down on stim use. I also heal with water and meat when practical.
---
When you're immortalized in a videogame (or any other lasting thing actually) it's because people want to remember you - not because you want to be remembered by people. Those are similar but vastly different concepts and the latter's achieved through acts of altruism, not by demand.

He who found out that brahmin shit fumes would get you high is immortal!

---
they already announced that private servers will come out in 2020.
---
We will most likely get more information regarding wastelanders either this Thursday or next Thursday
---
Shows 33 million for me. :( We almost made it.
---
I don't need many stims with defense perks and emergency protocols in the PA chest. Fusion cores I just seem to find laying around the place, or as loot from mobs. Never crafted one or used a workshop. As for ammo, I use the ammo efficient gatling gun for most trashy enemies and just break out the .50cal for bosses.
---
Downvoting me as well hah
---
Terminals in general were broken in the last patch (at least for me).
---
Even taking a Possum scout quiz takes almost 10 minutes to answer 5 questions.
---
Thanks but no thanks. This is not how I want to play Fallout. I made a pass on 76 and nothing they are doing is making me want to pick it up. Hope you are enjoying it tho'. Got nothing against people having fun it's just very much not my Fallout.
---
It's not updated yet. I'm pretty sure we crushed it.
---
Worst.  Raiders.  Ever.
---
They updated just a few minutes ago, only 2 Million scorch to go.
---
When did they say that?
---
It‚Äôs possible to change the color of your Pip-Boy however that‚Äôs something you have to mess around with the .ini file.
---
I figured there was probably still a way but, I feel like it‚Äôd be risky given the track record lol
---
Is it possible to hit that goal today?
---
Never have! If I have to cross a body of water, like in FO76 too, I keep my head up, stay above water, don‚Äôt look at it, and just keep pressing forward til I get to the other side
---
Collecting? What are you collecting??
---
Yeah I‚Äôd love to have panic attacks every time I played the game
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/3I7i5lFBPRAUtXcNCZWYFJ/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-meat-week-begins-again
---
search PTS. it originally said private, looks like they changed the wording to public. but I would assume private servers will come out around then
---
If you want something done youll need to spin it in a way that Bethesda's profit margins would go up.
---
It's just been updated. We are at 33,48M.

---
In the north west of the map (aaronholt) you can setup camp with about 6-8 pumpkins in it. Also lots of cranberries nearby
---
I think the sheepsquatch quests are pretty fun and lore is interesting. Brewing quest is fun also, though much shorter.
---
You don't make the grenades with pumpkins. You need the seeds you get from the daily..
---
The average kill rate these past two weeks is just above 2 Million per day, pretty good chance that discount will be ours! :)
---
I remember reading that and it definately said public test servers when i read it, the only info we have with private servers is that they will be "sooner than you think"
---
And only on PC.  I love my white pipboy light, no more sickly green.
---
I don‚Äôt think you need the prisoner collar. I have had this spawn and was not wearing it.
---
It was kind of implied in the recent Inside the Vault articles that the Halloween event will come with patch 14, and the event was already confirmed to begin on the 29th. Then again, it is still possible that the patch would be released one week sooner, and then the event only needs to be enabled on the server side when it begins.
---
Your post gave me cancer. Maybe they will put me in the game too.
---
If Welyn ever started playing 76, we would not only see a MASSIVE influx of players, but a huge push for survival to return. I'd actually be ok with that tbh.
---
Its being held back for Christmas. That's my bet.
---
I only bulk aluminum and lead.
---
I wouldnt really mind, as long as it works when its out
---
Public test servers is something different
---
So you think the raids were purposely designed with massive amounts of lag to make them more difficult to do?
---
If so, that would be the worst design imaginable.
---
No you don't. You have gourds, not pumpkins.
---
Wait, the FEV tanks don't kill you? I always thought they insta-kill you like Fissures
---
That seems much more likely.  I think they've done that before with a past patch?
---
What are you talking about not a major update? They said it is their largest update yet...
---
Me either, but then they look specifically like something one should not jump into.  Now I too will have to take a goo bath
---
this weeks raid is not solo able at all, all the raids aren‚Äôt even supposed to be. i‚Äôm seriously getting tired of people complaining about them when they‚Äôve only tried once or tried to solo it when they weren‚Äôt made to be solo able. please just try to get a team together then try it. (meltdown needs a 4 person team because of the last room)
---
well, it looks like it won't be coming out this year at the least. I would assume they would release private and public test servers around the same time
---
Anything with variants lol. Outfits. Anything "clean" or "pristine." Stuffed animals. Plans and mods I haven't learned yet. Just the completionist thing. Armor sets will be next maybe.
---
Power armor actually needs less repair and resources than normal armor (no need for ballistic fiber).  Farm fusion cores at white springs or by taking over power plants.  Go with a melee build as a primary and a heavy weapon build for boss fights.  This will save you considerable resources.  
---
I wouldn't recommend the bloodied build for PA, you will miss out on the unyielding or bolstering that normal armor can provide.
---
They don‚Äôt! But they inflict more rads than anywhere in-game: 123 rads. You need Radshield or Rad-X combined with a hazmat suit to survive any short length of time. Going in without it will kill you quicker than walking into a nuke zone without any armour.
---
I‚Äôd pay caps to watch that!...lol
---
That sounds pretty awesome! I‚Äôm not a PvP‚Äôer but this does sound exactly how I envision PvP to be! 
---
To me that‚Äôs what PvP is!
---
Ok thanks
---
That's usually because you bulk items to sell them to robot vendors.
---
Assuming they give us the the full day to do it and the cutoff point is midnight their time (EDT for them or PDT? I forget which one they work to) then we're in with a good shot at it.
---
Keep the hammers swinging and the barrels firing!
---
It doesn‚Äôt even look like it‚Äôs moved since Friday... many of the places I went to I‚Äôve seen dead scorch all over... lol
---
Demo expert really isn't worth it since it is only a bonus on the rather small explosive part of the damage or you use a lot of grenades.
---
Me too! Love that someone decided to take a dunk. This makes me want to explore some other shady areas in game I assumed were insta death
---
Same, that would give me time to get a playthrough on Outer Worlds and whatever the hell Death Stranding is lol.
---
I mean they're practically the same thing
---
It's still a damage increase though
---
Needs to be a daily or weekly Bethesda challenge...lol
---
I don't see it as entirely impossible for them to add that as a feature in the future
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôd be enough. I think they need to bring more level up rewards in. When they brought the VTU stuff in I noticed a lot more people playing. Until they had it all unlocked that is.
---
Yeah ive started a minecraft server for the time being at least so im busy pkaying that while i wait for new content
---
Sometimes you just need to walk around the block
---
I've been having problems. My friend has been flush. If he spawns somewhere before me, legendary ratios increase. If I go in first they're trash. It's weird.
---
Do all the challenges listed, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing and looking for plasma grenade plans...lol
---
Funny enough, I actually lived about an foot away from one and didn‚Äôt notice until I returned from an event. I live south of Top of the World and the station next to it for so long and only noticed about 20 days ago (I lived next to one for 3 months).
---
yes bug bethesda knows fix who knows
---
Might be to say, ‚ÄúSorry you didn‚Äôt make it, but you didn‚Äôt know the count so it‚Äôs not your fault and we‚Äôll give it to you since we made a mistake. Great job, loyal community!‚Äù
---
The event or fort defiance?
---
Yeah wouldnt surprise me, although i am a little dissapointed in the wait
---
Thanks for the quick answer.
---
It hasn‚Äôt been updated since last week
---
hold b, also what is your gt? i can help you through it, i‚Äôm extremely experienced with these raids
---
No, this sections off parts of the map for specific levels thus making parts of the map useless for high levels. If you go to a location and the enemies are a high level, server hop.
---
I think the game is much better above level 50.  Especially 15-40 seemed much harder and more resource intensive.  I found the early levels better when doing a 50/50 farm and explore. It could just be that I was familiar with that kind of plan from FO3, NV, and 4 though.
---
Even more lore inaccuracies have been added, its still as empty and as boring as launch with a couple new quests and it doesn‚Äôt crash as much but is still bad and just an embarrassment to Bethesda as a whole. 
---
Also the atomic shop has fallen to new lows adding game effecting content and the prices are outrageous with some things costing ¬£20 for just a skin that works on one type of armour and doesn‚Äôt even look good.
---
If your think of jumping back in don‚Äôt, wait till wastelanders as it‚Äôs just not worth it right now and will only disappoint you
---
Check across thw road from the pumpkin house, there is one in the woods.
---
Due to his past posts and his track record, this seems fake. I'm not saying it is but there is more prof to this not being real then it being real.
---
The event
---
I am still happy playing it, but I am not the obsessive gamer. I play once a week for a few hours If I am lucky.
---
For those 8 hour a day gamers, I would think they would have been done months ago.
---
1.52m to go actually!
---
Since the removal of survival mode workshops have become nothing more than hunting grounds for PvP players and very limited-reward hide and seek grounds for PvE players. I would prefer if they changed workshop PvP to not include ledgendary effects, but I'm not holding my breath. A better alternative would be to bring back PvP events, the monster mash is still in game but the battle for fort Pritchett hasn't worked since release. At least with PvP events players entering know to expect to get shot at. Getting killed while just trying to farm fusion cores does not make for fun gameplay
---
I expect them to be exactly what they will be: reskinned robots with a few dialogue options.
---
I‚Äôm level 106 and haven‚Äôt even tried it yet because all of the people in the 76 FB groups complain about the glitchy-ness of the whole thing all the time.
---
Yes this, there‚Äôs a little camp with scorched there before you hit the fissure site.
---
Well who is wrong when i can shred every sentinel/dodgy/serendipity user in 2-3 shots with EVERY weapon? hell i asked a friend to test and i 3 shotted him with a lvl 15 non-legendary handmade (vats to head, no crit) and he had dodgy, serendipity and a full sentinel set on AND we did it multiple times. you aren't already good
---
What if we keep them very very low, and we are still disappointed?
---
Used to be the case, but not so now. That was fixed when the changes the 10/15 bug.
---
Doubt it, caps almost have zero value to a lot of people who are serious about this game sadly. Too many people have too much time where they have like 2-3 accounts with 4-5 characters at max caps. Really sucks for those who dont because trading is almost impossible unless you have good roll for good roll or rare outfits. If you look at the trading sub sadly things that sell for caps are going for like 4 characters worth of max caps or something insane.
---
I personally only have 1 alt on the same account an hardly play him. But at the stage in the game with my main I'm usually always hovering around max caps an dont really have anything to spend caps on. I have my weapons an armor make my own ammo an food. Have more then enough junk so what else is there?
---
Not having that problem.  I just ran through the Whitespring ghoul loop and walked away with two 3-star weapons and five 1-2 star items.
---
My expectations are equal to that of a small child.
---
We've confirmed we're aware of this issue and working towards a fix.
---
It is an mmo though. Massively multiplayer online game.
---
Lol
---
Rifle Gaming has a youtube video showing what happens when you nuke Ft. Defiance. Excellent flux farming all around the building.
---
Or completing all PA sets from treasure maps. I think I‚Äôm over 750 and barely halfway.
---
A friend has the same issue on serums and Ultracite ammo, we couldn't find a workaround, sometimes he can do it but most of the time he can't.
---
Someone made an entire guide of rare junk items like a month ago that litterally listed everything you have here an then some. If search enough on this sub I'm sure you can find it. I'll see if I still have it saved to link.
---
While that may be why it is disappearing, it does not rule out you being crazy.
---
Neat
---
QE Head is out there (PC), I have one. Haven‚Äôt really messed with it though.
---
Why are there some posts without a Flair?
---
Right, but sometimes you buy things that have been billed, is there a way to debulk them?
---
I want us to get the 50% target but I wont be gutted if we dont as part of me says I'm glad we failed due to the lazy sobs who never took part and thought..ah we will get it and I wont have to do nada
---
I‚Äôve still never tried it.
---
No explosive gamma guns.
---
It's not though. Nothing massive about 24 people per server.
---
FO76 is deliberately a new type of game that takes ideas from many existing types but isn't any of them.
---
Updated for me. 33 million. Just short. :(
---
Did I effect your game? 
---
I have a few miles with leveled equipment on each so when someone is looking for something and I have it I usually give it away and only ask for them to later on give it to a lower level. 
---
I‚Äôve given out tons of ammo, meds and more to players needing it. 
---
I‚Äôve made deep pocketed leather armor and BOS level 1 rifles dozens of times for noobs coming out of the vault plus I drop them stims and food as well. 
---
Now are others selling and buying outside of the game? Yes but it happens on the greater majority of online games and there‚Äôs no way to really police it at all. 
---
Look at the recent du*lication deal we‚Äôre players could get as much steel as they wanted or mines! 
---
I saw mines at every single in game vendor this weekend and those players are still playing... Bethesda could easily see the data by searching for mines or steel... but they don‚Äôt. 
---
If they can‚Äôt do that on their own servers with a glitch that is done in their own game they won‚Äôt be able to even have time to go after anyone who is selling outside of the game if they can‚Äôt control what‚Äôs happening in game.
---
seconded.
---
They don't have a trans flag though, just the rainbow :(
---
Then we can start a post here bitching about it. Or prepare for the IRL apocalypse.
---
I just saw that post. You‚Äôre probably right. I hadn‚Äôt been to the airport for a while before I saw it boarded up.
---
In all of the runs I have done I haven't noticed any significant lag in the raids for some time though the terminals do seem to be slower than normal terminals. That being the case, no lag noted outside of the terminals and the terminals being the main limit to being able to solo it is a logical position with more support than yours which is bare supposition.

Are the numbers accurate as they update when they feel like. How long is left

I have my Pip Boy white too but it‚Äôs glitched for me
---
Done. Thanks for getting back to me.
---
Bro, you need to work on how you express your frustrations. I was on board with what you were saying initially but every comment you made afterwards was worse than the last. You seem like a complete tool.
---
Beer Steins found in Helvetia
---
Yes, but very small for the perk investment, if you have nothing better to use up to 5 perks on then go for it.
---
Hopefully they'll keep counting until midnight Baker Island time.
---
sorry, but this will let people grief by holding key items
---
Wow really? :O Could you some day test it out and share a clip on yt or somewhere? Just for science lol would madly appriciate it. Nice to know that it exist.
---
This is causing me the most concern in regards to Wastelanders. This same tech is meant to be widely used and I just really hope Bethesda has had the time to implement fixes and improvements. I really hope we don't have a bunch of disconnect or lag issues when trying to do instanced Wastelanders quests
---
I mean it's in Intelligence. So aside from QoL perks why not go for the small amount of damage increase if we're min/maxing? It's the only other damage boost and you can't put those points into any other special to take other damage perks that you're not using already
---
Where are you seeing that? It isn‚Äôt updated for me.
---
Not really its a very easy goal, we failed plain and simple. No participation trophies in life. Learn it  now rather than later.

---
Try F5?
---
No, its still an mmo.  Its a online game where you can roleplay and with trading out players there is no limit to who you meet. It has communities, factions (soon) and is only online.
---
It was even announced as the first fallout mmo. It just is. Idk why that bothers you
---
Haters gonna hate, huh? I was just sharing my experience after 1.5 weeks. I faced 2 crashes and some minor in-game bugs, nothing special that any other similar game won't have. And yes, I met nice people while I was expecting "usual" online gaming attitude (and I'm not new to gaming at all. including professional scene).   
---
I'm not saying it's the best or perfect. But it's not nearly as bad as most think of it (including me before playing it).   
---
Maybe I was expecting a different things than you. I wanted "Fallout atmosphere" and kinda familiar world. Facing no "people" (npc) is kinda weird, but oh well. Not any idea is going to be great and this one wasn't. Is this a reason for bitching like that? :D
---
Just google, is fo76 an mmo
---
Even if adventure mode doesn't interest you, Nuclear Winter can be fun, but it can be chore at first because you need to unlock certain perks to get the edge.
---
Yeah the area between the golf course and the parking lot is a random creature spawn
---
I remember watching Kevduit do his playthrough and they literally had to go in with four members, and each one had to know exactly what to do and when, and run ahead off on their own to get everything done in time. Making something have less time to complete doesn't make it harder, it makes it more obnoxious. Like, they couldn't give us MORE enemies all at once, or STRONGER enemies that are like, stronger based on whatever level you are, no, let's just make it so that you have to do it in less than two minutes, while the game decides whether or not it's going to load quickly or not.
---
That's a shame, but also would be probably the most unfair fight to come across  if it did exist haha
---
Yes, just scrap as normal to break back to "loose" components again - but you won't get the 2 plastic used to create each bulk item
---
I‚Äôm not pinching pennies that hard damn haha
---
\- also me
---
I'm basically done with a pistol build and they are fun at all levels. I'm doing an Unyielding/Bolstering (3:2) running primary auto pistols and secondary auto rifles.
---
Fusion cores are not hard to find. The only time I ever came close to running out was when I was carrying a Gatling laser. With the right perks, your armor will use them so slowly you'll be up to your eyebrows in fusion cores before you know it. 
---
If you're worried about running out of ammo, get a nice two-handed melee weapon and then you won't need ammo. But once you get the Excavator set and make a trip through Lucky Hole, you'll be able to craft all the ammo you ever need. That's not really a PA-specific concern, though.
---
Stimpacks are even more abundant than fusion cores. Get Healing Factor if you don't have it already. It'll heal you when you're out of combat, lessening the number of stimpacks you'll need by a lot. You could also get Herbivore and carry melons in lieu of food, water, and healing. The DR on PA is pretty high though, so you won't be taking nearly as much damage as you're used to.
---
With all that said, PA is still pretty weak compared to regular armor with the right legendary effects. I played PA-only from the time I could get into a decent set (around level 30) up until the low 200s when I finished a set of Unyielding and started adjusting towards a Bloodied build. I only pull out the PA for nuke zones and mining expeditions now, and it is such a downgrade. Most of the advantages of a low-health build are gone when I step into PA and lose my regular armor. Carry weight is lower, I do less damage, etc.
---
1.5 million short due to disconnects... Throw us a bone

I think they move the spawns around or something? Nobody talks about so not sure if it's my rng. I started running fort defiance on the 8th of October (I know because I'm keeping account of what I find 6 brown 2 green and 1 Forrest uniform so far if your interested lol) it's chocker block with legendaries atleast 2 most servers. I've mad easy 150k+ since then selling the 2*/3*. Again I know as I've been putting my caps into ammo as it weighs nothing for me and still acceptable trade. I've had as many as 5 legendaries in there with 3 being 3* at one time.
---
Yeah lets earn 30 atoms a day for 7 days sale on a 1400 skin.... or 1800 bundle :D
---
Tattered dress is what people where for the MoM look, but still wanting armour. 
---
Or because they don‚Äôt like the ruffles.
---
Hasn't updated for me also.
---
Yeah, I'm going without PA, so that isn't a concern. I'm also planning on running Instigating Swing Speed, which is what I have on my Power Fist, but I'm finding it doesn't always 1 hit kill Super Mutants. I'd go for a heavy hitter like the Super Sledge, but I'm afraid the slow swing animation will mean more time between targets, so I'm trying to find the weapons with the highest per hit damage that are also Medium SS.
---
Well the tracker is stuck with 11-something million to go so we've really no clue if it's achievable
---
Is the doing the raid for 94 PA even worth it because it seems time confusing and frustrating
---
Yup... I know... :(
---
Got it, thanks
---
Looks like I was wrong, lol. We missed it by 1.5m. That's all. And they didn't just cough and accidently tip the number over for PR. I don't know whether to praise the devs for their honesty or shake my head at how oblivious they are. So many people who really put the effort in to spend their game time grinding Scorched will be so disappointed, and some probably lose any interest in booting up for a while.
---
I didn't lose all my items, but I did manage to use up the 85 stimpacks I had saved up and still died and failed the thing.
---
Very disappointing.
---
2 million by the end of today is possssssssssible.
---
I'll do it in the next couple hours and see what happens
---
Its just such a embarrassment in gaming when your one and only raid isnt really interesting to begin but is just pure broken.
---
Regardless this looks pretty bad on Bethesda. The game has such a problem with populations that we couldn't kill 35 million of the most common enemy?? God damn man, this is the start of Trouble
---
Before I used a mule I made enough caps from making and selling ammo with my only character to buy almost all vendor plans, half the serum recipes, full vanguard set, etc. a few months ago. 
---
Even if I made 15 more mule accounts with their 5 characters each, then went through the work to fill their stashes and vendor clear up to 30k each, none of that should really impact *you* because I could never get such a stranglehold on the economy to make an impact.  
---
It may seem unfair, but many people use mules because they want to collect or sort materials. It‚Äôs not malicious for most (I presume).
---
There's still all of today to meet the goal! We know you can do it, one last big final push! The website will be updated again tomorrow with the final count.
---

---
 &gt; There's still all of today to meet the goal! We know you can do it, one last big final push! The website will be updated again tomorrow with the final...
---
I'm unclear on when exactly it ends. We might still have about 23 hours, if they cut it off when the daily/weekly atom challenges roll over tomorrow. That's the same time as when seasonal in-game events like Meat Week ended, but those were always accompanied by server maintenance.
---
If you simply get in your shop, set it up to extract your materials and just pop back in occasionally to gather you're most likely not going to get killed. People act like there's multiple people hiding in every bush waiting at all times. If someone has that kind of patience then just back out because they're some sort of serial killer lol.
---
I have googled, and its a Multiplayer online game but its not an MMO. Bethesda said as much pre launch.
---
I don't know why you want it to be an MMO so much, but it's not.
---
The definition of MMO, is a game with hundreds to thousands of players online at once playing on the same server in the same world.
---
24 players does not qualify.
---
Brass Miners Lamp is at the Purveyor's Shop in Berkeley Springs.
---
Hmmm check the dates of that stretch goal 17-21st....
---
Awesome! Thanks for the clarification! Gonna load up on Scorched Skin after work!!
---
The souvenir magnet cow is on the side of a fridge at hillfolk hotdogs. Unfortunately it displays upside down though.
---
Oh nice!
---
Even 40% would be awesome, it's incredibly silly that a handmade weighs 50% more than a naval cannon
---
I believe you are looking at the dates of the sale/rewards.
---
What are atoms made of?

Why do scorchbeasts shit green?

Indeed, these are questions that may never truly be answered.

Perfect pirating Skyrim reference.
---
Awesome, thanks so much!
---
I‚Äôd like this as a seasonal or event based thing that requires lots of junk.
---
Yep it's a reflection on them if we fail
---
14th isn‚Äôt over yet, Friday it was 23 million and today it‚Äôs over 33 million... 10 million in 2 days... we got this!
---
Thanks val..top man
---
Stay away from our scorch breasts!
---
The whole thing has been unclear, from the total lack up in game updates and announcements to the manually updated Scorched count, I wonder how many players had no idea this even was even running?
---
Funny thing is I'm not here to please you, or kowtow to what you or others want or think I should say. This is called standing up for yourself, and it's actually a feature, not a bug. I'm sarcastic, I'm sardonic, when people rile me I'm definitely abrasive. Because I'm not a pushover I should work on how I express myself? No thanks. But hey, I do want to say that I appreciate you not being an ass. Sorry you think that of me, but I'm not going to stress over it all that much, because I know me better than that, and honestly, you're just some person on the internet. This little slice of me tells you nothing. And that's fine.
---
I'm confused about this post. If the workshop is unowned doesn't that mean they logged off and aren't using it anymore? Im on PS4 so there's not really alt accounts around.
---
We killed 10+ million in 2 days... pretty sure we got this!
---
But he's a Zetan and it wouldn't be cannibalism. It would just be carnivous. Just to be that guy.
---
Nice! Thank you!
---
About 170 per shot on the automatic version
---
We failed the final stretch and don't deserve the final reward, but calling it very easy is not accurate.  It is no exaggeration when I say I killed 1000s in the last two weeks.  Long play sessions dedicated to killing scortched.  The community is to small now and I rarely had a full server when I  jumped to reset spawns.
---
We got this, time to take out the scorched trash.
---
Exactly, my sniper rifle weighs over 18lbs. More than several "heavy weapons" I've picked up.
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
Every time I try, the massive numbers of enemies cause my tesla rifle to proc the DPS cap or something, and then I can no longer do damage to anything. Too many arc targets and too high a fire rate always cases this, but most commonly at the vault or nuke zones.
---
Kill them üòÇ get the loot (that's not that good tbh)
---
Wouldn't say a reflection on them. It was an incredibly easy benchmark they set. A game with a healthy population wouldn't have any trouble clearing 35 mill of any enemy really. WoW or ESO wouldn't have trouble clearing their most common enemy, definitely. Especially if they were given three whole weeks. It's a reflection on the game's population, that's all
---
I've seen it happen before. Updating the page won't actually update it.
---
Thank you!! I spent way less money moding it then if I was to buy the official mods.
---
Yeah no problem.
---
It seems to auto scrap alphabetically, so bloatfly glands and bloodbug proboscis are before "bulk acid"
---
You're welcome. To add to that I'm pretty sure I got the souvenir sloth and teddy as rewards from the Play Time daily quest in Berkeley Springs.
---
Yeah hopefully, but at what point today does it end, i hope it's midnight ET but I've not seen that anywhere, also the weekend is over so playing hours in general will be severely reduced.
---
I agree with you. Go ahead and downvote me too, snowflakes!
---
Play a different game, try warframe since it's free
---
&gt; also in one of the burrows photos we saw one of the devs in the diver armor from fallout 4
---
That stuff make me so angry, why the hell do they show it to hype a dungeon if they are not even going to add it to the Atom Shop.
---
Anyway, the things you added to the level 2 sound really fun. I hope they add stuff like that at some point because the perk system has so much potential.
---
Bethesda will just change on the servers all scorched to ghouls or feral ghouls so we cant hit the mark..... they've been messing with us since the game was beta
---
This delusional person obviously thinks the world revolves around them and they're the only one who really matters. Best not to try and reason with them, because look, they even said the one person defending them doesn't matter. What a horribly angry bitter little person.
---
Hmm, its strange your ISS powerfist doesnt one shot them, are you using all required perks? Iron fist lvl3, Incisor lvl3? Also always try to squeeze the most Strength out of armors/perks etc. The only weapon (except meathook) that can top your  powerfist is deathclaw gauntlet since it has a little bit more base damage. But the swing speed coupled with Martial Artist is actually not that slow on sledges, plus you only need a regular attack to kill mobs (no need for a slower power attack)
---
Do you understand, however, why people would complain that it feels lame to be unable to do a mission not because of its difficulty but because of the technical inadequacy of the game ?
---
I don't mind dying when I pull too many mobs. I mind dying when it takes me too long finding out if a door is or not able to open since pressing its button doesn't do jack shit three times out of four.
---
Add to that that there's absolutely no "intellectual" part to the raid. Running circles in a room trying to discover small hidden red stains while being pursued by ghouls is not "fun". It's boring and incredibly lazy design. 
---
So yeah, sure, it's made for a team. But even as a team, the event is boring and borderline impossible to do since being a team causes lag.
---
Yall keep fighting, this was a fun read.
---
I, too, would like an ocean update for the game set in a land locked state.
---
Is that some sort of poor joke I'm too rich to understand
---
Sheep squatch club is one hand medium speed. Has highest base damage for that class.  Imo, thats the strongest.  It can out dps 2h slow weapons by sheer number alone.  Check out captain noob that for proof.
---
Lol they blocked me but you can continue to see them lash out at even people who are kind of defending them. Really a strange person.
---
I play it as often as possible. Granted, I'm not saddled with bugs and issues, so that's probably a huge factor.
---
Thanks for the edit
---
do you have the right flavor fruit punch? some serums need grape, others need cherry, some need blueberry
---
It is absurd what rifles weigh. But I think it's kinda fair....I mean they do need to have some sort of down side to using them...... In the essence of balance (may not be a popluar opinion). What else could you do? 
---
Rifles could have packing light and swap tank killer to pistols?
---
Rifles need weight reduction, pistols need armor pen and stagger.  That would be a fair trade wouldn't it? Can't ask for a buff and not give something up if you're already one of the best classes in the game.....
---
,
---
Yeah I don't know what the deal is. I've got Iron, Incisor and Martial, Talons and Twisted. I'm over 15 Str but sometimes it just doesn't do it.
---
I did a Whitespring run last night and got pissed because there was a 3-star super mutant suicider that I noticed the second before it exploded itself. It was going after a group of snallygasters and as soon as I locked onto it in VATS it blew up, so I decided to server hop and try again. The next time around the Whitespring I got around 5 legendary ghouls, so it more than made up for the lost legendary I didn't get to tag.
---
I think the spawn rate for legendaries all depends on the server. Sometimes you get a ton, sometimes you only get a few. And if you do any events that spawns waves of enemies, you get multiple chances of legendaries spawning. I do an event that I've never seen anyone at except once and that event yields 2-3 legendaries every time.
---
Has to do with the cache in the browser. 99% of the time a "Force Refresh" or "hard-refresh" does it.
---
2 min queue isn‚Äôt that bad, I know games with 30 min ones
---
Wastelanders will bring game breaking bugs that Bethesda will acknowledge they exist, but avoid every possible opportunity to actually fixing it without breaking something else.
---
It did the stingwing barbs and torn mothman wings before it opened the bulks too. It also did the minitures before it opened the steel bulks.
---
Interesting. I wonder how that compares to fully perked Meat Hook and Power Fist?
---
Do what I do, and wear power armor before you camp travel. You never know when you might literally travel to a player trap. Fast traveling to camps, and going to nuke zones are literally the only reason I use PA.
---
That part of the game that's removed you're talking about is the last part that's left for pvpers. Enjoy the 90 % pve based game you have and let them enjoy the 10%.
---
Same. Other than the server disconnects once in a while, I really haven't encountered any bugs.  I enjoy playing it as often as I can and dont give a crap about all the negative things people say about it.
---
I sorta... immediately ate it.  :|
---
I just put verything up for 25 caps
---
Welp, I know what I‚Äôm doing for the next 8 hours now
---
Yea, theres very little water
---
Yeah week two blows, my team doesn't even play it, and now that survival servers are gone good luck with the god damn lag. Using a survival server we would finish a standard difficulty run on the week 1 raid with about 20 minutes left, now depending on lag it is somewhere between 1 and 3.
---
Idk what the solution is, but before the vault 94 raids are released they need to do something
---
I don't have a clip of it sadly.  But I don't think I heard a scream, just the general mothman sound effect.
---
I usually sell items for what I would buy them for personally. All ammo is 1 cap, plans for about 25 caps.
---
Paging u/BethesdaGameStudios_ **&amp;** /u/valseek

go pick up about 200 things afterwards and youll be good to go

Okay if you google is it an mmo it says, "Yes, Fallout 76 is an¬†MMO¬†but here's why it could be the one for you. Dozens of players will be on each server, not hundreds. ... It's¬†a MMO, but there aren't hundreds of players on the same server as you, running around and generally breaking your immersion (a concern for all us¬†MMO¬†newbie"
---
Yes it is an mmo

Every time I pass through Morgantown airport I think the same thing... why cant I plant these in my camp..? And on a somewhat related note.. HOW THE F does this world function without the ability to brew coffee!!?!??! If the nukes didnt kill me, I would die from lack of coffee intake.
---
EE handmade?
---
Eh your just just guna have to suffer like the rest of us that cant always sign in every day. Sometimes you just miss stuff
---
How you treat other people matters, dude, even on the internet. There's a difference between not being a "push over" and acting like a complete dick. The way you worded your frustrations from the get-go was aggressive and instigating. 
---
I couldn't care less about whether or not you're trying to please me, I'm telling you that you keep up that toxic nature of yours and eventually it's going to bite you more than some dudes on the internet telling you that you're a douche bag. I'd suggest you find an outlet for your frustrations that dont involve other people.
---
Enjoy your day.
---
Oh nice! I'll have to try that then as well!
---
Saves you time for the daily at least?
---
I never run out of fusion cores, even if I'm in PA most of the time. If you find yourself running out of fusion cores, just destroy some sentry bots at Whitespring. The Gatling Gun is extremely ammo efficient, so you might want to try to find a decent one. An explosive Harpoon Gun with the shotgun mod makes it so that you never have to craft ammo for it since you will get more harpoons than you shot when you loot corpses, tho the weapon is pretty slow. The Gatling Plasma is also pretty efficient and is the 2nd best heavy weapon (unless you find a legacy one, which is, hands down, the most OP ranged weapon in the game). The LMG is the best non-legacy heavy weapon, but it's probably the most costly weapon in the game in terms of ammo usage, so only use it for tough enemies if you find one.
---
As for the PAs themselves, they take a ton of time to actually break. I have managed to play with the same PA set for over 3 weeks before it actually started to break.
---
PA also comes with decent damage resistances right out of the bat, and bloodied builds can be pretty tanky, especially with the emergency protocols mod which reduces damage taken by 50% while below 20% health. The PA with the best damage and energy resistance is the T-51b, but it has the worst radiation resistance. The Strangler Heart PA has the same damage resistance and the best radiation resistance, but a tiny bit less energy resistance. This PA can be OP because of the set bonus which adds acid damage to attacks. It gets ridiculous while using fast weapons like the minigun to the point that it can actually crash your game. If they make it so that each hit increases the acid damage that the target already has instead of adding a separate acid damage, it should no longer cause lag or crashes.
---
One problem I always run into is that I can't use my T-51b PA set most of the time because I'm always overencumbered, so I use the Excavator PA instead. I switch to my T-51b when fighting the SBQ because I don't have to move that much.
---
All in all, heavy PA builds are probably the easiest to complete since they don't use legendary armor. You could argue that to really complete a heavy build you need the Strangler Heart PA, but at least it doesn't require as much luck as finding the perfect legendary armor set.
---
I heard about that, does it have to be items sitting in the world or can it be looting and mining too?
---
Aqua boy also works in there. Then you take 0 rads...
---
Anything sitting around. Not enemy drops. They need to be items sitting out on a table or such.
---
Best Raiders Ever !
---
I was gutted as I didn't think to hit record until a few mins after so missed it, but those mininukes missing me by inches were amazing, almost felt like it happened in slow motion.
---
Same man and these moments are great, it's a shame about the whole stealth boy/tesla meta as there's nothing really tense or unique about those situations. Stealth boys piss me off even more in Nuclear Winter.

Each tank also has a "cap stash" in some of the containers. I got 120 out of one.

I love the game most days. I get to play with my friends, literally all I've wanted since 3, and aside from bugs, trolls, and way back when, griefers, and so called "raiders", I've had a great time. Some days the bugs are bad enough that I need a short break, and sure  it gets tedious some days, but I still love the game. What I don't like is the way Bethesda treats the game. They can never seem to actually fix the bugs, and yet they still pump out atom shop items that cost the same as full dlcs did in past games. They "balance" perks by basically destroying them, then add pay options to make the grind they forced by doing so into the shop to give the option to "pay to make it suck less" as Gopher so aptly put it in his opinion video. If they could get their act together, and make the prices for the shop reasonable, as well as removing all the non-cosmetics they lied about never adding, I'd like it even more. The game would be amazing if they could un-nerf the perks they shat on, and rebalance the weapons they nerfed to shit because of the dupers, and speaking of the dupers...make it VERY clear that shit won't fly by console banning them, instead of just banning the account. Dupers would be far less likely if they would just get their entire system blocked. Tldr: it has plenty of issues, but I still love the game, I just wish they would get their shit together, and fix certain issues.

Wolf ribs won't go in the fridge either . Did a defend event got tons of them and they wouldn't transfer in . Kinda sucks ... 7 dollars for a camp item that's half broken lolll

---
The vault tec alarm clock can be found inside the asylum/fort defiance. 2nd floor I believe. It's kinda longwinded to go into details here. It's in one of the room on top of a dresser I believe.
---
It will be the norm for bethesda. It will be full of bugs, but be good enough that we will keep playing. People keep coming back, game after game. Even with the bugs they still make awesome RPGs.
---
I think it has the dna of a fun game, but has been so gimped by bugs and mismanaged post release development that it, as a whole, just is too buggy and prone to disconnects the realize the potential of the world.  It can be a very frustrating experience and has gotten worse over time, which is not a good trend.
---
It has a lot of potential and I look forward to giving it another shot with Wastelanders.  I hope their developmental goals veer toward the main game, story and stability, which is joked about for so many game patches industry wide, rather than short lived alternative modes and garbage on the cash shop.
---
/u/valseek do you know when the exact deadline is?

This might be the bug effecting Ultracite and nuclear material. It doesnt take out of the stash correctly.  Take all the mats that you use to make the serum out of your stash and then put them back. It should fix it if its the same thing happening.
---
Right on. Thanks for sorting by new
---
I find it really hard to get INTO the damn thing - and every time I do, the whole game freezes and shuts down.  Blue error page.  So annoying.  There are too many overgrown plants too that, although looks cool and unique in the game - I can‚Äôt see shit!
---
On PC, people are using two accounts to do what I am describing. They log both onto the same server and do not group. Claim a workshop and build it up on one account, logoff while leaving the other on the server so they can later rejoin. Every 15-30 minutes they log the second account back on to empty everything out.
---
Some simple mechanics in the game make it relatively easy for them to go unnoticed. As long as nobody else grabs the workshop, the server automatically gives it back to them when they log back on. With the map constantly being buggy and not showing proper real time workshop states, they can come and go largely unnoticed unless you happen to be standing in or near the workshop when they do it.

---
How am I shitposting? I'm literally just pointing out a common mistake here that many people laugh about. I remember your name, and literally everytime we argue all you do is resort to insults.
---
Grow up, dude. You're pathetic. My comment hurts literally no one and despite that, you found it necessary to provoke another argument. Who deserves to get banned more here?

Go out and socialize with people or something dude üòÇ You're so bitter, maybe video games shouldn't be your entire life.

I have a extra calibrated shocks plan for the ultracite. Power armor. I know the plan just trying to sell mods and stuff for the ultracite power armor at my vendors but no one wants em.
---
And old bugs coming back too.
---
My punchbowl's on my Mothman altar. What else *could* I put in there? =P
---
There's a duped bloodied explosive fixer with faster reload going around on PC so obviously there is still an issue with duping.
---
To make matters worse there are OP legacy  weapons still in the game that dupers have an endless supply of so anytime a new weapon/armor piece is found in game it's almost guaranteed that a duper is going to win the bid on it 
---
It's sad that one year into the game these issues still exist.
---
Yes and I'm sure the minigun would weigh more in real life as well. Or any of the other heavy weapons.
---
Eh, it takes less than a minute to do if you know all the close spawns.

Playing FO76 solo gets boring quick find people to play with the adventures and mishaps you experience really make FO76 fun add me on pc if you want discord is **TEKYTECH#9464**
---
Which is why I wish they'd just give us two different server options or bring back Survival. I don't want to begrudge people who enjoy PVP their fun. I have a difficult time believing their fun should negative affect mine. Because it shouldn't. I didn't make the decision to kill Survival. And as I've repeatedly stated, I no longer take workshops for this exact reason - this conversation is getting far too repetitive, tbh. I'm just gonna disengage entirely, which is what everybody wants me to do here anyway.
---
you could only find The Porselein Stein during the fasnacht event
---
Oh... Oh no...
---
That is what is called an opinion piece not a fact. There are lots of those for either side of the argument. 
---
FO76 does not fit the definition of an MMO. Fact. 
---
 Todd Howard described the game as " an online Multiplayer survival adventure" Fact. 
---
If this is not enough evidence for you then fair enough, believe what you want to believe.
---
What build do you run now?
---
Damn lol
---
I absolutely love the game. Coming from other survival games like ark survival I'm fine with making my own fun and running my own quests. 76 is very grindy but I kinda enjoy that aspect alot. 
---
 I pretty much role play as a trader /shop keeper right now and just running the store is enough to keep me grinding gear and materials. It's very rewarding using the caps I make to buy something I want, while knowing I've helped other players. When Bethesda said they waned us to become the NPCs they kinda succeeded with the vendor implementation. 76 is a RP dream right now! 
---
I do however find certain bugs and crashes on ps4 very frustrating and this is unfortunately immersion breaking at times. Also the main quest line was very tedious but I still enjoyed it and hopefully Wastelanders will improve the questing aspects something fallout normally nails. 
---
Overall, I think fallout 76 is an aqiuired taste, you kind of have to live in the world if that makes sense. It requires a lot of time investment and imagination to get the most from it. I believe 76 will go from strength to strength in the coming months and years. 
---
(feel free to use any of my opinions) good luck with the video ‚ò∫Ô∏è

im talking about IRL.
---
My sniper rifle weighs 29 pounds.
---
553 hours in and still try to play daily. They keep adding content in little pieces to keep things interesting. Nuclear winter is a lot of fun, I‚Äôm not a huge BR fan but it works well and still feels like fallout. The Morgantown map is a ton of fun. I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing what happens next with the game mode and def looking forward to new main quests in adventure.
---
Idk why I didn't do this. Someone I ran into built their camp on a power tower. I built my home on a cliffside with water underneath for a large purifier. Might go through and actually screen shot some stuff and post it here
---
I was expecting her to talk, and tell us about her journeys. I was very disappointed üò¢
---
From then to now, things hardly feel different. Sure a lot of the old bugs are kind of gone, but still a lot of bugs exist and only more get added with each new patch. With the small amount of new content that we get, a lot of it doesn‚Äôt feel substantial or fulfilling enough either. The most fun I did have was during fafsnacht and meat week, and constantly grinding for the new items. After paying $60 for a game that was worth at best half that price, it feels like a slap in the face when they care more about adding new weekly micro transactions, whether they are vanity or actually provide in game benefits. I wanted to like this game but it just has such a small amount of content, and with wastelanders I hope they deliver a solid chunk, but if it‚Äôs like the previous new content in anyway, then this game will never become a full game worth $60.
---
Helps a lot., thanks! Just gonna have to keep grinding and pay attention to my build.
---
Click and drag the map you cannot view it in one screen.

The first time I saw him (her?) it was in the pink trees in the Cranberry Bog. The second time was at Whitesprings, but more towards the back of the main resort area. In the CB I was only a level 11 exploring and ran away immediately from anything monster-ish. (So... Everything.) The second time, at Whitesprings, I was a level 24 and engaged him and another player helped me kill him. 
---
One of my regular teammates saw him last week right outside of his camp (on the edge of the Ash Heap near the Nuka Cola plant) but he vanished right after.
---
Not everyone is a complete dick and yes it requires some strategy 
---
I took Poseidon then got into some PvP at a train station with a number of players.  Was a bit chaotic as the stealth and Tesla boys were in full effect but did kill a couple before they claimed revenge and they got me back in numbers. 
---
Anyway, I head over to the golf club to kill some ghouls and lo and behold one of the earlier PvP victims (he was lvl 50) that I killed earlier starts to challenge and decides to take my shop.  I didn‚Äôt defend it. Then he shows back up at the golf club with his buddies to PvP again.
---
Point being he was expecting me to defend the workshop and I would have been slaughtered because they had numbers.  Not like lvl 50s but his other two teammates were my lvl (250+) which Tesla‚Äôs and explosive lazers.  Needless to say I tapped out.  Got to know when you don‚Äôt have numbers in your favor.
---
Are you serious? Why is that a thing?
---
oh u sweet summerchild
---
Best bet, find your item, then run through lucky hole mine with excavator armor on
---
Another guy on ps had it too. on adventure
---
Ive played a lot of Nuclear Winter on PC and I've only seen one concrete example of cheating (complete invincibility). I reported him with video evidence and he was banned. 
---
There are players I've seen get tonnes of kills and win match after match, but I've also played with those players (randomly assigned to their team) and won against them, so I think they're just good, not cheaters.
---
Apparently its an eldritch creature since before the war, but we just dont have rnough evidence to back that up.
---
But sometimes it works out.  I was able to farm some cores but then decided it was time to move on. 
---
I think where people get twisted is they invest so much time and mats and get ganked because they stick around too long.  I mean, don‚Äôt get greedy and don‚Äôt overbuild the shop.  If you do, chances aren‚Äôt you will get worked over and lose all your shit especially at Poseidon or the ammo factory.
---
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. In game my sniper rifle weighs more than a minigun.
---
Problem with shared stash is it kills part of the scavenging/learning process. I tried it with a character of mine, who received optimal underarmor, armor, weapons and ammo from my other characters. Waaaay to overpowered at level 10. No challenge at all.
---
Good luck, I usually find a pet every 4 months. But I don't server hop for them.
---
Are they rare? I just came back to the game last week after only playing for a couple weeks at launch. Saw one the other day and ran because it was creepy and like 30 levels higher than me lol
---
You just eat the coffee, no way to brew, ignore the luxbrew coffee pot and hotplates.

Bloodied heavy weapons. Gatling gun is my go-to and I keep a primed ultracite Gatling laser for SB/SBQ/Sheepsquatch encounters. I do okay except when a mirelurk king or queen look at me funny. Then I die fast for some reason.
---
I'm not sure I follow. I don't have much experience with TS weapons aside from the plasma. It is exceptionally inaccurate outside of critical hits. Does TS miss a lot on hitscan criticals? Maybe Plasma being projectile makes it better?
---
You have to land the final blow for the sbq one to complete.
---
So the point is to own workshops on 2 servers?
---
because the map is big
---
That is exactly right.  Pop in and out.  If you stick around too long the cap hunters will take notice and mobilize against you. 
---
It never ceases to amaze me how some players set up the shop and just hang out for like 30+ minutes.
---
That‚Äôs a recipe for disaster
---
You can get the metal en wooden beer stein in helvatia
---
It says it should be available today.
---
Bloody builds use 3 points for nerd rage
---
That happened to me as well. I just kept server hopping and I got it after a while. Sometimes it takes a few minutes for things to fully load in too.
---
As a destiny player, this is not wow you do a fps raid At ALL
---
Unfortunately this isn‚Äôt the first time this happened last time it was a BE Handmade I bought with my first 25k but this incident was crazy because I seen it happen half way through reload it just went into thin air
---
I dont want that, I like to see other viewpoints. It's what drives the game.
---
Thanks dudes. That has been my only issue so far and turns out it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm bad. I‚Äôve really been enjoying the hell out of this game.
---
Yeah, same. But ATM it just feels like I waste. I want to SELL it.

I'm far enough away to just have 2 turrets.  They do all the work. I have a Junk collector that protectron... 8f he was armed it would be a little better.

Meat hook would be higher from benefiting from iron fist perk. But club higher base damage.

Out of 600+ times I've done it I'm pretty sure I've got the final shot in at least a few times. But if that is actually the issue I guess I'll try again.. but with the dmg right now where people are litterally 2 shotting her it's almost impossible.

I honestly only bulk what I'm about to sell because I have an excess of materials. Plastic is too precious to me. I'm always looking and farming it, yet I never have enough to keep up with my hungry shotgun needs.
---
I've read this as well, there was a CM post about it a bit ago with that suggestion.
---
Well It's a little more complicated with Meat Hook. Its base damage is not that impressive but the more buffs to melee combat you have, the more bonus damage it receives and outclasses other gauntlets in this class. If I remember correctly even after one cooked Glowing Meat steak (+10% to melee dmg),  it  outweighs other gauntlets. Throw in Mutant Hound steak aswell and it gets even more bonuses exponentially, and so on. I cant really tell the numbers, cause I'm using Bloodied version which also benefits from Radicool, Nerd Rage, Adrenal Reaction (also full unyielding set gives me +15 additional strenght).,but after 3 meats (glowing meat, yao guai steak, mutt chops) i have around 5k base damage on it . Even without any bonuses its damage is very close to a deathclaw gauntlet. If you're playing solo as a full hp build, instigating weapons is your best bet, but then again instigating meathook is worthless in this case, because it requires a bit of buffing yourself in order to really outshine other weapons
---
Thanks
---
U need science rank 2 not rank 1
---
The Gatling explosive lasers are almost as bad as the Tesla‚Äôs.  I had a lvl 80 guy just melt me with one and I was a fair distance away.  I went back and he got me even quicker the 2nd time around.   
---
When I have sentinel armor and a prime auto BE handmade and I unload 30 shots and it‚Äôs making like slap dmg you make something is effed up.  Tesla‚Äôs are just as bad.  Worse as they can bounce around and through buildings and other bullshit.

I enjoy this as much if not more than any other Bethesda fallout game. I try to log in every day to snag an easy 20-40 atoms and hop around to vendors looking for decent 3 stars. Probably sitting at near 700 hours in game and since the beta. And have to say, that while this game has, and will likely always have problems, I've never lost any important gear or experienced anything all that frustrating beyond the occasional disconnect. The QoL changes since beta have been small but very welcome. Overall, I like this game, I wouldn't say I love it, but as someone who skipped Fo4 this gives me the best that game had to offer and then some and I plan on playing well past Wastelanders and into the next few years at least.
---
I think everything should have legendaries. I really miss wandering around Watoga and getting kills. I loved it down there.

Yeah was about to say the same.. he only have rank 1.. he have to rank it up
---
I am assuming the point is to have multiple fully functional workshops on one server collecting resources while displaying as unowned on the map to not attract attention.
---
I have to applaud the technique because I would not have noticed the first time around if they hadn't built several workshops up exactly the same way with blueprinted structures. I would have just assumed somebody had a workshop and left everything for the next person, or crashed and lost it all. 
---
I thought it was a one time fluke but over the course of a week I have hunted three different people following the same basic principal.
---
Yes, and heavy guns have a perk to reduce their weight. Rifles do not.
---
How is this shit not on the list of topics to automatically get locked down?
---
We've spent almost a year now having people whine almost constantly about how they "feel" like they're getting fewer legendary drops or worse legendary drops and over that entire year there has only been ONE INSTANCE where anyone was actually able to prove anything and that was when they literally removed legendary enemies from the watoga robot spawns.
---
Anyone want to complain that their thirst and hunger suddenly seem to be going down faster while we're at it?
---
You only have science rank 1 equipped. You have science expert rank 2 and science master rank 1. But the crafting requirements are specifically for science rank 2. Put one more point on the science perk and it should work for you.
---
I have a Explosive Gatling Plasma and while it is very good, its not as good as you might think honestly. I find that I do better with my .50 cal as far as DPS because the Gatling Lasers kickback is fucking nuts outside of PA.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/uUDVyqd.png](https://i.imgur.com/uUDVyqd.png)
---
Do I really? I thought the Science Expert perk card covered this?
---
I have always wanted to do this in a Fallout game. Fallout 4, and now Fallout 76 *seem* to make it possible.
---
oh what the fuck it's indeed a second rank on the science 1 card as well. Thanks. I'm just an idiot
---
Its the only way to find NEW posts.. lol
---
I get that since my main two characters are heavy and sniper.  That said I don‚Äôt really have weight issues with my sniper.
---
Im excited to see NPC's but i doubt that wastelanders will live up to the hype.
---
No, what's obvious is that some people have shit luck farming for an evening and decide it's a giant fucking conspiracy.  Then they run to reddit where other people who haven't been legendary farming but "feel" like they've been getting fewer drops jump in on the circle jerk.
---
I was available today.  With the start of the new week (Noon?), they have new rewards and items for sale.
---
You have a week for each one, the start and end of each week is well known, I'm afraid there's not a lot to be done about it.
---
I craft a lot of ammo and this will sometimes happen while crafting ammo as well. Taking material out of my stash always seems to be the go to solution.
---
Other atoms.   
---
Eating too many Super Mutants.   
---
:p
---
It seems like the amount of effort this takes isn't worth the rewards. Like waaaaaaaaaaaay more inconvenient than getting killed once in a blue moon lol. Make em salty by taking them away, I say!
---
I wonder if this counter is really tied to kills. I mean, it's obvious that someone is manually updating given that it doesn't move on the weekends. I would put $10 on the number of scorched that have been killed is completely made up.
---
Other than weight rifles have no other trade offs though......
---
I always think it's funny when someone does a PSA for something that completely obvious.   
---
PSA: If you kill stuff you get EXP! OMG GUYS
---
This sounds fun, doing this for sure!
---
Me too.
---
There are no places to farm legendaries for low level players in the Forest.  Makes it completely uninteresting to me to even try to start over and play the game again, knowing how frustrating the starting 50 levels are with lack of decent equipment and NO hope of finding it now.
---
The metal helmet (not army, just metal helmet) Green hood (or Assault gas mask), plus explorer outfit. The chest armor looks great with it.
---
I think the same, but it has certainly made things fun and interesting for me.
---
The point is he wants to be able to trigger PVP by attacking players with workshops, but some players have found a way to harvest resources and log off the server so it leaves the workshop unowned and he can't contest it that way until they stealth log back in.
---
If he just wanted the resources he could claim the workshop and it would not revert back to them, but since they are obviously going out of their way to avoid PVP they would never contest it to get it back so I stead he lays waits for them to log back on without claiming it so he can ambush them.
---
It's intuitive, *if* you're used to that kind of thing...which kind of makes it *not* intuitive, really.  
---
But, yes the map is huge, and even zoomed out as far as you can (mouse scroll wheel for that), there's a lot of dragging the map around to find places.
---
If you zoomed out all the way to where the map was all on the screen, the details would be *tiny*.  I'd like to see a setting where you can zoom out all the way, but I understand why it's the way it is.
---
You'll get used to it, it's not a huge deal.
---
They haven't had any more reports of this happening:  
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dfj2vl/we_need_am_official_statement_if_the_vault_raids/

---
Nice! Yeah this one looks really sleek too in the display case

Some of the musical instrument are hanging on the wall in one of the hornwright towers.

The banjo can be found at Aaronholt Homestead in the northern part of The Forest.  Digested goo can be found in any of the carnivorous pitcher plants in the Bog.   Strange Bone is part of the Lying Lowe quest at Lowe's Taxidermy (you have to find a use for it as part of the quest).  Arthur Wood‚Äôs Lighter is an object you must find as part of the Cold Case side quest.

There's leader of the pack

Now that you mention it I remember dropping about 100 of those at one point, now I'm kicking myself for it.

Awesome! Time to grind some Camden Park quests I guess

I still have to kill one of these chill dudes for atoms. I just can't.

The lag is server related so turning down your own settings shouldnt really help

Anyone else find it hilarious that the empty survival survivals were needed to be able to run the pve content?

yup.. This

3 low lvl legendary drops each time you complete it
---
I've never even attempted it because of all the bug horror stories I've heard.
---
Leader of the pack.
---
Nice! I wonder if you're able to just not turn quest items in? I know that you cannot drop them, but can you display them? I might need to test this.
---
For some reason water is completely clear in my game. I think it might be the INI changes i made to remove the blur.
---
True.  But it would be nicer if you could just go to AVR Med Center, or Arktos Pharma (not the stupid dungeon event), or Sutton, or Helvetia/Greg's Mine, or Morgantown Airport/H.S. and be guaranteed to find at least ONE bloody legendary in the whole freaking Scorched infested Forest.
---
What are you doing with these responses, especially the video responses?
---
I am almost certain I have never seen a Legendary scorched. 400+ hours of playtime. Super lame. Ive seen 3* legendary radrats, and 3* legendary roaches and bugs, and molerats and ants....but never a scorched. Every enemy should be able to spawn as a legendary.  After personally killing thousands of scorched for the clean up Appalachia event, and never seeing a legendary, im pretty sure they cant spawn as legendaries.
---
Im starting to feel the same way. Like they can‚Äôt manage to do a lot of stuff right in the game after a year but they manage to have the ability to count killed creatures by every player?
---
The raids are pretty easy server hopping to find a good server is not. I feel like every server is quite full nowadays.
---
Excellent info, thank you! In that case are there any melee that would outperform the Power Fist?
---
20 hours
---
it's a skin for the standard backpack...
---
That is so cool!
---
I can recall two in my 700ish hours. Absurdly low rate of spawn. Makes little sense. Think last one was at Harper's.
---
You can also just grab one or two prices of weapon weight reduction gear. Heavies are usually in Power armor (although not always) so they can't grab wwr gear if they rock PA
---
There is occasionally scorched horde events. I usually see them pop up in the mire region. Always seems to take me to valley galleria.
---
We are not on track to fail. Only 1.5m left!
---
Where the heck is the Beckley station!?
---
You need to be able to craft the standard backpack. It‚Äôs just a skin.
---
Change the sort to "weight" and all armor comes to the top.
---
In Adventure Mode who cares... It effects literally noting. In NW the cheating is so obnoxiously bad that it's not even worth playing anymore.
---
Floor mats is how he did it. You only need them if placing up against the windows where the ceiling curves down.  Unless your okay with everything sitting 1 yard from the window. Also I‚Äôll note, it seems to be item specific with the floor mats.  Some will work all day long without mats
---
How do you time it since "Line in the Sand" is a public event now (and not an especially long one)?
---
You need the standard backpack to craft. Go to a train station and read pioneer scout poster to get started
---
I have the standard backpack, but the other one shows up as a separate thing entirely, not a skin.
---
WTF???????????
---
The best content Bethesda has done in this game is add player vending. It brought the community together and added content by allowing people to set up shops and sell. The hunt for legendaries to sell, the hunt for junk to sell, the camp construction tailored to build stores. All great stuff. This is the type of content we need.  
---
As far as bugs I have been lucky and really didn't have many aside from some disconnects.
---
Bethesda really needs to add more game mechanics similar to the backpacks and ever upwards type grinding. If they put a focus on faction rewards it would be huge. Let us join a faction and give us missions that reward commendations.  Commendations are used like badges and allow you to purchase known rewards from a machine. People would love this!! Add in some global rewards for factions (similar to cleaning Appalachia) that reward cool stuff for your faction winning.  Like give the responder faction a 50 pct discount at legendary purveyor if they eliminate the most supermutants in a weekend.
---
I also would love to see the nuke launch expanded on. Bethesda should have region bosses that activate when you hit certain locations. Give them new loot and players would have a ball!! I also think adding in new random guns, plans, oufits, etc to random rewards would really spike interest in less popular events.
---
Just my 2 caps.....
---
Biv had his first hangover
---
Right, it's not the population's fault, it's the size of the population that is at fault. Bethesda's only at fault for not taking into account their active player numbers. 35 million in a healthy game is nothing
---
weak!!!
---
It also doesnt work on the "small backpack" it only works on the pioneer scout one from the quest.
---
I've seen people build mansions and stuff in their workshops. Like, why?? I can only guess it's to make a blueprint to place it down at their CAMP later but it just seems like an incredible waste of time and resources.
---
Even immaculately geared endgame players in a full team of 4 who all know exactly what to do in the missions can't complete expert unless it's on a "good server" due to lag.  
---
The best strategy we've been able to come up with is forming a team of 3-4 in the menu, and then joining a server as a group.  This seems to have the best chance to get a less laggy server as generally servers with 4 open slots to accommodate an entire team logging in all at once seem to have low player counts and thus less lag.  
---
That fact that we have to go through all these gymnastics to play the missions is just plain bad design and execution of an otherwise fun game mechanic.  
---
Bottom line: they need to fix the lag problems yesterday.    
---
Something is wrong when the same team that can easily coast through expert with plenty of time to spare on a good server will abjectly fail 100% of the time on a bad one, often in the first room because the door won't ever open before the timer runs out.  
---
It's sad because they are a fun challenge when there's little or no lag.
---
the quickest way to level is to team up with a high level and go to high level area with 60+ level enemies and you shoot them a few times and then let the high level finish them off. i have leveled all my friends like this and its fun it helps both players as it give the high level play an objective and it helps the low level power level.
---
I found THREE legendary scorched on a run through Sunnytop Ski Lanes yesterday. 
---
I swear my game was bugged.
---
I didn‚Äôt think it would be but I just assumed it wouldn‚Äôt be as important as the bugs in the game. I have hope that maybe one day it‚Äôll be back. As of right now I don‚Äôt use the pip boy light, I have a mining helmet with the bright light mod.
---
but thats END GAME farming... derr
---
On rare occasions one spawns during the collision course event.
---
I'm starting to think that the numbers are just manual, but it makes me feel good to imagine we have almost done it.
---
If you have a friend playing who is already higher level, team up with them and tag(shoot once) every enemy and let your friend finish them off. That way you can get the experience from the high level enemies. 
---
But in my honest opinion, if its your first play through, you shouldnt try and rush the leveling process. You should just follow the various main quest lines, explore, and level up as you go. Its worth it to learn the story and game mechanics. You should be level 50 before you finish all the main quests.
---
If they don't give us the 50%, I'll probably take a break from this game.
---
I've been devoted since the beta, but this will take the wizz for me.
---
Yep ... but I'm talking about locations like Whitespring and Westek.
---
Plenty of options in the Forest, AVR Med Center, Arktos Pharma, Helvetia/Greg's Mine, Morgantown Airport/H.Ss. Sutton ......  Lots of Scorched.   NO Legendaries.  Seems weak, doesn't it?
---
He went to find Lewis and share a brew and some stories.
---
I didn't do that but Beckley is bottom left of map search town maybe u find it
---
at least 2 of the missions can be soloed on standard, the 3rd might be possible if you use some "strategery" to cheese the final room.  
---
My best advise is get a group of 4, form up in the menu, then launch in as a group.  Seems to be the best chance to find a less laggy server that I've found.  
---
Barring that you can server hop, and if the initial room where you launch the mission is super laggy then you can use that as canary in the coal mine kind of test.
---
Who cares about adventure mode.
---
See how that works?
---
Iv been running through this town for twenty minutes ü§™
---
Is the game actually counting all these scorched we kill or is someone just filling in numbers on a goal sheet? If so I would like this same mechanic to work for my ‚Äòkill tough enemies‚Äô challenge. Sitting on a over 100 improved repair kits and according to the challenge I haven‚Äôt killed the Queen yet...
---
Agreed. I also attempted to solo this once and this was exactly what happened to me. It was not the enemy difficulty- it was the lag. I have not attempted it since.
---
It's sort of mind-boggling to me. Every other game where I play with instances and raids- they are designed well and meant to be fun- and the loot is the reward for that. People end up grinding for the gear, but they are also fun to do. This is just frustrating. Why design an unfun and frustrating raid? Also why isn't there a queue system for people to team up in the lobby of the raid or something for pick-up groups? Ah well, back to grinding West-tek.
---
Yeah.. i'm fairly certain we'll "hit" the goal. With no real idea of the actual numbers, other than what Beth says it is, there's no way they want to take that publicity hit.
---
My point is no location.  Only a single "iffy" event to wait for, and miraculously catch if you are lucky.
---
No Scorched Legendaries.  Don't you think that is Weak Sauce?
---
As long as you don‚Äôt mind sprinting everywhere instead of FT, you can stay ridiculously stocked on just about everything if you have properly modded PA and a couple of perks.
---
With Calibrated shocks + actionboy/girl, bandolier, and packrat, you can carry up to about 1720 # in excavator and still sprint.
---
With the same mods and perks, all other variants of PA allow up to 1420 carry weight and still sprint.
---
Early in the game, not being able to FT may be a good thing, IMHO, in that you discover a lot more locations, and run across a lot more critters to kill (XP), etc.
---
You get really spoiled being able to carry so much, but its great for loot runs - you can pick up enough stuff in one session to max out caps in one vendor visit.
---
OTOH, later, no FT can get annoying - As you get more selective/specific in where you need to go, you can‚Äôt FT there, or to events that randomly pop up, etc.  
---
As other posters said, cores get easier to obtain just through roaming.  Batteries included knocks their weight down to about 0.3, and power user (I think)  greatly extends their life. (I get about 6 hours out of a 50% core)
---
Oh. I'm not sure where it is.. Maybe try another location
---
Not in terms of preparing food and the buffs you might want, nor are they the same in decorative terms, exactly..
---
"solo"    
---
"raid"    
---
Did you ever think a raid should be done in a team so that one person protects the other while their interfacing with the terminals and locks? The raids have issues. They're not fun. But your reasoning is so dumb to me... You can't solo it so it's broken for that reason? The amount of effort you put into your critique is *inexcusable*.
---
Lvl 370 and refuse to even try it- wether ur inventory being deleted is fixed or not or on whichever mode is a risk im not willing to take. If my inventory gets deleted then id be done with the game for sure
---
It is possible that I have seen them before, but a few months ago I started paying attention and looking for them, since them I know for sure I havent seen one. But considering they are the main story enemy we are fighting, there should be more of them. But I have a feeling they are going to be removed from the game for wastelanders. We have been ‚Äúcleaning them up‚Äù, and with a new main questline coming, I wont be surprised to see no more scorched.
---
Go kill some scorched.  Do it for Mama Murgh!
---
I would 5$ to be able to do that.
---
Ok
---
True I wish you could drag it's but you couldn't drag other peoples
---
I just wish it was the same texture that they use for everything that gets burnt up in the fire storm in NW
---
You do!!?? Now we can answer all these posts asking how to level up quickly! "Kill things"
---
Lemme run there and see if I can find it for ya
---
Yeah, my alt is planned to be a Pistoleer/Shotgunner setup.
---
Trouble is that PvP players don't go to claim workshops, they'll just hop from one server to the next just to start shit with pve players. If a PvPer were to claim and try to hold a workshop maybe they'd actually get some PvP, from an actual PvP built person? Just a thought.
---
100% agree. Lag wasn't that bad for me but the whole raid wasn't that much fun, I liked the legions of enemies but the xp was so pitiful they might as well have given 0. I'd have gained more by boiling water. Didn't like having to find cards and tried to do the other thing to lower the lockdown but my teammate didn't. The Defend the Geck event was a clusterfuck. I'm a Bloodied Heavy Gunner and put on all 9 Damage perks but still couldn't keep up with all the ghouls just wrecking everything. Too many things to be destroyed within too large of an area. Perhaps because there was only two of us. The ghouls destroyed the geck cage and...what?! Mission over??? I fucked around in this groggy shithole for hours, having 0 fun just have it fail? Why can't we just start that section over? There's no way I'm doing that for a second time, and will be hesitant to ever visit the place again in future. Vault engineer obligations be damned
---
Plus, what are we even doing this for, a few chunks of steel and some Bulk crafting materials that weigh less than usual? I'd rather be wandering than doing this just plain *ordeal*
---
It's updated manually when the managers get the numbers from the devs. 
---
Proof: https://imgur.com/a/RwIgMAh
---
I've also only seen 2 legendary scorched in 800hrs of play.
---
Stop whining.
---
The perks weight reductions vary, martial artist is like 60%, the armor one is 50%, theres one specifically for power armor chassis that decrease it 75%, most are 90% weight reduction. Ultralight mod on armor and weightless legendary effects stack, though so you can get some armor that weighs 0.00
---
Dev: "Idk, just tell them they need 1.5 million more, whatever. Let me get back to making these atom shop items."
---
I have to disagree. My bloodied, two handed power armor build hits the queen in the face for 750 plus on a consistent basis. No heavy gun build I have seen can come close to my dps. And at the end of the day my build is far less costly than heavy guns and far quicker at clearing mobs. For pve I highly suggest bloodied, two handed power armor builds.
---
Found it
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs rigged, there‚Äôs no way we killed 13 million scorched in two days (this weekend) when we were at just 25 million Friday and it took us like three weeks to get to 25 million so I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll give it to us lol
---
I don‚Äôt have a problem with the Gatling plasmas it‚Äôs the Gatling explosive Lasers that seem messed up.  The splash damage should not allow for longer range (accurate) hits.  
---
Tesla‚Äôs are just weak sauce
---
I suspect you have deeper problems than the weapon you are using.    
---
Power fist can do plenty of damage.  Using another won't make a flawed build good.  
---
I recommend posting your build to get advice on it before worrying about a new weapon.
---
I like the mole rat repellent idea
---
I have as well
---
Randomly generated. Mine doesn't even leave the top floor of my house, on top of Seneca Rocks. There's no way it'd be collecting junk from anything "real".
---
Would you be willing to sell it or trade?

Sure thing!

---
Where.
---
Honestly just skip mission 2 on any difficulty except novice, and that‚Äôs only if you want the pitiful amount of vault steel you get. Mission 1 is very doable even with a moderate amount of lag/delay, and mission 3 can be done with some/minimal lag.
---
&gt; healing factor mutation
---
that mutation probably fucked you more than anything because the upside of the mutation is only active out of combat and the down side reduces the effects of all chems by 55% including stimpacks
---
Definitely depends on what area of the map you‚Äôre in I‚Äôm in the forest and my buddies in savage divide, he gets way better materials than I do at mine usually
---
Not True.  
---
X-01 has the best Energy/Radiation resistance. 
---
Ultracite has a small edge in ballistic protection, and you can put a jetpack on the helmet.
---
Not looking for anything atm, thanks anyway
---
East Side of the town
---
I was trying to send a pic
---
They won't introduce the expendables. I like the paper bag skin idea though
---
Yes! This! I saw a comment on another post awhile ago where a dude was saying how to tell if a server was "good" or not and I never got to ask how! This map is great thank you!
---
He has a loot list and that's locked. Meaning not completely random I mean. Like he won't pick up flux for us
---
On the outskirts near the road that's to the right of Beckley all u wud see is the gas signage
---
It's not drastically different now than it was before.  The core natural of the game hasn't changed much, so if you didn't care for it then, you likely won't now either.
---
I've killed more scorched in the past week than I have since launch. Not saying much since I never sought them out before, but i am now scorchbeast hunter supreme tyty
---
Is there red rocket signage there? I found a gas station but without any red rockets signs and it didn‚Äôt count when I used photo mode
---
I love this game but hate Vault 94.
---
Played once start of summer and hated it. Really love fallout but i didnt like it then. I kept dying, had shit weapons. Then i went back on it two weeks ago to try it again cuz i finished kingdom come and wanted to play fallout 4 but even after a year not playing 4 i can remember pretty much everything about it. So i went back into fallout 76 and kept my same character luckly the next mission i played gave me the fixer and ive just been having a awesome time learning how it all works how much stuff cost/sell for. Where to get legendarys and where to scrip them and i love it. Cant wait for wasterlanders and to see what they have in store afterwards i just hope this dosnt effect another fallout single player game in the future. Well thats down on how tes6 is tbh.

Wasn't the cutoff like an hour ago?
---
There used to be one almost every time at the top of the civic center in watoga. After they nerfed the robots there I never saw him anymore. It's definitely weird. I think there should be more low level legendary enemies in the forest. About all you get is leader of the pack and the alpha enemy events.
---
I guess just vendor them for 30k then and it wont auto scrap them. It must just auto scrap any junk items than can be decreased to base materials, then. They should implement some sort of tagging feature to mark things you dont want auto scrapped :\
---
It‚Äôs really weird because traditionally, I usually love dialogue and story-driven content in games. But maybe his game scratched an itch I didn‚Äôt know was there. Having all of you guys in the wasteland doing your own things too is just enough interaction for me!
---
People have already stopped trying out of "disgust" that it's a nailbiter
---
Maybe the Great Pumpkin will visit your humble patch as well.
---
For me, its how repetitive and annoying NPCs can be. Real people are far more entertaining
---
Man.. I am battling it every day for 4 years and I would never even think about writing this. It sucks i know.. tell me about it man.. im just trying to pay my bills every month and pay my mother becouse i lended some money from her for medications and pain killers. I had to break with my GF just so she could live without the burden. Try to live the rest as good as you can to form good memories. Some ppl like me cant even stay at home living it off. I have to work 12  hours a day 7 days a week just to pay bills and pay for my meds. Never even tried to tell this to anyone. My mother thinks i have kidney stones :D good luck.
---
Yes! It helped! Thank you!!!
---
I never had an issue with lack of NPC'S in the world. I thought it did add to the isolation you should feel while exploring.  But I'm excited to see them added in game. I just hope you'll be able to avoid them when you want lol.
---
My biggest worry is if my camp will get displaced for two of my characters after the update lol. They are remote spots but I'll be my luck
---
Only emote bug I get is it often will become the hotwheel for weapons and aid and stuff. Drives me nuts but doesn't cause crashing.
---
Funny enough .... very few up-votes for something that I think is pretty damn universal ... The Players of Fallout 76 want more legendaries.  But yet there is no way of sending a message to Bethesda without a Sub-Reddit with a thousand upvotes or more.
---
Honestly, a Steam release around now would be healthy as it would get some new blood into the game.
---
Ive always been a PvP player. Im really missing survival with map markers, bounties, no damage cap etc. I still love the game but honestly I don't enjoy it as much as I use to
---
Yeah I am interested in seeing how this whole NPC thing will go over. My guess is our camps will be fine, and most settlers will pop up in towns and bunkers and stuff!
---
I actually believe TS to be one of shittiest rolls in the game right now, the damage bonus not enough to compensate for 0 accuracy, yet it appears that projectiles that are not bullets/explosive bullets/silenced bullets behave normally with TS (they suck), while plasmas, fat mans and rocket launcher seem to behave better than expected
---
Boy that‚Äôs not what my game looks like, this must be PC right?
---
Nope, except for a deathclaw gauntlet, but the difference in base damage is barely noticable
---
Signage? https://imgur.com/gallery/tWIlzcG try stand on it
---
T51 has the highest damage resistance, X01 has the highest energy resistance. I believe they're higher than marine armor plus ironclad however when you factor in legendary effects regular armor has a pretty high advantage there, seeing as you can have 5 pieces of regular armor each with 3 legendary effects whereas power armor has no legendary effects unless you want to grind out vault raids

I saved porcelain stines from faschnaut, and they don't show up üò¢ 
---
Took a lot of effort to keep them from scraping.
---
This would be legit. Expect an ammo scrapper in the ATOM shop in 2-3 months for 700-1k ATOMS.
---
I wouldn't ignore plastic and screws of I were you ;)
---
The lack of legendary scorched has become a lot more obvious since the cleanup event.  
---
As far as upvotes.....I used to type up long rambling qol posts on this sub and barely anyone takes the time to reply.
---
So you are against having more Scorched Legendaries?  Really?
---
Doesn't leader of the pack proc as soon as someone enters the area?
---
Ha, good luck when all you can put down with my camp budget is a single letter.
---
Dang! I knew I should have brought my gaming laptop to work today!  Gotta double down when I get home.
---
What's funny, for me at least, is this game feels so much more populated than past games. NPCs to me aren't "real", so they don't really bug me. But seeing camps right next to the vault upsets me. Fallout has always had "people", but the other players in 76 are EVERYWHERE. I remember the first week or so I played, seeing another person was pretty rare. I'd see them on the map WAAAAY over in the Bog or wherever, and be like "whoa they're so far away". But now with player vending icons all over the map, it's like super populated feeling.
---
Very laggy! One thing that helps us is having built mainframe cores before going in. Several stims and certain cards help. One thing we look for before even attempting is has a nuke been launched, how many are in the server and are the ghouls in the beginning already dead. It needs lots and lots of work!
---
Found a single solitary one wandering alone in the Savage Divide.   It'd be nice to have a location, with a decent drop/spawn rate.
---
Scorched can only spawn as legendary during events. Sometimes people see them at Harper's Ferry outside events, but that's because they spawned during a previous event without being killed.
---
Most legendaries spawn as normal enemies and then "convert" to legendary with the familiar green smoke effect. Here's a list of enemies that have a chance to convert:  https://imgur.com/gallery/H5lxS5O
---
As somebody that has completed expert on all 3 raids. 
---
#1 find a Good server (no lag). how fast does your camp spawn in, how fast does the silo holotape take to open. etc.
---
#2 have a good group of 4 to do it with. each with jobs to do.
---
it can be done with two people on expert. i have not done that. i have done 3 people on expert.
---
this person did a nice write up on it [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PWK7oIVeT9FBiwFFKY0bA1JjtC5-3oYkO-HxktiV5QA/edit)
---
i hope that help
---
It‚Äôs all a RNG algorithm to keep you grinding and interested in game.
---
Did Whitesprings radiation zone and the golf course house had 4 legendary glowies in there.  Do another a few days later and no legendaries to be found.
---
Same with Harpers Ferry and Burrows.
---
The last 4 ur-anium fever has had nothing but 1 Star dudes which I find interesting.
---
Exactly how i play. Lone wanderer.
---
-Feel Free to use my opinion-
---
Regardless of the bugs, glitches and so on - I still enjoy playing the game.
---
It definitely has come a long way since release. But could things be better? Hell yeah! Bethesda needs to rework a lot of stuff regarding weapon balances, mods (still kinda mad about the Handmade drum mag being nerfed) and even regards to some builds, especially so other ones are more viable. This game has a lot of potential still so its my hope it continues to get better.
---
Can‚Äôt fast travel in PA?
---
Walking away with flames behind you would have been cool like a movie trailer...lol
---
Again I'll say it, despite any possibility of naysayers: this is in all likelihood, a shoe-in _no matter_ what the totals actually are in reality.
---
Bethesda was just using this "event" as a stop-gap measure until Wastelanders is released. I mean, what else did they have planned in it's place...a meat week #3? It doesn't matter to Bethesda what it is that you're doing in-game, _as long as you're playing_; playing the game is all they care about (and buying Atoms, of course).
---
 I doubt Bethesda's going to piss off their player base and say something like, "Whelp, you guys almost got it but, 'almost' only counts in horse shoes and hand grenades. So sorry about that, but that's how it goes; better luck next time". At the _very least_, we'll get a consolation prize, but I'm pretty sure we'll get everything, regardless.
---
The last thing we need is more pay to win. Stop giving them ideas.
---
I've soloed it twice and I have to admit you're right about the terminals.
---
Try to use one. Hear a creature. Exit it. Kill 15 things. Use terminal. Wait 6 seconds. Reach second screen. Hear a creature. Exit it and kill 12 things. Use the terminal. Wait 6 seconds. Activate the thing. Hear a creature. Repeat.
---
Once a 20 hour play session ..... so yes.  But it doesn't solve the problem of no Scorched Legendaries, with about a 1/2 dozen locations to choose from.
---
I built my camp in the cabins North of the cat lady house. Right outside the camp is a super mutant spawn point that is activated anytime someone fast travels to my base. Every forth or fifth time this happens there is a legendary. 
---
Also seems to be more legendaries at events.
---
ü§£ü§£
---
Same here.
---
I‚Äôm seeing a recurring theme here. Must be that a lot of us who are attracted to this game are loners by nature.
---
It will be bad. And it will be the end of this game.
---
K... I got some tinfoil hats for sale of you're interested.
---
Oh, then damn, Ad Victorium! Let's whip the scorched off the map! I will be doing my part as soon as I'm done with my classes for the day.
---
I have some, they don't show up in display cases. üò¢
---
Except I was using Class Freak 3 as well as First Aid 3, so it counteracts the negatives of Healing factor quite nicely. I don't use any other drugs so it's nbd.
---
Low priority for them I‚Äôm sure
---
That's true of every explosive energy weapon though. I have a feeling they're going to be removed from the game with the wastelanders update, and even as long as it took me to get mine, I still wont be mad if they do.
---
i prefer the name ‚ÄòMole Bitch‚Äô
---
Well, a really tack set of wall paper and a matching suit outfit would really make up for the lack of legendary drops, especially if they came in a bundle for more than 1500 atoms and had a 50s feel Toaster for your camp thrown in. #buyingitforthetoaster
---
Not just the emote wheel, the weapon wheel also freezes whenever you change weapon.
---
Luckily it hasn't done it mid battle but it's only a matter of time till it kills me
---
If we could kill 13 million over the weekend, 1.5 is nothing, praise 'murica and pass the ammunition I say. I just thought they were ending it 9am pst day of like they usually measure time.
---
The solitude is one of the big draws for me too.
---
Even with players all over, and the random encounter at my camp from a shopper, people tend to keep to themselves.
---
I feel this actually  helps add to the story.  We are trying to rebuild society, and you cant do that if you have to stop and talk to everyone and everything in the world.
---
As  precaution, you could were a rad suit whenever you craft something at a public workbench.
---
Nice haul
---
Next to whitesprings near the radioactive waste dump (where the super mutants spawn all of the super mutants there were all 3 star legend aries. Got some decent loot too.
---
Thanksgiving Day Event boss???
---
I'm in the same boat - I do Vanguard's and don't do a Bloodied build, but I have significantly less protection in PA than not.  I only wear it for nuke zones.
---
That‚Äôs the beauty of open world games, you get to spend the time however you like. Teamwork is only occasionally necessary when fighting tough bosses.
---
Yep, I feel you there.  I'm constantly picking up plastic now.  I hadn't previously hoarded it because I never thought I'd run out.  Then I started using shotguns...
---
It's nothing but small random encounter.
---
Ya, I hope they dont get rid of scorchbeasts, unless they are replaced with something similar. But the scorched? They gotta clear space in the settlements for the npcs. Like the raider village by top of the world, pleasant valley cabins, I hope that place becomes a full on raider settlement. And flatwoods, that should become a responder settlement. There are plenty of places like those that are usually scorched hangouts, that will most likely become npc settlements. 
---
Im gonna keep playing no matter what. Im hooked. But they did say a whole new main questline. If we are cleaning up the scorched permanently, I guess new players just wont get to experience the same quests that we did. But you are probably right, that it would be too much to remove all that from the game. On the other hand, we should get the feeling of progress with this kind of game. Maybe a new main questline every year going forward. That would be alright with me.
---
dead in the water and washout are not too bad solo. Meltdown is the one thats really bad.
---
Lol.
---
If we do get the 50% discount I am taking a break from doing anything fun in game for a few days. 1,000 scrip (or up to 1,750 scrip if maxing everyday) worth of weapons means I will be fully overencumbered for several days. I will not be playing at all except to sit at the scrip machine and work my way back down at 150 scrip per day. They should have increased the stash limit before the sale starts. :(
---
Fasnacht was awesome. 
---
Meat Week was lackluster.
---
yea i've never actually done the raid myself mainly because i'm waiting on the dlc to come out but i use medx for scorch beast queen fights and imposter sheepsquatch fights
---
The older I get, the more I realize that. For example, the 3 main staple games on my Xbox are 76, ESO, Monster Hunter and Red Dead. That‚Äôs all I need!

I had no idea. It never popped up on the start up screen like it did before
---
I wouldn't say it's always been like that.  In the originals there were only a handful of unique weapons but in 3 and NV there were unique versions that were usually better but not every gun had a version like that and some had their trade offs that might have made them better but not a direct upgrade.  But in 4 and 76 you can get legendaries but it won't change the stats of the weapon.  The stats can still be pretty shit.  The explosive submachine gun Spray and Pray in 4 was pretty good because it was an easily obtainable explosive gun but it wasn't that good because the submachine gun was shit.  I have a two shot m79 grenade launcher in 76 but it breaks way too fast because all explosive guns kinda suck balls.  Legendaries are kind of a band aid to unbalanced weapons.  Before laser guns got buffed, laser gun legendaries weren't even good even with good effects.  They might only be as good as non-legendary versions of other guns.  I found an anti-armor assault rifle but it didn't do as much damage as my regular handmade because the assault rifle just does pitiful damage in comparison and anti-armor is one of the best effects given armor in this game.  Getting an OP version of a crappy weapon is just a band aid to a gun having shitty stats and needing a buff.
---
I can hold about 300 assault rifles. All you need is 1 or 2 pieces of WWR armour and it shouldn't be a problem for you.
---
Also, the amount of junk you have that you don't really need I'll bet is massive.
---
Serious question. Has anyone ever played an  mmo where the community didn‚Äôt meet a challenge and the game company didn‚Äôt give the rewards? Because I‚Äôm starting to believe this whole thing is another way to keep players logging in, and that Beth will say we met the challenge even if we didn‚Äôt kill one more scorched. Just for the goodwill it generates.
---
Something‚Äôs off. I play this game unfortunately a little to much, not casually. I max script on multiple characters each day and usually have to juggle which crap legendaries to try to sell here and there for s few thousand. It‚Äôs like a mini game for me. 
---
My sell spreadsheet for the last few days is shrinking along with items my mule is selling. I‚Äôm not keeping up. Something is off. I know a larger sample size is warranted but my sample size is that of 5-6 causal players. I‚Äôm at home post op surgery for 6 weeks. I have no life and I‚Äôm living in Appalachia.
---
As much as I would like my ability to craft damn near every weapon in the game to be more relevant... I would be pretty bummed if they introduced new ammo types and I couldn't use them on the legendary weapons I have grinded so hard to get.
---
The first one is a mod (different, easier to see highlighted colors, etc.). 
---
The second one sounds unnecessary since Pacifist mode essentially means your growers can only do so much and if you DO lose some junk for dying in PvE, oh well you‚Äôll get more. Survival mode is gone so there‚Äôs no PvP griefing that‚Äôs not warranted. 
---
The third one sounds like a craftable consumable from a side quest more than something I‚Äôd ever spent a single Atom on.
---
Except you very much do get actual groups of 2 to 4 players that will travel to an occupied workshop when you show up to defend or collect materials. 
---
They're the same type who will block you so you can't track them on the map and stealthboy the second you show any ounce of fighting back.
---
This didn't happen (at least not with any frequency) until after Survival was removed.
---
This is on places like Gorge Junkyard or Tyler County Dirt Track where the occupant has only set up a junk extractor and a few turrets-- these groups then take the place over and then promptly don't use it at all. They only show up to keep the player from taking it back.
---
I've had the personal pleasure of stealing two nukes from groups like this and promptly nuking their bases off of the map.
---
I 100% agree with you.
---
I can give you my opinions and you can agree or disagree with them.
---
Workshops have risk. It is a mechanic that is very much intentional whether anybody wants to agree with it or not. I personally do not enjoy workshop PvP much, but I also don't look down upon those who do. What I do not like is seeing people get on their high horse spewing unrealistic expectations of some non existent code that they should be left alone when they claim a workshop. 
---
This tactic is an obvious effort to avoid risk. It is clever, so clever that I view it as a cat and mouse game which I very much enjoy. I don't particularly care how the person on the other end views it. I am not luring them into PvP that they have not consented to. 
---
How is it detrimental? I could argue that building and disowning 5 workshops to the point where it costs 200 caps to claim them prevents a leveling player from claiming said workshop to use for xp/plan/resource farming. You could argue that said player could just go to another server. Both points are true. 
---
If left unchecked and we all magically live in this happy leave everybody else alone fantasy land, what you are going to see on every server is one person owning every single workshop. 
---
If you want to build a "base" then more power to you. The game provides you the camp mechanic for doing so. If you want to do it in a workshop, that's great, but you'd damn well better be ready to defend it.
---
If you feel that strongly about it, I advise you grab the nearest gun and a sledgehammer and go out and fuck the shit out of as many of those filthy orange bastards you can find.
---
No, I think it's fake statistics.
---
Not necessarily the same thing but, i love building on camps and to make things look better i place down a lot of plants in my base but it got to a point where i just enjoyed having plants on my base that i actually started getting some in real life and i live them so much xD
---
Yeah, an extra hundred lbs would go a long way per 50 lvls.
---
Honestly, I feel more upset by the fact I'm being down voted.
---
depends on your build but i would take the one with additional projectile it has higher dps
---
Will have to verify but the wooden bird cutout in treetops
---
This is precisely the type of raider post I expected - never not RP :D
---
It'd be nice if we had literally any content at all to work towards unlocking, or any meaningful progression other than getting mildly excited every 100th level.
---
Nice! That‚Äôs awesome
---
5 atom
---
I have an instigating explosive Dragon. It is AMAZING!
---
Bethesda "Why isn't anyone running Vault 94."
---
Players "Its broken and can cause players to lose their entire inventory plus its a chore to waste all those resources only to crash near the end."
---
Bethesda "We hear you load and clear heres a flag for running it last week and a photo frame for running it this week so we good now right? Eh whatever its good enough."
---
I tried it twice. Dumbest thing ive ever seen in a fallout game. The infinite spawning just makes it stupid in my opinion.
---
I would say keep the two-shot one and use the other for scrip.
---
That said I would also be on the lookout for an Anti-Armor one over a two-shot. The Two-Shot effect gives you more damage but hurts accuracy badly.
---
Yea the animation happening over and over is the issue.
---
It‚Äôs definitely rigged for sure so we‚Äôll definitely get it lol
---
Alright, thanks.
---
Needs some type of anti cheat. Farm it out to easy anti cheat, battleye... something.
---
Horseshoes and hand grenades....I didn‚Äôt think anyone else said that but me.
---
I thought Wastelanders was going to open new areas?  Pretty sure of that.
---
An atomic shop app linked to your Bethesda account would go a long way and generally increase impulse buys, hint hint beth.
---
There is a souvenir sloth at the white springs station, there is a little warehouse in the parking lot at the front of the station with one sitting on a sleeping bag next to a new nuka cola toy truck but i couldn‚Äôt pick the truck tho
---
Are you on PS4 I would buy one
---
It's probably because they're summoned infinitely by scorchbeasts. It would be too easy to farm them just by camping a fissure site.
---
Oh maybe. I hadnt read that. I hope so. New high level areas.
---
They have to actually fix the trade bugs first.
---
Lol you guys really think these numbers are real? Its all fictional to keep us playing. If nobody logged on today, we'd still get that sale
---
Damn, nice haul.
---
What were you planning for the mothman wings? Is the another use for them aside from ballistic fiber?
---
 It one but two down votes... why I wonder
---
Woah, where do you have those numbers from? Their site is still on 23 mill for me?
---
They do exist, just got nerfed into oblivion. I got my first TSE double barrel shotgun from a scorched during an SBQ fight. The clinic in Watoga used to have one spawned, RNG‚Äôd among windigo, super mutant and glowing one. I‚Äôve also got a few good drops from scorched mobs in harpers ferry, one of them was a Zealot explosive minigun. But it‚Äôs getting rarer and rarer with each patch. Now the best and easiest bet is back to white spring.
---
Not one but two down votes.. I wonder why
---
Maybe not in the atomic shop
---
I gotta respectfully disagree.  TS is 25% damage bonus with a large accuracy penalty.  The vamps has 10% ADS, so it's only a 15% damage boost for the cost of worse accuracy.  If you miss 15% more of the shots due to the accuracy problem (which probably a reasonable guess)  you will actually out dps with the vamps.  
---
Meanwhile vamps is amazingly useful for tanking damage from high threat enemies like SBQ, ISS, arktos alpha and so on.  
---
If I had to pick just one I'd keep the vamp.
---
The point is I have found joy in a new form of cat and mouse. You can call me a griefer all you want, keep rubbing that salt, it doesn't make it any less fun. 
---
You want a workshop to use, I won't bat an eye. You want two workshops, I won't bat an eye. Put your name all over the map and I am going to assume you are looking for PVP. 
---
NW is a joke. Survival was my cup of tea and that's where I lived for months. I personally find workshop PVP boring. I want nothing to do with it, until I see stuff like this.
---
It has to be the last hit on her for the Queen to count I'm p sure
---
I've always thought this too. I also believe we would get the rewards no matter how many scorched we "killed"
---
Berry Mentats.
---
I think at that low a level you shouldn‚Äôt be worried about farming legendaries. Because legendary farming is an end game event.
---
Ohhh really?! But i dont see anything in stats.
---
I must have taken them by accident i guess (and have never before as you can tell)
---
^geez ....just give us FO4 with a bigger map and new stuff. &lt;problem solved&gt;
---
SBs never carry legendary, the best stuff i ever got from them were prime plans and a golden minigun (I scrapped it immediately thinking i could learn the paint, sigh ü§Æ)
---
I agree with this, but you could set it to the same cap value so at least you have a few caps to feel better about. People say caps have no value in this game, but I've recently had trouble selling weapons in the trade groups for caps. Dunno if it's new players or what but you get "ahhh man that's way too much"
---
why not all rifles?  Like why should an automatic handmade wight more than a semi auto one?
---
My choice is usually hopping in my power armor, that has done the trick so far, lol
---
I collected maybe 30 nuclear material from w/s the other day and it all disappeared. Also 2 full runs of nuka plant and they all just went.
---
Only when i bought 30 from a vendor did it register. Had 33 in my stash when i stored and i already had 3.
---
Gave up on my gatling plasma after that not wasting my time with it now
---
I loved Watoga too but I understand why they took out the legendaries.
---
Once you complete the mayor quest they don't ever fight back.  Just didn't make sense for enemies that don't attack to drop legendaries.
---
I don't see what that has to do with anything.  A confirmation window would work for all interactions, regardless if caps are a part of the transaction or not.
---
Scrip every day, don't waste scrip randomly until after you hit the cap limit
---
I've got 5 pieces of wwr but it is a fast travel emergency kit only and not really combat ready. Junk accumulating is a definite problem I keep at least 50 of most junk and the rest generally go in the vending machines for a few days until I dump the worst on vendor bots. 
---
Now if you need to carry 3300 pounds in assault rifles maybe you need to think about whether you have your own problems with hoarding. Lol.
---
We don't know. At Quakecon they said they were shooting for a November window, but they've been quiet since then.
---
Sometimes in November
---
Sorry if skeptical but pics or it didn't happen. I think they've nerfed the drops from the purveyor, used to get explosives and good rolls on script cash outs. Last 3 at 900 haven't seen much. I had bad rolls on the discounts too and my guy was roided up, the usual. The world drops have been great though. Had some good explosive rolls drop for me lately.
---
I'm saying to prevent yourself from getting scammed, sell it for caps, then buy theirs for the same amount of caps
---
lol I saw that option when I went to revive a dude at SBQ, can you do it with pacifist on?
---
Son. I dont give a rats ass if ya sceptical but just for the sheer pleasure of showing ya scepticism is sad..look on market as I'm trading stuff up...
---
Players giving other players fetch/delivery quests actually sounds kinda cool.
---
Who asks to be immortalized in a video game? Trolling or real, thats a very selfish act to ask for.
---
I can confirm that it doesn‚Äôt work that way either
---
There was another report of that earlier this week!
---
Just want to randomly say that I have yet to come across any Raiders but really want to. Is that weird? I'm a level 57 and just came across my first Raider camp (with the owner not home) yesterday. Seriously cool camp setup. Made me want to stay and leave all at once!
---
Make it like runescape. Fill the boxes with whatever and both confirm. Ah still have bad flashbacks to that game, remember got hacked and lost everything, blue phat, green phat, disc, easter eggs, masks. The trading system was good though.
---
At first I was a bit sceptical about the "lack" of human NPCs, but I came to love the empty world. No annoying settlers, no companions who won't shut up for a second, no raiders shouting gibberish everywhere you go... I'm going to miss the peace and quiet when humans return to Appalachia.
---
If it‚Äôs not cores or ammo I don‚Äôt mess with the other shops.  Just not worth it to me.
---
Funny thing is I just mentioned this the other day about never seeing a legendary scorched in my over a 1000 hours of play time.
---
 The only legendary scorched I've ever seen was during the scorched horde event.
---
Just last night I was making my rounds around the map and I actually ran into a random legendary scorched. I have ever seen in my 250 levels.  I was very shocked as I had convinced myself they did not exist outside of that event.
---
How easy would it be to get all the images possible of the board game items in game to study and try and produce imitation props?  What software and how good would the images be?
---
Which makes it amusing when I go back to FO4 and still grab everything made of plastic, even though it's almost useless there....
---
I'll check it out.. Geez wouldn't take 2 seconds to post pics. I'm sharing my experience and I know how shady a lot of people are on this sub.
---
Whoa, is this really advocating suicide? That's pretty edgy of you kiddo. Hope you're strong enough to do the same when you get your prescription
---
Yes, but the cranberry is worth it's weight in ultracite, to me.
---
Alright your not being reasonable so donezo.
---
Where is this?
---
Regardless of the perk Cards used and/or weight reduction Armor worn, you can only reduce weights by 90%, but...
---
* Bandolier, Batteries Included, &amp; Ordinance Express only affect specific ammo types, Armor with AWR affects them all..
---
* Martial Artist only affects Melee Weapons, Armor with WWR affect all types of Weapons
---
* Travelling Pharmacy affects Chems, Thru Hiker affects Food &amp; Drinks, Armor with FD&amp;C WR affects them all
---
You can stack the affects of Perk Cards and weight reduction Armor pieces, but 90% is a fixed limit regardless.
---
The problem is the ducky and bunny non PvP crowd screamed to Bethesda from the mountain tops to limit or get rid of PvP so survival went away.  Now it‚Äôs all up in adventure.  Too bad so sad deal with it
---
Then you're not advanced enough for the Advanced Power Connectors. ;)
---
My expectations are pretty much like your username op. Turd party.
---
It's not always true that even the max caps you can include in a trade are worth the item.  Plus if either player is caps maxed already I'm pretty sure the caps just evaporate into the ether meaning this isn't a viable solution for all players.  
---
Ultimately the reason caps are worthless is you are guaranteed to hit 30k caps if you just don't buy anything and grind out the 1400 caps per day max.  It's just a matter of time.  
---
But you could play the game for 10,000 hours and never get a bloody explosive fixer or whatever the "god tier" meta weapon happens to be.
---
Yeah, more talking about those sweet cranberries, no event there.
---
Also, you can run directly to the Vendor through the first house with the blown out wall. Then along the ally while avoiding the enemies. Unless someone kites them to you.
---
new guns, new gear, new camp items, new creatures, new quests, new NPCs and no improvements to the stash or camp size.
---
Wait...the ACTUAL KEVDUIT?
---
HECK YEAH I WAS JUST WATCHING YOUR VIDEOS DUDE.
---
I think it's a pretty fun game if you play it once in a while. No game is fun if you play, like, 20 hours a day, everyday. I play a few hours a day, sometimes stopping for weeks at a stretch because, life, and I enjoy every time I come back. There are a few major bugs here and there, but Bethesda has shown that they are willing to fix them. They are just not that good at it. I am not expecting anything earth-shattering with Wastelanders, but I hope the quest is good enough for a few hours of entertainment. I do wish they'd cut down on the "convenience items", though.
---
On PS4?  I can fix that for you.
---
Keep the vampire. The two shot prefix is not really good.
---
Shady is them.. shady ain't me, if ya bothered to look at my profile you would see I'm 100%
---
I got a blooded 3 star combat rifle with dmg resistance and FFR by a glowing one wandering around west of the golf club.  Totally random.  
---
Did a WS run and killed several 3 stars and netted zero 3 star drops.  One simply disappeared after I shot it
---
Why would they benefit Bethesda and what‚Äôs the point in faking statistics lmao
---
This isn‚Äôt fortnite the emotes that were brought into the game was unholy enough
---
You've been imbued with the ghost of Prince.
---
Really?
---
I figured the Goal Posts were set based on metrics Bethesda had collected over the past year.  They know how many Scorched are killed on average every week.  
---
They likely set the initial 25% goal at a value that was already being achieved every single week.  The 'stretch' goal is likely very close to the average killed.  Maybe as extreme as average per week +15-20%
---
Events like this are designed to get game exposure and draw in more players.  Bethesda wants us to succeed in order to foster a feeling of goodwill with the gaming community.  They do not want bad press of "Fallout 76 player community is too small to achieve stretch goal".
---
Could an Instigating PA Damage Meat Hook outclass a Power Fist with the same effects?  I'm running full health and pretty much capitalizing on the fact that a running attack counts as a power attack.
---
I couldn't even get past the first part without the server disconnecting my entire team, everyone's game crashing, or lag that locks every door
---
Its ridiculous
---
So aside from everyone else who says team up and hit mobs... which is effective, a good solo way to do it is to claim workshops, do the first defend, and claim another. The west side of the map is safer for low levels. Then server hop and start all over again. You'll get a good amount of XP and other random junk and plans that you can sell, trade or whatever.
---
Solo Queens?
---
I'm with ya. I'm looking forward to Wastelanders, but I'm glad I got to experience this game without the NPC's. I loved following the plots (especially Order of Mysteries and the BoS arc) without NPC's in the empty solitude of WV...
---
Actually I looked over it and I'm using an Instigating PA damage Power Fist so my running attack should be doing crazy damage.
---
Dance emotes have been in online games for literal decades. If anything, it wouldn't be because of that game.
---
They could have lowered the chance without ruining the entire area.
---
 So  you'd rather be dead soon, than be labeled as a "weakling, failure,  loner, psycho or mental"?  Dying is better than depression since you got  a sloppy kiss?  Your words.  And you have the balls to use this as an excuse to want to be immortalized?
---
As someone who has dealt with cancer AND mental illness in the immediate family... screw you.
---
You just have to kill Scorched or scorched animals (everything with Scorched in the name except Scorchedbeasts).  There are plenty of low leveled Scorched around Morgantown airport, sometimes around Flatwoods too.  Just kill any of them and you'll be helping out.
---
If I were a betting man I would put my money on it being released after the New Year.
---
The player legendary system being moved until next year tells me they are far behind schedule.
---
 Almost everything has been delayed since the game was released so I'm not really expecting Wastelanders to be released in November or even December.
---
Keep the vampire's
---
Yeah, I'm aware for high value trades it isn't even a temporary fix. At least the good trade servers have couriers. Overall a good suggestion though, and needed
---
From what I've seen on other threads, it's updated manually by an employee, not an automated script.  So no work on weekends = no updates.
---
Thats what i thought. I mean its still going. How long before mentats wear off?
---
I‚Äôd rather have the time and effort spent on qol bugs instead of dumb shit that adds no value
---
I agree with you, will be really bad for Bethesda if we don't achieve it. It will look bad on them, but at the same time they're not at fault. The gaming population is just a little low
---
World of Warcraft, League of Legends, and ESO have dancing . That‚Äôs yo name a few
---
I'd basically start from Vault 76 and hit in this order:
---
Gorge Junkyard
---
Tyler Country Dirt Track
---
back to V76
---
Sunshine Meadows Industrial Farm (if there's power start up the food processor.)
---
Billings Homestead
---
Lakeside Cabins
---
Wade Airport
---
Poseidon Energy Plant Yard (Get used to running the "Powering Up" event. More XP and gives Sunshine Meadows power for the food processor, and you'll get the generator plans.)
---
Charleston Landfill
---
The defends will wait a good few minutes before they fail, and if they do, you can still get the retake workshop event.
---
Just two buddies and I. We drop about 6 times every night on XB1. Their both bloody meat hook builds and I keep the adds off them but I can light the queen up as well. Not one of us have gotten this challenge to pop yet because SVQ won‚Äôt register just like a week or two ago the kill different Scorched challenge wouldn‚Äôt pop for anyone either, so that makes me wonder if Bethesda can‚Äôt get this challenges to read creatures right how do we know that the game can read everyone‚Äôs kill on ever scorched creature?
---
1. Rifleman Perks if it's modded to Semi-Auto, or Commando Perks for Full Auto, Then Demolition Expert to increase the Explosive Damage, and Grenadier to increase the area of Effect, are all the basic perks. In Agility you want the Covert Operative perk to use in combination with Stealth for up to 2.5 times normal Damage while sneaking, Sneak level 3, Escape Artist, and a suppressor round out the Stealth bonus.
---
My Instigating Explosive Combat Rifle (Semi-Auto) with hardened Receiver hits for \~1100 on the first shot, which is enough on most enemies.
---
My DR with regular armor is 604/650. Not worthy switching I guess.
---
You can sell the power armor. Frame with pieces is droppable. If the other person removes any piece off they won‚Äôt be able to replace and/or trade or do anything with the removed piece
---
I started a new guy and leveled him up during the double xp weekend but I only did up through the Morgantown Airport part of the main quest (for radaway and rad-x whatever recipes). Holding off on the main story stuff until wastelanders comes out.
---
Look at your pipboy...
---
Right? Like a reward from scout master Treadly or something. Would love some of that.
---
My expectation is a small quest chain, probably around the size of the one that came with encrypted. Some new random events involving NPCs. Lots of bugs.
---
Anyone expecting anything the size of a full DLC from the single players games is going to be very disappointed I think.
---
[](/abbored)
---
No you don‚Äôt need prisoner collar
---
huh, I wonder why my stealth sniper and heavy weapons pa characters are at least equal to my commando and my melee?   
---
:P  
---
I expect bloodied will get nerfed eventually though.  Personally I'd prefer it if other options got boosted but I don't see Bethesda as a company that really "gets" how to balance a complicated RPG metagame in a multiplayer environment like fo76.
---
&gt; specifically with more weapons
---
Not necessarily "more" weapons, we need more *viable* ones, and for some of the useless/redundant ones to be removed from the loot pool. Why would anyone want to use a bowie knife or sledgehammer when both of them have direct upgrades in the form of the combat knife and super sledge?
---
&gt;more legendary effects
---
Again, we don't need to further dilute the pool and make the RNG even worse, they just need to tweak some of the existing effects and drop a couple of them. Mutants should work like Junkies, where you get 10% damage per mutation capped at 5. Nocturnal needs to be removed, or they need to add a complementary effect that increases damage during the day so that you can have 2 weapons that function well no matter what time it is. 
---
&gt;a bump to the gear level cap
---
I don't know if we're quite there yet, but I do think they should change it so that the "top tier" of each enemy has a level above 50. It's frustrating as fuck to kill glowing mole miners or the nightstalker only to be rewarded with a level 35 piece. Make those enemies max out at level 50+ so it's possible to get max level gear from them.
---
Watoga High school!
---
Trans is represented in the rainbow. There isn‚Äôt really an agreement on what the transgender flag is so it would be surprising to see it implemented in a mainstream game.
---
Thats why i asked. Where do i look? Because in "stat" it doesnt say anything new.
---
They exist
---
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/edit
---
Exactly.
---
At Quakecon they said there would be a major ‚ÄúBalance pass‚Äù. What that will look like, we don‚Äôt know.
---
You probably got shot by a vox syringer. Too bad that quest is not repeatable by 90% of the players.
---
This guy knows where it's at.  I think November is too early.  Releasing it incomplete would be a deathknell.  I hope they take their time.
---
the rng in this game has always been streaky.  Whenever I get a good roll from mmrugh I press on and it's very common to get similar effects in subsequent items.  
---
That said, I'm convinced your good luck is as likely to have happened at any time compared to your example.  It's just dumb luck and there's no rhyme or reason to it other than like I said: keep buying if you already got 1 or 2 good effects.
---
Ah so that‚Äôs how they do it. Thanks
---
[https://i.imgur.com/uWmIYdM.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/uWmIYdM.jpg)
---
came here to say this :D
---
Yea, the fact that nearly every build is "Keep your max  hp below 25-30%" irks me a lot, too.
---
But when I look at fa76builds reddit, or any of the build websites, they're all so incredibly dated.  Builds from 8-10 months ago almost exclusively except for a few new builds that all seem to be "Commando" or "Melee".  Shotgun isn't even mentioned anymore after the TSE nerfs, which really bothers me.  I love using shotguns but not if they're really in that bad of a place now.
---
I upvoted you we can't have you running around Appalachia with hurt feelz.
---
This makes sense! because i did see someone run around with a syringer. 
---
thanks alot! i dont even know if others see me in purple as well.
---
Could you even imagine the shit storm if it gathered flux.

No but I want to

I'm helping, finished Powering Up Poseidon just now! Events can help with that, just kill all the Scorched on your way.

I think scrapping ammo would be great. To add to it  have it affected by the ammosmith perk. Having to turn them in as batches much like they are crafted, but with less materials gained . So say turn in  a batch of 30 44 rounds , you get 1xlead,1x gunpowder and 1x steel, or 100x 5mm to get 1xlead, 1x gunpowder, 1x steel. If you have ammosmith rank one it requires 1/2 the ammo to turn in so 15 rounds of 44 or 50x 5mm. Than  Ammo Smith rank 2 doubles your returns so 15 rounds of 44 nets 2lead ,2gun powder ,2x steal obviously numbers could be tweaked. But hey some turn in is better than none.

I‚Äôd rather have a laughing emote.
---
As a long time Fallout 76 loyalist from launch I hear you.
---
Trying to do Vault 94 with my friends is the last time I played Fallout 76.
---
Everything terminal/ switch/ control lagged. The XP was laughable &amp; my character clipped into the floor right at the very end so I couldn't even complete the raid.
---
I made more XP/ had more fun from 5 minutes of  "One Violent Night" than 2+ hours of Vault 94.
---
It was the Vox syringer :)
---
For what it's worth:
---
I will be erecting a Vault Boy statue with your name in my CAMP when I get home, and there it will stay.
---
What name do you prefer? And I hope you're cool with music because I'm going to surround you with instruments so Wastelanders will jam funky tunes in your honor for eternity.
---
Travel well, brother.
---
It was the Vox syringer :) thanks a lot tho!!
---
i love it. i think that some of the gliches or removed legacys are great!
---
the meat hook (probs not a glitch) is super op and rare. which balenc it.
---
the legacys are rare which helps the market. and it makes og players feel remember.
---
You can take all the junk out of your stash and hop into Fissure Site Prime, that'll give you something to do for awhile
---
I hope they give us double exp as a bonus reward. I'm trying to grind for Hellfire before Wastelanders comes out.
---
He was out Killing Scorched like you should have been.
---
Doesn't matter if we hit the required amount of kills, they are giving it after screwing up my melee drops last discount. And I'm sure they aren't above just fudging the numbers and adding a few mil kills.
---
Damn that's a badass reference guide , thanks
---
I occassionally miss the NPC encounters but I mostly enjoy the quiet and empty world. Besides, I get visited a lot by Mr. Prize Bot so it's never too lonely lol
---
They drop, just gotta nuke fissure prime on the regular.  
---
As for why it's so rare, I dunno.  They arbitrarily chose a bunch of items to be hard to learn all the mods for.  Radium rifle, lever, gauss, ultracite, etc.  
---
There doesn't seem to be a whole lot of rhyme or reason to it.
---
If they do more of these community challenges, the site needs to be updated every hour or make something in game that updates. That site was the same number all week and that's just bs
---
time limits are inherently not fun.
---
infinite mobs are bad design. 
---
the rewards are very limited. they should triple the amount of steel you get each time. 
---
there is no Looking-For-Group functionality, which makes it hard to find people to attempt the raid with.
---
This isn‚Äôt FarmVille. FOH.
---
I actually meant all rifles. My bad.
---
I have zero need for a dancing emote.
---
You floop the pig but failed to realize this is a different game and if you don't love Bethesda and all its glory you will be punished by a negative karma. Take my upvote even if it doesn't offset the circlejerk group of fallout 76 fanboys.
---
I gave you that like and sub. Look forward to your next video.   
---
Good luck and you got this. :D
---
Meh the vampire one is better but neither are incredible.
---
What. The. Actual. Fuck
---
Water is one thing
---
Jumping into a vat of FEV is a whole other
---
But not with Aquaboy/girl apparently
---
Have you found out how to fix it
---
One of the WS vendor bots usually has them.  Graham sometimes does as well.
---
Aw dang, that sucks, yeah I had a "commendation" and that doesn't work either
---
That's an extremely widespread and popular saying.
---
Nice! Thanks!
---
So, I played this game on both PS4 and Xbox One, both alone and with friends... and I don't regret none of the +500 hours I played. Especially thanks to the Player vending I've met new people to play with and I had a lot of fun. The game have still some problem, mostly minor bugs and crashes once in a while and the Vault Raids were a half failure in my opinion but I'm sure that with the introduction of private servers in 2020 they will became the great addiction to the game that should have been from the beginning. I personally think that public events like Meat Week and the Fassnacht Parade were a blast and I'm happy to had the time to play both; in the end this game had, and still have a lot of potential and I think Wastelanders will be a fine addiction to the game. If you want to use this in your video you can and Kevduit, you do quality content and I love your videos
---
Awesome! Thanks so much
---
I‚Äôm guessing bloodied gets nerfed to oblivion and handmade damage as well.  
---
Melee likely gets hit hard. 
---
Likely eliminate double dip weapons like pipe revolver and meat hook
---
Likely add plain drills back to legendary table.
---
Wow to be honest i cant believe some people are this serious about the in game economy. You hord acid because of the market?
---
I can hardly find things to buy these days after pretty much having bought every plan there is. 
---
Also yea i found out about the bulk thing a while ago and only because the same thing had happened to me :( Now i just never bulk lol. Also someone ever noticed how things like wood say 0.03 weight but if you insert like 5 to your stash it counts as like 2? :(
---
Maybe Bethesda actually did the math to make sure we get enough kills but miscalculated on how many players are quiting or leaving for new games showing how dire our situation is getting without modders fixing their games for them.
---
They‚Äôre fixing it. I‚Äôm about to make an update post.
---
Holy cow you have gone to lala land and back about justifying bugging people that just want to be left alone. This is why I prefer single player games, don't have to worry about griefers like you.
---
The only real shakeup in months has been the fixer rifle usurping the handmade.
---
They need to buff so many weapons and legendary affixes. I would love to see some shake up without nerfing stuff.
---
There could be 2 things that happened to cause this (these have happened to me in the past). 
---
1: If you logged on and your CAMP could not be placed, then all of the items in your display cases are now just 'loose' in your stash, so they can now be auto-scrapped until you get to a world where your CAMP can be placed.
---
2: The item is still actually in the case, it just visually isn't showing up. Un-assigning and re-assigning it fixes this.
---
Dang, that sucks. Yeah, I have a "commendation" in misc and it won't show up either. (although it looks really cool in inventory)
---
The Forest, Ash Heap, &amp; Toxic Valley regions seem to be appropriately balanced for the low level players, but Savage Divide, Mire &amp; CB Bog were excessively nerfed, I think Savage Divide range should be increased a bit, Mire &amp; CB Bog should always be Max Level.
---
For all those who think Bloodied is the Meta, and the Only way to handle High level areas with ease, I have 2 characters;
---
* Level 340+ Stealth Rifleman, (Full Health) Vanguard's Armor &amp; Instigating Weapons, One Shots nearly anything, seldom dies, very Tanky.
---
* Level 70+ Bloodied, Stealth, Unyielding/Bolstering Armor &amp; Bloodied Weapons, does significantly more damage, but dies frequently, very Squishy.
---
I enjoy playing both, but if I had to choose one for a Solo attempt on the SBQ, or just to wander the Wasteland alone without the support of my regular team, it would be the Full Health build.
---
Capitalism my good friend, Bethesda is the 1% we are the 99%.
---
Does this mean the spell is overridden by teammates?  Like if I have suppressor and my teammate has tenderizer we are cancelling each other out?  
---
Or is it just that each player can only cast 1 spell at a time so if I have suppressor that my only contribution, and my teammate can use tenderizer, and thus between the 2 of us both effects would be working?
---
Yeah, I found that there too! I think you can also find that in the house with Sweetwater at the Giant Tea Pot.
---
I never really cared for the raids, it wasn't something that was going to bring me back, and now I'm waiting for something that will
---
I hope so! I'd love to see more build varieties without feeling they were 'sub-optimal' but more than that, it's been a long time since I found anything even remotely challenging. 
---
The nearest I have come is the vault raids but 'challenge' should not come from terminal lag üôÑü§î
---
5% less atoms per challenge for two weeks üßôüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I think it's will be ok... They've been working on it for awhile.  This game has allot of people that play just to find exploits...
---

---
Certainly possible the person was being a racist troll, but as previously stated in the thread, this is also one of the wonderful things griefers have been up to.
---
No. Then people will just have more trash in their vendors to make caps.
---
Pretty sure I heard it on MASH
---
no they did it this way so it would actually work with multiple people otherwise because of how the apply combat hit spell works they would get overridden Answered by /u/Eckserah
---
I (lvl 53) got attacked at a workshop by a lvl 148 in x-01 power armor, came out of no where and took me out immediately. I sought revenge. He was hiding in a cabin shooting out my turrets, i snuck up and started huckin grenades through the window. After a lengthy battle he came at me with a super sledge, i gave him the run around repaired a couple turrets, lured him into the open and laid into him with my handmade. It was a lot of fun!
---
He then nuked my camp which wasn't so fun, but all in all, no regrets!
---
Now that just downright stingy.
---
Can‚Äôt fast travel in PA if you are overencumbered.  Which is very easy to become, sine pa allows you to carry so much weight and still sprint.
---
Legendary players, next year. Test server, next year. Private servers, maybe summer. (maybe not)
---
I suspect we won't get full of Wastelanders, the NPCs and their quests part, this year. We might be little lucky to get the majority of them.
---
Second vault raid seems to have forgotten.
---
I don't know how to write this better, I don't mean to sound as pessimistic. I was personally only looking forward really into the legendary player thing, and because it will take several months...well, whatever it takes.
---
Bought the Orange Pip-Boy before it vaulted and then quickly realized it clashes with all my preferred outfits. Didnt even think wearing it for Halloween. Thanks!
---
Would be nice if they atleast included a timer with this cause of all the difderent time zones. 
---
I mean for all i know its going to end midnight Bethesda time which could be 4 for me?!
---
Not sure what you mean by "running attack" but I have a 2* instigating swing speed meat hook that pretty much 1 shots anything. I'm a Bloodied build so my str is around 35 most the time but I'm a full rifle build. I have zero perks for melee dmg an still 1 shot almost everything with it.
---
This is actually my 2nd one. My first one was on an old toon. I was L12 I think and ran into him up near the old war cemetery. He just annihilated my ass....and proceeded to do 5 more times as I kept going back for my junk bag. I finally gave up. LOL
---
I've actually been playing on and off since the very first load test of the servers. I've just never taken a toon past L20 and quit playing a few times after dealing with waves of griefers. Right now, I started over with a new toon, from scratch, and am trying to play through and finish the main storyline (and as many of the smaller side quests as possible) before Wastelanders drops.
---
It's terrible, I hate all the people who think it's funny to run around pretending to be a raider or some shit that doesn't make any sense. I'd rather have the actual Brotherhood of Steel instead of some random guy who is wearing a pay to win coat that completely breaks the lore, claiming that he's the Elder and picking favorites and such. NPCs work in a very different way, where instead of having people who pretend like they're raiding workshops for "their own survival in the harsh wasteland", someone (an NPC) who actually would need those supplies could do it instead, taking the whole edgy teenager vibe of getting killed at a workshop out. I don't understand why people think it's a bad idea to add NPCs, even the way they set it up (which they stole entirely from NV) is great, and now I can actually enjoy it in a game that doesn't have me moving slower that whatever the wasteland equivalent of a snail is.
---
Emotes are super useful, I can't think of a way of communicating on all platforms that's as viable. 
---
If you don't have a mic or keyboard emotes are the only way to communicate
---
Well, when it comes to e.g. the Sheepsquatch DLC, I played through it with immersion the first time, then rushed through it the second time. First time felt like quality content, the second was a lot of button pressing and fast traveling
---
They do,it's fun to turn everyone purple.
---
All hail the overlord flatwood monster.
---
What are you doing there, no scorched in those places.
---
I also run a plasma flamer and a TSE lever.
---
Man, that plasma.flamer is deadly. I have 10 different ones that I'm testing out to see which is better. I have a Furious fire rate one, anti armor one, quad long damage, one 2 shot, and a few others.
---
People don't realize how OP this weapon is, I can melt the imposter sheepsquatch with about 40-60 seconds of sustained fire.
---
Yes. I second that.
---
Drumstick can be found stuck in a molerat at The Freak Show near Huntersville
---
I just want Bathtub Planters (or planters in general but tubs would be cool). There is a shack in the Divide that has tubs filled with dirt with Carrots and Corn growing in them so someone on development had the same idea as well.
---
Already planned to be added back(enabled) to the game but expect it to be part the atoms shop. Really hope they don't make it cost same as a power armor skin.
---
See y'all down at Camden park
---
In addition to the possible changes already mentioned, I'm hoping for a balance change for the chainsaw. A really cool weapon, if it was usable outside the very early low level areas in the Forest.
---
That's awesome! Thanks man
---
Like I said, we all matter but none of us matter.
---
Life is just moments. 
---
You'll help them out and they'll smile and maybe best case they'll remember that moment their whole lives but realistically it'll be forgotten as soon as the next important moment arrives.
---
Things DO matter. People DO matter.
---
But ultimately, they don't don't matter.
---
It all ends. 
---
Love and hate, happiness and sorrow, pleasure and pain.
---
People might think this is sad but I see it as a good thing. I see it as empowering.
---
I think blacksmith hammer and possibly claw hammer can be found attached to one of the workbenches in the basement where you go for the mistress of mystery questline. There are 3 hammers down there in total
---
Raid number two is just the worst
---
Either sort by weight, which you'd do if you knew how to press Q, or don't collect every single piece of fucking clothing in the game.
---
Hope to get it finished soon. Some wiring issues. Really pushing my camp building abilities. Damn camp budget is limiting me and I'm afraid of taking my plushes out of the display cases and accidentally scrapping them when building something new.
---
Running attacks classify as power attack and benefit from PA boosting gear. Or so I've been told.
---
I appreciated you succinctness
---
Ranged weapons at first. Then some melees. Then armor.
---
I have played fo76 when it got released because of this specific reason then stopped as reality got into my gaming time...now as im settling again and everything seems going to normal this time comes again...is fo76 generally better game then when it got released? i still have my modded fo4 just in case, just curious about fo76 progress...
---
The legendary drop rates and gun nerfs were improvements, it‚Äôs a good thing the overpowered explosive build was fixed
---
Trust man, someone on here was saying recently that they should be taken away from Rifleman builds and given to Commandos I was like naaaaaah. But yeah mega powerful, very limited on the range though, ammo weighs a shit load and expensive to craft. I've primed mine for the damage boost and I fly through cobalt flux, one of my favourite weps though for sure.
---
An understandable concern!
---
"I always have a torque room" not something I hear everyday
---
Never called you greifer since I agree that if you take a workshop you should be open to the possibility that someone will start PVP with you since that is how the game mechanic is set up.  If someone is 100% against PVP then they shouldn't claim a workshop.
---
However I do also think just tearing apart builds by other people in workshops you don't actually plan to keep is a plainly dickish move.  It doesn't benefit anyoe and you come off looking like a petty asshole instead of a mighty hunter of 'the most dangerous game'.
---
Just my opinion.
---
I'm gonna go against the grain and say no.  I bet that the people working on the Wastelanders stuff are focused on physical changes and all the NPC coding that needs to go in before the update, and not really looking at things like loot tables and weapon balance.
---
I can see *maybe* a minor fix here of there if it directly relates to issues with the DLC, but not a whole pass on balance.  They seem short handed enough as it is without rolling too many things into the update.
---
IMO, weapons/spec balancing will come when/if they pull the plug on NW and make it a permanent, non-beta thing (though I could see them doing it if they re-release Survival, though my money is that NW will come first).
---
There isnt such a thing..there is sneak attack power attack an normal attacks. I dont even use power attacks instigating normal attacks are strong enough.
---
November
---
who hurt you?
---
She not giving you good rolls huh?
---
No. No we don't.
---
The day isn't over yet for Europe or America, there's still time.
---
Already planned to have Ammo Converter added to game but it was mentioned same time when they mentioned they were planning on adding a fridge and repair kits so expect it to cost atoms so start saving!
---
Damn I had someone drop two nukes across Watoga and north Cranberry Bog recently, wrecked my alts camp I was gutted. Always gotta check the map lol, I'm guilty of assuming it's SBQ and not checking the map til I'm about the fast travel.
---
That is why I put things in display cases, keeps em from getting scrapped. Same with Vendors with high prices. Only way I know of to keep from accidentally scrapping items in the stash.
---
No
---
Is the 50% limb chance more normal now?  I was getting it 4/5 I swear.  I‚Äôve got 5 characters and about 3000 scrip saved.  
---
If so I‚Äôll likely spend 1000 on melee + recycle and 2000 on range weapons.  Wish I could justify throwing scrip at armor but with 5 slots and so much variance in possible rolls the weapons just seem a better option.
---
Its more that they have moved onto these once a month "named\\numbered" patches - like as in Patch 14 coming next week.  They do one huge patch with all the bug fixes at once and then hotfix if they broke something with the big patch. 
---
Better or worse, that seems to be their pattern now since... July? 
---
The CMs have mentioned its on the list.  Now,the big x factor is if its coming in Patch 14 or it was too hard to fix and its coming later in Patch 15 and\\or Wastelanders
---
I hear another body has been found.
---
I don't think you can prove that..
---
Pretty much focus on farming scrip. I usually get 40-100 scrip when I play but if I focus on legendarys (running popular spots, hitting events with guaranteed legendaries) then I can get a stock pile of them and hit 150/day easy.   
---
I got up to 800 scrip, blew through it last week and i think Im back at 400 now.
---
I don't know why people still romanticize two shot. Two shot turns guns into glorified Melees.
---
So psyched, thought it was over at noon. I will personally add 1000 scorch b4 midnight. Did about 200 this morning. Big bend tunnel, line in the Sand, Scorched Earth!!!
---
There will always be people who claim it‚Äôs no better, and give valid reasons as to why it‚Äôs a bad game, but honestly, from an average gamer who loves Fallout lore in general, I‚Äôd say ultimately yes, it‚Äôs better than it was at launch. There‚Äôs a handful of borderline unacceptable bugs but I honestly think they will be addressed along with the DLC.
---
Thanks for the downvotes guess yall want stuff broken so you can abuse the systems.
---
Over the past 13 days, an average of 2,575,385 per day, so we could potentially get to around 36,055,385.  I think that we'll get it!
---
Why did you fuck it?
---
I really hope stuff like this is better by the time Wastelanders comes out :/
---
Use whatever you want of my opinion.
---
One of the main reasons i enjoy Bethesda games is the care and thought that goes into them. I really like finding all the hidden things and dioramas set up with the teddy bears, the world building is fantastic. However with 76 i get the feeling that so many things are left as "it will do" and "we will fix that later" and it drags the whole thing down. Several of the changes made, fixes implemented come over as someones first mod (ill thought out and based on zero thought of balance) rather than a carefully thought out and integrated addition to the base game.
---
 Many of the bugs and issues that affect gameplay have been left in for so long it is clear the "we will fix it later" is not happening, or they do not consider it an issue, or worse they do not know how to fix something. I expect better of a AAA developer. I know the studio working on the game is new to this, but Bethesda is not. So there are two options, Bethesda does not actually care about the game, or they do care..but not enough to move staff around to help.
---
I have seen people mention all the job listings for this game and how it shows how much effort will be going into the game etc, but to me i just wonder if that means so many people have quit from lack of support and do not want this game on their resume. If that is the case and they are extremely short staffed then why isnt BGS helping. This is one of their main franchises and feels like it is just drifting along half the time. The have a plan for this game, it could be a major cash cow. Fallout is one of those excellent worlds than has a million stories to tell, endless possibilities and this game feels like they are incapable of fleshing anything out. 
---
I have put thousands of hours into FO3, i never felt bored even though i had done everything before, half the time i am playing 76 i feel i am grinding, i am only playing for something to do, so i do not miss out of free atoms or whatever. The gameplay loop is great when there is new things to see and do, but the game quickly runs out of things and the patches are not huge. The community tends to blow things massively out of proportion to what an update will add and how it will expand the base game. I have concern wastelanders will be more of the same. Part of the problem is BGS does not really share much of is actually coming up...partly because if they did it would quickly cover everything new so people would lose interest as the much waited for patch is a couple of quick quests and a new thing to grind.
---
I have high hopes that this game will go on and do great things but i do wonder if i stopped playing for a year...how long would it actually take me to catch up and do everything new. I feel way too many people are prepared to give BGS a pass for the shambles this game released as, How they have no experience with this type of game...which is completely true..assuming we completely ignore Elder Scrolls ONLINE.  
---
The over priced atom shop is annoying, Yes obviously they need to finance the game moving forward. Which is what we signed up for when we bought the game. But why is the shop not filled with so many things people actually want? We are one year in and other than asset flips from FO4 (mechanist,battle coat etc) we have not had anything from previous game. I could come up with 5000 things the Atom Shop could have had in stock this year that would be far more desired than reskins of flag poles and tires etc.  The atom shop, like the game is basically half assed and acting like it is GOTY material.
---
Disappointed but not ready to give up on it.
---
I couldn't even do the raid, I know your pain.
---
Disconnected from server on 4/5 attempts. Pretty sad, I was looking forward to it. I completed One mission, once.
---
Your post deserves more likes. Thank you for doing this post.
---
honestly they kind of dropped the ball on that by not splitting up the photos from burrows / project paradise / vault raids into 3 separate categories and people getting confused because they thought it was all same thing
---
as for the dive armor I'm thinking we will be getting it when they release the other hazard armors like that toxin power armor we saw in wastelanders video - I'd love to see something like a flooded mine to explore
---
I love this game , it's a buggy mess, but everything Bethesda has ever made is a buggy mess. I play it every day though. So either they are doing something right , or I'm crazy. I don't doubt the latter at all  , as others have expressed that opinion in the past. But my kind of crazy loves all the inventory management, looting and crafting loop. Regardless, make it funny and informative, been watching your vids for a few years now, always laugh.
---
They'll round it even if we're short. There's too many top shelf alternatives out now or looming close for them to risk losing players.
---
In the stash yes please, in the pipboy I don't want another basically empty tab to cycle through.
---
Ive even gone and modded my zelots gatling gun (my very first weapon from the purveyor) with prime receiver to kill scorched faster.
---
All I'm saying is I believe there might be more than meets the eye in TS, if you consider the results separately per each projectile type
---
Level 18 is really low for the Wendigo Cave and most of the Savage Divide, as well as the regions east of it. At this point I'd suggest taking a break from the main quest and exploring the Ash Heap and Toxic Valley to level up.
---
Start doing events and just exploring the map a bit. Avoid the mire and cranberry bog. Level up a bit and come back to the main quest later. Farm supermutant s at Grafton steel and the lumber Mill at the top left corner of the map, they have good XP and are easy to kill . If you don't have a decent legendary weapon try to farm the wolf even that pops up at the ferris wheel on the map. You get 3 1* legendaries every time. Do the event, server hop untill you find it again. What kind of weapons do you use?
---
Thank you for the kind words Stranger!
---
Had 1 during the clean up, only one I have ever seen. A 1* at prime, after a Scorched Earth.
---
It's actively why I would play it after work.  
---
Working customer service in a Best Buy, you really don't want to deal with humans by day's end.  
---
But going out, enjoying the scenery, and maybe working with some others to blow up a horrible giant bat monster? That's a nice way to close the day.
---
There definitely is such a thing. Standing still and doing a regular attack does far less damage than running and doing a regular attack.
---
The accuracy issue on Two-Shot weapons is only an issue when Hip Fired, if Aiming, both projectiles hit the same spot, Shotguns behave a little differently in that they only add one extra pellet, and therefore don't seem to do the additional 25% damage that they should.
---
If your on Xbox I need someone to offload my shotgun shells off of my characters.
---
Then handcraft the blocks to the procedurally generated caves. This is an online game. It needs replayability. This is a game that has its map underutilised. This is a way to make all of it more interesting.
---
I could argue tearing everything down benefits the low level cap poor player that comes along legitimately wanting to claim the workshop. That in effect makes the people using this tactic the griefers.
---
The reality of it is I am playing the game. My OP was not the least bit sarcastic, I am legitimately thanking people for this because it has given me something to do.
---
That's one way to beat him. Drain that ap.
---
You‚Äôre getting to the hardest part of the game. Levels 25-40 are tough because you are too strong for the forest/toxic valley/ash heap but too weak for most of the remaining areas. 
---
A big part of that is high level players spawning high level enemies. There was a patch that capped enemy levels at some quest locations but it‚Äôs still an issue.
---
Best you can do is keep grinding the low level areas to level up. Stay well rested for bonus XP. It‚Äôs boring and grindy but once you get over the hump you can easily explore the rest of the map.
---
Definitely not . A representative for Beth said so on one of these threads. Scorched are here to stay.
---
Thanks for your advice, I thought I would be too low of a level to be there, I‚Äôll focus on grinding some areas and maybe doing a few side quests here and there, I‚Äôm running an automatic rifle build but I like the melee combat aswell, I was told not to worry about my build too much tbf
---
Ok. Thats good to know. I was just speculating anyway. Thanks.
---
Check Modus too. I see them at the Production Terminal often
---
Good to hear that Bethesda is helping you friend.
---
U need some ammorunies
---
Thank you I‚Äôm very relieved.
---
Just run queen events and we can do it no problem

Here's a map that helps explain the leveled areas in FO76 ([MAP](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-12-21-fallout-76-map-level-zones-5076)). At 18, I'd spend my time enjoying the forest and moving up into the Toxic Valley. TV has a bunch of cool quests, scarier mobs, some good dailies, and a much more wasteland feel. Then in about 7 levels head down to ash heap for a bit. After you level up a bit, get back into that cave and solo the wendigo.
---
Was just asking weapons cause have one or two low level ones stashed away. I have an instigating vats accuracy lvl 20 pipe revolver you could have if ya want . Don't have any automatics stashed away right now
---
Good to hear that they straightened it out for you. Also a good reminder that everyone needs to tighten the security on their accounts with two step verification and other safeguards.
---
All 3* ranged weapons
---
Replayability I guess, keep you busy after something
---
Yes! After busy days IRL, sometimes I just sit in my camp and listen to crickets for a few minutes. I hope maybe we‚Äôve teamed up on said giant bat bitch before lol.
---
My CAMP is in the Bog with nothing around but wood, and the Bot collects all sorts scrap, it's not a ton of anything but a little of everything.
---
In short, it's truly just a cosmetic item for your camp, that does a little something besides just eat budget.
---
god dammit people STOP TRUSTING THE PIPBOY NUMBERS AND DAMAGE NUMBER POPUPS, THEY ARE WORTHLESS. Armor penetration is built into all damage, so higher damage needs less armor penetration bonuses than low dmg hits. like a lever action vs a minigun. The minigun needs armor penetration, the lever action needs it less. the formula is (roughly) enemy armor value x6.66 = amount of damage needed to penetrate all armor. enemies in this game range from 0 armor to 300 armor, meaning that if you are hitting for 2000 dmg on a 300 armor target.. you need no additional armor pen because AA does not reduce enemy armor below zero for bonus damage. it quickly becomes useless against low armor targets.
---
Correct. I wish 2 step was available with our actual Bethesda accounts but at minimum everyone should do it if they have Microsoft accounts.
---
+20% damage to everything and double the explosive damage is still effective
---
Wouldn't 1-handed have better DPS than 2-handed making it better for longer fights? The super sledge takes like 2.4 seconds to start a second swing.
---
The bunker you found nearby was just a coincidence. This random encounter can happen all over the map and is, honestly, the one I find most often. Every time I roll up on a random encounter location I whisper under my breath 'this better not be freaking Kora again...' and sure enough, her rotting corpse and duffel bag mock me.
---
Armor armor and more armor.
---
really glad they decided to help out of their own accord. it's a nice change.
---
but unless your password was "password" I'll just assume they still haven't fixed the mismatching credentials thing, where users will randomly log into other users' accounts.
---
I'm building a one-handed melee character and have questions. Why are you using the Shishkebab? How do you do with fast weapons like knives?
---
the AA "cap" is that you cant reduce armor below zero, so AA becomes useless when you are already doing high damage against low armor targets.
---
I second that with a resounding ***HELL NO***. I wish we could somehow survey their vendors by remote, but I suppose that would cut into the anti-inflation fast travel caps sink.  
---
I do agree with OP's frustration, though.  I get sick and tired of wasting time and caps on trash vendors.
---
My base is just south of the dam, a nuke has never landed anywhere near it until the day the guy who attacked me decided to launch a nuke
---
I went in knowing nothing about the raid and did the novice level solo expecting something doable solo going from room to room clearing out enemies with some tougher enemies here and there until a final boss.  And of course terminals and notes scattered throughout giving some lore about the place.  You know, like a raid version of a vault from the previous games.  I figured if there were 3 difficulties that the easiest one would be doable solo then standard requiring some buddies and then expert requiring a real team and a lotta effort.  Nope, I was wrong.  It was endless waves of high level enemies in great numbers that gave next to no XP and terminals that I couldn't spend the time to read because they took so long to load and enemies were spawning non-stop.  I got to the first major room and was already sick of it after the second wave of ghouls.  I figured I'd try toughing it out and unlocked the next room and after I saw it was filled with cave crickets I just gave up and let them kill me.  Even if it is doable solo, I don't want to try it.  And even in a group I don't think I would want to either.  Endless waves of resource sink enemies just isn't fun.  I was expecting an actual challenge and an actual vault, not endless waves of enemies while I hurry to grab keycards to fill a check list.  The lead up to the first major room was great and I thought that was what the vault was going to be like but after entering the first major room it was just wave after wave of bullshit and I don't want to play that.
---
Curious about the OPs password too. Was it very weak?
---
Absolutely not.
---
I also hate when people use the word "we" as if you speak for everybody.
---
Not justifying anything. I was asked a really good question, and I made my best effort to answer it. Regardless, my answer is outside the context of my original post, in which I was very much non sarcastically thanking people.
---
Maybe you would also find notepad more preferable to multiplayer notepad aka Reddit. 
---
I do indeed hope that the next time you roll a new toon in this game and find yourself wanting to claim Grafton Steel or the Gorge Junkyard, you encounter a fully built out monstrosity that costs 200 caps. Hell, that sounds like a fantastic new griefing tactic for all the real griefers out there to start using.

That's for the Play Time daily quest. The one where the nanny bot sends you to collect toys or go kill things as part of your homework. AFAIK, the only in-game thing pointing you towards mama murmur is the public alert notification in the personal terminal that mentions a seismic disturbance in the area.
---
Need?
---
I think they mean risky as in trusting the devs to do it properly.

The only place I go where scorched are is big bend tunnel to farm steel when I'm too lazy for west tek. I don't think I've gotten a legendary from my many runs on it.

I just love the mood of the game.
---
This game won my vote, I‚Äôve played many games before but I have a hard time getting into solo ones.  The connection doesn‚Äôt feel real, but with 76 I‚Äôve found a Brotherhood of Steel player made faction and my gosh it‚Äôs so fun.  The only reason I‚Äôm playing daily is because I get to explore a wasteland and feel like a badass crushing monsters, with a great group of people.  We don‚Äôt RP or anything, just stick to the BOS tactics, ranks, and clothing. 
---
Camp building is another great thing, it‚Äôs fully fledged and there are some really creative ideas for a home that anyone else can see.
---
Feel free to use I‚Äôd just rather keep my username out
---
But by your post, you dont. 
---
If you knew how this game works you would realize a bloodied build, even a shitty one, can one shot super muties all day long with no effort.  
---
This is not cheating, this is someone who knows how to use Adrenal Reaction, Nerd Rage, Bloody Mess, Rifleman, Expert and Master, Tank Killer along with a bloodied or instigating rifle.
---
Cheers for the advice buddy, that map will come in handy, I‚Äôm assuming most of the quests in the TV will come from exploring all the locations and such?
---
To clarify the other response, they can't move or delete anything placed by the camp owner, but they can build stuff and relocate or destroy things that they've built.
---
My Ultracite Gatling Plasma is ready to take out the scorched trash. Oorah!
---
Asking the important questions.
---
1H weapons have (generally) a faster swing speed, so the base damage will (and should) be lower.  Plus, doesn't the meat hook still benefit from 2 different perk sets?  It used to be the highest DPS melee weapon (or best weapon period), but I haven't kept up with melee at all.
---
&gt; It's sad because they are a fun challenge when there's little or no lag.
---
Yeah I'm willing to accept that Vault 94 raids aren't as fun or rewarding as other games (I only know FO76 raids so I take others' words for it) but I find myself enjoying even Meltdown when we're on a well-behaved server.
---
Over the past month I've had the opportunity to try all sorts of other builds and equipment other than the typical PA Bloodied .50 cal and it's been really fun. No other content in FO76 has pushed me to try different builds the way raids did.
---
Fair enough
---
I have a collectible baseball as well as an undamaged baseball mitt but I'm afraid I have no idea where I picked them up. I wish I could remember. A restored desk fan can be found on a table at the top of the tower at the Spruce Knob workshop.
---
One thing to keep in mind is that they've probably had to spend a lot of time making the tools they need for Wastelanders, and they likely would rather do that than release more quests without the level of interaction dialogue provides.
---
I'm level 49, waiting to hit the big 5-0 before attempting the wendingo cave again.....
---
I've enjoyed just messing around, exploring, building Camp after Camp and deciding how I'm gonna farm and craft for caps in the meantime.  It's been an absolute blast. What I'm saying is, don't rush it. Enjoy yourself in the wasteland and when you feel powerful enough to give it another crack go for it!
---
There is gonna be a lot of disappointment tomorrow lol
---
Or maybe a perk card that has a chance to get some caps back
---
I normally sort by weight when I'm looking for outfits or underarmor. Since I have no weight reduced armor and my power armors are labeled I can find everything easily
---
Tell you what, I'd kill for a .38 gatling gun reciever... pls beth.
---
When i read this, i initially didn't see that it was for fallout. I thought someone was beseeching some gods to do something about Earth's bodies of water.
---
"welp looks like you guys were 3 short. Oh well better luck next year."
---
I have the same problem.  Every time i log in my audio settings default to whatever they feel like.  I usually have to scroll through the auto, area and team settings as well to be able to hear anyone.
---
even when you account for attack speed, the only 1h weapon that can compete with 2h and unarmed is the combat knife and that's because of the stealth blade mod, so only while you're sneaking. for stealth melee, the combat knife is arguably the best weapon because it's silent.
---
but for everything else a DCG or a Supersledge will out-dps any 1h.
---
The poon gun always leaves ammo on the corpses when you use flechettes! I have to drop them occasionally
---
I honestly couldn't tell if it did or not
---
Thank you so much!  I would never have guessed the triangle source.  I got really lucky and got the triangle on my 5th turn-in! Soooo happy! 6% drop could have required a lot more candy than I have.
---
And the high-powered microscope is fantastic looking, and thanks again for all the info on this stuff. (I hope they add some of the unobtainable junk to the game somewhere in the future because it's fun trying to track it all down.)
---
It was looking at me all seductive like
---
I'm Lvl 25 ATM and honestly, some places are a real crapshoot in terms of opponents. 
---
The story seems to move a lot faster than you can level up so my advice is explore, explore and explore more.
---
Find locations, suss out the enemy from a distance and engage if you're confident or vacate and return later. 
---
Do events too. I started doing them at Lvl 20 and found it really helped.
---
Mostly I just wander around though. You find some cool shit that way.
---
I was just panicking, first time encounter
---
New in the atomic shop: A ruined statue of a right foot.
---
Oh yes, I've made several runs through there.  I'm kind of at an equilibrium point right now.  I've gotten to the point where I've crafted enough ammo (thanks Super Duper perk card &amp; Ammosmith) - and I've built up a reserve of plastic.  So now, whatever I pick up while wandering around has been enough to keep me going.
---
Cool story bro.
---
I apologize for throwing griefer in when you did not call me one. Clearly I allowed my defensiveness to overpower reading comprehension.
---
No lol, I said that because you said you pooned not owned or pwned.
---
This is a fucking stupid argument. I play games like Fallout to escape the insanity of the real world for a couple hours, and I don't need to be reminded of the assholes in the real world while I'm busy eating a feral ghoul for lunch.
---
It's not about being triggered or any of that nonsense, and it's not about my personal views on any topic. I am just as annoyed by a pro-Bernie camp site as I am by a MAGA themed pro-Trump camp, and there's no fucking excuse or justification that makes it OK to use racial or homophobic slurs. If you wouldn't say the N word to a black person IRL, what makes you think it's OK to do so online?
---
You can use BAE(Bethesda Archive Extractor) to locate the texture files and export them using that, opening in your favorite .dds compatible viewer(gimp).

You would also be able to use Nifscope to open the 3d models with textures directly, though I dont know very much about using that Answered by /u/Waffle_Cop

Sorry but how do his post show that this is potentially BS? I'm sure your right because people do this kind of shit all the time on Reddit (just look at the TIL sub, it's just people reposting facts for attention) but I don't get what your saying about his posts.

No one who wants a tinfoil hat would ever buy one from someone else...trust no one and all that :)

I was curious.

I have mine set to junk. I am curious what everyone else has there‚Äôs set too.
---
No, it wasn‚Äôt. It wasn‚Äôt anything anyone would have easily guessed, a series of random characters, punctuation marks, letters and numbers. It is 98% likely that what the previous commenter said is true. Mismatched credentials.
---
Your first scenario is what I world think is most likely to have happened, but the pumpkin showed up as the only piece of junk in my stash when I logged back in which seemed strange. Thanks for the responses!
---
35 million dead scorch is nothing to sneeze at
---
I just wanted to say ammorunies
---
Thanks bud, I‚Äôll try and explore some areas more suited to my level at the moment, I appreciate the advice
---
Thanks for this location (Big Bend Tunnel) to add to my list.  I should also add, Belching Betty, and Top of the World Concourse.
---
Lots of Scorched  ..... NO legendaries.  C'mon.
---
This is very very likely the case.
---
And the legendary caps market will be huge for a while.
---
Aw dang, I'll have to check around that area then.
---
You‚Äôre a similar level to me so I‚Äôll ask you, do you run with power armour or do you not use it?, not really played around with it too much and I don‚Äôt want to waste my fusion cores as I‚Äôm not sure where to find a regular supply etc

yut still uses 1h and unarmed

It would make power plants useless then

---
I don‚Äôt need barbarian, ironclad, glow sight, ninja, action boy/girl and bloody mess, I‚Äôm so strong balanced in every way, that I‚Äôm very satified with my bloodied unarmed build.
---
Lone wanderer + nerd rage = action boy/girl without DR
---
Also I prefer less damage perks over damage resistence perks, (blocker, dodgy, serendipity vs barbarian, ironclad, evasive)
---
Use twisted muscles mutation too (together with talons), iron fist has only 1 perk card so twisted muscles compensate the other 2 perk cards.
---
Life giver is ideal for surving under the 20% HP more than you think.
---
Radicool adds more strength and carry weight and unyielding armor, bloodied weapons, incisor, nerd rage and adrenal reaction are indispensable for a bloodied build!
---
Good luck to you!
---
I use the Shishkebab because (aside from the Bumper Sword) it‚Äôs my favorite Fallout weapon. And historically it‚Äôs been an end game weapon that compares to a Super Sledge or Powerfist. 
---
As for u/Thalenia :
---
The base damage for almost every 1h weapon is so low that it doesn‚Äôt compare to 2h weapons, even if you take into consideration DPS. 
---
Unarmed weapons generally have **faster** Swing speed than 1h weapons and have significantly larger base damage, on top of the fact that they benefit from **both** talons and twisted muscles. 
---
And finally, swing speed + martial artist negates almost any differential in base swing speeds. It gets so low that all weapons basically swing the same speed.
---
I put \~750 hours at level \~230 into this game but finally called it quits about a month ago. It took Bethesda what felt like a month to fix the issue with the guy (well his wife actually) who lost everything in the Vault Raid. When I go back to the game now it really sinks in how poorly this game runs after I‚Äôve just played Destiny, Borderlands, Halo, MW3 (a game released what 10 years ago?), etc.
---
I think they half-assed this game and are trying to milk their customer base dry because either A. The game didn‚Äôt do as well in sells as anticipated B. To generate revenue for something else outside of 76. I think there are some good people in this company, but I think the company overall is a shell of what it used to be and I feel for the people hanging on to empty promises.
---
I pick up energy off of people and situations pretty well, and this game and Bethesda just give me bad vibes. I just didn‚Äôt want to be part of it anymore. I doubt anything I said was important. Feel free to use any of it in one of your videos. I‚Äôve seen a lot of your videos. 
---
.
---
Not sure why you would bulk acid in first place. It's valuable resource and should be kept in stash. And in stash, only aluminium and lead is taking less space as bulked.
---
As a kid we added one. 
---
Close only counts in Horseshoes, hand grenades and atomic bombs.
---
that was 25 years ago....
---
Yes, Travaro4 send a little message with the request so I know it's you, I get random requests. And you can join anytime that I'm on the game.
---
Kinda figured the thing that provides the laggy crash your game armor is also laggy, broken, and crashes everyone‚Äôs game.
---
if they made the enemies stronger youll come back and say "TheY MaDe eVeRy EneMy A BuLleT SpOnGe, ThIs IS bAd dEsIgN". You people are impossible to please and have no idea how to design a challenge. I cant believe OP thought his "OP bloody melee build" would be able to solo the raid just because his build can solo the SBQ. the vault raid is NOT meant to be solo'd and would be totally piss easy for 4 people if one person could solo it as a bloody build.
---
Or you know...... Hop servers....... People don't have the option to play by themselves, so they are trying to create as best atmosphere where they get to be by themselves. But there will always be people who will find some justification as to why they shouldn't be left alone.
---
&gt;ammo
---
I usually just buy every round of 5mm and 50cal I see because there's not enough other shit to spend my money on. Every 2-3 weeks I'l hit a drought and make a Lucky Hole run, but 90% of my ammo comes from vending machines.
---
&gt;stimpacks
---
I only use diluted since I'm never above 25% anyways, and since each stim turns into 4 or more with chemist and super duper I'm never in danger of running out. Almost every daily event rewards you with at least a couple stims, so more often than not I end up selling my excess.
---
&gt;fusion cores
---
If you aren't constantly running and/or using VATS, the cores last quite a while. As an example, it takes me ~18 minutes and 1 fusion core to run a silo. The sentry bot in stage 4 guarantees you a full one, so at the end of the silo I'm at the exact same number as I started with.
---
Also, events in the Mire and Bog have fairly good odds of rewarding you with one, and on the rare occasions where I'm running low I'll just go hit up the 5-6 PA spawns around Watoga and grab the partial cores to tide me over.
---
Sorry, I'm on PC. One of my vending machines is filled with all the ammo types I never use, and I make a point to check out all the vendors I come across. Sadly, shotguns are popular choices.
---
See??  I can be funny.
---
I love that you can't even use the word 'trade' in a title for this sub. One of the dumbest modding decisions I've ever seen!
---
Same.
---
&gt; Then I die fast for some reason.
---
They drastically increased poison damage across the board when they launched the vault raid. Every enemy with a poison attack became considerably more lethal.
---
I think it should show up in game if it shows up in inventory. But I guess that would be crazy üòÇ
---
It‚Äôs unarmed, no gladiator but iron fist and incisor is indispensable!
---
Out of 5-6 attempts, all have been miserable failures in my experience... Sheepsquatch is way too powerful...
---
Or you know.....don't claim workshops if you want to be left alone.
---
It's weight wasn't changed, so it never was heavier.
---
When you bulked acid, you got more acid than what you had, and more is always heavier.
---
Yes
---
You can, it‚Äôs just the automod isn‚Äôt very accurate and the mods don‚Äôt reapprove posts very quickly so I didn‚Äôt take a chance this time.
---
Ye super strong damage with rare windows to attack and little help is super stoopid
---
Are those actually aliens? Or was it a human that transformed into that?
---
I asked awhile back And someone claimed that the robot will stop collecting based on weight. So although you can get more scrap if you set it to junk, you have to constantly empty it. So I have it set to scrap.
---
im a meat hook build too. let me guess, you are proud that you can solo the SBQ and you thought you could solo the raid too? wrong. not gonna happen. stop being used to easymode, the raids are actually hard and generally require a team, especially since it was literally your first time ever.
---
can you imagine how badly designed the raid would have to be if ONE dude at low health could just wander in and solo the damn thing on his FIRST try? and youre mad that you failed? your massive ego isnt bethesdas fault, everyone who earned strangler armor has died in the vault many many many times before they learned to run it efficiently and quickly.
---
you said you "like the challenge" and yet you immediately gave up on your first death.
---
No more t-posing scorched!
---
Tbf that is a lot of games, just grind for better stuff
---
Yo you got lead? If you‚Äôre on Xbox I‚Äôll buy
---
We ain‚Äôt gettin that stretch goal bro.
---
There was a guy here who had a post about soloing it it. So it's still very doable. It's just difficult for guys like us.
---
I think people hoard acid because it's valuable (to use). 
---
Rub it with lead and steel and buff out comes ammo, which is significantly ligtherweight than the components.
---
My main char has little over 1000 acid and that's a really huge amount. I've never done lucky mine but I eventually intend to, as my main obviously uses excavator with nearly all weight reduction perks. Do it enough times and the acid is no more.
---
Only requires 2 people. 1 bloodied player and 1 full health player. Have full health player take all the pylons and they run away to hide, leave them downed for the full 30 seconds. Bloodied player (usually sneaking) targets the Imposter Legs with Concentrated Fire and an auto rifle. Should be able to melt it in 30-40 seconds
---
Diablo was pretty ground breaking with theirs.
---
Yep.  Have you gotten the quest that takes you up there yet?  When you hit morgantown, you should gt a notification to listen to the grafton mayor on your pipboy radio. That'll lead you to Grafton (which has a couple fun regular events), but then the mayor will give you another quest that will lead you all around TV and open up new quests. 
---
It's a pretty fun place to explore, keep your eye out for a space station :) Oh, and once you feel relatively bulked up, hit the penitentiary for loads of super-mutie killing fun/experience.
---
30k?
---
I'd prefer to "sell" them for ammo scrip at those ammo vending machines. Then we can use scrip to buy the ammo we want.
---
Having them two people be in the same lobby in an impossibly low chance be realistic and if their two friends then that's different I'm talking about randoms coming together to be strong rather than two exploiting sweats
---
I usually don't use it.
---
However, if I find a particularly interesting location with enemies that are higher level, I chuck on my raider power armor, grab my gatlin and give them what for.
---
It's a nice little treat for myself.
---
If you find yourself in need of supplies and you see me online HMU, happy to donate some weapons or ammo or whatever you need. I got crap coming out my arse and I'd happily part with some to help someone else.

I'd like to see part of the fast travel fee replenish the 1,400 cap daily limit, even if it was only a few caps.
---
The limit for caps is 30 thousand.
---
Well, I can't argue with that!
---
Thank you
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been through the area and gone to meet the mayor etc, I‚Äôve also just finished the quest given by the robot in the water park but there‚Äôs probably loads more to find up there so I‚Äôll go back and do some more exploring
---
"All of today" is still vague. What time zone? Is it just once we hit 12 am in our time zone our kills stop counting? I'm assuming that they mean your local time zone. Let's do this thing!
---
Very interesting I never thought of it that way. Thanks for the information
---
You're welcome.
---
The is fallout 76. Fallout 76 is online as oppose to other fallout games. Can u guess why that is? To get people "like us" to work together with realistic chances

We totally can do this! This method helps a lot:

https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dgf8do/mostly_lowlevel_friendly_scorched_killing_route/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link  
---
Especially the events Collision Course (low level) and Line in the sand (high level). Since I've been grinding the heck out of scorched kills, I've often been the only one at those events on a full server. Hit those events hard! (e:formatting)
---
Not really new, but yes they changed it to 30k. I think this happened a couple patches ago.
---
Thanks for the advice buddy, I‚Äôll be sure to add you once I get in from work for sure, I‚Äôm on night shifts so I‚Äôll just be reading about 76 and my build until im done lol
---
Pretty sure we will make it. Three platforms and we did it last time.
---
End of November
---
Where is the exploit there? It's called playing smart. Not exploiting. Difficult challenges require difficult solutions. But as Bloodied Players are a dime a dozen (and Meta), as are Power Armor users, getting 2 people to co-ordinage with one another shouldn't be in any way difficult
---
Some dev on discord claimed they were displayed for them to check and updated manually
---
It's fine.  If they nerf everything so there is no challenge the game will become a bore.  
---
We need more difficult content, not less.
---
It's a feature of the trading subreddit.
---
It's name can't be mentioned here directly, but you can find it for example looking through OPs profile.
---
Shotguns are also bugged in that they cause that obnoxious damage rubberbanding effect.  They should be a lot more powerful than they are, but the game apparently can't cope.
---
Do the armors‚Äô effects stack with perk cards? I tried a few pieces of junk weight reduction armors, only the first piece made a difference, the rest didn‚Äôt change my weight whatsoever.
---
The only thing that saves 1H is knives. They're the fast weapon in the game. A high damage prefix+SS on a combat knife and I would take that over any other 2H. The knife staggers enemies pretty easily too, means you'll often take no damage in melee while using one
---
I'm not following. Work with others and do it. If a guy can do it alone, you should most certainly be able to do it with friends. It sounds to me like your issue is just with difficult content. Personal opinion, we need more difficult content. Not making everything easy enough for the casual solo player.
---
Make a post on Reddit that you're looking for people to team up with instead of complaining. The ISS is an endgame boss, so either man up or team up GL.
---
It is my favorite Fallout game because of how lonely it is.
---
Well said, I am fed up with this donkey carrot B.S, as well as the game at this point. 
---
I have honestly putup with enough. Glitches are a huge understatement. Tried playing today, got killed at my camp by a griefer in the first 5 seconds of loading into the game, because they decided to cancel Servial mode, and the PVP balance seems out of whack, only got off one shot, and  killed  instantly by this other player. shortly thereafter game freezes. Logged back  in, tried do a nuke launch for flux, game crashes halfway through, reapet, get to the end of missions control countdown, launched nuke, and fast travel back to my camp, game crashes. Theses repeated glitches should have been resolved by this point. The game has been around for a year now?!
---
 Bethesda makes us jump through hoops to get shitty rewards, why not atom's for rewards, so we can pick what we want from the Atomic shop. Then you get these discounts from the previeaure shop for %50 off. Honestly how many legendary weapons and armor do you need. If you have played this game from the beginning. 
---
In addition I have spent more than enough money, and time in this game. And yet,  I am starting to feel like a god dam mutated donkey, with mutated carrot up my ass. I have also found myself loosing intrest over the last couple of weeks to a month. This game  just keeps getting more and more ridiculous. I think I am going to move on for awhile. I am at wittes end with every thing. Its 3 steps forward 10 steps, I  mean 100 steps backwards. 
---
I wish you, everyone the best.
---
I'm in the other side of this...  I think that the players going out of their way to avoid PvP are in the right and shouldn't have to go to those lengths just to enjoy a game.  They are forced to because Bethesda can't or won't fix PvP.  All they need are modifiers to make damage and defense the same for all players in Workshop battles.  Maybe then it would be fun.
---
How is it fun to essentially stalk other players who are just not interested in PvP?  How is it fun to basically instagib other players?  Where is the challenge or skill in that?  Personally, I think that is a bit sad...
---
I have yet to see any of the Griefers use a melee weapon.  Its always from a distance and with a legendary ranged weapon and a bloodied build.  Why is that?
---
As for workshops, it's not worth it to go to these lengths when you can just jump servers.
---
...horseshoes and Fat Man.
---
Not everyone has end game legendaries.
---
Yeah but I don‚Äôt really read patch notes and have never done trades that would set me to 25k and over (cause who wants to miss out on caps) so I just wondered about it for a while
---
Unfortunately I can't add because I play on PS4, but I appreciate your help, thanks
---
If you move camps or log off does the scrap collector robot stay behind? I've seen allot of scrap robots just chillin on the road or in the woods lol :)
---
I would Just server hop for the lead.
---
I concur, if you go in looking for legendaries, you will not see them.
---
If you go in for something else, you will see legendaries.
---
I never expect to see legendaries when I hit West Tek.  I dont go there for scrip, i go there for steel and plastic.  I usually get 2-3 legendaries per run.
---
If I plan on legendary farming, sometimes I will have to server jump 3 or 4 times to get 1.
---
If you're on PC, you're in luck.  You can do it for free.  If not, my condolences.
---
Get ammo smith and super duper perks when you're able.
---
https://fo76map.com/
---
Hide all the show only the lead resource.
---
Move your camp and build an extractor over the lead node.
---
I would love to watch the next and last time u participated in this event and see just how it played out because I guarantee it didn't work out like that. This is a community game
---
I normally buy 2 star weapons, but during the sales I buy 3 star weapons.
---
Do the Mistress of Mystery sidequest.
---
Pretty sure it's Bethesdas timezone. They don't use UTC for anything. 
---
So about 6-8 hours from this.
---
That's just not true. Try swinging a knife with swing speed compared to a sledge with swing speed. The speed difference is definitely noticeable. It's like six swings to two. I'll make a vid clip later to post
---
The main reason to use PA is the stabilized perk and for the strangler set bonus.  
---
Other than that, you can achieve higher dr/er with regular armor especially if you use perks and PA has nothing on solid legendary effects especially god tier 3\*.  
---
All that said if you think you need more DR/ER/RR than you get from PA, you are mistaken.
---
Stop whining lol
---
I think this event would benefit from a longer timer and perhaps a cheaper spawn cost.  ~1800 is pricey for the rewards. For first timers I think most true newbies don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre in for on this quest, making people not want to prep for it (spec/gear/stash check, and travel time + interruption of what you‚Äôre doing to miss half the fight).
---
Amusingly enough I‚Äôve had the opposite problem with this event.  Was trying to tick off the electrician badge requirement and am at 52/60 after 4 events.  The acquaintances I know are too geared up, and last time by the time I grabbed two pylons and found the ISS, she fell over dead so I didn‚Äôt even get a hit.
---
Ok yabadabado saying to man up is rich from someone playing 76
---
Shhhh, I like doing that event alone.
---
No one is stealing your flux. When you die after the event ends, the flux disappears. Been like that since like patch 10 or 11 I think. No ones taking it, the game just deletes it.
---
How did the last time u did the event go
---
All it takes is coordination, people have to be willing to conduit. If everybody is standing around not wanting to do it, then take it upon yourself to conduit all 3 until she‚Äôs dead. There is plenty of time on the clock to get it done if people just conduit.
---
By man up I meant look up a guide and improve your build. People (not me) solo ISS these days.
---
Lol I get it, I pooned him to death. It's been a long day..
---
Yeah, that actually makes more sense. Have a hard shut off, especially when it comes to non-US players. Either way, I'm east coast, time to get caffeinated and play till Midnight!
---
35 million and 2 weeks averages 29 kills per second.
---
?
---
Fixer plans go for 15k+, imposter sheepsquatch outfits go for 8k+
---
IMO this is the worst event added to the game. At release I've attempted it 20+ times, dying easily 100 times overall and never beat the event. You shouldn't need god gear to do this. The game encourages teaming up with randoms, yet the event makes it nearly impossible to do without a coordinated team.
---
First 5 times we didnt pass but twice today manged to win! Still didnt get a fixer plan tho and just got two shity 1* legendary one was armour and a one a weapon
---
Use fo76map.com to find a lead resource and set up camp there then harvest away. Grab Hemlock Holes workshop and set up all three acids extractors. With or without the ammosmith perk you will soon have more bullets than you know what to do with
---
I knew about that. They're nowhere near me when this happens, though. For one example, during the Mire's Primal Cuts event, I would be standing on the metal structure over the drum that starts the event, and as soon as the mirelurk queen spawned and started walking towards me, I died within moments. If they're dealing poison damage from that far away, that's just broken.
---
What? Are you saying that the game doesn't work? lol
---
I don‚Äôt think people necessarily know the bag is yours , and even if they did I don‚Äôt think they would relate your username back to the player carrying the team in a fight . I mean do you seriously pay attention to who‚Äôs shooting for how much damage at a SBQ fight , and futher more do you seriously pay attention to who‚Äôs died and who‚Äôs bag belongs to who?
---
Maybe you should just not have a stupid build and Bethesda should learn that hard doesn't equal bullet sponge
---
I was hanging out in my CAMP earlier, then a player blaring rap music fast-traveled in to see my wares. I just rolled my eyes and fast-traveled to the edge of the map until he left. And he didn't buy anything, either...
---
Maybe stop dying? Then you'll keep the flux. If you die before you can stash it, it's gone.
---
As someone who is colorblind this feature would be greatly appreciated
---
It's an endgame boss, and thus requires endgame legendaries.
---
Just so ur aware, theres a known bug that removes your flux if you die with it on you after queen event.
---
I try so hard to hop out straight after then come back, but it's super tough when every add-on is on ur 6 lol
---
I usually check reddit when ever a scene drags on too long with people having a monologue or whatever. I'm thinking "When can I get back to playing?" I like that in FO76 you can listen to holotapes as you're playing..
---
A guy killed me right after the event ended the other day, and he indeed took my stuff and left me salt.  I leave immediately now.
---
For lead, be on the look out for:
---
Toys
---
Barbells and weights (Hornwright Estate has a gym with a bunch)
---
Cans (especially can chimes, Camden Park is great for these)
---
Combination Wrenches
---
Also, the Breach and Clear Event will get you a decent amount of lead ore.
---
Once you have the Excavator Power Armor then you can start going to Lucky Hole Mine for lead ore. With the Excavator on you get 4x ore when you harvest it.
---
When you can grab the weights from the gyms, it's gold. But they're SO often picked over even after server hopping.
---
What weapon do you use?  One way to get a lot of ammo is to grab a decent melee and hit a lowbie area (like Morgantown airport). Kill a bunch of scorched, scrap their weapons for steel and grab their ammo. Robots drop lead scrap also.
---
The best area in the game for lead deposits is the Lucky Hole mine, but you may want to be a bit higher level before you attempt there.  But if you can equip some excavator armor and hit that place you'll never want for lead again.. acid maybe though :)
---
Last thought move your base to a location with a lead deposit and set up a collector. I have one like that for my ammo-heavy stealth commando, now I seem to lack steel more than lead.
---
You're exactly right
---
Mabye next time read patch notes
---
I guess I'm a 1%er as I play with a bunch of other people who coordinate with discord and help each other out with gear and whatnot.  
---
So yeah encryptid is a fun quest from my pov and we always complete it with little issue.  I'd love to see more events like this.
---
&gt;It has to be the last hit on her for the Queen to count I'm p sure
---
No, this is just broke, I've been in literally hundreds of SBQ events with multiple different FFR weapons, no joy
---
I miss that better sleeping ghouls
---
Respawn time is 22hrs for worlditems, you can cut that down by picking up 180 other worlditems.
---
Looking at your post and the amount of times u complain about games like NBA or no man's sky *stop whining* . Btw wann do Raid together I have mic and j because I complain hiht imposter dont mean I've shit gear. Multiple heavy tse
---
My bss1s  power fist eat that sheep "izi pizi"
---
Oh man, that‚Äôs nostalgic af.
---
the best acid extractor spot is in a pond just southeast of Pleasant Valley.
---
You cant miss the pond, its got a boat in it.  The acid extractor is in the middle of the pond, underwater, you can miss it if you do not know it is there.
---
Very few enemies in the area.
---
Great central location.
---
I have been there for 9 months, and probably will be for 9 more.
---
Two days later, I finally finished re-downloading the game. Those were some heady days.
---
Ironic. This seems to be the bloodied guys version of "stop killing me at a workshop and stealing my junk"... which is usually done by a bloodied build. And they typically reply something like... "it's a PvP zone, bruh. Get good. Or lose your stuff".
---
Cheers to all the bugs we've lost, jeers to all the bugs still with us.
---
Its the greatest camp spot in the game.
---
Change my mind.
---
To be honest such large number is an abstraction anyway.
---
Couldn‚Äôt people just be decent and not take others peoples shit?
---
Agree. They cant afford another botched launch. Wastelanders is like a second chance. A successful launch would be great for them and for us players. If they pull it off well it's like getting another new 76 which is wonderful.
---
I couldn't get on I was busy all weekend I'm sorry I don't think we would have gotten there just one person but I definitely would have done my fair share
---
I wonder when the beta will end. Here's hoping sometime in 2020!
---
You people put the gay in gamer
---
The event is quite easy use a vampiric weapon
---
Honestly, I don't know what I'm going to do. I cant enjoy many other games right now, it seems fo76 has almost ruined me. But it's exactly what I wanted in the end. Before I got into this game, I was playing anything trying to scratch that gaming itch but nothing really did. Beat alot of game pass games but nothing, just felt like I was forcing myself to play. Now, for the past 3-4 months, fo76 every day. Played the beta for MW.. still not fo76. I love/hate myself
---
You‚Äôre lying. I only mentioned glitches not content being too hard lol but nice try tho lol smh. And I‚Äôve already finished up the raids and got the gear and plans. If you have good gear then get it done and stop complaining. It‚Äôs END game content lol not supposed to be easy
---
Ever since like march there has been a bug where dying during and right after the fight makes your flux vanish. I don't even think bethesda has acknowledged it.
---
I'd say do in truth I'm casual idc
---
Brutally honest? I can do that.
---
The overall performance/polish of the game has improved, but not nearly enough given that one year has almost passed. Large updates have been dedicated to fixing things without the desired overall transformation many of us want to see. It's clear to me that FO76's problems in this regard aren't just a result of the game devs not having enough time to 'finish' the game before release, but rather a problem with talent and management. I strongly suspect that even if Bethesda had waited another year before launch, the game would still be notably sub-standard for a triple-A game in a major IP. I'm honestly not sure they'll ever truly fix this game because they'd probably have to fire a lot of people, rethink processes, change some of the creatives who are guiding the project, and convince cheapskate suits to give the game more funding.
---
The essential gameplay is still largely the same as launch-- explore, scavenge, kill, craft. I love that cycle, and while I think the 'dungeon' and 'raid' and event updates have been lackluster, there's one main reason this part of the game isn't doing so well, which I will address next.
---
The reward system in this game is basically garbage. It was OK at launch, you had plenty of plans to farm and things to find, plus there wasn't a lot on the Atom Shop and you got Atoms pretty fast. One year later and there's been virtually no interesting rewards added to the base game (the few added have been largely tied to limited time events like Fasnacht). This is because they want to add all of the cosmetics to their cash shop so they can milk more money from their playerbase, even though the game really doesn't deserve it given the many, many problems. I find this the most disgusting part of FO76. As you play the game more you're actually rewarded less, because your Atom gains will dry up (many achievements are insane like collect 7600 wood), there's no real incentive to start a new character (you have to relearn all your plans and you won't get any new, more accessible achievements), and there will be this big world with a lot of repeated, unnecessary things to find. It's a shame, and it seems like the long game here is all about gear with no real bosses or whatever to use that gear on.
---
Related, there is also no well-developed 'endgame' to speak of. You're basically playing launch state Diablo: mindlessly grind enemies hoping for extremely rare legendary gear drops. Except in this game you get much less loot, have much less enemy diversity, have far less build flexibility, and have less interesting combat in general. Scorchbeasts and their Queen are a ho-hum part of the game and don't do a good job as the primary evils that need to be slain, nor is killing them very rewarding. I personally had more fun taking out clusters of gangers in NV and FO4. Also part of this problem is that a lot of formerly terrifying enemies are trivialized in this game, which leads me to my next point.
---
For some very odd reason Bethesda has decided not to implement ANY difficulty features whatsoever. There are no base difficulty options, no sliders, no hardmodes. This means when you play FO76 you are playing the equivalent of FO4 on Medium, which is made even easier with other players around (as helpful bodies or additional vendors selling plentiful goods at often cheap prices).
---
Community is overall solid, and they've done a few things to promote that part of the game (vending hurts difficulty but is still awesome, and could be a critical part of the economy in a hardmode version of 76). However, I think Bethesda's many mistakes have polarized the community, and abuse of MTX in a non-F2P game has only made that worse. They've also really crapped away a lot of potential for roleplaying, largely because of the absurd lack of text chat, but also because of the many lame aspects of camp building. And on that note...
---
Final criticism, building could have been amazing in this game, but it's been held back in a big way by a series of annoying limitations Bethesda have imposed. Small size, low budget, no player adjacency, few assets compared to other games (even FO4), VERY much updated to get players buying Atom currency, and also fairly janky. Some of these limitations make a lot of sense given the online nature of the game and the performance issues 76 has, but that's still not a very good excuse given how many other online games don't have these kinds of restrictions. It really just feels like a low class and shallow experience right now, when it could be one of the biggest and best features of this game. Expanded farming, animal husbandry, fishing, pets, smaller servers that cater to larger camp budgets, instanced plots, player-driven roleplaying; there are many ideas to improve camps, yet Bethesda has seized on none of them. Camp building has really been one of the most underdeveloped parts of this game, with no suggestion this will get better with Wastelanders, which is sad because it's the perfect kind of update to be adding to camps.
---
So looking at this, what's the overall experience?
---
Fallout 76 is a big, varied, wonderful world in Appalachia-- it's haunting and beautiful and immersive and has decent gameplay foundations. That world is, however, largely wasted on a game that continues to frustrate with low QOL and low polish, sad little additions that want to be equal to other games' endgame content but are not, a reward scheme that flourishes only if you throw down real money or endure many, many hours of tedium grinding currency, an almost total lack of sustained endgame that's important to the world or to roleplaying, and a void of truly challenging content for the experienced player (be they level 1 or level 200).
---
With all respect to the people at Bethesda who really \*try\*, the game is flailing and after a pretty decent attempt to clean things up post-launch, has IMO been in a downward spiral for months.
---
That said, I still believe the strengths of the game are enough that it can both survive these problems \*and\* thrive. As I've already mentioned, Appalachia is amazing, and the core gameplay loop is still very satisfying for those who favour that kind of thing. The crafting and camp systems are a bit light, but with consistent updates they could both be amazing. And most people who understand modding know that it could fix just about every problem with this game and expand on it in highly customizable ways. But in the end, my greatest suspicion and worry is that Bethesda will not take the path to redemption with Fallout 76-- they will continue with the mediocre updates, they will continue to spin, they will continue to be seemingly unable to fix much of the jankiness, and worst of all, they will continue to choke the playerbase into spending atoms to get the reward updates that are so essential to continuous fun and progression in an online game. Even if they do allow modding with private servers, it's likely to be saddled with some kind of Creation Club type system intended to milk the playerbase even more.
---
On that note, I have played online games for almost 20 years, and this is possibly the biggest waste of massive potential that I've ever seen. I sincerely hope that someone, ANYONE at Bethesda realizes what's going wrong and turns this ship around. For the sake of the players, the devs who try, the future of the IP, and just because most everyone prefers the story of the underdog rising through hardship over the story of the underdog that was dragged out behind the shed and shot.
---
Feel free to use any of these thoughts in your video-- but only if that video isn't a smear job, but rather a balanced critical analysis. This may all sound like I have a lot of hate for Bethesda, but I don't, I'm just super cynical about their business practices and frustrated that they're wasting all this potential. So I'd rather not see another boring human quoting reddit to make an angst video for clicks. ;-)
---
I‚Äôm somewhere around level 150 and am still rocking Garb of Mysteries/Eye of Ra. All the sneaky perks, obvs. Got a few mutations: chameleon, bird bones, healing factor, marsupial, scaly skin, speed demon. I don‚Äôt use Voice of Set much (only saving for the kill 1000+ robots with pistol challenge), but always carry round Blade of Bastelet for melee (though I seem to be using a reduced weight Grognak Axe more). My main weapons are TSE lever/TS gauss and an E auto handmade.
---
When things may get nasty I have a few sets of PA, plus a full set of chameleon BoS combat armour and a mixed set of weightless. Though one benefit of the Garb is that it doesn‚Äôt need repairing... though it may mean getting a right kicking every so often. Swarms are not my friend.
---
WoW is also a Goliath in the MORPG space vs a game that has been around less than a year.  35 million kills shows a healthy player base IMO with room to grow as game continues to evolve.
---
As powerful as he seems to end game players it's easy. If you nerf this you take away one of the only (somewhat) challenges that take any effort. The windows arent rare either, just hop on some pylons.
---
Reread the post and see the words **almost**. 
---
1 weapon does not invalidate the entire argument. Especially when, as pointed out by another in this thread, the dps will only compare with a specific mod and a specific build (referencing stealth blade and sneak related perks). 
---
If only weapon out of over a dozen isn‚Äôt broken, that‚Äôs a pretty large indicator that every other weapon is broken.
---
I'm pretty sure it's more than just that btw. I was doing Monster Mash by myself about ten minutes after a Queen run. I died while waiting for a friend to come over for 2 3* ghouls. I go over to my bag, it's just some nuclear waste and wood scraps, no flux. Watoga is completely empty. I'd been all over the school in the mask, didn't see anyone or any of those 'Predator' shimmers. I thought it was funny more than anything and didn't get upset. I laughed thinking about someone zoning into the school, seeing the bag, and going "Oh fuck this I'm outta here" with the flux lol
---
The game is fundamentally flawed at a systems level. They wanted player interaction, but designed their entire incentive system around legendary gargbage, which completely destroy crafting as a usable endgame interaction system. 
---
Bethesda Houston also totally betrayed any sense of a dangerous Appalachia by filling it with bullet spounge enemies and removing almost all PVP interaction.  
---
Additionally the atomic shop has been filled with junk that very much derails the Fallout aesthetic and really detracts from the one thing they have going for them, which is a strong environmental design.   
---
I don't think that anyone involved in the decision making process for this game should be allowed to continue working on it. I think they need to be removed, and I think they need to also remove all of their community manager people who have been totally ineffective at their job.   
---
Those are my opinions. This game has potential, but it needs people in charge that actually really care for the franchise.
---
Did one last night and had no issue killing the ISS.
---
The imposters sheepsquach head looks great with the horns and that whole trapper hunter vibe, thats how i roll with one of my characters
---
Yeah until you store it, if you die at any time the flux will go poof. Storing it, and then placing it back on you I believes fixes this "bug" but no guarantee.
---
We're saying the same thing just with different tones. 35 mil is a good number for a healthy game. Should have had plenty of opportunities in the three weeks. In fact we'll probably make it today no problem. But it is concerning about the numbers
---
Glad someone brought this up.
---
I feel like this number isn't hard to reach just because scorched are so god damn numerous. I probably kill a 100 each session just playing normally. Groups of scorched are a common mob in many areas.
---
Two things to note: 
---
1. If you die before stashing you‚Äôre flux after the SBQ, it disappears. It‚Äôs a known bug, not theft. 
---
2. Your build turning the fight into a 5 minute experience isn‚Äôt as beneficial as you think. First, it reduces the chance that players who are still optimizing their builds‚Äînot ‚ÄúGarbage guns‚Äù‚Äîwill have time to do enough damage to get loot or XP from the Queen. It also reduces the time adds spawn from potentially 20+ minutes to 5 minutes or even less. That reduces time for XP farming and the chances of additional legendary spawns. 
---
I‚Äôm not saying you shouldn‚Äôt run your build or kill her quickly, just that you should probably not assume you‚Äôre doing everyone a favor by doing so.
---
Happy to help! I'm a bit of a rare item collector, too, so I'm glad you asked.  You got pretty lucky, I blew over 2,000 candy and still didn't get a triangle! How's it look on display?
---
Yeah. 
---
It was night in europe and I spent all that time undeleting my game over and over, and trying to make the launcher notice I already have downloaded the damn thing. And hoping Bethesda would release a fix, which they of course never did.
---
Then next 3 days redownloading it.
---
I have one challenge that is to do events, and it says I've only done 4. But I'm 100% sure I've done the monster mash and all because I have the achievement(plus the other ones I don't remember the names too. Most the list.
---
If people want to be left alone claiming a workshop is the absolute worst way of going about.
---
Plus remember, the reward is 50% off purveyor, which in my experience is crap and only gave me one item I use.
---
Cognitive dissonance won't help you lol. You're saying you don't care **in a Reddit rant you just posted**?
---
What platform are you on? I'll be your first teammate.
---
It usually goes great, I have 20 fedoras to prove it lol.
---
You obviously didnt watch the full video. Some of ps4s best pvpers are in the video and I also got some sweet free aim kills! Keep hating though &lt;3
---
I dont care
---
Yes an end-game boss, with a simple quest that a player at level 20 will likely run across, and complete and get absolutely destroyed at the following event. Why not just accept the criticism, and have Bethesda fix the problem?
---
Bffr and BE
---
Sack hoodie no straps no hoses
---
You're kidding? You've actually asking for a participation trophy?
---
I'm perfectly fine with missing the target if we don't get it &amp; have an opportunity to try for it again later. Only fair.
---
ohhh thats interesting. i mostly use my unstoppable monster so im never short on ammo. my other main is a flechette harpoon :-P
---
but i might start selling acid if people are looking for that. thanks a lot!
---
So your saying u can 1 man it
---
Yeah, level 1. Seen one too and it was hilarious, I think it dropped some nice 3* laser too.
---
Will you buy from a supplier
---
I've never been able to see an image for the Communist Salute emoji in the shop even though I own it. Doesn't show up in my quick wheel, either.
---
Trillcosby_AE, rosaxcookies707, reptha6ix, Ludo are among the top PvPers on ps4. But if you say so.
---
Of course, any massively Multiplayer game is this way. But in those games, they introduce new gear and tough enemies/raids with exclusive, powerful loot. The meta changes, nullifying old maxed builds to give the player something else to strive for. 
---
A personal example is star trek online. I worked hard, grinded for hours, to get an amazing endgame build pushing 10,000dps. Not the highest, but extremely high. That was a few years ago. I come in now, and I'm woefully underpowered these days. There's a new max.
---
You don't get that with Fallout 76. The endgame meta never changes.
---
Wait... what... I am missing something here... please fill me in. Lol I am level 160 and never knew this
---
No, But I only get everything by Traveling across the map on multiple servers along with The Server hopping method for more Items
---
Just out of interest is it Chameleon or Weightless? BoS combat armour? Chameleon being the one that cloaks when hit. I've been searching for Weightless for my sniper build.
---
Nailed it, friend.
---
I just sell all ammo I don't use in my vending machine. Always for a cap per bullet. There's always someone who needs it and keeps me rolling in caps despite my reckless spending.
---
Indeed you dont!
---
I totally feel you on this. I tried and tried to scratch a gaming itch that hadn‚Äôt been satisfied since probably Skyrim, and before that, I have no idea what I did. I have almost 500 hours in 76, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve done that since WoW days.
---
Ye what I'm trying to say is that it's a PUBLIC event PUBLIC randomers are gonna join with no communication. If yours prepped its easy
---
Never thought of that that's a nice method
---
People finish the main quest at level 30-35, so should SBQ be nerfed too? C'mon man, stop blaming the game and start blaming your build/gear. Improve it, and try again later.
---
This sums up my point exactly, thank you. You're forced to use weapons only 5% of the community has access to.
---
Cool beans
---
This was a patch update a few months back. What should have happened is your frames will still be in your inventory/stash but your PA pieces will be separate. You should have been logged back in near a train station so you could access your stash and reassemble your PA suits. I had the same thing happen to me, took me ages to reassemble my suits correctly, lol.
---
Good you take way more damge in PA
---
Cool beans muchacho sounds like u need to go outside and socialise
---
That can't be true, I do leader of the pack several times a night without jumping servers.
---
I prefer the Mire, I don't know that there is an acid spot there though.
---
Atoms have been moot for me since they swapped to the crazy challenges.  Even dropping the base cost to 50% would be meaningless for me.
---
thank you!
---
You don't need God gear, just a good team.

To sell it to an in game vendor.

Says the guy begging for a nerf on Reddit üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I almost can't believe all what you described from logging in. That's like taking every bad experience I've had since launch and saying you had it during one sit down. Got killed by a griefer at your camp in 5 seconds? How is that even possible. I do agree however that this carrot is lame as hell. You'd get better no legendaries farming for them in the time.spent just killing schorched
---
Same i use it to keep the game running so my shops open longer! Wish they would add Bluetooth for the controllers on android
---
Nobody gives a shit what damage you do lol and nobody is stealing your flux, when is the last time you have ever seen a dead player drop flux
---
Ps4 please need other good people to coordinate with
---
Don't forget about the Big Bend Tunnel! There's a damn grip of em at both ends and all through.
---
I will be surprised if they don't reward it regardless.  It costs them literally nothing.
---
Agreed! TBH, Fallout 76 is the most broken game I‚Äôve ever experienced.
---
I hate how much the fedora drops when the imposter set is so rare
---
"Alright, it's Monday night. A 1.5M Scortched kill count left. I have no date. A two liter bottle of Shasta and my all Rush mix-tape... Let's rock."
---
Chill out homie
---
UWU
---
I think there's a time period where it will vanish. I've had flux from the previous queen fight when someone was doing a back to back silo run. I still had the flux after dying a good 20 minutes after the queen died because I afk'd near watoga and a robot got me. Still had the flux surprisingly enough.
---
Lol you made mine with this post, nothing but love.
---
Tuesday is when the shop refreshes not Monday + The square frames item is still there so it doesn‚Äôt make sense to end it early.

Unless you are also a Zetan (or whatever species the FWM is considered to be) eating the Flatwoods monster would not be cannibalism.

As far as I could tell it was alien all right. I expected better loot for such a rare enemy, but such it life

Welcome back!

Here‚Äôs a thread it‚Äôs links to bring you up to date:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning
---
I am saying it doesn‚Äôt seem concerning. Where are you getting actual user data from?
---
Can confirm 100% it's broke, solo'd the queen multiple times, did not get the challange reward.
---
You deleted post?üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
It‚Äôs a challenging event that requires some coordination with other players. Considering that it has a trigger that you purposefully buy from vendors, it‚Äôs intended that you have a coordinated team‚Äîwhich can be as small as two people. 
---
When it was first released everyone was doing it, so it was easy to see a large group doing it. With large numbers, it‚Äôs more likely that people will stumble their way into getting it right. Now, it‚Äôs not that way. 
---
Go with a friend or two, use your mic to coordinate. One person just needs to burn stimpaks to tank the pylons while everybody else dumps bullets into the thing. You don‚Äôt need legendary weapons to do it, you just need to keep hitting it fast. One player with an automatic rifle in stealth can melt it in a minute.
---
TIL, thanks
---
A drill and congratulations from Todd
---
Not that I‚Äôm surprised and I really love 76 but that‚Äôs so dumb. Why should we pay for a feature we had for free previously
---
PC, sorry.
---
The first day of the Beta I traveled north to the Ferris wheel on the map, and took my first workshop at the Tyler County Dirt Track before even building a camp! I loved the game from the start, and I still play as often as I can.
---
You have to be on the same wifi connection. So really only good when you're dropping dooks or spending time with your family. Still I have a friend who loves it lol
---
I meant if it was a free radiated mutation or anything like that. Is there any downside to having it?
---
When I first started playing 76 when it came out I was really disappointed to see that it wasn‚Äôt part of it.
---
Ye I got ripped apart and I realised I need right solid team cause I've been soloing most this time
---
you will kill peoples cows.
---
Good to know it's a bug. It happened to me and I was pretty upset thinking people stole my flux.
---
I remember that too. I'm curious about when they plan to do this, I don't  remember seeing anything about it on the roadmaps
---
Don‚Äôt forget about going to Berkeley Springs and Harpers Ferry only to have half the Scorched on the map lingering as goo piles. That‚Äôs fun.
---
üëçüèΩüëçüèΩüëçüèΩ
---
Non instanced NPC's would probably cause a meltdown.  I've had to hop servers in the past from folks going afk while holding a quest terminal.
---
I started playing in like July and I'm upset about it
---
It‚Äôs cool, how‚Äôs the player base in PC?
---
That's event end. Sale starts 10/17-10/21
---
Merci moisuer Francois help me with raid please
---
Ayup, mixing up a few bits in my head (I need to stick to reading one thread at a time :P )
---
But each day, and week, ends at some preordained time (I always have noon EST in my head, but since I'm at work I'm never around to check the actual time).  If it's ending today, it's ending at whatever time the 'day' is over, just like the week always changes over at that time on Tuesdays.
---
So if it ended Today, it was available until noon (or whenever), and the rest of the day is after it's over.
---
Scrap is best.
---
I sell 100% of my ammo. I have so much gunpowder I accidentally pick up that I either craft more popular ammo or drop it in front of my vendor machine if someone just wants it. If you're on PC I'll give you all my gunpowder. Drives me crazy seeing it in my stash lol
---
The Scorched Trials have now begun
---
This is true, I more mean for like, generic npcs from the factions wandering around. Or as random enemies in certain areas. 
---
Actual quest giving npcs, or just unique ones with dialog, should remain within those instanced zones.
---
Whew. Thanks much! Figured I would just have to start reading patch notes but this really had me freaked out. :)
---
I have two sets. One full set of chameleon (invisible, not cloaking when hit) Brotherhood of Steel combat armour (better damage/energy resistance) which yes is a bit OTT as I also have chameleon mutation. The other is a mixed set of weightless, which works with the chameleon mutation.
---
Thanks a ton! Wonderful to have all the links in one place like this.
---
Potential to have the mutation activated by PVPers at the moment, I believe. Really, when anyone asks me I don't recommend Electrically charged, unstable isotope, or plague walker for the same reason. Unless you're prepared to PVP all the time, then go for it! Just make sure to run Class Freak x3, along with starched genes x2.
---
Same as every other game, large, active and gonna be around longer than the player bases of consoles. Skyrim doesn't keep getting articles in the gaming press about the latest cool mods because of the console community.
---
Midnight EST most likely ?
---
Everyone else on the server thanks you for leaving half of your slain enemies as immortal goo piles that take hours to respawn. A perfect gun for a community challenge that‚Äôs down to the wire.
---
Oh that‚Äôs kind of cool. I was hoping to be able to play while at work lmao. Thanks for the heads up I will have to look into this
---
You get then when you were calling people slurs and they might call you honky once that is not the same experience, right?
---
Thanks for generalizing, mate. I for one prefer bullet sponges, but go ahead and lump me in with the people that don't like it. That's the problem with such a massive community like this one. A lot of them hate bullet sponges, and a lot of them hate timed challenges, and a lot of them think Todd Howard is the second coming, but don't act like they're "all the same" and gunna bitch about every single thing they do, because, yes, there will always be someone bitching, but they're not always gunna be the same crowd. If you wanna play the "you people" game, you people will sick Bethesda's dick so hard they could shit on a CD and give it to you as the next Fallout and you'd still praise it as a perfect work of art.
---
I agree with you thoughThe point here isn't that OP's stupid build is disabling him, the point is that the raid is timed, and Bethesda's poor excuse of a game has awfully slow loading times, and when a 4-man squad of high level "pros" have difficulty getting through it with good coordination and a solid plan, because of the shit load times, that's a problem. Trying to Solo it with a Bloody Melee build is a new level of stupid we haven't seen before, but even a 4-person team can barely get by with a few seconds left when they're lucky enough for the game to work in their favor. 
---
Yes, maybe OP big dumb, but his post brings up a good point, that making something harder simply by timing it is not making it harder, and that making something timed when your game loads slowly and makes you take more time to do some things is just shitty.
---
I need screws. I‚Äôll buy an Xbox if you sell me screws. Please, I need the screws.
---
Seriously, master hacker and we can't rig the voting machine?!
---
I live on Witte‚Äôs End too!
---
Yeah I could see that happening. Frankly in the scheme of FO enemies they're kind of lackluster anyways. Feral Ghouls with guns and an appearance change. Meh.
---
Shielded Underarmor plans?
---
In a game where people will remove themselves from an even to turn for the friendly firs so they can initiate pvp with a person (and their team)? Nah. I wouldn't hold my breath for change.
---
Just happened last night, low level friend playing, has been around a while just not a lot of time in game. By this point no one's thought about the "passive on" discussion with him, and since it's defaulted to be off upon character creation, it was bound to happen.
---
Bethesda recently released a post saying they've solved this issue.
---
I'm level 105 now.
---
To me, the only game that I'd rather play right now, if I could, would be Ark.  But their official servers and a lot of the private servers are such an overcrowded mess and I'd just be lonely exploring such a huge world in Singleplayer without the occasional base to admire.
---
XCOM 2 did pretty well with it as well.
---
Both used a similar strategy of combining premade blocks with randomly select parcels.  Neither was a fully 3D game though.
---
Bloodborne was fully 3D and managed to get Chalice dungeons working...not entirely sure they were what you could call great but they managed it.
---
Bethesda might get it working but I doubt you would find anything particularly compelling in there (terminal entries, environmental storytelling, interesting pieces of lore, etc.) other than basic mobs/loot.
---
What is this? I‚Äôve only just started playing again since release
---
Well done.  üëçüëçüëç
---
Since I dont need any weapons, it will all be spent on armor, looking for that last elusive 3\* unyeilding powered leather right arm.
---
If you want to know why leather, because Im making a stealth build, and leather is quieter than combat.
---
That basically catches you up.
---
EvErYthINg ShOUlD Be EasY To Do AnD GeT!
---
Congrats! There‚Äôs no better feeling than cranking those settings to Ultra with a new PCs arrival.
---
I expect that it will be an 80gb update. After 2 days of downloading , I expect it to crash my ps4 every hour like clockwork.
---
Server is down for me. Anyone else?
---
I haven't done that event in a while but it used to trigger when I showed up at Fort Defiance.
---
Should SBQ get nerfed? No. Should quests give more exp and decent meta legendary's  so you can help out in the silo's and queen fight? Absolutely.
---
You're right here though, I know I completed the main quest at 35 and was forced to have a level 200+ carry me through the silo, because I couldn't kill a single robot on my own.
---
In my opinion if you have a partially modded weapon (the best your character can do with the mods they've learned at the time), and a good set of perks for that weapon then that should be good enough to carry you through most places. But without a god legendary, or possibly heavy weapons (Never messed with them) you don't stand a chance. This wouldn't be a problem if the main quests give you the gear to continue the game.
---
Would it really hurt to give you a full set of 1* leather armor with less robot damage before the silo's or give you a decent weapon Ranged &amp; Melee that deals extra damage to scorched to fight all those scorched, and downed scorchbeast in that one cave?
---
Thanks, very excited about all of this!
---
From the looks of it, they were on your team
---
Alright psn: nwa_terence
---
I am surprised that I've come back to WS for legendary farming too in the last few weeks. Thing I hate there? Level 42 legendary's :(
---
How about Bethesda releases a black powder rifle with the chance to give someone a disease?
---
Hahahahahahaahahha your so funny ahhahahaa
---
It will hold more of scrap, and will take a long time to fill up. If it's set to junk it will get to ten pounds quickly and there will only be like 5 things.
---
I suggest scrap.
---
Bethesda are visionaries...they aim for the moon but forget to put their pants on first...
---
Actually I felt that indeed this game is barren and Isolated. Since there are no interactions between NPC's I don't feel motivated to leave Flatwoods.
---
And even now at level 35 I found the Vault of Vault 54, but died 5 times trying to get to the Legendary Item vendor.
---
I don't like how alone this wasteland is, and since I am a merchant I am always over encumbered with Items.
---
What level r u
---
Same no queen kill here and I lost count of how many times she went down. Maybe you have to be the one who shot the killing blow.
---
Well the wasteland IS ours for the taking
---
I don‚Äôt have one currently, I‚Äôm sorry
---
 I already have other people that need help but just make a post asking for teams. Still people looking
---
Watch the full video before commenting man. They might have been on my team for parts but I also pvpd against them as well.
---
I read something on here not too long ago that it's a combination of hours approximately 20 and clicks, how many item containers you click on. Approximately 60 to 120 should cause a reset.
---
Cool
---
I have plague walker and have pacifist on at all times. I don't believe it has ever initiated pvp for me, but it might in workshops or something that I am unaware of.
---
There is a small chance that mutation kills the traveling responder vendor bot that sells rare clothing. He died very quickly while I was in the trade interface with him, when I was suffering rad worms because well that is always. Also there is the possibility that it could cause problems with NPCs in wastelanders so I probably wouldn't add it on purpose right now.
---
even if we don't hit 35 mil i'm sure they'll just give it to us. We got really close and we're just gonna get even closer today
---
No power armor bloodied vats crit sneak gunfu lever. Stash my junk before joining. Stay away especially directly under her. Stable flux is not all that rare these days.
---
In fact, stable flux is a cheap petty reward. No, thank you.
---
***Maybe stable flux belongs in AID instead of JUNK*.**
---
lmfao
---
If you‚Äôre on pc I can gather up a few frames to help you whittle down that weight so you can get moving again
---
You deleted the post lol
---
How many scrip do you turn in, and how often? Random chance is a game that rewards persistence. She‚Äôs traded me lots of great items, but I take gear farming pretty seriously.
---
BUT MOOOOOMMMMMM!!!!!

---
Lmfao this comment actually killed me
---
This...  Nuke message pops up, I get to a workbench to scrap and store, then swap cards, the Nuke lands, finally ready to fast travel and the message pops up that the rein of terror has come to an end, less than 5 minutes after the Nuke landing.  
---
So, no, you're not doing anyone any favours by using your max build to "save bullets", all you're doing is reducing the opportunity for others to join in and gain XP.
---
It's like a player at a Whitesprings Nuke event one-shotting everything...
---
Dont get me wrong, it's cool and all that you can do that much damage.  But I respect players who have powerful builds and weapons but who know when to tone the weapons or build down much more than those who just destroy everything. 
---
For example, I use my shotgun at Whitesprings to cripple glowing ghouls so that others can get hits on them and share in the XP.  It takes a lot more resources but it also makes it more of a challenge.  
---
So maybe, next time, think about running a lesser build and only switching to max build if the timer is running out...
---
Ten years sound a little much.  I expect to see Starfield out by say...2021?  ES6 by say 2025 and FO5 (or whatever) by say 2029?
---
Oh... :(
---
Maybe.  But it doesn't change to topic post's stance.  It just changes the topic.
---
if you run instigating melee it will mess that up but other than that no
---
Oh come on. It's called Nuka-Cola. Ever hear of it?
---
It was fixed in the patch that put all of the mods in the enclave bunker.
---
It was the urban scout left arm.
---
It disappears when you die, Pumpkin seeds from the pumpkin house do this too.
---
In all seriousness this should be a legendary effect
---
I tried, wouldnt let me display the glove
---
save the cows.
---
we need ribeye steaks and milk.
---
I got rid of it for this very reason.
---
Yes anything Is available
---
My thought process is that we've been clearing Appalachia of scorchbeasts and scorched to make way for the arrival of our non playable brethren.
---
That means, in my hope, tomorrow or the 24th.
---
Dont forget killing peoples pet cows.
---
Aw dang, that sucks. All the cool stuff can't be displayed :,(
---
So is anyone sure if we still have time to try and reach the goal? If so i will literally take the next few hours serving hopping bolten greens and morgan town trainyard/airport to do my part i been saving all my scrip and already got my 1000 and id much rather get 20 weapons then 14 
---
P.S im sure the answer is in the comments some where but ive yet to a deffinate 100% confirmation
---
Not sure what you're talking about
---
The people saying caps have no value are often the same people who unknowingly sell godrolls for pennies. I got games best shotgun recently for 4k.
---
Rarely wear it but so happy I bought it.
---
Thanks for this, I'll stop wasting my fake genie wishes on getting the last queen hit
---
Yeah my theory is that they know exactly how many people killed already and just increased it slightly for the goals to make them easily achievable.
---
The post says [removed]
---
Plus, for me at Charisma 18 and level 3 of the barter perk, I can only get 0.248927038626% of value. My civil war hat has a value of 50 but the highest I have sold it for is 13 caps.
---
So bulk wise only a few are worth 1 cap per component. Which is why I sell all of the flower pots and such that are 1 cap per component or more.
---
If I remember correctly Cork bulk combines with less weight.
---
Other than what is no the patch notes and the sub wikki, nothing much else.
---
How does this work? Is this different from ps4 "second screen"?
---
Outer Worlds is only 11 days away now
---
I know, i was pissed...so now i try to find all the different coffe cups
---
Wtf. Doesn't say that on my screen. I still see it just fine?
---
Oh they know, they just don't think caps have value for some reason. Some people honestly feel they're doing good by letting god rolls go for cheap. Imo it's important to have caps for player Vending Machines, Assaultron keycards, and Serum recipes
---
Patch 11. I dont think you need to get new frames tho everything should be on your player or in your stash.

After walking into town and seeing 10,000 players with glowing eyes, glowing armor, glowing weapons, glowing pets and glowing pets for the pets, I couldn‚Äôt get back to the isolated, desolate hills of Appalachia fast enough.

It was like a window to a potential future, if BGS did everything the players ask for and turn the game into Magical Pony Happy USA Costume Land.

---
Gonna give you a list of things you missed. This is a copy paste message and may not be applicable to the questions asked. Reply and I'll go into detail on things if you want
---
March is when they actually started improving the game, from Nov-Feb it was only bug fixes and a boring world. Not listing things in any order, you missed:
---
two weeklong holiday events (minor addition)
---
alcohol crafting with daily quests (minor addition) 
---
a camera for taking quicker pictures (minor addition)
---
New faction and questline with backpack reward (large addition)
---
Sheepsquatch questline with unique weapon reward and side quests, two repeatable events (major addition)
---
Small dungeon with quest (small addition)
---
Large dungeon with repeatable event (large addition)
---
Player Vending Machines (small addition)
---
Nuclear Winter game mode with 51 other players in a battle Royale scenario with special cosmetic rewards (major addition)
---
Special vendor that gives random Legendaries in exchange for other Legendaries (small addition)
---
Vault Raid which gives guaranteed armor rewards with unique set bonuses (major addition)
---
Display cases for your camp which allows you to place items so visitors can view them (minor addition)
---
Basically I put either small, large, or major for what these updates added to the game. However, that's only in terms of content. For example I would say player vending and the legendary vendor were bigger adds than say Survival mode or the Arktos Pharma dungeon. Still a buggy game though, but that's what Bethesda is. Wastelanders will be like a chapter 2 with a supposedly different feel but I am cautious
---
i just put all my drugs/meds on display
---
psycho, mentats, stimpak etc
---
Fallout 1 and 2 had procedurally generated caverns and they were often awesome.
---
If the basic mobs were in rewarding amounts and you'd genuinly feel threatened each time when going in, this would be rewarding enough.
---
But lets say we want to make it awesone.
---
Give it 10% chance for special encounter per cave to make things more interesting, have it possibility of spawning "legendary chest", and make it spawn enough stuff. Cave with a pack of 20 deathclaws would be both extciting and something we already seen in previous Fallout games.
---
You changed the subject when you claimed there was no low level legendary farming in the forest. My comment kept in line with that thread. Beyond that there are several mob spawn locations that have a chance if spawning legendaries, and if course hoard events. But to your original post, yes there are a lack of scorched legendaries outside of hours events.
---
Doesnt show that on my screen so not sure what's up. The link is here though https://youtu.be/DGtV5W9Ixt0
---
Yeah, I made it to an event the other day, got no sbq loot, event completed and everything, no flux... Just a stupid 2\* arm piece. I hadn't died or anything, wtf is going on with this game lol
---
Right I can‚Äôt believe they bringing companions to this one....I never used them in any of the FO games they wouldn‚Äôt shut up and got me into trouble all the time.
---
You think 76 is a hot mess at times just wait until every Rando has a companion goooood grief.
---
It‚Äôs free bulk junk
---
Heard it's an on rails game, meaning no open-endedness.  Kinda need my RPGs to be sandboxes. That's why they flipped the format from Witcher 2 to 3, games like that seem to need a "go anywhere" format. I'll definitely be waiting for reviews. If Bethesda couldn't buy off people, Obsidian definitely can't
---
If someone  is really stealing your junk that really sucks, sorry to hear that.
---
But don't go around assuming people out there are happy when the queen dies in 5 minutes What's the point of joining if you don't have time do put in your share of damage or farming legendary ads?
---
I think everyone should play as they like, so you do you. But don't assume people give a damn about you "carrying" them to a less rewarding conclusion to the event.
---
Now, if someone was able to carry  everyone to a 4 minutes time on " tea time" that would really be great lol.
---
I'm sort of annoyed because the kill scorched quest was bugged and nothing but scorched and scorched beasts were counting towards the daily... Why should I believe the whole event isn't bugged.
---
I've got a level 40 BE combat rifle, a level 30 bloodied fire rate vats cost railway, and a level 40 BE wester revolver.
---
A level 100+ toon shouldn't be spawning enemies that drop low level gear without a way to upgrade them. It's nothing more than a mechanism to further dilute the legendary pool and make the game more grindy.
---
Lol yeah. I struggle with getting into ESO big time. But it helps scratch an MMO itch left behind by WoW. I loved my old shaman in that game and play a warden now as an attempt to recapture that lol. But I often find myself bailing on that game too, to hop back into Appalachia.
---
Some reason for some people is that these are dupes and they want steady income.
---
Other reason, as I believe in case of my shotgun, is that it wasnt TSE nor BE hence the owner thought its medicore.
---
Probably some are disabled from fallout 4, the charge card for instance
---
You just wondered about it for awhile rofl
---
PvP in general is very good up until the Tesla/Stealthboy cheesiness comes out. Workshops PvP is awesome tol
---
Losing your junk is a necessary evil of running a bloodied build in endgame group content. 
---
You go into the fight knowing you can be killed in a split second just from not paying attention to everything.
---
We know this as bloodied users.   
---
If I lose my junk, its my own fault for not being prepared for every scenario.   Dont blame someone else because you didnt have enough stims, or were not looking at the Mirelurk king chewing through everyone on the ground.
---
If only you could have 2.
---
Hehe. Thanks! But @Nate\_Dawg83 pointed out that my missing frames are in my stash, so I'm getting them back in place.
---
Now... if you could stop the server from crashing I would appreciate it...
---

Nah, that has nothing to do with monetizing the game so it's definitely not gonna happen.

I dont think he was trying to flex... but you make a clear point.
---
ITS BORING! Im level 1 hundred 20 something idk and its so boringgg! Base buildings fun tho. Can use my
---
&gt; without a way to upgrade them
---
This would be another way to fix things. Start treating all legendary items like they do with the MoM weapons, where you can upgrade them to a higher level using the base weapon and an assortment of materials.
---
I think they changed it so that you can't initiate PVP via mutations, but maybe that was just for electrically charged?
---
Hard does mean bullet sponge in a shooter game...   it always will.  How else would you increase the difficulty?
---
After all, the hard puzzle part is supposed to be launching the Nuke.  We're actually supposed to gather the nuke codes and decrypt them.   But most take the shortcut of looking up the codes, me included...
---
But I agree about bloodied builds...  they should have been nerfed long ago.   Instead Bethesda went after TSE shotguns...   go figure....
---
yeah i noticed the looking to the future pose being gone for a while now. i hope they fix it on the next patch, but i haven't submitted a ticket
---
After doing it for 5 hours I got a plan for the witches hat then I decided I should go kill more scorched to see if we can hit the target.
---
Yes!  Sure, Bethesda could have delayed the launch date in order to address some pretty obvious problems from the beginning, but I find most of the bugs more charming than annoying.  It's been fun watching the evolution of the game vs. the evolution of the fan-base, especially on /r/fo76.
---
Someone give this man an award!
---
Yes, thanks! I am currently trying to get them filled up again. Just need the Server to Keep Responding...
---
I almost tagged you so you could paste that lol
---
I assume your sneak attacking? You should stay hidden after the queen dies its not worth dying over some bs. Its like the game wants you to die when she dies.
---
The same sadly experience for me, very bugged weapon. There is a lot of broken weapons in game, not sure when all of them will be fixed. Maybe 2020 or even 2021
---
Ha!  I hear Wastelanders is Fallout 76 v.2.0
---
The flux automatically disappears when you die..
---
Lots of new quests and storylines have been added. 
---
Pioneer Scouts
---
Nukashine
---
Sheepsquatch ate my brother
---
Arktos Pharmacy
---
Burrows
---
Vault 94
---
Player Vending
---
Nuclear Winter (fortnite light)
---
They have also made a ton of QoL improvements for stability.  The game doesnt crash like it used to.  It still crashes sometimes, but very rarely.
---
Once you die, its gone. Nobody is stealing it.
---
I've got quite a few, I'm on xbox under the same name
---
I don't have 500 hours, but I'm probably around the 200 mark and I've loved every second. I didn't have to go that long to scratch my itch, I was heavily invested in CoD WW2 and put in over 1k hours, because I really enjoyed that one. I do remember the first game I put many hours on. Fallout 3. I remember borrowing it from a friend and never giving it back
---
Do you hve the camera?
---
Thanks, man that means a lot lol.  Feels a lot better than that "returning" wiki link. I had to take out the survival mode stuff :(
---
Same concept of finding a $5 dollar note on the ground
---
PC here
---
Thats the real issue. Its the farthest thing from being ‚Äújunk‚Äù
---
Photomode makes you stationary and you can move the camera around your character but you cannot leave the immediate character area so you can take pictures of yourself and surroundings.
---
The camera allows you to take pictures from first person just like you were firing a gun.  Its actually a useable camera that you can use in real time.
---
Wow a lot really has come about, I‚Äôm happy to see that. What‚Äôs the current stash limit? Also I‚Äôve been seeing pictures of people‚Äôs camps that having smaller items for display. Can we finally place junk that we find throughout the wasteland in our camps? Thanks for your quick reply
---
It was 35 million in 14 days, not a month. And we are going to complete it.
---
One it a camera you use in game...
---
The other is a screenshot mode you access from the menu. I get it from going to the map, and hitting ‚ÄúT‚Äù on PC.
---
Just you lol
---
Exclusively Nukashine, nothing more refreshing than randomly blacking out
---
I have send a friend request
---
I think it's a great game (far from perfect) and can and most likely will improve over the coming years. Especially since Bethesda has shown they're dedicated to continuous improvement even though it might not be fast enough for some of our likes (Anyone who played ESO knows how much a game can improve over time). I think the community is it's own biggest enemy. I think everyone needs to understand that it's not Fallout 5 and was never meant to be. It needs to be looked at as a story that takes place over time. It has chapters. It makes total sense there were no living NPC's when we first exit the vaults. Then we discover others. Then we travel to new areas. I personally love the idea of a games story that evolves over years rather than a couple hundred hours of gameplay. Sure, we might run into times where we feel like we've done it all and it's just repetition until the next update. But atleast there will be an update. Theres plenty of games where you just never play again after beating it in a few hours... this will never have to be that game.
---
A single letter? That's quitter talk. I have to scrap something to even get one letter lol
---
I didnt say it didnt? I know how it works. I only pointed out how it's funny a bloodied build is upset about dying and losing stuff.
---
No, it was only available on Vita and Xperia phones, now it's available on android.  It streams from your PS4 to your phone, and you have touch screen controllers
---
Thought it was three weeks
---
Right now I just wish that I would have spent the Atoms on something useful like the refrigerator.  How much more bone scrap, waste antiseptic and cloth do I really need?
---
Given that the franchise has always been single player experience, I‚Äôm not surprised. The core fan base likes to play solo, and those are probably the people that stuck with the game through difficult times. I‚Äôm sure new players have fallen in love, but this game would never have survived the first couple months without a strongly dedicated foundation of players.
---
During normal play, I have a small group of friends I like to hang with, but at least 75% of the time I‚Äôm still out in the woods by myself.  Aside from events, my experience with playing in a team is usually 2-4 people casually chatting while we‚Äôre all doing our own thing, with a legendary sighting causing us to all travel to it and get a hit in. It‚Äôs more of a legendary hunting team with walkie-talkies than your classic adventuring party.
---
Sometimes strangers make me laugh or are genuinely likable, but my interactions can typically be condensed down to the emote wheel. I could probably get away with only having wave, thumbs up, heart, gift and finger guns. A middle finger would be great, but finger guns are usually snarky enough.
---
The only reason i got rid of it!
---
Can you still destroy the work of other players? If so I might finally buy this. Is open world pvp popular?
---
Stash limit is 800 now.
---
And yes, they have given us camp display items that we can use to display stuff we find, Clothing, Weapons, Junk, Aid.  Basically, if you can put it in your stash, you can probably display it. 
---
Most things people display now are teddy bear collections, bobbleheads and nuka cola bottles.  Some people display weapons they arnt using, or fascnacht masks.   
---
We can now use wallpaper on the insides of walls to give a real wall look instead of the inside framework of the wall. (buyable in the Atom Store)
---
We can now purchase a collector bot from the atom store and a fridge as well.  The junk collector collects junk (with no need for a junk node) and the fridge can hold food items and prevent them from spoiling (acts as gws 2 i believe)
---
Just make shields that add defensive bonuses that can only be had with single hand weapons. Add various junk shield options like manhole cover and stop sign and you're golden.
---
Camera will also have a HUD notification when a structure or subject is in frame.
---
Funny that you respond to this post but not the 2 dozen others explaining the bug you're experiencing. People aren't taking your flux.
---
When the queen dies, pop a radaway and a sim to bring up your health to 40 - 50%.  Sometimes that post queen mob is overwhelming.  once you are away use some toxic goo to bring down you health to where you like.
---
Nailed it.
---
We're referred to as the Vault Residents. This is interesting though, I like it. It's not the Scorched Plague though. We have inoculated ourselves against that
---
Thanks, I didn't know about a few of those
---
Moo too.
---
‚ÄúBut i also run the risk of dying pretty easily and i get that‚Äù
---
Ok cool.  I'm gonna give it a try! Thx
---
then everyone will complain the award isnt good enough..
---
is my two front teeth ;)
---
Obsidian keeps warning people not to expect New Vegas in space and that it's a new original gamebut nobody listens. While I think it'll be a good game, I expect many people to hate it because they expected something like Fallout and won't get it.
---
The friends you made along the way are the reward.
---
*but I'm going to make this post whining about it anyway.
---
Lol i never thought to use toxic goo for rads
---
October 1-14... two weeks
---
And the ones still to be added
---
Purveyor Legendary sale this weekend.
---
I feel like PC beta happened later. I want to say after the 20th.
---
It was a Thursday afternoon, and only for like 3-4 hours. I remember leaving work early to play, and being worried on the drive home that my boss would realize that I‚Äôm capable of doing my full days work in under three hours if I try.
---
If you click on each item it will say the value at the bottom.
---
2 manned it and noticed the same thing.
---
Difference is I would clear out enemies before using objectives, there's 2 parts of the dungeon that require terminals and auto respawning enemies. Unless you got stuck at those parts you only have yourself to blame.
---
Bloodied melee and solo running everything whilst complaining is Reddits specialty it seems.
---
Tea time doesnt exactly have stellar rewards either.  The event is as tough as the rewards call for.
---
You get a recipie the first time you do it.  Then after that you get 6 teas and some random non legendary junk gear.
---
The rewards dont justify more than a few bugs and a rat or 2
---
Some of the best fun I have had in fallout recently was at Tea Time, not for the event, but interacting with the other bored dwellers that showed up for some tea.
---
Gotcha, that makes sense.
---
Low expectations don't so much avoid disappointment as front load it.
---
That having been said, my honest expectations are that Bethesda will fumble the ball yet again.  The content will be sparse and lackluster with the expected addition of numerous bugs, both minor and catastrophic.
---
It doesn't have to be that way though.  They've honestly done alright after the launch debacle.  A strong showing with Wastelanders on top of their decent showing with the battle royal mode, holidays and new vault dungeons could keep things going for a while.
---
If it was followed up with a full on expansion, a new wasteland to explore, new factions, new dungeons, etc. in the next six months or so even better.  They could even charge for the expansion, then another year or so of smaller monthly content patches and then another full sized paid expansion and so on.
---
It's roughly the model that World of Warcraft uses, though on a 24-30 month cycle instead of a yearly cycle as I'm suggesting here.  It's definitely worked for Blizzard as WoW is about to celebrate its 15th anniversary.
---
I don't think Bethesda has it in them but you never know.
---
My dude, it says it's worth 15 caps. I'm not selling a rare outfit for that price.
---
I don't think alienfister deserves downvotes for reminding us of another game. Think we all enjoy 76 and a little competition from a direct competitor is good for the game. But yeah I do agree with that last bit, people expected Fallout with 76 and haven't gotten it yet. They'll probably end up being like the people who stuck with 76. Disappointed, but still having fun and hopeful for the future
---
Oh no, dont get me wrong, reason I was out of powder is because some months ago I dropped like 1000 or so 
---
I totally get that gunpowder is easy to come by, and it sucks when its half your inventory , but Im just thinking for more uses for our ammo, and getting GP from scrapping bullets seem fair to me
---
Hah, and again this is just a very small suggestion to bethesda, but not one I want in the game asap
---
Ah darn, I'd recommend the mothman museum behind the counter, and top of whitespring lookout on the floor. There you will find some rarer cups.
---
Red is around 20-25k it trades.
---
Awesome thank you! I've been writing down all the prices in case I ever come across each color.
---
Nice, ill take a gander...thanks.
---
Rank 3 uses 4 points....
---
lol I don't keep up with dates, I just know if it's the weekend or not but I appreciate the reminder. So is that fourteen or thirteen days? Does fourteen days equal two weeks??
---
The card is four points when maxed
---
(For normal people)
---
You have a UI bug somewhere at a guess
---
That‚Äôs the value
---
Yeah camera is needed for all those possum badges and some atom reward checklist
---
Edit: photos mode will not count unless it‚Äôs stated
---
Pretty sure its just this Reddit community. 
---
You all run the same builds too and love the Mothman. I'm not a smart person by any means but to me, it sounds like everyone on this Reddit is as you describe.
---
But to be fair, Reddit and 4chan are a loners dream, so its no surprise you're all very alike.
---
14 days... 14 days equals 2 weeks
---
I concur.  According to the game, I've yet to discover Lewisburg and have yet to contract Sludge Lung, among others.  I even spent an afternoon contracting Sludge Lung in the ash heap 4 times and letting it run its course.  Still immune, I guess.
---
I mean the game is about a solo journey. It makes sense to me. Like many other survival games i like for that reason.
---
I downvoted because it was irrelevent to the question asked. Telling us another game is coming doesnt answer "What did i miss with 76".
---
Yeah I was dissapointed too, great set up for interesting lore but they gave her less personality than generic Protectrons
---
It's always been that way
---
 not a bug
---
Only time I've used a flamer is for possum challenge
---
I never see as many confused or angry face emotes as I do during tea time. A way to fix the event would be to spawn more mobs that drop useful stuff like ticks or bloodbugs for stimpacks and acid.
---
I grabbed mine in a park,  on a table, just east of vault 76.  Maybe in the area of the light house.
---
You have a point there, sir.
---
That's true, but with my incredible copy paste skills I don't think anybody *has* to answer, it really answers most anything outside of QoL changes, which tbh I don't think anybody could remember all of those
---
Oh my GOD THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING
---
Good point. I guess us melee mains can spec into heavy/shotgunner builds for public events. That'll give me something new to grind for.
---
&gt; Does anyone know the respawn time for junk like this?
---
It's complicated.
---
Each time someone enters a "chunk" of the map the system loads the map and all world items. If that person has come through that chunk (on any server) within the cooldown period (usually 20 hours) anything they picked up will not spawn. Until the server retires that chunk, all players entering that chunk will see the same for all non-instanced world items.
---
So when you are entering a frequently used chunk, like Flatwoods, the server does not always get a chance to reset those world items with the constant flow of vault dwellers.
---
But, it can be useful for farming an out of the way area. For instance, if you know where a bobblehead spawns you can have a friend jump servers until they find it *but not pick it up*. You join them and grab it, then they start server hopping again. Since they have not picked up the bobblehead in the cooldown period they can locate it on another server where you can join them and grab it again.
---
It's similar to the way people farm safes, as long as they don't take anything from inside the safe it will be re-rolled on their next server, but if they touch something it is locked in for their instance until the cooldown is over.
---
Lmbo
---
Only need 466 Salisbury steaks to reach the daily vendor cap limit
---
I didn't know that Fo1 and 2 had procedurally generated levels.  That's interesting.
---
Procedural levels seem to have been more a thing in isometric games.  The more I think about it though, as long as it is an enclosed space it should be possible to achieve in 3d so long as they keep 3d fully in mind when designing the "tiles."
---
I worry though that if they got it working they might be tempted to reduce the number of "hand crafted" dungeons and use the procedural ones as a cheap replacement.
---
I think the solitude and isolation perfectly mirrors the roleplaying aspect that it‚Äôs really just you and a few other Vault Dwellers trying to rebuild and make sense of what happened in the outside world. I‚Äôve honestly loved it so far without ever teaming up with anyone outside of event quests. 
---
I totally welcome NPC‚Äôs and think it will make the game even better, but I‚Äôm really glad it was out for a year in its current state so that when ‚Äúpeople‚Äù do start repopulating the area, it feels realistic.
---
Happy Indigenous Peoples' Day.
---
It'll be nice to have, even if I dont use flamers.
---
 You're thinking "Heart of the Swamp" event, I'm not talking about that.
---
Careful with texture settings on Ultra, though.  This game would like to use more than 8GB of VRAM with all settings on Ultra.  Lowering your textures to High may not look noticeably worse to you, but it might give you higher fps and get rid of the occasional stutter.
---
I wonder if the corpses of whatever large flying enemies will follow us around in the next Elder Scrolls game?
---
Definitely. On another post, we were talking about how weird it will be if, a few years from now, we can say we played when there wasn‚Äôt a single NPC in the world, and new players won‚Äôt understand that.
---
Yay?
---
For me its the reverse pretty much.
---
I snap pics all the time since i got the camera in my quick bar. 
---
I only use photomode for scene like when i finish a new base. lol
---
If we don't meet yall should just let us have it anyways
---
Wastelanders
---
IS ALL THAT‚ÄôS LEFT AFTER THE FIGHT
---
Where would you sell it for that price? Do  you just have to wait for the right person or do you advertise it somewhere online?
---
You can get excavator power armor at level 25.  You only NEED the arms in order to get the bonus lead mining, not the entire set. I would concentrate on that, and getting to the lucky hole mine. Tag acid, kill bugs (several types of bugs drop body parts that have acid).   
---
get  the scrapper perk and equip it before you scrap weapons and armor for more steel.    
---
In theory you should be able to do all of this...today.  The arms only take 6 titanium each, and you can get that in fairly short order hunting miners.
---
Mmmmm poon
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm looking forward to being a salty vet. ‚ÄúI was there at the beginnin‚Äô, when ain‚Äôt no one was around to comfort ya but the robots and the voices of the dead!‚Äù
---
The nuke zone is the event area so I don't think you'll get anywhere with that but I agree respawn time is painfully long most of the time.
---
 damn, bro.  Your e-peen is massive.
---
Pretty sure you can. Guy in another sub 3d printed a holster for his phone &amp; snaps onto the ps4 controller. Don't think he'd have bothered if it didn't work. 
---

---
I won't lie, I tried ark. And every time I spawned in I would get punched to death. I couldn't find anyone to help me out until I posted on Reddit but by that time I had made my transition into fo76 and I haven't looked back from there. It's also the only game that I've made a second character to play through on, even though the main reasoning was to have more script and more legendary perks when it comes out. About to work on a third character soon
---
A player truly going out of their way to avoid PvP keeps pacifist on, and does not claim workshops. I will agree that anything used to force PvP upon those players is flat out wrong.
---
Players going out of their way to avoid PvP should not be claiming workshops. There is no loose interpretation to the warning screen that pops up. If you don't want PvP, stay the hell away from workshops. If you want that workshop, accept that there is risk, put your big boy pants on and suck it up buttercup.
---
Again, I tip my hat to the method that I reference in this entire thread. It is clever, it is effective. However, I respond with "challenge accepted." 
---
We had PvP servers and people still went into them crying because they didn't want to partake in PvP. 
---
We have PvP events and people cry because they enter them and don't want to partake in PvP. That's right, people cry at Monster Mash. 
---
If we had PvP zones people would go into them crying because they don't want to partake in PvP.
---
Christ there's probably people in NW that cry when they get shot at. 
---
I've died to plenty of players using melee weapons. Pure PvP and griefers alike. They are out there. That they have not yet found you is something you should be happy about because there is little more frustrating than getting killed by a melee player that you allowed to get too close. 
---
I get why you question the fun in stalking a player. The simple fact that people are going to such great lengths is what makes it fun. Again, if they don't want it, don't take the damn workshop. That's all there is to it. There is no valid excuse why somebody should be able to take a workshop, accept a warning dialog that says DANGER WILL ROBINSON PVP WILL BE ENANLED, and expect not to encounter PvP. It is asinine. 
---
You've made a lot of assumptions coming into this. I don't care how other people contest workshops, I don't care what methods of asshattery they choose to use. I find it far more fun to contest from the border of the workshop and sit chameleon while they scramble trying to find me. Do you know why? Because you are right, it is not fun to walk up to somebody, hit contest and shoot them in the face before they know what's happening. That's how I play. I have no reason to expect anybody else to play that way, nor do I feel I have any right to cry when somebody does it different.
---
I've been playing this game since christmas, and I can easily say that server stability has increased dramatically. Currently, the game is really needing more things for the late game and unfortunately the vault raids didn't cut it due to their stability issues and the whole account cleansing that happened to a couple people. It was also increased by the new public events system, which dropped the number of events going on heavily. Other than that and bugs which are to be expected, the game is in an ok state.
---
I personally love playing it with friends, and am working on my second character with the help of some people I met over discord. I definitely found the biggest selling point the social aspect, where you can hang out with your friends ingame and do the quests. It was kinda hard for me in the beginning to find people to play with because no one I knew IRL, but I found some people on discord to play with.
---
The stories the quests tell are a bit underrated. If you didn't really pay attention to them you likely missed the whole story of what went down and it is actually really well made. Hell, if you paid at least a decent amount of attention during the BOS quests you would understand how the BOS being in appalachia isn't a retcon
---
I guess I'll sum it up by saying this game has a lot of potential, but it needs A) bug fixes B) endgame content
---
oh btw your content is great man! Keep on doing what you are doing, you have had my sub for a while
---
Collectible baseball: Cap'n Kids in the Whitespring will have it occasionally. Costs like 12 caps or something
---
Undamaged baseball mitt: on the porch of some house somewhere close to Becker Farm, I think. I can't remember exactly which house it is but I had one for sale for a while, but scrapped it because nobody bought it
---
i have about 65 in my stash (they‚Äôre weightless) i‚Äôm keeping just incase the one day they‚Äôll be like... ‚Äúohh now you can cash them in at vendors along with the pre-war money‚Äù
---
When was the last time you used your shotgun?  I just picked up a 3* furious explosive double barrel from the purveyer a couple days ago and it fuckin slays.  Maybe platform matters or something...im on PC
---
Wish they'd show it with four stars then. On the other hand, if mine's bugged, maybe they do show with four stars and mine only shows three because it's drunk on Nukashine.
---
Why does your rifle weigh 29lbs? What did you through on it a rocket launcher?
---
In that case, why not have four stars on the card instead of three?
---
My most recent character I made a point to just take ALL ammo I find, all of it. Sell the types that you aren't using in your vending machines for 1c /ea and use the money to buy the ammo you do use from other players vending machines... Also just loot everything, scrap it and bulk/sell any excess like fiberglass, concrete, rubber, antiseptic and shit like that. Ammosmith is good and you get it fairly early, Super Duper was later I think, around 50.
---
At 20 an hour, it'll only take you 23.3 hours!
---
Agreed
---
I primed it as well though
---
Man, same. Witcher titles never did it for me. I've tried so many times. The dialogue kills it for me. Too much.
---
Doesn't make sense to me to do that, but it wouldn't be the first time something in a Bethesda game made no sense to me. Should I expect the same from Inspirational when that's maxed out as well or is this Bethesda's way of punishing anyone who isn't constantly in a team when they play the game?
---
The sub that we can‚Äôt mention actually had a price guide for them. There‚Äôs a guide for farming Fort Defiance on YouTube too. The video is from WickadyChickady I think. I may have misspelled.
---
There's a place in Watoga that has one 3 out of 10 server hops.
---
Also, certain challenges specify taking Camera pictures of something while others call for Photomode. You can't get the challenge if you employ the wrong medium.
---
Really it just sounds like your angry, because people are trading good gear, saving/making caps and you have nothing or w/e reason.
---
Inoculated? I missed that. So then Vault-Tech? Hmm an experiment to see how a environment would change with an outside influnce that will ultimately vanish as fast as they came.
---
The Vault Residents uh... That is too much like The Vault Dweller, Plus you could give the same title to The Lone Wanderer and the Sole Survivor, not to mention Doc Mitchell.
---
I am Sticking to my Head-cannon, thanks thou.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Im not to sure about photomode but pictures you take with your camera in game show up on loading screens. Ive got some nice photos when waiting
---
i would love to support this but bethesda have never been good at randomly generated anything (but loot)
---
Huh?
---
See, I've been getting garbage world drops lately. Haven't had more than a 2 star and very few of those. Mostly 1\* garbage rolls.
---
Yes lol, eat your food or go to bed.
---
You... just... complained!
---
Force pick locks too
---
Same here and one of the many reasons why I love Fallout games.
---
You have the big dumb
---
And it‚Äôs still in beta
---
What? No foreplay
---
Brown is 2-3k, Pink is 10k, Blue 5k, Green 5k, Red and Forrest and 30k+ or trade only more so on the red side
---
Why would it show four stars when it is a 3\* ability? Star show how many perk points you have invested in it, cost shows how many ability points it takes up to equip, these are different things.
---
Awesome I'll check it out!
---
I put it in my vendor, if I were to sell it over 25,000 caps then probably on Twitter or possibly on here.
---
Hypocrisy thy name is Shun0363.
---
I wish each character could show how many scorched they killed during the event
---
Because it costs 3 perk point to max out, which is what the stars show. Stars are perk ranks, costs is the cost to equip it. The card has 2 different values.
---
30k per character and 150k total across all characters
---
 rejuvenated basically makes you immune to disease if you are well rested &amp; fed.
---
Nahhh
---
Thank you very much
---
I've got 1700 saved up so probably have 3 star armor and half 3 star weapons
---
The dumbest one is the alcohol card party boy i think it's called 1 rank but takes 3 charisma. I don't get it either.
---
Gratfon Steel, in the room closest to the workshop.
---
Watoga will spawn gutsy killteams led by a  legendary, if you destroy enough robots.
---
new gad will spawn a low level legendary.
---
They aren't, he's a griefer, and people are trying to avoid being griefed by assholes like him.
---
Isn't it odd how red is valued more when Forrest is rarer? I do think the red looks nice though.
---
I think they are the same rarity but red is for sure worth more
---
I'm hoping when Wastelanders comes out they'll expand the bounty mechanic. Give players bounties for committing crimes against NPCs, not just other players. And improve the rewards for hunting down bounties - like how the Lawbringer perk worked in Fallout 3, where you could collect fingers off your kills and turn them in for rewards. Do all that, and I think we'd see a lot more players with bounties on the map and more incentive to hunt them down.
---
It‚Äôd make more sense if the person who killed the most scorched got something
---
Huh I kept hearing that Forrest is rarer. Ah well, they both look cool.
---
go ahead and use my opinions
---
i was a day one player and the game was far from ready to be released. but i stuck with it. i viewed it as a survival game with an amazing map and a fallout theme. i still criticized the game not out of spite, but for it to improve. while some things improved, questionable design choices were made. even now, a year after release, the game lacks basic mmo features. i dont have a mic so i resort to emotes. but i still enjoy it when playing with others
---
the atom shop on the other hand is a joke. while you technically dont have to spend any real money on it, the limited time items urge the player to buy atoms because those items are typically of higher quality. its scummy from a marketing standpoint, but as long as bethesda is making money theyll continue to do this. with the fridge and other qol stuff, i really dont care about them. the only thing about that is they said the atom shop was purely cosmetic then release stuff that has a function.
---
so yeah, the game has improved since launch but its still far from an objectively good game.
---
I've gotten quite a few of the kill teams but not seen a legendary with them. I've gotten over 1000 in game and while I do occasionally find something new, I've spent a LOT of time in Watoga.
---
Don‚Äôt listen to this guy...he‚Äôs a crazy person...unhinged etc
---
An atom, just to fuck up the number.
---
There's the Grafton Mayor.
---
Once you get a fat man you can make the ammo just do the quest for the daisy cutter if you cant find one remove the mod from it and bash enemies to gain the other 2 for atomic fan
---
I mean Bethesda screwed over obsidian over a single point on the review score so I wouldn't put it past them.
---
I think it's **P**ublic **S**ervice **A**nnouncement**:**
---
Do they wanna be Mayor of Grafton too?
---
who the fuck is complaining
---
It was 2 am and had to get ready for work at 6. Good times!
---
Someone downvoted youü§£ü§£
---
because thats how much a Barrett M82A3 weighs
---
I was a first day B.E.T.A player and i remember how i went north of the vault and traveled around the north west end. I had made a friend and before i could friend him i crashed and i wasn't ever able to refund him. I hope he had a great time in appalachia :)
---
Understandable
---
I didn't even bother...the amount they wanted us to kill was ridiculous.
---
rank 1 is 2 points
---
Met them twice, 1st time on the road south of the penitentiary when my toon was about level 25, 2nd time just east of Wavy Willard's entrance when I was about level 65.
---
Haven't done the related quest yet, and never had a collar.
---
Fallout 76 is a masterwork of extracting maximum revenue from minimal effort. As a game it may be lacking, but as a platform for the sale of recycled or low-budget assets it is phenomenally successful. Bethesda wastes *no* time or budget trying to please long-time Fallout fans or attracting new players, and instead has cultivated a player base that tolerates anemic content updates and revolving door bug patching while still being willing to pay for tacky wallpapers and palate-swapped skins.  
---
Those who, after a year, are *still* expecting AAA production value and effort put into this title will continue to be disappointed after Wastelanders and other future content rolls out. The rest of us will be busy gleefully decorating our camps in periwinkle blue or clashing pastels.
---
If it costs three perk points to max out, why does it take four points to equip once it is maxed out?
---
Ever since they nerfed pumpkins months ago, unless you're cooking pies, there's no point. Just plant gourds and their simple soup is identical to pumpkins'.
---
IKR?  Maybe I shoulda mentioned that I was there w/ u?  Idk ü§™
---
anything u take with cam and photomode shows in loading
---
Eh some people just dont know how to internet
---
Meh things take as ling as they take, just with the 1 comment they made of private servers being sooner than we think, but then nothing about them again i dunno
---
Eventually the bugs will be old enough to vote, then there will be laws to protect their existence, then where will we be?
---
Makes no sense to me since none of the other perk cards I have work that way, but hey, "it's not a bug, it's a feature."
---
other than challenges, camera I can just take quick shots w.o going thru menus, but I think u actually have to be aiming at something (like player, npc, landmark ect).  There were times when I couldn't randomly aim and shoot.
---
That was a shit storm
---
Rank 2 is three points
---
I can‚Äôt find the video now, but they spawn once per server. I think she did 100 hours of server hopping and never got a red one, but she got a few of the other ones.
---
You keep saying "get gud" like a fork knife reject so what's your gamertag? Let's see who is "gud".
---
\&gt;  "Bethesda, why?!" 
---
Because they decided that the first level requires 2 points...
---
Glad I don't have any need for that card. Good to know I'm not the only one baffled by it, at least. Thought if I had four points in Charisma, I could keep travel agent equipped at all times and still be able to switch between Lone Wanderer and Inspirational depending on whether I'm in a party or not, but I guess I can't do that after all. I've been told perk card swapping becomes second nature after awhile, but I'm almost to level 100 and it's still a hassle for me.
---
Works on Apple as well tested it just the other day.  I normally just use my laptop to access my second PS4 with my miles but I thought I‚Äôd give it a look. Let me pair up a PS4 controller and allowed me to play.  So it does work.  Wish I knew a way to vpn or such into my home to use it but I guess I could remote into my laptop and do that but no controller input.
---
1 core in 18 minutes?  Wow......
---
Granted, as a melee build, I don‚Äôt use vats very often, but a 50% core usually lasts me 6+ hours...
---
I remember making myself available for the time limit we had each session. 
---
I think what was so rich about the experience back then was that we were all complete lost souls in the wasteland, and we essentially was experiencing it together, one at a time. Good times.
---
Still remember encrypted when you could drop bags. There was guys there, that's all they did was follow pylons around for bags. That's the yoink for dying, even though this is a bug, I still think you'd lose all flux from the bag thieves.
---
Wym, purveyor gave me some of my favorite items I have today like an explosive shotgun and 10mm SMG
---
There are others that work the same way. This isn't the only one.
---
Because the cost to max it out is 3 perk point, but the cost the equip it is 4. These are two different things. 
---
You realize this isn't the only card that works this way, right?
---
I never use it but looking forward to displaying it in my den with my other heavies.
---
^^
---
Meat hook?
---
Not sure where the plans are, but there's a Raider Power Armor, either Lvl 25 or lvl 45(from my observations) at Crevasse Dam in the trailer that is parked beside the building. The key is on the roof for the trailer.
---
I‚Äôve got 3K scrip, and it will all be spent on 2* Ranged.
---
It was a sad day because my game crashed every 5 minutes, took forever to leave the vault
---
I would say, even then, in spite of your post, there are still no PLACES in the Forest to go to farm legendaries.  As in no LOCATIONS ... only events ... and even then, those events spawn nothing in the 30 to 40 lv range.  Unless you really, really like doing only one thing that runs you all over the bleeding forest for a lv 10 one star wooden leg.
---
I'm looking forward to the addition of wastelanders, however I doubt they have to much planned with the bounty mechanics unfortunately. I just believe karma was that key factor with each different group. You had good karma for helping them, bad karma for hurting them. Definitely should place a bounty on players who attack NPCs. We should have better abilities to place a bounties. But I believe if your going to live a lifestyle tormenting other players you should always be marked as hostile not just wanted but no buffer to stop any players from killing them. It would make the trolls lifestyle more interesting if that's how they choose to play...
---
My GT is Urbanscub if you wanna play hit me up
---
Unless of course you want to completely avoid the possibility of PvP, in which case you should do absolutely none of the above.
---
power user perk allows for more shots per core
---
Watoga is high level ... and I haven't seen a legendary in Watoga Civic Center for months, and not a legendary scorched in the Emergency Services building since Dec of last year.  
---
3 out of 10?  I say hyperbole to an extreme, if not flat out fabrication.
---
neither, they are supposed to hold 500
---
If you were expecting the 1000 that used to happen when  you used power user, then that is why it seems different. 
---
You are missing one of your perk cards.
---
They barely have instanced zones working right, you want procedural generated caves now?  You might be exceeding their capabilities there.
---
Some cards have a base cost of 2 (e.g. Night Eyes)
---
But I‚Äôm not sure any start at a base of two, and can be leveled up
---
Would have to dig for that info and it‚Äôs too much effort, lol
---
Anywho! It does just sound like your card is busted. Do you use mods at all?
---
I‚Äôd consider that it could be an intended mechanic. Making players rightfully more distrust full of others and allowing a deeper level of risk to the game.
---
Are you certain they were procedurally generated?  Seems unlikely as there weren't that many and I don't recall them being any different through multiple playthroughs.
---
You're right. I only use a Tesla when it's used on me first. I came in with a handmade https://youtu.be/lNNetxvrRYk
---
Well MAYBE if Bethesda added TWO STEP which imo should be a legal requirement in stuff which handles payment transactions n sensitive stuff then this wouldnt have happened.
---
But whatever I suppose, congrats on nearly winning.

I got the tomahawk plan from tea time a couple weeks ago.
---
I can't wait, I have a whole character build based around flamers
---
Umm not really, hard never meant bullet sponge in FO3 or NV. It meant making sure you didn't get hit and/or having the right weapons, armor and perks to not insta die.
---
Oh no, how dare we "disappoint" you by not wanting to be fucked with by some griefer asshat.
---
Yup turning it up to Ultra is awesome. But I'll throw this out to try to help avoid some tears, there are still plenty of things in game that cause a top of the line PC to absolutely choke. Strangler armor is one of them.
---
I know what real moth powder is but I didn‚Äôt know why I specifically got it now after the fifth time I‚Äôve fought Mothman
---
I forgot how much I liked this event, if you're working on scrip and this event is on the map it's always worth a little forrest jog
---
The simple solution.......
---
Don‚Äôt participate in the Tea Time event.
---
You kill non hostile animals cows frogs etc it can make certain challenges almost
---
Impossible to do
---
Yeah, I go through them quick in the silo. I can one shot all the bots and turrets with my harpoon gun if I hit the weak spots, so I VATS almost everything. I also run full steam through the hallways and whatnot.
---
During Queen fights the power level hardly drops because I'm just standing their unloading 500 bullets at a time with a minigun and not using VATS.
---
It's simple, really.
---
If a game only consists of bugs...there are no more bugs.
---
The problem solves itself
---
Ahhh, why try to improve the game when you can just stop playing am I right?
---
Here's why I dislike your viewpoint.   
---
I've played multiple other online games, and just about every other game I've ever played provides something like a shared bank account to facilitate trade, and some method of trading with other players who aren't on your server.   
---
You want people to get banned for doing shit that is, functionally, industry standard, that bethesda should be supporting without having to resort to shitty workarounds like we need to now.   
---
So nah, fuck that shit, if you don't like people trading with the entire playerbase instead of the tiny list of people you find in game...just...don't trade?
---
I'm happy you found the workshop, but please find a better source of caps. You're wasting your time and the steak is more valuble eaten.
---
I upvoted you, guy.
---
I always just pick up everything I find and make trips to a vendor once I'm full. I also sell all of my ammo as I'm fully melee. I consistently stay over 3k easily. I'm only lvl 59 and theres a lot of other people who are better at gaining caps than me, but I dont do pvp ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Yeah, plans are the real reason to do events. This is actually a huge one. Hope you either learned it, gave it as a gift, or traded it for fat stacks of caps
---
And the top 30% of income earners pay \~95% of the taxes, so it's not so bad... wait, what are we talking about again?
---
Every time you raise a rank it raises the requirement by 1 special point. Lone wander level 1 starts at 2 points.
---
I like using it to complete a trade when i can get in and actually dedicate play time
---
Pink is about 10k, red is worth fat stacks of caps
---
I forget the name of the building, but south west, more south 
---
The one where you get the excavator pa.
---
Anyway climb the stairs to the monorail and climb the wood stairs to get on top of the bay.
---
Walk the monorail line from above till you reach a free Fatman that spawns there.
---
Found it beta and come back to take a picture every few months now.
---
Damn, and here I sold my pink for only 5k. Ah well.
---
I was just trying to get the daily in, and I died in terminals from radiation damage (while running with diluted rad-x and removing all rads before hand) twice. And said "fuck that shit".
---
Still not so bad
---
I don't go there everyday so I really don't expect to find one, but there's always a very slim chance!
---
I got a case of the cave crickets again...
---
...... Thats Hot.
---
Playing for an hour should generate atom points with multipliers dependant on what you do ingame. So people who play the most are rewarded for their time investment and players who play less still have access with the normal challenges.
---
That'd fix the expensive items issue since I'd happily grind out a few in game hours to get a new skin, might actually make me like the atom shop better when I'm not just window shopping
---
I mean, it pushed me to finally hit max caps so I'm not upset.
---
?? Paying 30k for something worth 15-25 seems dumb to me
---
&gt;You realize this isn't the only card that works this way, right?
---
So I'm hearing from others, but since it's the only card I've ever used that works this way, I think it's perfectly reasonable for me to be surprised by this mechanic.
---
No mods. I'm on XBox.
---
Like the heavy gun noise loop?
---
It's not a hyperbole I literally sat there and did 10 runs a day for a month. It came out to around 3 out of 10 times there was a legendary. 
---
If you're talking about probability and statistics, with the random  spawns within the game I don't know if it's necessarily provable especially since they adjust the legendary drop rate so often in this game without telling us. But for me  it was the best place  for legendaries  although I've gotten to a point at level 196 that I don't really  do the legendairy run anymore.
---
In regard to your ability to get a legendary to spawn, I don't go to any other buildings besides the Civic Center and I have plenty of luck. Obviously is not as fruitful as it used to be when watoga was full of legendaries but I still get them there.
---
So I'm hearing from others, but since this is the only card I've ever used that works this way, I thought it was a bug. Guess "it's not a bug, it's a feature" after all.
---
What‚Äôs with that power armor?
---
Really appreciate you taking the time for this, even if it is a copy paste message. I‚Äôm gonna give it another shot tonight. Thanks
---
In what way?
---
I've accidentally turned bloatfly glands into bulked acid so many times.
---
There is another one in one of the vats at West-Tek as well
---
OK, let me clarify, since the two word question apparently isn't clear enough. "Bethesda, why did you decide this was one of those cards where the first level requires 2 points?"
---
That‚Äôs definitely some welcome changes to camps and the stash limit. Seeing some of the camps people have been making recently is awesome.
---
I reinstalled the game yesterday and I went inside on the easiest mode to try and complete the daily challenges. Never doing that shit again.
---
No problem, man. They also reworked a few interiors, Morgantown and Charleston City Hall. Gave us some QoL changes, like all the vendors share a cap pool now and each of the factions have a regular vendor in the Whitesprings. They also added a few new locations, unmarked and marked
---
I didn't even think of that either! Thank goodness most of the people that I encounter have been really cool so far. But this is all good to know. 
---
What happens if you just leave the team ? Can you leave mid PvP?
---
Try using the remote play app through an Android emulator like Nox or Bluestacks and see if its possible that way.
---
I've been set off many times with my mutations and have not engaged on pvp because of it. Xbox1
---
Awww what do you play on ? It's more fun if you can talk over mic but I've teamed up and played with people even without a mic before and it can still be fun.
---
If you are using the Rejuvenated perk under Endurance it grants extra HP at high health.
---
When your food meter drops under a certain percentage, I think about 80%, then you get 'hurt' losing the bonus health.
---
You will still be at 100% health, but at a lower max value.
---
Radcooldude55YT
---
This is what infuriates me about the XP nerf. If I‚Äôm dumping a significant amount of ammo, at least give me the fucking XP that I should be due. The rewards don‚Äôt fucking cut it. I‚Äôd rather kills SBQ‚Äôs than fucking with this lag hell where failure is not even related to player performance.
---
Electrically charged doesn‚Äôt work if pacifist is on
---
What?
---
When you consider there is about a 1 in 100,000 chance of finding it the value goes up
---
Check the map on the train station, it should have a pin on her
---
I couldn't tell you
---
They should autocomplete the Kill the Scorchbeast Queen challenge as long as you completed Scorched earth successfully. Similar to how they did the Discover locations bug.
---
You did it for a month, 10 runs a day, but yet you can't remember the name of it until I told you.  What else spawns in there?  Do you know.
---
Wasn't this part of a duping glitch
---
its when he doesnt shower for like a month, and he just starts forming it all over his body.
---
Are you doing some sort of drug or something? I never said I didn't know where it was. And if it's a test it's on the very top floor on the right side of the Civic Center. Two of them.  One legendary one not.  Did I pass?
---
It's amazing how many bugs in that first session are still present today. Laziness or ineptitude?
---
Tang
---
I'm pretty sure when the cleanup Appalachia notes came out they said we could earn 2 meat weeks
---
I agree. I‚Äôm also betting it will be on its own server, separate from Adventure Mode, and be for lvl 50+.
---
Maybe i just don‚Äôt care about playing dressup?
---
They still need to fix the bugs with trading before adding new features that will break it further.
---
No, Not that I know of, just a bored player knowing where all the frames were and dropping them all over my camp for fun.
---
They might need to update it
---
I see the problem
---
Lone Wanderer does start at 2 base points and goes up from there
---
~~I swear that‚Äôs changed though and used to be upgraded four times and started at 1 point...~~ **Corrected below** ~~Could be confabulation there though ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è~~
---
Been awhile since I‚Äôve upgraded a perk card, lol
---
Because it's a really strong card. Especially at the low level you can get it at.
---
You can sort of create false walls by using the one stairs set that is flooring. I honestly haven't messed with it a lot, but the jist is that due to the way this stairs have way more clipping points than other items, you can create a wall in front of a wall with much less space between the two than is typically allowed.
---
$40 a gram
---
Can confirm. I was that player if it wasnt clear. You just need to know where a bunch of them are, pick them up, and then drop them off somewhere. It helps to have caps to burn - but at 200+ you're already riding the caps limit, so they dont really matter
---
You can also get rid of them just by dropping them..
---
Just snort it man, be cool
---
I‚Äôve been server hopping for a decent new 50 cal and sitting on 28,000 caps. Sheesh
---
I like that Bethesda's response is always HAX!. Can they prove someone hacked your account? They must log IP addresses.
---
I'm on PC, i haven't played my shot gun build since like shortly after the game came out?  I've just been afraid to try it again (id have to remake, deleted chars) because I hear its not great after the TSE nerfs
---
Just you mate, but you do you ;)
---
I keep a separate vendor for this. Also In this vendor I keep things that none would buy but I want my friends to access first at at deep discount or free. Like recipes and amo. After all my friends have passed on them I put them in the other vendors or scrap/leave at train stations. It's in a one block locked room incall the vault.
---
Xbox.
---
I always get a bit annoyed at first and then he says ‚Äúwho else would it be?‚Äù and I lighten up and chuckle
---
IRL Morgantown is closer to Pitt than Charleston and Harpers Ferry is way closer to DC than it is to Morgantown. I could see them easily expanding the game into both areas.
---
Shit, I didn‚Äôt even think of that. I‚Äôve gone through almost 100 levels without using Aquaboy so it‚Äôs not something that I consider using, in hindsight I definitely should‚Äôve though!
---
I'm excited that we're finally getting a classic styled Fallout rpg and dialogue system on modern platforms. Aside from that, we'll see how it goes.
---
Ammosmith, super duper perks help out a lot. I have those maxed out. 
---
The good junk loot spots were really good not long ago but they seem to be getting ransacked more and more lately. I used to go to the fire department and eastern pen for the weights but even after multiple hops they are still gone. Lucky hole mine is one of your best options for lead, that along with a good amount of acid
---
But it resets every 20 hours
---
Seriously, it‚Äôs not like we paid money for it.
---
Scrap for ballistic fiber
---
Nope. I couldn't stash it or drop it, because it's a quest item.
---
Have you even read the post or any of the other comments? IT WASN‚ÄôT ABOUT DIFFICULTY PAL. I don‚Äôt care if the raid was meant for 15 people, it should not be that laggy and buggy. I understand and respect the 4 player raid idea. But it was on novice dude, that‚Äôs and practice difficulty, I was trying to learn the raid before I went on standard or expert.
---
had a great late afternoon Nuke run at WS also.  Ran the Golf Club, the cottages and golf course.  More and bigger hoarder of Glowing ones than I've ever seen.  For some reason after one dose of Rad-X and Radway I seemed invulnerable to anything.  Made a second run after walking back to camp and invulnerability continued.  Was getting loads of HRF and Fluorescent Flux when game locked up and I had to quit the game.  sounds like it might have been your nuke.  BTW, I'm Lev.133.
---
Communication in this game is often unclear. 'follow us on Twitter' 'go to this website' 'read the fifty page patch notes'. Their refusal to use universal standard time is irritating too.
---
I once played on a double XP weekend and I had no idea what I'd eaten to give me double XP.
---
It would be if FarmVille had ghouls and guns.
---
I hate that. How hard is it for them to put times in the universal format? People are playing all around the world.
---
I guess you haven't seen that challenge to play the game for 7600 hours. It pays out a whopping 20 Atom Caps.
---
Came home late from work that night and my roommate had just fired it up. I wasn‚Äôt sure how I felt about an online Fallout prior to beta launch and wasn‚Äôt all to eager to jump into it. Watched my buddy play for about 30 min and fell in love with it as soon as we met our first real player and got some free goodies and popped some heart emotes. The bugs have been frustrating over the past year but the game has come along way since beta. Great community to be apart of
---
Yeah, I've been trying to decide if I want to relinquish my hoard for some serum buys, but I'm not really that dedicated of a trader and don't expect to grind for flux - especially when I could be doing far more useful things w/ my time like powerbombing random player's camps.
---
Neeed... coffeeee.....ü§íüòµ
---
I thought that was just the name of a VR game. What does it mean?
---
Most god tier rolls and Legacy's are being sold for real money now. $10-15 on Xbox I've seen in the post section. It's extremely tempting too, just to have one..
---
Just got home and signed in...its an instigating, not furious.  It slays like a mofo though
---
I've never heard it before now except as the title of a VR game.
---
If I couldn‚Äôt solo the easiest difficulty because the enemies or encounters were just to hard, fine fair enough. It wasn‚Äôt that though bud, it was lag and bugs. Which is again, inexcusable.
---
Negative.  Event was over.  He knew i got my flux.  He knew I was low hp.  He killed me and I got the message offering revenge.  He took my stuff, and left me his own bag of salt.  Ha ha, funny.
---
I killed 0. Your welcome
---
Awww too bad. I play in ps4
---
No clue, but since it's the only card I use that works that way, I thought it was bugged.
---
I picked this card on launch day and it's been a base cost of 2 pts at rank 1 with a maximum of 3 upgrades (4 total pt cost) . It never changed since.
---
All I'm seeing here is false memory, no offense though, this shit happens.
---
Just steal them from the power plant core generators. It‚Äôs worth the bounty for a few 100% cores
---
Yeah, I had no idea I was a cutthroat capitalist before I started playing this game. It didn't start until player vendors  were added but now I have 50 + AAE/IE/TSE/BE weapons and I'm running out of room.
---
Or just kill the inhabitants and own it üòõ
---
Few basic layout pieces with like 3 or 4 total possible extensions and random mob spawns. Sometimes two tribals, sometimes dozen deathclaws.
---
The one in the civic centre used to spawn on the arena floor ... bottom floor, but was more often a col. gutsy.  The one in the emergency services building spawned on the top floor, but was more often a ghoul or a supermutant.  Both would run for the door the second they awoke, and if you didn't kill them before they exited, they would be gone.  Neither have been legendary for months (since Bethesda nerfed the Watago Protectron Legendaries).
---
The building you are talking about is, in fact, the Municipal Center (the Mayors office) .... and same is true here.  No legendaries (not Scorched) since Watoga was castrated, turned into a ghost town, and made entirely irrelevant to the game.
---
10 mules (all have fixer plans) @1000 scrip each picking all 3* Ranged...should be fun! 20 picks each! 200 Weapons....!
---
There was a post a while back suggesting starting with medium and cranking everything for better graphics cards. Might give better performance than just going to ultra.
---
"It doesn't help that someone somewhere is dupong cleavers and mines." I don't know why but that made me lol. I can just picture someone in a far off corner of the map doing their dupe glitch in their little hut.
---
It's just a more rare drop of his. Like royal jelly from a honey beast.
---
To elaborate on Vic's point, some perk cards are just considered more powerful than others by the devs, hence the difference on perk pt costs at base level. Just because it's the first time you've witnessed/realized this doesn't make it a bug or fault in game design etc. 
---
Not all perk cards cost the same perk pts to equip, nor have the same maximum amount of upgrade levels, simple as that.
---
I still can‚Äôt finish the military base mission because of the A button lags (Xbox)
---
If all they cared about was that we played the game, they would give us a lone wanderer mode, do not disturb icon or fix the block for session function. I play about 25% as much as I want/used to because I‚Äôm often tired after work and want to play (not in a tram), but there are no solutions for us not seem like jerks to our friends that are online at the time. So, I‚Äôve been playing Days Gone when I want to be playing F76
---
Pick a day during the week where you can stay up really late. 
---
At like 2 or 3 am, go take monongah and set up the generator.
---
Spend an hour or 2 collecting cores.
---
Most servers are dead at that time of day, so far less chance of a PVPer to come gank your workshop.
---
Dont stay there, just come back every 20 minutes to pick up your 3 cores.  In a few hours you will have what you need for a few weeks.
---
They didn't bulk acid. They bought bulk acid. Then OP made ammo and it didn't use the bulked acid first it scrapped other items they needed for quests.
---
I love how not knowing everything there is to know about Fallout gets you an automatic downvote in this sub. Sure makes newcomers to the game feel real welcome. 
---
I get that it's a strong card, but it would be nice if they would then maybe broke the card down into four stars instead (while still being the same strength maxed out) so that people like myself who don't have other really strong cards they got at low levels aren't left thinking their perk card is busted.
---
Or just leave it unlocked so when an intruder kills you then you can just keep looting it because no one ever checks the extractors after they take it from someone else
---
Still have nightmares about the gods light in the middle of hills and the wendigo men
---
I dont really know. I guess i wasnt paying attention. I will if it happens again.
---
Where do you actually find pumpkin plans
---
Um. Are you on Xbox, good sir?
---
You can actually be on any WiFi even in another country
---
Don't think that works because I tried it my guy
---
It is even more true when it comes to weapons and armor pieces. Almost every single legacy weapon in the game is worth over 30k, every single explosive galting plasma is worth over 100k. But my good sir I would be more than glad to buy all your legendary items for their in game cap value
---
Thanks!
---
I haven't played in a while. What's this all about? I could definitely come on and kill a few hundred zeke with you lot. Set up some turrets and watch the slaughter.
---
Yes, now you can also connect controllers to your phone or iPad, and can turn your ps on from rest anywhere in the world if you have WiFi network with good speed and ping on both ends!
---
I know it doesn't make it a bug or a fault, but it should explain to others why it threw me, and yet people are apparently confused why I wasn't aware of this mechanic all along. I'm glad I got into Fallout long before FO76 and this subreddit existed, because there's times where if you don't know everything there is to know about the game on this subreddit, you get talked down to and/or downvoted and I can't imagine that makes newbies to the Fallout universe feel very welcome if this subreddit is their introduction to the fandom community.
---
Test it for yourself then. Once you die after completing scorched earth it disappears from the bag. Look at the rest of this thread... 
---
If people were taking the flux they would take everything. Ive done the queen probably 300+ times even if im by myself the flux is gone buddy.
---
going in solo as a bloody build then dying once and declaring the raid "broken" just shows that you have no clue. you dont respect the raid at all
---
I came across the tree top obstacle course and spent 1 of my two hours trying to make it to the end...
---
Still haven‚Äôt pulled it off...
---
Sorry ... your what? Got a link maybe please?
---
But PS remote is not good with latency and input delay. I wonder how google stadia would do in this regard.
---
I'm just about sure I have the last ever screenshot of the "beta" as they called it.
---
I wouldn't care so much about the rewards if the event was fun.  Fun events are better than shitty but rewarding events.
---
The max caps limit is 30 thousand caps.
---
If you run the nuke zones you can craft them with stable flux. Very expensive though. Also a lot of people sell full charge cores for 100 caps. Check people‚Äôs vending machines.
---
Some of us don‚Äôt support buggy messes that are borderline unplayable. Sorry
---
They were down about an hour ago for me. Then suddenly were fixed.
---
I‚Äôve seen it once at the white springs
---
It's weird. I was on, playing. Then I noticed server pop was getting low, so I was going to hop worlds. After I logged out, I could not log back in. Now I just get that "Vault-Tec is working on it" message.
---
You PS4?
---
I've actually seen them more in the fusion generator I come across in the more recent days.
---
Totally different concept, ps now was horrible when I tried it too, but that was on my PS3 when it first came out. I don't know if it's better now. I'm really curious about stadia also
