That‚Äôs legendary armor. Not the face that they‚Äôre lvl 200. Sentinel gear reduces incoming damage while standing still.

---
Would you mind me asking how you usually play survival? Are you actively hunting other players, or just getting jumped a lot? Do you use lots of consumables or keep them in your stash? I've found I actually get attacked less when I'm actively going after other players, though it does pay to be able to notice when a player has hit god-tier and become near unkillable. 
---
Are you joking??
---
Yeah I know thats why I have caps as well. I don‚Äôt want to not give someone enough but I don‚Äôt want to spend all caps either. I don‚Äôt have much else worth trading.
---
Oh okay that's kind of dumb.

If I'm there  I always drop something into that poor soul...
---
I‚Äôve been looking everywhere for those silo hatches.  I can‚Äôt seem to find them.
---
I was going to include that but I‚Äôve only seen it once fighting another Deathclaw and losing. Haven‚Äôt seen anyone trade with it.
---
The most imbalanced enemies for me are Mirelurk Hunters.  Those guys mess me up even at lvl 100,  I‚Äôm not sure what makes them so strong but I cheese it whenever I see them.
---
I went to a level 30+ area and had to fight it. It took minutes until it finally got defeated and only received 200 XP from it which isn't enough. There should be low levels for them and not always level 50.
---
If you search in Google there is also a colored map that shows where the vendors are. 
---
It‚Äôs the thought that counts. That‚Äôs like the only vendor I‚Äôve ever been curious of it‚Äôs goods. 
---
That‚Äôs what I figured. I haven‚Äôt heard anything from anyone about that vendor. Other than it was DOA

Same thing might happen later when you have to test intelligence and craft an item. Always brew at least 4 or 5. 
---
Yup. It blows up. You can get out of the way though. It‚Äôs like a car blowing up. 
---
Ok thank you, I don't know where I got it from but yeah, I thought 2* enemies drop items with 2 effects, 3* drop item with 3 and so on. Thanks for clearing that up!
---
Very nice! I like the multi-tiered design, looks like a real lakeside getaway.
---
Video? I would love to see this üòÅ
---
So does that mean there's no way to craft wooden armor? 
---
While I'm unsure if there are any plans on vendors, you can craft or purchase the weapons and then scrap them to learn the mods.   
---
There are several guns in the game where the above is the only way to obtain mods, so if there are no vendors selling the plans, there you go.
---
Yeah apparently was feeding myself false information, thanks :)

yeah, he"s hoarding it now, but it was all duped. He told me so.  I can drop stuff when I'm over encumbered without destroying it.  I collected 300 lbs of weapons  above  my carry weight yesterday and it let me drop it, I went to a vendor, sold off my excess, went back and picked it all up, but like I said, I'm no expert. Anyway, like I said, my post wasn't about good or bad, the situation just struck me as ironic.  He'll figure it out.

The mission is for the Enclave bunker under Whitesprings. The hotel is open.

I was on the cliff side and the two deathclaws were fighting, I thought 2 were attacking  Grahm since I saw his pack get killed but it wasn't them.

how good is it?

Thanks!

I can confirm since that update, I've loot a drill and syringer from legendary enemies.

Ah ok. Thanks man

I'm over the moon excited for the Wastelander update. I love summer but I can't wait for fall to get here so we can play it. It's been *years* since I've been this excited over a game.

You have to purchase the breathalyzer mod for the controller.
---
I only go after those that are red, they were wanted and camping vault 76; had nothing but 200 caps to lose so I decided to try out what I could do to them.
---
 10mm auto with fire dmg, nothing
---
.44 with 50% armor ignored, nothing
---
Shotgun to the face, nope
---
with some dodging and the like between the fights
---
I had a chance to test out all my weapons and they never really took dmg even if I shot them in mid air coming down like I was playing apex. 
---
Sure. I'd run with a bit of rads if I pvp'd, but I don't do that. That's a good clarification. Instigating is king for pve not PVP. 
---
I just wish it worked in my stash as well.
---
Or they could show you how many learn able mods there are when you scrap. Then you can see the total number of mods, both learnable and buyable, when you are in the modification menu. 
---
Scrap X? 5/6 mods known.

Nuked flora need other ingredients in order to produce stable flux. Having a nuked flora garden in fact won‚Äôt give you any flux since you still need other three components which are only available in nuked areas. 
---
You shouldn‚Äôt have to be bottlenecked into a certain build just to fight one type of enemy. I agree they need to be hard and scary. 
---
But right now they are just a annoying and BOS armor mods aren‚Äôt reward enough for the time and resource investment. 
---
Hi from across the country (Montreal here).
---
equip all your int booster equipment and take all your int boosting meds/foods when scrapping.
---
if you have marsupial, I'm fairly certain that class freak doesn't properly negate the int debuff when scrapping.
---
Assassins armor reduces Damage taken from players and sentinel is reduced damage while,standing still. You can get the same gear at lower level. It‚Äôs way too strong in my opinion. 
---
Does that unlock better mods?
---
for me the biggest problem is if your a melee set like me. And they almost never land it's almost better with it to run away.
---
and they do take so many bullets that sometimes you're like " okay well I had four hundred bullets before I started and now I have 2" 
---
And it's still not dead....
---
You can holster your weapon to make your dot yellow and your nickname yellow to, instead of red. I already used that in game, and have two new friends I met in survival.

Well, in Bethesda's own words, it's a beta.  Which means that part of the reason for allowing this is:
---
* It was the easiest way to get it up and running.
---
* It demonstrates the balancing issues in the wild, how others might attempt to counter them, and what tweaks may be necessary.
---
Besides, even if you had everyone start at Level 1, the imbalance would still be a problem in the future.
---
I‚Äôd estimate above 3k depending on the third effect maybe 6k or 7k
---
The guy above is crazy it‚Äôs not because higher levels don‚Äôt want to lower levels there almost every time I‚Äôve gone to White Springs and there‚Äôs someone under level 50 and I get any kind of a legendary it‚Äôs crap it‚Äôs level 20 or level 30 or 35 so yeah ... when someone under level 50 goes there and camps there in your level 150 or above it gets old.  I‚Äôm not saying a lower level shouldn‚Äôt be able to go there all I‚Äôm saying is the ones I‚Äôve run into camp out there and you can‚Äôt do anything about it
---
I know
---
 And since I haven't done any of the enclave stuff I cant access the top floor
---
I'm fairly certain the plan for crafting Plasma Gun is in the Armoury section of the Enclave Bunker, from there you can craft and scrap them until you get all the mods. I think the Laser Rifle plan might be with Vendor Bot Phoenix or at Watoga Station, probably will cost you ~1.5k caps with no perks/chems. Some individual mods can drop from enemies/spawn in locations but the plan/mod is random, only the location is set.
---
Hmm, they probably fell into that last category of player. I actually started keeping binoculars on me to watch people before I decide to attack for that reason. Right now there doesn't seem to be a good way to consistently take down the players that have stacked that many damage reduction modifiers. I have a ~200 end game bloody build like that, but it's still a crap shoot. At that point it all comes down to who finds the best hunting grounds.
---
I like our lord and saviour, but some versions need smited as a test of faith. 1300 damage dragon does fine.
---
Still, it would 'cheapen' the grind for it.
---
And Bethesda is notorious for not allowing anyway to circumvent the grind i.e. the recent merging of cap stashes and cap stash perks.
---
Again I'd be all for just allowing player farms to *look* like nuked flora with only the visual aspect.
---
That way you can make your garden looked nuked up while still retaining your produce.
---
Maybe you guys saw me, I was MajorWakanda

It would be nice to see some more Faction themed Decorations, Maybe flags for Each Faction to show who you are with?

The mounted heads would also be cool and could be rare plan drops from killing creatures. For example, killing a Deathclaw has a chance to drop a mounted Deathclaw head plan.

As far as I am aware, that is indeed the case. Your only choice is to find it in the world.

anecdotally, higher int improves crafted durability, and higher durability seems to improve learning mods when scrapping.

Yeah, I've gotten loads of weapon plans in safes - anything from a relatively cheap baton to an expensive gatling plasma. I always open them.

I know.  Here you are trying to enjoy the game, and I butt in with a firehose of negativity.  People like me are the worst.  Why can't I let people tell me why things I like are trash and that I am an asshole?
---
I was actually serious though.  Dozens of similar games out there...  honestly why do you play this one so much if you hate it, and why do you hate people who like it even more?  Plenty of others have said nope and moved on.  
---
So... why?
---
Haha that‚Äôs awesome!

I bet. Unfortunately my best gun is 101-dam double shotgun cuz I‚Äôm lower level.

&gt;Well shit, sometimes I just want to see a .44 do .44 dmg to someone and it seems the last time I ever got close to that was Arma 2.

Didn't know that. Never tried going there before doing the mission.

Actually focus was directly related to AP usage, it just wasn't the only thing.
---
It's definitely not the same in 76.  Probably because pistols were way overpowered.  With the right build you had longer range than riles, could shoot like 40 times per al99 bar which would refill from luck perks and increase accuracy per shot.

I think it was in challenges

No worries. My fiancee is a way higher level than me so that's why I know about the before and after

I was level 19 and he locked me in a rad chamber, and I eventually died, but looking back on it, it was pretty funny.

I found a Pied Piper reference, and eyebot playing a pipe song, with about 4 rad-rats looking up at him. I took a picture of it.

Does it bother anyone else that they're not being more explicit about what they're hotfixing? Probably fine, but I do find it a little odd.

Glitches are all I use photo mode for these days. My favorite is when an enemy glitches in place, standing, and I make my character pose with it. Got some great shots that way

When you pair the perks with the right weapons and armor you can use any type of weapon and do significant damage and have a viable build, but you still need to be smart about perk choices and some choices are definitely more viable than others.

At least when you tag/kill them way off in the distance you don't have to run to find the body cuz you know nothing dropped right? :/

Yes please. I do this all the time and it is so incredibly frustrating that at a certain point, I gave up on opening safes/doors that were below 2 lockpick skill because they couldn‚Äôt possibly offer enough rewards to be worth the time/frustration it took to swap the perk cards in.

Never seen a mothman that didn't engage me on sight. Even had a scorched one show up in my camp once. That one scared the shit out of me cuz it poofed in right in front of me as i turned around.
---
Cool. But you still play? There just seems to be this sequence of posts that I've seen lately, that either consist of 'I hate grinding, so I'm leaving' or 'I'm sick of only finding crap legendaries in my fights', or one from a level 40 stating they'd done everything and the game sucked badly. Obviously not that bad that they stayed and finished it though. You put some time into the game and it's paid off for you.

Perhaps there's a difference in how one spends the time to get the exp.  There's not much depth in terms of questing or story for FO76.  More (original and creative) quests gets one the exp without the repetition, thus decreasing the feeling of 'grinding'.

---
I doesn't really bother me. I am guessing they release hotfixes with no release notes on purpose because they're making server-side changes that the public can't know about. I'd also wager that when they release major patches with full notes that they take measures against dupers and don't mention anything about the specifics.

The Enclave are neither socialist, nor do they believe in a state-administered yet privately-owned business sector.  Hence, not fascist.  If anything, they are the worst aspects of runaway capitalism mixed with the authoritarianism seen among fascists/socialists/communists.

My wife cant play video games - in her own worlds she "moves like a drunk monkey" always look at the ground or the sky - basically everywhere except where she needs to look.

Also would like one of those giant super mutants to pick one of us up by the legs and thwack people with us. That'd be fun.

well what context  is it when they are jumping up and down with the mutation and one hitting the entire event group with a tesla rifle yet when we shoot him in the air no dmg lol.

That does. Thank you
---
With upcoming updates this will not matter 
---
My guess is they do this because if we had the notes early players could scramble to get around fixes before it drops. Like when they did carry weight, people would move everything around to keep cheating the system.

I didn't even notice, I was just holding it to put on another character. Took me 2 days to notice

He was just testing you brother, to see if you are ready.

The Mothman cannot die. Does he leave a corpse? Nay all that is left after the test is but dust, and the rewards he leaves for you.

I've got a Gatling Laser but it doesn't seem very powerful; the best way I've killed them is with a Deathclaw more than shooting at them.  What damage is your Gatling?

So if I scrap just left arms will that unlock buttressed chest?

I picked up tons of the mats and tons of the broken cores but when I went to the bench I didn‚Äôt see a selection to repair the cores....I would love help but I am on PC :(

I had this happen to me when I died. My stuff completely disappeared, and this why I am done with this game for a while.

It's super annoying because if you share the ps4 it also shares gallery with the other people.

Love the fog and the ghoul idea.

Here's my wish list:

New radio songs - this would be a great idea in-game, but I would pay atoms for them too.

Cat and/or dog bowls that would spawn a non-killable pet that could roam around your camp

Grognak themed posters, apparel, and collectibles.
---
Those creepy wood/skeleton effigies

Yeah I picked up like 20+ of those and every time I did it said core added but I could never find the machine to put them in. I only had the ‚ÄúPIP‚Äù on the tinkers bench and it had no option to do anything with cores.... :(

Yesterday I had an indicator on the compass, a diamond on the map, but no 'in world' marker. Took me a few minutes of back and forth over the same area to find it. Sitting just on the inside of a plant surround at the entrance to Whitesprings. In the dark. In a nuke zone. Lots of swearing on my part until I found it.

My husband and I do this too. I was the one who got him into rpgs and Bethesda back in Oblivion days. I really really hope we can play the next elder scrolls together.

Oh definitely. If there's one thing you can count on Bethesda for it's that they don't make commitments lightly. They rarely make them at all as a matter of fact lol. FO76 is definitely the exception to the quality of their work on release.

Id also like to mention, because I've seen a few newer players not understand this, the vendor caps are not shared between players, they are shared between the factions and are separate for every player.

Closest thing you can do is team up with them, and help them build their camp. You can build items in their camp that you have plans for and they dont. That includes items from the atomic shop.

I think a good way of forcing them to land is to give a grenade plan when completing the Free States questline that acts as one of the lures from that one event. When I read the terminal entry my first thought was we'd get a grenade to ground those bastards, but we never did. Make it a terminal entry in Abby's Bunker that way people who have already completed the quest just need to go back in and grab it, and people who don't want it don't have to have it.

Some of my good ones.

Agree, bears are more terrifying than deathclaws 
---
I wouldnt mind getting involved with this.  I think this would be fun. 
---
I might know some targets let me know when you find a crew
---
you on xbox?
---
~300 or so reg stims on my main plus ~300 diluted. And like ~700 or so on my mule of reg stims and about the same in diluted. I have a problem, I farm tick blood and turn it all into stims and diluted stims. Finally started selling the diluted stims to vendors. 
---
Sometimes when i come across them they just stand there and let me shoot them. 
---
Literally the first one I encountered ever scared the crap out of me.  And that was locked inside a chicken coop, in Fallout 2, and even then there was an oversight where you could shoot it through a hole in one of the walls :-/
---
Oh I've ran into Grahm a few times. Don't you miss dialogue choices though? Even just to ask questions for flavor text on the player's behalf for tone. Rather than have all dialogue given to you without variation or unable to ask for information on say, a quest.
---
My name is Th3_magic1an 
---
All scorchbeasts should be a minimum of a 1\* legendary. All of them should provide a legendary item, a plan chance and other worthwhile rewards. 
---
I don't like to be a game whiner, but 9 times out of 10, I run from them. Rewards aren't worth it. 
---
Honestly, same for deathclaws. 
---
It is indeed scrollable just keep hitting the down arrow :)
---
Yup.
---
Proof: https://i.imgur.com/74TKRpp.jpg
---
Please elaborate
---
Worked perfectly, thank you!
---
They‚Äôre still 100% capable of staggering you though, and damn they do it a lot. I‚Äôm kind of in the minority here that I strongly disagree: they‚Äôre still incredibly formidable and dangerous for me, and if anything they need a nerf, certainly not a boost. 
---
My name is Th3_Magic1an 
---
Seems like they do this for some events but then so it should be possible. I‚Äôd appreciate this as well
---
I avoid Scorchbeasts at all costs because it's just not worth it. I can be 30+ levels above one and I'll still walk away with all my ammo gone, all my armor broken, half of my weapons broken and *ALL* of my time wasted. Would rather just idle inside a house for 20 minutes until it gets bored and leaves me alone lol 
---
Praise him. 
---
Thx I hope they look cool
---
That got dark quick 
---
Did they say unlimited caps for vendors??
---
Honestly I have no idea if anyone even hears anything I say. I get the icon at the bottom of the screen so I know the mic is at least functional. But I seriously have had exactly zero replies whenever I say something.
---
You don't know about the data mine do you? It's coming, in both silver and gold. Enjoy.
---
I got mine in the museum in Helvetia.  PS4.
---
I have a red and pink Iv been thinking of selling but they don‚Äôt go cheap. Like 8k for red. I got mine before they were duped and paid a ton for it. 
---
Those are really cool. I‚Äôd love to hang them in my camp. 
---
The issue, I think, is that you can hot-swap cards at will, in about 15 seconds.  For things like "I want to pick that level 3 lock right there", it just creates busywork; open up the Pip-boy, open up Perks, remove some points in Per, add the Pick Lock cards, back out, pick lock, now reverse all that.  You're not under threat, so it's just a waste of the player's time, futzing with menus.  
---
For combat scenarios, you can't take that time; the choice-making makes sense and the mechanic works well IMO.
---
I'm not sold on making them all passives; it frees the player up too much, and making choices is a good thing.  Perhaps a better way to go would be semi-passives; have getting the Hacker/Lockpick cards passively unlock being ABLE to pick those locks, but scale up the difficulty somewhat from their current levels.  Now, have those perk cards, when EQUIPPED, provide a greater boost to performance, to bring that difficulty back down.  Level 3s should be REALLY hard to get without the lockpick cards equipped, but POSSIBLE.  Maybe you'll break 5-6 bobby pins cracking it, but hey, I get too many as it is.  Maybe add some other passives, like improving the rewards slightly (10% or so, or an extra spawn of ammo/food), make the perks APPEALING, but not NECESSARY.  Then people will think about whether it's worth it to hotswap at all, whereas now, you're just adding time in menus or making the player say "eh, it's not worth it anyway".
---
The crafting perks and such I feel are less of an issue; you only need them occasionally as it is.  I'd like a hotswap button for two distinct perk builds, but that would honestly fix a lot of these issues, being able to go from Combat to Utility at a keypress.
---
Shut up juice^
---
So just don't fight them? They have short attention spans and are fun to train into other mobs or players.
---
To me they‚Äôre not about killing and loot.
---
Honestly, I don‚Äôt are what level I get to, I still want some monster to appear that I have no choice but to hide from.
---
Got 2 for wife and I in Sea of thieves, then 2 more so kids could sail with us. Then I wanted an x so just hit number 5 üòÄ. I can host a heck of a fallout party
---
My biggest problem with the large creatures in general is although they were necessary to make the game worthwhile, running into a humongous mutated creatures all the time sort of like immersion. I like the game, it just doesn't feel like Fallout, il but rather a game based on a similar concept.
---
Is that because meat hook is glitched to have both perk cards?
---
Here's hoping bethesda takes that perk loadout mod and makes it a feature.
---
T51 and X01 
---
Take it from someone else's. 
---
But in all seriousness, moving near water is your best bet. There are hundreds of little ponds that are off the beaten path 
---
I have mine in the savage divide, south of big reds BBQ shack and east of the middle mountain cabins 
---
Think Bethesda says 24 players max per server so they could make a space with 24 vending machines to claim there. Maybe the upstairs that‚Äôs closed off via a hand scanner would be the spot. 
---
Which trading venue did you use?  You may be able to get him banned if you have video proof.  
---
Chalk one up to my derpiness then! lol
---
If you find a pattern, let me know. I've been curious why it was the way it is :P
---
Fer real? No thanks then, I'll keep the beaten up look. I hate the blinged out versions of any weapon...
---
The anti-non-invulnerability patch. Noice.,,,
---
It's the decommissioned one in an employee's only area. And I shot at it and it touched a little but that was it 
---
OK where  do I send it
---
I've always been reminded of starship troopers when I see those things. Cool pic
---
Im down to join, gt is N8Belcher
---
Sorry "it's currently fucking piss-poor on the actual content side" did not sound like constructive criticism.
---
All I was saying is that if you think it's that bad, I honestly want to know why you don't play something else.
---
And you finally answered.  You like the game and it is enjoyable as is.
---
Which I guess is a great reason to say it is fucking piss-poor in content, and my wondering why you continue makes me a fucking fanboy, an asshole, what is wrong with the game industry, et cetera.
---
To be fair, you really opened my eyes as to why so many miss human NPCs.  They probably ran into you.
---
I'd say you have no idea, but I think we all do! lol 
---
Fingers firmly crossed for the Wasterlander update adding NPCs... Praise be to Todd.
---
goddamn it
---
Did you go through r/market76?  
---
If so, see about contacting mods there.  
---
If not, I highly recommend using that sub from now on.
---
Whats this guys IGN?  At least get a warning out 
---
Did you have one
---
I feel you. I got offers from friends, but I got lucky and found my god gun from farming White Springs the first month.
---
So far if a cave has been part of a quest it has been really well done, but I definitely don't go randomly spelunking. 
---
This makes me sad. 
---
I love Skyrim, but still don't like caves.   The ice caverns in the north I an ok with though.   
---
That wasn't a very good video. 
---
No, you can't build atomic shop items in other people's camps anymore
---
I don‚Äôt want it to be bling, one of my friends wants a solid gold version but that would be taking it too far. I just want the covers on the receivers and the barrels. You can‚Äôt say that your player character isn‚Äôt smart enough to put those on all weapon mods as apprised to only a few.
---
But if they make a new model for the shop, AKS-74U please üòä
---
Omg I bet they‚Äôre hilarious!
---
I WISH you could shoot certain meds like a tranq gun.  Can you imagine the pvp potential of tagging enemies mid-fight with Med-X?
---
Give em the ol' spicy crossbow
---
On ps4, he was reading this post if you can believe it. I made this threat and he looked up this post after that, videos coming soon 
---
There's a feature for this. I can't open a trade right now to look but I'm on PS4 and when someone requests something you have a bunch of options of how to say no.
---
Some of them are great. Yao Guai floating in the air, me posing next to wild dogs, scorched, and one of me next to a giant sloth... fun stuff!
---
I won't name who but prior to the patch i decided to take on these 2 that were being all cocky about themselves and consider themselves king of the servers their in. So i decided to join their world and hunt them down in which they didn't even bother to hide, and even built me a sweet present of them being wanted for over 500 caps each. 
---
I engaged with my usual no junk no caps,check and make sure pacifist is off, being a stealth/bloodied build i only role in with less than 150lbs total (more about this later). 
---
I soon as i spot these 2 running around in WS wearing PA i thought to myself this is going to be quick and easy. Nope! I used 4 of my guns and emptied them all out as they just kept walking around taunting me, out of all 4 guns i have the one that does the lesst damage for my build is my quad gauss, and it does about 500+ damage, and yet these 2 doesn't seem to be taking any damage at all.
---
Now to make things more interesting they some how managed to get me moving as if im overencumbered,  in which i am not. They also managed to make themselves invisible while standing up walking around for more than 5 minutes, so no its not a stealth boy. And then they asked me if i was ready?, i said for what? They said to die. I said sure... they told me to remove all my armor  to save me the hassle of fixing them because they will break once they hit me. 
---
Now fast forward to the interesting bits, they made me an ini along with some other game files in which they said would run well with my build, they say to just copy and paste to game folder. So i backed up my game folder and pasted the files they gave overwriting the original files. My gauss was now doing 3k+ damage, i am able to be invisible in my X01 walking around and my health would not go below 30 percent and do endless vats as my AP bar does not move past 90 percent. Having this though made the game so laggy for me and wasn't as fun anymore so i reverted back. If i want to be invincible ill just play F04 and type TGM and not deal with some lag. 
---
Never touched it again since the last patch. It was an interesting experiment. If only reddit would let me post pics without having to have a separate pic hosting site account i would post pics of all these. And these people already contacted Bethesda regarding these game exploits and they did show proof of it. (Hint they make videos).
---
I can make all of x01 &amp; all but 1 piece of T51
---
The prison north of Morgantown can reward the short laser pistol plan. Just have to hope you get it and then unlock the mods to do what you will. 
---
Seen it several times. If you get close to them they will swing at you though. No prisoners 
---
Luntz on ps4
---
Level 76 Yoguai are scarier. The constant stun and knocking. 
---
‚Äîclose
---
I‚Äôll pay 2000 for the rifle if you are ps4
---
Flechette mod on the harpoon gun does this too.  Each shot is something like six harpoons - fight a string of enemies and I‚Äôll end up with 20 extra rounds, despite looting zero off some of the bodies :)
---
Yeah, thought that too. I was in the middle of doing a launch when they expired and I have a buddy down in a silo waiting if we can get the new ones figured out. Not looking good though
---
I‚Äôm sorry I just want to know how much it would be worth. I don‚Äôt have one sorry
---
My wife bought fallout76 for our boys a few months ago. They ended up losing the xbox and tv because of their filthy room. So she put them under my tv in the living room and started playing. Now we have 3 xboxes! We all play together now and we love it. It has really made the end game more interesting for me and we get to connect with the kids in a way we never would be able to otherwise. 
---
Mini-nuke crossbow - call the mod ‚ÄúBroken Arrow‚Äù &gt;.&lt;
---
Kids with hangovers and weapons?
---
I think if that‚Äôs true and the. You pickup too much junk it would trigger the ban hammer  
---
Yeah I still play. My main is only a lvl 109. Now I just have a new goal. I wanted a full set of Unyielding Cavalier. Now that I have it 4 out of 5 are marine, I‚Äôm looking to replace my combat piece for a matching marine piece. And then 2 of 5 are powered. I will attempt to trade out the non powered pieces for marine powered. After all that I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll have a new goal. Probably start focusing on an alternate character. 
---
What platform are you on?
---
If you think of lock picking/hacking/crafting perk cards as instruction manuals that you have to read before you pick a lock or craft something, it does seem ridiculous that you should have to read them every time. You think youd remember how to do that stuff eventually without having to carry the instruction manuals around with you everywhere you go. 
---
Wanting to be Chewbacca, hmm?
---
Duck season!
---
Yeah that'd be great. Wastelanders anyone?
---
It my be due to the update and scheduled maintenance in the morning. 
---
I just tried 4 pieces of Chameleon and I noticed I could move a little more before the Chameleon effect wore off versus wearing 1 piece.
---
Each piece seems to "turn off" and "turn on" in sequence as you move a bit giving you more time before the effect completely turns off. Not really enough to actually get anywhere but maybe useful for adjusting position.
---
Now, what did you learn?
---
I'm using a TSE gauss with maxed rifle perks, tank killer, concentrated shots, bloody mess, covert op and it still takes 8 sneak attack shots to kill a level 50 scorchbeast. Any of the higher level scorchbeast  can take a good 12-15 sneak attack shots. There are much better options for killing scorchbeast (eg melee).
---
Always upload
---
The whitesprings is good. You can put one close to the ghoul farming place. 
---
PC
---
No your right, I forgot they were an enclave project not an army one. Still want it. Maybe we can get the Army prototype.
---
Got 20 yellowcake for you.
---
They might end up rotating the challenges after they get through the ones they already have planned.
---
Either way, your friend will probably be able to buy it from other players as well. I got mine, but I'm planning on selling it after I've played around with it for a bit.
---
I think all the mods should be shown, but greyed out until you learn them.
---
It appears that the current week's codes are expired already and new ones are not ready yet. I'd be down to help on pc when they're up again. ign: dickenstein
---
Explosive bait will land them, I hear.
---
Mined going on the rack above the fireplace. Lol
---
I'm on Xbox or if help ya out.
---
They said 1400 caps between all the vendors so you can sell everything at one place. Also something about all the factions have a vendor at the whitesprings if you want to buy. I just repeat things with no proof or fact checking so I could be way off
---
They data mined a silver and gold plated paint job. 
---
If only we could display weapons in our camps...I would freaking love that
---
i'd actually agree with this, they used to travel in good size packs in fallout 3 and new vegas‚Ä¶ then stopped doing that for some reason?
---
Death claws we're always scary when they're were a bunch around.
---
They are fixing stability issues and invincibility upon spawning and traveling in Survival.
---
Not unlimited, but 1400 pooled at the whitespring since it will have 1 vendor from each faction after the update. 
---
Also Graham‚Äôs caps are shared with watoga.
---
This issue is being hotfixed
---
I‚Äôd personally prefer a small passive tree withIn the perk card system.  You unlock 1 every 10 levels and can put a few into it to a max of 10.  Gathering (woodchucker, scrapper, green thumb) and access (hacker lockpick) for sure.  I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a few others that would warrant such treatment, and a good 3 or 4 letter acronym should cover them all.
---
The perk switching for passive things like this is just busywork.  This cuts down on said busywork, but, if done well, doesn‚Äôt eliminate it and adds more of a goal to leveling.
---
The Scorched speak a little. You'll see...
---
I didnt know they patched that, havent tried lately though. I know that it has worked in the past. I still have a glow in the dark map of Appalachia in my camp that a friend built for a while ago.   
---
I am on xbox. 
---
I love the way the caves are done, especially in respect of lighting, but I get where you‚Äôre coming from. 
---
Personally, I‚Äôm terrified of water...and not just in this game either. Any time I have to swim above or below the surface with little visibility, I get very anxious. Sometimes to the point where I refuse to go that way.
---
Completely irrational.
---
Or a handjob for the paintmade!
---
True you need to know the weights and how mods effect it
---
Nice how much per?
---
Where the hell did they say this?
---
Hopefully this week's challenge isn't so arduous.  Finding 25 starred legendary enemies sucked. Especially since "tagging" them doesn't count. It was a damn free for all every uranium fever event!!üòÇüòÇ

---

This is being hotfixed tomorrow
---
50 per
---
LOL.  Ever heard of "chance to hit?"  You can improve your accuracy with perks (depending on your weapon).  This isn't a straight-up shooter.

Smart. üëç I'm still looking for beachfront property. I am sorely disappointed. 
---
Dad what is that? Son, it looks like a big large... Johnson, Johnson are you listening to me? Sorry sir, in the sky, it looks like a giant.... Wiener! Get your ball park wiener here.
---
A square perimeter would be nice - more space available to be built in compared to a circle of the same size, and it would make sense for if they one day allow snapping multiple CAMPs together. 
---
If i don't get too close to one of the variant (not sure wich, the most ordinary one maybe), it won't attack.
---
I'm actually a pacifist in real life, I just don't like it when a 9 foot tall mutated jackson lizard picks me up and slams me into the ground repeatedly so I cant climb into my suit of super armor and fire a miniature nuclear bomb at them.  
---
Why do you need to server hop?
---
You on PS4?  I‚Äôll help 
---
This should be a ps4 background 
---
Also, if you're playing PC, your aim improves if you use the right mouse button which is your aiming button.  Accuracy will increase quite a bit.
---
Yup. I truly enjoy hunting them with a rifle. Sweep the leg. Win.
---
With bloodied melee build they are a friggin joke. 2 or 3 hits without chems. 
---
A deathclaw is only a threat to noobs.

Too funny I had posted this sentiment and not even seen your post.

Square plots allow people to make their own little towns with their friends.  Hell I‚Äôd make a huge boxing/thunder...cube cage if we ever got some raider theme stuff.

I particularly like the glasses cavern by I hat wendigo cave I'm just glad you can jump to the ledge at the beginning and skip all the other stuff.

Sounds good.

That's just gonna attract scorchbeasts dood. and then your camp will be covered in scorchbeast guano. Ick.

Oh man, that's a revelation. I'll be trying that tonight.

By the way, inside the vault showed their roadmap and there is sheduled updated called "camera".

I have that plan. I‚Äôll work on doing that thanks!
---
There's supposedly a "hopping" strategy to get sentinel to trigger while moving, though I haven't been able to trigger it consistently. Was he stationary before leaving the ground? Either way, on wanted guys I usually check the time survived leaderboard. If it's more than 15 minutes I assume they're out of my weight class and puck anither target.
---
Someone else commented that explosive bait can make them land.
---
Same sort of set up for us. Side-by-side tvs with Xbox 1s, with a bonus tv and Xbox 1 in the master bedroom, if we want to play different games etc.  
---
We are currently level 75 and 94 in FO76 and love it for allowing us to finally play together in the wasteland.
---
Two thumbs up for having your sweetie be your gaming buddy.
---
If you bring up the map, at upper right there is a social menu. You can accept invites in there clicking on the username.

I think there's also a shortcut to do it faster, but i don't know pc shortcuts. Look for them in the game settings.

Thx for this post too. 
---
In 250+ levels and MANY attempts,I've never managed to get him to show at the.Charleston station either.
---
Tbh I literally smacked a guy with my lvl 50 all rise with maxed slugger perks and it did no damage and we both had pacifist mode off
---
Ha, Gary!!

I had a legendary Super Mutant do the same thing, except he was dabbing xD

I love how you could equip the prison neck thing and wedding ring

Yeah, read my actual fucking entire posts and not just the few little bits of profanity.

I know the camp spot you're talking about, how did you stop your lead deposit getting attacked? Is it better not to place turrets or heaps of rocket turrets?

---
No. I really didn't make that phrase up. 
---
Munchkin is an old gaming term (from the 80s) making fun of people who are only into playing RPGs for the loot, who only care about maxing out stats and finding broken OP builds.
---
nice I will definitely try that out
---
Theres lakeside cabins area if you can use your imagination üòÇ
---
I've said this before, but I really don't want everyone to know where my camp is.  I've got a really good spot that has some great resources.  It's already pretty popular, and sometimes I have to go through a few servers before I find one where my camp is available.  
---
If everyone that has a camp in my spot starts advertising it's location, more people will see what it has to offer.  Eventually it will become impossible to find a server where my camp is available.
---
If only it was an easy way to game share with a family. 
---
We stayed in the vault longer than the rest.  And the Scorched disease is what wiped everyone out before we got out.
---
Nerf ALL THE THINGS We need a nerf war!
---
Didn't know that. I was thinking more like a sonic explosion that just straight up grounded them for a time, but I guess bait meat works.
---
Aww that sucks
---
I've actually taken to picking a point on the map (tbh I use the online map) and then I explore the surrounding areas and any point of interests i see. Other day I was strolling thru the hills and came across a chameleon dragon law and 3 yao gui all running at me
---
That‚Äôs why we would just radio to them. 
---
Oh alright. Thanks for telling me.
---
Hey! So do these explode when you take them off? I'm kinda guessing so but I put it on anyway. Love a freakin' COLLAR! Decided to search to find out what to expect and this post was what came up.
---
&gt; Kids with hangovers and weapons?

Or a job made for the hand paint

It‚Äôs all about what the engine can handle. They just admitted at PAX that they tried putting camps next to each other and it affected the engines performance, so spacing is needed. They also mentioned cutting down trees and how that caused a lot of issues. Building was going to be entirely workshops but luckily we got CAMPs. Not being able to build because of ‚Äòobject is floating is annoying‚Äô but it‚Äôs becuase of level design. Some places mounds of dirt or the level of terrain isn‚Äôt actually the floor, more of a prop you can walk on and other times you are just happening to build on small spaces between terrain that either draw cells, types of terrain (concert, dirt) or just oversight when piecing together. In my opinion I don‚Äôt notice this problem to often in workshops becuase I believe they smoothed those areas out more becuase they were intentionally the only building locations. There are some rare instances you could fall through these ‚Äòthin gaps‚Äô, more so on older games in the engine (Fallout 4, Skyrim, Etc..)  So reasons why it‚Äôs a circle is because I believe the game loads in around you in a circular way, as if there was a flashlight shined straight down onto your player and followed them around so anything that‚Äôs not in the light of he flashlight isn‚Äôt fully rendered. They probably kept it this way because it was easier on the engine. For the reasons why you can‚Äôt connect floors or foundations is because they are both indestructible objects. Back when stacking blocks and adding floors to blocks from the rug method (which I believe is all patched now) you could essentially make yourself and indestructible bunker. I‚Äôve seen people still using a bunker this week in Survival mode and it was pretty cheat to be honest because they just hide and only popped out to shoot or they just waited for you to come to the only entrance and mow you down on the steps. Unfortunately they didn‚Äôt implement a lot of the building from Fallout 4, but it‚Äôs because the game is different and intended to be played differently
---
Well you just got offered the high side of prices for it. They go for 1.5-2k caps. 
---
BTW 1* unyielding isn't worth anything. Most people vendor it. Get a 2 or 3* and it's another thing.
---
Same here , I don‚Äôt think I could make it trough another week of legendaries without purging lovable items.
---
Worse to wait for the legendary vendor :/ 
---
THIS lol
---
Alright good to know. Thanks
---
I've heard that a lot recently with the new game mode. I have yet to try it but I hate games where players do that. That having been said, I highly doubt I'll bother trying Survival mode.  I'm content with the normal game.
---
Hi everyone,
---
Starting at 11:00 a.m. EDT on Tuesday, April 2, we‚Äôre planning to bring Fallout 76 offline across all platforms to perform maintenance and apply a hotfix. This update includes a fix for an issue that could cause the game client to crash and will also address an issue affecting the invulnerability effect applied to Survival mode characters after Fast Traveling or Respawning.
---
We will let you know as soon as downtime begins tomorrow, and you can return to this thread for updates as maintenance progresses. Please note: There will be no patch notes following this update.
---
Thank you very much!
---
Gaaaaryyy...
---
A square or rectangular boundary would be great
---
This would be helpful when vending occurs
---
Exactly, explosive bait
---
Omg I‚Äôd love to see that!
---
I know, right? üíñüíñüíñ so glad someone else is just as excited! üòä
---
&gt;When you pair the perks with the right weapons and armor you can use any type of weapon and do significant damage and have a viable build, but you still need to be smart about perk choices and some choices are definitely more viable than others. 
---
In theory that's true, but if you're specced for melee they're a pain in the ass because they never land. 
---
Yeah let's maybe buff some useless things before going down the nerf road any further...
---
Don‚Äôt tell him, OP! 
---
::: shakes fist at Liberty Prime:::
---
I've done it twice the past few days.  No issues here.
---
I don‚Äôt mean to criticize at all but you do realize the developers said in a recent panel at Pax East that they go on this subreddit and read the feedback... 
---
X01 and a TSE Combat Shotgun melts the 85s in 5s tops. You jsut gotta run circles until they drop, if they drop.
---
Better option: 
---
Civil War Top Hat plan. 
---
1 cloth = 35 caps with hard bargain, 4 char. 
---
Where do you get the plan. I‚Äôve heard of this. 
---
Im on pc the diverse player base is a issue. No cross play:(
---
There is no reason why lockpicking, hacking, and all crafting perks cannot be passives that are always on.  Or at least make them active when Im in my camp or a friends camp.  This back and forth with perks to craft shit at my own camp makes no sense.
---
At least you can drop atomic shop clothes, or was that part of the patch too? I gave my friends Starlet Sniper outfits so we could run as a pack of lone wolves.
---
isnt it really a bit of a trash event anyways!?
---
Nah your right. To many people whine about what it should be, or what they want to be. 
---
I like it the way it is.
---
* As long as they keep up with adding new content.
---
&gt; Nah you're right, it's a gaming subreddit, so it should equates that in 99.99%
---
kek
---
 By Atom, this is a great idea.  While they are at it, make a crafting recipe for cooking oil and/or remove it from the auto scrap list.
---
There's a few places where the Handy gets stuck.  It's very annoying and one of the reasons I've come to ignoring this event.  If the Handy is not moving at all, there should be a script to warp him to some waypoint so it could try to get back on track.
---
Still there?
---
Ye I second this question. I have been in that area many times and I don't think I recall a "Janet's soft serve'
---
Suggestion:besides taking a pic of his inventory can u also take a pic of the map at the very location u meet him (so... As u leave its menu take a screen shot of the overall map) and possibly the surroundings (e.g the tipped bus) 
---
No turrets. It doesn't aggro scorchbeasts and if your cave is loud enough the SBs minions will spawn on the lower level and try (fail) to get in.
---
I love my quad 3 star crossbow. 
---
ez pz 2 hrs of leader of the pack, uranium fever, and one violent events
---
At this point all I kill them for is 525xp.
---
&gt; I gotta know what you been eating.
---
Canned Dog Food, what else?!
---
My dude I can read. 
---
My issue is this:
---
&gt;Please note: There will be no patch notes following this update. 
---
That's my issue. Normally they release patch notes during the update. They're not doing this time. I find that interesting.
---
Yes
---
Il join fast ! 
---
Psn?
---
Bruhski if u only want cool funnies then you are in the wrong place my friend.
---
Without suggestions and complaints we probably wouldn‚Äôt have our roadmap, we might not heard a peep from BGS still, &amp; we might not have been heard out about all of content and QOL feats like we are being delivered currently. *shrugs*
---
M_string
---
Thanks for the update!
---
My wife only likes platformers like Mario and Crash. I AM SO UNSPEAKABLY JEALOUS 
---
I did and loved it. Thank you for giving me hope lol. I watch my guy play this and feel like I‚Äôm missing out. I have an account but can only play when he isn‚Äôt.. tbh don‚Äôt get much chance :D 
---
So I‚Äôve settled to just scavenging awesome FO76 community reddit posts to share updates and news to feel like I contribute. 
---
See it frequently on the BoS vendor bot. Level 168.
---
Thanks
---
I thought he the was stuck when I first approached him, then realized I had to "fix" him to get him moving.  
---
So its ok to put turrets in the cave?
---
I'm pretty sure the codes always changed at 8 pm EST on Monday. Don't know why they don't do it at 10 am with the challenges, but at the same time the sales they've been doing on the atom store store for the past week or 2 have always changed at 8pm, and the Biv quests reset at 8pm as well.
---
Raiders steal and cheat. Part of the game. Banning for a scummy move won't happen. 
---
Yeah!  There is still a month and 1/2 for that guy to show his head. I‚Äôve got too much stuff that I‚Äôve had to make some hard choices and start cutting things out of my stash....  it stinks big time
---
I'll help out if you're still looking for people.
---
We're near the crashed vertibird
---
What month is this?
---
This is the worst online gaming community
---
Like someone said before, they should all drop legendaries. Level 50 are *, level 65 are ** and level 85 are ***.
---
Instigating pitchfork, level 5- I‚Äôm interested for 500 caps
---
Oh you better believe!!!  They cut me deep when they showed it in some of the early trailers as a camp option..... and then it wasn‚Äôt there at the beta....
---
Yea, that's because it's a hotfix.
---
You're an idiot. My whole issue is I DON'T build a meta build. My build is what I like to play as, and I do not farm Scorchbeasts, I only fight them when I have to.
---
You need to get laid buddy.
---
If you ever come across Vampires melee weapons level 20 or under, let me know
---
You're logic is ridiculously flawed. The behavior that is causing someone to feel like they need to do anything but play the game the way they feel is best for them is the issue, and the fact that despite their recent efforts to separate the two playstyles, the harassment still continues.
---
You're essentially saying "If I hold a gun to your head, it's really your choice if you do what I say or not, and entirely your fault. My behavior is completely acceptable"
---
I don't know if anybody has said this yet but those ground cannons that can be repaired help me kill my first one without any other players' help. My God I was happy. You essentially clear out the scorched and dodge the Sierra Bravo energy circles and repair the guns whenever they break, they'll do it all for you. Somewhere north of Watoga I think.
---
Bait meat...lol.
---
But yeah, I haven't tested it myself. But I will be soon. I'll let you know the results.
---
I have not had any problems with them landing myself.  I am a heavy melee/shot gun build.  My camp is next to a spawn point.  Random flux drops would be pretty sweet though.
---
Agree! Agree!
---
Amen man. Now if only my wife would start playing.
---
All good. If I had a dollar for every time I misspoke, well. I'd have a lot of dollars.
---
It drops in one of the random event locations that you see along the roads. 
---
That‚Äôs exactly my feeling. Although I do remember sometimes finding weapon plans halfway down Belching Betty, so I used to farm it a bit when I was in my level 30s
---
No max level anymore, ever since the Vendor Update a few months ago, Patch 5?
---
I'm pretty sure that is also next week
---
Agreed. There are various underarmors u can wear
---
I know this is a little late, but did you ever find the Gatling laser gun you were looking for? I‚Äôm on PS4 and just found the plans for it. 
---
I'm saying that scrapping opens a window to scrap, but it doesn't activate the animation that would move you inside of their base. You would have had to use craft. It's the same with any bench, it's that way so that you can still scrap items when someone else is using it to craft.
---
The quest line might be.   I‚Äôm not 100%
---
8 generators sounds like a lot of noise. I could build a fusion generator for you if you‚Äôd want?
---
it will give also you a progressively better generator plan each time, and you can get the first couple in story missions, so it's a guarantee to get the fusion plan in 5 power plant runs or less. totally worth doing.
---
Yes! Thank you. I bought the plans at the enclave.
---
Thanks, I actually got it on my first try so I wasn't sure of the drop chances.
---
Thanks guys. Much appreciated.
---
Yeah it hasn't been that way for months, slowpoke. Check Harper's Ferry, Watoga, maybe Grafton
---
Don‚Äôt use train stations..don‚Äôt be a lemming and run towards the cliff
---
save some screws up, you need them to craft the fusion
---
Hello. I‚Äôm interested in the weight chest piece with sneak. 3k.
---
I'm not seeing the issue?  The crosshairs are always on the center of your screen... you move your view up/down/left/right to aim?
---
Again this is completely wrong and all you are doing is grasping at straws with your guesses. These people in question that I have found while they were top 3, had zero PvE enemies near them. You usually find them holed up in some dark room far away from any mobs or players, just crouching there camping, found them using the map.
---
Yup. And not their first one either. The last hotfix on February 1 had detailed patch notes: https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/44hSMCa7BGSxsftNvbMUQT/fallout-76-hotfix-notes-january-31-2019
---
That‚Äôs not ‚Äúraiding.‚Äù  That is theft.  Nice try, shithead.  
---
I want an mp3 of the theme!
---
Maybe. Whatever it is I wish they would add it to the game.
---
The nerve of a game with super mutants, moth men, giant death bats and on demand nuclear strikes not follow a strict path of realism! 
---
Name-calling is for children , and I did say Raiders steal
---
4-1 guys
---
I'd never had luck with ANYTHING taking the bait meat once it saw me so I never bothered trying. It'd be nice to see them be useful past starting a fight.
---
I wasnt talking about relaism... I just think it's funny that you'd find ammo and armor after killing certain things.. why do they have that stuff is what I was laughing at ya know? 
---
Cool stuff, great ship~
---
Like.. why does a flying monster have a random brotherhood of steel leg blue print ya know?
---
+karma
---
I am on pc and always have excess.
---
Silver_Golden and I am normally on eu times
---
Damn, hold him for an hour until I get home. Lol. Buggerbuggerbugger
---
Again nothing will happen to him he didn‚Äôt do anything wrong game wise sure he broke trust but that is it..welcome to the Wasteland kid..raider life
---
If you want to PvP. You build for PvP. End of story.
---
An easy fix for this is to go to a workbench and then scrap all junk. 
---
Ill admit in my younger years I used to giggle at the same stuff.  Every rpg ever has had rats or ghosts that drop money and items.  I suppose I'm just desensitized to the silliness.
---
Says gamertag doesnt exist
---
And I could see rp a raider... but the ducked thing is he found my post on market76and messaged me to come into his game for the mod to be put on. Going above and bend the game
---
I‚Äôve only been saving 2 and 3 stars.  Funnily enough I‚Äôm hoping as much for upgrading the level of legendaries as I am for working on my own.  I‚Äôve got some sweet level 5-35 drops.
---
However to be real about the legendary vendor, I don‚Äôt believe we will get to in essence write our own legendary.  I‚Äôm thinking we will get to retool one of the ‚Äústars‚Äù on our gear for tokens, so you build it with a bit of luck over time.
---
I know that you can't lead a ahot. You have to have the sights dead on when a target's moving. It drives me crazy!!!
---
They quite rare yea, I found 1 in a treasure mound, 1 around top of the world area and the other from a scorchbeast drop.
---
They're the highest tier of damage resistance for combat armour.
---
Why should someone who isn't ready for PvP hqve a chance against someone fully specced and equipped?
---
Wabbit Season!
---
There's a "z" and a space
---
I have plans and hats 300 caps each stargatefan2 
---
I was pretty sure I used the scrap commend, but maybe I just spammed the wrong in my haste to jump and spam at the same time.  I thought it was pretty neat that I wound up inside their camp, at any rate.
---
Dear Bethesda,
---
Please nerf paper it's too op, Scissors are fine though. 
---
Love, 
---
Rock
---
good stuff, Bethesda take notes
---
I don't believe there are any other roofs.  They'd show up in your build menu even if you didn't know the plans (would just tell you you have to learn the plans / buy from atom shop).
---
Am I just bad at this game? I'm level 39 and I can't believe how many people I see saying enemies are easy. Even just like level 28 super mutants and level 30 mole miners feel like bullet sponges to me
---
Probably my favorite atom shop piece so far.  Really makes the house cozier.
---
I think I have about 60kg of plans now, I will be glad to be able to get them moving.
---
Also planning to have free water and low cost junk
---
This is a good spot but recently he stopped spawning there for me.  Always a bunch of ghouls or scorched down by the bus.
---
I'm just using floors instead of roof as floors are indestructible
---
Maybe it‚Äôs because they have already said what they would be addressing this time, in that last hotfix we didn‚Äôt know what was being addressed until it happened. Whatever reason it is, you won‚Äôt get an answer from them, so why waste your time asking the question in a forum where no one will have the answer.
---
Okay, I need to sell some stuff to get the caps together
---
where is the best place to look them up? 
---
This. Seriously in a game this unstable, it baffles me how some people can be this naive.
---
At level 55 with a base .50 HMG, no chems/mutations, no sneak bonus, only +40% damage from heavy gunner perks, and 1 point in Stabilized; I could delete a 91 legendary glowing Deathclaw in like 3 seconds. 
---
They‚Äôre absolutely worthless enemies and need to either travel in packs like they used to or get a serious armor/speed buff. 
---
Why did you even bother answering...?
---
If you can find one, executioners the dragon with +10 % damage while aiming and quad capacity.  I know it exist i have one. I sometimes run a bloodied/stealth build with an Assassins/AA gauss rifle, 3* bloodied grognak axe, and a 3* furious/assassins handmade that also has quad ammo capacity and for armor Assassins/sentinels, these armors dont have to have the legendary prefix on them to have the legendary perks/stats.
---
I have a mutants metal armor i bought of a vendor that has 3* stars, the person that sold it probably did not even bother to look at what the other stars were before selling it or just did not care for it, but that armor not only gave you damage and energy resistance when mutated, it also has the assassins/sentinels effect on it. 
---
So thats just an example of how you can find good gear without it having to drop for you. I didn't start getting good 3* drops until i was past lvl 140+ and still even then most would be 1* zealots wood armors or a 3* hunters legendary tire iron.
---
You posted a bug and I responded with a fix.  Not sure what else you wanted lol 
---
It's the new clan
---
Hehehe, the curse of this screen name. Yes, yes indeed.
---
Which floors?
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
Any
---
Says I'm on PS4
---
That's how I do it, spam my brother with pics so I can use my phone lol
---
They stick to their slimy skin when they land in fort defiance.
---
That's what I was afraid of
---
I was told by someone they received a plan for shielded road leathers (or whatever the all encompassing category of underarmor that falls under). I'm currently sitting with only resistant, and I'm level 161. So I'm under the impression that it's useful.
---
Not really the point tho. Just another broken thing in this game. It's unacceptable. Not to mention, last night I had a level 60 something join me in that failure. They didn't find it to be useless. 
---
Something. So I can stop picking up assault and combat rifles QQ
---
That‚Äôs really odd. I can‚Äôt imagine having to type that in every time you get logged out of the game by a server issue.
---
Also need them for the excavator which I'm still saving for lol 
---
Probably mule accounts. 
---
I can only imagine lol
---
I tried to use concrete but it kept saying it wasn't supported. Or does it not work if you used certain types? Really tried to make a bunker
---
yeh i just cant justify keeping any but all rise as the rest just dont match up to even 1* legendarys that can drop RNG
---
It was an April Fool's joke. As in griefing is bad and you should never do it. Try being a decent human being for once? That kinda thing.
---
Fuck ya! Sink your missile deep in that fissure till it explodes all over!!
---
I knew foundations were indestructible, but I did not think standard floors were (ones used to make floors for 2nd+ stories.
---
That's okay, I like to earn my plans. And I have them enclosed too so its less noise unless you're right next to thek
---
Not Foundation but floors
---
I agree on the warping aspect. Something to move him along. Not very handy, as is. ;-) 
---
I definitely try that
---
I watch his videos but didn‚Äôt put the April‚Äôs fools joke together. I didn‚Äôt even realize it until later. 
---
I bookmarked this a while back it's been really useful:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a5pbsr/every_weapon_mods_learn_chance/
---
It is, I could just imagine someone trying it with the scrap button and wondering why it didn't work lol. It does work with the crafting button though. 
---
Good idea. Keep it up in your house building as it looks awesome
---
I'm kidding lol.... console has no typing to log in so I didn't kno bout that... dang
---
Lmao üòÇ smoke another one I reckon.
---
Though I suppose that is the point of a good one, you don't get it right away.
---
Thank you for the reply, but that's not what I'm referring to. That's just how you get the quest started. I understand that part of it. What I'm talking about happens after he gets moving, then, usually after the first set of enemies appears, he just stops and refuses to go any further. 
---
See for me, I just enjoy killing. When I open my pip and see max caps were hit yet again, I don't even smirk. Caps are nothing, but the thrill of ending someone, easy as it may be, is the true fun.
---
Number 16 5000
---
Easy,  just look at your screen. 
---
No really. When your pointer/crosshairs hover over it it would say (known) if front of the plans description,  if its at a vendor or trade menu it would be at the very top and has the (known) in front of the plan/recipe's description. 
---
how much you looking to get for marine unyeilding chest piece?
---
That's what wasteland games are dayz all the way but bringing raiding to fallout marketplace forums is shitty and you know it
---
Just one of those thing where I know it‚Äôs April fools day but don‚Äôt really get it brought up much so I didn‚Äôt even think it was a prank. 
---
Yea, because scrapping all my junk totally fixes the fact that the items are using incorrect textures...
---
Thanks for being an ass for zero reason.
---
excavator is mostly springs if I recall but you may need both
---
Those dragons though...
---
Fallout 3 and New Vegas vets are gonna say attack, Fallout 4 vets are gonna say armor, truth is they are probably about the same in all the games, it's just that in 76 we can become much more powerful, far quicker
---
I just created a bloodied build today and was wandering around whitesprings when I found a glowing deathclaw. I decided to test my new deathclaw gauntlet on him and one shot him. It was disappointing  
---
It's OK, it gave my team something to snicker about while we were nuking the queen the other night.
---
if you already had windmills that would make sense. afaik it drops the highest one you don't have yet
---
Ah! I remember now! When there were 3 guys below level 20 there and a 212 that kept facehugging the queen and dieing?
---
I run ass/sent and I don't jump.
---
Tomorrow‚Äôs update is a patch, mostly for survival, these things come on the 9th.  
---
its a avg weapon dont waste your time.
---
just farm legendarys for better variants not some ass curated weapon :).
---
No lie. When I'm fighting the SBQ and see a high level deathclaw, it's no big deal. When I see a high level Yao Guai, I keep an eye on that thing at all times.
---
It may be different if it was that way from the start, but I think everyone is itching at the chomps to just stir some shit up because of boredom
---
No I got stupid lucky because the next time I did the event I got windmills. Which I was stoked for because the windmill is a great piece to decorate with.
---
-types it in english-
---
Location: your mom's house
---
Cheers, I'll be more mindful next time.  Much obliged.
---
No worries. Usually not a big corrector but I want more harmless B&amp;E in my life
---
Woooo fixing invulnerability at spawns in Survival YAY finally i might try this mode out.. 
---
I was hoping they would add a duplicate machine at Whitesprings. Take one of the ballrooms and turn it into a small market, 25ish stalls that are populated automatically by the vendor machines at each camp.
---
It'd be like most trade shows 
---
I agree but it happens just move on cause nothing will happen to him even witch-hunting him will yield no results 
---
Just read those parch notes for tomorrow and damn I‚Äôm excitedüòÇüòÇüòÇ can‚Äôt wait to see the atom shop lol
---
Sure psn is xSmD_Trance. I'll be on in 5 hours
---
Or we could just camp by whitesprings if we want to vend, with a minimalist camp. I wouldn't put it at my base, I don't want anyone knowing where my supernaweaome spot is. I never get kicked off it.
---
Make a reasonable offer
---
No thanks
---
launch your own
---
Lol no 
---
Sounds like COD Fallout Edition... I want to try it but waiting for some ‚Äúimprovements‚Äù on the mode and I really only want the lever action reward in week 3 I think! 
---
The thing is a love the fallout universe and it's sad to see what they did with this game. It's clearly a cash grab. If they had truly cared about an awesome multiplayer fallout game they wouldn't an released an alpha product. Game was shit at release and still is that good due to the design decisions made
---
I am glad you enjoy it, though.
---
I have more Ultracite then I'll ever need, and with padded armor I can ignore Scorchbeasts entirely. The cost in ammunition to down them (as with many other NPCs) greatly outweighs their loot.
---
I would love a pet scorchbeast.
---
There's a pretty easy for XB1 look up home console game sharing. You get 5 switches and whoever you switch with gets all of your digitally downloaded games. 
---

---
Didnt find the  Civil War Re-enactor corpse  but I found some girl named Kora.
---
Just give us the ability to craft special bolts like explosive bolts (explosive... duh), cryo bolts (slows), pyro bolts (fire damage), Tesla bolts (arcing AoE damage), serrated bolts (for sneak bonus), stabilized bolts (best range), heavy bolts (extra base damage), stim bolts (AoE heal on impact), etc; etc.
---
Give it mods like scopes, an autoloader (rapid fire but less damage, maybe have a unique mini-bolt just for this attachment so balancing bolt effects isn‚Äôt an issue), double/triple/quad shot (shotgun like damage at close range, poor damage but potential to hit groups at longer range). 
---
That way basically every build can have a backup range weapon or you can get some utility effects. The weapon has almost unlimited potential. Crossbows are one of the most multi-purpose weapons in history and the one in game does almost nothing. 
---
They probably needed an interior door with a keypad lock for quest/environment purposes.  And then made it available to us without thinking about it.
---
Might be an unpopular opinion here, but workshops are ok to take over.  Especially the munition factory. They're supposed to be contested, hell, the game even tries to take them from you. Welcome to Appalachia.
---
You may need to take matters into your own hands
---
Would love a game table where you play the various board games with friends as a time passer.  they don‚Äôt have to be hugely fleshed our, just some basic board game fun.  Not asking for catan here.  Maybe a bit of gambling with spare perk cards.
---
Also arcade machines unlocked as you collect holotapes, with high score chasing on the platform, leaderboards, the whole bit.  Build your own nukacade.
---
Robot taming perk allowing you to bring back a mr handy as a butler (Admittedly getting into perk stuff here).
---
More woodwind instruments without a doubt.  Agree that missing a sax with all the great sax solos on the radio is criminal.  There‚Äôs also a mouth harp and a umm hand drum that I‚Äôve seen that should be part of the list.
---
A few more options for the building style beyond the base 5.  Put them up for atoms as long as you add half walls and the like to the base sets.
---
A basketball court themed foundation.  hoops without a court?  Come on!  Maybe do a whole set of sports themes, I‚Äôm sure there are more baseball assets to use from FO4.  Boxing ring is another for sure.
---
Clothable mannequins for those that want to run a clothing store.
---
A big ass radio transmitter so you can make your own radio station with the songs you like.  Butcher Pete 24/7?  Knock yourself out.  Would be a fun mini game to add in all the songs as drops to find, maybe with some new ones too, though I‚Äôd end up with tons of Shenandoah.
---
I could go on and on.  They could likely print money with limited atom shop sales like this, or even make full blown new content that I think a large subset of the players would love. 
---
Anytime lol 
---
It's being hot fixed tomorrow. Look at the top right of your screen when logging in.
---
It's a good idea..... If you were a damn commie /s
---
You need to optimize your build. You can't be great at everything. Do one or two things well. Most QoL stuff should come later--damage first. I will say at lvl 39 you're in a tough spot, but things should get easier when you hit the mid 40's. Now is the time to start focusing your build.
---
I‚Äôm excited to how all of these changes play out.  It was nice to see the roadmap and start planning ahead
---
SAME. Fallout 4's perks were so much simpler and easier to understand. As far as I can tell, barely any of the perks in Fallout 76 even correlates to the S.P.E.C.I.A.L's they fall under. 
---
Lol should have guessed over inflated prices oh well
---
well we crash the server
---
At the moment for some reason people have been buying a lot of those for a lot of caps but I have a few left if u wanna come see my gamertag is my username
---
Hell, they can even tack on a SPECIAL requirement for the passive skills - free "equip" every 5 points or swap cards would be a good starting point.
---
Nah, the new people will leave once they get bored. It really isn‚Äôt that great of a game. The ones who negged my comment are the people who fall into the 3rd category. Ive invested a LOT of time into this game and I don‚Äôt feel like Bethesda put enough time into it at all. I‚Äôm just speaking my mind, buddy boy.
---
oh strange. guess it may be random then.
---
The lag swapping menus is also a bummer.
---
Hah! I don't think that was us... Our queen kept trying to fly away. Luckily she came back but still dropped garbage. Womp womp.
---
A fridge so i can store hard to find food ingredients. Dont even need them in the atom shop there everywhere just let me drag one back to camp and repair it. I mean come on i made a suit of xo1 from desk fans clip boards and old type writers that should be a breeze. 
---
Not me. Addictols are hard to come by and I'm not gonna waste my only one on an alcohol addiction just for the weeklies. 
---
Dude I was farming him earlier and if you try to hold him he dies now. Not sure if that‚Äôs new...
---
Hope you love randomly getting chased across the map with exploding screeches (not saved by the bell), and then other times they chase you for 10 feet and then putter back to their stupid radius.
---
Scorch beasts are a pain, and they always summon 5-10 scorched assholes to come and melee you and drop literally nothing decent. 
---
I would just like multiple areas where they commonly spawn such as implementing new areas like nesting spots and there being a fuckton like the quarry in NV. As well hopefully it wouldn‚Äôt apply to only Deathclaw because I wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing 10+ of a certain high end creatures like Gulpers, Anglers, Yoa Guais and others. 
---
C'est la vie my dude.
---
I was not aware of that, but I don't plan on going back there for a while. 
---
I don't bother with them. The ammo and aid expenditure doesn't warrant the reward. Sure, the XP is nice, but I can get just as much XP doing fast and easy events in the Forest. 
---
If you run a melee build like me, just go find a Brotherhood missile battery in the Bog, get it working, and bait a SB into its effective range. Ezpz.
---
Oh shoot you might be right lol
---
Thanks friend! 
---
Yeah, I did em! I've been real faithful about getting my Biv dailies since Wild Appalachia started so I have almost all the drink recipes. As for the ones I don't have I hooked up with a user on here and we traded for the drinks we couldn't make. The only one I didn't get done is the Survival one because I'm not the least bit interested in that mode.
---
Yes, but I had done the dailies every day they were available, and I'm not sure if I got lucky with having very few repeat dailies. 
---
Yeah it sounds all good and nice. It would be even better if they actually fixed anything. Hope something changes with today's hotfix
---
And if you have a shotgun, enforcer works just as well
---
Geheime Statts Polizei.
---
nice
---
Ah OK :) I only did the quest one time, so was not sure. 
---
Ghouls in the Whitespring clubhouse have Addictol a lot, or you can get a radscorpion egg and make an omelet to cure addiction. Also, an Addictol also sometimes spawns on a chem station in the Enclave medical wing.
---
Fr though, as a shot gun build I just shoot his legs off and then beat it with a sledgehammer while mirelurk queens out here with one piss droplet getting you to critical health.
---
My team was out solving the code 
---
ummm, starship troopers is fascist?  i think not.  you now have robert heinlein turning in his grave.
---
yeah i agree there is a lot broken.  should have been beta still...  or they should be paying us to find thier bugs.
---
i get very frustrated with a lot of things in the game....  oh well.
---
cheers and best luck on your plans.
---
ah yes!  some one who has actually READ Starship Troopers, and what heinlein was trying to get across.  i love the idea of a two-tiered structure of citizenship, being retired military myself. 
---
Our server broke after 5 minutes, when we fought 
---
I'm probably in the minority, but would prefer to actually decrease the opacity of the Power Armor hud.
---
If you're gonna make me look at this, you might as well just go ahead and make it completely opaque.
---
I thought it was a survival mode thing too, but I guess it's something they implimented globally in the last patch.
---
It's not over inflated at all. 5k is worthless
---
Me too. Play with pretty much the same people all the time. Nice finding like minded players.
---
Everytime I‚Äôve seen a mothman, he‚Äôs been super chill and just watched/followed me around. The big cutie. 
---
I‚Äôve seen a ridiculous amount of sky base camps that don‚Äôt have stairs attached to them, or have several flights of stairs going out to a huge platform. People hide up there for PvP. It‚Äôs annoying and cheesy, and we don‚Äôt need more of it.
---
They are shutting down servers tomorrow at 11 est to hot fix this issue. Hopefully you won't have to deal with it much more.
---
I personally love it, I walk in behind the spawn point and shoot the campers in their asses. I'm gonna be sad to see the easy money go
---
Cause of duper‚Äôs and over inflated prices is why you say it is worthless 
---
After you hit a certain point any poor perk choice is irrelevant. It's easy to correct your build, or alter it if you get a cool weapon you want to try out. Once you've hit your stride with a certain build you rack up those levels.
---
how does 1500 caps sound. and can you tell me the resistance numbers please. 
---
if offer not enough just lemme know ill up it for you :).
---
aaaannnnddd 99.99999% of that loot is junk.
---
just shoot the 'B' lol then swap servers and you'll be allgood :).
---
I disagree. If it was a crash grab then why even release updates? That‚Äôs your opinion though so you‚Äôre entitled to it. I personally think when all is said and done it‚Äôs going to be the best fallout game due to the fact that it will get constantly updated. 
---
Could it be non latin script names?
---
Yes, they do. Had a fun encounter at Quarry x3 a while back. Deathclaw vs. Mirelurk Queen vs. Scorchbeast. 
---
I held back but hit each of them once when they all came into play with my hunting rifle (for the XP), then let them fight it out.
---
The SB came in a little later, as it was attracted by the Deathclaw and MLQ fighting. I dispatched the robots early so that they would have a fair fight.
---
Results:
---
The Deathclaw got smoked early by the MLQ. What a joke.
---
As for the MLQ vs. SB, I've seen this fight play out several times. Pre-nerf, the SB wins handily. Post nerf, the SB still wins, but barely. When the SB hits the ground, the MLQ does some serious damage.
---
IMHO, Deathclaws are a joke. With SB's you just have to be prepared to fight them, then they are easy. If you aren't, they are very difficult. MLQ's are a formidable opponent--do not nerf/buff.
---
This isn't duped since I got it as a drop lol and literally one of the top tier items in the entire game. You don't know the market nor the demand of such a god roll. Don't whine just because 5k is not enough to get a high tier item. 
---
It‚Äôs sad day when Yao GAo scarier than a death claw
---
I‚Äôm on now, when is best to find you? I‚Äôd love a gift like that! HeadlessRiver61 is my gamertag. Thanks for the offer. Sure hope you have it still. Monday 4/1 8:20 PST
---
I didn't have this information upfront. I do feel for you were scammed. In the future only trade or do deals with people that you trust, every video games like this real life's like
---
I'll let you know when I get home. But maybe google has them since marine has no tiers and it's standard modded
---
Yeah I know you get the switches, but it should be all members of a family can share from the main parent account.
---
In my case , we have two consoles in the house, but my kids also spend time with their biological father 4 times a year, and they cant access the games down there as we run out of "switches" in the course of a year
---
&gt;Wasteland\_snaps
---
I signed up and followed. Not sure how to send a message. I haven't touched Instagram until now, so I'm clueless. LOL
---
Btw, this was a long time ago, a high level player killing low levels before PvP was a real topic, and proceeded to server follow me to kill me. The factory was unclaimed by them to server hop and kill me.
---
Try the Army of One perk to encourage a landing. 
---
I just fought two scorchbeasts and a big swarm of scorched with a player about half my level. I'm level 113, but not a particularly great build. 
---
It was a good battle. Maybe not great rewards, but it was challenging and entertaining. 
---
Scorchbeasts aren't the only ones that give terrible rewards at present. Went to a Silo, killed a Three Star Glowing Diseased Yao Guai, and recieved a *one-star unyielding* ***boxing glove.*** A boxing glove? Seriously, bethesda? Why are Boxing Gloves and Drills on the Legendary Loot-table?
---
You have to attach Upper Floors to the top of stairs.
---
Scrap the entire perk card system and start over, plz. it's  immersion breaking and boring. It was novel for the first ten minutes then it just got old. "Oh, hey, swap out some cards and you go from a massive badass who can blow someone's brains across the room with a shotgun, to a pack mule".  
---
"oh,  you have a point value now, because balance, we can't have you unlock EVERYTHING". Fine, give us real choices and make us stick to them, like the pre-bethesda fallouts, like 3, like new vegas.  Make \_everyone\_ choose between carry weight and damage, make everyone find a happy middle ground, get rid of this system that lets us min-max for maximum damage builds AND fucking pack mules, which can switch specializations between heavy weapons and fucking unarmed at the drop of a fucking hat.   
---
Or give us the system from 4, where you can unlock \_everything\_ as you level up, because that was fine too.  It'ed work in 76 just as well as it did in 4. 
---
The system, as a whole, is nothing but a frustrating, annoying mess.   
---
Apparently there is a random spawn event slightly down the road, just behind the overturned bus. On my first visit a mothman was waiting there. After a server hop, a monthman was there again. After another server hop, the pied eyebot was there with his mice. After the last server hop, there was nothing.
---
Being a casual weekend player makes it impossible considering I can‚Äôt find the lemonade vendor and get repeat fucking recipes the two days I can play.
---
Or a made hand for the job paint!
---
Nah again like I said just simple over inflation but go on and take advantage it‚Äôs cool what you do it was pretty expected honestly see ya
---
Nah man. Don't know if we're just lucky, but the amount of aid lost seems to at least partly depend on the level of who killed you. We walked away from some fights with 20-50 stims. It's insane.
---
Bought mine at Harpers Ferry about level 130, so no worries about level cap
---
I just picked it up after Googling it and reading this thread but I don't see it as a mod for my Vault Suit at the crafting station. Is there a required perk card or something?
---
I would have never even taken caps for an item but yeah it's cool. Have fun trying to scam someone with 5k.
---
I have an automatic build. Combined with Marsupial whenever they fly low I can jump up to it, VATS lock and empty a clip of 18-20 bullets in it at extremely close range. It usually kills the level 50's and drops the health bar down 3/4 of the higher ones. If they do a second pass it's over for them, if not they're easily picked off with potshots. 
---
already finished, but ive got another chance to do it so add me if you want
---
If you don't mind wearing a dress, the Mistress of Mystery outfit/armor counts as no armour for Chameleon. It's not a good endgame armour, but it got me to level 50 just fine.
---
I've been able to complete it every time it has come up. Seems like you can't kill them with your sneak attack and it will register. I normally go to the rusty pick when I get that one.
---
I'm looking for friends too psn squintmanatee42
---
Yo shut up dude I didn‚Äôt know this yet.
---
Happened on my survival servers quite a lot. Of course, they‚Äôre aimed at random locations (people‚Äôs camps) or WS.
---
Don't underestimate a good pipe rifle. I have just a 1* bloodied one and it can shoot down a Scorched Beast in a single clip.
---
BoS are the best mods for combat armor.
---
My husband and son have been playing 76 for a few months now. I have horrible motion sickness so I wanted to play, but game play made me too dizzy. My husband helped tweak my settings with the mouse settings dropped to the lowest setting plus game play settings and now all 3 of us are able to play together. 
---
It definitely makes it more fun when we can play together.
---
I have so damn many plans stockpiled.
---
Thank you so much!
---
I agree. We've become investors in games, for the possibility of future entertainment, and a finished game, or not, instead of consumers of a finished product.
---
Not only that, in this game, to add insult to injury, they keep throwing little timed treats at us in the form of goodies to be bought with Atoms, with ever increasing costs, with the hope that they'll snag more money from us, under the guise of "free updates/content", meanwhile we're still fighting with content that's been broken since day one. At times it really does feel like a sham. I don't know why I put up with it. There are so many other wonderful games out there that don't treat us like this that I'm putting off playing while I try to play this one. 
---
Replace corvega with vertibird and I'm on board.
---
If you have over max caps it disappears. Made the mistake of givving my friend 18k caps when he had 20k already so we lost 13k...
---
Walk on! I hit level 210 tonight and I haven't fast traveled since level 4. Spend most of my time roaming around the map and the amount of encounters and things that you meet when you walk instead of fast travel is always great. I'm still occasionally finding new things or things that I went by really fast because I was much lower level at the time and forgot were there.
---
It's too good and perfect for my build ;)
---
The behemoth is west of Twin Lakes in a pond. 
---
I would much rather be able to use them as shrapnel in some sort of explosive.
---
You know you can scrap the (non-legendary) armor you get for for extra junk right? Plus chances to learn mods.
---
No problem! It was working better before, at some point. I'd say skip the quest for now, and come back in awhile once they've got it working again, unless you don't encounter the same problems I'm having, in which case, keep at it! 
---
I encountered the Flatwoods monster while chasing one down, I don't think it's coincidental at this point. Good hunting! 
---
Jeez, these 'i can drop one in two shots' snobs are long on brag, short on explanations, and no links to proof. Bottom line: unless you have the proof, there is no such thing as dropping one of these in one or two shots. And YES, we're all tired of expending pounds of lead to get a 1* legendary robot armor leg. Whoever suggested stable flux drops, yeah, that's a great idea.
---
How to get them to land? Do the Rosie quest and craft explosive bait
---
Thanks fellow wastelander I just picked it up
---
I love to just walk around, too. Sometimes I'll pick a direction and just see where things take me. 
---
Harper's Ferry is a pretty decent spot for Legendaries. 
---
That evil machine exists only to reveal my position and alert the Sentinel Assassin scarecrows standing in the field. 
---
Then I‚Äôll be absolutely raped by an absolute barrage of explosive weapons 0.001 seconds later.
---
Don't know how much it affects but it would be pretty viable if it didnt have decrease in daytime
---
So a hotfix should mean a 3 hour outage and 2Gb patch. 
---
Here we go 
---
If you have video evidence of it report it to the mods on the market sub. It won't get you your gun back, but they will ban and blacklist him.
---
Squintmanatee42
---
I was just thinking of something like this about 40 minutes while taking cover behind a Zip. 
---
Instead of a fast travel feature where the car is the object to use. It‚Äôs more a buff to fast travel. 
---
Make a dlc or event: A Sunday Joy Ride. 
---
You find a car you like (being any car that can destroyed). Select it and you ‚Äúscan‚Äù it for you camp. After building a hard to make Restoration Kit and a Garage Repair Station. You can then start working on your car/truck. Repair the frame, seats so on so forth. Each core component requiring more harder items to build and make.  (similar to your idea). Once the car is restored the car grants a buff reducing the cost to travel away from your camp. 
---
This make increasing the cost to fast travel more as now it‚Äôs not really that difficult to manage. Each type of car reduces the cost. And you can only have one project at a time. 
---
This also gives the devs a reason to re work Travel Agent perk. Which is sorely needed. 
---
Maybe for the first 20 levels or something but it'd be SO annoying to have to walk everywhere. I often have limited time to play, and if I had to spend 10 minutes walking each time I played I'd probably be pretty unhappy if I were working on a specific quest. Plus it'd make events nearly impossible unless you were right there when it started. 
---
 I'd love if train stations were cheaper, though, it'd give incentive to hoof it to a station when time allowed. 
---
Yes, that simple addition would be great.
---
It's kind of random when he dies. The first time I was holding him for my friend the bot died before he could log into my server. The other night we were able to re-log for a solid hour or so. 
---
It would make since for one of the "best and brightest minds" to be able to refurbish and trick out a old car. (Lore wise) 
---
But hell, why not just have both? 
---
Just cause. 
---
That may be a bit past the awesome thresholds for Bethesda. 
---
Maybe not. 
---
This is depressing
---
but why atom store tho. in game would be nice
---
I wish I could upvote this a 1000000000 times. 
---
Do you think the High Level Dungeons will also be out then? :)
---
Agreed! Just thought I would comment in case you weren't aware.
---
That would require a 20Gb patch.
---
Logged in this morning only to have the SBQ event going. High-tailed it down there and broke a couple of weapons, armor, and ran out of ammo. Killed queen then went back to camp and quickly ran out of scrap. Looked at my trusty Tambo and said "it's just you and me now!" Headed out into the forest to search all of the locations I missed. Came home with tons of scrap and plans, as well a complete lvl 50 suit of T-51b PA.
---
While people talk about hitting the hot spots for loot, I find so much more loot just by randomly exploring. I was in Toxic Valley a while back and found 5 new plans in 15 minutes of random exploration.
---
TL;DR: When I'm searching for something, I never find it. When I don't, it rains goodies.
---
By accident, yes. Better run.
---
Well they already have the code done for the birds. We could use them in fallout 4. I just say that over a car because you could land the birds nearly anywhere.
---
Wow you are being incredibly defensive over something really not that big of a deal.
---
I agreed with you that the system is currently broken.
---
I never said bad things that happen as a result of the broken system are your fault, only that players have a choice to stay where the griefers are to finish something, or to leave the server and just restart the quest if that's what happens.
---
It is the players CHOICE to stay online or log off when griefed......period.  That isn't flawed logic it's a simple fact.
---
Players shouldnt have to make that choice, the griefers make the game less fun, but it is still a choice.  Just like playing the game or responding to you is a choice.
---
Your example which is way out in left field is in no way the same thing, there is no do this or your life ends scenario in a game.....its a game not real life.
---
With that said, if someone does pull a gun on you and says give me your money or I kill you......the person still has a CHOICE.  Give up money or get shot.  It is not a fair choice but it is most definitely a choice......and that person is not at fault because someone pulled a gun on them.
---
For reference, and I have no idea how you arrived at this assumption, I never said it was the person who is being griefed who is at fault for ANYTHING, they are simply a victim of a crappy system with poor pvp implementation.  Also you quickness to fly off the handle us the exact behavior that greifers are looking for....they want people like you who get upset over the game.....because they are aholes and that's what they do......dont get so upset and defensive so easily and that might help a bit as well.
---
Nice! I love seeing other's builds. 
---
People say it ticks from 6 to 6 and I believe it‚Äôs in game time.  Whatever it shows is the damage at that exact moment. It changes live in your pip day and night. The swing is pretty significant though which sucks.
---
I didn't mean to snoop, but I checked your post history just to see what was up. If don't get your Harpoon back I have a 3* that I've been looking for a home for. I'll gladly give to you. Nobody seems to want to buy it and I want to see it go to someone that'll appreciate it .
---
To make u feel better their loot is mehhh
---
I would love too but I barely even have 400 caps
---
I love that fireplace. 
---
Yeah, no atom shop things buildable in other's camps. Kinda sad. 
---
Unknown! There is ideas about this quest will lead us to vault 51 - the new one that poped up recently in the far upper left forest! I'm hopeful! If not, then it's for sure happening in the raids whenever they do those!
---
From 6 PM to 6 AM the gun is about 250% stronger. Just be sure to switch to a non-nocturnal gun for daylight
---
I have a small collection! I need to get more myself, but then again I could visit shops like yours!!
---
I have 200 hours in this game and have never ever come across mothman I literally don‚Äôt get it. And I wish I was lying right now, truth is I‚Äôm not and I‚Äôd really like to see him for my first time.
---
All plans, does that include the atomic shop ones?
---
I have some Fasnacht plans and masks.  Look me up and we can do some trading.  My current camp is right next to the Sutton station.  Do you happen to have the metal building plans?  I am Mad88gamer.
---
Yippee, 5Gb more....
---
I'm at level 86 and that would be a hair raising experience for sure.
---
The first time I saw a nuke go off I watched it from a cliff just outside the blast zone, then decided to go in. And I immediately died to 3 glowing charred feral ghouls.
---
The blast zone is no place for a level 30 casual gamer...
---
Here we go what? This OP god armor that not even a VATS Critical attack can break through? Oh wait...
---
I'm terrible about crafting anything. No clue what any of those drinks do other than nukashine. I pick up enough booze in the wasteland anyway. 
---
after fighting SB I am not longer afraid of deathclaws.
---
Try shutting down and restarting, and taking the required mats out of your stash and keep them on your character when attempting to do it.
---
You almost got me.
---
omg who the hell cares
---
Absolutely. I'd say it's necessary, otherwise the scorched like to spawn up top next to the undefended lead extractor.
---
I'm only 63 and u wasn't wearing power armor. Aside from the jump scare of my life. The death law took out one of the yao gui and I split one off a lil pumped him with a shotgun then dealt with the rest after. Nice loot 
---
I tried it last night and again today, but I'll also try taking the mats out. Thanks!
---
Thx!
---
I've honestly stopped picking locks and terminals above level 0 because it's a pain to switch
---
I only need reviving 20 players. I solo, and nobody seems to wait around long enough for me to go stimpak them.
---
In fallout 3 &gt;!everyone in the simulation pod were playing as kids and they thought they were kids, so it is possible in the fallout universe to be in a simulation and think you're something else (protagonist's dad was a dog and he thought he was a dog)!&lt;
---
I want it now lol
---
The Mirelurk kings spam you with their sonic attack.
---
What system do you play on? If ps4 I can help you tomorrow when I get out of school 
---
Rip haha I'm still new to reddit
---
Thank you for the offer, but I won't be able to get on again until the weekend
---
What‚Äôs your psn and I can help you this weekend 
---
You only need the launch card. Do not mess with the code or you'll need another  card
---
Hmm - I wonder if this is what happened for me - I completed the quest with a team - I guy - and I swear I don‚Äôt recall dropping or selling a PA chassis after ... maybe he got the PA?  For those that didn‚Äôt get it you can pull the schematics from taggertys computer after the quest is complete and build a set your self - takes 60 or so ultracite I think to build it ... 
---
Fallout 3 made them a joke once you got that dart gun
---
Huh?
---
Someone nuked the area just north of Harpers Ferry for some reason...  dont do that. 
---
Wdym not to be wrong
---
If you keep bringing it up you are ignoring what people are telling you about how vendors work
---
Throw me a frickin bone here
---
I like your ideal better. 
---
Enclave officers uniform
---
What level did you buy your mask at? I'm 53 now, but it never seems to spawn in the vendor. None of the urban scout does, now that I think about it...
---
The release was a cash grab. They could have waited.
---
Theyre a little bit away from where you go into the silos themselves, can be a pain to find
---
The Fallout 76 Home Owners Association DLC?
---
You use the raider underarmor types.
---
Give people time to figure out the codes.  Early in the week is always slower for nuke zones.
---
U mean skyrim dragon ? :D
---
I did it. It twitched a little and then nothing 
---
I one-shot everyone with mine.
---
Counter?
---
Haha nope
---
My wife and I bought a second ps4 and a new 55‚Äù tv so we could play together. Been playing since launch and enjoying it most of the time. We each have mules for the others acct.
---
I agree they definitely should have delayed the game but they didn‚Äôt. If they had given up on it and not worked diligently to fix the bugs and add new content I wouldn‚Äôt have made this post. I‚Äôm going to look to the future because I love fallout and this one has a chance to be great. The foundation is there but now it‚Äôs just needs more content.
---
At least those fuckers ***LAND!***
---
So testing out in PvP , its pretty damn good lol
---
Are those codes for ps4 too?
---
One second the bullets are going right in the middle of of the screen where the cross hairs are, the next there shooting 5 ft above his head when I never moved my joysitck up? It's not the first time just recorded it cause it didn't feel right. It will happen all the time when launching a Nuke and u have to destroy the mainframe cores, so I will pull out my explding Gatling gun. If I start aiming and aim down, the crosshair will aim down but the game still shoots where the cross hairs rest.
---
Unless they change their minds, the dungeons should be part of Wild Apallachia since they were part of the trailer and later on confirmed during PAX ;)
---
Yeah managed to finish it - I didnt have the Bellini or Mimosa recipes, and managed to swap those for ones I could make
---
I am still chasing the Nuka Dark recipe - I swear Biv is holding out on me
---
I feel like after beach boys being brought in that they can have a little creative freedom with some of the music. Maybe like punk was a very underground scene. Or invented by the first raiders who went to anarchistic ways.
---
Check out the  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/) real nice group of players always willing to help each other out
---
Mine simply says that the name must only have letters,numbers and spaces. I‚Äôm meeting all the criteria but it‚Äôs not letting me progress past this. I‚Äôve tried restarting the game but still nothing. Any advice?
---
No, I can‚Äôt put down atom shop plans for other people, you have to own them yourself... 
---
I am missing like a magazine rack and one variant of a desk haha 
---
I was doing the event yesterday in the Ash Heap region and he got stuck in a fashion that I found quite humorous (for a change).
---
There was a shallow pit of burning coal along the route he chose; needless to say he got stuck in it and as he was rethinking his pathing he burnt all the way to the 'arrested' state.
---
After this he would not stop burning so as soon as this health regen kicked in he would stand up, quickly deplete the sliver of health and go into arrested state again.
---
This by itself is not that humorous, more so considering that it screwed up the quest progress, again, but so it happens that four nihilistic possums would constantly respawn nearby and immediately rush to the pit in question to get blown up.
---
The scene was so surreal that it almost made up for the frustration of failing this due to environmental factors once again.
---
Yes, the drop rate for armor is really high. And melee weapons too
---
lol
---
Maybe - but seriously I find cool caravans throughout the game - looking at Morgantown airport and the sort of "plastic" look modern one in there - and wish we had more modular homes that could be built
---
I launch almost every time I get to play for more than an hour. Like today I did Charleston just to do it.
---
Not even sure how the levels 2-15 could even stay alive in the event. 
---
I need that one, kill 20 players and hack terminals.
---
I want those pre-fab pod homes. I guess both the trailers and those big, green glass ones.
---
Shouldn't an anti armor heavy gun+ stabilized rank 3 + Power armor = damage to assassin's sentinel? I think aa is broken in survival
---
You can also sell your armor on Reddit or in game. 
---
I don't feel like I've ever learned a mod from scrapping armor, could be wrong I just don't recall. Is there a perk that would make this more regular?
---
Are you on pc by any chance? I'd buy couple pieces of liqor off you, still need to imbibe 2-3 unique ones for that weekly challenge and the time's running out -(
---
Lost one recently because 4 people decided to hide in the bunker and trade ,...thx for wasting everyone bullets...turds
---
Yes! They would be so awesome. I dont mind them having a higher build cost if certain furniture (like a bed) was integrated into the construction, or even give it an upgrade path to add modular furniture to it
---
My bad, I missed your reply. I'll be tomorrow night ~9pm est, I'll send you a discord link tomorrow
---
There's no perk that'll help you out, but I've learned mods from scraping armor before. It's a lot more rare than gun mods, probably because there's very few armor mods comparatively.
---
If you're on PC, try  the Perk Loadout Manger mod: [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124) 
---
Makes switching cards so much easier.
---
(For anyone unwilling to click, it lets you set up perk card sets and switch between them with 1 through 0 while on the perk screen)
---
I went in one earlier today, they are kinda small though. But they would be the ultimate in any conception of the ‚Äúmicro camps‚Äù like if they allowed us to have a home base and a portable CAMP with like 10% of the budget.
---
Its funny you should mention starship troopers cus I also made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b8a698/this_little_battle_reminded_me_of_starship/) about the time you made this comment
---
You still got serums receipes left?
---
Earth Marge approves 
---
Yeah very small - but if they gave us a series of these modules that we could clip together it would be very cool.
---
Different pieces that had different purposes
---
Can‚Äôt name character, any advice on how to progress
---
Why not?

---
So exactly how inconsistant are the dataminers?
---
Cause the vault now has a big 51 on it
---
Mostly yeah. Also depends on what you plan to do and what perks you have 
---
yes dunno dunno no no yes yes yes. Think I got the order right.
---
Sorry, Xbox.  Man cross platform play really would be great wouldn‚Äôt it?
---
I'm ready to name my power armors. I hate having to guess which chassis is what I want.
---
I absolutely agree on loosening the restrictive placement of things, ive asked about this since the beta, seems silly to me that people can build the "1 foundation monstrosities" but I can't have a wall not snapped to a foundation, or remove a stair case, or make a fence out of the balcony railing pieces and on and on and on
---
You can buy mods, but they are random and somewhat rare. The best sniper rifle in the game (imo) is the lever action rifle. There is no legendary power armor. You can get Raider PA for free from Rose's quest and the Ultracite for free from the BoS quest. You get plans to craft the X-01 and Excavator through quests. Everything else you need craft or collect from power armor spawns throughout the world. You can buy mod plans for them, or find them and yes you apply them at a power armor station.
---
As someone who plays a bloodied build, I have the luxury of using the ONLY usuable XBOW....and let me tell you...it is fun as hell.  I use it more than any other weapon and I love the fact you can loot y our bolts back from corpses.  It one shots 99% of mobs.  
---
It would be nice for it to have some mods so others can enjoy it as well.
---
Most of them stay as far back as possible
---
Holy crap you answered all of my questions in less that 15 words. I'm super impressed lol
---
Thanks for the offer for sure, I did get it back from him after he saw this post lol I'll link vids.
---
What are effects I might want to buy
---
I was playing and tried to target players and couldn‚Äôt then realized I had pacifist on. Not sure if the was for an event or a bug. 
---
I have some insight on this as once upon a time I had a 3\* Nocturnal Hunting Rifle. Now my assumption was that it was following werewolf rules: normal damage during the day and then it becomes a badass at night. But I was wrong.
---
The nocturnal effect waxes and wanes so that at exactly 6 am and 6 pm the gun does normal damage. Then at night it slowly increases in damage does about double damage or so at it's apex. But then it wanes away until it does about 2/3-3/4 of its damage during the day. And really didn't like that so I traded it in for an instigating sniper rifle and I'm so much happier now.
---
Yes, it is dead silent.
---
I could see a system where your character comprises several "decks" or loadouts simultaneously. Basically, you'd have SPECIAL stat points like we do currently, and then different types of perks are tracked separately.
---
**Example**  
---
Instead of just "perks", you'd have...
---
* Combat perks;  
---
* Crafting perks; and  
---
* Survival perks.
---
So let's say you have 6 points in Agility, that would mean you can assign 6 points worth of combat perks AND 6 points worth of crafting perks AND 6 points worth of survival perks. To balance this, they'd have to add WAY more perks and make them more diverse, AND they'd have to adjust how many points each perk is worth. 
---
Much more complex, sure, but I think if you tiered the system this way it'd help each character feel really unique, do away with the mildly annoying perk swap we have right now, and it would allow for much more fiddly loadout design.
---
That was my mistake because vault 65 has a  entire interior cell built while the only item at all in the files is the vault door for vault 51 and I thought the door referenced the interior cell. Vault 65 has no exterior door at all though. I must have missed this one when I corrected myself on the other one. There's also a vault 49 referenced once in the files but no other info on that either. 
---
Plus, what mod you learn is also random. So it‚Äôs entirely possible to learn half a dozen receiver mods before learning a single magazine mod
---
I don't love the level action, I guess I was angling more towards like hunting sniper vs recon kinda thing, bearing in mind that I tend to snipe from a medium to long distance 
---
I killed 7 legendaries. Each one gave me wood armor. I'm not Harold.
---
Hahaha yeah. 
---
He is not the strongest super mutant 
---
Reasons to pick pistol over rifle.
---
#1. They look cool.
---
#2. RPing a gunslinger
---
#3. Found a pistol with good legendary rolls.
---
Updoot for love

It be nice to frame them in camp

Stable flux would be a justified drop

It's gotten alot better, but there's still some glitches to be ironed out for sure. This game feels alot emptier and lonely than FO4, and unless you listen to all the holotapes you won't have any sense of direction or accomplishment for completing quests. It's a very fun game though with plenty to see and do.
---
You've most likely run past him without realizing it. He tends to randomly spawn a good distance out and "watch" you. So it is quite easy to not be aware he is around as most of the time he will not attack you but flee.
---
Is there a higher chance of it landing if you ignore it?
---
I feel like the enemies aren‚Äôt free to roam around enough. Be cool if the hordes weren‚Äôt contained to one spot. I remember Pete Hines saying things wouldn‚Äôt follow and be hunting you down and I thought why not. In moderation and certain enemy types it might be kinda fun. 
---
Any word of players being unbanned? Or as to why they were rebanned? A lot of people are just wanting a bit of clarification as to what happened. 
---
yeah the whole no npc's thing was a big con for me, but hopefully the story is engaging enough to keep my attention. 
---
I stopped because going because seeing a dead Murgle was too heartbreaking for me.
---
As far as damage is concerned the lever action will outclass a hunting rifle, but a good legendary hunting rifle is nothing broken scoff at. What rifle you'll be using will more depend on what the RNG gives you, or what you can buy from other players .
---
I loaded points into pistols and the pipe weapon perks. At lvl45 I still use my non legendary pipe revolver as my main. It does 110+ damage for one of the cheapest repairs, ammo, and weights available. 
---
Awesome thanks for the tips. So turrets in the cave only. Gotcha! :)
---
? isnt that the t51 nuka cola paint
---
it was already here
---
there‚Äôs this guys post [make lots of ammo](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ajozdp/guide_to_making_lots_of_ammo_the_survivalists_way/) about a single location that nets you hundreds of steel and lead in lime 5 minutes. it will set you up for gauss ammo
---
Personally I find the main quest dull and lackluster, but I've always felt that about all of Bethesda's games. They make beautiful interesting worlds, and this one is of the more diverse areas to explore. Every biosphere feels different and compelling to explore.
---
If you liked Fallout 4 you should like Fallout 76. Besides the no NPCs/no companions I think the biggest thing to get used to is not being able to keep all the things. You have to be a lot more discriminatory about what you save, keep, scrap and haul and that takes some getting used to.
---
But a quick note on the timing: There's an update scheduled for tomorrow am so I'd probably hold off until tomorrow to get started.
---
&gt;we‚Äôre planning to bring Fallout 76 offline across all platforms to perform maintenance and apply a hotfix
---
I super appreciate their responsiveness, but god *damn* they need to either stop calling them hotfixes if they have to take the servers offline OR upgrade their tech stack to where they actually *can* perform real, no downtime required hotfixes.
---
It's Bloodied, Bash damage and +1 Agility. It's scoped, and I **might** be able to add the flechette mod, I need to check my stash to see if I still have it.
---
Yeah, that'd be awesome...
---
I'm pretty sure the vendor just doesn't sell that dumb coat for me. Found him many times, but he's never had the coat. Got a clean spacesuit, at least. 
---
good advice,  i probably wouldn't get a chance to play today anyways as im yet to install
---
I appreciate the offer I'm just not set up for bloodied effects. Hold onto it till player vender later this week and you will get a sale on it there
---
I thought 3 was the t51 nuka paint
---
That's the door for X-01 Nuka Cola Quantum Paint. Was big about a week and a half ago. 
---
I've run into them pretty much in every corner of the map. Seems like they generally spawn more on the western side of the map, and the alien spawns more on the eastern...wonder if they have some territorial beef goin on
---
Wow that is such an amazing camp. Well done! Thanks for sharing. 
---
Question, was it hard to not go over budget? Do you have any other defence? 
---
Nope... Mothman needs to die!   He keeps dropping a load in my razor grain fields!   I kill him quick... but... he does have the last laugh.     Right after he dies he leaves me one last steaming pile.
---
Damn you mothman! Damn you!
---
As a side note, he really does pop by my base on a weekly basis.   No idea why so often I am just lucky like that.
---
Would be sick if we could use their bones &amp; hide to craft scorchbeast armor. Yeah it‚Äôs very Skyrim, but at least they would be worth the effort. 
---
I enter college in a year, going to take English /creative writing. In this game I met a creative writing professor who is friends with my favorite author. Talk about nearly fainting when I found out. 
---
Hell I‚Äôd be happy with sort by weight to actually sort by the **stack** rather than the *item*
---
**ELMER SEASON**
---
Yes! I need my main camp, but I want small little one time camps or something for exactly what your talking about lol
---
I have never used the nocturnal weapons ever, as they sound way too sketchy and chance based for me.
---
I loved my pipe revolver - such a solid gun.
---
Was still using it up until I finally got a good .44 legendary (around lvl 80)
---
I'm pretty sure that I killed stalking and vengeful mothmen. Pretty tough at the time.
---
But what about armor 
---
I have one sitting in my junk for the time when I can either display it or wear it.
---
Are you on PS4? I had a lot of disconnects tonight
---
Pipe Revolver all the way - solid gun that feels nice to use.
---
For me I use pistols for most things - and when things get really hairy I switch over to shotguns and cripple my foes, then switch but to finish them off
---
I got attached by a Mothman AND the Flatwoods monster at the same time. Yeesh.
---
It does more damage than the .44 or single action, they way I'm specced. I found a quad ammo single action, and that's the only other pistol I use because it's hilarious to have 24 rounds in a revolver
---
That is awesome.
---
I wish I could get a legendary pipe revolver - but I have never seen any drop
---
NO ONE nukes the queen anymore. I still see Whitesprings nukes pretty frequently though.
---
As do I.
---
I haven't either, it's a weird oversight considering it's one of the more normal weapons.
---
Chinese bot farmers are making their way to FO76 it seems
---
Cool cool. Happy you got your weapon back! Cheers!
---
Nice! Most important detail though.. what‚Äôs the closest fast travel spot to it &gt;:)
---
While this would be an improvement, and there are already mods for his on PC, why even go through the hassle of flipping between presets?  
---
If the game is going to make it easy to switch perks just make non combat perks passive so there's no need.  The game is not made better by swapping out perks regardless of how easy it is.
---
Target sighted. Mission accepted. Goal. That grain. 
---
Love the build. And thanks for the idea. Wish it would work for my location. But alas the Damm node extractor is in the way. Oh well back to the drawing board. 
---
Stay safe in the wastes.
---
You‚Äôre in the minority with that opinion. 
---
I watched my Mega Sloth get killed as I ran back to my home... I hunted that fucker down.
---
There's a difference between chance to hit and shots going astray. When you're aiming dead on something and shoot, the shot shouldn't veer off so drastically to the left or right, or even the ceiling. The fact this is happening to multie people means somethig in the aimk g mechanics is messed up. That many people can't be having the same issue and all have that bad of a chance to hit.
---
We kite adds to low levels doing nothing. I wish the person that launched a nuke could be an event leader and flag unwelcome guests for pvp to solve this. Or a new Brotherhood wall where you need to get a keycard to pass at a minimum required level. 
---
I feel you. They've been shady with patch notes from day one.
---
I love getting non-legendary armor* because even at level 170, there are still a lot of armor mods I don't know
---
*except wood. Mostly because I can't craft it.
---
I saw it for 3rd time on my crossbow character. AFTER I killed the molerats that attacked me. 
---
No, I think the only thing counting as defense right now is the spotlight and the locks. oh and the one door with the board and spikes. It has had defenses here and there. Like before I unlocked the porta-potty and made that area.
---
I do find it difficult staying under budget as I've gotten used to the large work area in fo4. I wish I could set up defenses but I need every last bit off my budget to decorate. I also had found room for a brahmin wheelbarrow but that sas taking up way to much budget so I had to say goodbye.
---
This needs more attention. Along with all the suggestions. Bring on the old weapons from NV.
---
Nuking used to be my go-to time killer when I didn't know what else to do.  Fascnacht broke that rhythm by being a fun and novel alternative.  Now that it's done, I'm kinda in limbo.  Nuking lost its fun, I'm mostly just logging in to do Biv's quests and my daily vendor run until new content drops.
---
I would give my first born to BGS for this.
---
Yeah but wasn‚Äôt the hotter hot rod
---
I would say both. Add little more armor and health to limbs and double the damage they do.
---
Crippling them is too easy now.
---
I really think the game should allow you two camps‚Äîone more of a settlement or homestead, with a big budget and corresponding higher cost to move; basically the current camp system. The other is a much smaller budget, but practically free to move. 
---
Stuck at 23/25 also. I'd be at 24, if those stupid corpse blossoms weren't next to impossible to get.
---
It'd be nice if they were modable too.  Recon binoculars would come in handy, not just tactically but also for those missions that require a recon scope.
---
Ummm.   I know it‚Äôs hard to pick us out when we‚Äôre here, but I‚Äôve been FC for months.  lol. 
---
But thanks. :). FC is my life.   I get to play about 10 hours a week.  
---
I love the game, but that don‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt be a bit bitchy about dailies, where I get RNG repeat rewards.  
---
Take today.  I spent 3 hours walking RNG locations to hit Graham twice.  I‚Äôve run into him like 20 times.  Never seen the merchant bot or lemonade vendor once.  Even had another FC trying it with me.  No love.  150+ levels between two toons and neither of them.  
---
And Biv needs to stop giving me the same damn rewards then making me wait 24 hours to get the same shit again.  
---
But I‚Äôll do my Pinky and the Brain repeat next week...because being irked is just another part of the game I enjoy.
---
That's the handmade!
---
The Gladiator Perks work for all the 'unarmed' melee weapons.  DC Gauntlet, Power Fist, Death Tambo, Meat Hook etc.  Even without Iron Fist, all 4 I mentioned do slightly more or close to base dmg and dps than the best 1 handed, which IMO is the ski sword or maybe combat knife.   I don't really think it's a glitch to be able to use Iron Fist and Gladiator as you can't use JUST Iron Fist and get the same results.  Unarmed attacks are as risky as it gets and the added bonus of Iron Fist is the reward.  Also, maxing out all 3 Gladiator and Iron Fist is 12 points, leaving only 3 max for Incisor, Martial Artist, Blocker and any other valuable strength perks.  
---
Very Nice unded, how did you do the counter?
---
Sometimes I fall from cliffs making a bit of poor judgment
---
Would explain my affection for it....ü§î
---
You don't get much more powerful after 100, so it should probably have a cap
---
oops lol
---
Yeah I know what you mean - the number of times Biv has failed to give me a new recipe is infuriating.
---
My other joy is the technical data I turn in for the BOS - that is so soul crushing every day to never see a new paint plan 
---
They entered the chamber as adults already
---
Personally they're fun. I make a few Glassed Cavern runs a week and kill several Scorchbeasts. About 3-6 at minimum. Overdrive and the new Ballistic Bock are great. I also got my 3rd Ultracite Gatling Laser a week ago. 
---
PS: Are you on XBox? If so and I grab any plans you need I can always pass them onto you
---
1.) The best way to learn all the things is to scrap all the things. I've bought plans for hundreds or thousands of caps just to make guns strictly to be scrapped. It's how I got most of the mods for my lever rifle and my gauss. Yes you can buy and find plans and mods for the rifles depending on the vendor. Best to just take a day or two to build a bunch of rifles and scrap them until you learn the mods you want.
---
2.) I like the hunting rifle and the lever rifle. I work with both depending on the situation. The instigating hunting rifle can one shot just about any humanoid in the game but it's too slow and awkward to be used on anything after I've got their attention so I use my anti-armor lever rifle on anything in the middle distance especially if there's more than one and that'll take anything out in 2-3 shots. The Gauss rifle is a tempting addition to your arsenal as it does the most damage but it's slow to reload and useless in VATS.
---
3.) There is not any legendary power armor to my knowledge but that's ok you can only apply one mod per piece and the mods are pretty sweet. You can't learn them by scrapping like you can the armor and weapons so you have to either buy the plans and mods from vendors, be awarded them for quests or find plans or mods randomly in the world. Some power armor has to be crafted (excavator) and some is awarded at the end of faction quests (ultracite) but others (raider and T series) are found in the wild. At first it's pretty uncommon to run into power armor but then it's pretty common. As far as stats it just kind of depends what you want. Excavator has the least protection but its carry weight can't be beat. X01 looks great but you can't get mod plans for it and only one vendor sells a handful of mods at a time. T-series is extremely versatile and offers the best mix of damage resistances. Also the plans and mods are fairly common, if expensive.
---
I would love it if you could put protections or sentry bots around your camp instant of turrets. 
---
I've been wanting to plant pumpkins since I first saw one at launch
---
Like a robot workbench
---
I remember the days in other fallout games where I'd stop in my tracks and sneak suddenly hoping a Deathclaw didn't see me. Sure, I could probably best it, but it was going to be iffy. 
---
Now? I see a Deathclaw? I'm running at it full tilt. I'm not even running a super optimized build.
---
PC dude, but thanks. :).  I will find that bastard lemonade jerk at some point and get my recipes.  
---
It took me over a month to get the caps for letters, so this is just another end game goal I have.
---
The new update that hasn't been updated yet?
---
Whatever choice you make, commit to it and don't mix and match
---
I don't believe it should cost caps to move.. but I'd be ok if it required materials to place each time..
---
Binoculars do 11 bash damage and are effected by the basher perk. Maybe they should give you bonus damage with the survivalist perk and add more perks and mods for it so I can finally get the binocular build into the meta. Will pay caps for two shot explosive binoculars. 
---
Marine, combat, and metal can outclass pa on dr with the right perks and mods
---
I bought my husband a gaming laptop so we could do this. He travels a lot for work, so it's nice to be able to chat and play almost like he's home.
---
I keep finding mutants and mole rats in my house smashing everything. How did they get past my defences and through all my locked doors? There was no exterior damage. Like they spawned right in my building. Lol.
---
Yeah, I was a bit worried about having to adjust my build after the first 40 levels. Then as I started honing my current build's perks, like you said, I just hit my stride and leveling comes quickly and easily. 
---
Yes, and you can add skins on them, like the brown one from fallout 4 or the whitesprings or whitesprings bunker.
---
It‚Äôs absurd there‚Äôs not a hypersonic grenade or something the enclave could have, just something the scorchbeast would dive on because it‚Äôs a bat and the grenade is audio based or whatever
---
I've never seen it not at the Harper's Ferry vendor since the patch.
---
As others have said, it's early in the week. Sunday night a group nuked the Whitespring three times in about 20 minutes. There were legendaries *everywhere*.
---
Unless running mods or specific settings you don't need custom. Ini
---
lol pre-bethesda fallouts like 3
---
I bought second PS4 day after release day, i was already 35level. My GF is not much interested in fallout, but with survival, she enjoy murdering people. She hunts even lowbies. That happines in her eyes when he slain 11lvl is so priceless. (she is 72lvl now with explosive handmade)
---
I hope they ban you for being a rat. 
---

---
Got Knight today.  I was overjoyed.
---
I know that feeling - got Knight as well yesterday after a month of submitting one or month docs each day
---
Nice idea
---
You won't get banned. You discovered it, figured out how it works, reported it and didn't share how to do it. You basically did everything they want you to do. They only handed out the ban hammer to dupers that had produced obscene amounts of multiple types Ultracite ammo in less then 30 days.
---
I'm not sure if there is a higher chance of it landing, but between the shelter offered by the cave and the resistance afforded by the perks/torso mod, I'm able to ignore it indefinitely. Usually I'm there long enough for it to land, but if I'm not it's not a big deal and I just come and go as I normally would otherwise.
---
Same here. I did get the fishermans outfit.. but but its fugly
---
All I ask for is clean walls.
---
Have you tried different terminals? They have different inventories. For instance, the terminals in the production facility sell different stuff than the once in the medical wing. Can't really remember exactly where I bought it, but it should be there somewhere. 
---
I like survival mode. I use the extra exp bonus to do my quests and events. I dont care if i get griefed. Its part of the game.
---
While leveling up its generally cheaper to craft new armor than repair it with ballistic fiber which you‚Äôll be needing for repairs later on. 
---
This escalated quickly ...
---
They've already become legacy weapons (no more drops in-game).  All explosive energy weapons, I believe.
---
I‚Äôm talking about the red one
---
So instead of repairing i should just make new marine armor and such? I figured itd be cheaper.

Sidetrack but I like the idea of player factions and quickly can we get fences that connect 2 posts no matter what like you build a post then as long as its in the same chain of fence the next post will connect to the old fence a good example of this is like the tethers in Astroneer if you know it
---
That ain‚Äôt no joke. 
---
I've noticed that anything that can be pushed or kicked around is strictly in your game only (other players just see you, not the item) which suggests it's client side only probably for that very reason.

Military checkpoints and vendors will often sell bulked of it.

Well no camps at overseers camp either please nor at the dried up lake. Nor by half a dozen other places.

As the Wastelands second tier apex predator they need to be scarier and also prevalent IMO. The only one I consistently run into is that one in the cave in the Savage Divide. Also like with any Scorch Beast they need better loot too.

Short stairs and stairs that can be built directly on top of foundations as a 1x1 block (like concrete stairs, but hopefully prettier)
---
Marine? What level are you? As others have suggested until you start using legendary armor you're better off just crafting new armor, or getting new pieces you get from events and whatnot.
---
Can you help me I‚Äôm on rn?

I tamed a mirelurk king - my god it makes a ridiculous amount of noise "screaming" all the time in camp
---
Why haven‚Äôt the banned people like this? The most simple answer is most likely the right one, they don‚Äôt care. 
---
Honestly I‚Äôm fine with that, if they change the trade system slightly to permit direct item for item trade that would be perfect prevention right there.
---
it's more rare compared to weapons, but it does work. That's how I learned all my leather armor mods. I crafted level 1 versions, then scrapped them again.

Meh i think itll be about the same.

A 1 star turd is still a 1 star turd.

I like to leave lvl 5-15 stuff at overseers camp. As well as ammo food and water.  And my base is super close anyhows (camping them stupid spawn spots)

Charleston is mid levels who mostly need ammo and stimpacks. I drop 10 stims at a time with what ever ammo i have (melee build) so i always have something to drop.

Whitesprings station is kinda dead right now. Least for me.. unless its nuked.

Nerf it!!! Nerf AA too! Too OP!

Oh I thought you meant lower level like leather armor and stuff. I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs required to make/repair marine armor. Camp McClintock is where I go when I need ballistic fiber though

Everything has its use. Everything. Scrap weapons, cook or eat anything organic and if you have a surplus of junk there is mostly some way of using it to craft stuff which gives XP and an item. Stop when it's not fun.

I play a full-health slugger build with power armor.  Still 2-3 hits if I can engage with a sprinting power attack.  Maybe 4 if I swing too soon or otherwise fail the power attack.  An anti-armor super sledge power attack will take off at least 75% health on a lvl 91 glowing deathclaw with full slugger perks and glow sight.
---
I need animals for meat too. 
---
White knight doesn‚Äôt apply to power armor and I‚Äôm not sure about lucky break. To be honest though all you need is the perk to repair your power armor to 200%. I put on my x-01 at 50 and am in my mid 60s now and haven‚Äôt had to repair yet. 
---
Concept of immunity zero damage seems to be bethesdas downfall as in adventure mode players in passive are still getting 1 shot killed by greifers so our camps being immune i dont have a hope for . I do hope they get it right .. i hate having to move my camp daily because my camps become prime targets for greifers witch becomes extremely expensive not only cap wise but the mats to repair 
---
I met a guy who had like 3 going outside whitesprings. so we turned them off. he turned them back on. we destroyed them. he built like 30. we destroyed his fusion generator. then he built 10 fusion generators. we destroyed those. he stopped.
---
I have all my perks invested in 1 handed melee.  15 strength(3 Blocker, 3 Incisor, 3 Martial Artist and 2 in each Gladiator.  I think I have 1 piece of +STR armor, so 16 without any food or boosts.  I use 3 meat hooks.  Troubleshooters, Instigating and a Mutant's with 40 pwr attack dmg.  I rarely pull out the Mutant's and use the Troubleshooters up til it needs repair.  They all do about 270 base dmg when repaired to 200% with my loadout.  Power attack dmg adds to this and of course instigating doubles it if at full health.  All have the extra hooks mod.
---
I also use 2 ski swords, which come in at around 235 when fully repaired.  Instigating and my go to Suppressor's with 40% swing speed.  Both have the Metal Shards mod, not bladed, which could be better for certain builds.  
---
As for 2H, the Grognak's Axe has by far the most base dmg, but others might beat it with the right perks.  I've read a regular sledge and the spear can do some bad ass damage.
---
I also never used melee in any prior Fallout game, but have run it almost exclusively since switching from shotguns/pistols around level 25.  There is a learning curve and tons of options for melee, so do your homework before committing your perk points.
---
That's why I follow the sub. It will be good again. But not for a while.
---
As long as I don't have to be Lahey.
---
You want power patcher and fix it good to repair to 200% for the least amount of mats
---
Very very true.  High level radscorpions can also be really dangerous with their poison damage, especially in pairs.  My melee character wears T-51b armor.  I've been attacked by two at once, starting at full health (or close to it) and was unable to counter the stacked poison with stimpaks and a vampire's sledge.  Even with a stim or three going, my health was dropping like I was standing in a blast zone naked.
---
Also doesn't the game look super weird and upwards stretched on that resolution? I had a monitor like yours but it literally made my eyes hurt so i got an used 144hz 1920x1080 monitor for 150‚Ç¨. The game is so much better now.
---
The *only* time I have ever upvoted a comment about attacking someone's camp.

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs where I placed my camp but the only thing that ever attacks it is a scorched officer. I can‚Äôt take the beeping anymore.

I been collecting legendary pistols for awhile. they might not be the best damage but they are efficient. bolt-action pipe pistols are nice with covert operative and mister sandman. I have a mutant slayers explosive one that can one shot supermutants.  If your on PC add me my name is X3S I like to trade pistols.
---
I hope. I don't even know if it is really an exploit but with a doubt...

You have to do this in an exact order. You can see with the second picture that there are flat roof pieces for the flooring, and below them are foundations. You start the build with 2 foundations and put down at least 1 half wall on a side. Then I carefully placed foundations behind those foundations at a lower height. With the second set of foundations, you can place half walls on the second set facing towards the bar into the sides of the first set of foundations, and then attach flat roof pieces to them that'll act as the flooring for the bar. Once the roof pieces are at a height that will enable the dressers to sit flush with the half walls of the bar, you can move onto the next step (this. can. take. forever. to. get. exact.). Once that's done, you can attach a foundation ramp that extends exactly one half walls up or down (in this case up) somewhere around the second set of foundations (you don't have to keep the ramp). That ramp will let you snap the foundations around the bar at the right height, creating the main floor of the building. The whole building is built around the bar.
---
Took me about an hour figuring out how to do it, and changing heights of foundations without foundations automatically snapping to others requires you to remove adjacent foundations first, and then adjusting the height of the foundation (basically build a 4x4, pick a corner, and remove the 2 than can snap to it). This lets you adjust the height without changing the position of the foundation. Also, getting the roofs to fit into place can require you to build around the half walls with roofs until you can snap a roof piece where you want it to go, and then removing the extra roof pieces.

I honestly don't know if it is stretched or not I haven't sat down and played the game much  since launch. I only hop on once every now and then to see if they patched the resolution.
---
I predict the wasterlanders DLC will bring what a lot of people want and that‚Äôs human NPCs with dialogue choices and consequences. I personally have always played fallout as a free roaming and exploring game so I don‚Äôt mind how it is now however I still think it‚Äôs need more to do. If they manage to get that added then it should be a pretty complete game for all fallout fans. That combined with the fact it‚Äôs also going to have raids and dungeons not to mention its multiplayer is why I think it will eventually be the best fallout.

Don't hang on to a level 5 sniper rifle at level 35 unless it's a legendary.

No, removing the limit will have the effect of a huge rise of prices, but people will start exchange high rated items for money and invest that money for the expensive itemes they need instead of asking "trades only".

If caps become common, then the market will shift to using a different form of currency. In a world where everyone is running around with 200k+ caps, who wants caps? 
---
You should have regrets...
---
Namely not using PlayStation. üòã
---
Out of curiosity, what is your build?  I play both a stealth sniper and a T-51b slugger, and scorchbeasts are significantly easier to manage with the sniper.  I just kind of accept that different playstyles have individual strengths and weaknesses.  
---
My melee guy has a backup pistol that I modded with a prime receiver specifically to make Scorchbeast fights a little easier.  I use ranged attacks so infrequently that 200 rounds of ultracite ammo will last a couple weeks.
---
There is a way to force them to land. A scorchbeast fight is basically a boss-with-minions deal.  If you kill the handful of scorched attached to the boss, it will force her to land.  Sometimes this can be easier said than done.  One enemy might be stuck in one of the millions of gullies in Cranberry Bog, or even worse, be a legendary that will actively run away and avoid you.  When I play my melee guy, I immediately seek out the scorched minions, kill them all (usually 5-7 will spawn) and when the Scorchbeast lands, I just sprint straight into her and try to deal as much damage as quickly as possible.  A secondary benefit of taking down the scorched helpers first is that you can max out Adrenaline perk for that +60% damage and the actual boss goes down in a few seconds.
---
Your best bet is to try and lead the fight into the most open area you can find, kill the trash and force the scorchbeast to land.  Sprint in with an initial power attack or store a VATS crit if you use guns.  If you have even a single star instigating rifle, you can do a huge amount of damage with an initial hit and a stored crit.  I've killed lvl 50 scorchbeasts outright with an instigating lever gun and temporarily swapping Class Freak for a three rank Better Criticals card.  I imagine it wouldn't be that crazy to one-shot a lvl 80 with an Instigating/+50% crit Dragon and three ranks of a Better Crits card.
---
Oh...I completely agree that Scorchbeast rewards are junk.  The only thing worthwhile for me is the one ultracite scrap from the wing, as I've been craft/scrapping ultracite lasers for mods.  I have herbivore mutation, so the meat is useless aside for a short-term 15% damage resist, +3 luck or agility boost.  I don't generally pick it up anymore.
---
They must be aware of the fact that caps are basically useless no matter how many of them they let us stockpile. 
---
Did the devs not say something about photo frames in camps in the 2019 roadmap? I know they talked about useable handheld cameras. You know, like the binoculars, but useful and fun.
---
You definitely get to a point in the game where you know what‚Äôs behind most locked doors and the junk loot you know you‚Äôll get from a safe isn‚Äôt worth it.
---
Get the white knight perk. Max it.

 The potential benefit of removing the cap limit is that the real value of rare items might be better expressed. 
---
1 is tough, 2 yogis will play handball with you no problem, 3 at once are almost unbeatable and most times arn't

It seems ok since at level 1, you start with 1 point in every SPECIAL. So, at level 10, it should add up to 16.

In the world if everybody had a limit of 25.000$ how could you sell buildings, sportscar etc?

It needs to flash in the middle of your screen. The only reason I know sometimes (playing survival as of late) is seeing loot bags around my base on the map.

Also if you‚Äôre like me and you have some ‚Äúlevel up‚Äùs banked you need to factor in the annoying step of opening the pip-boy and backing out of the level up screen. Ugh.
---
An instigating hunting/lever/blackpowder rifle or Dragon with a saved vats cit and "Better Criticals" card will do it.

Without the limit they want be useless anymore. Belive me

In real world economy the prices fluctuate with the market. The game has SET prices on items. If everyone had $25,000 and milk was still $2 a gallon, its a different story than if milk went up to $3000 a gallon

He just came up to me at Thunder Mountain Substation, saw he wasn't red so I went and killed the deathclaw. Afterwards while searching the net for info I was stealthed on the roof of the hut just inside the fence.  When I went back to the game he was on top of the roof with me, with no way for him to have gotten there, lol.  I left him there, he shouldn't be able to get down either... ;)

However I'd say that with some practice a level 25+ can solo it in 20 minutes or so. (I do it pretty regularly to power the fusion core plant, and also power the food machine over at sunlight meadows).
---
Including server hoping I'd think all generator plans could be got in 2-3 hours.
---
Bartering will always happen, and I assume with legendary vendor people will switch to wanting tokens. Since the trade system only allows caps though it will likely become the tokens are worth so many caps.
---
Weightless Sentinel sold!  Thanks Big D!

Still can hope to get it as event reward or in treasure map.

Also it seems that plan mods available as purchase cannot be unlocked via scrapping which make sense.

Well i didn't think they would, but a man can dream.

Yeah its supposed to be a useable camera. Like binoculars, but not useless. I'm really hoping it can zoom, change exposure and background blur like the current photo mode. I'll role-play a combat photographer on the next SBQ fight if they do it!

Also, we need to be able to share these and put them up around camps. Maybe even photo boards at train stations?

Even though they‚Äôve taken responsibility for the mistakes and explained that they wanted players to break the mode to in order to build it futher
---
New Vegas had the strongest and most deadly version of Deathblow IMO
---
The point being?
---
Ahh, my bad. I totally read that wrong
---
Surely that‚Äôs an unintended consequence of a combined vendor pool. The middle of the map vendors are going to have 100s of clothing items in stock.... it‚Äôll be a little funny. 
---
The only thing that would likely deal consistently higher damage in PVE is a Bloodied weapon in conjunction with the Adrenal Reaction mutation. If that is further combined with Unyielding legendary armor pieces you can get a rather ridiculous bonus to perception and agility, granting you a pretty substantial amount of action points and a decent increase to VATS accuracy. Nerd Rage will also grant additional bonus damage below 20%hp, which is generally what you want for increased bonus damage from the Bloodied effect and Adrenal Reaction. The downside is that you're relatively fragile. If you perk into stealth or bonus DR/ER out of power armor and Serendipity you can mitigate most of the threat related to spending almost all your time below 20% hp. The trouble with this set-up is it's entirely gear dependent and really won't be effective till you've got everything set up just so. I made a new character to set up a bloodied build, and only after I'd got at least a basic 5 piece set of mismatched Unyielding armor and some mediocre 1 star bloodied fist weapons. So far it's been a lot of fun, and I've been able to replace some pieces as I've progressed.  
---
I didn't find it particularly difficult to find the pieces I needed either considering the base requirement was simply 1 star gear. The worst part for me personally was buying serums on account of doing it before serum recipes became more widely obtained, but even that wasn't particularly terrible, just took several days.  
---
Hopefully they fix the ability to inspect multi-star items in the same update.
---
Floor decorations or something like that. I can check again tomorrow if you still can't find it.
---
I love putting these in workshops.
---
I would love to just display items I `ve collected. Teddy Bears, Mr. Fuzzys, unused Bobbleheads, etc.
---
Thanks, I had friends every time I played in the early levels so I didn't know if it were possible or not. 
---
Now that the wasteland has claimed them (the bugs got the better of them) Im already level enough to do most things myself but was unsure if it a lower level could.
---
That sounds like a very possible evolution.  In an odd way, the FO76 economy evolving in game may end up being quite different from the lore. 
---
Hmm. Interesting. Sorry  thought you were going to spam sell them.
---
I'm not sure they'll share inventory though. Different vendors have different stock  currently, I would think that would be maintained.
---
can you get power armor mods  for scrapping power armor pieces? 
---
Yes to faction decor!
---
Why do we not have faction flags yet we have the U.S. Flag? I mean they did say they'll be working on Faction PvP Mode at some point (This was after the game came out) so I guess the faction vendors at Whitespring Resort is a step in the right direction?
---
I think there's a bug with the Gatling lasers. If you holster them and pull them back out there'll be less ammo
---
Numbers works in a simply way. Nothing can cost less than 0 (free). Or 1 (minimum price). Let's say the cheepest item in fo76 is a pin, value 1cap (value can't be cheeper) so this is something we can't change. If you put a 25k limit for caps, the consequences are that no item in the game can have a value 25 thousand times more than a pin, and here is where economy brakes. The limit to money have the effect of making trades more convinient than money because itemes have more value than currency. To make money solve their function, limits must be removed so that items will get the value according to the ask/offer market rule. 
---
Yeah they do, but I assume once we can sell 1400 to one vendor then people will just do that. 40 hats will be enough for me to clear out a vendor. Pleasant valley train station is about to receive 40 hats a day from me. I assume other people will be the same...
---
I always leave food or a stimpack for them üòä 
---
Could be fun to have a good credit scrore, even if its only in a virtual world.
---
We Also need something in game to invest them!
---
If you're on PC, the Better Inventory mod does this (it also breaks down weight by individual item, as well as by category, e.g. you can see how much your missles weigh, and all your ammo collectively as well). Can't imagine playing the game without it.

Just add an attunement to the SBQ, just like Enclave events. If you havent finished the BOS Questline with the glasses caverns you cant enter the event and wont get loot. They just need to tie the queen to the event somehow and low levels wont be able to leech anymore.

All the ones that reduce item weight too... wasting 11 perk points because I'm such a hoarder.
---
You can just sort by weight in each tab while going through your stash.  Really thinking about what you actually need and in what quantity will cut at least 100lb out of your stash in junk alone.
---
Don't store meds, booze or food.  Keep that stuff on your character if you have traveling pharmacy, thru-hiker or a piece of armor with food/drink/aid weight reduction.  There's really no need to carry more than 30 stimpaks or 20 radaway.  If you have a suit of power armor or a hazmat suit, just ditch rad-x and rad resist chems entirely.  They provide no appreciable bonus in a radiation zone when you're already wearing power armor or a hazmat suit. The hidden multiplier that PA and hazmat suits have is literally 1000's of times better than stacking rad-x, glowing blood pack and radshield.
---
Do you really need more than 100 adhesive when it's available all over the map?  I store only 150 units of steel and 150 wood, even though I use them a lot.  They're easy to pick up everywhere.  Why hoard common junk?  Ballistic Fiber and Screws I can understand keeping 200+ of.  Large stacks of junk weigh a lot.

Thanks for clarifying.  I had a feeling that might be case.  Oh well, looks like I‚Äôll carry on popping back to base every now and then.

Thanks! It's my third character, so I am somewhat disciplined with loot and I have stash full of junk. So the only thing I need is more legendaries outside of nuke zones to farm. Because I will never equip power armour on this character and with hazmat suit my dr are of a wet tissue paper. We can exchange booze another time, when the challenges require it.
---
Didnt think you could, thought it had a weight limit on it...gonna try next one I pass.
---
How can you make it cost 4 50 balls and not give full damage to all 4? It should do like 800 damage a shot not fucking 2 or 300 I call bullshit
---
Like when scrolling the res scroll right ,right , right or  left , left , left ? 
---
Wait are they combining all vendors into one cap share? 
---
i literally just bought Skyrim... again. so you‚Äôve got my vote
---
I‚Äôm camped out at the lead deposit north of Fissure Site Prime, so I‚Äôm already used to the occasional nuke. It‚Äôs a nice spot, if you don‚Äôt mind putting up with the local airborne wildlife and the chronic thermonuclear weather.
---
I really want a hammock
---
or buy a monitor from this century?!
---
I hate the look of the recon scope on most guns. I would absolutely love for binoculars to get recon/night vision mods so I could use them for spotting targets during things like Distant Thunder.
---
I love my CRT okay , ultra wide is for losers (joking)   
---
I am planning on buy a new screen but the finances are not working out at the moment 
---
Remember to lock up your purifiers- easy pickings for unfriendly neighbour otherwise 
---
Shotguns with enforcer forces them to lend, and keeps them on the ground. Only keeps SBQ on the ground for about ~20-30 seconds before she heals herself. So long as you have the range perks to hit her in the air eventually you force her to land again. Focus wings, then legs. Rinse &amp; Repeat.
---
I doubt Bethesda would change the perk card system to something like the FO4 version (which I prefer). Maybe they could tweak the card system a bit to take out the monotony of having to switch out cards to lockpick, hack, repair etc.  Perhaps allow a couple of perk builds which you could switch to a lot quicker?
---
That's a good story. At least you got a good chuckle out of it! 
---
Maybe they'll address this soon. I see they're taking the servers offline tomorrow, so it could be done sooner rather than later, maybe... 
---
Good point, I might have to have a little rethink about my perk build...don‚Äôt think I have any lock skills üòÇ
---
Doing the lord Todd's work.
---
Yes. Let's make it so that everything you need to collect and do within the game can be done inside c.a.m.p.
---
Reminds me of Garrisons in WoW. How did that go?
---
Just a baaaaaaaad baaaaaaaaad idea.
---
So what do you suggest people who are powergrinding an alt do? Go back to whitesprings? Lmao
---
 I used that parts mod to show me what carries each - I have like 500 Screws and Springs atm.
---
Evidently, if you spawn in with your weapon sheathed, you should be invulnerable for a short period of time. I know this probably won't prevent spawn killing entirely but it helps. Also, I've found some of the less-traveled train stations don't have campers and fast traveling to events is usually a good bet.
---
Yep. In about 10 hours. 
---
someone‚Äôs probably just taken it from that server already, most of that kinda items are server based so once so eone takes it it wont be there for anyone else on that server
---
forsomwreasonI get wrecked by gulpers
---
Want proof? PM me, I'll send you the link to my channel an I'll go drop a few for you. They are quite fun for easy loot.
---
new myself as well, great game so far
---
The alien blaster its self isn't at the dome.
---
I know. I got the blaster but I want the rounds and mod. 
---
That's my plan too!
---
All removing the limit would do is inflate caps to be an even more useless currency. Having more caps in circulation doesn‚Äôt fix anything. The big issue with caps isn‚Äôt that we can‚Äôt hold enough of them, it‚Äôs that we have nothing to actually spend them on. The people selling top-tier items aren‚Äôt asking for trades just because they‚Äôre full on caps. They just know that they‚Äôre better off trading those items for something that they could actually use.
---
I have this issue in my new account. I typed my account name but it showed as a random string of numbers and letters. I contacted support, stated my problem and they responded saying that an agent will deal with my problem. About a month later and i still havent heard from them.. No idea what went wrong with my account name so i figure others must have had the same problem
---
There's aliens?!
---
Howd you get in
---
A square, I think, would be preferable.
---
That way I could mark my boundaries with power poles and my buddy could move in next door 
---
Hitting the bottom of the world underneath it.
---
Same here, I know it's gonna pop up when I've forgotten all about him and scare the shit outta me.
---
Actually it got very bright.
---
I‚Äôd buy the Ant Agonizer helmet. 
---
Uhm, this fight makes sense. Even buffed a single Deathclaw should not be anywhere near a match for a MLQ or Scorchbeat. Both are bigger, stronger, and have way deadlier attacks.
---
Communist scum
---
Looks like a giant pp
---
Nah Mr Gusty are pretty annoying
---
I actually got in to gaming solely because of my husband and have come a long way from my humble beginnings (mainly me crying in frustration because I didn't know how to walk üòÇ to me now being the one keeping him alive). Being able to play FO76 together has been awesome and our experiences sound a lot like your own. Get all the loot!
---
I know that.  The four worlds I just checked weren‚Äôt opened no locks pick or anything. 
---
Paint it up like the bots in Nuka World...have them spray acid at attackers.
---
Ahh.
---
Yea just jump servers. Sounds like someone beat you to it.
---
That's a bold statement.
---
If this isn‚Äôt a troll post...
---
Most; 90% of the mobs i fight are at full HP. Also, the base damage is enough to kill random mobs.
---
Here's a clip of me using a crappy weapon to one shot random mobs. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2PQrqbthn4
---
In that scenario a Two shot could miss lots of shots and a furious is useless. Instigating or anti-armor would be overkill. 
---
White Knight / Fix It Good combo for normal armor, Power Patcher for Power Armor.
---
Its not I came back after not playing for a few months. Genuine post
---
Where are the tnt domes on the map ?,I was given an alien blaster early on in the game,I can‚Äôt recall visiting that place yet.
---
Early in the game Deathclaws are pretty bad if you have little ability to cripple them. Later they only become an issue if they sneak up on you while not wearing PA. I had that happen once while fighting some ghouls at Whitespring. To say it was a surprise is an understatement.
---
The issue with Deathclaws is that with FO4 and now 76 they now have these specific natures that make them way easier to deal with along with crippling making them some of the most pathetic creatures in all of the Wasteland. There are honestly ways to make them more interesting fights w/o giving them much of a buff. Having them attack in groups is one (and the real reason the were an issue in NV). Making them not run out of fear is another. Giving them something resembling sneak wouldn't be the worst idea either. When you cripple them they could actually get extra violent and claw after you since they have nothing to lose. Their attacks should also stun a bit like Yao Gaui. Bringing back their slam ability would't be a bad idea either.
---
Ya they do this for each update. Remove camps that are to close to areas on the map that are changing. My guess is that that cave will become a new area or have some new things in it to do with the new Sheepsquatch quest or maybe the pioneer scouts that comes out later.
---
Ok gotcha. 
---
Nothing‚Äôs changed since you left and returned in this case. Bases are always susceptible to player damage in any mode. If players group and you attack one of them, you flag yourself to the entire group. Bounty would make no difference either way. 
---
I hope this helps shed a little light.
---
you said where the problem is: " because they‚Äôre full on caps"
---
Remove the limit and people will accept caps again
---
It‚Äôs been mentioned a bit. They‚Äôre aware, it‚Äôs just an intentional grindy mechanic they don‚Äôt want to give up on 
---
Those blue suitcases are amazing. I found some Ultracite, ammo and glowing mass, gave me just enough to stabilize my about to expire violet flux.
---
I returned the favour by dropping a few stimpaks, screws and a few bits of ballistic fibre
---
Watoga is pretty amazing.
---
Nah man. Just gimme ur account infos I‚Äôll play Bugout76 for ya if you aren‚Äôt sure. ;)
---
I smoke irl and I think adding it to the game is fucking stupid.
---
As a smoker I'm stupid, so think of the level of stupid I'm labelling this idea.
---
Although its an adult game, kids are still on here. Smoking cigarettes is notorious for drawing people in by looking like a cool thing to do. And that's the only reason I could imagine you wanting them in there.
---
The only rational reason to smoke is because you're addicted. Why the hell do you want to smoke cigarettes in the game?!
---
I can reasonably assume that this idea is possibly being pushed by someone backing tobacco corporate, which is fucking disgusting.
---
i mean loot: 2-3star lvl50 armor with chameleon+unyielding or chameleon+unyielding+ blostering the rest is junk. and for weapons two shoot, bloodied, anti-armor maybe  instigating but the rest is junk. btw if u need chem just farm whitesping and u will swim in stimpacks and radx.

"The ultra-popular video-game Fallout 76".
---
That gave me a good chuckle. Popular to those of us still on this sub, but it was unfortunately branded a total joke by the general public and game reporting community. 
---
It goes for 35 bucks now at most retailers... sigh.
---
What remains are the die hard fallout fans. Even most of those have left.

Im just asking why before I would get like a 50 cap bounty for destroying one wall. They literally leveled my camp and had a 20 cap bounty total

---
I‚Äôm camped at the lead deposit north of Fissure Site Prime. Need I say more?
---
I actually like the spot. Free lead and I almost never load in to find the spot taken. Plus I can lead folks back to use my decontamination shower after fighting the Scorchbeast Queen. (Though I do wish I could use the tall concrete walls to disrupt nuclear shockwaves and weaken them to a level a brick house could withstand.)
---
I find them at least once every couple days....if not that, then I find butt loads of ammo...heck yesterday I found a Stimpak recipe in one of the trash bins.
---
Because they like blaming the game
---
Sadky, like it has been said several times on this sub, sharing pictures in the game could pose problems, mainly on pc, where picture are saved to hard drive in a folder where the user could put any picture.
---
System?
---
Won't happen due to perfomance issues.
---
Synths weren't invented yet but they could do ghouls because they are technically not human anymore and seeing how it's only 25 years after the bombs fell I'd imagine most people wandering the wastes would be ghouls
---
It's 2 LBS if you take off the stupid mirv. I think it does more damage that way.
---
Considering they're new, I wonder how it went for them, wake up in The Mire beside a gulper? lol.
---
Cool
---
Cool 
---
It‚Äôs really impressive that you managed to misread that to the extent that you got the exact opposite meaning from my comment. No one cares if they‚Äôre at max caps or not. There‚Äôs nothing worth spending caps on, and there‚Äôs no reason to trade a top tier item for caps only to hope someone is selling an item you actually want for caps. Caps have no value, and adding more caps to the equation will not give them value. 
---
I'll be honest I'm in two minds as to which system I prefer. I think the FO4 system overall.
---
Example, with the FO4 system, you only needed Str2 to gain access to all the Melee Weapon perks. This allowed you to represent a high skilled yet not physically strong character, in FO76, you're a minimum of Str9 (Infact due to other issues, a rather large number of characters are Str10+ if not just straight 15)
---
But, even the FO4 system is flawed, it was very restricted in allowing the introduction of new perks, which FO76 doesn't have a problem with.
---
Not that it will change, but a middle ground would be better. 1 Perk per Special as per the FO76, but multiple ranks without taking up more "Slots". 
---

To their website, you can read patch not there :
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/332797/upcoming-fallout-76-maintenance-april-2-2019?language=en
---
I don't think a lot of people use fatmans because the ammo isn't easy to come by and requires speccing into explosive weight reduction.
---
So you can get lucky and manage to sell it, because they aren't commonly sold, but you can also not get lucky.
---
Rofl I had to reread your comment a few times before I even realized I wrote it wrong
---
Are they not easy to kill? 
---
I‚Äôve invited you to both 
---
I'll give you caps for it.
---
Reading their patch note for today make it sure it's not for this update.
---
If you're not already doing so, you can play with one copy of fo76, one xbox live sub, and one xbox game pass up to two console for the price of one.  
---
This is officially supported and done through xbox by setting your wifes xbox to the home Xbox (silver account logs in) and then you logging into the other xbox with your gold account.
---
Cheers!
---
Even if they did something, they wouldn't contribute anything. I used to be enthusiastic when It came to SBQ, used special ammo and so on...now, f#ck it. If some low levels come and get same rewards as me, then I'll do same much as those low levels.
---
Nope, that patch isn't until 4/9.
---
Tomorrow is simply a hotfix for client crashing and FT/spawn issues in Survival mode.
---
Sorry, not for sale It's my go-to for shooting at the SBQ and feeling like I'm contributing when she is in the air.
---
You ain't lying. Level 22's can murder anyone at level 200
---
If you lock your own stuff, it appears locked but you can open without trying to pick it (you locked it so you have the key)
---
I know but then you will only get lvl 25 armor might as well wait and get a better one as the flux is so hard to get hold of
---
...and automatically makes you Wanted status
---
But I guess I need to have a high lockpick skill to lock it in the first place?
---
Screw all the jokes, these devs worked their butts off overtime to fix most of the launch bugs. The gameplay is almost on par with 4 and improving every update. The story is all environment, holotapes, and notes. A lot of it you figure out for yourself. I will drop a nano-spoiler to start you on a rabbit-hole of an unmarked, player discovered quest at the bottom of this comment.
---
There's a couple NPC's, though you dont have meaningful interactions with them. Lots of wacky creature encounters. The best interactions are with players. Especially players who RP (roleplay. Kinky or not)
---
They are about to release a few major content updates in the coming months... but if you work a regular ass job like most of us, thats enough time to level yourself to 50 (generally accepted as the level where the training wheels are removed, and usually by which time you've just about beaten all launch content). The game is like 35 bucks at a lot of places currently.
---
Nano spoiler: Pay very close attention to references to an entity known as "the interloper" and any site containing giant metal heads. Massive implications for the fallout universe. Have fun :)
---
I leave mine unlocked. If someone needs water they are welcome to grab some.

I was on during 2 nukes today, different servers, so it still happens.
---
I'm not a filthy commie
---
Shouldn't, if you're in your camp building view, and you know how you can scrap items, when you go onto the item you want to lock (door, purifier, etc) then there should be a button to do so and spend resources on which type of lock you want 0-3, if someone tries to break in, they get a wanted level
---
Love it, on ya mate. Will be there if your on ps4

Ohhhh that‚Äôs a shame :(

Perhaps a player trebuchet?

Truth! I've taken on the death claws I've run across with no problem...

I spent hours server hopping to get the Hunter's Longcoat, while my friend got it on his first try when he joined on me after I found the bot.
---
Atleast my friend was nice enough to sit around for almost 2 hours to let me rejoin the server over and over to refresh the vendor bot's inventory.
---
I need aluminum and I have fluxes. If you sell me enough aluminum for caps I'm gonna give the flux as a free bonus.
---
Solved with player reporting and screen capping?
---
It‚Äôs always helpful to leave your camp accessible to others I think, if I‚Äôm wandering around with loads of junk to scrap and I come across a camp it‚Äôs handy to go in, fix up some weapons up and go again 
---
Global/local text chat yes. The radio stuff not so much, seems ripe for abuse by trolls. 
---
I have aluminium for you, add me Molybzen
---
You may as well not bother with concrete walls, a couple of scorched will punch holes  in them no issue. Oh and fight back and you lose caps. Game is fucked for PVP.

I would also give your first born

It‚Äôs so good.

On xbox one it was possible to decline an incoming request (you had to set price first, then cancel with X). After patch I cant do it anymore.
---
On the other side, when I REQUEST something and the other player set a price, there's a nice and easy menu where I can refuse their set price for multiple reasons (price too high/low, dont want it,etc)
---
It didnt if you jump from the top of the pylon you can find their skeleton on the ground 
---
Yes, it could work that way. But do you really think they would risk it? Are you really willing to see dick pics here and there?

Ah sorry mates. Just realized I forgot the all important System question.

- 2 more Nukes on Whitesprings

 That place should be a smoking cavern to hell by now...

I noticed this by accident a few weeks ago - was playing FO4 and started 76 and wasn't til later I realised the 76 DVD wasn't in!

Damn maybe I should be doing this currently a level 15. Do you just turn up and hang back reap XP?

They‚Äôre all just west of vault 76 the fast travel is black mountain ordinance works or something like that

So you don't like fancy hairbrushes?

Same set up! Xbox and tv side by side exploring the wasteland since beta. Been with my dude for 9 years this year with a newly spawned 6 month old. No matter what all we‚Äôve been through, gaming has always been something we can enjoy doing. Ups, downs, and everything in between, nothing has ever stopped us from sitting down and enjoying a good game together. From MMOs, FPS, rpgs, fighters, mobas, &amp; even simulators old and new there‚Äôs nothing like having a partner there that enjoys the gaming world as much as you do! 
---
I want more objects that feel like they belong to a wasteland.
---
More dirty used objects.
---
My lower than 50 level alt, did little to no damage to the SBQ. But kept her grounded for a good 10 minutes until my shotty broke and she took off. For that time, the melee builds around me were cutting her flesh and did wonder. We finished the event with time to spare.
---
You'll make the group fail the event and you'll all get nothing.
---
I've seen several players take super sledges to low level players hiding in the barn (causing it to fail). I didn't try to stop them.

Maybe make crippled limbs mend slowly even with stimpaks

Use vats. If you have some points remaining you‚Äôll be able to see the direction they start to go in. 
---
You won't see that in a few hours. Good try though
---
Yeah my bad. Had the patches mixed up.

---
Since i play this game i see red stars on houses here and there.
---
I talked about it to someone IRL saying it was commies symbol, i got replied that it was an USA symbol.
---
Now reading comments in this post, i finally know i was right. Thanks.
---
Now i only have one more question about this, why do they have red star on houses? Is it like when the nazis were drawing a symbol on the houses of jewish people?
---
I hope you are on PC, I have a TON of plans to trade. I wanna' come use the crapper!
---

great idea, i am just not using mods at this point.  to afraid of the "BAN HAMMER!!"  lol
---
With my looted T-60 I didn't care much, but now with excavator I always use the place command.
---
That's actually a pretty good idea, especially for the people without microphones.
---
i am not sure this is correct.  when my stash hits 790, i bulk, and my total weight goes down.
---
Didn't know that. How fast it consumes AP? It still has the same restriction of non-movement as chameleon?
---
True but will save the pain of traveling to vendors only to have forgotten that faction is now a 0 caps üò°
---
People can get a cramburger anywhere, okay? They come to Appalachia for the atmosphere and the attitude. Okay? That's what the flair's about. It's about fun.
---
good idea.  what i mean though is, it would help if we could see the total weight of each tab at a glance.  that way we can see where the bulk of our weight is and then micro organize it.
---
I bought the lever gun plans and made ,scrapped 20 odd and I got all the mods from it apart from the nv scope.
---
When I'm out and about I pick up guns then go to a bench and scrap them even if I'm not going to use one as it's handy that I may change my mind.
---
I saw at least a nuke last night, two servers in a row. WS then queen.
---
It still happens on PC.
---
Well, the other day, i sumble upon my first queen while looking for flux for a Biv daily. I helped with the fight. I used vats crits several times. I wasn't a low level. I was around 48.
---
But, i havent done the quest you talked about. So, you i would have been better not bothering helping with the fight? In the end, i had no loot from her body.
---
I know just like Johnson's Acres, but the one's u build at base don't have that Tnt Plunger boost.

---
I just woke up and am soon leaving for work. Are you online now? If yes I could drop in soon if not in how many hours you will be. How many aluminum you got, how many caps each, and how many flux do you need?
---
Hi, if you've still got the code I'm interested in the give away.
---
Like instead of launching artillery shells let us launch ourselfs!

They are a pain for my melee build especially when they land and then fly off immediately. I've had sbq land 3 times in a row and then fly off, that's in the span of ten minutes of it just flying around. Who designed these things?

That moment when a goddamn bear is more terrifying than a giant, mutant pre-war bio weapon lizard.

It's funny, Yao Guai act like a bear as well, where they just won't stop mauling you to death until they're drooling and exhausted, only to beat on you some more while screaming in Power Armor: OH GOD HELP ME! AHHHH!

Increase move speed, and armor

That's cool man. Wish my wife could play. Not only does she not have a system but she just dont have the knack for gaming. She plays with our youngest on rare occasions and it's just sad lol. She laughs at her lack of ability tho its all good. 
---
As per your request above, I studied economics and i agree with everyone who has disagreed with you. Countries do have a finite amount of money in circulation, and increasing this amount is called quantitative easing which is essentially what you‚Äôre suggesting.
---
Whilst this increases the money available it causes increased demand for products which causes inflation. This is what would happen in this game. If you raise the cap products will just be sold for 50k instead of 25k.
---
As people have already suggested to you the issue is that caps have very little value inside the game, what is there to buy in game for caps? Very little. That‚Äôs the issue, if people could use caps to buy good stuff in game then they‚Äôd probably sell top tier weapons on here for caps instead of trades
---
Weapon #28 PSN: DA_SHADOWMAN not on right now but ill trade for 3* junkie super sledge. I don't remember other two but mightve been 40 SS
---
aaaaaaaaaaaand............................server crashes again.   3x
---
Ah bugger, I'm setting up ontop of a railway bridge, any name ideas then? 
---
You're posting this in the wrong place. Message the mods on the trading sub. This sub is not connected to that sub.
---
In fact I need 2 cobalt flux and 1 violet flux ! Sorry
---
Add a mutated form of marijuana. It's in now but still contoversal.
---
Smoke a rad joint. Wake up laughing and conversing with a death claw. 
---
I studied too. You confuse the limit of money in the circuit with the limit of "holding" ammount. They are 2 things completly different. 
---
Same with the not 'getting it' :( He got sick of it on the walk down to the Overseers Camp. 
---
Thanks a lot !
---
I have a pic some place of my character  being blown off the white springs station roof by a nuke lol. 
---
Awesome, I'm jumping off soonish to have dinner. And should be back on for a little while in the evening. :)
---
It should be optional. You could turn it on if your shop is open. 
---
Stay safe and happy hunting
---
I concur, I really wish they turned off griefing on adventure servers. Survival is for that if people are into it.
---
Depends on what It's going to be. I.e - Trading post/shop, house, Nuke viewing platform. 
---
Fair enough haha seems like a cool shop, I got a curio shop near WhiteSprings if you wanna check it out too, I'm a very overencumbered boi
---
No, pre-bethesda is 1 and 2..and sadly tactics. I try to forget that game exists. 
---
If you're Xbox I can give you whatever materials you still need
---
This vendor spawns at a specific points on the map, but other things can spawn there instead of him, so server hoping is basically rerolling a different server in the hops of getting him to spawn.
---
How do you figure? You can easily have a 4 person team's camps within render distance, but you can't build close enough to actually do anything awesome with that capability.
---
That sums it up nicely. You crash and someone else now owns it.
---
My luck with Charleston has been 50/50. I'll get days where I can get him to spawn 3 times in 10-15 hops. Other days it's 30+ jumps and I still haven't spawned him. 
---
2 days ago after 3 hours I finally got the Lemonade stand bot to spawn.
---
RNG's a bitch.
---
I hope this will not be PvP focused and instead PvE survival coop focused. I mean we PvPers got a wonderful Survival mode. Please gib our PvE bros and gals the challenge the way their like their challenges.
---
A way to build underground 
---
No you'll still have the same amount just the loaded ammo count will reset to match the available ammo count
---
It‚Äôs doing that for me today 
---
Same i only want to sell my stuff, i Don't suddenly want my remote camp to become a busy fast travel spot for people. 
---
**Unless** the fee they pay to teleport to my camp goes in my pocket. That would be the only condition i would be willing to agree on.
---
It's not the limit, its rather that there is no real cap sink that would take away caps from high geared players. Means people with high gear, they get nothing from having caps, so for them there is no point selling their gear for caps. Come up with sink like "turn your 25k caps into 250 atoms"..boom high gear players would be out of caps and be selling their gear for caps.
---
My idea is that some perk cards would have passive and active effects. Passive effects are unlocked when perk card is unlocked. Active effects are enbled after equipping the card. For example Gunsmith: The crafting portion would be passive effect, the weapon condition portion would be active effect.
---
Luckily I'm on Xbox haha, thanks. 
---
Just checked and I need 60 screws and just about 30 black titanium. Think that's all, thanks again. My GT is RikudoSaiyan7.
---
reference to 4
---
You on PC? I'll sell them for 300 each. I can craft all the others too.
---
I'm always glad to find an open camp, even if it's just a stash box and workbench.
---
I always leave my camp open, with food, water and facilities for all, and a Vault-Boy gnome on a world-spawn Toolbox/Cooler to leave gifts for visitors.
---
if you go to the abandoned bog town, the red brick building right next to the workshop has around 30-50 screws. go up the stairs on the side of the building all the way up to the roof, drop down the elevator shaft to the top of the elevator and through the door there‚Äôs a room filled with typewriters, desk fans and globes, and a few telephones for fiberglass and circuits.
---
another good location is sugar grove, mainly good for springs but it‚Äôs got plenty of desk fans lying around as well. you can probably get 10-20 or so screws there along with 40-50 springs
---
Hahaha.. It seems like you and me both brother.. Haha. I'll assume your gt is your reddit tag? I'll come visit sometime. :)
---
If it's not there wait a day, the TNT Dome's loot is connected to your character not the world.
---
If you're on your own, you lose it.
---
If you're in a team, one of your team gets it.
---
Ok, I got it, so I‚Äôm gonna try it for now! Thx for amazing. Answer! 
---
Always forget to say PC, yeah I am, and I'm down for that.
---
What time zone are you, its 1:30am here so would it be cool to do it tomorrow? 
---
Bethesda have already said they are doing exactly that.
---
November 2018 i guess ... probably was in coma or some shit.
---
Yeah but as I said I'm heavy/explosive and perks are expensive.
---
I guess I can look after one, tho, since I have a few points to spend.
---
I'll grab the materials then send you a message, my gt is Furious Sausage.
---
I send random invites in case I nuke and I need to respawn the creatures on a area. 
---
I'm in the boat for being able to unlock a lot more. I'll take doing it every 5-10 levels if necessary. I'm at the point where I don't do anything at all with leveling up, because what's the point? I can keep picking cards, but they'll just rot while I use others.
---
Thanks a bunch.
---
If it helps, there's a new guaranteed Addictol spawn at Big Al's Tattoo Parlor, tucked into one of the cubbies of the front desk (in the actual aboveground tattoo parlor). Just pick one up everytime you pay Biv a visit.
---
I'd buy it for 10k rn if you were PC
---
Non-PA user on that one, I know it sounds silly but bear with me :
---
--Heavy weapons need expensive ammo  
---
--My main weapon is a legit looted TSE Gatling Plasma, which doesn't work at close range.  
---
--I had to take a combat weapon and didn't want to go all rise again  
---
--I found a 2 star (anti-mutant + bonus speed attack) deathclaw gauntlet.
---
I just went "Okay" and am now without a power armor. (Not to mention I probably couldn't buy the jetpack mod if I ever crossed its path)
---
But I'd like to reassure you people, I'm perfectly able to down a scorch beast or two, I just think it's boring as fuck to do and tiresome, for almost no reward.
---
D1E HARD TOO is my GT
---
I also have a bunch of materials if needed.
---
Yeah the whole interface for stash/inventory is fucked up. On all platforms.
---
Even if you are careful, you can sometimes make a mistake. Recently I accidentally sold one excavator piece to WS ST vendor. And then I had to buy it back. Lucky that wasn't so expensive, lost maybe 200 caps, and lucky no one else was in queue to the vendor, because you need to exit the vendor to see it and buy it back.
---
Thanks, someone else is giving me what I need bit again thanks. The community for this game is great.
---
It's not failsafe, it's just how it works because PA is container.
---
I'm sporting a godbuild. Unfortunately the only times when I met turrets was when I was wanted and when I attacked workshops. When I was wanted they shoot on sight. When I attacked workshop I actually needed to hide from those turrets because they ate 95% of my hp.
---
I'm a cavalier tho, I can be caught off guard, sentinels would stand turrets longer, at least the balistic ones, laser turrets are worth investigating now.
---
Yep. Like I said, I read it wrong. I think we all just pretend tactics doesn't exist lol
---
Use Ethernet and set up port forwarding.
---
[port forwarding](https://portforward.com/fallout-76-connection-issues/) 
---
No worries :-)
---
I did the same...I've no mutations atm...all I want is marsupial...my INT is already past 10, so its negative side affects arn't gonna affect me that much, since anything past 10 are just perk slots. I miss having it. Though, at the same time, it's nice to jump as a normal person, I guess that's what Rad-X is for.
---
I spent like an hour server hopping to get it back, but I kept getting everything but.
---
While you're at it, disable vats'ing missile and laser turrets on surface to air and line in the sand events!
---
wait till summer
---
&gt;I used vats crits several times.
---
&gt; I wasn't a low level. I was around 48.
---
Oh you sweet summer child.

---
The only reason people were campbombing is because it made you a map marker that allowed you to lure hunters.
---
On survival you can summon hunters in multiple possible ways. Camp bombing is not one of them, does pretty much nothing in that regard.
---
I met multiple camps in my survival adventure and not for once I thought of attacking it. On the contrary, I prefer open and accessible camps that allow me to grab some water make some soup repair my gun and get back to fight. I'd defend the owner of such camp against attackers to encourage such camps being there.
---
When and/or how do I get more fusion cores? I've got several but I can't see them lasting long.
---
No, what gave you that idea?
---
It was never available. It was so widespread throughout 76, it felt like everyone had them at some point lol.
---
I always keep my camp open. Anyone is welcome to come in, use my work benches and facilities and are welcome to help themselves to any water/food they wish to. That includes any contents of extracyors should I have one.
---
There is no issue for me, the crops etc replenish and there is always enough for me. Not many pass my way anyway, but still. If I was in a more populated area then I'd maybe build an extra water purifier and lock that one, but that's all.
---
The only time I have encountered players destroying anything is if I've locked stuff. An old camp had everything open, save for my own personal quarters. Someone took offence and blew all the doors off. 
---
Anytime I'm wandering if I see a camp open I'm often grateful. If it is locked I respect that and move on. But not everyone is as respectful as me I guess.

Just ran into this myself in Nuke zone.
---
Was using automatic tesla to tag mobs and let others finish them. When others had left found out that they were healing, so switched to gatling gun. Same thing. 
---
Switched to .50 cal. Same thing. 
---
Switched to melee. Same thing, but atleast I could damage them more than their super healing and could kill them.
---
Left the nuka zone and went elsewhere and Super mutant managed to kill me, as I couldn't damage it fast enough and it three shotted me with his hammer. Haven't died in this game for months.
---
That's because it consumes plastic to make bulk. You could just drop the plastic on the ground and it would have the same effect.
---
I don't think it's today. I believe this update is just the weekly survival gun challenges turning over. But im not 100%. I feel like it would've been mentioned in the previous "inside the vault".
---
You can't but it does sound like a decent idea to help level the field a little I honestly don't know why we have leveled items anyway
---
Exactly an example why this is so potentially useful! 
---
Is your camp at a cliff edge with lead and acid :D
---
I feel like they should drop stable flux
---
Found it there, no luck in the frat houses
---
Even without proper gear and just the right build, a black powder pistol ends them in seconds. 
---
Well, it just happens. 
---
I have only one good gun (3 star handmade) yet people occasinally want it. Typically not on trade window but outside because I do only pre-arranged trades.
---
I got one from someone and broke it down and it was unlocked for crafting on my bench. Hope I don't get into trouble.
---
A new paint plan? Hell, I haven't gotten a single paint plan, bomber jacket or science scribe outfit. 90% of the time I get like 15x 5.56 and a stimpack or something.
---
Tetris over here... \*sighs\*
---
I have seen plenty of times it mentioned that super duper won't double the extra amount got from ammosmith. It just doubles the base crafting amount without other perks.
---
Yeah but that won't fix the problem.
---
I thought that was an actual game location at first.  That's amazing!
---
Patch 8 is next week. Today's patch is msinly bug fixes fir Survival but is not patch 8.
---
Lockpick and hacking sure but nothing else. The more cards you make passive the more you lose diversity on builds. Part of playing the game is making hard choices on what to use and what not to. An inbuilt quick bar for perk switching would be nice tho
---
Bigger Spoiler Alert!!! 
---
There is a hidden,secret Chinese Communist base under Mama Dolce. It's like a communist Vault. 
---
Come back to it! I want to see you build!
---
What does it entail 
---
Removing All player markers + death markers + random spawn at stations is the solution the major exploits .
---
I‚Äôm all for leaderboards but no player markers please!
---
Also, things like lockpicking should either stack to one card or the highest one should be a level 3 card.  Why is there an "expert" that only grants 1 level of ability?  It's ridiculous.
---
Thanks! Glad to know!
---
You should be able to see in which mode the other player is, if you join him from ingame social tab.
---
I have level 1 locks in the hope it keeps out NPC. Not really sure it matters as the buggers just eat the walls.
---
Apologies! Work and stuff lol
---
This is actually old now sadly because I just moved. I'm gonna be a player vendor and I figured being way out of the way from populated areas was not gonna be good for business lol
---
But it's still a build that's close to my heart.

I love this haha. I was going to ask if I could borrow her as I'm always out of screws but realized how *wrong* that sounds. 
---
I have to train my cats to boop me when there's a clipboard or a fan on screen. 
---
You won't. You if you never entered the dev room, you'll be fine. Too many players have it, they can't ban a huge percentage of their playerbase. Even then it's not their fault if they got it from player trading. Most they'll do is remove them from player inventories.
---
Lol its not even a scam, he's just an entitled crybaby peasant who can't understand why people won't give him everything he wants for his precious caps. 
---
Your friend was correct though.  It‚Äôs a barnstar/Pennsylvania Star.  We got a lot of them up in Canada as well.
---
It‚Äôs not a communist symbol, but i suppose with this setting it could be easily mistaken as such :)
---
Love this! My partner and I have had very similar experiences! He never really loved adventure mode (even though I‚Äôm obsessed) but still played with me every now and then to hang out. But when survival came out we started brand new characters and are having a blast! He loves survival mode! 
---
I'm not the OP but I would be keen to buy several serums: Adrenal Reaction, Bird Bones, Carnivore, Chameleon, Eagle Eyes, Healing Factor, Marsupial, Plague Walker, Scaly Skin and Speed Demon.
---
I will pay 4000 caps for those 10 serums if you have the mats.
---
Yep I'm a melee and occasionally there will be a scorchbeast that refuses to land. Literally the biggest waste of time. 
---
I'm excited for all faction vendors to be in Whitesprings Resort! I can't keep walking around with 1500 lbs!!!
---
There is no banhammer for mods. They are totally safe and the official stance on ba2 mods is basically "if you break your game it's your own fault" 
---
They haven't really said exactly what's being fixed apart from an issue that would crash the game client, and looking into the survival respawning invulnerability not being active long enough. 
---
You know if you actually looked around the subreddit, you'd see posts wanting this weapon for 25k are going unanswered. Either get enough caps/trade to actually afford the gun, or quit being butt hurt when people won't take your pennies. 
---
Thank you for this!
---
It's worse when the get the spawn&gt;immediately die loop they seem to get.  Then you can hear all the explosions letting you know the loot you missex.
---
I struggle with both 800/800 stash and 1500/375 person daily.
---
Aluminium, screws, ballistic fiber, springs, plastic, copper, lead. These you are allowed to keep over 200 total. Rest of them you can sell/drop/transfer to mule, but dont keep other junk items in more than 200 if you are not planning to powercraft with them soon. Especially wood and still. Few months ago when I was level 20 I noticed I can double my stash space by removing wood and steel from it.
---
I do find Good with Salt lvl 3 pretty decent. And it slows the decay of food, but in the end it still "decays" which annoys me to no end.   
---
But I do have to agree with you on that, making canned soups/stews of our own would be totally awesome. Whole heartedly support you 100% on this idea.
---
Love this place! The decorations are great, and I love that you used the Whitespring carpet. It really gives the feel of a neighborhood dive bar striving to be better. 
---
The bartender seems friendly too. 
---
She has a set health pool of like 36k. Players joining the event does not change that
---
Times might be tricky to set up (GMT here) but we'll work something out  :)
---
In general most 1* are worth well under 1000. For a nice 1* like this, you might find someone willing to pay that much, but more likely you'll have to go down to 500 or so.
---
Honestly? All the crafting, lockpick/hacker, bartering and weight reduction perks, durability perks should be passives as they're pretty much filler cards. No reason to keep them around except to cut back on tedium and busywork to get around terrible design. If that happens, yes, there's next to no perks left any longer. So instead actually add in interesting perks that can overhaul your playstyle. Like the Friendly Fire perk. That's interesting. All the aforementioned perks? They really aren't yet they occupy a lot of slots in most loadouts. 
---
I think maybe they want some of those things to be unlockable, to show off stuff you have done for that faction. And probably not just for PvP. 
---
Done it :) 
---
For some reason i assumed I needed a high lock pick skill to do it.
---
So technically that ability already exists in the games files. 
---
Sounds good. I'm offline right now but will be back and online in less than an hour.
---
Sadly not mate. Interesting concept, but its still level restricted. Gotta work up those levels. 
---
I've gotten a few dev room items in trades (or possibly an account I bought, I've got 9 mules full of crap. Its hard to keep straight)
---
 Still have them &amp; ive not been banned yet.
---
And remove beaver teeth from auto scrapping while they're at it.
---
K mate. c u soon cheers
---
Still don't understand why we can plant gourds but not pumpkins.
---
I kind of agree with this, but then again, every lead spot would be camped at every server. If they double the camps, they should also double the resource mines. 
---
Found Murgle for the first time a while back, but for whatever reason.. he came towards me... Then died. I was beyond shattered.
---
Would make totally sense, remeber their nest where you find brahmins, deathclaws and so on?
---
They problaby eat some vault dwellers or ghouls and should've a legndary rocket launcher sticking somewhere in their ass 
---
They‚Äôre exactly the same. The amount of people playing is constant, if you increase the amount each player holds you increase the money in the circuit. It‚Äôs clear at this point you‚Äôre just feeding your ego, no one agrees with your point and you just shoot down everyone else‚Äôs. Raise the max cap limit people just hit it and carry on trading because there‚Äôs nothing to spend caps on in game 
---
vanguard?
---
750 ti settings set down to high, grass turned off in in file, played for months no problems. 
---
lol waiting for your nobel in economy
---
In a multi-player game with pvp it makes no sense to just let someone who is a high level have all the perks. Talent trees exist in most mmos for a reason 
---
Im totally not trusting any April 1 "launch codes". Additionally, I wish Bethesda made the codes look obviously fake like 11111111 
---
update your gpu driver from oem website.

Other than the stutters on first load in, I have no troubles on a 980ti, maxed settings @2560x1080.

I've also usually got discord, chrome (fb, reddit, fo76map, and my trade and tools spreadsheets) spotify/soundcloud, and occasionally a second instance of 76 (when my mule laptop is being buggy) plays at a solid 60fps. (Ryzen 5 2600x 16gb ram, sata ssd)

Yes, thank you. I just could not remember what it is called. Resistance at higher health. Thank you.

This would been one of my favorite DLC's if they did this!
---
I really hope for some greenthumb DLC, nuka cola DLC and some alien related DLC, but this is one of my most needed features now. Being able to plant inside.
---
Ive been living under a rock and just heard of player vending from OPs title here, am I blind or does that article only talk about vendors in Whitespring? üòÖ Player vendors sound friggen awesome
---
Very very nice.
---
i would love a system like this since i havent been able to settle down for longer than a few days for weeks now and the bugged moving price sometimes drains up to 160 caps in one go instead of the stated 40 caps which is still a lot for moving multiple times while looking for a new spot every few days.
---
honestly i‚Äôd be happy if it scaled the price down based on budget even to as low as 10 caps since it kind of sucks that even if your camp is empty you‚Äôll have to pay full price
---
Those are called uuids. Unique user identifiers. That are unique strings created when an account is made and for some reason the server sometimes sends that as the account name to people. 
---
How do you charge a discount? Also you said everyone else will buy at half price (Which would be a discount)
---
When this happens the body usually goes to where the spawn point was
---
I agree, endurance is a bit lacking in cool perks, I use 3 ranks of lead belly with 1 rank of cannibal because it's funny to eat other players and I needed somewhere to dump points.
---
But you made the choice the spend your level up on grabbing that card, which should be enough. You gain it but the tedious necessity of swapping the perks is stupid and pointless
---
Generally if he gets stuck just get behind him and move into him over and over. He will usually glitch through stuff if you do that
---
But you still have a limited amount of special points to spend. And you also choose a special point at the same time as you choose a card until level 50
---
Yeah even if they didn't implement the whole idea and just did move cost based on size it would be better. I can't find anywhere to permanently camp either 
---
This full-time professional writer made time to read your ramblings, and upvoted them because your story made me smile. ;-)
---
As a new player (level14) I was recommended by higher level players to come to the detonation site and just sit there. Never knew about the health increase so I will avoid it until I can pitch in. 
---
Since December last year, 2-3\* are no longer guaranteed to drop 2-3\* loot unfortunately. The chance is about 40-60% for 2\* enemies and 30-30-40% for 3\* enemies. Also Drills and Syringes don't have legendary effects and Wood is always 1\*, which all worsen your chances a bit.
---
Thanks for your response.. i am not an expert on those things but i noticed the string of random numbers and letters its the same every time i log in so i suppose its associated permanently to my account. I wonder how difficult is for the support team to change my account name to normal since is been almost a month since i ve submitted the ticket.
---
Ft defiance has a bunch of fans 
---
No, a hotfix implies that the change may have been made quickly and outside normal development and testing processes. 
---
Every company (including mine) is using this word for the same reason.
---
They only drop from critters of the small variety. You won't see them from brahmin for example
---
Shhhh like I said go rip other people off like all the others do..maybe try to be helpful instead of using people but I understand that is a foreign concept to you kid..now go along and rip people off
---
The support team has very little control to be able to do anything. Bethesda didn't really think the whole supporting an online game thing though for this so they have little to no tools to be able to help people. It's why so many people go unanswered. 
---
Trust me being good at the game is not a required element.  I forget aiming is a thing most of the time
---
I actually met my boyfriend playing 76! We met on the first beta session and have played together ever since (its a long distance thing seing as im in the uk he is in America) We love roaming the wastelands together even tjough i had to restart my character after a corrupted save
---
You're hitting either random event spots that spawn monsters or are finding spots those enemies are set to spawn at
---
The next few weekly challenges are much easier. Most of them consist of killing regular enemies, collecting stuff, completing events, or getting crits
---
Hell yeah, I‚Äôd love to put fences up. We should also be able to do the picket fences for that down home feel. Or chain link. 
---
I still feel like there should be a legendary weapon drop or even better a quest item reward with a weapon that is specificly designed to bring down the scorchedbeasts. Just like the shout from Skyrim. WWWOOOSSA!
---
HA! I'm almost level 250 with a PvP build, I mostly use an AAE/Vats Combat Shotgun with Enforcer and a TSE Handmade as a secondary and I'm pretty much useless at the SBQ.  
---
You need to have a good bloodied PvE build or something like that to do real damage to her....  
---
Level 48? Crits? Pff!  
---
Sorry to ask here, but, have they removed or planning to remove the map targets of top 3 longest survived guys? As i was not tried the game anymore after level 218 came for my level 5-8 character 5 times during 2h intereval.
---
The first time I met a gulper it was near Dyer Chemical and I'd used up all my ammo on the robots.  The only melee weapon I had was a cultists blade.
---
I'm sure they'll love their first meeting with one.
---
I suppose you are right.. they did answer that it will be fixed but i dont see it happening any time soon. Meanwhile i dont use the account since i cant really interact with people (probably most think i am some kind of bot or something lol). 
---
Yup. Surface to air spawns them constantly. If you are bloodied and stay near the fissure site, you can farm them for days.
---
Hmmm seems like you‚Äôll be making some succulent scorched beast steak
---
Theyve said a few times they are trying to figure out a way to let players do something with the extra ammo
---

Good stuff. A question.
---
Does crafted armor with high intelligence like T-51b have higher durability than found armor? How big is the difference if you think about crafting one with full unyielding set and few other boosters.
---
Good With Salt is great for food you're planning to eat, but selling it to a vendor or giving it to another player will revert it back to it's normal rate of decay.
---
Packaging would make it easier for players looking to turn their CAMPs into rest stops. They can cook up a bunch of food items, drop 'em in a vending machine and let glorious automation handle the rest. 
---
While they're out exploring Appalachia, they won't have to worry about replacing spoiled food in their vending machines every half hour.
---
i prefer my meat ironised cause it dosn't expire lol and you get it from witesprings nukes

If your router supports it, setup port Triggering, NOT forwarding, if possible.   Use same port ranges, etc as forwarding.
---
Make sure you have Power Smith and Fix It Good Perks. Power Smith reduces the amount of materials needed to craft power armor and Fix It Good..increases condition. Max them both out. 
---
The Watoga vendor, grahm, the responder vendor bot, and Mr squeeze all share the same cap pool and the legendary vendor also does currently even though he isn't spawned yet.
---
The deathclaw vendor can't be found alive and doesn't have any actual vendor pool. 
---
Yea FAL was the free world‚Äôs AK. We have an awesome handmade, now that has to be balanced! 
---
They aren‚Äôt some jack hole destroyed my camp 2 days ago.
---
If you watch the machine when you activate it and the claw adjusts itself then you've won a pie. Otherwise you lose
---
Wut
---
This is really impressive
---
Yep they do. Not seeing them highly valuable though, I drop them off if I already have learned them, to nearest vendor container. And a lot of players already have most or all.
---
Im only lvl 53 lol. I just make new stuff
---
If you ever see Census Violence at the sub station north of Watoga give it a try. I had a pretty fun time because it spawned 5 waves of 3x Deathclaws (lvl 91). If I wasn't some mutated freak flying around in the air it would have been a nightmare. 
---
It‚Äôs just like real life, when the power goes out. üòâ
---
__You can't but it does sound like a decent idea to help level the field a little I honestly don't know why we have leveled items anyway__
---
No they don't actually. The vendors pools are based on regions and some vendors have special stock. Cap pools are faction based but item pools are not. 
---
Think about it.  
---
he's just an Instigating Grushnak who got axed. 
---
He's a zetan. His legs are in the cone on the bottom of his body
---
Yes. It gives you extra carry weight when you start your game in it. The glicth goes away if you exit and re-enter.
---
It's easy xp, that's true. Tag everything and not really contribute in any other way (since you can't, realistically)... I can see why people have a problem with that.
---
*However...* I've been to a dozen or so SBQ events after she was changed and people started saying she was a bullet sponge. I never noticed a difference. We'd sometimes have 3-5 very low level people hanging about. There were no issues. We always finish the event in 5-10 minutes max.
---
Yeah we know...
---
Just curious... was it being contested at the time, and how long between the crash and you went back there?  
---
The trick is out, okay.
---
Haven't had a chance to analyse perks on the mobile but just looking at whats written and what the specials are I assume the guy knows his stuff and just publicly shared the new meta details.
---
IV been debating on doing that event for a little while, guess I should need to go after it! 
---
The should atleast make a chinese assault rifle skin dit the handmade.
---
Am I freaking out, or do their corpses follow you to a safe area?  I killed one while halfway down a cliff.  It was on top of the cliff when I fired the killshot, so I wrote it off as a loss.  A minute later, I'm on flat ground, and a scorchbeast corpse plops down in front of me.
---
The Flatwoods monster I think he's referring to. I'm level 96 and I've only ever seen it once. It was in the Mire 
---
Im going full out melee tank. White knight for sure
---
I use to do it too x)
---
Something else that I do is sometimes I keep forgetting that is an online game, so I afk on the pipboy and return on the game being dead or thirsty. 
---
Is that still in effect? I've avoided using it but I thought they would be fixed by now, since it was pretty common and seemed to even apply when other players were using it, not you.
---
Sorry for the wait. I have carnivore on my main and the others on my second character. I'll sell carnivore first and switch to the other character.
---
pmsl
---
You only think that you kept her grounded.  
---
I did a huge amount of SBQ with my main, always using a shotgun (when she's in range) with maxed out enforcer, crippling everything...  
---
Sometimes she never lands, and other times she's always on the ground... It's pretty much RNG.  
---
With all that gunfire, her limbs and wings are going to be crippled soon, shotgun or not.  
---
Lol. Youve clearly not done much trading.
---
i have a 250,000 cap limit. (2 accounts) I'm sitting on about 50k. So plenty of bank room left.
---
Everyone has caps. Know what everyone doesn't have? Decent 3* gear.  
---
Everyone can get caps, easily. Wanna guess what they can't get easily.
---
This creates a system of larger demand than supply. 
---
Wanna fix the market? Make more legendaries drop. Its the limited supply of items that causes values to rise. The perception of scarcity drives pricing.
---
I was buying TSEs for under 1k (picked a few for practically free) just after the nerf for two reasons: high supply (dupers) and low demand (because they'd just been nerfed to normal ranges) and most everyone had em.
---
Other than bloody, they're still the highest damage. Guess what happened when that massive oversupply went away?  Prices sky rocketed back up to 3-4x what they were before. 
---
Caps arent the issue. An RNG based scarcity market is.
---
They do drop just are uncommon. Also if you mod a pipe revolver with a stock and it becomes a pipe rifle it benefits from both non auto pistol and non auto rifle perks
---
Good armor can get close to PA in many things, even over like in PvP when you have good set.
---
But nothing beats PAs radiation resistance, because it has huge extra resistance that's not listed as radiation resistance.
---
I had them drop from the possum at Green County Lodge when I was there a few nights ago.
---
Why do they want to change this anyway? Like being able to get 1000 caps per day through vendors is that much. It at least motivates players to check in every day. 
---
Unless this patch also means their shared cap amount will increase I don‚Äôt get it. 
---
Also bought a second xbox so my wife and I could play together. We just bought a new house and are figuring out how to build a great double gaming living room 
---
Same.  With vault boy cutout pointing to it so they know it‚Äôs ok.
---
Good times. Played with my wife around launch. Left when it became unbearable. Likely going to come back soonish. Division 2 is on the radar though. I have it, she doesn't yet, but it's a lot of fun. Could be a great summer! Now i just need a good AC Y\_Y
---
Nothing in the atom shop is all that interesting. Buncha lame cosmetics. I still wouldn't buy em if they were 90% cheaper AND cost caps.
---
Now make the legendary vendor reroll stats for caps, and ill be through my 50k in the hour.
---
I've done this on occasion as well. Same when I go to play 4, I forget and press the wrong button.
---
It was worse when I went to play gta online though. If I went to look at the map, I pressed the pip boy button. Unfortunately on that game, this button is for punching. Got me in bother a few times, and had to keep apologising to friends when I whacked them in the face.
---
Sometimes wish all games had exactly the same controls for everything!
---
Quality of life improvement I guess. So people can spend less time in loading screens just selling items etc. 
---
Got to ask because I‚Äôm getting back into the game to hunt some sqautch... how do you take down scorchbeasts? I‚Äôm level 48 with high strength with perks boosting shotguns and melee, seemingly the two worst combat multipliers to have when facing a scorchbeast. Seemingly every weapons I have does next to nothing including missile. The thing that got me out of the game is how tanky higher level mobs become as you level up and the increased living costs on just repairing your armor and weapons. I recently switched to melee because one 1) I don‚Äôt expend resources like ammo so I can horde it for fights like scorchbeasts  and 2) it‚Äôs easier to spam stronger attacks constantly.  
---
The difference to actual effect of background radiation is very small, on nuke zone. The game barely uses those values. You can get high radiation resistance without PA too, the nominal values, but you are still sucking up rads at significant rate, if you don't have PA or the radiation suit.(forgot the exact name)
---
I don't know the case of radiation attacks.
---
I have turned up many times from level 18 thru to 80. I always throw everything I have at the SBQ, and spend a lot of alcohol reviving players (thank you quack doctor)
---
The main issue I have seen is high level characters screwing around chasing mobs instead of using their best attacks on SBQ.
---
She's on a time limit, sort her first then everything else.
---
My friends and I had her almost down and if a couple more people had weighed in, instead of chasing the 2nd and 3rd SB on the edge of the nuke, we would have had her.
---
And sometimes peeps hide in the barn to fix their gear so they can come back and help out.
---
Be kind.....
---
It seemed once i hit lvl 50 and got to use my All Rise that i was abke to school Scorch Beasts solo. Weird.
---
I find this hard to believe, I found the plans for it in the wild...
---
Ding!  Nailed it. üëçüòâ
---
No. Nothing is guaranteed to drop the weapons they use, or to use the weapons they drop.
---
Loot is instanced, so it follows from that.
---
Let‚Äôs face it, the whole game is easy. Except for SBQ I have been able to steam roll through the whole game before I hit 50 while solo.
---
noonono, you want favorites at the bottom. No more accidental scrap/selling that way
---
You didn't see small bugs to drop guns?
---
üòÇ
---
Scorchbeast queen is flying ghoul forget about good loot sometimes i dont get legendary items from here they nerf some much nuke zones doesnt make sens drop nukes...
---
They are all assigned the same texture in the files it's only the name and what scrap is produced that changes
---
I'm Ok with it, having to fast travel all over the place for daily vendor runs its boring. 
---
&gt; Stars and Stripes Forever, I believe.
---
British Grenadier actually, old chap.
---
Jeez. This is getting boring to say it over and over. Look at the roadmap. 
---
The vending machine you use will mark your camp visible.
---
That's exactly my point. You are choosing those specific  cards already, so why the need to swap them out just to utilize them? They are individually not worth special points, since you dont need perks like happy camper on all the time.
---
I'm no pleb I just got two gaming desktops so we can play together. But yeah it's a good way to play together, communication makes it simple too.
---
J/K about plebism.
---
Leather armor is so "low level" that it has higher DR than combat armor...
---
And fix it good for when you *do* need to repair.
---
I kill a ton of SBs and have also had decent stuff drop. 
---
On a sorted character (level 55+) SB aren't hard to kill. Even my unarmed build is able to shoot them out of the sky if they don't land.
---
I like free stuff but if it wasn't for this post I never would have known they were free - Bethesda's weekly update on the atom shop said they were only going to be half off. Would be nice if the update accurately previewed the week ahead on the atom shop so it could be a trusted source of information.
---
Technically, I‚Äôve found out that max level max repaired armor would have same increased DR. But, as intelligence governs durability of crafted items, higher durability means added repair bonus would stay longer, therefore damage resistance. This is subjective but at the end it would account to a few percent increase with higher intelligence 
---
It shows weight going down when you craft them.
---
Well, if you're taking full damage straight up, it makes only sense to be able to do so too, regardless of what weapon level you've got.
---
All of the required stacks have to be in the same inventory (eg if you need 5 circuits, all 5 must be together in stash or on your person. 3stash/2person wont work. it'll show as having 5/5 needed, but will give that error when crafting.)
---
Well, he didn't get a 20 cap bounty for destroying your Camp.  
---
In some way he got you in PvP with him and his team (You got a Workshop? Did you attack him back without pacifist?), when you are in PvP with another player you can destroy his Camp and won't get any bounty.  
---
Need a much larger camp budget first so I can place them..
---
I don't mind it. Where else can I killed legendaries with any real threat of injury at all. 
---
That's weird I tried there and the ones in flatwoods with zero luck.
---
I think it depends on how many things they destroyed? Don't quote me on it. Just talking from experience, as someone was obviously trolling at lvl 3 and used an orbital strike on my small, but packed house. He got a bounty at 480 caps, and it was pretty funny actually.
---
You really don't seem to understand that this is an online multi-player game and it needs something called balance. By forcing you to choose how you want to build your special points AND perk cards while also limiting the total number of special points you end up with a system that makes it so you can't just spec into everything. You have to make the conscious decision to set how you plan on playing and will be limited by the special stats you choose until you level up over 50 at which point you will be able to choose how to proceed. Get more perk cards to add or modify your current build or change special stats to attempt to make your build better. Giving everyone passive no cost perks that give tons of benefits just makes it so everyone has those and ends up throwing more of the non passive perks into their builds which also narrows the ability for people to really specialize. 
---
Very good point
---
Equally I've killed 20 and had nothing drop and can't even count the bullets I've wasted.. Given up on them..
---
improved loot would definitely be a bonus
---
Shoot them from a safe distance? 
---
I almost bought it again last night...but I resisted. Bought ESO instead.
---
Is there any use for them if you find any?  Mine just spoil and become fertilizer IIRC
---
Anti armor literally reduces the amount of damage resistance an enemy has. Energy resistance has nothing to do with that. 
---
I noticed since I first started selling but they buy it for a fraction of the value I believe , maybe wrong but you can get better prices with charisma or that perk card 
---
I have the sausage recipe so I use them for my bar for my rp character.
---
so really what your saying is you and your wife are assholes ok  got it
---
Mule characters are getting their pockets emptied
---
There is no slap damage anymore and unless you actually already had initiated pvp you wouldn't do any damage 
---
only works in pipboy though. Needs to be able to extend to stash.
---
bgs needs to add the mod to the codebase. (Like they did with known plans)
---
I have this happen all the time. Worst part is when you hear the hit effect but the game doesn't register the actual hit
---
Did it have any DR values?
---
Can confirm. Love ya even if you do kill me and eat my body half the time for food :)
---
Chew some gum - those vendors don‚Äôt like mole rat soup breath ...  ;)
---
I think once they're released, player vending is going to help me put away my excess items while not taking up the stash and having a way to get a benefit out of getting rid of it. 
---
The reason I might keep a large amount of certain resources is when I'm trying to learn weapon mods for uncommon weapon drops. Say you start a new character and early on you can get the missing child 10mm submachine gun reward. Until you get the plans for it, that's not widely dropped enough to learn many of the mods for it yet you want to be able to mod it because it's a legendary that you want to use for somewhat longer. You need a lot of spare resources though to do all that crafting and scrapping.
---
No ty I prefer my dog food 
---
Ok, tell me this. 
---
1. Lets say hard bargain costed no points, a free perk. I put it alongside my lone wanderer perk, both active at the same time. I buy from vendors without touching my perk tree.
---
2. Now normally, i would switch out lone wanderer and swap it with hard bargain before every trade, then I switch it back.
---
The *only* difference between these two acts is the fact that I had to take the time to swap them. Getting rid of that small waste of time has no adverse effects. How does this have any effect on balance for this specific utility perk (hard bargain)?
---
And please, if you want to sell or buy low value ammo, ask bethesda to either give us ability to set the price in desimals, or some other sollution. Lots of ammo trades for less than 1 caps a round. Few junk too, particularly when it becomes very available.
---
I hope lots of people grab this opportunity, and making all sorts of common stuff far more available, than it currently is.
---
Most likely not. I'm personally waiting for the instigating mirv Fatman with 50% more limb damage and faster reload :P. Also all the ones after this one are much easier
---
Treasure maps, events in the Bog, or trading with players.
---
Yeah I have it too. It seems a little bit f DoF doesn't go away even when you set the slider to minimum. It only goes away when you turn DoF off in Photo Mode.
---
I'd also like the concrete structures one of the DLC added
---
Is it me or are there less Cave Crickets in the game now? I rarely run into them in the bog and they used to be a regular enemy.
---
Love the comments, thank you.  I hope the ammo recreation is soon.  Difficult to grind out for lead and gun powder (acid).  Steel is no problem for me.  Got tons of it.
---
I do hope we can name our vendors and that they have certain aspects like food and drink won't spoil in them. An aspect like that would come at the cost of course of being unable to retrieve them after a certain amount of time has passed so people can't just use it like a personal fridge.
---
As a former truck stop janitor/maintenance man I can say there are things far worse than dead animals to clean up.
---
Uh because not everyone takes it? Yes you had to take a little extra time to swap them but that's how you chose to build your special. In a game series that is all about choices, you want to make the only real choices we as players get to make, meaningless. The short answer is the game needs balance and just because you want to be able to have perks for free doesn't mean that is a good thing. 
---
Queen Victoria wasn't around in 1689 when The Welch Regiment of Fusiliers was formed.
---
That was the spelling of "Welsh" at the time and hasn't been changed since.  The British Army doesn't like change very much, they leave that up to the Navy.
---
ok
---
Unless you use an energy weapon to deal damage. Like the Gatling laser I use deals energy damage, so energy resistance has a lot to do with it 
---
Well basically Legendary vendor will do that somewhat. I mean you need to feed that vendor with legendary items to get tokens, means you are going to buy legendary items somewhat, means you are going to use caps, means you are running out of caps, means you are going to sell items to gain caps to buy legendary items.
---
Interesting...hmmmm.  ü§î
---
thought of that too.
---
Right but I'm talking about the definion of the anti armor effect which is stated to only effect damage resistance 
---
Hah hah mods like that aren't even remotely unfair. You are perfectly safe to use all the mods you can find from Nexus.
---
This seems like a winner to me.  At least it's not a 1 to 1 ratio. 
---
And when you buy something off them for 200 caps they only get 40 caps for you sell more to them  so frustrating
---
If I give them 200 caps they should have 200 caps
---
not using a router.

It comes out 9th.

getting both.
---
I'm on pc. Can u message me a location so I can build there 
---
Yeah but even with the Hard Bargain perk maxes out you don‚Äôt get anything near what it‚Äôs worth and I don‚Äôt know why. You‚Äôd need CHR at around 19 with Hard Bargain at 3 stars to get at most 25% of the ticket price as listed in your inventory 
---
This guy did it: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a7tb75/chart_vendor_sell_prices_vs_charisma_and_hard/
---
The weapon level has no effect on the chance of learning a mod by scrapping at all. Lower level weapons cost less to craft and are usually found on lower level enemies making the grind easier. 
---
By that logic any poster with a person is a NPC. Especially the ones that hang in my camp creepily staring at me every time I bring guests over.
---
I am looking forward to selling all my known plans and other unneeded crap to other players.  
---
Junk for some, treasures for others.
---
Rocking chair or those swing benches you hang on chains for a porch.

Also, cat food bowl that acts like the Fallout 4 Brahmin feeding tub so we can have a random cat relaxing and wandering around our camp here and there.

COME ON!!!!!!   now i get "server maintenance!!"  
---
Vault Girl ready to serve is a great touch!
---
This, once I got the max rank, I have never worried about farming ballistic fiber again.
---
This is due to both the drill and syringer technically being able to have legendary effects but not having any attach slots for those legendary effects
---
That explains it
---
Yeah thats true too
---
Also look at d bigger picture. Hundreds of thousands purchased this game...only a few dozen even part exchange items. Not even hundreds of players do p/e. Only the ones really into this game do p/e. 
---
I can help when I get home 
---
&gt;My understanding is that every player participating in the event buffs the SBQ's health by a set amount (I've seen the number 10,000 thrown out in a few posts before, but not sure on the accuracy of that).
---
I believe so too. What level you are? I don't even remember anymore seeing more than 5 low levels on the entire server.
---
People occasionally fail the queen, which is fair. When you got good gear and you are higher level, it happens less and less. Should.
---
I remember finding a hollow tape in Ella Ames bunker during the Free States part of the main quest line where they were talking about how they may have found a way to force the scorch beasts to land.
---
I remember being so excited to have that tool in my arsenal and then it never went anywhere after that. It was just never talked about by Abbie or any of the brotherhood again, and I was really disappointed.
---
Heck yes - I want to make a junk yard settlement! 
---
It really isnt that hard to understand, that isnt a choice. That's a flaw in the perk system. 
---
"The only real choice" is when you level up and decide between getting what perk card +  special point. 
---
Swapping the cards isnt a decision you make for yourself. The game will throw lots of extra, random cards at you through card packs for the *sole* purpose of using them when you need it situationally, which means swapping them in when the time is right. If the game wanted you to make a real choice beforehand, they would give you an equal amount of cards as your special points. I seriously doubt even you havent taken the time to swap between cards you already own for this use of the perk system bethesda designed and  wanted you to do.
---
If you dont understand this, I'll just assume you're trolling.
---
Really great job! I‚Äôve been doing this a lot lately but not with a bar! Good idea! &lt;3
---
Only killing blows on legendary starred creatures counted. The ones you found that weren't legendary but had items, if you had waited around 10ish seconds would have morphed into a legendary. Also sometimes a diseased legendary 1 star wouldn't have a star only the disease icon but the disease icon can sometimes replace the star. 
---
I'm confused, a hotfix? I thought we were getting another full Wild Appalachia update today?
---
Divorce him
---
I found its prettty much compulsory to have hard bargain maxed out which takes 3 out of your 50 perk points out of your hands 
---
I think you should definitely get FO76 now or wait.
---
I can understand your situation and agree that perhaps there should be a scaling based on the character levels participating. I don't know how people that low of a level are even surviving in a Nuke Zone though unless they have a Rad Suit on.
---
I do have one other request/suggestion for your post though. Please, separate it into some paragraphs, it'll make it much easier to read.
---
Consider it a lawn shop.  They can't make money if they give you the actual value of the item
---
If you‚Äôre still looking to this day I have them all available to paint anytime 
---
Since all legendary items are also normal items which you can loot in the world normally they all have textures. When a legendary enemy is killed the legendary item is spawned outside the body then put in the loot pool and removed from the world. Sometimes it forgets to do the second part. 
---
Check your inventory for  
---
Ammo: Mini nukes, missiles, harpoons, 2mm EC round  
---
Aid: Big vegetables (pumpkins, melons), chems, meat, glowing mass, inert flux  
---
Junk: Beer bottles (don't autoscrap)  
---
Misc: Gunpowder  
---
All these things weigh a lot and are usually the culprit for me.
---
I usually go to an area close by to watch it fall (usually a train station). However, I never enter the actual zone as am level 34 and don't want to get in the way (nor die a lot).
---
Do the same with my wife as well fallout division 1 and 2 any co op games we are away, looking forward to world war Z 
---
Dammit wrong platform!!
---
It sucks, but you could also have 2 of each rifleman perk instead of three and lose 15% dmg.
---
I ended up not opening any locks. 
---
As I said originally lockpicking and hacker should be the only ones and should be abilities you gain as you level. If everyone gets a free perk like hard bargain then why even have it there just make it a normal mechanic which in this case is literally just lowering prices and increasing your sell prices which you should have to choose to actually do. 
---
What? He is on the record as having written Starship Troopers as political parody and wrote the Terran Federation as "good" fascists to make the reader think.
---
The book opens with them attacking alien civilians for no other reason than to demonstrate what they are militarily capable of if the aliens don't capitulate! And the history and moral philosophy classes are blatant indoctrination and come to the conclusion that it is okay to genocide entire alien races that humans don't agree with.
---
Just level up a few more times and you can swap it in only when you‚Äôre selling.
---
Yesterday I dumped 3 hours into Charleston and got nothing. It be like that.
---
Cant wait to use The Terrible Shotgun.
---
Woah!
---
That‚Äôs what the F76 Devs said during the Bethesda Game Days Fallout conference. Not just a guess on his part. I hope they can fix the performance issues with that tbh.
---
The targets will remain. But TBH if you were getting killed 5 times in only 2 hours there‚Äôs no way you were top 3 every time. So basically maybe you died for other reasons. It‚Äôs biggest problem is the spawn killing. 
---
Yeah I've only gotten bad inventories from him as well.
---
First of all, choosing to swap out hard bargain or miss out on a discount just not is not a a valid choice at all.
---
Secondly, not everybody is getting hard bargain. I had to specifically *choose* it multiple times when I leveled up to even get it. This where the real choices are.
---
You do know, that he could literally have everything you have but 5 levels lower right? And missing 2 cards. Your level means jack shit after 50 you fucking idiot.
---
It will probably take around 15 hops, like it did for me. When you get nothing it means Bethesda put you on the same server again.
---
Really cool fort design, I like the open air concept! You play on XB1? I‚Äôd like to come trade sometime 
---
Oh yeah I‚Äôm level like 70 something I can never be bothered to swap perks in and out but I guess once I hit 25k caps I‚Äôll take it out 
---
If you're on PC you can edit the ini file to actually disable it

---
Stuff being level locked has nothing to do with pvp damage levels
---
Except at some point you will have every card and then you don't have to worry about that choice you just equip all your passive perks and everyone will be able to basically build the same thing due to having those points freed up. 
---
A lot of people try it for a free fast travel and never bother you after that. One also randomly changed 1 block of concrete in my house to astroturf. 
---
Watching people launch nukes is one of my favourite pastimes in Appalachia. I too will drop what I‚Äôm doing (within reason) and go find a vantage point near the fallout zone. I‚Äôve been playing for 450+ hours since 76 released and have tried various locations for my camp. My favourite location is on the cliff overlooking missile silo Charlie. There‚Äôs not as much traffic through there like there is at Alpha, but nonetheless, it‚Äôs always a treat when someone launches a nuke less than 100 yards from your camp while sippin‚Äô some vintage nukashine after a long day of blowing shit up.
---
The next Thorpe and Rose.
---
I swear roughly 60-75% of my carry and stash weight is from legendary gear mainly armor that I don't use but don't dare sell lol

I explore it with radio off

I can hardly imagine, although I‚Äôm finding it hard not to guess ü§¢
---
They never started which patch it was coming in just in a future one
---
It's a worthy fight for me, I take em down with 3 or 4 shots in the air or not. That's an easy 500 exp with good food to cook.
---
Where is yours then?
---
To get any loot or XP you always need to damage each thing. Queen itsself doesn't give that much XP considering particularly how long it takes, it's more from the other stuff that shows up. 
---
Not saying anything about if you should or not. You might need PA at minium depending on how it was nuked.
---
I don't see a huge trend in low level players showing up and failing the event. Sometimes we fail with with lowest player being about 80 and everyone else much higher. Plenty of times we don't. 
---
I don't do it coordinated, just show up if I see it and feel like it.
---
I agree with that but, I consider ‚Äòdamage resistance‚Äô to be both Ballistic and Energy (and Radiation I guess) it never specifically says lowers ballistic damage resistance, so I believe it should apply to the energy damage side too. 
---
Technically there are four types of DR. Ballistic, energy, radiation, and poison 
---
Stop
---
The actual value for ballistic resistance is called damage resistance. 
---
It will certainly be a warm welcome. I can finally get my old FO4 naming convention back of weapons based on NES and arcade games. 
---
Pistol - Hogan's Alley
---
Machine Gun - Metal Slug X
---
Shotgun - Contra
---
Rifle - Duck Hunt
---
Laser Gun/Plasma - Samus/Metroid
---
Melee Weapon - Depends on the Weapon (Mario Bros., Gauntlet, Punch-Out, etc)
---
Ok, several people have said this, but how are we supposed to know where the spawn points are in order to go search them? Enemies walk around and could have spawned anywhere. I don't wanna search all over Morgantown for a ghoul I killed that could have spawned anywhere in town.
---
I know people love to hate the building system and it's limitations, but I see it as a challenge to bug it out to make it do what I want. It's literally the current endgame for me! 
---
&gt;Request: allow us to make a fire, and place a cooking station and sleeping bag, without destroying our whole main base of operations...
---
The upcoming backpack might have some features like that. So don't bother, wait and see.
---
Oh god someone save his mom
---
I used to. The songs are a vital character of the game for me. 
---
That was until I started on survival. Now the songs of my victims footsteps is all I need to hear. 
---
I had a setup on my roof (chairs, bbq, fire barrel) overlooking the whitespring for a while, got sick of the local scorchbeast though and moved
---
Wow there is some real wisdom in this, because that's basically what they do buy people's old crap and resell it.
---
I think doing something with the extra ammo is just player vending. 
---
It's still a bug. A lot of things have problems where the position gets messed up so it gets set to something weird. In this case it's the spawn point. For sbq it's a point outside the map. Sometimes events happen at the 0,0 area of the map instead of the correct place. 
---
&gt;Also some way of forcing them to land, even if just temporary could help balance the fights for people so every build can be at least a little bit viable in the fight.
---
MMMMMMMMUH BUILD!!!!    
---
MUUUUUUUUUUUHHHHHHHHHH BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUIIIIIIIIIILLLLLLLLLLLDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
---
I've had this bug several times the last few days. It will be present on the map but I can't see it on the compass. Especially bad if it's inside a building, then I just have to walk around at random to try and find it.  
---
Seems some quests now bug out when you are inside buildings too. I was in Sugar Grove doing the rose quest and the game thought I was still outside the building and told me to go inside, and if I went outside it would just tell me to go inside again.
---
If I had every card,
---
I would still be swapping them out. The fact that I can swap at any card I want at any given moment is already in itself, a passive. Everyone still has the same thing either way, nobody is gaing anything. There is no difference besides the chore it takes to swap them. Nobody ever fills up their main builds with utility perks like happy camper or hard bargain, they are a card that you only apply when needed. I have my agility at max and I still find myself swapping them constantly for my home defense card, which literally has no practical use in any other situation besides building. Cards like these might as well be free
---
So, that means there is no harm at all when getting rid of the swaps.
---
Thanks for the reply! I'm actually crafting them myself and scrapping them, and the lower level guns require less materials to make. That's why I was asking.
---
I don't see the logic. If someone wants to nuke your camp they would lie, then.
---
https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/npc-wojak
---
I just build near the whitespring entrances and add a few turrets. Usually allows me to ignore all attacks. Unless the robots stop talking, or I hear a SB.
---
It does not scale with the amount of people there. It is a fixed number based on her level which is always the same. 
---
The plans are 4,000 caps? Ok, but how much does the gun itself go for? Nothing goes for the same price as its plans go for. Ya know, used product and all, LoL. As much as I'd like to have this, I really don't have the caps you're asking. I can maybe pay 2,000 if you don't get a better offer than that. I'll check back later. If this is alright with you, let me know.
---
No head gear provides DR 
---
Excavator has the bonus of +100 carry weight so that‚Äôs always great if you like to carry lots around. T51b I think has the best damage resistance, and x-01 has the best all round resistance. I may be wrong but I think I‚Äôm correct. Also a lot just depends on which you like the look of, t51b has the nuka cola paint so I wear that one 
---
I wish we could actually mark locations for future discovery like you can with the survey towers in the game. You see a landmark or something odd off in the distance and pull out your binoculars. Then when you press primary fire, BOOM, the closest gray discoverable location to that targeted point is created on your map.
---
The way the mirv works is that it splits at the height of the arc. If you don't aim up a little the height of the arc is directly in front of yourself
---
They've never been too tough in any recent games, and with SBs added, they've become even more underwhelming.
---
Yes, yes, yes. I've mentioned this a lot in various posts. Love those walls.
---
I'm suspecting they will have something similar to the uplay integration that exists for ubisoft games
---
Yeah it sucks that people grief but Bethesda already said they‚Äôre workin on changes to Pacifist mode to make your camp is invulnerable as well. In the meantime just try to not take it so hard and maybe downsize your camp if it takes too much to rebuild. Take a video of it and post it on here and who knows? Maybe someone will pay the griefers a visit. 
---
You seem to enjoy the lore of fallout, just look at them as raiders and pity them for what they are. 
---
Ok so story time I worked at this little dingy truck stop for about a year and I knew a trucker that would do something he would call corking where he would just chug a whole bottle of imodium and piss in jugs. Like truckers could put so many jugs of piss they could fuel r/tendies for a year. But anyway this dude on his way back from a run would always stop and dump, I'm talking he start off with a thing he called the corkscrew it was canned prune juice and metamucel. Then he would sit in there for a whole hour. There were times I would have to pull the turd out and put it in a bag. No amount of poop knifing was sending this away.
---
I usually put mine in the ice cooler outside golf shack.
---
Why tho. The music makes it way more enjoyable for me atleast. Or is there something I'm missing with the radio on?
---
Lol
---
My understanding was that it knocks down the weight of both steel and lead when those are bulked
---
So my t51b is good, excavator will help with loot runs, what about the ultracite power armor?
---
If you want the +20 carry weight go to Flatwoods. Brahmin everywhere 
---
I honestly wish it had at least an Interior Location Map on it for when I get lost in certain interior areas or in trying to make sure I explored everything. It really ticks me off that Bethesda didn't create any interior maps for Fallout 76.
---
:) I was trying to play just when this came out, i have been in top 3 with 23 minutes alive. Believe me, its possible :D Okay, maybe in 2.5 hours, but does it change anything?
---
That‚Äôs why we have VATS ;)
---
Will do, and unfortunately I couldn‚Äôt find the gun at any vendor which is why I had to find the plan. It‚Äôs also a legendary to so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
9th day.
---
Yes because, when I alt tab only to accidently punch a bot and not be able to alt tab back in time before the entire resort falls on my head, sounds like a fun time to me
---
I run a bloodied melee build, I mean I have a gun, I think, somewhere here maybe. (Rummages through pipboy). Eh, I have a dense chest mod and fireproof and I wait for them to land then go to town. I completely ignore the sonic attacks and find an open area and wait. They land, they always land, but they won‚Äôt be flying off again. It‚Äôs fun. That dense mod makes a huge difference. 
---
Indeed. Im a new player and i see a lot of level bragging.  After 50 u can earn more cards or move points but technically we on the same power lvl huh. Just down to build setups and item drops.... 
---
I know, this post was to find out where/ how to contact Bethesda 
---
Time for lunch üôÇ I can imaging trucking across the US is not the best activity for a healthy digestive system.
---
Something should be done. Weather they become passive.  Or if they make ‚Äúdecks‚Äù that can be favorited on the favorite wheel. Just swap to combat deck when your out.  Crafting deck when you‚Äôre at your camp. And skills deck when you need to pick locks or get lower prices or hack.  
---
Ultracite has an equal or higher ballistic resistance, but XO-1 has higher energy resistance. 
---
Its a  shame that isn't a perminant thing in a specific server like games like ark and conan....
---
I hated those walls cause they couldn‚Äôt connect or even get close together.
---
I get it, that‚Äôs a pretty easy one to swap out tho since selling to vendors takes up such a small portion of the gameplay. I can‚Äôt wait to see what prestige mode is all about, here‚Äôs to hoping we can pick certain perk cards to become a permanent trait. 
---
&gt;I wish we knew more details!
---
What details you are intrested? You use the vending device, the stuff is (probably) in your stash, you mark it for sale and set price. Your camp becomes visible and highly likely fast travel target with the vending device.
---
Probably same time will come camp immunity(without response to slap).
---
I think most details are already out there.
---
Don't you have to actually break stuff to for that?
---
Ultracite I think has marginally lower damage resistance than t51b but a lot higher rad resistance so I guess more useful for nuke zones but mods are tricky to find
---
Problem with forming large community's is the fact that nothing is perminant 
---
 :/ it wild be epic if a group could make a small town that people could visit....
---
Yeah I used a modded version that actually fixed the snap points on them
---
Nah, Nothing you miss.
---
I just prefer enjoy something quietly
---
You can't really get in the way unless its an SBQ fight, and if you have PA you can enter and stay pretty safe.
---
What the fuck. 
---
And if one of the spawn locations is *in* the train station?
---
You've never experienced a nuke unless you've died from one.
---
All I‚Äôm trying to say is that if the effect can be put on an energy weapon, it should apply to that gun. Stabilized should also adjust energy damage, that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm saying
---
na I want it at the top of the list because by the time I get to the bottom of the list I'm normally just spamming sell
---
Understandable. I prefer with the radio on. It brings some life to the game imo
---
Did you not choose wisely? I agree a table like FO4 would have been useful. I'm more bothered about duplicate cards in new packs at Lvl 55 though.
---
Interesting... but that was on PC correct? I'm on XBox. I had a weird moment yesterday where someone was camping in the White Springs fire station and lit me up the moment I came by to use the bench and they did zero damage to me. They staggered me and I had to use a stim to heal a limb but I took no damage. I'm only using Assassin's without Sent or Cav.
---
You come across like an entitled whiney little bitch (idiotic lol)
---
Wah Wah Wah
---
You must have been on a pretty aggressive server with that low of life times.
---
But it sounds like you got the challenge you were looking for? It‚Äôs a real hard time out there for brand new characters. I wish you luck. As a rule I don‚Äôt kill anyone lower level than me. But some people are a bit more barbaric.
---
OMG!! Thank-you so much for such praise. Thank-you, so very much. I appreciated your patronage, and you're more than welcome back anytime.  
---
Also my apologizes about not having my headset plugged in, was about to nick off dinner when you came by and didn't want to be rude. :)
---
Two words, performance issues.
---
Have had two Xboxes since the first Xbox for my husband and I to play games once they stopped making couch co-ops.  It is the way to go.
---
No, its not a challenge at all if anyone can find me on the map, thats nonsense.
---
The legendary vendor will be popping out god tier 3 stars like no tomorrow. 
---
I mean, some people seem to act like it will. Im probably going to laugh my arse off when people see how it actually turns out.
---
This. While you do cause the SBQ to level up, there's no harm for you to enter any other nuke zone. Just try to get a few shots on the baddies before the stronger players kill them and you'll get xp.  How else are you gonna get flux too?  Get in there!
---
Lololololol. First off, we know only the location. Literally nothing about how the mole miner vendor actually works.
---
 I have over 5000lbs of gear. I wont be buying anything. I have over 50k caps, even if I stopped vendor capping, stopped selling on reddit/fb, and stopped events &amp; picking them up entirely I could still spend 150/day fast travelling and have caps at the end of the year. (I spend ~40 farming and doing cap runs, so pretty unrealistic anyway)
---
Caps are basically meaningless to me at this point. Then add the 5000 lbs of gear (every bos pa paint, super rare tse energy weapons, bloodied/ss/+str melee, etc gear) there is literally nothing in game I can't afford. and nothing in game I need. 
---
I honestly really miss the cobbled together wooden structure walls and roofs, and we can't make those all-metal tube shacks either. It's cool that you can end up making a nice home... but plenty of folks want a grungy hovel to call their own!  
---
Now that I think of it, it's funny how a bunch of folks fresh out of a vault just 25 years after the bombs can somehow build and live in better places than folks decades, or even centuries in the future. Folks who don't even bother picking up the old debris in homes they're squatting in.
---
Imo alot of them do, but I'm only 44 so theres probably some that I haven't seen yet, but like str is still melee, weight and DR for the most part, endurance is still hp and things to help you survive, intel is still crafting and hacking, etc.
---
BOS vendor sells the ultracite and, I think, plasma gun plans. Not sure about the normal laser gun, keep meaning to look for that.
---
I'm too polite to say what you come across as.
---
way to destroy my hopes and dreams guys haha 
---
Yeah, maybe I'll give it a go soon, especially if someone nukes a fairly feeble area like Morgantown. I'll just climb on a rooftop and snipe (I've got Excavator PA, but seems like I'd be able to use my hazmat suit instead).
---
Didn‚Äôt realise there was a prestige mode coming, sounds cool it‚Äôd be good if cards like that you could make permanent and have other cards to focus on things like combat taking up perks
---
My husband and I both play (only one Playstation, sadly, so never together) and he drives me insane with all the things he misses. I'm constantly pointing out stims, clipboards, and desk fans. Living with a man with PER 1 kinda sucks sometimes.
---
I won‚Äôt tell...
---
I‚Äôm level 72 and I‚Äôm probably worse off then you. I have 13 charisma points and all the perks are with being in a team and I only play in a team 25-50% of the time.
---
I run a melee build but most of my points are in intelligence and perception. I do have max strength though.
---
My perk deck is complete ass.
---
Former drunk monkey here! Tell her not to give up hope! In the twelve years I‚Äôve known my hubby, gaming has been his main hobby &amp; Fallout his favorite franchise. I always wanted to join in but had to stick to LEGO games or Rock Band, because all the ‚Äúreal games‚Äù involved me flailing around awkwardly, looking anywhere but where I needed to, getting stuck in corners, etc. 
---
When 76 was announced, he said he hoped I would at least give it a chance. I played the beta &amp; for the first time, something clicked and I finally figured out how to move &amp; look around without looking like a chimp on Nukashine. Sure, I had my moments of panicked button mashing when I encountered enemies far above my level, but that gradually improved as well. My husband quickly finished all the quests &amp; moved on to playing other games months ago (with the promise to rejoin me in the Wasteland when new content comes out), but I still play daily and LOVE it. If you would have told me last year that I‚Äôd be level 81 in an online multiplayer game &amp; actually look forward to playing each evening, I would have thought you were crazy. So there‚Äôs definitely hope, even for drunken monkeys!
---
I agree. I hope they change up how the targets work. It feels like a sloppy attempt at some sort of battle royale and all I want is a hardcore fallout 76.
---
But really, as a level 8 you are gonna lose that battle with a level 200 even if you catch him unaware. The targets suck but are not the reason for your struggle. 
---
Good.
---
Sorry buddy, PC. It is a fun design, but the amount of foundations and walls eat up a lot of budget. I originally planned for it to be 8x8, but had to settle for 7x7 to make the budget work. Hopefully player vending will put many fun camps on the map, making us appreciate the world even more. 
---
Not bad but you don't really need lockpicking attached unless you are farming (which you might well be)
---
Personally I feel they are just dead space if I'm not using them like every 2 minutes, I just activate them when I need them and use other more beneficial cards when I'm wandering about 
---
Good, only an idiot would bring a mule ONTO a pvp server. Thank you for that loot all of you out there
---
&gt;Interesting, so it appears there‚Äôs far fewer PvP servers than PVE servers? 
---
Lol wat? Of course there is. 
---
There's no idle servers empty waiting for players. Players make servers. 
---
So you think a lot of players want to play on that PvP mode, carry little to no aid items, and get camp farmed over and over any ST, because apparently the supposed spawn immunity wasn't even working. All this because you like being farmed by players with superior get, plus you can get a useless 3 star weapon if you play the weekly event.
---
You can find out on Bethesda's blog. Instigating with limb damage I believe. Its supposed to be a disabler.
---
Thanks I‚Äôll change it
---
Such an honour... I think?  
---

---
I‚Äôve been trying to talk my husband into getting a second PS4 so we can play together!  Might have to just surprise him. 
---
I got my plan from scrapping combat legs, eventually you will get it
---
Neither, both are utterly different playing styles.
---
It's actually not too difficult to find once you know where to look. Took me a bit to find it, too, because actually, it was too obvious, believe it or not. Just head to the entrance gate, you spawn here so it shouldn't be hard to miss. Then, once you walk underneath the gate, immediately turn to your right, and that's it. I believe it's just on the other side of a large hedge. The hedge obscures the cemetery's view, and is what made it difficult for me to find, and is probably what's tripping you up, as well. Should be in the general vicinity. 
---
I totally agree, I like this idea but I think it could be split even further into two separate menus, like they had in the previous Fallouts - Skills and Perks. 
---
These would define your character as who they are. Maybe even going beyond that to introduce an entirely new group/level of perk card system that would be like certain classes like Raider Enforcer or BoS Scribe that would grant a bonus/buff per level. 
---
These cards would have a loadout and would group for example, all shotgun and chems perks together for an Enforcer and you would level this up using shotguns and getting kills whilst under the influence of Psycho etc. or energy weapons, sneak perks and robot kills for a BoS Scribe. It's maybe too far down the line for this now though
---
It's up to you I just think there are much better cards to leave equipped as you don't need you unlock things all the time unless you walking around a new building and farming for caps or junk etc 
---
Yeah that makes sense though I probably don‚Äôt need it
---
whiney? Lol I only said this once,
---
looks like you are delusional, you need to check yourself sweetie xo
---
If you're on xbox, gimme a shout, can make you a serum for 100 caps =)
---
I seriously got 6000 copper and like 200 aid and others because someone ran up to my base with their mule to use my stuff
---
"choose wisely" is not the factor here, it's about rearranging your points without having to wait to level up, simple as that.
---
I mean, everytime when someone suggests something, these beta people comes in and goes like "OH we dont need that suggestion."
---
Lmao, the suggestion isnt for you, it's for the devs, time to leave!
---
i used to listen to it but havent been listening to it for months. i like to go with all music off, it‚Äôs more immersive when there‚Äôs an actual radio next to you instead of what kind of feels like listening to it with headphones. i like it that way even more now that we can place radios in our camps. 
---
if i wanna have music playing on the background while exploring or doing camp building i just have spotify on the background
---
A syringer mod would be perfect for "scorchbeast-rend"
---
Hell, even better with Biv's quests. Just fill a syringe with leadfall champagne and shoot it.
---
Best of luck, I've been after a red and blue for a couple of months now with no sign.
---
Looks like the only update happening this week (4/2 11 am EST) is bug fixes and minor tweaks. It can be found here,  [https://bethesda.net/community/topic/332797/upcoming-fallout-76-maintenance-april-2-2019](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/332797/upcoming-fallout-76-maintenance-april-2-2019?language=en&amp;attunement_sso=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6Imp3dCIsImtpZCI6InBweUJSV3pMRVpTTGVRRHdZNmVBOVBLU2pIWlc5UXRxRFBHejdocGUwWGxZYTNWbXdmaE42ckR3azFvUFJmYzUifQ.eyJidWlkIjoiMGQ4Njk3YzAtOTg1OC00NDZjLThiNDYtYWFhNTg5Y2JkMjljIiwiYm5ldF9zZXNzaW9uIjoiXCIyfDE6MHwxMDoxNTUzMTk2ODI2fDEyOmJuZXQtc2Vzc2lvbnw0NDpOV00yWm1ReE16ZzBOalkwTkRZMk16aGxNVFk1T1RsaVpXWTVORE0xWWprPXw5OTE1ZjQ1NTBmYTZlM2JhMjkzMWU5MGZhODk0ZmE4OTRlYzE1ODVhZjZkNTQ1MzJlZTNmNjNhODg5ZmNmNjFjXCIiLCJleHAiOjE1NTQyMDM4MjgsImlhdCI6MTU1NDIwMzc2OH0.BiySr_C8QfBestsCJ7pgJ1OV8dcnICniFr-VsBMqH0BCOocx6dYm534BK-0LyZe5dgkmuOc-TZSqskrlRbf-OmsE9x7r0UEI3mrFgBFYBUeKTofJH9iaYyZvclL9JUPZ5Oj-tMD0B_dl2v2Q7way7Gb6UIY-werN5n97JG2_GyFOVLSX31mYlqUfPB9RtCvfbVZwN7NscvUb7wDRtOj1NtUv47oVqOQ6Fv31V6du2LMtMa69qu47BtUpnnvPY7Bk-L8vsOB1GzCMwTfC5X2kB14rHXYwU0PRO_OqIrgWUn8uqQaaTa1r5g2fqz5n9Vybp1hVODL9P1mWU9vruzQcLw)

According to the [roadmap](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/3WheBXLAEMvTMFH70ejA9x/c38119dfaf0c67a3434df05b7d76d2c6/Fallout76_RoadMap_1920x1080_WildAppalachia-05-EN.png), April 9th is the next big update if things go on schedule, which will bring the "Sheer Terror!" cryptid quest line and player vending machines.
---
Ive only seen one and im level 30
---
Did this with my hubby for GTA 5 and haven't looked back sense. Every game we can play together we do. Including FO76 and Red Dead. Its  super refreshing as far as the game and brings us 100x closer. Were a whole gamer family, even our two kids play. 
---
it‚Äôs a 40mm grenade launcher btw
---
Oh, dude, they tore me up until I found my instigating switchblade.
---
Small fissures have ultracite ore around them. I think larges ones which are marked on map, have it too.
---
I don't see any benefit.
---
I've had my camp next to one since about December. I don't often go fetch it anyway and I've sold it to vendors, too. I don't see where you could need large amounts.
---
How do you connect the internet then, via mobile personal hot spot?
---
When player vending geta implemented, you should be able to show your camp in the map with the name, so you know what kind of items they are selling.
---
Its also not worth the trouble btw
---
My husband and I play adventure mode together all the time. It's the only way we play. I love it.
---
I dont know why they changed that. At least its just a minor thing. I cant play well in rainy weather. Server lags. Assets dont load and i occasionally have invincible enemies lol.
---
Ok well that's very depressing to hear, but thanks heaps for the information :)
---
I get that, and if you noticed I was being polite unlike some. They could have left you locked in after lvl 50. After all you can choose which to put your points into up to that level. What's the point of levelling up otherwise? Why post here if it's for the devs?
---
Crushes dreams after hours spent killing legendaries.  
---
Why?It's kinda fun to sit back on my alt , just shoot the queen once , hide and move a teeny weeny bit so I don't get kicked for inactivity.Free loot.
---
What are orbital strikes? And what‚Äôs dense? Sorry. I‚Äôm kinda new to some of the lingo 
---
The character in question is not a craft so I don‚Äôt have the Mars to endlessly do that  (though I do scrap the ones I find)
---
Every time I tell my girlfriend something like this she always says "there's no need to have two xboxs in the house" pfffft
---
Yes! I found some blocking an area off and I'm going to use it for a camp soon.
---
So you post, but don't want replies? How grown up of you.
---
That was the Marine Tactical Helmet, which is freely available and we know for sure exists. It's a different item.
---
Here's the way to obtain key
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b1fe6k/fallout_76_secret_nuka_cola_quantum_power_armor/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Sure beats the pants off the 'through the crack in the boarded up window' videos we've seen.
---
Nice work.
---
You can choose for ONE point, but not all the points, all the other mmorpg games have a rearrange button where you can change all your points around to your hearts desire, so I don't see why fallout 76 should not have it.
---
oh and also before you say that "fallout 76" is not an mmorpg, then tell the devs that they shouldn't treat this game AS a mmorpg, k thank you xo.
---
You can get that if you claim a workshop can‚Äôt you?
---
I'll have to look at that! I didn't realize there was more than one place to buy in there. I normally go to the armory. 
---
Yeah thanks, I was mainly intrested in the extra durability as then you'd need to repair less, if it were significant.
---
It's really hard to complete a good build before level 60/70, and if it's your first character it's highly possible that is full of Qol perks instead of perks for damage.
---
Even you keep all your points till you are level 50, you still have to spend all your 50 points before you can choose perks that are unlocked at level 50... 
---
And well, if you don't have hundreds of hours of gameplay spent farming and a few good trades you won't even have good armors and weapons, maybe not even mutations...
---
I'm not saying that a level 48 it's generally useless, but it is in a SBQ, unless it's a secondary character that has been cautiously planned and equipped with good stuff farmed with the main...
---
There are not enough AP points in the world for VATS to suffice... 
---
I have 96 of them in my camp.
---
Thank you for the information, I appreciate it. I also like what you've done with the plants, they fit really well with the column. Out of curiousity, there seems to be two different variants of the item... is the second one any different? I assume you've already tried it out, but I just want to make sure!
---
**Cemetery in Flatwoods:** This one's pretty easy. Just port to *Flatwoods* (W). The church (white) there is within the view of your spawn location. Head to the back of the church, and there's a little cemetery there, complete with a half broken headstone. 
---
Death is a preferable alternative to communism.
---
I think they should drop a legendary.
---
My first and only character is level 72 and my deck is so bad. And like I said level 48 is very possible to have amazing loot and a very planned perk deck.
---
The only reason mine is garbage is because I swapped to different builds like 15 times so nothing works together.
---
No shit. Perhaps you should play one of those other games then. 
---
Sounds like communist propaganda but ok
---
I just want to be able to build the big gate again!
---
Commie!
---
I don‚Äôt even need to get rich, I just want to get rid of all the shit I‚Äôve been hoarding...
---
i agree !!!!
---
so immersive
---
I currently use Cannibal and Aquagirl, but I miss Lead Belly a bunch. I don't have any points to spare to be able to use it, though. At least I have an overabundance of RadAway and a decontamination shower in my home. I could make the same argument for not needing Aquagirl, of course, but it just makes life easier for me to be able to swim across lakes rather than go round them, and to avoid wasting extra RadAway when I'm just running around exploring.
---
Do events. If you can team with a higher level, do white spring runs. But events solo help a lot.  I went from 15 to 18 in like 4 hours bouncing from event to event to work shop to event solo; with a teammate at white spring I went 2 lvl in like 15 minutes.  
---
I'm out of caps from all the fast traveling though I have all sorts of way points in my map now.
---
It would be nice to have a trombone. 
---
Can't add you as a friend due to your psn settings.
---
Alternatively, we should be able to bulk ammo. 
---
That‚Äôs okay, they come back down. üòâ
---
Except for that one that I finally found on the roof of the building behind the super duper mart. 
---
Definitely subscribing to that one!
---
Ty!
---
The toilet ones are always so amusing, so many skeletons in there too haha
---
What legendary did you get?
---
You can chew a gum while playing to stop motion sickness.
---
No shit Sherlock.We all do.
---
I'll have to go have a look for that!
---
oh!  I didnt know that.  Thanks for the tip!
---
11am est.
---
Sit down. 
---
There are so many, and some that some get which others won't, I think it would have taken me a bit to get the pied Piper one! Love it
---
How long.  Just got kicked for it
---
Been saying this from day 1. If it's knowledge, it should be passive. If it's a perk, it should be active. Once you learn something, you don't unlearn it just because you don't have a card equipped. That's just silly. 
---
Correct, it is on PC. I dont know how the game files are on console but if people do manage to get it working on PC, only a matter of time till they get it ported to console just like they do with mods. 
---
In regards to your experience yesterday, server lag perhaps? It usually happens to me at WS as well due to the multiple AI's running about, but it took at least 5 seconds after my last shot to this players head before it processed and for some reason made his body ragdoll a few car lengths away. 
---
I just hope they do fix a lot of these issues tomorrow,  especially the laggy servers. 
---
Never found it after the explosion...... 
---
Lol. I was joking. Kinda. I live my life with low AP  :)

That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve suspected for awhile now. I‚Äôve been in fights with 3 to 10+ people and it always felt the same for me. I always spend the same amount of ammo nowadays. 
---
Lol. I was joking. Kinda. I live my life with low AP :)

Are you on PS4? And how long have you been working on this? My wife and I stumbled on a CAMP a week or two ago that was very clearly a WIP bar build, and it looked really similar to this. There was no roof on it at the time, but the bar counter was built with a few tables off to the side and acoustic instruments in the corner. And there was a door behind the counter that lead outside with all the crafting benches right there. 
---
Definitely not lag because there were a bunch of others in the area that I had no problem killing. I'm starting to lean towards this being a one time type bug that they just took advantage of. 
---
Last night one of my friends told me he was unkillable for a good 4 hours a month or so ago. He had no clue how it happened and eventually had to server hop to get rid of it.
---
Honestly, it needs more music in the playlist. Suppose it costs money for Bethesda to add some more?
---
Pvp has it's own mode now, might be just what you're looking for.
---
Legendary Vendor release would be a great time to come back and farm your Legendary items to cash in (details unknown besides release date).  That said, they've been adding new things pretty often over the past month.  
---
I have pacifist on and always have, but sometimes when I auto Target people in VATS on accident, I damage them and get Wanted. Most people don't care because it's usually in the middle of a battle, but it's still annoying.
---
Good map for beginners but it still only has one location of a weapon plan and I already have it.
---
Trying to make an updated version of a map like this 
---
While i would agree fo76 seems to think that having quality of life is valid skill tree to spec into
---
I love this @lmc80
---
Best hangover ever
---
There are a lot of additional things I would like to see for CAMP building, but the number one would be Robots that could guard our camps, instead of using Turrets.
---
You spin me right round baby right round 
---
I wish endurance had more perks directly related to being more tanky. Like one that gives you damage resist at full health so the first hit you take is significantly weaker. Or more of those Day/night perks with effects that are more attuned to damage dealing. 
---
I feel ya. Caps can't come fast enough can they.
---
Lure 'em towards a surface-to-air battery, Watoga or The Whitespring. The missiles/robots both whittle them down and keep them distracted.
---
New character required? In this case I'm down! 
---
You just gave me a wonderful idea for survival mode.
---
http://imgur.com/a/3wq0GCh
---
Launched quite a few and still not bored of them!
---
&gt; If it could be a basic square or rectangle, it would make planning and building so much easier.
---
If it goes this round, i'd love the option to "snap" to the edge line, instead of trying to line it up perfectly only to get 3 pieces down and realize you're at a very slight angle so nothing else will line up correctly.....
---
I miss those so much! These puny little fences just ain't cuttin it anymore. I want my base protected
---
The levels will start coming faster for you pretty soon.
---
If you haven't already, start roaming the western edge of the Divide and the Ash Heap.  
---
You'll get some higher level enemies for more XP, especailly if a higher level player has been around.  
---
Theres probably several places in the forest you haven't found.  
---
  As someone else said, you should be able to venture into whitesprings, but it will be challenging, especially if it has been nuked recently.  You will likely die more than once unless you have someone with you.  Power armor helps, as does a good melee weapon.
---
Easy in the sense that they aren't tricky.  Not easy in that it can be a fair bit of effort.  And you usually get nothing worthwhile for the effort.
---
Thanks for the offer! I know they are rare, but I will wait to find one or wait to buy from someone that doesn't have so much invested :) 
---
Good luck to you too :)
---
If your on PC I'll launch one just for you, and I'll even have you tag along and have you tag the queen then keep you inside C9 for safety. 
---
I remember being a low lvl hiding from the robots at watoga to keep them from murdering me. 1st SBQ fight i joined i was only lvl 12, the darn quest popped up and had an option to join event. I spent all my caps to join only to spawn in a nuke zone and die after taking a few shots at the queen, respawned at the nearby bunker only to killed by a tick. I was one of those persistent noobs that hack away at lvl 60+ scorched with a hatchet and couldn't even kill it.
---
So whenever I see a noob trying i usually give them a legendary they can use after the event. 
---
Until they say so. 
---
I just got my second character up to level 42 yesterday, hoping to hit 50 in the next couple of days. 
---
What I have been doing is logging out near a workshop, so when I log in, I take it. Then as I'm crossing the map to do the quests, I'll take other workshops and different events.
---
That way the workshops are good fast travel nodes for getting back around for free, and I can drop my camp wherever as I move along.
---
That's gotta be the most harmless yet hilarious thing I've seen happen to a fast travel team.
---
"What's new?"
---
"Oh nothing. Just the usual, couple folks teleported over to me. Oh, and one changed a floor tile to astroturf."
---
It's a feature not a bug. 
---
I recently levelled a new alt character, you need to kill stuff higher than your level. It's as simple as that.
---
Do the whitesprings ghoul loop - you can blow up cars and use the robots to help out. You may also find higher level players who will let you tag stuff before they kill them
---
Other locations I used were Harpers Ferry and Watoga.
---
What platform are you?
---
You can carry your current character over or create a new one the choice is completely up to you.
---
The game didn't even tell me when my base was under attack I just noticed there was somebody at my base and there warrant kept going higher and higher, by the time I got back him and my base we're gone 
---
Yes- provided they snap together now. Used to drive me insane trying to line those up so there werent huge gaps between fence pieces.
---
I regret not taking a photo when I was there.
---
Do /u/Bkizz
---
&gt;  and nothing in game I need 
---
There's your problem. You are just past the point where you no longer have need for caps to buy anything. Even if you removed the caps limit, that wouldn't change anything for you, because even if you have 100 000 caps, you wouldn't still have anything to buy, because there is nothing you need. In your case, this is not economical thing but rather lack of content.
---
:-) and getting murdered in the process
---
Eh I use the green ones instead of fence, it works just fine. 
---
If you feel like you already did everything and just want new stuff. Not yet. Player vending is next week.
---
Fighting off hordes of mutated creatures while listening to jolly 40's and 50's music is what Fallout is to me. I think the music is a big part of this series. 
---
For maintenance I assume
---
As Fellow Aussie, the most impressive part of this post is you have a stable enough internet connection to both post on Reddit **AND** play FO76. 
---
I'm on Xbox. I've been to White spring briefly for a quest and not even heard of the other two places yet. 
---
It could just be for server maintenance, if there is an update there will be patch notes released with the next few hours.
---
Won‚Äôt player vending break the balance of the game?  If we can sell plans or mods or stimpacks or junk, then people will be doing events and exploring far less, right?    Some perk cards would become useless. 
---
Strongly disagree. Crippling her does force her to land and if you fully cripple her she won't even attack. Perhaps in the past there was more RNG but the shotgun cripple strat feels very consistent, to me at least.
---
What's the purpose of an alt in this? 
---
With Player vending coming soon, you should have no trouble finding them, if you're on XB1, I probably have some I could sell you.
---
I'd love to have various lapel pins as visual mods for outfits
---
I think it's so you can easily equip one or two ranks while leaving a third slot free for something else, and swapping out when you need the third rank.
---
But as it turns out, ain't nobody got time for that shit.
---
Actually would rather not have a very annoying alarm please
---
Thanks! And yes, the other variant is VT logo. I think they do this with atomic shop objects that would be built with similar materials.
---
Your wife is basically a brotherhood scribe. 
---
I can't help wondering if this kind of thing will be part of the upcoming 'prestige' system...
---
I feel I do need to warn you though in its current beta state you stand to lose 380 caps per death at level 190 along with junk and random amounts of aid items.
---
Player vendors? Where do i read up on that?
---
This would be so OP though. Things like disease cures are meant to be rare, if you can just pick them from your camp it loses its value
---
Thanks for taking the time to reply,was hoping for some good insight like that.
---
I could have up to 250k. (2 accounts. One specifically for holding gear. I literally paid to extend my stash space.)
---
youre just restating my point... its not an issue of caps or economy, but RNG in a scarcity environment. 
---
I am sure I kept her grounded.
---
Nearly 3 months ago almost all players were melee without OP weapons. The queen was escaping most of the times. I went there and on her first landing I only crippled her wings and proceeded to follow her around with my super sledge, dealing next to none damage. In a 30 seconds or a minute she toon off, with barely scratched hp bar. I switched to my shotty and proceeded to vats crit her wings until she landed. And then I was only using shotgun to cripple her wings using vats to see their state. Lower limbs were optional. Regularly switching sides and verifying that her limbs are crippled by using vats as often as I can. And only after my shotty was broken, she started moving and shortly after that took off, but with less than 10% hp left. So I am quite sure I kept her grounded. Because the next time she landed she strolled a bit before we finally killed her. And I was the only one using shotgun there.
---
I actually met my fiance through this game. Well, it wasn't out yet when we first started talking, but we were both in a facebook group for the Fallout games, and met on there. He lived in Utah, I live in Ohio. We started playing the BETA together, started talking on the phone, etc.
---
Next thing I know, he moved out to Ohio to live with me and start our lives together.
---
Its super crazy but so much fun. 
---
We still play together (my ps4 is in the living room, his is in my daughters room) several times a week. 
---
Yup, after I while I realised that there is simply *never* any thing in them that I can't just as easily get elsewhere without faffing around with perks.
---
People camp lead mines? I always see them empty, every time. You want lead, try Hornwright Executive Tower (~75-80 units) or Monorail elevator (~110-120 units)
---
Thank you! I will test both methods if my router supports them to see the difference.
---
If they do add a respec option it better not be free.
---
Choices you make should matter. 
---
&gt; the developers doesnt want us to have ALL the perk cards we're being given (idiotic lol)
---
Idiotic?  So you're saying every person should have every build available in the game at all times?
---
Thanks. This really helped
---
We did the same, but with Playstation, I started on Xbox he liked PS4's VR and got it with Fallout 76...then eventually I got a PS4 with Fallout (technically we bought the dang game 3 times). We love it, he is level 152 Im 118 it is alot of fun regardless of the game breaking bugs and issues. He used to never really be into video games and at first it was a little painful to watch him aim the camera, then move then stop then re-aim the camera since he hasn't played much if any console gaming. Now he can hold his own with the best of them.
---
They blow the dust out of the racks and polish the cases, then run CCleaner and windows defender.
---
Cool! I've been using a very similar fort design (based on Fort Chambly in Quebec) pretty much since launch.
---
However, mine has an 8x8 footprint and trying to balance decoration and essential objects for crafting, food and water is... frustrating, to say the least.
---
Purified water should be a rarity too but we can build a few giant ass purifiers and make a bunch, so this isn't any different. 
---

I wasn‚Äôt aware there were shiny cards

Can't wait to see the confusion on people's faces when trading! "What the fuck ammo do I need for the grannysmasher" 
---
The mentioned a couple bugs on social. "This update includes a fix for an issue that could cause the game client to crash and will also address an issue affecting the invulnerability effect applied to Survival mode characters after Fast Traveling or Respawning." - direct from Bethesda Support 
---
If you get bored easily I‚Äôd wait and go play something else why we have fun exploring and killing each other.
---
Experimenting with a new build without having to take my high level character and get them ANOTHER 50+ levels to get into the new build, then another 50 back if I don't like it. Currently I'm a bloodied 2H Melee build with power armor and mutations to support it.
---
So if I wanted to switch, I basically have to drop all my mutations because many of them hurt ranged accuracy. Then I'd need to get up 40 points of SPECIAL redistribution, and then however many of the perk cards I don't have for a different build.
---
It's just much easier to build a new character for it.
---
Plus the first time through the game I broke the sequence on quests and went straight to the Enclave before doing several other questlines. This time around I kept the main questline in order.
---
And I can take more time to read all the lore I missed the first time around.
---
Those are a few reasons anyways. I'm sure other people could have other reasons.
---
No problem I do what I can üëçüèª but it‚Äôs probably just server stability and maintenance across the board, the next patch should roll out next Tuesday when they implement player vending 
---
The nuka cap gun....its in the sign. Wtf
---
Yeah, I started planning for 8x8 but cut down to 7x7 for more decorations and utility. Lets hope they increase the budget in the future.
---
Well the names are strictly client side, so no one will ever see the names. I am just glad I can organize better with it.
---
Everyone got the compressed air cans rdy!
---
No, I just think that they should give us a few more perk points rather than just a few to play around with, besides, people already have "every build avaible" in the game anyways, soooo?..
---
There are pros and cons to all the PAs, I had all of them but I needed to cut down for my stash limit so I now just have 3 - **T-51b, X-01** and **Excavator**
---
**T-51b** for all non-nuke battles - Best Energy Resistance and Damage Resistance, but the Rad Resistance is poor.
---
**X-01** for all nuke battles - Best rad resistance, has equal energy resistance to T-51b but not as good damage resistance.
---
**Excavator** for when I need a lot of carry weight and am mining ores as you get bonus ores in this suit.
---
Some people will advise against the **T-51b** due to repair costs but with Power Patcher and the fact that PA seems to last forever anyway I don't have a problem. Also you can acquire plans for all of the mods you need from the vendors rather than killing the queen 100 times for the ultracite mods.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind joining. My psn is ObesePigeon1.
---
But some are plan-only, so this wouldn't help
---
Starting at¬†11:00 a.m. EDT on Tuesday, April 2,¬†we‚Äôre planning to bring Fallout 76 offline across all platforms to perform maintenance and apply a hotfix. This update includes a fix for an issue that could cause the game client to crash and will also address an issue affecting the invulnerability effect applied to Survival mode characters after Fast Traveling or Respawning.
---
I thought the gold cards were just rare to get in the packs, not more special than picking them yourself

That's the response I get when I know i'm right

Did Bethesda fix the game yet?
---
I was going to offer some help to level if you were on PC :)
---
I have seen xbox players on here offering to help level up.
---
I'm glad that they're no longer endlessly spamming us with their green donut screech.

Damn Fault 76 made most of us mutes ... and they said it was a control vault ;)
---
Yeh the animated ones. You should have some :)

Static in a can ü§ó
---
&gt;"Beta mode" for Bethesda basically means the game isn't finished
---
As opposed to beta meaning a finished game for other companies?
---
It's not clever to call out people for reacting fairly when your idea just isn't good. There's a balance in the game which can make it difficult to play some builds, but easy to re-spec into. By doing what you're saying, that challenge is entirely ruined. Additionally, you say it's idiotic that we dont have your system. It's no wonder people who like the current system and telling you that your plan is bad. What did you expect?
---
Looks like they're fixing the spawn camping problem.  Can't wait to hear all the whiny posts from all the scrubs that were doing it.
---
Well every week have new chalenges and unique events, you are losing a lot of contend...
---
Good doggy at level 8.
---
So it's about who's right now. Here's me thinking it was a suggestion.
---
Nice thinking, how'd you break under the map in the first place?
---
I was running around with 300+ carry weight (255 limit at the time) constantly for about a month or so. Couldn't figure for the life of me where the culprit was. Was cutting down on the amount of loot I picked up and focusing on getting plastic to bulk and consequently sell excess junk. Still didn't help as much. 
---
Only carried 2-3 (maybe 4) weapons and scrapped everything else. All armor pieces with "pocketed" (haven't found "deep pocketed yet").
---
Then I found out that I'd been lugging around close to 100 or so Stimpaks and such, (Stims weight 1 each). Most of my extra weight had been caused by the Stims. Same with at least 100 Radaways and Rad-X. Getting rid of them brought me back under carry capacity. 
---
So yeah, an easy way to see where the excess weight comes from would be pretty good.
---
Yeah thats pretty interesting, and especially when someone figures out how to recreate that bug to exploit it to their advantage, then sucks for us that don't know how to counter it. 
---
Did you wait for the Pip-Boy or did you just get irritated and quit? Because that blank Pip-Boy thing always clears up for me after a moment or two. 
---
Yep that's one of the other sollutions I was thinking about.
---
Unfortunately no.
---
Yes it does. The counter for me is the same one I use for chameleon glitch/stealth boy spammers... kill one and bug out to a new server.
---
No new content, but hey at least I can sell stuff to people ya boi
---
Isn't radiation resistance only used for attacks that do radiation damage, not general background radiation?
---
They're not. But for a completionist there is value in them
---
You literally get one every perk pack
---
They do 
---
Update: The blocks spell out ‚ÄúP L U G H‚Äù. Given the skull immediately below it, we believe this to be a grave marker. Still an awesome detail to spot!
---
I‚Äôm sure that looks awesome and will be a cool shop to visit!
---
Awesome, thanks for link and info!
---
Gasp! Wait, I think recognise that name. Are you the wonderful person I met the other night during Hunter/Hunted when we all got stuck in PvP after the event was finished? The one who was showing me all the beautiful outfits while we hung out in my home near Pleasant Valley station for a little while?
---
Some have body parts in them. 
---
I hope it isn't like RDR2 where half the names aren't allowed 
---
Yeah!!!!  That will make life so much easier!  Plus I believe it will start drawing more people to that area for trading
---
Theres quite a bit of items and mods from FO4 that I'd love to see, SIM Settlements is one of them.
---
When I first started playing it was awesome to watch, I'd do that too. These days, as soon as I see 'death from above' I immediately begin prepping my nuke zone equipment in the hopes of finally getting a good legendary for my build
---
Concrete barriers (the tall ones). They snap together and are sized so you can fit floors in them. I have a walled garden connected to my base with them with a deck above the garden and that deck is where my brahmin and artillery are.
---
Flip it around to be more accurate.
---
I always saw monsters drop the weapons and armor they were using against me. 
---
Hey man if you still want this I did check last night and I have a furious plasma 1 star max level. Let me know what you‚Äôd pay for it if you‚Äôre still looking for one.
---
Many symbols, like five-pointed-red-stars, are used by more than one culture and therefore have different meanings depending upon context. If there's a hammer and sickle in the red-star, it's unambiguously communist. With a crescent moon, it would be more likely related to the Ottoman Empire. Unadorned it could be a barnstar, or the logo of Macy's department store, or Texaco. There are lots of red stars. 
---
&gt;people already have "every build avaible" in the game anyways, soooo?..
---
Incou can have every perk card available but your special points have to be arranged in a certain way.
---
 Right now you don't have every build available at all times because you have to use level points to rearrange special points.
---
Did you ever end up testing this?
---
Its a really rare occurance lol
---
Very great point!  1 cap per round still seems like too high of a price.
---
Bulking would be a great option for that as well.
---
This is my SO. She picked up fallout 4 and was awful. I don‚Äôt blame her, I‚Äôve had a lifetime of experience to get where I am and new games can still be strange to get use to. 
---
I thought she was just trying to be nice towards my hobby and I never really thought it would stick.... until one day I woke up at 4/5ish AM and didn‚Äôt know where she was. Walked out to the living area and there she is. She had her first, ‚Äúit‚Äôs what time?!? Where the hell did the time go,‚Äù moment. I think I shed a tear. 
---
In all seriousness, it‚Äôs really cool to see a brand new gamer play the FO series. She highlighted parts of the game that I never utilized or appreciated. 
---
The idea isn't good to their standards cause their standards of a suggestion is probably lackluster, but its whatever, everytime when someone suggests something it always gets knocked down by a bunch of haters or kids, like I said, it's not for you, its for the devs, xo.
---
Yeah and since Bethesda have ruined their game nerfing the TSEs , now it almost is never even attempted because of how sheerly difficult , almost impossible , it is and how crap the rewards are for beating it.
---
This makes it so everybody can't play every role at all times, the way it should be.
---
It's a marked area on the map, wouldn't that mean you cannot place your CAMP there?
---
Harder to detect while sneaking armor mod allows situations where you are visible yet enemy player can't VATS you. Tested yesterday. I was circling my friend that did not have max perception and I was visible but sneaking and he was incapable to use vats against me. Prices will go up.
---
Throwable commie whacker.
---
Mole head has a DR of 1...
---
Good question.  Not sure if they could see the item or not.
---
Oh boi they didn't change that horrible cap reward yet? 
---
I was better of with getting a 10cap bounty before starting PVP lmao. Random amounts of items? Ammunition aswell? Sounds interesting!
---
Might wait till I try PvP mode. Bought the game for PvE anyway, and beside the enormous amount of bugs I had a great time and I'm looking forward to come back in the future. 
---
Awesome story! Should be documented and edited for youtube :D funny moments etc.
---
Since it's a game structure I don't think you can set your camp there. Would be pretty cool though! 
---
Good point!  I‚Äôm also foreseeing a weight limit in the vendor machines as well.  
---
But having the ability for the food not to spoil could create more food vendors and restaurants in the world
---
I personally leave them to suffer for eternity.
---
This isnt him right?

Nope. 76 has concrete barricades you can put up, but there was a whole kit of concrete architecture you could build with in Fallout 4's Wasteland Workshop DLC. You could make some neat bunker-style housing, and it was much easier to build with than the wooden and metal shack kits the game launched with. 
---
76's architecture kits are also easy to work with, but sheer concrete walls would be great.
---
Yeah!  Plans weighing .25 pounds has been weighing me down for some time.
---
But they are paper gold for some.  
---
I am? What content are you talking about? Atom points/ Store? 
---
Ha!  It just seems like a waste to drop it on the ground and throw it a way.
---
I think higher level enemies need to be more complex,
---
That is to say give them special abilities that are on cooldowns and allow them to do things low level enemies can't
---
Example, summon minions, throw a big rock, or other such utilities that let top end enemies be more than simple sponges that run at you and hit you in the face like early game enemies, but harder.
---
Let level 90 deathclaws summon special level 20 deathclaws to fight with them, give them a dodge, a charge where they move at turbo speed, let them throw dirt that actually does something, anything other than run forward and hit things
---
The flatwoods monster's mind control is awesome, give us more of those
---
Don‚Äôt be so pessimistic bro. 
---
Im sure if we put our minds together we can do anything.
---
Sounds like it‚Äôll be viable to power level a bit
---
LEGENDARY ???????????    had to shoot this guy first time (blocked the only door)  turns up again in the middle of the bog nuke zone (along with 4 68 beast,1 98 deathclaw,6 68 gulpers,1 bitch assaultron,1 55 gutsy,and  the minions.All at the same time.  PLEASE WAIT............. Turns up again, and finally insults me and walks away.
---
WHAT LEGENDARY ?   should I have killed him again or wot  ?
---
Would be cool if you could mark targets for teammates.
---
It did cost me, my first born son, my third cousin half removed... And about three weeks of arguing with **~~\*Telstra\*~~**
---
Jup, I think the inventory for the vendors differs per room, so be sure to check them all. All the terminals in the same room have the same stuff though. 
---
They seem to expire on any log out, if I remember right.  Not just disconnects.  So guess it depends on your definition of intended?  Is it how it works?  Seems so.  Is it the end results the developers truly desired?  Maybe?
---
Good idea with a high lvl DC having some minions, I've only come across the flatwoods monster once and the battle was short and in my favor. I don't however recall it's level....
---
My wife and I did the same thing on the PS4. So much fun playing online with her. Worth every penny.  She‚Äôs even pretty good at FortNite as well. 
---
Wait are the uniforms rare? I‚Äôve just been selling them to vendors.
---
Vending machine shouldn‚Äôt be tied with CAMP
---
It'll just disappear into your inventory after a while
---
So do we. Friend me. Name is the same as here on Reddit. 
---
You can leave it there, until it automatically goes back to your inventory.  It will not stay permanently.
---
No one can steal it unless you use the Drop command.  Always set it down using Place, that way it stays tied to your character.
---
Awh man that sucks, thanks though!
---
But you could nuke those junk fences and not a scratch.
---
I know this is an older thread but I've been stuck on this quest for ages now. So the issue still exists, I go to the location where you need to get through the door, the radio buzzes a few times like its about to begin some Rose voice over, then nothing. Tried all the solutions I could find.
---
Yes this! I dont use a Mic generally and it would be nice to be able to chat with short messages to someone...
---
I‚Äôm hoping not.  Currently people are selling items through external vendors (reddit market places). So I‚Äôm hoping that this will bring much of the vending back to the game.
---
Please I‚Äôm hoping it stays to make small little towns for shopping by he players!  I‚Äôve already got my spot picked out.
---
:-)
---
Not only Atom items, theres some nice one week events like Fashnacht, and some other upcoming (check teh Bethesda roadmap) i think you shoud log in the game at least one time every week to check the content.
---
The coloured ones, not the white and dirty white variants
---
Jumping top comments to say that they regularly hide in the shacks nearby, which is why the SBQ doesn't land!
---
Ah okay, how long until it automatically transfers to my inventory?
---
I‚Äôm surprised it isn‚Äôt worse actually. Having played a lot of Fortnite before this, it will almost certainly go down hill. Saving grace is there are no free vbucks. 
---
No they haven't, you'll go broke quick in survival quick.
---
Just aid items in ike stims and what not. I don't deal with even half the bugs others do aside from the rare random dc so I can't speak on those.
---
Hooo they released a road map?! No wayyy!
---
Thanks man I'll make sure to take a look at it and upcoming events!! 
---
If u picklock you actually invading his camp and will be flagged, i did one time and got wanted
---
One of the most wholesome posts on reddit. 
---
Yeah the server doesn't have hard level caps but you see clear differences with level 100 character, and level 5 mule, on the average player levels.
---
I have about 1200 pounds of almost entirely \*\* and \*\*\* gear waiting ... plus a few \* items that the game gives a high cap value that I held onto in case the caps value plays into the token system for the Purveyor.
---
Go to Bethesda‚Äôs fallout 76 roadmap.  
---
If anyone has seen more details concerning the vending machines or player vendors, I‚Äôd love to get a link and more info too.
---
I sell most plans for around 75% of their list price
---
I will be on around 5:30pm CDT (9 hours from now)
---
GT: Medieval Paul
---
Send me a message on XBL, and I will see which ones I have when I get on.
---
I would love it if turrets could defend my base.  Why level 15 Todd?  Why?
---
Yes, some nice new contend coming ;) 
---
then again, it shouldn't matter if we can just have a button to rechange all the points around instead of having to wait a level, it's clearly dumb.
---
It will certainly making trading a lot more convenient for sure!
---
I aim only like 20% if the tume other than that i just use a shotgun up close
---
Ah, I knew I was a little fuzzy on the details but didn't think I was that far off.  Plugh seems like an unusual spelling, but not 
---
That article doesn't talk about player vending, only faction vendors, but the comment above yours does.
---
Pretty sure 60 seconds or less. Don't remember exactly
---
I'd love to have the spray n pray in 76.its still my favorite gun in fo4. I haven't seen any legendary Tommy's in 76.
---
Damn, thats 00:30 for me. Just a little bit late
---
Junk walls. Bring back junk walls. And scrappier wood and metal pieces. I don't want a lovely house with a lovely view, I want a post-apocalyptic crap shack with a lovely view.
---
You know what I meant dude. 
---
Never once noticed this in 143 levels lol
---
&gt; I can't recall seeing this suggestion before.
---
lol.  
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/search?q=loadout&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all
---
1.)Your own opinion.
---
2.) Also your own opinion.
---
3.) Yes 
---
&gt;You can just sort by weight in each tab while going through your stash.
---
This isn't very useful in the Junk/Aid categories.  Sort by Weight only sorts by the weight of the individual item.  So that 1 Bulk is placed up high on the top of the list, but the 600 Lead you have is down near the very bottom.
---
This, coupled with the Weight attribute of items while in your Stash still reflecting your Personal Inventory Perk reductions (which don't apply to Stashes) can make it a little less clear on what is actually taking up so much weight in your Stash at times.
---
That item that is a 20 stack of 0.25 may actually be a 20 stack of 2.5, and weight much more than the 1 item stack of 5.0 that is sorted well above it by weight.
---
The User Interface of the Stash and how it displayed item info can leave a lot to be desired at times.
---
They are a joke and have been since I was low level...
---
That marine helmet in question provides DR. If they ever made it exist naturally in game they‚Äôd probably remove the DR
---
NexusMods hosts 215,941 files for 667 games. That's why I don't even have a console. There's just so much consoles miss out on.

Well it can look good at my base for about a minute then lol thanks!

Damn straight!

ultracite is dam close to unbreakable.don't know about x01,but 2 repairs only, in 200hrs+

and not too much repair cost.  just thought i'd metion

Gromnir say
---
Shame low level squishy thing help queen.
---
Real reason low level squishy things should be there to sacrifice them. Move out...draw fire....die for the good of others.  Why else have rank of private?  
---
Eh, maybe send in the clowns wait they are here 
---
Ha! Good fun!
---
Hellfire power armor and incinerator weapon.
---
If they had the x-01 as a prototype the other corrupted data in the enclave bunker could have been these 
---
A bit more than 60 seconds.  Shortly after exiting or leaving a power armor, you will get a pop up message saying it will be automatically returned in 60 seconds.  Then 30, then 10 (or something like that).  And then no matter where you are it gets popped back into your inventory and disappears from the ground.
---
I'm hoping at some point we will get the ability to store them in racks so we can also display them.
---
what do u mean, back in the days two shot explosive shotgun would one shot almost anyone, is there anything stronger right now?
---
I'm off on Friday, we can catch up then if you still need them
---
Ouchüò¨ I have the perk that reduces chem weight thankfully. But I typically sell any excess radaway or any other chem anyways. It seems as if I never have enough stims until just last night actually. I found 5 of them in one spot, and then a workshop takeover gave me like 3 or 4 and then the defense gave me like 3 or 4 and then I found a couple more and then now I'm at 40ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. But my carry weight issue started before this so I'm not terribly concerned with the amount of them I'm carrying at the moment. My only problem with this is that I'm almost level 50. I want to run around in level 50 Ultracite PA, not level 25 Excavator just for the weight. Kinda frustrating
---
It is not dumb. It matters because you are essentially giving every single person every single build to use any time they want.  You don't see a problem with that ?
---
  I'm all for a respec button but it has to cost an arm and a leg to do it.  I am completely against being able to reset your points at anytime. 
---
 The choices you make leveling up should matter and they do.
---
Infinite caps would drive their value down even faster. They are too easy to aquire, that's why they don't have much value. Someone who plays daily has a income of 10,000 caps a week, thats just from selling to vendor bots.
---
Just make sure you‚Äôre exiting it not dropping it or people can take it. 
---
Maybe instead of a new card, they just alter stabilized to work in or out of power armor 
---
I bought it at watoga this weekend,  I'm level 75 
---
I've looked into it. Gunpowder is a total of less than 10 lbs in my inventory currently
---
One, that‚Äôs the way real life works, you always pay far more for something than you can sell it back to the vendor for. 
---
But here it is to extend the grind. Everything is, from the horrible exchange rates, cap limits, higher junk input to craft and lower junk content from scraping. 
---
This is true. I scrapped maybe seven or eight 50 caliber HMGs before I unlocked the heavy barrel mod for it. The only mod available I believe.
---
yep but how do get people to join
---
nah, they're easy - just do what i do...RUN!!!
---
I play with headphones and turn off every radio I find.......  whats that.    a noise
---
come out     come out
---
I've .etc him 3 times but he doesn't do anything for me. One time he was chasing another player who locked himself into a room. I watched for awhile but nothing happened. Please enlighten me 
---
Adding you thanks dude 
---
I haven't played for about 2 months now but I've been keeping an eye on this sub. It's going to be a totally different game from when I last played.
---
Technically it's almost impossible to have a solid build by 50.
---
You can't save levels up for cards at higher levels. For example, at level 6 you unlock "Slugger," but you can't 'hold the points' from level 4 and 5, then dump 3 points at 6 - the earliest you can ever get Slugger with 3 points is at Level 8.
---
Plus for something like adrenaline, you literally couldn't max that out prior to level 53, assuming nothing else needed to be ranked up in that range.
---
Hopefully he some some awesome things to produce and trade.  Plus I‚Äôm hopeful that the exchange rate for started items to mods will be reasonable
---
Looks like you‚Äôre sitting pretty good and ready for his arrival
---
I want everything back from fo4
---
We need Taps in game 
---
As far as I know they are global spawns. Meaning anyone can pick them up, if you haven‚Äôt seen them in the same spot more than likely someone else picked them up.
---
I never really yoused it so no üëé
---
I walk everywhere. I am now lvl 98 and have not used fast travel except 2 times I think this whole time? 
---
Sometimes it happens, PC. I didn't notice that it only happened with melee weapons but it happens.
---
There's a raider camp a Ross from Seneca rocks that spawns 2 or 3 rotating recipes, I used to camp near there just to farm recipes. They seemed to update at least once a real life day.
---
Why would they do that? 
---
Same here, she‚Äôs like a co-pilot. My wife points out the hidden enemies and items and stuff that I would normally miss.
---
i was level 10 when i did my first nuke zone. Had my buffs and hazmat suit on. Ran in, tagged a ton of enemies came out with like 10 levels. 
---
Would do it again, every time.
---
I think that's why they made them like this. Huge aggro range, persistent chase, additional spawns, they made them out to be the terrors of the wateland on purpose.
---
They die pretty easily at higher levels, so at some point they become more of a nuisance, than a problem.
---
The whole vendor system is broken.   
---
It was probably setup this way in order to encourage player trading and selling. But then they forgot a way to communicate to others over long distances, sell goods without being their in person, or advertise what your selling without yelling across the server "selling +1 longswords, lvl 10, 50 gold" every 10 minutes.   
---
Kinda Fallout 76 in a nutshell really. 
---
Well if it is intended, it shouldn't be. if my hunger thirst, diseases and rads also reset I'd be fine with intended.
---
I'd really love to see something like barbed wire
---
I do! When my wife is done watching tv, I will take my headset off and turn it on, she loves the music as well. 
---
Everyone knows stable flux is the real fallout 76 currency. 
---
I was made aware of the weight of missiles here a week ago or so. So I've drastically cut down on them. I have very little if any 2mm EC rounds. I'm pretty sure I'm under 10 total mini nukes (but yes, at 6 lbs each that is still a chunk). I typically don't carry much food. I practically live off dog food as I have the perk for it to do more and then just regular food does more. I have the perk to reduce chem weight but I normally sell all my chems except stims, and a certain number of radaway. I'm not sure about flux or bottles, but my gunpowder currently totals less than 10 lbs as I've been making quite a lot of ammo with it recently just for the purpose of using it up. I typically just carry a handful of weapons. A melee, a rifle or 2, and maybe one heavier gun like a plasma gatling or something. 
---
How are you able to build 10 turrets?? I have 4 with a small base and my budget is maxed.
---
I got a Furious explosive one
---
I love it even though it doesn't do that much damage (especially since I don't have the perk cards for it)
---
Aluminum and lead, not steel.
---
48 is still low vs SB, they get easier as you lvl. Try to target and cripple wings. You can ground them and they take like 2-3√ó more dmg. 
---
@34, you may not be comfortable around the fissure, but you should be able to do WS around the buildings.
---
THe bloated ones will present a challenge, especially when they gang up on you, but with PA, a good melee weapon, radaway/radx, a few stimpacks, adn some nuka cherry, you should be good to go.
---
I say PA vs hazmat, b/c while the hazmat suit I have offers 1k rad resistance, its DR is zero.
---
Granted, I have not tried putting on the hazmat suit, then getting into power armor...
---
RazorGrain Looks so much better when it's broken and sunk in the ground, than when it's harvestable and floating a foot above it. Drives me insane. Everything in this game clips... except the crops.. no no no it would be a disaster FOR CROPS TO CLIP WITH THE **GROUND.**
---
Seriosly, while your suggestion would be nice, I fear it would make cooking and brewing way too easy. No more adventure and learning about the various locations of harder to find plants around the map. Like taking a rare item and making it so that anybody can have them in their backyard. 
---
Personally, I'd like them to keep it the way it is. Make the current crops actually sit below ground level and not on top of it. Add planters, pots, plots, etc. And MAYBE some type of way to permanately mark your map with various locations of plants/ores you discover while exploring. 
---
No kidding, I haven't seen one at all. I'd love to have one, especially an explosive for nostalgic purposes
---
That would be wonderful 
---
For as cool as it looks, there's almost nothing interesting up there. Or if there is, someone got there before me. There's so many cool locations that are empty in 76
---
I'm not certain about the respawning times but I do know that plan/mod spawn nodes usually have a 10-25% chance of actually having those items. On top of that, they aren't instanced so other players may have gotten to them first. In case you're still learning the spawn points, this may be helpful https://www.falloutmaps.com/#!/
---
I used to spend most my time hunting plans and every so often I'd find a server with plans at almost every spawn point. I'm not sure if this was due to finding a "fresh" sever, good RNG, cosmic intervention, or some other factors. 
---
I believe they only spawn once per day, for you personally.  But if someone else enters an area that is "ready to be reset", and that person has not picked up the item yet, it can spawn.  Meaning if you get to it before them, or they ignore it, you can also pick it up again.
---
Now, an area that is occupied, or has been occupied within a certain time period, won't have these global items respawn if a new player enters.
---
This can be viewed in popular areas like Flatwoods, where the Gym weights won't respawn even if you yourself haven't been there in days and enter, if someone else was there already, or had just recently been there.
---
Or more recently, the X01 Quantum paint.  People believed this to be a "once per server" item when it first released.  But I believe the real issue was so many people were checking the areas that the first one for the fresh server was usually the only one ever able to get it.  As there was always someone in the area or entering it too soon to not allow enough "empty time" to pass before it was able to respawn.  Now, a couple weeks later, you can go to the area and see the doors open, unlocked, and the X01 Quantum Paint plans just sitting there waiting to be taken.
---
Same with crafting perks it does my head in swapping different ones in and out every time I am at camp
---
I got a Tick blood tequila you can have. I'm online now, IGN Sgt\_OKeefe
---
One thing I do hate though is the ‚Äòunable to scrap as this supports another item‚Äô. So broken I sware
---
They can spawn legendary like the one in the picture above just like any other critter. Totally could have been killed for one. Wouldn‚Äôt expect to see a legendary one again though. 
---
I saw many off them in hazmat suit that keep die and respawn
---
I just assumed they all were animated since a fee of mine happen to be. The more you know 
---
While both my husband and I enjoy video games, he was never a fan of online games, whereas i don't mind either. It had been a wish of mine for him to get into them, i was forever telling him he didnt have to interact with randoms, we could just both play together online. 
---
It took years of convincing. He was happy enough to play 76 but solo. Until he decided he needed help on a quest. So, we waited till our son was at school, I took over his xbox while hubby went on ours and did the mission. I think then he realised he actually enjoyed himself. 
---
This kept up for a few weeks. Then he wondered about getting a second TV. I simply said well, we have got a spare xbox so may as well go for it.
---
Since then we have spent many a happy hour wandering the wastes together. 
---
He follows you around, watches you, and tailors and insult just for you. 
---
The only thing I found up there was a note a about a former resident who decided to spend the rest of their days enjoying the view.
---
That looks awesome!
---
Yeah they would have to change the art too. Maybe into a MG with a tripod.
---
This is game design.... Not real apocolypse simulator.
---
So domes three and seven are Nuka Cola, that's.... disappointing. Thanks for the tip.
---
I found the Mothman like 50 times during the Mothman week. 
---
At the very least the ability to set markers ala BotW, would be a compromise I could life with. But from a logical perspective we should be able to plant a heck of a lot more than we currently can. Maybe don't make everything plantable, but most things should be. 
---
I hop on daily just to check on new atomic chop items and to snag any easy challenges, even if im not in the mood for a sit-down play. It's getting better and better as time goes by
---
Yes it will be! I hope when you jump back in you‚Äôll see all the new goodness!
---
You're downvoted, buy I agree with you...     I think it's the way you said it
---
I recently discovered that my stash box was full due to my 2300+ pieces of raw cloth.
---
Exactly, my point is that not adding extra plants because it "would ruin scarcity" isn't a good reason
---
You don't get much more powerful after 50 really.  Except realizing where you fucked up putting SPECIAL points and perk cards
---
Rug glitch ftw.

Dont forget about the clock from the responder bot

Yeah, and a quick Google search also shows the word has multiple meanings.  Like all words.  All definitions are viable.   That's why they have numbers with different definitions.  People forgot how dictionaries work lol
---
Nah maintenance starts in about an hour. You prolly just got dropped ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
the most popular builds (at least based on my experience) are bloodied/unyielding builds.... but if you dont wanna do that the best (ranged) weapon effects are anti-armor explosive weapons, with TSE being the second best
---
They may be killing the adds to get adrenaline to proc, I usually dip away kill an add or two then back to sbq stronger with my axe
---
About 60  or 65 is usually when I've got my build finalized
---
Yeah, I always assumed they have some planned use for them. 
---
If they're worried about the food system being too easy they could always make it so that canning also requires rubber for the seal. Maybe extra salt. They could add a small risk of catching botulism from anything that's canned by a player. Maybe even require acid to preserve the best stuff. I think it could be very realistic and balanced.
---
Lots of people come and use my (unlocked) camp and water purifiers in flatwood it seems.  Always see at least one person using it each time I play.  I think it all depends on if it is in a high traffic area (without the comforts of camp otherwise easily accessible). 
---
No those were made during broken steel i can accept X-01 but hellfire is too far
---
Why is that?
---
Can we use mods again? I definitely don't want to get banned for using a mod like this. They were pretty heavy handed with bans a few months ago.
---
Gotta go up there for the quantum power armor paint.  
---
Find mole miners! Except for the Rocketeer, they're all easy enemies from mod range, have decent xp and good loot. Just east of Watoga station, the mine on top of the hill usually spawns them or scorched. And if they're overwhelming, escape to the Watoga sentry bots is only a  hundred yards away

Unlucky, My mate got the Jester mask on his fourth attempt

I want the fallout 3 assault rifle and Chinese assault rifle

Like others said it'll go back into your inventory, but we should be having a update this month that lets us use items in our stash as decoration. I plan on putting my T-60 out on display when that happens. üòÅ
---
Still have him?
---
Coordinate with discord.  Every weekend I join in on like 3-6 queen nukes
---
\-BE and AAE are very popular right now depending on your build. Despite what people say, TSE's are very strong, but supposedly very duped, so people shy away from them. Explosive is not glitched, but nerfed, so go with max rank Dem. expert if you're going to use them.
---
\-Sentinel armor is strong in survival/PvP, but frankly, i do just fine with whatever...survival is about being quick and having high Perception stats/gear.  I personally like unyielding for the stats.  For Survival, I recommend a good silencer weapon because once i hear shots, i've got a heads up on the shooter.
---
\-For PA, pick your flavor...I like T-60, its a good/cheap all around, but def. choose some appropriate Mods like Calibrated shocks (more carry weight) and core assembly (better AP regen).
---
Hope this helps a bit/
---
PS. The market for buying and selling in this game has become a real thing. AAE Lever's going for 25k. So if you want to play at max level, you better grind out awesome legionaries, or be willing to pay for gear.
---
I have literally every weight reduction perk too. I know it's costing me in combat, but my stash is full and I absolutely hate being overweight. 
---
Yup add me up
---
I hope so! This is my first play through and I just got my excavator armour, hoping to show it off and use it when I need it.

just watched it.  well well!

Legendary players should take care of this.

It sucks man... I just wanna put the 3 points I'm wasting on batteries included in agility, but cores weigh as much as the sun üò£

Hopefully today's maintenance is the update giving decorations, I can only hope. If not then hopefully next weeks update that has player vending/etc will. I can only hope though. xD
---
Nope, not lore friendly. Why would anyone keep trash like caps in a safe. You get pre-war money that you can turn in to caps with some crafting. So you do actually kinda get caps already.
---
The legendary system that will "reset" you above 50 is their plan.  Details are few, if any, but we will find out.
---
**"That's a bullshit commie maneuver!"** \~ *Colonel Gutsy*
---
That is a good reason though... it would ruin scarcity. If you ruin scarsity of lets say... Firecaps, you absolutely ruin the value of disease cure. No one would need to buy it from other players because everyone would just make it themselves. What about all the other drugs?  
---
I'm not sure, I have run into quite a few here lately whereas before, I hardly saw any.  Prolly just cyclic spawns and depends on where you go.

 A lot of players, myself included,  get into a bit of a pattern of where they explore or grind and tend to expect certain enemies in certain places. Tanagra town always has them.  I hate those little bastards.  Their attacks ignore about 90% of your armor I think. 
---
Bethesda never fails to deliver so it will be awesome! Just lower your expectations well below zero and you won't be disappointed when the new player vendor system turns out to be worth of zero.
---
Absolutely
---
I have not heard of this before? Is it just rumors or was it in a post of theirs?
---
Forbidden knowledge happens all the time... I do it at least twice a day. Technical data can be found in the enclave bunker. I pick them up every time I do a cap run. 
---
While the disappearing items is annoying, you aren‚Äôt out anything on this one
---
I really hate the turrets. If someone takes your camp while your in the middle of doing shit, whoever stole your base just gets a free defense against you.
---
For first-hit damage potential nothing beats instigating explosive. If you‚Äôre having to fire more than 1 bullet, a Bloodied weapon will start doing more when you are at 20% health, by bullet 3
---
Of course, you can run a low health build (Adrenal Reaction,  nerd rage, etc) with an Instigating weapon if you‚Äôre going for absolute max first hit potential. 
---
If you aren‚Äôt running a low health build and are okay taking multiple shots to kill (10mm pistol, perhaps), Anti Armor isn‚Äôt bad, especially since pistols don‚Äôt have armor reducing perks (although the 10mm has a perforating mag)
---
Off course the value will go down, but caps even with less value will be accepted as currency exchange. Now it isn't 
---
Tech Data is a bit weird at times if you try to Stash it.
---
I have two tech data in my Stash, remnants from prior to doing the BOS missions.  I have disconnected in Whitespring Nuke zones, and upon login saw two Tech Data items go flying off my person and randomly bounce along the ground.  One said "read" the other said "steal" but I couldn't actually interact with either.
---
I thought "Oh, those are the two in my Stash being purged, damn..."  But then I leave the nuke zone, go to my Stash, and they are still sitting there.
---
Yesterday I was able to pick up and turn in 3 Tech Datas though.  So I don't think there was anything special about it.  And I still have the 2x items in my Stash untouched weeks later after the nuke zone disconnect incident.
---
All depends if they know their stuff. My level 48 alt does way more damage than my level 140 main. 
---
I built this huge platform on a cliff overlooking Watoga and anytime someone launched a nuke I got cozy in my sofa and watched the sky burn...and I'm about level 150. I don't think it ever gets old, seeing a nuke drop.
---
It's because ranged weapons are still too weak in this game coupled with Scorched Beasts large HP. I also find hit registry spotty while they are airborne. Maybe they should take increased damage while in the air and/or enable you to permanently ground them by crippling their wings?
---
The best way to kill them currently seems to be shotguns or melee when/if they land.
---
It's on the Roadmap.  Very limited information.
---
Because they could use caps to buy what they need instead of asking for trade
---
Cloth was one of my problems too. I ended up having over 3k cloth and never used it for anything except crafting civil war hats occasionally for caps if I burned through what I had from event rewards.
---
From what I can tell it‚Äôs next to useless. 
---
&gt;Meaning the ONLY WAY a griefer can grief you if abandon a WS is to return slap damage.
---
But that's what he's saying - he can't abandon the ws.  There is no "Abandon Workshop" option.
---
It is a tough bullet to bite financially. But I think it was worth it. 
---
&gt;some nuka cherry
---
Don't forget to throw some Nuka Orange in there too. Higher healing, AP, and adds some rad resist!
---
Have you tried setting the resolution in the .ini files? I'm unsure if this would work, but it can't hurt to try. Just save a backup before you make any changes.
---
  Revisit the power armor spawn points.  Cores in the PA are often 25%, but theres also usually a 2nd core in the vicinity that is much higher charge.  
---
Some spawn points have a 3 or more cores. 
---
Check the fusion gnerators when you hear them.  
---
Check the table next to the core processor @ posiedon.
---
THe event at Camden park awards 1.
---
Batteries included will lower the weight.
---
@50, theres another perk to reduce consumption rate.
---
Do it! 
---
It's like it was Microsoft's plan all along haha. 
---
I think the original idea was to have the Ultracite you get from scrapping their parts be reward enough. I'm guessing they thought people would grind SBs for ultracite to craft prime ammo, receivers and repair their ultracite PAs in preparation to SBQ. At least that way the current rewards would arguably make sense. You'd drop them until one of them gave you a prime receiver plan, then grind them for ultracite until you had enough ammo, then take on the queen by shooting it with parts of its dead brethren.
---
Simultaneously sadly and not at all sadly this is not how it turned out. Sadly because that would've added another layer of advancement to the game, not sadly because it sounds like just a grind gate.
---
Mods in general were never banned.  Some mods that helped with things like duping lead to bans...for duping.  But it‚Äôs way more face-saving to blame the mod.
---
Oh shit I literally just noticed LMAO
---
Yeah that's me. Fancy meetin' you here. Of course we see each other again based on appreciation for CAMP decor.
---
its also possible you came back on a different server.  
---
Hop a couple times, you may be able to relaim it.
---
Rude.
---
Anglers need a nerf. Or just rename them to sponges...
---
Right, and I figured this out in retrospect, but that still seems buggy as heck. Don‚Äôt you think?
---
Iv been using the concrete walls with the d rings found in the defense category to build walls outside my building to protect my garden as my camp gets attacked constantly by low level scorched, robots, super mutants, molerats, and ghouls. Left one opening as there is no way to make a gate. Having the junk fence gate from fallout 4 would be great
---
mmMMm *upward tone
---
This. I think passive perks encourage laziness.
---
Anyone who hides and wastes others time in sbq is a worthless pile of death claw dung, we are not out there fighting our ass off to give YOU a free ride, in fact we need a report option to remove useless people on the server so others who want to actually try can get in 
---
Kinky lol
---
Ah, I didnt know that.  Thx!
---
It popped  for me when the nuke landed on my head and killed me before the blast hit 
---
Thanks for this, I think it explains why I find random keys and data docs on the ground that I cannot interact with.
---
I've only seen one and I'm level 113
---
This is what I want too. Just have a machine at camp and one in the hallway at whitesprings.  Both could have linked inventories. If someone is using it in either place it should say "vendor" busy. 
---
Some folks put tons of time and effort into their trading posts, so I would like the option of visiting them as well.
---
Yes. Anything to break up the monotony of all the crisp, clean cube houses. 
---
I wish my husband would like video games as much as I do. Ive tried to get him to play FO but he claims he hates open world games. Somehow he doesnt include rdr2 in that category.
---
I hated the grand exchange in runescape. It killed so much player interaction from trading. It also ruined the chance to make profits as a trader by buying low and selling high to other players.
---
Hope so. 
---
I have at least 50 saved up 
---
Oh, ok. The wikipedia page about barnstar was a good read.
---
What about a compromise - If a workshop is contested and the owner is killed, the workshop is now no longer owned by that person/team.  After all, they lost their life, so it follows that they'd lose their workshop.  If the contester stops the workshop grab, the workshop is then unowned.  This stops the farming of players by other players and yet still maintains the PVP element.  Also, once the owner is killed or the takeover is complete, the player's team is no longer in PVP because the player does not own the workshop anymore.
---
I watched my girlfriend do a messenger event this weekend. He was hopping over cars and she had to sprint to keep up with him. 
---
Still got some bugs I guess.
---
So if it disappears, how do you know it happens every time? You‚Äôd only be able to do it once
---
Have you tried adding a friend? üò£
---
Thanks! I actually did know this. Got everything set up except Game Pass. Haven't taken the plunge on that yet. Super tempting though. 
---
Make it a long drawn-out process like claiming the workshop is.  It only becomes unowned after the flag hits bottom and the player has to stay at the workshop device during the entire abandonment.
---
I love to cripple enemy legs/wing
---
Most def, not a fan of the concrete barriers
---
They all look too clean and prewar, I try to make mine look apocalyptic as possible
---
For real though?
---
Bringing back the robot workbench would be cool
---
Play Red Dead with him! :)
---
I like the mole miner gauntlets. 
---
I‚Äôd love it if they spawn glowing ones where ever they go, maybe a legendary level specific one that spawns and attacks any homes built in the path. It would give low level chances to get a decent weapon or armor but more likely a mutants pipe wrench because that‚Äôs super useful to anyone, especially low lvls
---
Levelling is surprisingly fast in this game, did you hit 50+ through the course of the main quest or some grinding?
---
Really like the design and layout of this alot.
---
I think I found it in a toolbox at the theme park with the giant alligator? I can‚Äôt quite remember 
---
 In the heat of Battle I sometimes touch the middle mouse wheel by mistake bringing up the radial wheel, could you be doing this. I‚Äôm also melee.
---
I believe so, but I can certainly try again.  Its under the social menu, correct?
---
Furious plasma Gatling is just about the best anti-queen Heavy around. High damage, high RoF, and after damage spins up it does a ton of damage. I only know the PC market but you could potentially get 3-5k for it (Id personally only pay 2-3k for one for completionist sake, because I run a Bloodied build and a bloodied plasma will do better for me)
---
It's random. No guarantee that a three star enemy will drop a three star item.
---
Since the Survival patch I have had weird stuff happen to my technical data.  I have picked it up, fast traveled to the fort and it‚Äôs not in my inventory.  I have picked it up and it is in my inventory but with no quest marker next to it and the quest not activated.  In that case I stashed it in a toolbox and then when I pulled it out I received the quest.
---
You know what i want....1 square stairs
---
Thanks. Wikipedia say that it is sometimes considered to bring good luck to have a barnstar above a door, like a horseshoe. But i was mainly there aesthetic.
---
Hellfire PA was developed at Adams Airforce Base under the orders of Augustus Autumn. It being obtainable in 76, which takes place 120 years before he was even born, would be one of the most absurd retcons to date. It wouldn't be stretching things like X-01 existing pre-war already does, it'd be rocketing it over a cliff. 
---
Heavy gun builds melt them. Melee builds melt them faster if they land 
---
You talking about the monorail cars on the ground with the fence around the only entrance to the train? 
---
If your using bloodied you need tenderizer in charisma (I use instead of lone wanderer) , and adrenaline in agility, also ghoulish is endurance is helpful in an SBQ fight, another good one is ninja if you can pop a stealth boy the damage is insane
---
How does someone maintain 5k in gear?
---
Heck yeah. Biggest compliment I ever received about a camp was "It looks like it belongs in the game". All these shiny houses ... makes no sense to me. 
---
Non legendary? 
---
I am a big fan of his idea, it feels pretty fair and balanced but soooo needed 
---
So true, my house is literally 3 crappy shacks and a campfire, some crops and a water purifier 
---
Why did you think those stuff would be shared between characters?
---
haha right? Including all the mods
---
This is the same as Adventure mode though.  Don't believe it is something unique to Survival.
---
You get some pretty decent height concrete walls of you claim a workshop. With walkways and barricades. Basically replicates the brotherhood FOBs
---
Sounds like a hardware issue or driver software issue, the game hasn‚Äôt ever done that to me and I‚Äôve been here since the beginning 
---
Cooking stations and firepits. [Video](https://youtu.be/f1QLgDwYkeg)
---
Pretty sure Wendigos are one of the random events that can happen at any of the multiple random event locations.
---
While server hopping at Fort Prickett for the Lemonade Vendor I ran into the Wendigos half a dozen times.  Anywhere between two and four (pretty sure one time was four) of them.
---
Honestly, I normally play for a couple hours at a time, but I keep a steady level with fusion cores. I'm always in my excavator armor so I use cores constantly. If you go to 98 NAR once a session, there is a sentry bot there who always drops a core, and sometimes he's a legendary. This could reduce the number you actually have to have and carry with you, since you can replenish them at least once per session, plus any others you find out there.
---
I think I killed 6 when I traveled to this event.
---
Exactly. I‚Äôve found throwing the old school guard posts up everywhere is the closest I can‚Äôt get to junk walls. So I do it. The windmill generators are good for breaking up a camps silhouette too. 
---
Price gouging in reverse and since there is no one to enforce punishment, those bastards get away with it.  In my totally unbiased opinion, this is why we need the Enclave.
---
.........no ... but where's that?! I'm guessing downhill from top of the world?
---
The random walls I found were on a road with a lot of cars near them. This was a road towards the north in between the Forest region and Savage Divide, so you could overlook both. On the way to Grafton.
---
I have 2 friends listed in the social menu Friend section, however that Make a Friend challenge does not recognise the fact. Assumption is it's broken, like several other challenges (discover places in xxx) 
---
The radio is really lacking in 76. I played the radio all the time in Fo4 with Travis but the station is boring in this game. I actually usually play with no music on in Survival because I can hear things better or because I am in group chat.
---
Isn't that one of Rose's missions where you have to befriend a Deathclaw?
---
Or enclave after completing all the steps to become a general.
---
yea... But his answer sucks ass. The fact is that it IS available in the game. The question was, am I at fault for accepting one througha trade. When you scrap one you learn the plans %100 of the time. I can make one. Anyone on my team can make one. You want to make one? I'll give you one for free. Then you can make them! I want to know whether or not this is a banable offense! Because the answer he gave is plain wrong. It IS available. Whether or not it should be is a different question. 
---
I kinda like the music in this game but yeah I can understand why you would want to turn it off
---
Killed all the spawned scorched and they will landed.
---
Nah the monorail cars are down on the ground near... the cranberry bog I think? I know it's near a fissure, and near the monorail down there. No one ever goes there lol
---
This spot was different than just seeing them, though. They both dropped from trees in the exact same positions. And I have never seen a random encounter at this spot.
---
Highest single hit: Instigating super sledge.
---
Highest DPS: probably bloodied death claw gauntlet or power fist (I haven‚Äôt compared damage on those *when modded*, power fist has higher base damage)
---
Fastest area clearing if you have a max damage low health build: Instigating or bloodied combat knife, because it attacks faster and if you‚Äôre at max damage, you‚Äôre probably still one hitting everything but scorchbeasts even with a combat knife.
---
I‚Äôm not talking about anything that involves bugged double-dipping on perk cards; one, I don‚Äôt know the facts on that, two, I wouldn‚Äôt expect it to last. 
---
There some shared tracks with 4 but what's missing is a funny DJ personality and new music. 
---
I haven't figured out how the in-game friends list works on Xbox. It seems like it does an import of usernames from your Xbox friends but once a name is on your 76 list it doesn't come off. Users I have since removed from my Xbox friends still show in 76. It also doesn't seem like it syncs immediately but I'm not sure if it syncs periodically either. Adding friends on Xbox does not immediately add them to your 76 friends list
---
I actually had a pacifist lvl 91 at Whitesprings one time.  It kept running away and would never take a single swipe at me.  I honestly felt kinda bad for killing it, after chasing it all over the entire golf course!
---
To be honest the workshop menu is so bare compared to Fallout 4, there isn‚Äôt much choice. 
---
I can‚Äôt really defend Bethesda for it either since they could‚Äôve easily just imported all those ready made assets the base game with minimal work
---
Seriously Bethesda put more plans into the game, it‚Äôs one of my many joys to discover a plan I haven‚Äôt got 
---
That would be hella awesome
---
Absolutely.  When they stopped making couch co-ops the reason was very clear.
---
Chickenshit commie! I'm gonna kill you as a personal favor to uncle sam!
---
Mr Gutsy's are no joke.
---
Probably the fact that the game doesn‚Äôt actually give us anything to rebuild together plays into the fact that instead all we do is kill. They said their game was about rebuilding America. So implement game mechanics that lets us do that.
---
This is how I've started conducting business. Buyers must come to me, and must come alone. Legits will come without issue, scammers will stop responding or start flipping out. They either get super pissed or try to validate themselves by telling me to ask "X" I'm not a scammer. Every time the latter has happened they've told me to ask another player I had already encountered trying to scam me haha.
---
If you aren‚Äôt doing a low health build, power armor is easy to get and probably roughly as effective in PVE. If you want max damage, you want a low health build, which also means collecting a set of legendary Unyielding armor, which means no power armor. 
---
Add in a swarm of cave crickets and maybe a honeybeast and, yeah...
---
I would say ‚Äúfixed‚Äù. I like not having to search on rooftops for the scrap
---
If we had them now how would I spend my atoms (money) for the next 5 years?
---
AH yes. I totally forgot about that popup which allowed you to provide a decline reason. 
---
We are playing a multiplayer mod of Skyrim, technically.
---
We can do anything but we can't do everything  ;)
---
Basically you'll be wasting your time if you go to a SBQ fight at level 15. If it fails you don't get xp.
---
I just want the chance for a legendary to be a gun to be upped.  Feels like it's mostly armor and some melee.
---
Even then, X01 doesn't even randomly spawn in 76 and is very clearly a prototype, to sort of fix 4s use of it I assume. New Power Armor would be nice, but it'd have to be genuinely new. 
---
I finished the rebuild to the i9 9900k..  Had it OC'd and the game would crash after about 5 minutes.  Went back to stock and it ran good for 3 hours last night but no queen to fight.  Thanks for everyone's input!!
---
Found the synth.
---
My Silenced Explosive Combat Shotgun: "Silent, as well as, Deadly"
---
My Fast swinging, hard hitting Ski Sword: "Hacker, wacker, and smacker."
---
My Executioner Handmade Rifle: "Omae mo Shindeiru." 
---
If you need steel, scrapper perk on any gun gives you a ton. Last patch almost doubled the steel return on scrapping guns
---
Shadowed is usually one of the first mods learned from scrapping
---
Just wanted to give a huge thanks for the help with crafting a couple of serums yesterday.
---
Most certainly, or even perhaps more perks based around Addiction and withdrawals in that depending on what stat or how many addictions you have going you get more ranged damage if your strength is affected or melee if perception is taken down.
---
There's that or even, what about a perk that gives you pure benefits for not using any chems whatsoever?
---
"Cold Turkey" - Addiction Causing chems no longer give you any positive affects, however you now have X increased stats and will slowly drop an addiction over time like a disease.
---
Capitalizing on the sleep system?
---
"Early to Bed, Early to Rise" gain multiplied or additional benefits for being well rested, similar to "Rejuvenated" but for sleep.
---
Well Tuned?
---
"The Bard"
---
Gain additional benefits to being Well Tuned / Take heavily reduced damage while playing an instrument / or Heal yourself and nearby teammates health and radiation when you play an instrument.
---
Also, one certain resistance I don't believe we have a perk to deal with yet, poison. Enemies that poison you like Radscorpions and Stingwings can become higher level yet we have no perk to partially negate their secondary damage.
---
There's just so many unique ideas they could have capitalized on but didn't for some odd reason.
---
Same here. My wife can‚Äôt get the hang of the joysticks. Idk why but it drives me nuts lol. She stays at home and would be able to have a blast living the dream, sitting at home playing fallout all day! Just today I my 10 yo son showed interest and I‚Äôm pretty stoked to set him up and show him the ropes. 
---
I hope it's not intended. Because it happened after the nukashine patch (2-3 weeks ago) Before that our food / drink buffs didn't expire upon disconnect / log out.
---
Certainly when a Workshop is taken from you then the defences you set up turn against you ... but your CAMP is yours and whilst it can (could?) be destroyed to some extent (frame and floors are indestructable) it doesn't become someone else's? 
---
Perfectly fine with me. It‚Äôs a new person...they wouldn‚Äôt know the plans. 
---
It'd be nice, but I'm pretty sure at this point they're both replaced with the Fo4 Assault Rifle and the Handmade Rifle
---
&gt;Player specific loot if 2 players attack a mob they shouldn't share loot. I noticed that sometimes when i was looting i would see loot like harden tumors just disappear while looting.
---
Most loot on corpses is unique to the player.  Certain special items are not.  These include things like Hardened Masses, Glowing Masses, High Radiation Fluids, and I believe Glowing Meat, Glowing Blood, Ionized Meat, and Nuclear Waste from glowing creatures.  This appears to be a design choice by the developers, since it seems to be unique to these special nuclear/glowing related drops from enemies.
---
That map is amazing, thanks for sharing it.
---
He said 'when' they make camps immune. 2 days ago has no bearing on them doing it in a future update.
---
Once I load in my technical data drops on the ground in front of me in my camp and I can't do anything with it. Before I did the BOS quests I had about 10 to turn in and they all vanished. This was a while ago before patch 7. 
---
For what it's worth, shortly after the patch implementing the 1.5k carry weight limit someone posted a PSA in this subreddit that if you die while over 1.5k carry weight all your junk is deleted/doesn't drop in a bag.
---
2 accounts, 9 mules. Working on leveling them for weight reducing gear now
---
Can i turn off clipping when i place them? cause i dont see those fencing going down otherwise :P
---
But more time isn't necessarily what they want.  They would have to wait for players to reach their current level, re-accumulate their OP gear, and deal with the fallout when that happens.  Here, they basically threw everything at the wall - invited the worst case scenario - and can now figure out where to target their balancing.
---
I don't think their idea was to get it absolutely right the first time.  That's why it's a beta.  The idea is to shake out what isn't working.
---
Maybe you had that mutation, plaguewalker. It makes passive damage on his pack brahmin and that makes him hostile.
---
Interesting, Pretty certain datamine and found that Shadowed was rarest of the upgrades (Least likely to drop).
---
Yes I was just thinking this while reading all these great suggestions.
---
Got it, thanks for the answer, I was secretly hoping there was a couple day reset period, so I wouldn't be tempted to grind the area!
---
Here's a link to another post where Tech Support says it is available and legit.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a1b7n5/marine\_armor\_helmet\_actual\_item\_or\_myth/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a1b7n5/marine_armor_helmet_actual_item_or_myth/)
---
Yeah, I think I'd prefer if they had shared known-plans across characters since not-sharing  just increases how often I trade modified items between my characters.   
---
It's  more bureaucracy, but it's not that bad since many of the basic plans are found pretty quickly. 
---
IDK I find it helpful when I can‚Äôt repair a piece because Im out if ballistic fiber. 
---
some skyrim weapon skins and armour so I can go around screaming "you never should have come here" at other players before attack them and if they crouch I say "must be my imagination" and walk away
---
No problem, i haven't seen it shared much on here. I don't know if it's being maintained and I know it isn't 100% accurate/updated but it's still super helpful. 
---
Another useful resource is this list of every plan and where it can be found. This hasn't been updated since January so it's missing the additions since Wild Appalachia but it's still mostly accurate. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/174gcko5FeO-RLLwvAXB55v-3up_hXCrjCp5EGqOefzM/edit#gid=641493749
---
I'm doing the bloodied build with my new character. I'm copying the build from a site that has a bloodied build on it, but it's geared more towards two handed and group play. Do you know a better build that's based more on one handed and single player?
---
Yes but he‚Äôs talking about actual walls that snap together to build structures.
---
Well the thing is the survival banner they had featured the vault boy with it. It could be because they didn't have a combat rifle pipboy icon or hopefully because they haven't forgotten about it just yet. I'm pretty sure mama dolch Chinese base mentions a shipment of Chinese assault rifles 
---
Wait what event rewards this one?
---
The concrete walls do snap together. He is taking about junk fences, which afaik didn't even snap together in FO4
---
I‚Äôm on pc and have had this happen daily over the past 7-10 days.  Force closing and restarting the game seems to eventually work, but making multiple attempts to get the game to just function is getting really old...
---
7 is for qauntum paint for X01 and 3 is for nuka cola T51 paint
---
Tip: it is always the last one
---
We‚Äôre the best and the brightest! lol 
---
any purchase of this game is regrettable 
---
I have the crafting recipe for it. May be able to brew one up for you in time.
---
When I did my first "a real blast" enclave event, it was all yao guai's.  I honestly think that's the most I've ever died in this game.  
---
unyielding sentinel marine left arm with plus 1 agility for weapons 23.
---
I just got a shiny starched genes today at level 65. Ive had it maxed for 35 levels. It can happen! 
---
I would use tenderizer, but it's swing is to slow to really be worth while.
---
I forgot about adrenaline.
---
And I'm really bad a sneaky stuff mainly because I don't have the patience to be stealthy, but I might try it out because I heard it's insane in DMG from other and would be an interesting change from charging in guns blazing.
---
Honestly think we'll get that some day
---
Let me know if you can. One hour left :(
---
It's mostly based on my months of server hopping at Camp Venture with Tech Data turn ins, and checking the many, many, plan/mod spawns in that area.  Observing what happened when others were there, vs me, and what I picked up vs left alone.
---
The problem is where do you limit which perks are passive? All noncombat perks? So basically like half of all the perks in the game? Let me tell you about this little thing called power creep...
---
Boooooo
---
Holy shit my friend. It does look like an in game location! Bravo to you for figuring this stuff out. I will gladly admit that building like this is BEYOND me and my capabilities so I love seeing when people can do it!
---
I want the wooden stairs that are in the middle of a floor section and go up to the middle of another floor section.
---
&gt; You step in, fade to black, then reappear...
---
... prisoner, in a cart, with a couple of Stormcloacks directed to the place of execution
---
That thought occurred to me ... many times, whilt running around collecting rare ingredients. However, it doesn't make sense to make everything growable at your CAMP, depending on where you have it located. Example would be Strangler Blooms which can be found on the Mire, or Snaptails which grow in the Forest along waterways. Where I am at the moment, near Pleasant Valley Station/Top Of The World, there are Bloodleaf plants in the water, Aster in the woods and Rodedendrums ... and Firecracker Berries which are much easier to spot now they glow red. The conditions are suitable for those plants.
---
Yeah.  Don't get me started about my attempt to match up major roads &amp; highways.
---
Yeah, clipping needs to be fixed first imo, what good is a fence if it can never be placed or is floating for half of it lol
---
Turns out I can't unfortunately. It requires regular lemonade to make, which I don't have any of and can't craft.
---
Thanks.
---
I guess I mixed it up with the vendor at charleston(unless they are one and the same)
---
Going to grab me a vanilla soft serve today. 
---
Because ass hats could lure high end death claws into low level areas .
---
yeah i also seem to get alot of melee hits not registering , but i can hear the sound of my weapon hitting  the enemy so i know its bugged
---
Ya, I was expelling Tech Data on log in back in Patch 5 or so.  Would see them randomly sitting on the floor of my CAMP, wondering where it came from.
---
I'll admit that I don't help with damaging the queen nearly enough to warrant my being there. The only thing I can do is switch my build to explosives, shoot my bloodied fat man and two shot granade launcher until they break. Then I'm useless for killing her, my main build is sniper, so instead of attacking her directly, I switch to crowd control. I can one shot most everything, mire lurk king and queens take about 7-10 shots.
---
Any legendaries that managed to show up I call out and only tag them.
---
I've seen high level rad scorpions and mirelurk kings shred through people before, making the whole run go sideways, so if I'm keeping them off  the people who are taking down the queen, so it's at least helpful.
---
There is also a giant metal face up there
---
That is a random encounter spot I traveled there alot when I was trying to tame a creature and it does change to different things 
---
Need more Vim! items too.
---
FO3 early game I did that. But by end game I was waltzing though death claw sanctuary without fear.
---
The two recipes are sold by the same Vendor, usually rare for someone to have bought one and not the other.  The Lemonade is crafted at a cooking station, not the brewing station.  Acid, Sugar, and Water.
---
Damn, guess I funky RNG then.
---
BoS for me :) , still waiting on my helmet
---
For crafting perks, a better solution IMO would be making all crafting perks that you own active while inside your own settlement without having them equipped. This means you wouldn‚Äôt have to swap to them for crafting purposes, but would still have to slot them in to get their combat bonuses if applicable. On top of that, maybe give them an additional bonus for crafting if you actually have them equipped, but nothing game changing. Maybe an additional discount on crafting costs or the item has extra durability when crafted.
---
Vertical half walls while we're at it!
---
I think for me it would just help with replay-ability.
---
Having plenty of steel on me but not able to build steel walls only wooden walls was just annoying. 
---
I couldn't even build a bed only the sleeping bag on the floor. 
---
I'm not sure about the brewing poster to get brewing quests either. Or other Items from the atomic shop. 
---
Just seems like a big waste of time. 
---
No, unfortunately.
---
Aren't atomic shop items account wide? 
---
We don't do that here
---
"Another vendor needs your money!"
---
Some plants but not all down stuff should stay rare and make you have to go look for them like I don‚Äôt think you should be able to grow cranberries 
---
Presumably next week.
---
Would love to see some new combos. So sick of seeing sentinel and cavalier. People think these are invincible till they get hit with radiation damage. 
---
Alright. I actually DO have it. Now I need to find sugar.
---
I wish more was done with all the passive enemies i.e. chickens foxes and frogs and such. They exist but aren't really relevant to anything, despite being fairly rare
---
that's how all games that support multiple saves/characters are. what, did you really think someone who just woke up and walked out of Vault 76 would suddenly know how to build a water purifier?
---
We stayed in v76 few hours more than out v76 residents. We don't know what happened to other vaults (I think they are all still closed, except maybe 94).
---
People we read about weren't in the vaults, they saw the bombs and survived (for a while)
---
Pretty sure you're correct.
---
On my alt I was wondering the same thing, about why this wasn't accomplished and was about to #metoo this thread... but I think on my main I recall getting atoms after that part. I'll have to load him up to confirm but I think you're right... :)
---
Fair does....the 3 guys I saw last time helped with the SBQ for about 6 mins, then disappeared. We found them killing scorched in the gullies....they fired a shot or two occasionally at the queen but never fully engaged after that first attack. They were 121, 118 and 86.
---
Maybe the leveled areas can be where their free range is. That way it helps keep them from overcrowding and causing performance issues too. Maybe just have a slight overlap or let lower level creatures wonder into higher level areas and not vice versa. 
---
Besides that they are letting people leveled in the hundreds murder players in the single digits. A level 91 deathclaw is probably easier to deal with. 
---
I have 18 hard lemonade on me right now, I'll give one to you if you really need it. Less than an hour remains, so, up to you. My in-game nick is Pirates1800 with the med kit player icon.
---
Whats your gamertag? I can hook you up.
---
I enjoy Gatling gun more than the .50. it's slower, makes less ammo and harder to find but packs a much more powerful punch in general, and for me at least seems to stagger enemies alot more.
---
I‚Äôm almost of the opinion that they should add in a lockout between switching cards. Maybe 10-15 minutes after you switch before you can switch again. Since it‚Äôs obvious they never intended frequent card swaps to be the norm. I honestly wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this gets added near the release of the vaults (raids).
---
The rares should have a 5 to 10% increase for their respective effect. Making them worth something. 
---
Are you on PC?
---
Good to know, thank you very much! I'm gonna need to get the scrapper perk next time I level up. I really appreciate everybody's help on this; I never knew there were so many really cool people on this sub. 
---
Thats because Atom Stuff is Account-wide.
---
I read this only yesterday, that Aluminium and Lead weigh less when bulked but nothing else does. A weight loss is due to the 2x Plastic used to bulk it (which apparently just vanishes then!). The only reason then to bulk anything other than Al or Pb is if you want to sell to vendors who only take those materials bulked. 
---
Oh that's it i'm getting the metal set today. 
---
Awesome work!
---
Yes.  It is all controlled by the maximum weight of the "container" (extractor).  You can see it in the lower corner of the menu when you are interacting with it.
---
Once it is full, it will not extract any more.
---
thank you for commenting...
---
Yes, because you paid for those by an account, not an individual and hold no significant difference besides aesthetics. But that being said, objects that do improve gameplay, such as industrial water purifiers, if you buy the clean industrial purifier skin, you still need to unlock the plan 1st.
---
I  am not the only person that has complained this 
---
Dead accurate. After the recent patch that fixed the first shot missing always, it is an accurate weapon.
---
Come find me. Gamer tag is EzGrooveRider.  I'm on most night from 7pm GMT.
---
The raider awnings too, the tents available are ok, but there's 3% of flat land worth putting even just one on without a nice flat foundation first.
---
Someone already has the hard lemonade.Thank you ! 
---
After it's full, you will have to remove it for it to generate more.
---
Added. Skywalker3609 here
---
Raider armor is really light, so if you have a low strength build (or just want to role-play) you can still reap most of the benefits of power armor without breaking your back. It's a marked improvement in damage protection over the Excavator, plus it's cheaper to mod and cheaper to repair than anything else. It's the kind of armor you take out when you don't want to put wear and tear on your nuke zone gear but you got into the hard lemonade and really want to punch some mole miners in face.
---
Well yes but that is a cosmetic item you pay real money for. Of course those would be account wide lol. It makes sense to me though that a character is a single person and the others wouldn‚Äôt know the plans. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I understand why plans aren't shared as it would make new characters too powerful, but I would assume they were trained to rebuild something since that's the whole premise.
---
Snaptail reed can be used to make sugar, if you have the green thumb perk card it should only take one Snaptail for harvest.
---
PS4 unfortunately
---
agreed...there is a dmg balance issue here. A ghoul slapping me around in PA will kill me if i take a quick break...lol, 
---
There is a perk i use lvl3 critical shot (or something like that) in perception. I can quickly one shot ghouls of any level with a standard lever. 
---
My thoughts....either give us a quick swap ability, so we can have 2 (or more) "Sets" of perks that can be swapped around.....OR give us a certain number of "utility" or "non-combat" slots that are "always active" . Doesn't have to be an equal number to the normal slots...maybe 3 to 1?  (6 special would have 2 slots.  15 special would have 5 slots.  etc etc, In order to have lockpick 3 always on you'd need 9 PER.  so on and so forth.)  
---
Either of those would count as a huge QoL.
---
Got'cha, you don't need to buy it either. I just want to give one to you out of goodwill. Can do that and then eat some breakfast.
---
And yes, it is annoying in some ways. I'm a base builder and I don't like to tear down my camp on my main because I love it do much, so I do builds on alts, but lm limited because I'm not going waste money getting all the plans again. However I understand why it's like this. Most people would want replayability to mean starting fresh
---
Yea pvp is another story.
---
Vault-tec insisted that the dwellers leave the vault unarmed. i don't think they actually care about the 76 dwellers being prepared or not. they just wanted the overseer to go for the nuke silos after the door opened.
---
Fucking yes
---
It just works!
---
1x1 stairs are also a must
---
Agreed. It's installed on much of the fence walls the op mentioned.
---
I only use my power armor in nuke zones now, but still carry around 10 at a time just in case... which is 30 goddamn pounds without b included! I'll check that place out for a legendary sentry though! Whitesprings has a couple sentry to farm cores too
---
&gt; Would you say bloodied is better than anti armor?
---
easily,just use emergency protocols on your power armor torso
---
Currently in Survival mode you can fast travel to owned workshops but whenever I've been killed and respawn the workshop icons on the map aren't even there to select.
---
The biggest one for me is that for consoles, the jump button on Fallout is opposite of literally any first person shooter I've played. Makes going back and fourth funny.
---
Survival is more like king of the hill. u got the best gear and tactics...you'll slaughter everyone else.
---
that's i was expecting, thanks guys !
---
Here's a spreadsheet showing which mats to bulk and whatnot, super helpful!
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a1kuxc/materials_master_list_junk_management/
---
And don't trust strangers ;)
---
I'm glad that you got your weapon back though.
---
Yeah I've raised that ticket with Bethesda already, I think it's an error because I'll get the choice sometimes but I usually do Vault 76 and then the workshop
---
&gt; RR is mostly irrelevant
---
i use a adrenal reaction/nerd rage build and and for me it makes a big difference 
---
It‚Äôd be cool to raise rad chickens for eggs. 
---
I assume it'll be locked behind the atomic shop pay wall, or even more dastardly they introduce paid DLC.
---
They‚Äôre yummy 
---
Thank you :)
---
\+karma
---
I thought it went up to a max of + 30%
---
They've already copy/pasted so much, tough to understand why they've not brought more over. I'm thinking they're holding back so they can give us the simple things later to continually gain our gratefulness lol in atom shop ofc
---
same for gatling in my case with all perks ....
---
They mentioned weapon racks at some point, I hopefully assume powerarmor will exist too since it was in FO4
---
I figured, well shoot back to hunting for a bloodied Gatling gun. 
---
Message me I‚Äôll help you out i have friends with a few high level who will gladly help you out 
---
Didn't your parents ever teach you to turn off lights when you're done in a room....  
---
What, you think they're easy to find? That we can just stop by the corner Waste-R-Mart and pick up a pack of new bulbs?! Serves you right that you'd come home to burnt out lights!  
---
Let this be a lesson to you.... *\*looks at username\** S... Sir?  
---
\[/roleplay response\]
---
What platform are you on? I have a VATS legendary Gatling gun of you're on PS4, and I think a legendary .50?
---
I love the challenge of survival mode but I just wish for a equal playing field 
---
I'd also love all fence to allow better ground clipping.
---
Yep, and thanks to this post. His buddy read it and that's when I got it back. I think I got that in the vid. Part2
---
Two shot, not explosive though.
---
Furious will do the same.
---
I believe it does around 74dmg, high fire rate though. 
---
I'm on Xbox, than you for offering though
---
I've mutually added 5 people now thru the game and it's never completed. 
---
How about some legendary versions actually dropping. I would be very happy with that
---
Whatever update Bethesda did to balance PvP in the last patch is a step in that direction it seems. I killed a level 100+ guy the other day on my newly created Survival mode only character at level 10 or so with a short automatic pipe rifle. 
---
I had been on the top 3 longest lives list for a while so I was constantly checking my surroundings. Turned around and saw him running up the road at me with a deathclaw gauntlet so I VATS headshotted him until I ran out of AP and to my surprise he actually went down.
---
Definitely not your first character.
---
More that this new character would get a heads up from a previous vault dweller like we learn from the overseer. 
---
I guess world of warcraft had heirloom items, which made new chars a little more fun to play. Was thinking something like this could be done.
---
I just don't have the time to do the same mundane thing over and over again.
---
And the things I may have missed on another character can be discovered by this new character. 
---
I now have an headset that connect to both my XB1X and my Android device through bluetooth and i can play any music i have (on a network drive).
---
Yup. It ain't legit. All marine armor helmets stem from one place. dev room
---
That would make sense, but it's also very stupid.
---
Pls fix this Bethesda 
---
Everytime reloading weap dmg change 310 to 151
---
Nyuk nyuk nyuk
---
Huh.... can't hear other people I the party. Must need to change settings :(
---
If they snapped together, sure.  Wouldn‚Äôt mind a whole slew of FO4 assets.  One of my camps really need a burned out bus.
---
yup   gatling did the same,black powder,radium fifle,tesla etc...and...gauss rifle has taken a 5% drop from 235 to 224......moan gripe whine
---
I got plutonium from them.
---
My question is . Is it worth caps ?ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
and PvP? Should a VATS headshot kill?
---
I have them. 1k caps?
---
I dunno man. You made a wild assumption and it was wrong. It‚Äôs a new character. Not a new game+
---
Okay, so what numbers do reflect sales after the price drop and the holiday season? 
---
&gt;Judging by the amount of likes on this post I am confident to say that the haters are out numbered on this one.
---
lol. you're posting about fo76 in a FO76 sub. Why don't you try it in r/gaming or r/ps4 and see how it goes?
---
Something not working as intended? You don't say...
---
Also noticed the top 3 often don't even show up on the map. Saw a few folks on this subreddit saying it's because those people are sneaking which removes you from the map but this morning I saw on of the top 3 running around (i.e., not sneaking) at the Collision Course event at Morgantown Airport and kept checking the map to see he still wasn't on it.
---
Damnit I wanted the assault one but no I spent 2 month looking for the damn thing and it's not even a thing
---
This is a random encounter. I have seen Rachel as well as others. Sometimes there are three wendigo in the trees.
---
Maybe if we ever get to re roll our perk cards I'd only have need for one character. 
---
Headshots with my Lever Action against level 68 Scorched usually makes them drop dead instantly, with the head removed from their body.  Corpse drops, head slowly falls.  Or head goes flying off and the corpse drops.
---
Rarely does a headshot against a scorched leave it's head attached to it's body with my rifle.
---
I mean i would love those fences but well all used ' tcl ' just to get them in the right place in fallout 4.. man we should get that command 
---
Professional Drinker is a complete waste of points. I've been running a Party Boy build for a couple of weeks and never become addicted. If it ever happens, there is enough booze laying around to make it a non-issue (and I have literally dozens of doses of Addictol laying around as well).
---
It would maybe be worth it as insurance as a one point card. At three points it is a bad choice. Slot a point or two of Rejuvenated in there instead.
---
I would also put two or three points into Long Shot in Perception and switch out picklock. Run Long Shot for grinding and picklock for loot farming. (Personally, I don't even bother opening locked doors or containers; the best loot drops from mobs anyway.)
---
Hey I‚Äôm okay with trying and failing it‚Äôs the not trying at all I find depressing.
---
Hunting cryptids is a great pastime.
---
Also recommend the behemoth in the lake. He's a fun fight
---
It's a real thing, there's hundreds of them in circulation if you play on PC
---
There is a platform with stairs, and without, in the Defense tab. (Not guard posts)
---
You can attach walls to them and they snap together. You can also fit the shorter defense barriers under, like the camps near Fissure Prime.
---
My boyfriend doesn't really get into video games. The closest I have gotten is him playing NHL18 now 19. Most of the time he lets the computer play and goes for good stats. Oh well, at least he is having fun. Lol
---
That happens because the game is counting in your current damage modifiers to the weapon you are holding. 
---
Must be my perks. I rarely use vats too.
---
oh man! I completed Rosies quest line some time ago, so I hope this is not correct.   
---
Is it perhaps tied to using Wasteland Whisperer to send an spawned animal to your camp? (I don't have the perk so don't know)
---
Yeah but I play on Xbox so it's a bit harder to get one
---
I wonder if that's because their armor provided more stealth? I heard speculation that this was somehow now in play in regards to the map. I know that players within dungeons are not visible on the map even if top 3. As far as the ranking goes, I've been able to find most people unless there is a tie in that spot or on all of them
---
I live in a little tiny home up north but I'd probably make a little makeshift firebase near Flatwoods to help out newbies. 
---
My husband and I got the side by side TVs and Xboxes set up too! So fun to play fo76 side by side. Our kids have the same set up for playing roblox and Minecraft. 
---
Literally unplayable
---
Don't forget to run scandisk and defrag the hard drives. They also need to pull the game cartridges out and blow on the connectors. That that should fix some of the problems.
---
Odd, why would the assault helmet not be in the game yet? The wetsuit is, the armor as well, just not the helmet.
---
I actually found seven whilst opening three, more for the cola than the paint.
---
Sometimes it's because they have been capped out and all aids taken from them, that doesn't mean they can't still play survival.... Sounds like they were camping, but then again it sounds like you were. 
---
The value is just a baseline.  Don‚Äôt look at it as a promise or offer.  All actual prices are just modifiers applies based on various factors.
---
Where do you find those!? I‚Äôve only gotten cherry and grape and I‚Äôm 110 on my main lol
---
I wouldn‚Äôt go hunting elephants with .45 Long Colt.  
---
That‚Äôs your choice, I guess.  Pretty silly.
---
It requires flux to craft excavator? I though it was just black titanium and other random stuff
---
Settlers.
---
I agree with this as well.
---
After all vault 76 were the brightest.
---
Getting aster  for Old Possum to do Biv's daily quest...
---
I agree 
---
You need a new gun lol. 
---
Last 3 times we nuked the Queen it crashed mid way thru. No thanks. 1 out of 5 times it actually let's you play thru with no SNR. 
---
As you level up your char and gear, you become stronger...that's really the point.
---
I play a low lvl in survival for extra exp...total drag, but dont want to use my main b/c I could lose over 500 caps per death.
---
And two is too.. well, when you want your enemies extra dead, just to be sure.
---
I would throw money at Bethesda if they made Nuka Cola cardboard cut outs that you can put in your camp as well as statues and posters.
---
True, that's a .45-70 gvt. Still a large round, though.
---
You mean the Automaton Station?
---
Every rifle and shotgun I have can one shot anything but scorch beasts. Everything... Almost. 
---
Combat helmets are pretty useless. 
---
0 dmg 0 Radiation 0 Energy protection.
---
No need to add that in game. 
---
Is it just a 1 Star? If it‚Äôs a 2-3 star I am interested. 
---
I've seen two in my 104 levels. The first one was right after I left the vault during the beta and it was devastating for me as I was already struggling with rads from eating and drinking and couldn't find any radaway. 
---
I'm so fucking bothered Hy the fact helmets are useless:(
---
A 1 unfortunately 
---
"Considering this is just the PS4 player count, which is usually the biggest one between PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, it is hard to imagine Fallout 76 managed to sell a million copies overall, let alone more.  "  
---
Where does this come from? According to this study ( [http://www.theesa.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ESA-Essential-Facts-2015.pdf](http://www.theesa.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ESA-Essential-Facts-2015.pdf) ) 62% of gamers play on PC vs 56% on consoles.  
---
I don't even play this game was just snopping around lol.
---
I think that they should be removed from the game and replaced with Behemoths. 
---
They're not fun to fight and their soundwave lag attack is just annoying to play against. 
---
Many times I'd rather alt-f4 than deal with a Scorchbeast. 
---
crossbow characters are a thing?  What kinda perks you use with that? 
---
If you wanna see what that looks like in person 
---
[https://imgur.com/WhcQ4wk](https://imgur.com/WhcQ4wk)
---
Twin nuke dets up at WS a while ago
---
lmao This was exactly what I was going to say. However, the UUID glitch sounds way more plausible for a Bethesda game.
---
Not to say it couldn't be farmers who will sell stuff for real money on eBay... Wouldn't be the first MMO it happened to :P
---
Also, pretending for a moment this IS the case...  Lets take a moment to appreciate the irony of a game where China is the enemy and invaded the US, which is the location in the game where play... and now we have our game being invaded by China! :D  
---
*^(\[)****^(Note:)*** *^(I have nothing against Chinese people nor any of them who happen to play FO76 for that matter. This is purely in jest and not to be taken seriously!\])*
---
Basically, it's basically a supplement to the mutation though I believe it functions a lot more often. Tesla Bracers are knuckle based mods while coils are torso based. 
---
I believe you need to be unarmed to use Bracers, either that or they work with melee weapons.
---
There‚Äôs a penalty in adventure because it‚Äôs easy to maintain caps. It‚Äôs to easy to lose all your caps in survival for a no cap debuff to even be discussed.
---
Yes, kinda. I'm going to be honest I had no idea that existed. I didn't play mush of the DLCS in fallout 4. 
---
It‚Äôs coming. 
---
To be fair the automaton workshop had you customize robots but I would imagine this would be extremely similar
---
Yes, the Torso Mod deals Electrical damage when you receive a melee hit, and the Tesla Bracers (Arms mod) adds electrical damage to unarmed (Punching) attacks.
---
TRUST ME when I say this, go to white springs when it‚Äôs nuked! As soon as you can use a hazmat suit your good to go!  I regret waiting so long to go there (25-30) because of the high level enemies! You should go there, find a mid to high level player, and tag along. Just like another had said, all you have to do is tag them with one shot and you get XP and, most important to me, you get that sweet sweet loot!!! All you need to do is get a shot in on each enemy and then hop on the bus. I prefer to bring them outside so everyone gets hits in VS killing them in the building in a mad rush. Also if you get a Tesla rifle, keep it just for WS and use it for tagging. 
---
You will be sneaking, trust me! 
---
This post is 2 months old and kind of moot.
---
Especially when the top selling 20 games came out and fo76 wasnt on any of the lists for any console. 
---
It was a giant flop, and the numbers came out at some point and I think I remember seeing about 1.6 million. 
---
I have a 1h melee build, need a ranged backup.  I need to give those pipe weapons another look.
---
I know the helmets from Fo4 don't give actual protection in this game. Which is an odd design decision considering outfits and armor do. on the other hand. The marine tactical helmet doesn't give any damage protection either. The assault helmet is pretty desirable though. I've played Fallout 4's Far Harbor DLC as many Fo4 players have, so why not add it?
---
Pretty sure this is coming
---
That's green.
---
get what your saying but.......bear in mind,none of the weapons have any real world resemblance, only in name or appearance. my 50cal sniper is quite lethal thou..and at silly ranges. Watch out for point blank, I think the barrel extends past the target and - no damage. Apart from that... agreed, it kind of sucks..... should be very dead from blast to the head.
---
Forced landings would be great. Also as a melee I switch to crowd control to allow the long ballers to focus on the SB. Keeps me busy while she's up.
---
Changing up the dropped items is also a great idea and would be welcomed.
---
I‚Äôd love a railway rifle but since it doesn‚Äôt benefit from anything it‚Äôs worthless 
---
FROG SOUP FROG SOUP FROG SOUP
---
Everyone wants realism in bullet damage when it comes to pve (I want my one shots!) but unrealistic bullet sponges when it's pvp (WTF is with being one shot!).
---
Oh? Hmm... 
---
Well, being I'm level 93 now and have only spent maybe 8 points since lvl 50... I'll grab all the appropriate perks to tame and get back to you on this. *(Been meaning to tinker with those perks anyhow, so... motivation! Of course, beings as the servers will be going down soon for that Hotfix, it'll probably be a little bit before I can get online.)*
---
Um.... If a new character had everything your existing one had, what in the world would be the point in making a new character? Why would the plans be shared? That asumption of yours just makes no sense. Like thinking all the locations you've discovered would be unlocked on a new guy, or having all your current perk cards unlocked...
---
Thanks for the help.
---
Pencil eraser works wonders on those pesky copper fingers üëç
---
Or they could just add them as quest/event rewards or as boss loot
---
This is in their future plans.
---
That said, if your CAMP feels too empty, you may also be making it too big.  I see a lot of giant CAMPs in the wasteland and, yeah, you're going to have issues filling that space.  But if you keep to a 2x3 size, give or take, you can pack it with decoration.
---
&gt;  This is exploitable in survival 
---
It's not an exploit It's an intended game mechanic.  The whole point if survival is that it's supposed to be brutal and harsh. 
---
That means losing caps if you die, that means possibly getting nothing if you kill someone. 
---
On of the game developers even said so. He said that as a high level character and he made sure to spend all of his caps before playing it because the more you have, the more you lose. 
---
Orbital strike beacons are the strongest grenade/explosive in the game. Dense is a torso mod that decreases damage from explosives.
---
It's only 30 mins
---
Provided they make the junk fences snap together. I had to use a glitch in fo4 in order to seal those stupid gaps they had if you tried to make a wall with them. 
---
Ha! Yeah no need, they turn themselves off. Kinda annoying though materials wise. I guess I wondered if it was a common issue or if it was they way I was doing things possibly? 
---
Exellent question!
---
Yup! A pain to work with, but probably my most satisfying build.
---
I got that BE LMG, shreds people to shit. 
---
It's a NEW CHARACTER. Gah. 
---
Can you wait a week or 3?
---
This is confirmed to be coming shortly so stock up on junk.
---
why would i want or need to sneak with a heavy weapons build?  
---
I‚Äôm concerned these disconnects may be due to their modems overheating and the capacitors have started to leak.
---
How it feels to chew 5gum
---
sorry to tell ya but it is bugged, and has been since FO4, Bethesda has never fixed it, they let the modders fix it in FO4
---
I prefer to use excavator at WS personally. With calibrated shocks I carry close to 500 pounds so it‚Äôs worth popping the extra rad away to carry all the good stuff without being over encumbered. 
---
Question, you sound as if you have some PVP experience in Survival, is a Heavy Weapons build viable in Survival?  
---
that sux!
---
I really dont care much about the caps. I'm more interested in winning. I know the reward stuff is mostly junk for higher lvl ppl, but its cool to be #1.
---
The way it could be retconed into existing fo76 lore is that it's a prototype just like the x-01.
---
The lore states that the hellfire was a development was post war but nothing states that the information they obtained in researching it came wholly from post war tech and invention, parts of its development could have come from existing unused pre war designs.
---
There were many PA designs developed but never used by the American military. the enclave already used one of these designs in its x-01 project ( why else would there be a x-01 in nukaworld), it's not hard to assume the hellfire is also a brainchild of enclave reverse engineered of existing unused tech.
---
Maybe there was already a prototype early "hellfire" armor schematic and all the enclave did was develop/find duraframe to make it out of instead of common steel materials  
---
They could but if they give it all to use at once we will be filled. Then move on. Drip feed is the current state of gaming.
---
So... Change free fast travel point for free? That's not a great idea. If you REALLY can't afford the caps to move the camp (I have no idea how you're so broke) Then server hop till your camp can't be placed. 
---
I am on my 3rd alternative character for banking purposes.
---
Not the other guy but I'm going to guess because you actively make the event more difficult and continue nothing. You say 'free loot' when you're making others burn their resources to cover for you without every consenting to do so.
---
The other day a level 200 with full X01 and explosive machine gun annihilated my entire camp in under a minute. So that was cool.
---
Sorry for late reply. It is all weapons. Guns, melee anything it sucks. I might have to try uninstalling it üò´ thank you!!! üëèüèº
---
How do you know? And is that for this weeks Legendary Weapon or just in general?
---
Sneaking keeps people from locking onto you with VATS.
---
Yeah true but people literally mule all there caps prior to survival mode so some sort of debt system should be applied. I would be for a negative debuff and cap debt system.... it would stop rewarding people trying to negate the mechanic.
---
And to your point... your our of caps and dont want a negative debuff in survival?  Go back to adventure and farm,  and pay off your debt, then come back when you have the caps to play it.
---
Nope. Eventually (a min) it will respawn into your inventory. But hey, at least it only ways a magical 10 lbs for something over 100 actual in game lbs let alone what a set would weight IRL.
---
No Problem... Thanks for stopping by!
---
This comment makes no sense. Please read the post
---
Any idea if that will quickly deplete fusion cores?
---
I have 3 points in agility action girl at 3* and it‚Äôs all weapons but I‚Äôm have been using hardened combat snipers rifle mainly more recently 
---
Blinking lights?
---
My thoughts exactly 
---
I nuked the queen Sunday night.  We even managed to kill her too.  
---
I don't remember if it was on this sub or somewhere else but they are looking into this. They said that it was complicated by instances where there may be multiple quest stages with various time limits and how to convey that succinctly. Not sure if there has been any follow-up since then.
---
This has been posted here a lot. I hope people keep posting about it until it is implemented because its really annoying when that happens.  
---
no... you don't need another account for a mule. Just a new character.
---
But then no penalty for having no caps and dieing? Yet it's in adventure? 
---
That is a good suggestion, it‚Äôs the little things...
---
Agreed.
---
It is with all the weapons I use. I would attach a photo but I don‚Äôt know how. It‚Äôs a full AP bar, I have 4 points perception and 3 points agility. I do have all of the 18 mutations. Don‚Äôt know if I should have mentioned that or if it my mutations clashing with my low perk points and AP already. Sorry for the slow reply! üëèüèº
---
Yes! Yes!!
---
Yeah, I had a random encounter near the Rusty Pick with three wendigos trying to kill a protectron. At level 32, I hopped on the roof of the pick and used a lot of ammo to pick them all off. One dropped a level 50 non-legendary radium rifle with a couple of mods on it. I have absolutely no use for it as I don't pvp, but still good fun.
---
I believe the issue is what u/freeze151 said, you don't have enough action points for the rifle. Try using a pistol and see if it works.
---
I would put my 22" ultra bright diamondtron against any current LCD in terms of response rate and color accuracy. But darn if it isn't annoying having to constantly edit ini files to force the game into 1600x1200.
---
[This post](https://steamcommunity.com/app/377160/discussions/0/492379439684293839/) has some info on how to fix all the weird UI stuff that happens when you force to a non-standard resolution. That advice is strictly for 4:3 but you might be able to adapt it to your ratio.
---
I need some not-ratty nuka-cola clothes, some more signs, hell a nice Nuka-cola bed would be cool.
---
I‚Äôm new to discord.  Any suggestions on how to find people / groups?  Not sure how it works.
---
If your cards are spec'd right. Right now in it's current stats vats crits and anything that can hide you is the meta. So if you're heavy gun perks and build are correct you can def do damage.
---
If you are on PC, I would invite you to my totally non boring camp structure.
---
well i can see the advantage of that when trying to close the distance, esp me being a HW build but once I've got you in my kill zone I'm not sneaking...I'm laying lead downrange no?  Remember I'm running Ass Sent so I'm not chasing you, I'm getting pretty close then stopping and laying down a wall of lead, is this not viable?
---
Yes it does make sense. I do also have all the mutations so don‚Äôt know if any of those with my low AP anyway is making it where I can‚Äôt use it. Thanks guys! Appreciate it. Now trying a 10mm pistol :-)
---
Sweet. Will do this when i log on later. Love the cryptid lore.
---
For some reason when I wear the scout mask, my chameleon  mutation doesn't work. I wear all weightless armor but the second i put that mask on, it doesn't work. 
---
Coulda sworn it used to work when i would have my weapon out
---
Even with that the game only targets "longest life". That imo is lame. People literally just hide in chameleon so they dont appear on map. If that's the case make "most kills" the targeted person.
---
Interior walls that don't look like trash, pls. 
---
Oh! That's what's happening! Todd's mom keeps picking up the phone to make a call and killing the internet connection.
---
Your whining about there not being a penalty and players not having caps or aid items drop... I'm just saying maybe they already lost them all. Doesn't mean they should leave the server or be debuffed.
---
I was going head to head today with two other guys, after a few kills they had run out of caps/aid items etc but still kept coming back for what was there's..
---
I'm just making a point that it doesn't take long for people to lose all caps/items. Plus a debuff on them is completely pointless, if they can't kill you without a debuff, then they can't with one, so I don't see your point unless your point. You sou d salty because you camped and didn't get anything out of it. 
---
It would make the whole game more interesting if people were penalized for capless pvp. Make a debt system and make that debt follow you until you have paid it off.
---
Does the Marathoner perk not affect your AP while wearing Power Armor?
---
But I spend hours happily following hair around the map, I‚Äôd be sad ‚òπÔ∏è 
---
And get a constant debt from people waiting at train stations and never actually get to play the mode? You sound like you want spawn camping to continue.
---
yes  understood, but, pick up at level x, check its still in your inventory,and still x.... - 0.5 hrs later, wtf, now its y. and its not a 'little' off,its a lot.............bin it. keeps happening.
---
Dont spawn at a train station then. Spawn at your base and walk to the train station 
---
Hats are now guaranteed spawn locations and have become common vendor trash since that change. For example: enter the asylum, turn right into room, find pink hat. Always pink.
---
I‚Äôm sorry it bother people so much that millions of people are playing this game. 
---
Agreed
---
Its happens to me with many games.
---
&gt;and anything that can hide you 
---
What exactly does this mean?  I was thinking of a non Pa build, Ass Sent build...When I start shooting the .50 cal there is no hiding for me.  
---
I really hope they figure it out soon. The time limit seems like it would be easy to fix because of how it appears in the pip boy as completed or incompleted as you go along with the quest. Like the battle bots you have a time limit to power the bots up and then have to kill the remaining hostile creatures before the quest is officially over 
---
Before tse nerf and broking up adrenal reaction it was normal to nuke prime fisure site three times and then swap server. We killed too many queens.
---
M1 grand
---
Scaly skin reduces AP by 50 points, and talons reduces agility by -4
---
"drink this and kill hamster (0/3)"
---
These are the torso coils.   
---
Super awesome, really great capture.
---
I want weapon racks and the ability to leave power armor stored on stands that you own
---
I would love to see this, as well as a timer for each daily quest that displays next to the quest name in the data tab of the pipboy. 
---
Whats the point of pvp "survival" if everyone stores there caps and aid in adventure mode before joining survival?  Don't even get me started on how it was a terrible idea to allow fully leveled characters into s new game mode to begin with.
---
Also keep in mind that time passes much faster in game than in real life. That 5 min is equivalent to a lot more real time.
---
I'd love a legendary drill that had a wicked buff against robots like causes a panic effect in them so they run away or something.
---
Hell I'd give anything for a Two Shot "They took are jobs!" sign -w- bonus against robots.
---
There needs to be more wacky weapons in this game.
---
AA is more effective against the Sentinel &amp; Cavaliers Armor builds.
---
TSE is still a great weapon, but I would not Prime it for PVP, (it only gets a boost against Scorched)
---
Furious is good on any High ROF weapon, but for PVP you need to consider your targets weakness, Executioner's is great against the Bloodied build, and Instigating is the best against high health builds.
---
Everyone can be defeated with the right weapons, so consider using a variety.
---
I've heard of people buying extra copies of the game for more mules. This could be mules, could be UUID. Nobody knows except the account owner. 
---
Did you not read the post? I just said the first helmet is legit. You can find the plans for it in the wild. I myself have done so and I play on console. The *second* helmet is impossible to get outside the dev room. You're not supposed to get the second helmet (for now) legitimately. 
---
Do you know that you can attach walls to those scaffolds, with that you can build some sick fortresses, and the scaffolds do attach one to the other. 
---
Reminds me of xur from destiny 
---
I dont get where you assume I was camping in anything i stated but in any event:
---
You're assuming these people lost caps. I'm saying this CAN BE EXPLOITABLE. Meaning people CAN abuse this system. Again please READ the post. If their is a debuff in adventure for pvp why wouldn't their be one in survival which is pure pvp? Also good pvp fight will have an exchange of deaths. So to your point of if they cant kill you "without a debuff" shows your lack ofnpvp knowledge.
---
Depends on what level and how powerful your guns are. Takes me like 20-30 min each time 
---
Make that swap only for OOC, and that‚Äôs not a bad trade off. 
---
I think someone already did. That's how we got the effects of Nukashine.
---
They ought to add a condition meter to liquor so you only take a swig at a time until the condition is gone. Like maybe 10 drinks per bottle. It would help offset the high weight of each bottle. 
---
Yes, I've heard it from my friend that it helps and internet agrees
---
I use [Fallout 76 wiki](https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Power+Armor+Mods) to check what PA mod effects. Hope it helps.
---
I'm for that. Doesnt have to be a 3hr penalty, but some kinda of "pay what you owe" system makes sense.
---
Lol this is awesome. 
---
I will like this post every day you make it. I want to make a railway rifle a viable weapon.
---
I think a timer would be good and as for the problem with mid event timers simply put "started" instead of a timer.  Might also encourage people to join more events.
---
They can turn the whitespring security hostile if you‚Äôre hit with the torso mod I think. 
---
I think there is a discord linked in the sidebar but I'm on my Android phone and I forget how to look at it.  This is the one I use for "trading" but there is also a nuke channel and grahm chanel I make use of.   So once you have discord installed use the server link to like add it to your server list (should open automatically in discord) and go from there.   
---
https://discord.gg/VQhJ9KV
---
1000%, often listening to the songs on it on my work break. If it had a DJ it'd probably be my favourite station as it's got so many decent tunes, surprised me not more people on this thread are about it but I guess old school jazz and swing isn't everyones cup of tea. 
---
I don't know anyone who is using it.
---
Your first time will take around an hour. 
---
So plan to play for two hours. Thats how I determine if I'm doing a nuke.
---
After doing them a few times I can get it done in under 30min.
---
yes please!
---
I've never experienced that when it rains... No offense, as I'm no expert *(I have just enough knowledge to tinker and inevitably break stuff lol)*, but that all sounds like client-side issues.
---
For example, it isn't really "raining" on the server, it is just keeping track of things and in turn, telling our game "cue rain effect!". As such, rain and clouds are a post-process effect which technically adds a bit more workload behind the rendering (though, it could reduce it if it's early morning with massive amounts of light rays casting shadows). Since there's an overlay effect also present (drops on the screen if in PA) then it could in theory cause some asset glitching to happen.  
---
As far as the invincible enemies, assuming you mean non-players (since apparently that's an issue in Survival Mode), then my only guess with that comes back to the potential increase in computation time, leading to issues in confirmations that you've hit your target. 
---
If you're on a console then... may not be the case unless it's the original X1 or PS4 models. Makes more sense for a lower-end PC. Particularly laptops, unless it's a $2000 model. They tend to not only have thermal constraints which reduce performance, but also are designed for low-power usage and max their power delivery circuits out which reduces performance because things can't run full speed.   
---
(For anyone who **does** game on a laptop, it's ideal to make sure your "Power Plan" *\[right-click Battery icon in bottom right of screen and click "Power Options"\]* is set to High Performance while gaming *\[and plugged into the wall\]*.)
---
Uranium ?
---
I lose 400caps on death, i never have caps in survival, because when i die after killing 5people i am on zero caps again
---
No - they don‚Äôt seem to deplete fusion cores from what I‚Äôve noticed. I run them on my X01 set
---
I can't find the post now, but someone from Bethesda said it's ok to have the assault mask now. They've banned he people responsible for it, but they aren't going to do anything to the thousands of people that have learned the plan or have one in their stash. Every time I've traded with someone, they've given me one so I could scrap to learn the plan. Got it first try but everyone keeps giving me one anyway. The community is great.
---
yes....yes....YES....this is quality stuff right here.   I've always been a melee or shotgun build so I need all the help I can get, thank you for the incite.  
---
Wow what a homophobe.  To attack me so unprovoked simply because of my sexual orientation.  Way to go Hitler. 
---
The asset for it already exists in game, so adding the functionality back shouldn‚Äôt be that hard.
---
And it‚Äôs jukebox. And the Nukashine sign. 
---
It's marine armor helmet, not assault marine helmet. This ain't fo4
---
Good. If you lost all your stuff...go back to adventure and farm more. There should be a penalty.
---
read my mind.
---
Depends, like others said it can be quick, like 20 minutes... noobies usually take an hour or more. 
---
Oh my fuck, I am checking this out tonight. 
---
The best part about these spoilers is that, vault dwellers would totally swap crazy stories... so it doesn't feel like a spoiler!
---
Soo.. only fast travel to events and 76 then?
---
So hmm.. not navy, must be coast guard or maybe  Air Force?  Lol
---
Also they need to change a few events to start a new timer once you start for events such as irrational fear.
---
Agree. I have the explosion type mutations and the Tesla coils trigger more often. They are great for WS nukes as I basically get a hit on any enemies around me, which means you also get to loot all of them.
---
Agreed, that needs to be a thing
---
You‚Äôre one of those guys... 
---
I'm guessing 2 things. Either
---
1) They were planning on making it legit from the get-go, but Time Constraints or something else forced them to only allow the Tac helmet for now (Support responses say it'll be arriving at a later date so if true, the Assault helmet will eventually get added into the game legitimately). Diving into the code reveals a lot of stuff that was cut/dummied out alongside some dev messages (did you know we were supposed to get a reward for participating in the B.E.T.A and we were supposed to get a Christmas login gift?). There's a whole reddit thread detailing this stuff
---
2) My second guess is this is just a leftover from reusing many assets from 4 (hence why Dog Armor exists and shows up in the apparel slot when you loot it from Attack Dogs despite not having a Dog companion to put it on)
---
It's definitely viable, especially if you're a sentinel. 
---
Its an event, so make sure that is happening before you get bored and leave. Sometimes you being there will trigger it.
---
Wait, I can kill any old wendigo for the clown suit quest? That quest sent me to the cave you mentioned and although I'm sure I completed it, it was in my quest log again the next time I played. I haven't done it again yet because I still have so much other fun stuff to do, none of which is close to that cave, so it'd be nice to find a different wendigo if that does work.
---
Yes please. I'd also like more rifle weight reduction in the game, unless I missed it I don't think there's a perk for making them not heavy.
---
I can't even get Camden Park to trigger everyday. It will take me forever to get those 450 tokens.
---
Once you have completed the quest, you can only carry one at a time, so all the others you had in inventory disappeared, but if you had stored them in your stash, you could get them one at a time, and turn them in.
---
Yeah it is vendor bait, that is it
---
Ah YES! Bring back the Chryslus Highwayman from Fallout 2!
---
Don't forget it comes with mobile stash!
---
While you are correct here, it's HIGHLY unlikly anybody names their account a random string of letters and numbers. Even mule accounts will be named something easy to type in. Since you have to log in almost everytime you launch the game...So yes, nobody knows except the account owner. However, your original statement of "__probably__ mules" is probably wrong...
---
I miss the bunker option. For my camp I tried the big concrete wall, but watch the sorched just run through them...
---
You read my mind!
---
It's an exploit of the mechanics. You really think the developers intention is for you to transfer all your caps to an alt?  Please get real
---
OP your suggestion makes too much sense and would be too big of a quality of life boost to actually happen
---
I sometimes watch the nuke from camp because it is on a high place with a good view or i go just outside of the blast zone
---
every type of gun is missing one type of perk. It's their half baked idea on how to do weapon variety so it's intentional, just bad design. 
---
Ecological Balance is also rubbish because, even if you‚Äôve already unlocked the computer before, you still need to go get it from the ice cream place. It would be better if you just had to get the holotapes.
---
Try the courtyard at the Whitespring. At least I'm pretty sure there is aster there.
---
Stealth boys, chameleon mutation or legendary effect.  Vats crits seem to ignore most damage reduction if not all of it lol.  So being invisible means vats can't target you.  
---
there's a group of very mysterious cabins in that area..that's all I'm saying  ;)
---
Democracy is non-negotiable 
---
You buy the plan so you can make a ton and scrap them to learn mods, so you can mod your legendary. 
---
I have a dumb question about nuke launching... If you lose the robots during the final part of the mission can you still salvage the launch or is it a wasted effort at that point?
---
Give yourself 2 hours. 1 for the bunker, 1 for the target. I just went from entering bunker to dead queen. Took an hour and a half.
---
I'm around the same level. What I do for some xp is don some power armor and run around one tapping the monsters with a sledgehammer (all rise) and running away. Works especially well at whitesprings because of the bots.
---
I had a horrible workshop defence with 2 scorchbeasts, not only did the bastard disintegrate in mid air meaning I couldn't find his corpse to loot but he had also flown out of range of the workshop which meant I got no rewards from defending it!!
---
Get one gun army for stagger. When you open up on them you better finish them because you‚Äôre right you will have very little stealth.
---
Ah well.. thanks for letting me know. You've saved me a lot of materials 
---
Good point! I edited and made paragraphs. Thank you for pointing that out. 
---
They allegedly stack and its alleged only propose is pve making you more stealthy
---
But if you roll with an entire marine armor with no clothes over it, then cosmetically it would be nice to have he helmet to match in the game.  What‚Äôs the point of any clothing aside from cosmetics? I think that‚Äôs why people want it, if you look at it as a clothing piece. Like a beer hat for instance 
---
i heard that what you do is trade in your unused legendaries for "legendary tokens", and that lets you buy new legendaries. whether they're clearly "you are buying this specific item i have for sale" or a random roll i don't know. hell, the token system may have been a speculative lie too, i don't know. it's the internet.
---
Yeah the light string from the atom shop, if you build the blinking ones, they reflect the Nuka Cola on the wall from the dorm room.
---
Quick question on that, if you have, say 60 tech data's on your chatacter, when you put the data in the wall receptacle,  does it remove all of them?
---
I'm pretty sure of what it is, but honestly you should check it out yourself to avoid spoilers as it is pretty cool.
---
Pipe Weapons benefit from both rifleman and gunslinger perks, tbh I‚Äôve been using my 1* AA pipe rifle instead primarily despite having several ‚Äúnicer‚Äù handmades and lever actions. 
---
That AA pipe rifle takes out level 62 mutants and ghouls in a single hit 95% of the time and had damage in the 200s per shot.
---
Yes these players ... we need a kick off server function like instances in Warcraft ,3 votes and your off server for a more helpful minded player
---
huh what does that mean
---
??? Had no idea this was a thing, will have to check it out later
---
What are you guys gonna do about crushing blow. I must have killed 60 legendaries and stayed up all night long and maybe 6 registered. I stayed in servers awhile and server hoppped. Nothing works. I lost hundreds of caps and tons of aid and junk trying to get it. I want that weapons I earned it. I use my own hard earned money in the atom shop. How are you going to correct this?
---
since a full day goes by in like 20 minutes 2-5 minutes is probably a few hours at least.
---
Fully agreed OP. Give is those BoS assets so we can build more in theme BoS outposts!
---
Also let us build ASAMs so we can fend off scorchbeasts properly.
---
Yes, first time i've experienced it was in October last year. Only in December i figured out what was going on in that area.
---
Doesn't Chameleon mutation only work when squatting, thus making Ass Sent useless if being engaged?  Stealth boys another story, I guess if you really wanna do well then you need to be stealth boyed up.
---
Stealthboys deactivate when firing
---
Never understood why my character has the time to do the spinning thing while being mauled in the face by a deathclaw. 
---
Yup. Everyone that passes by those cabins hears it. Go back and read all the lore üëç
---
First time about 1.5 hours. Now faster then my crew can make ammo to kill the queen.
---
You bought the plans?  Because you don't need the materials if you buy the mod.  The mod is complete but it's a one-time-use thing.  If you buy the plans, you need the materials, but you can craft as many as you want forever as long as you have the materials.
---
Someone once posted that the 'siren' you can build does this, but I've never tested it.. Anyone know?
---
That's awesome ! My first shots used to miss all the time so I stopped using my Gauss a while ago . Picked it up again and it's dead accurate 
---
Yea, I'm trying to avoid PA....I have a mixed set of Ass Sent I'm gong to be using....
---
They are coming out with Patch 8 with new stuff and bug fixes, but this is just a hotfix to deal with two things. 
---
i had two railway rifles. i thought they were the coolest until i realized i was doing less damage than my backup pistol (which i wasn't even specced in, it was literally just a backup emergency weapon for when i was out of rifle ammo)
---
Just hotfixs
---
My God I know. Extra salt in the wound that it's one of the few that work.
---
Ok so not that useful 
---
I don't need an audio alarm. I just want some sort of obvious and consistent on screen notifications.
---
For survival
---
Armor: sentinel assassin legendary pieces. If not those then whatever catches your fancy. Actual armor stats don't mean much in pvp. Get dense mod on cheat piece.
---
 
---
Perks: armor penetration and perks that increase percentage of damage not taken. Avoid sneak based perks (sneak attack is disabled). Avoid perks that add armor. 
---
Weapons: for a rifle build you want a handmade. Legendary effect that helps the most is 25% increase fire rate. Other legendary effects have some bonus in damage but much less than you think.
---
Just want to add the Blade of Bastet is a valid 1-H option, especially as leveling as you get the crafting schemes as part of the reward from the quest-line, so it levels with you.  Lots of people overlook armor penetration on that thing.  
---
Limits  the effect of any exploit as well as a cap on in game economy transactions.
---
Does the damage change back once reloading is finished and you begin firing?
---
Naw let peeps grow them just put a really low growth rate on them.
---
Anyone know how long these usually take? Trying to decide if I want to wait or just do something else
---
Hotfix. Check twitter
---
Not consistently. And, if it does, definitely not as obvious as it should be.
---
That's why i have only one character since BETA. I don't play that much to invest in too many characters. Getting all the plans costs a lot and takes some time.
---
I wouldn't wait. A couple times these updates have been quick, most of the time they take forever. 
---
Fast travel wherever you want. Not the point if your crying about spawn campers. Doesn't mean you should get a pass so you dont have to pay caps because you stored all of yours on a mule somewhere. Spawn camping sucks dont get me wrong,  and they need to work on the system that allows for you to spawn in completely without taking damage.. but that don't mean you get a free ride in pvp.
---
*it's almost like they didn't fully think the card system through*
---
*It's almost like they rarely think something all the way through*
---
As I understand it; Items will re-spawn as you enter an area every 20 hours, but is another player enters the area and does not pick the item up, you may see another sooner.
---
Items will not re-spawn with a player in the immediate area, and some items will not re-spawn for 45 minutes after someone picks them up.
---
Lots of factors affecting things, so that's why you find some spawns a lot and others very seldom.
---
That means he's not spoiling what's there
---
It does but you can get over your head there. At 98, there are 2-3 lvl 52 gutsies you find first, then the sentry is by himself. It's not too hard to 1v1, but of course it's easier with friends. 
---
Yes, I bought plans; I couldn't find the mod at the time.  Thanks.
---
The whole event should be level locked to 50+ and anyone under that should autoflag as a pvp target
---
I know its a cap, but why? and what does limit effect of exploits mean unless there is an exploit to create caps.
---
When you go in the room there's a machine with mainframe cores next to what looks like a large concrete garage door.  That has I think 15 broken cores on it you need to remove and replace with repaired cores.
---
Hahaha
---
Noob question, but I got my free cap and now can‚Äôt find it. Do I need a plan to make it or should it appear in my inventory?
---
Wait, so the gunslinger perks will effect an automatic pipe rifle??
---
Yes, hopefully you get yours off first.Instantly makes pistols viable.
---
Maybe I‚Äôm doing wrong but when I get close enough to interact with it and ‚Äúmilk‚Äù it nothing happens.  Checked my inventory and nothing shows up. Pardon the pun but I‚Äôm udderley at a loss.
---
Any ideas?
---
Careful posting videos like this.  Undermeshing like this is very much a ban-able offence in alot of games.  
---
Your original post sure makes it look like you don't know how vendors work if you server hopped 5 times hoping it would have caps.
---
Quite a few people I've talked to are of the consensus that the Queen is buffed for 24 players now, no matter how many people actually show up.  I'm not sure about this, but I do know she is a hell of alot harder to kill now than she used to be. I don't particularly mind the lower levels trying to participate in the event when they come prepared and actually get involved with the adds and at the very least lower their HP to the point where me and whoever else is doing damage can stop pouring our hard earned ammo into the Queen and swat them rather quickly or let my plates finish them off.  I remember when I was at lower level and realized my melee build wasn't doing anything to the Queen, my whole entire goal became focused on keeping the adds off the 3 or 4 higher levels who were actually getting the job done and killing the Queen.  I'd run around with my axe in one hand and a stimpak in the other and freaking participate instead of hiding in the trenches or the bunker. At the very least I'd keep moving and hit the Queen with a Endangerol dart as often as possible.  I nearly was always thanked by someone for helping and if I wasn't, it was enough to know that I did participate and actually earned the few rewards that dropped for me.  More than once here lately, I've geared up and joined only to find 1/2 a dozen or so level 20's or even lower crammed into whatever building or bunker was around and doing nothing whatsoever and only 1 or 2 higher levels who prolly initiated the strike, with no weapons of consequence on them and no chance to kill the bitch at all who are just running around killing adds and totally ignoring the Queen.  I'm not going to burn through 3k rounds of ultracite ammo just to get her to 1/2 health with 20 seconds left.  When I see that scenario unfolding, I usually leave or just start picking flowers. I have never gotten anything off the Queen that was "Holy Cow", look what I got!! anyway.  It's always been about the teamwork with other players and the feeling that comes from realizing that everyone did their best, whether we killed her or not. I can't do anything about low levels coming to this event, I just can hope that if you do, get off your ass and try to help out. 
---
Edit:  Good thing I looked this post over and realized an Endangerol fart wasn't really doing much damage to the Queen either.
---
I think they did say this was coming eventually, but I could be remembering wrong
---
One of those guys.... that loose caps in pvp, yeah. So what...who cares ill earn more.
---
Nice link.   
---
Yes.
---
This. It sucks
---
Isn't cap limit good for the game? If there wasn't a cap limit, bots would be doing west tek runs 24/7 and a decent gear would be worth like 100k caps
---
Yes, definitely worth playing. The map is fantastic and fun to explore.
---
To fix this, make the green thumb perk 3 or more stars and each level allows more rare plants to be planted.
---
Lol it takes me two shots with my legendary dragon to kill them
---
You've probably tried, but if your TV has a 'PC' input that usually gets rid of overscan. 
---
Yup can confirm my first run alone was a train wreck and got me off guard. Ehen I finally got to the number pet I punched in the wrong last digit. So left empty handed. 
---
I didn't know we were supposed to get a reward for the B.E.T.A. nor login gifts. Interesting.
---
As long as the assault helmet is coming at a later date, then it's all good. Thankfully a helmet being only cosmetic or not is minimal.
---
Found out the other day frogs now drop intestines, so you can make sausage....

hmmmmmmmmmmmok

---
why?
---
Surface to air is so bugged. Not only does this happen but the scorched keep spawning directly on or in the ASAM.
---
I‚Äôm using an Xbox One X with an HDMI cable connected to my Sony Bravia TV. 
---
Actually no.  Chameleon armor works that way.  The mutation works if you're standing and not moving.  Gun can be drawn too.   However, you can't be wearing armor for that to work, except weightless prefix armor.
---
You should get someone to stand outside in a suit and be security. 
---
I frequently lose a few robots and the event never fails. Maybe you need at least 1 alive at the end?
---
My level is 137. I carry an endangerol syringer and a zealots gatling plasma with a prime receiver when I am going into scorched earth (I bring a few other weapons, although the patch that improved my gatling's durability helped a ton). 
---
I've only been in one event that we were able to kill her when there were a ton of lower levels there, and it seemed like every person was concentrating some kind of fire on her. We only had maybe 1:20 left on the timer, so we were cutting it close. 
---
I play on the xb1 and have been seeing a ton of new characters in the last 2 to 3 weeks. 
---
has anyone actually found something ? up and down that area.... nowt
---
One of the developers straight up said so that you should get rid of your caps before going into survival mode so you will have none to lose. He claims that he himself got rid of his caps by spending them.   So  yes, it is an a game mechanic that the developers intended. 
---
&gt;You really think the developers intention is for you to transfer all your caps to an alt?
---
You are making an assumption with this statement with no proof that it's even true.  Why   are you convinced that that every single one of them is transferring to an alt?  Because that's what you do yourself?    
---
How do you know they aren't spending them all before going into survival, the the game developer I mentioned?   
---
But even still, spending them or transferring to an alt... what's the difference?  In both cases, the guy you killed has no caps. 
---
Nah the debuff for player damage cant be part of survival experience, otherwise you could easily grind people to 0 caps and then prevent them from ever shooting back, thus making it far less competetive arena. I myself always try to have some caps on me because of the inconvenieces lack of them give - cant FT besides camp/friends, cant move camp etc. Just the inability to move camp is a very severe tactical hinderance. If they bring that mechanic to survival, anybody that is not part of PvP gang just couldn't compete there at all.
---
Rng 
---
Why? And what do u mean bots?
---
Ppl will pay what they think is fair. They already create multiple characters to spend 50k on somthing.
---
This is not the annoyance with events currently. I have done several events where the next phase never triggers, enemies don't spawn, the enemies spawn in walls, enemies spawn underground but I have to say the biggest annoyance is doing a horde event and arriving just to watch the horde leader killed by not another player but by another mob. I have had several horde events where I finally track down the pack only to watch super mutants/mole miners/ deathclaw/ ghouls, scorched finish off the horde boss. And when that happens I get no rewards for the event. 
---
Just to be clear on this, that means no update to download right? I'm still not all familiar with this sort of stuff yet :)
---
The worst is when you do it on a monday afternoon.   Get all the way to the end, just to find that the launch codes you have are from last week.  
---
If I recall there's a guaranteed legendary spawn inside watoga hospital top floor usually a super mutant. 
---
Limits the effect of cap farmers in Asia can have on the in game economy.
---
Remember in WOW back in the old days you had people in Asia whose real paid job was to farm gold.
---
I'm level 132 and never got the achievement for hitting level 100. Bethesda said there's nothing they can do...
---
Might just be out of luck. 
---
I am sure it is not completely random.
---
Yeah you can just farm up stealth boy consumables if you want.  I mean stealth isn't required, it's just the meta.  I have a vats crit character now but my melee guy is still fully capable of sprinting in with cavalier and punching people to death.  He is just level 200 and loses 400 caps when he dies so I made the vats crit alt.  I have a level 90 heavy Gunner too but it's become my mule for now so I haven't taken them into at serious PvP lol
---
There's never a set amount of time, just check the twitter and Bethesda.Net every one in a while. 
---
i think as long as you're moving and not sneaking you'll get destroyed, fair enough when you stand still but you've still got to move to get to that point.
---
I bought a new ps4, tv, psn account and upgraded my internet connection so my fiance and I could play together because we both loved fallout4. we did the beta together and have been adventuring around and met many people, traded, had fun times, had terrible times, but after all of it we both still love and play this game. 
---
I say all this because I want you to know that its a FUN game. There are and will always be crappy players at times and server issues as well as terrible RNG. We both have over 400 hours into the game on our accounts and are not looking at stopping. A mic is a huge plus BTW.
---
If you try it, you'll be facing tons of robot enemies and turrets. Bring along a Troubleshooter's weapon if you can.
---
Pre the latest patch I could shoot em out the sky in less than 5 seconds due to the consecutive crits on my commando build. Still pretty easy now they patched it tho..maybe 10 seconds.
---
Assassin sentinel is more hype than reality. These people thought they were going to break pvp, but if you encounter one a vats crit headshot downs them instantly. No jumping can dodge it. 
---
Also, spawn camping is getting fixed today
---
I've had those trigger when fast traveling to Welch and Grafton stations and a few times at Camp Venture.  It's all bugged out.
---
It's in adventure to deter harassment. Survival mode encourages PvP so they removed the feature, and even changed how bounties work. Also it applied to a WANTED person being killed with no caps. Not in mutual PvP, which is essentially what Survival is.
---
Some easy atoms, at last!
---
Squares would be superior
---
No not guaranteed, you‚Äôll find the occasional non legendary crowns.
---
Which platform?
---
I may just buy the plans for them so I can supplement my runs I usually never get legendaries because people are kinda greedy and refuse to use weaker weapons to allow everyone else to get a shot.
---
Plague Walker is pretty good as a supplement as well, especially when you get radworms and don't bother using disease cures on that.
---
Do you think contacting someone from PlayStation could fix it? 
---
Looks awesome jacob. Good job I'll be on tonight to see any fights and maybe be in a few.
---
probably
---
Yeah 50k caps sound all good and nice but how you gonna compete with some that's got like 2 million caps?
---
Maybe the problem lies with people not focusing fire on her then? I had never heard about her having a max health until your comment. 
---
I think it would be super cool to give a constant XP boost to the top 3 (or 5, or 10) so that there's an incentive to BE in the top 3.
---
That makes sense, stealth boy up and then let loose. 
---
Sentinel armor is not as op as everyone thinks. VATS crit headshot and they are down
---
I think everything re sets today
---
Oh.. the Horde Events- Spend 30 caps to start the event.. 50/50 shot that that will be it right there ..I can Kill the horde leader... But oh wait now you must search for the horde boss. 25 caps to go here , 5 caps to go there , 20 caps to go to this place, 30 caps to go to that place... 4/4 you have found the horde but must travel to one last place to kill him now that he has been found - Fast travel to him ...ANDddddddd Another player kills him before I can get to him .. event over. LOL I check the dead legendary just to make sure it was a legendary .. I don't know why .. I just do .. /Sad Panda
---
Do you know if dodgy works? 
---
I do this constantly and feel stupid. 
---
The real MVP...
---
Was it the design head who stated this was the intent of the system? (Hint: No) Or a wall texture painter who does not like losing caps when he plays?  
---
My wife did the same after watching me play, she really likes ‚Äúshopping‚Äù (scavenging clothes/junk, mostly clothes) and building our camps. It‚Äôs been so much fun having her with me to explore and adventure the wasteland!
---
Not Interested in Junkie's 
---
I'd assume so. Seem ls to get a lare update every week with smaller sales and limited time items in between. There's a bunch of stuff datamined recently so would suprise me if we got 3/4 new items today and then a big drop on the 9th for the cryptid DLC. 
---
I'm not saying it should resemble reality. This .50 machine gun is a joke compared to RL. I just want a shot to the head deal significantly more damage than a shot in the foot. 
---
I'm at level 120 now, the shotgun I'm using is a quad double barrel that deals about 150 dmg now. I stood in front of a lvl 68 scorched, and shot it within +/- 1m (about 3 feet for you americorns) smack in the face and it didn't die. That just feels wrong.
---
Last 60 levels I haven't been able to find any weapon that deals descent damage. It's like progress of your character just stops at lvl 50. What's the point in leveling further? 
---
Bethesda is a joke. Giving me a proper laff.
---
Awesome 
---
I feel like it would be better to have decks instead of Passive cards. Having a deck for building, gathering, and fighting that we can pre-set and switch between from the Pip-Boy. I do miss the perk system from NV and 3, but I think adding passive cards defeats the purpose of the current card system. Lock-picking and hacking perks aren‚Äôt as important as they have been in other fallouts, because you can have someone else help you with it. I mainly use rifles and it‚Äôs annoying to switch cards to open doors. Instead I use the hacker perks and my buddy uses the lock-picking perks. On the other hand I have all the building and crafting perks so he doesn‚Äôt have to. I have a feeling they want you to play with friends and plan things as a team. Yeah it sucks to always pull up the perk menu with its long ass load time and that stupid animation when you have points to spend, but it‚Äôs nice knowing that you can easily change your build over time like you couldn‚Äôt in the other games. I‚Äôve been using single shot rifle for over 100 levels now but after using perfect storm for the first time I might switch to automatic rifles and it‚Äôs super easy!
---
Doesnt necessarily have to be a dmg debuff but some type of penalty 
---
That's a different problem entirely. I dont disagree with you but that's just bug fixes to come and the wasteland. I'm talking about something totally different 
---
I was very skeptical, but decided to buy it only a few days ago, at around the time the patch Appalachia wilds patch hit, I've been having a blast co-oping with my best friend.  But it goes without saying it is not always without its bugs, most glaringly for myself was the ingame voice chat failing continuesly after a few minutes of playing. We ended up using discord instead.
---
One of the most fun things about fallout games, this one included is finding little secret corners... like.. a hidden underground communist base or even a small hideout underneath the foundation of a building... and most of these places tell a story through visual means... For example skeletons laying on the ground arms barely touching a door, clawmarks on said door and inside another skeleton with a tin of rat poison next to him..
---
There are all kinds of fun &amp; whacky things to find. The world seems larger and never "full" of players to the point where you feel like "damn, this place has been swept clean and looted allready.", it's great for solo-play as well as small groups. We only played on the adventure mode... most players we came across were exceedingly friendly even offering some higher level items, though the gesture was nice, we mostly declined it, because we felt it'd give us too far of an edge.. We also played from the getgo without using stimpacks, only blood packs, healing salves and food, to add some more difficulty in a sense. We found ourselves not needing stimpacks. Though we are only level 15.
---
They removed it from Survival. The debuff was for WANTED people who were harassing. Not intended as a punishment if you die to much in regular PvP.
---
I just wanna release the kraken lol
---
uGridsToLoad seems to contradict your circle theory though, but I could be wrong. 
---
My understanding was that's why that INI setting needs to be an Odd number, due to how it loads these grids (a 5x5 area as I understand it), so that you're always in a middle grid-square.  
---

What?
---
Or even better would be a series of Enclave quests that you can do to enhance your scout armour with legendary effects. Different quests could reward different effects.
---
Most likely.  Atom store gets a big update weekly and smaller additions in between.  Lots of stuff in the files for the store so wouldnt suprise me if we got 3/4 new things today and a big atom store update on the 9th.
---
I love it! I wish I played on xbox so I could visit.
---
If you die that much you failed at surviving.  You absolutely should have a debuff.   Sneak away or something.   This is not a small deathmatch map.  Could walk for hours without seeing anyone.
---
As long as they got it in game or through trading with no cap exploits, then why not?
---
There's definitely an explanation in the notes and holotapes in the area. 
---
That has more a less been the case since fo76 came out, but more then it should be honestly lol.
---
The damage scaling for low levels vs high levels is crazy, that's one of the things that causes greifers to create new lower level characters with Over powered gear, it scales up and one shots high levels.
---
It's good in concept but was implemented so far pretty harshly. 
---
I went to one the other day and ended up having to leave and come back with a change of weapons as I dont usually carry around the heavy guns required to actually be any help to anyone against her. 
---
You can cryolator them in the air, so they freeze (I don't know how, just saw it happen once).
---
And scorch beast require a loot pool that is premium, and every 5-10 kill you get a premium loot.
---
But that would require bethesda to acknowledge their loot system is absolutely braindead, and change it (with a 5 minute code) and that won't happen.
---
We already have, perhaps, a legendary seller incoming, that would be huge !
---
I kill most enemies with one hit to the head. Stealth sniper build is great lol
---
Explain how having a pvp penalty would deter harassment? The harasser is usually the one doing the killing. The harassee would be the one suffering if he/she has no caps....
---
Heavy weapons don't need expensive ammo, outside of the flamer and cryolater. 
---
Plasma cores are cheap, and scorchbeasts generally engage at a distance. I wish I had your gatling plasma. I use GP's all the time vs scorchbeasts, but nowhere near god tier drops. 
---
However, what I was referring to was literally exploding bats out of the sky with the heavy explosives user while feathering on a jetpack. I've also built fortresses with stairs platforms where you are at even height (or even above) the scorchbeasts, and can literally punch them out of the sky. 
---
If you're on PC, I can help you out with PA jetpacks. 
---
The rewards are there, the loot tables just have extremely rare drops on them. YMMV on their relative value. Personally, I love butchering scorchbeasts for their meat, and make cranberry meatball grinders out of them for +40 max hp. Prime receiver plans / ultracite PA recipes / rarer drops exclusive to their loot tables are nice too. . . and I'm actually constantly low on ultracite. 
---
Might as well do away with perks like lockpick.
---
Seriously, utility and qol perks are and have always been a choice in Fallout. They should limit swapping perks to only around your camp or near a stashbox. 
---
Commit to a build when you set out, and if you picked more damage then you don't get the loot from locked containers or rooms.
---
If you bought the plans just check at a power armor station. It will tell you.
---
11 letters ? lol, just joking :)
---
Used to. Sometimes yet.
---
100+
---
We've got a bouncer who will handle any ruffians! And no psychobuff in the bathroom!
---
I have my favourite foods and drinks on my favourites wheel, glowing meat steaks for melee damage, iguana soup for +3 luck and cranberry relish for bonus XP, purified water and whatever alcohol I have the most of at the time, I don‚Äôt bother picking up anything else other than dog food as a backup as it would just be forgotten about, I have more food and drink on my favourites wheel than I do guns lol

Far as I'm aware, any wendigo works. It just points you to the wendigo cave because it will always be a guaranteed spawn.
---
There's nothing there to kill and the flora is very sparse. 
---
I think it‚Äôs the reward that‚Äôs the problem. I don‚Äôt mind switching the perks out when a legendary is behind the door, but opening safes aren‚Äôt really worth it. If a level three safe had a chance at a legendary i might keep it on. As it is now though I think it should scale with level. It‚Äôs odd to me that if I have master lock picking equipped I can‚Äôt get into anything higher than a level 1 lock. Make us keep a card equipped, and as we get to higher levels we can switch it out for the next one maybe? Maybe if we keep the other two on it just makes lock picking easier somehow.
---
I dislike the horde events so much that I dont even fool with them. Uranium fever is my favorite way to gaurentee a legendary (or 3) but it takes 2 minutes on my ancient ps4 to even fast travel and load in so usually I can get the mining rig to start but theres a good chance I wont be able to 
---
Whenever a nuke is going off I always fast travel to a nearby location to take pictures, then I join in the fun
---
&gt;  Sony Bravia TV
---
Not sure how your TV runs its settings, but most have a Display settings / Input settings where you can choose 16:9, Zoom, Full etc. Full Pixel is without overscan. If its an Android TV its settings may be on the home screen down the bottom. May need to disable 'auto display' and set to full pixel manually. 
---
I wanna make my camp look like the inside of that frat house building 
---
Says QoL, asks for balance changes.
---
Normally sure, but not that area. There are only two places to kill anything (and it's usually a single gulper or fog crawler) and the flora is sparse and not varied. 
---
Ya.  I have my camp right around that area.  I can hear them all the time.
---
Explore the area to find the source.  It's a nice little area with an fun story.  A bobblehead and magazine spawn area too.
---
There‚Äôs a million items they cut out from the building menu... why?! Idk. Autism speaks in BSG 
---
Did the same thing but on PS4.
---
I also lose 400 caps on death, however, I keep 9k caps on me and just don't die that often.  I think the 400 caps is too high (one change that should be made) but I also think transferring your caps to an alt is cheating (2nd change that needs to be made)
---
It also depends on the server. Best way to check is go farming at Whitesprings - if you encounter a mob with 5-6 legendaries in one go, STAY ON THAT SERVER! Travel around and hit all the hot spots and don't forget to check vendors for hard to find mods. I would say I land on these servers 1/10 times each cycle.
---
You could try adding more power connectors on the walls. It may be something silly like what you're placing is at the extreme-edge of where power can be supplied by the connector, and once it loads back in the game doesn't recognize it... Unless you're using a light that needs a physical power wire ran to it. Then I've got nothin! :( heh
---
They also want one way realistic damage in PvE, one shot all enemies but be a bullet sponge themselves, with magic armor and weapons. 
---
I agree on the .50 though, seems pointless. 
---
I'm just telling you that you'll potentially be making other people (that may have spent ages fighting high-level enemies in a nuke silo) fail the event. Ever see angry people posting here saying "We've failed 3 SBQ fights this week"? This is often why.
---
What you do with this info is up to you.
---
For comparison, my old x01 that I created with 6 intelligence has roughly 20% less durability than the one I created with 30 intelligence. This is with mods attached so it‚Äôs significant. But, stuff created around 20 intelligence is virtually similar just a few percent lower durability than 30 intelligence. So usually couple mentats (+5 intelligence one) would do the trick 
---
Do you suppose it's only vats critical hits?
---
Reward could also include the caps it cost to fast travel to the event 
---
i appreciate the advice
---
Fort Defiance cemetery, lots there
---
It is actually in violation of rule 10 to post this suggestion, since it is on the list, but they don't really enforce that rule, it seems.
---
I totally agree that it sucks to get a kill and receive no reward in terms of caps or loot drops from the player. But I think the better way to go would be for the game to generate caps out of thin air to reward the victor. I think this would help reinforce a positive feedback loop for survival mode. The current meta is to carry no junk and as few valuable aid items as possible, peppered with useless aid items; it becomes a balancing act of how much do you takeout to help you in a fight vs how much you‚Äôre comfortable risking upon death. People who carry little or no aid items are inherently disadvantaged in a pvp situation, and are likely to lose way more fights than they win. A player who also has no caps to reward is also someone who can only spawn in at their (or their teams) camp, and at 76, as fast traveling anywhere else costs caps. 
---
So yeah. I definitely feel your pain, but I think the solution is going to require a lot more nuance from Beth.
---
Reports say that it does not. I didn‚Äôt thoroughly tested it so I can‚Äôt confirm  
---
I mostly see flatwoods monsters in the savage divide and the North part of toxic valley. Basically I've only seen them in mountainous areas.
---
The screech attack is both energy and explosive, so (heavy) leather armor, dense mod + fireproof is great
---
Its because they wanted your characters to be fully, cosmetically customisable. You can wear outfits over armor, but nothing over a helmet.
---
Thanks, yeah I have tried that. Have tried also giving them separate power connectors and plugging them directly into a fusion core generator. No dice
---
If you suck I don't mind you having a penalty. It's survival, not deathmatch.  Go hide and get more shit.  2k caps can be earned a day just grabbing cap stashes and selling shit.
---
I hope the raids have enemies and minor challenges, and do not end if you fail. The casual players want fun too. Destiny failed right there with the raids being impossible for casuals. Difficulty levels for skilled players would be beneficial too, so everyone can play the raids and have fun.
---
I honestly don't know, but it can't hurt. Worst they can say is no.
---
I'm on Xbox and not too worried about it, I figure I'll get another character to 100 eventually, which will give me another shot at the achievement. Let me know how you make out!
---
Inventory management is an absolute pain in the ass I'm afraid. The pip boy user interface and general inventory management design needs a complete overhaul. FO probably has more items than any every other survival game combine yet has one of the most basic, tedious and out of date inventory management systems.
---
I see.  The mods are way more common and more cheap than the plans.  At least you have extremely valuable plans now!
---
I would love to answer your questions about the perks and materials needed, but my memory is terrible.  I know that the Power Smith perk makes it cheaper to repair (and craft?) power armor but I don't recall if it's *necessary*.  Hopefully someone will come along who's more useful than I am.

Although I will tell you this --- there's a location in Watoga that spawns T-60 mods randomly.  You know that building in the West part of it where there's a Vertibird and a power armor chassis?  If you were inside that power armor, you'd be facing a rooftop across the street.  On top of that roof, I've found T-60 calibrated shocks and other mods occasionally.  No cost, ready to install.
---
Thers only about 5 good songs some of them are terrable
---
&gt; Doesn't mean you should get a pass so you dont have to pay caps because you stored all of yours on a mule somewhere. 
---
You're assuming that everyone with no caps put then on a mule. A developer himself said that he spent all of his before playing survival mode.   Different way of getting rid of caps, same outcome if you kill him. 
---
Thank you mr Bear. Have you been successfully collected all the piece plans? Which platform are you in? Maybe we can do 1:1 trade if you are missing something that I have and vice versa 
---
I like to collect trophies so it's I bit annoying üòÇ
---
I have noticed that headshots do more damage according to how far their health bar drops but I have rarely had a head shot drop anything but low level enemies. It's why I use nukes to bombard an area with more than a few enemies to soften the targets up so I can run in like John wick and finish them off. Except I have on power armor and can fly lol
---
botting is an exploit
---
yup, sneaking about will save you a lot of caps imo. Good luck out there!
---
Don‚Äôt have one 
---
found those,but couldn't find source, now I have to go back !
---
Port Skyrim while drunk 0/3
---
It's not easy to lose all caps unless you're failing St surviving.  In which case, have a penalty.  High RISK is supposed to come with this high reward.  You're advocating for no risk high reward system.  You get 20% exp and double caps for all player kills while you risk nothing??   Have a debuff, have ten debuffs, damn cheaters
---
Well it adds some life to the wasteland that is passive , it‚Äôs nice to know Rhee is creatures out there that DONT want to eat me ;)
---
Don't build a stationary base, carry it with you.
---
Or, find a higher level player who's willing to place rocket/laser turrets.
---
You shouldn't have a problem. Take 1 or 2 friends and your best guns freshly repaired 
---
I don't think you should count on the vending machine as a "second storage" as it's probably connected to your stash. But I could be dead wrong on this, but it will probably work like the fragmenter. 
---
You could also had placed them on him yourself 
---
I hate it.  So much that I have played it for over 76 hours.  More than 90% of the xbox one games I buy.  Its so bad I didn't really notice I was having so much fun playing it so much.  
---
I have combat torso and leather limbs +grounded so that probably explains it. I remember k. FO4 it was possible to almost completely negate energy damage, while ballistic had a damage floor. If fo76 is the same, that would explain why the acid node does more damage to me than the Scorchbeasts.
---
I carry mine and place it near shit as needed like a save point. This is on my new survival character.
---
Swap to survival enemies are scaled up 
---
Hence the idea for a negative debuff and debt system.  If you had to pay off a debt somehow why not go back to adventure mode and farm off that debt? 
---
If you picked up the 60 and stashed them before joining the BOS and starting the missions, no, it will not.
---
But, if you are a member of the BOS and have started the ability to get the Forbidden Knowledge quest (requires picking up a holotape in Fort Defiance I think), finishing the quest will consume every Tech Data in your Inventory (not stash though).
---
Further, Quantities are not displayed for Tech Data picked up once you start the quest.  Just a single item with a quest Diamond on it.  But the game does keep track of how many you have collected.
---
Turning in 1 Tech Data gives you Exp, Caps, and reward items.  Turning in 2 or more Tech Data gives you more Exp, More Caps, and Reward items.  There does not appear to be much if any reward item chance increase depending on the number you turn in at once.  
---
But the Cap reward goes from 25 to 40, and the reward exp went (before patch 7) from 350 to 400 exp.  After patch 7 I noticed I was getting 460 and 530 (give or take) exp for single and 2+ turn ins.  But I don't know if that was due to an exp boost in the quest or something else on my character.
---
If you collect 2 or more, but then log out or disconnect before turning them in, it resets to just 1 (25 caps and 350 exp) upon logging in again.
---
You could just have transferred them to the corpse.
---
&gt;Don't even get me started on how it was a terrible idea to allow fully leveled characters into a new game mode to begin with
---
They did this to see how badly fully leveled characters can break the mode with legendary armor so they can fix it.  Those are the exact words of one of the developers. 
---
Translation: nerf is likely coming to Sentinel Assassins.

I always thought some sort of colour coded status and a timer would be easy enough
---
(Grey) Not started : *countdown timer to event expiry*
---
(Green) Started : *Timer to event expiry* : Percentage complete : (percentage)
---
Yellow and red colours on started events could denote how much has been completed vs the expiry of the event. 
---
Ie: 10% complete with 1 min left might turn a started event red as it's very unlikely to be finished
---
For events with multiple stages then under the started event you could have sub categories to detail each stage - with the same information as above (not started/started, timer to expiry and percentage complete of each stage)
---
That way you would know if it's worth the effort to travel if an event is about to end or how close to completion it is
---
Perhaps a small extra detail could be the number of people at the event? 
---
It usually lasts until it's over.
---
If PVE punji boards work pretty good.
---
That would be an interesting way of playing. Nukashine could definitely work well with some Tesla bracers 
---
Or what would make it nicer is if Hacker/Lockpick went from 1 to 3 star card, instead of the 3 separate cards for each. Would make it faster to switch out that way.
---
It isn't a simulator, it is a game. If we can pretend that zombies and giant mutant bats are a thing then I think that we can accept that weapons work as intended for a game.
---
A commission factor would be neat, get some caps if it sells to another player. 
---
Most of the time it gets pretty close. I think some you get 25 and others you could get 120 so it just depends. Maybe if you fast travel and miss it the game should have like a little vault boy say "darn just missed it. Here you go!" And refund you like 3/4 or all of your caps 
---
Maybe adrenaline kicking in? 
---
If you search a little bit more you'll find it.  Shouldn't take much longer if you explored the whole camp already.
---
The problem is, once people reach the cap so fast,  all they want is trades. It can be hard to sell stuff if no one wants caps
---
No still bloodied effect off when finished reloading It's keep going 151 damage 
---
If change to other gun It comeback to normal 
---
But Reload \[bloodied + Reload  damage resistant\] bloodied effect off again
---
You seem like a cool dude 
---
I did an enclave event the other day where I had just gotten to the point where the uplinks were set and the timer to gtfo was running and suddenly a guy fast traveled to the event right in the middle of the orbital strike zone. I told him to run to me but he didn‚Äôt make it in time.
---
One of the bombs landed right on his head. Once it was clear I ran in and gave him a stimpack. It was hilarious and also kind of terrifying.
---
Not sure if you still can, but you can use the railway rifle to nail spikes into walls or rock faces, then climb up them.
---
Thank you for appreciating the work I put in. It‚Äôs still imperfect but should do the trick. If you need any help and on PS4 I can help you out
---
There's two spots:
---
1. Purchasable at Whitesprings Soda Fountain
---
2. Nuka Cola frat bedroom can have one on the Nuka collection shelf
---
/r/untrustworthypoptarts 
---
That's freaking great.  I hope I come across shops like yours on PC!
---
I've seen 2 before.  It was neat.  Within the last 2 weeks,  I've seen 4. Maybe they are spawning more? 
---
This is upsetting. The level 100 and hacking are the only 2 i need left for platinum. 
---
Also i know for a fact the challenges arent adding up correctly (scrapped over 100+ shotguns and no challenge completed for it is one of many examples).
---
There is definitely something very wrong with the way the tracking goes in this game
---
I‚Äôve noticed some weird stuff at white spring with the legendary ghouls. Seems like sometimes the legendary ghoul causes non legendary minions around it to drop them? Not sure if this is true but I feel like I‚Äôve encountered it more than once there. 
---
I‚Äôve got 2 sets, both max level. One has some mods with it (core assembly, optimized servos) other is vanilla. I‚Äôll show them to you next week when I return
---
I dont want to " prestige ". Why would I want to start over when iv built a great character? I can just start a new character.  
---
First day I went to Freddy's house, it actually told me the area was right there.  Turns out there was a Wendigo sitting right outside in the parking lot.
---
I'd also like the defense platforms to actually snap and let me put walls on them it so we could make our own walls - like in several areas we see the metal girder buildings with wooden walls or concrete walls snapped to them I'd love the ability to do that to fence off areas 
---
Oh my god. It's a game, not real life.
---
Stick with corn and carrot soup. They sit in the first screen without having to scroll down.
---
Better criticals perk + Overdrive both increase critical hit damage, which include headshots. If you were a sneaky build with the associated perks and weapons, you'd get even more damage from said headshot.
---
PS: With weak weapons, you still wouldn't one shot people IRL either. A 22 would literally just glance off the skull. 
---
This happened to me yesterday! I wanted to help a friend do it for the first time. Went thru 3 cards cause I thought I entered them wrong. 
---
Do you want battletoads? This is how we get battletoads.
---
Mind if we figure it out next week? I‚Äôm away and can‚Äôt find time to really serve people with remoteplay
---
There is/was a mod that did this. Haven't checked in a while so not sure if it still works.
---
But anyways, at the bottom of every inventory tab it lists the weight there.
---
It was SO handy early on when I didn't realize just how much Bobby Pins and Gunpowder weighed, and I could see how I had 40 lbs of weight on the "MISC" tab when I was first trying to figure out how I was always running low on space.
---
It should definitely be a feature of the base game to display total weight per tab.
---
I have a mirelurk king. He's ugly, evil and does a great job.  
---
Oooh.  My first r7n I had that problem and someone happened into the bunker and finished it for me.  It's worked a couple times since.  If you are on PS4 and want some help you can add me and we can work out a when.  Lordskorb on psn
---
Thank God you aren't a raider because that would have been free junk! Lol 
---
How is that cheating? If it wasn‚Äôt intended, then you would get a debuff same as adventure. Seeing as you don‚Äôt get one...? 
---
You have some type of effect from food, chem, legendary being applied and then removed. There are so many things that can boost or reduce the damage of stuff... and not all of it will show in the effects tab.
---
I know. I was adding to what you said. We need more then just a timer. Events are fun, I have spent the last week doing them all to see what all they offer. I rarely see others doing events though. We really need some kind update to events to get more involved. Something I would love to see them add with events also is a list of players involved in that current event along with the timer and several fixes.
---
On PC
---
I do not have every plan by far and no real duplicates. All I have currently is all calibrated shock plans, the t-45 stealth boy, the t51 and t60 kinetic servos, A random arm and leg for one of the t series, and all ultracite pieces and mods. It's a slow process on an Alt character.
---
I‚Äôm not sure. Luck should be a factor for everything in this game but I really don‚Äôt know how would increased luck factor in for that
---
That's the joke right.
---
Couple of things I keep in mind when playing:
---
1) this is a post nuclear war landscape, and it‚Äôs been 25 years. All the shotgun slugs and buck shot has been collected and used by raiders/responders. All we‚Äôre left with is the bird shot, if you‚Äôre collecting ammo. 
---
2) if you‚Äôre pressing your own ammo, then you‚Äôre using a far inferior gun powder mixture to what was used in the past. What we have now is much more akin to blackpowder, as opposed to the premium stuff available on today‚Äôs market. 
---
3) when it comes to rifle rounds, again it‚Äôs been 25 years. Those cartridges have been exposed to all kinds of weather, which would compromise the quality of the factory powder. If you‚Äôre pressing it, see number 2. 
---
I know this doesn‚Äôt make you feel any better, as it doesn‚Äôt for me either, but it‚Äôs the best justification I can come up with as to why shots do so little damage. 
---
The terrain is non collidable in terms of bullets ime. Even with my tse homemade shooting the area directly underneath a player or creature wont usually result in damage done. With thr exception of Mirelurk hunters(I think their feet clip through a bit) 
---
I'm no stranger to being banned for exploiting, I never intend for it to be melicious. And use it primarily to see and explore content thats not avalible yet. I sat on the camping stations for long enough, I highly suspect they will patch it before a ban. 
---
I can build a nuclear reactor and a suit of power armor and a house if you give me enough pencils, but you know what I can't do?  Grow aster or bloodleaf.  Strangler Blossoms?  Boy, you *must* be crazy.
---
Thank you kind birdy, please let me know if you need any help
---
So jelly! Ive been looking for those shocks forever..lucky you.
---
How does botting work?
---
I don't know what damage type (if it even has a damage type) the acid node is. You assume it is energy, but it obviously isn't affected by armor. 
---
That said, 76 is NOT 4 and you shouldn't assume the mechanics are the same.
---
That's cool. I've been to Whitespring a few times, to get the sword for a quest, to buy plans, etc.
---
I'd like to experience a nuke zone, just for kicks, but I'm not at the point where I feel like I need to get a lot of XP quickly. I almost never feel underleveled for the area I'm in, but that will probably change soon. Just finished checking out every marked location in the Ash Heap, and am close to level 35. When I hit that, I plan to upgrade my handmade, build new excavator armor, do the new quests coming out, and see if I'm ready to start Rose's quests.
---
My guess is I'll be level 38 or so at that point. If I die a lot doing her stuff, maybe I'll grind for XP for a while, but not there yet.

---
Well, you won't have to.  It'll be an option for those who want to.
---
I normally accept assuming they need free fast travel. But also I live north of watoga so it makes sense. 
---
I've made some good trades this way as well. I think people are just use to getting griefed and don't wanna give their camp location.
---
Usually 2-5 hours on average.  Totally depends 
---
It's a beta, for us to find all the cheats and exploits.   The system is leading people to transfer caps to alts, this is now an identified cheat/exploit.    If you find any others, please report.   Next question.
---
Stay camped in the forest. That way the enemies are the least deadly. Until they do the upgrade to turrets, defending your camp yourself is most effective. 
---
Of course, theres tons and tons of enemies in PVE so one shot kill is alright because it becomes more about mob management. 
---
One shot kill in PVP is stupidly broken. No opportunity for tactics or meaningful exchanges, literally just whoever gets the first shot off.
---
I never had to much of a problem. I only have two low end turrets and always return with my walls up. I saw a player yesterday that had circles and circles of pink castle beds. 
---
I have no objection to including such an option, but I don't view it as a huge deal. Of course, I also would not bother taking multiple workshops in survival mode. If I am going to farm materials, I'll do it in the Adventure zone.
---
On my old Sony, I found a little hidden button on the remote that came with the tv (not the one from your cable company). I had the same issue with the game cutting off, and the aspect ratio settings IN the TV menu didn't help at all. The button on my remote said Zoom/image, or something like that.. pressed it a few times while my xbox was on screen, and Fixed! I'm not sure if you have the same button, but check it out!
---
We need more freedom in base building in general, otherwise it would be a pain to use these. 
---
this is what I love about this game. tiny, silly, little thing - can't let it go.
---
I'll go back tonight   cheers.
---
literally unplayable
---
We‚Äôll need to figure it out next week. I‚Äôll surely help you out as soon as I‚Äôm back in town. You can add me in the meanwhile 
---
You on pc? Cause I'd pay for you do a counter like that.
---
I have so much junk that If I threw away everything else in my stash it would still be about 700 lbs. I definitely don‚Äôt need more.
---
Wow, I'll check that out.  Thanks!
---
But.... it's tasty. ....
---
Or better yet we should have the option to save different deck load outs and swap between them easily when not in combat.
---
Every Tuesday until they stop supporting the game. 
---
Shouldn't have to download anything.. the fixes are all on their end
---
&gt;Was it the design head who stated this was the intent of the system?  
---
Yes it was.   It's pretty easy to get to zero caps pretty quickly in survival and they know it.  Which is why penalizing it is kind of a ridiculous concept because few if any people would bother with it. 
---
I think that the reason people dont respond to random team invites is because they are afraid it's just to find the location of your camp and get it destroyed, at least that is why i never respond if i dont know the player :)
---
But you sound like a very nice and fun person, keep up the good work :)
---
I gave it up as not worth the struggle for the item granted.
---
Yeah, the description says melee but I think it also reflects ranged 
---
I guess a good idea would be to make two separate categories: DRU.. i mean AIDS, and FOOD\\DRINKS
---
There was a panel for PAX with actual Bethesda employees. I want to say it was Todd himself but I don't remember who it was, said that it was a token exchange system.
---
Todd Howard encourages this leave your caps and aid mentaility behind thing in the PAX east video.
---
Personally I think it is atrocious 
---
Yup, but I don't want to get burned again by buying them without this info and finding out there's requirements I don't want to grind for.  Thanks.
---
A difficulty slider of any sorts would be nice.  While I love playing and exploring, I personally think the game is a bit too difficult.  Being able to bump it down just one setting would be great.  There are many things throughout the game I just don‚Äôt bother with due to the difficulty of them 
---
If you sort by spoil they appear at the bottom. 
---
That gun is poodoo though 
---
You welcome, PA‚Äôs are deep in the lore and surely has place for different play styles.
---
I was fiercely defending munitions from a duo when the notification popped up. 
---
I had 13 100+lvl kills in the 2 hours I held it before the takedown. 
---
I got one when I was level 10 but it was too high of a level but even since reaching level 50 onward I don't even bother to pick them up because the damage per shot is terrible considering it's fire rate is close to that of my 50 Cal. Sniper which is close to double the damage due to legendary effect, mods, and perks, not to mention the whole cripple effect from the luck card
---
It's a lot better than having bots farm caps and caps losing value
---
Well I started playing on second beta session and I've played a lot. I probably passed level 100 before they slowed down the XP showering a bit. Which was like, well, 2 months ago? Relatively long time ago anyway.
---
Levelling itself is not really useful. I've farmed few times WS but mostly just explored around, looted a ton of stuff. It's good to reach level 50 so you can get and equip max level gear. And little above since enemy levels don't seem to be linear, they seem to have levels in steps.
---
Yes ! I like that idea too 
---
Stagger and cripple perks are godly against the queen, which includes Enforcer. Cryolater is also amazing. 
---
I noticed they don't even attack anymore?
---
They are all like my kids and I really can‚Äôt pick one. Raider is unique and I like the badass look. My favorite one is definitely t51b with tricentennial paint, looks so clean and pure. Ultracite is however is great by default. I like x01 as well but I really dislike the torso of it. X01 helmet looks better on T series with matched paint for sure imo
---
All of that is already possible and very frequent, it just requires coordinating on reddit/discord/etc. 
---
This should just make it less of a hassle. 
---
Ah ok. I thought you already bought them. Just hit up a player vendor here and buy the parts with the mods installed. Easier and cheaper 
---
No it was not.  
---
Thank ya! Glad to know i might not have anything to download lol 
---
This is not ringing a bell at all.  You're sure it's in the in-game soundtrack?
---
The closest thing is *In a Shanty in Old Shanty Town* where there's a line that says *"I gotta get back to my shanty town."  But it doesn't completely match your description.
---
I guess it's just me then it's usually 1-2* but it gets killed by scorch or liberators so gotta run through the hospital. 
---
I stay in the Forest. I'm not near any obvious spawn point, but I still get all types of low level enemies attacking my camp (usually when I fast travel there). I've got only two turrets but I basically just roll my eyes when enemies show up. If I do nothing, usually they're dead in a few minutes anyways, and I think the most damage they've ever accomplished was taking out three of my planted corn. Whatever.
---
Vendor Bot Responder had plans for a round wall clock yesterday.  Had.  haha
---
It's glitched as of right now, no one has unlocked it as far as I know 
---
Do you know the effects of it ? :)
---
Raider role playing man. The idea of being a raider is that you make 100 percent profit in all cases, all the time.  You kill people and take their caps but a good raider make sure he loses zero of his own caps, knowhatimean? 
---
As long as it takes.
---
Get some fresh air. Take a shower. Play with your dog.
---
What is that gun exactly and how do you know?
---
Genuinely curious
---
Like the effects and how do u know what it is? 
---
What platform 
---
I might complete it for the mediocre lever action, but the rest of these guns aren't worth the stash space.
---
Maybe if they had unique skins, or something to make them more desirable?
---
It has a ridiculous chance to cripple, and you can get your spikes back when you kill something. If the Tesla Rifle is going to be a Heavy Weapon though...
---
I‚Äôve been treasure hunting, event completing, market searching for a long long time but I still miss 2 pieces each for T60 and Raider. Mod plans are readily available but piece plans are so freaking rare 
---
I want some stair railing. Also 1 tile stairs or attic stairs would be great. 
---
Next question? It‚Äôs obviously not an exploit by any means. They intended you‚Äôd bottom out when playing survival, that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs no debuff. Moving caps was even considered a smart move by Bethesda.
---
Should unlock on a new toon kinda doesn‚Äôt help now but 
---
"Bloodied" works with a low-HP glass-cannon kind of build.
---
There's a fuck-ton of stuff that stacks so that when you're at &lt;20% health you can deal insane levels of damage.
---
Bloodied weapons, especially with further supporting perks and adrenal reaction and whatnot, can do more damage than basically anything else.
---
Where is this?
---
I dont team for 2 main reasons.
---
1. All the higher levels kill everything before I can even get a hit in, now I'm pissed because I miss out on xp and loot, especially if it's a legendary.
---
2. I like the immersion of fallout 76 and if you're constantly talking while I'm reading/listening to the lore of West Virginia then I rather be alone so I can enjoy the game.
---
Or friends with a stimpak or buff drug? A combat medic would stay back, crit with a Medic weapon, and syrynge folks to keep buffs and health up.
---
Especially if you could distill buff foods in to shots. Fast AP regen scorchbeast 300 health shots would rock.
---
Yeah in one of the old inside the vaults they listed that it causes burn damage to you and your opponents. Sounds fun. It's the only drink I wanted, and the only one we can't get üòû
---
Sorry still waiting for the role playing server.  Until then, let's focus on survival server topic.
---
Should unlock on a new toon
---
Sad
---
Vibranium
---
Ah ok that's useful to know, though I'm on Xbox so can't mod anyway. 
---
Yes I was the same, that pesky 'MISC' full of ore...
---
The funny thing is I already did all of those knowing I‚Äôd be on for hours but perhaps it is destiny that I scroll on reddit instead lol 
---
Yeah u just transferred them 
---
your the one gloating about you and your wife going around murdering everyone else you sir are rude
---
I think some people is going to be disappointed, because the vending machine is **probably** using your stash to sell from. Same as the display stands. Want to display 3 power armors, 4 weapons, all the bubble heads and magazines? that's over 100+ stash weight.   
---
I hope that people are ready for this, but the complaints will probably come shortly after the patch goes live.
---
I hope that i'm wrong, because 20 weight in bobbleheads is a waste of space. 
---
There was a list of all the upcoming guns in a recent inside the vault 
---
What you mean?
---
Fasnacht day did a really good job of getting the community together. There are enough holidays like 4th of July and Christmas that they could have limited time events year round. I think this game will be very good in 2 years or so, maybe one of the best fallout 
---
Time to sell some masks
---
No, that isn‚Äôt in this patch.  Today is just a hotfix 
---
Do you guys really suck at this so bad that you can't avoid other players and die to them whenever you see them?  I've never come close to bottoming out lol.  Y'all are nuts
---
Damn 
---
Good Idea. 
---
We should be able to split up our cards. If you're rank 3 you should be able to choose only 1 rank or 2 ranks or 3 ranks. 
---
agreed. But they ain't bad either. I keep stimpacks for auto-stim and emergency revival to use, and heal with high regen foods like scorchbeast. The rate of regen is quite good, and you can hotkey them for speed like the stimpack already is. And they stack, so a bad combat that it is failing to keep up with damage intake gets hella-boosted by an auto stimpack if I get too low.
---
That's a 44. Pistol with three VATS related legendary effects 
---
I have literally never experienced this.
---
Aww man they patched crit commando? I'm just finishing my new build.
---
Someone should tell him....
---
There's an encounter with a Miss Nanny called Rachel where if you have a recon scope she will pay you to mark 10 of a specific animal with a recon scope around her. The animal type will spawn like crazy after she asks you. You have to have the recon weapon equipped when you interact with her.
---
Source?
---
this almost needs to be stickied. It gets requested about 30 times an hour.
---
Irrelevant, next question.
---
They do but only horizontally abd a t right angles
---
I think the 50 cal sounds fun. All the weapons are Meh though. 
---
they clearly don't want it, since they perma-broke it.
---
??? I'm talking about Adventure zone.  I'm talking about the game mechanic having a bug that allows griefers (and in this case they are definitely griefing) to farm players that claimed a workshop and now can't get away from being repeatedly killed without server hopping.  I'm specifically talking about the inability to let go of a workshop if the contester stops the claim before it finishes and then restarts it - just to farm caps from the person.  The absolute simplest and most logical way to do it is: upon death, the workshop is no longer owned by the player - therefore PVP is stopped between the contester and his team and the player and his team.  
---
If the player wants to keep the workshop, he needs to travel to it and defend it before the timer runs out (regaining it) via a "reclaim workshop" similar to the "claim workshop".  This would re-engage PVP. 
---
If the player doesn't want it, he walks away.
---
If the contester stopped the takeover before the death of the player, PVP is cancelled and the player owns the workshop, if they stopped it after the death, then the workshop is unowned.
---
This makes PVP a real possibility to the player and stops the griefing.
---
There is. Moving your camp for map control is between the most beneficial actions to perform in survival. The staple of map control. You can't do that with 0 caps.
---
"at angles and up inclines"
---
Do you have a wedding ring for your finger slot?
---
Way ive seen this fixed most of the time is by killing the player once they pass through the mesh.... with the amount of times ive accidentally fallen through the floor, this would suck. 
---
You don't have to defend it if you build away from enemies
---
Thanks for the clarify, my good sir!
---
I am always nervous as hell messing with starched genes.  There are certain mutations you want nothing to do with and would hate to delete by mistake (radaway) 
---
A week or two.
---
It'll either come on April 9th or 16th. Even then though, they never said it will be exactly like fallout 4. Most likely usable display cases, weapon racks, manquins, etc (it has been mentioned as display caeses). Also, I believe it's been mentioned that we will be getting some display stands for bears and bobbleheads.
---
&gt;and virtually worthless when it comes to drops/rewards vs. resources and time wasted
---
That's right the problem in my opinion, the fight against them is just a waste of time and resources, a better loot could easily make it more interesting 
---
Yup, been there before hahahah
---
Ranching, yes!
---
They already have brahmin and chickens
---
Well, you're getting your hopes up then.
---
Yes, me too.
---
- Legendary ghouls with zero legendaries (common).
---
- Non-legendaries ghouls with legendary √≠tems (common).
---
- Ghouls with two legendaries (rare).
---
And sometimes the game in enter in some kind of jackpot frenes√≠, where almost every ghoul (leg or not) gives a legendary. 
---
Thre is a reason for so many people (me too) going there to farm xp and legendaries...
---
As far as I know, today is just a hot fix. More new content coming on the 9th.
---
It's an ammo hog but it puts stuff down pretty fast. It was useless before the buffed heavy guns. Back then base damage was 16, so it was like shooting a bb gun, no armor penetration. Now base damage is 42 and it's much better. I'm working on unlocking adrenaline because it think it'll do really well with it plus all the heavy gun damage cards. 
---
There is a penalty:  I can't fast travel to a station or move my camp.  If you caught me at my camp, then we're going to get into a cycle where I end up losing most of my aid to you.
---
I try not to carry caps at all.  I do have some outfitsi keep in the Stash that I can sell for quick money if necessary but all my caps immediately get spent when possible. 
---
Always, always shoot her at least once so you can get her loot... and as for high level players watching the nuke drop, I‚Äôm level 145ish and have launched a many of nukes myself but yet I still catch myself fast traveling to a lookout nearby just to see it explode, may even snap a screenshot sometimes. I think most would be lying if they said they still wasn‚Äôt amazed by it..... As for players being down there making her harder, I think it does a lil bit. Use to the whole lobby could be on her and she was basically a bullet sponge but I think they‚Äôve nerfed her now. I‚Äôve fought her numerous times now with almost max lobby on her and we‚Äôve killed her within the first 10 minutes of battle. Ya ever wanna experience it on PS4 then hit me up psn is RECTUM42629. And I‚Äôll try to help ya out as much as I can as well.
---
As someone who is saving up lightweight 3* weapons to scrap for legendary tokens, this seems like a free win. I crit fairly often without thinking about it so I can‚Äôt imagine this will be hard 
---
Today is just maintenance. Wouldn't surprise me if some new things get datamined as well. Waiting for detail on what the update includes. Next week is the next official Wild Appalachia update. And a great one too! Player Vending and Shear Terror!
---
Try playing FO4 after this one. I was literally lost in building workshops. Much more near in this one in general
---
Do legendary railway rifles even exist?  I dont think they do....
---
....But it does make a 'choo-choo' noise when you reload it. Which might be my favorite thing in the game...
---
I just need a double shot, armor piercing, quick reload one and I will be the happiest pain train conductor in all of Appalachia lol
---
bring back laser musket all hail the Preston garvey 
---
Oh. Ok. Sorry, I haven't been following the development cycle that closely recently
---
I actually have a pistol using team-based medic alt and it's pretty much my dream weapon.
---
XB1!
---
that's why I have a switch between my power source and my spotlights to reset them in case this happens
---
Buffalo Frog Legs 
---
Player vending and Shear Terror quest line in coming out April 9th.
---
Today's patch is for an issue involving invulnerability not working correctly at some train stations after fast travel.
---
&gt;High RISK is supposed to come with this high reward.
---
And one of  the risks is expending ammo to kill someone and getting nothing. 
---
So yes.  Got it.   So now to the next question.   Say nobody carries caps or aid or junk on them.  What is the point of this game mode?   (And what is the point in dropping double caps and aid?) 
---
If this was a tabletop RPG with similar rules would your dungeon master allow you to transfer all your belongings to another character to avoid losing them?  What would be the point in the rules in the first place?  
---
I suppose it's a to each's own thing. I shouldn't hate. I'm sure plenty of people are effective with pistols. 
---
Maybe you just need to think for yourself and not let some PewDiePie wannabe decide what you like and what you don't.
---
Along those lines, I want to build my CAMP out of nothing but Brotherhood of Steel assets.
---
Yeah, I don't think that applies to open world online games.
---
Getting the second xbox and tv for my fiance was one of the best decisions i made, roaming appalachia with your favorite human being makes it 100 times more fun.
---
&gt;The system is leading people to transfer caps to alts, this is now an identified cheat/exploit.
---
It's not different from spending all caps before going into the mode.  Same outcome.
---
Hard to say. Some places have a higher chance, but nobody knows for sure. Watoga hospital has a habit of spawn a legendary, and The General Steakhouse has had one every time I‚Äôve visited 
---
If they did this they would have to fix the vortex meshes all over the exterior edge of the map as well.
---
I play on Xbox GT:Bary102
---
Definitely. Cannot wait to see what they come up with and do. The event was pretty good but it was the other players that made it great.  
---
*CONGRATULATIONS!* - Mr. Prize Bot
---
Here's the [roadmap](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019) for your perusal
---
Me and my friend will definitely compete.
---
Not available yet. There is no COBJ record for the fermentable version.
---
Could be related to - educated guess- problems with the related 'challenge'.
---
The complete FormID for the challenge is 'DEL\_Challenge\_WeirdBug8 "Consume Firecracker Whiskey" \[CHAL:0040A23F\]', not something that fills me with confidence :D
---
It doesn‚Äôt do that, but I was trying to say it SHOULD do that. To make them worth something.
---
Personally, I run queens daily, sometimes as much as 10x a day. I don't have any issue with low levels hanging around, so long as they don't draw aggro to the queen and be somewhere she can't land. 
---
The queen's health pool does not increase per player, though there might be hidden damage mitigation that goes up. She doesn't really get much harder with more players for any group that's already capable of beating her. 
---
Frankly, when done properly, the event is worth doing even without the SBQ killed. The event can potentially spawn hundreds of mobs, each with potential stable flux material. 
---
Even if you're low level, you can toss grenades/mines. Those actually contribute quite a bit. The most annoying enemies are actually the smallest ones with low health, but are hard to hit with heavy guns (stingwings, mirelurk spawns, crickets, ticks). 
---
SBQ is hardly impossible, but best takend own with multiple heavy gun players + ones with stagger/cripple effects. Ideally cryolater tossed in there too, and players aggroing on flat ground-- not hiding on buildings. She will not land if she's aggro'ed on a player in an invalid landing spot, such as on top of buildings / fences. Those players trying to save their own hides annoy me more than low level players. 
---
A low level player on a valid landing spot is significantly better than a player preventing her from landing by aggro'ing her while on top of a building/fence or other invalid landing spot.
---
High level players just have enough DPS to kill her fast once she lands and get stagger locked. Extra low level players don't take away from this at all-- but players in invalid landing spots do.
---
My mistake, that is some weird shit I‚Äôve yet to see myself. I‚Äôm at a loss here. 
---
This.  I dont even itneract with locks or terminals anymore.....  AT ALL because the tedium of switching perks all the time is already bad enough as is....  every time I want to craft something, or sell something.  Or switch weapon types.  it just goes onnnnnn 
---
If they added a couple especially in the eastern part of the map, I would totally be cool with that restriction. 
---
You win the Irony on the Internet award 
---
Legendaries for tokens???
---
I died few times in survival mode and lost few thousands caps out of that. Not being stupid, and seeing lots of people switch to decked out level 60 builds, I'm now making one myself, to ensure I don't loose caps for 10 kills caps in one death. The harsh reality of such terrible design decision as to implement the most powerful debuff effect on players that have been grinded is the worst possible outcome: a game mode only enjoyable for spawnkilling griefers.
---
The PvP debuff mechanic was put in place for adventure mode to ensure that griefers who wear zero caps don't go unpunished. It has no place in PvP mode at all.
---
You can't move your camp without caps and you are at a disadvantage when compared to anybody else who do. This is enough punishment. I'm not writing this because I lost my caps, I'm writing this despite the fact the consequences are that I'm often receiving nothing upon kill. PvP debuff for loosing currency is ridiculous.
---
checked all that.first I thought, - must have mis-read the stats.
---
but the 10mm was at the weekend,still fresh in memory.Drop from 55 to 34
---
thats about 40%.No change to perks and that 10mm is 1 star legendary.
---
remember thinking at the time "for an auto,thats not to shabby.i'll have that". No big deal,just wondered if it was only me.
---
Anyone want an armour piercing auto 10mm ?
---
They do. I only know this because I‚Äôve gotten two of them at 3*
---
Wow so risky.   So that's worth a 20% exp buff and double caps when you kill a player (that isn't using this money transfer exploit)? And your risked, what? Bullets?  Wow nice.   Well good thing my level 200+ character uses a power fist.  What does he lose?  Durability?   
---
 Risked items:. Durability on power fist
---
Reward: double someone else's caps, and 20% exp buff 
---
Nice
---
"free travel. LOL"
---
What I do is spawn in at the station - run down to the end of the red bridge - go a little further for good luck and then head back. This almost always spawns enemies or the bot
---
2 things to note :
---
Pisses me off when there are camps placed on spawn spot. No idea why people want a spot right there as it seems to always stop the bot from spawning 
---
And the bot likes to explode randomly so don‚Äôt exit his menu until you‚Äôre for sure done lol 
---
Oh fuck yes !!!!
---
Best ideal ever. 
---
Yep
---
I would really like to have the "bottle" and "cap" action figures, the ones we see on the table with tv in the f76 trailer when the game was released (we can find a bigger version of them inside the nukecola bunker where we get the paint job for the T-51)
---
Also an outfit with a bottle shape would be extremely cool
---
Thank you
---
I know how you're feeling. I am sure i can't make it to the big Fall update that's supposed to make the game better. Probably i will focus on something else by then.
---
If that‚Äôs the case why do people often report that when there‚Äôs only a couple of players it‚Äôs not too hard to take her down, but when there‚Äôs a large group of people but only a few know what they‚Äôre doing, it becomes nearly impossible? 
---
Maybe your choices in perks are so off, you're actually reducing the damage? 
---
;)
---
wait whhhaattt I need to investigate this...
---
\\
---
Scorchbeasts are pretty annyoing. During the main quest i was in crannberry bog and it was just annyoing. I killed one but then i just ignored them. It's such a waste of ammo for that little xp. &gt;!Sure during the enclave questline, you need to kill some but you can take the turret and lure them to it, so its way easier!&lt;   
---
In earlier areas there are not that common and when you not build your camp near a fissure site, it's no big deal. They are not strong but have many health and that they fly is pretty annoying. When the reward would just be good enough, i would go for them. Sure with the mentioned area in my spoiler, it would be very easy and they need to balance this out, that you cant take out all with that methode.   
---
Full assassin's: 40%; full sentinel's: 75%. Reduction from assassin's leaves 60% of the incoming damage, and sentinel's removes 75% of that, leaving 15%. (Order doesn't matter; we're just doing (1-.40)*(1-.75), and multiplication is commutative.)
---
The full damage formula is actually more complicated than this, and it has the overall effect of making damage reduction from legendaries/perks less valuable.
---
Why are you so worried? If you enjoy it and it doesn't detract from your responsibilities, what does it matter? Live your life fam.
---
The game isn't bad, it's actually quite fun in a way a lot of other online MP survival games isn't.
---
It also despite having a road map released with aba bit over 40 hrs of content to explore and that isn't in any way shape or form incomplete.
---
Despite what Jim Sterling says, in this case a road map just serves to inform players that bought a game that was supposed to be updated regularly that it will in fact get updated regularly. We were told there was Free DLC coming and we just wanted to know when it was coming.
---
But it is an infectious game and grows on you well.
---
My first toon didn‚Äôt unlock many things just like what you are experiencing but as I leveled a second toon those atom challenges started to unlock I even had new photo modes unlock even though I had definitely been there on my first toon
---
Turrets just seem useless in my experience. Whatever attacks will try &amp; zone right on them, or you'll get eagle eye scorched shooting them out of the turrets range.
---
Not only that but they now tell you who owns them, maybe not the biggest deal, but I'd prefer anonymity (I hide my camp workstation behind locked doors as well).
---
In the Savage Divide it seems to just throw token enemies at my camp, they're always level 10. It just go outside &amp; deal with them. The game doesn't seem to force attacks on camp if your not actually present. 
---
&gt;I recently watched a Jon Sterling video about roadmaps and how they basically mean you bought an incomplete game.
---
I don't know or care who Jon Sterling is, but that's a silly thing to say.  Adding more stuff means it's incomplete?  C'mon.  The definition of "complete" is a moving target where video games are concerned.  Do you keep yourself from watching a TV series until it's been cancelled? 
---
If you think the game is bad now, what could it possibly have a year from now to change your mind?  It took them years to make Fallout 76.  They can't dump enough new stuff or changes into it in a year to make it a different game.  Did yous see the PAX East video?  Todd Howard made a comment about how the team spends months developing new content and everyone's finished playing it two days later.
---
If you're not enjoy it, just walk away.  Come back in a year, play it for a week, and walk away again.  It's not going to change that much.
---
Yup, both should be punished.   I would say you should go negative caps when you die but then people would farm friends alts for caps.  So you'll just have to keep 400 caps on your level 200 character.  Should take all of 15 minutes at most to acquire.
---
Because the game is good? I mean you say the game is bad but give no reasons why you think so, you just talk about someone talking about road maps.
---
As for the youtube video I rolled my eye when he talked about just wandering about and finding things being a bad thing like that hasnt been part of fallout since the first one back in the 90's. I usually like jim sterling's vids but lately he seems to be letting his dislike of a game be why a game is bad more than he should.
---
I said it before and I will say it again, no NPC's does not automatically make a bad game, and fallout 76 is about your (and your fellow vault dwellers) survival not about why wv is dead. that is the b story.
---
&gt; Perks like lockpicking, hacking and others should have no cost.
---
The game should be easier!  Choices should not have consequences! Waaah!
---
It completely negates adrenal reaction, and this shit is getting old.
---
Ah.. thank you 
---
From memory I've got several hundred on my vendor character if you want them. 3 caps each. How many you need?
---
Those things are creepy as all get out! They immediately get a plasma grenade, just to make sure I get the nest too.
---
Weight has been an issue since day 1 of the Beta I feel like.
---
You are probably right that there will be a weight limit for the stands and display cases; however, I‚Äôm hoping that each vendor machine or stand has its own individual weight assigned....  
---
We will see
---
Well I am in the market for a T-51 jetpack mod. Would you be selling any of those? I just spent 5k on the calibrated shocks plans and was planning on working my way back up to the jetpack plans
---
That would make sense, because unless you have the metabolism of the Flash, there's no way a bottle of beer and a bottle of rum have the same duration on the body.  And if you *can* manage to drink an *entire bottle* of hard liquor in one sitting, well, you probably need a doctor.
---
Acid node is poison damage, I actually tested this since one is smack dab in the middle of my build. And I sure hope they changed the mechanic, knowing the crazy min-maxing shenanigans player characters get up to they should have reworked quite a bit from FO4.
---
Point of the mode was to be a harder adventure with the added benefit of better exp and rewords for completing challenges, with the addition of PvP being free engagement. If you‚Äôre implying the mode was strictly made for hunting down and farming people for caps, you‚Äôre wrong. You can be smart and transfer aid and caps so thus not to lose anything, and comparing this to a tabletop is silly, they are nothing alike, making that statement irrelevant.
---
Oh thanks for responding! Yeah sucks for my build but I'm sure it's great for vats pistol builds 
---
I might grab it to save or give it to someone else that really wants it 
---
I'm sure, I heard it a lot while my husband was playing. It's got a faster beat similar to *Jumping at the Woodside*
---
Also those ghouls don‚Äôt have much armor in comparison, so more and more damage (instigating, bloodied) are good for farming.
---
Meh. The secondary camp shouldn't allow extractors and generators and stuff... If people want their main C.A.M.P. on a node, it probably already is. 
---
I don't see the ability to go camping changing the way people farm resources...
---
Not sure what interests you. I can offer a bloodied dcg with ss and reduced weight, need to check my stash after the update to see what other melee weapons I have since I dont really use a melee build. 
---
I also have a bloodied ss 15% less damage when blocking meat hook, suppressors ss plus 1 strength meat hook, and an anti armor 40% more power damage meat hook.
---
If you are interested in caps, can pay say around 12k in addition to my unyielding sentinel marine left arm. Open to negotiations, let me know :)
---
I have only seen 1 or 2 in over 200 levels of playing across multiple characters.  
---
And the idea of a wandering storm that spawns glowing ones hordes rocks. Mightily. People would stop nuking whitesprings and start following the storms instead. Make the storm nuke-zone sized and visible on the map. Green circle, maybe? Limit fast travel and all the nuke things. Probably limit its power or ability to go in to the forest, to be fair to fresh meat.
---
Okay it COULD be enough punishment if they were all playing by the same rules, but they are not, they are taking your caps (honest player) while risking none.  I'm sorry but if you die so much that's kinda your fault.  I run around the cranberry bog for hours sometimes without running into anyone.  I win at least 50% of my fights and yeah I drop 400 caps when I die.  I also made an alt to try out this vats crit meta.  However you're all advocating for a game mode that we drop double caps, but at the same time, we transfer all our caps to an alt without penalty.  What. Is. The. Point.
---
Build a stair. Build a hovering base. Put those spiky boards all the way up the stairs.
---
Would be nice.  I have a god roll 3* instigating one. 
---
It's used in a lot of armor mods, and to make gunpowder. Otherwise pretty useless.
---
Absolutely triggering right now. Between that and the Insult bot that I could not get away from. 
---
This is all good information to know, thank you! Do you know, was she ever buffed based on number of players in the event?
---
Some border on unfair advantage, like lockpick bar. I never need to keep more than 1 bobby pin, as I will never break it.
---
The bird feeder can attract squirrels, which you can then kill for meat.  Also can we just get more instruments in general?  I feel like there should be more horn instruments.
---
looking for ANY plan / mod........even just 1......ANY
---
supposed to be off scorchbeast only,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,oh goody, - another wooden level  5 leg !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Nice idea, I'll do that. Thanks!
---
Even an option to hide them would work.
---
Definitely, I miss the old Mad Max compound feel.  The building budget limitations make that sort of thing tough though, would be nice to see a slight increase there as well.
---
The first line completely invalidates the possibility of the lvl 48 character being good lol.
---
What about Messenger events? You get like 30 min to do it, but can knock it out way faster. So you'd see a lot of time left, but for all you know by the time you fast travel there whoever running it may be finishing it.
---
I agree I'd love a way of knowing if it's worth going to but some there are lot of variables. 
---
As far as it goes nothing new gets added today 
---
&gt; bgs needs to add the mod to the codebase. (Like they did with known plans)
---
Can you elaborate? This may be the source of an annoyance I have been trying to eliminate for ages. I have removed all traces of KnownPlans, but get a popup on every start telling me KnownPlans is incompatible with this version.
---
They can call it a hotfix all they want....a hotfix is fast and small. Wonder how much disk space this deuce will consume?
---
Yup, only 2 actually lose cxc weight, some of them actually gain weight, which makes sense because you are adding plastic to a certain quantity of item.
---
That‚Äôs very nice teamwork üëçüèª
---
Sure, that will take 20Gb disk space to implement.
---
Someone clearly doesn't know what it means for a game to be a liver service game. 
---
Dear God. Are you on PS4? Is this for sale?
---
other exsisting weapons dont change (unless nerfed)
---
This would be amazing. I started a new character because of how easy the game is and to play survival. When you can kill almost every enemy with one shot it's game over for me. 
---
Killing a Behemoth in one shot is not fun. Some enemies like the Deathclaw, Wendigo or the Grafton Monster are a joke and they should buff them or make them attack in groups.
---
I struggle against Mirelurk kings though, when I see a group of six I hide because I use unyielding at very low health and they usually kill me.
---
But with my new character at level 26 I'm having a blast again.
---
I like the whole idea of an online RPG that evolves and has a story that unravels over time. I don't think you can have that sort of thing if all the content is in the game at release. Whatever content a game ships with is data mined or discovered by hardcore players within a week. The road map being release to the public is needed to keep people on the hook till the whole story is released over time otherwise naysayers will run off too many people with "you're a fool this game will be free to play by the end of the month for sure". The only thing they could have been more up front about is that the game would deliver it's full content in episodes over the course of a year. If they'd have said that right up front there would have been a lot less negative press about the content and "end game".
---
I'd like em back and I'd like for defensive walls to be more forgiving when trying to place them. I have just a hell of a time, it doesn't work very well even in relatively flat areas. Could just be that I'm an idiot. 
---
Yeah basically the only free, non-copyrighted music is from before 1924. Anything after requires licensing which is an expensive venture, especially when there are other things Bethesda can do with that money.
---
It would be great to have a larger playlist though. I‚Äôve always had a thing for big band and swing music but the Fallout franchise *really* expanded my love for it
---
Sorry that you couldn't tell that this was a tongue in cheek suggestion. In-game effects should last as long as appropriate for game balance and fun.  I think the liquor effects are a bit too short and therefore feel like a chore, but they should be extended modestly to make the game more fun, not to simulate reality. 
---
It's really frustrating when you fast travel to an event and it expires seconds later, and you were the only one there.  Couldn't they extend the timer a bit after the first person arrives?
---
They are usually around 2 hours.  I‚Äôd consider that fast.  It‚Äôs the same experience on Destiny.  You hatin, bro?
---
Something that i've noticed is that it's not the damage that gets you.  It's the stagger that those damn crabs inflict with basically every hit, interrupting your attacks and forcing you to wait until it wallops you again.
---
I'd like the building mechanics from Fallout 4 back tbh. Until the barrier problem is fixed the junk fences would just be hard to set down too
---
I actually have no idea so you‚Äôre probably right! I need to have a look into it because when I‚Äôm not in Power Armor ghouls are hitting me for so many rads
---
So your silence on specific questions is very telling.  Also the straw man argument saying I'm implying something I'm clearly not is cute.  But moving on, so you realize you're wrong or you would just have provided a straight answer.  The game is not harder if you're risking nothing.  I say if they leave it this way, with no risk on death, then they remove the exp buff and just make players not drop caps at all. Not fair for half the population to drop caps while the other camps whitesprings 24/7 and loses no caps.  Damn cheaters
---
In Jim Sterling's defence, he isnt a Pewdiepie wannabe. His character has always been more of a "heel" type which has held pretty consistently to the point is in playing a heel in a wrestling organization in the area he lives and goes by sterdust, which started as a gag on his show.
---
Unobtanium
---
I can craft one for you next week. If you can supply the mats it‚Äôs dirt cheap (500 caps). Let‚Äôs talk back next week when I get back and we can figure something out. 
---
No, it's to avoid price inflation.
---
Think about the problems of balancing an economy where players can generate a more or less limitless amount of loot.
---
rifleman work for crossbow
---
Why? The models are right there in game. 
---
How long do you think it will take
---
I know it doesn't solve most of peoples problems, but there is a labelling mod on pc that will categorize aid from food and drink and chems
---
Yes. Both dodgy and serendipity seem to work.
---
I‚Äôve seen only once someone used cryo in a queen battle, it was pretty amazing, she looked like a frost covered turkey and almost stopped moving completely for quite a while. Maybe the player‚Äôs out of cryo ammo, she eventually came out of the frozen state and didn‚Äôt become frozen again. 
---
Had this happen to me. Fast travelled to the swarm of suitors and the third round of mirelurks were mostly a no show. Waited all that time just for it to tell me I failed the event. When it felt more like the event failed me. 
---
Well, given that one of the vendors gouging you *is* the Enclave...
---
I am pretty sure the bridge I want to build on is already there.
---
But players can‚Äôt see your camp , they really benefit after knowing you have prime real state lol 
---
I am 25y.o. and immature. No way i could join u big boiz!

I think perks that unlocks stuff in certain moments, like lockpicking or just being able to craft stuff, would be enough. There are cards that mixed, like that you can craft guns up to tier 5 and that they break slower. I mean they should change this in such a way, that you don't need to change it every time. They can unlock these features at a certain SPECIAL rank or you need to get the card and it doesn't block a SPECIAL slot. I think the 2nd way would be the best, because it's nothing that would break the game, except when players don't have 3  intelligence and now can unlock every terminal. 
---
I just can‚Äôt be bothered to constantly switch cards to get the max build possible in every situation just like to set and forget, no silly, just not hardcore 
---
The zero caps thing is annoying, there needs to be a debuff. The best part of the current system is it has a chance of removing caps from the game. That's what this games economy needs badly. If some one with max caps kills another player those earned caps leave the game, making your caps more valuable. Really if they were smart there would be a huge buff for playing survival with maxed caps.
---
You need to build it, I believe it‚Äôs in the armor crafting bench
---
He's trolling. 
---
One of the main reasons I put the game on hold. I loved to build in 4 and when I started going through all the stuff in 76, first thing that popped into my head was ‚Äúthat‚Äôs it‚Äù.   
---
One of the big disappointments in the game for me. 
---
Those are not the concrete walls that are being discussed. You are talking about the concrete barriers that were introduced in 76
---
The "If Daryl dies, we riot" perk.  Boosts damage and attack rate for all team members when the crossbow character dies.
---
You are me. One of the things that drives me nuts about this game is all the various items and behaviors for which there is absolutely no documentation, besides people saying "oh yeah, that's a thing, didn't you know?"
---
The focus is non-toxicity/verbal abuse.
---
Not a very well thought out troll. A little effort. Come on.
---
The amount of times I‚Äôve switched to my pistol instead of vaulting cover...
---
I thought each of the individual modifiers was multiplicative. So assassins would be a .92 multiplier. So a full set would just be (.92^5)= ~.66 or a ~34% reduction instead of the additive (1-.40) or 40% reduction. So applying that logic to the whole thing it would be (.92^5)*(.85^5) = ~.29 or a ~71% damage reduction. Signifficant, but a long ways away from 15. 
---
But you're saying the legendary effects are internally additive (1-.08-.08...etc...) and multiplicative across modifier type and DR/ER ratio? Or something similar to that? I haven't been able to find an actual breakdown of the calculations online for 76, just speculation based on FO4s system.
---
So I must be special, because I currently have a marine helmet in my inventory...
---
Would be great if we could trade for a card of our choice, even if it was like discard 10 for 1 it‚Äôd be great 
---
This makes me sad.  Show the railway rifle some love Bethesda.  
---
My heavy weapons character has a Furious .50cal.  Killing a landed SB at point blank range is ~2 sec burst. A flying one at long range is about 10-15 secs.
---
With that character, killing SBs is fun, and the loot feels appropriate. My camp is near fissure prime and I make a loop of all the bog fissures everytime I return to camp so I can make more SB Mixed Meat Stew.
---
With my other characters, SBs are a real pain in the ass.
---
Jon Sterling doesn't understand how MMO's work, does he? 
---
You could always get good and get your own items ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Um....headshots do do more damage than non headshots for most mobs (weak spot). We are not sure of the exact multiplier but my guess is that it is a 2x increase in damage for the headshot iver a body shot. 
---
New feature coming where you can dump bad legendaries into a tool/bot and get tokens that can buy other things. I think it's like the Borderlands unicorn vendor.
---
Or maybe just go back to the old system where you have to create a whole new character just to have a different skill loadout? 
---
The quest needs to be fixed, and it needs the emergency broadcast alert sound added to it like most events already have.
---
The thing is, it's Interesting but I'm holding out my unduped weapons for other unduped ones. Don't get me wrong, that DCG is very powerful but I already own one. I'm hoping to get the tesla more than anything because I can be for sure that isn't a dupe. For unyielding/sentinel, I know both the marine and metal has been in circulation so I don't want another one of each. Hopefully this clarifies what in looking for
---
‚ÄúMature‚Äù and yet Facebook.
---
Unique weapons should get their own newly released perk card.
---
What? You just ignored my answers and went on to making more invalid points. What are you doing?
---
Defense against players or against scorched and such?
---
We had Showbiz where I lived.  Still haunts my dreams.  
---
That sounds awesome!
---
Even if true it is only 20gb, I would gladly give up that disc space for an improved perk system
---
I've given up even trying the horde events because of this...
---
It's fine the way it is, it makes you sacrifice damage for utility and vice versa. You have to decide if you want to be a powerhouse or a lockpick for where you're at. I have perks I use for exploring, reg PxE, and the SBQ. It's versatile the way it is.
---
I am european so i came home to play for few hours and then i go sleep. Every day after monday there is maintenance, when i can't play my whole free time on that day. Just listening to main menu theme.
---
Nope, never encountered it, 9/10 times I'm getting duplicates of recipes I've got.
---
I've got at least 4 blood tic margaritas and frat signs 
---
Anyone know how large the patch is for PS4?
---
I am and it's not. It's my new Whitesprings farming tool. The ghouls literally just run into it and explode on contact lol. 
---
I found a server like that last week. 'twas lovely...
---
Too lovely, got disconnected 20 minutes into the playing session - just as I was filing my fangs ready to start Monster Mash - and rolled back 5 minutes-ish for good measure.
---
Kicking myself for dilly dallying in WS and not realising sooner.
---
Love the carpet &amp; rose chairs, very suave.
---
Shhh!  He's trying to blend in.
---
LOL.  If this is the case, we'd better get some "Lucille is thirsty" perk cards. 
---
You seem to have an obsession with things that take up large amounts of disc space. 
---
I win 95%+ of my fights. I actively seek fights with organised opponents, and if we're not talking about a group of well cordinated people then we're talking about freefrags. I get called a cheater daily because of how nicely my character works. Caps are an aspect of the game I mostly ignore and have made over 20k so far on survival (ignoring noobs and focusing on the deadly groups), so if you for a single second continue assuming I can't handle my ass in survival then I'm gonna ask you for your IGN and settle the dispute in-game.  
---
The double caps on the survival server is an aspect of it I like the least. I don't care if I get nothing out of the enemy I kill. The only thing that interests me is competition against clever enemies. I'm advocating for the thrill and for the immersive experience. I see no fucking explanation why should my revenge be made arbitrarily impossible by implementing an anti-griefer measures into PvP mode. I don't want to be forced to keep my levels low because I pay for imaginative advantages that come with the level only as long as you keep it to single character, which is a thing that none of PvPers do.  
---
Let me reiterate. You wan't to take a anti-griefer measure and then make all the casuals suffer because of it. Its a terrible idea. 
---
You guys are so lucky I‚Äôm 52 and love fallout I was so scared to play online but I love it I wish I had someone to play with my friends think I‚Äôm strange or something but I don‚Äôt care I love my Ps4 it‚Äôs the best thing I ever bought.
---
Because it's an RPG, I'll defend the current system. Card swapping is the balance each individual makes to weight the benefits and consequences. If we had all cards unlocked, then we would just be playing an adventure game. No roles. just everyone being an everything.
---
This sounds awesome, congratulations! 
---
Any plans on what next? 
---
I leave many sessions unhappy with the game, it isn‚Äôt the video alone.
---
Yeah. I think Biv stopped giving me "Wasted On" quests recently. So the rest of whatever available drinks are locked behind the luck of "tipsy taste test" rewards. A little frustrating. 
---
Yes, I have a Ghoul slayer Railway rifle !
---
Uh, because I paid for a game and expect it to function consistently, without several server disconnects per day or the need to download multi-Gb patches and hot fixes, that take the game down for 2-5 hours per week.
---
Why are you defending the worst performing "on-line" game? 
---
This thing performs like windows 3.1.1 on a token ring network.
---
Because reddit has no comparable feature to allow moderatoring
---
Thanks! So there are still drinking challenges, stupid. Atleast survival challenge seems doable
---
Is that not how it works already?
---
*(Came across this searching for something else unrelated to your question)*  
---
Waaait a second.... 
---
If you have AntiAliasing set to 0, how in ***the*** hell does everything look fine and not a jagged mess???  
---
Or can you apply AA through the NVidia Control Panel? *(I've got a Radeon which for whatever reason hasn't been able to force AA in some games for a number of years \[except MFAA, which is like FXAA, and both look like garbage so are not an acceptable alternative\])*
---
I would, if I wasn't holding 1+ workshops, and running around crouched. I don't trust people with my 5.56 production.
---
I think that guy is a troll or something look at his comment history, that's almost the only thing he says in the recent stuff lol
---
I mostly agree. It would have been nice to have a few event type things to do at launch and not have to wait 3 months to get a booze daily.
---
Ultracite Armor and Mod plans are common drops from SBQ (though, specific mod plans can be rarer than others).  And rare drops from normal SBs.  Prime receiver plans for weapons you don't already know seem to always drop from SBQ, and be a rare drop from SBs as well.
---
I server hoped 50times at silo to get this achievement, i was fucking dissapointed.
---
didn't use known plans. Only took the time to start playing with mods after known had been incorporated. I mean they probs didnt outright jack the modders code, but theres only so many ways to implement something like that. so id guess their methods are similar. 
---
As far as the bug youre getting, known plans looks to be just the dll (dxgi.dll) 
---
Close game and launcher, then move it out of its folder to somewhere like the desktop. (It should be in program files (x86) &gt; Bethesda.net launcher &gt; games &gt; fallout76 by default) Relaunch
---
Having roaming bots to protect your land seems 100% better then rocket launchers.
---
ah ok now i see the logic. Well I have a pretty unique bloodied fire rate plasma rifle and a bloodied vats crit laser rifle with plus 1 perception that I recently acquired here. I dont think you stated those on your wanted list but does any of those interest you?
---
Does your open sign function with a switch?!
---
In 2 weeks I and most people would have the exact same build at lvl 50. I feels like your really have not put mutch thought into what your asking.
---
Hey u/da5hitta,
---
This is currently planned to be fixed in the next update. 
---
I wish the freaking wooden gates that are available would work for me! They never snap with any of the fences I make and I‚Äôve tried everything...ugh!
---
I‚Äôm not sure if it was using some sort of exploit but last night I visited another characters camp and he had places it on top of one of the monorail carts so his camp was inside it and around it. If this is what you‚Äôre referring to?
---
Meditation place in the back
---
I said I didn‚Äôt want to detail my many problems with it the game because I‚Äôve stated it all in other threads, and discussion of those problems go beyond the scope of this thread.
---
Nope, anyone can see you disregarded my tabletop question with a bullshit excuse as to why you think it's irrelevant.  But that means you don't like the answer you came up with in your head and your confirmation bias decided it wasn't relevant.   Analogies are a powerful and relevant tool and if you can display the discrepancy in the analogy that makes it totally irrelevant fine.  But ones own confirmation bias is also hard to break through.  There are direct correlations between this game and the rules we all agree to play by, and a role playing tabletop game, with rules we all agree to play by.  The smaller scale situation of the tabletop game just makes it easier to visualize why having a rule in the game is pointless if we also allow people to get around it so easily.  Why drop double caps in either situation, if we allow people to transfer their "gold" from one character sheet to another for safe keeping?
---
Or someone else dumped their 1*'s on it.
---
Obviously you can't build there because it's a location marked on the map, Tanagra town is useful for few things: you can farm this location if u are looking for legendary cuz there are crickets in the cave at the top and sometimes legendary crickets spawn there, second on the roof of a broken house you can find a card that's  used to unlock the nuka cola painting for the x01
---
I prefer my explosive gatling laser for anything else, with the new patch that thing just spits out a lovely stream of death and keeps going for day or two before needing repairs.
---
And fusion cores are so easy to come by.
---
The soundtrack  (non-radio music) for FO76 is actually pretty decent.
---
Got a bloodied one yesterday try ed it out was not to bad stock needs upgraded.
---
There are wooden gates available?!? Which section are they under?

A very good way to avoid the toxicity of most trolls, for whom I reserve no time in removing.
---
Thats fucked
---
Bloodied unarmed assasin+sentinel.
---
Thank you! 
---
I'm on a mission to find a two shot heavy weapon and then taking on the SBQ without being totally useless. Once I get that redemption... I dont know what would be next. Probably just player vending, selling excess plans  lol
---
I'm level 95 with 14 banked level ups.  Because yeah, perk cards are so annoying I haven't even bothered to get new ones that I'll ignore.  
---
And my build is good enough to not die regularly, thats it.  meh.
---
I don't mind the card system. I'm just tired of getting the same cards that I've maxed out over and over again.
---
Omg I love you 
---
It sounds fair enough I don‚Äôt know how many times people have fast travelled into a location I am and made my level 15 character suddenly be surrounded by level 44 mobs.
---
If low levels should stay away from SBQ to prevent it becoming harder maybe high levels should avoid areas where low levels are to stop the level scaling?
---
I know I‚Äôd personally prefer for players at both ends of the spectrum to do whatever they want but it certainly shouldn‚Äôt be one sided if we decide etiquette requires us to avoid making life difficult for each other.
---
It‚Äôs also childish to justify high level players super sledgehammering low levels because they made the SBQ more difficult. 
---
Not interested sorry, thank you for the offers
---
Oh that would be helpful. Just today I got a random invite and searched for the player on the map, to get some more informations. It would be nice to know what they want, when it's not clear.   
---
I also had the situation where i played with someone and i can't use the voice chat. It's not that i don't have a mic but i stream my pc and connecting a mic over that is in beta and it doesn't workes that well. I kinda got it working for a few minutes but than he told me he just can hear noise. It would be great to ask him for discord or something, because on my host pc i don't have mic issues. I mean with people on your friendslist, chatting should be an option. With non friends, a limited text system, like in rocket leauge would be nice. Sure Emotes work but with random invites, text would be more helpful.   
---
Which is like all the opportunities for tactics real life provides, with additional benefit of being able to learn something out of being onehit.
---
Shot gun is better, but more importantly it gives you flexibility down the road. It's very easy to switch from shot gun to melee by switching cards end game.
---
Yes, that's what I'm saying: the magnitude of each effect is calculated additively, and the consequence of stacking effects is calculated multiplicatively. 
---
This gives an advantage to someone who goes with one kind of effect. For instance, suppose someone has Dodgy to negate 30% of melee damage and 30% from two sentinel's pieces. The damage they'll end up taking is (1-.30)*(1-.30)=.49--49%. But if, instead, they had four sentinel's pieces, they would be taking only 40% damage.
---
The calculation gives an advantage to someone who sort of puts all their eggs in one basket. The person with both Dodgy and sentinel's gear gets less damage reduction from a wider range of attacks, but the person who went all-out with sentinel's gets more damage reduction when the effect applies.
---
Thank you this happens 50% of the time every time 
---
This is my absolute favorite torso mod, but it requires you to have a mindset shift when you use it.
---
They constantly reach out and do a small amount of damage to any nearby enemies. Constant, not on hit. On hit would be ‚ÄúReactive Plates‚Äù. This is a constant, low-range small electric arc.
---
It absolutely does seem to drain the cores faster, I run through them like crazy. 
---
Yes.  Yes I want Battletoads.
---
Yes I have like 5 of them because I keep trying different ones to try and make it work. So far instigating has worked the best, just treat it like a sniper 
---
Haha! Well, please keep me in mind if you move on. I love rippers!
---
When will you be hosting your next fight?
---
Mine's a horseshoe!  I'd love to build something hexagonish though
---
Enforcer perk rank 3 works pretty well to get them to land. 
---
No game in the past 8 years has been finished on release. We have accepted this and companies know it. We're happy to pay extra or wait months for content already programmed to be unlocked. As for playing its a habit, you get in the habit of playing and doing certain things in game. You enjoyed it but now you have nothing else better to do and just turn it on and play. Same thing happens to me with alot of games. You play them for months even after they stop being fun and the new content is just enough to keep you interested and delay you're quitting. I think i have a problem.
---
It can be multiple things. As I understand, it's bug fixes and patches, along with turning it off and back on (default technology fix), rerouting from faulty hardware, and testing new hardware. 
---
Also, add a sign or two to the Plan to post around your camp if you like saying that surveillance cameras are present.
---
Mine did not, but I got eggs and was able to make my faschnacht doughnuts.  If I had gotten intestines then I could have made sausages too.  Maybe it's an either/or thing?  This was yesterday.
---
I stopped watching most of those guys on YouTube when after the 1,000th young yea video bashing F0 76 and he was complaining about things that were not even in the game anymore\\ not an issue anymore and realized that I'm listening to people who don't even play anymore.  I mean We are in April. They are still talking about that 1 time they played back in November ... 
---
I had 15 agility as soon as beta ended until now. I can switch to pistols whatever time i want. Sneak build ftw!
---
Are you looking for it or what to buy it?
---
Gotcha. Know about Born survivor, covert operative, escape artist, and sneak? 
---
Excellent, thank you! 
---
Considering the amount of pomade those guys used, he might have lived.  Protection...on a budget.
---
It's very random which of the two he seems to give me.  Three times so far he has actually given me both on the same day at the same time.
---
Yesterday he gave me "Wanted On:  Rad Ant Lager" which was nice cause it instantly gave me the recipe.  And while I was going about finding some Ants, the server crashed.  Upon logging in again, the daily quest changed to "Tipsy Taste Test:  Oak Holler Lager"  But I still kept the Red Ant Lager recipe it had previously given me.
---
Seems every day at 8pm EDT his daily resets, and I can receive one or the other daily... and if I'm super lucky, both!
---
I have never received actual drink Recipe items from the Wasted On quests as a reward at the end, instead it just unlocks right away which ever one it wants you to make (if you don't already have it) but the Tipsy Taste Test rewards appear to have a good chance of giving random Recipe plans at the end, though they do not give you the recipe for the requested booze to begin with.
---
Guy, you are so deep in your own self confident ruse that it hurts me. You have still failed to counter argue my answers prior and this nonexistent bias you speak of stems from the fact this is nothing like a tabletop. Where are you even getting that notion?
---
By level is a terrible idea because after about level 60 you should have all the damage perks you're going to need, and you don't ever get stronger after that. A level 250 isn't stronger than a level 100. Might have better gear, but without that they are the same.
---
I had 3 sub 20 at the SBQ the other day, kept dieing and then asking to be revived. Then there was a level 212 that obviously wasn't perked for damage or survivability wearing nothing but leather armor. She kept dieing too.
---
As far as her not landing, most scorchbeasts will rarely land, and not for long when they do, UNLESS you cripple one wing. As a shotgunner, I keep enforcer on, and the first thing I do is clip a wing to make them land and fight me one on one. If you're on PS4 I'm fully specced for damage, so feel free to add me and I'll tag along to keep her grounded and help end her reign of terror!
---
If you‚Äôre using PS4, the console options could let you adjust screen size 
---
I really hope they do.
---
The current perk system feels awful and it's really my main evidence I use when I claim that one of Fallout 76's issues was that they originally intended to monetize the SHIT out of it. The perk cards and it's system just scream microtransactions. It's not hard to see how you could buy perk packs for real $$$ and hopefully get the ones you need for your build. Otherwise the randomization aspect of it makes zero sense. If you only get so many cards in a character's "life" why allow a system where you might not get a card you need, can get duplicates of cards you have, and have no way to get more cards outside of leveling (which has a cap).
---
If they redesign the perk system to better suit what the game has become, it'd go a long way towards  reinstilling my confidence in this game's survivability.
---
Ah, thank you!
---
Both of which I‚Äôm super pumped for. 
---
And awesome, I don‚Äôt play survival, but I had heard about all the spawn killing going on. 
---
That would be cool
---
Not to hard to get in game. But still a decent price for it.
---
If you‚Äôre interested in selling it, I‚Äôd love to buy it! Been looking for one for a while now. 
---
Same, I accept them if nothing else but for fast travel perks
---
Mate I've been banned, unbanned then banned again, without doing a single thing wrong. I've seen people with backpacks and marine helmets in their inventories, but they never got bans for anything. I still play this shit show. Oceanic servers are incredibly dead at my play hours so it's basically me and 1-3 other people only on survival mode. Feels like a single player game. I love it.
---
These days it's very common.  It isn't being server hopped for as much as the first couple days of release, so it appears much more often inside the locked Dome.  125 caps seems to be a reasonable price.
---
Yeah, what a bunch of idiots, routinely taking down their game for regular maintenance and updates every Tuesday like they are on some kind of publicized schedule.  What a joke. 
---
Think your perks are pretty nice but you‚Äôre going to have to invest into some serious armor since you‚Äôre not using a lot of the dmg resist perks. 
---
It's like defragging your computer. It's more about checking if everything is still 100% soft or hardware which isn't possible to do when it's still live, with all the updates included of course. 
---
Funfact: ArenaNet invented a way to partition servers into many 'instances' which allows devs to update certain servers with new content, then roll it out while shutting outdated, live ones; rendering GUild Wars 2 needing zero downtime maintenance. Their tech is actually patented. 
---
Its usualy means Hardware (server) they take them off line check for any faults then the Dev/ admins can apply any server side patches or add a new client update
---
If you're looking for Battle royal PvP, then no. Don't bother.
---
If you're looking for adventure in post apocalyptic world/fallout world, then the answer is yes.
---
The story is fun and rewarding, if you bother to read and listen all the messages. If you just want to level fast and go to end game, there is no end game and no reason to level fast.
---
It's not an anti griefer measure.  Everyone is running around with no caps.  The double cap drop is dumb as fuck but two wrongs don't make a right.  If I wanted, I could drop all my caps from my level 200 unarmed unyeielding/cavalier character and then run around killing others with zero risk.  What. Is. The. Point.   Soon they will get it and also drop all their caps or spend them all.   Now it's just everyone running around with no caps.  Why? Why?  What the hell is so bad about a debuff that goes away once you have enough caps for your level?  If you got "griefed" to zero caps what else do you have to lose?  Just go sneak in the bushes and kill scorched for 10 minutes and sell the shotguns at the ammusmebt park vendor. Jesus y'all are blowing this debuff out of proportion in favor of everyone having zero caps and having no point.  You don't deserve 20% exp buff if you have nothing to lose
---
Collateral for fixing the security issues in allowing mods to send information to 3rd party servers. 
---
They can when they team you. Then they ft there and unteam you. That's when the grief fest starts. It's not a big deal to me coming from rust but I could see someone else being turned off on ever being on a team ever again if they experienced this.
---
Only put 1 point in strength, take blocker instead. With your 3 points in endurance take fireproof instead of radicool. Drop tenderizer for a sniper build imo. Max out luck, get four leaf clover, also drop gun fu for more sneak/ap perks IMO. There are some other tweaks to do I can give you a build I would use in a sec.
---
True but you still could have given a couple examples, either your own or pulled from the video that you agree with. Just so people could get more of an idea on where you stand and you maybe figure out what it is you do like enough to keep playing.
---
As it stands your post in incomplete and you should be ashamed for making it.&gt;! (not really. tongue in cheek dig at people calling the game incomplete for things like no npcs and such)!&lt;
---
I am currently building a pistol build with emphasis on VATS and I love it. Don't know about how it will hold up endgame, but for now it's really fun (currently lvl 25)
---
Do we know what kind of weapon it will count as? Rifle?
---
The afterlife is full of people complaining about unbalanced BS after they got one shotted from behind. 
---
Yeah I‚Äôm pretty pumped for the updates coming next week. I wonder if the Sheepsquatch will become a permanent cryptid to the game, or only available during Shear Terrorü§î
---
Probably unpopular opinion, but I agree with you. It would enhance the role play of a character.
---
Fixed perk assignments also would create a stronger player economy, as you'd have to interact with someone to get the best return on investment. Currently, anyone with 3 Int, 2 Agi and 3 Luck can repair all gear to 200% or craft ammo at \~2.1x average yield, so long as they're above level 50ish. Change it to 5 Int and a couple more levels and they can also upgrade any weapon or craft any kind of explosive.
---
I assume it's pretty easy to get multiple copies of it once you get the TNT Dome 7 key and just server hop. 
---
Same, make it a tiny little military style camp; one crafting bench, a cot, campfire, tent. That's it. Maybe even make us craft it at the Tinkers bench before we can deploy it and give it a time limit, like 20 minutes. 
---
They are starting more frequent now
---
I haven't really had that much trouble with it, but I would like lock picking to be one card and have saved hands so when I'm in camp I can just deal my camp hand out and when I'm solo, my lone wander hand, etc.  
---
They definitely do. I have a choo choo train character that has several.
---
They are the same!  This is an easier spawn point though you should still expect quite a bit of server hopping.
---
I hope so too. I have between 150 and 200 Boobleheads and Magazines to sell
---
Good. Now do it naked. With a mug as only weapon. 
---
Just remember, shotgun shells are one type of ammo. Pistol has about 5 types or so. 
---
Yeeeeah I am the opposite. I love building and collecting and doing quests...but at level 36 or so, there are areas of the map like Top of the World (especially!) I just can't go to without getting utterly wrecked. I had a shoot out with a whole crew of level 68 super mutants up there just trying to check the vendor after the plans update rolled out. All my guns broke and it took 20 minutes of taking pot shots from a stairwell to down them....this is not my idea of fun.
---
The first time my friend and I tried to quest there we were doing fine, stuff was scaled to our level throughout the resort.....until we went to turn something in. A level 60+ radscorpion killed him and chased me off the mountain (to my death)....we had to team up to try and get his junk back and died several more times. Kinda killed the vibe. :(
---
Most games (like ESO for example) tackles this by just making all enemies scaled to you...ie. you wouldn't get those unbalanced fights at level 20, BUT you and your level 200+ friend could meaningfully team up and both be challenged by whatever you're doing. It essentially eliminates the difficulty curve though.

Billy Bob's in WV used to be a Showbiz a long time ago. 
---
Lol Fallout never has and never will be some realistic simulator of actual life. 
---
And theres a lot of merit to how stupid a One Shot Kill fest is. You can be one shot by the bloodied builds easily, thats not some "tactical mistake"
---
Theres a big reason why literally all if the popular and best shooters arent one shot kills outside of very few weapons that require headshots. 
---
One shot kill meta very literally comes down to who shoots first in most situations, which is just dumb as fuck. No tactics required, just shoot first
---
I am on xb1 or I would definitely take you up on that offer!
---
END is almost useless as a whole. I got good doggy in a perk pack and didn't bother putting any points into the stat until I could unlock fireproof.
---
Applied :)
---
I‚Äôll drop my comment as a base comment and not a reply to a reply.
---
I have one character I use these on and they are so much fun I have to stop myself from putting these on more characters but it really is a somewhat specific build I‚Äôm using them on. 
---
Tesla Coils function CONTINUOUSLY, doing a small amount of electrical damage to nearby enemies. They ARE NOT triggered on hit. This is different from the mutation or the Reactive Plates which do function on-hit.
---
They DO hit sleeping targets - no sneaking with these on. This will wake them up and get them chasing you (ie, ghouls at the Whitespring). They DO NOT arbitrarily aggro the bots at Whitespring.
---
If you have this and the mutation, this will do small damage and if hit the mutation may also fire, doing more to everything near by.  They work independently.
---
It may be something similar to how the hazmat suit works, where it gives you a base rad resistance simply for having it on instead, I'm not too sure myself 
---
Ok I just thought it had released already and I wasnt aware.
---
I feel like I sorta figured out what I am upset about with end game. It‚Äôs in the edit, saying the sessions leave my character almost exactly the way I started them, with no progression.
---
Wow

They announced in some interviews that they had no idea the CAMP would be so popular, yet it's been one of their favorite things to see so far from the game. I think in the future they plan on adding quite a bit more to the CAMPs, considering they originally didn't plan on doing much with it yet it's already been so expanded on. 
---
Takeover workshops and do the defend them quests. Do events between defending your workshop quest. If your in the middle of an event youll get a reclaim your workshop quest after you fail the defending one. 
---
When i try to power level ill do 4 workshops and any events nearbyish to any of them.
---
You might stand to lose caps depending on the amount of events you are doing but youll get a decent amount of plans and stims from doing it.
---
Can we get posts for other weapons in the same situation, like the Chainsaw? Correct me if I'm wrong, but the Chainsaw doesn't benefit from any melee perks. Can we get some legendary Chainsaws, while we're at it? I wanna play DOOM in FO76.
---
I think I read that rather than buy new legendaries you roll new stats on another legendary you own. 
---
What level are you? There's been speculation that it increases with your level. 
---
Also, when's the last time you built? With patch 7 they changed allowance on certain items allowing for "bigger budget" 
---
no problem. Thanks anyways :)
---
I would be happy to help you with your build if that is an issue.
---
My current character is only level 80ish and has nothing over a 2 star legendary (armor at that). For a weapon I cycle between a regular Hunting Rifle and a 1 star (Instigating) Lever Action. At night with a 3.5x sneak modifier and a headshot, not much survives beyond the first hit. Assuming I get the drop on a SB, I drop them before I have to reload the magazine.
---
As a kid? I had my 21st - 35th birthdays there!
---
I don‚Äôt think pistols are meta for anything?
---
Shotgun can pivot easily to melee (1h, 2h, punching) or heavy weapons easily.
---
Go down inside the tree. The Colossi are rising.
---
"Apparently" 
---
I know right? Fallout 76 has bugs that existed back in Skyrim. 
---
Ok, see you there.
---
I had a server like that and got two good 3* pvp guns. RNG was blessing me
---
I‚Äôd love to make a QOL/balanced load out. A queen load out, a repairing load out. Lock/hack load out. I‚Äôd still be swapping load outs all day but at least we could have pre sets so we don‚Äôt forget to change them back every time. I fought a queen yesterday without nerdrage and demo perks because the nuke dropped unexpectedly and I didn‚Äôt change my perks back after repairing armor and guns. Derp 
---
Oh I just disagree that there is no possibility of tactics in those conditions, I agree these aint the best possible ones to have entertaining game.
---
Definitely is now.  It's almost always there when I log in each day.  And sometimes there when I end up joining a new server even though I already picked it up myself, meaning another player in the area made it spawn but didn't bother getting it, either cause they already have it or don't know about it (it is a low level area very close to V-76)
---
There are a 2 or 3 junk pile locations along that river to the west stretching down toward Mothman-area and the Workshop, that make for good Camp locations, and easy hop on login to get to the Dome and pick up a bunch of Nuka Cola, Cherry and Quantums, plus multiple copies of X01 and T-51b paint plans.
---
whats green?
---
Have you friends help you unlock the vendors by fast traveling to them. Get a clothing recipe sell your unwanted crap to vendors every day like unwanted aid items the sell the outfits you made to make up the difference. You should profit at least 1k caps a day. In 2 or 3 days you should be able to afford a low lvl tse weapon bought of a trading redit site. That alone will get you to lvl 50 10x faster.
---
I have a Mirelurk Queen, and a Hermit Crab, but they are definitely not Tamed, but they are sometimes legendary.
---
Wanna fix the caps economy? Bring in the "gamble" system that basically every clickSpam/looterShooter grindy ass MMO worth its salt has.   
---
Pay X amount of caps for a weapon. Lets say 2k for a handmade. All stats are random. (within defined ranges) Could be an endgame god tier 3\* with perfect rolls or a level 1 cap gun.  Wont know until you buy it.  Id be selling every 1\* im sitting on for like 50c just to keep rolling those dice.   
---
The issue isnt a cap limit, its a lack of things to buy with caps.
---
Haha well the status website says it was still undergoing maintenance. 
---
I don't accept as it kills my lone wander perk
---
Ohhhhh. Thank u "excuse the blonde moment" been doing alot of exploring lately trying to find new places and items 
---
I've seen 3 since beta
---
That's fine
---
How's that work without being able to hack terminals and unlock doors?
---
Almost heaven... 
---
The key is the photo man.  Gotta get the perfect spot and get  photomode out!  
---
As others have said, get a hazmat suit, I regularly make runs to the nuka bunker to grab the 3 there and put them in Flatwoods for the lowbies.   If you are on PC&lt; add me and I'll go grab you one and as someone else said, follow a high level around, don't get in their way and just tag the ghouls for some dmg and you are good to go!    
---
TBH, unless I am low for some reason, I leave the high end loot on the ghouls as it just weighs too much for my stash and I probably already maxxed out vendors already that day, so feel free to loot too, but ask first!
---
But if we can already swap to everything on the fly, everyone can already be an everything, it's just tedious and annoying 
---
Definitely had this many and more legendary drops in a whitesprings run. I usually vendor all berserker, stalker and mutants. Unless they have awesome other mods.
---
You can cripple the mirelurk queen's legs and acid spouts. Making her just as useless. A skilled hunter should be able to easily take out any prey. If you don't know what you're doing anything can wreck you. Once you know to shoot them in the leg though, it's over. That's not something that you would just "forget" as a big game hunter. Them being easy is just a learning curve that we have beaten lol.
---
So do we always die if we stand in the Blast Zone radius before the nuke strikes the ground? Even in Excavator PA. I did die when the nuke hit the WS
---
That‚Äôs the entire point of the video. Now I think he goes too far in including too many types of games as incomplete, but for some he has a point. Whether 76 had enough content at the start is where I‚Äôm not sure.
---
Perk loadouts.  That would at least be a good start.
---
I hope they bring the red rocket garage doors back soon, I never had a chance to grab them up... 
---
The old system actually made the game more replayable, evev if it "forced" you to start over to try different builds. Now all you have to do us swap some cards around and you have a totally different build. And people are complaining because that's too much bother? I've played all the Fallout for hundreds of hours, and these complaints about swapping perk cards just has me shaking my head in amazement, honestly. 
---
Brother, I have the exact same situation. Except even getting my wife to play any kind of game, including Fallout 4, was jist never going to happen; she had zero interest in them. But when FO76 came out, she just kept watching me play and got interested in it. Once I could buy another Xbox for Christmas, her and I have played almost every day since. 
---
We aren't nearly as aggressive, haha, but we have a load of fun just wandering Appalachia doing events. Where I thought she would have had more fun building and decorating her C.A.M.P, she gets really excited being able to explore different places that we haven't been to yet.
---
It‚Äôs a bug lol introduced 2 patches ago. Somehow they screwed up the camp Xmas lights and now they emit the ‚Äúnuka cola‚Äù light from the frat house.
---
If you can pick up this game for $5 sure. It's not worth anything near $60 though.
---
You know that‚Äôs a bug, not a feature... right? They just started doing that two patches ago.
---
Game devs have a Routine they need to do everytime for every tiny miny server they own.
---
Depend on what they are doing it cost some time.
---
Not so common but time consuming is a Hardware Maintenance: Server checks, Updating Hardware, Repair damage, Hard Drive change etc
---
Problem: Wrong Routine and you can destroy like everything if you dont have Backups. Gamedata, Playerdata etc.  
---
The other thing is a simple Software Maintenance. If a good Team prepares all contents before the Maintenance, this will end in just some seconds or Minutes to finish. In the End they just need to check on their systems if the Patch actually works and bring the servers back online. The game actually gets updates 24/7. You just don't see em because you only care about the Gigabytes you need to download in a Content Patch.
---
And thats exactly the problem with Software Maintenance: Does every Player getting the same content in the newest patch and what got destroyed and buggy by uploading that content worldwide. To prevent this shit they need to maintenance every little data and check if everything is alright.  
---
Ahh, yeah never mind then. Would rather have those lights legitimately instead of from a bug lol
---
I love posts likes these.  I screenshot them and send to my wife.  Mostly I get turd emoji back, but someday....
---
At the bare minimum we need card loadouts. I'm tired of having to swap out 700 cards when I wanna craft, or when I wanna pick some locks, or when I wanna swap from heavy guns to melee.
---
This. 
---
The only item that isn't level-restricted that I can think of is shielded under-armor. You might be able to get your teammates to pass you some. 
---
Beyond that, I'd just ask for consumables (stimpacks and ammo) so you can focus on leveling rather than bureaucracy. The nuke-zone food (ionized meat) and drink (inert flux) is also nice since it's abundant for your high-level friends, but you can pile it in your stash and it won't spoil. Won't make you powerful, but saves you time. 
---
Hate to hijack this but what about Power Armor explosive vents? They have never worked. Even if all they do is increase the radius of Tha damage that doesn't help if you increase the radius of something that does no damage... 
---
It's all in the build.
---
On PC, does highlighting the card you want to rank up and pressing "R" to rank up the perk card actually select that card as the card to be ranked up?
---
I‚Äôm on the same spot, cool area to build in.  
---
or be able to auto-switch if you enter your own camp.
---
swapping to the armor repair, ammo +, crafting -, turret + perks is super annoying.. then I inevitable forget to put one back and 2 hr later I realize I never put my Enforcer perk back on and that's why i'm strugging to knee cap the fucking deathclaw. 
---
Looks like hes commented the same thing on like 20 other posts lol
---
Its real estate, just fyi 
---
So I don‚Äôt have class freak yet as I‚Äôm only level 31 and only just managed to get Starched Genes. So the mutations I have vs the low level agility and perception is being cancelled out basically I think. As I only have 3 in agility and 4 in perception.  I have the VATS perk in perception but might be a bit wasted for me if I can‚Äôt even use it. Thank you for taking time to explain it. Appreciate it üëèüèº
---
at least the placement it right
---
With the updates coming to the Whitespring Resort area, would be nicer (imo) if they made a side quest involving the receptionist there giving us the ability to send/receive (leave for pickup) items between yourself and other characters.
---
A player hub with trading and all the vendor factions (minus the one locked behind story progression it seems, as they are excluding Encalve representation from Whitespring).
---
Since I hit lvl 65 I‚Äôm seeing many more legendarys everywhere I go,even lvl 1 legendary scorch yesterday
---
Doesn't Mr Messenger say if you want something delivered to go to his HQ?
---
I know it's just flavour text/speech but, I'd pay to send Mr Messenger to another player, or even Insult Bot.
---
I used to used ammo smith two but now I'm considering it not worth it, but I will continue to swap out Fix It Good and White Knight. It's just that trade off of is it worth the time to swap and me forgetting to reswap?
---
There needs to be some sort of deterrent to swapping too easily. In a Single player Fallout, i wouldn't mind, but the soul of 76 is to rely on others.
---
Incredible! I‚Äôd say take out the cola machine and throw a distillery next to that stove, but I reckon that‚Äôs just personal preference. Awesome job! 
---
I believe he's referring to being everything all at once. You have to pick and choose what you want at any given time. Sure you can own everything and make changes when you want but you still have to commit at a certain point. 
---
If you want a modern MMO with WoW  type progression systems ... then no.   
---
If you enjoyed Fallout games and would enjoy playing another game, then yes.   My favorite times have just been exploring the lore and the random stuff in the game
---
i have a picture of me on a built ladder literally next to the blast zone on a safe place giving the fallout thumbs up facing away :) its a pretty sight to see those fall lol
---
Ah excellent! Interesting. Sorry I'm a 76 newb. XD
---
I would prefer them just do a talent system that we put points into. 
---
There are some, like the monorail in the bog, that you can place your camp high enough to put your camp items inside the monorail. But you can't build anything unless you stack stairs up there to place a floor.  
---
What I would like to do, for example, is build a shack in the big circle at the top of a monorail tower that has stairs all the way up.
---
A .45 \_\_WILL NOT\_\_ kill an elephant in an instant in real life...
---
I like the tension of Survival. But she's definitely a shit-starter. We're never bored that's for sure haha. 
---
yea, gw2 did alot of things right, this was one of them.   
---
(they did some things wrong too) 
---
You ask a good question: why have a limit? Being Scrooge McDuck is awesome. The answer is both very simple and, also, rather complex (complex in that it deals with the interactions of humans and works to influence our behaviors). At its simplest, the ‚Äúcap limit‚Äù is a monetary control system which is designed, at least partially, to address hyperinflation. Someone else mentioned inflation and they are correct. And BGS chose this limit likely after serious thought and study of other online games.
---
Perhaps BGS will, at some point, change this limit but only if such a change is beneficial to their economic modeling. It would probably require a bit of retooling of a host of other systems. Think of your stash limits or the cost of fast travel in these terms and you‚Äôll see how these all interact with one another to influence both your behavior and your economic activity.
---
I do not expect them to change this limit, especially if one of their stated desires is to encourage players to develop their own forms of barter and trade.
---
What did they add today? Was it just the survival mode fast travel invulnerably? 
---
I know patch 8 next week is the big one, but saw mention of a new quest?
---
Not a bad price at all, he was prolly just trying to get rid of it. It‚Äôs so common now people that have been farming and selling them have been having a hard time finding new buyers
---
My guess is the vending machine will be tied to your stash, like the fermenter is.
---
Glad I could help!
---
Awesome!  A reason to go back to survival mode
---
Look at  [https://fo76map.com/](https://fo76map.com/) 
---
At level 8, there's a nice guitar sword right by the vault.
---
And at that level, I just scrapped hunting rifles like crazy for the mods, and eventually had myself a hardened one with a suppressor and scope. I considered that "pretty good shit" and still use one from time to time.
---
Well, I hope they dont fix it.
---
&gt;Why are you defending the worst performing "on-line" game?
---
You must not play a lot of games if you think this is the worst performing.
---
This wouldn't work as intended. the cards being at different levels causes it to be level locked. This way only more powerful characters can pick higher level locks.
---
In Fallout 3, New Vegas, and Fallout 4; you can max out pretty much everything with proper knowledge of the games. That‚Äôs the standard the series set so it being a role playing game isn‚Äôt an excuse. And plot wise, you‚Äôre still in a role and that‚Äôs all the genre name means.
---
Fact is the current perk system is convoluted, unweildy, and just plain anti-fun. Almost RPG since the late 90‚Äôs lets you respec and customize at will. They took 20 steps back with this design and it should be changed. End of story. 
---
There's actually never a point in the game where the main quest will not continue if you can't get past an area. And in the very rare instances where there appears to be no way around something important the terminal or lock is level 0, so anyone can hack or pick it. 
---
Good price. I usually post it for 1200 caps on my shop, and it's gone within hours. So, yeah very nice. I mean free is obviously better, and the door is wide open 75% of the time I chk. Of which maybe 20% of the time the plan will just be laying there available.
---
I dont care for exp buff too lol. 50% damage debuff as a regular PvP mechanic is single most powerful of them. This is an anti-griefer measure and the fact you ignore consequences of your wishes would not change those consequences and a less enjoyable game. Actually if this would be such a debuff that you get -20% XP not +20%XP if you are bankrupt would be fine by me. Just not anything that completely fucks up PvP balance just as this anti-griefer adventure mechanics would do in survival.
---
And also be subject to pvp. Plan accordingly. 
---
No, but answer me this. Given you have the ability to switch these belongings, would you, with rules and mechanics granting you this ability?
---
And going postal....outfit
---
Notimpossiblebutquitehardtoobtainium
---
You have to have a combat perk set and a crafting perk set, and it's better if you do the combat one first. You can clear an area and then swap perks and go through and explore, pick locks, etc.
---
Not bad.  Can you build a walkway between the scaffolding/stairway area up to the windmill generators and the main building on the other part of the tower, or are they not on equal levels to snap up nicely to?  Marsupial hops required to get to the main building?
---
Agreed, for balance sake there shouldnt be top tier gear based on RNG\Exploits. Toss the legendaries out let the OP people monopolizing survival cry about it when they dont have god rolls and cant spawn camp and be pricks for shits and giggles. 
---
No, it auto selects the card closest to max when you do that, instigating much frustration
---
Pistol VATS is fun but not meta. You just wait until they fix the assaultron head (a pistol) though. Quad-assaultron head will become the meta. I can dream. 
---
Oh my. Goodbye $$. 
---
NW part of the map... Just a few hundred meters due east of Deathclaw Island. 
---
I'm also not against other penalties, I just think they should not make you chanceless in PvP.
---
Better idea than most. I could see this implemented in the game. After all, bots were very important before the war, and are very abundant after.
---
Thanks for the comments, now i know what it is like for others when they find it :)
---
I try to look in the direction where the nuke drops. I don't fast travel near the zone. Once my camp was right in the edge the zone. The nuke got dropped at whitespring but a bit to far right. My camp was on the cliff, near the train station. This would be the perfect view to see it drop.   
---
Last week I was right in the brotherhood questline and was in the cave near the SBQ. First i thought i might get killed but i risked it. After i was done with that quest, i thought it might be worth to look whats happening in a blast zone. I helped killing the SBQ. It was pretty low on health, when i joined. Sadly there was nothing else to find. Sure there are some plants to get but i didn't found enemies to get the resources to stabilize the stuff.   
---
I never accept random team invites cause I don't want to potentially have them show up at my camp, leave the team, and then start destroying it for no reason, other than them being a giant asshole. Unless I'm trading with you through reddit (who has done successful trades in the past), you're friends with one of my friends, or you're some random stranger I've been talking to for awhile, I'm not teaming with you and I 100% do not trust you.
---
The .50 in this game confuses me. There's two types, the .50 BMG (stands for Browning Machine Gun) while the second type is a .50 AE (Action Express). The picture in the game is clearly a BMG. not an AE. (An AE looks like a bigger, fatter .38 round, while the BMG looks like a bigger fatter 5.56, .308 or 7.62 round) However the .50 Cal gun in FO76 is clearly a Browning, which no doubt would use the .50 BMG. 
---
What I don't get is that the Hunting Rifle using a .50 Receiver and it using that BMG round with a wooden stock and flimsy metal barrel. Both would be torn apart and warped and overall not usable after the first shot, even your face and hands may be torn apart and warped. So while the .50 AE is used for the IMI Desert Eagle (Which can use .357, .44 and .50AE), it's probably the only ".50" that can be used in the Hunting Rifle without the barrel exploding, however the picture clearly isn't an AE, it's a BMG. So the only "realistic" thing to do with the .50 ammo is have it only used for the .50 Cal Machine Gun and just remove the .50 Receiver for the Hunting Rifle, or even make it need a certain stock and barrel to be able to use it, or just create a whole new sniper altogether 
---
You might try the Market76 reddit if you haven‚Äôt already. Great place to try and buy, sell, and trade
---
That's why I have a house at white springs. 
---
Protected by sentry bots.
---
Great build, looks amazing
---
Typically my wife and I do this purely to add that element ourselves and won‚Äôt rearrange cards until the next level up
---
There‚Äôs Lots of great discounts! 
---
The perk system to me, reminds me of a table top RPG. I kinda like it. I see it as a way to make players play roles and rely on others while also being flexible to be switched out. Making the SPECIAL allocation the only hard card "cap".
---
3rd time I've seen him say that in as many random posts.  Its'  Mr. 20gb guy!!
---
I absolutely agree legendary effects should be totally removed from pvp
---
The current system doesn‚Äôt balance anything because it still allows you to be a jack of all trades. I‚Äôm this instance all it does is add tedious micromanagement of cards which brings nothing to gameplay. 
---
you're gonna die alone
---
/s
---
Another huge batch of stuff leaving but it feels like they‚Äôve barely added anything since the last one...
---
I honestly have only had 2 groups ever take of my workshops in over 200 hours. Its not something i ever worry about.
---
It‚Äôs all good :) I hope they do this as well
---
You're right. I have mistaken it with the .45-70 gvt.
---
It's never affected me either.  But wanted them to be aware what COULD happen
---
I guess he's extremely butthurt at big updates Meh who cares let him cry lol
---
Indeed my fellow vault dweller!  Survival shoe the problem with legendary weapons in PvP
---
Wut, those stairs stack? Omg how
---
Go to whitesprings golf club with several molotovs and a higher lvl friend. Learn how to get on the wall where the showers are. The ghouls kinda just stand there so you can tag all of them and the higher level friend can clean em up. In like 30 mins my friend went from lvl 2 to like 8.
---
Also another good way is to take the ammo shop with a high lvl friend. Have alot of aluminum and steel and shoot the vertibird once and have the friend destroy it. Each time you destroy it you get I think 300 xp.
---
Also I can not stress this enough do every single defend event you see. As a low level they won't care you're there and you get all the xp from the enemies that are killed and then plans and like 300xp on completion. Also you can literally kill one enemy and get the full xp for completing the event. 
---
Also taking a workstation gives a good amount of xp.
---
Sleeping in a bed will also give you more xp gained and there is a food cranberry pie or something like that that boost xp.
---
Hope this helps! Happy hunting!
---
This is crazy. It‚Äôs like Black Friday!
---
I did for a while, then I got tired if the same 10 songs so I stopped. But, I did put a radio in my camp so I could hear it in the background when I'm home 
---
What's the scientist set?
---
Skip the marine first off. Go trapper for the extra rad resist. Once you get sets of ass/sentinel, people will try radiation on you. 
---
Every point of Rad resist counts, and the armor is great in pve.
---
As for a gun, if you‚Äôre on Xbox, I could give you a FE LMG, so you can test it out, but I would stick to FE, since you definitely won‚Äôt one tap with a heavy gun.
---
Marine armor helmet 1.0 has been completely removed from the game. Marine armor helmet 2.0 is now a legit in-game item for which plans are obtainable through a random event reward.
---
The difference between 1.0 and 2.0 is that 1.0 had actual armor value. The 2.0 does not and is purely cosmetic. What you written about the marine armor helmet was true at some point but is now, to the best of my knowledge, obsolete.
---
The consequences are you might have to sneak around in the woods for 10 minutes and kill scorched.   Not ignoring it.   First of all, do you know how many people are allowed on each server?   Not enough to cover the whole map.  You make this out like it's fornite with a shrinking boundary.  It's survival, so base game with less pvp restrictions for an increased reward.   It is not "PvP deathmatch battle Royale Apex league of legends".   "Seek revenge" was removed for a reason.   I'd rather see permanent death than this risk-less bullshit.   This is survival.   SURVIVAL not super balanced PvP tournament.
---
I have almost 2.5k gunpowder *after* giving about 1.3k to my brother when he started playing. Grinding super mutants gives so much of it that I honestly had no idea you could craft gunpowder because I never had a need to look, lol. 
---
Personally, drop the damage resists. Damage mitigation &gt;&gt; damage resists.
---
I'm assuming this is for PvE only? 
---
For PvE and PvP, I use 2* Bandolier in STR ( ammo weight), and 2* Blocker (30% melee dmg reduction) va PvP/and melee mobs.
---
 3 END for max level Fireproof, which is essential vs explosive weapons (your own included), I swap with radicool when farming/carry weight solo as needed.
---
I only have 3 CHR, and 2* Lone Wanderer, I run solo a lot, and CHR is the least useful for a sniper.
---
Without at least 3-4 *'s Gunsmith in INT, you're going to be repairing guns, **a lot**. Nerd Rage for the +dmg and AP regen is recommended for bloodied builds 10* dmg+ at 1*  20% at 3*. 1-5*'s for Demolition expert, if you want explosive weapons later on.
---
I would drop Evasive from AGI for Dodgy, 30% damage reduction will outperform the DR.
---
If you're running a bloodied sniper, 3* Serendipity in LCK, is **the best** perk you can have. The 45% dmg avoidance procs *all the time*, and it's not limited to mob damage. It can 100% protect you from falls/traps/explosions/mini nukes/missles/crit headshots. Honestly, I do so much base damage, I dropped Better crits entirely.
---
Two is too little. We need **Threeeeeeeee Dawg** Comin at cha live from Galaxy New Radio!
---
As long as the Launch Control Chief is alive the launch sequence bar will continue filling. It'll go faster if you have more of the section chiefs active, but he's the only essential one. 
---
Also, if he dies you can go into the room he spawns from and use the terminal to create a new one.
---
I‚Äôd love to have that door, as a door
---
I believe they are on the same level, yes. To be honest, I fear that if I start building floor pieces to extend across the orange pipe, I won't be able to remove them.  
---
Also the inside of main structure is visually pretty glitched, but it's possible to build inside it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPN13RpjIyQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPN13RpjIyQ)  
---
Send pics if you try something :)
---
You have a mug what more do you want
---
What would you guys recommend (I have saved up free atom) should I get the patriot camo skins, vault Tec skins, or wait and see for next atom store updates. 
---
Is that 4 poster bed the one that looks like it should be a nice big spacious bed, but in reality it's like a childsize version you can barely fit on?
---
Not really, not that at least. After little bit of playing you have all the bobby pins you could ever need. You can carry them all and they only are worth 1 caps when selling so really you only save little bit of personal time.
---
I like the drop healing items only I had 20 vintage nuka shine on me didn‚Äôt know those were the first ones to go 
---
The Choo Choo noise is why I keep coming back. Reminds me of my fave Fallout 4 rifle, The Laser Musket.  :)
---
SHAME 
---
I would love to see mailing services driven by a few quests.
---
1/ Do a quest that enables you to build an item in your camp (the out-box mechanism)
---
2/ Once you build the item, you can place some contents in it up to some # / weight limit and specify a user.
---
3/ When user next logs in they are delivered the mail based on the service you sent it with. Maybe you have to have an inbox on your side as well you initiate a ‚Äúcheck‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready to deliver my mail‚Äù flag.
---
Ok here‚Äôs the part I think would be fun.
---
The mail service could be a few different options.
---
1/ Messenger / Mr. Prize Bot / Insult Bot ... this would be a bot following you around, finding you and giving you the items
---
2/ MODUS delivery ... a gift from the sky, facilitated by MODUS just like the end of Dropped Connection.
---
3/ Graham ... ok maybe not Graham, but it would be cool to have some sort traveling trader delivery mechanism. Carrier pigeon? Trained dog? TRAINED DEATHCLAW? Ok now that I‚Äôm on that crazy, maybe it could take the shape of your tamed creature (if you have one).
---
Agreed. I think there should be an ability to trade said cards we have duplicates of
---
The Perks in 3 weren't all accessible. You would have to pick and chose and plan your build.
---
And you can still respec albeit with a lot of leveling.
---
Never fails.  I bought the white shag carpet last night.  "What did you get in your pumpkin Charlie Brown?"  "Rocks, all I ever get is rocks."
---
Are you sure Sneak attack is disabled? I‚Äôm fairly certain I‚Äôve hit a number of x3.75 hits with my silenced gauss. I‚Äôm honestly fairly inattentive, so I‚Äôll have to try sneak-shotting some poor schmo when I get home tonight so I can confirm, haha
---
I would love to be able to just place and furnish a whole travel trailer like home. There are plenty of these out in the wasteland and would love to live in one. 
---
Facebook? What is this 2005?
---
I'd love to see a mailing system as well. I just wonder how it could be handled for players with multiple characters. 
---
Iirc, all characters use the account name for display, so mailing something for a "main" character may be accidentally picked up by an alt? 
---
A special CAMP chest that could be used between characters would be amazing, but probably highly abused. Lol. Load times going between characters may offset that though. 
---
Yeah, which is why I store any of my best food or drink items in my stash. I shouldn‚Äôt have to worry about losing my one and only nukashine ( I made a new character).
---
Yeah, but a mirelurk queen has a dedicated ranged attack that is very damaging, whereas a Deathclaw doesn't.  And shooting their spouts is impossible without VATS, so while you can still shoot their legs out like any enemy, getting rid of their ranged attack still might take an extra effort.  
---
Mirelurk queens also didn't get any of their abilities stripped from Fallout 4, so they're still the same threat.  My point mostly is that they're arguably harder enemies than deathclaws even though you can cripple both easily. 
---
 This is the case with most large enemies, any large creature is going to have a terrain disadvantage because they're not going to be able to navigate to you easily, but if large enemies have ranged attacks, then they don't have to, which is what most of them lack.
---
Im pretty sure all mods for power armor take flux.
---
When you look at 600 chunks of lead, ask yourself "does this bring me joy"?  LOL
---
I used to keep like 500 of most items, and now I keep 200 max for stuff I use a lot or is very difficult to find.  Common stuff that I don't use much, like cloth and leather, I keep 50 for camp crafting or repairing the odd piece of armor.  I do keep 100 cork, because I always hang on to 3star armors and put ultra-light mods on it when I stash it.  Most pieces will end up being around 1-2lb.
---
Stable flux is also super heavy.  I used to keep 20+ of each and now I just have a handful for making shielded underarmor once in a while. Aside from repairing a rad shower, or possibly crafting PA mods, there's no real use in hoarding them.
---
Thats all games though. He just has to single out certain games for clicks. 76 had alot of content at launch. It took me about 10 weeks to platinum the game. Alot of people like to rush thru games and go "thats it" Games will never satisfy the i play 8-12 hours a day crowd. If you look at online games tossing in new content is how you keep people addicted. We may want everything at launch but we dont. We are conditioned to get weekly updates to get our fix. Look at fortnite,EA ultimate teams, etc at least 76 has free stuff no money or no grind to unlock it like other games have. Games have become more addicting and they are built that way at least im not having to pay to win or pay to participate in 76.
---
A lab coat and goggles 
---
Todd already has done that. There's no other way you can make the same game thrice.
---
A fellow redditor (u/Mephistote)  posted the pillar trick a while ago, try it out. It's surprisingly easy: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU7VpOhthMY&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU7VpOhthMY&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
My rule of thumb with receiving random invites: If I can't find you on the map, I'm not accepting.
---
A Vault Tec lab coat and goggles. 
---
Yup. I have to curl up into a ball lol. 
---
I got the patriots one I love it , is it on sale again ? I got it when it had gotten discounted for 1400 
---
I'm thoroughly impressed with the effort (and hacking) you put in to making this work.  It looks AMAZING!  Seriously.  Totally fits the game.
---
I always leave a propaganda poster in my free loot bags for other players. Make sure they know which side I'm on.
---
TSEs are not that strong anymore
---
Seek revange should be bringed back because lack of it does favor griefing. It kept your spawn point randomised and that was good.
---
 If you disagree with me that having control of your spawn by placing your camp on the back of your enemies - is between the most important survival tactical advantages, then you are indeed playing a different game than I do. But it is and being denied that possibility is a severe punishment.
---
Fixed last patch
---
I think that's kinda the point though with most of it to create the exploration/discovery/experimentation aspect.
---
Why not a happy middle ground? Make headshots do 5x normal damage.
---
I‚Äôm going to assume it is my build being one of the barriers.  There was never a set plan to it.  I like to snipe and then come in and finish off with a shotgun.  I‚Äôve put some cards into things that give more damage to these two areas....besides that I just pick what sounds good for the moment.  I have been stumbling along not knowing what to really do, and have been feeling lost enough to accept some handholding from someone nice enough to help
---
I‚Äôm currently a level 33....so I am not sure how much can be changed.  A new character is not an option, as it‚Äôs taken since day 1 to get to this point.  I really need the help to be honest 
---
It's on sale for 1260
---
I only have 1240 but I can make up the difference rather easily 
---
Yeah they did, in the last ITV:
---
&gt; We‚Äôve read feedback from many players in the Fallout 76 community who would like to add a more personal touch to their gear and, with Patch 8, we‚Äôre adding the ability to rename your items
---
Heck yes. I also want the second floor railings back as well as the non-broken window warehouse/greenhouse walls and ceiling. I am in need of a skylight for my loft style builds! More windows, walls/fencing, and roofs are a must!
---
Yep, exactly, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre actually charging atom point for hairstyles that where available in Fallout 4
---
&gt; I don't think their idea was to get it absolutely right the first time. That's why it's a beta. The idea is to shake out what isn't working.
---
You have more optimism in bethesda than I do 
---
Have them be able to wear hats like the fachnat ones. I would love to have a whitesprings protectron with a top hat walking around my camp
---
I was SO ready to spend money on that, but then I saw someone post an expectation vs reality picture of the character laying on it, and I immediately shut my wallet lol
---
Pistols were extremely strong when you could crit on every hit with automatic weapons.
---
I use pistols for PVP. They are great for ambush players. Sneak plus head shot plus critical hits multiply your damage greatly. I was doing 1,800 damage with a black powder pistol in PVP before one shot protection became a thing. Now automatics seem much more versatile. I killed a full sentinel assassins player three times before he got me. Very long fight. Lots of baiting and hiding.
---
Lol get food with RNG? You have no idea what your talking about kid shove off
---
Yes most diff worth it dude it‚Äôs my fav skin out of the paints other than blackbird 
---
Please let it I have a furious one and I want it to be viable 
---
It should, to my knowledge mostly everything stacks.
---
Spamming this is not appreciated.
---
I agree with everything you said, except for the fast travel points. Fast travel is a luxury, and since you are protected from possible PVP when traveling from Morgantown Station down to Watoga Station, you should have to roll the dice on whether someone is camping and waiting for you. I personally haven‚Äôt fast travelled once in the 12+ hours I‚Äôve spent in survival; I choose to walk so I can‚Äôt be surprised. 
---
You sound like Quina...
---
I still use it. Fits my woodsy color theme. 
---
It was just an example, there would always be a legendary effect stronger than the rest
---
Good info.   I‚Äôm going to test them out today at WS.  I‚Äôll walk up to the WS bots and confirm.   
---
Alright! I'll probably get it then! Thanks for your input! üòÅ
---
I usually acquire the 600 lead and 1000 steel without knowing it.
---
But I have a minus ammo weight legendary piece.  So every couple days I just burn all my steel and lead into Ammo and carry it around.  Pretty much always at 16,000 5.56 and 10,000 .45
---
It's hard to say, because you can one shot pretty much anything in the game with a banked crit and three ranks of Better Criticals.  I don't enjoy pvp, so I don't really know how crits affect other players.
---
I'd bet that they stack.  It's possible there might be a hard cap on how much benefit you can stack on top of each other, like armor piercing perks, anti-armor magazine mods and anti-armor legendary effects.  At some point you just hit a limit.
---
Unless a dev chimes in or someone datamines the actual numbers, it's just conjecture.
---
Jim Sterling hates micro transactions in non free to play games.  While there are many justifications for that opinion, and counter arguments as to how they work in an ongoing new content system, I feel it clouds his impressions sometimes.  He's automatically going to like games less if they have mtx.
---
He also doesn't trust companies that implement mtx well to not later change them to rake in more money.  So any argument about how well the Atom shop is implemented doesnt mean much to him because their is always a chance they'll change it later to something more exploitative.
---
And, I honestly I think he prefers single player games and will judge all games, even online multi-player games with ongoing content additions, by the single player standard.  The single player standard we had before most consoles where online:  you can't update later so make it as perfect as possible before release.  
---
I guess we just disagree on how much there was to do in the end. I‚Äôm not in the no-life crowd either, it took me quite a bit to get to end game, after the new year basically, but there was still quite a bit of time after that left before a content update. That‚Äôs where I‚Äôm like ‚Äúyeah maybe more stuff to do would have been nice‚Äù
---
Currently stuck with 6 str cards for melee, 5+5 cards on weapons wont break every 5 seconds, and 5luck for mutations. Then when I get to my base, my entire load out changes to repair / build/ and so one. THEN i change my load out when I decide I might want to havk/pick that lock.
---
I just need like.. 2 loadouts. Home base and out in the field. I'd be happy with that. 
---
That does make sense, but walking around everywhere is tedious, and can be very monotonous. I shouldn‚Äôt have to worry about a spawn camper being there with their bloodied handmade, just waiting for anyone unsuspecting to spawn there. It is nice to sneak up on a spawn camper and take all their stuff though.
---
Isn't there a modifier for weak points already?
---
If you read the story its interesting how the different factions worked and what they were doing to stop the scorched.
---
They are doing their best to let everyone be able to do what they have been able to do in FO4, but they also have to render that for the other players on the server. That's why the graphics are slightly worse than FO4, and everything is a little glitchier and there's more hang up. They had to tone some of it back or nothing would have worked until the next gen console lol.
---
I have several in game challenges I advanced in the beta and they were somekind of reset and never get the atoms. Example, known recipes 5/76 (and I already know almost everyone of them)
---
If at all possible, bring someone along who has hacker 3 and lockpick 3. If you can hack the terminals you can disable many of the turrets (or remove targeting restrictions and let them take out the robots), and lockpicking lets you take a shortcut to as well as getting you into a couple level 3 storage rooms with some decent loot.
---
That‚Äôs a dumb thing to say. I didn‚Äôt level up until 25 and from that point forward everything was awesome. Level 58 now. A near perfect build.
---
You have to have foundations to build tents?
---
The leader of the pack event in the forest will give you 3 low level legendaries.
---
Thanks! It's actually easy with the pillar trick.
---
Well I'm Julian so I hope like hell you're not Lahey.
---
As we will be encouraged to trade/sell...in new update coming, they have good reason increase the cap limit.
---
Yeah I almost always turn it off in-game and use nvidia cp or nvidia inspector sometimes
---
So if I already tried to convince them that transferring gold between character sheets was a bad idea (like I'm doing now) and that's what the DM and all my friends agreed on then, since it's such a small group, my next suggestion would be that we just remove dropping of gold from the game if none of us are going to be carrying gold.   If they insisted we kept gold dropping, and allowed gold transfers, I WOULD join my four friends in playing D&amp;D, transfer my gold to an alt character sheet, walking around with no gold and a pointless rule that we drop our gold that we don't have and get 20% more exp...?   But I'd still be asking why we have the rule if it's so easy to get around.
---
Great job and now I need a how to video.
---
Right, just kinda neat someone else noticed guy too.
---
I did that with the blue door lol
---
I love it when people say ‚Äúx is bad, but I don‚Äôt want to say why‚Äù because they open themselves up to debate and their dumb opinions get exposed as dumb.
---
I mean, they're not wrong: it is annoying to swap perks. Given a system where I can swap, i will swap. I just think that diminishes the uniqueness or flavor of each character.
---
Compare against Path of Exile: it has over 1300 skill points to accentuate how a character can play, but you cannot get more than maybe 130 before level cap. A full 90% of the skills are unavailable to any particular character. Many people continue to play and make new characters all the time and enjoy it.
---
They are talking about wanting to make structures players build more permanent so that when we log off someone else can log in and see what we built.
---
I feel so purdy in my blackbird 
---
He can't even say "live services" without changing his pitch to a mocking tone. 
---
Save  on a mule till the legendary vendor shows up
---
stil no handmade skins :/ come on, i am dying ...
---
yeah I use the soft serve location too,  it works .
---
There is a mod that does this. It is called Perk Loadout Manager.
---
Glad I'm not the only one who did a bar using the statues and stuff! I used just a bunch of shelves next to eachother for my counter though
---
I pvped on adventure in a 3v4 yesterday and our teams kept seeking revenge and the weaker players kept dying instantly still.  It puts you in vats range immediately and makes you a red blip on the map. Not ideal for survival. I agree spawns should be randomized more but again, two wrongs don't make a right.    
---
The railway rifle is just fun to use (I looove the sound it makes), but I think even with perks it's just not going to ever be quite effective. Too many other weapons are easily accessible and best in class.
---
Wow.  I'm guessing I use the same guns as you, handmade and lever action, and 3000 5.56 rounds have lasted me all week.  I still have like 2000 left.  I do pick up small handfuls from super mutants and ammo boxes all the time.  The only time I'll ever burn through a lot is SBQ.  I limit myself to 1000 .45, because I tend to stick with the handmade for high intensity battles.
---
And to get atoms we seem to have yet another week of alcohol challenges.
---
I'd see if they have the $1 for first month game pass deal (you can cancel right away and try each month after it expires, I did it twice and got it for $1 month for 2 months, $0.50 cents a month if you count my gf playing with me). There are many quality games on the pass (halo collection for one, Astroneers) but State of Decay 2 has been really fun since the latest difficulty update.  Its not a perfect coop game because its a smaller indie company that was bought by Microsoft, but there is several hours of fun to be had.
---
Not for console players :/
---
Survival mode for me changed 76 as a whole. I really loved it. I'm a little new on this reddit, and I'm curious that more people asked to take the leaderboards down. I'm not exactly sure if I do agree, but, to me, the SurvivalMode is how a real fallout game is meant to be played (I had not entered "deathmatch mode" yet, just to mention).
---
The world is dangerous, I take extra care to progress the game and attack any group of enemies. There are raiders everywhere, gunshots from far distances, and creeper guys saying "I see youuuu" on the mic. It's lovely.
---
The thing is, Survival mode is way more than "PVP". It's more like (for me) F4 Survival mode, my personal passion.
---
They gotta make their profit.  
---
agree to some extent on the weapons thing.  AAE weapons are hard to come by and tough to deal with without the proper setup.  I feel like limiting the damage a bit would help balance the field  
---
All of the armor shenanigans have something that stops it. So its really a rock paper scissors kinda deal.  Of course there's no way to counter everything, so youve gotta make some choices.   
---
bloodied? CryoNade &amp; Gamma gun em.   
---
Sentinel? Stagger, then unload on em.  Or crit, or energy/rads  
---
Cavalier? Keep your distance and wear em down, or crit em, or energy/rads.  Mind the VATS teleport shenanigans, it can close a ridiculous amount of distance in a hurry.  
---
Cham/stealth/sniper? Mentats. Short range, but effective.
---
PA? lol theres no scary PA players in PvP.
---
That‚Äôs already the case. If your shoot the wings they land. And if you continue to after they land they don‚Äôt take off again. I use a buzzblade on the queen for that reason. 
---
Outside of Scorch Beasts and Yao Guai, there isn‚Äôt much in the game you can‚Äôt kill with any stupid weapon in the game without much effort or risk. As long as you pick up some smart perks. 
---
thats the rub, what is a lack of content for you is plenty for others. when the game launched there was plenty to do, I would even argue the only difference in the amount of content in fallouot 76 to the single player games (pre-expansion) was the lack of vaults, but from the roadmap i guess they had to figure out how they were going to deal with them in multiplayer, and the silos took the place of them. What kept the single player games alive longer then the normal course of a game was user mods.
---
And with "no progression" can you be a bit more specific? Have you done all you wanted to do, gotten all the plans you wanted, that sort of thing. because every game has a wall that you hit eventually. I am just wondering if you hit it and think that you shouldnt have or if you just got bored with the game. I got burnt out a bit after the fasnacht event, and haven't even set foot in a silo for example. I just sign in now to see if there are and decent goodies on the atom store when it resets for the day maybe fool around if I am in the mood.
---
There is also the option of trying to do something in the game outside of the expected gameplay like that on fella who made a maze with a deathclaw in it and trapped players inside.
---
I can finally sell all my bobbleheads and magazines that I've been hoarding
---
I don't have time to vender personally.  If I do come across a player vender, I am definitely stopping to buy standard 5.56 ammo.
---
You already can
---
There are so many poor/questionable design decisions in this game
---
I believe they integrated NavMesh into everything, so putting floors with no stairs would cause the AI to freeze up trying to get up top, hence the "part of the structure would be inaccessible" message. If NavMesh wasn't, the enemies wouldn't be able to wall into our structures at all. 
---
Oh ya, I definitely have more ammo than I need.  Handmade and Lever Action.  LA for Ghouls, Scorched, etc.  Handmade for Super Mutants, SB and SBQ, and big baddies like Deathclaws, Yaoi Gaui, etc.  The Instigating sneak attacks of the LA really reduced my ammo usage during every day gameplay.
---
I burn thru maybe 2000 or so if I'm doing a Fissure Prime fight and cleanup.  And am usually replenished afterward by my junk stock.
---
I don‚Äôt think you can crit outside of Vats can you? At least since they nerfed Overdrive. 
---
Oh no. I'd only just saved up 3k atoms again.
---
We'll have a couple of Vault-Tec themed bundles up on April 4th. 
---
You can view the article on Bethesda.net [here](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6wzJHNfuM1wa2mGyDq62yD/fallout-76-new-items-and-sales-in-the-atomic-shop) for a preview and a full list of items included for both.
---
It would definitely be a step in the right direction but long term separating quality of life / functional skills away from the perk system would be much better and less tedious. Quality of life and crafting skills would be better permanently bound to the character and levelled through doing.
---
It needs to be done, I rarely came across random people's builds which was kinda lame since it was why I wanted t0 explore so much :p
---
I played shotguns on my second character, and it's been a lot of fun. Enforcer's crippling effect is ridiculously strong, so you can solo Whitesprings from level 30 without PA. I mix in a bit of suppressed rifle so that I don't have to yolo *all* the time, and can kill cargo bots and stuck SBs. 
---
Not sure if it'd work well in PvP because the stagger doesn't seem to proc anywhere near as often as the cripple. Also you'd chew through a lot of stealth boys closing the distance.
---
I wouldn't personally bother with a pistol build as I don't use VATS.
---
Perfect! Thank you!
---
If I have alot of strength, is raider PA less good?
---
I should have changed my phrasing. You pretty much can't have a "perfectly min-maxed build by level 50." 
---
That said you say 58 and you have a near perfect build, that's besides the point I was making. Basically, that due to the way perk card selection works, unless you get exceptionally lucky with the random packs, you can't pick cards perfectly even if you saved all your point selections until level 50.
---
I run through WS all the time (PS4) and never have an issue.
---
I can share my build if you like sometime - it‚Äôs kind of a mad bomber. What I do when no one else is around at WS is something like this ... 
---
* Run through the club house, letting the Coils tag every ghoul and get them following you
---
* Collect them all into a big mob
---
* Drop a nuke mine
---
Then do the same through the cottages, etc. but there I might use Molotovs and drag the ghouls back and forth around the cars until they blow, killing them (Nuke Mines require nuke material so I try not to use them all the time). Headshots on things that survive ... then on to next thing.
---
The flavor profile is kinda meh.
---
It may be a luxury, but spawn camping is an issue big time. Yes YOU may walk everywhere but not everyone does or feel its mandatory when we are given fast travel locations. The bare minimum we could have is immunity (I'm pretty sure we were supposed to have this but it doesnt work) till we draw our weapon or after an alloted time. Also a random spawn point too. This at least allows you to flee and sprint away from trouble so you dont get spawn camped forever. 
---
I would think that it would work like ESO and your mailbox is shared acrossed characters.
---
I have no idea. I never remember to use my vats criticals. Lol. Guess I better start if I want that weapon.
---
Reddit isn‚Äôt the answer either. 
---
Double cap drop is a condition, not a rule. There also no rule saying you can‚Äôt move your caps because of how easy it is to get killed. All it states is that you drop double, nothing about not bringing caps into the mode being frowned upon. Like I said, no debuff in place shows you they saw it the same way and that being people will often die a lot and bottom out.
---
If you're focusing on a glass cannon bloodied build there's no reason to take the life giver perk for bonus HP. I'd move 2 of those points to PER so you can have Glow Sight level 3 (and the flexibility to pick level 3 locks if desired), and maybe use the other point for one of the perks that slows armor degradation (lucky break or power patcher depending on your armor preference). 
---
Tonight! Opening night!
---
The game would never be able to handle that. If you ever used the Scrap That Swttlement mod on FO4, you can see that most texture on the ground is just a big chunk of pixels plopped down on top of a base of dirt, and that base is actually what building is based off of.
---
Next generation maybe. PS5 anyone?
---
Ahh..a purist!! You just have to find a better pairing.
---
Gotcha, thanks for answering, on Sunday I must've been lucky since almost everytime I server hopped, mods were there. Last night was the complete opposite - not a single one found after 6 attempts.
---
Oooooohhh no. There should be some kind of protection for that. 
---
Marine Tactical or Marine Combat helmet?  If it gives any DR then it isn‚Äôt the one being discussed here.  
---
Nice.  
---
Do you have strength at all?
---
Nerf everything!
---
You can attach walls to the bottom of 2nd floor tiles and then remove the floor tiles.
---
I have never had these issues happen, been playing since Feb.  PC
---
9 and can be shotgun and melee build too
---
We could actually use the perimeter fence üòÇüòÇ
---
That last point of yours is very true. 
---
Shotgun to the face all day (and wings and legs)
---
Cripple that mofo...
---
Still requires you place floor tiles everywhere, which, again, must be connected in someway to a foundation, gone are the days of placing a piece of floor on the group to make a step
---
What's your special look like then?  Didnt so perception I take it?
---
Neat. Go check my post history and comment your dumb fucking comments there. This post isn‚Äôt for debating that topic.
---
The reward should ALWAYS give your caps back, even if it fails.  
---
The problem of linking it to reward, is that if you fail the event then you don't get caps back.  And if you drop in with 30 seconds left, you are not going to win it.
---
The benefit of including it in the reward (even if you fail) is that it is NOT an incentive to abuse the event system as a free fast travel system.  You have to stay in the area until the end to get your caps back.  
---
It would totally encourage me to take part in events.  1/3 of my events fail because I traveled just to fail and lose caps.
---
Muh 20gb!
---
Cool, servers are down so send me your ign and i ll contact you when i am online
---
Believe me, having spent hundreds of hours in survival mode in FO4, I understand how tedious it is! The biggest problem with making a PVP free zone around fast travel points is there‚Äôs nothing to stop these griefers from moving back a little bit, and just waiting for you to walk out of the zone and hit you anyway. If they come up with one piece of chameleon gear, you likely wouldn‚Äôt see it coming. I don‚Äôt see any good solution to the problem, other than walking. 
---
Don't forget the neon lights
---
They anchor it to the cliff face or something. Maybe. Idk how some of those people managed to pull off what they did. Maybe they had a friend destroy the stairs! That's a thought.
---
&gt; Send pics if you try something :)
---
Unfortunately I am very happy with my camp location and spent a lot of time making everything perfect for me.
---
I would like to try other locations and designs, but that would involve either 1.) losing my existing camp, 2.) making a new character.  Neither of which I wish to do at the moment.
---
Neither of my two friends who play are all that interested in trying elaborate or fancy CAMPs either.  They have simplistic setups on resource locations, and just use mine if they want to feel fancy.
---
Nice. 
---
Regardless of how the system works, at the very minimum, it‚Äôs a second roll of RNG to get the item you want at no cost besides the item you don‚Äôt want.
---
I welcome it.
---
It effectively doubles the chance of me getting the item I want.
---
1/24000 from farming
---
Then another 
---
1/24000 from the vendor:
---
That‚Äôs one in 12,000.
---
Plus, you don‚Äôt need the exact item you want, you only need an item(s) that can be sold for the amount of caps similar to the item you want.
---
Strength: I have to assume yes. Testing this stuff is generally pretty hard without any action log telling you how much damage you did.
---
One Gun Army: I'm  unsure about this one as well, but I don't slot it because I don't see the need. You kill everything short of a Queen fast enough that limb crippling isn't that useful. On the Queen, it's better to go Enforcer with a shotgun to cripple her.
---
Twisted Muscles: I don't think it does for the shredder due to saying melee. I have seen no improvement for any perk that calls out melee weapons, so I doubt this mutation will help.
---
Other: Under the assumption that strength affects damage for the shredder (it did in FO4), I'd really recommend 15 strength and +2 from Motion Assist Servos on Power Armor. With Power Armor, you'll not want Dodgy as they're incompatible. I personally choose to only shred, and not shoot, so I wouldn't go for the better VATS crits. Those same points could be used Class Freak. I tested Stabilized and it would seem only bullets get the armor pen. It's great if you plan to shoot, but not useful otherwise.
---
We could in FO4.
---
Also, what is a good place to farm miniguns? Do the low level Supers at New Gad even drop them?
---
ACEpickles60 
---
Spot on
---
This is loooooong overdue
---
This is already true.
---
If you cripple the wings and they don't land, it's probably because they are having a difficult time finding a valid place to land, so luring them to flatter ground would help.
---
I just learned the recipe yesterday.  I'm gonna go ant hunting.  Tried yesterday without success.  The usual spots I find them were void of ants this time around.
---
Duration on booze is kind of low though.  Guess it is more of a "damn, too heavy to FT right now, gulp gulp gulp ahhhhh."
---
That‚Äôs good to know, thanks!
---
I lost 50 lbs of carry weight from a hangover.
---
Nutty, I never paid attention to those details. Well, cool challenge, actually sounds like fun.
---
I could see that being a problem, but there needs to be a way to stop these griefers from spawn camping these locations. Like I had said, none of these ideas are perfect or will completely stop these problems, but at least it‚Äôs something to help eliminate the problem.
---
You so rock
---
This is ENORMOUSLY helpful. You're pretty damn awesome to take the time out to respond. I appreciate it!
---
Square limit yes, but camps together and probably won't happen because of system limitations and building restrictions are pretty much the same, but I think it has more to do with NavMesh. Otherwise when you were attacked you could just run in your camp and the baddies wouldn't be able to process how to follow you because they wouldn't be "allowed" to walk in your house.
---
Lol ok. Somebody doesn‚Äôt know how the internet works.
---
Lvl 59 on XB1, Do you recommend me joining the SBQ event? Currently in the process of obtaining commendations for Enclave officer quest.
---
I‚Äôm usually on after 7pm eastern week days. 
---
Yeah..it's for those tight spots. So you can take your haul back to camp. Lol
---
So that everyone can come up with god roll items on day 1 and quit cause they beat the game? This game's all about looting good items since pvp is broken. I don't think taking the grind out of the game is a good idea
---
The fact it is still in beta means that we can make a logical argument for why that should not be the case.  I'm not convinced that the system is better now.  It will lead to everyone just transferring their caps and avoiding that "condition" (semantics, but fine).  The best option I've heard is to debuff the players with not enough caps.   If you died and lost all of them, I don't see why you should not be punished for failure to survive in survival mode.  It's for the greater good.  To make this "condition" mean something.  
---
You also cant transfer those to your normal base though.
---
The fences do need work, if the ground isn't perfectly flat they don't function and are ugly when they do.
---
I've made my camp all spiffy.  And been hording some plans for sale.
---
No legendary hoarding for me, as they have proven too heavy, and most are garbage anyway.  But I do have a nice Heavy Leather Leg 3*, Unyielding, +STR, -Food/Aid weight, and a couple other 2 and 3 star pieces.  Gonna see if I can successfully sell them on the vending machine.
---
I mean there‚Äôs a huge budget. It is labeled ‚Äúcamp‚Äù not permanent home. It‚Äôs meant to be portable and taken where you like. Constantly moving around from area to area is nice. Especially that it‚Äôs less buggy when you try to place it while moving.

When you take over a workshop, you leave the blueprints upon completion of the quest. It started a defense quest.

Just make crafting perks passive and always active and don‚Äôt need to be equipped.
---
My problem is sometimes my weapons don't do any damage. So I have to spend the entire time one shooting mobs
---
Just mod it in.... oh wait
---
How‚Äôs 4-4:30 today? I will be on then. After you‚Äôve had time to get home, chill, eat, breathe.....you can find me. Thanks so much! Have a great day!
---
I'm stocking up my mini nukes. To sell them of course
---
Cartoon Preston Garvey's head shows up in the corner of your screen "General, your settlement is under attack and needs your help!". Pops again 1 minute later and repeats until you go kill the two ticks attacking your shack.
---
Jug on YouTube has some pretty good guides for fudging the building system a little bit.
---
there are more passive perks than you realize...
---
Well done! I started doing the same a little while back, even deleted a level 60 for the sake of the experiment. Think I got to about level 25 before I cracked and used some perks. I was doing it slightly different though. I was avoiding any quests until 50 too lol. I actually managed the last bit and have a highest level version of all the quest rewards.
---
It's probably a long time off, but I hope so too.
---
Depends, are looking to casual, or looking to survive?
---
Do you want to defend yourself, or are you looking to deal some damage?
---
That of course is 4:00-5:00 (PST), 7 ish your time
---
They can also inadvertantly deal damage to passive npcs, like Responder Trader Bot‚Äôs Brahmin or Murgle the Tabby, which aggros as well.
---
Absolutely. The art department is sitting on a goldmine with more defensive camp features if they would implement this stuff. We need way more defensive camp items.
---
Pretty much the only progression to me is gear. I like my camp and don‚Äôt care too much about plans most of the time. Plans for weapons and armor are mostly pointless because all they are are another time/junk sink to learn mods for the real gear. Speaking of the real gear, I haven‚Äôt updated anything of mine in weeks, and THAT is why I leave sessions feeling like I wasted my time. I can only farm events or west tek so many times before I‚Äôm like ‚Äúwhy am I even doing this?‚Äù
---
As for silos, I could launch a nuke, but my character isn‚Äôt optimized for nuke zones, and my last several SBQ attempts have been disasters that accomplished nothing but eating through my resources.
---
I had plenty to do at launch too, but when I ran out of useful directed playing and just kinda started wandering around just after the new year, that‚Äôs when I can think the game didn‚Äôt have enough at launch. That‚Äôs almost eight weeks into the game at about 10 hours/week(hardly a no-lifer).
---
The more I think about it the more I feel that while a roadmap is good for 76, as it is a service game, it also let them leave us hanging on content early with the promise of filling it in later. I mean, look at the Nukashine thing. It‚Äôs not seasonal, and it‚Äôs frankly a very short quest. There‚Äôs no reason it shouldn‚Äôt have been available from launch. Now if there was enough to do already I could see them holding it back to give us a week of fresh stuff to do(which is what it did).
---
One ounce takes about 1 hour to oxidate.  The bottles weigh 1 lb vanilla.  That's 16 ounces. If we take it to 12 fl ounces to make up for the bottle,  that's 12 hours to oxidate the alcohol out of your blood stream and sober up.  5 minutes isn't 12 hours of in game time
---
Unfortunately (or fortunately) I think they are rolling out the Pacifist extending to CAMPs feature when vending drops.
---
Should be changed so that players drop randomized loot altogether, not from their inventory. 30 Caps and random aid. Still a profitable outcome.
---
Hot fix for survival mode no notes to be released
---
Agreed. Your whole goal with a sniper build is to stay hidden and take advantage of the extra damage bonus. I'd drop Evasive 3 and pop in Sneak 3. Drop Gun Fu 3, Add Escape Artist, and 2 more points to Adrenaline.
---
I know Nerd Rage is a necessity for a Bloodied Build, but a few points for Gunsmith probably wouldn't hurt. It sucks to have your guns breaking when out farming. When I'm thinking of a PVE build I'll tend to favor utility perks over more damage if I'm already one shotting most things.  
---
There was no patch. 
---
That isn't necessarily true. AP and HP go up with the corresponding SPECIAL allocation. 
---
Actually still pretty good if you were doing a vats crit build.  Hunter kinda sucks in most situations but it doesn't make or break the weapon :)
---
This. Fallout 4 explosive vent was great. 
---
Right. They fixed the issue where firing the assaultron head used every-single-fusion-cell-in-your-inventory. Unfortunately there's still a bug in which the gun does one-charge of damage no mater how much ammo you load into it.   
---
Here's the thread on the current bug:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b2q6gf/while\_the\_salvaged\_assaultron\_head\_did\_receive\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b2q6gf/while_the_salvaged_assaultron_head_did_receive_a/) 
---
This would be great.  Three times yesterday went to an event, only to have it over when I arrived.  I don't have a pokey slow PC, so the travel time wasn't an issue.  The EVENT was over, players, gone, so ???
---
VATS= master race. I run enforcer, all 3 ranks, so I cripple what I want when I want lol. Consider getting a limb damage legendary just for crippling stuff and then a different weapon to finish them off.
---
It absolutely isn‚Äôt mandatory, but neither is fast traveling. And them spawn camping isn‚Äôt any different from them going chameleon outside and waiting for you to trade with a vendor; you made a choice in the game, knew the risks going in, and have to live (or die lol) with the results. I‚Äôm not trying to sound mean, I promise, but since the servers are designed to be open PVP, it only makes since that you shouldn‚Äôt feel safe anywhere, from anything. 
---
I understand what you are saying and I completely agree that they should be passive and always active, but how does would they tie into the current perk system? They currently take up SPECIAL points and slots.
---
The Vault 76 cap has been part of my character's wardrobe for a while.  I guess it will be special soon. :)  I kind of hope we'll get another dark-colored hat to replace it though. It goes with everything, unlike the green and blue hats.
---
Increased damage to Scorchbeasts so it's okay
---
Ya, she flew away that fight too because I forgot I took enforcer off to use ammosmith üòÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è reloaded it halfway through the fight, that's why she finally landed 
---
I would agree but again that's too easily exploitable.  If we had a DM to watch us. Sure.  But otherwise people would farm their friends at their camps all day lol.  I dunno.  Maybe a way to make it work but would require more conditions.  Can't get loot from same player too often probably being one of them.
---
That was part of a mod package (of sorts) from FO4.
---
I‚Äôd spend all my atoms on vault security armor , have it look like the vault security armor from Fallout 3 but you could choose between the different vault numbers to put on the back i.e. 76,94,63 (cosmetic only obviously)
---
Most people dont use the train stations as a means to go to the vendor. If youre doing caps runs in survival through vendors, youll never make any caps. They usually use them as a means to cut the distance and save to to walk to where they want to go. 
---
I would like to think the vendor will be a timed event, such as the current system runs with the vendor cap limit. You'll  only be able to do do much trading a day, this will stop mule accounts with 100's of 3 star weapons. Guess we'll find out soon anyway 
---
Ah, hunters works on scorchbeast too?  Didn't know that
---
I believe it‚Äôs something like the dome statue. It‚Äôs for sale with Pendleton in Whitespring  
---
I would really love this too, but we don't even have a nuka cola photo frame. Don't get your hopes up :(
---
Oh ya I knew that, but like is there a hybrid pa set that gives a better median of all aspects. 51 head chest, ultracite arms, x1 legs. 
---
A cool down, per se, increases on consecutive kills on the same person.
---
Also the mirelurk king and queens. Those can get crazy.  Especially hordes of mirelurk Kings.  In this case reloading would get challenging but having that dragon for a one shot is great
---
Also that will do some work on certain PVP battles. Especially critical damage or if you use nerd rage/unyielding 
---
Where would you get them from? I suppose we could try calling people in from outside WV, but "Hey, come live here, we totally don't have Scorchbeasts now!" is a hard sell.
---
There was a hotfix. I saw it announced a few days ago somewhere 
---
Thats the Dome Sculpture, you can get it from that one Whitespring Restort robot in the back.
---
Mirelurks is Exterminator's but otherwise yeah
---
Does TS and AA on the same gun work? Genuinly curious
---
Who says the bottle is full in Fallout? maybe it's a partial but capped?
---
In theory, yes, you can move and place any building on a foundation.
---
In practice... it's hit and miss (with more misses than hits, it seems).  As the game terrain and other factors make it very difficult to place buildings built in one location, at a different location (and sometimes even the same location).
---
Well, guess it's time to finally get the patriot set seeing as it's on its way out. 
---
Hopefully, now that the Military Officer Uniform is leaving we'll be able to get the "Military Intel Officer" uniform sometime soon. That beret, I need it.
---
Well, servers are usually really really good right after maintenance.
---
I like the lunch box idea it‚Äôs actually brilliant. It would also be cool to have one to display as a stash box too in your camp. 
---
As for people having a hard time locating brown bags well if it‚Äôs YOUR bag it has mark already on it telling you too pick up your loot.. no no y‚Äôall are talking about locating OTHERS bags to steal the crap from them lol 
---
There are some buildings that can be camped in already.  
---
Yeah, just the only problem is that the "risk" and sense of "danger" goes away with this.   But at least it would be more balanced.   I'm not sure what I would prefer.  Lol
---
I know I will be 30+ pounds lighter after putting the fusion cores for sell.....plus other ammo.
---
I was hoping it would keep the blueprints. I know trying to replace it again is a pain in the ass at times.
---
It would be nice if you could hide them, especially when you have the max rank or aren't interested in many of them.  You never know what you may / may not want to do later.  But if you have 3/3 or 5/5, that extra doesn't need to make an appearance if we could hide it.  
---
90sMemelord is grushnak 
---
It would be cool if there was a Faction Survival Mode. Beyond just having items but being passive to those declaring loyalty to the same faction. The default could be Vault 76.
---
You never once said that. You just kept repeating that the person being griefed should just leave, and if they don't then tough shit essentially. Nor did you recognize the broken system. You are doing that now, after the fact, after I make an analogy that must have finally made the concept understandable for you. 
---
It's not being defensive, it's just aggravating when people try to say the correct solution is that the person trying to just enjoy the game should have to change what they are doing it because someone else has mommy issues and wants to ruin someone else's experience.
---
90smemelord is grushnak
---
You're not going to find anything "godly" at that level, but you can find level 10 legendaries.
---
* Fertile Soil - takes less than 3 minutes, gives you ~250XP (plus whatever you get from the mobs), and there's a small chance of getting a leveled legendary item
---
* Powering Up Poseidon - takes about 20 minutes once you figure out the layout of the plant. Collect and scrap everything from the scorched inside and you should learn enough mods to make a fairly decent hunting rifle after a couple runs. Completion also awards plans for the different generators (and random camp items once you've unlocked all  the gens), and a small chance of a legendary item. While you're there, head up to the roof and look for the small trailer/building to find a level 10 hazmat suit. This will allow you to tag along in the nuke zones with your friends and tag enemies for easy XP.  
---
* Leader of the Pack - Track down 3 packs of wolves, each of which is led by a level 10 legendary wolf.
---
If any of your friends have completed the BOS questline they can craft you a BOS recon rifle, which is basically a hunting rifle with all the best mods. They may also be able to craft/upgrade a set of underarmor that may give you a boost to STR and/or other stats.
---
If you can find a power armor frame you can strip off the parts and use the raw frame regardless of your level. It won't offer a ton of protection, but it'll boost your STR to 11 and make you immune to fall damage. Finding fusion core spawns at your level can be tricky, but odds are good that your high level friends have a few they'll give or sell you. If not, you can buy them on the trading sub for 75-100 caps each.
---
If you have excess steel and aluminum you can go to any place with a vertibot landing pad, use 8 of each to repair the vertibot, and then kill it for ~150XP. This can be exploited over and over again as long as you have the mats to repair the launch pad.
---
How did you farm for this explosive effect weapon? I always almost end up getting 3\* weapons but none of them with Explosive damage :( 
---
Thank you kind sir. Will do
---
Ballistic Bock though....
---
\+15% damage can be HUGE 
---
I think it comes down to situational use.
---
Great.... Until you were in your settlement a floor or two above a cat or a settler you didn't notice. 
---
The two best things I've looted is a TS Dragon, and TS blackpowder pistol. I'm level 161.
---
This aint GTA 5
---
Yes, when you move your CAMP your buildings on foundations get stored together as a blueprint.  Even if you did not save any blueprints yourself.
---
You can then attempt to place the building, and if unable to find a suitable spot, you can scrap the blueprint and all the items will be placed in storage for you to manually place or scrap yourself.
---
I agree comrade! We should be able to show our party pride!
---
Oh okay. Makes sense. What language?
---
What camp items do you all consider nuka cola products? 
---
I've got all 6 light posters,cola machine,quantum sign, string lights (solid version also projects nuka cola), stash box and clock. But I also personally consider the red and white dining chairs to be of nuka branding too.
---

I was farming the Civil War Hat the other day and realised that when you find the Civil War renactor you can actually just not loot if he doesnt have the plan you want and then join into same server again to get a different one (I have acces to 2 accounts, but can be done with a friend too)
---
This makes getting all the plans A WHOLE LOT EASIER if you dont mind the "exploiting" ;)
---
How are they expensive? Lol I don't understand....
---
Range wins every time. I'm retiring my vats crit pistol build. It's great fun but you'll drain fusion cores in power armor and in PvP you'll get hosed by anyone with an automatic smg or rifle. It's super fun for PvE and very ammo efficient. This is just my experience so maybe your build is better? I was pure luck, Agi and perception. 
---
Nope they are two different main prefixes. You can have one or the other only.
---
I'm hoping that they add perk card selling to player vending.
---
Yup, as a long time Mechwarrior fan I love using the jetpack and explosive vents and pretending I am a Highlander Battlemech. Also blowing dudes up with explosive ground pounds is just bad ass. I would give my left (calibrated) leg for a working explosive vent. 
---
Thanks guys.  
---
CAMP building has so much promise especially with an online aspect but the way it's been put into play it has many faults especially when it comes to the walls imo after all the up and coming dlcs in the near future Bethesda needs to make a patch based strictly around the CAMP system for a person like me who loved the building aspect of fallout 4 and now 76 it really makes the game frustrating at times with what limits you have with it
---
The last time I attempted to put Tech Data in my Stash, it disappeared after I grabbed up Tech Data during a subsequent search mission.  At least I think that what happened because I ended up with a single Tech Data in inventory and none in Stash.  In any case, I'm more concerned about unexpected/unpredictable events like this still happening after 7 + major patches.
---
So it disappears until you change guns? Yeah, very odd bug.
---
Reminds me of this time I did the fasnacht parade like a hundred times and got nothing but soldier masks and disappointment.
---
Unfortunately?
---
Correction you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about you‚Äôre bitching about prices that have been the same if not higher in the past. We all get shit drops. But if you GRIND (something apparently no one knows how to do) you will get good drops. Bottom line get good scrub. 
---
Thisthreadhurtsmycranium
---
Thanks for the answer,  that's what I was afraid of. I recently made my way to the fort and unknowingly triggered the dropbox, where all 60+ tech data I had ever collected went poof  since they were all stored on my character. 
---
Per my understanding they have a zero percent chance to drop, proved by datamining.  
---
What if the weight is attached to your stash, like with the fermenter?
---
I get that. Totally. I'm  always hoarding or selling stuff
---
=O
---
Oh, you don't mean a "building built on foundations" but a "building built of foundations".  That wasn't as clear.
---
I never build a foundation bunker.  So I guess I don't know if you can place them after the patch or not.  I definitely wouldn't assume yes if I had a camp made of foundations I wanted to keep either.
---
Please allow for repair perks to not count towards limit. I hate switching perk cards every time I repair something.
---
Smells awfully Commie up in here.
---
I fully support this game mechanic, though - I would like to see more options to accessorize, and it would make it easier to ID any surviving commies in Appalachia.
---
I would just love to hang a BOS shield/coat of arms behind my PA station.  The whole of my building is garage walls set to permanent open. I am drooling just little thinking of the sunset behind the giant satellite dish as I mod my BOS IV T-60 with matching decor.
---
That would be cool.  
---
Sure, but it isn't like you can't be a powerhouse 99% of the time until you see a locked safe, at which point you swap cards for 20 seconds.  I want the builds to stay and the consequences of the special points, but not the inconvience of swapping utility cards.  Loadouts with a cool down or that can't be swapped in combat would be best imho.
---
I can see how it would, but depending on the cool down time if implemented, I doubt people are not gonna hunt after you still. Maybe place a bigger price on those on the leaderboard? Up to like 150 for first, 120 for second, 90 for third. I personally hate the leaderboard, but at least that should increase the risk of a headhunter after the top three. 
---
If they decide to add all the building parts from fallout 4 it could even be a DLC on it's own.
---
Oh yeah, I got ganked one time trying to use a vendor when I first jumped into survival, and that was the last time I used one! And I‚Äôm sympathetic to the people that only get 1-2 hours to log in per day/week. But there has to be some risk to fast travel for the reward of not dying in order to cover vast distances instantly. Maybe having random spawns around the station would be a solution, but I can still imagine people just stealthed-out, waiting to see movement and tagging you with an OP rifle. I don‚Äôt know that there is a good solution that doesn‚Äôt diminish the open PVP-ness of survival. 
---
Have you tried making it a blueprint, then placing the blueprinted building? You should be able to test it without moving your camp
---
You could have it say something like "Started: 23:41 remaining" or "Not Started: 15:23 remaining" so you would have a good idea if it's worth the caps 
---
Yeah I don't like the leaderboard either.   I just wanted to get rid of slap damage in the game, but here we are with a new server as compromise lol.
---
It was a comment made in jest for the person who wants to ~~nuke other's camps~~ innocently sell mini nukes at their camp.
---
Always active and don‚Äôt need to be equipped is what they should be changed to.
---
Hello. So yes someone did do some of their own testing out up some numbers based on their results. Just search for it. I read it on reddit. The take away I got was it does stack. And all in all, powered gear plus perks gets maxed AP filled from 0 in under 3 secs.
---
Also hate to hi jack this, but when will the range and accuracy stats of crafted black powder rifles and looted/legendary black powder rifles march each other? The difference in the 2 is significant. Crafted range is 395 while the looted is 204. 
---
Today I managed to pick up a grand total of three 1* pieces of amour.  A waste of an hour‚Äôs gaming.  Still popped them into the ice cooler at the golf club though.
---
It was only implemented on individuals with a WANTED status. So someone who was destroying camps, killing someone who wasn't engaged, etc. Except that the debuff was only if you didn't have caps to cover your bounty. So this implies someone to be destroying camps, and other nefarious acts over and over, AKA harassment. If you were playing normally, and even raiding other players camps and workshops, you still would more have caps to cover it regardless. Especially since it started at 10 and went up the more you did. You would have to be actively trying to lose all your caps and obtain bounties by harassing people.
---
I agree with lockpicking not being one card, but I really like the hands idea. Preset skill combinations that we can select, maybe on the side of the perk screen. We have blueprints for camps, why not blueprints for skills?
---
Hmmm.... I got a bloodied one that goes all the way up to 400+ damage. I wonder how it would be like then with perks (when they work)
---
Shotgun loses on range and rate of fire. A western revolver can pop headshot crits way more than a shotgun. Blackpowder pistol with reloading +250 Damage resistance and reload speed +25%  means your dead if your holding anything less than an automatic.
---
On PC I find holding the power button for 4 seconds does the trick then get beers üòÄ
---
It will be.  Most definitely.  But he's assuming people will buy his fusion cores so they won't be there anymore.
---
That said, fusion cores aren't very rare, and unless they are priced really cheap I don't see them being hot items.
---
How does the insult bot work? I'm fairly new to the game and seen it at that mall/golf course. Only thing I know about it is that it made my player get injured so I couldn't run
---
LOL
---
So you put 3 points in agility? And you have all mutations? Do you have class freak? How long can you sprint before you run out of AP? I‚Äôll bet you just don‚Äôt have enough AP. There‚Äôs at least one mutation that reduces Agi (and thus AP) by 4; there‚Äôs another that reduces AP by 50. With only 3 agi baseline, you wouldn‚Äôt have enough AP after your mutations to do VATS shots/power attacks. 
---
As I said, you can see the actual numeric AP value in your pip-boy from the SPECIAL screen, it‚Äôs in the lower right. 
---
I'd suggest every crafting/hacking/lock picking card has a stat requirement: like 3 int for master hacker. If you have the intelligence, the card is always active. Expert Hacker requires 2 int and hacker works for everyone. 3 int means all hacking cards are working.      
---
This way builds don't have to change and we don't have to keep opening menus to swap cards.
---
I would say you have a face  that only a mother could love.  But your whole family is dead.  Contacting burn unit.
---
Now PVE sure, but in pvp engagements are quick and decisive. Specialization is key
---
Same... in the end changes will be made, and in certain not everyone will be pleased.
---
Hello what platform are you on? I‚Äôve been looking for unyielding gear with FDC weight reduction effect. Care to sell it to me if on PS4? Thank you.
---
The next update as in 4/9 or the update after that?
---
Worked in WOW.  Why not here.
---
Definitely a reasonable price, glad to hear this!
---
Sounds good Lord, I'll take a look at them.
---
I feel like there isn‚Äôt enough budget to build stuff? I‚Äôm on PS4, is there a limit or something 
---
It doesn't make you sacrifice anything. You can swap cards in and out to do everything in this game. The problem is swapping in and out the cards constantly is repetitive and tedious.
---
It's just a random encounter like the GAS Prize bot.  It follows you and says an insult or two.  Then you shoot it and get some steel, lead, or aluminum.
---
Yes! There are a lot of ways to contribute to taking her down, even if your build isn't geared for PVE damage. Using an endangerol syringer, cryolater, grenades, or helping to take down the mobs around her so others can focus on the queen are all great. There are a lot of factors that go into succeeding or failing the event. Everyone has a different opinion on what level you should be, or what build you should have before taking down the queen. As long as people contribute in some way, that's the biggest thing to me. My XB1 gamertag is megalornn if you want to add me. I am on often and would love to team up whenever you want to do the event! 
---
Got ya
---
I'd  like to think it won't be a instant gratification deal, there will most likely be a randomized part in what you receive. Trade in 3 1 star Grognak axes for 1 3 star (or to make it a possibly hard on the player's psyche 3 3 star weapons) where you may be after the deal, carrying a weapon that is only marginally better than what you started with.
---
Is there some trick to Grognak's Axe?  You can't over-repair it, so it seems like it would be naturally inferior to the Super Sledge and Sledgehammer.
---
If you have atleast one weapon class that you have damage perks for, or can atleast keep the mobs off of the players killing the SBQ. Before I had my damage sorted out that's what I would do, kill the adds so the other guys could focus on the boss.
---
Then I will be Fucked...hopefully it wont be or I will have to start selling my Legendaries and dropping some of the ammo around places........BUT I can still get my carry weight down to 190 with all the weight reduction perks....
---
Last night I stumbled into Mr. Messenger, and he just stood around at the spawn for 10-15 minutes. He eventually got moving, and the message was delivered, but I could have been doing a lot more during that time than staring at confused robot.
---
Maintenance is now complete and you should once again be able to log into Fallout 76. During downtime, we released a hotfix to address an issue that could cause the game client to crash, as well as an issue that could prevent the brief period¬†invulnerability from being applied to Survival Beta characters after Fast Traveling or Respawning under certain circumstances. Thank you for your patience during maintenance today!
---
I have 2k also, never had to craft it either lol
---
Oh, I need to find the chairs. I have the stash box,  and the quantum sign as well. But like regular posters, red and white floor tiles. The Nuka Cola lamp. The Nuka Cola Trucks...
---
Yup, my tv over scans and i just switched it this way last year.
---
They tryed this with a creation club item but it was just riddled with bugs some game braking.
---
are u sure..they are not scorched??? serious question
---
I just responded to another reply with this, but I don‚Äôt know that there is a solution that balances the risks/rewards of fast travel. All the while maintaining the openness of PVP in survival. It sucks, I hate griefers as much as everyone else, but this is the mode they, and we, have wanted for them from the beginning. Whatever gets implemented to try and stop them, they‚Äôll find a way around it. Happens every time. 
---
Players could be incentivized to keep playing after level 50 by getting new loadout slots every 10-20 levels or so. Even if we had a max of 5 one could be dedicated to crafting and 4 to combat and loadouts/perks would be better than they are now. 
---
I‚Äôd had thought each time a new world starts it‚Äôs from a fresh image. 
---
Do people think these servers are running for long periods of time and get bogged down with system logs? Thus require ‚Äòmaintenance‚Äô periodically.
---
It's down in the wiki that hunter's affects them
---
I have a similar level of experience, but WADR my reaction is exactly the opposite. I am more fine with locking in skills then I am with the constant swapping (and annoying forgetting to in-swap).
---
I can see where folks less focused on the role playing are comfortable with the swapping, but it makes no sense that I magically forget and then ‚Äúremember‚Äù a skill like lockpicking.
---
Make the perks permanent and make the swappable perks item related. So instead of swapping in my rifleman I have a better rifle that has some perk associated.
---
It makes more sense that I‚Äôd swap items with advantages than skills.
---
I really feel that Bethesda looked around and said ‚ÄúWow! Look at people buying Fortnite skins! Look at mobile app card games!  Lets jam that stuff into a Fallout game!‚Äù 
---
Walking distance traveled, and level of mobs and player level. Try it , thank me later.
---
Server is up.
---
I'll give that a try 
---
I dont think it should give you all the caps because it would be difficult to determine what to give you back. Do you have the travel agent perk, did you travel from watoga to wavy Willard's, did you just travel to a friend and he paid the cap cost? Too much to determine. The game needs a risk and reward system and if you used 21 caps knowing you'll only get 20 back but theres a chance for a legendary, it's worth it. If not then that's your prerogative on whether you go it not. 
---
thx bruh..i was using zealots guns against them lolol
---
That gun is so efficient, the bullets are just steel. The Tesla rifle and railway rifle are both really fun to use and i really wish they both got some love. Good post!
---
It's a mechanic. There are real issues in the game that need addressed, this is just a "I'm lazy" request lol.
---
Imo, we need more West-Tek-style dungeons scattered throughout the world that scale aggressively to whoever is there.  That way, low-level players who are just traveling the overworld won't be subjected to impossible enemies, and high-levels have an incentive to visit places like Toxic Valley and the Ash Heap.
---
I would be surprised if it didn't fall under the category of rifle, it has it in the name, and its specs are similar to other rifles so I would assume based on logic that it will benefit from rifle perks, but who knows. 
---
Unverified by any source that I‚Äôve seen, and I‚Äôm highly skeptical. I‚Äôm going to be testing it soon, once I‚Äôve got a decent amount of playtime to work with. 
---
But do the letters snap? I need my letters to line up perfectly or I‚Äôll poke my eyes out with a legendary railway spike üëÄ
---
You have a limited amount of perk available, so taking perks just to cripple SB is not a priority...
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/home/
---
Ooh is that the spare loot collection point? I've been leaving mine in the Whitesprings Station cash register.
---
A step in the right direction but what about other crafting cards? Remember there's a lot of cards to swap in and out when crafting. Separate cards for the following;
---
\- Super Duper
---
\- 200% Weapon Repairs
---
\- 200% Armour repirs
---
\- Cheaper Armour Repairs
---
\- Ammo Smithing
---
\- Cheaper PA repairs
---
\- Base defences
---
\- Weapon crafting + Mods
---
\- armour crafting + mods
---
And that's not even the lot. That's a heck of a lot of cards to micromanage at base. As if micromanaging our inventories isn't time consuming enough!  :-)
---
Make sure you take hunter's armor too, that might be easier to check
---
You can make the assumption that they held back content the should have come sooner, but it is just that an assumption. (even if it is a safe one give the way companies act) But as far as the game at launch (ignoring bugs and such since different people had different experiences there) I cant really think of much that was "promised" but not delivered on. about the only real complaint I can see is the lack of tools to interact with friends/teammates outside of voice chat. To me (and this is my assumption) they were building the game either with consoles in mind first, or with the idea that cross-play would come in at some point. (most likely the former)
---
Treadmill games (i refuse the term live service) always drip feed content. for example WoW pretty much sold and expansion in aug on the idea of a specific allied race, but it was only in the last patch (8.1.5) that race became available, about the same time fo76 got brewing. fo76 on the other hand never made mention of making booze until the patch was coming to release. a short quest? yep, but rather than loading everything up and having people burn through it is a weeks time that are drip feeding the content so the "patch" only finishes when the next is set to go.
---
It is a concept even jim sterling has said consoles should use rather than loading up all the games on launch day and having a drought drip feed the releases.
---
And since you are focused on gear its not surprising that you have hit the treadmill portion of the game faster. frankly outside of the legendary vender, I dont see your treadmill going anywhere. maybe some of the new questline will be long enough or fun enough to distract from it, but since that is your main focus you will just be right back once it is done.
---
Maybe you keep coming back because you like randomly wondering in the world while you look for your gear. perhaps you enjoy the exploration aspect more than you think?
---
In the end though everyone gets bored with a game no matter how fun it is, if not we wouldn't buy new ones. sorry if my rambling makes no sense. I hope you didn;t get a headache from it. XD
---
yeah i had a ton of dragons before..and..about 30 mins before me getting this i got an instigating dragon (1 star) ..i got 3 two shot dragons (non-explosive)..its like these things follow me and i dont even use them
---
These are just software updates. Bethesda uses amazon cloud servers, which mean they don't (or shouldn't) have to deal with the hardware.
---
Unfortunately the problem with huge software projects, like fo76, is that whenever you add new code (=every new update) you're also adding new bugs. According to a quick google search the industry average is about 15 ‚Äì 50 errors per 1000 lines of delivered code. 
---
The only way to get rid of ALL the bugs in this game would be to completely stop adding new content for a very long time and only focus on existing bugs. And even then, once you start adding new content again, you're also going to be adding new bugs. So there's always going to be maintenance.
---
Right now tho the game is just getting a hotfix aimed to fix client crashes and respawn protection in survival mode. This shouldn't introduce new bugs, but then again the last hotfix I remember them doing (rad worms) messed up ALL your mutations whenever you got that disease (and that new bug stayed in place for weeks). So even on these small hotfixes its still not a sure thing we're actually going to be better off.
---
Fun fact that extra mining dont need excavator arms but torso, I was surprised when discovering this today
---
Eh I wouldn‚Äôt call that a patch. I didn‚Äôt have to download anything. üòõ
---
I am hoping it‚Äôs optional because I have no plans of resetting my character even if the perk is invincibility and I shoot laser beams out of my eyes and fire out my butt. 
---
What wiki, and from what evidence? I‚Äôve personally verified that Zealots weapons affect scorchbeast; I‚Äôll be testing Hunters soon because I‚Äôve been hearing this rumor but don‚Äôt believe it. I just need a decent chunk of playtime to work with. 
---
This is brilliant
---
I agree. Hotfix and patch is two different definitions. 
---
Yeah it's not an exploit.  Nowhere close.   
---
i dont support foundation built buildings
---
I want to be able to hang the propaganda posters
---
Sort of definitely needs to be worked on, there is a ‚Äúsnap into place‚Äù but is definitely problematic I had letters occupy the same space 
---
It comes down to this plain and simple. In the wasteland, you kill someone, obviously you can take all of their money and belongings. People also don't have to carry money. It's beyond ridiculous to make it mandatory. If someone dies and they have nothing to take. That's your own shitty luck.
---
Brotherhood wasn‚Äôt a huge force in 76, just yet but a few extra goodies would be nice. What I really would like to see is more US Military prevalent content. The US was attacked and you see military presence in a lot of places yet we can‚Äôt use that stuff to build with. I‚Äôm sure Bethesda has a lot of ideas for the future content but they keep releasing STUPID outfits instead of more post apocalyptic looking stuff. 
---
Imagine a worn pair of jeans, OD green Army jacket unzipped revealing a Dark flannel colored under shirt with some sort of scavenged plate carrier ‚Äúof course done according to the era‚Äù. This one of many ideas for clothing. 
---
Instead Bethesda leans towards crazy and ridicules looking stuff only an escaped mental patient would like to wear. 
---
Keep some of that but let‚Äôs get some normal people/more tactical minded individuals some outfits that match us in there. 
---
This has probably been said before I just get on a rant sometimes. 
---
Would be nice to mix and match all the clothing in the game down to gloves/boots/scarves. 
---
I‚Äôve personally verified Zealots works on them. I‚Äôve heard the rumors about Hunters but I believe they‚Äôre just rumors. I‚Äôll be testing Hunters on SB soon though, to put that to rest. 
---
I still try to press B to exit containers occasionally, a hangover from 3. I did it on 4 and still do it now. Muscle memory is a bitch 
---
SAME. I want my husband to play the game with me so badly. He loves The Elder Scrolls, but says Fallout isn‚Äôt as fun? Wut. 
---
&gt; Given a system where I can swap, i will swap. 
---
Everyone will which is why the system we have is so irritating: you feel compelled to swap to optimize for the task at hand. 
---
&gt; I just think that diminishes the uniqueness or flavor of each character.
---
I agree and share the unpopular opinion that perks should be locked in like the old games, but in addition to making a lot of "quality of life" stuff available to us always. 
---
I like the idea of sharing perks in multiplayer, though--maybe characters have some slots that are filled with party members' cards. 
---
Consider sending a message first. I'm set up for solo play, give me a reason to change MY perks.
---
I actually tried doing this and got to level 14. I got tired of getting destroyed by scorchbeasts and having infant-like stamina. 
---
Please tell me where these plans are available for 1k??
---
oh and on my main character (whom i barely use now) i did find a ghoul slayer's 10mm with explosive effect..a long time ago..but doesnt feel as good as getting it as a drop
---
I like the idea although caps sound better than atoms and would see a lot more use. I would send it to people on my friends list every time I was on their server. It would give all the maxxed out cap players something amusing to do with a few.
---
You want people to be punished who are playing smart, or who have actually nothing to their name, just because you think it's unfair for someone to take the loads of caps, you probably insist on carrying, from your dead corpse.
---
I doubt it. I‚Äôve heard the rumors, but it seems unlikely to me (Zealots definitely works on them; where else does anything fall in 2 categories?)
---
Have the cap limits been raised ? Ooo
---
I‚Äôve heard of a a few drop off points in an around whitesprings.  I guess having more than one would make sense.   Now and again I‚Äôve swung past the cooler later and noticed that people have picked some of the stuff up.  Weapons go quicker than the wooden armor.  No surprise there I guess üòÇ
---
Lying Lowe isnt until next week (4/9)
---
I would use this so much haha
---
&gt;If you‚Äôre implying the mode was strictly made for hunting down and farming people for caps, you‚Äôre wrong.
---
This right here. Have an upvote.
---
I just don't think this is a valid argument. You think they can't path if the CAMP is a square instead of a circle? You think they can't path floors, just because it's "second story" floor verses foundation pieces?
---
I get not allowing "floating" buildings with no connection to the ground, but that's not what the OP seems to be wanting. 
---
As for system limits, are you referring to Bethesda's servers, or like xbox hardware? Cause Bethesda should get better hardware if they can't handle like 4 camps within a mile of each other. 
---
Smarter fencing would be great,  you can‚Äôt put down more than 3 fence sections without running out of flat ground.
---
My small letters and numbers have no snap and it drives me crazy trying to line them up, but probably they decided to give placement flexibility.
---
You mean just dropping in a mail box? Sure they could, it seems that is what they are doing with vendors after all, but I was suggesting a way to insert it in a more interesting way.
---
Ouch. Level 60 myself and all my decent stuff has been bought from the market subreddits. 
---
Only saw this on it:

 "hotfix to address an issue that could cause the game client to crash, as well as an issue that could prevent the brief period¬†invulnerability from being applied to Survival Beta characters after Fast Traveling or Respawning under certain circumstances. "

&gt;Perk Loadout Manager
---
It was also broken by an update a while back and now you have to build the loadouts on Nukes and Dragons site and set up the config file to use it.  It's a real pain compared to the in-game functionality it used to have.  
---
Found mine on market76 generally you see them from 1500-3000

I legitimately cannot tell if the update is live or not

There's a big difference between exploration/discovery of the game environment and builds and exploration/discovery of game mechanics. Stuff like this and things like weight reduction cards not applying to your stash really need more explanation.
---
That Mongrel hoard has usually killed a radstag that is on the side of the road and has meat if someone didn't already grab it and sometimes right up the hill from there you will get a small herd.

I‚Äôll still be at work selling toys. But ya whenever you see Elvis Anger on just give me a yell. I make them pretty often. The other helmets are much harder to make.

I'm not sure the chairs are actually nuka brand but they are close enough in colour. What nuka junk items are in the game? Once we can place junk items we'll have to expand our collections.
---
Also what platform you on? I've got the posters,machine and chair plans if you want them?
---
As far as lock picking or hacking goes, just remove the barriers entirely. If you can pick the lock, then you can pick it; same with hacking a terminal. Just give different difficulty descriptors, as in ESO. 
---
I think "decks" are a suitable alternative but only with one other "deck " rather than having an infinite set of load outs.

So much love!!!

It does warn you with a pop up about it being a hostile action against the owner when you start to pick the lock.  (Upper left corner)
---
It's annoying, but ultimately harmless, and now you know.
---
Run with them.
---
Thanks for the reply! I've been sifting through a bunch of old posts and figured people may have tested a bit more or perks may have been adjusted.  
---
Hoping with Survival mode that there would b a bit more testing now that everyone wants it.
---
They stack, but seemingly multiplicatively- like armor piercing, the more you have, the less effective each is. My takeaway from the guy‚Äôs testing was one piece of AP refresh gear was a huge boost, 2 was still a pretty good upgrade, 3 or more started to be much less noticeable. So I‚Äôd aim for at least 1 piece, probably 2 if you‚Äôre a heavy AP user, and then maybe get other secondaries after that (at least 1 poison resist is a really good idea in PVE against radscorpions/mirelurk queen/kings)
---
If it's casual, isn't that shielded plan "learned" not dropped and available by completing or getting all the overseer's caches? Upon accessing the last cache you should see the message "Shielded learned" and it should apply to casual under armor.... so I believe that's working as designed and not actually bugged.
---
I wish they were like fridge magnets where any player could move them around and leave messages, I mean I know it would end up being bad but having say an option to lock or unlock that function would be fun to give us more interaction 
---
I don't have any problem with damage output. My goal is to have the best survivability I can while still being able to one-shot most enemies. If I can kill everything without having to stay around 15-20% health, then I would prefer not be so close to death all the time. Currently, I use a bloodied meat hook with extra hooks and stay around 60-90% health. One of the only enemies that I have to put extra effort in to kill, aside from Scorchbeasts which I avoid, is the Mirelurk Queen - with everything dialed in I can kill them in one hit and take no damage.
---
Screen?
---
Yeah, I'd assume rifle too, but who knows. Some weapons seem to have more than one type even. I guess we'll find out soon enough though! Once it is fixed I can go back to working on my choo choo train build.
---
Well duh, I already did. They just explode into tiny pieces all over and you can never find them to get loot.

yes screen?
---
Yeah ive seen them but it would be nice to not have to glitch to get a floor on the ground you know, just silly little things that should be allowed
---
It says before you kill them they are carrying zero caps.  Imagine being level 230 with no caps.  Cheating the system 
---
Thanks, it's not a big one but it it worked again after I thought it was just a glitch but it's not. Thanks!

You don't have to, the foundations support them.

Oooh can't wait to get some of these deals when I get home! Was wanting that Bomber Jacket being the technical data has never graced me with one.

You either buy it or never see it.

I wanna know! Too bad they aren't posting any patch notes.. I hope if it was raised that they don;t go back and lower it again (losing people caps)

Woot thanks for the Gold!

Unless you have a bug while using class freak or strange in numbers with the healing factor mutation while drinking  nuka cola, then yes this is a bug.

Blessed day for my railway rifle
---
Whatever you do. Don't do it. They allowed me to keep one. The other fell upon a no build zone. When I moved the no build zone camp instead of it placing the whole camp down, it was split into sections. The floor foundation. The walls, the roof all separated and wouldn't connect. Can't stack anymore so it was useless. I'm so fortunate I had a way into my first in because I couldn't remove a block and replace like before that update. If you like it as much as I do. Just keep it. Make a new character and do another base. Don't loose that one because you won't get it back. The reason they are the best is no one wants to spend there entire time playing constinantly fixing there base. Sometimes you want to be antisocial and it's a great base for that. I don't want to always interact with other players. Just becuase you keep throwing up the trade bubble doesn't mean I want to trade. But because I wouldn't trade then they gotta be a douche and start destroying my camp. Happened about 20 times and I said enough of this. Paid my friend to make the bunker.
---
I gave that a go, it switched between Wide, wide fit and full. Full was the best I could get but unfortunately that‚Äôs what it was already set. Thanks for trying to help though!
---
/u/valseek did they up the CAPS limit on purpose or by accident? I've seen quite a few posts on this. Will it go back to normal, or be permanent? What's the new limit?
---
The one I'm using on my alt I recently found, bloodied and increased vat hit chance.  It's pretty nice. 
---
I like the idea of pen and stagger cards for pistols. Crit is the main way to bypass armor at the moment. I think moving the pistol perk cards to a different tree would help seeing as they benefit from critical, vats, and sneak cards.
---
The weird thing is that this warning doesn't apply correctly on a consistent basis (e.g., I've seen it pop up on drops that I've called in myself as well as the warning popping up and then no penalty being applied when I open the container). It makes it very confusing.
---
Vendor sells them for something like 9800. You‚Äôre best bet is to buy/trade with another player. I traded a BOS bomber jacket, 3k rounds of 5.56 ammo and 1.5k caps for mine on Xbox. 
---
They should occur more often and be actually dangerous. 
---
Pics or it didn‚Äôt happen
---
I don't think its gonna reset anything except level.
---
I would love more building stuff.

However, there are still other creative ways to build a full "fort." My advice is don't use tall stone walls (defenses category) because they take a LOT of budget.  If you use building foundations, you can put concrete or metal walls on those for much cheaper.  Also I don't know if you've noticed but you can use the defense category metal stairs thing (forget its name) and its counterpart without stairs to create an outer barrier, because you can attach building walls to those.  I like to use pressure plates and one of those powered doors for the outer wall.  Screen or two to follow for examples. :)

I killed 3 or 4 scorchbeasts this week and they were all near Fissure Site Prime, so I think a flat place is not the real case. Maybe I'm not doing enough damage, I'm pretty underleveled for the area. Anyway, your advice was great, i'll keep that in mind, thanks!
---
It comes out next week. 
---
It can mean anything. That all servers go offline can mean that they need to do something in the server room or put updates on all servers. Usualy when only one (phisical) server is affected, they can take this offline and do everything. I don't know how many gameservers are on one phisical server but when too many are affected, this can mean that they shutdown everything, so the others don't get to full.  
---
With bugs: that doesn't work that way (sadly). You will always find bugs or security holes. Programming can get very complex and finding everything is extremly hard. The game recives updates, so more bugs can occure. There will be always a person or unique hardware setup, that can cause bugs. Sometimes it's very strange and you can't explain why this happend. Sure when you have endless time and endless money, they can fix everything but this is not realistic. Somethimes developers must implement a hotfix for a certain bug but the hotfix is not clean and can make this part slow. Its better than having that bug but it's not perfect. 
---
I have plenty of those drop tapes. sometimes I will use them and kill anyone that opens it. 
---
I had everything on my person and it's still not working. 
---
yeah..i mean when they spawn the also spawn scorched..and they are literally called scorch beasts..they are not regular animals..IMO
---
Here's my simple proposal for improving the Perk Card system:
---
1)  Allow us to LOCK our favorite cards in place
---
2)  If you select a card to swap in, the game will automatically unequip a number of UNLOCKED cards to make room for the new thing
---
I think that would save a lot of headaches for Hot Swap situations like Lockpicking, Hacking, and Starched Genes.
---
I didn't know that, thanks for the heads up! Maybe I'm not doing enough damage to cripple them, I'll look into it
---
Hilarious...
---
I agree, but Bethesda probably should do something better to enforce it. As is, it is easy to get around so people do. And then get bothered when it is a PITA to get around (they miss the point that it's not supposed to be like that). I honestly liked some one's solution that you could only change card loadouts at your camp (or maybe to be a little more flexible at train stations). That way you had to at least choose what you wanted before you left but still had some flexibility like what Behtesda originally envisioned. It wouldn't solve the perks though involved with crafting as people could still just move those in and out at their camps. But maybe it would limit last minute crafting ulness you wanted your character to be able to do that.
---
There was a patch lmao 
---
The hangover of -50 carry weight makes me throughly despise this recipe.
---
I had everything in my inventory this time and I'm still getting the same message.
---
I would trust your answer if you weren‚Äôt named ‚ÄúVerballyInsultingBot.‚Äù    But as it stands I have deep concerns you are just raising my hopes so that the crash will be all the harder.  
---
with explosive???? wow!!!
---
Yeah this would be really nice. I've wanted it since I realized how much of a PITA it is to move camps. 
---
I came across 4 of them along the road around there once.
---
 By what possible metric is this "huge". Compared to fallout 4, it's smaller in area, and in build limit, than the smallest settlement. 
---
Given the fact that we were promised "rebuilding Apalachia" And we got this...sad joke of a stripped down settlement system? No. 
---
I‚Äôve never once seen a two shot railway rifle. Not in game or even on the market. I‚Äôm inclined to believe it can‚Äôt have the prefix at this point. 
---
I have a prime AA one and instigating. Right now I find instigating better provided I go for sneak attacks. It falls short on beefy enemies who I can‚Äôt one shot kill though. I‚Äôm hopeful the AA one will pack more punch with some perks. 
---
It's too change to a "level by doing" system without a player wipe imo.  
---
That said I 1000% agree that non combat qol perks deserve their own separate "bucket".  Perhaps something like allowing a certain amount of qol slots and then post level 50 it goes up.  This would give players an added benefit from leveling past 50 and players love progression and the min/max p\[layers won't have their qol perks all fleshed out till past 50 anyway.  
---
With the upcoming "prestige" system that allows you to reset your character, you would keep the qol perk progression you earned before the reset.
---
It does not exist in the game due to a bug.  No one has it anywhere.  
---
by how many? maybe you glitched by being 24999 and picking up 10 to get 25009. can you pick up more?
---
I've noticed this on my legendary armor too. This needs more publicity. 
---
I'm on PC. I'll tell you the truth, it barely works now. But it's not "you can't put camps next to each other" bad. 
---
I mean you can manually pull from those nodes. But a "camping" system that's a bed, a fire and maybe a banjo isn't going to have the refiner things lol. 
---
You on Xb1? 
---
I wouldn't do side that playing smart. It's more exploiting a broken mechanic in game. If the penalty exists in adventure it should in survival. Esp seeing as the penalty is pvp related to begin with. I've never come up on the negative in caps in survival but to kill someone  repeatedly and get nothing from it is useless. I can kill someone 10 times in a row and lose once and they come out the beneficiary? That's broken.
---
Thought I was the only one. Yup. Still see this happen all the time with it
---
I never had that problem finding them back
---
Ha I wish, nope just two star with those two effects. 
---
Oh yes, I'd definitely suggest applying the same logic to any crafting and workshop cards. (repairs, ammo, etc.)    
---
And I'm all for more efficient means of repairs, in whatever form. 
---
I'd love to find that list to see what stacks. How would I go about finding it? Search never works for me here. I'm about to out together a lot of sets. Want to know what works together. Like u only need one Chameleon piece. Does Cloaking work the same? Or would it give you a longer stealth field? 
---
I have very little faith in bethesda fixing much of anything, but it'ed be nice to get a small fraction of what they promised in the hype train leading to release.
---
Brotherhood members/those who get recuirted have a 90% discount while those who aren't Brotherhood members will have a 50% discount. Either way it's still a much fairer trade rather then buying stuff from the robot vendors. 
---
I mean: Purified Water from robot vendors = 37 caps per can of water while from me it'll be: 5 caps per water for Brotherhood members and 15 caps per water for non Brotherhood members.
---
If that makes any sense.
---
But why? What's the point of hamstringing people that have been grinding? 
---
Except you can keep getting perks every level. It's stat points that are limited (The special points that perk packs don't influence). And you choose what perk cards you get every level, it's not a random pack. That's just an extra bonus you get every 5 levels. have you played the game? Because from what I gather of your complaint, you really don't grasp how you get perk cards at all.
---
Your never too old to game. I remember playing Burnout Revenge offline for about a year, before going online. Best thing I ever did. I just crashed, never raced, and 90% of my Xbox friends are from that game, which I played online for years! I also have a playstation, where I play with all my real life friends.
---
It‚Äôs pretty heavy too..
---
Maybe there's less high-quality materials left in the later installments. ;)
---
Also, Appalachia is the center of automation (mining specifically), so it makes sense that they'd have access to better resources than other areas.
---
They mean planned maintence when taking down the game. Did that happen today?
---
Never saw a "I read it wrong" so I just went with providing data. What's frustrating is I actually had a lot of fun with tactics. But it could have been so much better.
---
Kinda like other fallouts I can name. I'm having fun with it, but it's...not indicative of what the franchise is capable of, or best known for. 
---
Place it on the side of a cliff where nothing can attack it. 
---
If you read the Inside the Vault from last week, the ability to rename items is coming in Patch 8.
---
I'd like to see a grid like they use in the construction kit.
---
Wow, that's awesome!
---
I think the compass dot exists in survival too and is perception based.
---
Brilliant idea, why not have them only usable on a fridge üëç
---
I got mine too. 
---
Except. I have to be naked to use it. 
---
And it weighs 1 pound 
---
I use Chameleon mutation so I can ensure I am the first one to fire. It will lose a straight man-fight against most other builds. However, if you set yourself up on a high perch and remain in stealth, you will be able to drop people at range much easier that TSE users can.
---
My build is 15 luck/agility. Only six in perception. Concentrated Fire perk gives all the accuracy you need. 
---
I do very well in survival considering I am way off the meta. No TSE, no sentinel. I think my records are 28 kills without dying, 6 hours longest life. 1 hour longest wanted time. Highest wanted reward was 4k caps.
---
All I know is the game has crashed 5 times for me this morning, and that's worse than it's ever been before lol. 
---
No melee perks, only spawns at level 20, not dropped by enemies so no legendaries either. All of the other v fast weapons can go to at least level 45 and I know for sure the ripper has legendaries not sure about the buzz blade or drill though. It's only saving quality is when it's at 200% repair its damage jumps to 45 ish
---
I've had the same situation except I saw the lockpick option and immediately knew it was an "owned" supply drop. Nope, not going to touch that automatic wanted level, especially for useless shit inside. I have run across drops since then that were fair game.
---
Itn"patched" bugs. It's not full content update but it is a patch.
---
I suspect it is similar to FO4 and in that game I was able to get setup with perks and gear such that I was able to run non-stop and my AP bar didn't budge.
---
yaeh, this is what I've been doing for now. It's a workaround, not ideal though. Now i don't do it as much, but I used to pick every single piece of vegetable or fruit or meat on the way and my spoiled sort was a mess too! Now it's much better :)
---
It used to work with the Veil of Secrets, but the Fasnacht event seemed to fix it. (xbox)
---

---
The endurance, charisma, and luck perks are kind of to-taste, and I don‚Äôt actually use Strange in Numbers right now because it utterly breaks Adrenal Reaction, but I run a 1star bloodied lever action and one-head-shot everything but scorchbeasts (and I can down them in 2 shots if it‚Äôs night time and I use a crit)
---
You don‚Äôt need bandolier. The fuck. You only need to carry a couple hundred rounds at once, that‚Äôs like 1-2 pounds at most. Especially with a lever action; I return from farming with more ammo than I left with; .45 ammo is plentiful.
---
My charisma allows for Lone Wanderer but I usually play in a group so I don‚Äôt use it; I recommend it if you play solo. 
---
Don‚Äôt drop gun fu. The fuck. It‚Äôs what allows me to walk into a room and drop 5 super mutants in 5 seconds with chain headshots (lever action has much better fire rate than sniper rifle). 
---
Your best defense is staying hidden, get Unyielding armor, it‚Äôll get you to 30+ agility which is a massive stealth bonus. Aim for 34 Luck (so Unyielding pieces with +luck, and maybe Herd Mentality mutation if you run groups. Why? Because with my perk loadout, 34 Luck gets you a crit every other shot (not that you need it at my damage level, except on big beasts like SB/mirelurk queen, you‚Äôll down everything with noncrit headshots).
---
Comments about most Luck perks are on point; I haven‚Äôt messed around with them much to find an optimal setup based on crit/damage (like I said, most of the time I don‚Äôt even need to use Crits) so it‚Äôs probably a good idea to swap something out and add Serendipity. 
---
Dodgy in Agility is good but you have to be aware that it drains AP; sometimes that can be dangerous (but if you‚Äôve got full Unyielding, the 30+ agility means you have a ton of AP)
---
This is my kind of bounty.
---
a separate qol perk tree that grows with levels past 50 would be nice.    
---
While the learning by doing is a perfectly reasonable suggestion, changing now would be kind of jarring.  What happens to all the characters that already have the perks maxed out?
---
Why is PA no effective in PvP? Dont most suits have stealth mods?
---
Right, no one has the "Plans" however I can craft Shielded Casual under armor. I think the plans are intentionally not in the game. Meaning like the Excavator, Ultracite, and X01 Power Armors, you unlock those through completing quests and not reading plans. So I would say it does exist as an option to craft, but not as plans. It just needs to be unlocked.
---
I didn't even know the game was meant to tell you. I came back to my camp the other day and it had taken a fair amount of damage and I wish I could have protected it in person.
---
No patch or update notes?  Can anyone provide some pics of new stuff in ATOM shop?
---
I‚Äôd recommend get to the point where you‚Äôre not needing anything you got your god roll guns and armour 50k rounds all you need before you worry about it, however you can grind workshop events they are a prize for competition 
---
Well it's not that I want to use it as a second storage but more of a hub where I can actually get some caps back for the excess chems, food, or resources that I've collected or carry around with me currently. 
---
Previously I just wasn't okay with leaving a bunch of resources in a bag on the ground since I didn't know if it would go to any good use. Having the vendors will help with that problem because someone may check it at least once in awhile.
---
just like you would if you were making them from scratch. it just uses the mods rather than the junk.
---
Good way for them to reclaim as much duped items as possible. Just like BIV. All the nuclear material and Qauntums. Save your gear.
---
If you‚Äôre a raider you should be using a Pole Hook and a Broadsider/Harpoon Gun. Just saying! 
---
Most of my Fallout 4 settlements had chicken coops.  
---
For some reason this only applies to some games. By his logic WOW was sold incomplete in 2004 because it still gets updates and paid expansions today.
---
I used to think perk loadouts would be a good fix for this. But now i run 5 intelligence, which so far seems to be enough for any crafting i have to so. But i have like 8 different crafting cards and can only use 1 or sometimes 2 at a time. So even with a crafting loadout, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to fit all your perks unless you run a high intelligence. Crafting and lock picking and other QOL cards need to be passive in one way or another. 
---
Ive read lots of good ideas for passive perk systems on Reddit, hopefully Bethesda has read them too!
---
Sometimes it does. Sometimes it doesn't. I have found no order in what will cause it to show or not show. I also have yet to get the warning in survival mode, so they may have completely disabled it for that.
---
On a usable fridge at that lmao 
---
Multiple times as long as you have the required materials
---
That rules! We're there patch notes or I guess fix notes? This actually killed me last night for the first time because I was out of ammo. Kinda cracked me up but I could see how this would suck for most ppl.
---
Thnx
---
Do you have nerd rage? Adrenaline? Those too buff the damage on bloodied weapons a lot. 
---
How low is your health? 
---
Electric fences!!!!!!
---
Are you saying you can craft the casual underarmor?  Or that you can upgrade the casual underarmor to shielded?    If the latter, head over to Marketplace76 and offer your services‚Äîyou will be rich.   No one else can do that.  
---
\[Imgur\]([https://i.imgur.com/DGSYXbF.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/DGSYXbF.jpg))
---
That definitely contributes to server performance. However, even after the last few server restarts when patches came, I feel like the camp loading was much slower compared to what I saw today. It could be that things were not getting calculated properly when a player would load, resulting in slow camp loads and possibly, even spawn invulnerability not working. Of course I could be very, very wrong and maybe I am just imagining that the speed is a bit faster today.
---
I have trouble finding ants as well. I've hit the substation just north of Watoga but typically the deathclaw has killed all the ants by the time I get there, so I only get glowing meat and not ant meat. Ugh...
---
As a person who sells those in bulk I can attest that no more than five lines of unstackable items remain in vendors inventory. 
---
That flat out has never happened for me. I've gotten bitten by this twice, at which point I stopped doing them primarily because there _was_ no warning, at all. 
---
Are you on Xbox? I have a few low level legendaries I could give you if you are.
---
Maybe they'll bring them in with the pioneer scouts quests that are coming
---
Found a legendary level 1 frog once but a scorch beast blast killed it before I could do anything.  I hope to see one again one day and take it to my camp.
---
Was desperately hoping for a content patch. Not sure why they'd release survival (in beta no less) before content, and now it's just survival getting a hotfix.
---
I'm trying really hard to keep myself occupied. The lack of end game is killing me, Bethesda.
---
yeah, it's one of those really badly designed bits of the game that just makes me scratch my head. 
---
I thought it would be better that certain perks, like Lockpick or Super Duper were also tied to a required SPECIAL stat value.
---
Example: Hacking would only require a stat of 3 INT, but for each level after the first, bump up the required level by another 3.  However, once you earn them, you don't have to swap them in and out anymore.
---
This model could be applied to any perk that doesn't modify any active effect, with perks that affect weapon damage or armor bonuses be the only ones that need slots.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs a bit annoying.
---
My dream is to come across a well filled with frogs and I can just drop a grenade down the well and kill like 100 or 200 frogs all at once and eat their legs and gain their power.
---
If the event is ongoing, you always get your value in caps back, so there's no risk there.
---
The only risk is missing an event and not getting anything.  So you basically just blew money because the game promised you an opportunity and then yanked it away like Lucy with a football.
---
That's the risk you want in the game?  I'd rather have the risk that you go there, spend 30 min, and ONLY get your caps back because you failed.
---
Especially events that work best with multiple players.  If I saw someone there and knew I'd at least get my caps back, I'd happily go help them out.
---
I didn't want to go offtopic, but similar thing happens when I try to review my armors. Trying to go from slot to slot is a pain. I wish I could group them by slot see what goes on head, what on left arm... specially with the love of this game for adjectives "Hardened softened radioactive leather..." and I don't know even it it's left or right and even less if its for leg or arm. hahaha. I can live with those things, it's just, as you said, it's quite tedious.
---
Bethesda explicitly said there would not be patch notes on this hotfix, other than to say it was to fix fast travel immunity in survival. So anything new either had to be data mined or discovered the hard way - like the new more functional train station maps.
---
Good luck, they'll probably tell you it's your CPU or graphics card. 
---
I agree with 95% of what you say, with the exception of food and water. In that sort of situation, with all the running around/fighting/carrying massive loads of junk that we do, it‚Äôs realistic to expect that we would need huge amounts of calories and hydration. It does get annoying sometimes, so I don‚Äôt hesitate to drink from any water source I can find when I‚Äôm dehydrated. And as long as you have the cannibal perk up, food shouldn‚Äôt be a problem. 
---
It's more a case of not flooding the game with God tier weapons. It would be the same as the issues we had when there was rampant duping and if you weren't in the loop with someone that knew someone, you got owned with teams of TSE auto weapons. Either you played the same, or you spent  half your game time sever hopping.
---
I use adrenaline maxed but not nerd rage..all I can say is that nerd rage must really boost the damage? because the TSE is like 150 ahead of the BE....
---
that is still a sick gun..i havent decided if my next build (new character) will be a bloodied or shotgun build
---
I'm not sure you need 3 Fireproof for PvE. I'm currently running 1 Fireproof + padded torso and no damage reduction on a practice bloodied build with terrible armor, and exploding cars only take off \~10% hp. Get a dense mod and that's probably enough on its own.
---
I feel like you'd want Grim Reaper's Sprint for VATS + Dodgy, but I don't use VATS much myself.
---
142 levels. The loot system in this game is in need of fucking serious overhaul. 
---
Yes.  Items like turrets eat up the budget quick 
---
Game doesn't explain this, frustratingly. All a pickup-able mod lets you do is build that mod without having the requisite SPECIAL perks for it. E.g., if a particular mod requires the third level of the energy gun perk to build and you don't have that perk card, the pickup-able mod lets you build it without having that energy gun perk equipped. BUT! You will still need the materials for that mod to apply it. So, all a pickup-able mod gives you is the ability to add a mod if and only if you have the materials for it. Otherwise you would need the materials -and- the perk card required to add the mod.
---
Dang it I thought for a second you listed Patriot Pants. Oh well.
---
I've been thinking of making an auto pistol build, but I'm not sure what falls under that category and if the perk cards are better than auto rifles or not, I have a quad explosive reduced weight laser rifle I can make into a pistol, (not for sale but thanks lol), so I'm curious if it'd be worth the time and effort
---
I have several places I farm for good plans, and sometimes I go days without getting any, but other times I can get several in one day from the same location
---
Another trick I use is that you can force the game to not snap walls/fences to each other if you flip their direction each section.  In this way, you can achieve angles other than 45 or 90 degrees with walls. :)
---
Here's a shot of one of my bases where I used that technique to get some stone walls into different shapes.  Also in this pic you can see an example of what I was talking about above, where I'm using the defensive stairs as the gate, with a defensive fence on top.
---

---
I still think the scorch plague will be cured and we may eventually see living human NPC's.   
---
Oh of course. They need to work on how this actually works
---
Gee thanks mister, golly gosh I never played a video game before, tell me everything else I need to do.
---
In general. I'm a dataminer. 
---
It's not a complaint at all but I could see it getting exploited really easy to get free stuff since it's repeatable daily. 
---
Ripper only spawns at 40. Buzz blade can also get legendaries. Drill is just like the chain saw (pretty sure only 1 level spawn, no legendaries)
---
I think faction-based CAMP structures in general would be nice. I've got three characters who belong to the Enclave, Brotherhood of Steel and the Raiders. At least give us some flags, maybe?
---
I really need that mirelurk queen claw to mount on my pirate ship, I can't wait.
---
Don‚Äôt tease us and don‚Äôt go all the way screenshot. 
---
If you play PVP sure.  But in PVE it doesn't really matter at all what anyone else has.  
---
But from what I've heard survival has been a dumpster fire anyway and people will have to make new characters for the upcoming seasons anyway. 
---
What is the absolute damage on both weapons at max?
---
grumble grumble how did miss that offering grumble grumble
---
More adds spawn 
---
Maybe they upped he cap in preparation for the player stores next week
---
I wish I still had an SO
---
No, but you could max out every SPECIAL and get 100 in every Tag skill.
---
And I‚Äôm talking about an instant respec. Something that has been an RPG stable for like 20 years.
---
Why on earth do you care? Are you a griefer who goes around fucking with other peoples shit, the primary reason foundation bases exist?
---
No one crafts and fights at the same time, it is absolutely absurd to have those types of cards be part of the same system and limit each other. I am all for having a specific combat loadout that you have to choose, but the crafting/lockpicking type cards need a different system.
---
https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Scorchbeast
---
Here you go, it's in there. I don't know what evidence they give. I appreciate you testing it, there's a lot of blatant misinformation and deception regarding info on this game. I did the same with all the lies about people getting banned for picking up large amounts of ammo lol. You're welcome for the link it was no problem
---
My mistake! Gotta stop staying on reddit late into the night
---
I do this when I want to look at the daily/weekly challenges. I was really hoping when they added in challenge tagging that it would add them in the quest tab on your pip-boy. To me it makes no sense to have them on the map menu because they dont give them map markers, except for the take pictures at locations x, y, and z and those are only there if you have found them on your own or from a firewatch tower. You can't even click on the locations to take you there on the map so why is this menu in the map screen?
---
I feel you. I also main a Gunslinger, and i really love the playstyle, but the damage cards in agility are really annoying. Would love a little buff! And moving the damage skills would be a great buff!
---
pics? by how much?
---
This nerf makes me actively angry. This type of build did zero harm, and is just a fucking testament to how stripped down and pathetic they want the building system in this game to be. 
---
Tbh, I'm betting they'll reintroduce them slowly as atom shop items.  So make sure you're getting your dailies in so you don't have to pay for them.  lol
---
Oh you‚Äôre welcome lil guy here‚Äôs a tissue to wipe that snot off your nose, one day even you can grow up to be a polite man
---
In Fallout 76's case, they are pushing out a client patch and also applying patches to their servers. The server OS is most likely Linux and won't be patched unless there's a need to do so. Game server patches will be applied during this time. They don't announce the changes as we can't see them, they only matter to the dev team and server team.
---
thats next week! im so hyped lmao
---
The explosion damage never bothered me that much but trying to find the body to loot did! 
---
Been playing the game for three months and I only learned about pushpins last week. :(
---
The Leaderboards appeal to a certain type of player and are important, and I get why they started out on Survival time as the metric, in order to encourage people to not hunker down and hide. 
---
However, if the top 3 Killers were shown on the map that would be amazing.  You'd see where people are currently spawn camping, which helps some of your other listed issues.  You'd still have the satisfaction of a competitive leaderboard if that's your thing, and those of us not wanting to constantly get TSE'd in the face could keep away from them.  It would also give the Killers more challenge in hunting down prey, scaling their difficulty as well.
---
It‚Äôs entirely RNG. 
---
No legendary effects. AA, incisor, etc turn it to paper. you're slow, loud and probs flowing pink anyway. So stealth is only good at long ranges or places where you can use cover and head games to mess with an opponent.
---
I was reading how you can get higher def than PA &amp; found this post but I see it needs updating oh well, X-01 set replace X-01 chest with T-60 chest, &amp; 200% durability perk. Not all is 100% repaired atm, 564/645/515
---
I wanna learn how to get at least close to the def of PA though.
---
Yeah, I agree on matching. I use a BoS combat helmet with a gas mask, it‚Äôs sort of close. 
---
It‚Äôs just going to reset level. 
---
I've seen 2 this week. The last one I saw was in week 1 or 2 after release
---
But isn't the fermenter technically a crafting bench? That's certainly going to be tied to your stash but unless they're going to give us the option to mark what can and can't be sold (which would still be fairly ridiculous) then I don't see why it should be attached to the stash. 
---
I'd be fine with having it stay on a separate system even if it means I can't retrieve it after say a period of five minutes of from when I stop putting things into it. This would discourage people from using it as storage but give them a bit of a safety net if they realize they accidentally put something in that they didn't intend to sell.
---
Yeah, earth-shattering. 
---
Next week I believe 
---
Just bought a 3 star railway rifle, glad to hear about this change. Hopefully it will benefit from rifleman perk cards. Does anyone know if it can be modified? I went to go mod it, and I had none available 
---
I dont want to be a raider, but hot damn do I want the raider items from FO4. 
---
I've seen the same 4 heads on spikes all over Appalachia, and I want them in my living room damn it!!
---
Really think the crafting system would benefit.  High level stuff made by players should be better than legendary drops, but to have skill to craft  it you should have had to craft sufficient quantities to have balance... And the crafting should require mats dropped only by sufficient difficulty enemies.
---
FE stacks up more than AA, but you need 10+ rounds on the same target for that. AA works right off the bat and if he‚Äôs using HW without PA he has no innate armor piercing. 
---
I‚Äôd suggest AA for this concept, personally. 
---
You know what I am incorrect, as I was thinking the Vault Suit was considered Casual and is it's own under armor... Interesting that this hasn't been fixed yet....
---
And frog eggs so you can make donuts!
---
Havent tried crafting any, but I know quest items still appear on the workbench. Could try having a friend make them
---
With the exception of the first time it happened, the same my friend. But I farm Watoga a lot and I know there's a bunch of other folks who do too and I'd rather they find out the easy way than the hard way.
---
Sources? 
---
Ok I thought my ripper was 45 but it's only 40 and I swear I've seen a drill at level 20 and I've gotten them from enemies or it was the event reward from I think back on the beat. Not sure about legendaries for it. These all need to be buffed because they're just fun to use
---
I would have to do the test again for the exact figures  but the TSE was running at around 750 ish if I remember correctly...that was running risky at under 20% health.
---
Under 20%
---
Same and 2 were just this week
---
No Im telling you I just stood there in my shop as him and his friend leveled the camp, they couldnt do damage to me because I wasn't attacking back and I had no workshop to contest. They destroyed a couple walls got the 20 cap bounty and after that the bounty stopped rising as they leveled my generators and everything else. 
---
Fireproof 3 also provides resistance against Scorchbeast breath attacks, supermutant grenades and molotovs, and if you use explosive weapons, it will save your life when you're spamming your explosive handmade to clear the pack of ghouls meleeing you. 
---
I have a 12 luck and unyielding/lck boosts. My crit meter fills in 1-3 hits, my AP is enough for 12-15 uninterrupted 1-shots with my VATS reduced main wpn, I think the points in Grim reaper are better spent somewhere else.
---
FP 3* is one of my essential picks.
---
My build is solid for both PvE and PvP.
---
Ok... was that a legendary "frog" you found or a legendary "radtoad". It makes a difference. One is a passive animal that doesn't attack and just acts like a little prey animal (like the foxes, squirrels, cats you come across). The other is an enemy mob that attacks you. The reason I'm curious is if it is a frog that's interesting because that means the passive animals get legendary effects too.
---
Remember the legendary skill mechanic from Skyrim? 
---
Which is pretty risky
---
I thought I would be able to with Max robot hacker perk like you could tame animals. Boy was I wrong when the hack wore off and my Assaulttron friend beamed me in the face.
---
Honestly that would be greatest thing for new characters
---
I am not sure sneak actually works in pvp. How would the game know if the other player sees you ?
---
Same, I want the lever action, but this seems like a very easy one, so I might grab it. I haven't used a pistol since I was level 3 though lol.
---
Low level I leave at overseer camp or flatwoods cavhe
---
Clearly it will be optional..?
---
Both weapons act like bloodied due to adrenal reaction and the TSE appears to be the winner everytime..
---
Cheap ammo, too, only 7 steel to make a set
---
Thank you, I had like 80 turrets set up. THEY GET DESTROYED SO QUICK AS WELL
---
Can quest items be traded? To make it ("repair" it) one of the items is the tracker itself which is a quest item.
---
No problem.  Per Redditor RisingDusk, the Free States questline is supposed to give Protective Casual plans but is bugged.  And since you cannot receive Shielded as a drop without knowing Protective no one has ever received it legitimately.   
---
It has a good deal of mods. Most you‚Äôll get some scrapping and some are plan only.
---
Auto piston and prime receivers. Long and short barrels. Large bayonet (which looks badass), and maybe more that I‚Äôm missing. Recoil compensating stock. Lots of scope options too. I like the reflex personally. 
---
Thats pretty wierd my bloodied weapons do much more dmg than amy tse
---
Im away from the console atm but just looking at nerd rage perk on line surely it would boost the TSE the same as the BE looking at the wording?
---
As a heavy weapon or as a rifle? It'd be a sick heavy weapon imo 
---
the way you look is giving me raider vibes...
---
this must be a trap!
---
Yeah, I loved the inclusion of rad chickens. Could you catch them in traps though?
---
No it's going to give  you todd said in a pannel at pax it will give you tokens when you give it legendary's to spend on different ones you can buy from him
---
Seems so, away from home so can‚Äôt find out ‚òπÔ∏è
---
I am not trusting any displays that show up on screen. I have not seen any increase in ability to kill people by sneaking. How would the game know whether another player saw you coming up on them to take a shot?
---
did you notice the ultracite ore when you were in there? your going to need that at some point.
---
Then increase the recipe requirement maybe? It's already incredibly easy to do a run around Slocum Joes for fire caps, then a run from Vault-Tec Agricultural Research Center along the dried riverbed out to the lake along the west of the map for Bloodleaf and Snaptail reed, and make like 60-70 disease cures.
---
I have also suggested terrariums that require 10 power and perhaps can only grow one unit of fungus or plants. This would at least create a cost and effort to producing these things if not wild picking.
---
I agree that if players can plant unlimited rare plants it does break the economy. I also think purified water is too easy to get, I have an industrial water purifier and don't even really need it because I end up picking up so much randomly. And I craft chems wildly
---
It was a little frog not the big rad toad.  I should have snapped a screen shot. Happened at a location with a tent on a mountain near Whitesprings.  I had been there before many times and never seen  frogs there, it is usually molerats.
---
I would like something like this.
---
I have a rank 3 adrenaline perk card and a rank 2, they are for when I switch up my build and I want to make use of all my special points.
---
Ahhh crap. Forgot about that. Welp bug report it is. Sorry
---
90 days late but hey 
---
They spawn randomly on a tree on that stretch where you find 5 pods there‚Äôs one bloom at all times ( unless you took it already and it spoiled on you )
---
Hell yes üëç
---
Usually if I got nothing better to do, I will farm the golf club house.  If I get a lot of legendaries from that, I will grind the usual spots over the map. If not, rinse/repeat on another server.  To each their own, but this usually works for me, and I get tons of legendary drops
---
All the challenges for the next few weeks are in the game and will be much easier in general
---
Building and hoarding mostly lol, oh and modding all the hoarded legendary armour I have to ultra light build so I can fit even more in my stash üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Well I sure hope they stack
---
Don't suppose you could list your perk cards if it's not too much trouble? So I can see the differences 
---
Thanks I‚Äôm glad to hear it
---
Selfishly I‚Äôd like to see it as a heavy for stabilized and bear arms, but my moneys on it being a rifle. 
---
We got lever action skin, i dont need any skins anymore
---
Wow amazing!  I'm gonna have to borrow that process to build my bar for when player vending comes out.  Currently have most of the alcohol recipes unlocked and have been stockpiling booze for a while, ready to make the wasteland just a little bit drunker.
---
 Hot fix - addresses game to crash, addresses brief invulnerability in survival after fast traveling and respawning under certain conditions.
---
Enemies can pass thru walls already and sometimes even spawn inside as well. As for the navmesh npcs had no problems using upper floors and they could be snapped directly to walls without having to snap to a stair first in Fallout 4. I'm just saying it worked fine there and should work the same here the u should not have changed it.
---
Crazy! Too bad you didn't.... now I'm going to be looking for legendary animals in the game.
---
Bethesda really trying to milk people out by getting rid of things in the atomic store, it‚Äôs actually such a joke at this point..
---
Maybe they will come after vault raid dlc
---
I definitely like the idea of this. Kind of slightly OT but definitely player crafting needs more purpose end-game so that it can compete with legendary items.
---
I‚Äôll have to run some tests later lol
---
Waiting for the explosion......waiting......waiting..... I guess this one won't explode, let's see what dropped.
---
BOOM
---
Legit thank you for the info. I love me some patch notes.
---
Im using commando build all maxed out tank killer, bloody mess, adrenal, adrenaline tier 3
---
Yeap know bug :(
---
I‚Äôve ran into it 2 times and each time it just stood there telling me to stop
---
Whoa tell me about these pushpins?
---
All of the rifleman, tank killer, tormentor. I also run quick hands, bandolier and tenderizer. I‚Äôm planning to bring it in line with a sneak rifleman build. 
---
FROG PEOPLE FROG PEOPLE FROG PEOPLE
---
They would drop automatically at my feet when server hopping or first getting on and I couldn't interact with them. 
---
I get that in the bog occasional. It should correct itself after a few minutes
---
yesterday, I had 5 crashes, multiple freezes, and I was working really hard to complete the "drink 25 alcohol" challenge. And then I sat down when I had about six left, and realized that without going out and hunting up another player to buy something from, I would \_not\_ be able to complete the challenge, even though I'd done the quest every fucking day.   
---
Today, post patch, I've had two crashes in less than ten minutes of trying to play. One was from the main menu, with no interaction from me at all.   
---
I'm level 142, I've never received anything that would qualify as a "great" legendary drop, I've server-hopped at the enclave bunker hundreds of times and found 2x jetpacks and 1x calibrated shocks.   
---
I've spent easily five hours trying to find the responders vendor. I've gotten it once.   
---
This game is addictive, but in a very serious way, it's horrible.  No matter how much time and energy you throw at it, it's not rewarding, and every day I leave slightly more disappointed than the day before.   
---
The best thing about this game is that it's fun to explore, you never know what that next drop will be, you hope that next update will be amazing, that next legendary will be EPIC...but it probably won't be.   
---
What is the pillar trick? 
---
This makes sense. Yes I would like to change this leaderboard from survival time to kills. But, this could still encourage hunkering down. You can hide in you‚Äôre camp in the forest and wait for people to come and try to kill you, only to get themselves killed.
---
Holy shit!
---
I am pretty sure you don‚Äôt need the materials. I‚Äôve had it show 0/2 or whatever because I was out of that particular material and I could still apply it. 
---
It wasn't saved as a blueprint? 
---
And bloodied fire rate handmade
---
That's the problem though. It never seems to correct. 
---
Been a long time since I laughed Soda out of my nose.  Well played sir.
---
I was so excited to hear about this one till I drank some and got a -50 carry weight hangover :(
---
I encountered him for the first time a few nights ago, and he said something to the equivalent of 'Insult loading, stand by' then just walked off...
---
It was pretty disappointing, considering I was expecting Zingbot.
---
Defense! They have the wooden corner fence and regular wooden fence panels and then a gate to match but the gate never works for me! Maybe I‚Äôm dumb but I can‚Äôt figure it out. And then there is a cute little log stump fence thing in that same category I got for taking a workshop that‚Äôs also cute, I use it inside the house usually though lol 
---
Don't worry about the perks and mutations and stuff, since they should realistically affect both guns equally (as far as % bonuses apply).
---
So if you have a Two-Shot Explosive Gauss Rifle, and a Bloodied Explosive Gauss Rifle, I'd expect the following:
---
* At 100% health, the TSE does more damage than the BE.
---
* Because you have Adrenal Reaction this applies, so your TSE should see this much increase:
---
|HP|weapon damage, %|
---
|:-|:-|
---
|20%  &lt;|150%|
---
|20 - 29%|144%|
---
|30 - 39%|138%|
---
|40 - 49%|131%|
---
|50 - 59%|125%|
---
|60 - 69%|119%|
---
|70 - 79%|113%|
---
|80 - 89%|106%|
---
|\&gt;  90%|100%|
---
* As you lose health, the damage on the BE increases as well, so the Bloodied explosive should be increasing by the above amount AND the further damage increase due to it being Bloodied.
---
*By the time you're at 20% health, I would personally think that the Bloodied should be dealing more damage than the Two-shot
---
However, I guess depending on the damage bonus formula, it's possible the initial boost of the TSE could still outweigh the Bloodied boost when you factor in Adrenal Reaction.
---
Start by writing down the damage of each gun at 100% HP. Then take 20% rad damage, and write down the new numbers. Repeat until you get to 20% hp and then report back!
---
Why do you view separating the player base as a good thing? I think the ideal version of this game has activity in all the aspects at the same time. 
---
I killed the scorchbeast on the end of BOS questline with a normal 50cal and trust me that thing fucks scorchbeasts
---
How do you one shot them?
---
Yeah that sucks. Might have to be my end of the night option just as I'm about to log off. Lol
---
Wow, someone offered me 1500 for it yesterday. I hadn‚Äôt even planned on selling it, I was going to give it to an alt, but I figured for 1500 I‚Äôd just go get it again. 
---
*Sierra Petrovita Intensifies*
---
It does exist. I have it. One of the first ones I unlocked. 
---
Stand in front a map and position your center screen marker (not sure what the official name for this is) over the push pin and press the action key (x on an xbox controller). That location will be added to your map if you haven't discovered it yet. But the icon will be greyed out (not blue on your in-game map).
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
People keep talking about hardware but the devs have no access to the hardware since they use Amazon web services cloud. They have to update the software and database and test to make sure nothing broke. That can take a while since the game is so large
---
I just really see SO MUCH potential in this game to be good with fundamentally obvious solutions that, for some reason, they aren‚Äôt implementing. 
---
...what the shit is this garbage?  Pewdiepie is a fucking letsplayer who's been around a couple years. Jim Sterling's a (controversial, admittedly) game journalist who's been around a hell of a lot longer. 
---
Thanks very much for the verification. Back to scrapping!!
---
indeed :P 8 quick crits in no time!
---
I didn't add in laser pistols because I don't have that much experience with them. Energy weapons in general don't perform very well, especially since they don't benefit from anti-armor.
---
If you really want to use that gun I'd assume you'd have more luck keeping it as a rifle? Maybe someone else has more experience with them and can give better advice though.
---
Is there a recipe for frog eggs and legs? Feels like there should be, but I have never found one. Makes me fee guilty to slaughter them whenever I visit Whitesprings since I can't actually do anything with them outside of the occasional uranium drop.
---
Are you doing a unlock all mods things or just want to use it?
---
My critical shotgunner build thanks you!
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure fallout 76 has a suggestion thing where people can recommend it you‚Äôd have to look into that 
---
How the hell did you get it for 1k, did you buy it from another player? 
---
It‚Äôs a camp- construction and assembly mobile platform. Not a fort, house, settlement. It is designed to be mobile. If you really need more budget I suggest removing lights and turrets.  Rebuilding Appalachia is not directly building things, it‚Äôs clearing out the scorched, and re establishing order in the ever changing wasteland. There are more chapters to the story coming.
---
They try to snap to each other but I can't get one word to snap perfectly and I want to use the same railway spike 
---
hmmm  clarification req. i've found that I still have to have the material to make the mod.
---
ie  calibrated shocks from a mod,(in the box), still required that I had the flux etc to make it. glitched by the way - lost 4500 caps and the mods.
---
Trying to unlock them all. This is the last one for me. 
---
Wow that's uncalled for.
---
What is more functional about the maps?
---
I'd like to see a couple of major revisions to the perk system.  Utilities like lock picking and hacking are, at various points in the game, absolutely required. They shouldn't be tied to a card-based talent system.  Rather I'd like to see those baked into the game, unlocked at key levels (Lockpicking v1.0 at level 5, 2.0 at level 15 for example).  You could probably do this with things like the VAT accuracy cards too.
---
I'd also rather not have multiple cards that provide the same perk.  I currently have 3 different cards that all provide the same bonus to my rifle.  It's not really interesting... and it's kind of annoying to know that I have to dedicate 9 points to essentially modify one weapon type.
---
I'd rather see those 3 cards do DIFFERENT things. Maybe one increases my damage a total of 60% while others focus on providing further nuanced utility to the rifle spec (perhaps one increases range, or another offers increased armor penetration or improved load time, etc).
---
Condensing the cards and replacing those repetitive abilities with something new means we have more cards that do DIFFERENT things and maybe everyone won't be so cookie-cutter with Build X and Build Y.
---
Same for Fallout 4. I pause the game to check the map but wait, I'm not playing Fallout 76.
---
They exist mainly for resources and ingredients. It makes sense, even in an irradiated wasteland not every creature would be hostile and attack you but they wouldn't be everywhere due to the aggro nature of other beasts nearby.
---
beg to differ
---
The mods are scrappable for mats, so I believe the required mats are part of the picked up mod - you dont need the mats.   (which is why you can scrap mods for their base materials)
---
Whenever I've tried to install a picked up mod that would normally required a perk to create, the modify screen showed the required perk card, a locked padlock, and would not let me apply the mod I had picked up.
---
I think they should separate skills and perks (like new vegas). Perks are the cards, they give you an extra hability: like pharma farma, super duper, etc. Put sills are improved practising (like skyrim) or asigning points every level (like new vegas). Those are a base stat you improve, they are passive. You cannot forget how to repair a gun, or how to hack a terminal. I think ths is the best option, but it's also a big change from the current formula, tell me what you think.

Might be preference but I would see t-51b all others except X-01 helmet for recon sensors, would be more or less the best set. As you can see from the post T-51b has both highest DR and ER, it's not like with ordinary armor.
---
That's probably what Im going to do once I get tired of excavator. The helmet mod is clearly a preference but you are losing very little in taking X-01 anyway, for it.
---
I‚Äôll give you 3k if you still have it. 
---
What?!?!? You don‚Äôt like drinking/making over 400 units of alcohol a week????
---
But at that point you know what you are getting into on both sides.  And I'd rather you be trying to recreate Thunderdome than shooting my face at a train station. 
---
Yikes and I thought the world just not loading in was rough. That thing breaks my brain...
---
This!!!  
---
Hey, that‚Äôs a good idea!
---
https://imgur.com/a/7dOi1no
---
Not from a scorchbeast directly, but on a related note - I recently looted BoS combat arms or legs from the megasloth corpse at the prime fissure site.  This is probably just RNG luck, but maybe something to check occasionally if you're in the area.
---
Thanks, gotcha. Do you know why they don't benefit from anti-armor? I'm just dabbling into them since I got explosive ones
---
I've got some mods for the xo1 thinking he was the best... guess I'll swap back to 51. Mods are easier to find for 51 right? 
---
The golf course south of wavy Willard had 150 violet flux  but no enemies.   
---
If you try walking through one of these things it's a disaster. Just millions of spikes shooting out of the ground 
---
Could have store on the ground, upper deck open area on top of that and closed off secluded living area on top. Stacking staircases would keep the floor changes nice and orderly. Maybe even a bar on the open deck area. With a small garage off to the side for workbenches. 
---
Or make a square, with open courtyard. Different wings for different things. 
---
Yeah drills and syringers are still in the loot list as if they were legendary items, but they don‚Äôt actually have legendary variants, it‚Äôs pretty dumb.
---
I have 30.000 caps. I‚Äôd show you a picture but you don‚Äôt know her, she lives in Canada.
---
you are most welcome, us shotgunners' gotta stick together eh :)
---
Wow yeah I‚Äôve pretty much just been using the survey towers to map out an area when I come across it. 
---
This pushpin thing is really going to open the world up for me finding new locations. 
---
I have noticed a couple of times the survey tower telling me it added new locations to my map but when I checked I had no new grey icons in that area but I could just be blind. 
---
In the enclave by the vendor that sells x01 mod there are papers that list what plants turn to what flux
---
Jsyk the twinkling lights displaying the nuka logo is totally a mistake and will defiantly be fixed 
---
You're entitled to your opinion. Even an opinion as fucking stupid as this one. 
---
The system is, objectively, smaller. We were promised the opportunity to re-build Appalachia, and we don't have that. Your fucking _opinion_ that they mean "kill scorched" when there's a _building system in the game_ is mindbogglingly stupid, to my mind, but again, you're entitled to it. 
---
There are more chapters, but that won't make the CAMP system less _objectivity_ fucking underwhelming. 
---
Apparently it also works on anything hit by a Tesla rifle if you Crit fire it, per another poster
---
Same here I have an anti armor grognak and it doesn't go past 100%
---
Unfortunately, no! PS4. Thanks anyway, mate!
---
&gt; An all-new prestige system will allow players above level 50 to become Legendary, resetting their characters with all new more powerful abilities.
---
This is obviously my own interpretation, but the focus is clearly on level. I don't believe becoming legendary will destroy your CAMP or delete your stash. 
---
In-story the plague is ended, but the game won't remove it unless they revamp the entire leveling experience. Which means it's still there even after we've "won."
---
Hot fix only. Addressed crash issues, player invulnerability in survival and New items in the Atoimic shop for the week.
---
I only just came across this a few days ago  and totally freaked me out for a few minutes. There are some other neat things going on too, I totally recommend exploring in that camp and around it.
---
For sure agree that it could use some work, at the very least it would be awesome to allow for like 5 saved loadouts.
---
Sorry didn‚Äôt know, I didn‚Äôt see anything for the road map. Thanks!
---
Lol sorry I just noticed as I ran out for work. This made me laugh
---
Where is this concern coming from? 
---
.... uh. Why are you expecting attacking a team mate to heal them?
---
Are you referring to the Friendly Fire Charisma perk? I‚Äôve heard that currently, it *only* works with the flamer, no other fire sources (Molotov, shishkebab, plasma flamer are all apparently out).
---
Don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs considered a bug or expected behavior, though 
---
Have em in my camp üíÄ
---
Lvl 286 900h and 1 drop thats got me over 4k once . Thats bad rng
---
Yep i will give it a go.ty
---
Pfft. Cheesy as hell. No way.
---
I have a problem with blueprints. For some reason it doesn't allow me to place down camps. It just keeps spinning red. I cant say it any other way. Until a hacker makes a video on how to restack concrete foundations. I'm telling you don't move it.
---
FYI, Zealots does nothing for the SBQ, only the Prime mod. She has really high Energy resists too if I recall correctly. 
---
Larger versions of the electric frog would be really cool. I‚Äôve always been a fan of the weirder and less common creatures in game. 
---
Would love some lager spider enemies as well replies and insects tend to be smaller creatures and it‚Äôs a shame because they can be really scary if they were a big bigger. Look at the Radscorpion, that thing is terrifying! I‚Äôd love to feel the same type of awe and fear from lighting frogs and giant spiders.
---
Spiders might be too close to Skyrim creatures though so I also vote for bringing back the Nightstalkers (half-wolf half-rattlesnake creatures) from New Vegas. And the Nightkin (supermutants with chameleon skin that go invisible).
---
Vault meat still fav 4evr.
---
Flux spoils quickly,  max level "good with salt" (luck perk card) dramatically increases the time it stays fresh.   
---
Yeah I heard about the tokens, not sure I listened the right part. Do you mean you can select what legendaries you want, with enough tokens? That would be absurd, but whatever they do, I won't complain.
---
Hahaha did u read it in the accent Ik it isn‚Äôt quoted verbatum
---
What exactly makes a trading server (and especially an event server) different than an Adventure server? 
---
If you can craft the rifle, slap on super duper and craft like 10 if you are able.  Should be enough. 
---
Watoga vendor. About 10k depending on perks.
---
Love this :) My fiance and I have two ps4s and can confirm this is the most fun I've had playing video games
---
I live in Canada too. Is her name Sarah? If so she's a cool chick. We're neighbors.
---
Its alright to have different views but it gives no right to be rude about it.  Take a look at other peoples camps and amazingly creative builds they have come up with.  Best of luck.
---
get. rid. of. perk. swapping. entirely.
---
Respec at, say every 30 levels. But piss on the "Ima change my loadout more than my underwear" playstyle... might as well just give every player every perk, and say "have at 'er".
---
Nope. Make a build, stick with it. Respec when you are allowed. 
---
It is sightly annoying to set it up now but the fact it does work and works well makes it fantastic.
---
Also being able to use the outside site to see what cards are actually available and build your deck off that is also fantastic. 
---
Me too. Whoop whoop
---
It should have been! I think I‚Äôve done about 15 and am out of screws. Just wanted to make sure I wasn‚Äôt throwing away time and materials. Thanks again. 
---
Eh, no, eh, her name is Jade and she‚Äôs, eh, a dancer.
---
Take my upvote, didn't know the letters snap! Going to buy this right TF now lol.
---
Hmm I‚Äôm check vendors and see if they have the mod in stock for hahas. 
---
Yeah sure. Im a griefer. Look at these fabulous camps I destroyed. 
---
holy smokes, that's an even better tip if I'm being honest with myself here. Puts mine to shame, hah. Thanks for letting me know (Y)
---
Right, So kill swapping entirely. Lock players into a build until say... every 30 or 50 levels, when they can respect their skills.
---
I hate the "change my skills whenever I want" gameplay. Make people make actual builds, dammit.
---
Of course, 2 things I bought this week are on sale now, that's life though right? -.-
---
Already did it, with 1lvl pipe pistol. Every 6th shot is critical.
---
Those come in useful later. If you got 3 maxed out commando cards, then want to swap in an explosive a card but you only have 9 in perception, you drop a 3 rank card for a 1 rank and free up some slots.
---
You decided you needed to "correct" me, with fucking bullshit. Call me crazy, but you were rude first. I just returned that rudeness with profanity. 
---
Honestly I don't know why they don't. You would think that AA on them would pierce energy resist, but from everything I've seen and read, AA does nothing on them.
---
Link is bad,  missing /r
---
Yes please
---
Pistols did not become underpowered until the vats automatic nerfs. I did some calculations and determined my 10mm pistol had DPS comparable to a 6000 damage super sledge. I believe I was at 2400 DPS with a potential 3000 damage before reloading. The key is stacking sneak attacks, head shots, and critical hits. Criticals no longer working on successive shots lowered DPS by about 15%-40% depending on accuracy.
---
I switched to single shot pistols for awhile for PVP. A black powder pistol was giving 1800 damage per stacked bonuses shot. It was more than enough to one shot anyone. Now that survival has one shot protection, everyone is left at 20% HP. Damage does not matter. Fire rate matters. Pistols have some of the highest fire rates only losing to something like a minigun. I estimated my auto pistol would spit out 7.2 bullets per second.
---
Pistols are more of a player perception problem. The number in the pip boy is low, so it must be bad, right? In reality, you can be doing 5 to 6 times that number with sneak attack head shots. They also happen to be the best weapon to use in vats. My auto 10mm gets 13 shots in vats at 15 agility, and my auto pipe pistol gets 15.
---
Pistols, despite the critical and damage nerfs, are still extremely strong if used the right way.
---
The only fix I would give pistols, or automatics in general, would be to make it so critical receivers retain the old critical mechanics. For a loss in paper damage you would gain increased critical damage with 100% accuracy. That would make them a vats power house without overpowering them. The balance would come from the inability to target people in vats, like stealth boys or crouched opponents.
---
On a related note, there's a map in the military wing of the Enclave bunker that will mark the silos on your map.
---
You can borrow it later and it will be bloodied üòà
---
Thing is you can't do both shotgun and sniper you have to do one or the other second I think the game gets a lot harder around the 30 to 40 if your using rifles once past 50 it gets much easier
---
No, tjhats not what the genre name means,... by that logic, "Rygar" is a roleplaying game, because you're playing the "role" of The Legendary Warrior.
---
Nope. RPGs are about building a character that has to face the trials of the setting *as that character, and with that characters skills and limitations, as built".
---
I want 'sex' server.
---
I have gone for several days getting nothing but garbage (100+ legendary items dropped), but I have also gotten several good rolls in a single Session, it's the nature of RNG, the only way to get more good rolls, is to get more rolls.
---
When running Whitesprings, or Queen battles it's also a good idea to be teamed with others, since everyone on the team can loot the legendary enemies that are killed as long as you are in close proximity, it's not necessary to get a hit for the loot, only for the XP.
---
Because they were programmed by gamestop.
---
Reset? No. You can move special points every level after 50 however.
---
I've got plenty of caps. This is just an idea for small camps that can be moved for free 
---
You do not get to reset them but every level after 50 you get to choose to move a special point or pick a new perk card
---
Essentially you are reallocating your special but it is only 1 point / perk at a time
---
Again kind of, definitely needs work on Bethesda‚Äôs end
---
%25 of the ticket price is still great if you are selling useless/overstocked junk to vendor (like alcoholic beverage bottles, vases, steel scrap and wood scrap)
---
I‚Äôve never noticed this option on Xbox. Scrounger was one of the first  perks I picked in fallout 4 so I did the same here. Never noticed it doing anything so I replaced it. 
---
Preachin‚Äô to the choir, learning this was like a kick to the balls lol
---
So if have 10 strength and 5 agility I can make it so I have 8 strength and 7 agility?
---
nope, r/sequence is the subreddit and reddit.com/sequence is the event
---
thank you
---
I believe some radio towers have some and a room at the George River Bridge. Sorry if this counts as a spoiler. 
---
The Fasnacht Donut requires Frog eggs
---
Think of it as wholesale and retail.  The shop buys it for a wholesale price and then marks it up to make a profit.  It‚Äôs he same reason that item at wal-Mart costs you more to buy than it did for the company to produce.  The price the robot pays you is wholesale, the price you see as value is the MSRP or retail price. 
---
Thirdsies over here üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
IGN? I'd love some cores and ammo!
---
i want brotherhood 
---
Yessir
---
It's the only reason I can see to objecting to a specific camp style, is if that camp stile gets in the way of you being a fucking dick. 
---
I note in there multiple "exploits" like the round building hack. Not the game as intended. And floating bases. Naughty naughty. It's ok when YOU do shit with glitch hacks, but other people shouldn't build the bases they like? 
---
And a whitesprings kill-stealer build, because hey, farming other peoples spawns so they can't get any legendary loot on your watch is a great fucking way to spend your day. 
---
Ok, i guess im getting a 403 forbidden for other reasons 
---
My cat hit the spacebar and now i own the mothman sleeping bag
---
FFS, they put out a road map a month ago telling you exactly when each new piece of content was coming. 
---
I'm curious, how did you find out zealots doesnt affect her? I dont disbelieve you, I am just wondering if there is a source of information on her somewhere that I've missed. 
---
If you have nothing in charisma I think they are 12000
---
Right there with you on the dark woods floors, 8 hour miss.
---
Definitely interested as well, ign?
---
At least they took out flare guns.
---
It's got RIFLE in the name. 
---
God your a douche. Literally nothing constructive to say just being an asshole for fun. ‚ÄúYour entitled to an opinion, even a fucking stupid one‚Äù Jesus you need to go outside. 
---
Sell it for 1k caps. It's bloodied. Someone will buy it just to try it out. If it doesn't sell, you can use the legendary trader.
---
very likely there's something wrong with your system if you're on PC
---
Almost as good as my Junkies'!
---
That's been happening for a while, sometimes you don't see it because it drops though floors and other things, but it only seems to do that when you have one in your inventory, and I never actually lose it, when I check it's always still there.
---
I have just about stopped doing the Forbidden Knowledge quest, since I have not received anything but Aid &amp; Ammo (that I don't use) items since the last patch.
---
[SHAME!](https://youtu.be/uZ7vkmUNTPA)
---
Had that camp when I was a lower level, but couldn't deal with the SB so I moved. Might head back there now ;D
---
I‚Äôm hoping today‚Äôs maintenance has helped resolve it, it‚Äôs that been that bad since the last update and the survival launch I‚Äôve pretty much given up on it. 
---
What's constructive in what was sent my way? Why is it that the exact same type of bullshit comes my way, and I'm the asshole if I use profanity in my reply? 
---
they've been datamined so they are coming
---
I'd like a meat grinder to make special canned food with unique bonuses
---
And tbh, more cooking stations like furnace, blender etc.
---
I'm getting some weird looks by my laughing out loud at this at work.  Well played. :)
---
Nope. Today's maintenance is my issue. The maintenance patch took it from "buggy" to "Unplayable". 
---
My camp is on that same lake! Nice spot ü§ó
---
Based on what? 
---
lmao you salty as fuck. you not even OP. Did someone destroy your little 2x2 wood house? They took all the ghoul kills from that holf club nuke zone.
---
No data. Just want to head it off in advance. 
---
Mods?
---
Yep.
---
I want those four minutes of wasted life expectancy back.
---
I finally finished a hunter/hunted mission. After i killedthe last dude servers closed for maintenance but god wasnt that action sweet as fuck
---
Nope. 
---
GF and I play together on PS4's also. Unfortunately separate living rooms but we both have 70 inch tv's to play on. Headsets really help so we dont lose our voices yelling across the house lol. 
---
Doubt that
---
They're already in the game archives (Silver and golden skins), guess we just need to wait for a while -))
---
Why, in your mind, is it that only the OP on a post is allowed to reply to comments? 
---
And actually yeah, I built a bunker after the tenth random griefer asshat decided to punch through my wall and destroy my shit. 
---
Well people aren't selling them so cheap.
---
I went two weeks of nonstop Whitespring  farming, *only* getting hundreds of 1* and nothing more before I said eff it and started farming other locations. Never going back to that bs location. 
---
I hope they'll make garage doors walls variants first, not only storage metal walls
---
based on other players having no problem at all
---
There were a few threads here a few months back where they did the breakdown.  in my own testing, I saw the same damage as the non-scorched weapon. 
---
Zealots targets Scorched people and things. 
---
Prime targets scorched people, things, SBs and SBQ.
---
SB and SBQs I believe are actually classified as Animals (since they are just the dragons from Skyrim) So Hunters Prime or Anti-armor Prime would be a better option. 
---
Thats where mine is.  I occasionally get mole rats, wolves, dogs, and ferals coming down the hill.  
---
I fenced it, so they usually just bounce along the fence until they get to the edge of the cliff...where they just fall off like lemmings....
---
I did put a turret at either end for anything bigger...
---
You can buy ammo from players if you can't think of anything better. Although it helps to have use for it, too.
---
I believe there is a perk that lets you search corpses for meats.  Butcher something?  It works on corpses that you yourself did not create, so if you found dead ant bodies and used that it should have a chance to work, plus double chances on your own ants you find.
---
But ya, the power substation north of watoga is one I check, but the ants are usually dead by the time I get there.
---
Nope. I used a custom .Ini to fix the "none of my atom shop purchases are showing up" bug, then i deleted that with the update before last update with the "falling through the ground" bug. With the latest "survival" update I completely re-installed the game, and have no mods, no custom ini, no nothing. 
---
What the fuck is there to "doubt" here? 
---
I got the camo pantsuit that way. Some have said you can actually get your atoms back if you e-mail Beth about it.  I'm keeping it to remind me to pay attention
---
It's not that I'm afraid to team up;  I just prefer being the lone wanderer type and have my perks set up accordingly. I also usually just let random invites expire without any type of response; if the person inviting me doesn't send a message explaining why they want to team up, then why should I send a message explaining why I rejected the offer.
---
As with everything in life, however, there are exceptions. If the person asks if they can send an invite and tells me why (even if it is just free fast travel) I'll usually accept.  If I'm doing an event like Line in the Sand and get an invite I'll accept then as well because it's obvious they want to join. In this situation the rewards from completing the event as easily as possible outweigh the benefits of my Lone Wanderer perk.
---
Personally I played full price and totally worth. Got 3 months steady gameplay before I was bored. Worth 16 all day
---
I'd like to take credit.  But it was an insult that the Insult Bot said to me when he cornered me one day in the stairwell down to turning in Tech Data at Camp Venture.
---
Unless you already have unyielding armor, a 1 STR isn't good for PvE, you're going to be incumbered constantly. You obviously don't run SBQ fights or PvP. 3*'s in concentrated fire is a waste, you only get 4% more damage over the 1* at 3%, for the cost of 2 perk point that can be used somewhere else.
---
I carry a lever, a handmade, and a BP rifle, and 2000  .45's last a few days before I'm back to crafting. To be effective against SBQ, you have to have higher AP, and DPS, neither of which a bloodied Lever has. It's easy to run through a 1000+ 5.56 with the handmade, more if I have to carry more of the weight. Bandolier also lets me carry 100 lbs of ammo for 10lbs, instead of taking up valuable stash space. In survival, it would also make you stash bait. 
---
You also don't use explosive weapons, 3 pts in END for fireproof is more important vs SB's and players. 
---
Mister sandman is situational, and for 1/2 of the day, completely a waste of points.
---
Why are you running 3*'s in Critical Savvy and Four leaf clover? One makes the other redundant. If you're 1-shotting everything why waste points in Dead man's sprint? How many times have you needed to kill 20+ mobs in a row?
---
It‚Äôs Y on Xbox.
---
I would for 16, even with it's problems and glitches.
---
Is it unopened?
---
If it's unopened fine, if not make sure that you can actually use the game as the CD key may be in use by him (if it's a physical copy).
---
This is a very useful and informative reply, thanks dude. 
---
Lol. Got those long enough ago not to feel too bad.
---
I am running something like this at the moment and it is really a lot of fun with a few bloodied weapons (have a Moleminer gauntlet and a Death Tambo with +40% attack speed)
---
I have absolutely no survival problems in nukezones with Hazmat suits cause off the defensive perks and mutations, is forced to use a stim/radaway once in awhile, but high rads/low health is where you shine! If low health builds is not for you this is still pretty solid switching the out the mutation and perk that gets affected by this, but you will miss out on some serious damage potential!

Ive never played anything else than stealth sniper in Fallout 4 and 76 before this and i am having a real laugh one shotting pretty much everything out there 
---
I am that guy...the one who buys these and not only will they not line up, they will also have incorrect spelling, grammar, and punctuation.
---
I expect my camp to get destroyed often :)
---
At the main screen of your fo76 Reddit page click the 3 drop down buttons then select change user flair
---
I don't know if they changed anything, but I am going to stick with no. Not safe. Spawn campers will find a way.
---
Most of those reward weapons aren't really great.
---
but the royal welch has fused with the royal regiment of wales to make the royal welsh
---
Absolutely worth it! I bought the Tricentennial Edition on preorder, and have been playing since day one! Even if you solo play through the game, it‚Äôs a blast. Join us in Appalachia!!
---
Now I'm instantly thinking of the howlers from Harry Potter. 
---
Dam I just started work :/ 
---
Oh, definitely, you can find people with caps willing to trade higher.
---
I have I believe 10 copies of the paint in my Stash right now, I will be listing them for sale (one at a time) when player vending comes around to see how much I can get for them.
---
Mine cost 8900 from Watoga Station.  I‚Äôd venture to say he left a zero off...
---
Get it. Yes, fallout 76 has plenty of problems, but I still had fun playing with friends. Plus, I feel like the game will get better in later updates.
---
The game is already better than how it was when it first was released.
---
Far right, just above the quick links, just a bit below the Subscribe/Unsubscribe button, it shows your name with (edit) afterwards.  Click on Edit, select your flair, and click the save button.
---
I had scrounger, cap collector, and can do for about a damned month before I read a thing on Pharma Farma because I was desperate for stimpacks and it mentioned searching. All those missed opportunities!
---
Side note, I got the stimpak recipe and just realized yesterday I was no longer low; I was carrying 29 pounds of the damned things even after the 90% weight reduction. I'm not a bright boy.
---
Mine did last night for the first time. Screen froze. Had to turn off the console.
---
Yeah definitely, I‚Äôd get it if I were you
---
I kinda dislike how you guys keep swapping out old items; this isn‚Äôt Fortnite. There‚Äôs no real reason for exclusivity on anything but holiday items. And I get WHY you do it Bethesda, you‚Äôre preying in FOMO. ‚ÄúBuy it now before it goes away,‚Äù right? How am I supposed to be interested in your shop if any of the items I want aren‚Äôt in the store anymore, and I have no idea when they will come back?
---
Glad I could help
---
The map in the enclave shows the active fissures and silos, the power plants show the substations and powered workshops, and of course the train stations as above.
---
Give me 3 perk saved load outs:
---
* Adventure
---
* Combat
---
* At Home
---
Make them accessible through the favorite wheel.
---
That's all I really need, more would be better but that's like the bare minimum to alleviate most of my issue with it.
---
Yes. That's what you did. Super fucking useful. 
---
I didn‚Äôt say anything degrading your opinion. That‚Äôs the difference
---
Yeah but he was talking about player vending, where you are not individually accepting each trade prior. I do hope they thought about that when it drops.
---
The end game is still a bit lacking, but there's at least 30-40 hours worth of main story content. If you enjoyed FO4 I'm pretty sure you'll get $16 worth of fun out of 76.
---
That may be so, but if I get a lock picking card out of a perk pack the duplicate card just vanishes, effectively giving me one less perk card with that perk pack. Also having more options is always nice.
---
I finally sorted this, and it was as simple as, well, can you say BUG?
---
With the stored camp selected, along the bottom there was an 'R' for recycle but it was GREYED OUT. Guess what, even though it was, I tried it this AM and bingo, it decoupled everything and the bits all ended up individual.
---
I lost my water purifiers and all my crops, but oh well, such is life. At least I got to recreate my camp. I did nuke the PowerArmor station, I think that's the sucker that caused it to have problems.
---
Spoopy place that made me piss myself
---
Awesome! Yes, Butcher's Bounty, I think? I will try that. Thank you!
---
Is there another surefire spot for ants? I know the little ankle biters pester the shit out of me during SBQ fights but that's about it.
---
I think, based on the in game currency and how easy is it to achieve, the actual prices are probably right, but, if you decide to use real world money to buy atoms, you should get, as a rough quick example, twice as much as you do currently. That would make it worth purchasing atoms without devaluing the current in game rewards.
---
I‚Äôve probably not explained that as well as I want to, but the Atom Shop has potential, it‚Äôs just not balanced right yet.
---
I know right
---
I agree, I think they are one of the things you overcome on your way to getting something good. It‚Äôs more of an environmental thing, rather than a boss battle every time. 
---
all for it
---
You shut your mouth!!
---
I don't think you understood his post.
---
He can hit multiple enemies with one critical.....
---
Right? What‚Äôs the point of him if all he does is that._
---
Found you! 
---
And we shall call it...Goldshire.
---
Adding this level of realism would not be a qol update for me, would be a hassle that forces me to scrounge for resources more often or my camp shuts off.
---
Thank you! I've got a lovely instigating railway rifle and about 300 spikes weighing me down
---
So nice of you to say
---
Yeah I went in with power armor to test it you basically fall and then teleport back up
---
Yeah, I thought that as well, but we see buildings powered for over a century on fusion cores. 
---
Maybe things that just require power (that only have the lightning bolt with no number) don't drain power but things that do have that number drain that amount over time.  Hang all the lights you want but that water purifier will eventually exhaust your fuel/core.
---
YES. Especially for dirty water, ugh. 
---
Im level 40 and I still don't have starched genes. I lost marsupial because of this.
---
Only I'm not stating an opinion. I stated a fact, the system IS smaller than fallout 4's smallest settlement, the build limit IS lower. 
---
What‚Äôs your Instagram name my friend? I had a few new followers which took me by surprise so I want to find you! Don‚Äôt worry, I can help you along with posting üôÇ
---
Funny thing is it's lighter than a skeleton build handmade rifle
---
That‚Äôs crazy you have to push a 2nd button to use scrounger. It should be automatic while looting. Oh well...I have ammosmith and super duper now. 
---
Wow lucky guy.  He‚Äôs only just stood there to me.
---
I think I've seen them occasionally around Appalachia Antiques NW of Watoga and the Lost Home SW of Watoga.  But never 100% (checked both yesterday with zero results).  Other than those spots I cannot recall, beyond the random spawns during Prime Nukes.  But until now I never really sought them.  And they always annoyingly popped up when I was just traveling thru the Bog areas before brewing made me actually want to find them.
---
Ran uranium fever, got 3 2* drops from a 2* and 2 3*s. Think your just having bad luck. Try staying on same server for a while, maybe initial spawns just lacked and respawns have more.
---
Well for Adventure I‚Äôve been on servers that there was literally only a couple of people playing. 
---
Commenting so I can find out as well!
---
Going to have a look soon! Might upgrade my place now!
---
It‚Äôs worth the full $60 I paid for it. 
---
The faster reload perk would also be nice for it 
---
Perk Decks, they are cards after all. 
---
Same üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I just like to think of the advice my dad gave me on my wedding day.  He said "Son, you might not always be fighting ghouls, but you can always be drunk."  A wise man, my father.
---
so if you have a 4\* and a 1\*, and want a 2\* and a 4\*, you have to rank up to a 5\* then a 4\* then a 2\*? that sucks
---
I‚Äôd rather kill myself. I got them for free in FO4 and I could build more/multiple places. I don‚Äôt want to grind for what I used to have..
---
wtf lol, never noticed that. I only really use a TSE dragon I have, but that should probably be fixed too. It apparently has a bayonet slot but isn't craftable and I have never found one in stores. It's probably the same as a bunch of other items in the game, with some kind of hidden "attachment" lowering the stats that isn't modifiable
---
I do this to myself already. Plan a build from the start and stick to it. I find it more enjoyable, plus I‚Äôm not huge on the the whole ‚Äúmaximizing‚Äù stuff I just wanna enjoy a RP play.
---
That being said, hacking and Lockpicking are a pet peeve. I will switch those in and out because I hate being barred from loot lol 
---
Hey, I liked my blue door, but since I converted all my steel walls to brick, hadda get one of the fancy wood ones.  Sighhhhhhh.  Bethesda better know all the financial support we are giving them.  If the untouchables stash box goes on sale tomorrow, I'm gonna throw my pumpkin away.
---
Nah it all RNG. I got lucky and ran into a 3 star protectron that spawned right next to phoenix. Then I moved on to survival mode to finish weekly challenge and had no legendary spawn for me during 150 crits
---
I have had a painted excavator armor and my X01 in my inventory at the same time ever since the excavator paint was released.  And before that I had an Atom painted X01 and my regular Excavator for months.
---
Sure hope so. Unloaded a bunch of one and two stars at vendor bots yesterday and today haven‚Äôt seen any, it was like oops lol 
---
I swear I got shielded raider from Rose as a reward.  Learned it and couldn‚Äôt craft it :(
---
Oh my god, relationship goals or what?! I love this! My boyfriend has just come round to the idea we NEED two TVs so we can both game. He mainly plays on his switch but I think I could tempt him with 76 if I got another PS4.
---
I love that you are both raiders as well! Awesome idea :)
---
Sweet! well done. If you think about it perks and mutations are just in-game cheats so running it without either is difficult level hard / very hard. 
---
Wonder how hard it would be to do the same thing without power armor?
---
If you want to fight over workshops, go play in survival mode.  Those of us not interested in PVP shouldn't be forced into it to keep a generator running.  
---
I‚Äôve been trying to level up my alternate character it‚Äôs been a pain it used to be so easy a few months ago 
---
And I agree, I stated earlier that it is not a settlement
---
Do story, do events. If its your first play through I would recommend not rushing. Enjoy the story. Endgame content isn't out yet.
---
I'm away from my computer (haven't loaded the app on my phone yet), but I believe I used spriggitleaf as my username.
---
I'd like the servers to be reliable, two times in a row now I've been disconnected after launching a nuke.
---
I never thought of them removing learned plans. Let‚Äôs hope when we go Legendary we get to keep everything. 
---
If us high level players reset our stats where can we store all of our Ammo and Chems/Meds? Need perks to hold all that stuff and can‚Äôt store any of it in the stash do to it having weight in there (for completely arbitrary game design reasons). Hmm. 
---
You can craft rippers at 40 or 50. I believe I've seen level 50 legendary rippers dropping too. Drill is locked to 20 tho, and buzz blade I believe starts from 15 and goes up to 45
---
It's possible something didn't update properly on your side due to glitchy internet maybe. Just do a Scan and Repair and 99% chance that would fix it.
---
I already have multiple Vendor Characters; Weapons, Armor, Aid, &amp; Plans, and each has their Shop, but since Bethesda hasn't really shared any details on how the Player Vending will work, I haven't done anything different to prepare.
---
My Weapons and Armor characters have been at or near their weight limits for a while, so when I get good items to put on them I sometimes have to remove lesser legendary items to accommodate the new stuff, which has led to building a very impressive inventory.
---
I sell the better Legendary stuff to other players, and also buy or trade for things when I have the room for it, but for now I'm just going about my usual routines &amp; waiting to see what develops.
---
 I don't have time to read everything so maybe this has already been suggested.  There could be a toggle that allows you to have an unlimited number of perk cards active at one time.  You would just tag all the cards you want active in this mode.  While in this mode you can't run, draw a weapon, or loot anything.  The moment you do either it is deactivated and will return to your base load out.  I am probably missing some other obvious restrictions.  
---
He didn't say much more than I just did, we don't know if we will get random items or if we can choose. All he did add is it will give players choice
---
Hey, you may have found this out by now, but you have to learn the paint plan before the next level drops. 
---
Same here.  If there were no consequences for being drunk and doing stupid shit, I would always be drunk and do stupid shit haha
---
It's the same with all the Search Perks.  Pharma, Can Do, Cap Collector, etc.  You can Search the containers to find more stuff.  They do not affect what ever you find initially in them.
---
I vote no (can I vote more than once?).
---
You should have some high level buddies, have them power level you through whitesprings.
---
This is exactly it, and even if you already have a 5* it wants to level the 4* you have into another 5*
---
You will never be able to have a 5*, 4*, and 3* for example.
---
Just because _you_ are happy with a stripped down, anemic building system when they promised a _better_ system doesn't mean the rest of us should be. 
---
Strange,  i have never ran into anything like this, zero legendary encounters across more than 10 servers. 
---
Prestige that allows me to respec  my main the way I want sounds good to me! I would like them to elaborate on what the benefits will be!
---
I would just like to be able to save a few builds that would auto swap based on said saves.   Weapon maintenance build, construction build, hacker build, etc.  You are still forced to select and swap cards, but you can quickly return to a saved build in one click instead of moving the cards individually each time.
---
It's a mod for the weapon.  You can find the weapon at the Tyler County Fairgrounds, it's a Commy Whacker, usually find them at the Whack-a-Mole game machines.
---
Yeah Bethesda, it's hard for the 3 people left playing this dumpster fire to be on at the same time.
---
That is even worse!
---
I‚Äôm sorry, I don‚Äôt know anything about it, except that I want one! Just the name makes it sound amazing!! I hope you‚Äôre able to get it sorted out. 
---
That's some useful advice. I'm currently about ten minutes into that process. Fingers crossed. 
---
Same goes for the Butcher's Bounty perk, I just found this out yesterday. 
---
I'm only a week into playing the game with more food than I know what to do with, so this by no means hurt my gameplay.
---
Exactly! 
---
Actually, it is. A role playing game is a game where the player controls the actions of a character or party in a well defined world and the term started with pen and paper RPG‚Äôs. You‚Äôre trying to make the terminology more complicated than it is.
---
It‚Äôs simply about playing a role in a world and deciding what your character does. So yes, even Rygar would qualify. 
---
Really? I‚Äôve heard that the story doesn‚Äôt dish out as much xp as fallout 4 and the other ones. I‚Äôve read old pre-patch articles saying that monster killing is the way to go.
---
Do places like white springs still work?
---
YouTube vertibot leveling you‚Äôll be lvl 50 in a day
---
yeah, i know, been waiting like crazy for the silver with gold one :)
---
Love my handmade, best rifle in the game, lol
---
Other things - why are there 3 cards for lock picking and 3 for hacking (and some others). Why not just make them one card with 3 stars. 
---
Can you source Nything about what a legendary character is ? Or who brought it up? 
---
Me too! Bethesda would make so much money off me
---
Level 110 +/-.  Aside from occasional armor pieces that are side-grades or situational, I've gotten no weapon upgrades since just after level 50 (which was All Rise, which disappeared on me a week or two ago).
---
Picked up an AA explosive pump action shotty yesterday.  First really OK weapon.  I'm sniper, but I'll find a way to work it into my rotation.  
---
I'm not thrilled with the damage level right now, but it's decent.  I've got around 9 perk card choices saved up, I'll throw a few of those into shotgun stuff and see how it goes.  
---
(Predicting self-immolation in the first 5 minutes tonight :P )
---
I stopped playing because I was spending too much time changing perks back and forth. Soooo tedious!
---
A better alternative is just to wear *** armor that provides a reduction in weapon weight. I believe every weight reduction combo (perks and legendary armor effects) caps at a total of 90% reduction. But then weightless weapons can multiply that again to reach 1% of their total weight (+ attachments), and weightless armor can weigh 0 because lightweight mods are additive (or subtractive?) in this case
---
A commie whacker is a whack-a-mole type weapon. Never heard it called a spanker though lol what language do you play in? Is it English?
---
This is spot on. I don‚Äôt recommend rushing either, as endgame is pretty bleh right now. But running through the story, and any events you find, are the best ways. 
---
Do you need a hug? To come into a sub about a specific game and post on someone‚Äôs lovely celebratory post about love and video games make me thing you are a very sad person. 
---
I would love the bounty system too and the mugger system from gtao. 
---
It‚Äôs hard to say it it‚Äôs worth it for anyone else. Personally, I love it, over 550hrs in and still can‚Äôt put it down. I got it for $50 and have spent about $30 on in game purchases, and I feel it‚Äôs totally been worth it. Just don‚Äôt expect the typical single player story experience, and don‚Äôt treat it like a typical pvp multiplayer either. It‚Äôs something of a unique and mostly friendly experience. 
---
So... Do you needme to balance your humours and adjust your chakras or what? 
---
Yeah it's  a terrible design choice.  But I stopped using it anyway because even when you learn to use it, it's pretty unproductive even with it maxed out. 
---
In fallout 4, it meant finding more ammo in containers- ALL containers including desks, file cabinets etc.    It made it possible to live in power armor and use a Gatling laser as main weapon because you would find 3-4 fusion cores in an ammo box. 
---
Scrounger in this game almost never yields fusion cores. 
---
The bayonet does exist. Found a mod for it out in the wild. 
---
Lol playing to many different games
---
Listen I agree you know how long it is to grind for some atoms 
---
What about you have to get to an owned bed to swap out perk loadouts?  So, I climb in bed at camp and wake up the next day ready to craft and then I can sleep again and wake up to head out and explore.  And the ability to have perk decks/profiles to swap in and out, of course, so as to make it easy, but with the sleeping thing makes it more static and functional than just random swapping whenever.
---
Been playing since release and I had no idea. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I've been suggesting presets for perk cards for a while now.  If we could have card sets on a quick wheel like items, it would make this so much less tedious with minimal coding effort.
---
You seem to be the only one affected. 
---
Sounds like you‚Äôve invented a problem that doesn‚Äôt exist in your head and are trying to get people wound up. Why would they have you relearn plans? Doesn‚Äôt make much sense. 
---
I have an instigating one that I will probably prime, but I also want an automatic one because it's hilarious so I will hope to find a quad, AA, or some other useful prefix. 
---
He said something to you? He‚Äôs been after me twice and both times just followed me saying nothing lol
---
‚Ä¶ "everything is a roleplaying game".
---
the end.
---
Nope. Bullshit. pen and paper rpgs always had stats that defined the playstyle, and players were always rewarded for playing their characters role, separate from their own abilities and knowledge as a player.
---
I'm old... every single role playing rulebook out there had a section at the front that explained the difference between player and character. Meta-gaming was always seen as cheesy.
---
Again... zaxxon is not a roleplaying game in which you play the role of a spaceship fighter pilot, and pac-man is not a roleplaying game in which you play the role of a pill munching circle. 
---
Your time will come one day. Don‚Äôt give up :)
---
Like what u/tharored said, it's a mod for the commie whacker
---
Hmm, I've had multiple atom shop paintjob armor sets. Never had that happen before
---
&gt;Any other places where this corpse may spawn at?
---
You still don't, there's oil and fusion cores everywhere, I sell like 10 bulk oil every day
---
Also, the rate of consumption changes the entire discussion, it doesn't have to be a lot, just something that balances the ability to craft other things as some kind of investment cost, such as running hydroponics or terreriums for growing fungus
---
For a dragon or black powder rifle? I've seen a few bayonets for the rifle, but not for the dragon
---
Again, not everything is for everybody.
---
Some challenges are great for low level and not high. Some for high and not low. Some better for groups. 
---
Dude... you don't have to 100% everything. Chill a bit. Let other people have their own thing, too.
---
Yeah no....
---
Ok. i had to do some research on you. So i looked at the comments, op seems pretty cool and mellow. I look at your history and you like to argue with people. So you just a salty little fuck is all. Happy to oblige in this keyboard fisticuffs. 
---
I had a guy that wanted to destroy my camp with his tse gat. He was mad cause i killed him for his 1k bounty. I simply server hopped. Repairing stuff doesnt take much resources at all. If people are repeatedly attacking you, you probably provoke them. Seeing how you conduct yourself in your post would lead me to think that. You get wanted often? Maybe it's a PC thing. People dont attack camps a lot on PS4. I dont even see golf course farmng camps getting griefed.
---
So now on to the matter of the foundation bunkers. I dont support them because you can not destroy foundations. Round camps can be destroyed. They arent a glitches btw. Just cleavering measuring of spaces. Floating camps, now there are 2 types. There is the 1 foundation, 1 stair, type floating camps. They can be destroyed. There is also my style of true floating camps that doesnt contact the ground at all. I assure you, that can also be 100% destroyed.
---
If foundations can be destroyed, I would support foundation bunkers. But they cant, so I dont. People use them to camp out locations on survival and kill.
---
F 
---
my dude i play on survival and i agree with the guy .
---
And yet, here you are, participating in a forum dedicated to that same dumpster fire. Go figure.
---
He has burned me twice now, it just takes him a minute to spit something rude (and hilarious) out
---
Its part of the users flair and it is free
---
Bruh I ditched my entire railway rifle build when I saved all my 50 perk points when I was told this was intended. This is why we need a full respec system, so I can get back those 50 levels.
---
Worth it + .  I got it for half price. I like it a lot.  I like it so much, the money I saved I spent in the Atom shop as my way to support the developers. 
---
Are there any specific places I can go to level up quick directly out of the vault?
---
Yup but I reckon you'll be waiting for fallout with that
---
* Monster killing is good IF you have someone high level escorting you through an area with lots of enemies way higher level than you. Doing it solo, just isn't worth the amount of time and resources you'll put into trying to kill things.
---
* Quests aren't as huge EXP-wise as FO4, but they're still good.
---
* Leveling my alt was fine, take workshops (for the steady stream of "Defend the workshop" events) and then just do quests, while detouring to nearby events when possible.
---
Once you get to a high-ish level, like 40, if you get a couple of good legendaries for your build, you could start venturing into higher level areas and reliably taking things out before you're overwhelmed / without wasting all day trying to kill mobs.
---
I prefer bloodletting but whatever gets the job done
---
I agree. Someone coming in and destroying your camp if you team with them shouldn't be a mechanic of this game. Should be a separate permission or mode for this. I believe that would eliminate a large swath of this fear. For a game that promotes teaming and having fun rebuilding a world, often with strangers, thats a disincentive.
---
U
---
Sure, but that usually happens when you stay on it for long, and eventually new players aren't joining in as the server is getting faded, so it's just you and if you leave, the server instance is gone.
---
It's dynamic.
---
F
---
Glad this is being addressed. Too bad I ditched my railway rifle build months ago when they said this was intended. :(
---

I was for a while, now I fire up Spotify with some Post Modern Jukebox.
---
My guess is that it will function like the fermenter, in the way that you put something into it, set your price and collect caps later. I‚Äôm confident that we‚Äôll be able to add and remove at will, with a possible weight limit. I highly doubt it will be separate from our stash, as that would tax the server quite a bit with everyone having a vending machine. 
---
If I personally had to choose between extra storage and server stability, I‚Äôd pick stability no question.
---
I can guarantee you'll benefit more from shared perks and Stranger in Numbers end game when you get to mutations with class freak. Not to mention the other benefits. Lone Wanderer is fine, but it's not even close to equivalent later.
---
Can you fix the servers on PC, I‚Äôve been dumped two times in a row after launching a nuke. So much time, effort, and supplies to kill a queen wasted.
---
Did the new questline come with this? Not the short Nukashine one but the Criptid quest thing.
---
Also, it takes a few seconds after you hit search for it to show anything extra. So, it's possible to hit space bar, see nothing new walk away and then have the extra item load into the container. You have to watch for the animation to know if it's worked. 
---
I getcha, and I wasn't saying I support it...but at the same time, it is a different game.  So you're not really "getting back stuff you had."
---
Still, I really hope they keep adding new stuff for CAMPs (as that is like the best part of the game for me), and hopefully a good amount of those additions are free finds like the other plans in the game.
---
I'm a similar sniper and do the same thing.  It helps me get more XP by downing those, and if nothing is around, then I start chipping away at the Queen.  I figure every bit helps, and my .50/.45 ammo is cheap to make.
---
That‚Äôs awesome info. Will have to try it next time I do One Violent Night. Do you know if the regular chained hits all help fill the crit meter? Like if the chain hits 3 ghouls, do you get the same amount added to your crit meter as if you had hit 3 separately?
---
ha ha ha. Mods doing anything on this forum. Good one
---
I often dump my extra supplies there. Watoga train station suitcase is another place I like to leave goodies. 
---
I have only run into Insult Bot one time. I found a new player by Morgantown Station, and drank a vintage nuka with him, wished him good luck, and then I ended up in the bog. While shooting a bunch of dogs, the bot started walking up to me. He assured me that I was about to be insulted. And then he stared at me. For a long time. So I walked away, and he continued following me, telling me to prepare to be insulted, only to stare at me silently whenever he caught up. This went on for like 20 minutes.
---
They need to make a fallout 5 and if they end up making it online, just make it a co-op thing or something. We don't need servers to join, just make a badass storyline and out-do themselves from what they've done in the past.
---
Totally cool with me. We don't even have to talk or be on the same part of the map. I've often teamed and never said a word to anyone, still shown up to help with camp building, a particularly tough battle, or just spawned in and dropped some loot. I think you're missing out on some potential fun and a different experience but I recognize that isn't for everyone. It just sucks that so many people play alone out of fear because a small part of the population sucks or certain mechanics aren't perfect. 
---
Lay down,
---
Try not to cry,
---
Cry...
---
A lot
---
I bought it from Watoga station for a little over 200 caps. I made mine and it's awesome for a sniper build. If anyone wants me to build them one just bring the materials.
---
Not trying to cause drama. Just want to raise my wants before design/blueprint because undoing it later in the cycle would be harder.  
---
If you're a low level I recommend going to the ski resort. Super mutants are a great way for xp 
---
Line in the Sand event at Fort Defiance gives you 2 cores when you complete it. 
---
Your OPINION is that ‚Äúrebuilding Appalachia‚Äù is player towns and persistent builds. Your OPINION is a ‚Äúpromised better building system‚Äù they never said any of this shit. 
---
You took two words and built your own idea off of it. It was never said you were gonna be able to build a multi-person town. 
---
You deluded yourself and are salty about it 
---
I have a separate thing I want to say in regards to your stagger suggestion. Pistols totally need some stagger. 25% is too high though. A 10mm auto pistol shoots about 7 rounds per second. That would be nearly two staggers in just over one second of shooting. The .38 auto pistol seems to shoot even faster than that. Stagger would need to be maybe 15% to be balanced. 25% staggers on the fourth bullet. 15% would be on the sixth or seventh bullet leaving about 6 to 5 bullets for actual damage against sentinel users. The average clip size is around 12 for 10mm pistols.
---
Your link isn't working 
---
Fair, but I will always rush to defend my teammates workshop. I want those plans too. You can have whatever resources are in your workshops. I also have about 3k 5.56 ammo I don't use that I would normally just give a portion of to someone if they asked. So...you never know...
---
Anyone else having their challenges glitching out? I have 3 "Discover locations in X" stuck at 4/5 and I found all the locations. 
---
Yeah it drives me crazy, especially with no way to recoup the card if you accidentally duplicate the 5*
---
Maybe junk is needed way more now than fallout 4.
---
Sux, but highest probaility of a crash is in a nuke zone...at least fir me.  Never lost stuff tho!
---
Stealth is a big part of my build and I never considered this. Is there any reason you go by this rule. Are you prejudiced against Ninjas?
---
I am not familiar with it, how does it work?
---
Shiet man that sux 
---
Same douche different thread 
---
Don‚Äôt buy them. Problem solved. 
---
"salty little fuck" That's cute, though my blood salt levels would probably agree with you. "Arguing with idiots on the internet" is a hobby though, for sure, and while the game validates (and this godamn rain keeps falling) my options for entertainment are limited. 
---
Honestly, in game I interact with just about no one. I don't do PVP, I don't attack bases, I don't challenge workshops. I grind for legendary gear, hunt for blueprints, build my base, work on challenges, etc. Unless it's some, as you say "salty little asshole" from reddit who sees my name in game, it's inevitably just some douchebag griefer. (And hey, I call em out in here all the time, because sociopaths make me angry, so yeah, they MIGHT hunt me down in game? Could be). 
---
I think I've been wanted 3 times, twice for that fucking moronic "Get the supply drop" trap quest. Once for picking a lock on a safe in a workshop. 
---
And that objection makes sense _in survival_. I'm a pacisfist player in adventure mode, and I built my base half because I wanted to have to spend less time repairing my shit from Scorch beast attacks, and half because there's no decent "concrete wall" building set for my pump house.   
---
Shit, my build still has a "normal door" which "isn't locked". So human players can walk right in and destroy my shit, if they want to be fucking douchebags about it. Or do what's intended and help themselves to my water purifiers. 
---
Darn....then i would give up the shotgun.  I have what I think is a nice sniper rifle, and it fits how I actually play moreso than using a shotgun as a primary weapon. That may be a good first step, and free up some weight
---
Comment saved. I'll add you to my friends list.
---
maybe it works differently if the mod needs flux. as you can see from other posters apparently there are disagreements to how mods work. I honestly never paid much attention to them and the few I did try before I stopped caring were the plain ones that needed steel and such and when you have hundreds its hard to notice if a handful vanish.
---
And his junk is better than the "prize".
---
Same here the first time, eventually he spit out a terrible insult, like an hour later. It was great and all the extra time he took following me just made me laugh harder 
---
Thanks for the info! 
---
Please google ‚Äúrole playing game‚Äù and take note of all the sources that agree with me and also of how wrong you are. I‚Äôll no longer be replying to this pointless conversation. 
---
Only one way to find out and that‚Äôs experimentation. Try out crits with and without the perk active. Scorch beasts would be easiest, since you can easily build up crits on the scorched spawns and they have enough health where you likely won‚Äôt kill them outright unless you have a high end instigating or anti armor weapon.
---
It's a post-apocalyptic survival game
---
Lead.
---
Steel is plentiful in the wasteland through scrapping.  More so than any other resource.
---
Actually, one of the to many count press releases, (and fuck knows if I could find it or not) someone promised a better building system that would let you "re build Appalachia". It was one of the things that had me even remotely interested in this forced online experiment. 
---
Fair point. I have tried this in the past. I usually write something like "Hey, would you mind teaming? I've got the herd mentality mutation and if you're a mutant we can get some stat bonuses. Also, my base is near... so you can fast travel cheaper." However, it has not worked to this point and it's become faster just to go with the RNGeezus approach to teaming.
---
Awesome, good to know, thanks. Now I just hope when I run into one in the wild, it's at least polite enough to let me change into my clown suit before mauling me.
---
How many caps will you pay me to hit you a few times with this rusty machete? 
---
For sure I spent the last month solo but bumpped into a team I work with now. It's a complete different game and honestly I wish people were up for more team fun.
---
Eventually he does spit out a very deadpan insult
---
As many as you want
---
Yeah, I'm fine with the crashes...kinda expect them to do it every time so that doesn't bug me at all. Its the none of the goodies came with me part that gave me the FML
---
"Remember, its not a flaw...its a feature!" - Bethesda
---
Lead and junk are often the go to. But everyone has their preference on what‚Äôs valuable. 
---
Yeah good idea
---
Its there
---
I have a brewing room in the back the left side of the bar. The only way in is that blue switch in the bar, and there's also a switch in the brewing room itself. You can kinda see where the vault boy concrete statue is.
---
Yeah but FOMO is the entire reason and has been proven to work
---
Grognaks axe needs to be fixed as well.
---
You're right, [I never read the images](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019). I normally gloss over them.
---
Whichever you build on, you will regret it and lack the other. 
---
I'd build on steel and do Lucky Hole mine runs in excavator armor once-a-month to meet your lead needs. Alternately you might need to build on acid to process all that lead ore. You'll also need lots of plastic to bulk all that lead while you wait for enough steel to make the ammo. You'll be grinding either way. On second thought, maybe you ought to just switch to melee and put your CAMP wherever you want. Good luck. 
---
I do believe there is one for the dragon. I might be confusing it with the black powder rifle in my stash, but I'm almost certain my dragon has a bayonet on it. 
---
Yeah, cause it definitely isn‚Äôt anywhere in the original post. With exact directions. 
---
I agree with the camp thing being a problem. I will say, I'm the initiator of pretty much all random team invites and no one to this point has tried to destroy my camp. I get it though, if you're burnt once, you become reluctant. I think there should be a separate mechanic for who is allowed to edit the camp. To be fair, I've had  random people I've not been teamed with decide to Two-Shot Fat Man my camp. Crap shoot with strangers on the interwebs.
---
That just means the stuff wasn‚Äôt goo enough for you. And the universe was like nah dawg I got better stuff go you. 
---
I‚Äôve seen insult bot like a half dozen times and all it says is waaaiit, hoooold it, and stop. I‚Äôm happily waiting to get roasted but it‚Äôs yet to happen.
---
Damn. Level 171 and I have legit never seen one
---
I see your point, my build is efficient on bullets tho. Steel is more abundant than steel in my opinion. :o
---
PS4. It isn't so much difficult as it's can take a minute for one of the steps in building it. Figuring out how to do it was the painful part, but knowing how to do it now, it's not that hard.
---
Yeah, I've tried to be strategic. I'll look for someone at Whitesprings, doing an event, fighting an SB, etc., but it doesn't have a better success rate for me yet. Same with messaging. Granted, small sample size and anecdotal so I'll keep tweaking my approach. Generally though, it's so much faster to just canvas the map with invites to get one acceptance. 
---
On pc I recommend perk loadput manager. You get 8 slots to setup preset load outs. 
---
Because of limutations you have to set it up using a text ini file, but it's essential to me. 
---
If Bethesda would just add that as a vanilla feature (and saving load outs in game obs) it would be awesome. 
---
One place to get a lot of steel quickly is West Tek; kill all the super mutants, then scrap their guns, and use the Scrapper card if you have it.
---
Well the good thing is post level 50 you can swap SPECIAL points around as you level up so starting a new character is not necessary.
---
If you give me an idea how you want to play, and what is important to you, I can help you out with a build.
---
And there is, as far as I know, one spot in the map where you can get both a lead and steel extractor in your CAMP.  I have only found this single one.  It's not a very pretty spot though, up in the Toxic Valley and kind of ugly looking.
---
I'm a lvl 95 and STILL like watching them go boom. I'm a pyro at heart
---
Yea. Taps and the keurig machines would be great. At least once we're able to place items from our stash as decorations, I can perhaps make a wine rack and place some ashtrays and bottles everywhere.
---
I met the bot once and it kept saying ‚ÄúPreparing insult‚Äù
---
Ah yes, the sanctimonious low-road. "I do not agree, therefore I will act as though I am better than you". Thanks for the laugh.
---
Now, if you''ll excuse, I have a date with that epic role playing game... "Space invaders".
---
They're so gross. It's good to combat shotgun them in the faceml.
---
I tend to run out of lead.
---
Yeah if you made many silver and bethesda accounts I suppose that should work. 
---
Could someone explain it to me everytime ive seen it it just keep yelling hold up, stop wait a second and other stuff
---
White springs elitists, any nuke not dropped on WS is a waste of a nukeüòÖ
---
Along with pharma farma, can-do, and cap-collector (now that cap stashes aren't treated like loot nodes).
---
I think the only "automatic" one is green thumb since plants aren't containers.
---
...or it said  "Watch this, it will be funny"
---
If you don‚Äôt let insult bot near you he becomes a robo companion that can Toto you
---
Lol! Seems like I suffered alot of consequences when I was younger! Wish I could blame my current state of stupidity on alcohol.  I'm just old.
---
I had never seen him before until last night and he roasted me twice. I was like man, this is definitely a monday.
---
Umm. You lost me on " Steel is more abundant than steel". 
---
yep.  Thou I do have some duplicates If I dont want to run max level for whatever reason.  Which brings up ANOTHER observation.  If I wanted to run level 1, 2 or 3 of one perk, I would need 6 cards!!!  You cant bump the level up or down, which increases the clutter and need for more cards.  That seems silly too, IMO
---
Super Mutants can be a bit of a bullet sponge; shooting them in the head helps alot.
---
As far as radscorpions go, blow their stinger off and they become easy mode.
---
Every mob has a weak point. Helps to know where it is.
---
I would take lead over steel everytime. As its easier to find scrap steel all over than it is to find scrap lead.
---
I did, picked up a little as well.  If I have to go back there I will bring my better guns. I only had a little time to get through the quest and only had a 38 automatic combat rifle and a combat shotgun, but I am a rifle build without PA.  Luckily I had a black powder rifle, over 300 damage but slow as hell.  Plus I found some places that had good cover, and chameleon armor. 
---
Really got lucky. 
---
Oops, steel is more abundant than lead üòÇ
---
Oh yea, white picket fence with my brick house would look sweet! Of course it is an apocalyptic hell hole... maybe my place shouldn't look quite that sweet, lol.
---
Well we did get a swedish flag from the but yeah I'd like a giant Cuban flag for my house. 
---
uhhyup!  That's me. 'Ole C.B. himself.
---
Lol. The funny thing with just the counter is that it's really not using any bugs whatsoever, but the walls hanging from the ceiling are indeed floating. Those took some time to line up at the height I wanted them at.
---
Any of this would work.
---
Same thing at Grafton Steel. 
---
Mutants can't read.
---
Yeh I couldn‚Äôt find that original post else I woulda just asked on there.

I paid 60 and put in 100 hours.

I can't just leave the bar unattended!
---
Eventually, after following you around forever he will spit out a well thought out and personally wounding insult.
---
It just takes him a while to target you
---
I will be offering my prized collection with rarest at the highest price and most common at the lowest.
---
Alternatively I will put the prices high as possible to show off my collection with no fear of it being bought off.
---
He is slow, but the insult at the end is mighty
---
What's your GT and when will you be hosting?!
---
Or anywhere with enemies that carry guns, as scrapping them with the Scrapper Perk can yield between 10 and 20 scrap each.
---
Depending on server lag it can take ages so annoying
---
You don't understand that challenges give you free money. If you want to buy a skin and you can't complete the challenge because your friends don't play, you have to spend money to buy extra atoms. This is a very dumb argument in regards to paid currency.
---
Say that to Virgil, bet he rips your arm of and points out your ignorance 
---
Fair 'nuf, but have you been to the Lucky Hole mine? If you have a keen eye to see the lead deposits, you won't want for lead for a very long time. Now whether you have stash space for that much (heavy) lead is another issue. 
---
i forget the name of what happened to u but it took you back to the previous save prior to u getting to WS
---
That's a swiss flag. Sweeden is blue with a yellow cross.
---
Right! My pun game was off, long day at work and all.
---
Yes! Great suggestion!
---
1k caps? That‚Äôs a bargain. I‚Äôm selling a set but for 5k. 
---
Lmao old school
---
And eventually you will have more bullets than you ever need and not need either of those resources, but then be wishing you had a Junk Pile instead.
---
GT is jacobjtl - tonight starting around 8pm EST! Just join my world and FT to overseer's camp. We're right next to it! 
---
Honestly have never needed to do that for lead :o I hoard junk so I get a lot of lead anyway üòÅ
---
Good luck, honestly the highest anyone would pay is 3k 
---
If i seen your name in game i would destroy your camp too. The way you carry yourself on reddit is horrible. You seem like some unstable emotion controlled brat. You try to make yourself seem cool and mellow witht he whole "arguing is a hobby of mine" but it isnt. If it is, you are bad at it.
---
You should get a new hobby. Maybe yoga.
---
Yes you have a point there.
---
They are under maintenance. Relax
---
Awesome I won't be on tonight but if you guys do this tomorrow I'll come by!
---
I think that's what threw me off initially, I got Green Thumb in my first card pack and just assumed the others were the same.
---
It might be because Green Thumb guarantees extra plants, whereas the other perks offer a chance at extra loot.
---
I don't think it ever really went away.  A friend of mine relocated back in Patch 6, and all his farm plants duplicated like crazy.
---
Lol, my site has both lead and junk. So im good. Hehe
---
That would actually be dope, Vault 76 could be an independent force, choosing whoever to fight against or just laying low, while BOS, Enclave and whatever else fight it out among themselves. Would totally play the hell out of that kind of survival mode, it‚Äôs just harder when there‚Äôs many different factions, having one-side uneven versus the other would suck.
---
Built mine on lead. I use two handmade so I go through a lot of bullets. Steel is far more plentiful. 
---
I would say lead, unless word comes out about them implementing ammo scraping.
---
Sorry man. The crashes are severely demotivating and still all too frequent. 
---
I sold a previous one for 7k and one other at 5
---

I love the concrete package!

I'm always down to trade plans and recipes especially C.A.M.P. ones.  GT:  TheRealCoolios
---
Toxic Valley, South of the crashed space station area?  One of my friends is there, and it's the only spot I know of that you can access both of them at the same time that isn't a workshop.
---
This shows you how good American schools are lol.
---
Interesting, because when I reloaded in it was exactly where the game crashed right in front of the golf pro shop.
---
This video has been helping me as well.
---
Now it seems there's 10 locations that it spawns in.
---
I've also found the Trick-or-treater corpse from the video. Found skeleton costume plans!
---
Fixes this week, new content next week.
---
Cool I didn‚Äôt know the reenactor could spawn there. Was farming the vendor bot yesterday. 
---
Alright.
---
Little on the greedy side in my opinion
---
Added, I‚Äôll bring a buddy 
---
I think there is enough grinding in the game with atoms. I don't like pay to use content which is what it would end up being. They would either buy them to use the bot or use up their free atoms the buy more when skins come out.
---
or i mean the last save from your 'previous' gaming session..it just happened to me the other day
---
No content was supposed to come today as per the roadmap. Today's update was a hotfix for a survival mode bug.
---
Lying Lowe quest starts next week, along with the Legendary Vendor.
---
I thought the same and was getting ready to sell with the player vendors. Oh well guess I'll farm for a week.
---
NO, it's not dumb at all.
---
It's literally free. It's not money. It's a digital representation of pretend items that will one day vanish from existence entirely. Worthless, in fact. A waste of time and money... in ten years when you look back. 
---
You will get more than enough pretend currency by completing other challenges, just like low levels can complete the "level three times while... " easily, while high levels can't. 
---
The game has to have balance for veterans, new players, low level and high level alike. The fact that YOU think you need to have 100% in everything is a YOU issue. YOU aren't the entire consumer base.
---
Ok
---
For lead just get excavator PA and go to "Lucky hole mine" and mine lead, you can get 1000+ lead in less than 5minutes.  
---
Steel is plentiful but there's no a dedicated mine that you can get a lot as far as i know.  
---
The only problem is acid, go get an acid node xD
---
:)
---
Look up the info on the T-51b Nuka Cola Power Armor paint.  It is part of that series of unlocks and locations.
---
Yea I just learned about the witch and trick or treater yesterday 
---
is there patch notes?
---
Heh. "unstable emotion controlled brat" You're offended that I replied to you and disagreed with  your stance on a build style. I'm offended by griefers actively trying to make the game less fun for other players. But I use profanity when I express my opinions, so I'm a horrible fucking person. 
---
You'd go out of your way to destroy my base in game, and I'm the one with issues. Cute. 
---
Reminds me of the encounter with the canadian holdouts in fallout tactics
---
I had one but it makes the gun crazy long and doesnt work very well. Bought the mod from a vender for 47 caps.
---
I‚Äôve lucked out once and had both spawn together after weeks of hopping it
---
No, doesn't not look like there are any patch notes.
---
Oh, Bethesda should fix that haha
---
Head to Pylon V-13 in¬†Cranberry Bog¬†and look for a wooden stump slightly Northwest of the Pylon. There will be a note on it and a duffle bag nearby with the toolbox key inside.
---
Nuka cola quest.
---
Good one!
---
Pretty sure they said recently that they're fixing these and making them more scaling and useful
---
&lt;Saving perk points for a specific card you unlock at a later level&gt;
---
I'm still scratching my head at why the player is not able to do this unlike in Fo4. 
---
&lt;Swapping an older perk card out for a newer one instead of having to unlock them via random after skill cap&gt;
---
Just... why? Bethesda would of kept heads from rolling if they just stuck with what worked
---
Loading in has definitely been slower since the fasnacht event, so I'm really glad it looks like they've improved loading and likely stability in this most recent hotfix
---
Mate, fusion cores are not something to just throw about. The survival mechanics in Adventure Mode are already taxing as is, on early to mid game players. Nevermind someone with automatics.
---
If you want such detailed energy micromanagement mechanics, I can recommend games like Surviving Mars.
---
thanks
---
I have been requesting this for a while, especially the really tall junk walls like you see at Quincy in Fallout 4.  There was even a Creation Club pack that added them with more customization too, like barbed wire if you wanted.
---
It would be great to secure my CAMP from outside threats because walls work.
---
yeah, but  those don't really scream "brotherhood of steel"
---
I'd be all over sandbags in my camp. I was glad we got the metal military barricades by default (waited ages to get those in FO4) and the smaller concrete barriers are a really cool addition. Sandbags would round it all out fairly well. After that all we'd need is the big military walls the Brotherhood used all over the place (plus the thinner metal barriers that snap on to those) and we'd be set.
---
I'll stay on 'this is my interpretation'. I have the same understanding but I thought you had more info I could have missed 
---
I play ark survival sometimes, the crafting system there is great. You can choose between crafting 1 of something, crafting 5, or crafting the maximum that your mats allow 
---
i'm on board for more everything. Everything available to be built in Fallout 4 should be available in 76. That stuff should be, at the very least, a baseline upon which more stuff is added.
---
And if I‚Äôm not mistaken the key unlocks a toolbox in a doghouse across the street from the Overseers childhood home. Then go to the Nuka Cola Factory in the testing booth and unlock the locker to get the TNT Dome 7 key
---
Careful, YongYea will make a 30 minute long video on why that's pay to win
---
I mean, I'm american, maybe your state's standards just suck more than mine did or maybe I paid attention more.
---
TASTE LIKE FROG LOOK LIKE PEOPLE 
---
Someone mentioned it can spawn around Lady Jane's Soft Serve too.
---
I am on ps4, and I've had this camp for... maybe a week? Total, it took me about 4 hours to build. About 2-3 hours of figuring out how to build this and adjusting where I wanted the whole building to be relative to where the bar starts out, building up 2 rooms in the back that are a crafting area (right of the bar) and brewing area (left of the bar), then moving the foundations over a little after discovering some foundations were clipping into the ground, and then around an hour of decorating. I've been in this one spot at Whitesprings for a few weeks now though. I've changed the build a few times already.This is my 3rd version.
---
Cool, thanks for the reply. I hadn‚Äôt moved the camp for a couple of months so wasn‚Äôt sure. 
---
I like the addiction idea. Junkies weapons need to be better than they are
---
Damn it‚Äôs full
---
Absolutely 
---
thx
---
Could be wrong, but roadmap says Legendary vendorn is May 23. Maybe mixing it up with player vending which is next week alongside Lying Lowe?
---
I don't think it chargers the meter from what I can tell at least.
---
I grew up in Florida we have terrible school system base entirely on passing standardized testing instead of teaching.
---
The game has to make money. I don't mind it happening on cosmetic camp items at all.
---
The lights are perfect. If I try to use I have trouble find a spot to place them where it adds something to the build. They look great above a bar.
---
Yeah - that was annoying. Don't need a moonshine still there.
---
Sounds like you're just salty you can't have all the cosmetics.
---
Have you tried either shelling out dollars for the cosmetics you want or getting over it? I don't know why you think you are entitled to every single cosmetic item when there are already enough free atoms to purchase a few pieces a month that you really want. 
---
I'm glad they are clearing out the atomic shop. If you haven't purchased those items yet, you likely aren't going to in the future, so they are clearing them out to make way for new cosmetics. 
---
I would 1000% see a system more like fallout 4 and be done with it
---
I did not know that. Thank you for pointing that out :)
---
I have them and in my opinion they aren‚Äôt really worth it, just the same rusty background with a repainted garage door, nothing too mind-blowing. Would‚Äôve been better if they had toggles on it for Barn, Shack, Wood and Metal but it‚Äôs just Shack like the other garage door :| I guess if you really like red rocket it would be worth it to pick up if you‚Äôre trying to make a pit-stop camp, so hopefully someday they do add back the limited items for awhile, like a once more type deal. Who knows, I‚Äôve also missed out on some cool things because of life.
---
If this is wrong I don't want to be right. 
---
I'm trying to play as a pistol main but it annoys me that we don't have many actual pistols (not revolvers) or auto pistols, I really wanted to use the 10mm smg because I thought it was an auto pistol but nope, can't even use the default stock and call it a pistol.
---
Money bruh money
---
Anybody else swap cards like Class Freak out for Woodchuck and forget to switch them back?
---
I wouldn't go for ressources. Getting only 20 steel or so looks stupid to me. I would rather explore the wasteland and pick up everything what you need. Lead and steel is both whats getting used most of the time for ammo but just marking the items and take everything sounds better to me. You can farm xp and get other useful stuff like screws and glue for crafting stuff (unlocking the mods).   
---
Probably also claiming a workshop nearby is probably also a good idea. Also what not to forget is to sell junk. I had over 1k of cloth in my inventory and thats just taking space. I mean with caps you can buy the stuff you need, when you don't find any recepies that you really want.   
---
Yup, it is a fairly well known spot now. That first month though everyone thought I was nuts making a camp up there. Also right by some coal deposits and another place for a lead camp. As well as lots of other salvagable stuff. Now im lucky to find a server where someone is not there.
---
Do you have the chameleon mutation?
---
Nobody thinks they're entitled to anything, did you even read the post? 
---
I dont like the insult bot it keeps hunting me down 
---
Good thing your opinion doesn‚Äôt matter
---
This is kind of an advanced suggestion. 
---
I think the perk system is fun and very good as is, with just a couple slight updates needed for usability in its original design concept. I have included these in my official Inside the Vault feedback response.
---
1- Card upgrading should be changed to not require leveling 1 card and combining two 1s up the desired level. The design ideal of this is reducing bloat /time to use in the interface.
---
* Upgrading should award the level 2, so that you never own duplicate level 1s.
---
* For example, lets say at level 3 (the first level up after leaving the vault with my first card at level 2) I want the 2nd level of action boy. I choose action boy 2, and now I own level 1 and level 2, after only two picks during level up.
---
* The way it works now is that I would have to pick action boy at level 3 and level, then I own a level 1 and a level 2 of the card.
---
2- Storing any card we don't have a use for. Just like storing camp components, so we can enter the stored tab and recall but otherwise we are not dealing with scrolling through it
---
* In the above example. I then store level 1and just use level 2, because I don't want to use a lower level on this card, but later in a higher level build I might opt to bring it back
---
3- Streamlining, although a bit more abstract in concept, is needed to make the cards feel more usable. There are too many cards or ranks for some of the skills that are perk cards
---
*  All the skills that can be boosted by perk cards would be more usable by being streamlined to a standard 3 level picks, similar to lockpick and hack in the current system
---
* The system has unfinished feeling which is to do with how many separate perk cards go toward one combat skill / craft / tech type. 
---
* one example would be the demolition expert, players were unhappy at 5 ranks into the card seeing it reduced. I had 4 ranks in to the card but planned the build around 4 ranks at 80% and it is now worth 50%
---
* &amp;#x200B;
---
* A good model in my opinion is how lockpick and hack have 1 level across the 3 ranks, Basic, Expert, and Master
---
* All the other cards which span between several (for example Int energy weapon related cards) or have 3 ranks in some cases and 5 ranks in other cases should be streamlined so that choosing basic, expert, and master solve the same end result. 
---
4- *BONUS - Legendary perks that are actually bobble/magazine based ------ Legendary perks is the working name I have for if bobbles and mags could be equipped in a tab of the perk UI and have cooldowns, so players could called on their legendary moves for the big enemies / crisis moments on cooldown.*
---
* players in general do not like Eating bobble and mags.
---
* An alternative be perk card like equivalents and a separate tab behind special points to allocate which bobble or mags are equipped for use.
---
* This extra wish list item also requires another item in my feedback letter - real action bar and UI customization so that players can easily map their chosen Legendary skills (

Without sounding like an asshole....that explains everything.
---
Lmao
---
I agree, you dont need everything.
---
Donald?  lol I joke
---
Sever stability has been crap since the pvp update.  I get frame drops worse then beta. I assume alot of people are playing and it's just hard on the servers.
---
I know it doesn't do much, I just like having a camp around a resource because I think it's cool :)
---
No, and I have a bunch of armour on besides
---
Other weapons have the same option to stack sneak attacks, head shots, and critical hits. So I don't see how that effects pistols differently other than the fact that pistols use less AP per shot. Rifles have a lower fire rate, but do more damage per shot for more AP, so it seems like an even trade. Maybe not perfectly even in the current state of PvP, but PvP was not the main focus of my suggestion.
---
What pistols do not have is a decent perk like the one I suggested to gain AA without having to have it come from a prefix or 10mm mod. The stagger was added since other similar weapon perks also get that as a bonus.
---
What I'm seeing from you is that the auto 10mm and pipe pistols are fine if min-maxed properly, and I agree that's great. But what is wrong with bringing other pistols and builds up to par?
---
With the way perks are programmed that was the easiest way to level lock the higher lockpicking and hacking skills. 
---
In case you haven't noticed, the stringed lights are attached to conduits, which are a lifesaver as you can't attach anything to the underside of walls. Conduits give you a bit more leeway as to where you can put your lights as you can put them pretty much anywhere.
---
Not an asshole comment at all I moved 3k miles away for a reason.
---
OP wants cosmetics to be eventually given away for free instead of removed from the shop. He feels he should be entitled to cosmetics even if he does not want to pay for them.
---
Do you use the escape artist perk? 
---
u/quitjoshin

So you literally did what I said lol. You saw two words and made your own assumptions. No wonder you look like an ass 
---
Better prices matter

---
If you agree that you don't need everything, then why are you complaining that items are disappearing from the shop?
---
Isn‚Äôt it kind of presumptuous and patronizing to say randoms are too stupid to cooperate? I haven‚Äôt ever seemed to have a problem helping others out.
---
It's been awhile but I ran mama dolces forever while I was farming power armor early on. the northernmost ski resort I hit a lot as well. Do events, but unless u are in need of a better weapon or armor don't do the side quests too early the rewards are lvl based. For example I held off doing the Watoga mayor quests till lvl 50 so All Rise would be max lvl
---
I like the idea of gaining some of the perk increases based on the "Grind" of using that capability. There is an argument between those who want to gain skills that way and those who believe it has to do with your Role Play decision making. Would I like not being able to get level 3 locks open till I've done 760 locks at level 1 and 2? I don't know. It doesn't feel like I would like it. Maybe they could come up with a balance that doesn't annoy people who don't prefer grinding.
---
I'm not the OP lol

---
This post has a map with a bunch of the encounter locations marked.
---
Its definitely not an isolated incident. I‚Äôve seen people say the same thing you just explained happened to them. 
---
Also, I‚Äôve contacted Bethesda for non related reasons and there‚Äôs actually a disclaimer in their ticket process that states that they are unable to give you items back. 
---
I totally agree.  I cannot even do them because I do not even have recipes.  I am stuck on the Tick Blood Tequila repeatable quest because I cannot get Crimson Flux.  What a stupid ingredient for a drink.
---
Pharma Farma  on XBOX makes an audible ding when something extra appears, sometimes up to 5 seconds or so after searching. I thought it was glitched too when I first started using the search perks until I noticed the search option on the menu.  Doh! 
---
lol, right, so you didn't read it. Thanks for confirming that.
---
Put on your excavator armor and run through Lucky hole mine.  You will have more lead than you'll know what to do with.  As long as you have enough acid to refine the ore.
---
GT: TheGr8Nekodamus. I‚Äôll be on, we can go quest and whatnot 
---
Player vending, not legendary vendor.
---
He is mixing it up.
---
I like keeping power armor as a requirement for to get most out of heavy guns. I don't want  every damn weapon build in the game to be running around in assassins sentinel armor. 
---
Your first suggestion is to make cosmetics into plans to be obtained in the game world. That is giving away free cosmetics. 
---
I can do all those for you for 1500 plus the materials. I‚Äôm at work now but could do it this evening if your interested. PSN is Josh87r 
---
Yup
---
I got that twice around Camden Park. Fast travelling didn't help. Had to server hop.

IT'S RANDOM! Legendary spawns and the loot they have is random. RANDOM.

WHAT??!! *proceeds to face desking.

Make them thunder frogs should put up a good fight 
---
Well...I enjoy stealth and sneaking around like all the time.  I pretend I‚Äôm a female Solid Snake.  This dictates how I approach anything in the game, spending time accessing a situation and picking off one enemy at a time.  I look at what‚Äôs coming up and attempt to become more prepared for it: set up mines, snipe a guard, plan my route, watch enemy patterns, look for a car to blow up if a grenade will be needed.  It‚Äôs FO76 but I‚Äôm playing it like Metal Gear Solid 3
---
Thankfully I have a chest plate that helps me stay ‚Äúhidden‚Äù for longer as I close in.  And I do have perks that give damage bonuses for sneak attacks and standard rifle damage increases.  I stay at a safe distance and snipe away for as long as possible, as I am quite sqishy.  Once things get messy, I drug myself silly (because it‚Äôs kinda funny and the buffs help a ton) and swing my Black Diamond like crazy.  
---
I spend most of my game time tho just exploring West Virginia, reliving my childhood.  I try to gather as much as possible, but my carry weight limit is only 190.  Being overweight often is a pain, but I am living with it.  I am awful at the crafting because I just don‚Äôt really understand what to do with it, and keeping my equipment working is a constant struggle 
---
You can place a monetary value on someones head, like when people are wanted. The mugger system is setting an npc to mug someone. They get their stuff back if the mugger gets caught.
---
lol. I grew up in Ohio and at least when i was in school at least they actually still taught stuff. Idk the standard now though after 2 terms of kasich and I can't imagine DeWine will improve anything.
---
Found it last week at level 185. You just need to play more! *joking*
---
Grognax and one other weapon dont repair past 100. I forget what the other one is but Bethesda has known for a few months
---
What do you mean with quickly? I'm Level 48 and i got the game about 2 months ago and under 100 hours. Killing stuff gives you XP. Just exploring without killing stuff, doesn't give you that much XP. Doing quests guides you to areas with enemys and it also gives you xp. With a Power Armor you feel much more save with higher level enemies. It starts to get interesting in the savage divide, where super mutants are more often (it feels like it). 
---
&gt;opting instead for a Wiffle Bat skin
---
This right here.  Toy boxes.  Wiffle Bats.  A nixie clock that doesn't even fucking tell time.  Mushroom cloud shaped hair.  Who the hell is in charge of the Atomic Shop and why do they hate fallout fans?
---
Scrapper perk, farm West-tek. 5-15 assault rifles worth 19 steel a pop. I can get 100-200 steel in a single 10 minute run.
---
Shielded raiders aren't that rare are they? Picked one up after some event the other night
---
Just the range though.  Nice, but not what is want to see.
---
No problem. Glad to check one item off your list. :D
---
Think there is more than 3? One at each entrance, one deep in the mineshaft and one up by the trains
---
&gt; Here's what I propose: Items that aren't selling well? Make them into plans that can be found/bought and traded in game. Let's the whales spend money, and let's the rest of us have access to stuff while Bethesda keeps the profit they need. 
---
This literally means that people can buy atom shop stuff and sell/trade it to other players, again how is that free? And if it can be rarely found, how is that different from atoms from challenges?
---
You are literally trying to push your idea that I want things for free when I'm not saying that at all.
---
I dont remember if radtoad leg and frog leg are same, but you can make 20 carry weight food from them
---
Bloodied only means the lower your Health is the more damage you do. It has nothing to do with healing at all. 
---
You can have level 200+ players that can only contribute a bit to the event though - if they haven't built for Scorched Earth, then they can deal with the adds but still not do enough damage to the queen herself.  And then you get those bloodied guys with god roll legendaries fully decked out for damage, and the event is over in a blink (well not so quick these days but a few quick minutes, under 5).
---
Yeap lost a mutation due to this but lucky it wasn't something important.
---
It might just be a flat 5 each time? I'm not sure but it seems to go by 5 or 10 each crit, no matter what I hit with it.
---
Shielded raider underarmor plans are very rare.  
---
Are you shitting me? I've had it for the longest time and did not know this
---
Oh good, so I got lucky?
---
Ok cool 
---
A lot of pages on that wiki are pretty barebones as if they're just made from a template and haven't properly been filled out yet, which - to me - implies they were made before there was substantial information about Fallout 76 and they were just made in preparation of the game's full release. There's some inaccurate info too. For instance, a lot of the power armor mods' pages say "Special Perks like Armorer¬†are required to improve these Power Armor." Yet none of the power armor mods in Fallout 76 actually require Armorer, as they now use Power Smith. That tells me there may have been some speculation going into these pages based on how things worked in Fallout 4, not necessarily solid info on 76 itself. All in all, it would be a good idea to seek additional sources to verify that Scorchbeasts truly are affected by "Hunter's" legendary items.

Enclave bunker science vendor 
---
Head to VTU and look for party posters to start the Nukashine quest.  The Fasnacht parade was them testing how well people would respond to seasonal events, and it's now gone, presumably until next year.  Survival mode was the only other big thing added that I can think of right now, but player vending should be live in two weeks I think?
---
Enclave bunker or the scorchbeast queen
---
Don‚Äôt think quad exists either :( I‚Äôve scoured the market for good railways for months and have noticed a handful of effects never show up. Another is +10% damage while aiming, oddly enough. 
---
I kind of regret not putting prime on my instigating since it‚Äôd give it just a bit more oomf. You‚Äôve probably got the right idea to do that.
---
I found a mutants one that I put the auto piston on with a recoil comp stock. Still pretty much need to use VATS for accuracy but it‚Äôs hilarious for just messing around.
---
Plus the +10% damage from mutants brings the damage to 109, which is the same as a normal semi auto one. So that‚Äôs neat
---
Well, you missed the fasnacht event but I have spare masks and plans I can sell you. Survival mode was last week. Next week is a new cryptid questline and player vending...
---
Honestly, just read the [roadmap](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019)
---
Thanks for the tag :)
---
Who do you see as factions?
---
Free states
---
Raiders (All 5 flavors)
---
Responders
---
BoS
---
Enclave
---
Vault Tec
---
Order of Mysteries?
---
Firebreathers?
---
That‚Äôs 12 and I bet people could come up with more.  Don‚Äôt tempt Bethesda too much, my wallet can‚Äôt take it!
---
When I was thinking the 25% I was using revolvers as my baseline for guessing the %. Basically 1.5 staggers per reload with a strong chance of 1st shot stagger.
---
I realized the 10mm could be OP which was why I added in the bit about an internal cooldown to the proc to prevent stagger locking. That's a good point about auto pistols getting so many hits in during the early stagger though, it would be nice to have separate perks with adjusted %'s for auto and single shot.
---
Or just give pistols the same perk as rifles with 9% stagger and 36% AA. The higher AA was because revolvers do not get AA mods, but honestly I'd be happy even with just that. 
---
Thxman
---
True that. I totally forgot about lock and load. That would great.
---
Plans aren't rare now you can just buy all of them from vendors. Check watoga shopping plaza he has all plans for t51 t60 and I think t45
---
What you dont like spamming A for three minutes and then accidentally going too many times and making other random stuff too? And then walking around listening to the Super Duper sound over and over?
---
Yeah I know, I was debunking those "you get banned if you pick up 100k ammo" threads before. It's good to get the right information out there but for now this is all there is
---
Confirmed its 5 crits when using a charging shot gun telsa gun. now to see if it stacks
---
Yeah there‚Äôs a combination with chameleon armor (or the chameleon mutation) and escape artist that will keep you invisible through walking, fast traveling, server hopping, etc. There are numerous ways to activate it and it hasn‚Äôt been addressed by Bethesda at all as far as I know (I‚Äôve made posts about it months ago). The effect is only on your end, to other players you won‚Äôt appear invisible. To undo the effect, try unequipping escape artist or all of your chameleon armor.
---
Yeah, why the hell would a moonshiners shack have a still anyway...
---
Because you are using plastic. Hold ten items and the compare the bulked items weight. It's the same
---
Im offended by you? Please. Dont think so highley of yourself that you can even be offensive to anyone. As I said before, im obliging to your argument. In other words, Im humoring you.
---
I also previously said that I dont mind foundation builds. I just oppose that people use it. The reason is because foundations are indestructible.  However what one person does in their camp doesnt matter to me. Build a giant metal dick with lights, i dont care. (Note: Must draw plans for giant dick shaped camp). I know all my camps looks so awesome that people dont attack. Yes one time i was wanted, sat in my camp. Someone came to claim. Then they said "I was gonna kill you but your camp is so nice bro. I gotta give you props." We then teamed up and I hid, and he killed anyone who came to claim my bounty. We made a lot of caps. Fun times.
---
Also coming from someone who likes to troll now and again, expressing your hate for griefers is an invite for griefers to come grief you. Also doing anything in the game isnt out of my way. Im already playing fallout 76. Destroying someone's camp is apart of the game.
---
I played a chef sporting a full chef outfit, a handlebar moustache and a rolling pin and set up my camp right by the overseers camp. Built up a little diner area, unlocked water purifiers and crops and a house full of workbenches,. When a noob came by I cooked him cranberry pies and radstag steak and talked to him in an italian accent then sent him on his way.  
---
When I got my first power armor I became the iron chef, but I was of course still the chef so I removed my PA helmet so everyone could still see my chef hat.
---
New content and new bugs next week leading to another hotfix
---
try slocum joe's or the junkyard
---
Enclave Bunker... but that is a definite waste of caps.
---
SBQ drops them occasionally.  And you can find players who will trade them for much less than the Enclave price tag.  Usually see 2-4k price tags on trading posts.
---
Just out of the blue, why did Nuka Girl costume was removed? My fiance was hyped to play and get it once she'll get new PC, and when finally got it... there's no Nuka Girl in Atom Shop :(. 
---
There is no logical reason to remove antyhing from the shop, it doesn't take any space. Stop forcing people to buy something because it will be removed, just lower the prices and you'll see that people actually wants to buy something, but current prices are ridiculous.
---
I put it up lower someone offered 7k so if someone wants to pay more to outbid someone else... that‚Äôs on them. Heck I wanted an armor piece (leg) so bad I paid 12.5k because I chose to.
---
Are you clicking his link or the one the bot broke the formatting of up top?
---
Ok thx for the info 
---
Dragon uses the same bayonet mod. So if you find a black powder rifle bayonet mod in the wild, you can slap it on the dragon too. Game doesn‚Äôt tell you this but it works.
---
Not sure if you need to scrap each gun type to learn the plan though
---
Give Insult Bot a couple of level 50 assaultron guards that roll around in stealth with him and if attacked kill you. Put the Assaultron names as "Injury", so they can add insult to injury lmao.
---
- Fast travel to Treetops in The Mire.
---
- Follow the dual lane road north, towards the river.
---
- Once across the river, keep the river to your left and head west. Look for a metal shack (unmarked). There should be a chain-link fence surrounding it and a bombed out semi-truck beside it.
---
- Make sure you have a maxed out Butcher's Bounty perk card equipped. 
---
If you server hop, you'll find 6 - 8 ticks every time. When you join a new server, it'll place you near Treetops and it's only a few seconds to walk over there. Be careful though, there are two random spawn points on the road, very near each other.
---
How are your perks set up?  I've recently switched from being heavy on QoL perks to more combat-centric ones and am still finessing my build, but I can drop most Scorched with a single headshot, two at the most.  I used a level 50 .50 cal sniper rifle with hardened receiver for extra damage and perforating magazine for increased armor penetration.  The three rifleman perks give around 60% additional damage and Bloody Mess gives an additional 10% damage across the board. I've heard some people say they equip Tank Killer as well for additional armor penetration, but haven't tried that in my build yet.
---
I love wandering the wasteland in my duster.
---
Gimme that white cross on a white background for all my pvp camp needs.
---
In the early game I was literally throwing away fusion cores because you couldn't sell them plus stash limits.
---
I get it though, any suggestion that adds challenge gets voted down, anything that makes it easier gets voted up.
---
I think if it came with a set number of insults (or replies) it could be handled really easily (or something like Dark Souls messages)
---
Their is a perk called friendly fire..while equipped flame damage heals your friends i.e flame thrower used on your squad mate would cause healing..since the shishkabob is also part flame damage it should heal squad mates
---
It doesn't matter what they do to it, I'm never going to find one. All I ever get is cheesy armor pieces. 
---
I know this, it's the only information given thus far. This is my interpretation. 
---
u/valseek
---
I can definitely help you out with that but I won't be home from work until later tonight (approx four hours from now).  I sell serums for 200 caps each, PSN is Todd\_Coward, hit me up if someone else isn't able to help you out sooner!
---
No doubt it is viable via perks but I don't use pipe weapons. :)
---
When you put it like that. Maybe you do have another card or something canceling it out. Excuse my confusion
---
Maybe try server go someone might of already killed it
---
Well he can smell fear and insecurities so that might explain why.
---
I like hitting it like that
---
I just hit moonshiners Shack and the lumber yard. It's four at the shack and like 3-5 at the lumber yard. Cheaper to because the ft cost is one cap. I'm currently trying to make 2500k stimpacks.
---
I‚Äôm not arguing the point you can‚Äôt get 7k for it, but at the moment prices are much lower on average, and I‚Äôm a cheap fuck, I did pay 1000 for 7 words
---
I paid 33k for a set of armour 
---
Yeah with the perk..it use to work with shishkabob according to older threads
---
You don't need to camp on metal material sites. Just got the Hornwright Executive Key and do the Breach and Clear events. You'll have more mats than you know what to fucking do with. ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I'm assuming it is optional. Similar to the prestige system implemented in the previous COD series.
---
There's a magazine that decreases camp move cost by 80%
---
Uh, they have been doing better. Compare initial pricing to recently, prices have really been lowered. Compare the  Power Armor Statue to the Deathclaw one. 400 to 200. They didn't even originally have sales, people just aren't noting the difference
---
Well... as soon as I see or hear him now, he gets a TSE to the face... waste of a random spawn. :P
---
Does the frog remind anyone else about queen gohma from Loz: Ocarina of time
---
Paying caps is better but great idea nonetheless
---
That's why I was wondering if certin legendary effects knock it out or there's been an update that changes it
---
Yeah I think I've changed my mind üòÇ I'm gonna look for a good junk or acid location 
---
I‚Äôm not arguing that either,  just saying it‚Äôs not a matter of greed to know what something‚Äôs worth and sell accordingly.
---
I currently have all 3 rifleman perks maxed out. 1 point in tank killer, but I gave bloody mess up for starched genes and class freak. Although I can alternate between starched genes and bloody mess since I have the sun kissed perk equipped too, which heals radiation in sunlight ü§î
---
I personally carry a scoped hunting rifle for long range and a handmade with a reflex sight for interiors and crowds. Sticking with one weapon type really pays off in the long run. I one shot a lvl 91 deathclaw yesterday with a vats crit on the hunting rifle. I actually laughed. Then I had all I could handle a minute later with a mob of crickets while using an anti armor/explosive handmade. Go figure. Deathclaw easy, crickets hard AF.
---
You‚Äôll just have to get to the bottom of it by trial and error. But hope all goes well fellow dweller
---
I sell things based on how much room for caps and storage space I have
---
Oh, right.  That's true.
---
I think the functionality for this is built-in and just disabled.  I have seen a slider bar pop up momentarily when crafting an item but it disappeared immediately and I have not been able to reproduce it to screenshot it.
---
Passive non-combat cards are my top priority for the game. I've been saying it for a lot of times now. I can't believe the devs don't get mad at this when they play
---
I‚Äôm inclined to think that the new mode coming out in the summer is likely what you‚Äôre looking for.
---
That would be radtoad legs. 10 carry weight for grilled, 20 for fried.
---
Absolutely. Acid is the key to good mineral refinement!
---
My only concern with separating them completely is eventually everyone has all those perks effectively on all the time, whereas the intent of the design seems to be encouraging players to specialize and group up (and I like the idea that crafting has diversity, especially with some of the planned updates coming).  This also negates any real purpose for high intelligence builds (granted they aren't great for survival anyway, but currently they are useful if you team up often).  Making easily swapped load outs/decks would make things more manageable without negating the original intent.  I also feel that the lock pick and hacker cards should consolidate to a stack in the menu (as I suspect they didn't tier them to make it easier to add and drop the needed rank) so they aren't as annoying to find, nor should you be able to gain duplicates of them (or any other single tiered card).  If we were given at least 3 decks, I feel it would make things substantially better (one combat, one exploration, one crafting).  As it would be far less worrisome if you just had the certainty of grabbing your combat build when you are done crafting.
---
I‚Äôm hopin we get them all! I‚Äôd love to see camps for all the different factions and their sub factions that‚Äôd be rad.
---
I'm SerenityHeroes if You wanna add me. Im level 22, but I'm not on a lot considering I work all the time. Yay for adulting!
---
I just tested this on xbox and hit 25,000 and then got the Max message like normal. It didn't let me go over.
---
&gt; I'm currently trying to make 2500k stimpacks.
---
2500?  Or 2500000 (2500k)?
---
Also... Why?  I have 300 on me right now just from scavenging normally and it seems like more than I would ever need.
---
Wait, seriously? I never knew this. 
---
Lol! I love it
---
I believe they're sometimes in queen drops, but i'm not positive. 
---
Weird. Every time someone posts this suggestion it gets tons of upvotes. It's almost like people really want it to happen. Huh.
---
I‚Äôve been in 6 over the last week. Radstorms are annoying and boring. 
---
Really would like to see something interesting done with them. They should create nuked flora, spawn a horde of glowing ones or introduce a new cryptid, something based off the Thunderbird, that travels only in the Radstorms. 
---
...Rounding that build off would be problematic.  You could have a three wide base and a 4 tall tower (I think 4 floors is the current max, it's been a  minute since I've tried for taller). but it'ed be blocky as fuck. 
---
I've got a legendary Dragon as well, Zealot. So how do you two shot a Scorch?
---
Yea same here I work all the time 
---
...If you call a "twenty minute long video" "two words" then...sure? 
---
My character has CHR at 4 so each time I do a vendor run I do the same thing:  Get in my Excavator suit, grab what I'm selling from my stash, fast travel to Flatwoods, get right in front of that vendor, swap in my Hard Bargain card, pop some grape mentats, and drink a beer.  That gives me +6 CHR plus the bonus from hard bargain and adds a decent amount.  Then I fast travel to Sutton station, Whitesprings station, Watoga station, hit up Phoenix, and if I get really lucky I can just make it to Harpers Ferry before the mentats runs out.
---
u/ATottieScone posted a good link that shows how this can help.  It also would help your purchasing so instead of that Letters and Numbers plan costing 12,000 caps it could be down to 9,000 or something like that.
---
I enjoy exploring quite a bit, but I dislike how in most areas, there just won‚Äôt be any reward outside junk, which you can farm anywhere. I feel like better scaling for higher level players would encourage going to those far flung corners.
---
Wow!
---
When we're talking archetypes:  
---
The Raider "Bro": The guy who kills you at a workshop, takes your bag, invites you to team and goes "haha i was just joking around bro you know, it's just for fun you know" and you're like "haha yea no worries it was a workshop" and then he's like "hehe ye", then he warps across the map and gets a 300 cap bounty wrecking peoples camps and you leave the team.  
---
The true beginner: Plays adventure mode, immediately sprints in the other direction when he sees another player. When cornered, he will beat you with a melee weapon for 5 minutes not understanding how pvp works. When you drop a bag he's already on the horizon.  
---
The careful beginner: Sneaks wherever he goes, even inside your camp. Runs away at the first sound of gunshots. You find him on the road fighting 5 molerats with a machete and missing every swing. When you drop a bag and gesture him to come he will walk back and forth and look eveyrwhere but down a few times, then he finds the bag and starts jumping up and down as a thank you because he doesn't know how to emote.  
---
The no-lifer: Lvl 283, flies into your camp with a jetpack and quantum armor and uses your workbenches, drops a bunch of 2-star legendaries and handcrafted lvl 50 weapons and ammo, turns on his mic and in some broken eastern european accent says "Chello frend".  
---
The "new to gaming" girlfriend: lvl 6, following her lvl 8 boyfriend around about two steps behind, sports a pipe pistol and a dress. At the first sight of danger her boyfriend will run in with melee and she will shoot from afar. If you drop a bag, the boyfriend will wander off not interested but the girlfriend will stop and taker the bag and give a heart emote and then wave when you leave.  
---
must have seen these specific 4 combos at least several times each.
---
Sounds good man I will add u 
---
I wouldn't be against a sleeker spider, like the Black Widow that is native to WV.
---
Actually, it works sometimes with other players. 
---
You only need to fast travel the one time and, if you set your camp nearby, it'll be cheaper still. I've been doing it  for about a month and have made enough stimpacks that my antibiotic production is through the roof.
---
These daily challenges really are getting out of hand. 
---
Pre patch I've crashed 3 times using psycho not tried since

Bethesda stop making brewing challenges

Bethesda stop making Group challenges

Bethesda stop making killing challenges
---
Bethesda stop making photo challenges
---
Bethesda just give us 60 atoms a day and 100 additional a week. Also get rid of the survival challenge, it's not fair to those of us not playing survival.
---
I personally have only ever received _one_ BOS mod plan since the Vendor update months ago.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b7tqcs/for_the_first_time_since_the_vendor_plan_update_i/
---
So far I've seen confirmed spawns in random Mod Plan locations and containers.  Meaning it's very rare.  I've heard events and treasure map rewards in and around the bog but have not confirmed it myself.
---
You won't get them from scrapping, and none of the vendors stock them anymore.
---
Either you spend months farming locations yourself and pray to RNG, or spend weeks offering caps on the market to other players and hope one appears willing to sell and you catch them before they sell to someone else.
---
So far no response from Bethesda beyond a "will look into it" about missing plans and such.  They really need to make these things more available in certain appropriately themed areas.
---
Or chess, since we already have a chessboard and pieces in the game
---
I believe Treasure maps in the bog and the savage divide,  along with BoS events in the bog.
---
The enemies do scale to you, but some areas are more popular than others and it‚Äôs likely that a lvl 100+ player spawned the mob. Sometimes I go around white springs and all the ghouls are lvl 9 and 15, even though I‚Äôm lvl 170ish. Someone else spawned the mobs.
---
Maybe just a lucky glitch then. I‚Äôll test when I get home üëçüèº
---
No, BOS mods cannot be learned thru scrapping.  Only the BOS Helmet Paint job (which appears as a BOS pop up).  But is not the same thing.
---
You cannot learn them from scrapping
---
Skyrim VR special edition... VR in VR.
---
You VR a person playing on a computer playing a VR port of skyrim.
---
Hey, that‚Äôs actually really good
---
#SNAPPABLE! MAKE THEM SNAPPABLE!
---
Alternatively, it can be activated by spamming the crouch button a few times and ending the spam with your character standing. This visually glitches you on your end, and it can be stopped by simply crouching and letting the chameleon effect turn itself on.
---
I pulled an April Fools on my friend. Told him it made him invisible to everyone. Then I watched as he walked into the Survival meat-grinder. Poor lad.
---
You don't get a bounty for attacking camps, the only bounties you can get in survival I think are from people putting them on you when you kill them. So yes they can attack with impunity (FYI "attach" as you wrote means something else). But yes you can still see any wanted player in survival regardless of their place on the leaderboards.
---
rule #1 - NEVER swap out starched genes lol

It's interesting to me for sure that there are specific zones that are just much much more likely to spawn legendary enemies. It's a rare day that I don't get one legendary in a loop in watoga. (used to be more than that, I think it got nerfed). There are other areas in the map, like a disposal sight, that I've never seen a legendary in, even though it's got roughly the same population. 
---
haha lmao, so many things going trough my head now. genius idea
---
I love it! That actually made me laugh.
---
2 Assualtron Dominator bots, even better(or worse)!
---
2. Something's wrong with me.
---
Got the arm plans from a savage divide map
---
It would be really neat to have that full chess set from the Frat House with robot versions of all the pieces.
---
And the checkers using the caps as pieces too.
---
Talking about possible problems before said problems occur is genrally considered a good practice actually.
---
Oddly, I don‚Äôt have any chameleon. Only that one that activates when you are hit. I‚Äôve tried taking everything off, including escape artist, and quitting out of the game. When I joined back in it was still happening 
---
Alright there you special little snowflake, what else would you like bethesda to cater specifically to you.
---
It's not fucking rocket science to make a reddit post saying "Would anyone like to group up for X challenge" and I guarantee you'll get a response.
---
Get over yourself.
---
The walls from that Creation Club thing we‚Äôre actually amazing. I removed the junk fence I had around Sanctuary to build those. Side story: I was almost out of workshop space (the size limit was almost full) so I took advantage of he glitch where you drop weapons from your inventory and scrap them. It was a mistake that now prevents me from staying in Sanctuary for 5 minutes without the game crashing. 
---
But I don‚Äôt have any chameleon or the mutation 
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
u can find this plan grinding event and workshops, so prob the guy that sold this was a nice guy and didn't ask 8999k for it xd
---
Possible, but I think that's what the budget limit is more likely for. I see my servers I'm in crash here and there, but it's usually the usual suspects causing it...people still bypassing duping, and more commonly..."hey guys, let's set off 2 or 3 bikes at the same time." I've gotten used to it, so it doesn't bother me.
---
That's a whole different list than what I've been following!
---
I'm going to compile a newer one.
---
Junk electric and/or Enclave style fences (the ones from Fallout 3 that they built around the Jefferson Memorial)?
---
Post updated to link a new edit that‚Äôs kinder to the ears and more in keeping with the movie
---
if you only "pay" with atoms you earn in game, then in a roundabout way, all the items are free.
---
How long you have to "work" to get those atoms vs the value of the item to you is something only you can decide.
---
As you point out, its no different that a real store discount items to increase overall business or clear inventory.
---
Personally, its not that I dont like some of the PA paint, its that I worked hard for the atoms I have and just am not willing to spend that many atoms, free or not, on a particular item.
---
Nah, I‚Äôd say yours is better- shotgun crits will give you 8 crits (8 pellets). 
---
There‚Äôs very few circumstances outsides Whitesprings where you can get 8 mobs together to hit with a tesla rifle
---
This is fantastic, well done. One of the most unique CAMP ideas I've seen for a while.
---
Thanks you for the tips!
---
why people charge that much? i'm playing since beta and i have like 40k, doesn't matter if im 1 or 4k more rich lol 
---
It‚Äôs a bit like the filing cabinets, I don‚Äôt like that they snap together which makes the taller one stick out at the back
---
Wow Level 140 here and I have *never* seen or heard of the insult bot!
---
Why not just use a melee weapon that requires no ammo?
---
Oh man!  So awesome! I‚Äôm pacific time.  I‚Äôll check in tonight and see if you guys are still at it, but it will be about 11 ish your time.
---
Did you take the stock off of it?
---
If you remove the stock it loses the commando perks and reverts to base damage which is 34. With a stock on Commando applies and it's 55.
---
Yeah, this and several others like "kill different specific mobs" glitch out for me as well since day 1.
---
I rarely see it mentioned at all and it's annoying af. I really hope they fix it! 
---
Let us choose the insults. I would buy atoms for this. 
---
That they are legendary.

https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects
---
Upvote for the Zaxxon reference. You didn't happen to have it on the Sega Master System with the 3D glasses by chance, did you?
---
Well, we‚Äôve all gotta do our part to rebuild the wasteland. 
---
I can double check when I get on tonight. All I can say is that I scrapped a heavy combat cheat and "Learned: Brotherhood of Steel."
---
I'd still pay full price so yea
---
And the black &amp; white floors from the Whitespring.  I need my 50s diner.
---
I like it! 
---
This would be great. I have always wondered why you would build pre broken windows.
---
As soon as they released the roadmap saying we would be able to place items in our inventory in our C.A.M.P.s I made sure to scrapped all my junk except for two pool cues, a set of pool balls, a rack, a chessboard, and all the pieces from that set.  Been very careful to keep them intact.
---
I almost always accept, but you lose Lone Wanderer (a pretty good perk).  The strange in numbers produces an unusual extra jump &amp; latency on marsupial.  The rad removal perk is great to share, but randoms seem not to understand that we need to kind of remain close to each other.  When I send an invite, probably only 1 in 10 get accepted.  My friends list has moved on to other games, so it's pretty much lone wanderer for me.üòÅ
---
No. I had it on the Atari 2600. 
---
They allegedly fixed spawn camping my increasing invulnerability times, so there's only one way to find out
---
It should work cross server.  :-D
---
That's the thing, the server I was on wasn't highly populated and it was just myself and two other players fighting a queen.
---
Don't worry, he is gonna find you eventually, and he will light you up.
---
Like Deep Pocketed and Dense, it cannot be learned from scrapping.  You may know it, but not from scrapping.
---
It's the paint job for the Combat Armor Helmet.  It can be learned by scrapping any piece of combat armor.
---
No problem fellow vault dweller.  :)
---
So, French flag??
---
Congratulations, ghouls and mole rats are now the most deadly creatures in the game.
---
I still wish they would make ghouls and maybe even supermutants playable like vampires and werewolves in ESO.  Muties would be harder to implement though, since their large size is constant rather than a temporary morph like with the werewolves...
---
Only way I've gotten it to work is to spell the words out vertically instead of horizontally, then they snap perfectly but don't usually look as nice, and take up more room because the words need to be spaces far enough away to not snap to other letters horizontally again.
---
How would one join this? Is there a discord? 
---
Buy them on the secondary market.  Going rate varies based on the desperation of the buyer. I have seen as low as 3K and as high as 10K recently.  
---
there is a shortcut for friend list.its ctrl+tab but when i do it i cant see any of those invites.Im getting invites a lot but there is a bug about that social menu thanks for reply btw &lt;3

Oh ok. Thx.

Haha took me 10 minutes wandering around Watoga and I got it done
---
Alot
---
I play and own a mic :)
---
It hits you like radium
---
Lol, a literal shot of espresso made from a can of coffee :)
---
The tedious micromanagement is the deterrent used to make you prioritize, since currently you can't truly be a Jack of all trades without sacrificing other options (high intelligence would be needed to have the majority of the crafting skills active in the same way making them passive would work).  I feel that we were given the ability to change cards to both try out different things and to prevent us from being truly locked out of anything (unless we planned poorly with point allocation prior to being able to shift points around).  
---
Shielded comes from an area around Tangara Town, I think.  Either that or rare drop from Enclave events.

The mod plans are just mods.  You have to have the plans for the actual underarmor to make the item.  But I do not believe the Enclave underarmor plans exist.  You can buy the underarmor items themselves from the vendors in the Whitespring Bunker, and then you can mod them with the lining plans you learned.
---
Combine these rush sales to clear out atom stashes, with 1 day sales of actually nice items, and you've got a tried and tested exploitative cash grab mechanic from free to play games.

Some friends and I would team together and whenever we opened a safe or killed a.creature together, inevitably someone would say "I got a rock".
---
Exactly. It's like giving survival tips. To get to the base, get the Managers ID card from the desk upstairs. Then go back down stairs, head out through a hole in the wall towards the back and follow the path along the top of the pipes and boards. Look along the big pipes until you see a broken section. Go into the pipe, head left (i think) and use the ID card to access a hidden section. The door to the base is in there. I'll be interested in what you think. Let me know üòä

I've seen a couple off from the distance with discolored clouds. Also been on the outskirts of a few so I got irradiated a bit, but the sky wasn't too different.
---
I'd kind of liked to see them buffed a bit. Would love to see ghouls get a buff in rad storms.
---
I'm Pacific time. I'll probably still be on. I just EST cause it seems easier for most people

I was about to mention Conan Exile‚Äôs 1/10/all system, then remembered it‚Äôs basically ARK‚Äôs system with less dinosaurs and more blood/nudity

Totally

I dunno man. Loosing 20% damage resist is very damn noticable. No amount of DR/ER from Scaly Skin unter SiN will compensate for this. That said one can always accept, give person a couple minutes to FT and leave team. Not a hard thing to do.
---
Thata assuming its full strength. Based on the amount of ingredients, the amount of water, and the fact you can chug entire bottles id put this liquor at closer to beer strength.

No Discord(I guess we could make one?) but if you just join my world tonight and fast travel to the Overseer's Camp you'll find us!

Have a 3* bloodied Fatman but it is level 35
---
It's great but after about 40 levels I got sick of the same songs over and over so I switched to classical radio.  Now i'm even getting tired of those songs lol. Not every game can have the massive song selection of GTA or Rock Band/Guitar Hero though. Certain songs probably cost more too, I bet they shelled put the big bucks for the Beach Boys song.
---
Even if it is still working, it is no longer allowed to use these mods. It is now written in ToS that it is not allowed to use third party software that is not approved by Zenimax and these mods aren't approved so far.
---
Imagine lounging at your CAMP when a securitron rolls up and says [FortniteLord42 says ‚ÄúSuck my ass you fucking casual‚Äù] and then turns 180 degrees and rolls off into the sunset. 
---
Will do! I'd appreciate if you could send me a message (GT is Madmathieu5)  or what's your gamer tag? 
---
The robot at watoga sells bos plans sometimes 
---
I did the same thing Sunday, after nuking fissure prime, working the SBQ down to 25% health after her heal, and having the server crash. 6k .50 gone, no loot, no XP. I feel your pain!!
---
I would spawn in and my friends would already have climbed 7 flights of stairs and be looting my water purifiers while I watched them apparently running around in midair 80 feet above me.  Eventually the whole thing would render, but meanwhile I'd have time to run over to my junk extractor and empty it and then run back out before the walls appeared.
---
So it wasn't there for me, but it was there for my friends.
---
It didn't bother me at first because I figured a new server would fix it. But I'm going on multiple days that it's still doing it 
---
I‚Äôd still love to see a rare chance for ‚Äúrabid [BLANK]‚Äù that WOULD aggro and have a chance to disease.  Would keep us on our toes - this is Wild Appalachia, after all...
---
I've seen that girl a bunch and she's never been that nice to me.
---
Yes. it would be nice to be able to unrank cards. 
---
This is perfect! Thank you so much
---
No. That wouldn't be my purpose at all, because that is annoying. There is a height limit, but perhaps they could lower it to discourage that.
---
I simply want a better usable space to build. I know there are come saying that it would bog the server... I don't think it would, if you make the build area roughly the same size as the circle, and as long as you still have a reasonable budget like they do now, it should keep in line with their server limitations.
---
Also, for clarification for those asking about building upwards and all, the restrictions sugestion is more about having leeway. In FO4, you could use the foundation-less directly on the ground. Same with walls. Also, you could manipulate the stairs to not be centered on the floor, if you were not using a doorway. That's the restrictions I would like to see removed, so we have more variety to build, since we don't have as many options as we did in FO4.
---
I am one of those odd ones that loves the building aspect of it. I've rebuilt my C.A.M.P. several times, based on where in Appalachia I set it at, and I wanted something different. Having a little more leeway for the sake of aesthetics is all I'm asking for, if it's reasonable for the servers.
---
I sit on the fence here. I like the idea of having to pick which perks are the most beneficial, I forgo locking picking for more damage with a rifle. However, i also like the idea of more benefits for gaining more experience in the game.
---
Perhaps we could have passive slots that open up after level 50. For example, every 10 levels you gain access to an additional passive card slots. Players that play more and have done the hard work get more benefits (or perks).
---
NP!
---
What am I missing here?
---
Thank you for commenting but I am not interested in that type of weapon. Mainly what is listed.
---
I'm not gonna get all upset about it, but the answer has two words:  Atom Shop.
---
I'm replaying FO4 right now using a bunch of assets that modders have unlocked. It's like night and day after playing 76 for months. The amount and range of stuff is mind-blowing and I'm gonna have a hard time building in 76 again, I think. xD
---
So yes, there are a ton of assets available. But I don't expect we're going to see many (if any) added directly to the game as earnables. Keep in mind that it has already been stated by a CM that the cash shop is run by a different group. I would bet that group has final say over which cosmetics are added to the game for free, and I doubt they have any incentive to just give us a bunch of them... mainly because the more free stuff we get, the less inclined we'll be to spend. 
---
I dropped about $50 on the cash shop a month ago, so I'm all for supporting the game. But at this point-- and I think I'm being realistic, not pessimistic-- there's no reason to believe we're going to get that lovely stuff from FO4. It will probably continue to be a trickle of new offerings on the atom shop with the occasional freebie.
---
Personally, I'll continue to spend the rest of that $50 when I spot something I really want. But I'm basically waiting for FO76 to get private servers and mods before I go any further. I want to see those build budget caps lifted, the buildable zone expanded, settlers and kitties added, and all that good stuff. And most important in a way, I want to see if Bethesda actually lets modders give us asset packs for 76. I have some doubts, but then, they didn't try to stop asset mods when Creation Club came out, so who knows. xD  
---
And that's kind of the funny thing to me-- if they allow asset mods, I'm going to spend more on this game just to support the coolness. But if they disallow and force everyone to purchase the trickle of somewhat pricey things on the cash shop, I may just stick with building in FO4. 
---
\*shrugs\*  time will tell.   
---
Lol 2500 
---
None of the vendors sell BOS Mod Plans since the big Vendor change back in Patch 5(?) I think it was.
---
Not even a quantum? I didn't know about the orange ones either but I've found a ton of quantums!
---
I give it to you that's killer, wanted to do something like this for the Survival Mode. Well done!  As a fellow Raider if you're on PC I have a Two-Shot Gatling with your name on it.
---
Yes, and while we‚Äôre at it, how bout those sweet broken Automaton lanterns/braziers/decorum, too?
---
Not disputing what you're saying. It's easy to accidentally drop something without knowing it though. 
---
hmmm, tried that several times with no luck..
---
If you are need lead/steel for bullets, go neither. None of these are worthy, because mining with excavator gives you 4x on both, then you smelt with Super Duper. Just look up lead/steel deposits and neither of them is going to be sacred.
---
Craft versus modify.  You modify to upgrade an already existing garment. 
---
For sure, was just curious haha hope you get what you want! 
---
Whitesprings station, so you can kill people, would be the most efficient way.
---
I‚Äôd honestly build on lead, and collect mobs‚Äô guns so you can scrap it for steel.
---
And I‚Äôd venture to say that I bought it from another player for 1000 caps no 0‚Äôs left off they are obtainable by grinding workshop events 
---
A few Whitespring farms and you'll be swimming in more HR Fluids, Hardened Masses, and Glowing Masses, than what you know what to do with.  And they don't spoil.
---
So it really doesn't take much to build up.
---
I feel like all the other stagger perks are designed with automatics specifically in mind. Single shot stuff does not get as much out of stagger perks than automatics do.
---
Modern renegade should definitely be changed from cripple to stagger chance though. What is it? 4% cripple chance? That is garbage.
---
I cannot speak much to revolvers, but the black powder pistol has a nice bit of burst damage. I think 1800 damage was what I calculated for my BPP. That is not all that amazing in PVE, but you can imagine how good that would be in PVE if it had that double damage at full health legendary prefix. The question would be if it doubles the damage after sneak attacks and head shots or if it does it separately.
---
Pretty sure there is a roughly equal chance of getting each of the three needed components, or some ionized meat. Maybe you just had bad luck. 
---
Lol. I encountered the new to other games boyfriend/bored gamer girlfriend
---
. He is a neckbeard probably. He's fat, you know from his hard breathing on the mic. it also sounds like he has yogurt in his mouth when he talks. He only played nintendo games. He somehow got a girlfriend. She sounds cute over the mic. She's probably fat too. Maybe she's a pretty fat girl. They exist. Anyway, she is a true gamer. She is annoyed that she has to hold her cuck boyfriends hand through the game. She adds other random people to the party looking for actual players. If you join the party you hear a lo of "come pick this up. this one is better. Use this. Come here. interact with this to finish the quest."
---
Yea, poison resistance effect works. Seems like it's just a computational error, should be easy to fix, just mimic the poison effect calculation. Just need the developers to be aware of the issue.
---
So when you black out drunk and wake up at a random location, would you like the screen to stay black for the equlivant amount of time it would take to stagger there?
---
But is it actually fixed? 
---
Thanks! I can't get what I want haha
---
I built a raised foundation around my junk extractor to keep the supermutants and scorched from destroying the walls as they shot at it.  It had to be stacked on one side because it's built into a hill.  It's hardly a bunker because it has a door and a roof.
---
The first three photos here show what I'm talking about.
---
[https://imgur.com/gallery/Uwtc8T7](https://imgur.com/gallery/Uwtc8T7)
---
So don't assume stacked foundations are simply for PVP protection.
---
Awesome. This is the step I need!
---
There's a cemetary west of flatwoods where ticks spawn. I'm not positive, but I think one of the nearby farms has a chemistry station. 
---
I totally feel that haha
---
If someone is at a location I'm trying to fast travel to I sometimes accidentally send them an invite lol
---
The base idea is nice in concept. To really make it work, they would have to overhaul the entire system.
---
We've seen how some things have been handled :-)
---
It's a two shot dragon and I have adrenal reaction.
---
Still at work so I can‚Äôt test, hence the purportedly. Hopefully someone can chime in on the success or failure. 
---
If I was to buy everything I don‚Äôt have yet from the current sale it‚Äôll cost me just under $100. This sale made me realize that I‚Äôm done with this game once I hit level 100 and get my last couple achievements. There‚Äôs no point in playing a game where you‚Äôre going to permanently miss out on tons of stuff if you don‚Äôt drop unreasonable amounts of money on it.
---
And it isn‚Äôt even a free game. It just came out near the end of last year for $60 and already there‚Äôs been like 250+ dollars worth of MTX. And for that money and patience we get a ‚ÄúHave fun being ganked‚Äù mode and beer crafting.

Fuck everything about this.

As far as I know, you cannot move it.  If you do, it will blueprint into pieces and you can't place them down.
---
I would say plenty. I'm on at least once a day, have a mic. If ya ever see me I give low level people ammo and sometimes help clear areas so they can loot the corpses or I dump the lower level weapons and armor at their feet. Depends on if in doing a quest or not. 
---
Rip man, AAE RW Big Guns are nowhere to be found...
---
I play in xbox with mic.
---
Hell yeah
---
You have to purchase enclave underarmor. You can purchase plans for all levels of enclave shielding. 
---
I've been able to purchase all levels of BOS plans at watoga excepted for BOS shielded. 
---
But in Fallout, Canada was annexed.
---
Well that is the inherit male blindness gene there - the one that means we fail to find object X in the pantry, even when it is right in front of us
---
Well that first point is arguable with some context.
---
I'm OK with buying cosmetic camp stuff, too. But I'd rather they not go down the path of focusing camp updates entirely on the cash shop. That would be rather unfair IMO because as the OP pointed out, FO4 was way more generous than 76 has been, even from the start, and it doesn't really make a lot of sense when you pause to think about it. FO76 is a game built from the ground up to be persistent and something players want to play for a long time, which is great for everyone. But when it comes to building, it's kind of hard when we have such limiting budgets (understandable given server performance) and a comparatively shallow selection of decor/architectural options/textures (not so understandable when a cash shop exists). &gt;.&lt;
---
I think they should start to add FO4 assets into 76 as earnables in-game, stuff we can find as drops or buy with caps, etc., and then continue adding 76 original assets to the cash shop. I would see that as a fair and friendly compromise for both parties. :-D
---
Those freakin vultures getting them.
---
Yeah, those durn cats are always getting online and shopping at my house too.  I think its all a  diabolical conspiracy.  They are alll in it together I say!
---
I personally love spamming X for ten goddamn minutes to get enough to make corn soup.....
---
what system do you play on because i have a two shot gatling plasma
---
&gt;So it really doesn't take much to build up.
---
It doesn't take much if you are just gathering it to craft mods. Ultracite ammo is a different story, especially for a lite machine gun.

---
I kinda like the model where they put the trashed version of the camp item in the game and sell the cool reskins in the shop too, might be a better compromise
---
awesome :P I didn't even think of going to Watoga, that's brilliant when the robots keep spawning from those "dispencers". Good thinking! (Y)
---
I don't mind the reduced prices as they roll off. Definitely wasn't going to pay the original prices. 
---
I think though that anything purchased for free should be allowed to be crafted and shared with other players. 
---
Ikr
---
Nice.
---
You can make an impossible to reach platform with 2-3 high stairs, if you could disconnect stairs like that. You could also manipulate stairs such that you, and only you, could parkour up there.
---
While I certainly would love to build as I did in 4, it would make melee (and in some cases ranged) Combat impossible for the attacker.
---
I think you misunderstand, it's not a bad idea because I dont like it, it's a bad idea because a LOT of people don't like it and it effects all of them. You can easily make your suggestions better in a few steps. 
---
1st, check to make sure it'll only affect players by choice. Unless it's a massive update with many features that still keeps the game balance, people don't usually want to mess with it. 2nd, accept criticism. You may have 100s of hours on your belt, but plenty of the people criticizing you have similar, or even more. They understand and appreciate what they're playing. 3rd, make sure it is actually for the community. No, it's not just for the dev's. The community is usually the deciding factor. Game devs work for two reasons, to build their company, or to make money. Yes, some do it for fun, but at the end of the day, it's a job. Their job is to make people who play games have fun with their own games. This means that any successful suggestion will be oriented to make people have more fun. Not just you, not just me, but to overall improve the game.
---
Let's run your idea through these steps. First, only affecting players that want it, we could make a casual mode. Casual characters would be stuck in casual only, PVP would be turned off permanently, and respecs would be free. Additional details and features could be added, and the casual mode could be further developed. Maybe wackier legendaries could be added, like Fallout 4's homerun bat. Maybe camp budgets would be higher. It would be a different experience, just as survival would be wholely different if they kept survival characters alone in that mode.
---
Secondly, we would accept criticism from the community. People claim that your idea is too op, so why not compromise? You can make around 1400 caps a day if you hit all of the vendors, so why not make respecs cost around 700 caps. This is good for two reasons. Firstly, it gives Bethesda reason to ease up on the vendors being cap hungry. Now, characters can use their caps to re-skill. Secondly, it will take time for characters to respec, preserving the challenge of it. At the same time, you get what you want because you can just save caps until you want to get new skills.
---
Finally, make it fun to the player. Make it so that you can get special perks by respeccing or by rerolling what you chose originally. Make the new perks balance, but at the same time, fun. A perk that reverses mutations, making the downsides good and the good sides bad, while still working with the other mutation based perks. A perk that makes your non-human vats target slow down, working well against a single target, but not many. A perk that let's you build a working Ham Radio to play a custom sound track for yourself, and your party. Nothing OP, but everything fun.
---
My point is, as it stands right now, your idea is not great, and valid criticism is occurring. Calling everyone who disagrees with you a hater won't lead you anywhere.
---
I am not anti-challenge, I am anti-tedium. Want to make oil rarer in the game because it was excessively scavenged before everyone died, cool. Makes oil more valuable and adds some challenge to find it. Encourages workshop farming, but doesn't force it. Adding another thing to keep track of to keep my camp powered though is tedious. 
---
Only other one I hit was the more I think from doing l8cal events
---
You know, if you Store it instead of Scrap it, it *should* result in the same outcome... Then you're not wasting any materials.
---
I love it ! Really cool idea to build around a tree. Good job ! 
---
Neener, neener, neener.  
---
raised and stacked are different. I raise foundations as well.
---
I surrounded a metal extractor with foundation and built my home around it. covered the top with a roof and just the top peaked out. I was still able to loot.

Has anyone else have the insult bot seem broken to them? I have not once been insulted by him and I can't tell you how much more insulting that is.
---
He just says something like "stand back" or "wait" but then never insults. IM NOT EVEN WORTH INSULTING 
---
It turns out I had already found the shielded plans!
---
I need to find an exploding dragon. I have never got a tse myself, had one gifted to me, along with some t51 armor with a jet pack. Still looking for another tse of some kind. I have other two shot weapons but only the one that explodes and after the  nerf it's not really worth carrying without the demolition expert card maxed out. Only does 200 damage now when it used to do 488. I use it as a last resort now when fighting something huge or clearing an area fast. Usually I use my ghoul slayers fire axe or my anti armor hand made. Tho I found a 2 hit gatling gun last night

&gt;It turns out I had already found the shielded plans!

What should be true : While using a crafting bench, all of your crafting cards count as equipped and your normal picks are suspended until you leave the bench.
---
It's actually not in the game yet and the ones you see are from the dev room. They will be in the game at some point I assume.

I saw some like 3 days ago. I have them all Idc but I'm 100% sure

Heh...  I drop my weapons and armor all the time from hitting R instead of E or something.  Especially if I'm tired or in a hurry.  Usually I catch it as soon as it happens but it makes the heart skip a beat no less.
---
I too would like to know how rare this item is. I know it is on Ps4 as i have the plan for it, was just curious if it is worth anything.
---
Their ass, that‚Äôs where. It makes zero sense for Bethesda to do this. Less than zero. I‚Äôd bet the proverbial farm that this was never even a remote consideration. 
---
Thanks for the info
---
Yay !!
---
When does this feature come out
---
I'd rather have a player operated machine gun turret. Like the kind you sit in and can swivel ect. At least .50 call double barrel but I'd take a 20mm lol
---
Yea fear of loosing 51 black titanium scrap and 25 ultracite scrap to 2 scorchbeasts

The worst Insult of all hahahaha

Been roleplaying a shopkeeper for a while now. A faceless vendorbot during the Fasnacht parade at the [Helvetia Market](https://youtu.be/RTYsTFUBzz4). And currently running the filthiest plans shop in Appalachia, [Hog Heaven](https://youtu.be/V2axR9SqfFM).
---
What would the insults be tho?
---
I would try to buy them at r/Market76
---
Keep grinding.
---
Or you can use two or three days worth of max vendor caps to buy them from another player.  Can usually find them for 1-1.5k caps each if you look.
---
Well man deciding to prime an ammo-chewing machine gun knowing full well it take a metric shit-ton of ultrarare hard to come by materials to craft was your dumb mistake to make.
---
This would most definitely be abused. Unless there were preset options.
---
Insult Bot has some great ones already
---
THERE WAS A DONUT RECIPE?!
---
Your pc is just connected straight to the modem? Do you have no other devices?

I really appreciate it! But unfortunately I am on PS4 :(
---
The quest at the airport in, cant think of the town name, close to the vault, it starts for me every time I go toward the back corner. Kill 5 waves of scorched and get a supply drop, some loot for the quest, low level weapons and ammo, plus the easy xp
---
That's a clever idea. Kind of blending the immersion factor with the monetization factor!
---
The only problem is that some people (no idea how many) would prefer the junk version, and if they constituted a majority then the cash shop would suffer because folks would just stop spending on reskins.
---
But I think you're on the right track. Bethesda (and many other publishers) just need to find the right balance between servicing themselves and servicing the fan base. I think many gamers, maybe even most, would be open to spending more-- they just don't want to feel they're being taken advantage of by marketing tactics in their video games. After all, we're here to have fun, and the creative/building side of games is really starting to take off. So I'm fine with spending so long as I get good value, especially considering these goods are digital and will disappear away when/if the game eventually does.

Junk, i never payed attention to non bulk items so i ended up with like 300+ gold and silver, 400+ antiseptic and more in my stash. Aside from Rarer items (Springs, Screws, Lead, Plastic)  I bulk to about less then 150 and sell the bulk. Everything else again i sell to about 100 left in my stash. 
---
Ammo, pick your choice and stick with it, either ballistics or energy. With the ammo perk ammo stays on you and never in your stash. Only pick up what you need as well. I have a shotgun, Homemade rifle and level action rifle. I have no need for .308, 10 mm, .44, .38, .50 ammo. I keep .50mm ammo for the TSE Gatling gun i found. 
---
Aside from some neat unique weapons pick your weapons and stick to it. Unless it's useful; legendary or has a good mod you can't do yourself then scrap it or sell it. you can always make another one when you need to
---
I never keep food in my stash. I can find food easily, there is no need to keep it on hand. same thing with drugs (except Rad away for nuke zones) I sell all my drugs
---
I've looked at some things and go oh a pound for this a pound for that won't hurt but do it over 30 or 40 items and you start to see the difference. 
---
I completely agree with you. If the prices were reasonable I would have bought a whole bunch of stuff by now. These rushed sales and going out of business style practices are making me promise that I'll never buy any atoms for this damn game.

Perfect example, the Blackbird paint.

I would have bought it, never even saw it. Because the game was running fine my game didn't have to reboot for a couple of days and I never even saw for sale.
---
Same thing just happened with that stupid free hunting cap. Was never able to get it because it never showed up in the item shop is free because my game didn't need to be restarted.
---
They said everything would be able to be earned free, but now that's not possible because there's no way to earn that many atoms in the game.
---
THIS
---
I get the feeling that this system wouldn't end up how people hope, as they would need to make high intelligence have a purpose (likely resulting in a 15 being needed for at least something).  Otherwise there would be no point to having an intelligence above the highest required passive unlock.  Though I admit I like the concept of tying potential passive cards to the functional stat (instead of the special listed stat), giving stat altering effects more influence.
---
Wow, that's awesome!! Thank you so much. I'll add you now. 
---
Yeah when I feel like a game is just cashing in I usually bail. SWTOR felt that way too me after a while when all the cool new content started coming out of crates. It sucks, and it is a challenge. I miss the subscription days where there were no cash shops personally.
---
No.  If the claimers abandon their takeover, it is still owned by the player.  Then they do it again: 
---
Start claim
---
Kill and collect caps
---
End claim
---
Repeat until victim server hops
---
Big congrats.
---
As a rather random question, did you open the perk card packs yet?  I‚Äôm curious as to their distribution at level 50.  I‚Äôve always felt they favor stats you avoid, but has been just a hunch.
---
It takes forever. I have it for one leg, still trying to get the other. 
---
it's so gross. there isn't any reason to buy anything at all because it'll just go on sale later so just wait ... it's a shame when building is your game and this is how we get variety. 
---
It is an awesome quality of life improvement but could see Beth hesitate; how would Super Duper work with this?
---
IF you want multiples of whatever then a proposal could be that Super Duper has no effect but Super Duper will still work if you one-at-a-time...
---
Coming
---
So I'm dumb for thinking that the weapon was meant to be used at all and that's why the put it in the game. Okay then.
---
The Insult Bot has his own insults. It would be great to pick which one though.
---
I have tricentannial paint on one just to differentiate between them with the atomic shop logo, because I have 3 of them on me and 2 more in the stash.
---
Added I‚Äôd love to check this out
---
It‚Äôs all in the title... I was really mad, right then. Anyone who has played this game a bunch, consistently has had those moments where it seems like the bugs are aimed directly at you lol
---
But I do truly feel like just because something is Beta or you‚Äôre calling it Beta or whatever shouldn‚Äôt let the developer totally off the hook. Some of the bugs occurring are bad and should have had hot fixes. 
---
Check your inventory
---
~~There is a work around for this. Iirc, you need to snap a letter above or below the letter you are trying to place then snap the new letter to that piece vertically so it lines up horizontally with the letter you were originally trying to line it up with. It's annoying and sometimes gets weird (letters wind up on top of each other and/or in an unintended spot), but if you keep at it you can eventually get the desired results.~~
---
Ok, so just after writing all this I found this short video which has a much easier method. Haven't tested it myself, but it definitely seems to be much faster. https://youtu.be/N6-BlpQOcYA
---
He also puts a letter in your inventory.
---
Goddamnit there goes my precious bomber jacket.
---
Split the baby, let you make a ‚Äúhand‚Äù of perk cards so you can quickly swap multiple perks between the hands
---
Just because it works doesn‚Äôt make it less scummy.
---
Yeah I understand how all of that works that‚Äôs my bread and butter but the game explicitly states the value of these things within your inventory when they‚Äôre nowhere near close to that price, that‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt understand
---
+1
---
"Grow" them as pets for your farm then at night....boom...night lights for the walkway, stairs, porch..whatver
---
Because of the slope, the downhill side is stacked two foundations high.
---
For my 2nd character, I wrapped the extractor at floor level in a 4x3 foundation ring and then built a 2x1 building over it.  I added a powered door with a pressure plate on the end of the 2x1.  You step on the plate, the door opens and the extractor is RIGHT in front of you. 
---
What level are the legs, I assume 50
---
Same
---
Wow, thank you, as somebody who always has to have an aesthetically pleasing camp this is a life saver.
---
Insult bot has been stalking my husband. He shows up randomly while we are adventuring around the world. He gives zero insults but is 100% infatuated. 
---
There is a lead node with 2 steal deposits just north of monongah.
---
Thanks for taking the time.
---
I would love to see some armor piercing perks for pistols. I'm level 45 and still using my level 15 Somerset Special because the 50% armor reduction just makes it better than all the higher level pistols I have access to. 
---
Nah, you can't even machine a screw at a workbench, so a flag?
---
I don‚Äôt think so, I got one yesterday too 
---
Na, you just need to give it a few minutes to start playing
---
What the fuck is a legendary character?
---
I am on ps4, for all those wanting it on pc or xbox i am sorry.
---
Which vendor did you buy them from?
---
I think it might have something more to do with trading to other players. Think about a car dealership. If you sell it to them, they will give you less but it‚Äôs easier. If you sell the car to another person it‚Äôs more effort but you‚Äôd get more money for it. 
---
Ive been searching forever....its basicly the main thing i do when i play. I got lucky and found the bos chest plans early on (at camp venture).....since then , nothing. I traded for the leg plans, but im still looking for arms.....every day....please god help me.
---
Well, being a heavy energy weapons user in PA, I cannot say I have the same problem. Consumption, especially after SBQs, is to be watched. Sure I could spam events and workshops all day, but what would be the point? I've been there, done that.
---
It is an unnecessary downgrade to Quality of Life. What would be the point? Guns breaking after 1-2 clips is fun for almost nobody and this is in the same category imho. 
---
I'm with you. I'd rather not admit just how many hours I've spent trying to place things as perfectly as possible in my camp. I suppose the satisfaction is worth it though...
---
its a mod, so you add it to your existing legs. 
---

here is another camp i did. i Have foundation hanging off the bridge. i stacked some to make a staircase too.
---
Hey u/valseek, u/lonevaultwanderer, u/jessBethesda, could we get an update on this topic please? 
---
Press F to pay your respects to the pump.
---
I love it. I feel like 76 has more of a new vegasy soundtrack with its old country less swingy like in 4 &amp; 3. I loved the new vegas soundtrack big iron started an obsession with marty robbins. 
---
I paid 4k for mine...lots of people sell it 4-5k
---
Smarter people than me have said the game can do a random roll of your chances for super duper across a craft all function, doesn‚Äôt seem that hard and would probably make the game even more stable.
---
Naw man, 100 molerats
---
Yeah, plus the majority of my Fallout 4 playthrough was settlement building, had to make everything look nice while functioning, Hangman's Alley was still my favorite because I had so little to work with it was a huge challenge.  Ended up building upwards with supported structures for stability.
---
Try moving it. If something is in the front of it too close you'll just do nothing when you try to use it.
---
What system you on?  I might have some.
---
It's listed on "Known Issues" - 
---
 **Brotherhood of Steel mods/plans no longer show up at Vendors since Patch 5.**
---
* **STATUS**: We are looking into this issue.¬†
---
I have only found them from Savage Divide Treasure maps, however they used to be available to purchase from the Grafton Train Station Vendor
---
It‚Äôs hard to understand the depths of just how bad the perk system is. Pistols are shit, strength can support THREE different weapon types, and there are a smattering of type specific stuff just randomly thrown around.
---
It is truly garbage. Bethesda give me a week and I‚Äôll have a better perk system, passive perks included, fully designed and ready to go.
---
‚ÄúGive your balls a tug you tit fucker‚Äù
---
Bring back a Perk Tree for investment, and diverge combat skills into the perk loadouts.
---
It'll diversify classes and unify services.
---
Crimson inside those pink trees near the Prime for SBQ.  Has to be recently nuked.
---
Very nice.  When the time comes that you need to make a concrete wall and can't, the white inside of a brick wall might make a passable substitute.
---
Not in power armor?
---
Maybe they can let us craft bulk items instead? 
---
No, plus this happens only on tinker's
---
I set up my camp next to it the other day. 
---
Lots of ticks one day. Bloatflies the next. 
---
Hi ! glad I found this! I'm on PC username Sipsissimus. 
---
Sometimes recently, my AWSD does not respond. more so when in doors. navigating the pip boy works fine its just the movement of the character that doesn't work or is delayed. please help game's nearly unplayable right now! thank you!
---
No you don‚Äôt need materials even if it requires flux, if you have the mod then it‚Äôs free no matter what.
---
I can. I need that trophy too.
---
What is the item?
---
That‚Äôs a heavy pistol. 
---
Weird and even a reboot of your system didn't change anything? I would file a report with Bethesda.
---
I‚Äôm in the uk and with EE so currently use there Smart Hub Router.
---
I use WiFi to my devices and Ethernet to my PC when playing FO76.
---
[smart hub router](https://shop.ee.co.uk/broadband/smart-hub) 
---
You must have something that work in the same way, a basic null modem is ancient you must have a configurable router thus can instigate Port Forwarding for your gaming pleasure, or you are using a personal hotspot via s mobile devise as I suggested.
---
Yep. I dropped a 2 star .50 machine gun and somehow caught it before it was too late. 
---
Agreed!
---
Had this too and i had a nice spot near the train station at top of the world. It was a Junkpile and the street was a nice flat area to build. Also you had a vendor next door. Sadly this area is bugged and i got my camp removed. It's close to a non build area. Now I just go for water.   
---
East of that area is a lake and in one of them was a small bank where you can place your camp. I now go for water. Getting purified water is kinda hard to normal gameplay and its better than the cleaned water.   
---
it is a legendary pistol that has the Medic's prefix and 2 vats related additions, it is a 3 star
---
Like the phone menu in GTAO
---
They're a very rare item. My solution was to put my jet pack X-01 torso on my T-60 suit. T-60 calibrated shocks are less rare and T-60 takes a lot less materials to repair. 
---
Is the challenge up for it yet?
---
And replace my 4 mini nukes?! Are you mad!
---
Micheal was a simple man. Born shortly before the vault door closed, as a 26 year old man he didnt have any of the "exceptional" skills that the generation before him had. After oversleeping, he decided to make use of his alone time before the vault closed to snoop around. Discovering the Overseer's plan, he decided to track her down, getting into all sorts of wacky adventures along the way.
---
After launching a nuclear missile and killing a scorchbeast queen, Micheal realized his life was just a tad too exciting for his liking, and decided to settle down in a shack by the river. He now owns and operates Mike's Rest Stop, a place where traveling wastelanders can cook some food, repair their gear, take a well-deserved nap, or even relax with a guitar by the campfire. After meeting a drunk robot, he even built a tavern.
---
I hear he's working on building a vending machine so people can buy stuff even when he's out gathering supplies or visiting his friend who somehow built a castle down the road.
---
I have ran into Insult Bot so much that a friend of mine has created a little back story I would like to share:  
---
Insult Bot comes up to me and does what Insult Bot does.   
---
I turn around and Insult Bot realizes it is me.   
---
Insult Bot mumbles "Not this guy again."  
---
Because I love doing emotes not only to other players but the robot NPCs also.  
---
So I imagine I would talk to him and try to friend him. Every time I see him I get excited. 
---
I would agree with that. It's the only reason I hold.onto 5mm and .50. I hand give them tonthe heavy gunners when I see them.
---
I stopped going to low level workshop events, because friendly or not, the owner just hops servers. 
---
Umm what?
---
&gt; I believe fallout 75 
---
they made a prequel to 76? 
---
Did you even bother to read my posts?  Someone was talking about getting griefed and I offered a solution of logging off to avoid letting the griefers kill you.
---
I never once said the person being griefed is at fault for something nor that if they dont log out or server switch then they deserve to be griefed.  You make wildly inaccurate accusations based on something I never even wrote, maybe you think I was someone else who did write those things.
---
Perhaps be less defensive and confrontational, because the way you have been acting here says a lot about you.  Again, for the like 5th time, the system is broken, griefers are aholes, and people getting griefed rarely deserve it.  I've made that clear on numerous occasions.
---
I never went back and changed how I felt or responded in a different way, you have simply been unable to communicate in a way that makes sense.  You should spend a few minutes and go back through my replies to you.....maybe then you will see that you have been acting absolutely unreasonable. 
---
And if you cant see that, by all means, good luck in life cause reddit shouldnt matter that much to you.  Try calming down a bit, maybe go smoke a bowl....you have some major aggression issues man lol.
---
but...but...did you get the longcoat
---
If you could place bets with and win caps on these games...holy nuka that would be awesome. 
---
Yea those fusion cores that are ‚Äúeverywhere‚Äù are now only 25% charged instead of 80%+ like they used to be. Gotta say I‚Äôm not a fan of your idea. In fact I‚Äôd like if they did the opposite and let you recharge 1 core at a time in the fusion generator at your camp. 
---
I dont think you realise that with a bounty, there's no such thing as slap damage. It's full damage off the get go to everyone you walk up to.
---
Yes, quick consume food. Tldr the rest.
---
I went 50 levels without "searching" for ammo, because I thought it was automatic. I'm pretty sure you never had to "search" containers in Fallout 4, so it just never crossed my mind. I missed out on sooo much ammo.
---
I can back this claim up as well 
---
No I meant 76 oh man?!?!?
---
You can go to any area with a deathclaw, try deathclaw island southwest(I think..) of the map.
---
Nothing helped. Yea, I probably will, just wanted to try it here. Thanks anyway :)
---
I see. I haven‚Äôt come across any yet. I guess that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt know about it. Do u have to make it yourself or it‚Äôs buyable? Cos I haven‚Äôt seen it anywhere. 
---
Checks out. Thanks. Wasnt patient enough. 
---
The reason it probably isn't like that in general is because of the way Super Duper works.
---
April fools was yesterday, buddy. 
---
It was put up today....much easier than last weeks
---
(Xbox)I'm the Appalachian Creep Clown.
---
Or at least that's how I phrase it.  Since really early after launch I've been wearing the Clown Outfit and Fanascht Man Mask, and frequently chase random people with a chainsaw (dual bar flaming after a while).  I've worn nothing else, except when I need fancy dress, then I wear the "clean clown outfit" from the atom shop.
---
If I find someone at their camp, I'll sit outside a window and just stare creepily into it.  I'll sneak up on my friends and start revving the chainsaw.  I look for new players in the woods and start chasing them around at night. (usually I'll leave them a goody bag of supplies after a short time for playing along).  I even got the "PlayTime" power armor paints so when I climb out it's an extra layer of creepiness.
---
It became a hit with friends who do a lot of instagram posts where I'm creeping in the background or something.  It's definitely added a layer of entertainment to the game for me.
---
I like to think I had some influence of the mask/clown outfit combo making it into the Wild Appalachia trailer, but I doubt it.  That's just wishful thinking. =P
---
Anyone who says 'have a great day' on reddit gives off that *fedora feel.* Either that or triggered, but I'm the former. So I guess we're all scrawny nerdy dude's here, right ? ;)
---
Omg if this is for real I am gonna cry tears of joy 
---
Honestly,I would like to just have some new wall types. Or maybe for the wall types to work better. I like to make the inside of my house brick and would love to put red wood or brick on the outside but I can only put the white wall from the other side of a brick wall on the outside of a house
---
Yes, just heard this for the first time the other day. I was selling to a vendor bot and kept hearing the beep and turned around and there was a crouched player with chameleon armor. I'd had this same question for a long time as well.
---
I haven't tested it fully but I suspect the chameleon armor gives additional sneak over the mutation with each additional piece giving additional sneak benefit. 
---
I don't know if it's audible to enemies or not, but I would suspect either not or negligible. 
---
Make it a cap fee
---
150 here with over 400 hours myself. I get good drops ALL the time. Farming is a grind. And they call it a grind for a reason. 
---
Cool, you on now?
---
There is a visual clue that can help you find the source, but I don't want to say more than that.
---
Roughly 168 Atoms per skin if ye get both bundles, not a bad price.
---
Does the price change if you have any items already unlocked? Say for example teh Overstuffed Chair (500) knock anything off the bundle price of 1200?
---
Ah, ok. I believe it‚Äôs the tactical one. It‚Äôs purely cosmetic. Doesn‚Äôt even have a level restriction. 
---
That was a joke. 
---
They're craftable after a certain point in the main quest line that I won't spoil unless you want me to.
---
Hell, I would be happy with the existing stairs if we could build them against a wall instead of in the center of the foundation block.
---
We need the return of junk EVERYTHING from 4.  All of the wood and metal walls in 76 are just so damn neat and tidy looking for crap pieced together using scraps.  The walls in 4 actually had some character to them.
---
Right now my camp is a pristine looking brick two story with a nice clean metal garage that I spent forever making look perfect... and I would dismantle it in a heartbeat if I could rebuild it to look like a REAL wasteland house.
---
Did you hack some of the terminals in the beta? I know I picked locks in the beta and it said I had like 80 something when I actually unlocked it because it doesn‚Äôt count beta ones.
---
Theres a concrete kit u can get in f076
---
I get the conservative approach to avoid a bad implementation, it just feels like the game is missing some elements that would make it feel like surviving in the wasteland. (and I don't mean unfettered PVP)
---
See, if you could use your CAMP to produce various goods and sell those, you could also buy energy resources from people who scavenge for those resources or operate workshops. Creating an actual player economy.
---
Right now the designers have to limit what can be produced in your CAMP because it could be spammed and exploited to over produce things that are supposed to be scarce. But add a cost to production and it actually creates a market of different players contributing in different ways.
---
You could make the production equipment cost a lot more power than lights and turrets making normal simple CAMPs still require very little resources.
---
We all have our faults, haha. Kidding, kidding!
---
Nah. Don‚Äôt spoil it. I‚Äôll get there eventually. So to sum up, 
---
1) get bulletproof perk
---
2) get dense mod 
---
3) get orbital grenade...at some point in time 
---
So you have multiples of the mod available? I wouldn't want to snag them out from under the others who have already asked about them. No worries if you dont! 
---
That could be useful. When I'm out exploring I hate shuffling perk cards and coming across a similar functionality at someone else's camp would be nice.
---
seen that before. he uses a laser rifle instead of super sledge. other than that no difference.
---
I second this. Man I want fishing in this game so bad. I would love to just spend some time at the lake to fish up some dinner 
---
they remind me of the Namekian Frogs from Dragon Ball more than anything. 
---
Rip pump, after finding out you can collect a hundred water in seconds from a water source I always fast travel to the nearest source if my camp isn't by a stream. The only real use for the radless water perk.
---
It could work if we created bulk items. 30% to create another piece or 30% to create another bulk, whereas the bulk gives you 10 items instead of 1, at the cost of 10x the mats. Should balance it out.
---
*Insert runescape reference/joke here*
---
Power armor is trash for pvp
---
Future update will allow you to ‚Äúprestige‚Äù your character once you reach level 50, resetting your level and giving you a permanent legendary trait; whatever those will be. 
---
Why?
---
You are running melee, so your best bet would be Assassins, Cavaliers, +1 Strength armor. Assassins makes you take less damage from players, Cavaliers makes you take less damage while running (as a melee user you should be running a lot) and +1 strength makes you do more damage with melee.
---
Just make a YouTube video saying that this is the main problem that the game is "garbage and unplayable" and Bethesda will implement real quick
---
Its easy to one shot imo its pretty weak, best armor is assassin sentinel armor  
---
I can see it now.
---
ASAM added to CAMP.
---
CAMP is located near Point Pleasant.
---
Molerats visit CAMP.
---
ASAM opens fire on Molerats.
---
Molerat corpses fall out of the sky all over The Mire and The Cranberry Bog.
---
Haha it'd be funny if they made a craft amount option and you superdupered 100 items at once.
---
What is insult bot I was playing and he went up to me but he said hold on hold and said stop and when I stop he come up to me and say nothing 
---
Of course! Sorry I couldn't fix it I hope you're a melee build.
---
Probably but I doubt it was 14 :o I have 64 hacked terminals
---
You can use whatever weapon and ammo you want. You wanna mainline a drill, be my guest. But don't convert your gun to use rare hard-to-craft ammo and then complain because the ammo is rare and hard to craft.
---
Well they did state that it was going to be a token system, that most likely means that you will have to scrap a unknown number of legendaries to get your second 1/240,000 chance at the item you want.
---
This is ridiculous i just bought the game, first i had to reset my router and rescan my game for errors. now its giving me this WTF BETHESDA GET YOUR FUCKING SHIT TOGETHER
---
That's entirely based on the rate of power consumption, there is a place between limitless energy for some reason in a post-apocalyptic world and extremely tedious resource gathering that you fear.
---
It actually opens up player economy for others to supply you with those resources for caps you get from crafting or adventuring. With their caps they can by stuff from you.
---
Click on it, it tells you what you have to do. 
---
Huh kills you steals your stuff and runs away lol
---
I have a keyboard that does macros so I just have it spam craft until I run out of materials to craft the stuff. 
---
Thanks this is helpful 
---
Newbie Power Armor Delivery Service. Quite often look for new low level players, dive over to an armor spawn point, strip it clean, (hey, I gotta make caps somehow) leave the power core in it, and drop it in front of them. Give them a thumbs up, and repeat. 
---
No problem, good luck getting this armor tho. Its super rare and very expensive.
---
Yeah but why is that? Do the protection stats just not apply the same in pvp?
---
Ya. I'm on. wallybrandi
---
Yea ots a crazy drop off. You can do the same amount of damage to an enemy with a crafted version as an instigating from a long range shot. Honestly its better to go crafted only black powder rifles if youre only doing long range shots like i do. It makes the legendaries basically useless unless youre close range due to the damage drop off over long range. 
---
I have a full set but unfortunately most pieces are level 15. You think that really matters? Again, I don‚Äôt know how the other protection stats apply to players and how important that is
---
Also while playing/spectating your hunger and thirst don't decrease. Also the dart board needs a dart minigame as well. Make it physics based so we can add obstacles.
---
Tod did mention a few times about looking into adding mod support for 76.
---
And adding fallout 4 assets won't necessarily hurt their earning from the atom shop. Vice versa, they need to fix the bad rep the game and the studio have right now. And adding those assets could do only good. On the atom shop they could add even more amazing stuff, the possibilities are endless.
---
Just imagine:
---
Glow in the dark skins
---
Pop culture skins
---
Paid radio stations
---
Clean and new stuff for camps
---
Real working mailbox (could send letters)
---
New turrets (plasma, gauss)
---
Minefield
---
 I'll pay a lot for all of these.
---
Could we also get those sweet log cabin walls?
---
It just isnt enough, what does power armor have like 400 I think im not sure, its very easy to do 1k damage in one hit, specially a melee player like you mentioned
---
It's a terrible way to do it then. Because there's no economy to inflate. 
---
There was no player merchant system or auction house or similar in the game at launch. What happens if you get 100,000 caps? You can buy stuff from the vendors? And that's it. 
---
They don't sell legendary gear, they don't sell rare recepes or plans, they just have regular gear and items. And not great ones at that. Now if you think that the whole "med items are scarce" concept is real then that might make a little sense. But it's not there. Rad Away and Stimpacks are not uncommon nor are they even close to rare. I've started dumping rad away in the stash or selling it off to save space. 
---
And for how useless caps are for late game, would you trade me a legendary 2-shot rail gun for any amount of caps? Or would you require an item of similar value in trade? 
---
I would totally move my camp to a radioactive pond if there were fishing in the game. 
---
That looks great! Did you just use the short shelves as the bar surface? 
---
As long as I‚Äôve played this game, this just thought me you can click on challenges.....
---
Thanks, I‚Äôm an idiot...
---
it's in the roadmap coming with the Nuclear Winter summer update.
---
"**New Feature: Legendary Players** ‚Äì An all-new prestige system will allow players above level 50 to become Legendary, resetting their characters with all new more powerful abilities."
---
Yeah I have been hopping servers for what feels like an eternity and I haven‚Äôt seen a single combat armor mod, of any type. 
---
The other day while building I disconnected from the server and all the walls in my stored tab vanished. Sad me. :(
---
You have a full set of that shit? Lucky. Level doesn't really matter, someone did a test and the damage resist of armor in pvp didn't help for some reason.
---
Wait what
---
This one used the supersledge, but i have only seen the usual obe before.
---
If i may ask, what‚Äôs so special about this specific vendor bot? 
---
Yeah you can collect from streams and rivers as fast as you can hit collect.
---
Fighting the queen join up if you want 
---
Bad coding. 
---
100% capacity?
---
Yeah the benefit to the armor is that it doesnt drop under weapons fire. Ive tried both and really didnt see anything different aside from the click noise from the armor and the invisibilty drop under weapons fire from the mutation. The other thing with the mutation is it activates when you are standing. I never fully tested that as I just dont think it puts you into a "sneak" state like crouching does. Plus, you dont get sneak damage pops when standing anyway so being invisible and standing doesnt really make sense to me. 
---
Does Scrounger ever reveal more 5.56 ammo for anyone?
---
The roving trader.  Un the past i have just encountered 'grahm' i just met 'legendary grahm * * *'
---
As soon as hot fix as done took over Berkeley workshop defense spawned a 3 * commie spider 
---
My camp is right next to the river. I‚Äôm going to go spam the hell out of it lol 
---
Yea added you on my xbox list see you there
---
Charleston is GREAT for glowing ones in the Capitol building.   They're freaking everywhere!

With them only saying "resetting their characters" it leaves a lot open to interpretation.  Since they did not clarify that learned plans and mods are safe, they might not be.  Based on just that one sentence, I would not be surprised if learned plans and perk cards all disappear (if not more).  I tend to be cynical though.
---
I've earned and spent thousands of atoms earned in game. 
---
I just bought a couple floors and the Mothman billboards and still have 1000+ atoms left and can rack up a couple hundred more tonight completing non daily / weekly challenges.
---
I finally got my cave-camp entrance to be completely blocked by "the wall" (stacked foundations). Now I can finally start accepting randos again!
---
Which now that I think about it, duh? I just used the pump because that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing forever lol 
---
Imagine you‚Äôre at level 300 and you wanna do this the time it will take you would be ungodly lol
---
More than the hate train would have you believe I feel!
---
Yeah I was lucky when leveling up. Everything is level 15.
---
This is where I start getting confused: how are people claiming saying those stats don‚Äôt matter in pvp? obviously you‚Äôre taking less damage with armor vs. no armor. I can‚Äôt find a clear answer on that.
---
All variables aside, you think I‚Äôm better off running full level 15 assassins vs fully decked out X01?
---
Yup!  The Messenger is a good one for these recipes fyi
---
It charges a base price, but what they don't tell you, is the price goes up based on how much your moving. Scrap everything and move an empty base, you'll get the advertised price, store an entire 3 story mansion, and get charged a crazy amount.
---
He pops up legendary from time to time, but it doesn't do anything, beyond sometimes making it so you can't interact with him.
---
4 months later and they still haven't fixed this i can't even fucking play, right after i bought it this is my first issue .. HORRIBLE
---
Aster is easy, there's a whole field of it at the back of the meditation temple place
---
I like the idea of global cap limit.
---
Should be limited by level.
---
50 x 2 .
---
100 caps per death , like this don‚Äôt mind me going more often.
---
Nuke the cranberry bog south of the Watoga train station and equip green thumb. Yields plenty. Keep in mind though, while a great spot for raw flux, not a great spot for radiation fluids and hardened masses. 
---
Scorched Beasts have the highest energy resistance in the game, so that is a highly inefficient use of those weapons.
---
Agreed guns break too fast, and ranged weapons are also too weak for the ammo requirement.
---
Also, I run PA all the time and frequently stop using Power User whenever my fusion cores start building up and wasting too much stash space.
---
If resources can be collected and traded between players, it just adds another dimension to the game with more player economy.
---
Someone did a test, but yes, I think you'd be better off using that armor other than x01.
---
Thanks for confirming.
---
I've hoped literally hundreds of times. I've found 1. The drop rate is just stupid low. 
---
You can sew together clothes though
---
Replace the perks for drafting lvl 5 armor and weapons with the ability to craft benches that can craft these items that way we dont have to swap perks all the time.
---
Much appreciated. Then that means I should also spec in the perks that boost damage reduction/dodge while not in power armor.
---
Yes, Bethesda! It will increase your income also üòâ
---
This has been a feature 
---
I get 100% charged fusion cores from containers, enemy drops, events etc. 
---
I run PA all the time and have never run out. The weak cores are just supplementary.
---
Personally I say make it like fo4 where pistols are kings of crits.  Make a line of perks that reduces the % of your critical bar get consumed when using a crit with a pistol and let pistols bank crits.  
---
That was why they were viable in fo4: the guns themselves suffered low damage except some of the .44's but those couldn't be silenced so didn't get all the sneak perk synergy.  But if you wanted high dps with pistols you could make a luck/crit based build and wreck face.
---
ps4
---
He‚Äôs wrong this has been a function from earlier 
---
SPOILER ALERT:
---
You can get the prototype paint from the plans in the white springs bunker
---
Very nice
---
yep stuck t 2/5 and 3/5 yet ive discovered the areas not marked
---
They aren't really though. As IS, yeah definitely. But how many mmos allow you to reset your skill points for a price? Real cash, ingame gold, rare crystals, etc? 
---
That aside, you can build your character to be EXACTLY what you want. As you said, YOU pick which stats you put points into. You decide to play a stealth character, or a melee specialist. YOU decide as the player. 
---
BUT, what if you don't get the right perk card? If it's randomly dealt then you have to wait. What if you don't get the perk you need for your build until level 100? Until then what do you do? Answer: Buy perk packs until you get that shotgun surgeon perk you wanted. That's what the random system looks built to do. 
---
Now to their credit, if this was their INTENT, the developers did not go through with it at launch. So I'd be happy as hell to see them finally gut the whole RNG aspect to character building and make a system that gives the players more control and customization.
---
For any game mechanic ask this question: how does this make fun for the player? RNG's aren't fun, they are gambling simulators that encourage you to keep playing and to spend money. 
---
Summer I think 
---
We‚Äôre you able to find the cause of the crashing?
---
Exploit with pocketed armor?
---
Looks like your domain name expired. Do you have another link to the map? I'm trying to learn how to map things from the esm and I would love some help if you are willing.
---
(Said in Sargent Gutsy‚Äôs voice)
---
You want to sew up a foreign flag?  First Canada, then probably Red China!  What are you, some kind of COMMIE?!
---
well that explains a lot lol, thanks!
---
Even better make the us supply requisition into a send Insult bot to player ...
---
Wouldn‚Äôt mind using those towers that way 
---
You say that like there aren't already numerous things about this experiment of a game that don't make sense...
---
Thankyou and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm giving it ago to hopefully make new friends.
---
TheMegaK, if you are high level, wanna do nuke missions? If your lower, wanna grind exp and mats?
---
Yeah, I realized after I wrote this that I apparently never paid attention to the Watoga station map. It's different than the others. I feel like a conspiracy theorist trying to find any small changes or any clues to something hidden in the game. On the plus side, there are people finding out about it now because I fucked up. 
---
thats a pity ive got a pair you could have bought
---
Sorry I didn‚Äôt know 
---
Quite a steal. 
---
Can't get on for like 10hrs at work
---
What was it?
---
Oh hey! Probably not much use to you now that you‚Äôve built your entire camp, but a while back I found an unmarked location in the Mire with a premade treehouse structure that you could build your camp on/in. 
---
I posted some pictures and the location [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/b2env7/mire_treehouse_camp_locations/?st=JU0ATHX0&amp;sh=d3e7a5a1). Because yeah trying to build a tree house from scratch is really bloody tough to get look natural. But good on you getting your foundation tiles to fit around your tree, nicely done
---
Thank you! I still have 25% budget too so definitely room for improvement.
---
I did open them and the selection seemed very random. I really couldn't identify any particular pattern and they even occasionally gave me duplicates that just disappeared, which was a little... annoying. 
---
Huh, didn't know it'd be that fast. Thx for the tip.
---
I‚Äôve found a handful. 
---
Im level 22,so missions it is!
---
Raza1849 im level 77
---
Living in North watoga as well? I hope they never patch this.
---
Ive manage to get TS 10 mm, one star legie only. Ive made it automatic with silencer. You would be surprised how much damage on vats build with crits it does. Not worst than rifle, the only minus is amount of ammo you can get through out.
---
That's why I told you good homie. Just wanted to put up the spoiler alert in case someone didn't want to see it.
---
I have that same one. Got it a few months ago so they do exist. It just currently bugged making it worthless.
---
I‚Äôd say just a lucky deal
---
I've only found normal ones
---
i really need two shocks :(
---
i wanna use my x-01 but it needs to have SOME carry weight.
---
Pistol builds have always had these problems, it‚Äôs infuriating, but now I‚Äôve come back from a break and my pistol build feels so so much worse. I have 5ish pistols with different styles and they all feel super weak. Yesterday I had to run from a lvl 50 gulper as a 110 full build because it was just eating my 44 rounds like candy, vats weakpoint criticals and all. Meanwhile I still see explosive shotguns one shotting large enemies and destroying player bases in a few shots or tearing scortchbeast out the air by crippling wings or hammers one hitting everything. Just makes me want to play one of my alt characters bc what I find fun just isn‚Äôt fun anymore.
---
What is this server not responding rubbish that occurs in survival mode? Bit of a killjoy
---
Wow, thanks. I would never have tried that by myself. I've scrapped a ton of both of these and never learned to make a bayonet, so if the plans exist they must be a physical drop
---
150 VATS criticals
---
I‚Äôm not gonna lie and I very much think that people will heavily disagree, but I genuinely believe we don‚Äôt have enough perk points in this game, it really dampens the experience when I have to be careful with the points I want cause most likely if I swap out points I‚Äôm screwed and will lose more than I‚Äôm gonna gain. For example a max intelligence has no reason to move any points elsewhere due to how useful pretty much every perk is in intelligence, bonuses on stuff you build and better stimpacks. I need either more reason to swap points or more points cause this is pretty boring once you‚Äôre past level 50
---
I'll add you when I get on and send you a message to meet up. I'll have the caps ready, and thank you ‚ò∫
---
Not a griefer just dont like his videos. There always full of bs
---
RIP. I remember people found that apparently a quad gamma gun doesn't exist either. Wonder what's so horribly broken about the railway rifle that it can't have good effects or even perk benefits
---
Aight, Psn is TheMegaK, we could even do a nuke but you just don't go by urself xd
---
If you can figure them out let me know!! Have fun!
---
You were not wrong üòÇ
---
Is it the bug that makes it use every single fusion cell on u? Cause that was the reason I hated it in beta
---
I got this one during Fasnacht when the robots were lining up. I was wearing a mask, of course. Perfectly timed, Insult Bot. Perfectly timed.
---
Unique clothing and plans
---
I feel like you should not have to search for it.  Just at random put it directly in my inventory.
---
Oh yeah. Might helo if I knee your Gamertag, LoL. Mine's the same as on here.
---
We farmed them differently I guess lol I used to get them from all the power armor frames you find around. I almost never get them from containers and rarely from enemies. 
---
No they fixed that one. It's the one where now matter how many times you charge it up it only does one charge worth of damage.
---
Oh yeah. Might help if I knew your Gamertag, LoL. Mine's the same as on here.
---
Had a few now I have the one 
---
Excellent guide man
---
It says an insult? I have never heard it say any.
---
This gets requested probably 5-20 times a day. And they are starting to add display items
---
Extractor in my camp and i take lucky holes golf v
---
Club every so often
---
More than i need. 
---
Almost enough to make fuel but let's not be silly üòÖ 
---
I just put up a poster for a guide line so I only have to worry anout the left to right spacing
---
Power armor will probably be the last display because it has the most potential to break the game
---
Morgantown, that's the airport, sorry I had a stupid moment. 
---
Even worse, when I first started playing, I thought in order to be able to move a completed camp, you had to blueprint the entire thing.
---
I'd love for the limited time mosaic tiles to make another pass through the atom shop at some point as well.
---
How much you want for the tokens and the paddle weapon.
---
I need to try this.
---
If... if only most people in this community could have predicted that this would end up being "Fallout:Deathmatch".
---
Shock &amp; surprise, I tells ya. Shock &amp; surprise.
---
Yeah I just popped in and maps work the same as they always have.
---
As fast as you can spam collect, if you can hit it ten times a second you can get 100 in ten seconds.
---
Oops couldn‚Äôt find the image 
---
Yeah the ol' sheepsquatch questline, actually looks really cool
---
I also saw that last night! He didn't have anything different, but maybe when the legendary vendor starts....
---
Also a h.o.r.s.e type game for basketball hoops
---
Well, not stagger. Maybe the Uber-duration. That would make for a lot less Nuka-shine consumption. 
---
I want to just be able to type it
---
I like the idea of a leaderboard, but wish it didn't make you visible on the map
---
I have a motel called the Inn-n-Out just southwest of Morgantown. The downstairs lobby houses The Dirty Molerat Bar, and there is easy access to the river for swimming with only mild radiation. I try to keep an eye on my camp while I'm away from it so I can leave free outfits for anyone who drops by! 
---
(XB1)
---
Ok thanks 
---
Anything would be better at least they took away going past 0 and not being able to go back. 
---
Did you ever hear back about this. I am having this issue right now and it‚Äôs pissing me off!
---
You on PS4? Ive got a good handful of two and three star heavy guns if you'd like to browse my selection
---
The HANDS system, someone come up with an acronym 
---
ak56thethird lvl 49
---
Let us duel wield pistols
---
This is awesome.
---
I think this is the best move. Having perks that are always active kinda defeats the purpose of being able to switch them out so much and having such a variety of things you can do. Hacker and lockpick aren‚Äôt as important in this fallout as they were in 3 and NV. I go between playing solo and with a friend. As the builder I have a lot of intelligence perks and it would be nice to not have to switch between weaponsmith and the melee one, but being able to swap those out for explosive expert is amazing. I definitely miss the level system from 3 and NV as now I don‚Äôt feel like I have a character who grows through experiences in the wasteland. Now I feel like I can better adapt to anything that Bethesda will throw at me in the future. But I‚Äôll blow anyone on the dev team to get decks that we can swap between. I feel like a god damn fool after building my camp only realize I forgot to put in contractor.  
---
Wait so if you go to your quests the other ones aren‚Äôt available to choose? I know I had 3 or 4 of the main story quests going on at once before. 
---
You must really want views to be embarrassing yourself to post such a boring and stupid video on the internet.
---
Oh sir, The post apocalyptic roast
---
I would love this only if the bot actually had voice lines. If you bought it, you would be given a select amount of insults to send, and you would pay a certain amount for each one/ I think it would be awesome
---
I'd love if it there were difficult ones. Like you have to kill 10 mirelurke queens in order to make one. Or a max level legandary deathclaw. Something to work towards.
---
There are already fish to boot, I had my settings all messed up on PC &amp; water wasn't rendering, but the fish were. 
---
Sorry. Still don't buy it lol.
---
I feel so awkward adjusting any kind of large amounts in a trade. 
---
The Gorge Junkyard or Flatwoods are the closest ones. There's also one in Sutton, Arktos Pharma, Helvetia, and Point Pleasant.
---
Sweet!
---
My A button on my xbox controller gets stuck now because of fo76. F
---
If you want to do it how they intended, you will need a Keycard, all of the Silo codes (I believe it is 8 of them), the keyword in the Bunker to help decipher, and the knowledge of how the deciphering works (it is very complex).
---
Or you can look up the codes online. each week.
---
Radio silence since I updated saying that the patches haven't helped.
---
You can  Google the codes m8 xD
---
Try https://www.enclavedb.net/
---
No idea what you‚Äôre on about. 
---
Until you level up / rank up a perk, and it breaks everything until you revise all of your builds on N&amp;D again to put back into the ini file. So now I'll do that, just once every 5-10 levels because it is still a lot of steps.
---
I have Stabilised III, (also an anti-armour gatling plasma, but that's a different story). The armour pen isn't that big an issue, it's just laughable the damage:ammo value usage. Hopefully, selling fusion cores for caps might be viable one day yah.
---
Me too every time I am so tempted to just throw them the extra 23 and then I'm like no no no that's not what we agreed to I better go back down. Then I have an inner debate about tipping and by the time it's over I have finally gotten it just right......
---
You get extra 100 to carry weight when you login with your excavator PA on. Once you exit and re-enter it the weight limit goes back to normal
---
Of course. Sounds about right. So frustrating. I literally HAVE everything. 
---
I was literally thinking about this when I saw my first insult bot. Like I want to be able to record a message and everything
---
Thanks, the roadmap helps a lot.
---
use the triggers/bumpers (if you are on console).  It increases/decreases them by a larger amount.
---
Not sure the keyboard command, but I am sure there is one.
---
Do you happen to know what the difference is if I fix the thing or not? Will it affect outcome or rewards of the quest?
---
Oh I've been fighting with Vilayer.com who I got the domain from to sort it, but they haven't replied to any of my tickets.
---
Here it is redirected

I've not updated the map in a while to be honest.
---
I made a script for exporting data from the ESM using xEdit here you can use https://github.com/Wully616/xEdit-json-export
---
Yea I want them, I can't find a seller
---
I will buy it from you for 250 caps
---
I just bought this game and can't even seem to get past the intro before getting disconnected. This is the worst 
---
Hey... I gave him many opportunities to insult me... gave him many more chances than Nanny and her stories (come on, admit it, you also sit there and listen to the stories) and he never does anything... so I save myself some annoyance and get some scrap.
---
i have quite a few , one being explosive. they are not new.
---
I'm on a PS4 and yes I know that but it's still more time consuming then it should be and you still typically don't drop it right on the number and if so you must be phenomenal at filling your gas tank at exactly $20 cuz I tell you what I'm almost always at 20.05. 
---
He has the Fire Axe plan. It‚Äôs the only difference I noticed
---
wait... it gets heavy pretty fast
---
This power creep you are afraid of, it's too late.  It's already here.
---
Making some perks passive wouldn't change what players can already accomplish as far as min/maxing.  All it would change is the amount of time it takes to switch from one setup that is combat optimized to one that isn't.
---
You act as though this would open up builds that otherwise are not possible but I disagree.  So long as they only include perks that don't impact combat in any way into the passive category.  
---
So this means perks that say, allow you to craft higher lvl weapons but also reduce weapon degradation for example would NOT be a passive perk, because it has a component that is active during combat.  
---
So we are left with lockpick, hacker, woodchuck, green thumb, 100% of the perks that only work at camp, etc.  Not having to swap those into your build on the fly would be awesome.
---
Eh, I always land at $20.01.  
---
Thanks! Yes, I'd like to try to do it as intended.
---
I mean, alcohol is pretty much the currency of the wastes by the time we get to the timeline of F3/NV/4. How do you think we get to that point?
---
Agreed that pistols could use some love for sure. Especially revolvers and the plasma pistol that no one uses. The single action revolver needs to do more damage to be viable as well.    
---
I'd be interesting if quick hands was a more effective perk to counter some of that revolver reload speed.
---
Had several issues with lag this evening, temporarily freezing every few steps at one point. Had no disconnects tonight though, although it did reach the point around 15 minutes ago it was that unplayable I turned it off. On Xbox one.
---
When I did my first solo, we did it as intended.  We did need a little help figuring out HOW to decipher it, but we did.
---
Now, its look up whenever we decide to do it.
---
Cap oh yeah for sure I would but not atoms. 
---
Just says "they are looking into it"  
---
Its a survival horror mode of you are a low level who doesn't die a lot. Got to 2nd place just running around doing quests on a level 20 alternate character and was hunted down by a level 200+ in the Riverside Manor. Hiding behind a chair in a dark room as the stealth boyed up tin can passed through killing scorched with a explosive handmade... 
---
The insult bot is hilarious üòÅ I was having a moment playing the banjo at the Sutton station, the insult bot walks up and is like "Halt" and like hey you come here lol üòÇ
---
Just added you
---
My pistol build character has the Chameleon &amp; Speed Demon mutations (among others) and mains a Bloodied Black Powder Pistol. Hits sooo hard, and the reload is not nearly as bad as the rifles; especially with speed demon buff. He did take a pretty big hit when they nerfed the 'one shot damage' in PVP though. If they make pistols stronger he'll be a beast!
---
Perk loadouts combined with temporary context switching would work well. Open a trade window and select your trading loadout from there and it applies while the trade window remains open. Close the trade window and it returns to the previous loadout. That way you could have loadouts for everything from crafting to lock picking that you can switch to with one click and are automatically switched back when they are no longer needed  
---
Did you find a .. Special tree house? 
---
It's the best!
---
Okay, maybe try adamantium skeleton. It prevents stagger effects from your limbs breaking. It seems like a necessary perk for PvP, and really nice for PvE against staggering-melee monsters, like Yao Gauis and Mirelurk Kings.
---
When folks use marsupial, bird bones, and stealth boys to dodge weapons fire, it makes me wonder why I play this game. Bird bones makes them lag in mid air, and I can't knock them out of stealth even if I do land a barrage.
---
HOA SAPPER.
---
Action points (AP)
---
Same boat as you.  I need BOS arms.  I did get the chest from maps.  I believe the devs know this is an issue.  It would make sense to fix along with next weeks camp/vendor update.  I mean they are adding all faction vendors to Whitesprings, why not fix then!  
---
Hahaha im not a homophobe üòÇ but im not surprised to see someone like you (personality, not sexuality) overreacting and blowing things out of proportion. Also, makes sense why youre so butthurt.
---
It also added a Vault Girl Mascot Head, a scientist clothing set, and two free Vault Tech frames to the Atomic Shop
---
Armor (the numbers) have diminishing returns. The legendary % damage resists stack better. You can find the detailed math elsewhere, but that's the simple story. 
---
Noone is enjoying it to be #1 for no reason at all xD. And if he had a huge bounty he probably killed a lot of people. Thats what survival is probably. If you hesitate and regret before you shoot you are even gonna die to low lvl people, lol.
---
Yeah that's what I saw, I was hoping for patch notes with Survival Mode dropping. But hopefully there's an update with player vending rolling out because I've been desperately searching for them.
---
The bar is made of bookcases.
---
Insult bot?
---
It means you could run for longer before having to stop 
---
I'm on ps4, but I need the full set hahaha. I really appreciate the thought though!
---
I love what FO76 is. I‚Äôve had so much fun with this game, but I don‚Äôt think I could ever not be bothered by the way glitches affect it. Particularly when a server crash means you lose stuff that you put a lot of work into playing solo. Build up a workshop? Gone. Cleared most of a nuke bunker? Time to start from scratch. Finally nuked an area? Too bad, never happened. SBQ raid? Say goodbye to all that ammo and durability you wasted. Gathered valuable flora or cooked a bunch of food? Probably spoiled now. Amidst trading valuables with another player? Well, better check to see if it‚Äôs still in your inventory. 
---
Usually when I get angry with video games, I‚Äôm angry at my performance and am inspired to perform better. When I‚Äôm angry at FO76, it‚Äôs because the game just takes things away from me that it didn‚Äôt deserve. It does it *all the freaking time*, and there‚Äôs literally nothing I can do to improve the situation for myself.
---
Jesus you just made Bethesda a billion dollars.
---
If this is implemented, Im prepared to buy $100 USD worth of atom points JUST FOR THIS REASON.
---
Haha yes 
---
I usually see these posts on fo76 page. Don't  really see alot of pc posts, mostly xbox and ps4
---
It is a protectron that you can run into that follows you around till it calculates an insult and then roasts you viciously before leaving.
---
This is a hockey chirp if I've ever heard one
---
Hmm lemme fix it
---
...where is it
---
Yeah sure
---
Already loot them all, got some twice too. Am I gonna be rich with player vending?
---
Annnnnd he deleted his comment lol
---
mods are set to come latter this year
---
Overdrive Servos increase AP cost of sprinting though, they don't reduce it.
---
Optimized Servos reduce sprinting AP costs (but do not increase sprint speed).
---
You on PS4?

Apparently if you go and crouch and go hidden you disappear from leaderboard , alternative go to your camp and kill yourself before hitting the time leaderboard and you golden

Just maintenance no patch :) 
---
The only thing I can think of is maybe a performance issue with the auto piston? Idk I‚Äôm grasping at straws here. Like with a fat man it makes sense for balance purposes but also it‚Äôd nuke the server to rapid fire 4 mini nukes. The railway spikes are actual projectiles so maybe that would impact performance somehow? I honestly have no idea. I wish it could get that effect.
---
How so?
---
Gotcha.  My bad
---
Not to ruin a good thing, but I‚Äôve heard the copper dialog while wearing a dress. 
---
If you consider that the fermenter is already only accesible and tied to the stash I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised it‚Äôs on the next set of updates ( past current roadmap)
---
Damn... I wish this was PC
---
&gt; But don't convert your gun to use rare hard-to-craft ammo and then complain because the ammo is rare and hard to craft.
---
No, you don't defend Bethesda for putting a weapon in the game that is near impossible to craft ammo for. 
---
Someone has it out there. A guy made a post earlier about prestige hopefully not removing plans learned as he didn‚Äôt want to lose his shielded casual lining plan

Consider that asking things like this would mean having your 20 lbs + weapons having to sit on your stash having another 100 or 200 lbs of stash storage for this would be magnificent 
---
I dont want to rely on vats to use pistols. That just limits choice.
---
If they decide to finish the quest/event then there will be a presidential skin for T-60 I believe and the gauss rifle. Though those files have been in the game since launch.
---
how long does it take for him to insult you, ive had one follow me for nearly an hour and still nothing, the the usual "halt" "stop" or "wait" 
---
I ran into it last night by the red rocket station by the galleria, but I am pretty sure it is jist a random encounter that can happen in a ton of places
---
Every time i see that robot following me all he says is hey wait up an then just stares at me awkwardly

....my goal is to find him

I'd love to have cult based items and decorations to make a creepy camp
---
Are you sure about Dodgy? I can't find documentation on that anywhere.
---
PS4.
---
He's always got that plan and the Cuckoo clock. Had to have them when I seen them, lol. my Rec Room in my CAMP needs more Nuka Merch.
---
Hahaha, it is a worthy goal. I laughed my ass off as it roasted me
---
Hey are the items in the shop like the sale are those things gunna go away forever?
---
Any chance it unbanned those effected by the error 4:8:2000. One of my friends got hit over a month ago and he hasn‚Äôt been able to play since except for the 3 days before the parade event where they accidentally unbanned everyone.
---
Steel = scrap guns
---
Lead = farm the flatwoods gym daily
---
Both pretty accessible
---
All good, thanks!
---
The sale is great, bought the Atomic light and 76 Cap 
---
It felt like he followed me forever before launching his verbal nuke the first time, the second time was pretty fast. 
---
Could just be the text not updating.  Like Herd Mentality doesn't stop saying -2 SPECIAL when not in group, even though you have Class Freak on and can tell it doesn't give -2 anymore cause of your stats and carry weight.
---
The jail
---
 Not sure, haven‚Äôt seen posts about it.
---
What Jail? Where is it?
---
In addition to perks and gear, there are some simple tactics that are mentioned elsewhere in the thread. One of them is staying out in the open so you can draw aggro from the SBQ. Even for ranged builds, it's much easier to damage her when she's on the ground.
---
One fight I joined in at the 10 minute mark, everybody was standing in Forward Station Delta trying to snipe her. Melees were twiddling their thumbs (or preventing enemies from getting inside). SBQ was barely damaged. Once I got there, I ran out south of Forward Station Delta where I normally hang out during SBQ fights and she almost immediately aggroed on me. That fight went much more smoothly after that when everybody came out after she landed. Fight finished at about the 5 minute mark which is pretty good considering the rocky start.
---
Not in game, Google it
---
I just keep getting book case plans over and over
---
No, I think once you learn one you won't get it.  I believe the way people farmed multiple copies was they did not learn the plan when they first received it, instead turning in more tech data.
---
I have up to Elder learned so far, but didn't bother stopping and trying to get more, I learned them as soon as I got them.
---
Ok SPOILERS. I explored that place there moving spoopy objects. Buy i couldnt find the source of the scream, what was it?
---
Yep, they've said several times that mods and private servers will come, so far the timeline has been suggested as end of 2019/early 2020.
---
I agree there are reasons they *should* add FO4 stuff, but then, those reasons have existed for months now and the game has seen little new decor added (and most of it to the shop at a slow pace). So I'm hopeful but don't expect much.
---
I mean consider all of the assets modders have unlocked for FO4, and then ask yourself why they never showed up on the Creation Club or in an update. They're all owned by Bethesda, so why do they (and other games tbh) squander these resources?
---
It's a weird situation when you start to analyze it rationally, haha.
---
Regarding the pump, if you drink from the pump and then spam ‚Äòcollect‚Äô while the water is flowing, you can gather many units of dirty water just like in a river/lake.   
---
Lol!
---
add me, paskisr, wrong TZ but we've got a good group of friends from all over the planet :)
---
Even the tips say they're "peaceful by nature". Absolute evil bastard.
---
Yeah once I get elder I'm done was just wondering if in the future I want duplicates for any reason 
---
Absolutely sure? No. Serendipity doesn‚Äôt work with PA, but maybe Dodgy does. Seems like something I could easily test. 
---
Xbox
---
Yea I dropped SWTOR with the F2P update. It was already getting gouge-y with the way they chopped up content, I could see it was likely to go down a dark road haha. 
---
I don't think 76 is gonna be as bad as some other games. I think worst case scenario mods will improve things vastly, cause if they try to be too restrictive there will be another uproar.
---
Book Case plans?  From turning in Tech Data?
---
I hate to be a pain in your side. If I had the cards I'd test it myself. You are a kickass sensai on this stuff!
---
I join queen fights. I rarely initiate them. No, I don't bother with PVP. I use concentrated fire for the aim bonus on repeat shots on distant targets. It's possibly not the greatest, but I'm not sure any other perks are categorically better. I may try out 1/3 CF and 2/3 Long Shot, see how it's different. 
---
Why carry a BP rifle? What's it do that a Lever doesn't? I'm guessing it's your PVP initiation weapon. 
---
And yes, 2000 rounds lasts days, easily. In fact I haven't crafted .45 ammo since about level 30 (130 now on my sniper)- but then, I don't PVP and haven't seen many queen nukes in the past few months (I don't usually launch). I do have a handmade I use for queen fights; but it sits in my stash until needed, along with all it's ammo. 1000 5.56 rounds weights about 5lbs. Turning that into .5lbs is not worth 2 str points- might as well take strong back and gain 20lbs instead of 4.5lbs 
---
I'm not sure what you mean by "...would also make you stash bait"
---
I've got a dense torso mod, it's been all I've needed against SB, they rarely even hit me before they die, anyway. Again, no, I don't PVP.
---
Mister sandman is only active half the time, I'll grant that. But since literally all I'm looking for is more damage, it's easy to leave it in place, and the only other damage perk in Agi is upping my points in Adrenaline. At best I could swap it out for a bit more survivability with Dodgy, but in PVE, it hardly matters.
---
I \*did\* mention " Comments about most Luck perks are on point; I haven‚Äôt messed around  with them much to find an optimal setup based on crit/damage " didn't I? 
---
North of morgantown train station. I still think whitespring is the best place if you have a. decent weapon and lots of stimpacks
---
Any time I launch a nuke
---
I've had multiple copies after I've learnt the plans.. I only need the elder and the palladin now. I passed the spares on to friends. Sick of the sight of bomber jackets now though üòÇüòÇ
---
[https://nukacrypt.com/solved](https://nukacrypt.com/solved)
---
The worst for me was when I was putting the code in to launch a nuke. 
---
30 seconds before the queen died
---
I hope so I've been asking for this forever. Playing at high levels is super boring. 
---
Good god I can‚Äôt imagine‚ÄîI just launched my first nuke on a team of 4 a few weeks ago, the amount of combat is insane. Kudos for still playing after that man üòÇ
---
Oh no, I mean from the event with the scortchbeast outside the brotherhood base.
---
The overall vibe of the tasks/quests in this game honestly reminds me of runescape and that is not a bad thing at all. That plus fallout equals nostalgia overload for me, part of the reason I think I keep coming back to fo76
---
Has anyone data mined to see if the plans are even still in the vendor tables?
---
I would LOVE to know myself!
---
Man, If I could build a large cage to trap a deathclaw.....would save a ton of time from searching random encounter spots...
---
Any idea what determines if you're revivable or if you just die straight out?  Pure luck?
---
I had a really cool one at the queen once, I was attacking her melee style, facing down the beast 1:1, when the whole world went silent, everything around me went away and for a moment a quiet peace fell over me and the queen, we looked each other in the eye and  then it was my desktop, game gone!
---
It would be cool but they won't do it. Junk collecting is a main facet of the game and they won't want people to lose incentive for doing so.
---
Fast traveling across the map for an event and crashing as soon as I spawn in. I love wasting 50 caps.
---
Can you cannibalize the people you kill? Asking for a hungry friend. 
---
Thank you. I have been dying to get a Confederate hat.
---
I've handed in about 50 and haven't got any of the paints, so don't feel bad.
---
Really? I hadn't heard about faction vendors in Whitesprings! Hopefully they do. By the way, do you happen to know how much they cost from the vendor?
---
Immediately after finally joining my friend's server- it was full and they had a workshop they didn't want to leave. I spawned in, took three steps, and crashed.
---
At least my friend also got booted, so it was likely a server issue and not just me. Sucks for their workshop but we paired up on the main menu and jumped in with no problems for the rest of the night.
---
Did you help Godiva off her horse?
---
Appreciate it though! 
---
I can hook you up on the plan I have a few if you‚Äôre on xbox
---
what! i used to use the railway rifle all the time, im so sad to hear it wasnt actually getting bonuses :( glad to hear its being worked on though
---
1 star = 1 legendary effect
---
2 stars = 2 legendary effects
---
3 stars = 3 legendary effects
---
4 stars = you're drunk and it's a 2 star
---
5 stars = you work for Bethesda, you damn cheat
---
I had a legendary scorched explode a couple days ago lol
---
Good luck with that. After 5 months, the only skin for ultracite in there just came out like a week ago. Same with excavator. The only paint for it came out a couple weeks ago. 
---
Maybe get help next time. Also, at least you didn't launch it first. 
---
Not sure, but u/wally69666 and I just did it by repeatedly hopping off an observation tower.  Every time we got the 30 second timer too.  Worked like a charm. 
---
This would literally save hundreds of hours *for beginners*
---
I literally stopped playing because it kills the immersion having to pause every other minute and spend a couple of minutes just to open a door, or pick a safe.
---
They need a dual pistol perk card!
---
You'll get good xp just from claiming workshops and doing the subsequent defense events/killing waves of enemies. If you're hellbent on getting xp fast I also suggest clearing areas of enemies and quickly moving on without stopping to loot junk. Stick to melee weapons at first as they do more damage than early game guns and you'll spend less time scrounging for ammo or materials to mod/fix them. Don't move to higher lvled areas too fast as higher lvled enemies will not yield the same amount of xp for the effort it takes to kill them if you're severly underpowered. 
---
Maybe not the entire ash heap, but I definitely agree it would be really cool, challenging and unique to make parts so thick with smog it's hard to see.
---
I would've liked all the biomes to better a little more in depth. Like the cranberry marsh; to be large forests with unique wildlife, the trees looking a bit cooler and actually man eating plant enemies like they said in the no clip documentary.
---
And for atleast 1 city (maybe Charleston) to actually feel like a city, like Boston in fallout 4
---
I did see your post but didn't look at the actual gallery.(sorry bout that) 
---
When I was trying to use vats to get in it seemed to be really buggy. It would seem there is a invisible wall that instantly drops vat percent to 0 when you or the enemy is standing close to the station.
---
The Atom shop being greyed out when the menu first loads isn't helping
---
Lock picking is the best example. Why even have them separated into three cards?? What affect does that have? Also, it‚Äôs not like a level 3 safe is going to give you guaranteed odds at anything significant, so might as well just let people level that skill without any perk cards required.
---
you can see something like this in military wing
---
I think, \*think\*, don't quote me on this, it's because it doesn't exist yet in the lore
---
Links from this bot don't work.
---
our server was blocked after someone threw several orbital grenades 5 minutes after launching the missile in prime 
---
You're not. I honestly need reasons to stay interested in this game. I'm not sure how many copies of Dodgy I picked up passively as it's a survivability skill I haven't felt I needed with PA. Could be a good PvP perk, though with all the one shot builds. I'll shoot you a note tomorrow after I test tonight.
---
As an aside, I do want to temper your excitement a little bit. I have been using this build for a while (\~4 months, \~70 levels) so I'm used to dealing with the drawbacks. Your guns are going to break a lot and you're going to have to farm Aluminum to keep up. I play mostly in spurts so this isn't a big deal for me. If you want to farm Whitesprings Ghouls for hours, you're going to want to have a camp nearby or be ready to dip into the Bunker for repairs. The Asylum side of Fort Defiance is great for Surgical Trays and TV Trays which give 1 and 2 Aluminum, respectively.
---
Go to the market, let it set for a few hours, you'll get a lot of high caps offers believe me. 
---
At least 10K. If you‚Äôre on PS4 and wanna for a bloodied meat hook with 40% faster swing speed, hit me up. 
---
Duel weld should be an option, instead of 1 shot per click it does 2 shots and only does 75% of full damage. 
---
So if pistol is 30 and 30, does 45 per click. 
---
I feel your pain. This happened to me the first three times I tried it. Took ages to grind the supplies too. That was months ago now though. If you're on PS4 and need help, I'd be happy to ü§ò
---
Yeet
---
My guess is 10k caps give or take 
---
Darn
---
With my build, I can stand on a car, blow it up by throwing a grenade onto on a land mine inches from my feet, and saunter away with more health than I started  with and your concern is reality with bullet mechanics?
---
Praze the Lort and pass the rail spikes!
---
Me neither, I just buy them from people off the reddit 76bazaar sub. Jetpacks for around 2K and legs go for 1K each for shocks. Been playing since launch and never seen a useful x01 mod in the store.
---
That makes sense. A bummer since the best part of melee is not having to farm ammo. Still, I liked this style of play in Fallout 4, and this will be something to do while I wait for Bethesda to (never) fix the Chainsaw. 
---
I'll show my hand, by the way. I'm hoping Dodgy and Kinetic Dynamo synergize for big fights like the SBQ.
---
Wow lol I just looked at your response and we said the same thing pretty much (10k) 
---
Wait...you can't? Thanks for this post saving me time because I have a whole set and cues and was working to get plans for the table. Guess it was wishful thinking but I assumed even an animation like the instrument playing would be the reward.  That sucks...
---
My next character is inspired by the saint of killers from Preacher so I would love a pistol buff. 
---
Thanks, i owe you some trophy polish =)
---
I'm I'm the uk.. try survival mode, the 20%xp boost helps and at low levels, you haven't got a great deal to lose üëç you'll level up in no time.
---
Lol, it‚Äôs a pretty fair number. You could for sure get more than that out of it. 
---
I saw one at Whitesprings but he was surrounded by two assaultrons and a sentry bot. I wasn't brave enough to attack.
---
Well, until Fallout 4 neither did the X-01 suit, or the T-60. Bethesda's clearly willing to change the lore at the drop of a hat for money, and I'm willing to pay them.
---
Yeah it's in the Patch 8 highlights:  
---
##### VENDOR FACTION UPDATES
---
It‚Äôs no secret that vendors are some of the busiest bots in Appalachia, and we‚Äôre planning to make a pair of adjustments that should make it even more convenient to make those crucial trades with various vendor factions. With our next update, we‚Äôre adding a vendor from every faction except the Enclave to the shops at the Whitespring Resort. This will help reduce the need to fast travel all around the Wasteland to visit vendors from multiple factions. Additionally, we‚Äôre combining the Cap totals from all seven vendor factions into total pool of 1,400 Caps, which should offer you more flexibility in the trades you make with specific factions.

Modularized building. You can make platforms with the workbenches on them, drop them fast, slap some walls on them and you‚Äôre done
---
Yeah if he posts on market 76 and let's it stay there for a bit he could get even more for sure
---
If you can bother saying that, you could have bothered to use a search engine to see that the roadmap shows that‚Äôs already about to be released. Been public info for a while.
---
I'm in EDT but I play daytime here, which would be evenings there.  I'm an older woman if that matters, and I'm not great, but I will always make myself laugh and I don't care if you fuck up.  Merriam_hicks please feel free to tell me to stop singing along with the Appalachia radio...
---
There is a treehouse near there that has a computer terminal that explains it.  Basically it was a big hoax someone played. 
---
Oh, that sounds FANTASTIC!! I won't have to buzz around the map to offload all of my straight jackets and chems anymore hahaha.
---
that mod changed my life in FO4
---
I know I'm the millionth wanderer to face this, and I can be no more frustrated or important than the scores of folks before me.  Man, am I ever bummed out.  It's *really* fucking hard to do this as a solo player, especially as a *shitty* solo player.  It would be so easy to jump on the bandwagon with the same (often true) insults, but what I really can't get over, facing this scenario, is how *knowing* that this is a very common issue, Bethesda persists in taking poor coding out on the player, by making the player start the entire process from the beginning (or at least I presume I have to start at the beginning, as I was dumped outside of the silo site - in fact - the next hop away from it).  
---
Presuming I have to start from scratch, why all the "Checkpointed" notices, if those checkpoints are simply wiped away with a disconnect?  Why would anybody *intentionally* disconnect when they're that close to launching a nuke?  Of course you should be able to jump back into the same spot, or, at least, you know, *at the fucking last checkpoint*.

I never thought I would actually enjoy fishing mechanics until I played Far Cry 5. I played Fable, but was just too simple.

Yes, and sometimes upper 90's. I'm always using them to top off the two I carry, x01 and excavator.

Can you make one for me i can even offer the crafting supplies to make it

They are there, the leveled list "flags" got borked, capping some of the content the vendors get, plus they appear to have a max number of items they can display in each category 
---
Looks awesome, shall add you next time I'm online and swing by.
---
Got a good area in idea to farm? 
---
I'm still running into legendary mobs who aren't dropping any legendary loot when they die. And I agree with what sooooooooooo many people have said: "Killing a 3 star legendary should yield a 3 star piece of legendary loot".
---
I killed a sbq and died from a random scorched conqueror. Before I could get my loot bag or loot the queen, boom main menu.
---
I dont see difference in gameplay between pistols and rifles. The perk that adds run speed when using pistols could be a great differential but speed is capped at +20% and you can get to that point with speed demon. 
---
You know what would be great? Dual pistols. There is absolutely no reason why you can't use two pistols. DPS would be nice, you would be able to have two legendary weapons for different effects and it looks rad! 
---
That's sort of what i wondered.
---
I want him as a companion making fun of me everywhere we go 
---
Adding you. I don't get a ton of time either as a father of 3, work travel, etc. I get it.
---
Cheap trick but you can stand outside the bay of windows at the golf club and shoot into the horde of ghouls without them getting to you. It's good for farming, but pretty unfair as far as game play.
---
I haven't played for almost 2 months  because of griefers ... sounds like it's time to return! Thanks for the reply :) 
---
New atomic shop stuff, and a free set of photos backgrounds.
---
It has advantages and disadvantages like all the rest. The question isn't whether it's good, but whether it's good for you.
---
Coming 
---
With all the mole rats I‚Äôd like to launch them say at Mutants...
---
The final boss chamber is my favorite place for high quality meat
---
My friend will gladly pay 2k for it 
---
It could be a gold circle like for quests, to let you know a vague part of the map they're in. Easier to hunt down without being obvious.
---
Because they can... .
---
Guess I was lucky. He was alone 
---
But it doesn't seem to work on most duffle bags. The perk would be a lot more useful if it worked on more things like Can-Do.
---
There are 2 I check that aren't on the map. 1 on the road north of Point Pleasant.  1 almost directly east of the overseers camp.  There's a ropes course and the random encounter is east of the final tower.
---
I must say I've also had one that didn't drop any loot, but it is much lower than what it used to be. Before it was about every 4th/5th one that wouldn't have anything.
---
With your second point it is definitely logical that a 3* enemy should drop 3* loot, but at the same time I can also see why it's not like that. There would be no rarity in a lot of weapons/armour due to people being able to easily farm locations where 3* legendaries are almost guaranteed. I feel that 3* legendaries shouldn't be able to drop 1* loot though, most of the time it's not even usable stuff.
---
Launched my first nuke yesterday. Did a run through Alpha with a buddy today. He inserted his keycard and crashed while inputting the code. 
---
I stayed around but it forced him to go through everything again. Eventually launched it myself. 
---
Bulk your junk items. It won‚Äôt free up a lot of space but it will be enough to store a few more things 
---
First make sure all junk is broken down.
---
After that bulk aluminium and lead only. Only these two decrease weight.
---
This is awesome. I love hearing about other couples playing together.  Our setup is 2 TVs side by side while we sit together on the couch.  We've been playing that way since about 2 weeks after Fallout 4 released.  So 76 really answered what we were looking for. 
---
.... i'm Batman!
---
Scrap everything your not using it weighs less and at lvl 22 keep only the best weapons and armor you can carry you will get better. 
---
Thank you so much
---
As long as when you're fishing you have a random chance of spawning canned goods, junk and a mirelurk.
---
Only reasons I can figure:
---
1) it turns all the ghouls in the towers into bloated, and there's more there than at the Whitesprings (but the Whitesprings also has tons of nuked flora...)
---
2) to troll high level players into exploring a nuke zone that had basically nothing in it
---
I mean, I guess you could just because, but it seems like a fair bit of effort for very little payoff.
---
It makes building lofts almost impossible without gaps in the wall or a door
---
scrap non-legendary armor
---
Alrighty will do.
---
It‚Äôs just one of his lines.  ‚ÄúLook out, its a copper!  Just kidding, you shoulda seen the look on your face.‚Äù
---
You get used to hearing every one of his lines as you spam X trying to get him to give you his quwst each day.  As he goes on and on and on before finally starting the quests.  
---
Well its 10% unless u are at max budget then it will let u game it at 0 cost
---
My best armor isn‚Äôt legendary
---
Nope this was easier thanks.
---
As far as I could tell no? I even went back to AVR medical using the wiki to help me get there and there was no option to do any of the quest actions. 
---
Am I off-base thinking it‚Äôs dumb forcing you to start from scratch? I mean, what is the point of the check points, then?
---
Prize bot, insult bot, luv those fickers.

First encounter, one magically appeared next to me, on a cliff that no PvE enemy could reach, as I was sneaking into a position. I blasted it. Now, trigger control much improved, welcome but keep quiet please.

I just leveled up my 2nd PvP toon to 61. He's fully decked in good gear and already proven very succesful against similarily built enemies. The fun thing is I bought most of his armor for caps, people neglect its value, and nobody ever duped that crap. I'm kinda late to the game myself, people had such similar toons for a week now, some of them prepared in advance.
---
Whatever your suggestion for leveling the playing field would be, as long as its related to math and levels it'd probably do more wrong than good. I.e. I fight having caps on me and I have 220 and 60 toons. If they keep it as is, I'll be using both of them depending on the situation, and sometimes I'll be giving greater rewards. If they add level scaling I'll only be using my level 60 toon. No point in punishing people for thing that already gives them disadvantages.
---
They just did a hotfix. Why are the server disconnects not solved?
---
Really? Not worth doing then.
---
huh? what commitment? This argument only makes sense if you couldn't swap perks,  
---
for example I have all of the lockpick perks, but I only ever use them if I'm picking a lock that requires them.  If I'm not picking a lock that requires a perk card I have another perk instead that increases my combat  performance.  
---
So I'm ALREADY able to be a master lockpick without sacrificing any combat ability in any way.  the only thing is I have to go through this annoying, pointless process of swapping lockpick perks in and out.  
---
If I didn't have to swap the lockpick perks, it wouldn't change my ability to pick locks.  It wouldn't change my combat performance.  All it would do is let me pick locks without needing to go through a menu to swap the perks over and then back when I'm done.
---
What‚Äôs the last perk?
---
*Perk-less*  challenge...NICEEEEEEE good job!!!
---
that is still pretty awesome btw hahahah 
---
In the panel they recently did they mentioned they want to do more of them. 
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=rfyViQ9Uo_M

There all dead because of radiation 
---
or anything you dont use..also crafting ammo greatly reduces weight
---
Even when suppressed by Rad-X.  Test it yourself.
---
Wydm? Like by getting rid of lead and gunpowder?
---
Depends on what you are doing. There are certain places on the map where you often run into others.
---
I love building mid century houses, with sloping roofs and open plans, almost all of my camps have been built around vistas and not tactical or farming advantage. I wish it was easier to make houses have large windows
---
so what does letting people swap perks encourage?
---
PSN AndrewMosier. Official top hat farmer. Sigh.
---
Ya I noticed it too
---
Thanks - yeah I wont hold my breath as she just got frustrated and gave up trying to ping the commie-bots outside the vault.
---
I will just have the ever-ready battery (my step son) at my side - valiantly rushing into combat and missing all the stims and other loot as he just goes for the big shiny stuff.
---
It‚Äôs more frequent than you would think. I definitely run into other players multiple times every time I play 
---
Hopefully that add them. Doesn't make sense to have beautiful hardwood floors and new furniture, and smashed windows.
---
Only aluminum and lead bulking saves space. Don't waste plastic bulking the rest unless you're selling it to vendors.

Thanks alot!

Does the gamma gun still do no damage to ghouls? Because I just got a ghoul slayers gamma gun- and that would be hilarious

Not sure, I thi k it was faster reload speed or something

Is this still a thing?  I maxed can do and equipped it but I dont find anything in the trash cans at Whitespring.

I‚Äôll check

If the server is gonna carry so much of the load, make that bitch bulletproof.

No..if you craft ammo..it will reduce the weight of your steel/lead/gunpowder
---
I disagree.Shooting someone 10 times in the head while they stand there IS cheesy.
---
I run into other players all the time. Especially during events. I do seek them out on occasion, usually to trade, but sometimes just to drop gifts! Lol
---
Please. List. The. Platform. 
---
I don't know what they meant, but gunpowder is heavy, and making ammo or dumping the gunpowder if you don't plan on making any for a long while is not a bad idea. 
---
I don't like the limited time simply because my current character has a specific look, but if I wanted to reroll a new character the clothes might be gone for "good".
---
Need a td bank bruh haha 
---
I cant remember where it is on the map but there is a location that you can put your camp next to like 3 auto missile launchers and they will defend your camp if you repair them each time you get on. My camp is there I'll get back to you about it when I get on tonight 
---
Thank You Everyone! I was wondering how to do this.
---
I‚Äôve got about 70 of each in approx equal amounts from doing nuke zones. My materials were all wonky, though, until I started farming with other people. We basically swapped materials until each of us has approx equal amounts. That‚Äôs why I think that drop rates are sorta approximately split evenly among the flux materials- we each were generally able to make our overall pool of materials match up pretty well.
---
Also, if you‚Äôre getting into Ultracite, why aren‚Äôt you just buying stable flux at that point?  If you get into the more rare, pain-in-the-radstag ammo types, it may be helpful to check the marketplaces and save you some time to keep your weapon stocked up.
---
How about no server disconnects or hangs during multi-tasking?
---
I‚Äôve looked for months and caved the other day. Bought them from a guy for 2.5k. Honestly, I wish I hadn‚Äôt, the jet pack isn‚Äôt really that great. I never had to worry much about only one or two fusion cores until now. The jet pack eats through fusion cores so quickly. Something to keep in mind 
---
Can I get a messenger quest to escort the insult bot?
---
It's not a crazy amount of effort when you can get the nuke codes online just need the key card 
---
Are atoms earnable?
---
No you, sweetie
---
Their nuke. Their silo run. Their choice. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Best armor is "no server disconnects during battle".
---
Yeah I've explored most of the map and that did come to mind, even found the area before I started building what you see now. Only deal breaker was that it was located in a too remote location, whereas whitesprings is very active and you've got local security. The guard npcs make it more engaging as a "player home" area.
---
Not to mention my particular location is next to 2 vendors, soon to be all of them with the coming update. Thanks for the consideration though!
---
Thanks thats what I will do
---
How about no server disconnects?
---
That sucks alot of butts. Happened to me a few times, but one time the game crashed while in a trader menu and I got all my caps and items back for free with a bonus 200, so it almost evened out.
---
Similar setup. I have transitioned to buying mainly digital copies for this reason. Only reason to buy a physical copy is when a special offer is provided or I find it on a clearance sale. 
---
I‚Äôm sorry I have got quantum!
---
That's pretty bad ass lol ty 
---
No problem! 
---
Sony is the issue, not Bethesda. I believe it has to do with the same reason why certain mods just won't work in fallout 4 on ps4. 
---
If you're on PS4, I have one for sale for 2k.
---
It heals them. It's a pretty good weapon for trolling at the whitesprings golf club, but that's about it. 
---
You have a point there, but why go to the trouble of making a prototype paint only to make the actual paint then
---
I'm level 107. I check the Enclave every time I log into a new server. I have found them for sale twice. The first time, I hopped servers and it took me 15 tries over the course of a few hours (and that seems lucky as hell based on what I've read regarding drop rates).
---
Heck yeah!
---
Is that an actual acronym or did you just make that up cause it seems like you did and that's weird
---
Here here! My 10mm destroys when I‚Äôm sneak+vats+weak spot targeting but that‚Äôs the only situation it‚Äôs actually good in.
---
Get spotted? DPS turns to shit
---
Out of AP? DPS turns to shit 
---
It‚Äôs frustrating that it‚Äôs so situational.
---
I‚Äôd also love to see more non-revolver ballistic pistols seeing as the only options are pipe and 10mm. 
---
One of the things I always seemed to do in Fallout 4 was collect every billiard ball and cue I could find and pile them on top of the pool table in my house.  On one save I had over 100 of them....
---
I feel guilty every time I see these posts, about guys never seeing the jetpack mods. As soon as I finished my X01, I fast travelled to the bunker, and the first time, I bought a jetpack. 2hrs hopping for cal shocks, and I got ANOTHER one. 
---
Good to know. Super duper still procs with chemist so I generally find it helpful to load those two cards at the same time.
---
I wonder if ammosmith and super duper follows the same mechanic? These are things I typically do not give a second thought about.
---
you can see other players on the map and go seek them out if you so choose.
---
The best part was I was alone. It was easier before they nerfed all the tse.
---
I bought it day one, really liked it, then was very disappointed for a while, and now am back to loving it. It's worth the money if only to explore the beautiful world.
---
Sure, but you still have to shoot your way through a silo. Just seems like at least a modicum of resources (if only time and ammo) for a lackluster payoff when nuking almost literally anywhere else would be more profitable.
---
+ karma
---
You mean a hard to understand foreigner in a far off call center..... 
---
üòÇ If that isn‚Äôt a troll comment..
---
You can only move one perk point per level up though, so it ends up taking a while to really respec.
---
Yeah I understand that. Super duper and ammo Smith are more ammo then you will ever need. And if you a decent squad with nice weapons it won't take long going through a silo 
---
No Tim Hortons?  
---
Yes, these limitations are ridiculous, did not exist in Fallout 4, and are not needed.
---
Perhaps even worse, sometimes I have to use a trick to place a wall or floor where it doesn't want to snap. This is, adding parts next to it and the removing the unneeded part after; the desired part stays. 
---
What I discovered is that if you try to move your CAMP, or is impossible to place because it says that an item needs support. The part I placed with the trick is considered floating, and invalidates the entire CAMP. It could just leave out the invalid part.
---
These restrictions have caused me to needlessly rebuild my CAMP multiple times.
---
I take my time. It ain‚Äôt that hard and takes a few extra seconds to let it tick where you want it. What‚Äôs the rush?
---
Look at the fifth image
---
How long would it take to fix?
---
I had that perk for like two weeks before I noticed the search option. I felt a tad foolish.
---
I'm hoping it accounts for those of us well above 50. Spend 50 levels to get this perk, maybe 50 more to get that one.
---
Do you know a good way to get stimpacks
---
Makes sense
---
Oh hell yes!  Oh Caaanadaaaa!
---
Yup!  Sometimes simple stuff is the best!
---
Never. Use it whenever suits you. 
---
A very tiny update but would result in a **HUGE** improvement, is just rearranging some of the words used in the cards.   
---
Science card is the only one that I know of, that has the description of the card before the rank. If we could get this on every single card, it would be a much better overview.  
---
Hacker, hacker expert, hacker master  
---
Rifleman, rifleman expert, rifleman master  
---
Heavy gunner, heavy gunner expert, heavy gunner master
---
You get the drift. 
---
not added yet
---
it will be shared across ALL vendors in the next patch
---
Legit idea. I like it.
---
Not till next week
---
I've recently been considering only using perks for which I have the shiny animated perk cards. I'm at level 172 and that would still SEVERELY limit my options. I got a lot of dupes of cards like the one for harvesting extra meat from animals...and my character is now an herbivore...
---
Yeah he is such a drunk! Reminds me of having a convo at the bar with someone just before it closes
---
From the water pump‚Ä¶ select (Drink) and not (Collect). Then, as the water is flowing, spam (Collect) at the stream. You can grab 4-6 at a time. 
---
Who ever win at Monster Mash should get the option to send out the Insult Bot
---
It‚Äôs a drag, right?
---
Are you positive that post wasn‚Äôt referring to the Legendary Vendor coming in the future, as seen on the official 76 Roadmap? If so it isn‚Äôt in the game yet. 
---
It's in the Patch 8 highlights -&gt; Not out until 4/9 (pending Bethesda):

---
Yes!!!!
---
Of course then I‚Äôd probably start nuking my own camp....  ;^)
---
It would be totally worth it!!!
---
Can confirm super duper does work with ammosmith.
---
Don‚Äôt talk about the homie biv like that I‚Äôll shove a mini nuke up your ass 
---
Of course, I do the same thing myself (pretty much have to with an ammo-hungry heavy build,) and a solo silo run is no big thing, I'm just baffled as to the reasoning behind the target.
---
I suppose this also assumes that there was reasoning behind the target to begin with, and not just some bored person running the silo because reasons and dropping a nuke in a totally random place.
---
Destroy vertibot over and over to gain XP? It‚Äôs been out for awhile. Not game-breaking and it‚Äôs all over YouTube.
---
Yes. I‚Äôm sure. 
---
Just for that, next week you're not getting the mug &gt;:(
---
Imagine your working with LEGO 
---
&gt; These could all be fleshed out into a separate skill tree that is permanently bound to our characters.
---
sounds exactly like the upcoming "legendary players" rebirth feature from summer iteration.
---
But even if we have them as passives, card swapping will stay. Not craft/dps loadouts, but dps/farm loadout, or dps/explore, or dps/dps-optimised-for-molerats loadout.
---
It's about how much time we are ready to invest in perk swapping. While current system stays, it stays. Now we have, like, perk vs insects for example, I can't see any place for it, except somehow it's reiterated to be passive. (Even well-rounded team don't need "insect specialist".)
---
Also it's worth allow card swapping only in camp or workshop to solve lockpicking &amp; hacking management the hard way.
---
Its fine just allow a full reset after 50 no swapping points
---
Give all special points to 0 
---
Return and unrank all cards (with ability to choose from all cards from beginning at lvl 100

Pool and poker tables

Holy cow!! Thx for this!
---
I have not heard of that vendor...all the ones I see have 200 caps. Maybe it was talking about Graham. He‚Äôs a Super Mutant that roams the map. I think he has the most caps. If that‚Äôs the case there should be some posts that have studied his rotation through Appalachia 
---
I'm still on my original character that I started on launch day, but I would def avoid all quests until 50 just to get the max level rewards. Having a level 40 perfect storm bothers me so much. I'll probably try finding somebody to buy a max level one from, but eh
---
Some folks just like testing stuff for themselves so it could be as simple as that. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I‚Äôd question why you‚Äôd not want to play bloodied if you‚Äôre staying at low health for long enough periods that unyielding would matter to you 
---
But it‚Äôs your game lol
---
Don‚Äôt let anyone tell you how you can and can‚Äôt have fun
---
Sweet. I normally pay good money for that.
---
Well fudge. I give up T_T 
---
Spent all day, running into multiple different animals and creatures with no other around (thus, seems rather safe to conclude a solitary, random spawn)... and at no point have I been given the option to Tame. 
---
I've been able to pacify all manner of things, and succeeded in pretty much every instance. From a lvl 65 Scorchbeast to a legendary Bloatfly, to a Scorched Frog (which I really wanted cuz that bright blue glow with lightning shooting out is cool), but... that level 1 Yearling Radstag was the final nail in the coffin for me. I'm accepting defeat :(
---
You probably won‚Äôt get the full benefit but it‚Äôll be fine.
---
Haha lets get this party started then, I‚Äôll see you at the speak easy (; 
---
If I apply that charged lobbed barrel on an explosive tesla do the spheres explode?  Is that better then the other setup?
---
Finding the right plans helps, which is mercifully a lot easier than it used to be. I admit that my camp designs are uninspired, but I check out other people's camps to get ideas. I just saw a really neat one that used slanted roof pieces to make what looked like stadium bleachers. Granted, the place was right next to Charleston Station and borked the rare spawn point, but still.
---
The Contractor perk also makes base building less resource-intensive.
---
There are some ways of getting around them too. You can use PA frames to glitch through a lot of walls, and in some places like the locked compound in harper's ferry you can just jump over the fence. If you are just logging in and the world is still loading in, you can sometimes walk through objects that are supposed to be solid on the game's end. If all else fails, if somebody else opens a door or container, it will remain unlocked in your world for a while. The only things that can't be cheesed are the laser barriers and hand scanners, but those only require a quest item and not a perk
---
I also had some strange problems with things loading in extremely late at the bunker service entrance today
---
In Fallout 4 I killed an NPC before I was supposed to. Even though he was dead, he followed me around no matter where I went, just constantly attacking me out of the blue, for the rest of the time I was playing the game. He would just materialize out of thin air and start attacking me. I think the insult bot should be similar. That way you can't just server hop or fast travel to get rid of it. 
---
I have an instigating barbed harpoon gun. It's so much fun. Same with an instigating multi-shot broadsider.
---
I usually craft whatever I can, bulk my junk and scrap non-legendary armor and weapons (unless I‚Äôm using it of course) and sort your inventory by weight, determine what you don‚Äôt need and either drop or sell it. For example if you don‚Äôt use a certain type of ammo then there‚Äôs no need to carry it. Inventory management is a damn mini game in itself...lol 
---
Gamer tag as well lol 
---
Sidenote: what I mean by active is chance for strangers to pass by your home. You'd be surprised how many times people have stumbled onto my camp since it's hard to miss. And so far I've only had one scenario of a douchebag wanting to destroy the camp, and luckily it was another version of it, surely a big while ago where people found it cool to ruin camps that so much as were built in a 300 meter radius around the golf course.
---
It's hard to assume someone would build a camp in Whitesprings for any reason rather than the boring xp or legendary grind.
---
Other than that though, a pleasant experience with strangers overall, so many neighbors I've shown it to and strangers I've cooked for in it during the time it's been around!
---
When you say, "non-bloodied" build,  do you mean just not using a bloodied weapon? 
---
Crits ignore dr/er. The best PA build is emergency protocols. 1 crit and you're dead as you have to sit at low life. 
---
You're way better off using sentinel gear and focusing on max HP. % damage reduction perks/gear and max HP. 
---
I've got 450 health with just pumpkin pie buff. 
---
Im on xbox btw
---
And don‚Äôt sell post war items 
---
That is why agriculture came after the nuclear reactor in history.....   ;-)
---
I imagine they will add more, but didn‚Äôt want to overload the options right at launch.
---
There are some great ideas in the thread about different types of DLCs that could be considered
---
The duplicates shouldn't be disappearing unless you have every possible perk combination. For example, dupes of one-level cards (lockpick) can disappear, but if you open up two gunsmith perks, they should stack up until you have a rank 1, rank 2, rank 3, rank 4, and rank 5 in your inv
---
My nuke my choice! My nuke my choice! Haha 
---
I love it! Good use of neon letters on the big price sign, I've never seen that before. Please tell me I can get fasnacht donuts at the Tim Horton's!
---
Yeah I guess I will have to learn that the hard way
---
If you're event hopping you're likely to see a person or two. The selling vendor/in world static stash boxes also tend to draw people in. Nuke zones at whitesprings is another common congregation site.
---
Otherwise it is areas that are mandatory parts of a quest string that tend to get the most foot traffic which is why it's not uncommon to find more than a couple people hitting up flatwoods.
---
That leaves a significant area otherwise exposed for exploration and it is fairly uncommon to find random passerbys. With a limit of 24, max party size of 4 and a large map ... it is what it is. On a busy night with 3 full parties of 4, that's essentially half the server. 
---
ü§ôüèª
---
But the feeing you get when you‚Äôve cleared your stash is a good one. Since spring is here consider it some ‚Äúspring cleaning‚Äù lol
---
I think they heard ya. Minor run on Whitesprings before dinner tonight and I netted a total of 8 legendary weapons and 4 armors. To include a Tesla, Gauss, AAE combat rifle, and some mele. Also the armor was way better with two assassin's and one sentinel piece. 
---
When just about to light the bonfire at the Fasnacht event.  My team joked that someone was about to get a rare mask and the Bethesda gods said NOPE, but on the inside we cry to this very day... üòõ
---
Yeah thats a good idea
---
I'd like it if I could sort my perks, so I could do quicker swaps and place useless duplicates at the end of the list. I'd also like it if you could scrap cards, for each point you have in it you can respec your special stats that many times.
---
no problem!
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been hearing stuff like this since Patch 5. Been scrapping ever since 
---
Yeah I encountered this problem when I first started building in 76, coming from fo4 this took some getting used to. Best thing to do now is to try and not make that same mistake going forward. 
---
Just keep in mind there‚Äôs a certain order on which to build/delete/store objects. Usually it‚Äôs from top to bottom in terms of storing and deleting. Like don‚Äôt delete a wall of you have a half wall or roof above it, start with the roof and work your way down. 
---
Why go to the trouble of making a whole quest around becoming immune to the scorched virus if you were immune to begin with and it affects absolutely nothing in the game?
---
I want pretty much everything the creation club in FO4 had in the Nuka Caf√©. Outfits, furniture, and decorations.
---
As others have mentioned, it depends greatly on where you choose to adventure. I also suggest that it also depends on when you play. I'm a crazy early riser and a bit of a hermit myself, and I bump into another player maybe every couple days.
---
When I do though, things are always cordial. I've never had anyone try to kill me, and I've met some really nice folx just doing their part to rebuild Appalachia.
---
Since my character is only level 2, I was thinking of nuking whitesprings  or something 
---
I have a vats pistol build and even I still aim down sights while recharging action points. In PVP you often need to ADS crouched targets. Ignoring vats completely is limiting your damage.
---
For some reason I was thinking you meant some actual mechanic, maybe for dwemer.
---
Forget snapping, I want Place Everywhere in FO76. Haha!
---
But yea, FO4 has some great core architectural pieces that would be amazing in this game. 
---

I was doing the teapot event and the insult bot came to talk to me. As I was running around defending the tanks the insult bot would follow me around saying ‚Äúwait a moment‚Äù and things like ‚Äúcan I talk to you‚Äù or something along those lines. I straight ignored his ass, it was quite funny. 
---
The bot kept walking in circles trying to have a word lol once he‚Äôd make it to me I‚Äôd run to the other tank and he would penguin walk on 
---
Always appreciate the more elaborate camp builds where one makes clever use of the environment and mixes it along with their camp structures. I've also been through it, it's a big pain to setup but oh so worth it in the end!
---
It definitely gives you the option to either see people or not. If you really want to interact with people, play survivor mode where you are guaranteed to meet people if you survive long enough.

That's not shit, it's fermenter juice.

I found the vendor bot yesterday, but some jerk sniped him before I could see what he had available.
---
Make it like a wanted system. The only way yo get rid of him us yo pay him off or pay to put him on someone else. 
---
No he is right its straight up trash im a level 142 and i just get one hit in power armor to chameleon armor invis tards from roofs and shit its lame as hell
---
I ran through with some people Sunday night and they cleared the silos in like 10min. I couldn't keep up. Definitely way different than when I did it alone lol. 
---
Calibrated shocks I find is far more rare than the jetpack. After getting a jetpack,  I've come across them two more times. (I'd offer it to you if I hadn't already given them away) Still haven't come cross the calibrated shocks. A friend bought them off the trade subreddit for 1000 caps each on xbox.

yep :(

Brutal, this spot is always quiet and have never once seen a camp set up to block the spawn

Dude update: just helped him set up his first character. He INSISTED that he make him Dr. Phil...ü§®. So I let him and he thinks it‚Äôs the funniest thing ever. Whatever makes him happy! Lmao

I just keep killing the darn thing, because it breaks my sneak. Along with the prize bot, 1lb away of being overencumbered and unable to fast travel, this thing pops out of nowhere and adds 200 prewar money to my inventory. Super sledge to that obnoxious big head of it is what it got.
---
And bring back the children of light decorations
---
Now if only we could get some shotgun variety...
---
It doesnt reduce it no. Only reason I dont run speed demon.
---
Might mean no adrenal reaction, radicool, and nerd rage 
---
I don't disagree but they've made a decision.  Personally I would have been happy with the old fallout 3 system of limited total # of perks that you permanently select and that's it.  
---
But as they did not go that route, arguing against perk swaps imo is sort of a moot point.  
---
Players can already swap perks at will.  Making it easier to do so doesn't somehow open up new builds that otherwise wouldn't exist.  It doesn't change what one individual character can and cannot do.  All perk swapping, loadouts, or making some perks passive does is reduce the amount of time you spend looking at menus and increase the amount of time you are actually playing the game.  
---
You are still limited by SPECIAL and can't make a true "master of everything" like you can in say, fo4 with it's unlimited levels and no restrictions on the number of perks or special points you can take.  You can't for example just switch on the fly from a melee build to a rifle build, as the one requires STR and the other PER and no amount of perk load outs or easy swap options will change that.
---
he just gave me generic ‚Äústep aside‚Äù type lines. no insults

he jumped me in the middle of nowhere one time and i audibly screamed super loud

It was looking at me funny, but who's the big badass now?!?

Oh yea big time

He said suck a fast outta my ass? This guys FUCKED 
---
But past level 50, every level gives only perks. What is taking 50 levels away then? If you past level 100, substraction of a number from total level just allow to levelup even faster - there is no challenge in that deal. And just removing 50 random perk cards with it not that trivial considering card upgrades and glides.

Pipe weapons can be incredibly powerful with the right perks, don't be afraid to abandon a build if you find a better weapon type. Also the main quests have great rewards and plans, but doing them too soon gives you crappy legendaries. Wait till like 20+ to really delve into pure missions

Oh good at least its not just me. Was a little worried BUT WOULD ALSO LIKE TO PLAY THE DAMN GAME XD

Wish he sold 3* Legendaries when he spawns like that.
