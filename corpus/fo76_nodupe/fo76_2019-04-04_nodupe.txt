That's super cool!

---
---
Per /u/wolflarsen55 and /u/Shankwell 's "grievances", signage adjustments [have been made](https://imgur.com/xrmSFtp).
---
Lmao I thought I was the only one that knew this 
---
Also let us change the characters name. If ESO can let us display character names idk why FO76 can't.
---
\#6 already exists you can 'repair all' by repairing the camp machine
---
Wear the veil
---
And the stone for added perks 
---
No. 6 is already in the game.
---
Lol me too! Great minds think alike ;)
---
Or just give us all the mods because scrap to learn is a shitty system. My literal 6 year old even said "that doesn't make any sense" after I explained it 
---
No
---
His name was Gary Paulson
---
Dude. There's an acid node ***RIGHT THERE***. This is the exact same spot where I built my current camp, and you have no idea how much of a letdown it is each time I spawn into a world where my spot is taken and the current occupants did not build an acid extractor. 
---

---
That node is the primary reason I plunked my camp down where I did. Acid is the most valuable resource in the game because it allows you to make metric fucktons of lead, steel, and gunpowder. 
---
Please consider expanding to where that node is, you'll thank us later. It's super worth it.
---
If people are looking the flatwoods monster is a random spawn. BUT  I have found an area in the last week that 5 out of 8 times he's been there.  Go to twin lakes and head east from the spawn point  there is an area that looks like it was part of the lake that's dried up there is a rock formations that's 3 levels high that he spawns behinds. I would post pix but am on mobile atm
---
Oh, this is great news, thanks! Time to switch to my high luck shotgun toon for a play session or two.
---
Take a look at my place. GT Pa3ndr4g0n. 
---
Just do events all events pay out some stimpaks and purified water at the end 
---
It's pretty well been announced that damage to camp will be affected by pacifist soon. So you won't have to worry much longer. Sorry about your story. It'll be better soon. 
---
But it's not immature, it's a fucking feature of the game. It's not gone forever. Take 15 minutes, farm the mats, and repair it. It's a goddamn wasteland, not a daycare. 
---
Have u tried fallout 4? Its single player! 
---
I was farming yesterday too at the golf course and before i knew about it I would get attacked by invisible ghouls 
---
Can't if you never get the card from a pack. Like i said, still missing 3 or 4 cards i just get duplicates when opening the card packs
---
I'll check that. Thanks
---
I'm kinda glad they don't show the names, because my 10 year old created my alt and he's called "Epic gamer MLG FORTNITE PRO"...
---
So is it safe to say you got massive wood?
---
Bit at that level you can pick whatever card you want when leveling up, the packs are just extra.
---
I once launched the grafton monster clear over the power plant.......a fatman may have been involved.
---
Thanks. Me either. I think the quest is glitched. Hopefully Bethesda fixes it.
---
There are always 2 or 3 of them at Toxic Larry's Meat and Go
---
wow nice tip!
---
You could have just leave and join another server 
---
What is a user name? ESO let's you display a character name.
---
My mistake. 
---
Im gonna sell low. So many ways to get caps. Why get greedy?
---
I Second this goal 
---
Yes!
---
But you know whats worse..... Super mutants sniping your base from long distances smh... Bethesda fix this shits, mad annoying üò°
---
I've already responded to someone saying this! I'm in no real need of acid, and I'm not a heavy gunner, nor do I use a lot of ammo. I usually end up with far too much acid, and I sell it on to vendors or other players.
---
I chose this spot because I liked the look of it, not because of the node. I'd feel bad if camps were permanent fixtures in the world, and I'd move it elsewhere to free up the node for others to use it if that were the case... but nobody is losing anything from my camp being here without that node being used if I'm spawning into a server where the spot is free, and if I'm spawning into one where it's occupied, my camp doesn't get placed anyway.
---
I appreciate the comment, but the use (or lack thereof) of an acid node wasn't exactly why I posted this. I was hoping people would enjoy my build, not criticise me for failing to utilise a resource that I am in little need of. I apologise for not using it, but I can't move my CAMP without having to rebuild everything from the ground up. It's simply not possible to blueprint my build.
---
Sorry, don't need one.  But when I was lvl 7 someone left a chasis standing at the overseer's campsite.  Having played nothing by light armor, forever, I was dumfounded....walked arounded it..then tried to get into it.  That must have been interesting to watch!  Made my day.  Good times
---
Rumbly
---
No. Wait til April 9th. Right now it‚Äôs the same thing besides the brewing event. Survival needs a lot of work in balance and still in Beta.
---
Make sure you do them in order. I skipped around, and can't finish that one either...
---
:/
---
I never realized #7, thanks
---
No trick. Most people that have 100k+ caps are from when they or their friends were duping and selling. Not just weapons and armor but I know a huge money maker was selling duped serums. Notice I didn‚Äôt say all people got rich this way. I‚Äôm sure there are some people that have been grinding cap stash runs for months but they are the minority for sure. 
---
i have an overabundance of stims and chems. will sell cheap. gamertag sloppyfuture xbox
---
....as soon as it gets here...
---
And after the God awful humungous patches.
---
THEN you'll be ready.
---
Apart from that, welcome to the madness, mind the scorchbeast guano. üëç
---
"You're listening to me; Two-Dog!! Woof woof..."
---
I think this is way over priced. Even with player vendors. I'll will still sell stims at 5c per stim. I make about 2k a day currently on stimpack sales alone. Most sell em at 10c but can't meet me then like I do due to price.
---
1. Verify you video and sound drivers are current.
---
2. Question - is fallout the only issue?
---
3. Verify you do NOT have Windows update running in the background and that the windows store is disabled (troubleshooting only).
---
Have seen errors like this before. And it's usually from Microsoft useing their drivers and not the manufacturers drivers. Hence why I say to disable the update and windows store to test. It's can also be an error in your sound codex (if you happen to have iTunes installed.
---
Hope this helps
---
&gt;Personally, I just don't get it.
---
That's apparent. 
---
Come check out my house boat GT- Soviet420 
---
Well yeah but that's true of almost any game these days.
---
And thanks, can't wait.
---
Ok that will help. There always seem to be some quest completion bugs in Bethesda games, so for non essential quests I would be happy to just clear them.
---
This Wendingo thing has been like Preston Garvey handing out settlement quests.
---
I think it will work like the Brew stations and be stash based.
---
&gt;launched it into oblivion
---
You hit it so hard it ended up in a different Bethesda game?
---
Man, you missed out on the best place ever. That fasnacht parade had bees nests that respawned every event. You could collect about 30+ beeswax every time, which broke into 2 acid each. Try helvetia, to see if there are any nests left
---
I sell them 5c per stim.
---
I guess I'll just keep at it. Two 76 things I'd like to check off my list is the last Unruly Golfer and finding the BOS Combat Armor leg plans that's been MIA for months.
---
*playing skyrim * what‚Äôs the mat massive crab!
---
No more wood Legendaries.  Get rid of them.
---
What I like to do is go into someone's loot bag and donate all the stuff I don't want to carry :) 
---
Idk why people are giving you such a hard time here, you have every right to be bummed about this. I really also don‚Äôt see why the whole ‚Äúraider‚Äù thing needs to be done on random players. It‚Äôs one thing if you want to play around with your friends, but to sabotage someone else‚Äôs good time and enjoyment of the game by destroying camps or griefing is just pushing it too far. Luckily the update will cure this camp issue, but I‚Äôve heard so many stories of people meticulously planning their camps just to watch it get destroyed. 
---
Yes you can rebuild, and yes, this is a multiplayer game, but if someone has opted out of PVP there‚Äôs no reason to continue and attack them/destroy their camps. I‚Äôve never heard one person say ‚Äúthe coolest thing happened today, some random people came and destroyed my camp like raiders! It was super authentic and I enjoyed it‚Äù everyone is always upset/annoyed. 
---
Capture Hemlock Holes and farm enemies that drop acid.  
---
When you are just starting, scrap everything you find. And scrap it before you store it. 
---
Never pass up the opportunity to collect food and water. Some days I feel all I do is eat and drink
---
Dont hang on to weapons or armor you cant use yet. Trust me there will be lots more
---
If you see a high lvl player (100+) and hes running towards you, weapon holstered and waving....hes more than likely not going to kill you but give you a bunch of goodies. 
---
But most importantly: Have fun, dont be "that guy" and you would be surprised the amount of helpful people in and around Appalachia 
---
Good idea! Just need 400 a day 200 before work and 200 after. I make 40k 5.56 weekly for sale
---
[https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/)  good to check in on the blog every now and then :)
---
I honestly see where your coming from and in you individual situation I'm sure it wasn't a nice experiance for your daughter...however FO76 is designed to allow you as much free will as is possible without the game being unplayable. 
---
Life is not always easy and fun and FO76 attempts to recreate that in a small way. 
---
The comment about FO4 is a good suggestion, If your daughter enjoys the camp building aspect then do it on FO4, you can build truly massive settlements with no risk of it being destroyed by anyone else. 
---
 Try not to let things like this get you down. 
---
Nah give me Graham as the radio dj.
---
I don't participate because 1) it's full of people who have been hoarding the best duped pvp gear for ages who would completely dominate me, and 2) I can lose all my hard earned caps when those guys kill me.
---
The penalty is simply too severe to bother giving it a chance for +20% xp.
---
How many drills though?
---
This and taking workshops 
---
PLEASE! Who actually uses Wood armor?
---
I had the same thing happen. 2 guys near lever 300 followed me from server to server just to destroy my camp. I had pacifist on and my camp was not protected like it was supposed to be. Sad that people get enjoyment out of a game by taking the enjoyment out of the game for other people.
---
Bring back Blackbird
---
I just build tower bases to orevent spawning inside my house.
---
The problem is it shouldn‚Äôt be released in this state, and just because they fix it later doesn‚Äôt change the shitty thing they did in the first place. I can‚Äôt imagine it will be the last time Bethesda release a buggy mess of a game. And I‚Äôm saying this as someone who does generally enjoy Bethesda games and Fallout 76 in particular. 
---
Yeah I have noticed a lot of people on this sub seem helpful. Then again only been on here a day or two.
---
Spend some time on YouTube. Avoid beginner guides over 2 months old. There are some newcomers on YT putting out some very good content. 
---
InnovSurvivalist
---
RifleGaming
---
Captain Noob (not a beginner guide, but very entertaining weapon reviewer) 
---
BadCompanySarge
---
Wasteland Dovahkiin
---
Miz Tracey
---
I recommend all the above. 
---
Plus, obviously the FO76 subreddit. It‚Äôs an open world Game. You enjoy it however you like. 
---
I was Level 178 before I even launched a nuke. Now I‚Äôm level 219 and still haven‚Äôt discovered at least 1/4 of the map. 
---
Don‚Äôt watch or listen to the haters. Play it yourself and develop your own opinion. 
---
Good deeds*
---
Not... Deads. Lol
---
You‚Äôre a saint. I heard someone sell a bomber jacket to some kid during the parade for 750 caps. 
---
Aside from grinding, you can just server hop. This saved the game for me because all my weapons/supplies were breaking/running out trying to fight level 60s at level 20. Quit to main menu and rejoin until the area you want to go is empty and you can spawn enemies your level. 
---
After doing this when I re-started the game last month, I'm level 35 and at the end of the main quest, when I couldn't even make it to Top of the World back when I first played when the game came out. I even managed to have Whitespring empty one time and spawn level 15 enemies!
---
In my experience random team invites are people trying to  get to the area you're in by using you to fast travel. I wouldn't really worry about it unless you're in your camp
---
Platform?
---
As far as the gaming goes, take a little time to enjoy the beginning stages. If you've  done any of the  later Fallout games, it'll feel similar. Be good, or be bad. Be silent, or get the loudest guns you can find. Make the game fun for yourself. Most, but not all of the other gamers on might see a lone fresh out of the vault wanderer, and come and drop some supplies. If someone comes up to you and gives you a thumbs up, be kind and return it. They might step back, look at the ground or flash their lights, they probably dropped a paper bag with stuff for you.  Enjoy!
---
I feel like that could get ridiculous pretty quick.
---
I also love the game, happy that it exists and looking forward to the next hundred hours I put into it. :)
---
Oh fuck I‚Äôve been missing out on so many caps doing the same thing LMFAO
---
I'm enjoying the game, but I still know they pushed out a shitty product, and I'm sick of posts like this. 
---
No Man's Sky was a mess and it deserved every bit of hate it got. But Bethesda are a major company and they don't deserve the pass.
---
They fucked their fans over big time.
---
Yes I'm enjoying the game for what it is, but it's still a lazy, buggy game.
---
It still looks like a 2000 era game with its junk engine. They still expect fans to be happy that they have atom sales for their overpriced shit.
---
So thanks Bethesda. Thanks for trying to patch the mess you gave us. 
---
Yours
---
A guy that bought it from a dodgy store for 10% of what you are charging.
---
Hi ! glad I found this! username Sipsissimus. (pc) RTX 2080Ti , i9 9900k , 32GB ddr4@3866, everything's on M.2 hard drives. max settings 1080p 180hrz , outdoors 100 - 200 frames+, indoors 300- 400+ frames. 
---
So since I built this PC last week, I just noticed that when my frames hit 300+ my AWSD does not respond. Navigating the pip boy works fine+ menu and map, its just the input for the movement of the character that doesn't work when the frames surpass 300. Every time and without fail. please help me , the game's nearly unplayable now because of this. thank you!
---
nice. calm before the chaos.
---
So long as your mirelurk is called Dave.
---
They have the option to switch display names in ESO (gamertag-character name) so it's not like they don't know how.
---
Subjecting your child, special needs, to FO76? The game is rated Mature 17+.
---
Either you are a troll or perhaps we should report you to Child Protective Services.
---
I got a right leather arm 1 unyielding, sentinels, 1 str I can sell if you're interested 
---
,
---
This is a great idea!  I'll probably do the same and make the lowest level hard to get weapons available cheap for newer players.  If you can make multiple machines then there will be a legendary machine and a low-level machine.
---
I keep em. No max Carry for them no weight and worth 1c. 
---
F
---
I watched it and I still don't believe it. Lol I try to build a simple structure and it tells me the object is floating this guy has floating objects and it's okay. 
---
i want one with fast reload
---
Fireproof perk in Endurance helps tremendously with this. Rank 3 gives 45% fire resistance 
---
Mirelurk wants to Power Fist you.
---
How much would you want? I only use Combat and I'm not interested in Sentinel's, but I'll consider for a reasonable price.
---
I bet you've played a video game rated over 17 at an age that doesn't exceed the digits 17.
---
Get a dense chest mod it will change your life
---
Thanks for verifying. That just reinforces the question though as to why nobody is pushing for a fix. :\\
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
No, especially when Zenimax released ESO in a similar state. I bet Starfield Online 20 years from now has the same problems: A buggy mess that's a different genre than the original game it's based on and that skimps on features that were always in the single player game.
---
But hey, ESO just had its 5 year anniversary, I bet F76 will be the same. They fix it as time goes on, we shouldn't get used to it but this is the way it is with the "games as a service" model.
---
Here's hoping for the other projects but tbh I can't wait for NMS VR
---
Pro-Tip:  No one can find you if you don't say what your username and platform are :-)

wow that is a trash Legendary my god bethesda please up the curated rolls to better effects.
---
the 44 is a bad gun to begin with :) sorry had to say something as this is not a good weapon to grind a challenge for...
---
I‚Äôd rather keep them at that price haha. 
---
No F for whoever got cheap unyielding marine at the Sutton Station bot. Fuck!! hahaha
---
Yeah, New Vegas is a nice game too
---
It‚Äôs been saying this for 2 month so no that‚Äôs not it 
---
This sub really isnt for these kinds if posts tbh
---
I was wandering in the cranberry bog, in the abandoned house south of the Glassed Cavern. Killed a couple bad guys and was looting the house and who should I hear behind me?  Effing Insult Bot!  Dude!  Deep in the depths of the Cranberry Bog is no place for an insult Bot!  Dude needs a radio job to keep him out of trouble. 
---
One BILLION upvotes
---
[removed]
---
Sorry people are giving you such a hard time. I think thought that it is an awesome build! I‚Äôm a big fan of prioritizing the look of a location over the benefits like extracting. Hope you feel better.
---
Totally agree with you, every word.  Our names are pretty much just a way to tell multiple characters apart.  (Eh hem.. Bethesda.. power armor naming please) its practical.  In game, there needs to be be a way to identify the actual players to discourage bad behavior, keep people accountable. If anything, keep the gamertag and add the character name.
---
That totally sucks. People can be terrible. I hope the update for pacifist CAMP comes out soon so those scum can't randomly destroy non hostile camps. 
---
Ahh oh if you just use combat im gonna hang on to it a while longer,  thanks and gl
---
I spend a little time on the map screen seeing what it goes close to and fast traveling there to intercept. But also have been extremely lucky to go to Watoga to sell bulk, only to find the trio of vertibirds and a cargo bot being shot at by all the other bots in the area
---
Ussually if I die during sbq I can't find the bag
---
Two-Shot, Explosive, Fast Reload is the main goal lol
---
That's fine. I'll keep making caps.
---
^this
---
I'll pay 2k
---
Just have Three Dog's ancestor (voiced by Three Dog) on the original GNR radio network playing original fallout 3 and FONV tunes.  Just say it's a satellite feed from someplace else in the country (not necessarily D.C.).  Then you could have your cake and eat it too.  I miss tuning in to the radio to hear of events being commented on in-world.
---
ladydev replied to me about a month or ago or so after i posted about this too.
---
not the buff but the turret camps at whitesprings.
---
So she said that they are working on adding areas of non building in and they did in certain areas of Appalachia there is places you cant put camp but previously could.
---
but they still havent blocked whitesprings i asked about this and hadn't heard a response as of yet.
---
That sucks. I‚Äôm sorry your kid had to go through that. I sometimes let my five years old help me decide how to build my camp but I log off if someone starts messing with me or something ‚Äúscary‚Äù happens. 
---
Yeah it's a pretty detailed set of events to get those up.
---
I mean you‚Äôd have to sell 100 stimpacks just to make 500 caps which is nothing. Consider the value of 100 stimpacks vs 500 caps
---
Look up fallout 76 roadmap. We are well into it.
---
So A new spreading explosive disease!?
---
Well, that was unexpectedly effective, thanks.
---
Legendary robots have always exploded.

Right?  I can't put a damn 4x4 blueprint down to save my life and this dude's like "GIANT TESLA ARC!"

The Mirelurk can be seen just above the top of the flag pole.

Dude mr gutsy and protections exploded on me at mama dolces I was pretty peeved
---
As a person who bought it new for full price and got their money's worth from the BETA onwards. I can see you definitely got it late and cheap. And had your opinions affected by the original backlash, if you think this game is 2000s era, I'm definitely sure you weren't alive in the 2000s.
---
Miss the buttressed raider arms
---
i would def buy that
---
I have been noticing a increase in houses near overseers camp next to the bridge lately. You can net the newbies as some buyers and it's always a highly trafficked area.
---
I've sold 500 in the last hour. I got an order for 2500. With chemists and super duper it's not hard. Stack blood packs they weight .03 with the card then grind some steel. It's cake. As John Conner would say " easy money"
---
If people would buy them at 10c I'd sell them at that. But check the markets people try and are unable to find a buyer.
---
How do you have the materials to make 500 stimpacks an hour? Even WITH the perks?
---
Welcome to the Wasteland!     
---
Once you get on there are quite a few actual nice people in the waste lands that would craft you Deep Pocket armor. At level 1-20 and even higher it can save you a lot of grief running overweight!   
---
I nice pipe rifle or hunting rifle modded and upgraded is golden.   
---
Guides and maps are all over but I would strongly suggest following the Overseers Missions and markers and going from there.   
---
Scrap and scrap more! Everything! Make note of where benches are and type.   
---
Tinkers bench you can Bulk items up so it will reduce the weight in your stash.   
---
Other than grenades, don't bother saving mini-nukes or missiles until at last after LvL 15, just a lot of weight.   
---
Start thinking about type of character build you want, there is a lot of great info here to browse through!   
---
Given the fact that I tend to just...flat out _drop_ mats into various bins around the map anyway? No profit loss at all. I'm not planning on buying materials, this crap just flows to you as you play the game anyway. 
---
Perhaps give us a dialogue that when we completely learn all the mods it says " I think I learned all I can about this weapon/armor etc"  or have ??? In the modifications menu to show that you still haven't learned all the mods left. Just some indication of our progress would be nice.
---
My usual go to is a sniper, though I am toying with building a big ol melee brute.
---
All enemies have this insane ability to detect your camp from a mile away yet our turrets can‚Äôt even detect something that‚Äôs chewing on its gun barrel.
---
Anticheat to stop you from pressing Q? Maybe they should start by making skill based combat in the first place.
---
Well you use the terminal at whitesprings to locate the bot. Destroy the guardbot things then use vats to destroy the vote motor or flight control and it‚Äôll hover in place
---
Nice work! 
---
If you play on ps4, I will gladly replace your stolen junk. I have 3 characters with full stashes and I couldn't ever use it all.
---
I'll give it a shot. Thanks
---
Bloody Mess perk. Makes creatures go boom.  
---
Farming ticks with buchers bounty. Go from the moodshiners shack near 76 there's 3-4. Then the lumber yard (Gilman) there is 5-7) stack tick blood till im over weight then scrap sacs and make blood packs.
---
For the steel I just go to Grafton kill the mutants and scrap all their weapons. That's about 200 steel right there.
---
&gt;Bethesda please please let us display our freaking character name and not the account. This totally hurts Roleplayers in the worst way in a game you want to be about roleplaying
---
personally i think checking names would be dumb it would also be funny to see a ton of folks known IG by something stu\[id
---
Do you even know what ini file is? Any decent game has those. And you can not mod the game right now outside of interface and retextures. Cheats have nothing to do with what you mentioned.
---
It‚Äôs absolutely stupid! These ‚Äúraiders‚Äù aren‚Äôt raiders. They use flame throwers guass rifles and x-o1, or ultracite powerarmor. If you want to be a raider wear raider power armor or raider gear! It‚Äôs so dumb that they call them self‚Äôs raiders when their just griefers. I can‚Äôt help now but soon they are making adventure mode camps invincible so you won‚Äôt face this problem again. For now I just have my camp set up with a bunch of high level turrets inside and outside.
---
Ok I‚Äôm screen shotting this. I didn‚Äôt know it was this easy. I thought you were just collecting them from containers 
---
For those that did the BOS quest or at least part of it, someone could make you a Level 1, 5, 10 and up BOS rifle which is excellent!
---
The link is broken.
---
I think you‚Äôre the troll here. 
---
I just shot her in the face.
---
That would be awesome, though I am hoping not to be given too much awesome stuff :p
---
Yes! This happened to me today! That specific area is one of only 3 that are well known as a non-regular single NPC spawn location for getting tameable pets. The story was QUITE long, but entertaining nonetheless. 
---
I must have landed there 40 times. Got her only once. 
---
Got a mirelurk King there as a pet. But ended up killing him due to too many positional glitches. 
---
Actively seeking another. 
---
If they followed you from sever to server, that is harassment and a bannable offense. I suggest you report them.
---
Creatures don‚Äôt have explosive automatic weapons that‚Äôll level a CAMP in seconds...
---
" I just dont see how it's possible to filter bad words or hateful words from the naming process."
---
Almost every MMORPG has a filter that prevents this exact thing.
---
Do you actually think anybody needs help in this game? Where death is nothing be a refill of health? You are just taking away new players' experience. What are they supposed to do when they already have all the gear?
---
I won‚Äôt be on for the rest of the night but I will be on tomorrow hopefully
---
VATS wasn‚Äôt working.  When VATS locked on it moved faster so I was no longer locked on. 
---
Managed to finish it only to have the next step direct me to Mama Dulce‚Äôs to find a code that is not there.
---
Feed the people keeps triggering which is infuriating. 
---
I won‚Äôt be on later but maybe will be on tomorrow
---
Sentrybots and some Assaultrons and Protectrons have always exploded after being killed (I'm talking about FO3, NV and 4) so it's not a bug. There's a perks card to make soft targets go splat.
---
 If you have scorched exploding like a mini nuke then that's news.
---
No problem. And totally understand the reason why not to place
---
Once you complete the first part of the BOS quest (even lower level  like 10) you can get access to the plan AFTER getting a military ID and going to the basic course. 
---
You won't be able to complete it all at low levels but you can do some of it. Here is a guide walk through:

I keep hearing ‚Äúthere are no NPCs‚Äù but how is that at all accurate? There are PLENTY of NPCs in the game just like any other MMO, just not one that was designed by Bethesda‚Äôs artists as humanoid in its skin and textures. I don‚Äôt mind robot NPCs especially when it fits in with the lore. 
---
Bolton Greens is a good source for plastic. Between the pool balls on the pool table and the life preservers near the swimming pool, you can snag quite a lot in just two rooms or so.
---
You already have a chat.
---
Beer bottles are already exempt from scrap all, I think this was their plan originally. They need to protect other crafting ingredients the same way.
---
There's one in Berkley I think, that gives you pointless, but sometimes a little dangerous, tasks to do. There's a terminal, possibly in Berkley too, that contains a complaint the customer's Miss Nanny is avoiding doing any child minding duties by sending the kids off to get flowers or such from neighbouring districts. Funny stuff.
---
Thanks
---
Sigh, I know that Im not an idiot. I was being sarcastic.
---
Literally, everything from games to websites has a fucking filter for cuss words and hate speech.
---
I even added that /s thing meant to denote sarcasm and I *just* explain that I was being sarcastic to someone else.
---
Came here to say that. Just a tick above playable now. Fun; but limited. I hope you‚Äôre right! 
---
Are the quest rewards worth it?
---
I‚Äôve been putting off doing that one until the bug is fixed, but maybe I should be treating it is repeatable while I can!
---
Idk of this has been mentioned before but if anyone‚Äôs messing w me I just quit the game and load up again only takes a few minutes and you don‚Äôt loose any junk and your house will stay the same. Also works if a scorched beast attacks.
---
Lol that‚Äôs pretty smart
---
Dont build on that lake, building near that area stops a random event from occuring, namely the legendary vendor - he sells rare outfits.
---
" and for some reason I thought they had eliminated the ability for people to wreck your base so it was pretty safe "
---
  
---
This is where you screwed up

Sorry the worst of humanity had to visit you and your child trying to have fun.  Patch 8 will make sure that your child won't get bullied that way again.  BSG won't do much to protect your child from asshats in this world (this isn't the SIMS), but this one step in the right direction to make the griefing innocents less traumatic an experience for the victim.
---
I tend to find myself not interacting with people on-server because of the tricky methods to murder and steal used by the dregs of humanity in the game.  Friending someone then trashing their CAMP is one example.  Once Patch 8 goes live I'll definitely re-do my base to be more open (I keep expensive to repair stuff behind a locked door hidden away). 
---
Are there any resources or caps you need to make things right?  I'll glady donate anything you need that I can supply to make things better for you and your daughter.
---
The medic's legendary effect is considerably better on an automatic weapon.
---
This should really have +50% VATS Crit instead of +33% vats chance.
---
Thank you, and I'm glad that others feel the same way. I just want a cute house, and if I need resources, there's a whole maps-worth out there to go farm! And I hope so too. I've had a really tough few days, is all. I don't think it's going to get any easier any time soon, but... over-sharing aside, I really appreciate your kindness.
---
I am sorry that your little angel was upset truly I am. But this is an online game meant for adults maybe you should not have left her alone to play a game that she couldn't fully understand the actions of every person or there motives. I'm not attacking you or her and I fully support you and her trying abs playing games together and even online games and even fallout 76 but she should be supervised.  
---
No problem :) 
---
If it happens again I will.
---
She told me the story of Hanzel and Gretel.
---
I had one tell me Goldilocks and the Three Bears.  Then she gave me some juice.
---
I've heard this story quite a few times, low level attacks you and a higher is waiting for you to attack them and then boom, you're done. Happens a lot! 
---
Nah I do farm those too but for other drugs and super stims. I never make those but sell em for 10c. I mean it's pure profit so I don't mind losing the 5c by not selling at 15c which is market rate. A team could really make alot because all you'd need is 4 people with Tesla coils on PA or plauge walker. They all are able to tag the ticks with out killing them. That's 4x the product. 
---
F2P games doesnt require subscription, yoo should try warframe, and, not sure if it is on the PS store... path of exile
---
I want an explanation of where there are 5 diamonds  for legendary weapons but only 3 diamond weapons. I did see that if you added say a scorched killer receiver to a 3 star rifle it adds a star. But 5?
---
Todd Howard blatantly lied on stage. Anything you took from that panel was a phony mirage. When are people going to stop giving him the benefit of the doubt. 
---
So raiders aren‚Äôt allowed to use gear off of the people they kill?
---
Yeah definitely do, if you're getting super frustrated with finishing it I can invite you to a game where they're present 
---
they never fixed the elevator on f4 so I guess is the reason its not in the game...
---
Or your blinded. It sucked from beta until now. They should refund everyone who wasted their money.
---
terminal inside wired 
---
lol nice
---
Thats kind, but I wouldn't even accept it if I was.  I can get junk.  Ive got enough time in I know what Im doing.  Purpose of the post was just hopefully to get some of these "raiders" to think about what they are doing to amuse themselves and choose to change (little hope of that to be frank, but hey, worth a shot) and hopefully let it be known there is appetite for a purely coop FO76 experience.  
---
Yeah I think we will rebuild after that patch goes in.  I had thought it already had which is why I was taken off guard.
---
There's also a terminal in the nearby RobCo facility where a disgruntled employee talks about deliberately programming that Miss Nanny to hate kids. Fun times.
---
That‚Äôs so annoyingly accurate. I had a ghoul climb up my base and start attacking a turret before they fired on it.
---
I've heard the shrouded mod is extremely good for sneak builds. However, the lack of 3-star wood armor makes it not really worth it.
---
She told me the Jack and the Beanstalk story the other day. Then when she went to go leave, I turned around and she never floated past me, I looked back and she was just dead on the ground, like the sole purpose was to tell that story then die.
---
Xbox 
---
Have an extra calibrated shock, will sell it for 5000 caps. I'm on Xbox
---
You see I get the reasoning for this post, but I have to also disagree because I feel that if you were roleplaying nobody would know your name unless you told them anyway.
---
He‚Äôs probably like me and runs Power Armor exclusively. 
---
Yeah, it was how fast this happened that got me.  I was working in the same room, I can see the TV from my desk.  Im guessing they had built out specifically to do this, wrecking ball and whatnot.  These people are just self focused assholes. Every game has them.  This one actually rewards them.  Hopefully that's changing with survival mode.
---
It's a sucky quest to be sure. It sounds like your cargobot was bugged. It only took me a few minutes total to bring it down.
---
Mama Dulche's is a completely different bag of flaming shit waste of time quest; especially if you have no intention of decoding anything and will just use the codes on Reddit.
---
 If you feel you have to do Feed the People, just bring along a couple dozen mines and keep seeding the entrances to the plant.  You have to run around less although it still takes time.
---
Yeah, poor guy. He should look up issues before giving up. Imagine all the amazing armor he could've had.
---
Get your daughter Fallout 4 where she can build in relative peace.
---
Lol! that happened to me twice today. Fist I though it was a glitch. Then I remembered about t he card.
---
That‚Äôs pretty much the point there. To much of one thing, loses its value. Micro and macroeconomics show exactly how and why things pan out the way that they do and why there‚Äôs a limited amount of wealth on the earth. America is one of the only countries that can mass produce currency and dictate its value. But even at that, it has its limitations. It‚Äôs one of the many reasons why socialism and communism never works. Everyone can have everything but then there‚Äôs no value. The human nature is to always be on the top but no one can be at the top of everyone is equally at the bottom. A little more economic/political than I wanted to go but psychology and economics were core studies that I enjoyed. Sadly not many seem to grasp the concept of temporary relief of emotional or economical gaps. 
---
PC or console?
---
What‚Äôs your chestpiece?
---
I have a marine dense mod.
---
I just hope things aren't too expensive. I play casually and with always buying new CAMP plans, I perpetually hover around 2000 caps. 
---
Glad the experience hasn't stopped you from having fun. Get out there, waste land Cowboy!
---
It would be a nice feature in fallout. I don't see why they haven't implemented it, considering elder scrolls online has that feature in its options. I always use it, I like seeing the roleplaying side of people. But of course, you still get players who name their character something that seems like a gamertag.
---
scrap guns and armor you don't need to learn mods so you can craft better versions or improve items you find.  
---
Weapons and armor have levels, so if you're using say, a level 1 hunting rifle at level 15, you will do more damage by finding or crafting a new hunting rifle as close to your current level as possible.  Ditto for armor.
---
Can you point at a time that has actually ever happened?  Not trying to pick on you or anything, but do we actually know Bethesda bans people for this? 
---
Yep - same issue here. Completed it about three times (each time no rewards), only to have it come back next time I log in
---
You can't pick a card that you don't have. How is that hard to understand? I can't choose the Radicool perk card because it's not in my inventory of cards to choose from. Along with 3 other cards im missing as well
---
Whoosh for me there!  I mean honestly I should have gotten it.  
---
Yeah, even when you are over the top being sarcastic (eating orphans to alleviate famine is honestly a great policy!) it's probably a good idea to add the /s. 
---
I have a mid level metal piece, for the weightless &amp; -50% fall damage.
---
But thanks for the offer.
---
It didn't.  It'll be a few hours of junk collecting and we'll do it again...AFTER the change to camps in pacifist happens.  Just posted to try to get some perspective out there.  Just because you have the freedom to do something does not mean you aren't a asshat if you use it to be a jerk.  Part of what we like about FO76 over FO4 is it really is a fantastic game when its cooperative.  She was having a blast, giving people access to the workstations, instruments, etc.  I was a little less thrilled when she started giving out "goodie bags" with my junk but it was so nice I was OK with it.   The fun for her was the interactions with real people, even if I make her play with the voice chat off.  Now that survival mode is live, if someone is playing a raider in Adventure, Im going to just say they are not someone I want to interact with.
---
So a raider role player is somehow going into a guys inventory after they killed them and taking their power armor and op rifles? No! You can‚Äôt loot weapons off of people!
---
Those are gold farmers. 
---
Fuck gold farmers. 
---
Always assume this is what‚Äôs happening. Always.
---
Yeah I like building in flat open spaces so you can see whose coming
---
Hey, i should have put it there sooner and I didn't mean to come off as angry as I did. Sorry.
---
Two-Shot? No way, not when you can get the Quad effect on crossbows! I've got one, you still load it one bolt at a time but you can cram four in that sucker. It's fantastic.
---
It is useful if you want to tag a bunch of mobs. Like the horde of ghouls in nuked Whitespring golf club. But not for damage.
---
I found a fireproof chest piece and haven't felt my explosive damage since
---
all you have to do is pick that perk the next time you level up under endurance, you don't need to wait for it to drop from a perk pack.
---
it saves a template, in case you delete this schematic all the pieces "get moved to the stash space" (not really stash, more like only-camp-related-buildings own storage)... so then can be placed again in case you want to use the pieces but not place the whole building.
---
I was messing with some and I could sneak all day in the faces of super mutants and gusties. The lack of mods sans the shrouded is the no thanks for me. Otherwise I‚Äôd invest in a set. 
---
I expected it.  The most active posters tend to be the "if the game lets me do it, its ok" type who just think of other people as content for them to enjoy. I think those of us who love this game most when people are helping each other, and would see a mode which encourages that instead of weirdos with rape and murder fantasy fulfillment as a end goal as a good thing.  They should go survival and be all murderhobo with their own kind.
---
I have my camp there because it‚Äôs convenient. And the turrets are so the ghouls or whatever else spawns there doesn‚Äôt destroy the base while they‚Äôre away. And calling orbital strikes is just an asshole move towards someone who liked the open space. 
---
Yeah I used one yesterday to do the kill X number of scorched with a crossbow. Loved it!
---
That is actually a very handy tip. Thanks. 
---
Oh the humanity
---
the reason why greifers lurk on adventure mode is because most of their targets will not fight back. in Survival mode everyone has a more fair shot at encounters so the "PVP players" in question cry about not being able to gloat about killing someone as easily. most real PVP players pal around in survival mode, having more fun then they ever did in adventure
---
But then who's going to feed my mole rats huh?!? Bet ya didn't think about that! &lt;:3}O{~
---
You should probably get out of PvP because it someone kills you you lose like 100-200 caps
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
How big is the radius?
---
I was wondering about this, not as a workshop claimer, but as a player trying to earn xp by events.  Been to 3 "defend workshop" events, and every single time random players will just shoot at me the entire event.  Not the owner.  I usually go on mic and insult their maturity level, but now I am curious if there is something I am missing.  Do they think I am with the owner maybe and trying to defend from them?  I wish playing wasn't so complicated.  I am confused about half the time.
---
Definitely the Red Rocket garage door
---
Correct... scorched exploding like a bomb on two consecutive occasions by the ranger DO in the bog
---
Why would you not want an entire server full of gary?
---
Did they scream ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Scorched Queen is great!‚Äô‚Äô before they detonated?
---
Lol
---
Bro, I would buy your whole stock üòÇ
---
Funny thing is, my kid got that.  She was actually stoked when a wandering patrol would swing by and she could kill them.  She was roleplaying "keeping it safe for nice vault people!"  It takes a real human to grief was my takeaway, cause supermutants dont show up in power armor and spray with explosive miniguns and the wrecking ball perk.  One thing to repair a couple turrets, another when they take down every single thing in minutes.
---
What people are forgetting is that this was therapeutic for your daughter before all this went down.  Sorry this had to happen to her.
---
Then you might be part of the suspended group that happened a while back.  
---
It really is a fantasy fulfillment that‚Äôs a great way to put it. Well, hopefully your daughter has recovered and you can rebuild! 
---
I thought you got double charged for one purchase. When you actually got two purchases. One unintentionally. Probably not worth the hassle of getting a refund. Enjoy your atoms!
---
The game is rated M so I'm not going to cater my behaviour to be child appropriate. That being said, Ive never leveled a camp.
---
Yeah I probably would have held off if I knew that wasn't live yet. For some reason I did.
---
Cuz it would be scary seeing Garys creepin around every Corner. So i would just shot everyone in the Face.
---
GT: Nesbitt121
---
Maybe not off of people, but finding better gear out in the wasteland, off of enemies, etc. It‚Äôs an rp for a reason, you‚Äôre allowed to bend some things that may not happen in-game, as long as it makes sense realistically. 
---
Hope it works out for ya!
---
I always hate that I can‚Äôt fast travel out of there if it‚Äôs on the floors below you. If you hang out long enough Iv had it come out of the elevator. 
---
If he's red then yes
---
Good to know.  I use the Power User Perk and Full Charge and hardly worry about finding fusion cores except for ones that I happen to stumble upon.  Both perks make those lame 25% charged fusion cells BSG implemented last patch more attractive by providing 50% of the energy of a regular fusion cell (non-perk affected).  I was passing those up before using the perks that make them viable. If this is a bug and they fix it, I may not need those power perks as much anymore.
---
I really haven't noticed VATS suddenly causing my Fusion cores to drain, but then again was was not eyeballing the power level when using VATS.  I will now.
---
Exactly, that would be the best
---
Yesterday I was selling to the vendor at harpers ferry when 2 in PA led a mob of mutants to the vendors area. I have to stop selling because the mutants are attacking me. When I start attacking the mutants one of the players hops in front of my melee attack. Now I‚Äôm hostile and unsuspectingly get killed by the players. Needless to say I was not happy about dropping that bulked junk... Sneaky trick and I should have just bounced. Always be wary of a group in PA. Especially in Harpers ferry. 
---
I‚Äôll try to reach everyone that has told me their GT‚Äôs tomorrow so expect a Xbox message from me when I get on
---
Haven't banks fucked our IRL enough already? We need them screwing up our fantasy world's too??
---
PSA: I work for a super-big financial institution. 
---
Believe me I will now
---
Exactly! I fell like most people saying that this is a great or the best Fallout game have never played any of the other Fallout games. FO76 is by far the worst Fallout game ever. 
---
I'm glad they've decided to do this, looking forward to the extra xp
---
I'm so bored of people putting "*Bethesda...*" at the start of their posts.
---
1. We aren't Bethesda.
---
2. Go report bugs to them if you find them. See point 1 for clarification.
---
3. If people are going to say "*It's not to report the bug, it's to have a discussion about it...*" then stop putting Bethesda in the damn title. See point 1.
---
A good set would be a BoS Painted Combat Armor Set not too expensive to repair and it‚Äôs the best physical defense in the game:
---
Saw that in crafting menus the other day. But it didn't seem to do anything.
---
Music is done server side so not possible 
---
I assumed they just suck against equal players
---
What?  I discarded or ate, or otherwise no longer have Perfectly Preserved Pie - didn't know it was so special.
---
Were the level 5 and level 90 on the same team?    If he did slap damage to you then they both become marked as hostile and you can take out the level 90 first.
---
I know this because I've been killed after being marked hostile when my team mates fucked with other players.
---
Then again, they may have been in party chat coordinating it all while not being on a team.
---
It's not an all or nothing situation, clearly there are some things that have to be addressed due to it being an online game, most of these people should have zero problem with, like the ones you mentioned, as they have an obvious impact on how the game is played. A lot of others don't.
---
Word. I used wood legs with shroud mod. All day sneak including mirelurks queen.  Easy mode with instigating OHKO weapon. Has anyone tested on SBQ  pulled out from nuke blast zone? Do u stay in sneak still? I‚Äôll try this next time there is nuke prime with SBQ outside the rad zone.
---
Well, in Survival Mode maybe. And every Gary should be equipped with a Pipe, except me. I have a Explosive Minigun.
---
Still usually like 5+ of them sitting near the top of this thread. I love bitching and asking for basic sandbox mechanics like the next guy. But holy crap im sure even the bethesda employee(s) that look are sick of reading them as much as some of us are.
---
I only got an alert the level 5 was wanted.  So I assume party chat 
---
I have no proof of anyone getting banned for anything other than duping. Sorry.
---
I thought I saw a post (patch notes maybe) listing out all the things that are considered bannable. Going from server to server constitutes as harassment.
---
Stop putting limited time paints.
---
Added pressure on top of the high prices are nuts.
---
Put limited time costumes but not CAMP items or paints.
---
That's just stupid.
---
Dude for fucks sake. Im lvl 151, i know how the game works. I can't choose the card because it's not there. I seriously don't know how else to say it. Comment whatever else you like im done with the minefield of idiots that are left in this sub
---
I think there's a magazine spawn in here too!
---
My point is you don't need to be an asshole just because you are free to be.  There was no purpose behind what these guys did besides griefing, possibly some caps.  And there are easier ways to get caps.  They could have gone to Survival mode and played with others that are into the same thing.    
---
Hey man.
---
If you don't want it.
---
Don't buy it.
---
Right?
---
Right. 
---
U sure there was not there a player called "A 76 Update" that just blocked your camp on reconection?
---
Not all hero's wear capes. Good job!
---
Seriously. Dude bro offered 6.5, said he wouldn't be on for a few hours, someone offered more, told him, he throws a bitch fit and starts acting all entitled saying I "promised" it to him- which I started saying only when he started acting like a little bitch. Then when I decide to stand up for myself, he can't fucking handle it, and reports me and gets my trading post removed. Never trade with him ever.
---
What?!?  I've never seen more than a few ticks on one place.    
---
I guess I didn't think of Butcher's Bounty - but still, seems like a lot of work to get that many.  
---
How many ticks to get 500 Stimpacks?  \~150?  \~100?    
---
x2 Chemist, x? Super Duper, x? Butcher's Bounty - there aren't any other multipliers, right?
---
It was a solid move that you waited for them. If they didn‚Äôt come in a reasonable time I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs fair to take it. 
---
Yeah just say that post hes definitely a whiner you even offered it to him when he offered more 
---
I firmly believe in everyones right to be a freaky neckbeard fedora wearing incel who lives in their moms basement and gets their jollies by being a murderhobo.  Truly.  I would just like the ability to not play with them
---
If you was in adventure mode turn on pacifist. Slap damage is gone and other players do 0 damage to you when they attack you now. 
---
I wish we had the original nights back.  Nights used to be darker, but the Dec 11th patch boosted outdoor 'exposure' settings, making lots of areas brighter and flatter with less contrast at night.  Frankly, they should rollback those changes wholesale.  Not only did they hurt the original atmosphere, but they bugged out the inventory and crafting screens with insane bloom.  Try inspecting any note, the Propaganda Poster, molotov cocktail, healing salve, the brown mod box, or 10mm ammo box, and you'll see what I mean.  Lighter-colored stuff got hit the worst.
---
Yup.
---
Plus, tbh, I have lots of components cluttering up my stash that I'm not using. 
---
Use a tent. 
---
I currently use gatling lasers. A primed bloody explosive and a vamps with limb damage. (Both organic drops, I swear) Used to use melee. Its changed a lot since I started doing them in December, but I always bring something with limb damage. Not that I've done it all that much. Probably 25 or 30 times. And I'm not ashamed to say I've lost as many queen fights as I've won. Some due to glitches. I've seen her fly off in the middle of the fight, but not for a while. 
---
I'm a firm believer that luring her out of the blast zone makes her act weird. Especially if you put the nuke south of FSP, so the blast zone extends beyond the map. I admit that may just be superstition on my part, though.
---
Awesome, is that one I can buy? Or should I craft it? 
---
Sorry - been out of the loop. Thank you though :D
---
People who "roleplay as raiders" are just using it as an excuse to be assholes.
---
Yup, pretty much. It's all under my profile, can see everything I said and what he said. Pisses me off.
---
I'm genuinely confused then, this goes against everything I know about the perk system.  At lvl 50 or so (I think some we're locked to lvl 60ish) you can choose any perk you like upon leveling up.  The perk packs toy understanding are just and added 5 cards to your deck.  Are you telling me.thay the cards available to choose.when leveling up are limited to cards that have been rng pulled from decks?
---
I didn't realize this stuff was on a 24 hour timer. My CAMP is right next to a magazine spawn - next time I'll try server hopping. I'll get that Wastelad minigame yet!
---
Didn't know that was a thing.  Will definitely do that.  Will have to look into where I set that.
---
That looks great. Is it heavy?
---
I disagree.
---
100% agreed! I thought it would adapt, but now my dude is running around in a frilly sniper outfit. Half tempted to gender flip just so it doesn't look weird. 
---
Which gam have you seen a raiderfully suited in robot future armor shooting a plasma cannon and throwing plasma grenades. I get your point but I‚Äôm saying, traditional raiders in fallout games don‚Äôt have all of this advanced tech and weaponry.
---
Yea man I‚Äôve been through that just gotta laugh it off 
---
That was amazing. Well done. 
---
Somebody else said the going rate is 100 caps.
---
No. Not even close. Wait for a sale. I bought it for $25 USD and that feel like about the right price.
---
There's a patch coming down the road where if you are in pacifist mode,  no one can do damage to your camp. As for survival mode,  that's pretty much unfolded as  I expected. I predicted that griefers wouldn't like playing in a server where everyone is just like them.   I've been wanting Bethesda to remove PVP completely from adventure mode, so people like those who wrecked you camp would be trapped in a server where everyone is like them.
---
Right? Visually I think it‚Äôs on par today but mechanically Bethesda is lagging nearly 7-10 years in almost every game they‚Äôve developed since Morrowind.
---
tbh looking the hape of it the first time they shown the next updates expeected I though the same thing
---
Feels bad man ive had that i womt say his name but alot of the time when i have a set price this guy would always comment "what a joke" or "you can be serious" so any time i have an item for sale amd he comments i just give it to the guy who bidded less out of spite
---
Thanks! Not at all; the head is a bit hefty but everything is well balanced and detachable for travel.
---
Need any help with nuke run?
---
Guess so. Remembered the bit about not posting names so had to edit the post, oof
---
Lmao nice xD
---
I get my plastic from laser rifles with scrapper. 10 per. 
---
Thanks mate. Appreciate those kind words.
---
Wasn't red.  
---
I believe I have the plans, but have no idea what Mats it takes. I'll check after dinner, PM me or something
---
Its dumb but if yoy wanna be an ass expect bad treatment back
---
Then dont trod out the sob story about them hurting your special needs child's feelings. 
---
Just confirmed, I do not currently own the perk card but can freely choose it when leveling up. Don't know what to say other than either you are mistaken or I do not understand your issue.
---
Hey thanks, that's true I didnt really think of that I just scoff because for me server hopping takes away the immersion of the game. I get that some people are collectors but I like the survive and take only what you need simplicity. I like rumaging through my stash too just making sure I travel light, feels more real. And OP mentioned something about ripping your hair out after so many tries, that doesn't seem fun.
---
My first ever Atom shop purchase was the Nuka Rocketsuit. I was sure bummer when I saw it was for ladies!
---
Am I to blame? All other Fallout games had unisex outfits.
---
Agree. There needs to be a male version and a female version - then you can choose which one your gender-bending self wants to go with on any particular day.
---
It means you are banned bro. 
---
Should be okay on the run. But always welcome.  Just got bio card and 1st lvl clear 
---
I'll have to find the paper with the math but each tick can give 0-3 blood it takes 2 tick blood and 1 antiseptic (which you get from tick sacs) with the perk 80% of the time you get tick blood. Let's say you get 8 from the 10. That's pretty good and with super duper and chemist it really works well.
---
Also buchers bounty use to be bugged and not work on ticks was change two patches ago. So I started farming them.
---
Though I totally misread where that title was going....
---
Yeah I thought so but it‚Äôs so unfair are they not going to unban people 
---
It‚Äôs so dumb 
---
I wish I could upvote more! That looks great! I would almost get smacked with it just to see if it would make the sound effect lol.
---
That‚Äôs awesome.
---
Have you whacked anything with it yet?
---
So you came to my house logged into my ps4 and looked through what perk cards i had available? Hope you wiped your feet
---
I would sell em if I wasn't stuck at max. :/
---
Went up against a guy with a tse shotgun, one shotted every time. Sentinel assassins is a major factor, I'm talking just plain assassins. 
---
Your right, but my point still stands that with the right rifle say a bloodied, explodie lever with the right perks you can one shot someone. 
---
I THOUGHT WHAT WE HAD WAS SPECIAL!!!
---
Yep, higher limit means higher prices.
---
Something something server stability 
---
Like i said about the mindfield of idiots. Just cause something works for you doesn't mean it's that way for everyone
---
Absolutely
---
I had a quad crossbow at one point and I regret dumping it, it was heavy but a lot of fun to use
---
BoS Combat Armor Plans are super rare now and overpriced to buy so I really don‚Äôt know however u want to do.
---
Just trying to get people to think a bit.  If this event doesn't bother you, that's fair.  My intention was to illustrate what sort of thing can happen when you go into online games like this one thinking its a battle royale or something and just treat people as content.  Especially when you have a mode where people are specifically signing up for that.  
---
I think Bethesda went with a fixed-sex clothing thing because there were numerous complaints by a lot of people who like realism a bit too much that clothes can't just fit a girl or guy body in a snap in real life. 
---
I'm a simple gal, I do fashion shows when I find a new outfit. But when a tan suit looks frumpy and ugly on her, of course I'm not gonna be happy. 
---
Haha this is hilarious.  Why wouldn't an explosive gun do the same thing to you? 
---
Like,  if I shot a mini nuke at myself that would definitely affect me.  Same thing lol
---
I dont know if its still a thing, but if someone trashed a base build you could always just move the C.A.M.P. to another location and then just place everything down again. If not packing up the base would allow you to place all the parts down again without having to repair them.
---
I wanted to whack Todd Howard's face with it at the Bethesda Game Days event, but no luck.
---
I'll check with my buddy - he has played every day since launch. I'm sure he has the ability to craft :3
---
Thank you!
---
Umm, no.  Please check you available cards to pick from next time you can level up.  I'm only lvl 81 and it sits there ready for me to choose.  The way you describe your issue is simply not supposed to be the way the game works.  If you still don't have it  a bug report is in order.  Good luck to you and I hope you understand I was just confused and didn't mean to convey you were ignorant.
---
Yeah I really need to get on your level. Haha you‚Äôre talking about advanced shit I don‚Äôt even know about 
---
No problem!
---
If they don't make it a new build zone then every normal fallout player should build there, but not turret CAMPs. Just so Tuuret camps cannot find a server to have their stupid shit turret pansy CAMP
---
lol, we're still not Anthem. 
---
Also additional lulz at all the salty posts trying to tear you down for saying anything positive. 
---
The weight of their innocent, carefree, human loving souls leaving their body really frees things up.
---
I tried it for a second time.. and I really cant say what it is that I dont like but I just dont find myself enjoying it the way I've enjoyed 3,Nv and 4... shit I think I even played shelter more than 76 and I feel bad :/ I was hyped but idk whats wrong with me 
---
You misunderstand. I dont disagree with explosive damage hurting the user. I disagree with the perk to make shotguns break your enemies bones affect yourself because that is making the explosive damage do the extra limb damage and not the bullets themselves. Again, it renders the perk useless for any shotgun using the only secondary legendary affect worth having.
---
I mostly self aid items for money. A little junk but I end up giving a lot of that away. Mostly because I‚Äôm a solo player and don‚Äôt really do the whole player vending thing. But that may change here soon. 
---
You are the absolute worst OP. Carry on.
---
My character is Dwayne Gretzky and nobody knows 
---
Be in game open the menu then under settings/game you'll find the pacifist mode toggle. With it on you do 0 damage and other players do 0 damage to you while in adventure mode. 
---
Can't you just get the plans for a given weapon, craft a whole bunch of them, then scrap them to gain mods?
---
This probably a good lesson for your girl some people are ass hats and it does not cost very much to repair your camp like it just isn‚Äôt s big deal 
---
I laughed quite hard at this. Thank you.
---
Ahh well  if he was wanted then they would not have both been marked.   The level 5 probably did some minor damage to someone's camp to get a small wanted level. And when you hit him you became a target for his team mate because they were on the same team. Makes sense. 
---
Username does not check out
---
Haha, Gary
---
It should have the option to use our Bethesda.net usernames, I have always thought this. It would really help build a sense of community.
---
You shouldn't be paying anything for cosmetics that don't affect the game. Shops likes this rely on idiots like you even entertaining the idea of paying ten bucks for a spinny, shiny piece of digital nothing.
---
 &gt; Its just sad to see a full priced game with so many persistent bugs and reappearing bugs and new bugs still so heavily aimed at microtransactions
---
You've got to be kidding me. EA does lootcrates and unlocks that are microtransaction based. You literally have to buy them if you want to advance in the game. The only microtransactions in this one are COSMETIC. If you want to the THE ATOM SHOP is aimed at microtransactions, you actually have a point since that's it's entire reason for existing. 
---
Adamantium skeleton...
---
I can't believe i've seen this Bot today for the first time and i killed him immediatly thoughting is hostile.
---
 Bugger
---
Maybe u want to give a hand and check it out?
---
I will be very surprised and sad if they don't add this. I made a post on here about this, asking for the nuka cola machine door, and it got over 1k upvotes. If this doesn't show Bethesda what the community wants then I don't know what will. 
---
Thanks for the offer, but the point isnt to get stuff.  I can do that, hell its endgame at the moment really.  I really was just motivated to vent a little, hopefully get some of these raider guys to think over what they are doing and take it to survival, and hopefully, let Bethesda know there is a audience for a game mode which is purely cooperative.   I think they are on that path with the next patch, just hoping they continue to get the message.  Its truly a fantastic cooperative game.  Its an absolute shitty PVP one ironically.   After playing multiplayer games for around 31 years (I was playing MUDs on telnet in the late 80s before web browsers even existed) I can say I have never seen a game pull of PVP and PVE Coop in the same game well, without a hard separation in the mode.  Dark Age of Camelot was pretty close.   When they are mixed like this what happens is it attracts people who don't really want a competitive experience, they want to grind hard so they can bully others.    
---
Gold farmers??! Theres gold farmers in Fallout76?? Dang it!!!!!
---
Huh. That's a sad workaround for slap damage not existing. 
---
You'd think these tools would just go hang out in Survival but I guess that's too fair. 
---
No, you only have to police one account name for offensive words.  And it's not getting recreated regularly.  And Microsoft and Sony will do it for you for Xbox and Playstation.
---
Policing character names that can be deleted and created constantly is significantly harder.
---
"But word filters!!" They only catch the most obvious ones, and lag behind slang and or ch@r@cter substituti0n schemes.
---
Thank you so much! :3 Since everything is EVA Foam and Sonotube for the head of the prop, it makes a dull thud noise.
---
Ugh.  This bothered the hell out me since BETA day one.  I rolled up [Dwayne Schrute](https://imgur.com/pAWxY9Y), great grandson of Dwight, all set to take on the wasteland and make people laugh, and all they see is Shankwell.
---
It also works with serendipity! You should be grateful, since this also applies to any enemies you end up shooting.  
---
It doesn't do extra limb damage, it just outright breaks the limbs. Even if you deal zero damage, it still has the chance to stagger/break things.
---
I know but that shouldn't be necessary in this case.
---
I dream of a day like this OP. A fresh, virgin server all to myself, just waiting for m 
---
No the level 5 became wanted after his repeated attacks on me while I waited
---
And why not?
---
If people want to give feedback and have a nice discussion about a topic of the game that's totally fine. It's not fine though to ask BETHESDA BETHESDA BETHESDA in every post you make like they need to see it. Trust me, they will see it even if you don't write Bethesda at the title, i mean who else do you think is reading this subreddit? other companies? ! ? .........
---
Save them from what? Other players taking them in legitimate PVP?
---
Kinda defeats the purpose of PVP.
---
Of course, you can always store them on another character.
---
uhm. ü•¥
---
I tried joining, but the server crashed a few minutes after getting in.
---
I'm sorry, you'll have to join the line to your left.
---
Fantastic.  Exactly what I want
---
Wow dude. Just wow. Do you think im so stupid that i can't see if i have a card or not? Like fucking really? My game has been like that for months. I have screenshots. Telling someone how their game works without seeing it for yourself is idiotic. I understand how the game should work but it always doesn't work like intended. 
---
Same 
---
This happened to me more times than I can count. I spent a lot of time just building/crafting and often stay at my camp. So the griefers just see my icon on the map and come wreck my stuff with mini nukes.
---
Yeah it crashed but we just loaded into a new lobby and are restarting
---
I don‚Äôt have a better way to display the photo since the sub is text only so hopefully it is sufficient
---
Doesn‚Äôt have to make sense (with my name).
---
Weightless is intended to work with the chameleon mutation. Whereas, a chameleon piece will always work. 
---
Speech: 100
---
Cool, glad to help :)
---
Ik
---
I really hope bethesda gets the message.  I think that people like us could really love the game if we didnt have to worry about everyone wandering by being one of these bullies.
---
&gt;But then again all you'd need is some kinda crazy filter when making names
---
They're not all that effective.  Sure, they'll catch the obvious ones, but they lag behind slang and/or ch@racter substitut1on schemes.
---
I knew they would, and it's only getting better. We haven't seen anything yet. 
---
I want more excavator and ultracite paint 
---
And you don't just magically get cards, they come from packs. Then you can choose them at your convenience when leveling up
---
Yeah but those we can always report.
---
I specifically said that I dont think you are stupid and if the game is not working like that for you, you should make a bug report.  Can you share some screen shots with me.so.i can better understand this problem so I can be more.helpful.in the future?
---
‚ÄúLegitimate pvp‚Äù it‚Äôs super buggy and in survival people can easily take thousands of caps spamming explosive weapons. It would be nice if we could store at least a few thousand 
---
I believe the purifiers actually have what looks like catch tarps on them- they aren't functional, obviously, but the visual is there. 
---
Golded for awesome skills and 5000% more patience than most mortals can muster :-)
---
Yep, this is my go to for when I've got a bit of unprocessed ore. Get the workshop going, drop 3 acid processors  going, 30 acid every half hour or so.
---
Lol I fall asleep thinking about how to make caps. I woulda hit the cap limit a few times a but when I get close I go buy a nice legendary for 5-7k and start selling again. 
---
Agreed to a point.  But why should we have to?  It was just mean for those guys to do that, with no reason for it other than they want to be jerks.  I just wanted to call it out for what I think it is.  Its easily remedied, go play survival, and hopefully Bethesda just goes all the way and turns off PVP in adventure entirely or gives us a purely coop game mode.  
---
892 caps per round for .38 ammo
---
And that's all I'll sell
---
I have a 1* junkies dragon and some 50 caliber balls to trade for that TSE combat shotgun? Gt doubleA3455
---
Reports aren't free for Bethesda to handle.
---
Bethesda has to pay someone to read the report, decide if the name is offensive, change or not change based on their opinion, have a boss that reviews their decision, then have another person handle the ticket from the person who had their name changed, and after not to long you have to have a meeting to make the official decision whether nuts@ck69 is offensive enough to force a name change.
---
And then he creates a new character named b@lls@ck69 and the whole process starts over again.
---
You mean grandma's weapon rack?
---
Wow, just WOW! That's a lot of work you put in and has a lot of great info. Thanks!
---
Unfortunately the way she built it was very cool, but dependent on the location.  This is another reason I am hopeful we will get a truly coop mode.  Im not saying that there should be no place for murderhobos, I'm just saying lets leave room for the rest of us. 
---
You hit back shhh had what‚Äôs coming 
---
Amazing idea
---
Good point it would be cool if they were functional just for immersion sake
---
Ur actually stupid 
---
All I have to say is this:
---
The internet needs more people like you.
---
Also, Fallout 76 needs a lot of work.
---
Also all markets are different I'm on xb1 and I feel like there are more playing on the system which helps keep prices lower. Just my observation though.
---
YES! I hate all these suggestions cloging the feed. I want to see what players are up to and cool things people have done, not dumb suggestions that will never be implemented. 
---
That's not nice at all, but what I do is protect people from not so nice people like the ones that destroyed your daughters work, I protect lower levels while they build there base and they can message me if people are destroying it we need more people like me in this community 
---
This argument is redundant...it is nothing to have two versions of one set that you buy...you are not even talking about the point being made
---
There's a place in the DMV terminal that you can register a robot
---
Sorry, those are very low value compared to the TSE shotgun's high value. No thanks, not interested in those items anyways.
---
That is not true, the perk cards are level locked. (supposed to be). If that's not how it's working for you you need to create a bug report.
---
I‚Äôm sorry that happened but that is part of the whole experience with this game why should they give up there fun for you to because don‚Äôt like it the same as they wouldn‚Äôt like it if they took it out of the game. There are plenty of game out there like mine craft that sounds more suited to what you want. 
---
Yeah, but two shot you have a chance of recovering two arrows each time you shoot.
---
You are not the first to report this, and it seems to be effecting allot of console users.
---
Wait people actually use bobbleheads and magazines? TIL.
---
This one is almost as bad as taking no rads drinking or swimming in irradiated water yet if you gather wAter you take rads ...  #wtf 
---
You're right and I take back everything I said. For shame those who want to roleplay in a game that encourages role-playing.
---
Because no other game has figured out how to put character name over account name /s
---
No loadouts o swaping between fucking cards...
---
Just MMO-like server management and clasic and permanent skills...
---
But nooo, it had to be casual.... it had to take advantage of the "diogenes factor" (just get the 100% of things in a single game) instead  "exploit every unique playstyle related to a depth character"... the game content was not of enough quality so replaying option was probably forgot at the beggining.
---
I've killed it before, but the sound of this one just gets me disoriented. 
---
It‚Äôs basically a save file name for those with multiple characters.
---
Hmm, I completed that quest line but I don't think I got BoS rifle plans. And is it any better than a hunting rifle with upgrades?
---
Launched yet?
---
Damn straight we do.  I think survival mode is a good step.  Its a pretty simple fix, just let me play without having to interact with people whose idea of fun is ruining mine.
---
I already found one but thanks for asking
---
I'm on PC
---
Mojave desert*
---
I miss that look so much
---
They don't go to pvp because they suck at it, and want to recoup their losses by killing people who aren't specked for pvp. 
---
No other game has figured out how to put character name *and not have to handle a large and endless number of offensive name reports.*
---
My raider character is designed to look like Abe but his name is Eba, I can't RP as a temperature as my gamertag
---
What are the red boxes?
---
I looked for it, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs in the game yet. Probably a future atom shop item 
---
I don‚Äôt get why she was essential anyway, she had no questline that I‚Äôm aware of and all she did was talk shit
---
Sweet! Look me up. THRDStooge. I appreciate your help. 
---
lol. Good Deads is how you got to do good deeds.  Thanks for making the game fun for kids. Imagine getting a fusion generator as a low level.. Like Christmas.
---
Just initiated launch prep
---
You're right I'm wrong and I retract everything I said.
---
It‚Äôs upstairs in her office and around the back outside mama dolces js a pipe you enter
---
Had this game a week now and still cant play it. Keeps popping up with an error message saying no reion ping?
---
I think Skyrim had those mechanics for it's survival mode, it would be cool
---
The thing is also is that since fallout 4 vault boy uses that version of it in the perkcard art or perkchart art as well 
---
Unfollow the event so it doesn‚Äôt confuse you
---
There was nothing memorable for me, but I guess you could grind for experience.
---
Agreed. And her husband was such a Gloomy Gus. I get that their backstory was tragic, but why have such a downer attitude for the rest of all eternity? I killed her and put him in that wooden punishment thingy. 
---
As a note, you can likely recover the base for free if you relog. When super mutants destroy mine, since no turrets, relogging fixes it like new.
---
On another note, might suck and leave a bad taste in your mouth but it seems the majority of players are really good guys and friendly as hell. So what I'm trying to say is, don't let your daughter give up on making her awesome bases. Hopefully next time you have some better luck next time.
---
And tell her, "Remember kids, don't feed the Yao Guai.".
---
But...but... but that‚Äôs my favorite quest! ü§£
---
Seriously, kudos. I wish nukes would get dropped in more seemingly random places like this just for kicks
---
/queue "I believe I can fly"
---
It is a shame the character naming is just your Game Save Name rather than actually character name. It makes sense to let you name the saves but it should be like Dark Souls where you can choose setting for if people's gamertag or character name shows for you. 
---
Eh, this is why I'm personally not a huge fan of explosive weapons.   You HAVE TO invest in certain perks just to avoid blowing yourself up while using them. 
---
Though I have explosive weapons, my go to is anti-armor legendary minus explosive effects.  Anti armor weapons combined with anti armor perks (e.g. tank killer, stabilized) can do impressive damage even without the explosive effect, in my opinion. 
---
Launch prep stsrted
---
Maybe anouther vault 76 dweller that figured out how to use the radio station that tells events like if someone launches a nuke or in game events like back on the beat
---
Let‚Äôs all make new gamer tags called Gary[#] and play 76 that way
---
I think I'll always care about caps. Whether it be buying ballistic fiber bulk from vendors to buying plans I haven't learned yet.
---
How about they fix "passive" and let us let others know "I dont care to shoot you, not do I care to be shot, I'm not here for pvp just here to play the game"
---
And make passive mode invisible to other players, and vice versa. But, knowing the game so far, someone will learn how to glitch the game into activately invincibility so they can just come in and destroy everything.
---
I have a copy n past of the kind of things I have for sale, here's an example of some of the stuff I have. Leaving most of the higher ticket stuff I have out because I wont be online for days and I dont want ppl trying to buy lol. Usually I'll take whatever somone offers unless it's a max lvl explosive weapon. Most of what's currently here goes for like 500 caps crazy easy.

I gotta say, sort of on topic, that I love the Wiffle Bat. Even though I have it nodded to the max with the fiery jets and everything, it just looks like a wiffle Bat. Wish it had a distinctive sound effect. 
---
I think the workshop dynamic needs work in Adventure.  PVP should simply be eliminated at workshops in Adventure mode and another regulating mechanism enacted so resources can be mined without murder and mayhem, but not letting anyone hog the resources for 8 hours.  
---
You, good sir or madame, have completely changed how I travel through the bog. Thank you for this brilliant idea. I‚Äôm ashamed I could now think of it myself. 
---
I now before your brilliance, and may RNGesus bless you with incredible legendary drops!
---
Yeah I can see it being, I just dont know how you can prove it easilly.  And if it is harassment the 2nd or 3rd time, why isnt it the first?  Why not keep the PVP to survival mode so there's a actual chance to opt out?  Sounds like thats coming so Im hopeful.  I also wish it would flag usernames which went aggro with you on the social menu.  Id like to block the guys who did this, but it was so fast I didnt catch their ids.
---
Bullies never fight fair, they know they couldn't win.
---
Somehow a wendigo got into the pool room outside Taggardy's office though all the security gates, etc.  Surprised the snot out of me. 
---
I‚Äôd rather they release the actual gun instead of making it a skin, along with the Chinese assault rifle 
---
I used to have a coworker who would get drunk after work and then log on to some Conan mmorpg that was open free pvp and he would then go into the newbie area and just wreck noobs until he passed out. Some people are just shitty people. 
---
Thinking outside the vault... I like it.
---
Right back at you.  Keep on building things instead of tearing them down.
---
Dave the mirelurk
---
if this guy can fight, I'd let it follow me everywhere. The first true companion in FO76.
---
To be fair, some arent.  Those would be the ones in survival mode.  The ones in adventure? Yes. Yes they are,
---
There‚Äôs an order?  In that case I‚Äôve bugged out 5 characters!!!
---
If I had realized that to begin with, I would have named my character Game Save.
---
Agreed.  I also think its fair to tell the raiders on adventure mode that they are being awful people and why.
---
I wish the dress that the blonde is wearing in the live action trailer existed in game. 
---
Best way to describe it is Alice in Wonderland. Light blue with white apron. 
---
Luckily the full Passive update will save us from that! 
---
Did you buy it on Day One or Day Seven? I think OP might be more pot-committed than you.
---
You legend! 
---
Wood armor looks really cool, but it's weird that you can't craft it. It's clearly just random tree bark.
---
Thats what survival mode is for.
---
really sorry this happened to you kid, some people just suck and I guess it even carries over in gaming. I hope she continues to build and have fun. I'm one of those people that enjoy touring other gamers settlements and enjoy when people come see mine. Thanks for sharing.
---
might be worth the caps. as opposed to having the little mosquito follow you around and f-up what ever else you are trying to accomplish. 
---
Gonna get had either way, next time attack the big guy first. there is a reason you were chosen instead of him. 
---
What platform are you on?
---
Get a console and don't play PC games on potatoes 
---
How would y‚Äôall feel if I opened a shop where you pay me to mod your weapons? I‚Äôve been thinking about it for a while now
---
I approve of this suggestion and would take it a step further: Give us a Data screen in Pip Boy that shows a "plan map" which lists all plans and whether or not you have them (even though I greatly appreciated the addition of (Known)).   It could be separated into tabs - weapons, armor, etc.

She was.  I watched this happen.  SO fast.  This was just griefing.  She wasnt upset when super mutants attacked.  She was upset when other players mowed down her work with zero chance to defend it. This was griefing, and yes its a M rated game.  Im not complaining about content of the game, Im complaining about griefing within it, which is especially clear since they could go survival if thats what they want to do, and play with people who want the same thing. 
---
The game is at a much better point now too, and so I feel like putting Fallout 76 or Bethesda or even Todd Howard in a Youtube Title or Article Header is literally for clicks
---
Boo, I have two legendary crossbows but they're on PS4. They're really fantastic and challenging weapons to use.
---
Distinction without a difference
---
I have a insitgating dragon with vats 33% chance to hit increase, also a heave 3* unyeilding raider leg with ammo weight reduction. Interested in those?
---
The story she told me was Hansel and Gretel on the first encounter and Goldilocks the second time (two different characters). I agree though, it's stuff like this that makes Fo76 fun. I  hope they add more fun encounters and Easter eggs in the future!
---
I think it's a viable idea to assist people who have a vision for their weapon but not the mats or schematics.
---
Awesome idea! 
---
Pacifist mode will prevent your unintended attacks on people jumping in front of you.
---
You havent run into a wrecking crew like this then.  The thing was destroyed in minutes.  And why should I have to quit the game to avoid people greifing me?  I get there are ways to cope with these people, I just think I should have a right to call them out for it.
---
Ahh damn, thanks for the thought though.
---
Thx. I figure it would work best for lever actions and melee
---
Be honest with yourself, this guy is acting like a childish fool, and that's pretty stupid. I have no problems unlocking perk cards from the many various specials.
---
Queen?
---
You can move the camp inside of the build radius all you have to do is click on it and just sever hop till you find a server that you are able to place your camp
---
Where abouts?
---
Awesome this is so good!!
---
Agreed.  I think a lot of us have been saying this since beta.  I posted, despite knowing Id take some abuse, just to make this point.  Again.
---
Hahaha
---
Yes, you get the thirst and bonuses, but no hunger satisfied. Same the other way around for Herbivore, meat doesn't satisfy hunger but you get the bonuses.
---
Did they fix the mayor stimpack farm?
---
Love it!
---
Right back at you and agreed.
---
We need Nuka-Cola everything! Nuka-Cola the T-shirt, Nuka-Cola the coloring book, Nuka-Cola the lunchbox, Nuka-Cola the breakfast cereal, Nuka-Cola the FLAMETHROWER (the kids love this one)!
---
There is a mode suited for what they want.  Why should I not get to play the way I wish to?  
---
Couldn‚Äôt care less about XP to be honest. Maybe I‚Äôll stick to waiting
---
I like this idea, mostly because I have a ton of intelligence and so little charisma.
---
I barely wanted to spend the $40 in the first place, let alone $80 but I guess. Here's to my camp looking *extra* spiffy... 
---
I want the vault suit from the trailer, reminds of the vault armour from fallout 3
---
It was too fast.  I wish I had video.  
---
Try taking an addictol. Even when the addiction disappears from the effects tab, it is still on your character. I know I've been getting junkies like mad, but when I realized my charisma was off and took one, they stopped. I'd assume every character that hasn't taken an addictol since biv came out is addicted to alcohol. 
---
When you get hit while stealthed, or shooting explosive bullets while stealthed?
---
It's not clear what you're asking?
---
Anything *processed* still works normally. Such as teas, soups. But basic vegetables like corn won't count if eaten in their raw state.
---
You don't use explosives much do you? If they survive mine they are usually missing a limb or three.
---
I understand this upcoming, patch will take away folks ability to wreck a camp and will have no impact on the PVP nature of workshops in adventure mode. However, there are those of us that want zero PVP, for many reasons...child wants to play, adult wants to just relax, etc. Beth has catered to the PVP crowd by creating survival mode. Why is it that none PVP folks should be treated like step children for asking for what would make the game better for them. Creating this peaceful mode would not be difficult. This could also attract more players, that may at some point want to transition to adventure or survival mode. The only reason, that I can think of, that folks would be against creation of this peaceful mode is that the bullies/raiders would be left to fight folks that are just like them or are good at PVP...less sheep for the slaighter? For me, after a stressful day at work, I just want to immerse myself totally and completely in a world that is different than my work and relax in that world...not run around competing with other humans...that is the world I am interested in leaving behind, if only for a couple of hours. 
---
I am not any less of a gamer for wanting spend my time playing in this 'peaceful' way that apparently is boring to other folks, whom I respect for their choice in game play.
---
From a business perspective, peaceful mode may be a great way to get people to spend real money in the atom store...folks that like to build camps are going to be visiting that store alot..and will more likely be spending real money.
---
Meow. 
---
Please be queen and not WS. 
---
I am, just it doesn't proc but 30% of the time. 
---
It really was awesome when it was going good.  Thats why I wanted to tell the story, the game is freaking fantastic as a coop experience.  They are missing a huge audience by catering to griefers.  Who I truly think are the minority.  If they fix adventure mode to be truly coop only, I bet the numbers prove it.
---
And level!?  Why on earth does the level in our ID not reflect our player level?
---
I noticed.  In less than 10 minutes I lost 90% of my caps.  
---
Yes but that 30% chance is more than you think 
---
I see. Kinda sucks. It'd be nice if they at least had it reduce the materials cost to make one then. Oh well.
---
Ah, ps4 here but thanks anyways!
---
I've only looted three explosive weapons since the beta. Last one I found was in January, I have no idea how people find them.
---
Sorry i thought you said you where out of the room believe me when I say I do feel sympathy for her but it is apart of the game. I don't condone thier actions but it is a game mechanic that may be removed here soon and I really do hope that this doesn't dissuade her from playing or trying again. 
---
I've seen plans in the Charleston station sold there
---
Sorry I‚Äôll clear it up. Does shooting explosive bullets affect your stealth?
---
Actually it was two, I forgot I bough tone of them.
---
Can't you just repair it all for a small amount of materials at your C.A.M.P.?
---
Right before you go into the actual building at Fort Defiance there‚Äôs a terminally on a post by doors. 
---
Login to that and you get the plans free... 
---
Also if you didn‚Äôt know, you can now go on the computer upstairs and download the whole power armor plans as well.
---
Is the clean space helmet rare? I‚Äôve been using it as the helmet for my outfit for a few months now, never seen one since 
---
World full. I‚Äôm Queued. 
---
Try telling that to r/gaming, they would go fucking ballistic on you.
---
Why, yes, I have.  About 900 times.
---
Totally agreed.  I guarantee I have spent more on ATOMS than any murderhobo.  
---
What type of PA? I got a set of Ultracite and it‚Äôs plans completing the quest line
---
Well said! It saddens me to hear of your daughter‚Äôs bad experience with griefers (and they were 100% griefers). I agree with what you‚Äôve said and I hope it makes some people think twice ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I'm not using 4k downscaling currently.  I was just speculating it might be worth a try.
---
I'm carrying an awful lot of stuff...so there's that.
---
How many craftable alcohol recipes are there? I haven't found a complete "Biv List" yet
---
Not all raider do either do they?
---
I'm a believer in small groups for Roleplay, but a larger context where perhaps 20 players have interlocking stories.  RP isn't about the shooting...that's the spice.  It's about character.
---
Basically out of the Vault and a few players originating from other locales.  All canonical and very serious, not quite what BGS is doing with things like Fasnacht and such.  More to follow.
---
Made me laugh. Get out of Survival, it is your own fault, play in adventure, where your stuff is safe in pacifist mode. Stop blaming Bethesda for your inability to use the features of the game correctly.
---
Agreed.  Since this happened I read posts on upcoming content.  Usually I just jump in and play.  Looks to me like they are on the right path.  And just perhaps people realizing that this sort of stuff belongs in survival mode.
---
I bought it at full price and play it almost daily, but for a while I regretted it. Now it's getting better and better, so I say yes it is now.
---
You stay stealthed while firing. The explosive bullets fire the same as any other, they obviously just light up whatever you're shooting at.
---
You can see the muzzle flash, but that's the same for any gun.
---
Reading is fundamental.  We were in adventure mode.  Thats the problem
---
Masterfully so.
---
Crossbow is my favorite weapon! I'm on ps4 how much do you want for one??
---
Yeah and then act like its Bethesdas fault you can't run it. Like I have a potato that can't run fallout 4. So you know what I saved and got an xb1.
---
Slightly in the leg, is it left?
---
Did u get in or still queued?
---
#4 I'd appreciate very much, it's a little tedious to do minor changes to keep things on a 90¬∞ with a wall, or a sidewalk.
---
They don‚Äôt want to be in survival mode because the whole goal is to pray on defenseless people who won‚Äôt give them a challenge. The don‚Äôt want to participate in real PVP in which they actually have the chance of dying or losing items. 
---
CAMPs won't be protected in Pacifist mode until one of the coming updates. They didn't say when though I imagine it will be one of the ones for this month.
---
You want your kid to build and have fun? Buy fallout 4, install unlimited resources mods and no build limit mods. Problem solved. What those people did was fucked, but come on it's a multiplayer game people are gonna do what they want. I'm willing to bet had they known it was built by your special needs kid they wouldn't have done it, but how the fuck were they supposed to know that?
---
Thanks bud. 
---
I think the unknown is part of the fun.
---
I'm working for a game developing company, and what we do here for most part is trying to make players feel the  excitement  of the unknown.
---
GARY!!
---
Still going?
---
Costs a lot more than I had. It even wiped me out of wood, and I usually have 500 to 1k of that at all times.  bunch of radioactive because she likes all that neon stuff.  The cost isnt the point.  Why should I have to deal with it at all?  Fortunately it sounds like soon I wont have to.
---
I have great hopes for them all to move out of moms basement and gain some human empathy.  Im a dreamer I suppose.
---
You can have the one I still have for free. It's a furious level(25?), Out of town till tommorow but it's yours if you want it.
---
Game needs an in game report function for bugs
---
I don't care for bolstering and unyielding gear, because I find running around as a bloodied build to be a pain in the ass.  It's not a one-size-fits-all deal.  My high value gear is weightless and "harder to detect while sneaking" equipment, preferably with AG, L and PER boosts.  My other character wears power armor.
---
Server stability is way up. Player base is up although I miss flatwoods being packed. A lot of bugs have been fixed. I use to crash every 30mins now I go days with out one. 
---
Still kill the queen most times and she isn't bugged as much. Loot and workshops have been nerf which is garbage and pvp mode is still beta. I have about 1k hours and honestly love this game. I haven't played this much fallout since 2 and 3. 
---
I've seen her spawn at Quarry X3 just north of Watoga
---
I maxed out ADA in FO4 she was a ABSOLUTE tank she literally had two fatmans one on each of her shoulders
---
One spawns at quarry x3 in the cranberry bog and south of watoga train station just south of the cluster of houses.
---
Yeah we had a long talk, I showed her some of the responses here (granted, heavily curated the selection) and shes all in when the patch goes live to prevent this crap.  I figure I have a bit of time this weekend to get enough junk!
---
Lake eloise has a static spawn.
---
Dense metal mods are much harder to find, but show up occasionally. Padded + Fireproof is pretty good anyway.
---
I disagree, Survival mode is fine (I actually quite enjoy it) and I personally don‚Äôt even rp a raider, but some people just enjoy playing whatever mode they prefer, whether that be because they don‚Äôt like the restricted fast travel, double loss of caps upon death, whatever. It‚Äôs a built in feature, and as long as people aren‚Äôt abusing it or following people from server to server, I really don‚Äôt see a problem. It‚Äôs s wasteland, bad things happen, you gotta adapt.
---
How many do you need? There's one in the quarry above Watoga and another closeby at Mac's Farm
---
Awesome! My psn is laxerunlimited
---
Add me when your home!
---
Speed Demon
---
So I know this is about prices, but I'm worried about location, since I like my camp spot, but it's horrible for vending. And then a thought occurred to me: Will our vending machines be labeled on the map? Cuz you could just temporarily team with the owner and fast travel to their camp, then shop, then unteam. Does anyone see any potential problems that might pop up with this?
---
Cranberry glade, quarry site X3, and sunset fields are all in the cranberry bog and have mirelurk queen spawns.
---
I may have misremembered the exact names of some locations, but I‚Äôm at work so I did the best I could. Good luck 
---
Will do. If they ever add the pipboy app to 76 I could tell you it's exact stats, but that's probably a pipe dream.
---
I mean
---
If you buy a dress, it‚Äôs not magically a pair of jeans
---
You have screen shots of what you‚Äôre going to get
---
If you don‚Äôt like it, don‚Äôt buy it and expect that lovely green dress to materialise into a suit
---
Awesome thanks!! Round 2?
---
Nope done
---
Basicly, when private servers come out
---
Pool que
---
Yeah 31 years playing games online and I think the vast majority are not in the shit category, but the ones who are tend to be louder, more arrogant, and listened to by game companies more.  You wouldn't believe how many timed my masculinity has been rudely challenged in IMs over this story.   Deep down they know they are assholes, and react buy attacking and justifying, just like real life.  
---
While I agree that this is a terrible thing that happened I suggest you use this as an opportunity to teach your kid (not sure how old she is or how impaired she is) too outsmart the bullies in this game its quite easy if another group shows up to flatten the camp get her to store it/ move the entire camp(there may be a mechanic were you cant move the camp when under attack you have too double check that) or log off and show her how to join a different world by clicking on a friend. This is the world we live in not every one is gonna be nice so you should be teaching your kids that.
---
Not only that I‚Äôd suggest you take some self responsibility in this case you let a impaired kid (not sure how young) play a game rated for adults/ adolescents there is a reason online games give the warning: interactions with other players are out of our control.
---
Also sorry if someone has already said this there was too many comments for me to read
---
I'm having the same issue. Somebody recommended increasing my drives page file size. Will let you know if my computer explodes
---
I‚Äôll take them off your hands. Running low!
---
hey there, sorry to read about what happened. sucks that this is allowed to happen to those of us that want nothing to do with PVP. but on the bright side i would like to offer some help. if she still working on the base ive got a bunch of extra plans she can have to expand on the possibilities for the base and ive got a bunch of bulk junk im trying to sell but will gift her to keep her going. 
---
Short answer, no
---
Just because they prefer to be assholes does not mean I have to accept it or stay silent about it.
---
that's not how it works. :o
---
Report to me, sir.
---
I will fix it soon. üòâ
---
I had never encountered Insult Bot until today. I was dropping technical data and he shows up tells me to wait,... Never said anything.
---
Later, I get on again and decide to clear out my treasure maps (got some good stuff) fast travel to the rest stop near Harper's Ferry. 3 scorchedbeasts swoop down and I start downing them. Once I get the last one to land, I'm hacking at her with my Axe and here he comes again. Once I finish the final beast I turn to him, and he tells me to wait again! He's a Legendary Insult Bot. So I bash him too, he drops nothing.
---
Then a glowing Wendigo came from nowhere and killed me. It do be like that sometimes.
---
Good post but you can‚Äôt expect others to know that a child built the base. As for the game. It is a survival game. I think even in adventure mode, there should be some type of pvp. Luckily you can easily rebuild the base. Either with junk or you can place the camp back down for 40 caps, unless you‚Äôre me, apparently mine is 160. Then you place the blueprint back down. 
---
Thank you 
---
I thought page file size is a thing for the Windows XP era, lol.
---
But your computer is safe, and I'll try it out as well.
---
Thanks!
---
.50 has a higher mass than .308, which makes it better for penetrating materiel, like vehicles and emplacements. .308 has a high potential velocity, making it more suitable for penetrating soft stuff like flesh
---
It‚Äôs a survival game the developers even said the players are meant to be the raiders it‚Äôs a part of the game I‚Äôm sorry but wanting them to give up their fun is just as selfish.  
---
I feel awful for your daughter going through that but I mean, it's an online game. If she just wants to build and have fun Fallout 4 is actually better for that. It has way more building options and with mods you can spend basically all of your time building with little to no threat. She should check it out.
---
It's 50% damage resistance reduction, which works out at 29% hp damage.
---
Agreed!  I thought they nailed the atmosphere at launch.  Nights were never pitch black, but got dark enough to add a new level of mystery, danger, and challenge.  As for that annoying inventory glare bug, I can't believe that keeps going unnoticed, patch after patch.  I hope they'll just rollback the lighting changes they made wholesale, and kill 2 birds with one stone :) .
---
I've got it. Ive got most of everything
---
Wish I could use the chainsaw, but as an arborist, I hear one running all day. Can't stand to hear one playing the game as well. 
---
Repairing bases is cheap dude it's not that big of a deal. Fix it. Move servers. Dont get butthurt over others utilizing in game mechanics. Or have her play another game flexing creativity like minecraft little big planet. They did nothing wrong. 
---
I can't believe I had to scroll so far to see this. I mean ffs that is something that happens semi frequently, why would he not expect or prepare for that eventuality? Everybody loves to throw the blame game and villify people but it was probably some dude just blowing shit up, that is what this game was literally built around since fo3. Maybe I'm the only one that remembers New Vegas' message was often that there wasn't a good or bad side, just people doing the best they can with fifty shades of grey inbetween. 
---
All PvP should be restricted to Griefer Island.
---
Sorry for what happened.
---
But maybe this is good chance for your kid to learn that the real world is not always bright and sunny as well.
---
She'll have to learn to protect herself and also a pillar of the community or even society.
---
Also learns that we do not take people's helping hands for granted. (From your edit 2, I think you've got the point.)
---
I'm quite sure taking either one to the head is gonna be a bad time overall. But, does that mean .308 is actually more effective than 50. On people?
---
For some reason my TSE minigun does not show up to vendors since last week. I think it happened after I got another two shot minigun it glitched it.
---
Always..don't leave home without it 
---
lol no problem.  Yeah I learned about it on this reddit a few months back but  every so often I bring it up again because not many people seem aware of it.  Though it does kinda mention it on a loading screen, it's not so "direct" about it lol
---
Every cash shop system does this. Get over it.
---
The fun was all the interactions she had prior to this.  Giving a newbie some of my junk, people sending waves and hearts as they use her stations.  growing crops and deliberately leaving the water purifiers unlocked to provide for the hungry and thirsty.  Besides. whats the point of it regardless of who built it?  Point is these folks treat everyone else as content, not people.  There was no point at all to take down that camp like that, none.  No point in repeatedly killing her as she tried to spawn in.  There was zero reason to do any of it to anyone.  At least in survival, that's the expectation.  Fortunately it seems Bethesda is getting the point and there is a patch coming.  Ill just stockpile junk till it does.    
---
Thank you
---
&gt; **I should have the right to not play with you** 
---
Well no, that's actually not how it works, though I am sad to hear about this, and I hope they do make it so this sort of thing is dissuaded more.
---
Probably tomorrow.  Have to get some more Nuke key cards
---
Thanks for joining.  Was a blast
---
Ya same 
---
Next time, make sure your kid saves her work as a blueprint. That way no matter what, she will have a back up.
---
Yeah the Barrett is kinda a meme gun amongst actual marksmen. It‚Äôs less accurate overall and kinda overkill for humans, but for wasteland creatures like the death claw, it‚Äôs ballistic properties would actually do less damage than something with better soft penetration. Honestly they should have coded in the .50 to have higher armor penetration with the lower damage. That way it‚Äôs more of a choice between taking out heavily armored targets like robots and mirelurks, or killing combatants such as scorched and ghouls
---
I was walking south from the Grafton station to my camp and a miss nanny told me the three little pigs. And the one with the bricks had a mister handy
---
Why not just get a better picture of and have access to more games and siftware.?
---
fallout new vegas comes to mind, vera's dress became dean's suit lol
---
&gt;just because they prefer to be assholes does not mean I have to accept it or be silent about it
---
Not saying you have to be silent, but honestly..I feel as though you should accept it (at least till those new pacifist changes drop) because everyone enjoys games differently man, and the thrill of doing stuff like that might be fun for them, and again, they aren‚Äôt breaking rules, so I‚Äôm not sure what else Beth can really do before it gets rid of a core ‚ÄòSurvival‚Äô aspect, because this is a Survival game, soft core maybe, but it still is. I‚Äôm sorry for what happened to your base, but calling people neckbeard incels just because they don‚Äôt play how you‚Äôd like them to..that‚Äôs kind of an asshole move as well.
---
Most likely the plan 
---
I‚Äôm fairly certain Bethesda stated that you would have to buy it again, but I could be wrong 
---
Calling them the "worst in humanity" is a bit much.
---
Cranberry bog..but if u go out of watog station towards the fields just go straight ahead..but watch out the king is there too
---
That would be depressing...
---
If the people who did this read this post, they'll celebrate.  Those kind of people revel in others misery, that's the point.  Sadly they exist in real life and we share the planet with them and they're not even rare.
---
This spot. I've had run ins with the King  a few times.
---
This happened to my group, they tried destroying my aunts base and were spawn camping us even though we were all in pacifist mode.
---
In the end I told her to server hop so they wouldn‚Äôt destroy everything, but there are A LOT of assholes in this game, way more then nice people in my experiences. Survival mode has helped but there are still a ton of griefers.
---
Make sure she knows to just leave the server if it happens again, so she doesn‚Äôt have to rebuild the whole base because I doubt the shitty community will leave. Stay strong &lt;3
---
He's one of the toughest mofos in the game IMO
---
I stand by my opinion unless provided photographic proof.  Kidding. Point is well made, I should probably not name call.  I apologize to any basement dwelling incels I insulted, genuinely.  But I do stand by the fact that their behavior is assholish and uncalled for.   Just because the game allows you to be a jerk does not mean I have to not infer you are a jerk when you act like one.  I suspect a lot of it is because people just don't think about it.  Thus the post.
---
Alright stop, scroll up, and read again
---
Different message bro
---
I don‚Äôt get why you would want to prevent that though? I know you‚Äôre being a bit sarcastic but they should really add character names it adds to the role play aspect immensely.
---
Bug muscly guy running around in a red dress in the wasteland. It's fine. No churches left to tell him it's a sin.
---
SOMETHING WITH A G!!
---
As are deathclaw hands, baseballs, and mole rat teeth, iirc.
---
People who get their enjoyment out of ruining another person's game don't deserve the same consideration.   So no, I don't agree their play style is just as valid.  
---
I crouch like 90% of the time no matter what. üòÇüòÇ
---
Title Edit: If You're 200+ and You Own a Workshop -- CROUCH (sigh, cant edit titles...)
---
Oh no! A child playing a video game not meant for them?! CALL CPS!! 
---
Seriously tho, I'm 14 and I play this game. Those are guidelines, they have to put them on there
---
Most people can't build one or afford the 400 to 1k for a good PC. with a console you need a TV which most people already have and 200 bucks plus the game which is what $30 now? 
---
U get them from completing up any of the power plants.
---
+karma 
---
~400hrs and I never saw a single one till I tried survival for the first time. Then I got all I needed in one go.
---
Yeah definitely a point.  Still need to cough up the resources.  I do find it fascinating how the reaction of a lot of people is to list workarounds for dealing with crappy people rather than accepting that what they did was crappy and the fact there are things Bethesda can do to keep things fun for everyone.  Its a game, we shouldnt have to deal with bullies and assholes.  Leave that for work.
---
We must use the same kinda ammo lol üòÇ
---
Elaborate? Why should someone high leveled be crouching at a workshop? 
---
Power up poseidon 3 times. It is a guaranteed reward.
---
It actually is, if they limit PVP to the survival server.  Sounds like they are moving that direction anyhow.
---
They die
---
I haven't seen them at any vendor and I'm 148. I can help with the powering up if you are on PS4.  My PSN is lordskorb
---
I‚Äôll Take the 308. If i can
---
Yeah, still not helpful information. Thanks no thanks. Elaborate /more/?
---
Okay all your.
---
Can craft all
---
Go for 250caps each, standard
---
At work for 4hours though
---
Lol I looked at ur other posts because I'm active on market subs..how much did u end up paying for the Mr fuzzy costume?
---
I got called away for a trade with a customer. It‚Äôs cool. Good luck!
---
7k total, why?
---
I think the plan's always at Watoga Station and Harper's Ferry at least. Possibly some of the Ash Heap vendors. 200 caps or so.
---
It's a fairly common bug now, but soon.
---
I encountered a player with one of these bases a the White Springs Golf Club, he was tossing grenades blowing up the cars in the parking lot and shooting at me attempting to start a fight a lure me back to the turret base.
---
The thing is actual raiders want resources - aid items, caps, etc.  They don't get them by wiping out a CAMP and/or killing everyone.
---
The art of being an actual raider is to leave enough for the town to make more stuff for your future raiding.  Which is a big part of "roleplaying" not being an excuse.
---
Nah, if you want to play as a murderhobo you're a piece of shit, full-stop.  Go murder NPCs if you don't want to be a piece of shit.
---
Sheer brilliance.  The Ateam would be proud of such resourcefulness.  
---
Because I had two..the most I paid was 2300 ..I guess real expensive on Xbox 
---
i have a feeling vending weight is gonna count towards stash like fermenter does
---
Yeah, this bothers me A LOT! Never thought my account name would be my character name. Stupidest shit ever. So if course my account name is the first letter of my first and middle name and then my last name which is btw 12 letters long. Ugh. Bethesda disappoints. I really wish it could be changed. 
---
I just tried both Watoga vendors and both Ash Heap vendors and no luck. I'm assuming the plans are called Fusion Generator. No luck yet.
---
XBone actually, though I bought it on PC initially.  Got the Xbox after release.
---
I've only had it happen a coupe times, but I usually dedicate the next 10-20 of my play time to following them around the map, spamming frowny faces, and blocking all of *their* shots/hits.
---
Even with slap damage, Healing mutation and serendipity healed faster than they could damage me.
---
It‚Äôs currently impossible to get without cheating 
---
I really hate that quest. The optional dots kill me. And the quest doesnt seem up as often as it used to be. But I may be forced to. Thanks!
---
They did reply to someone on Twitter that pre-orders and purchases would not transfer over, so there‚Äôs your answer lad 
---
Ok, prolly not on for about an hour, couple of units there I'm interested in. But turning it back on you, what are you needing? God knows I drop a lot of  ammo types. Oh, xbox?
---
No please NOT a skin, make it a whole new weapon.
---
TL;DR: this thread is a great way to arm yourself with bad information. 
---
Want good information? Keep reading. 
---
Disclosure: I‚Äôm a trader on the trading Reddits. 
---
The answer you probably don‚Äôt want, but is the most real answer you‚Äôll get: 
---
1. Whatever your market will bear. That‚Äôs actually not a cop-out answer, just shorthand for a complex one to do with supply and demand, and how changes in these will invalidate any answer anyone here posts as they shift. 
---
2. 
---
Supply is pretty straightforward. 
---
- stuff people end up with like materials 
---
- farmed legendaries (and this changes when, say, Bethesda add L40 dropped item caps on events like uranium fever)
---
- duper inventories (which are hopefully gone now)
---
What makes Demand: 
---
- meta (most effective tactic available) and fad meta rumors (where sometimes rumor spreads about something that isn‚Äôt really meta) that it is meta, demand spikes. 
---
- function. Some items have inherent functional value, like legendaries with one of the two damage avoidance types (partial and full), weight redux, light melee weapons with STR bonus to raise your carry weight, unyielding/CHA or Unyielding/STR legendaries as +4STR or +4CHA items, or even top of class items (handmades, 50 cals) with a 1* bloodied or anti-armor effect that substantially outperform 2/3* weapons with weaker effects. 
---
For such non-common items, (some) people who bother with the math will pay proportionately to the irl time it saves them hunting these down. And many people‚Äôs irl time is more valuable than bargain bin caps prices, so you can liberally charge a lot and you‚Äôd be doing business. 
---
- talking about time saved, materials and some ammo have value too in terms of how much irl time having access to them saves.
---
My 10 characters make me over 11k caps per day selling hats. Doing this requires cloth, which I‚Äôm subsequently prepared to buy in quantity, as that takes less time than cleaning up cigarette packs at sugar grove, sports equipment in grafton and pizza trays at amusement parks, and I can kill queens or run cool experiments in that irl time instead. 
---
Power-leveling mules is also something that lots of people try to do to squeeze their load bearing mules into level-requiring weight redux armor, and give them weight redux perks. 
---
A huge pile of leather and wood for example will allow you to rapidly craft a million boards (as in, the blunt weapon), earning  3-4xp at a time. This can save time leveling to over L10+, and is hence inherently valuable. It‚Äôs a need many people have. 
---
Likewise, check which mats are required to craft and scrap a lot of, say
---
- leather left arms
---
- combat left arms 
---
- trapper left arms 
---
- marine left arms
---
- finally the screw-requiring raider/metal/robot ones. 
---
- radium rifles, whose mods are super material-expensive to learn. 
---
And stock those. People will be able to buy them from you, craft and scrap that type of armor or weapons.
---
These might appeal to broader medium and high level markets. If you‚Äôre serious about useful stock and have a friend list of people who know you stock it, this may actually work well. 
---
3. Finally, understand that when dealing in legendaries, with the exception of the odd AAE handmade, there isn‚Äôt such a thing as ‚Äúa market‚Äù in fallout 76. There are 100 niche markets. Each with a tiny number of uniquely interested people (who are unlikely to be on your server unless they already know you, are friends with you, and purposefully came to visit), and the tiny fraction of them that might be on your server through chance is unlikely to walk into your camp anyway. The per-server player count is just too low. 
---
The main player vending bits I‚Äôd expect to see happening are
---
a. Stuff nobody goes out of their way for, like water and stims. Meh. 
---
b. Materials/ammo in quantity. That‚Äôs the big one I (quietly hope to) see happening. 
---
c. a mild extension of our habit to offload garbage legendaries onto robot vendors or dump them in suitcases, where we‚Äôll hoard the excess 20 and hope some unaware soul buys one or two every so often.
---
d. Maybe, cosmetics collections. 
---
Just remember, just because some people on the internet will insist they‚Äôll never pay more than 500 caps for a 1*‚Äôheavy unyielding piece doesn‚Äôt mean other people who want that piece won‚Äôt carry a higher price.  
---
So asking reddit is, well, a really good way to arm yourself with bad information.
---
My 2 cents. 
---
Okay, so when a player owns a workshop any other player can go to that workshop and initiate PVP. When someone initiates PVP they get caps from the person they kills. I.E. When I see a player over level 200 at their workshop I know I can go to that workshop and quickly initiate PVP before they even know what is going on to get their caps. Yeah I have to spend 30 caps to try and claim their workshop, but I get 200+ caps as soon as I kill them. 
---
You thought your child would do well in a multiplayer post apocalyptic rated M game? 
---
Who are you?
---
Go buy the Sims lmao
---
Only if it let's you do it to everything. Legendary Super Mutant? Send it to the moon. Random loser of a PVP fight? Send then to the moon. Scorched Beast Queen? Send her to the moon. And so on and so on. 
---
Oh wow, yeah I guess so. I know that prices vary throughout, and for some reason xbox seems to always be the most expensive? Not sure why. I usually prefer to let people bid what the thing is worth to them
---
It means they can find you on the map show up at your base and then kill you for caps equal to your level. It a pop ganking system.
---
Well poo.
---
Hey mate, that really fucking sucks. People can be absolute assholes online, I am very aware of this. Dunno if there's anything I can do to help you out, but if you are on Xbox, let us know and I'll shoot you my GT.
---
as an aside, where exactly on the map was the camp built, wasn't near the Charleston train station at all was it?
---
lol. totally misnterpreted that title. 
---
Hey Grimparrot, what platform do you play on.  I get not wanting charity, so how about a companion to run around with collecting junk.   If you are on PC, look me up (Kraag) and I‚Äôll join you on junk runs.   Besides, we are probably close in age and can wax nostalgic about bygone games and help pass the time. 
---
I know, but I'm old and I get lost, and I know they are for sale. So I was trying to pin down the circumstances of the sale conditions. Thanks.
---
Cant buy from vendors. Only drops from powering up energy plant events. 
---
I believe it's to track scorch beasts so that the Free State's lures can force them to land and thus be killed. Aka, the event "It's a trap!".
---
Yes, I understand all of this. What does crouching have to do with any of it?
---
It‚Äôs like the York peppermint patty of illicit alcohol.
---
Good thing there are other games out there. Put her on fo4.
---
You let your special kis alone in fo76, what did you expect
---
Long term PC's are cheaper. You can also use the TV for a display. Larger selection of games and cheaper prices will make the pc pay for itself in no time 
---
I'm on PC but I appreciate the offer.
---
today i was doing stuff around my base when some level 100 player showed up and destroyed all of it and i am usually low on building supplies so i can't rebuild everything i had. i got so pissed off at the guy i had to stop playing for a few hours
---
I guess you could say since negative-one, since I pre-ordered and played all the beta days.  I'm still a bit sour about that, since it went on sale a few times in the timespan after release, and since it'll be on Steam eventually too.
---
Read the description 
---
I'm just curious about this because I rarely if ever run into these sort of issues on PS4 and most people who have negative social interactions seem to be on PC.  But I have no stats to prove it, I could just be one lucky mofo :)
---
Yea, also having trouble on this one. Just got it earlier today and noticed something was up, and followed the different suggestions and combinations in this thread, still nothing. Hey Bethesda, can we get a fix for this one next update? I don't want to be locked out of the rest of Biv's repeatables because this one is broken.
---
Yeah I noticed serums are expensive on there..it's an amazing costume I'd say one of the best in the game..I have a lot of rare ones..I'm gonna get the BOS jumpsuit..but I'm looking for an AAE or BE lever first 
---
It's rare as fuck. 
---
People got it by going to the dev room.
---
The troll-y ones like this do.
---
I‚Äôm all for RPing a raider, but if I was doing it I‚Äôd actually act like a raider. First are threats for caps and mats then if you don‚Äôt give em up you‚Äôll wreck shit/hurt the person. Most raiders don‚Äôt go Nuka-World mode, they‚Äôre just ballsy lol
---
Doesn't sound like it, as your story does not match up. One does not simply bounty up to multiple hundrets of caps, pacifist should keep your character out of fights. The only constellation that would explain the results is 1) Survival or 2) No pacifist mode being in use. My argument stands, one of the mechanics of this game was not used correctly. Your child may have deactivated pacifist mode at one point, which is not a smart thing to do. Changing the lobby would have been a way better reaction.
---
Let me know which ones and ill hold off some for u and yea.
---
If you're not crouching, you'll appear on the map. That means PvPers can fast travel in, start taking the workshop and then kill them. They're normally only interested in the caps, not the workshop.
---
You're safe during a defense event, but you should fast-travel out immediately afterwards, especially if anyone else showed up.
---
You can buy it; my second character did. Its new since the patch that puts more plans at vendors. But it seems to be random. Thanks!
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Brewing_station
---
I take t back I‚Äôm still missing cranberry moonshine but that list is right
---
Bro, I wish someone would role up on me at my workshop or camp or anywhere else. Anyone who attacks me is the one who will become free caps. I'm lvl 200+ and dont crouch almost ever, I want people to try me.
---
I gotcha, I'm gonna be trying to get an AAE gun this weekend. Good luck on your search!
---
Only so long before this turns to GTAO
---
I wouldn't mind something like 'New Moon' events when things get really dark and dangerous like you are describing.  Or an event like "New Moon on Monday" where some special thing pops up on that particular night...  Maybe nocturnal legendary items have buffed stats during the new moon events.
---
U too..thx..it seems ppl want trades tho :( not caps
---
Fantastic area, thanks for the tip.
---
Well, in trades I always just sell things at the default price to save time, and because people seem to randomly drop out of trade all the time and then try to trade again, so it's easier than setting a different price five times.
---
OH, if you crouch then no one can see you on the map. So another player cant see when you're at the workshop to quickly take your caps. If you're crouching then they lose the edge to kill you before you know what's going on.
---
It's really not hard to get atoms.  
---
Besides, if the player wants to spend money on cosmetics let them.
---
I pre-ordered at a discount &amp; 100% agree with /u/notsomething13
---
Also, when you spawn into Charleston Railroad the red barnish house on across the tracks near the pond. Go past that, straight up to the base of the hill is another random event location that can spawn it. I combine this one with the responder vendor bot spawn. 
---
Yes! 
---
You can't see someone on the map if they're crouching.  And if they're nearby, they won't be labelled.
---
Invincible CAMPS in passive are coming :) 
---
I hate how slooooooow the songs are the music puts me to sleep. OH shennandoooaaaahhh
---
Are you being serious?  Moving that direction isn't 'how it is now'. Don't bother replying. What nonsense.
---
You said it best! Lmao
---
Why couldn‚Äôt they have a robotic host 
---
I guess it's so they know the name is unique, and so they don't have to police the names for childish / offensive names - they can rely on Sony to do that for them.  Now we have a 'report player' option, maybe they can change that.  they could always list the display name and account name both in the "Recent" social menu if they think it's important.
---
By the way wtf can't that Recent list be alphabetized..
---
End game players can 1 shot another end game player no matter what now if they know when to shot. It's all about who gets the scoop on the other.
---
5.56 will give me a little breathing space, lead is always going on this ammo. Say 300 of the .45 will be nice without me feeling greedy.
---
You kind of are missing the point.  The real issue isnt the caps or the junk.  I can get that stuff whenever, I don't care.  The fact was these guys were griefing and there is no reason for it.  This is why a lot of us want no part of PVP in this game.  It was so fast I honestly dont know if she turned pacifist on or off, just that it was on when I handed over the controller.  I dont really care, as the destruction of the base happened before she could react at all anyhow.  It was crazy.  Just because someone can do something within the rules and mechanics of a game does not mean it isnt a fucking shitty thing to do, to anyone.  The mechanics need to be changed so those of us who want to play without people pulling this shit have the opportunity to do so.  
---
Never said they couldn‚Äôt haha, just a host would be nice
---
Uh, do you ***have*** any X01 calibrated shocks for sale&gt; I need one. If you're on PC
---
Alright its yours and dont worry it all must go.
---
i got this in about an hour having not used crits before. lol. used a low level pump shotty and 10mm with suppressors to avoid attention. left server when i almost was on leaderboard for time alive, because i had a ton of stims and radaway i couldnt stash, and didnt want to lose.
---
It was actually better during Beta than until several patches after
---
NO!!! IF YOU DONT LIKE IT DONT PLAY ONLINE TYPE GAMES. Go build a settlement in fallout 4!!!!! 
---
Gil? Glenn? I don't know. Something with a G!
---
Lol no I‚Äôm basically asking them, they should of :) I think it would add more life to the game 
---
From your perspective it seems like they were being mean, but like, it‚Äôs fairly cheap to rebuild even the more elaborate CAMPs
---
Hell, if they‚Äôre attacking you can just drop out and reload into a new instance in like 60 seconds. I do this whenever a Scorchbeast attacks my CAMP
---
God damn, I thought I was crazy and masochistic with my habits in game. The level of crazy you have to be to do this though? 
---
Well. Done. 
---
You have that right! ITS CALLED FALLOUT 4 (you know an actual single player game).
---
Johnny guitar is the only slow song I like from the fallout series. I would love if they updated the music. Me myself and my shadow is my favorite song this time around
---
Oh lol, my bad! But I agree
---
Any chance you a have a clip/image?
---
For sure but poor people will never be able to save in the first place. It's an economic thing. Like junk food it's cheap and quick. sure eating like shit is bad and more costly in the long run (health blah blah blah) but it's cheap and available. 
---
You might already have the ability to buy into that where someone on min wage couldn't but and Xbox is obtainable.
---
Yeah griefers aren‚Äôt human, they‚Äôre more like parasitic worms.
---
Crouch and sentinel won't work. Maybe I'm waiting for you...
---
Modus sells it.
---
Minefield of Idiots
---
Has anyone done this on a lowbie? Does it give you a max lvl version? Im loath to bring my high level with her 20k caps and too much junk over there ...
---
Nope. Full Assassins Sentinal with nothing but damage resist perks for every type of damage in the game. Shoot me with anything at all, even bloodied and it won't one shot me. People make the same mistake you would all the time in assuming that. 
---
You are correct, I should anticipate people being assholes.  Same goes for Reddit actually.
---
It's the fact it's armor that gets me (as a PA user) AND probably all one star.  I did get a bloodied \*\*\* gamma gun from a whitesprings \*\*\* legendary yesterday so I can't say I never got anything but armor, but it seems like I get 70% \* junk armor and 25% \* junk weapons and 5% \*\* and \*\*\* armor and weapons (1% of that is a \*\*\* legendary gun usually not what I want or need).
---
I agree was just saying not all raiders are like that I‚Äôve hit only one base my entire play time and I‚Äôm lvl 154..and I often just like to make the game fun and play as a mini boss for people to liven it up..lol but got down voted to hell
---
Yeah, I crashed a day ago when the queen was almost dead.
---
Had anyone else noticed that the original survival picture was vault boy with that one??
---
They did set up a place for these posts and you‚Äôre supposed to report the topic if it is already listed there. Also you can submit repeat topics to retire to it. I‚Äôm not sure how well-known or well-maintained it is though. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/bethesdaplz
---
And you could go play Black Ops, whats your point?  
---
Why not stop hop servers the moment they attacked...
---
I just have one T-60 right now on ps4, sorry
---
There‚Äôs a post yesterday highlighting how the helmets are different and one isn‚Äôt in the game.  Just search for questions. Most likely it‚Äôs been asked 
---
I've seen her spawn south of the Watoga rail station once in a while
---
Yeah i was being a little sarcastic. Would be actually pretty cool to have Char Names. Using a Mic would be making more sense and fun. Imagine a Clan with Ranks n shit or even just a  Preston Garvey walking around asking if he could help defend your Base.
---
You have to be a certain level before the 3rd card shows up. Its frustrating.
---
Ah yes, look I'm sure you're a great guy. And I feel sympathy after reading your story. But in my experience, anyone using the term "murderhobo", seem to be stuck in the 80's gaming era.
---
And P.S. I read the TLDR before I read the actual post and saw you are from the 80's era. Don't pander.
---
As I have been told in my comment on this post, this is apparently impossible or would require Bethesda opening *a whole new department* for names.
---
I, on the other hand, agree they should show character name instead of a username or some combo.
---
If they didn't want us to at least desire our character be known by a different name, they should have never bothered letting us name them in the first place.
---
Well I'm glad you posted it. It needed to be said again. 
---
Sure.  Theres always that guy who asked if we had phones at blizcon.
---
I thought I completed that too but I didn't have the hat on.
---
Welcome to the randomness of the perk card system. Level 145 and still no Strange In Numberz
---
Do they? I havent seen them. But good luck.
---
Totally agree!!
---
\*Switches to gatling plasma\*
---
\*Immediately has to reload\*
---
Ok maybe not TOTALLY agree :/
---
The flux is only avail once every 20 hours..if u picked it..it may show up again but u can't physically pick it up again
---
Unfortunately your well written and thoughtful post will probably not affect the intended audience for a simple reason. 
---
There are many people who get enjoyment out of knowingly making others feel bad.
---
They may not always do so openly in real life where they would have to face the consequences themselves; but, they would if they could, and the internet provides a usually consequence free outlet for these urges. In real life, this behavior is associated with sociopathy and antisocial personality disorder.
---
Anyone who enjoys making others feel bad basically gets enjoyment out of hurting people, so even if it is in a discussion thread or game, I'm genuinely bothered when someone demonstrates such behavior. I don't think it's ok to deliberately hurt others, even if it is only "a little bit" or involves "things you shouldn't get upset about". Griefers simply enjoy causing others to have a negative experience, and justify it no matter what, or simply don't care what the victims feel.
---
Lol. Its is true. You acquire cards from opening packs. Some cards you can only get at certain levels but you still have to get those cards from a pack. 
---
Cards don't magically appear in your inventory, they come from opening the card packs. It's a pretty easy thing to google and find out for yourself
---
Is that a threat? Try me...
---
Wow that blows. I‚Äôm almost 36 so fingers crossed. 
---
The caps you would waste hopping around every work shop would outweigh the reward of killing high level players for caps
---
Although high level players o tend to always have the best loot in my experience.  
---
Wah. They are having a very large price cut before being removed for awhile. It allows new items to join the temporary roster, without oversaturation of the store.
---
you'd still have the ability to rob people on the way to vendors or on the way back to their stash
---
The legendary effect only occurred a very small percentage of the time. That‚Äôs what made it balanced. I believe it was like 5-10% of the time and obviously the player had no choice on when it would occur. 
---
That was on the World Series Bat. 
---
Obviously the external mod weapon Propulso 5000 was non-Lethal and it shot every time (including the player himself if shot at too close range). That weapon was hilariously fun. 
---
That‚Äôs good work. 
---
With one comment - the way statistics work is *not* concluding (as you did) that if you got 8% of this but only 4% of that the game doesn‚Äôt distribute unevenly. 
---
Do that in a study and nobody will publish it. 
---
The way people express these things is, given a sample size, the likelihood of the observed data being due to pure chance. Once that likelihood dips below some agreed conventions, (less than, say, 5% likelihood), people are prepared to assume the alternative explanation (in this case, deliberately uneven distribution or distribution based on other factors such as what you‚Äôre carrying). 
---
Well, that's certainly one way to get the Protectrons back over to Big Town.
---
Forget that,  I want to make bots for my camp! 
---
First and foremost, you shouldn't be playing an online PvP game to build things with a child.....
---
Fallout4 is offline.
---
Could be special need for that halfass jackass essay you wrote.
---
Ok thank you
---
&gt;Not only that I‚Äôd suggest you take some self responsibility
---
The person explained that they understand how the game works and that they were under the mistaken impression that camps couldn't be damaged.
---
Maybe try reading?
---
Ballistic fiber
---
Also this! They already have the functionality for the other perks though so should be an easy add
---
I stopped playing 76 for a bit a while ago when one night I get online and I spawn at the ammunition‚Äôs factory, and lo and behold I start to just keep getting killed over and over by a guy three times my level. And this was before they removed the op exploding bullets guns. 
---
I run a shotgun crit build. My challenge was done in like 3 minutes lol.
---
Sure I can make it at my camp real quick. You need the advanced power connectors 
---
While I understand the whole ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a game mechanic‚Äù thing to an extent, this is a really good example of why it‚Äôs actually more than that. 
---
People‚Äôs relationship to their CAMPs isn‚Äôt entirely logical. We spend a lot of time and effort putting them together. It‚Äôs a creative outlet that in many cases is a real personal expression.  Being able to see people come through and react positively is extremely rewarding. You can‚Äôt get that in Fallout 4. 
---
I‚Äôm a grown, rational adult, and fortunately my CAMP hasn‚Äôt been griefed more than a couple of times. One time I was standing right there watching. I know it‚Äôs just a game, I know I can fix it easily, I know I can jump servers‚Äînone of that mattered in that moment. 
---
It just felt shitty. 
---
It just seems like an unnecessary mechanic at this point. Let the craziness reign free in Survival. Put a lid on it in Adventure. Let people have the fun they want. 
---
No nuke zones?  
---
Point was to get people to think about the fact that the person they are griefing is a person.  This time it was a kid who was joyfully sharing junk at the cool little camp she built.  Could be anyone.  Griefers never think about the people they are griefing, they just treat people as content to be consumed.  Its a pretty terrible thing to be.  You can think what you want about my parenting, but you are defending the actions of a group of high level guys who specifically geared themselves to trash peoples work and slaughter them repeatedly if they can.  Bethesda can, and has scheduled for a patch, do something to fix this.  Remove the ability of griefers to attack camps.  That alone, if we stay in pacifist mode so they cant actually damage us unless we react, would do it.  Id prefer a game mode that completely removed PvP, and I bet when they see the numbers of people who want that, itll happen.  We out number and outspend griefers.
---
Considering my players name is Dixon Balls, I fully support this
---
I‚Äôm a murder hobo that only breaks fusion generators 
---
Took me 52 TD between Paladin (which I got on Sunday) and Elder (which I just got).  Trying to decide which paint I like better.  The Paladin is both darker and has more red than the Elder (and the sword symbol is cool) while the Elder is a matte grey and the distressing and the wear shows a little more.
---
Also weird that Elder is labeled VII when Paladin was labeled V.  Officer was unlabeled so assuming it's 6 and they just labeled them out of order.
---
Are you playing on console? You can block individual users on PS4 and XB1, that way they can never search you out and join your game. (You‚Äôll always appear offline)
---
[Try this - tells you what level you can get what](https://nukesdragons.com/) 
---
Puns on cue 
---
&gt;Of course, you can always store them on another character.
---
And this is different from having a safe... how exactly? 
---
Just because someone wants to play a ROLE PLAYING game in a way that is at odds with you doesn't give you the right to call them names and insult them.
---
I have never and don't ever plan on attacking other peoples camps, especially for no reason. But I don't think you have the right to make sweeping accusations about a certain part of the community just because you had a bad time.
---
Tbh, something happened to Bethesda a few years ago. Never been the same since.  They don‚Äôt think things through that all anymore.
---
Hey if your on ps4, my wife and I would be happy to help build a place with you. 
---
My husband and I use the same account but have different characters, so it sucks when our friends can‚Äôt tell who is who.
---
Could at least allow us to flag how we see it.  Gamertag, character name, charater name and gamertag under it.  Its not hard.
---
Ultimately this is a mp creative ish game and people are free to play as they want but the game sorely needs different server types, ie pvp pve servers were you can‚Äôt destroy others things etc
---
It's even more than that though.  I played survival for a while. I won more  fights than I lost but still came out with fewer caps than I had going in. 
---
The whole system is just a mess. 
---
More and more, I'm begining to think that Bethesda is actually Vault Tec in disguise, and FO76 is a simulation for experimentaions on humanity, and we are the guinea pigs.
---
Will they work with each other? Will they kill each other and eventually all leave the game (just like how there are no NPC persons left)?
---
Or will everyone just stop nuking and let the Earth heal?
---
I see 2 at the freak show every time I have pass it.
---
Yikes.  This made me laugh as well lol.  Look who can‚Äôt read. They were in Pacifist, also not in Survival.
---
Holy shit. I have to be level 40 to get the third level? The loot from inside Grafton damn better be worth it. 
---
Holy yikes you don‚Äôt belong anywhere NEAR games or the internet.
---
I do. Chameleon mutation. Easy to fix.
---
I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs a fitting game though if they end up crying over it. Any multiplayer game is going to have shitty people griefing. Kids can be mature but not all of them are mature enough. A single player building game like Minecraft would probably be better or one where PVP isn‚Äôt involved.

Don‚Äôt get your hopes up
---
Generally locked things are filled with crap
---
I'll have to figure out how to join the faction. My main did it when teaming with my friends and I just followed along blindly. Now they've all left the game and I dont remember how you start it. I'll search online. But anyway thanks for the info!
---
Oh... my god.
---
Where in gods creation.. 
---
I want it. LOL.
---
Yeah- that happened to me too. It was at the Poseidon power plant workshop. Sheepsquatches were said to be invading, but it was a pack of Wild Mongrels when I jumped back there.
---
Similar experience awhile back with my young son. He got wiped out and I was furious.  Nothing worse than that feeling. 
---
I‚Äôd love to buy some. Do you charge materials as well or just caps?
---
If you are on PS4 I would love to be able to help you with anything you need. We aren‚Äôt all assholes. 
---
But but, I hate crouching...so bad for my posture...good thing I'm only level 194. :P
---
If you're on PC I'll donate mats and time to help protect your girls stuff if you wanna rebuild.
---
I enjoy single player that doesn‚Äôt mean every game should be single player. There are plenty of building games where you can build without worrying about others destroying it. No one is going to stop killing other players and such because a special needs kid is playing a game they shouldn‚Äôt be.
---
If your heading east on the main road past red rocket mega stop toward the mire not long on the right of the road I always see a mirelurk queen from the road
---
Hopefully Bethesdas solution will fix it.  
---
yea, kinda lame, I mean, I've gotten some mixed recipes that require another recipe to brew, which i don't have..
---
Lol. Makes so much sense, boo hoo my I let my kid play an M-Rated RPG and got their feelings hurt. That shit is crazy. But it's reddit, if you pander to the crowd you get positive results.
---
This is why I play on pacifist. This is also why I constantly crouch at my camp. Thankfully, you can simply repair structures, as opposed to completely redesigning every time the azshat griefers come around; granted, it costs junk...lots of junk...but the design is preserved.
---
Not entirely related but wearing a Gas Mask and a Combat Armor Helmet gives you headgear similar to it - and if you have the Combat Armor Helmet painted in BOS colors it almost looks like the real thing!
---
Dude. Periods. 
---
Currently rocking a clean army helmet and gas mask (no goggles). Might give that look a go. Thanks
---
Glad to hear it, and best of luck with the supplies gathering! Good call on the curation too, especially considering how vulgar some fucking people can get.
---
I'm sure you're sick of the "it's a feature of the game" or "go play casual farmgame whatever".  In that vein of thinking, you can use me as a particular "in game feature" to benefit your daughter's architectural interests.  I work as a freelance illustrator, so all of my work is done at home and I'm usually in game by 3-4pm EST.
---
I play a lvl 171 [sniper](https://imgur.com/Y7x8oO3) minoring in VATS criticals with very high P/A/L scores and some [Pretty](https://imgur.com/IekuuUx) [Damn](https://imgur.com/0qijS48) [Ferocious](https://imgur.com/M1R9vQ3) [Rifles](https://imgur.com/WCFJRia).  PvP is kinda lame to me, but I'm pretty confident I can ruin just about anyone's day in Appalachia if I was inclined to do so.  
---
I might very well be inclined to help out a cool Dad with a sweet kid that just wants to have fun making a house.  I've got almost every camp plan, and she's more than welcome to instruct me where to build some Fasnacht garlands or put the fusion generator.
---
My gamertag is Shankwell.  I really hope you're on PC so I can help make sure it doesn't happen again.
---
Dude get the fuck over it 
---
Yeah as I typed that I realized my foolishness. 
---
I certainly do, if their enjoyment is at the expense of mine.  I enjoy roleplay.  Lets look at your assertion in another context...what if you are in a park enjoying a picnic.  There is a group in the park live action roleplaying.  Thats great, they have that right.  Then they run through your picnic and smack you with their foam sword.  I think we would be OK calling them  assholes at that point.  I am not making sweeping generalizations, I am talking about people deliberately engaging in PVP activity to ruin someone elses fun.  Most PVPers dont do that.  You are the one making generalizations if you think that legitimate PVPers in this game gun down peoples camps and spawncamp them till they log off.
---
Junkie build
---
Basically anything with Swing Speed. Bloodied is probably the most sought after, but Furious or AA are good too. +1 Strength is also a plus on this type of weapon.
---
Just bulked a ton of junk. Was running between Watoga Train station to the BoS Phoenix and saw a legendary robot. Busted out the explosive Gatling and a grognaks bloodied 214 ran up and smacked it from around the corner. Of course my ranged explosive hit him and he immediately turns and kills me. Loots all my junk and then runs off. üôÑ Thanks Bethesda. 
---
I've gotten so much purified water and stimpaks from events, I rarely visit my purifiers in my CAMP anymore...and I end up giving some away in suitcases and Overseer's caches or selling it to vendors if I wanna clean them out.
---
How many points do you have in endurance?
---
This is a good and bad solution until they make it impossible for people to put their camp right outside the golf.
---
Praise Howard.
---
Really? Only survival mode first? Wow they‚Äôre really trying to force us to play that aren‚Äôt they, I‚Äôll pas 
---
XBone.  I anticipate the griefing will amp up now, judging from my inbox.
---
I suspected this but haven‚Äôt done any testing. Thanks for letting us know! 
---
Mine looks this way as well
---
Correct.  So.   Just don't do it again.  You need to learn from your mistakes.  You shouldn't really leave any kid unsupervised in an online game if you know they don't have the maturity or mental capacity to deal with others.  You should also note that there are people being murdered in the world as we speak, how can you hope to change human nature with this post? Hope for the best but plan for the worst.  I'm just saying.  Everyone makes mistakes but this type of post is guaranteed to get more upvotes than downvotes on this subreddit (as I'm sure you knew) and I question your motives a bit for posting it. But fine.
---
The joy of it was building stuff for others to use.  Some people just prefer playing cooperatively.  I dont hold it against people who prefer PVP, but we have survival mode now.  Just leave me out of it.  Sounds like that will be a option soon.  Wasnt aware of that at time of post.
---
Hey you seem knowlegadable and I was wondering. Earlier before the survival beta a low level player in like the 30's kept hitting me trying to get my to fight him back. I am level 90 and was pretty sure I would just 1 hit him so I ignored. Then finally after he followed me for a while I turned around and hit him one time and it all reflected and killed me. Is this possible with pre-level 50 gear and perks? 
---
No such thing as a "good" hybrid build. Be a master of one, and use the other weapon type as a no perk backup.
---
Can you survive in the wasteland? Sure. I've done a build with no weapon perks at all. The game is what you make of it ultimately, but later content is going to be very rough for you.
---
Butt brothers ;)
---
WOW This can be super useful in survival mode! Just realized that
---
Stop being a child.
---
Its really hard to get their tags down in the moment.  I have a notepad handy for if it happens again.  Griefers in this game are pretty good at it.
---
I just made 1600+ caps defending the munitions for a couple hours. Feel free to try dudebro.
---
I admit, I could listen to that mad Super Mutant ramble for hours without getting tired of it. There's just something about the cadence of his voice and the simple madness of what he's saying that's soothing.
---
Yeah, found that out the hard way.  Thanks
---
Why the hell haven't they fixed that yet?  It's not possible that they haven't heard people complaining about it.   And I don't see how they could possibly not see that it's a problem. 
---
The thing is actual raiders don't want to slaughter everyone.  They want gear.  Aid items.  Food.  And so on.
---
That's why actual raiders made sure to leave enough of the town standing so that the townsfolk could rebuild...and be raided again.
---
"I'm gonna slaughter everyone and destroy all camps" isn't RPing a raider.
---
Np, I‚Äôve replicated it many times on purpose. Just be careful! It sucks to lose all your work.
---
Yes. If he was in PA someone above lvl 50 could have put reflective plates on his lower level armor.
---
I feel you.  This would make me so mad if I came back to my kiddos getting wrecked like this Hindsight is 20 20 and all that but tell her if anyone ever comes over and starts shooting breaking stuff or whatever, just log out immediately.  They won‚Äôt have much time to grief...
---
So you're upset because you can't just spam the fire button and actually need to be strategic? 
---
The dick duo. XD
---
I may or may not make use of this report function often :P but it's only for things having been suggested a ton of times before.  Such as " Bethesda plz make new characters for survival only"
---
I am back with another farming location for you all!  
---
The Flooded Trainyard in the Cranberry bog. 
---
Directly ahead and to your left of the fast-travel spawn point is a metal shed. Inside said shed is a lvl 3 safe, and a plan spawn by the armor workbench. It's a great, easy place to farm for plans. Enjoy!
---
Obviously anecdotal too, but I've not had any interactions I'd consider "assholes" on PC, but keep hearing complaints from console players, mostly XBox.
---
What? Where did I say anything like that? You aren't even making an arguement. Nice strawman you got there bud, did you build it with raizorgrain or just corn husks? 
---
FYI, if you get your hands on a copy of Fallout 4, even without mods you can let your child go wild crafting in a fairly similar system without anyone else around, and access to everything at once. With console commands you can instantly get all the supplies you need to build
---
There's even a mod that brings the CAMP system into FO4, takes away build limits...you can build some cool stuff in FO4. Just figured I'd suggest it if she really likes crafting in that style of game.
---
I found a Vampire and a  Two Shot one recently...first 2 legendary crossbows I've ever seen as well... I find the vampire one kinda ironic...I'd really like to throw some mods on them....especially a reflex sight, because the default one is horrible.
---
The implication that you can reliably buy AC armor for caps is adorable. 
---
Why thank you. :)
---
Finished it in ten minutes.  Shotgun crit nerf incoming lol
---
How are you going to be able to get enough purified water for that?
---
Actually, you can. About half the time they are sold for caps on the two main market subs. The other half is typically asking for other similar pieces. That's good, I guess, but it's still stupid how expensive it is.
---
I‚Äôve noticed that sometimes my speed demon and my stabilized gauntlet mod doesn‚Äôt work
---
So giant cave crickets may become a real thing? Ick! 
---
Just move your camp and pay the caps.  It's rare.  Please don't make them take every bit of Fallout personality the game has away by nerfing all damage in Adventure.
---
I hope this includes a base limit increase otherwise this update wont do much for my maxed out camp..
---
Reading.  Try it sometime.  Especially the part where she really liked that other people could use the CAMP.
---
Agreed.  My inbox proves it. Lots of pissed off griefers telling me to do anatomically unlikely things.   And I hesitated before I wrote the post.  Im sure some of these folks will look me up and harass me in game.  Its just that when the rest of us, who enjoy helping others more than hurting them fail to say anything, something is lost.  Check my post history, I dont really bitch about much.  Ill not really post on this again either.  Just wanted to share what in the larger scheme of things, was a small sucky experience in the hopes that one of these people just pause and self reflect a bit.  And maybe try taking it to survival if they are feeling murderhoboey or seeing if they can have fun, I dont know, being nice to people.   To the credit of the community I should note there is around a 2:1 ratio of messages of support in my inbox to ones telling me what to do with myself.
---
I know it's what I'd always do to legendary ghouls in F4. Oh, you're regenerating your health, fat lot of good that'll do you with no legs.
---
Yeah you go in and say 
---
‚ÄúGimmie your Tatos! And Med-X!
---
And break a wall or something, then demand it again. If they refuse you break something else until they
---
A.) Give you what you want. 
---
B.) Leave you with nothing and take what they can anyway
---
C.)You fight back and either lose everything or push them off, unfortunately with fast travel and respawn mechanics they can just keep coming, unless they are actually RPing in good faith
---
Just jumping into a camp and trashing it for no reason isn‚Äôt being a raider, it‚Äôs being an Orc, and we already have those around thanks to FEV.
---
It's so of you have multiple characters you know which one is which. 
---
I normally sell things for their value if I just want it get rid of it but if it's something good I'll sell it for 150% value so anything has a value of 200 caps I sell for 300.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76Guides/comments/az6gt2/how_i_farm_stimpacks/?st=JU22UQ5E&amp;sh=6c025810   
---
Is how I farm stimpacks. I have gotten over 200 in a ~3-5 hour play session. But to make the most of this method you need to be lvl 5 with super duper and chemist. 
---
Either that or a flat reduction in decorative object budget cost along with a max limit of like... 250 items.
---
My budget is also maxed out T-T
---
Pop a small guns bobble and a small guns magazine, Ballistic Bock, and Overdrive next time you go fight the Queen with your bloodied rifle build. Watch her melt like ice cream in an oven. ;)
---
I don‚Äôt buy the whole game lets me do it argument. Fallout 1 &amp; 2 gave you the choice of being able to murder children. You even got a title for it.
---
Are these players arguing that if the game lets me do it, then it‚Äôs ok??!
---
In a single player game where the only witness is yourself and all you have to deal with is your own conscience then yeah the argument has merit. 
---
But in multiplayer, where others are effected the argument is null and void.
---
Yes the game lets you have the option. But that surely has a consequence. Just like real life.
---
The only difference in Fallout 76 is that the main consequence of going to gaol isn‚Äôt an option. But all the rest should be.
---
They need to install a Karma system. That if you run around murdering, assaulting and or destroying other players property you get flagged. The worse your karma the worse the game treats you.
---
Your luck goes down, you become diseased more often. Your random encounters are more frustrating.
---
Your rng for legendaries is rubbish.
---
And your camp is visible for all players on the map. As a big red target with no consequences for others destroying it. 
---
And thats the problem.  When you go from single player to multi you should really start treating people like people not the mobs you slaughtered in FO3.  Its different.  I was hoping this post would help someone reflect and see that.
---
And you don't have to do it. haha
---
Pacufist mode does not prevent you from taking damage.
---
That would be a near perfect system for it
---
Have fun!
---
The chameleon deathclaws and deathskull radscorpions are a thing it's just that the variants are high level and rare
---
Nah dude, you're analogy is so far off. It would only make sense if I was part of the Live action role play, and having a picnic with AS part of the live action role play. Then if someone came and messed up my picnic, I would be upset, but it would be within the spirit of the LARP. 
---
But, if I am having a picnic and have NOTHING to do with the live action role play and they come mess my picnic up, hell yes we will have words. Come on, you're an "80's gamer" surely you're smart enough to understand that, good try though.
---
I still stand behind my comment that you have no right to call people names and sling insults just because their game-play is at odds with yours. Sure it sucks and is annoying, but it is part of the game that you play and part of the game you allowed your child to play and you knew that from day one, you said so yourself.
---
Server hop is only way to end ownership.
---
LOL.  Hopefully they'll grow out of it eventually.  PvP to me is for the 13-21 year old crowd, where they have all this testosterone and don't know what to do with it.  When was the last time you heard a "PvP lord" talk and imagined that they were man enough to grow anything better than a crustache?
---
I know your are but what am I?
---
Another great location! Thank you!
---
I haven't spent one penny.  I've bought stuff from atoms I got from grinding.  I would be more inclined to spend real world money, however, if the prices were more in line with Fallout 4's creation club. 
---
As is, the Atom shop items are way too expensive.
---
Pacifism?
---
I‚Äôve had super mutants spawn inside my camp while I‚Äôm there. It‚Äôs just plain awkward. Do I offer them a beverage or shoot them in the head?
---
I guess not. But I'll be sure to add that now. Good point. 
---
If you're on Xbox I'd like to help... 
---
Agreed.  I think its OK though to point out that you are being an asshole if you engage in asshole like behavior, even if the mechanics allow for it.  
---
The squeaky (in more ways than one) wheel gets the grease.
---
Sorry to hear :(
---
Im on Xbox.  Always glad for friends but value companionship over junk.  
---
F T_T
---
Stimpaks recipe is in Whitesprings bunker at the medical bay.
---
You're saying that you can cripple your own limbs via splash damage correct? Unless I misunderstand that just means you need to avoid your own splash damage, hence be more strategic and not just spam your shotty . 
---
Nonsense?  So I should be forced to interact with griefers then?  OK....
---
Touche'... I mean tooshie'
---
I actually would be intrested in such a service. I hope you have gatling gun mods (too cheap to buy the plan at Watoga) or MG42 mods available.
---
Very few after changing build, I think 3 now but I had 5 in it until i changed
---
Heavy metal armor has the highest physical resistance, and most dangerous enemies deal only physical damage. Heavy combat armor is balanced physical and energy resistance, but about 10% less physical resistance than heavy metal armor, but much more energy resistance. Leather has the highest energy resistance, and decent physical resistance. Trapper armor is crap, and has very low durability, even at high levels. Marine armor has lower resistances than the heavy armor, but having a marine chest piece or a few pieces is good to get some rad resistance without the lead-lined mod or legendary effects. Robot is just worse marine armor. It‚Äôs also important to consider legendary effects. Vanguard, bolstering and mutants are good defensive boosts. Unyielding is only good if you have a bloodied weapon/ melee weapon, otherwise is good for raising charisma. Find whatever armor suits you, and use it.
---
PVP or PVE? 
---
Let's just get an automatron update 
---
So these people griefing a pixel house with no knowledge of your daughters situation are as bad as child rapists and murderers?
---
It's not like you can expect those people to know that their raiding upsets your kid so much.
---
I never seen a Chameleon Deathclaw in game but someone told me they tamed one so I found it hard to believe.I think I saw a Deathskull Radscorpion but I might've been thinking of Fallout 4, so I wasn't to sure. Thanks for the info though, I'll keep an eye out for them.
---
I had a beast of a low level war drum leveling it up. Made it from like level 15 or something all the way to 50 where I finally got All Rise. 
---
Your model looks fucking awesome.
---
I bought the White Shag carpet and it is not adapted for sex at all.  False advertising, I mean it says shag right in the name.
---
Anything here catch your eye? https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bg2YQpmtqAqU3bJRb9r1OQn2sjolrh8dxfQZyn8MBik
---
Is it such a big deal to move servers and repair everything? That‚Äôs pretty much executing the option to not play with those guys.
---
Just a classic bookshelf door would be good
---
They'll both randomly spawn at whitesprings if youre5 over level 50
---
Also happy to share rare materials, caps, whatever.  Not as a charity, but as a gift to encourage a budding artist with a calling to become an architect or interior designer.
---
I am cool with any mechanic which means I can do zero damage to anyone and their stuff, and they can do zero damage to me.  I am totally ok with leaving the mechanic of going aggro when taking over public workshops alone, cause I can choose to not do that.  
---
1st. It's a shotgun meant for close range so you are gonna get hit with splash damage, especially indoors. 2nd I'm saying that the perk should affect the bullets not the AOE which is seperate. 3rd it's a fucking double barrel dude. Not exactly like I could "spam" it even if I wanted to. You are obviously salty because you've been destroyed by shottys and aren't good enough to counter them so to make yourself feel better you say "they just spam without aiming! No skill!". Move along dude...
---
One will usually spawn at heart of the swamp
---
I also want to teach her that when someone does something wrong, its OK to call them out on it.  Even if it was within the rules.
---
Yeah, I kinda just wanted this confused rambling lone scorched to be on his way, like ‚Äúhey guy, whatcha doin? Wanna go outside maybe?‚Äù
---
And for the outside part of the wall to have the keypad not the inside part
---
All I can say is yes
---
That would be cool also.  I would like both of them for my camp.  The bookshelf type one for my panic room (aka my afk area and emergency power armor area) and the plain wall for my turret access.
---
Ahh well my housemate's an xbox player and he's a jerk so it must be true xD
---
I'm lvl 90 so I whenever I go there i will definitely have a look around. Is the Mythic variant in game?
---
What they did was pure griefing.   I'm hardly butthurt.  I think its OK for me to advocate for better mechanics and call out this behavior as selfish and assholish.  Just because you CAN do something does not mean you OUGHT to.  
---
It's bootiful. 
---
I don't think so, I just randomly find new enemies as I'll hike around whitesprings for hours looking for new guns to play with
---
Sorry, I just saw this after I announced it as a location I use! Good find, although I generally only visit the shack by the fast-travel point since going into the trainyard proper for just one safe and having to dodge radiation barrels and fight mole miners doesn't seem worth it to me. :)
---
They would be a spin of of the Sound of Music.
---
We should take a poll, how many people want these type of interactions in adventure mode?  I'm guessing it's a very low number.  
---
Or, if you want to move your camp for free...
---
Honestly, Im pretty lucky too.  I think what set me off is she was having this AMAZING time.  It was like watching someone piss on someones birthday cake just because they could.
---
Bethesda should make it so survival is a punish server. If players get too low of a reputation they have to do their time on there haha.
---
I used to ask myself if such people really have nothing better to do with their time than to do things like write someone nasty messages. I have to conclude that they really must get some kind of significant enjoyment or reward out of it.
---
If I don't like someone's post, I generally ignore it, occasionally downvote, and periodically offer a contrary opinion, but in a reasoned and respectful way (I hope). I definitely don't send private messages to those I disagree with for the purpose of spreading misery, and I can't relate to that urge. Still, they must enjoy it somehow.
---
Sorry to hear that you are experiencing that.
---
It does now it was added with survival mode update.
---
Im on xone now, I started on PC, went to xbox because a 55" 4k tv and lazyboy is way better than a computer when you do IT for a living.
---
Better yet just fix the billing situation by actually reducing the weight when we bulk.  
---
That would be nice. 
---
Guilty.  :-)
---
Same mate, i really want it to! Would go so well with loads of armor!
---
I want one pretty badly can anyone make me one?
---
Vanguards is pretty good unless you're a bloodied build
---
Can anyone make me one?
---
Sorry I need tse rifles but thanks for the offer and taking your time
---
Then I want that one added.
---
I think I'll come back for a few days just to sell everything like my nuka colas, super stimpacks, all legendary weapons and armor all for the same price.
---
Tree-Fiddy!
---
Agree totally.  Im too old for murderhobo, I need a care bear server.
---
Is anyone able to make me one of these?
---
I am a parent and have a thought about this. 
---
You might want to play Minecraft or a different more appropriate game. The game you choose to play is a post apocalypse survival game.
---
 How do you know that players who destroyed her place are some other kids who don't really understand what they are doing or how it would make someone else feel?
---
YOU set her up for this. YOU are the one who let her play an online video game. YOU knew her maturity level and let her play a  "M" rated game. If you had ever played an online game, YOU know what to expect from other players. 
---
Shame on you for being too weak to tell your daughter NO and asking the world to change for you. 
---
Anyone have one I could have?
---
This story is the perfect case of unironic "Don't blame the player, blame the game". I don't own F76 nor do I care about playing it, but shit, the game is made a certain way as OP stated where griefing is encouraged.
---
Don't expect a game like this one to have players that go around giving 2 shits about who they are raiding.
---
(Didn't this game have a bunch of people running around "killing gays" ?)
---
It sucks and OP has my (and clearly a bunch of other people's) moral support. Just don't expect to keep playing and not getting griefed again.
---
F76 needs to add private servers ASAP.
---
Good to know. I  lost my foundation base because of this. 
---
Thank you! üíñüíã
---
Because Bethesda slapped together fallout 76 without giving much thought to it. 
---
I agree that be a nice touch. No mans sky has an interesting weather alert system and need for proper gear or to be inside to avoid taking too much damage. Obviously it be a bit more annoying in a game where you are in one region but its something to build off of. Id like to see the weather change with the time so basically if they had seasons it could work well.
---
Am neighbour, can confirm story is true. Not sure how I could verify it, maybe a screenshot? Otherwise, you'll just have to take my word for it.
---
My first thought when I opened my letterbox, was "hmm, must have just lent me his copy, I'll blow the dust off the Xbox and fire it up after dinner", then after chatting to him he pointed out it was a brand new sealed copy. I inhaled my dinner and started the update, keen as a bean to play, but alas 60gb downloaded meant I couldn't play till the next day.
---
Fast forward past a super slow dragging day at work, I finally had the time to fire it up. "Wow" was the only way I could describe it, I was pretty hooked from the start, the intro, the character creation and the introduction of Vault 76, before I had left the vault, I was already thinking of the backstory of my character. A battle harden used car salesman ready to take on the world!
---
Then, I met another player, a complete stranger I've never met before. He sent a message to me, all it said was "do you want power armour". My first thought was, "here we go, someone is gunna lure me and I'm gunna lose my very limited inventory". But no, out the front of the vault, there he was, power armour (it was just the chassis, but hey, a complete stranger helping out a brand new player to the game) out and ready for me to take, we then spent the next hour or so exploring the wasteland, all from 5 words. No voice chat, just plain text and the ingame emotes.
---
Honestly, from this legend of a friend gifting me the game (I had to buy gold myself, so maybe he isn't THAT great of a friend! :P) and this complete stranger who gave me a power armour chassis, I am so blown away by this game. Thanks again mate, and cya all in the wasteland!
---
I think thats part of the problem.  Its half assed all around.  Its not a particularly good survival game, there are lots of better ones.  God knows there are better PVP games.  It could be an amazing co-op experience but this shit happens.  Its almost like they were going for a battle royale with enough Fallout to keep the old fans buying.  We need to keep the animals in seperate pens.  Different game modes can solve for that. These guys though, were just shitty griefers.
---
Not OP, but what are you looking to get for the 3 star Furious Ski Sword?  I don't have much for caps but I have a ton of legendaries stashed.  Give me an idea what you're looking for and maybe we can work a swap.
---
I want heavy wood armor so I can be a tree
---
Luckily, both of those sites are useless rags.
---
Ballistic bock is _amazing_ but it's also so cheap to produce resource wise I don't see it going for much. 
---
If you‚Äôre on PS4 (don‚Äôt know about Xbox) make a video clip with the share button and then fast forward to the names. It‚Äôs easier than trying to get names midcombat. 
---
This, fucking this! This is the sole reason I'm glad they're going to make it impossible to damage C.A.M.P.s! I honestly hate these players who go 4v1, with bloodied, furious, two shot, and power armor builds, and kill people a fraction of their level. Like, what's the point?!
---
It's almost like Bethesda slapped together fallout 76 without giving much thought to it. 
---
It happen to my friends too, and frequently. Probably they'll fix it. Becouse at start we think is a specific problem about 1 guy. But no
---
I don't think 76 has the ability to ragdoll live targets, considering pain train now just deals flat damage even at max rank, but I could be wrong
---
Except the players made the conscious decision to destroy this camp. You‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs not their fault because the game allows for it to happen? There‚Äôs a lot of things people can ‚Äútechnically‚Äù do that they shouldn‚Äôt do because it‚Äôs morally wrong. While private servers would be a good addition, it doesn‚Äôt lift the blame off the individuals who purposely grief like this.   
---
She has watched me do that for years.  Im a big FO fan.  What got her interested was other people visiting.  When she figured out she could give out "goodie bags" with food she grew, water or junk it was a lights on moment.  To be fair, Im the same way.  I prefer to work together with the random people I find at a event or what have you.  Its not just about building a camp, its building one someone else can enjoy thats the draw.
---
^^ this
---
I wonder what that does to that greasy grafton monster?
---
You genius, upvoting for visibility
---
I am so sorry that happened to your kid.  I hate how some people think the fun is in making other people miserable. To be fair this game seems to have a lot less of those assholes but unfortunately that doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt still around.  And sadly griefers are more going to like messing with the people who don‚Äôt want to be murderhobos cause their enjoyment is making people miserable. They don‚Äôt want a challenge, they like the power trip that they‚Äôre making some one unhappy and that person can‚Äôt do anything about it. As you said  they see other players as their entertainment and they don‚Äôt care about the other person‚Äôs feelings, in fact they like imagining how pissed they got you. 
---
If I had my way those people would be permabanned from online games. 
---
It's just a game though. Should be teaching her that its a game and she shouldn't be emotional because her virtual camp was torn down. 
---
Correct me if I am wrong but I am pretty sure at least on PS4 in Elder Scrolls Online you have the option to view PSN handle or Character Names. I am pretty sure of that at least, I could be wrong though and it may be in a different game on PS4 but I do remember having option at least in a game. 
---
I like the idea of co-op but I also think the allure of this game is the fact that you are always at risk. I look forward to playing survival mode once it's out of beta and has the bugs worked out.
---
All of the junk you listed can be sold individually; they have selling value unbulked. Bulking certainly isn't for reducing the overall weight, so as it is there isn't that much reason to need to add bulking for those things.
---
Actually I don't really PvP, and have really only had positive experiences when I've tried. Even when I've lost :)
---
And I'm not trying not be salty here, but pointing out that you need to alter your play style if you want to use Enforcer. I see no reason why getting hit with your own splash damage shouldn't calculate against your own loadout. You'd be killing yourself without your Fireproof perk protecting you from the explosive damage, so why should that perk effect how the game calculates the modifiers for you, but not enforcer? 
---
Not really, it was near the river a bit north of the overseers camp.  Probably like dangling candy for griefers now that I think about it.  
---
hAhA nOoB iTs A fEaTuRe Of ThE gAmE!!!1!1!111!! /s
---
It‚Äôs thinking like that that got us into this mess in the first place
---
Great spot! I didn't actually have this on my map, and I thought I had everything, so thanks!
---
You can occasionally find plans but yeah, sadly this is mostly true.
---
"nukashine the appalachian wasteland's get out of jail free card"

The nuka rocketsuit was exactly the same in fallout 4 as it is in fallout 76.
---
https://youtu.be/wW5OhdMn_p4?t=28
---
Damn, gotta wait till next weekend for double xp. I ain't touching survival. 
---
We had that conversation as well.  Should I thank these guys for doing us a service of teaching her that people are shitty?
---
Sorry we‚Äôre not on the same platform.  Have fun in Appalachia!  Tell your daughter to keep fighting the good fight. A quote from three dog from fo3. 
---
I have nothing against cosmetics. 
---
P2W on the other hand is different.
---
Rads do marvelous things to the beasts. Besides, even rabbits can open doors.
---
What scares me is the number of people in the thread, and my PMs, who don't get that.
---
They are Lankey-kong-running mother fuckers and I love them for it
---
Only really need the flux, would four of the coloured flux to craft each serum be do-able?
---
Can advise as to which colour is which at the crafting table :)
---
They are rad. Doors can't stop someone who is rad, babe. 
---
His views on meat are mind shattering. 
---
It's cheated in currently, wait a little longer or you may get in trouble. I'm sure it will be sold like crazy when it's available. 
---
I believe so, about 75% sure. I can check tomorrow when I get on to confirm 100%. 
---
Cheers bud, i've got them i'm just not sure what to do with half of them, like the power radiator!
---
Guilty of pandering? Yeah I said that already.
---
Yeah, got to admit, being a PVP lord is a young boys game.  
---
Can someone please take the time and make a video of Insult Bot's Greatest Hits?  I've seen him at least 5-6 times and all I get is HOOOLD ITT, CALIBRATING TARGET and STOP!
---
Mr. Squeeze still makes me laugh so hard with his rapidly deteriorating enthusiasm about "finest..quality...............................ingredients...."  I laffarted the first time I heard it.
---
I basically ended up giving BSG a 0% APR 120 loan for a year or two until the game is in the state games used to be released in.
---
Yeah me too. I have about 350 of the fuckers.
---
I also have about 150 supply drop holotapes lol.
---
You are probably right about the name calling.  But then again, you defend bullies, so there's that.
---
It‚Äôs not working for me in PVE
---
I got 2 and sold them before I saw this, get the word out!!! 
---
You wouldn't happen to have a left arm for the T-51b armor, do you?
---
Virtually breaking things in a game about breaking things isn't morally wrong. Wth?
---
I think your kid is going to be fine man
---
Still looking 
---
I had the plans just wasn't sure where to find it in the build menu! Thanks though!
---
You do realize this game is made for adults right?
---
That said, I agree it's pretty lame, some people like to spend time to build, and I also think my camp is kind of nice.
---
However yesterday, I helped in some workshop defend event, afterwards the guy shot me as I fast traveled to my camp( Pacifist on), my camp was near so he followed me, then he proceeded to destroy my rad shower(expensive for casuals) and the workbench I was using. There is not a lot you can do about it, especially if you don't have a PVP oriented build (no sentinel/assassin armor for example). 
---
So I just logged to another server, It's dead annoying. My girlfriend also moved her rad shower to a hidden location in her camp as hers was broken for a few days by "PVP" players (I gave her the mats to repair eventually).
---
So yeah can't wait to see the Pacifist sit-and-watch-your-camp-destroyed mode getting an upgrade.
---
That said, most people are nice, and ever so often some peeps have their mic on and just shout "nice camp" and make use of your public resources, I guess it's kinda the same in real life, I mean people even steal potted plants and bbq's here.
---
Bloodied and black powder sounds about right. Killer reload time though.
---
Instigating
---
90% weight reduction
---
Something I forgot, but the first 2 make my point, great weapon ;) 
---
Whoa, it drops with explosive?? 
---
So yea instigating explosive 90% weight reduction is my goal
---
I do not, but 100% can get one tomorrow if you want. I can farm spawn locations for 100 caps.
---
Would be a cool addition to a faction system. But they need to make the servers hold more players before they could even consider something like that. About 40 players per server would be nice starting point. 
---
shoot. dumped my legendary crossbow.  Will keep and play with the next one I get.  This sounds like fun.
---
The whole thrill of games like this for me is the fact I can lose everything. From someone who played on hardcore mode for Diablo 2 and Path of Exile I think OP is shit posting. I don't sympathize with you in any way and you need to play single player games if it is too much for you. Fall Out 4 and New Vegas are great games. Let your child play them.
---
Speaking of brick. Fix the fact that I can jump through the single windows when they have bars in them.
---
So, a robotic Wolfman Jack?
---
It would be rad if I had stocks of flux haha. 
---
Thanks, I will have to think about it still, I don't want to invest in something I know I do not want.
---
Get over it dude. Takes 3 seconds to fully repair camps. 
---
If by pooling resources you mean a community chest you can put resources into to be shared than absolutely! I'm not comfortable with someone just deciding they want to craft 100 Handmade's to learn mods at the expense of my screws.
---
I hope your daughter rebuilds your camp better then ever.  Please take some pictures of it and post a tour for us to see.  I personally love to see other people's camps and love to get ideas from them.  I really want to see what she builds more than any other camp just because I know it was made with love and to help others.  
---
If I was on XBone I would come by with an inventory full of plans and make sure she had everything she needed to make the best camp possible.  I hope someone else out there can provide her with any plan that she needs.
---
A quest to go along with it would be nice. 
---
I didn't even know you could do that I better remove those from my C.A.M.P
---
I'm so sorry friend. This absolutely sucks, I've made the same posts and got downvoted to all hell, I've reported the asshats, hell, I've been Xbox banned for going off on an expletive laden rant a few times. And still, these mutants are allowed to run amok. Just know there are wastelanders out there who empathize and understand. It probably won't get better but the part of the community who enjoys the game not as griefers has your back. I'll be off my latest ban soon, I'll gladly hunt them down and cuss them out for you.
---
Aha, nah. Just doing my juty as a Responder. :)
---
Might be worth checking what spawns there, too. I know a *lot* of higher level players get annoyed if people build CAMPs in the dried up river near the Charleston station due to the possibility of a legendary supermutant spawning there
---
They just need to port over the Robot Companion expansion from Fallout 4 (I can't remember what it is called).
---
Pre-ordered here, full price two copies.
---
Game was hot trash. Full stop.
---
Be sure enemy is as full health. 
---
This actually goes pretty well with my usual end of the night ritual of tracking down at least one lvl 1-15 to hand off a full set of heavy leather stuff. It's not a game breaking difference, just enough to padding to encourage people. Though right now I'm trying to track down the BoS combat armor plans so I can become a full time smith for my discord server and it is driving me kinda nuts hahaha.
---
:D R3d can also confirm I don't work in marketing for Bethesda. Yet? Someone tag Todd and the gang?   
---
Haha looking forward to the end of the work week to play some more :) 
---
no cause that is stored in the reserved space file that i dont believe can be transferred like a save file
---
I ran through the enclave laser grid just to avoid a MOLE RAT from attacking me. i had no melee, just a fat man as my weapon (don't ask). 
---
Motherfucker ran right through them like he was a general of the damn Enclave
---
These fools are why we all have to suffer - stop treating boots like lollipops you suckers.
---
I couldn't either back in January so I gave up. 
---
Honestly they should just add more stations in general. A commentary channel would be amazing where a robot comments on the happenings of Appalachia. 
---
I got the chainsaw and it was at around 50% health. The damage was 3 so I repaired it to 200% and it's now 53. The speed is slow though so I can't see this being a very good weapon. The slugger and gladiator perks don't affect the damage either. 
---
Take over a power plant and power up the core maker thing
---
Do you want us to rebuild Appalachia or not Bethesda? PvP has no place in 'adventure mode' imo. Oh and while were on topic why does the decontamination arch cost 1 of each stable flux to repair. The fact that they're so annoying to repair is probably why people destroy them. 
---
That is soo wrong but soo right.  I love it.
---
Go to the power plants on the map then take over the workshops. Then from there they have fusion core generators but each machine requires 100 power
---
They have lvl3 lock pick and security clearance. Nothing keeps them out 
---
Yeah I gotta use my mic more   Not a bad idea. 
---
Same goes for the killing the windigo in a clown outfit. I'm over trying that one too. 
---
Yeah I agree. 
---
Imagine hitting a scorched beast just for it to get tested across the sky...
---
Ended up doing that after scooting back in twice and throwing some heart emotes only to be met with a hail of bullets lol 
---
So like Posiden?
---
Got it thank you!!!
---
You're more than welcome.
---
I'm thinkin' of jumping on.. But at the chance of getting wrecked. I don't think so. Lol
---
Bro I have no clue for a bunch lol. I‚Äôll get a pic soon
---
Sent you a message!
---
They want you to buy Atoms.  But they do not force you to buy DLC.  
---
I would like to get Healing Factor off you please. I can pay the 250 caps. 
---
I had a level 15 turn up at my base today, so I waved him in, made him a sweet Cultish Blade, Handmade gun and gave him some spare Purified Water, RadX/Away and Stimpaks.... and then we played guitar for a few minutes under the influence of Vintage Nukashine... I hope he ended up somewhere nice. 
---
This seems to match what I pick up.  I love vampire weapons and I do get a fair amount, and it does look like this is one of the most common effects that get droppped for weapons. I want a vampire gatling (which I lost somehow) and the odds are I should get one eventually as gatling and vampire have a higher % of dropping.
---
By the ash heap there is an event that is called battle bot every time you complete you get at least one fusion core I also got marine armor plans from it
---
PSA if you broke the power-up quest the plant will supply the power, so you won't need to build generators.
---
&gt; **I should have the right to not play with you.** 
---
You do, it's called Fallout 4.
---
Aw man that'll be real helpful thanks
---
Or just go to posidon and server hop and steal them from dudes workshops. You only get like a 10 cap bounty for picking a lot. 10 caps for 3 100% cores is a good deal
---
Yea no problem
---
Because the game was never intended to be played in the way you‚Äôre asking for.
---
If you own it FO4 might be a good substitute so you don‚Äôt risk this happening again.
---
I trade on the market as well and would agree with you. 
---
I'm with you. Fuck em. I spent $60 to enjoy pixels how I want and will gladly cry about dicks who ruin my experience.
---
Play fallout 4 then 
---
Yeah!! Saving supplies
---
Honestly it's stuff like this that really takes the enjoyment out of games for me, most games these days are all focused towards being against each other. Maybe it's just me but co-op games just don't seem as widespread as they once were. 
---
Was a time I used to like playing competitive games, but as I've gotten older I really just can't be bothered with that kind of experience anymore it's just not fun. I'd rather play and work together with other people and have a chilled out good time together. It's sad to think some people have nothing better to do than be jerks in a virtual world for no reason. Sure the game was designed in mind to allow that kind of thing but it doesn't mean you SHOULD. 
---
With upcoming updates hopefully nothing like that happens to your daughter again, it's not a nice experience for anyone yet alone a child with special needs who's taking pride in their creation. As someone who is personally on the autistic spectrum I can kinda sympathize. 
---
PS: If it does happen again (I truly hope it doesn't) have her re-place her C.A.M.P, it costs 40 caps and she'll have to rebuild again but all the parts she built will be stored &amp; fixed ready for placement again. Save her resources that would otherwise be used to repair everything. 
---
Lol, dang xD
---
If you have three star trapper gear with weapon or food/aid/chem reduce, I could end up paying you perhaps? :p
---
Yea, but I recommend you know the fusion generator plan which I have at cost for you 192 caps
---
Yeah but with my luck it be a lvl 100 and I'll get destroyed
---
It all started with cosmetics. Next there will be lunchboxes that give boosts, etc.
---
Wish you could remember that location... :(
---
Thank you but I already got it
---
Bloody legend cheers
---
Good thing I scrapped my combat shotgun yesterday
---
Preordered here, full price, one copy.
---
Game was actually bigger and better than Fo4, as I had been playing Modded Fo4 right before. To me, it started out as an improvement on the previous. I put down RDR2 before playing 76 and havent picked it up since.
---
Just goes to show that different opinions can exist.
---
Good thing I scrapped my combat shotgun yesterday...
---
That‚Äôs it I‚Äôm not saying what these people did is good I‚Äôm just saying when you play a game where the point is for people to be a part of the waste land don‚Äôt complain when someone does it 
---
Then dont put them in the community chest. Or do it with your friends.
---
You're gone before they can fast travel to you. And even if you're still there, whatever. They claim the tiny bounty and you keep the cores
---
Can do
---
Still 2 hours left at work however
---
I mean I‚Äôm a trans guy and medically speaking my testosterone levels are even higher than half those dudes.... and yet all I wanna do is have more potted plants in my camp and make more friends. I think it‚Äôs probably more that they‚Äôve been socialised from a young age to be dicks, to never cry etc. I don‚Äôt wanna make excuses for them based on testosterone cos it doesn‚Äôt do that. 
---
PS: If Bethesda read this, can we please have more indoor plants? Thank ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I would not be mad at that.  I've been saving leather/rubber/plastic steel swapping in Armorer 3, Scrapper and Super Duper 3, and made around 1000 light combat chest pieces over the past month trying to learn a dense mod.  (I have bought *one* dense combat mod from Phoenix and am saving it like it's the Holy Grail)  I have four marine dense mods and a dense robot mod, but nothing for combat, metal or leather, and I check every vendor on the map every day.
---
I've even tried switching to sturdy and heavy torso crafting for 100 or so units with no results.
---
I'm also hunting down all Treasure Maps with no luck on that front, either.  I've gotten a bunch of plans I didn't know, but not one dense armor plan, or even an interesting power armor plan.  I've probably gotten two dozen motion assist servo or rusty knuckle plans for almost every suit possible.
---
At this point, I'm not even sure if I *can* learn dense mods of any kind.  I feel like I'm throwing cash into a bonfire.  I've literally tried everything.
---
Dude the players are meant to be the bad guys just as well as the good ones the whole point is for people to hate them. If it was valid it wouldnt be in the game 
---
Can't quite see it on mobile but trust that it is awesome! Snoogins
---
Or don't be a fuck hiding behind a u/?  Or can you not hack it in the other mode? Did you even read the post?
---
And the garage door - the power connection should be on the inside - not the outside
---
ive said it before and ill say it again
---
Maria
---
You're more than welcome mate. Enjoy them Double XP Gains.
---
So let me get this straight, step one: take the workshop, step two: grab the fusion cores, step three: run like hell. Did I get it right?
---
I'd much rather have the actual gun, the assault rifle in fo4/76 barely feels like an assault rifle. The model is based off a WW1 LMG, and the single fire receivers make it feel more like a bulky sniper rifle. Having a skin on it that made it look like the f3 rifle wouldn't feel right
---
I have a Legendary War Drum with 40% melee speed increase, +1 Endurance, and low health/high damage with maxed out melee speed perk cards.  
---
I love this weapon.
---

---
People who play like that not only don‚Äôt care that you think they are shot but in fact are happy about it.
---
They'll really make anyone general. Im impressed he got the 10 accommodations.
---
I know it's not combat armor but it has 49 damage resistance, so it's still pretty good
---
Well yes, that was the point of me suggesting a community chest :)
---
Dude, you can place a switch or pressure plate, hook up power to plate, and connect that directly to the door (not the conduit on the door, but there's an upper section of the door that you can attach wires to and it just clips through the wall itself.)
---
Just try attaching a wire to the door without aiming at the conduit on the door.
---
Like I said man, what those guys did was fucked and I would never do that to anyone, regardless of who built it. That being said... you can't tell me that you are surprised that it happened? It's a multiplayer game man, I cant tell you how many MMO'S I have played that I've gotten pk'd by someone way higher level than me. Sure I get upset, sure I wish it didn't happen..  but was I surprised? No cause you cant control what other people do :/ I wasnt trying to be an ass I really feel bad for you and your kid but what can you do 
---
Skip step 1. Just literally go there, and grab the cores from his machine. Pick the lock if you have to. Stash your junk first, because you'll have a bounty if you pick the lock
---
Spruce knob also has acid
---
Was just thinking the other day that it would be nice if we could rotate objects in all directions so you could have like tables flipped over and chairs knocked on their sides.
---
Lol my armor situation ain‚Äôt the greatest; I don‚Äôt even use any legendaries myself. Sorry.
---
I legit thought this was a feature of the game. 
---
I always refer to this great spreadsheet - [Fallout 76 Weapon Mod Learn Chance](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19ZhGrawX03LlZtS9smKLqcC2LT875f5V_qPFefn79OM/edit#gid=0)
---
Check your sodium levels bud. Then look at the case of the game you decided to let your special needs child play. 
---
It's rated M. For mature. As in if you as a parent feel comfortable exposing your child to the themes of racism, genocide, global conflict, murder of all flavors, all without your active supervision, that's some piss poor parenting straight up. 
---
Go to flatwoods, go to the top of the church steeple and pick up the little boys holotape as he blames himself for the ending of the world thinking his father abandoned him. That's within reach of anybody within half an hour of playing. You'd be ok with your child playing a game with that level of heavy hitting subject matter? 
---
Yes what these players did was shitty, and yes the bullying types didn't just switch over to survival where anybody with a scrap of forethought stands a decent chance. But at the end of the day the responsibility of this parenting decision rests on yours shoulders alone. 
---
Yea its more active now since last week, had someone go to my camp and destroyed everything 4 times and lost caps defending, just glad this will be gone and the team making Fallout 76 didn't listen to Todd Howard in designing this game to be a free for all 24/7.
---
Bow bar, long bow bar, dual blade, and flamer.  All mods but flamer can be learned from scrapping them. 
---
I mean it sucks but PvP is still very much a thing in adventure mode.
---
I mean really you should have just left that low level alone.
---
But the ranger themselves were Gobi Dessert Rangers...they were not rangers OF the Gobi
---
I had a mod like this for Fallout 4, that used the Flare Gun animations. I wouldn't mind another revolver in the game.
---
Simplicity I, like it!
---
Got a Grognak's axe like that. I am far from a melee build, but thing is a got damned beast. I put on my best Hick's voice when talking to friends "I keep it around for close encounters."
---
Just got a gauss rifle plan. I'm not even sure what all you can and can't get yet, but it's a LOT cheaper than buying them from vendors and some you can only get by finding them, not scrapping things.
---
If you feel comfortable, message me your gamertag.  I'm only lvl 63, but I'd gladly stand guard and hang out around your camp to help protect your daughter's work.
---
Your welcome!
---
What time tomorrow?
---
You are all missing the point, I am not saying if I buy a dress I want it to be a suit on my male character.
---
Im saying each item in the atomic shop should come with an opposite sex counterpart as part of the purchase so you get that outfit but a different version of that outfit for each sex
---
Its what i do when I'm low. Its kinda greasy but whatever :)
---
John henry Eden "When I was a molerat, growing up in rural West Virginia, I had the best friend a boy could hope for, my dear old vault dweller, .""
---
Damn thats awesome thanks!
---
No, they were assholes. 
---
 P A S S I V E   M O D E
---
Lol, jeez mate, what level are you?
---
Fallout hobo? ;p
---
What serums were you chasing?
---
You‚Äôve been pretty combative through the thread. You can have the win. Seems like you need one after the night you‚Äôve had. So forget your concession about the name calling. 
---
To be fair it does open the "Hi, what's your name" door.
---
If only their were intelligent life anywhere lol
---
I got the flamer, which one is the best to put in the other slot?
---
I‚Äôm looking to buy a fine automobile from him
---
Yeah but if its a lvl 100+ I dont think a couple of fully charged fusion cores gone missing will matter 
---
With sentinel assassin it seems very possible, also executioners wouldve had 0 effect if they have that armor since unless they run bloodied, theyll never come close to being below that for long. They also most likely had a handmade with explosive
---
Sorry.  I'm not a doctor or scientist, but I've been alive long enough to know that many young men tend to have an abundance of aggression with no "landing pad" to place it in modern western civilization, and posting mean, bullying, insensitive, instigating comments on the internet or trolling soft targets in online games seems to be the outlet of choice.  I've always found a lot more personal joy in being a lover rather than a fighter, so I just don't get it.
---
I too would like more potted plants, or at least the ability to make other players laugh by walking into my camp and seeing a plate of moldy food, a plastic fork and 30 empty beer bottles on my kitchen table with one chair tipped over.  To me, that's environmental and funny.  You can't look at that display and not say "that guy is gonna feel great tomorrow".
---
I use the dual bar.  It‚Äôs honestly just aesthetic.  They do not add any additional damage, only over repairing to 200% does. 
---
It most certainly does, whether it was meant or not the mutation cuts my Gauss damage from 444 to 222. Got downvoted in another thread for saying this, don't know why though...
---
Ya there really is no reason for this. Wild how so many people are defending this and actually acting like elitist pricks.
---
Since the end of December, I‚Äôve been playing casual (just passed lvl 100 this week) and have never run across asshats running around destroying camps, until tonight. 
---
So I feel your pain. I ended up killing the guy, took his loot and the logged off.
---
I would have preferred to trade with him/her and their buddies, but they were grieving, no doubt.
---
So in my mind, I killed him and took the loot and all is well. I had to switch from passive. Wish it didn‚Äôt happen.
---
But when people in Adventure want to build and explore, for the love of Christ, let them....let me, and leave us be.
---
Go play the beta grieving module. 
---
So yes, I know they are going to fix this. I feel for the guy who has a challenge with a child who wants to explore and build without having to deal with one shot children running around with their shot guns. 
---
The next time this happens to me, we (I) will just target these folks publicly and handle this (myself) ourselves.
---
And I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs some 10 year olds running around doing these things. But this is an adult platform. We can police this ourselves.
---
Anyhow, so sorry for your grief and your child‚Äôs challenges in life. My heart goes out to you.
---
If on PS 4, join up with AlexKnight007 and we‚Äôll get you anything you need.
---
A hair away from 77. Twisted muscles and scaly skin to top off my melee build. I‚Äôm a hobo that punches.
---
Bloodied only effects ballistic and energy damage and doesn't effect radiation output. I'm not sure about assassin's though... I would guess it's the same, but you could always test it on a willing friend if you have both weapons.
---
Right?...
---
Why it's:  
---
**Bad**: They're still trying to migrate single player mechanics into a multiplayer game. They don't really know how to do it well at this point and that's why we keep seeing changes to PvP mechanics every patch.
---
**Unfair**: It's not. You will have an equal chance to equip and perk out your character to the same extent as anyone else, with the exception of people buying their gear for real money on Ebay. At that point it's virtually P2W mechanics which are not offically supported.
---
**Unbalanced**: It's not, you just don't have enough of a handle on the current mechanics *or* enough resources to build and equip your character to the point of being able to not get 1-shotted. Example, the Fireproof Perk will negate most/all explosion damage depending on their perks. The balance in the PvP is the fact that everything has weaknesses and strengths. To get strong in some cases there's always something you need to sacrifice or at the very least not strengthen. Unless you have a really good grasp of the mechanics of PvP meta chasers will usually have the advantage.
---
In saying that, sharing perks in a team does actually cause imbalance between the metas. If I'm grouped with 3 other people and we're all sitting at 6 charisma, that's essentially and extra 6 SPECIAL points worth of perks we all get.  
---
None of the 3 mods add nothing?
---
How do you know he doesn't wear a cape?
---
Well, assasin armor is in the game for a reason, and at your Current lvl, you cant yet have all cards optimised for pvp, barberian, ironclad, fireproof, evesive and some other cards for some juice, and on that 4/5 or 5/5 assasin armor ontop of that.  No need to get salty, just grind for the right stuff and ul be fine my man ü§ò i role with AA wepons ( non explosive) and il give em a good fight, and im not even getting close to oneshotted so far
---
Two of my 76 homies were at PAX East.  I really hope they saw this.  One of them loves Death Tambos, so I expect she'd be very "jazzed" on this.
---
Did you try standing on it while another player was crouching? If they have chameleon thats probably the reason why the animations didnt work.
---
I already spend a lot of my time in game being a good Samaritan, so this won't be out of my way: if you're on PC, I'll show up with maxed out Contractor perk and a buttload of junk to go all Jimmy "Habitat for Humanity" Carter on your base. Let me know.
---
Important point for your kid is, yeah, there are shitty people out there, but there are *so much* more good than bad people.
---
Ill have to think about it since I have combat mods learned.
---
I think it used to not affect it in the past
---
 I've never used it. 
---
Ah what a productive and clever comment. Bravo.
---
Might be my only option if no one really knows.
---
I was hoping the workshops would work like that with the inclusion of a faction system. It would definitely make workshops more interesting and worth the effort to take and hold. But server stability and the fact you lose a workshop when you change servers or log off kinda fucks that whole idea. 
---
Why didn't you just change servers?
---
Raider fort, enclave bunker, minute men castle.
---
Hot sellers. Hunters Longcoats, coloured Asylum uniforms.. 
---
Other rare outfits will sell too, but the ones i mentioned are slightly easier to farm.
---
I sell Witch Costumes 50 caps each.. If you have a nice base you unlock my lower prices.
---
Are you just getting the spinning wheel when you go to loot her or is her inventory empty? If it's the spinning wheel the loot is having trouble loading in. If she's just empty it's glitched out.
---
Ah maybe you should know that people being dickheads on videos games is much much worse.
---
/s
---
Will see if I have spares from Superduper, my hobo-acquaintance, lol
---
Fuck. Those. Guys. I'm very sorry this happened to you. And it shouldn't. Everytime I read about someone having a bad encounter I'm honestly shocked as all the encounters I have with other players are generally positive. There was even a point where I accidently shot another player (he was moving so fast I thought he was a freaking ghoul) he ran over towards me and did the confused reaction. I plugged in my mic and told him I misfired and I really didn't mean to shoot him. After that we ran around collecting junk for a bit. All in all. I'm very sorry that this happened..
---
P.S. on an unrelated note... Murderhobo? Do I sense a fellow DnD player? Or is that a more common term than I think?
---
Thanks for the tip 
---
Unfortunately, the assholes are all over, PS4 user here and I've had a few two or three man teams show up while I'm building for any length of time wreck everything with strike beacons and mini-nukes.
---
That's why now if I'm going to build I either block everyone on the server so they can't see my dot or I crouch before going into build mode so I stay hidden on the map.
---
All I want is to be left alone while I'm doing my thing. I'm sorry this happened and I hope it doesn't again.
---
I know, it should at least get a short scope and one of the tactical dot aiming devices. I know for xbows I have used IRL, I always use scopes designed for pellet/air rifles. The mechanics of the xbow require a scope designed for air rifles rather than standard center fire rifles like the .308. Of course, maybe that's why they don't have any scope mods since it would be harder to manufacture and/or find air rifle scopes in the wastes. 
---
What are you on? If on PS4 I'll buy and give you all the junk you need. 
---
I got the spinning wheel forever and then nothing appeared 
---
maybe move somewhere way out on the edge of the map where you know nobody is going to go?
---
This is true, no XP, but you get loot. These players must be doing this to farm legendaries
---
3000 for an entire set isn't exactly a lot. Sound like you settled on something sub-optimal as sent/calv unyielding BOS goes for a lot more than 3k caps for a single piece.
---
The character naming is so that you can tell your different characters apart. It uses your gamertag or whatever it is called on the platform you are playing on for everyone else to make things easier
---
Despite the issues she was having, I think it‚Äôs so cool she found something in the game that makes her happy and she can really enjoy! Unfortunately I have noticed the uptick of griefers as well with the addition of the new mode, (funny how that works) but generally people in game seem pretty awesome. Hopefully you both have better luck and come across friendly vault dwellers in the future! üëçüèª
---
I second this GT: Benadri
---
My experience has mostly been pleasant, meeting kind souls who are willing to give free plans, ammos and even weapons. Then there's definitely gonna be guys on the other end of the spectrum.
---
I still believe there are more people who are keen to help than to get a cheap thrill of trashing someone's camp.
---
Take consolation that the people that does it probably have a challenged real life. Theres probably a lot of hurt in that locker. 
---
For Xbox, check the "recent players" list and see if any names ring a bell.
---
Im an old fart.  I honestly didn't realize that term was no longer a thing.  
---
I appreciate it lol.
---
Cheers, thanks for that!
---
I had been trying to get my best mate to buy this game for months. He finally broke down and got it. He's hooked, almost level 50 now lol.
---
If this is a reference to destiny 2 that's exactly what my friends and I called him.
---
You get a piece of combat armor for completing the event but sometimes if you don‚Äôt do enough damage then it won‚Äôt register the kill. Were you there from the start of the fight/how long did you fight her/ what gun did you use and how many rounds or melee swings did you hit?
---
Sounds to me like you might‚Äôve gotten there later in the fight and your shots didn‚Äôt register before she was killed, it can take a couple minutes for the game to load everything from the vent in ime. Or if you‚Äôre gettin the spinning wheel then just wait it out.
---
It's actually a very common term Dungeon masters use in DnD. It's to describe a player who wants nothing to do with the story or other mechanics but only cares about the combat portion of the game
---
Love it!! Platform? and where are you located, I Love visiting unusual C.A.M.P.S.  
---
It was so fast.  It really shocked me. Got to give them credit, they ruined our fun amazingly efficiently.  
---
Well, if you weren't kind of a dick, I might agree with you. But you are, so I can't. /S
---
Technically you're running into a high level area of the game.  Like,  at 27 you probably shouldn't be anywhere near Harpers Ferry in the first place. 
---
The problem comes from the fact that Bethesda put a vendor there,  forcing players to go there if you want the caps.
---
Thankfully they will be putting a vendor from every faction (excluding Enclave)  at Whitesprings shortly so low level characters won't be forced to hop to either Harper's or Watoga.
---
U have long bow bar? I need to mod mine lol
---
Is that a guess or is that true? Didn‚Äôt know that existed.
---
I got there right at the tail end of her Regen. She regened, and continued through the fight. I had a TSE auto combat shotgun, even helped cripple her to stay on the ground for the second bar of health
---
I'm sorry to hear your kid's camp got wrecked. At this point it would be a lot better for you to just relog into the Adventure mode and gather supplies, rebuilding the camp piece by piece. What I kind off don't understand is why you would log into the Survival mode which is specifically built for PVP especially that, ever since it's release last month, it didn't have the opinion of being a particularly "friendly" environment...
---
Like 2 times more. Only host i will accept is the real person hosting every. Otherwise just let music play
---
That was my point... if you're not willing to spend just a few thousand, you shouldn't even be involved with this.
---
I'm not interested in Sentinel's, as I use melee way more often than ranged, nor Cavalier's, as I don't often sprint while in combat. I didn't settle for anything. The only thing I'm missing that I want is the extra +1 STR for each piece.
---
It's the same thing with BE weapons. I don't care for 3*, except for my Super Sledge which I made sure was 3* Bloodied of exactly what I want. I simply want BE.
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
No worries, lol
---
Will post here when I know what I have
---
Waaaah
---
Holy shit you are an idiot. Not once did he imply anything even close to what you are suggesting. Why are you acting like some kind of weird elitist asshole?
---
Rng is never random only pseudo random. True rng is pretty impossible to replicate in a video game. But anyway server hopping just gives you a different instance of the same rng algorithm. Sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn't.
---
Nah, I came back to apologize.  You are right.  Its hard to have the high ground when you are  pissed.  And Im too old to let a experience in a game be an excuse for poor behavior.  Thanks for calling me out on it. 
---
If you are on PC, find me and I can help you learn to craft the Marine Armor Helmet and/or 6 of the 7 helmets in the game (the seventh one, the Marine Tactical Helmet must be learned by plan). IGN: jchamlin
---
I'd prefer they put adventure mode back how it used to be and just make  a separate no pvp mode. I don't really dig losing meds in survival and no fast travel... 
---
Love to your girl, I have a 9 year old that has a huge heart, something like this would wreck her. They just can't understand why everyone else isn't as kind natured as they are!
---
Please look me up on xb1, same gamer tag as here, friend me and I'd love to see her work! Just let me know who you are though lol
---
Because you touch yourself at night.
---
While I do like seeing things like this sk I can compare my own drops to others I will have to say that everything in the game is generated randomly. Starts with weapon or armor, then it does melee or ranged for weapon and which set for armor followed by which piece for armor, then it does legendary effect 1, then if it's more than 1 star it does legendary effect 2, and finally if it's 3 stars it does legendary effect 3. Somewhere in there it rolls for weapon mods and how many stars but my brain is too muddled right now to remember where. 
---
My ''raiding'' limits itself to stealing crops and ressources.  Destroying what people put their time and heart into ? That's just beeing an asshole. Especially since there is a PVP mode.
---
My guess is that griefers are just people with miserable life that find relief in destroying people's happiness. Assholes. 
---
Sorry for your daughter :(
---
I‚Äôve had this happen to me once too, such a letdown 
---
I want this so badly. They have the ability as there are walls in the game that act as doors. For example near the end of the nuka quantum paint quest thing
---
Nope, dont waste your caps with a legendary one at all
---
Ts shotgun! 
---
I am all out of fucks sorry.
---
I have to ask what system and what was there names? We can start a kos on these guys to show them a bit of karma.
---
They made the survival mode for people who want that challenge. The twisted jerks who just want to be typical bullies would never have the stones to go to a place where they can be actually owned.
---
It's like a home invasion. You don't choose Dwayne Johnson's place, you find Steve Erkel's.
---
I love it.  So good.
---
I started building this [pipe rifle](https://scontent-ort2-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/15994372_10209883981749735_6496116119121247060_o.jpg?_nc_cat=107&amp;_nc_oc=AQlN02M4GMNcc6bGuXGjiQx9O3Ovp_z7wpSYi8yO3HhVf0GhU5mbnkUsvsDn4vRAGJ5vytxqnn5t-r6se2Mj9ruh&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-ort2-2.xx&amp;oh=091c39b5054a920ebe02f08d999c1840&amp;oe=5D01F222) in [2015](https://scontent-ort2-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/15941328_10209883981629732_9119567367733566981_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&amp;_nc_oc=AQk0GdapX2n7Q9FNbRs0NTxrstkUHOUaqxlqCn30S87sd3nb1AOrJBOsQqz11lx-geZo-Uqz45p8gYG6DjqnlSCt&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-ort2-2.xx&amp;oh=bcfcd8c83c3d259a867e87013ad34534&amp;oe=5D04C4B9), but never finished the stock because I didn't have access to a friend that could properly weld.  The whole thing is "legit" materials, IE actual plumbing pipe and wood I salvaged from old factories (I live in the rust belt, so that's not difficult).  The barrel I actually dug out of a mud pit and the wooden block was the good end of a rotten oak support beam.
---
I have all the materials for a stock, but they need to be attached to the oak slab with screws and be welded together in pieces.  I also have a properly weathered 16g copper spool for the forward wrapping.
---
If you live in upstate NY and want to help me finish this piece, I would be over the moon.
---
The piece is 90% of the way there.  I just need to put the buttstock together and add small touches.  The trigger even has a catch placed against a salvaged toggle switch so you hear a click when you pull the trigger.
---
I was so disappointed!!! 
---
You selling that TS faster fire rate Auto grenade launcher 
---
It's just exhausting seeing all of these shitty posts about atoms
---
I highly doubt it's random items being picked. 
---
I'd bet that it's items that didn't sell well in the shop or had a sales slump after they were added. So in an attempt to sell more of those poorly selling items they manufacture scarcity for them by removing them after one last sale.
---
Yes it's a means to entice people to buy them, but it's nothing new, not to video games, not to shopping in general. If something that is stocked doesn't sell, put it on clearance sale. If it still doesn't sell dump it to make room for new merchandise. Rinse repeat.
---
Most of the items in the atomic shop vary pretty wildly in quality anyways. So most of the stuff lost isn't that "valuable".
---
__Dwayne Johnson is a national treasure.__
---
\*facepalms\* Completely my bad, I tagged the wrong user. x.x
---
How about the fact that there is a distinct line between mods and cheats. Mods right now are only interact files or assets while cheats like the ones mentioned have to either be loaded through a dll or injected into the exe after its running. 
---
You should never rank evil, for you will be tempted to accept the lesser ones
---
Duping isn't a thing anymore but the economy is still effected by it. 
---
The skins suck. Can't be traded without having to remove them. That's just dumb. Went to give a piece to a friend and couldn't because I put dumb ass camo on it. So I had to remove the paint to transfer or drop it. 
---
Reminds me of theasshats on youtube who did dumb pranks and called them ''social experiments''. 
---
Not only just what he listed, all non-bulkable junk can be sold for 1-2 caps. Nuked runs are great for nuclear material, 400 of that empties all the vendors of their caps just from the waste you can collect.
---
I mean to be fair I just got on and saw what was happening and was a little upset about it too.
---
Lol then I come here to find the very few posts talking about it and everybody is jumping up to defend Bethesda for creating this exclusivity bullshit and putting them on sale before they "go away because you know....digital supplies are limited". Its an obvious and lazy way to push for people to spend/buy caps.
---
This sub is so weird. People defend duped weapons and will actually be shitty to people who voice concerns over lame mtx tactics.
---
This is exactly what has happens last few times playing. I take over a workshop for a small amount of time and do a nice job of setting up defenses. I come and go to check on and grab my goodies and eventually one trip back, bam I die. Player lvl triple digit, no life, tool, 360 no scope, one shot one kill, 420, 69, XXX, cool guy zone, or whatever hidden player kills me in one shot. The the workshop is taken over and left abandon as I am not going to anything about it anymore the asshat leaves and goes on to be more of a tool so they may ascend to the great toolbox.
---
Truly, I knew not the wonders and varieties of meat until I was enlightened by Grahm. 
---
It stacks
---
Isn't the handmade essentially the Chinese assault rifle already anyways?
---
I think if you build too close to the golf course, a bunch of golfer ghouls should shower it in exploding golfballs.  As someone who once lived next to a course, this would be highly realistic.  Especially if said ghouls were drunk and loud.
---
Calling orbital strikes is just convenient. It lets you participate in the online multiplayer gameplay to the full extent instead of surrendering that privilege to the asshat with no consideration for others.
---
Not that you won't still want them, but they're disappointingly wonky as hell. I'm hoping they fix the placement issues at some point :(
---
I usually hoard known plans cuz when i do runs I just grab everything. Then later on I find people and drop this massive pile of plans on them
---
It‚Äôs very difficult for me to be sympathetic with you because your entire argument comes down to ‚Äúmy way of playing is the right way‚Äù and it‚Äôs simply not. Destroying bases isn‚Äôt an accident of code design, it‚Äôs deliberately allowed. We may not personally see the enjoyment in that style of play but it‚Äôs no less the proper method of playing than anything you do. 
---
You‚Äôre literally complaining about a style of play. Just because you don‚Äôt like that style does not somehow make it illegit anymore than they can say about you.
---
So, I agree on not attacking camps, to an extent, but what do you all think of attacking Workshops. I and a group of friends started a big fight at one or two so we could 1. Use it ourselves 2. Have some pvp here and there. Now, I am by no means saying to go around and just blow up peoples stuff, but some pvp in adventure can be fun here and there as long as it is not just you/them being a dick. 
---
I was going to suggest leave the server- but you have already tried that
---
Now you are someone I would like to run into in game.  Or life really.  
---
I live in my mom's basement but I'm a friendly 76 player! We're not all bad! Anyway... If you need any supplies to rebuild I stockpile junk like it's nobody's business. DM me if I can help do anything to get the camp back up and running.
---
Interesting. I knew these were going to happen due to looking at the game files but I did not know when. Lots of other interesting stuff coming up too after it ;) 
---
Sorry - I play on PS4. But thanks! 
---
"Gotta get yahself a swattuh!"
---
i just want to say my nightclub is under construction right now. but i plan on being the hottest nightclub in town. 
---
It would have been amazing to go around and find notes from the scientists up there as they saw the world blow up
---
Fuck you
---
Just go to your xbox profile and change the status to show offline.  Or edit your privacy settings so that only friends can see you online.
---
Not once have I ever heard that. Personally I would prefer no name displayed at all to encourage this exact thing.
---
Yeah, I agree.  We have to hold them accountable though, us older types.  Back when I was growing up, being a "gamer" was just not something the typical angry males did, we were their targets.  Its a lot more "cool" to be a geek these days.  in the late 70's through early 90's it was not exactly a label you put on a flag and flew.  So when  I see those types of alpha male penis waivers in games I think gamers of a certain age...react with a little less grace than perhaps we should.   And now the fucking griefers made me think deeply about the ethics of my own conduct, dammit.  Get off my lawn.
---
I mean... I would choose Dwayne Johnson's place... 
---
You‚Äôre aware it‚Äôs repeatable right?
---
Use it however you want, after all, "when in Rome..."
---
If you want them, get them. If you don't, don't. It's that simple. Those items have been up for months by now. Did you really want that west Virginia ball cap? 
---
I would rather have an atom store curated than cluttered with all the trash they can't seem to get people to buy when they slash the prices. 
---
I mean not even exaggerating the street I live on is longer than the Charleston airport runway and the airfields out here are like double that 
---
 
---
Flare guns are not part of the legendary loot drops but drills are. 
---
Yeah, after lvl 50, at level up, you can choose to either
---
Re distribute a special point
---
Or
---
Pick any card you want
---
I'm not sure what problem that guy has though. Maybe hes just a troll.
---
It never gives me anything extra and the quest never says I completed it. I just gave up. 
---
Nukashine
---
Aka Nopejuice
---
It's not. You were going to get a 1 star and you got wood. If it was going to be 2 or 3 you woidlnt get it
---
That....is a awesome tip.  I feel stupid not thinking of it.  Thanks!
---
Rampant.
---
More learning curve for Bethesda's pvp.
---
Verrrrry wrong. Enclave Production sells it 
---
I know Enclave Production sells it. If you‚Äôre PS4 and still can‚Äôt find it I can get you one 
---
ill be popping up shop in the middle of no where with non perishable food and water for sale. or down the road from one of the future raid vaults as a tavern/restaurant 
---
I'm not reading all the responses, but if no one has said it already, just move your base.  It then comes back in one piece.
---
This is incorrect. Perk cards are unlocked at certain levels up to level 50 at which point you have the choice of all the perk cards when you level up. 
---
Don't think you can drop keys in the game unfortunately 
---
Oh Surivial mode only, boo. I was looking for a reason to get back into this game.
---
i can paint your PA for u with quantum
---
i was hoping it would be seperate, just limiited on how much stuff you can display for sale.  i agree people would just use it to store stuff by charging max amount possible.  Or... you can put stuff in the machine to sell for free, but if you want to remove it from sale you have to pay a deslisting fee to make it not practical (or at least an expensive) way to use vending machines as storage.
---
You sir are either a troll or an idiot. 
---
In adventure I did never attacked another players camps. In survival if i find one, i shot few times to it, so owner will be noticed and maybe come to my bait. If someone with bounty or leader of scoreboard is hiding inside of his camp, i am not risking being pulled into trap, so i open walls with TSE minigun. 
---
Sometimes there are reason for total destruction.
---
Thanks for the tip. Unfortunately it does not help with crashing while using items from the aid tab of the pip-boy (after fully loading of course).
---
Sweet Outfit 
---
Unfortunately its impossible to move.  Something we will fix in version 2.0.  She was impressively cool, really built it into the terrain.  Took her hours just to get the foundations the way she wanted em.  I wish I had screenshots.  Kid is good at it, cant wait to see what she comes up with next.
---
That is an option.  I was hoping for the plan as the Tesla is just a regular nothing special.  How much? 
---
Thank you sir
---
Just got back into the game recently and the alcohol challenges have slowed me down in my quest for caps.
---
There are a few things going away that I figured I'd get eventually throughout my time. I'm not gonna support this bullshit and buy any of em now.
---
I‚Äôve had that happen to me as well, just a random bug I guess, sucks but it‚Äôs only happened once so hopefully next time you get the loot.
---
You do understand that that is exactly what it means right? This is a game where everyone when leveling up chooses perks with the same exact method. It's not programmed so that you get things differently then everyone else
---
Oh Moe. You single handedly either help to explain why we need human NPC‚Äôs or why we don‚Äôt. :)
---
You're experiencing a visual glitch where the game loaded a scorched model but the enemy was classified as a bot
---
Death Tambo would be an awesome prop to make. However, if I had to make another weapon, I'd love to make a Guitar Sword.
---
No it‚Äôs confirmed by a dev to be available but highly rare 
---
Before we go down the rabbit hole of trade-stealing-like hysterics, is there proof that this is happening in survival?
---
Not saying that I don't believe the OP but also not just going to take their word on it. Did a Google search restricting results to the past month and nothing substantial shows up that I can see to indicate as such.
---
I just read this and remember playing vanilla wow where a person could work hard to become ultra elite so they could shit on others, all because they decided that was their goal and got it. 
---
Main reason I still choose to play. Too many games where a person cannot rise above the rest, but are stuck in the trenches with the scrubs.
---
I‚Äôll don‚Äôt extra junk and help you/your kid out with any thing like you or she needs
---
Sorry to hear that.  ALSO, in the upcoming patch, turrets/defenses will actually hurt players attacking your camp.  Not only that, they will fire back at any distance, so you can't snipe and not expect to get hit.
---
That's one way to deal with guests who overstay their welcome
---
What level are you supposed to be when you have to deal with the Free States in the main story? I've done plenty of side quests, events, and I've farmed ran the WS Golf course a few times, so I dont think I'm underleveled?
---
Me too except its going to be plans.  
---
You can flip the walls round to have brick on the inside, with some nice lighting it looks really nice inside 
---
Well it makes sense when you have seen mole rats burrow out of the roof of a gazebo. Those fuckers are tenacious.
---
Did you want one of those? I'd happily sell it to you for a cheap price.
---
At the same time, sometimes griefers unfortunately try to wreck [this guy's](https://imgur.com/Y7x8oO3) camp.  It's unfortunate for them.  Don't think that it's always a cakewalk for some clone-like asshole in a clown suit and Fasnacht mask wielding a Deathclaw Gauntlet.  They think they can walk all over the "sheep" who want to share, but some of us are [gentle](https://imgur.com/0qijS48) [giants](https://imgur.com/IekuuUx) that would rather trade than slay.
---
I made a few if anyone wants em.
---
Oh shut it, you'd invade him alright! As would I #nohomo
---
They have been up like three months. It's time to clear out that old stock
---
Usually on by or around 9pm. 
---
Hey quick question, Did any of these people have the words "Zeanok" or "Duval" in their gamertags?
---
I've had issues with this one and the sneak attack challenge. It seems you can't one shot it and have it count.
---
I frequently used it during Fasnacht at the final stage against the bugs and it usually worked fine 
---
Even with perks they are reduced by a percentage which means that they will still end up being the same as if you didn't bulk them. 30 steal still is equal to 1 bulk steel. 0.05 to 1.5. With pack rat it ends up being 0.01 to 0.38 which means that it actually weighs more except it doesn't because the game only shows you 2 decimal places. It still ends up weighing the same. The only exception to this is aluminum and lead Which weigh less
---
The soych for more money
---
Lol whatever man
---
Yeah, a frustrating bug. Just as frustrating as when her health bar freezes and is invincible for the remaining 20 minutes of the event. (which still happens)
---
*way, WAY worse. We live in dark times...*
---
I'm so sorry for you and your daughter...what a disappointment! I post often that Bethesda has the Adventure and Survival levels now, next will probably be Hardcore--but how about an "Explorer Mode" that's light on combat &amp; killing, so others can play and enjoy too..there are many who like the scavenging, building, etc.? Last time I posted that,,someone wrote "maybe this isn't the game for you" and I wrote back, "I want this to be a game for me too." And for you and your daughter and many others. ‚ù§
---
Yeah, I'd say that's a zone you shouldn't venture to for at least another 7 or 10 levels.  It gets even harsher at Watoga, which is probably the highest-level zone in the game.  I think I was still exploring the Savage Divide around level 27.  I took my time though, I didn't immediately go to certain places.
---
But you know, regardless, I actually partially agree with the threadmaker in some instances.  Like for instance, with Whitespring, I think that region should be a fixed level given it's basically the borderline between the Savage Divide and the Forest.  It's also problematic because of that golfer ghoul thing.
---
Absolutely right!!! I posted earlier and chatted with you. Tonight I rebuilt my camp and left the node and it has SURVIVED EVERY LOGIN.
---
You‚Äôre a hero!
---
I have. I've been using a pneumatic chest for a while, and I still get staggered by the hotdogs.
---
Of course it is driven by a random number generator, but the question is, what is the [distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution#Introduction) of items and legendary effects?
---
Do you maybe need some perk cards? I can‚Äôt remember. 
---
Yep. I have a toon and friend or two that handle this type of thing.
---
Reporting doesn‚Äôt seem to be an issue, 
---
:-)
---
That would be great! When can you?
---
Pipe weapons can be built up to level 50, if I recall correctly. So at level 20 you should be able to craft level 15/20 items.
---
When you craft an item, you click "craft" and the next page will let you choose the level of the item.
---
&gt;**Unfair**: it's not... equal chance to perk out and equip your characters 
---
Yes, assuming you are the same level as your opponent. A drastic difference in level makes pvp extremely difficult for the lower level. Dont get me wrong, it only makes sense that a higher level player can more easily beat a low level player, but the fact that the low level player has almost no chance isnt very fair. The game is full of vets/high level players because there are not that many new ones. This pushes the entire survival mode into their favor, while low level players have to resort to adventure mode without much choice. This is flawed because survival mode should encourage all levels, especially because of the 20% xp boost which is more beneficial to new players than old players, due to them having more of a need to get i to the late game.
---
&gt;**p2w**
---
Official or not, thats unbalanced because very specific items are sought out for how overwhelmingly good they are. This can be fixed by balancing those
---
&gt;**Unbalanced**: its not....meta chasers will usually have the advantage
---
That's the definition of an unbalanced game.
---
 The last nerf would touch only the guns/explosives like my black powder rifle since its a high damaging single shot, while pushing the already mera automatic weapons and auto explosives even further into the meta. That means if you don't use these weapons only, you are at a higher disadvantage, especially if you fully built towards rifles like me.
---
Can only join on apoc. Rest appearing offline.
---
I tend to agree. I had a Mirelurk King (Lobster) that I was able to tame and send to my camp. 
---
He defended the camp and no one killed him intentionally. 
---
However, he totally GLITCHED frequently and would be floating in the air above my camp. Then he would be inside my house and blocking doorways. 
---
Eventually I asked a player to kill him. Now I‚Äôm petless. Would like to try again and this time either get a smaller animal or a Deathclaw. 
---
Oh probably not. Didint think about that
---
Are you people kidding me? IT IS A PVP GAME. You do realize FO4 still exists right? Same building mechanics. offline.
---
You are letting a child play an M rated game.   
---
This community has really gone to shit when this is trending and one of the top posts in awhile.
---
It is a POST-APOCALYPTIC WORLD. Why would it be sunshine and daisies? I really don't understand people.   
---
"It's mean!" Yea welcome to the world.   
---
I feel most people in online games are becoming so babied.   
---
Feel free to vote me down, but people complaining about these things pull dev resources away from the real problems of the game. 
---
online now gt: rcayton1
---
I'd only pc games could have this thing where you type to eachother, that seems like it could work. 
---
I totaly agree, pvp should be seperated from advanture permanently. Camp destructions should be removed as well. That would stop griefers from doing such a nasty bussiness.
---
Workshops are a different issue. It‚Äôs clear what the game mechanics here.
---
The vendors will also have the joint cap pool, so if you're just selling, you could only visit one vendor.
---
Is this a rare Drink?
---
I've only had 2. In about 3000 hours of Fallout 4 and 76.
---
Base the value on what you think it's worth. 
---
300 year old pie is better than 25
---
The game is for 15+ ?
---
I have a moderately popular spot, and roughly 40% of the time I log in and someone else has it. That's cool, I have it for very good reasons and I'm happy when I see other players taking advantage of it too. I always stay on the world to see what they've done with place... But goddamnit so many people have these ugly monstrosities that make no sense structurally. But the worst thing is they're always level 3 locked with punji boards all over the place. What's up with that? I leave my camp open and free to use for anyone, and have spent hours sculpting it into an immersive outpost for anyone that happens by it. Take the water, use the benches, play my piano, harvest my crops and make some moonshine! Locking your extractor is absolutely fair game but why the hell are you keeping me out of your whole camp? I can't steal anything, and if I want to destroy it that lock isn't stopping me from doing it. In fact you wasted resources going level 3 on the lock, a level 1 produces a bounty all the same! I just want to see your camp and use your benches and other stuff, it's faster then server hopping. 
---
Hm, usually when you complete it it disappears for awhile and then comes back. Annoying, regardless 
---
I just don't use power armor anymore. I "unplugged" months ago. 
---
They remind me of the Eva units in Evangelion. Always attached to a big power cable. I personally couldn't do it anymore.
---
Hahaha, I've thought these same thoughts.
---
Gosh I can't even read the previous comments based on your edits. One last thing I think I will suggest to bethesda: when you are in pacifist It would be helpfull if your camp was too, just while you are in pacifist mode so you can build in peace. 
---
Hope you guys continue to have fun building and playing Fallout, Im an old school gamer myself on xbox if you ever wanna game let me know!
---
Lmao
---
You fucking racist !!! WHY I SHOULD NOT WEAR DRESS ON MY MANLY CHARACTER !?!?!
---
Huh! I'm set to be online too, but Xbox glitches on this sometimes, so that's a good reminder for me to post: send any of us a message if you don't see us online and we'll send you a world invite!
---
so many ITGs in this thread
---
Mine has a wall made of foundations around it that has a garage door gate with a guard post above it, and the gate opens by pressure plate.  I think we're on the same level in terms of CAMPing, lol.
---
quality post right here
---
Do you really consider people destroying camps on fallout ‚Äúevil‚Äù? If so get a goddamn grip. 
---
Single player Minecraft is always an option. Probably a much safer choice for a fragile disabled child than a pvpve survival game. 
---
Look for me if you want serums at a good price, 500 - 1k, depending. This may adjust over time.
---
Hmmmm, I can keep a core for about 4ish hours of gameplay and I jetpack like it is my day job. Infact I have played over 200 hours and never been close to running out of cores. I even had a frame 5 minutes after the bta started. The saving grace for me has been rank 2 full charge and rank 2 power user. 
---
I feel the same way. I have two role play characters that I like to play, one an absolute drunk that I started out with named Al C O‚ÄôHolic, and the other being Ol‚Äô Gregg, from the classic Mighty Boosh. But, the fact that I made these names and can‚Äôt display them unless I‚Äôm showing my friends on my own TV is frustrating. It would be nice if they could implement that feature, but until then, I‚Äôll just really have to make my role playing convincing.
---
I guess starting a quarrel is part of the game, and since many people here say that the game lacks endgame content, it's not surprising that people seek player interaction. Now, if you disconnect and you're gone, they might understand that you were not in for the fight at all. If you fight back when you actually didn't want to fight... Well that's unfortunate, because that is just going to keep the fight going. Those guys can't know that there is a child playing. Even if no names are given here, I find it disgusting to blame others of "bullying a kid" when they just can't know that there is a kid playing. This game has an age restriction, maybe it's not a bad idea to comply with it. 
---
I mean seriosusly?! Dont even bother to listen to them. If there is option simply block them. Cant wait when adventure mode will be permanently pacified and divided from pvp. All peoples should have a choice and enjoy game the way they want to. Wanna do pve join adventure, wanna do pvp go survival.
---
I've got 3 in my pockets now everyone that wants to trade with me is never interested in them 
---
Hmm,  maybe I should have put a /s. That one was on me. 
---
Nonetheless, destroying the camp on a pve server still is a dick move
---
People want to protect their camps from the people that like to destroy them.
---
I'm still suspended (900 hours) and never did a thing wrong. Its been like 6 weeks. I've been playing since day 1 of Beta and the only day I have skipped playing 76 was the week after I got suspended, before I bought a new account. Since that I'm still a daily player playing 5+ hours a day.
---
I love Fallout 76, but Bethesda have made colossal fuck ups with this game. They are not a great developer, but at least this isn't Anthem. At least at its core, the game functions. Kind of.
---
I was on the 4th floor scrapping a bunch of stuff and a mob of ghouls took the elevator up and caught me not in power armor today. A short while later, I had found the wendigo with another player, and had cleared the whole place. I was at a shem workbench scrapping things, and everything respawned. Somehow every ghoul in the building was in me within about 30 seconds. Thankfully, I was able to jump back into my armor right in the nick of time. 
---
I'm having issues with the agility test and perform a sneak attack. Apparently nay Biv quests are glitched.
---
Maybe it is because you act like those guys had to know they're destroying a childs work.  
---
I get that this is a problem, but an adult could handle rationally and quickly disconnect.
---
So the hotfix really fixed this?
---
You and your droogy droogs can kindly bugger off.
---
This is amazing. Everyone needs to join and see.

If you can afford to drop for an xbox, you are more than able to save a bit more for a decent PC.
---
Comes with the territory of online gaming, deal with it. Let her build crap on FO4 if you dont want the risk of having people come along and blow stuff up. The worlds not fair and neither are online games.
---
I‚Äôd say let us set the prices from 1 cap to whatever the max value of the item is in game for the initial set up and then improve it from there, it‚Äôll help set up an economy in game that everyone can use and they can build on it if needed. Just a thought
---
Exactly. What really should happen is the Atom Shop needs a UI overhual... with better filter/catergories and capacity if that's actually an issue. What they are currently doing is the laziest/most anti-consumer friendly option.
---
I completely understand that, but locks and punji boards won't stop that from happening lol
---
I had the same problem.  Just stop doing the quests.  Level up in the dozens of other ways you can, get your build right and then go do the quests.  I ran through everything and regret not really getting the whole story as I had to constantly run or hide to counter the higher level enemies.  Everything from the Top of the World stuff on I felt underpowered, and I was.  
---
Also find a melee weapon and go kill scorched in Sutton/Helvetia.  They all drop common ammo and are only lvl 5 usually.  They do very little dmg and are a great way to farm/save ammo.  Even a lvl 1 machete will take them down; you are better at melee than you know.
---
Sure okay.
---
Did you play 76 solo or with friends? 
---
Because at first I played with some of my other mates but ended up actually enjoying it on my own rather than with them. But we would still join up for certain things like scavenger runs in certain locations or events. And then meet at the closest camp and then go out separate ways
---
So now FO76 is a job.
---
So you didn't. Another worthless human dissatisfied with life shitting on other people. Gtfo
---
Yeah, I don't get why everyone is so emotional about this either. The game is not made for children and PVP is part of the game. Not a good idea to let a child play and assume that people magically know.
---
I‚Äôm only level 15 but I would be glad to help you and your daughter anyway I can, or if you don‚Äôt need help I could just stop by your base and play some instruments to help rebuild your daughters faith I. The gaming community
---
i should have some
---
I thought Quantum paint was only for T51-b?
---
What armor are you crafting/using?
---
Maybe she should check out minecraft! It gives you even more freedom for building stuff, there can't be griefers and it's overall much more child friendly. Highly recommend!
---
You are basically implying most people have about $300 just sitting around NOW, but no oppertunity to actually save, which is stupid. If you are that tight on money, then an xbox or PS4 is not something you should be considering. If you do have the money to burn on one of those, you have enough income to offset that cost, meaning you can also just hold what you have and save some more. This isn't rocket science.
---
Dude! I went here and in about 3 hops I got one! THANK YOU!!!!

I offer cotton candy bites and Jangles the Moon Monkey to all those who choose to follow. We gather together in the shadow of the Great Station to worship the Stars and the inevitable coming of the Gray and Green Ones who will liberate us from an uncaring world.

Dang.  I did just find them in watoga. 
---
Ha ha Gary!

Vendors.  He is running a map mod that places colored boxes around various faction vendors. 
---
Sorry you feel that way about yourself.

I‚Äôd love to see faction related structures to build camps with
---
Instigating requires the enemy to have 100% hp. So even minuscule amount of damage to the 'enemy' your shooting at will negate the effect of instigating. 
---
Eg.  player your shooting at could have 1 rad damage and instigating will not trigger against him/her. 
---
That's my understanding anyway
---
Ah well maybe that went over my head then lol. Yeah it‚Äôs a dick move no doubt but it is what it is. People online sometimes are cunts, no need to get worked up over it.
---
I have never heard a parent refer to there child as ‚Äúmy kid‚Äù as well as your description of nearly the whole thing
---
Sounds like a typical made up circle jerk on reddit
---
No X-01 only
---
I came here to say just that, unfortunately I‚Äôm on ps4 but anyone else out there that needs a guard hit me up. I roll play more as a park ranger type, to help those out to explore, and knock the poachers down a few pegs. 
---
Maybe "legitimate" was a poor choice of words. "Mutually agreed upon" meaning survival mode. I find the workshop initiated PVP to be extremely buggy and unfair as it's generally low level players being farmed by high level ones. 
---
The equalizing they did only made TSE and sentinel sets stronger. It would be leagues easier fighting sentinel users and full teams of low-level ringers if they allowed one shot builds to return. They at least need to make it so black powder weapons can one shot. They only get one shot for fucks sake. My BPPistol has potentially 1,800 damage with all damage bonus mechanics stacked, but it cannot one shot someone from full health.
---
They most important change they made was allowing you to build critical meter with zero damage shots. There is a dude I have fought two days in a row. He uses everyone's nightmare - TSE with full sentinel/assassins set. I've killed him five times with my build and he has only gotten me once. You have to be smarter than they are. They like to move closer after every barrage they withstand. Hip fire some gamma rounds towards them, swap to your gun, wait for them to dodge the radiation damage, then fire. Black Powder guns are actually pretty disgusting in critical damage alone. I picked mine back up and added it to my automatic pistol build because a critical hit manages to hit that maximum damage threshold no matter what. You do not need to min max it. Just stack critical bonuses and pull it out when you need to kill someone at 50% HP. That sentinel guy gave up on fighting me today because I would take off just enough HP to where he would not be worried about death, then surprise him with a BPP critical.
---
Some general tips I can give against sentinel armor: get high ground; marsupial out of cover and shoot; use weapon types with stagger chance; build towards critical hit damage and an unbuffed black powder weapon can easily do 300+ unblockable damage (though reduced to the maximum damage threshold); force movement with radiation damage; do not try to go toe to toe with them.
---
The only people who don‚Äôt want this is shitty PvPers who prey on other players but can‚Äôt hold their own at all against other PvPers. 
---
I have another question. I found a two-shot .50 machine gun (which for some reason only weighs 1.8!) And it shoots these yellow bullets. Is that explosive then? Is a two-shot always explosive? 
---
I've had someone sit at a distance for 20 minutes using my CAMP as target practice and just sniping the parts to destroy them for no reason. I turned off pacifist and killed them, but then they just continued the same behavior. After killing then the third time I left the server. I couldn't figure that one out. This was before survival mode.
---
I guess the problem is that there is no reason to attack someone's CAMP except what you describe which is to clear an entrance. In Survival mode they should add some incentive and reward for doing so, such as the ability to steal your junk or something.
---
My fear is that they limit the number of items we can have for sale (just like the fermenter is limited to 10 items).
---
It isn't! That's kind if my point lol
---
Just bragging rights. When I get a sweet low level weapon/armor piece I tend to give it away.. If I have a preserved pie at the time I give it away with it as a package.
---
Sorry about your kid, but come on man. You can't blame people for doing what they wanna do if it's not breaking the rules. Maybe your kid can just play FO4, or any of the other building games? You could even use trainers to get unlimited resources. 
---
Fo76 at launch - garbage fire  
---
Fo76 now - they put the fire out  
---
Legend. Thanks Bruce

The only people a lock is preventing from entering are the kind who would respect your space if they were able to enter freely.

nice work with the carnival ,,,good boxing match
---
I know of at least 1 that is a seemingly static spawn and not in a machine.  I've eaten a few and keep 1 in my stash for nostalgia.  
---
Dude I get it you had an economics class in high school.
---
I've never experienced this what system??? Heavy load area?
---
Yo i get where you‚Äôre coming from, wrecking people‚Äôs camps is a total cunt move. But with that being said, you can‚Äôt expect people to abide by your preferences. You say just cause you can be an asshole doesn‚Äôt mean you should, but at least in free world online games people can do what they want. Maybe now you know your kid shouldn‚Äôt be playing fallout with you, maybe y‚Äôall should play sims or something. People are pricks man, it is what it is. Sorry this was such a bummer for you. Someone fucked my camp up last week and it was an kinda lame but I figured that‚Äôs just part of the game. I‚Äôm sure you figure that too, it‚Äôs just unfortunate the kid got involved. 
---
Same issue.. I haven't tested it yet but another individual on this sub suggested to get the required drink and go to the area you're reasonable sure you'll be able to land the sneak attack and log out. When you log back in don't fast travel anywhere, just wait until you fully load in and the quest procs and try it then. Again I haven't tested it myself, but the individual was confident this would work . 
---
I'm amazed Beth hasn't just done a ini check on values and if obe of tge values isn't matched with a value from the server it should just kick
---
Has to be melee. You have to sneak up on them with like a stealth boy or with those perks and land a hit. 
---
not true. Quad Faster Firing, baby.
---
First thing is managing your perks. Got batteries included? Knocks the weight waaay down (also works for plasma cores). Also may want to look into the one that extends length of power core use and the one that makes it so running doesn't use extra energy in PA. 
---
You play flats games after playing vr? It's so hard going backwards.
---
quad+faster firing. In my testing, I couldn't get anything to increase radiation damage in PVP. But I didn't specifically test Assassins.
---

---
I found most mine doing the holo logs with no one around, and also outside the circle, about 12-1 o‚Äôclock of it. Just walked those northern set of rooms back, and forth with no one around, and found them much faster. 
---
I found you have to make sure it is completely empty, and has been for a bit. Once you spawn in the fresh mobs it‚Äôs usually not that hard. Higher level can be tricky, sometimes it‚Äôll spawn you lower, and some times higher. It can be really weird. I also sometimes got a mix. You could also team with a low level, and have them spawn the mobs after you know it‚Äôs been clear for a bit. 
---
It is sad Bethesda designed a game this way just because they became obsessed with PvP
---
If you are going to design a game this way then you should have done your research and realise idiots will use raider as a excuse to grief other players
---
If you are a raider why are you using endgame weapons and power armour stick to using raider junk 
---
Bethesda you need to fix the ability for others to destroy camps
---
Think of your loyal fallout fans the majority of us dont want this system we want co-op the ability to play with our friends and enjoy the fallout world like we always have without idiots thinking they are playing COD.
---
All good Bailey.
---
Both failures in the eyes of the developers and the majority of fans 
---
Also can't compare until they have been out for the same amount of time and the first major updates will tell wether the games will have a rebirth or be dead forever now 
---
You‚Äôll find better stuff as loot from enemies. I think most people use crafting mainly with the intention of scrapping and learning mods rather than building a whole set from scratch. Or in a pinch when you‚Äôve hit a wall and you need a new weapon or two or armor piece. It‚Äôs also just expensive, junk-wise to build everything from scratch. So if you can, would focus on killing stuff. 
---
That sounds pretty amazing, I would definitely like to hear more. Would you say you do most of the rp in game or on a discord server, in a more text based way? Or perhaps there would be a spit of both?
---
You can get it off gram.
---
PC. An example of my last crash:
---
Running around doing some outdoor events  and once I started starving and was dehydrated, I open up my pip boy and start eating aaaaaaand freeze-crash!
---
I didn't do anything that would result in a load screen, nothing was loading/rendering and I wasn't lagging.
---
I have a support ticket in but nothing Bethesda has recommended has resolved my issue. This all started with patch 7. Prior to patch 7 the only thing that caused to crash so frequently was a bug with the charging Tesla mod.
---
I'm glad I remembered correctly. I almost told you the one small city on the far southwest of the map lol
---
That‚Äôs normal red/white Nuka paint. Quantum is the blue/purple for X-01. 
---
I don't see the point of this post. You are sad that your kid is sad. Cool. That can happen in any online game or in real life in one form or another. Then you say griefing is incentivized when it is literally the opposite. It is pointless to pvp/grief in adventure mode and it was one of the main criticisms the game got at launch. You also cannot rationalize why people grief because it can be due to any number of factors. Don't generalize, oversimplify and bring up "karma" and call these people immature and self-centered. For someone who's been playing online games for a while, you shouldn't even be phased by this. I understand your frustration however and an upcoming update should prevent this from happening again.
---
Does that actually happen?  I don't play the Survival Mode, and I've never seen it in Adventure (or before they were split).  Maybe it's the time of day we're playing.  And Jade is right.  A person who wants to destroy it won't be stopped by a lock, and I often miss the chance to check out people's cool bases (out of appreciation) because they locked them :p
---
Are you serious I'm never gonna get it then
---
Thank you!!! We've tried a lot of creative bases (mazes, vending stations, etc...) but this is definitely our most ambitious one yet - glad you like it :D
---
Okay I will def look into what perk tree is it under?
---
I like both. And if you don‚Äôt play flat games what are you doing playing 76?
---
Here's my current CAMP, from the front anyway:
---
[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/17rcXAd.jpg)
---
Hah, thank you! Yeah, Dead Mane's set those up before and they're always a hit - I *love* how people actually get up and sit in the stands to watch it all go down, too.
---
Most of the camp restrictions in place are probably there to make sure the AI can navigate them. I totally agree number 4 however, no reason not to do this.
---
Let the beef drop!
---
It happens too often. Even in Adventure mode. That's why they are adding in base protections when you are in pacifist mode. Just yesterday my camp was completely leveled by 2 jerks because I wouldn't engage them in pvp on the Adventure server.
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 but from what I remember you have to go up to the 3rd floor on the right side and flip a breaker to deactivate the laser grid blocking the elevator on the ground floor. Once you‚Äôve done that the computer is on the 4th floor 
---
Their pronouncing of 'member' really drives it home
---
What mothman poster? I don't see a single mothman poster.
---
I snuck up and hit them with my hands and an axe, both with chamelion and without. Nothing counted.

Hopefully the DLC for 76 can draw some people back in, but yeah both games are a big fail.
---
On the last day before reset last week I played on survival mode on Oceanic servers and only had 3 other people online for the entire play session. I logged out of that server at 1pm and logged back on at 4pm and got on the same server. All the workshops had my structures built.
---
That‚Äôs where I build, I built a little support shop. Working on finishing my shower, waiting for vending machine, and a few more plans. I would hate to be forced to move. I don‚Äôt even run external turrets anymore. Most people passing by seem to be friendly, and don‚Äôt mess with my shop. I‚Äôve noticed some people are scared to even enter even though I left the door unlocked to my main floor. 
---
I love the area it‚Äôs beautiful, easy to work in. Usually get to see some great builds, others who built around a RP-ish idea.  I get a lot of friendly neighbors there, and have teamed up with a few, or given my unwanted to stuff away. 
---
There are 3 TV plans. I got two off of Phoenix in Watoga, I think. I know it wasn't Grahm, for sure, and the modern TV off of Grahm. 
---
I'll help you out I'll send you a message so you can invite me 
---
Yes, YES!  I crashed out of the DMV quest earlier tonight on the last step.  It didn't checkpoint anything I'd done, meaning I had to start back from the beginning.  A nuclear pox on you, Charleston DMV!  BWAHAHAHA!
---
Exactomundo
---
Right in the YARBLES!
---
I can confirm this worked for me, thanks!
---
No. A two shot is not always explosive. It will tell you if it's explosive. As for a .50cal weighing 1,.8 that would be pretty nice 
---
I had to use a stealth boy. And I have the chameleon mutation AND chameleon armor. Those only proc when standing still, right? 
---
An armed nuclear mine. So when they opened the package it blows up in their face. Ha that would be gold. 
---
"other players can't see the names you give"
---
I accidentally ate mine that I won on the first try.... it hasn't been the same since.... 
---
I lay awake at night in tears thinking of that moment it was devoured and realised just what I had done. Truly horrific.
---
Never had another one since, every day I try, every day I hope and every day its shattered.
---
This is my hell now.
---
Damn you Perfectly Preserved Pie.
---
Ah-hah!  This happened to me the other day, and I had to reconstruct everything since it wouldn't let me put down my blueprint for some reason.  I was wondering why new content was moving to the weirdly obscure location I picked... now I know it's a glitch.  Thank you for the PSA!
---
I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs been mentioned but I would LOVE photos of what the plans are (at least for camp Plans) before purchasing them... and if not in game at least somewhere online! I can‚Äôt find what anything looks like :(
---
A lot of people stormed the place. Wether it was for me or not I got in. Thanks to everyone!!!!
---
Oh hey, that's what I do. Except it's not because I'm waiting for the server to sync. I wait because I'm not going anywhere without my damn radio playing. Now I guess it's for both.
---
Guess that works too lol
---
I see what you did with the Greek letters in that last pic.  I'm laughing my ass off now.
---
I have wares if you have coins 
---
Upvoted. Great read
---
Your chameleon stuff was messing with it. It won't work if it procs at all. Stealth boy was a pretty genius work around. 
---
Did they do so.ething about spawn camping?
---
Game was trash, I quit.
---
I believe Bethesda's support site has a bug section for reporting 
---
And whoever downvoted a cry for help. I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors.

But... but you'll get crabs.

Nice!  I missed this earlier.

More and more With all the pvp and I've split I'm reminded of Ragnarok Online from a few years ago, 
---
Not counting the official server, most private servers had a three-way split.
---
Pvp: death everywhere, noobs spawned camped into oblivion with more hardcore real papers meeting in certain towns to do battle 
---
Pve: player vs everything the standard game mode, dependant on server pvp couldn't be done before a certain level and even then it was a duel invite, no slap damage, i ask you respond and some sort of go signal was given. Typically for the casual player mostly
---
Rp: roleplay servers were great and bad, pvp everywhere unless you're a noob. But you PLAYED your character to the hilt, you a knight? You saved people or served a lord. Merchant? What kind? Do you sit or do you travel. Thief/brigand/raider? You were dressed appropriately and everyone joining a RP server knew you could be ganked at any time.
---
Traveling Merchants would hire on knights and mercs to protect them
---
Depending on server towns were protected places that either you couldn't kill inside or would get you in a heap of trouble if you could/did.
---
I think I am going to go play some RO.
---
I bought mine at a local Pawn Shop for $23 USD in Mid-December. Works fine. Love the game, but that‚Äôs just me. 
---
This is so sad. Thankfully, private servers are on the way eventually so your kid can build to her hearts content, though she'll lose the joy of having strangers visit and enjoy what she's made. Really sorry she had to see *that* side of the game when she just wanted to enjoy the mire wholesome side of life.
---
I like this idea.. I'd leave the same kind of low level stuff probably. Or excess mats I need to dump which I know help out low levels alot. 
---
Of course the people raiding understand the person put time into their camp, but at the end of the day, it‚Äôs an aspect of the game for a reason. Not only is it a way to get resources but it also adds a component to the gameplay which is at the very core of fallout itself- The wasteland is a very ruthless place.
---
With that said, if you are really looking for a game in which pvp doesn‚Äôt exist and positive player interactions / rp‚Äôing is the focus, Fallout 76 probably isn‚Äôt it, nor should it be.
---
I don‚Äôt think their goal was for your special needs kid to feel like shit. They were just playing fo76 one of the many ways Bethesda envisioned it to be played. 
---
I‚Äôm not trying to be be an asshole or seem heartless, but it‚Äôs just part of the game.
---
Someone once built a pretty nice church from scratch. It was pretty big and I thought it was impressive. I started taking pictures and video of it... then a couple people decided to bomb it into oblivion.
---
Same happened with a pretty nice trade post I found once, someone spent some effort on making it look nice and look like a realistic vendor outpost... only to have someone shortly after I found it level it to the ground.
---
Someone once leveled my camp... this was the biggest mystery because my camp is crappy and built just to house all my benches and is far from being glamorous.  After helping someone else defend their bench he decided to start hitting me doing 1-3 hp damage and then follow me back to my camp to destroy my camp...
---
I understand people get bored but really... isn't there other things to do? Not sure the enjoyment destroying someone else's hard work "Just because"... 
---
Ill check it out tomorrow look out for powerstroke406 
---
Only other easy bypass I saw was Watoga if Mayor For A Day was completed. 
---
Here we go again. Another one of those posts. It's like catching a thief and then thanking him when he returns your wallet. And no, the game is far from AmAzInG. It's better but still is a long way from being a compelling game with proper end-game content.
---
Right!? I just saw a gorgeous, long counter in an abandoned shop the other day with the short, saloon-style, swingy doors at the end! I was all but running my fingers along the edge. I think it was Huntersville, near my camp. Why can't that be a thing??
---
I'd settle for a vendor booth to set along side the main "house" or whatever someone uses for their benches, etc.
---
Better yet: separate vendor camp space. Make a way to also have a vendor camp that's a fifth the size of current camps so we can gather flea market style without taking so much space! (Then we can build more) and the player vendor update would work fine along with it, space would be dedicated to signs and snazzy decor to catch the eye. 
---
I got in a little competition with another player and got carried away, stopped when I got to 100. No value but they'll still stay in my stash for no reason forever.
---
I've been posting same thoughts for awhile now too. Someone posted back to me the other day, "maybe this isn't the game for you." But why can't this be the game for us too?! I want an Easy/ Explorer Mode to take off the anxiety of so much combat and killing and fighting monsters lol. I think there are a LOT of peeps that would play more, spend more and buy more copies of 76 with the Pacifist Mode, or whatever they want to call it. Let the warriors take care of the monsters and let others of us scavenge and build and socialize...it's about time we started building a town or whatever. üòä
---
Noticed the auto correct failure as soon as I posted. Worries me that dead comes up quicker than deed
---
Great for survival mode! It could be a misnomered item. Lol
---
ITYM gender.
---
Was expecting request for atom shop dildos.
---
Private servers that we were promised would solve this issue. There is no reason for us not to have the server to host or rent. Bethesda if youre listening you could be making money renting private servers right now. hint hint nudge nudge.
---
I can provide you the serums for 400 caps each. I'll also take screws and springs at 3 caps each, nuclear material at 2 caps each, or steel at 0.5 caps each in trade.
---
Yup, but then stuck someplace far away, without a work station.
---
No Cdkeys in Aussieland?
---
we do have Cdkeys but does it work with the bethesda launcher?

I agree.
---
I will occasionally play with random younger kids that ask to team up and I really don't want to be on the receiving end of an angry mother asking why their 8-year old keeps saying "Morning Wood"
---
"It's a long story lady, I already told him to call me *my name* but..." 
---
"Oh, you're a girl. That name is inappropriate but okay"
---
Da fuq? Who says I'm not trying to groom your child into some fucked up shit just because I'm a girl. 
---
(Joking)
---
But it is hysterical everytime I hear "Dude, I think that's a chick. What's up with her GT?"
---
Whit kind of dessert? Custard?
---
That's funny. I play on PC and have the impression that these kinds of problems only exist on XBox and PS4. Have played over 200 hours from start and have yet to witness a camp attack or any griefer in PC.
---
Has anyone ever made a questionnaire about number of griefers on each system? 
---
Dude shut the fuck up it‚Äôs a video game 
---
Yes you just have to follow the instructions. That's how I bought my copy for ¬£24
---
I‚Äôll call bullshit.

Ive has the best luck with getting grahm to spawn by lady Janet‚Äôs soft serve, also the vendor bot and the civil war reenactor spawns in the same general area

Just did camp venture had to server hop once and got halting plasma plan, robot sneak amour plan, mini gun, ammo, scrap and caps. So worth it thanks heaps mate gonna run this everyday.

On middle of checking out the others nowüòè
---
OR, don't allow your kid to play a game that's rated M for mature.  Seems like poor parenting to me. 
---
After what seems like hours finally I come across a reasonable response here! Yes, it sucks that people destroyed your kids camp but it‚Äôs like choosing to live in Florida if you can‚Äôt stand hurricanes. 
---
And then on top of that blaming the other players for that. If the child‚Äôs emotions are not mature enough to handle certain aspects of the game, then that‚Äôs no ones fault but the person who allowed them to play in the first place. 
---
I just couldn‚Äôt imagine if people in this thread tried rust for a week... 
---
If you really want to just build bases you should just buy Fallout 4. No PvP so no problem.
---
Hope you like it! 
---
I love moments like this in the game! 
---
Yeah they adjusted the timer to be effective instead of being pointless. Two thumbs up here.
---
I'll buy
---
I like the idea of survival mode. Though being able to move characters freely between was dumb
---
Probably won't work at level 31 because everyone uses level 3 locks.
---
I'll help too. Xbox gamertag: Paladin Bailey. I'll see if any of the guys from the Brotherhood of Steel Discord I'm in will help too. No one should be grifed especially for shits and giggles. I'll gladly stand guard!
---
100% agree. I've yet to be griefed by either my CAMP being destroyed or by being killed over and over again. And I think it's so awesome your daughter enjoys playing Fallout 76! 
---
I've always been more of a PvE kind of player in these kinds of games, as I don't find it appealing to do PvP, especially when the system is so broken in Fallout 76. 
---
Hope I run into you someday in-game! (definitely not because I have plans and stuff I don't need and want to give away)
---
I read this, and as someone who did the questline by myself and pretty much started and leveled through it, I have to ask - how are you only level 27 and doing the Free States? Do actively avoid enemies and clearing? I mean, I killed everything anywhere near where I was and was at least level 40 by the time I got there. It was challenging, but doable. Point is - kill more stuff - you're not leveled enough. 
---
Now I'm level 140 and Harper's Ferry can still be hairy if I'm not geared properly or the group I run with now is goofing too hard. The mire's no walk in the park. 
---
Hahaha!   üòÇ
---
Wish I'd thought of that! My loading screens are ominous pictures of the teddy bears you find posed, like the one eating a hot dog in an oven in Whitesprings...
---
I once ended up behind the armory selling terminals. No way out without fast travelling
---
Whitesprings Golf Club. Top floor, take a right into dining area, another right and head past duffle bag to sleeping bags with chems nearby. Usually one there if not looted &lt;3
---
I hate the booze challenges so I stopped bothering a while ago. I feel like they're just trying to justify a dlc that isn't worth much after the first week of starting it.
---
Happened to me twice yesterday once in game and in menu.
---
Ammo and beer, 1 cap a pop for ammo, 5 a pop for regular alcoholic beverages and 10 a pop for fermented beverages. My shop will be called Wasted Ammo.
---
I wholeheartedly and 100% agree that you should be allowed to play as you like. But that same position works in reverse and they should be allowed to play like they want.
---
Unfortunately, in game there is no repercussion severe enough for this kind of action to prevent asshats  doing asshatty things. In RL the repercussions of doing something like that are deterring people from behaving like asshats.
---
Losing some caps is no deterrent as you either play with 0 caps and thus make being wanted no issue or you have excess of 25k caps and you can easily get 1500 a day more by just selling junk to vendors.
---
That said, I really disagree letting kids play this game. The game is PEGI 18 (at least in Europe) just like Fallout 4, Fallout NV and Fallout 3 were. That means there is content and actions not suitable for ages under 18. One of those actions is the ability of other players being asshats.
---
If you let your kid play a game aimed at much more mature gamer you are solely responsible for any bad feelings and hurt that comes to the said kid. 
---
Those asshats griefing and farming her were using a broken mechanic that most players, me included, want to get removed, but also they were playing the game in a way that makes them happy. Asshats are and will always be asshats and given an option to be douches they will also be that.
---
That being said I now welcome the negative comments and magic internet points my opinion will get here.
---
Sorry this happened to you man. I was in the process of building my camp and cooking at the same time so I was in and out. Then I've had some random three lvl digit guy come across my camp before and got offended because I wasn't talking. Then he proceeds to start destroying my almost-finished camp. I left the world before he had the chance to undo everything. That's the only way I avoid trolls like these, is to leave the world and rejoin another. Putting them on ignore seems to help too. In the meantime I hope this tip finds and helps you out.
---
Thanks for the info - makes acquiring the weapon for this week a breeze.
---
Hah, thought so. :) What's your perk loadout?
---
No, I kill everything I can without getting a bounty and actively seek out side quests. I have no idea why I'm not leveling. Was there tons to do in the ash heap maybe?
---
Plans. Like the plans I had to actively go searching for cuz I needed them, which was a pain at lower levels. And probably my excess ammo.
---
I had my CAMP further up the stream before, near the robots repairing the wall. Then someone put a nuke a little too far south while I was busy doing something else. That's when I decided to move my CAMP a bit further away. Now it's not at all that common with the Whitespring nukes. Not as important to have my CAMP there for fast travel and so on. Now I just like the spot. Nice pond with benches. Nice flowery bushes as a kind of garden. Good reasonably flat space. Not too much bushes and branches sticking through the floor or walls. (I put it there before the update removing grass and stuff.)
---
I keep getting no ping region 1 5 1
---
Instigating works great on a lever rifle. It's possible that it only applies to one projectile for weapons that fire multiple projectiles, although it's also possible that explosive is broken in the other direction (+20% explosive damage per projectile). Don't trust the paper values anyway.
---
I play solo ever night and have a blast exploring, looting, and doing events and stuff. I also really enjoy building my camp.
---
There are still bugs, but they‚Äôre slowly being worked out, and as long as Bethesda doesn‚Äôt slow down this game will have a decently long life cycle with rich content imo.
---
Just don‚Äôt  go into the game thinking ‚Äúthis will be rubbish‚Äù or you will probably find every reason to call it that and ignore all the amazing stuff the game offers.
---
You own the game, just put it on and see for yourself. 
---
It's not random, aside from the perk packs. The screen just doesn't show all the cards at once. Use the left/right scroll keys to see the other ones.
---
You'll need 3 coal to manage scaly skin

Just shift server and forget asshate that sometime populate the world. They are a small part of us, unfortunately 
---
if this happens again quickly exit to main menu and block those guys until the patch that prevent camps getting destroyed comes

I started her just for CAMP building and had help from friends moving over plans from my first character and got many from them too, but I also wanted to try out melee as my first character was a stealth sniper. It turned out to be quite fun to play too, so she's been leveling quite quickly. I'm starting to feel that that CAMP is soon finished, so I might post that too.
---
Did I miss a memo? The last preview post only mentioned changes to vendor bot cap pools and Whitesprings arriving next week. Or was there a leak?
---
Has to be done in the spot highlighted on the map
---
I'm working on a yt clip based run through of cement locations. That's a thing you nearly never need... Til you really really do. Soits nice to know where to just get a load when you need it (free).
---
Yeah, but that's just it...there are a lot of us that don't want that risk always hanging over our heads lol. We want to chill a little more; certainly ALL of the "best and the brightest" of Vault 76 weren't warrior-types.
---
Yeah thats really bad, i had an Attack Dog who glitched up 3 floors to my bedroom , i snapped some pics and thaught he was good on the reload as id reloaded a few times to see where he'd spawn and it was the bedroom every time .. Then i loaded in the next day and he'd completely vanished :(
---
You are most welcome. Glad to be of help!
---
Just take an empty workshop. You'll get the xp and stims and water and resources and plans. Don't be a douchecanoe. 
---
I‚Äôd say in general the game will run a lot smoother for you, there‚Äôs a new quest where you can learn to brew drinks, and a new pvp survival mode if you‚Äôre into that! There‚Äôs another update on the 9th with more content coming too
---
I mean we shall see
---
The "no destroying camps thing" is coming sometime soon. As long as you are in pacifist mode of course.
---
I hope it will be very soon, preferably before player vending starts up.
---
Um what. I saw it for like $45 AUD in EB Games just the other day lol
---
I‚Äôm not at home tonight so I don‚Äôt want to miss anything. 
---
My damage related perks are mentioned above, but I can dish the whole build to you tomorrow when I get home if that‚Äôs alright. 
---
I played both at the start and am waiting to see which one has the best first major update to decide which one will get my spare time 
---
I wish I could hear other people talking. :(
---
Glad that my comment got some positive feedback for once and glad to see others not letting Bethesda get away easy
---
I'm kind of curious as to why lol
---
I can actually explain this. Her current target value gets corrupted so she flies outside the map because those are the coordinates she's been given. Same issue tends to happen with mob bodies going back to the spawn point (point of death gets corrupted) and the random events that happen at the middle of the map (event location gets corrupted) 
---
It‚Äôs bizarre. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the really young and naive or the fanboys that can‚Äôt accept Bethesda‚Äôs flaws. Probably both.
---
You have to listen real closely, it's a light and hollow badoonk sound
---
Not every weapon has mods that can be learned from scrapping. 
---
Crushing blow actually wasn't a bad weapon. Too bad you got rid of yours
---
Thank you for your response! Does the pvp aspect of it affect your experience at all? Is there a way of opting out of you don‚Äôt want to do it?
---
I will, but as I said I was just interested in hearing other experiences of the game now it has been developed!
---
Foundation 1, place at lowest point. Add full wall, plus flat roof. Add second flat roof to first in the desired direction of stage. Under second roof add half wall. Snap second foundation to half wall base. Note: ground conditions vary, your foundation will only go up so high no matter what you do, extension toward a downward slope will likely not work.
---
Viola, stage height.
---
I made a bandstand style saloon for a friend, used this "cheese" technique for a long time. I've built around 60 different structures of my own, several upon request.
---
This is actually why my CAMP is currently more of a 'travellers rest' space - no locks, no traps, not even a door in the whole place. It has a few turrets to keep the local wildlife away, but that's it. My first CAMP was levelled by some players - like literally not a thing left standing, before they proceeded to very slowly kill a confused me with slap damage.
---
I wasn't overly bothered, but it did make me decide that besides a place to gather workbenches CAMPS don't really mean anything. Nobody else can get in my Stash, so it's not like anyone can 'steal' anything, and crops regrow - what am I protecting?
---
Also if you get super duper you can sometimes get 4 instead of 2
---
Put a foundation at the bottom of the stairs then delete from the top floor down
---
That does make sense. I always thought it was a thing to tell us Hey there‚Äôs a SB over there kill it or run away. 
---
Sorry ps4 :(
---
Well I don't know, so I'll give you that one Psychodelic_Samurai.
---
You unlock every card at level 50 then when you level if you pick a new card you can go through the list and even filter based on special Stat 
---
Thanks for the info, I'll have to find it and watch. 
---
I hate pvp, there is passive mode in adventure mode that lets you ignore it pretty much all together! They are also making it so bases can‚Äôt be destroyed in adventure mode soon as well. 
---
Stay out of survival as that is pvp only. 
---
You don't have to keep repeating the whole quest. Once you have the keycards, check the secret room *before* you generate the code. If the key is missing then hop servers until you find one that's still closed, and then quickly go get your code and come back.
---
Well, if you have cable, it's on the Travel Channel.    Or you can find it on a torrent site, since that is where I got it.

Oh hey, the app I'm using to browse reddit doesn't show the other comments, so I didn't see you had posted your build already. Thanks and take your time! I love getting build info since it gives me ideas (I have a bad tendency to want to be good at everything, which you can't do in this game).

In order to finish the critical hit challenge, you have to spent the critical hit. example: yesterday Biv gave the challenge. I went outside of the tattoo parlor, found 2-3 low level ghouls, open up the VATS and start shooting them. My critical meter fulled up, but i had to actually spent the critical hit (in pc with space) to my next target in order to count it :)
---
i hope it helps.
---
These are great! I love photomode, wish we had more space in the gallery though... *hopes the new camera update will address that*
---
I had/have the same problem. I was involved with the whole fight and more and nothing dropped. 
---
So Bethesda, what's the storyline here? As vaultdwellers we obviously weren't all killing each other inside the vault so why all the craziness when we got out? And if there were supposed to be 500 of us, the"best &amp; the brightest," then you can't tell me EVERY mutant monster wouldn't be freaking dead by now! Come on, we were supposed to be repopulating and rebuilding the Wasteland...let's just get on with it ok?
---
Soap n toilet paper
---
I have an executioners gamma gun in case I encounter a bloodied build opponent.
---
Executioner: +50% damage when target is below 40% health
---
Bloodied builds use radiation to keep their health below 25%.
---
So extra damage + 125 radiation ( if deep dish) the opponent will die of radiation 
---
Its rough, but I hope when the full pasifist update comes, it'll be just PvE. 
---
Nice, maybe mods too. We can't always use them and the weight adds up, but who doesn't want an extra flame or a longer bar?
---
As I could link my ESO account so it's in Steam and the Launcher, hopefully they will let us do that for FO76 too. 
---
Genius ! Love the idea !
---
This would be nice. For every camp item you destroy or player you attack you get a little bit closer to becoming a wendigo and when you turn you become this awesome creature that can't use weapons or armor and show up as an enemy to all players. Your only bonus will be not taking damage by radiation. That would be fun.

Well the game has a high age rating. So I guess the game is kinda showing her the realities of life. Mature. She will bounce back and build something even better. Otherwise it might be better playing something else. There are lots of alternatives. 
---
A helpful hint from the neighbors downwind :)

Do you have an open spot of dirt inside your home?

I know of the couple times I left an exposed plot of dirt inside my home (indoor farming), I had enemies actually spawn inside.

You can progress the complete the quest without loosing anything, but it does suck that this is broken currently

Dont be such a carebear.

If your going to cry over a fucking video game maybe you are not adult enough to be playing it. 
---
Someone else posted about this and said that moving your camp box itself could cause this to happen

I wrote a long response to your post but then decided that it's better just to link you this "This game is rated PEGI **18** which restricts availability to ADULTS ONLY and is not suitable for anyone below this age. This rating has been given due to frequent strong violence and strong language.". Me as a parent would never let my kids play this game and expose them to everything that is going around in it. There are way better and more suitable games where your daughter can build things without being harrassed. I put this on you entirely. Not the raiders who hit your daughters camp. 
---
Monongah Overlook (Lookout??) is one of them.
---
Awesome!
---
Doesn't seem like we got any karma... 
---
You've probably built your CAMP on top of one of the spawn points. If you moved it you shouldn't have that problem anymore. It's too bad if you'd loose a sweet spot for a CAMP though.
---
No problem 
---
oh no, please no reward for destroying camp, Rust learned me, i don't want to be scared to lose my loot. As soon as game don't put you on same server (it does to me at survival) it is ok. Because you can avoid griefers, there is not real reason to destroy someones house and if you are hiding there with bounty, before you server hop, your camp is completly destroyed and now you are running with bounty without house. 
---
Well that‚Äôs a great idea, and I think it would not be difficult to implement into the game ! Bethesda could add a ‚ÄúAsk permission to build with your own ressources‚Äù or ‚ÄúAsk permission to build with the owner‚Äôs ressources‚Äù when trying to open te build menu (better formulated of course). What do you guys think about it ?
---
I built my camp really out of the way to avoid this,  like you'd have to know where to leave any form of common area to even begin looking for my camp, and it's because I don't want it to get destroyed.  My base was destroyed by a scorchbeast once and I'll be damned if I would work my ass off to build it again because some guys decided it'd be fun to destroy.  I've had bases that I would love for others to visit,  but as it stands I can't bring myself to have it all laid to waste because someone wants to see my work go boom.  
---
Which might be why Bethesda have said they are removing it. 
---
It was orchestrated to inflict pain.
---
Play survival mode then. It'll be your only option soon, and I'm glad
---
Gt: TheReliantOne 
---
I will be on at 07:00:00 AM EST 
---
You will both be there. You will not talk to me. I wear a trenchcoat and hat. I am vey mysterious. I will follow you around and protect. I also make guitar sounds over the mic whenever I kill something. Like the mysterious stranger from previous titles. I also only use a .44. You will pay me in caps and Stimpacks for my service. Also you will tell me a riddle ever half hour. On the half hour. If the riddle fails to puzzle me, we will be forced to part ways. I will kill you if we are on survival mode.
---
See you soon.
---
Been on both sides of this before. Both tried to snag someone else's trade by bidding higher and sold to higher bidders. The market isn't always nice. Everyone trying to make a profit. Its just business. 
---
Yeah but the paint doesn't look good on the outside
---
Same post, different day.
---
We are a  two Xbox home as well. I purchased my Xbox in November specifically to play FO. I have a little over 300 hours in the game and about a week ago my boyfriend decided to start playing. He's been playing Ark and I just can't get into it so I am happy he's roaming the Wasteland with me vs me hunting/collecting  dinosaurs with him. I did not start a new character so I'm a level 70 to his now level 20 and I am so protective of him.  
---
This sorta happened to me but the "raiders" tried trade first and DEMANDED ITEMS.  I got in a protection scam.  I'm sure that it's NOT as bad as seeing your lovely little daughter be griefed.
---
This is the part of the game that I dislike.  The game was not intended to be used this way.  The game was built so that you can CHOOSE to participate in that role-playing.  The camps are the hostage that these griefers use to make you okay or else.  Then they keep in pacifist mode until they can one shot you.  That's abusing EXPLOITS, NOT ROLE PLAYING
---
No, many of us would just like a more chill mode, without so much killing and combat and griefing. A Pacifist Mode that would let us play a gentler, kinder style. üòá
---
I liked your story, well written. It doesn‚Äôt make any logical sense, you‚Äôre right. What you‚Äôre missing is that legendary effects rule this game. Assassins/Sentinel/Cavalier armor combinations reduce incoming damage from players to nearly nothing for average weapons. The game is much more complicated than how you are playing it. If you want to compete in survival then you‚Äôll need to completely re-evaluate. Power armor is not viable in PvP no matter what anyone tells you. I would start a new character if I were you, using the website nukes and dragons to carefully plan your build around good armor you have found along the way. Losing 700+ caps per death is ridiculous. 
---
My primary source of income in game is aid items. That with the hard bargain perk will get you your 1400 caps a day.  
---
So while I agree with you there are asshats in this game (I've dealt with my fair share damn it), a few things...
---
1. This is a M rated game. idk how old your daughter is but special needs made me think she's probably mentally younger then her actual age? That's an assumption. I have Aspergers and my mental age is so-so. In some cases I'm more mature then my age...in others...I'm a kid. I'm currently 27. At any rate if she's below the age of 17 (mentally or otherwise), I don't think she should be playing this game. That's up to you as a parent but this game is bloody and violent. If you want her to have a fun building game, Minecraft is great! Or check out Garry's Mod. It's a really cool game.
---
2. I also thought Bethesda did something to change it so asshats couldn't wreck your camps...at least in adventure mode.
---
3. If you want to really prevent this, you'll need to find a secluded area where people don't go and you don't have enemy spawns. I put my base in the forest off the beaten path because I want to be alone. I do get enemy spawns but a few turrets can take care of them...they're low level enough since it's in the forest.
---
I'm just waiting for the days when they either bring private servers in or they make adventure mode 100% non PVP, including no wrecking bases (excluding workshops...since those you need PVP for).
---
It's not a bug, it's a feature
---
Can we add some 2 star items with "+25 radiation resistance" don't correctly apply the resistance in the tooltip, or actually give the bonus?
---
Damn. This honestly hits home. I play friday the 13th The Game quite regular. Sometimes I find it funny to scew over my team mates. I admit I find it funny but i've actually never really considered a situation like this. I'm sorry that's happened to your kid, I hope your OP has a positive effect on othersn
---
Seems pointless and a waste of Bethesda time and resources. 
---
I haven‚Äôt found selling junk to be very profitable (except the stuff that I need and don‚Äôt want to sell). I sell excess chems and purified water. I am now level 42 but at around level 35 you can take the Chemist perk which will allow you to make double the amount diluted stims, radaway, and rad-x. I took the pharma farmer perk early on so I was able to stock up on chems. You can also collect animal meats and flora to sell usually for at least 1 cap each. Maybe more if you cook it! I‚Äôve also taken the hard bargain perk but it doesn‚Äôt seem to make a significant improvement in prices for me. Good luck! 
---
I mean, explosions already send dead enemies ragdolling to the moon...why not living ones too? 
---
Just wow
---
It‚Äôs a little Grindy but server hop at the overseers camp and look for a dead civil war guy over by the truck and cross your fingers for a hat plan. Make a bunch of hats and sell those to vendors. 
---
And for that very reason 9 year olds aren‚Äôt supposed to play rated M games. It‚Äôs meant for mature players who can handle misfortune in the game. 
---
If OP let her play a game that was better intended for a younger audience this ordeal could have been completely avoided. It‚Äôs ridiculous to assume that Bethesda must implement changes because of OP‚Äôs irresponsibility. 
---
‚ÄúCome at me bro (virtually)‚Äù
---
I bought it on release day for AUD $70, go bargain hunting, check target, big w, eb &amp; jb.
---
Which I quit playing for that very reason, so let‚Äôs hope not.
---
Thanks a lot for this. It was really detailed and  helpful. How would you tweak my build?
---
Communist propaganda. 
---
Agreed, Hard bargain perk and sell chems, other aid items, food (use the good doggy perk as your main source of food, you‚Äôll thank me later). Also collect and sell armor items. Don‚Äôt forget to drink all your Nuka drinks, as the result is an extra cap. Build a camp with a water purifier and sell the excess purified water. That‚Äôs a good start
---
So, you want a camp, that's not a CAMP?
---
You also want a Tinkerers bench, that's not a tinkerers bench? 
---
You also don't want a FT point.
---
Why not just use the campsites around the map, instead of asking for stuff that we already have?
---
Are you talking about Adventure or Survival mode or just venting?
---
I just came back into f76 started survival as lv1 However is Bethesda going to restrict to new character only after beta?
---
You also get caps for holding a workshop and doing events. It‚Äôs only like 30 or 40 caps but it adds up if you‚Äôre like me and you always have one or two workshops and you‚Äôre doing all the challenges and events. Plus gouls and supper mutants will have caps so grinding areas like white springs and west tech can be lucrative in the long run. 
---
Went to cemetary as well by far my favourite place thankyou for that. Got deathclaw plan railway plan a cap stash a legendary and heaps of xp.
---
Legend right here boys I think he's a 4* üòéüëª
---
It doesn't look good on the inside either, Easily decorated.
---
What's not fun is being over encumbered with 50 level10 hunting rifles and not knowing if your wasting your time
---
If by extra legendaries you mean the weekly survival challenges, they'll have to entice better than that. I could buy all my favorite legendaries on the market reddit for caps. Unless you're talking about there being increased legendary spawns. I haven't seen anything like that from my own or anyone else's perspective. 
---
I expect there to be PvP related events added to survival in the near future. I wonder if anyone has done that Civil War event at that one fort in the north (somewhere between toxic valley and savage divide). And then there's the whole faction warfare thing they talked about in one of their newsletters a long time ago. 
---
I hope they'd allow you to do the raids solo. I play exclusively solo, but with it being new for the first week or so its out, it shouldn't be hard to find a group sitting at the location waiting to do it. Just team up with whoever is there. A week or two down the line though, that's a different story XD. 
---
thank you!! I have hard bargain and it doesn't seem to be doing anything so I appreciate you telling me about the chemist perk?? I think that should help a lot!
---
Yes but plans are expensive and weapons use screws and ven then same issue of when to stop
---
Thank you!! you're really speaking my language, I've accidentally started collecting civil war dresses and hats lol 
---
Recently there has always been a glowing wendigo everytime I go to whitesprings golf. That adds a nice twist to waves of charred ferals.
---
Want to fast travel?  Jump to Normal server, fast travel, and jump back.  Why the made it so you found freely switch between the servers is beyond me. 
---
Any mode lol, was reading a topic by father about his kid's CAMP demolishing and later bounty camping. And it tilted me a little
---
thank you!! I haven't noticed hard bargain doing much for me but I guess that's because I mostly sell stuff like Psycho and Bufftats? I have Pharma Farma so I think with the both of them I can manage to get aid stuff to sell?
---
Top hat is best. Just one cloth to make. I sell them for 35 caps each with hard bargain. 
---
Oh god ! This Is too good to be true üòÇ
---
I run in to a Wendigo in the same spot as mothman on route 65 (66?) and every time mothman gives me this look from afar like "you seeing this shit?" lol 
---
I'll take a marsupial, do you have speed demon as well?
---
I think bufftats sell for 8 and with level 3 hard bargain they sell for 10 caps. It‚Äôs not much but it adds up fast. The think I sell the most is anti radiation drugs. I grind gouls a lot so I always seem to have radaway in spades. 
---
as someone with autism myself I do understand this and I'm sorry for your daughter but I will just say that survial only really servers for the rich and the cunts of the game to fuck with each other and also that you can go back into the camp editing mode and repair all the stuff
---
I did read and cluelessness is not an adequate defense for his mistake. They clearly don‚Äôt know how the game works because they were wrong what you are saying literally contradicts itself. All it would have taken was a simple look at the patch notes show me the line were it says: CAMPS can no longer be destroyed
---
 There is a reason that not knowing a law is does not protect you from it, reality doesn‚Äôt care about cluelessness. If you eat a poisonous plant its going to kill you whether you knew it or not before hand.
---
ah ok, awesome, I'm gonna have to find the plan for that. thank u so much!!
---
Simple case of don‚Äôt hate the player, hate the game. 
---
Did the kid build at Whitespring? 
---
Often, when someone has a camp setup near Fissure Site Prime with Turrets, it is a very big double edged sword. Firstly, yes, the turrets do assist in chipping away at SBQ‚Äôs health. But the bad news is that she will not land nearly as often. 
---
I believe this has to do with the game coding. She will not land within the perimeter of a player camp, and if players are mainly concentrated around said camp, she will simply land very infrequently, which can make for a much tougher fight. 
---
they are in the game.  North of the meditation place. use to be a small patch of trees with a circle in the middle from time to time.  I find them now to the wast of the patch of trees close to the cliff edge separating the sides of the map. 
---
Only sucky part is that would only spawn maybe like 1/100 times I go see if they are there.  Normally it's a scorch beast or a flat woods monster.  At the new location I am getting Behemoths to spawn there too now. 
---
If its the high level turrets that is, then they're asking for it.
---
If its those cheap ones that chew out the mobs slowly, that's less of a problem
---
I would love for them to remove all legendary effects and mutations, or at least have a sub mode (hardcore) or whatever for the people that want it. Sadly can't keep everyone happy. 
---
Funny thing is, you‚Äôve swooped in with your antagonising messages trying to get a rise when I actually agree with you. I would have much preferred character SPECIALS to be permanently bound or at the very least expensive to reroll endgame. 
---
This is why I regret to have bought the game in the first place. I‚Äôm nice and comfy in my FO4 world. 
---
here‚Äôs some that i could think of off hand:
---
- a wendigo usually spawns at whitespring golf club
---
- snallygasters can spawn at the toxic lake (whatever it was called) south of kiddie corners
---
- snallygasters will always spawn at toxic larry‚Äôs meat place (dont remember the exact name) just west of the mire, there‚Äôs a picture of a wooden house on the location if i remember right
---
- a grafton monster will always spawn in charleston close to the dam
---
- a grafton monster will usually spawn south of charleston station under the railway bridge, will walk along the river next to the power plant
---
- flatwoods monter is random spawn only, on random encounter locations
---
- mothman is also random but can also attack your camp
---
Haha oh man, yeah, that's unfortunate. 
---
This has been a "thing" since, the dawn of online games in the late 90s. You're just going to run into kids who are obviously too young to be playing certain games at certain age ranges. Summer is also approaching so for NA/Canada at least you'll see a bigger influx of kids gaming a lot more since they aren't in school for quite a while.
---
Ah :o probably won't work then
---
Stun? I only want to kill!
---
If your on PS4 feel free to add me psn sneazel and put plans in the comment. I‚Äôll be on the next few nights. Working tonight. Maybe we can help each other find some plans. If one person finds a body the other can hold the server so we can check it until we get what we want. 
---
If you bought this recently, like me, it's pure awesome. Barely any bugs, pure fun questing, shit building compared to ark/rust (but still enjoyable).
---
Folks are impatient as fuck.
---
I knew it was a shit show, so I studied, and waited. It paid off. Fuck all the impatient bandwagoners.
---
It's developers listen to all the suggestions by half the fools on this sub, the game would get boring after two days and no one would play it, they all want everything handed to them.
---
Staircases are the actual bane of my existence in this game, with how many times I've had to start an entire build over again because it'll snap somewhere it ought naught snap.
---
Therefore making the entire structure "inaccessible" should I remove it.......why me staircase, why do you hate me.
---
Honestly if there was any distribution bias it would have to be done on the same server due to the possibility of the servers being seeded
---
It was active enough supervision that he was able to describe the situation in the op.  It's unfortunate to see responses focusing on blame like this, instead of opportunities to improve.
---
Bro you ever hear about Minecraft?
---
I have a jet pack for fucks sake and a set of mutations that practically let's me moon gravity over buildings, I sont need you in my life staircase!!
---
I just bought my last piece of Urban Scout armor at the bunker after 40+ Enclave events and never getting a damn right leg XD. Was actually pissed it took me that long to realize I could just buy them, and the forest versions too. 
---
What currently annoys me is the mods for the scout armor don't specify at all what body part it goes to. They all just say Scout Armor but don't specify whether they're for arms, legs, or chest piece. 
---
Fun fact: vengeful mothman *actually stalks you before attacking.*
---
If you hear random wind chimes of no origin, watch your ass.
---
Cool, might head there, I've never actually seen mothman. Well I've seen wise mothman.
---
the phrase "mothman can attack your camp" just put so much primal fear in my heart,, I've seen the Grafton monster near Charleston, in my post I called it Poseidon bc im used to using that map marker instead of Charleston Station lol I've noticed that one bugs out and won't attack sometimes? so we've become great friends 
---
The Flatwoods monster is weirdly the only one that seems to be 100% random? I wonder if there's a reason for that or just for the spookiness factor 
---
Dang sorry!  I know you can grab them at the ranger hq, bed and breakfast,  and Clarksburg for sure to scrap them to learn the mods. 
---
I had Berkley springs, my quest said bloodbugs, the map said bloodbugs, the little graphics said sheepsquatch.
---
I know who to believe.
---
*he exists*
---
That's one way to deal with guests who overstay their welcome 
---
I play ps4! my psn is morgantim916 (I'm usually on weeknights &amp; weekends I'm not at work) I'll add you the next time I'm online! :) 
---
Escape from ~~New York~~ West Virginia.... I'm definitely making a character called Snake Pliskin now.
---
I actually used to be one of the detractors who hadn't even played the game but then my gf said I should get it because she was tired of playing overwatch with me. I got it and have enjoyed so much of it since
---
Ok thats fair enough you want the rules changed personally i think the game would be boring without people attacking your camp occasionally. Like I said the game is rated as mature because it simulates drugs achohol violence and exposes you to other people who can be dicks.
---
Don‚Äôt strawman me at no point did I defend their actions and say this is a nice thing to do, i simply said it should be allowed in a game for adults and if some adults cant handle their camp being destroyed in a game they imo need to get some thicker skin.
---
My post was primarily critising you yes, because you are acting like a victim when in reality what happened to your daughter is your fault, instead you are blaming the griefers for being terrible people which they are but the thing is you cant control what others do but at the end of the day: YOU allowed your impaired daughter to play a mature game, YOU didn‚Äôt check the patch notes to ensure camps cant be destroyed.YOU put your daughter in a situation where this could happen and it did.
---
You can take my advice or not that‚Äôs up to you. Maybe you will get the rules changed , maybe you wont but imo whats the point of a fallout game if there is no conflict no raiders and no wasteland brutality. 
---
+1
---
I have to agree with you on this one! As someone who likes to explore the map, and is also in that weird area between low and not so low level, I gotta say the level/difficulty disparity is apeshit in certain areas
---
I've noticed in night hours I run into him at Seneca Rocks pretty often! if you go across the red bridge near where the fast travel point is, I've seen him around that area plenty of times! 
---
If a kid is being supervised by a responsible adult, who really cares? I know a few kids who play with parental supervision. A bunch of us look out for them, help them along, and defend them from griefers who don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre wading into. The experience becomes pretty positive. 
---
the first time i got a mothman in my camp it was absolutely terrifying, the second time it was more just annyoing because they hit pretty hard with their scream attacks...
---
Or Dolph Lundgren
---

---
Instead of moaning just log off and back on the server 
---
Honestly as soon as you see camp is being attack message just alt f4 
---
It‚Äôs not hard and this is what happens on a online game 
---
Huh...I honestly can't think of the last time I saw one that wasn't marked as "trade only" even on a listing that had cap items, but I'm also not hunting actively for it, so. 
---
this is terrifying I didn't know that was something that could happen!! the Grafton monster hangs out outside my house and he's allowed but mothman...if I see those eyes outside my window I might just go feral 
---
You couldn't be bothered to pay attention to the region your grey market key came from? Lol. Deserved. 
---
I can describe the Hindenburg disaster, i certainly wasn't there to supervise it. 
---
It's unfortunate to see so many posters blind to the fact that op allows his special needs child (age unknown) to play a mature rated game with built in unrated online interaction. The rating system is there for a reason. 
---
Op has a responsibility to, in their own words, curate the media their child is exposed to, including online interactions, especially with a special needs child. 
---
It would be glorious if they could have it so that people can merge camps to make a town... We'd need more tools to create level ground though cause there's not a lot of good places for such big endeavors
---
I‚Äôm level 93 and I‚Äôd be happy to help. 
---
My dad had a similar experience when he was a lower level. He has a screen shot of some guy staring at him through his windows at his base and then power Armor clipped through his wall. 
---

---
An uplifting thread on a much needed night!
---
I had an experience of my own, though not nearly as great as your's. I happened past another player, we exchanged waves, I gave him a thumb's up, he made the heart sign and we went on our seperate ways.
---
As someone who **despises** multiplayer games, this is going very well so far.
---
Aww how awful they should have known your camp was built by your special needs daughter, how dare they play the game!!!
---
I am sorry you had this experience.
---
No I read that same post, although to what I understood it sounded like the kid doesn‚Äôt actually play the game, the parent (don‚Äôt think it says mother or father) let their kid play on their account to build a CAMP whilst the parent was watching (doesn‚Äôt specify the child‚Äôs age). This seems totally okay to me to be honest. A bunch of griefers then came and decked the CAMP for no reason and the kid was very upset. Not at whitesprings. 
---
Yeah I'm positive they'll get to it eventually. Kind of strange though, that we're getting buffs in terms of range (maybe dmg too? Can't recall) and not have this fixed beforehand since it's such a glaring issue.
---
If you give a vault dweller a sweet roll.. 
---
Me too. Happily stand guard!
---
What you said about the creative outlet is so true. Video games can be amazing mediums through which you can build and create your own little worlds, with and around other people. It can be very fulfilling and very enjoyable, and it‚Äôs easy to spend HOURS on your projects. The time you spend on such things is REAL time, and therefore these creations are intrinsically valuable.
---
Griefing, or tearing down someone‚Äôs hard work for the sole purpose of being a bully is wrong, period. In a virtual world or not. Just because someone creates a platform to do so, does not make it ok. Compassion needs to exist within virtual worlds as well as outside of them. It‚Äôs up to each player to determine where the line is between actually playing the game and just acting out to be a bully. 
---
Well... 131 days later and armour is still weak. I have to remake armour or repair every day or so of play. The problem is once your level 30 armour costs balistic fibre to make. It‚Äôs so rare it‚Äôs impossible to keep up.
---
I will be new to 76 in a few hours, this story sounds great, but may I ask what vintage nukashine is? It sounds like something I need to be careful with.
---
Global treasure!
---
I‚Äôm also frustrated 130 days after your post. Balistic fibre is so rare I can‚Äôt make the armour I need at my level. Want heavy leather at level 30-40? Tough shit because there‚Äôs no ballistic fibre.
---
My group of friends and I were griefed for three hours. We had passive on and all of a sudden after the SBQ we were all being attacked by a group of people. We blocked and moved on. Then they started server hopping and kept it going. They ended up destroying my entire base.
---
I don't understand why Bethesda is permitting this to happen in adventure. 
---
I don't really "care" in full meaning, I just feel a little sad for kids who experience this kind of shit. And I don't want to get tears in headphones and read venting/rage from parents on reddit myself after PVP situations, because that will make me feel bad. So i imagine the people who leveled kid's base wasn't expecting kids tears (or maybe they were, but thats other topic). 
---
When I first started my two handed melee build, my All Rise was my baby! I seriously thought no other TH melee could possibly top it. 
---
Then I met a 3*** Ghoul Slaying Grognak with Swing Speed and +1 Strength. Mind blown. 
---
After that I got a hold of a Mutant Slaying Pickaxe with Swing Speed and 40% more power attack damage. OMG. One shot killing 3*** Legendary Level 68 Super Mutants at West Tek. Holy crap. 
---
Now my All Rise is sitting in my stash box until we get trophy cases or display boards so I can mount it and remember the days when she was the boss. 
---
To answer  your question, the answer depends on you. Your build. Yes, the perks do matter. There is no objective answer of All Rise is better or All Rise sucks. It depends on how you play. My suggestion is to try both and go with the one you like best. 
---
Good luck. 
---
The very reasons why I'm hogging the Tyler County workshop. Capturing and defending it is getting me those sweet plans and recipes.
---
I also got some plans from a player after I gave them some pumpkin soup as a thank you for helping me defend the workshop.
---
Lolz. 
---
&gt;That's one way to deal with guests who overstay their welcome
---
 That's one way to deal with guests who overstay their welcome 
---
yup, lvl 237 now and also missing Deathclaw, Megasloth and the SBQ
---
I'll take that pickaxe thankyoupleasegoodbye.
---
There is a problem with ballistic fibre. It‚Äôs so rare it‚Äôs almost impossible to keep armour to the level your at because everywhere is always picked clean. So unless you happen to be around when areas resplendent junk, at the right time, your done for. I‚Äôve just got to level 39, realised that I‚Äôve got no ballistic fibre left, been to 7 different locations to find some and there was zero. At that level and over you need the stuff for armour. Low level armour it‚Äôs not an issue. 
---
It needs to be made more prevalent or spawn more frequently.
---
Look I‚Äôm probably going to get downvoted for saying this, but I think this is your fault. There are many, *many* other games out there where you can play and build in peace. Fallout 76 is not one of them, and having high levels come through and demolishing your base is entirely within the realm of possibility. I‚Äôm sorry for the kid, I really am, but may I suggest letting her play another game that might be better suited for her and her needs.
---
No mans sky has base building and a pacifist mode, Minecraft of course, Conan exiles is fun and you can edit the game easily enough to make it easy for her to play and build, same with ARK.. 
---
Again, I hope I‚Äôm not coming off the wrong way, I just don‚Äôt think you should be upset at players doing what they‚Äôre supposed to. Fortunately for you Bethesda is nerfing it tho, and soon in adventure mode I‚Äôm pretty sure your settlements will be safe.

It is an alcohol that gives a huge boost to unarmed damage but then when it wears off you "black out" and are teleported to a random location.
---
Its alcohol, which you should always be carful with. ;)
---
Are you going to be on PC? If so I can get you some starting gear and I'll drop a bottle of Vimtage Nukeshine for you to test too. 
---
It makes your screen change colour for two minutes, can cause 'hallucinations' too, and when it wears off it teleports you to a random place. 
---
Tip: Your CAMP and Vault 76 Entrance are free fast travel points, so you're never in any real danger :) 
---
I honestly can't remember when I had to repair armor last actually. Are you using White Knight? I think thats a staple perk. 
---
Are you getting that bug ever since the last patch?
---
Not got the card. Never seen it either but I surely hope it appears in the next pack! Thanks.
---
I'm heavy meta researcher thats insulted as hacker and cheater everyday. All I do is lack of trust to what other people say, and it served me wonderfully. I check stuff on my own instead. I will not be giving exact descriptions and proofs here. Just hints to guide people into experimenting and finding it. If you have assumptions about whats good and bad in this game then most likely you are wrong because vast majority of assumptions were made obsolete with survival release patch. If you expect me to give out all my aces, or represent "no proof = bullshit" mentality, then you are encouraged to ignore this comment and write words to someone else, because if you expect to be given out results of hundreds of hours of research for free then you'd be a whiny bitch. Don't be.

Level 15 godrolls &gt;&gt; level 50bpower armor.
---
Assassin sentinel is an expensive armor but its value is not reflected in its price. Its 3rd tier now when it comes to actual PvP as all it can do is to camp indoors, tactic-wise.
---
2nd tier was assassin-cavalier done right. Less popular, harder to use, people say sentinels better, people know shit. I'm still buying godrolls for caps everyday because they are not appreciated.
---
1st tier now is unyielding armor with bloodied weapon on character made around sneaking. Best armor for this guy is almost free too.
---
There is also a build thats in the works that sucks against most other characters but might actually work against current 1st tier. If it comes out as viable I'll be sharing the news because I dont want the game to be full of lowhp sneakers. 
---
I'm already working on beating the first tier and so far my mix of 1st tier and 2nd tier character dominates in PvP against majority of 1st tier players.
---
The only set that should ever be full is weightless sentinel. For any other character, having a full set (5 of the very same prefix i.e. 5x assassin) is a tactical mistake and people without full sets but with a better mix will be mathematically stronger.
---
All of that already happens in the game. You just gotta use your mic.
---
Where does it say they were in survival mode? My understanding was that they were in adventure mode. It says lots of people stopped by, waved or used benches and left which is highly unlikely in survival mode lol
---
Even if you collect and listen to all the holotapes AND do all the faction quests AND launch the nuke, you STILL won't complete the Overseer's Quest. Now that may be because that quest is bugged OR it could mean there's more to the story we haven't heard yet.
---
It‚Äôs bugged for me and my roommate as well
---
Do you have a super deep voice? Because that would make it more interesting. 
---
Yeah its key, and if you open a pack and dont get it you can use your bumpers or triggers to switch card options. I believe its under agility. Its avilable after level 39 I think 
---
Tap them in the head a few times with a sledgehammer.
---
Woah woah woaaaaah. Bumpers or triggers? What‚Äôs this magic you speak of....
---
Hi there
---
Online now, got called out, sorry for the delay :)
---
Do you need the crafting station stove? Or the kitchen stove 
---
Yeah man next time you level up and open a pack try it out, it will change the available options unless its a 5th level level up.. i can't be sure though I haven't chosen to open a new pack in a while.
---
My camp is in cranberry bog. It's right next to the flooded quarry that always spawns a m.queen.
---
Same here. I thought the jerks had moved on but the last few times I played with my daughter and we claimed a workshop some higher level jerk showed up and killed us. I'm usually playing pacifist and by the time I went into settings to turn it off, I'm dead and my loot is gone. I guess people who aren't doing too well on survival  join adventure mode and just hope the ones they hit have pacifist on. 
---
I would like to see that pacifist mode actually means more than "I can get killed but I can't defend myself".
---
This was at Billings homestead right? I think i punched a hole in the wall a few nights ago after you left. My b. 
---
Just depends on if someone needs it real bad, you can find them pretty regularly at the vendors for around 200 caps, so if someone gets tired of lookin for one maybe you could charge 400? The plans would be worth a pretty penny tho as they seem to be pretty rare 
---
Sorry dude don‚Äôt even know what your talking about. I‚Äôll google it, but never seen buttons/options to do this. Not conscious of them anyway.
---
What... ? You expecting seacows to attackl someone's camp? Lol
---
&gt; My special needs kid asked me
---
The game is Pegi 18. You should not let a kid play it, the blame for what happened is solely on you!
---
Yes those players are assholes but they had all the right to do what they did. Maybe in real life they are customer supporters and this is how they blow off steam. It doesn't really matter what their reasoning is, your kid shouldn't be in the game in the first place. It is your fault alone - especially with a special needs kid you should've been more careful and protective - and if you are not, don't come complaining to reddit.
---
I thought that was fixed? I recently tried and I collided with the window.
---
Thanks for the explanation, and the offer.
---
Unfortunately I will be playing on PS4, but will definitely will try it out once I find a Vintage Nukashine :)
---
Funny part is the parent wasn't watching. 
---
"I haven't the faintest idea how, but my char went from 2k caps to 200 in 10 minutes. I'm assuming my kid got a bounty somehow and those people were farming her" - quote from parent's post. 
---
How kid got bounty is a good question 
---
the crafting stove, sorry about that, I didnt realize there was more than one!
---
Almost no value. It's a static spawn at west tek. 
---
They have their own store lol.
---
It is in the esm, or at least it was when I created my 'tracker spreadsheets', for both the Sledgehammer and the Baseball Bat, is just disabled.
---
Given the prefix on the EDID it even looks like at least at one pont they did consider releasing it.
---
I too am fond of that mod and I would like to see it in the game.
---
Do you think a company like Bethesda even *needs* Epic's money? Epic has mostly snagged smaller developers. It's the same reason Bethesda and other bigger companies have their own stores.
---
One of my characters is named Poo Tickler for the sole reason it doesn't matter what they're named, which negates any attachment I feel if I'm always the same guy with a different face
---
Cool thanks!
---
I second this
---
I've done this to enemies several times just with my non-explosive combat rifle. I hate it as it's very hard to find the body to loot it.
---
This opinion is just as shitty as his was. 
---
Alas, neither of those &lt;.&lt;
---
Why? It's much better for Bethesda to sell all the men who want a dress, a dress for 800 atoms 
---
And for all the ladies who want a suit, a suit for 800 atoms
---
5.) Increase the budget.
---
6.) Let us claim unowned structures and refurbish them, e.g. by patching holes in the ceiling/walls, removing trash, debris, corpses, vegetation...
---
7.) Clean walls, unbroken windows.
---
8.) Matching garage doors / powered doors for each type of wall.
---
9.) Planters for indoor crops. Greenhouses.
---
10.) More options for proper staircases.
---
11.) Manual scrapping of objects within the build radius: rocks, big trees, guardrails, car wrecks,...
---
12.) Triangle-shaped foundations to properly angle walls.
---
13. Options for making the terrain flat.
---
14. Options for building paths/roads.
---
15. Let players combine their individual camps to build bigger towns with a shared budget.
---
I don‚Äôt get what you mean by ‚Äúimpatient band wagoners‚Äù?
---
In Fallout 76 you can attack other people and attack their bases. You can 'roleplay' as a raider and generally be a dick to other people.
---
I always ask, "Why do you *want* to be a dick to other people?" Yes, you *can* and the game allows you to do so, but why do you ***want*** to? To destroy something that another human being has made; to cause them grief or stress or upset them?
---
PvP can be exciting and tense and a true test of skill when everyone is competing on a roughly even playing field, but high levels rolling in and knocking over camps is just dicks kicking over kids' sandcastles on the beach. I don't make any apologies for that generalisation either, because it's true.
---
If you get your shits and giggles from exerting power over people who have no way of stopping you, then you are a dick. You're not roleplaying anything. "The game allows me to do it. The game encourages me to do it. I'm acting out a role." You aren't. You're letting that inner asshat out. You're giving free reign to that dickish part of yourself that you can't normally let out in real life because people would punch you in the face or you would suffer some other negative repercussions for your dickish behaviour.
---
I'm sorry your girl got her camp wrecked, OP. I'd love one day to give a thumbs up in passing or maybe make a couple repairs to my armour at one of your workstations. Good hunting ;)
---
one side of the coin, in a game like this where murderhoboing it up is a thing I will always 100% strive to be the best murderhobo ever. On the other hand not everyone wants to deal with someone who builds characters specifically to 1shot people and have 500 jets and phycos on them 24/7 so they can become a drug fueld god, and they should have their own servers in passive mode.  
---
I come from playing alot of DayZ. All the game's community taught me was strike first and strike hard. I went into DayZ trying to help and talk to people, and getting shot on site or robbed every time. After playing for a month I had a bandit skin and almost all my loot was from people I killed. Usually I'd leave a gasoline filled water bottles I'd around for thirsty survivors to find, and follow them around untill they passed out or died. If there is an open world PVP encoraging game then expect everyone to want to kill you before you can kill them, and they will try whatever underhanded tricks they can to survive.
---
Look at 4k (borderlands 3), ubisoft (division 2) and Skybound (The Walking Dead: The Final Season)..... they're not small publishers but still making their games epic exclusive $_$.... 
---
Thanks Beth :D
---
Yeah, I put in a ticket but all I got was a basic copypasta response that didn't help. All the game audio works fine, I just can't hear anyone speaking in area chat anymore.
---
A thousand times this. I'm getting downvoted in that exact thread for espousing this exact opinion. 
---
Game ratings are there for a reason, and the parent has no one to blame for their piss poor parenting but themselves. 
---
You're confusing development with publishing. Bethesda developed Fallout 76, while 2K and Ubisoft are publishers for these games and the developers are smaller companies who definiteky want a bigger part of the sales money.
---
If you're on GMT/UTC and PS4 my psn is the same as my username here.
---
I'm not a great one for teaming up, but if you need a hand, the use of a camp or a bottle of Nukashine (and a way of getting back from wherever the hell you end up) I'd be happy to help :)
---
Enjoy the wasteland, Dweller ;)
---
This game surely isn‚Äôt ‚ÄúThe Sims Wasteland  Edition‚Äù
---
But seriously, I‚Äôm sorry to learn about what happened to you. Your kid should play The Sims rather than any Fallout (even if it‚Äôs just for the build mode).
---
Yeah, it happened to me yesterday. I deleted my config files and let the game generate a new one when I relaunched ‚Äî it worked.
---
It's not bugged. The Overseer's story isn't complete yet. We have neither found her, nor learnt what finally happened to her. All we know is that she is possibly still alive, as after you launch a nuke, she leaves a note for you talking about it.
---
This is why PvP in games like this never pan out well. People get upset when other players play the game within the confines of the rules and then try take the moral high ground over the destruction of their virtual ingame builds. If they are cheating so be it, but people are right idiots and snowflakes if they complain about this. Get over it
---
I have been successful fending off Scorchbeasts with the rocket turrets.
---
I have also read - might have been in the latest ItV? Not sure... - that one of the things that they are planning is buffing the turret damage and letting them scale with the player's [currently equipped] weapon.
---
They did not flesh it out though, and there has to be something more to it otherwise the damage output variance - even if just the weapon's base damage before any buffs/legendary effects is taken into consideration - between weapons is going to be pretty remarkable.
---
Either way considering that currently it is achievable to fend off SBs with turrets if they go ahead and implement these tweaks and all the rest of the variables remain equal this will become, quoting one of my favourite YT entertainers 'super easy, barely an inconvenience'.
---
My Chat volume slider is at 0 every launch of the game. Is this the bug?
---
Wasn't it exclusive on their own store until now on PC? Why should they get props for anything?
---
Not sure, the chat audio would not work at all even when everything is set to 100. If you‚Äôre on PC, delete your config files. 
---
I don't think it would be an impossible thing to add, as my frickin' crossbow has made a Deathclaw backflip! I've also seen rocket propelled ghouls and scorched flying off into the sunset with only a single rifle bullet to the torso xD
---
These exclusive decisions are usually made by Publishers I think. Not developers themselves. 
---
DS3 did it right.
---
It really is, but I think the hue of the helmet doesn't really go with the dress.
---
Yea was always disappointed when  they announced the max player count.  I do see other players often enough but would be fun the make the map more full. 
---
The punji boards are pretty good defences against AI though. They don't become hostile towards the traps. I have dozens of them, as my C.AM.P is on a road and I get random enemy patrols from time to time. 
---
Every single person who visits though stands on them... I even have the head to the ground flamingo ornaments pointing directly at them, but I always hear the trademark sound of someone stepping on them - repeatedly. They give diseases don't they? People should be more careful!
---
The spinning wheel I see every day when I check in at the Whitesprings vendor. 
---
My CAMP is like that too, but worse. I have a single foundation that rises into a floating two floor cabin that then branches out into a floating platform that loops back onto the roof of the original cabin.
---
*The horror... the horror...*
---
Some weapon mods add legendary effects. So the extra stars are there for that. For example on the machete you can add a serrated blade mod which adds the poison and bleed legendary effect. The scorched receiver mods also add a legendary star effect. 
---
I wish we could color things with a bit more freedom.  
---
Also if I could get the Full Metal Jacket references "Born To Kill" and a Peace Button on my helmet, I would.
---
When you hit X to inspect the item in inventory, do you have 4 legendary stats, if not then it's a bug
---
Sorry to say its bery sad ect but this game dose everything it fucking can to prevent griefing if anything its the opposite most people wanted when it came to pvp base build ect game should have just had oersisting serves from the get go.
---
Can you add a pic of an item with more than 3 stars?
---
Shoot that's a crazy compromise to "role playing as a raider"
---
Add to that Serendipity 3 and Dodgy 3 and that's why you do no damage.
---
People actually play fallout76 lmao? Make her play minecraft.
---
It's happened to me several times and I usually shut the game off to save as much as possible. My camp is a realistic house in Whitesprings far from the golf club or other disputed places. I only have one locked door and that's protecting my reactor and a rad shower.
---
No sorry I‚Äôm at work using my phone lol 
---
I'll give that a shot, thanks for the tip.
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs bugged. The last you hear of her is either after you launch a nuke or at the mountain side hotel where she is badly injured. I belive that‚Äôs the ‚Äúend‚Äù to her story for now 
---
it‚Äôs the sacrificial blade mod and mods can only add one star, making the max stars 4. one star will still be empty no matter what you do to a weapon. fifth star might be upcoming content
---
When you listen to the mountainside lodge tape she's dying as she records it, she is also a corpse in the upstairs bathroom
---
I wholeheartedly sympathise with this situation
---
 I am full on pacifist, level 70 now and have never thrown a shot or punch to a another player. 
---
My word of advice to your daughter a d anybody else facing a bully in the game would be to just jump server as soon as possible, when this happens, takes a moment and quickly forget the experience. Retaliation does not really give any closure for pacifist and the longer you remain in the same server the more your character suffers
---
Ah yeah that‚Äôs the mod not serrated blade my mistake. 
---
You could just move your camp away from one of the most populated areas on the map?
---
Would appease the rather large segment of people who hate ws-camps as well.
---
Sweet I always heard people asking about dense so thought I'd ask
---
Yes but they are still putting their games on steam, unlike epic launcher
---
Well I hate to break it to ya but the game wasn‚Äôt created to cater to disabled children.
---
The corpse in the bathroom is someone from a different Vault, not 76. You can see the number by flipping the corpse with an explosive. She does not die there, as she writes you a note after you finish 'I am Become Death'.
---
My character name is DefNotDBCooper.  I always have some cash on me.
---
I've never sold anything in game but, any plans I have(got a few valued at 500-1500caps when I look at them in my stash), I'm selling below vendor cost, I'm sitting at 20k caps right now and anything that a vendor has, I don't really need/want.....if MODUS had plans for Calibrated X-01 shocks, I'd have them....and rock my Quantum...or even buy 2 off of a player for 1,200caps or something...
---
they‚Äôve been around for a while, since the last update i guess. just a name error, seen a couple of sheepsquatch hordes myself and the bug isnt really that new anymore
---
I'm in my thirties. Been gaming for a long time.
---
Thanks for the heads up. Ill drop the post
---
Now that‚Äôs an idea they should embrace. 
---
Is it really that hard to get? Ive gotten 5 in fallout 76. All within the last 3 months or so and I only hit it like once per day. 
---
It's the natural next step I think, imo.
---
I go there to murder molemen
---
if you have variations of the same weapon favorited, it‚Äôll mess them up and use whatever you have. even if you have lets say a legendary hunting rifle and are hoarding non legendary hunting rifles for scrapping and mods, it‚Äôll randomly select one of the non legendaries from your favorites. i‚Äôve had this bug a lot, hoping they‚Äôll fix it soon because i always have tons of weapons with me...
---
The thing is, Bethesda even kind of encourages this as I've seen a perk that allows you to do more damage to a camp. It does suck and for what it's worth, I'm sorry your kid had this experience. 
---
I did that event like 4 days ago, and I"m still burning through the ammo I made from the 100+ lead I got out of it.
---
As you‚Äôre on xbox, feel free to pop me a fr and I can help your kid with some materials to rebuild :) 
---
GT is PixelD0T 
---
This idea is a gem. Like China is implementing at present. If you are a dick, your ability to interact with society is handicapped. Scary in real life but an absolutely brilliant idea for the Appalachian wasteland. 
---
Tho i'm not sure pooling resources would be a bright idea.  
---
After all...
---
# DEATH IS A PREFERABLE ALTERNATIVE TO COMMUNISM.
---
Pics?
---
The *budget* should get pooled, not the resources. 
---
Four people combining their camps would have four times the budget at their disposal. The build area should also increase accordingly.
---
It's a food item that never spoils, though other than that it has no real value. 
---
Sure PVP shouldn't have a limit. You can just kill him. They should implement a warning system for that, so you know when someone enters the silo.   
---
I won't say that nobody wants to launch more than 3 nukes a day. I think they should only change the system, when someone blocks a silo and don't want to launch a nuke. I think a time limit would be a good idea, when its enough time for most players.   
---
Tbh. I don't know if players that launch the nuke get a bonus. The only thing that randoms can do, is waste the nuke on a spot, that you don't want. I think when they launch the nuke at whitesprings or the SBQ it's fine, when you either want one of it. 
---
Happy you got some good stuff!
---
Kids, special needs or not. Shouldnt be playing a game rated 18. Bad parent!
---
Wow draconian. But effective. Considering the population size probably a necessary evil.
---
I still really like the idea of a player becoming so evil that they turn into one of the creatures we hunt in the game. 
---
You need to use a VPN in order to activate that key; after activating it in the right region, then you can play it from anywhere.
---
Nah, it just helps with V.A.T.S accuracy and the distance you have to be to detect hostiles on your compass
---
I love it 
---
If you are on xbox and want to send me your gamertag, I would be more than happy to swing by and use your crafting stations, play your instruments, sleep in your bed(?) and anything else that might help put a smile on your kid's face once everything is back up and running.  I agree with your opinion of the griefers.  I guess they get tired of kicking puppies in real life.
---
I thought contractor was just for workshops?
---
Honestly I just wish there was a way to collect a lot of dirty water at my camp without needing to use the dinky little pump. I hate going to a pond and collecting upwards of like 20+ pounds of water only to need to refine it to boiled.
---
Then again it's be nice to just use purified water in soup as well.
---
I've noticed that this game has a lot of hiveminds in it.
---
You've got the one and only Scorched Plague, Stranglers, and then the artificial MODUS.
---
Kids these days that have grown up in the "everybody gets a prize" lifestyle are not interested in playing/grinding the game. The general believe that if you have something then they deserve it too.
---
 All they want is to buy their way to the top, play the "end game" so the can brag at how it only took them 20 hours to finish it and then complain on every social media platform they use, that the game is shit because there's no end game content, and nothing to do.
---
Oh that‚Äôs amazing, thank you for letting me know! I‚Äôll give it another go on the weekend!
---
Okay but I imagined a bunch of mirelurks glued to a tank with vegetable starch and not an actual Queen.
---
*stares at literally every mmo*
---
Nope...because "eventually" allowing the game to be purchased through steam does \_me\_ and \_the rest of you\_ zero fucking good. Unless you buy a new copy, you'll still have to use the bethesda launcher, even after it's eventually launched on steam. 
---
Or childeren in general! Its rated 18. This parant knows other can come along and destroy camps, yet let his daughter build in this game and the rare chance someone will destroy a  camp has done.
---
Its like taking your child to the pub and them getting upset because someone said the word shit. 
---
But why not play fallout 4 then?
---
I must have misunderstood that part. 
---
Did you toss a scortch killer receiver on it? 
---
Invest into the  lone wander park card
---
Find a friend lol. But really. It gets boring fast solo. 
---
If you ever need a guard, junk, ammo or anything, just message me. I'll join you on your travels and help out when I can. Those idiots are in the minority, remember that üòâ
---
Don't collect everything you find. Stash fills up quickly. 
---
I hate pvp and all that involve fighting other people, i try to avoid it in everygame if i can, i'm sorry for the bad experience.
---
Let's hope that the patch that will made pacifist mode work for camp too will be live soon so everyone will play the game that prefer with no reason to ruin others experience.
---
Honestly, the idea that you'd sell that gear at all is refreshing. As a person who actually \_has\_ a pile of caps, I've kinda given up looking to purchase loot, because anyone who has shit worth \_buying\_ isn't taking caps. 
---
Where do I line up to post about the perk card loadout feature request and survival mode should be new characters only with no legendaries?
---
I don‚Äôt even accept trade requests with anyone I don‚Äôt know anymore. They just get hurt when I won‚Äôt sell one of the 4 main weapons I use. 
---
I'm going to sell all my plans super cheap. I no joke have about 100 pounds of plans that I can't shift. I'm thinking 25 to 50 caps per basic camp stuff. More depending on the rarity but still cheap enough to get rid of 
---
My brother is getting it next month so wont be solo for     long 
---
Thanks  
---
One possible solution is to instance social areas away from the combat areas, which is what a lot of games do. The social areas has less demands on then as there is no combat and network tick rates can be decreased. So we could have an instanced area for building very large structures.
---
This plan is also found (and to my own testing found a lot more reliably) at a tree by the miners monument 
---
What are you playing on?
---
Ps4
---
Yes, 2 hunting rifles, 2 lever rifles and 4 handmades, each against different types of enemies.
---
I play PS4 and Xbox if ya ever wanna team up
---
I m gonna be on tonight at around 9pm GMT. If you still need help, add "Llyd" and drop me an invite.
---
Because the game was pitched as no NPCs so everyone can create their own stories, and some people want to write stories where they slaughter and destroy everyone else.
---
Iv never found that spawn point. It‚Äôs north of it right? The other spot Iv found is the dry lake bed at new gad. 
---
More often than not, those pillars don't reach the ground, anyway, so it looks worse... because you tried and failed rather than just saying f it.
---
Maybe üòÅ would be Good to train my English 
---
I'll have a poke through my stash later. If I have any we might be able to trade for fusion cores?
---
If you spawn in at the miners monument  immediately look left and you‚Äôll see an overturned flatbed. Hop over (or go around) and there is a single big tree. It‚Äôll be on the other side of that tree, along with other spawns like the halloweener an I detonated nuke a death claw nest a tank etc
---
That's shitty, especially when it happened to a special needs kid. And I won't pretend to tell you how to parent. I also don't know how old she is. But (Yes, here comes the "but") first of all, they didn't know who they were messing with, a person with "normal" cognitive nature knows to log off when that happens, and if the kid is young and the game has an "M" rating, it probably isn't suitable for them, or at least isn't designed to be because of stuff like this. You're going into a mosh pit blind and expecting people to be nice to a person they can't even see in real life. Yes, most of the blame lies with the jerks, and the old stupid "look what she was wearing and where she was! She was asking for it!" excuse is a cognitive disconnect used by people to justify bad behavior. But this was preventable, and I really don't know why you seem surprised and so outraged it happened, given what we all have experienced playing this game. 
---
Have you seen the game's age reccomendation? People are supposed to be at least as mature as a 14 year old. Any 14 kid could get upset from this, sure, but not heartbroken and crying.
---
It is what it is, you should not expose her to online games with toxic people until she's mature enough.
---
Quick tip for new player - don't be afraid to die, in fact letting yourself die is the best way early on to get health back rather than wasting stimpacks. When you die you only lose the junk you are carrying, so keep stashing your junk regularly so you can die with no consequences.
---
Next piece of advice would be on builds. Choose a build and stick with it. If you don't start specialising early you will have to respec later on when it takes longer to level up. Melee is like Very Easy mode so you could go with that. Rifles and shotguns are also pretty good. Everything else makes the game a bit more difficult e.g. big guns require a lot of ammo, energy weapons damage is rubbish.
---
You can play around with builds here -  [https://nukesdragons.com/](https://nukesdragons.com/) 
---
Then you will know what perk cards to take each level up.

I have an Instigatin Grognak which is pretty nice. But atm there thus bug where the Grognak does not profit from Weapon Artisan so it breaks faster than any other 2HM.
---
You‚Äôre a liar :-) swing speed and power attack has the same mod spot on the weapon, only possible to get 1 of those affixes
---
Is it 1\*?
---
I agree with both your posts. I‚Äôve been with the game since day one beta and it drives me nuts that they don‚Äôt fix the old bugs and problems in the game. 
---
The way they‚Äôve gone about everything has just been terrible. I barely play now even though they‚Äôre adding in new content because they‚Äôre just adding small things onto an already broken game. 
---
I gave up for a few days after the last patch that changed some camp things because there are still major camp bugs that prevent you from building. Why add in new stuff if I still can‚Äôt build a normal base? 
---
Quad is so much fun to use, however when reloading..... 
---
Waa my kid's base got destroyed plz fix Bethesda 
---
Nicely done.
---
Thank you fagmonkey 
---
Funfact you can modify the pipboy colors and the pipboy light color but in fo76 the hud color is hardcoded
---
Two shot weapons aren‚Äôt that valuable anymore since the nerf and as been overshadowed by the bloodied effect
---
To add to what u/novacgal said, if you get the recipe for stimpacks you can use the perk butchers bounty on ticks to get more tick blood, 
---
Use the tick blood to make blood packs
---
Use the blood packs to make stims
---
Break the stims down into diluted stims
---
????
---
Profit.
---
Yes
---

You can also add a scorchkiller receiver -  [https://i.redd.it/i24cqgk5bt721.jpg](https://i.redd.it/i24cqgk5bt721.jpg)

It adds a fourth star, sometimes.

I have been diligently collecting and learning every plan I can possibly get my hands on in the hopes of becoming a shopkeeper at some point. Problem is, I have a nice and lovingly crafted house I don't want to tear down to build a shop. I think we need a CAMP AND a small budget for a separate little peaceable vending stall or armor garage.  
---
Time to hop on my OP account and blast some poor n00bs bases.
---
Until it turns out that there is some obscure pvp wendio build that just kicks arse and then you have incentived base destruction to a massive degree.
---
:P i mean come on it could happen.
---
Damn, just tried it with my 3rd char, thelast location in the mire still won't trigger (Valley galleria). Grafton dam doesn't work for me as well. That's ridiculous they haven't fixed it ever since beta...
---
Perk cards that reduce weight are very useful. Thru Hiker and Traveling Pharmacist are fantastic through the whole game and you can get them early on.
---
They eliminated all slap damage there's nothing to complain about anymore. All the softies got softy mode.
---
I think 500 caps tops. They should call it 0.25 shot since the nerf :)
---
All-rise isn't that great...it's a super sledge with weight reduction. I mean yeah sure, it's not a _bad_ weapon, but it's not "epic" like some people try to paint them to be. A normal super sledge does a pretty decent amount of damage. All rise weighs less and comes with a great mod. Generally speaking in 76, "unique weapons" just aren't that great, when compared to good random legendary items. And that, to my mind, is a _good_ thing...(at least, if random legendary items were to drop more favorably). Because it encourages you to play the game more. 
---
I'm currently running with 1* bloodied grognak. And that's only because my 1* bloodied sledge hammer evaporated, and I've never found another to replace it.    
---
Personally, I'm not a huge fan of grognak's, due to the fact that you can't modify them. Do they have a pretty decent base damage? Of course. But with my (much missed) sledge hammer, I was doing puncturing damage, and energy damage, on top of great physical damage.   And it looked AMAZING. Cobbled together, glowing, honestly there are days I consider just tossing that mod on a regular hammer and going to town. 
---
At the end of the day,  the real answer is pick up some weapons, and try them out.  One of my favorite weapons in some zones is a vampires buzz blade. Does it do a lot of damage? No. Is it a hell of a lot of fun to use? Hell yes. 
---
I have seen that exact same thing in exactly the same place. I suspect that's where the game spawns wings of vertibots to be sent other places on the map. Have you ever seen 2 or 3 scorchbeasts erupt from a fissure at the same time and fly off into the distance? If you follow them they actually end up at workshops as attackers during the "defend \*blank\* workshop" quests.
---
I've seen them there before. I've wondered if that's like a waiting area before they are used for stuff on the map.
---
Holding action until requested ...
---
To be fair dude I don‚Äôt even do pvp I just respect the right of others who do it‚Äôs part of the fun when you get raided and can fight them off no point being a sook about it 
---
Or just serverhop for the sentry bot that spawn at the giant train crash 100% percent of the time
---
Some mods add a star for some stupid reason, but the fifth star is likely for future content that will make 4 star legendary drops a thing.
---
I put pillars all over the place then delete the things they're attached to. So if you stumble upon a camp that's mostly 42 floating pillars... that's me.
---
They stack.
---
OP needs to understand, they are weak. If a SB comes along, they are gone in seconds.
---
Hold my beer
---
With Assassin sentinel armor you basically take no damage from any gun, it is just broken OP. 
---
and there is also Vats - AKA aimbot 
---
They fixed that bug, I'm pretty sure.  They can enter the ground a lot more easily now from what I can tell.  I even got some to stick into a resource extractor so it looks like my house is built on it.
---
Well I mean, they aren't ACTUALLY there for structural integrity...just to make it look like it has it ;)  
---
And yeah, I just do repair all when my base gets majorly damaged so I don't have to try to get to all the pieces wherever they are.
---
On the one hand i hate griefers on the other hand i hate children even more so in video games so .... bad luck ?
---
Been there since day one, they drop off the supply boxes
---
Glorious.
---
Do you have the dense mod and fireproof rank 3? If he‚Äôs still one shotting you through that then they are either a critical shotgun build, bloodied shotgun build, or both.
---
Yeah, but just look at the 1¬∞ post on this subreddit with 1.2k upvotes, 2 silver, 2 gold and 1 platinum.  
---
It's full of people still complaining and insulting PvP players.  
---
You have the whiskey or cranberry shine, I have a pickaxe pilsner I'll trade you.
---
I'm completely against any kind of pvp in adventure mod.. it's fallout afterall! Play survival if you want to play GTA online style and kill everyone and everything that moves... Bethesda rethink this pvp shit... 
---
Relatively new player. Every time I see one of these, I shake my head. Hard enough to stay immersed in Bethesda game at the best of times, but when I finally get there, something like this (or running into invisible nothing) drags me back out. üò•
---
Another PS4 ranger here, glad to see someone else fighting the good fight
---
Don't want to make you angry, but it is probably your perk cards that are making your build waste so much ammo. If you're willing to fight a scorchbeast with automatic rifles, you should do a stealth commando/rifleman-VATS-crit spam build - if you are going to be in the \[Caution\] stealth state near the scorchbeast when it lands, you can stack sneak attack crits and kill the scorhcbeast without wasting a 25 ammo mag. The Fallout 76 YouTuber CaptainNoob killed a scorchbeast with his stealth commando build in twelve 5.56 rounds with his furious handmade rifle. He didn't have any fancy power armor or two shot explosive weapons - he only had chameleon armor and a furious handmade rifle. Here is the link to his build if you are interested: [https://www.falloutbuilds.com/builds/stealth-commando-rifleman-2-0-crit-spam-stealth/](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/builds/stealth-commando-rifleman-2-0-crit-spam-stealth/)

Hey im only lvl 30 and i have a little brother with special needs and some of my own aswell so i can understand what your daughter musy have been feeling. I'm not amazing at the game but If you need someone to help defend your daughters work just hit me up. My gamertag Is OsirisDawns. 
---
What platform are you? I'll give you 400 caps right now :)
---
&gt;don't bother replying
---
Actually, the key to ending that conversation would have been for you not to reply to *him*.
---
But Bethesda listens too much.
---
Not sure just picked the best items for it.
---
&gt;if you want to play as a murderhobo you're a piece of shit
---
Lol. Probably should have thought before you decided to play a multiplayer game with semi-open pvp, huh? Choosing to play a game a certain way doesn't make you a piece of shit, you're just a salty, temperamental idiot. 
---
Yes it has 4 legendary stats.....
---
Yup, I believe the mystery is solved, lol.
---
Irrelevant. Try thinking sometime. Fallout 4 would have been the better choice for sandbox building, that's just plain truth. 
---
All of the people that complain about the PvP they were aware of when they started playing are personified surprised Pikachu faces.
---
Fo76 isn't an mmo
---
This makes a lot of sense really as often times the point of playing a "villain" is to make the good guys look better or to provide a level of measured challenge something to valiantly struggle against. Getting smashed by a level 230 dude with a TSE shotgun and modded out PA (T-60 no less) comes though the wall of your camp and then levels the place is not a valiant struggle against anything. 
---
Aside from that raider need to want something if they had it then would would they be raiding in fallout raiders often have short and painful life (outside of random vault dwellers who need more shotgun parts :P)
---
Don't listen to him. Just it is like that for him, doesn't mean it has to be for you. I play mostly solo since BETA, and I have leveled one character to level 170 and one to level 60. 
---
It depends on what type of player you are. Even if you play solo, you can decide in the game if you wanna team up sometimes or not. You will find the opportunity, or you can walk away when you'Re not in the mood for it.
---
It's very flexible in regards of how your playing experience is going to be.
---
You don't have to get a perk of the stat you increase on level up. You can get more Agility but then chose a Strengh perk. 
---
Saving perk packs for later doesn't give you higher perk cards in each pack so just open them when you get them.
---
If someone is harrasing you exit to main menu and rejoin, you will join another server most of the time. This is called server hoping.
---
Each red rocket stop has a chest to access your personal stash.
---
Each train station has a vendor and access to your personal stash. In each train station there is a interactiv map to other stations. Click on the lights on the map.
---
Climbing a watchtower you can look out and survey the area marking down all the locations nearby.
---
How does pacifist mode effect workshops?  Does pacifist get turned off?  Or can you not own a workshop?
---
A big +1 from me.  I also like the idea of events tied to dark nights and, since we have three power stations, perhaps we could have an event/quest to turn the lights on too. We do have torches(Whats an RPG without torches I ask you). Perhaps a new torch attachment for weapons would be in order.  
---
As to early complaints about darkness well, that was then. Back in the days when one person would make a criticism and six thousand youtubed maniacs would shout Yeah Bethesda you Bar stewards
---
Lazy game lol... Let's see you launch a game.. Oh wait you cant.. I've had 400 hours out of this game.. And will carry on playing.. Some people just like to bitch...
---
I've paid for the game and that's it.. I've played over 400 hours... Stop your childish whining 
---
Do you have the required resources in your stash or in your inventory? 
---
The workbenches should generally be connected to your stash, but sometimes the game gets... confused.
---
I'd recommend putting the exact amount of components you need to repair the quest item directly into your inventory.
---
Agreed , only don't blame bethesda... they just made a game they thought was cool, they have done a whole lot of stuff to prevent this but sometimes this happens... thats uncool from the peeps... but not their fault 
---
I'm high level. I like PVP. But in it's current state it is absolutely broken, full of hackers, and is completely gear-to-win after they implemented that STUPID first-shot damage limiter. It's a few hackers and people with Assassin/Sentinel running around farming everyone who doesn't hack or have an ultra rare duped armor set they bought off Ebay for real money. From a duper who cheated it and your TSE weapon into existence in the first place. I used to AT LEAST be able to consistently VATS snipe the gear whores, but with that gone and the prevalence of outright cheaters on PC and the lack of weapon diversity caused by this idiocy has turned me off. 
---
Also, watch this if you think I am full of shit:

---
Maybe it‚Äôs all related. I‚Äôm on PS4 and the chat slider is always defaulted back at 0 every time I start the game
---
I'm sure Bethesda will be desperately waiting your validation..lol 
---
Makes sense to me. There is that contractor card and all. 
---
When you die you will drop a paper bag with all your junk in it. Make sure you loot that paper bag before you die again or it will reset and you will loose your loot.
---
I totally agree with you. I found the story with your child very sad. I hope he is better now.
---
Unfortunately, many people don't give a shit and are amazingly mean.
---
[My record so far is seventeen.](https://i.imgur.com/ss2yy55.png)
---
The packs are only an extra 5 random cards you get every 5 levels.     They have nothing to do with unlocking card availability. Your assumption about how this works is wrong.  If you do not have access to this perk card submit a report.  
---
I haven‚Äôt had this happen personally, but I‚Äôve had like 2-3 scorchbeasta messing up my camp. I logged off and logged back in. All was good then just repair the camp.
---
So they do spawn outside the circle. I'm gathering some great tips on here. Thank you.
---
If you want to go high in one particular special don't necessarily do it as soon as possible as perk cards unlock with level.
---
You can also level up one special and select a perk card for a different one when levelling up.
---
Power armour and a 2H melee weapon is a good fallback Plan for melee, even without any perks or high strength.
---
Agreed, although every fallout game has gone this road, only difference this is an online and they really just needed to experiment, in the end it's a massive succes
---
Personally I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs good. It needs fusion cores. Therefore it uses rare and heavy ammunition... plus the weapon is also super heavy.
---
This is one of the best parts of this game, the community. People are are always willing to help, I've made some really good friends playing fo76
---
Haha, yup! I built a few versions there because I didn't want to destroy my current camp. Totally forgot that it stays there when you log out.
---
During the beta when I saw these I turned into cave man SpongeBob and started shooting at them.
---
Lol ;) 
---
 Please bring some of this good natured raider attitude over to r/falloutraiders. 
---
People are just still pouting they didn't get fallout 5 with invite co-op
---
You knew what the game was, and if you didn't then you should have done your research. You allowed your child to play a multiplayer game where PVP is an option. You are entirely to blame for this situation because it's your fault.
---
They're playing that game as intended. That's the end of the discussion, there can be no arguments beyond that point.
---
Graham would be a good radio host, and quite entertaining to listen to as well :p
---
I‚Äôm not into the pvp action too much. I don‚Äôt mind a fight once and a while and I know how to engage if I want to, if two people wanna clash go for it, but if it‚Äôs obvious someone wants no part then move on. It‚Äôs not the pvp part that bugs me personally it‚Äôs a fun addition for a challenge but other dude is right too many people with duped or op products that make shit so lopsided it‚Äôs not even fun and then there are the ones who just harass, get your kills and move along it‚Äôs the people who will follow one person from server to server just to be a jerk that bothers me 
---
Console or PC? 
---
That‚Äôs the best idea i‚Äôve heard 
---
You're not getting creative enough. üòè

Well, customer support says otherwise: as of 02/04/19, it apparently is not obtainable through official means.

Take over workshops. Great early XP and great early loot. They also allow you to fast travel for free to the workshop. As soon as I get on, I try to take over three or four that are far away. That way I can travel several places quickly.
---
Just because you don‚Äôt want to play with others, doesn‚Äôt mean you shouldn‚Äôt partner up. This community is one of the nicest I‚Äôve ever played. I send out invites and then tell them to do their own thing, I just want the extra exp (using inspirational perk). Also, not partnering up might cause you to miss out on some cool free stuff. Higher levels are always trying to be generous.
---
Craft all of your Rad-X, Radaway, and Stimpaks into their diluted forms via a chemistry station. You get XP for each craft and nine times out of ten you don‚Äôt need a full Stimpak (you‚Äôre just wasting it). There‚Äôs also a perk later on that allows you to double the amount of health related crafting items.
---
You are my hero. Just went to the Pleasant Hills Cemetery and I found plans for the Gauss Rifle.

On a side note, 2 of the 3 safes at the cemetery were unlocked when I got there, as well as the armory in Camp Venture. I guess I'm not the only one following this post.

I sold everything to bot vendors, yesterday a lvl45 2\* anti-armor + 10% damage-when-aiming Gauss rifle. I am not out for a lot of caps but may change strategy and sell via the vending machine we are going to get. I hope the place the vending machines in some sort of market place so that we can travel to one place for all vendors. Close to Vault 76 would be great, no nukes....
---
Good stuff. Thanks.
---
I‚Äôd help too.  Gamertag: Dalisair
---
But I‚Äôm pretty low level.  I‚Äôm likely just a small deterrent. 
---
I wish we could drop a 1x1 or 1x2 temp camp, maybe cost some caps without moving the primary camp. Would be helpful for SBQ/nuke zone runs.
---
Good old days of collecting guns to combine repair
---
Buy your daughter FO4 and mod it for unlimited resources. Let her play that instead of dealing with assbloods on multiplayer.

It wouldn't let me because the bottom of the stairs was clipped into the ground. I appreciate the input though man
---
Collision course maybe 
---
I've always said that people who want to play PvP absolutely have the right to. ... But with others who want to. 
---
So, once the beta is worked out, you can PvP all you want to. 
---
That doesn't mean that some of the things in your rant aren't true. I'm glad to have the griefers gone. Whether it's players who follow and harass lower level players or passive players, or people who destroy camp items that require flux to fix them, I'm happy that they how are free to do that and experience bullying from other players who like to bully the bullies. 
---
I totally agree that these people don't represent all people who like PvP, but I'm still glad that the players are gone who believe that they have the right to harass players who prefer PvE. 
---
Yes. Lots of players have been commenting on how glad they are that PvP players are gone. If you're not someone who has been bothering other players then don't take it personally. 
---
It's the same mentality as griefers/gankers in World of Warcraft. In WoW servers originally started as PVP and PVE. On PVP there was no way to opt-out of PVP except for starting zones. On PVE, you could turn PVP-flag manually on or get automatically flagged when attacking guards of the other faction. The issue was that once you chose a server, you were locked there. The character there couldn't move to a PVP or PVE server unless we paid money or were lucky to catch a free character transfer. So many people (like me) chose PVP server because on paper if sounded fun. This was in 10+ years ago for most of us. WoW was our first MMO and we had no idea about ganking, griefing, corpse camping... the PVP server description never warned about this. Also, in the beginning it wasn't that bad. Only when many people reached max level (and got bored) it got much much worse. Suddenly max levels were ganking popular levelling zones and their quest hubs. And level 30 in wow has no chance to fight level 60/70/80.
---
And this is when the mentality of the griefers came into play - when discussing the issue of ganking. "You can't expect to avoid PVP on PVP servers" was the popular excuse by these assholes. You bet we would leave to PVE server if we had a chance! "I'm roleplaying my Horde" was another favorite, which is basically the same as the excuse done in Fo76. Or my personal favorite: "I'm doing it to make you bring out your main". Sure, but the moment my main enters the zone, the ganker either flees or brings his friends, because equal playing field is something they don't like. And you can imagine what kind of excuses were made when we pointed then in the direction of instanced PVP, where they can fight against people with same alleged PVP desires.
---
Basically, these people loved the idea of causing misery to others and chose various excuses to justify their behavior. Anything that was easy prey was fun, but once they were targetted by other max level characters, their fun went down the drain. I bet that these Fo76 "raiders" would throw the biggest tantrums if they were stopped by other well-equipped players. They would either message you that you can't fight your battles alone, that you are coward and that they look forward to finding you unprotected. Or they would harass the other "defenders" for messsing with their "fun" or for not fighting fair (they always find excuses why their loss wasn't fair). Possibly both.
---
I love the removal of slap damage becuase it lowers the option of these griefers to harass other players. And I'm looking forward to the CAMP immunity with pacifist on. These people prey on the fun of others, so I don't have any sympathy for them when their options for "fun" get more and more limited. If roleplaying a raider is their desire, survival is that way. Any excuse for not playing survival is basically confirmation that their idea of fun isn't roleplaying, but simply just griefing. These assholes have stomped on the fun of others for too long. Now their "fun" gets stomped on by the developers and I adore their salt when discussing these changes...
---
Nothing. 
---
4 caps to a vendor. 
---
I'm not insulting PvP players - i.e. those players who want to engage in actual combat with other players who also want to engage in actual combat. That's exciting and awesome and has been the primary reason for playing multiplayer games since the dawn of digital time. I think the Survival Mode is a good step in that direction, because at least you know if you see another player there, you can be almost 100% sure that they are seeking the same thing you are - player versus player combat.
---
But now you're on the Adventure Server and you find another player's camp. You throw up the 'PvP?' emote. They respond with the 'No' emote. You fire a couple of pot shots at them. They run behind a wall or ignore you altogether...
---
*This is the point where you have to ask yourself what you are looking for; what it is that you are wanting this interaction with this other player to provide.*
---
1. You walk away, looking for another player at another camp who will engage you in a fight and give you the tense, exciting gaming experience that you describe.
---
2. You proceed to blow their shit to smithereens even though it gains you nothing in terms of resources or gaming satisfaction because that person's walls and water purifiers sure as sugar aren't going to put up a rewarding fight by anyone's standards.
---
Option 1 is for PvP players. I like PvP players, even though I'm not one most of the time. I admire their purity of purpose and the lengths many go to in order to be an effective killing machine and hunter of humankind.
---
Option 2 is for bullies. Dicks. Jerks. I don't like those players. The thrill they are getting from that experience is exerting power over someone who can't/won't fight back. It can be wrapped in any kind of justification you like but it still comes down to getting your enjoyment by causing someone else stress. That's the singular reward for this kind of behaviour.
---
So no, I won't stop calling out people being dicks. Ever. PvP players - may your shocks never need calibrated and your Bloodied Shotguns never run dry. Dicks - I hope you fall into a pile of scorch beast dung.
---
In a way, it really fits in well with the message of working together that all the factions portray. 
---

In any case I'll join.

I'm so sorry man, this broke me. People are absolute assholes. This is the thing, people never remember there's a human being on the other side of the screen, and everyone who uses Reddit will know that very well. Everyone is so quick to judge, name-call and just generally be an asshole,  yet it's quite rare to see someone wishing another being a happy day ahead.
---
It's most likely teenagers or young adults who decided it was "funny".
---
Im not sure what else to say or why I'm saying this even, just please remember that people have feelings and some people are more sensitive that others. When we were kids, there was an age at which we realized the world isn't a pretty place - this, is just one of those instances when OP's daughter is on her road to realise that.
---
I'm sorry on behalf of those people. Sending hugs to you and your daughter.
---
Great video, literally one shotted your whole team while you were all inside a building! I think I'll be staying clear of PvP on PC from now on. I wouldn't be surprised if bethesda can't detect this or do anything about it. I just googled PC hacking fallout 76 and got an alarming amount of results.
---
I'd suggest you go back and play through some other quests first. I reached level 50 or 60 playing lone wanderer almost entirely. 
---
I still only rarely will join a team because I like having lone wanderer maxed out.

You can kill that wendigo on your own.

I understand it would be difficult to decorate with junk you find, but surely 'fillers' for shelves (think 'Do It Yourshelf mod for F4) or even pre-filled shelves or tables would make a huge difference already and make C.A.M.P.s actually feel lived in.

Anyone that feels the need to privately message you to defend their right to wreck someone‚Äôs camp for no purpose or gain, and to threaten or insult you while doing it, is just a sad loser and unworthy of the time it takes to read their message.
---
Ok?
---
the newer games get LAUNCHED on steam. launched means it's there on release.
---
Way to use your "special needs" kid for internet points.  You're more of a shit head than those griefers you made up for this post.

&gt; Can we just take a moment to appreciate Bethesda not going on the bandwagon of the whole Epic games store exclusivity? 
---
Says this while not being self-aware enough to realise that the game has been exclusive to the Bethesda launcher since it's beta in October 2018.
---
You do realise that a lot of the exclusives that are going to Epic are similarly timed exclusives? Usually for a year.
---
The decisions are made by the publisher, not the developers. Even the metro developers said this was not what they wanted. 
---
Hell, I'll donate spare plans I have no use for 
---
I'm talking about the newer games. Not pers√© Fallout76
---
It would be a big invasion of security, as many people use their real names. I would say have an option to display your characters name under the gamertag.
---
I agree 1000%.  I didn't make the choice to have children.  In fact, I made the *opposite* choice and my wife and I have intentionally chosen *not* to have kids.  The poor choices and planning of these parents does not obligate me to parent their children. It is not the responsibility of the rest of the world to parent their children.  They can either take responsibility for their own goddamned kids or not complain when the rest of the world doesn't oblige them by doing their job for them.  It's the same bullshit I saw when I used to work in an arcade in my local mall half a decade ago, parents would drop their kids off and then pull the shocked pikachu face when they were informed that we weren't a free daycare service.
---
Having children doesn't entitle you or your children to special treatment, and it's not the responsibility of strangers to babysit your kids.
---
It's not like virtually every other MMO out there which easily included the ability to name characters, some places housing hundreds of thousands of them. Its completely possible but..... This is Bethesda -  anything is unpossible‚Ñ¢.
---
Definitely needed. 
---
That's awesome but good god it looks heavy to carry.
---
It may be something you check already but you need to be over level 5 and have gone in to the level up window to select perk cards. Only then can you actually team up.
---
&gt; The base Fallout 76 experience, **focused on cooperative play**.  For those seeking to explore and rebuild Appalachia with limited interference from hostile players.
---
The in-game description for adventure mode might help explain why going around in it SLAPing uninterested people gets you labeled a nuisance.  
---
Betheada listened to people who wanted more PvP and/or "tenser" player interactions and made survival mode specifically for them.  If you want to PvP than play survival mode.  If you want to follow people in the mode that's *focused on cooperative play* SLAPing them you can expect to be called a nuisance/griefer/asshole.
---
I wouldn't write it off completely, I made a new strictly (self imposed rule obviously) Survival character shortly after the mode was released and I've met several players who wanted to team up instead of murder me and even had a guy stop by my workshop last night who wanted to trade.
---
That said, the fact that I'm still only level 27 probably helps since I'm not worth many caps yet anyways.
---
It‚Äôs a rite of passage
---
The ammunition factory will spark PVP almost every time. Did you take the workshop?
---
Kind of late to this thread but, as a father to a special needs kid myself, first of all let me say thanks for offering this to OP and your support, that's really awesome to see. 
---
Second, same. If you feel comfortable OP, I'm around level 95, give or take. I might not be triple digits like a lot of the griefers who play this game but, I'd be more than happy to help stand guard, use some stuff at you and your kids camp to make her happy, and even throw down some of my more rare CAMP objects and stuff I've picked up from the Atom Shop for you or her to use. 
---
Did you just "Why won't anyone think of the children?!" us?
---
&gt;If i gank someone i expect revenge and, well, pvp, not kids tears in headphones, it will make me feel terrible, and its your fault (and parents like you) , because you allowed your kid in a situation like this. 
---
You're basically blaming the victim for making you feel bad for being an arsehole. If you're going to be an arsehole, at least own it.
---
Let the parents of the child focus on parenting (or not parenting) their own kids.
---
I just killed the queen and it was very laggy 
---
Oh i agree see [this post thread further down](

https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b92u1v/why_give_a_character_name_if_the_game_only_uses/ek1wzxd?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share). 
---
Because even though this seems like such a simple thing considering the character names are already in the game, it *apparently* is just Im**fucking**possible.
---
Pacifist mode stays on when you claim a workshop. I've claimed several after the changes and it never turned off. It never auto turned off even before the changes. I've never had a workshop contested so I don't know how the changes to slap damage and pacifist work now tho. 
---
I really feel like top 3 players in survival mode should be those with the most player kills that life, not longest life. Me and my brother made new characters solely for survival mode to level and I know thats asking to have our shit kicked in by high level players, but the fact that just for enjoying ourselves for one hour and playing together we become top two usually and then have triple digit characters come hunt us and wipe us intentionally rather than randomly finding us and killing us kinda sucks. Personally I'd enjoy it like DayZ where no one is on the map and you can just randomly come across people, even if that meant I still got killed by the triple digit players all over the map. Better than being consistently hunted by them with no way to run.
---
My main point is just, I really hope Bethesda reconsiders which top 3 are on the map.
---
Just have Rose do covers of Big Iron
---
You can‚Äôt build using the owner‚Äôs ressources !
---
What kind of arsehole down votes a post asking for help/advice? From a returning player no less.
---
Not TOO much has changed. It's just more stable than your probably use to. Survival PvP mode is about the only major new thing worth noting.
---
Glad to help!! :)
---
178,107 players here, and only 85 there? Let's hope more people get to know about it.
---
Don't buy it they are all over the map I've sold about 10 of them already
---
Sorry, my mic? I'm not understanding
---
It happens. Sometimes it doesn't. Not as common as it use to be.
---
I like this idea. A permanent home and an outpost or forward base.
---
You can just give the resources to me if you want me to build for you. Besides, building supplies are usually cheap and common, mostly wood, steel and cloth. I'd rather charge in other supplies or even caps instead of junk. If you want something special to be buillt like a decon arch, you can give me the supplies one by one as they are vey specific. Most of the time, when I join low levels, I build in their camp for free. 
---
Finally a reasonable opinion. I would never let a kid play this. I think Fallout 4 is the best choice, or maybe some Sims
---
You can find atom shop items in the game?
---
You can fast travel to your C.A.M.P. for free from anywhere, so placing it somewhere convenient to the area you're exploring can be helpful when you're starting out. Don't marry yourself to a certain location until you're deeper into the game.
---
But at least they earned it in Survival mode which has more penalties for death and harder time traversing the map.
---
save your atoms. you can find that outfit all over the place. 
---
Why not just do it yourself I did it in half hour yesterday 
---
Leader of the Pack I think the quest is called? Also some of the horde events can have lower level minions for them depending on the minion and area the quest is in.
---
Dear Chernoobyl, 
---
Thank you. 
---
Sincerely. 
---
I find it quite nice when someone asks for help and gets it in heaps :) good work ...
---
If i was on i would have helped you as well :)
---
Use your microphone and talk to people. Not everything needs to be an inbuilt system. Sure, it'd be great to have everything set up such that you never needed to talk, but the entire point of the game is to socialise. 
---
You‚Äôre right, I agree.
---
I didn‚Äôt know atom shop items could be found in game
---
Most of the cheaters with hacks are in Survival now, the real question is why Bethesda is doing nothing about this?
---
There are a lot of sites selling this stuff (wallhacks, aimbots and so on), this game still don't have a good anti-cheat system?
---
What did you use to do it? I may use an alt character I don‚Äôt want to lose caps.
---
Obviously lol.
---
A pain in the butt imo. Easier to build indestructible floors floating in mid air. Just depends if the person is playing house or Fallout.
---
Yes, thats the name. It's great, as it gives several legendaries. I've not had more than 1\* though. The horde events are really random and sometimes bugged, but they are an option as well. Other than that I have nothing. 
---
Except your stealth means nothing once you've been alive for 40+ minutes and then are on the map at all times frequently...
---
Other games out there that would allow you and your kid to build without being unmolested. Also it sounds like you are fully aware of what this game is and how it‚Äôs setup yet you are somehow ignorant of the fact that raiders are still doing their thing in both game types. You should look in the mirror and take all of the blame for your child‚Äôs tears. It was YOUR decision to allow someone with developmental disabilities to take part in a mature PvP game. Then you get on Reddit looking for sympathy. Sad your brain works this way. I do feel sorry for your kid. Sorry that your kid is being raised by you. 
---
Lvl 229 adventure player only here pm me if you me to come on down with the big iron on my hip 
---
Isn't this an 18+ game? Not sure a youngster should be on it but what do I know...?
---
Not all of them infact very few but yes some
---
Atom shop one is clean, in game one is dirty
---
Thats good to hear thank you!
---
The atom shop one is clean and slightly different 
---
Welcome to the toxic element of online gaming, something I and others did not want Fallout to be, but it is.  
---
I have met mostly friendly players, but the occasional keyboard warrior tries to be something they are not, which is somewhat hilarious since Survival mode was added, they can't hurt me anymore in Adventure mode, zero damage to me, unless I fire back, it's gratifying to stand there doing the Help emote while they shoot or hit me.  
---
I know how it feels to have your CAMP attacked and in my case partially destroyed by a player using explosive rounds.  
---
There is a perk-card that helps with CAMP construction and repair, it's the Contractor Perk (Under Intelligence) and it goes up to Lvl 2 which reduces CAMP construction to 50% of materials.
---
Ah that makes sense.
---
A nice reference to Harry Potter
---
Dont play Survival then.
---
Xbox?mayby it was that server
---
PvE servers and PvP servers. They just need to get it done already. I was super excited when I heard about multiplayer fallout, because that meant Fallout COOP! awesome!  
---
But PvP? apex legends is right over there, get off my radiactive lawn...
---
It does help if you have multiple characters. I have a friend who named his alts armor, weapons, and junk. 
---
My sentiments exactly. All the blame deserves to be on this asshat of a parent. 
---
1-10 isn't really legendary hunting territory though. 
---
If you wanted legendaries that early on, you'd be better off frequenting train stations and hoping to find discarded legendaries in the suitcases there.
---
Things can actually happen, you know?
---
Not like you get a reward for being alive the longest.
---
They're buddies of mine on Xbox who literally destroy bases and nothing else
---
My first SBQ also failed - I've done all launching by myself, launched the nuke, tp to fight and was disconnected from the server - very disappointing experience.
---
I agree, which is why I don't let my daughter play this game, to be clear. I was just highlighting the similarities as compared to my youngest. I can empathize with his pain.
---
I've no idea how old ops daughter is
---
Just did it to my friends house 
---
Sure, but then you lose the positional effects and user interface integration with the radio. Also, broadcasting for all players on a server, not just you. It'd be fun to have your whole team on one soundtrack, for example.
---
Yeah it's like "I took my kid to this r rated movie and people were swearing in it and shooting each other and now they're upset! Thanks movie makers! There are real people watching your movies you know..."
---
Me and my brother started doing this after we were constantly on the top of the longest lived when only level 11. Otherwise we constantly had a level hundred-something chasing us that we couldn't see until we were laser beamed to death in a second.
---
Have you even read the post? 
---
Its mostly about needing armors with weight reduction for mules :-)
---
**Powering up Poseidon** sometimes gives leveled armor parts.
---
**Event: Collision Course** gives the Sommerset Special pistol, but once only I think.
---
Very rarely, level 1 Eyebots and Protectrons spawn at the **Whitespring Golf Club**, usually after the nuke zone dissipates.
---
**Event: Fertile soil** in Flatwoods sometimes gives leveled armor.
---
Rarely, **Morgantown Airport** spawns legendary scorched.
---
ROFL.... Nice community you have here Fo76
---
" When you are high level, your build is complete, you have all the plans, armors and weapons you need, what's left to do? " 
---
You wait for new content and not harass low level players nor engage ones that don't want PvP.
---
Well at least here you‚Äôve got the power to report those assholes in your inbox 
---
Damn, I guess I'm glad I changed out for the blue metal walls
---
I'm happy to hear this about camps.  I hate PvP.  That is not a judgment against those who like it.  But I think the griefers have gotten worse since survival mode for the reasons you outline above.  They want to harass people and they're not having fun when everyone is like them.  And now Adventure mode is filled with people who think they're safe from wannabe raiders which means prime pickings for a-holes.
---
I've had awesome interactions in this game and have made friends.  I don't even care that much about my camp blowing up since its so cheap to repair.  But the people who lure mobs toward me so they can jump in front of my attacks and provoke PvP to kill me and steal the junk I've just scavenged are really ticking me off.  I just immediately log off now and get into a different world.
---
this is why i love FO4 and didn‚Äôt even buy FO76. If it could be 100% pvp free, I‚Äôd buy and play. 
---
Depends on how heavy the grain of salt is.  
---
Okay. Thanks :-) Ive not done poseidon or fertile soil in ages. I hung around Morgantown airport A LOT when doing my second playthrough, cant ever remember seeing a legendary enemy there. Good place for a lot of things early on. 
---
Yeah on xbox I remember seeing one dude die and never come back 
---
I think it sucks ( the life away from enemies)
---
Easier to identify and block griefers, I guess.  I get griefed, I just have to look at their name and block them, boom game is fun again.
---
Could you do that if GT xXRandomschongwaver69Xx only had the character name DonsTomToms88 above thier head?  
---
I guess, if character names also had to be unique...  that would also ruin your immersion, but not as much...  AbeLincoln4score64 kinda works...
---
I'm pretty sure your response is for a different post. I said nothing about an inability to communicate. My frustration comes from the limited use of an owner's storage, mainly.
---
Yeah, no arguments if your empathy is close to zero and you are an inconsiderate asshole, then there's no room for any arguments and discussion at all. If you are not a self-centered piece of shit then you can actually put yourself in other people's shoes before commenting something like you did. Btw there is no "intended" way to play this game, so please stop with that bogus argument already. OP even mentioned that he's not specifically blaming the players who did it but Bethesda instead for not providing a fucking way to play their game without being harassed (what pacifist should do).
---
They were not playing on survival, so pacifist should eliminate all pvp damage done to your character or your camp. And to quote a classic asshole: "That's the end of the discussion, there can be no arguments beyond that point."
---
I would never let a kid play this game. Those players might not be bad people though we make them look like that.  I have 500++ hours on PC and nobody ever came to my camp and attack it. Not even once...
---
I came back to my C.A.M.P. once, and found a dead Scorchbeast. I obviously did nothing, and I don‚Äôt know if a player wasn‚Äôt here a moment before. But we can imagine that my 3 missile turrets did take it down. (I don‚Äôt remember what level it was)
---
What have they done to prevent anything like this happening? Make pacifist mode such as you and your camp CANNOT take damage from players in adventure mode and all this shit would be solved.
---
Fusion cores are rare? They are heavy but just take the batteries included perk.
---
Having Pacifist mode negate all CAMP damage hopefully will move all the keyboard warriors to Survival mode as it would deny them an obvious target for griefing players.  
---
I understand that some players want to role-play as a raider in Fallout 76, and that is their choice, but if you want to be scum in an online game world, the penalties should be similar to real life as possible, I mean we are supposed to treat others how we want to be treated, friendly and considerate, but I guess online gaming empowers the petty minded individuals who know that rolling up to a persons home and damaging it or destroying it in the real world has severe repercussions legally, nevermind getting their ass handed to them by the owner.
---
Sorry, not true. My two buddies and I decided to all make new characters a few days ago. We all started new games, and as soon as we got out the vault we joined sessions to all be in the same session. It loaded us all outside the doors of Vault 76 together and we immediately teamed up, level 2.
---
This. Or at least make it so, that if you turn on pacifist you and your camp are immune to damage from other players.
---
The griefers don't like it yah. Especially when a triple-digits battleaxe char with no caps or aid left to lose keeps coming after them in Survival.
---
You must live quite a miserable life if this is your thought process
---
FO76 is a PEGI 18 game for a reason. Im not sure your child should have been playing it. There are many games where you can peacefully build things.(and most of them are better building games than Fallout) Why did it have to be FO76, a game that was advertised from its first presentation on as a PVP game? A game that features a lot of gruesome imagery, blood, zombies and drugs. There is nothing wrong with what happened to you. You are playing the wrong game.
---
Mute em...  I muted multiplayer so long ago, I don't even know how to turn it back on.  Very few people have the speaker symbol on, so you will not be alone.
---
I honestly don't know how bad fallout 76 is unmuted...  is it usually cool?  Had some bad experiences in past games...
---
@Grimparrot u/Grimparrot . You know you can just leave that world and then re join and move your camp a few inches on the side and pay 40-80 caps and all is back in place right? Or is this not a thing anymore? Thanks
---
Don't get me wrong...I like fighting monsters...it's just at that point in my day I feel like I am done dealing with human beings and the relative complexities they present...give me some relatively linear AI...and I am happy...no worries about duped items being used to kill me, by humans in groups, who each have all their baggage from their realities they bring into the game, that then i am forced to experience.
---
I dunno, having raiders with names like ‚Äúhellokittyluvver88‚Äù adds a certain something to the game, IMO.
---
He did say special needs, their mental health isn‚Äôt up to mine or yours 
---
Which is an irrelevant observation...
---
Why would you do that ?
---
Yea I think the reward part is bugged, I think you only get caps an xp tho.
---
You shouldn't be the one who decides how someone has to play the game he bought.
---
I'm not saying that I like doing this stuff, but if you aren't in pacifist mode and in some way you get flagged for PvP, then it's your fault.
---
I honestly didn't know people around the world are so sensitive until i started playing Fallout 76. 
---
I'm guessing you've never played Rust?
---
Just a few of them can be found. For your Greaser jacket, just head to Watoga: one can spawn in the bus on the street below the buses in the train station parking lot, another one can spawn on some crates in the transport hub.
---
I for one am a raider , have all raider gear but I don‚Äôt destroy a base I either kill players who attack back and loot them or just do quests and sometimes help others , destroying a base is defo griefing 
---
Because they‚Äôre raiders. And they‚Äôre scum. 
---
Nah it's not glitched/bug mate. It's because the story isn't finished as of yet, we've not truly discovered the fate of the Oveerseer. Yes  her holotape for Mountside Lodge sounds pretty dicey, but I believe she didn't perish.  
---
As most people have pointed out, she does leave you a holotape after you complete "I am Become Death"  
---
Also need to take into consideration as of Fall 2019 this year, with the DLC "Wastelanders" there is more Main quests coming. Hopefully we'll get the final pieces to the Overseers Puzzle.
---
Oh yeah, I forgot
---
Worst part is you play with a headset and they still can't tell.  Tell hubby helium was cool that once, 6 years ago.  Its time for the joke to die honey.
---
Yup, seemed to work out that way. I think I counted 25 shots before running out of ap last night by just single tapping a powerful automatic combat rifle. Now I have to wait 9 levels and grab the commando perks.
---
I normally like playing as quite murderous characters. Im always Dark Brotherhood in Elder Scrolls games, Assassin classes when I can. I like playing a sneaky murdery character and despite not being the best at it, I love PVP. 
---
While I see nothing wrong with sneaking into a camp stealth killing a player and stealing some choice items, tearing their base apart is a step way too far. Losing a couple of items is annoying. Losing a base you spent hours / days working on is soul crushing. There's a big difference in my mind between PVPing or RPing, and just being a dick. 
---
If you have a friend, ask him to help you move your caps to an alt.
---
I'm always pacifist mode, I've never attacked anyone in the game (apart few times, when someone ask me to remove wanted status) or destroyed anything in anyone's CAMP. So someone who do this is just asshole for me, because he ruins my experience...
---
I just did my first  over the weekend. No issues. I haven‚Äôt really had server issues while in game. It‚Äôs more of a server issue when I try to join a server I get stuck some times   
---
Hate to be nerdy about it, but it's of course 1.25 shot. ;-)
---
wait you mean cows don't have a 2nd head?
---
Its a very big part of the game. Of course in pacifist this shouldnt happen, but otherwise its normal
---
üòÇüòàüëå
---
Didnt die but must be your server then,fack...
---
Bloodied variants aren't good unless you go for a bloodied build.  I would just use the 2 shot
---
Not being gullible to bullshit is an amazing life, thank you 
---
I‚Äôm sure it is
---
Well they are not so rare since you can get them at the nuclear power plant. Using batteries included is a good way to address this issue, yes.
---
I'm being downvoted because I dare say get over it in a situ6involving a special needs child. Reddit does love doing that.
---
Floating bases are ugly 
---
If you want to roleplay as Raiders, fine, but then dress like them. No more Raiders in Enclave power armor and BOS rifles. Own it. 
---
I did it on the Grafton Monster near Charleston Station no problem.
---
Totally agreed üëå
---
The extra star slots are for dissapointment in the RNG gods
---
Exactly that's what pacifist should be there for. 
---
Raiders do what they want and scavenge... They could scavenge x01
---
My son is 6 and loved when I let him march in the Fasnacht Parade it did bring a tear to my eye when he took down his first super mutant. My son enjoys the following games for base building Mine Craft, Portal Nights, and Dragon Quest Builders my son would be a Raider in FO76 if I let him play he loves destroying the bases I build in other games.
---
At first I thought this was you just being rude. Then I read their username. Checks out. Haha
---
Dude it's like $13 AUD on cdkeys atm, the AU/NZ codes work on the Beth launcher.
---
Just need a Raider Skin for that and i'm fine :D
---
Except the guy who posted this isn't the guy in the video.
---
If you find power armor you can take the armor off the shell and use the bare shell. It will give you immunity to fall damage and some other small perks. 
---
It is what is to be expected in this game until it isn't. So you have to put up with it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
---
Where is the holotape you get after you launch a nuke?
---
that one can. I can't think of any other though. 
---
That new desert camo could work
---
* You need to build a camp, not a settlement or a city. Don't pickup every piece of junk you see.
---
* Invest early in the bargain cards. They will help you have caps mainly at the beginning, when caps are a problem.
---
* If you face strong enemies, shoot them at their legs first. If they can't move, they are much easier to kill.
---
* Make sure you have a consistent input of purified water.
---
* Careful with drugs and alcohol. It's easy to get addicted. Harder to cure the addiction.
---
* Get your hands on a Vampire weapon. It will keep you alive even when facing enemies way higher lvl than you.
---
* Unless you plan to play a sniper, get your hands on a Power Armor chassis asap. There is one in the train wagos in Morgantown station.
---
Just stay over in Survival and we won‚Äôt laugh at your fedora.   Pinky promise.  
---
It's not a child's game.  Go play Hello Kitty Online.
---
I bought it on Phoenix before the whole vendor update came. I havent bothered to check it anymore if he still has it, but maybe try server hopping his wares, might be worth a shot.
---
I posted this the other day as well. Since we're all from a control vault this is how actual Raider RP would/should go:  
---
\*Raider: "Rawr! I's a Raider! My name is xX\_DETH\_Xx"  
---
Rational Person: "What? Your name is Steve, you're the vault orthodontist... We've met. Are you high?"  
---
\*Raider: "NO! I's a Raider! RAWR!" \*shoots TSE wildly in random directions\*  
---
Rational Person: "Shut up, Steve."  
---
\*Steve takes off his helmet and kicks a dented tin can\*  
---
Steve: "You're no fun."
---
^(\*Not actually a raider)
---
Not at launch. And remember what happened with the Beth Launcher when F76 launched?  
---
They SHOULD have used Steam, Epic and anything else that wasn't buggy as sh!t.
---
This - if the secret wall is open just change server. On new one look for near players and if none is present near Overlook cabin fast travel for code and back to open the wall.
---
I'm really hoping the overseer is not dead 
---
from memory, it sits in the spot of the Holotape for Bunker's Alpha, Bravo and Charlie after you collect those holotapes and nuke somewhere that isn't Fissure site prime. 
---
I agree we don't need pvp and pvp lite... we need pvp and no pvp.
---
I think that I‚Äôve seen someone with it, don‚Äôt remember if I bought it tho...
---
What platform and names as these trash are getting hunted.
---
I think I have it on a couple of characters, probably from the BoS trader in Watoga. However since I am not in game, take it with a grain of salt. 
---
Play minecraft then or dont get your child to play your adult game you like gtfo the server hope ur kids gets wiped again 
---
Your anger is right and just and I bet the rp raiders are not dressed as raiders. All decked out in bos or ox-1 saying I‚Äôm just rping ..... if you rp use raider gear. I do see real raiders rping but if your decked to the nines that not rping that‚Äôs griefing son. 
---
Don't play solo.
---
Go back and read again. This post underlines a flaw in the PvP of this game. A community has the right to call out a flaw, no matter how big or small.
---
Count me in. Level 167, Xbox one.

That, or my shneeky shniper. They lay one hand on that base and I‚Äôll shoot it off.

Always up for laid back pve play, but I‚Äôm kitted to fight. No mic and no pressure.

Sounds like someone couldn't cut it in the PvP servers.
---
&gt; I got combative below, and I'm sorry . I do hope said combativeness did not lession the message I was hoping to send too much. We need to all remember that other people in the game are people, and you never know who is behind the other screen.
---
Sorry for saying that but you're kinda acting like the guys that hit your camp.
---
No not 24 machines for christ sake, it can be just one hub and you can see all the items every player has for sale on the server
---
üôÑ
---
"My special needs kids" 
---
Honestly the victim mentally is just sad at this point. So fucking what rebuild it and grow up.
---
It's not a bug, but Bethesda was pretty crude about the way they left the Overseer's story open until future DLC.
---
They should have left the "I'm dying" holotape or the "You're an asshat for launching a nuke" holotape, but not both.
---
Tell me you also learned about the Starched Genes perk.
---
Pacifist is not a mode that prevents you from being harassed. It prevents you from accidently harassing someone else. Being a pacifist doesnt mean that no one can hit you. 
---
Btw PVP is intended in FO76. One of the first videos we saw featured to players shooting each other. Todd Howard himself talked about how funny it is to kill people in FO76. 
---
Which one is that, whats it for. Sorry just never hear of it and it sounds interesting.
---
Player vending should help. I personally rarely ever trade with anyone because the trade window is so buggy and I don't want to lose anything accidentally. Though being able to throw a bunch of items in a machine with a price tag is much more my speed.
---
doh! ü§¶‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Raider armor/trapper set  still the best.Badass 
---
Yeah, it's a real pain in the neck.
---
Had that problem the last time I played a few days ago on console, 2 other and I tried to form a team and we all ended up having to close the game and re enter 
---
Try irradiating them, and then switching to something like a lever action, or melee if close enough. 
---
Thought that was just me
---
Yeah I‚Äôm not buying your ‚Äúthe game is built with assholes in mind‚Äù 
---
If he still has it, I'm not seeing it. He was the first place I looked. 
---
is makeshift warrior 5 an option from the deck, or was it already in your selected and 
---
assgined perks?  
---
Asking b/c I've never seen a maxed out card in the deck/pack.
---
Sounds like you were in the rerrange/reassign existing perks screen, not the actual add a new perk/point screen.
---
When you open your pipboy, is is the perk slection command flashing (its triangle on the ps4) or solid?
---
If flashing, you have not yet selected a perk to level up.  You'll get to pick a new card from the deack.  
---
if it is solid, youve assigned the point, and you'll be able to select a card from what you've already drawn, or rearrange what you already have.
---
Destroying camps is a necessity. Before release Bethesda thought about making them indestructable, but they ran into the problem that you could build-in other players. A player needs a way to free themself when another player build walls all around him. The simple solution: destroy the walls.
---
And this is a good thing.  But as with so many other problems in this game, the horse is out of the barn, down the road, and sired a herd of wild radiated horsies with glowing red eyes, fangs, clawed cloven hooves, and prehensile scorpion tails tipped with mini-nukes at the end of them that emit the vile screams of 13 year-old boys whose balls haven't dropped and are hopped up Mountain Dew taunting the players around them with threats of screaming their moms and teabagging their corpses.
---
What I would welcome is a PVP hostility tripwire.  If you attack another player who is in pacifist mode and you're not, after a few attacks you're loaded into another server where everything is nuked, and everything is KOS: squirrels, bunnies, ticks travel in packs with alphas, deathclaws in hunting packs, etc.
---
Love your reply I role play a cowboy and dress and use appropriate weapons im lvl 229 don‚Äôt pvp but pretty sure I can hold my own with my smoking guns also willing to help 
---
Boohoo
---
It's a video game. She'll live
---
That, or increase the size of the camp and it's corresponding budget.
---
Scorched killer receiver mods and the sacrificial blade mod for the machete both give you 4 stars when applied to 3 star weapons
---
The mods scorched killer reciever and sacrificial blade count as a legendary effect, adding the additional star. I'm not sure if primes do the same.
---
I get that but it would be awesome.  
---
They could provide the listing of all of the tracks available and the user would be able to provide the songs and order to play them in to bypass that tricky legal issue.
---
This is a m rated game with pvp, who decided that people acting a way you don't like is greifing, people are gonna blow your stuff up and kill you in a pvp game. Don't like it play the infinite amount of non pvp games.
---
I also thought exactly that hahaha
---
Use the Overseer's cache boxes. Link them together so extra "gifts" deposited in one are available at all. 
---
They are at all the beginner checkpoints so noobs can get them but also some higher level areas so experienced player can deposit without having to travel.
---
It is the corrugated metal bench. It looks damn great. 
---
To add to your point: Destroying camps is a necessary feature. Before release Bethesda thought about making camps indestructable, but they ran into the problem that you could build-in other players. A player needs a way to free themself when another player build walls all around him. The simple solution: destroy the walls. 
---
I would suggest selling clothing/outfits, and drugs that you find instead of junk. some really common outfits fetch pretty good coin. also Get hard bargain maxed, and eat grape mentats before buying/selling
---
This.
---
I get it where OP is coming from, but some of us don't really care about realism. For some of us it's all about functionality, which is why you wont find anything decorative from my camp. Only turrets, work stations, 1 bed, 1 instrument, lights, a fusion generator, water purifier(s) and that's about it.
---
Though I am currently thinking about building my camp at a worlds static building. Or at the buildings frontyard to be precise. Just slap work benches around the yard and maybe fences to protect them with a few turrets.
---
Never in real danger unless you are over encumbered and fresh out of fusion cores for your excavator armor. üòÄ

Level 151 Responder here. On PS4. If anyone needs a little help, message me. I'm 100% Chameleon sniper build, so if your base is under attack, they'll never see me coming.

---
Something like this running high-life and assassin's cav armor, or mostly cav. I'm currently running a mix of sentinel and cav but that's mostly preference. Regardless you need cavs since you have to close distance.
---
Here's the rationale for some weird seeming perk choices.
---
Fireproof 2 with dense is as immune to explosions as you can get. The third rank of fireproof can't really reduce a 0 to below 0 so it's a wasted point with a dense chest. I don't really think any of the other chest mods even come close to being as necessary as dense but if for some reason you wanted to run say, pneumatic, or power armor, the third rank might be worthwhile. That said some explosions still hurt no matter what, like plasma grenades. Haven't really figured out what's going on there yet, just be aware of it.
---
Tenderizer is supposed to be multiplicative with other damage perks but this is basically impossible to test. Regardless the return per rank is kinda bad so I'd just grab the supposed multiplicative scaling and be done with it.
---
Tanky things cause I get shot  a lot, and I'm often caught out in the open since that's, you know, where the thing I'm trying to kill is.
---
I don't use born survivor yet personally, but I should. You can't stim and run at the same time so keeping cavs up and healing at the same time I could see being valuable and it's a change I'm likely going to make soon.
---
Action boy one, since testing seems to indicate that perk ap regen dosen't exceed 45%. So lone wanderer and action boy are cap. Stacks with armor regen though so use that too if you can get it.
---
Gun fu is just something I like. It works with melee and I find it a little annoying to constantly re-enter vats when I'm charging crits. Plus I'm optimized for PvP dmg so PvE mobs can actually be a lot harder to kill and 10% dmg is nice for that. Basically just use this point for something else if you want.
---
I don't run class freak and for the most part I don't find it necessary to suppress mutations either. I'll take a serum and suppress talons to get the agility back but the negatives to like every other mutation I run are to things I don't care about being worse anyway. Do take plague walker though. It doesn't really have a downside in PvP and it drains their ap if they run dodgy.
---
No durability perks since weapons break a lot slower when you're not charging through hoards of things. 1 int cause I really really don't want levels and xp gain scales up with int. You can have higher int though and still have an effective int of 1 with marsupial so you could put points here if you want.
---
Four leaf just cause I prefer it over crit savy. Run whichever of the two you like.
---
Curator because depending on the bobblehead and perk mag choices you get between 1-8 perk points worth of stats for the low low cost of 1 perk point.
---
That's pretty much it, the rest is whatever you want really. Honestly I might even be able to cut out some damage perks. I'm not sure but even three ranks of bloody mess might be over kill and points better spent elsewhere. 
---
hahaha this is great 
---
It's probably so that character saves can be different from one another by the names you give your characters.
---
Even if that were the case, we're all level 70-130ish. If there is a minimum level, some people might benefit from being reminded of it. :)
---
I agree that PvP should be removed entirely from the Adventure mode. Not just just a tweak to Pacifist mode, but a complete gutting of PvP. 
---

---
That event at the giant teapot gives out low level legendaries occasionally.  Did that one quite a bit when I was 1st starting out.
---
How can the game allow people to do this while i cant even stack the stairs that have the floor on them on top of each other.
---
Nothing in link? Doesn‚Äôt sound like hacking. Sounds like he just knows what he likes to use. 
---
There's no argument because the ball is, and always was, in OPs court. I don't quite understand what you mean by "there is no intended way to play this game", what does that mean? Are you arguing that there is no intended way to play the game, therefore any way you play the game is perfectly acceptable? Then the PVP is completely acceptable too, it can't go one way. There clearly is intended ways to play the game, for example it being online. Interacting with other people is part of the intended experience.
---
OP certainly lied about who they are blaming, as can be seen in this comment:
---
"I firmly believe in everyones right to be a freaky neckbeard fedora wearing incel who lives in their moms basement and gets their jollies by being a murderhobo. Truly. I would just like the ability to not play with them".
---
Here's a quote regarding pacifist mode from Bethesdas website:
---
"Pacifist mode can help ensure you do not become flagged as hostile or wanted. It will also reduce the risk of being killed by other players. "
---

Okay. Cool. I'll try that
---
You are making yourself out to be a martyr, when in reality you let your daughter play a game that was inappropriate for her. This isn‚Äôt a situation where everyone should be nicer to you and your daughter this is where you should be a better parent. 
---
*Not actually Steve either
---
I agree. For lack of a better phrase, I feel like people made such a High School drama out of this whole thing. 
---
Yes it I was a bad launch. And I hope they learned from it. But to think that this was a total flop immediately was pretty Naive and short sighted. 
---
Where? I need that lol
---
Ahh I see it furniture not like a work bench. Thanks!
---
Remove his username, this is witch hunting
---
Hope for a legendary bot spawn at Whitespring....tons of level 1 legendaries 
---
yeah, when you deside what you like to use you tend to collect / trade for just "that" stuff...
---
And if you are at a mid /  high level you will have several with the same stat.
---
You can just fast travel out where is there a problem
---
Harpoon is between the best heavy guns for vats. I had a pistolero vats build when I got a QE harpoon and without any perks for it it instantly became my main weapon. Its like a little bit less ridiculous the dragon with faster reload.
---
Well, I was excited, but when fo76 launched and heard about messy launch, well, I just listened to everyone and moved forward, forgetting about it. Few days back, I got bored and saw discount on fo76 PC version, so I bought it. Now playing 3 days, level 15 and so far loving it, playing solo mostly. Only annoying thing I encountered is crashes to the desktop. There was a moment where every time I approach Morgantown game just freezes and crash 7 times in a row, fortunately now I got past that thing. Right now I very enjoy Appalachia and my felling is I'll stuck here for a long time. Community here is the best!
---
Has to be a melee power attack. Normal melee attack doesn't work.
---
I am having a similar issue with my buddy. He recently bought the game and we cannot get on a team no matter what we try. He is over level five. I am able to send him invites but he never receives them. If he sends me one I am able to see and click accept on it but nothing happens. We were able to get on a team once and it bugged out and we both lost all our current quests. The kicker is he is in Canada and I am in the USA. So at least for us it is not an IP issue. 
---
Please read my whole post. I'm not only talking about fallout76. Games like Rage 2 etc are LAUNCHING on steam. Which is different. 
---
What do you do?   See if he is selling anything good.  
---
For the newbs just starting out in the game, ALWAYS
---
1) read the patch notes.
---
2) be mindful of your surroundings 
---
The game has had a lot of improvements since rollout.
---
The most recent is 0 slap damage from griefers. 
---
But, you can still get baited into pvp while in adventure mode if you attack or respond to taunts or slap while pacifists is enabled.
---
I dont know why folks think it‚Äôs too hard or too tedious to preemptively block a douchebaggery GT before they start trashing your camp,  server hop, and then complain why pacifists mode doesn‚Äôt work they way they thought it should. If you haven‚Äôt figured out how to do that first, you‚Äôre part of the problem. Hell youre enabling some assholes need to screw over some victim.
---
Folks need to start owning some of the problems they complain about, especially if it could‚Äôve been easily avoided.
---
Fwiw, just like in real life, assholes exist ingame. Just like in real life, you can avoid that drama by
---
Being informed, being situationally aware of your surroundings, and treat everyone around you as entitled sociopaths, out to steal, maim or kill you.
---
Set your risk responses to high, your ingame user to user interactions/ expectations low, and every nice thing that happens ingame is a pleasant surprise.
---
Ah, I'm at work at that time. Good luck
---
Caos are unlimited, junk is too, you can find them both indefinitely, granted you can only carry so much but still you get what I mean. These two things being true means that the "raiders" do shit like this for no better reason than to just make other people feel like shit. They don't think there's someone else on the other side of the screen, or they know that and love that their getting their rocks off by being an asshole. The people that say this is a game mechanic only want an excuse for being a dick to people. Just because you have the ability to break what people build and take what people have doesn't mean that you should. 
---
No this is very relatable
---
I guess most online pvp games have this same issue so I doubt it's something easy to address. I did some "research" (ten minutes of goggling) so I'm by no means an expert but I assume this issue will persist. Fortunately, I haven't experienced anything like the video above and have had a lot of fun with survival so far. 
---
Placeholders
---
I just want them to release the private servers. That will pretty much fix a lot of my issues with camps and workshops. 
---
&gt; People who get their enjoyment out of ruining another person's game don't deserve the same consideration.
---
how fucking fragile are you, jesus. its a multiplayer game with INTENTIONAL RAIDING MECHANICS. people can play the game they bought however they fuck they want, jesus christ, deciding to destroy a building in a video game holds no credibility on who you are as a person, and people who play differently to how you play the game 100% deserve consideration, they don't need to conform to your high horse fragile bull shit lmao
---
Could you share you build? 
---
As another post said they need to put kama back in.  
---
I‚Äôd take this down. Not right to post someone‚Äôs name like that just because they have items. Hell I‚Äôd hate for you to see the inventory of my mule characters. üôÑ
---
I heard that the challenge legendaries are not tradable.
---
Nope makes base items cheap as well!
---
I guess to tell our own characters apart to us?
---
He coulda avoided this whole post by reading the patch notes, block the griefers GT and or server hop. Spend 5minutes to block and hop, or spend hours rebuild or move camp to a less traveled location and away from griefers.
---
Common (and really annoying) bug. Hopping servers usually fixes it. 
---
These monstrsities are part of the reason i stay the hell away from Whitesprings. Most of them are there. I get that it's very practical but how can one look at it and not vomit is beyond me.
---
Or Charlie Daniels 
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 and since survival dropped I have had 0 problems with griefers 
---
These stories always leave me flabbergasted. Mostly because I've been playing since launch and have come across ***maybe*** a dozen other players? I've only ever seen ONE other person in my camp too, and he was just there to kill me for my bounty.
---
The balance scaling in place for low levels against higher level players is kinda hilarious right now. On my first day of Survival with a new alt I had hit the top 3 longest lives so I was being super paranoid. Heard someone running towards me, turned around to see a level 100+ guy in a mask and a deathclaw gauntlet running towards me. Opened fire with my automatic pipe rifle expecting to die but was pleasantly surprised to see him go down pretty quickly.
---
Because of its failure as a game its a more tight knit community and its only filled with people who were willing to give the game a chance and long time fallout fans. 
---
Just a suggestion for you, if you ever need ammo.
---
Take Excavator armour, go to Lucky Hole Mine and Hornwright testing Site #2
---
The first will get you a large amount of Lead Ore (roughly 300), the second will get you Iron ore (roughly 200).
---
Grab Hemlock Holes and/or kill Snallygasters, Grafton Monsters and Yao Guai's for Acid.
---
Smelt it all down for roughly 750 Lead and 500 Iron (if you are level 50+ Invest in Super Duper if you don't have it already to vastly increase your yields from smelting)
---
Keep on Super Duper and use Ammosmith and you'll be able to make an absolute shit-ton of 5.56 rounds. Honestly your biggest problem will be getting enough steel to keep up with all the lead from Lucky Hole Mine.
---
Google both locations for in-depth videos that show where to find all the nodes.
---
Do this and you'll be able to fill all your ammo needs :)
---
It's an annoying "feature." What tends to happen is that distance/terrain/elevation/environment obstruction is causing a hindrance to the method of wire attaching. What I do is put the two things as close as possible so it will attach, once it does - move it, it will show you the "range" of an area in which it is allowed to be placed away from the generator.
---
What is a man?
---
It‚Äôs part of them game, Bethesda doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúincentivize‚Äùgriefing, stop complaining.
---
I didn‚Äôt get that note..? What did I do wrong? 
---
I have several characters I use as Vendors, and at one time they all had elaborate Shops with rad showers for public use, but they kept getting trashed by AssHats, so the rad Showers are all in storage waiting for the update that makes them immune to shitheads.
---
I frequently see players commenting that they attack bases to initiate PVP, but that's a bullshit statement, used by pussies, since there are many really simple ways to initiate PVP that do not require destroying some lower level players hard work.
---
I'm level 175+ on my main, and although I'm not particularly interested in PVP, I am pretty good at it when I choose to be, the crew I run with and myself, can be particularly good at Griefing the Asshats that can't handle survival mode, and choose to harass people in Adventure mode instead.
---
If you want, just PM me their GTs (we're on Xbox) and we will hunt them down, ruin their day, and send you the pictures.
---
Gotta go to that one cave in the mire to start the enclave quest.
---
I don't even have sentinel/assassin armor and I would easily shake off simple minigun fire to get close enough to easily stab through your fancy, clunky, not as good as you think power armor with my sword. 
---
Also, if you are being flushed from cover with grenades than you shouldn't  be in survival. 
---
When people try that in fact I just stand there. 
---
Grenades are easy to shake off. Probably easier than whatever gun the other guy is holding. 
---
  The kill a wendigo while wearing a clown suit will return over and over, even after you've done it.   The other stuff you have to kill before you even get to the wendigo are going to be tough enough.
---
It is not storyline related, just a fun little diversion.   
---
You can safely ignore it.  If you really want to complete it, I'd wait at least 10 more levels before trying again.  (I didn't do this one until I was in the low 40s)
---
Wouldn't mind killing some more of you fellers with my preston garvey build
---
Wut
---
That would be *sexist*
---
Won't be on for about 12 hours but I can if you dont find someone before then. 100 caps per armor piece 
---
You need to go back to the silo and there will be new recording, I think.
---
I like the idea of this, like some new kind of stash we can craft at our C.A.M.P but only for caps. Could have the new stash be placed alongside existing stash boxes at train stations and such. 
---
Personally I'd use it as saving fund, store caps away for rainy days when I find something I really want. 
---
I crouched and shot a Brahmin and completed it last night.  I don‚Äôt have any melee perks so maybe that‚Äôs why it let me do it with a rifle.
---
You were the one trying to tell someone that they are not playing the game "right". I never said that the guys who were the "griefers" here did anything wrong. I said there should be a way to avoid all of that in adventure mode if you don't want to participate in it. 
---
The comment you quoted from OP just reaffirms that he's not mad at the players so I'm not sure what you want to prove with that. 
---
I now exactly what pacifist mode is currently. I said what pacifist SHOULD be. 
---
...yes üòÇ
---
Thanks! Just in any silo? I didn‚Äôt play much after I finished that quest and launched one nuke on prime.
---
You really shouldn't post their name here. you don't know that they did anything wrong. 
---
I have mostly good encounters with other players. Just an occasional jerk or weirdo sometimes.
---
GTA V online mode does the same thing, allowing you to name individual characters, but having your gamertag show in the game. The point of it is to differentiate between your characters, and to prevent people from harassing/scamming you and switching to an alt to harass/scam you again. It‚Äôs a shame they don‚Äôt show both names, though.
---
I get that...Just feels super limiting on what Spending Atoms feels worth on
---
The silo you did I am become Death from, I guess.
---
Yup! This....
---
I always try to be nice, and when i have a double of one legendary i normally give it away. But when they ask for my weapons and i decline, then they start giving me attitude. Thats when i open fire and give them a live demo of what the weapons they requested can do. 
---
Also if they seek revenge, i farm them for junk and caps. 
---
Hm can‚Äôt remember which one it was but thanks. 
---
This is the exact reason.  All the toxic people are back to playing callof duty but still posting ‚Äúrefund‚Äù on all of Bethesda‚Äôs social media posts. Leaving behind the players who actually have a head on their shoulders and understand a nylon bag isn‚Äôt the end of the world. 
---
Ok, again:
---
&gt; but Bethesda instead for not providing a fucking way to play their game without being harassed (what pacifist **should** do)
---
I never said that pacifist is CURRENTLY a mode that prevents you from being harassed ffs. I now pvp is intended but since survival mode was created specifically for people who want to pvp, you should be able to choose whether or not you want to participate in pvp in adventure mode.
---
Also when you have an overly toxic component of the community,  like we did,  the people who are kind and supportive rise up to balance them out. 
---
It's like antibodies fighting a disease,  or the light rising to fight the dark. imo.
---
Thank fucking god. 
---
I'll add that to my list of things that have been suggested. Thanks.
---
yeah, i have like 3 or 4 anti armor rolling pin's on mine, lol :D
---
I'm guessing that most people playing this game just arent the pvp type(fallout audience vs call of duty audience) and that most of the "casuals" are playing fortnite or something.
---
Ha, I really truly wish it was. No, I've come to the realization that voice is actually quite high so "muffins" unfortunately fits. 
---
Bloodied build isn‚Äôt out of the question, maybe not an optimal build with vats and sneak, but I can slot in Nerd Rage without much fuss. Thanks :)
---
Let the bodies hit the FLOOOOOOOOOOORRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Look I understand that your upset with what happened and I can‚Äôt blame you I would be too but when the game launched Bethesda wanted a ‚Äúbe who you want to be experience‚Äù so I don‚Äôt blame these guys for anything because they also would have not known the situation behind the scenes so I ‚ÄúPersonally‚Äù believe they did nothing wrong
---
*know I‚Äôm the one thinking I‚Äôm going to get downvoted to hell because an opinion is hate speech these days*
---
I play as a raider and I dress as one and I don‚Äôt use power armor and so you know there is a raider subreddit but it is pretty dead what system you on?
---
I like the idea that it leaves you in suspense. If you were really out there in the wasteland trying to track her down, you could go weeks or months without hearing anything, never knowing if the communication you find would be the last one or not. 
---
I bought it yesterday from one of the vendors in watoga, can't remember if it was Phoenix or the guy in the train station
---
Shame you‚Äôre being downvoted for speaking the truth. 
---
I built my camp in the ash heap when the game launched and never moved it. I've had a grand total of 1 visitor and he was only there for my bounty.
---
Oh :) I‚Äôve never liked the Dragon cause of the reload, so a faster version sounds nice :) thanks :)
---
* Don't fast travel. Fast traveling, unless it's your camp or the Vault is expensive. Walk and kill everything. 
---
* Play events. Good income of Aid, Plans and Caps. Not to mention XP.
---
* Pick up the weapons enemies drop and deconstruct them: great way to get steel and learn mods.
---
* Pick up all the plastic you see and use it to bulk your junk. This way you can sell it to Vendors.
---
* Have a second weapon ready for use. Until you have perks to repair weapons to 200%, they will break quite fast.
---
* You can lock the resources in your camp: enter modify mode and R2 on a purifier (for example). Nobody will be able to steal your resources.
---
* Vendors are faction-based. There are 7. Make sure to visit them every 20 hours or so to maximize the caps (well, those that you can reach, mainly Sutton and Morgantown at the beginning)
---
* Avoid Mama Dolce. Really. Great way to lose a power armor piece for nothing during the Event.
---
* Careful to the MISC section of the pipboy as some items there weight a lot. Mainl ores.
---
* Set pacify mode in Settings/Game to On. You don't wanna get a bounty on error and lose caps.
---
* Ignore people slapping you. They can't really do anything to you.
---
* Stock up food that do not spoil until you have a consistent input of meat.
---
It must rotate, then. I was hoping that wasn't the case.
---
Hey man, it‚Äôs a great work out
---
What your gamer tag mate I'll join when update drops and get a few bits. 
---
I wouldn't mind having some more people to play with on Xbone. I'd love to come by and say hi and make use of your kid's camp.
---
Could‚Äôve sworn you couldn‚Äôt get quantum x-01 on ‚Äò76 without cheating....
---
Until one of you grabs a workshop and then rushes to the forums crying about being killed. A tale as old as...the game, I guess. 
---
Deal 
---
Definitely as I don't want to put perk cards into the modding so that would help me. Same with armour. 
---
I find it so weird that people find this to be such an issue. I know its anecdotal, but I've been playing pretty much nothing but Survival for a week and I've never once even seen another player at a spawn- much less waiting there to kill me. And I go to Whitespring station a few times a night because my camp is right there. 
---
You have been able to for weeks. Have you been living under a rock?
---
Wait.... butchers bounty works on tick blood? GAME CHANGER
---
Sort of 
---
Damn. This was hard to read, I'm sorry this happened. 
---
This was a great tip! I only have Rank 2 of 4 Leaf but got the challenge in under an hour at Wes Tek last night. Also ran into about 6 Legendaries, which never happens to me in Adventure.
---
Oh? If this is true I wasn‚Äôt aware of this. But I think it‚Äôs just painted like the Quantum armor and doesn‚Äôt actually have the stats of one. Because I see T-60 that has higher stats than it.
---
I set my camp up in the ash heap back when the game launched and have yet to move it. Literally only ever had 1 guy pass through and that's because he was hunting me for my bounty.
---
You must be talking about adventure mode?
---
Mate this game is rated 18 (mature), folk aren't going to play the game differently to not upset kids. I'm sure there's better games for building than an online survival game made for the adults where you run the risk of them hearing god knows what through voice chat. 
---
You want to implement something specifically to cheat the system. I wouldn't hold your breath. 
---
Happy to help also, lvl 125. I had 3 ~100 lvl players destroy my entire camp when I was putting my son to bed so I understand where you‚Äôre coming from. 
---
They didn‚Äôt remove explosive weapons. They were nerfed a bit, though they are still quite powerful. 
---
If you‚Äôre in pacifist mode then you cannot be attacked - unless you have claimed the workshop. Every time you die you‚Äôre given the option to spawn faaaar away. Why the heck would you continue spawning near the person who keeps killing you ‚Äúover and over‚Äù? 
---
So essentially you stopped playing because you lacked a fundamental understanding of PvP mechanics. There‚Äôs absolutely no reason to put yourself in a position where you‚Äôre being killed repeatedly. That‚Äôs entirely on you. 
---
Well now there's a long string of things you can do in-game that gets you the key to TNT Dome 7 at Black Mountain Ordiance Works which has the plans for the Quantum X-01 paint inside. 
---
May be doing one around 1pm Est today as well. Will post if so
---
Thank you for the Hornwritght Testing steel tip
---
Steel has been my bottleneck...have thousands of gunpowder and once I learned about Lucky Hole for lead I was set
---
Definitely #9.
---
They also need to allow for big trees to be demolished I have a huge one in my camp I need moved
---
These guys sound more like they're playing as bandits than raiders.
---
That is exactly what caused me to stop playing. I even got nuked once and deleted the game since I spent forever building my fort and had been repeatedly getting griefed by various other players for a few hours.
---
Hi I just did the acorchbeast Queen and it lagged insanely and by the end I had to close the game and reopen because it was just frozen.
---
I wonder, how do I know if this is PC lag or server lag?
---
I have the settings in high and a GTX 1070Ti 16gb ram amd ryzen 5. Never lagged the game with fps till the nuke and scorchbeast.
---
It sucks cause I really wanted to be part of the event...
---
Any recommendations on how to improve it?
---
I did disconnect and connect but the issue still persisted. Will try again tomorrow. As for the terrain, generators and pylons are built on the roof of my camp, so its all flat with no obstacles.
---
I'd be happy to rob you sometime if you want.
---
It was easier than I thought it would be. Use a shotgun and 4 Leaf Cover if you have it (I only have Rank 2 and it still goes off almost every other shot, plus each crit counts for multiple hits with the shotgun).  I ran through the Mistress of Mysteries house (high concentration of easy enemies) and got about a 1/3rd of the challenge done in one go. Moved to Wes Tek for the rest.
---
Or unless you are fresh out of the vault with a puny little pipe shooter, 4 rounds, of ammo, no stim packs, no armor, and are transported somewhere into the Savage Divide. :)   The first time I drank vintage nukashine, I woke up with two scorchbeasts circling overhead outside.   Would suck for that to happen to someone whose only real defense would be to throw their party hat at the wingy bois and run like hell.  
---
Ohhhhhh. I bet that‚Äôs what happened to my mentats withdrawal. Dang
---
Except that is a prime location for farming a large amount of high level enemies for high level players, so you are negatively impacted other players by having an armed base there.
---
This is very clever, now you've got me inspired to try some weird shit at my camp ;). 
---
RP(G) and PVP is something you can't combine and always end in Chaos if you try. Thats why we got two Gamemodes i guess.
---
Not back to COD so much as LOL and Fallout New Vegas Multiplayer cause it's less buggy and runs better than FO76. I am excited for it to get to the point where it was supposed to be. I hope we get there soon.
---
\&gt; flabbergasted at the prices of items. I‚Äôve been called nuts, insane, and 
---
\&gt;overpriced a bunch of times.  
---
Recall in the trade screen, the system shows the "value" of a given item.
---
If that value is 90 caps any given seller is asking 3k+
---
I can understand the reaction.
---
You re scaring me with your golfskirt üòÅ We are already friends
---
I'm convinced the glory posts are from people who this is the only game they have to play. It's alright for like a week or two because in that span you can explore a majority of the map. Then it just because a tedium of gather resources to do events to gather more resources. Plenty of better games have been released in the meantime. I might come back once they release some actual additional content and not "here's some more things to craft".

I wonder if the backpack addition might somehow implement this 
---
I suspect the character name is simply for the character save file, but how hard would it be to add an option to show either Name or GamerTag?
---
When I see a base there I even shut the back door to break line of sight to the ghouls I'm killing, but somehow it opens back up for the guns, no one was there.
---
üôÑ they're already fixing it

I want to retain 5 charisma for travel agent and lone wanderer.   And I‚Äôm like 99% sure that a -2 effect will put me where serums can be sold for exactly 200 to vendors.   Since I can make them (marsupial), that would completely negate me picking up garbage to sell to vendors  
---
A robot host would fit the lore maybe. Biv would make a good dj ;)  
---
Pick all battered clipboards and fans for springs and screws. The former especially took me a while to realize and they're hard to miss!

Run the Powering up _______ events once or twice to get good generator plans, not sure if I got lucky but I got the fusion gen on first one. 
---
Oh and welcome to Appalachia! 
---
PCs a larger player base so if you through a big enough net you find more fish. The reason most issues come from pc is that there are a ton more people one pc then PS4 because consoles are split up between Xbox and PS4 while pc is just pc.
---
I take it you're not a "morning person"...
---
I'm Xbone and I've never had this happen - but in a community of 10's of thousands of players, the likelihood that **someone** will run into **someone else** who is a jerk is astronomically high.  Anyway - I'm glad true pacifist is coming (getting tired of morons who run up on me with half health and a powerfist and expect me to fall for it).
---
You can't tame deathclaws from there. It's a set location so a deathclaw spawns there every time
---
I would like to help you out with junk or just hanging around and guarding your camp. Send me your gamertag. I‚Äòm lvl 237 on xbox.
---
Have a friend hold your caps then log on with your alt.
---
Just tell them to go grind out their own. Can‚Äôt be that hard, right?! They‚Äôre only worth 250 caps!!!
---
Totally agree ;)
---
It happens like 1/10 times and I feel like it use to be like 1/2 the time. 
---
The 76 has evolved since release is very true to life if you were to emerge from a vault after nuclear destruction. 
---
At release there were lots of bugs and thing were broken. Much the same if you were the first person out into the wasteland. It would be crazy to think everything would work perfectly after being destroyed. 
---
Then as more people emerged from the vault there would naturally be a struggle for power and dominance. The strong would get stronger and take advantage of the weak. Lots of killing and raiding. These people would eventually end up killing them selves off due to thirst for power. 
---
Those that just wanted to rebuild the world as more of a community would lay low during the power struggle. However there numbers would grow to be the majority eventually outnumbering the more bloodthirsty population. 
---
This is where the game is currently. You still have raider and PKers but not like you did in the beginning. More people just want to help you rather than kill you. 
---
Lol yup that we are and hey it‚Äôs strictly for a comfort thing I like the breeze down below!!
---
Charleston Herald (if it hasn't been picked clean) has a decent amount of typewriters and fans to help you in your endeavor.
---
Love my Grognak. It's my go to weapon. I just wish I could fix it to 200% with perks. Seems to be the only weapon in the game (that I've come across) that I can't overfix to make the durability last longer.
---
Also, don't really on the "search zone" indicated on your map.  When I finally got my last 3, they were up near the main entrance...nowhere near where the map said I should be looking.
---
there is an acid workshop in the top left/toxic valley, Dont recall what else is there.  
---
Only been there once, but I think theres another in the Divide....map picure shows a bunch of spike looking objects?  
---
Idk about you all but I shoot/slice  on sight if its survival. Live or die
---
Other than that wave for you, wave for you, wave for you.
---
Ah okay, so you don't have any actual numbers, thanks for clearing that up
---
It's not quite noob entitlement as it is some random asshole joining the game while lacking any social graces or common sense.   
---
There's just a lot of people like that out there. 
---
Typewriters! I always forget about typewriters. Thank you good sir.
---
Yeah, sounds to me like OP forgot what type of game this is. I was always under the impression it was more of a survival game. Hell, the last Fallout had random raids that you had to try and stop. Not exactly a game where you can build whatever you want without consequence. Maybe Minecraft or NMS might be a better game for that. 
---
I agree with more songs, but am not sold on the radio host.  In FO4, I initially loved Travis.  But after a while him saying the same thing every few minutes really began to get on my nerves.
---
Well you can't blame a company for designing a game that doesn't suit everyone. They do have a target audience in mind and I think his daughter unfortunately is not quite there. The game's scenario is harsh and designed for more mature audiences and the player's interactions are also designed in order to improve that immersive experience. Whether they got it right or not is another subject.  
---
But then again, we could have a full pacifist mode or PVE servers which would allow for a wider audience, and I think that's what anyone in their right minds would do, so sit tight.
---
I know :) it's just nice not having to claim it evertime I log in
---
You're welcome!
---
The whole point of a camp like that is so the odds of being to place it somewhere else are higher.  More stuff touching the ground = more likely you can't place it's blueprint
---
Plays online and thinks of a way to get rid of sociable players visiting their CAMP. Really?  
---
Oh right, we didn't want Fallout to be Online, but it is, and like real life, there are a-holes who enjoy being scum, which online gaming empowers them to be so.  
---
Be the better person, treat others how you want to be treated, not how others choose to treat you because they have sociopathic tendencies.
---
There was a guy who had explored as much of the water as he thought was possible (I think he said visibility was near zero in irradiated waters north of the dam) but I don't think a hatch was on the list of 'sights to see' he found.
---
I also remember someone finding an underwater hatch in FO4, unless that's what you were thinking of? 
---
Charleston newspaper and government buildings are good spots
---
Sugar Grove.
---
Make sure to tag screws for search as well. Lots of junk items have them. 
---
Trust me friend I‚Äôm not blaming Beth on this, I‚Äôm blaming the players. They had nothing to gain from trashing someone else‚Äôs camp aside from maybe the sick satisfaction of doing so.
---
Really? You deleted your other post and then you post this? Are you 10 or are you an incel  that lacks social skills?
---
Move your camp next to a junk extractor resource you will get 4-7 screws a hours not a lot but it adds up fast.
---
I don't see the problem here. That's your stuff and you can do with it whatever the hell you want. You don't owe them anything. If these people get offended by that fact that's entirley their problem. Stop thinking about them and start thinking about yourself.
---
Kids these days&gt;

"ITS MY PARENT'S MONEY AND I WANT IT NOW!"
---
This is what I did on ESO. Crafted trait sets with training and exp perks for low levels. Charged just enough to cover cost and made a tiny profit. You'd be amazed how much money you can earn honestly helping out new players 
---
Sorry that happened to you, but claiming a workshop and having pacifist mode on is and likely will always be a bad idea. You agree to the potential of PvP when you claim the workshop, so leaving pacifist mode on after doing that is setting yourself up to get ganked. 
---
I don't foresee this changing with the upcoming update to pacifist mode to make camps invulnerable either, since that would require Bethesda to come up with a whole different non-PvP way of contesting workshops.
---
The way I see it, you don‚Äôt have a choice right now. It‚Äôs either you accept Fallout 76 as it is, or simply quit playing the game until things get better.
---

does the challenge give you the gun at your respective level or at max level?

Here is a video I made a while back showing all the nodes (that I then knew about) at Hornwright testing Site #2
---
https://youtu.be/wQ81X47xqVY
---
I missed a handful of nodes and mentioned them in a comment on the video
---
And they just want to be loved. 
---
And brandish shotguns.
---
Refuse to trade with them outside of survival mode. That will get more diplomacy out of them :P
---
Did you go into audio settings and change the volume for chat. This was something new added recently. Also, it might take a couple of times of adjustment for it to stick.
---
For being blind, they sure are accurate with those missile launchers though.
---
Pretty sure you have a really shitty bug.
---
Heh screws, giggity
---
Do you know, that you can tag certain components for search. And whenever you encounter item with such component, they will have small magnifying glass next to their name. I marked screws, gears and springs since level 2 and at 69 I sit on 100 bulks of each as well as at least 200 non-bulk. It helps alot.
---
This is reddit, don't hurt people's fee fees.
---
Dude it's a post apocalyptic semi rpg. What do you think people are gonna act like? 
---
Very cool looking, too bad it uses the CAMP budget of 3 items
---
I love seeing players from different platforms offering bodyguard service. ;) There is a great supportive community out there.
---
Personalities more likely to be forgiving/understanding extend that to games they play.   Which is why this Reddit sub is so bizarre
---
Unpopular opinion: you are an idiot for setting up your kid up in that game because you knew it would happen. If you didn‚Äôt know that would happen, then you should have read the 5000000 posts about it happening, so I reiterate the idiot part.
---
I am so sorry to hear about what happened to you and your daughter well building your camp. 
---
I had a similar experience a few weeks ago, not even close to what you and your daughter experienced, in regards to trying to have a bonding moment with your daughter. 
---
I built a record label with 2 different Studios  and  a stage out front, hoping I could share my camp with others and give everyone the opportunity to tune up there skills and hangout and Jam. Boy, was I wrong, 5 guys should up and completely destroyed my camp in the same time line as they did to you, the  thing that hurt the most, was I politely asked them to stop, explaining why I built it for, and the response I got was, shut up,  your loser, then I was attacked and killed.
---
 I found out later they were the same kids that farm Whitesprings. I reported them and contacted Bethesda about it.
---
 Its sad that this kind of mentality is part of game, but I think the best thing to do is try and rebuild explain to your daughter about the raiders and what they do and how mean they can be and try to put it in comparison to a real life situation. 
---
I am here to help you as well, not sure what platform you're are on, I am on Xbox, username Studio10Records. Just send me friend request and I am there with any thing you need, together we will rebuild and put a smile on your daughters face, and show her there are good people playing this game as well. 
---
If you plan on playing a ranged character, pipe revolver and pipe bolt action are your friends. You can boost there damage and range quickly with the low level perk cards of crack shot, rifleman, gunslinger, licenced plumber and gunsmith due to the fact that with a rifle stock they benefit from both rifle and pistol perks.  
---
I was thinking more personal. Something only that person would have available to remove. A generalized stash for all wouldn't be respected by everyone.
---
My man...thank you!
---
Always feel like I'm missing things in Lucky Hole (still end up with mid 200s everytime)
---
The ‚Äúraiders‚Äù thing is so played out. I mean, I think there are legit players that get into role play and act out how they think they should act but simply going around and messing with people and their camps for no good reason is lame.  
---
The vast majority of my experiences have been very positive but I‚Äôve experienced what this person described above.  It was early in the game for me so I accepted a team invite as some tool and his buddies show up and destroy my camp and then proceed to work me over.  That sucked. 
---
As I‚Äôve leveled up (now 150) the griefing type incidents have subsided for me big time but unfortunately it‚Äôs part of the game. It‚Äôs too bad because you just don‚Äôt know if people that approach you will try to gank or not or just act like idiots.  I‚Äôve always got my guard up especially the deathclaw gauntlet in clown suit types.  Welcome to my reactive plates slappy!! 
---
On a final note, I was hopping around the board last night and get to my camp and someone 150+ was just standing there.  That rarely happens as my camp is basically off the grid but they were just passing through and wanted to use my workbenches (totally cool with that).  But I was fully prepared for a gank move just in case they got frisky. 
---
Because the game has these kind of interactions built into the very fabric of it. OP should not have let a special needs child play this game, and the result of his decision, was the unhappiness of his child, and that's on him 100%.
---
I've never understood it either. My best guess is when a person has multiple characters is easier to select which one you want, but it's such a stupid system
---
Genuinely found a camp once where it was entirely built out of nothing but foundations roof and all. Then while I was figuring out how the hell to get in without fast travelling my friend loaded in and ran through the foundation walls before they rendered! xD
---
It's still an online pvp game THAT'S RATED M FOR MATURE, not E for everyone.
---
In game, no Discord.  I'm not against Discord at all, but I think all RP should be in game.  We use TEAM, mostly...generally no one is RPing and we don't need to hear anything extraneous like the occasional OOC player wandering by.
---
That's frustrating.  I can't wait for next patch with vending so our PVE camps get protected
---
&gt; Yes it I was a bad launch. And I hope they learned from it. But to think  that this was a total flop immediately was pretty Naive and short  sighted. 
---
Looking at all the issues (yes, core issues haven't been adressed, as was expected given how fundamental they are) and then think about who released this..
---
Yes, it is a total flop and disaster.
---
If Fo76 was released by Joe Shmoe and called Early Access, that would be a success right now.
---
But it was a full price FINAL title released by Bethesda.
---
And just to be sure, I'm not talking about bugs or server issues, I am talking about design philosophies and tech, the stuff you decide early on in development way before anything else gets done. They'd have to basically go back to the drawing board with the mess that the game is, none of the mechanics are achieving what they have been implemented for except the world and exploration.
---
I am aware that a world to explore is all it takes for some people to call this a success and play the game for 500hrs, but should we really base our view of the state of the game on a tiny minority treating this like a sight-seeing tour?
---
If Fo76 isn't your first survival sandbox game, there's just no way to avoid disappointment. And when you consider that the genre basically has nothing but low budget indie early access titles, without the expertise and money bethesda has, it's incredibly hard to think that this whole situation is an accident.
---
Further demonstrating the irrational fear mongering about needing new characters only in survival was nonsense.  
---
This.  I almost always play alone but I‚Äôm down for some protective services.  PS4 for me. 
---
Ad Victoriam, brother.
---
But not as desperate as everyone was awaiting your comment 
---
Human nature:
---
Oh, a stickied post with everyone‚Äôs suggestions in one place... that‚Äôs really efficient and helpful - I like it!  [Makes New Post] Dear Bethesda, here‚Äôs ==&gt; MY &lt;== suggestion...
---
Even better. I think the trouble is that it‚Äôs mostly (from my experience at least) super high level
---
Players who are griefing which makes revenge almost impossible. 
---
Yeah man, the China thing is terrifying. 
---
You would need to be able to form a faction or outfit, and it would mean you are all locked on one server because you wouldn't want parts of the base disappearing when someone logs off. So probably the server would be determined by the first person to log off and base removed after the last logs off.
---
But I agree this would be very cool, I had an Outfit in Planetside 2 that was big into base building and it was so much fun. Of course in that game your base was gone after each session, although there was also essentially no real cost besides "cordium"
---
IDK, the disconnect launchers always get me first. üòÇ
---
???? How did you do this? Did you start with conduit up to the roof, then removed them? Inquiring minds want to know!
---
You also can't blame players for doing anything if the game allows it in the first place.
---
Honestly, I also don't like toxic players and some of Bethesda's design choices, but it is what it is and there are literally thousands of games which would provide a safer environment for a special girl and her father. Fallout is a game about nuclear war, cruel people, sick societies, slavers, monsters, people dying everywhere...you really, really expect that such a game with online interactions with people from all ages is appropriate for a special person? I mean go ahead, knock yourself out, have a great time. But you can't really complain that she is not having a great time if someone kicks her sand castle on a beach where there's a sign clearly stating "castle kicking allowed"
---
Get over it, it's just a game and loads of people just want to blow stuff up, which is great fun so i don't blame them. That's what you do in these games. If you're kid can't handle it then it's down to you to make a decision on if she should be playing. Jesus christ, the entitlement some people have is insane..
---
Apparently it's pretty damn easy. All it takes is an app or program and they can pull up everyone in a party or a server and get the info they need. Garbage ass people. 
---
Fans, typewritters, hotplates, hubcaps, gittyup buttercup bodies, tongs, salvaged assaultron heads, wendigos, junkpiles, junk pile extractors, also search every container you find and lool out for little boxes of loose screws. Yes the herald is a good place, also fort defiance, sugar grove, the military wing and the entirety of the whitespring bunker. Of course there are other places out there as well.
---
Agreed, its short at 6802'.  Morgantown is 5199'  Realize that both are a mile long.  The scale in game is off.  Not that I don't understand the Designers made some compromises, but where airports (and rivers) are concerned they lose a lot of majesty and feel when they get the Second Life postage stamp treatment.  No wonder all of those airliners were crashing.
---
Okay thanks, either I just missed that or it was bugged. I ran around for almost an hour looking...
---
I currently have 4 vendor characters; Weapons, Armor, Plans/Magazines, &amp; Aid, my prices are very reasonable, for most things like plans &amp; Aid items I base my prices on Supply &amp; Demand, Plans I find a lot of with low demand I sell for around 50% of list price, the very rare with High demand I sometimes sell for double list (more if it has a stupidly low price like some things do).
---
I sell weapons for what I would consider a fair price depending on their perks, I sold a 3\* TSE Lever a few days ago for 4000 caps, because I don't think any weapon in the game is worth much more than that.
---
I sell most Armor for 300-1000 caps depending on Type &amp; Perks, and I do a lot of trading with the High level Armor (Cavalier's &amp; Sentinel's) to get the pieces I want, since I refuse to pay the crazy prices some are wanting, even though I have nearly 150K caps.
---
I am very open to negotiating and taking other stuff in trade besides just caps, so I'm not sure yet how the player vending will work with that aspect of trading. 
---
I gave up coffee for lent, so yeah.  For the three days it took for those headaches to pass, I was exactly like that.
---
I suggested that, and a weekly "Simple Questions" thread back in beta. The mods are just not interested in keeping up with such a thing.
---
Instead of taking it to or griefing other players I usually do things like blow up cars and sentry bots when people aren‚Äôt around.  
---
I just don‚Äôt get the appeal of intentionally targeting or griefing others in PVE mode.  Take it to PVP and grief all you want.  Been there and done that.  It has its moments but I enjoy adventure mode better. 
---
ah thats nothing, yesterday on Fo76Bazaar a guy was asking 60,000 for one gun.
---
60,000!!!!
---
F!
---
So... she's in tears, hitting them in pacifist mode, but is somehow dying and respawning, and losing all your caps?
---
You literally cant be killed by other players if you are in pacifist mode, unless they explode cars or something around you... and you don't lose caps when that happens.
---
You are 100% lying about at least facets of this story, if not the whole thing. I honestly wouldnt be surprised if this whole thing never happened or happened to you and you just made up the daughter angle for internet sympathy points.
---
I was feeling bad for your daughter until you started saying things that made no sense and couldn't possibly have happened. Now you're just fake news click bait.
---
good point!
---
Yeah, ive had them tagged for a while but its like even when i scour every nook and cranny im lucky to leave a building with more than one or two in junk
---
Same. It‚Äôs not beautiful like some, but I set up a couple of viewing areas with seats to relax. I‚Äôm okay with others taking water and crops - I rarely actually need them anymore. I just wish there were a way to leave a ‚Äúwelcome‚Äù note or something so other players know it‚Äôs cool.
---
Unfortunately, songs cost money. I don't think F76 is making quite enough to offset the cost of licensing more songs.
---
Make your way to the 'church' looking area. Face the later and on your left (I think, am going on memory and am high) is a tunnel. head in there and keep an eye on the walls, look for some dense vines, when you see them, walk into them and find a well hidden passage that is littered with lead nodes, about halfway down there is an even more well hidden passage, head down there to find the creepiest place in West Virginia (no lead in this bit, but worth visiting)
---
Because people cannot simply kill each other in Adventure Mode. 
---
EWWW, necro!
---
Anything from top of the world to the east, parts of the ash heap, and everything east is subject to enemy level relative to what other players have been around.
---
M recommendation is:
---
L1-15- forest
---
L15-25, toxic valley 
---
L20-30, western side of the divide, depending on level of players that have been in the area.
---
L25-40 - ash heap
---
40+ eastern side of the map.
---
WS nuke zone, 25+ depending on armor and weapons.
---
Higher intellect
---
I would definitely like to see more players per server, but also remove player markers from the map, because they were only really there so you weren't running around eachother alone all the time. Just make it so people on your friends list show up.
---
There could be other less specific indicators that there are active players at a location so you can avoid over farming areas though.
---
&gt;	I hate to agree, but I cant see any other reason.
---
No? If I run into a griefer, I want to know it‚Äôs the same guy even if they‚Äôre hiding behind a different character. Even if Bethesda implemented a way to show character names, I would want it to be opt-in for other people. 
---
Can honestly say I've never been in any vine covered passages!  stoked now
---
No that's not what I was looking for but ty for searching for me I greatly appreciate it, it was deffo in a fo76 post 
---
I‚Äôm sure Bethesda/Zenimax has enough to cover it, it would be worth it and pay off in the end for them
---
There have been asshats in pvp since the days of text-based pvp MOO, MUSH, MUCK or MUDs on BBS'.
---
( glad to see someone else who woild know the reference!) 
---
Libations all around! can't beat a bit of roofie juice to wash away your wateland sorrows!
---
Raiders just aren‚Äôt known for strong organizational skills.  
---
Can confirm. Wife makes the same gutteral noises in the morning.
---
This is what my group does. We are a pretty tight community so i trust most of the group. I wouldn't do it with just any random person though, for obvious reasons.
---
Fallout is well known for it's tactical gameplay ever since fallout 3.   The only one in the series that wasn't really tactical is fallout tactics.  /S
---
  Rangers Lead The Way
---
I mean a flop financially from their perspective. People were thinking they would abandon the whole thing. But what I see is a solid roadmap and a constantly changing game. I fully expect them to continue to support the game long term. Maybe some may call me na√Øve for that. 
---
As far as your core issues with the game, I‚Äôm not sure what they are. I agree that the perk card system needs some love. And I really hope the game finally goes in the ‚Äúrebuilding America‚Äù direction with the future updates. We certainly seem to be getting hints of that. 
---
It is nonsense - its pretty dumb playing all day long in Survival, but when i need to do something more serious like sell bucked items or do a run with a lot of meds i can just hope servers and be in the Adventure, while every noob who tries to sell his shit in Survival are gonna get blasted and lose it all.
---
We need to have fixed characters in each mode!
---
I applaud your post, there will always be asshats around and unfortunately that is just the way it is. This game like most has the young punks that are internet bullies because in real life they would get their asses handed to them. I cant wait for the patch to be implemented...Sorry this happened to you!
---
Probably because he's lying about it.
---
His daughter is in tears, hitting them in pacifist mode, but is somehow dying and respawning, and losing all his caps?
---
OP is 100% lying about at least facets of this story, if not the whole thing. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if this whole thing never happened or OP just got his base wrecked and just made up the daughter angle for internet sympathy points.
---
I was feeling bad for his daughter until he started saying things that made no sense and couldn't possibly have happened. Seems like fake news click bait.
---
I'm of the mind that pvp shouldn't be a thing in this game, but I'm not buying this story.
---
If you farm technical data and turn it in for the Forbidden Knowledge quest you get tons of stimpacks.
---
Search the desks in the military wing of the enclave then fast travel to Fort Defiance and turn them in.  If you server hops and only take the technical data you can do this 6-8 times a day.  Sometimes more if the rng gods smile on you.
---
It doesn‚Äôt actually reset, the quest marker just updates to your most recent death bag. As long as you remember where you actually died, you can get your stuff back no matter how many times you died.
---
The NukaShine is very similar, sadly is hard to fine more than one person there. 
---
I'm still unclear as to why she didn't just... ya know... Leave the server and block the players... Would have prevented this entire ordeal... 
---
They‚Äôre ducking terrifying. I can honestly say I have not been scared of a creature in a video game as much as them
---
The few times I‚Äôve gone into survival mode it was more about calibrating my defenses and build to see how I stack up.  It was never about how I rise to the top of the leaderboard, although, I did get up there a couple of times and that type of attention wasn‚Äôt fun. 
---
Yep, did that the first 3 times, killed Morris, and found 2 in the wild. No luck
---
When I had to do it solo I bought a bunch of ammo, transferred the ammo solo, and resold said ammo. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Thanks for your support man appreciate it, eh people are entitled to their opinion
---
Or what if I could text people on my Pipboy and call them a tard
---
I'll fully admit I was one of those calling for the requirement of new characters prior to Survival mode's release, but now having played it and created an alt I plan to play in Survival exclusively (about level 27 now) I have no issues with allowing characters switch back and forth for a few different reasons.
---
It's great that Bethesda can use all the info from the OP builds to balance PvP better (Todd Howard mentioned this recently at PAX East).
---
It's nice for those players who don't have enough time to build up a new character.
---
And honestly even in the new Survival mode death isn't very punitive unless you're higher in level (higher caps loss), especially if you plan ahead by regularly storing junk and keeping minimal aid items on you.
---
Necro?
---
one trip trough charleston herald got me 8 you guys are awesome. i can build mods now!
---
You cant be killed while in pacifist mode as of thebostch two weeks ago. Slap damage was set to 0. The OP is obviously lying about his daughter being killed and respawning and dying again, using all his caps.
---
He's probably lying about the entire encounter for internet points. 
---
The next update will extended pvp invulnerability to camps.
---
Well.. yes but I would like something that u dont need to load into, kind like train stations, maybe a little bit bigger with 2 or 3 npc trades. 
---
Sorry for your kid. But you shouldnt play this game, theres enough single/ pve games out there.
---
I sure this is true for some griefers, but ultimately this is about power. Some of these folks may be in life situations or stages where they feel relatively powerless, and this outlet enables them to feel control over something, even if it is just a bit of data. Given there are quite a few younger folks here, it isn't surprizing. 
---
Just that this isnt necessarily them being jerks because that is who they are. There can be other reasons.
---
Why should they have to stop playing the way they want to? Assholes or not, you 100% had the option to leave, block rejoin a new server. It would have taken you all of 2 minutes and your child wouldn't be upset. They might be asshats but theyr're not at fault for making your child upset. That was your doing by A. Letting her play an M rated game in the first place and B. Not stopping it after it started to happen.
---
I think it‚Äôs because some players know they can‚Äôt hang in survival mode so they gravitate back to adventure and act like jerks because there really isn‚Äôt any penalty. 
---
I like the idea of a karma based metric in that if you do senseless things to other players who aren‚Äôt down with the PvP deal you should suffer some consequences.  
---
Some people are quick to jump on the latest hot thing.  They don't care about the game as much as their experience in the first little bit, and have no patience if everything isn't perfect.
---
The issue is, there are people that basically make their living either riding the hype train on a new game, or shitting all over it if that's the popular meme today.  Lots of 'game reporter' blogs and sites, tons of YouTubers, and more than a few streamers are just hoping to get views by taking the lazy approach like that.  The problem is they're the ones with the microphone (or megaphone, in some cases), and they're the only thing the public hears about a new game.
---
Those people only ride the hype, they don't really follow the game, they don't try to help make it better or forgive the initial missteps that a lot of games make.  They're there for the publicity, then they move on to the next thing.
---
People with real experience in gaming, or the hardcore fans of a particular franchise, are generally willing to allow the game to self-correct.  They have the patience to wait until things have really come together, or not, before making broad assertions about the quality of a game.
---
Look at how FO4 was shredded (unfairly for the most part), but now is considered a *really* solid game.  Or a more controversial one, No Man's Sky, which by all accounts had one of the roughest launches in recent memory (and a not totally undeserved one), but is now being held up as one of the most intriguing franchises around.  Sometimes it just takes patience (and a *lot* of patience in some cases, like for NMS) before a games true colors come out.
---
Sorry for the novel, that all has been on my mind a lot recently.
---
Oh thank you but I‚Äôm good, I just thought it was outrageous and funny relative to this.
---
Need more people on a map vs more locations. I can't wait for private servers so I can host an rp server.
---
All of the Responder vendor bots sell crafting stove plans.
---
Whats your PSN buddy?
---
Move your camp and you won't have to pay the repairs, just caps
---
I love you. You are 10000000000% right on everything you said here. Real people play this game.
---
Spacebar is interact by default of both morrowind and oblivion and E is jump, it's the same with their console versions and with skyrim, and fallout r/76 A is interact, and Y is jump
---
upvote for visibility, this seems like a serious bug
---
I actually had a guy stop by my workshop in Survival last night wanting to trade. Fortunately he had a mic so he was able to quickly convey he came in peace, because when he first showed up I immediately started lobbing molotovs at him lol.
---
I've also had a few people be friendly and send team invites instead of immediately killing me as well, so it seems even in Survival mode not everyone is a murderhobo.
---
Why would you do that? Paladin Danse would NOT approve of that kind of name calling and I'm afraid we're going to have to strip you of your rank and PA. 
---
There are so many things I hate about you just from this post but the worst is that you actually believe there is some real moral high ground here. 
---
That's quite objective though, I played survival once for an hour and one guy kept killing the same player over and over for the better part of 10 minutes. It does depend on personal experience. 
---
Depends on the pistol, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs too many that match up to rifle damage, you could get the perk card to boost pistol damage but you could do the same thing with rifles
---
Wow.  It's a video game.  Are people really getting upsey about this?  There are plenty of other games you can play where you can build bases and not worry about it being destroyed.  Yet somehow, it must be this game that you have to play, knowing the entire time that someone can come along and destroy your work.  Not only knowing that but let's be real, you should've expected it.
---
I don't see a victim here as you could have easily played minecraft with the zombies turned off if you're going to get upset about people playing the game in a way they are allowed or encouraged to.  You said so yourself as an experienced gamer, people are assholes online and now your so surprised by this that you wrote a post on reddit?
---
If you can't distinguish real life efforts from efforts in a game and get upset over a game you shouldn't be playing the game.  
---
I played space engineers and made a massive base and someone came along once and destroyed everything.  All my hard work.  I just moved on.  Get a grip please.
---
Bethesda Just needs to add legendary PA with Assassins's/Sentinel PA pieces and explosive plating torso mod (same function as dense for normal armor).
---
Make PA great again!
---
Yeah, imagine getting the phone call from your kids: *"Dad!  Some bullies from school came and completely destroyed our house!"*  (Would be ridiculous, right?)
---
I've also been upset by roving bands of high level douchebags doing similar things - both base destroying and PVP attacks where they exploit flaws in the game that allow them to have excessively OP damage in the *THOUSANDS* - WTAF?!?
---
----------------------------------------------------
---
I agree with OP, with a caveat - the very *point* of a "Video Game" is to be able to do things that you couldn't/wouldn't/shouldn't do in real life.
---
There simply is no valid excuse though, for not having SOME kind of "**no** PVP mode", perhaps with characters that can't play in the regular "Adventure" or "Survival" servers?
---
At the very least, a single player mode where you don't even connect to a server to play.
---
-----------------------------------------------------
---
I have another, seemingly very unpopular opinion  that I think needs to be said in this context: it's really BS that people get all bent out of shape when some of us want sex in these games because I think it's ***really f#@ked up*** that violence is somehow OK but sex is taboo!?!!  
---
"But wait, there's children...". Yeah?  Well the violence is actually LESS appropriate for them than sex, because it's more harmful!
---
Sure, make an age restriction on the servers with adult content, but it's senseless to think violence is less harmful than sex.  Completely senseless.
---
Workshops are still a pvp experience.  You'll be flagged for pvp no matter where you are, so long as you own a shop.
---
With pacifist mode on, they can still deal full damage to you but you can't damage them. 
---
Learned that the hard way when I had thunder mountain generating cores while a friend and I ran silo Charlie. Someone contested it while we were down in the silo, so I shrugged it off and ignored the message. Then they showed up at the silo and one-shot me and my buddy.
---
Fucking Hufflepuffs. 
---
it's what I'm currently rocking. it doesn't hit as hard as some other builds, but it's great if you like using VATS and the Gun Fu perk, especially for mobs.
---
Sometimes you have to ignore the min/Max and just play what feels fun for you :)
---
Paladin Danse is like 160 years from being created 
---
I think the all rise is temporarily great. When you hit level 50 and get the all rise, it‚Äôs probably your best melee at that point. 
---
And it‚Äôs also a great weapon to have for non-melee when you just need to whack something in the face. Again, until you find something that fits that slot better. 
---
Don't care. Still not acceptable.
---
I mean i agree with the fact workshop dynamics need an overhaul however i would not completely remove the pvp element in adventure mode.
---
Instead i think pvp should be isolated to just the work shop area. What i don't like is how someone can contest my workshop to engage me in pvp rven to the far corners of the map.
---
Example: i have a workshop,  you show up to contest it
---
Scenario 1# i don't show up to fight for ownership;  its yours.
---
Scenario 2# i show up; we duke it within the confines of the workshop boundaries until someone wins/gives up.
---
Tard
---
But would a lock or punji board stop this?
---
I leave everything unlocked at my CAMP, I just wish people would SHUT THE DAMN DOOR! when they leave so the mole rats don't chew up my workbenches.
---
I moved my CAMP to a volatile location in the Cranberry Bog a few weeks ago, and have not had a single login where my camp could not be placed since moving, but I do have to make repairs frequently due to Super Mutant's, Scorched, Snallygaster's, Mirelurks (including a Queen), Hermie (The nearby Hermit spawn), and SBs that frequently visit my base.
---
Several friends have said they would move there If I decide to move, but they don't want to interfere with my CAMP and the abundant spawns in area.
---
Why are you here
---
I‚Äôd like to learn 
---
*I know right*! Imagine calling complete strangers that could just be a bunch of kids "the worst/dregs of humanity" for simply playing a game how it's suppose to be played. It's unbelievable to me how stupid that is. Like you have to be utterly naive to share viewpoints i see being discussed in here.
---
Sometimes other enemies do that. It's hilarious when radroaches do it. My headcannon is that they are super early prototype synths. 
---
So it‚Äôs been a while since I played Morrowind or Oblivion but Skyrim and all the Fallouts are space to jump, E to interact by default. 
---
But yeah all their console games the Y/triangle to jump is weird. 
---
It actually doesn't matter if you need to use the Pip Boy, a Terminal or a simple Textbox. There is no such thing as Chat Immersion? The Moment People are able to write they are gonna write whatever they want, even Troll Out of Character Stuff.
---
But still, we need a form of Text Messaging. :x Verbal Communication, specially in Europe is pretty hard and impossible. Gonna Upvote every sub on this Topic so Beth finally sees that xD
---
Well, I'm glad you're so mature and clearly don't understand why that is offensive.
---
I have a very modest camp - with all the benches and a few other cool things-  but invested a lot in the armory and turrets.  If nothing else it looks tough lol.  
---
I don't disagree that their should be a co-op mode, just like we have touch football for people who don't want to get injured, but it doesn't right now. This game is rated M for mature. Having your base destroyed is an issue that you have to be a little more matured to deal with. Maybe a different crafting game like No Man's Sky would work better for her until a proper co-op goes along.
---
To me, it really isn't about bullying, it's just a game that deals with really mature themes, one of those themes is unfair power balances. If you don't want to have this conversation with your daughter yet than maybe this isn't the best game for her.
---
Id also like to make a side note about camp building and the bugs ...just make sure you all know that sometimes when you store items they get scrapped instead and sometimes things are wonky as hell to place (thats just two things i mention in a long list) but i hope it helps to be aware of that in case sometimes it may get frustrating. &lt;3 &lt;3 
---
That would be awesome for pacifist, but I would hope they up the attacks from NPC enemies a little, otherwise camp turrets as useless 
---
If you go there, also use the wooden walkway on the floor above street level (path marked with arrows) to access the next building. There's at least two hot plates in there that give one screw a piece. If you continue on to the capitol building, you can get even more typewriters, fans, and at least one globe. For me anyways, I also hit New Gad as the supermutants there often drop screws, and there are also things like toy trucks around that I think give you two. Makes for a long run, but it's worth it if you're building power armor and crafting/scrapping handmades.
---
I'm not sure how viable it is endgame, as there are no armor piercing perks for pistols and higher level enemies all have lots of armor.
---
It is however a fantastic option for the beginning of the game, cause you can easily get a max modded pipe revolver and run that for 25 lvls or so.
---
I'm personally running a character that starts out as a pistol build, then switches at lvl. 25 to a heavy gun/PA user (because all of the perks I need for that aren't available until post lvl. 25).
---
It's a lot of fun running and gunning with pistols, it just may not be the best date dealer later on.
---
I have seen some that shoot through the windows and kill everything in the club before you can get to them.
---
Yea.... How did I not see this here ALL DAY yesterday... My Discord team told me about it 21 hours after it had been posted to their site. Was on the sub all day yesterday and not a peep.
---
I am going to come off as a complete dick here and I'm honestly not trying to be a dick as just honest. Online gaming is a terrible place to let your special needs child play video games. My best suggestion is find something they will enjoy with out having to deal with people. To expect a happy place gaming on line just will not happen. 
---
Because being mean makes me feel bad
---
are you really blaming the father of the special needs kid who let the kid build a CAMP?   
---
goddamn the internet is full of trash people
---
makes me sad for humanity, or lack thereof
---
Oh man you‚Äôre offended by a word? Sucks being bummy I guess 
---
I don‚Äôt want someone killing me in a game about killing 
---
Shh. How is some one supposed to prank him with it if you let him know in advance? *grin*
---
Real question here - how is the floating base in the picture more functional? Is it just because you can place it anywhere, and thereby save 5-10 minutes when/if you log in and your spot is taken?
---
If all you're going for is bare functionality, it takes not time at all to slap down 4-6 foundations and the basic crafting stations/bed/water supply. 
---
In what terms viable? Pvp? No, not even if they get buffed. Bloodied Rifles etc will always be the Top with much Explosive Stuff and Sneaky Thinks.
---
Just to play the Game and Experience it how you like it? Hell yeah, do what ever you want. Right know i play a Character that only use Knives. Hard, but fun.
---
I don‚Äôt know anything about any of these mutations.  How do you get them?
---
If a wall goes, so does that rad shower. Takes less time to destroy a wall than it does to load in to your base. Not for nothing, but the locks won't do anything but create a challenge for some people
---
Why are you letting your *special needs* child play this to begin with? You are partially to blame for this as well.
---
What?!?  They took it out??  Why?
---
There are a couple of items that should be able to clip through anything and attach no matter what; these little pillars are one of them. It drives me crazy when one stops a foot from the ground and I can't add another. 
---
Yep.
---
Should have done it already.
---
Guess I'll just quote myself again since you didn't read it the first time.
---
&gt; No other game has figured out how to put character name *and not have to handle a large and endless number of offensive name reports.* 
---
The more and more i read this thread of entitled whingers that are apparently unaware FO76 is a multiplayer game, the more these assholes become my heroes.  
---
Thank You.
---
That's the line to your right.
---
‚ÄúCool variation‚Äù it‚Äôs basically fallout 4 online, nothing varied about it, but I agree I enjoy the game too despite all the shit I‚Äôve talked about it 
---
I've definitely enjoyed the deathclaw, my favorite so far. Sometimes he stands in my doorway and blocks me from getting in my house, but he is a really good guard-pet
---
Good advice. I used my shotgun build, has 2 ranks of four leaf clover. 
---
I went to Watoga and wandered around, every other shot was a crit. I had the challenge done in 10 mins
---
Oh shit. It says 50 damage reduction, as in armour. So it's wrong? It's not like Bethesda to make a mistake?!
---
Why in the actual f do Miners have dozens of rocket launchers anyway?
---
I'm not offended by a word. What is offensive is your use of it in describing other people. Your lack of understanding people who are different than you makes me sad for the future of humanity, in the video game and in real life. 
---
I traded with a person this morning and it went perfectly.  Use a mic if you have one!  Make your intentions known. 
---
Later on, someone wanted to trade and when I wouldn‚Äôt agree to their terms (of course they want your best weapon for basically nothing) they got all pissy and started bouncing around and thumbing me down.  I raised my weapon and they disappeared in a hurry. 
---
Actually, extremely relevant, since FO4 lacks the friendly players that gave her most of her joy.
---
But that would require you to stop blaming the OP so you're never going to understand that.
---
I think it‚Äôs random. I‚Äôve had it auto load a full one when I have some that are almost gone. 
---
Give this man a Nobel prize 
---
For lower level players getting thousands of caps is really hard.  Early on in the game getting more than a few hundred caps at a time is neigh impossible because events don‚Äôt pay that much and in many cases become hard to do because a lvl 150+ toon walks by the event boosting enemy levels.  Until you figure out how to make caps and develop a routine 4-5000 caps sounds insane especially when you consider that super awesome 3* legendary weapon at lvl 20 sells to the vendor for tens of caps.
---
For low levels who aren‚Äôt on reddit these prices seem insane because they haven‚Äôt had 5000 caps in total at that point.  
---
During the Overseer‚Äôs quest, I was disappointed to find an Accordion, and realize it was just a junk item. Same thing happened when I found the Violin at the Garrahan Mining HQ... I wish we could play these instruments already modeled and present in the game.
---
I've had my entire stash of cores depleted battling scorch beasts and getting sliced up my laser turrets at a Watoga location. 
---
All I have been able to find until this morning was suits with 25% cores. I finally found one at 80% in a generator. 
---
**Raider** "Rawr! I‚Äôs a Raider! My name is xX_DETH_xx"  
---
**Rational Person** "what? Your name is Steve, you‚Äôre the vault orthodontist... we‚Äôve met. Are you high?"  
---
**Raider** No, I used to be Steve, but I disagree with your methods on a fundamental level, we‚Äôve never gotten a long. You probably don‚Äôt remember as you‚Äôve always been so self absorbed. Me and some of the other guys have a new gang, and we‚Äôre going to eat you now"  
---
**Rational Person** *gets eaten*
---
Was he selling a silo or property as well?  Lol 
---
Haha I‚Äôm not the one who thinks of mentally handicapped people when I hear or say the word tard
---
You replied to a post I made 3 months ago. :P
---
Why not just let her play Fallout 4 instead? If she enjoys the building system it‚Äôs there as well and less limiting. 
---
Advanced connectors: "am i joke to you?"
---
i have a 2 block base camp. olso lost a lot of cap try to move my camp. just payed 160 caps to put it in my original spot again becous this is a peace of shit.
---
No, they should enable "coop non-PVP" mode and/or Private Servers.
---
I like (mostly) how Adventure Mode is setup - just some weapon/perk combos are seriously OP to the point that they are "game breaking" when exploited.
---
Mostly melee, previously (and still somewhat) TSE shotguns/Gatling guns.
---
When I was at either Watoga or the R&amp;G Station, when looking at their Junk Items one of them had Bulk Circuitry, it could be in an upcoming update for more bulk type items.
---
I don't see a need for any type of resource sharing, since you can simply drop or trade stuff to friends now, but I would like to see Camp boundaries with a small overlap, and the ability to share Power.
---
I think it would be great if we could build a compound with friends.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it loads the lowest first, but I haven‚Äôt paid attention to it, or haven‚Äôt noticed since I currently don‚Äôt have any fusion cores lower than 100% 
---
Hey friend!  Just popping on with a quick tip that for some reason I don't see anyone else posting.
---
Blueprint your camp!  I typically don't because it just goes into Stored tab when moved, but if you're concerned it will be destroyed blueprint it - it's a way of "saving" your design.
---
You will still need the junk to build everything again, but once you do it's ready to go.
---
Hey if you were blind and your people were farmed for shotgun shells and black titanium, you'd want something you could just sort of shoot in the general direction of any sound too.  At least they don't have TSEs.  
---
If you would rather join a multiplayer game that has semi-open PvP where you know this can happen to you, and get mad when it does happen to you; than play with a very similar building system in a completely safe environment, then your entitlement knows no bounds. Accept the risk, or don't play. 
---
You're acting like I'm electing to blame the op no matter what point is made. Consider that this is actually how I see this issue.
---
That‚Äôs why my house has two floors.  The first floor is open to everyone, has the crafting stations, and is ugly but functional.  The second floor has my STASH and looks much nicer but is behind locked doors. 
---
This is the fucking point of the game dude. Have her play Minecraft on peaceful mode or something or y‚Äôknow literally any single player game if you don‚Äôt want people online to PLAY THE GAME
---
Did you know that the rating system isn't legally binding?  It's meant to be an indicator for parents to decide for their children.
---
Also, if you actually bothered to understand the OP, you'd find it wasn't "They shouldn't be able to do this", instead it's "Remember there's a human behind the character and you're being an asshole."
---
But I'm guessing that understanding this might induce a bit of self-reflection on your part, so you're not going to try to understand it.
---
Depends on the level of the power armor pieces !
---
You don‚Äôt 
---
I found the note for it but it's static and can't be interacted with for some reason. It's in the Camp Grounds on the edge of the lake one a picnic table next to a cooler.
---
Lol I wish I was those people
---
This is the only example of me going after other players or their camps in PVE.  I always fire a warning shot or ask them to close it down.  I don‚Äôt care about rhe bounty.  It‚Äôs weak and lazy behavior.  If you want to farm ghouls do it like the rest of us and actually duke it out.  There‚Äôs more than enough to go around. But hogging the ghouls for yourself especially when you aren‚Äôt present is lame.  
---
Simple solution: Add some songs from Fallout 4, like End of the World, Uranium Fever or Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall. They already have the licenses for those, so why not?

I seem to be able to make a few pieces of flux after every trip into a blast zone. Generally I don't have enough glowing or hardened mass, and a lot of the flux I harvest doesn't get used. 23 flux to recharge a fision core seems like a lot, or were you joking?
---
So, once again you fail at reading comprehension.
---
The OP is not "this should not be allowed".  It's "Remember there's a human behind the character".  In fact, he *explicitly said so*.
---
Yet somehow you really, really want to avoid understanding that.  Golly, I wonder why.
---
same here. after 1 week my ticket still says "waiting on agent". i really hope its not this case, but i read in several boards that bethesda kind of likes to ignore support tickets and its customers..
---
That's the same glitch as the "defend your workshop from scorchbeast" glitch.
---
Doesn't necessarily mean anything.
---
Yea text glitch, has been happening often since the update last week to everyone
---
I've never found one in an ammo box, and I have the scrounger perk. 
---
I wanted to find a deathclaw spawn lol
---
Complaining that people aren't 'nice' in your video game is crazy to me.. everyone plays differently, and there's no wrong way to play.
---
If OP's daughter wants to play a non-violent building game, download Minecraft, lol.
---
FUCK THIS GAME I WILL NEVER PLAY IT
---
Yes. But I attributed it to getting attacked by a lot of scorched beasts. 
---
Time to level my alt!  Starting over at level 1 has been such a grind, even with gear handed down from my main.  
---
Can you link something on this? I will be doing this when I get home!
---
I‚Äôve run into this a few times. Ends up just being scorched or another mob type. I am stoked for it when it is finally put in the game. 
---
Sure there is but since if you have to remove the wall for some reason you have to pick up the connector as well, i think may be cool to have an "integrated connector" option so you can save time to put down both again knowing the various issues to do so.
---
&gt; Grenades are easy to shake off.
---
Multiple MIRV grenades though? I went straight for max rank demo expert on my Survival alt and have had pretty good success with MIRV grenades. 
---
Except when I teamed with someone who shared the "fire in the hole" perk card. The throwing arc is great but the "grenades fly x% further" aspect really messed with my ability to not have them bounce off into space.
---
I didn't know that!  Thanks.
---
Without laws, government, police, ETC, some people will be like ***"I do what I want, because I can, because my gun is bigger than yours"***.
---
I like the idea of a Virtual World where I could just go ahead and do the *bad things* that I might sometimes wish I could IRL, *but don't*, because I either don't want to hurt people, or don't want the consequences, or both - like eating a big chocolate cake, or, having sex with lots of pretty women, etc.
---
Yes of course! :)
---
But who were the adults that raised them that way? Who's the responsible party giving out the awards?
---
Better yet I have lured a scorchbeast or two that way.   If you set up a turret camp behind the golf club you are asking for trouble. 
---
My husband and a friend were playing the other night and encountered one of these 'treasures'.  Both of them were just minding their own business doing some quests and suddenly a player 3 times their levels starts following them around, taking pot shots.  Follows them to one of their nearby bases and just proceeds to wreck the place.
---
Makes me wonder why Bethesda hasn't made slap damage apply to player constructs.
---
And to people who argue "Let them play how they want!" well... it's not equitable.
---
When a level 150 player starts harassing a level 20 there is no 'win' for the level 20.  If they stand there and do nothing that player can demolish their base, which can be pretty harmful at that stage in the game where resources are in short supply.  If they attempt to defend themselves they will most certainly die and then lose whatever junk was on their person.  And of course the other player can \*still\* destroy their base.
---
Lower-level players are basically just chum in the water to these higher level PVPers who aren't willing to dip their toes into Survival mode and discover there are bigger, nastier sharks.
---
Tip: Don't play solo
---
Wait for PVE or buy her Minecraft
---
Isn't the cap 25k?
---
Bold of you to assume I'm not like that \*after\* my coffee, too.
---
Yes sir.
---
unless you want to pvp. They're useless there
---
level up. hunt and kill them. this is how you deal with griefers. the Chicago way
---
They remind me of the cranky old guy at work that gets better after coffee but continue to be cranky and talks under their breath just enough to not be understandable enough.
---
Or as my work mates say, me.  \*rabble rabble\*
---
Then you are in the minority. Historically, that word was used to describe handicapped persons, regardless of whether it was a mental or physical handicap. To have it bandied about as an insult is unacceptable. While it may not make you think of handicapped persons, most people hear it and immediately think that it's a derogatory term to describe handicapped persons. There are a lot of words we don't use to describe other people because they are inflammatory. The word you used is one of them.
---
Omg I almost spit my coffee out. Thank you sir/madam.
---
‚ÄúAcktually‚Äù 
---
I remember that post.  The consensus was he could not prove his claim.  
---
Oh ok that would make it a lot easier lol thx
---
been wondering this too. I hopped on my high level toon to finish last week's just in case for this reason
---
Oh thx that helpsüëç
---
Two ways.  Taking rads (Usually a large amount in a short time) will get you a random mutation (there are 19).  Or, if you take a mutation serum, it will give you that specific mutation.  
---
It loads the lowest percentage first. It used to be random but they changed the load order a couple patches ago
---
This may be enough to convince me to level another character. I haven‚Äôt been able to do it otherwise. The quests and events have no real replay value for me, and with no way to quickly grind outside of white springs (even post nerf), it‚Äôs just too much for what amounts to nothing more than different perk cards.
---
Time to stock up on xp bobbles.
---
Or how about just have the structure be the conduit like in FO4 Vault DLC? The technology exists. 
---
Do you charge an extra 30 cents for all that cheese?
---
I dont usually accept team invites unless I know the people from reddit or on my friends list. I mean, if I see a level 1 - 25 person wandering about I'll usually be nice and give them some stuff. But usually I'll not accept trade invites if they offer. 
---
People should be able to destroy bases in Adventure Mode, but, most of the material should be reusable and they should not  possibly survive when you hit them with a mini nuke in revenge.
---
There should absolutely, positively, be zero chance of survival when hit point blank by a mini nuke.  ***ZERO!!!!!!***
---
I can't hit a flying scorchbeast with a machine gun without VATS. 
---
I can, but VATS helps a lot if they're flying. 
---
Yeah, for *that* I think they can just put a Chinese AR skin on the Atom Shop. But for something that's essentially a totally different firearm, I'd rather it be a new gun added to the game. 
---
This is a sad read, you have a right to not play with them? No, you don't. It is part of the game's design. Get over it. Incessantly complaining us going to turn this game rotten. 
---
The game was not advertised as a PVP game. It was advertised as a multiplayer game. If you want to be an asshole, Survival is up.
---
It's not like his kid was running around killing zombies and doing drugs, they were building a camp. What is your point?
---
Ah gotcha
---
Explain the fucking difference, you smug idiot. He's saying "remember there's a human behind the character, so don't screw up their hard work, despite the fact that it's a part of the game." 
---
The cute phrasing doesn't make a difference, it's still just a bitchy "sum1 was mean and i didnt like" post. You guys just cannot accept the risk and just bitch, moan, whine, and complain. Absolute children. Go play a safe game if you're too immature to handle being attacked. 
---
I understand his point perfectly fine. It's just a childish, entitled point. 
---
I fucked up the first time, because I used cards in incorrect order (2,1 instead of 1,2), but second time wasn't a problem. If you have one-tme code and fast travel to cabin make sure none is near, as he can steal keys if you open secret door and be too slow to grab them.
---
This is my chance to flex, I don't drink coffee.
---
Mole Miners must be protected!
---
Mole Miners did nothing wrong!
---
I really hope vending machines don't share your stash weight...
---
Most of the people I play games with (that aren't RL friends) are people I met on 76. Great community, I even enjoy my interactions with "raiders." They just ne3d love too
---
Awesome Job! I hope you had fun at PAX East! 
---
Get rid of the pistol, get yourself a rifle and get the anti armor perk (perception).  Maybe throw on a perforating magazine too.
---
I've absolutely never accepted a trade invite from a stranger.  If it's in my inventory it's there for a reason.  Last night someone kept hounding me to trade at whitesprings.  He finally started slapping me.  I let him slap me several times to make sure he wanted PvP, then finally I graciously accepted his 110 cap donation.  
---
Become god 
---
It's almost as if different people play for different reasons.
---
Can confirm this worked for me too. Tried the chameleon idea first but that didn‚Äôt work.
---
Farming for caps takes time, no question about it.  
---
I usually run with an inventory of 8-10K caps but I‚Äôve purchased several items 4-5K.  Marsupial serum. Reactive plates.  Stealth boy and jet pack plans for my PA.  The good stuff costs a lot of caps. 
---
Imagine making a post crying about raiding in a PVP survival game. Lmao.
---
Do I dare try our survival? When you die do you drop anything?
---
It's a core mechanic of the game. It's the same thing with Rust, you could spend countless hours building a base but if someone with more materials comes along they can just tear it down. If she's going to be devastated by this which is extremely common, you need to have her play something else.
---
And yet, in Monster Hunter World, the names of my character are seen by everyone. I wonder why Capcom can do it.
---
I can run through the mine east of Whitespring, the one with the uranium extractor event, and come out with 300 steel in about 10 minutes. Now, I have no idea if that‚Äôs a lot by comparison to other places, but figured I‚Äôd chime in. Cheers. 
---
I just had it load a full one last night instead of a low one I had just grabbed off a chassis. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
It's the game, my dude. Sorry it happened but it will happen again so... 
---
But if you feel the need to emotionally harm others to feel good or because it‚Äôs a virtual world with no consequences shows some bigger problem , people still have to remember at the other end are real people not virtual npcs . Seems Bethesda has recognized this and will be fixing some problems in next patch so you have choices on your play styles.
---
Nice, crippling her with limb damage might keep her in place even after the event is over. In my case she was still flying around and doing the dabs so probably her limbs were ok. I usually fire at the head as much as possible. Yes some people say if you lure her out too far from blast zone, she might even teleport back when she‚Äôs killed so there‚Äôs no carcass to loot. Sounds like a huge bug right there. 
---
I don't know why they don't group levelled players together in server. I know the servers are location based but come onnnnnn
---
i just deleted the game. it aint funny anymore. just spend 600 caps trying to find a fucking spot. rediculous. 
---
Do you know of any copper mines? Also thank you!
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGVBzoS\_Q1U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGVBzoS_Q1U)
---
I just uninstalled. Seems to work wonders for my mental health &amp; the fact they ruined my favorite franchise. 
---
I started a new character.  Low level equals negligible caps loss. 
---
That‚Äôs how I like to drink my alcohol. By the carful.
---
Yeah he wouldn't prove where exactly the location was nor would he provide screenshots of what he found in there so everyone who posted in that reddit post said it was a hoax and he was trolling.
---
Starting to wish I'd posted something on it so I could find it again lol nevermind 
---
The father let the kid with special needs play without supervision, alone in a mature game that enable and promote griefing that resulted with kid in tears, well yes, i do blame father for allowing it to happen.
---
flechette harpoon guns (usually) let you collect more ammo on corpses than you use, enemies can have up to 8 harpoons on their corpse and regular enemies usually die in 3 shots max
---
i'm not sure if they're worth using for non-heavy weapon builds for anything else though, i only used them with a complementary build
---
Sorry you're getting downvotes - you're not wrong, though you're less right than you think.
---
You only notice the hackers in PvP because you die (or someone does).  They are still there in PvE, they just have less of an impact to the everyday player.  Definitely more of them in PvP, but it's not a huge margin.
---
Why isn't it fixed?  The game was developed by Bethesda Austin, which is a formerly small development group (Battlecry Studios).  They had no experience in the Fallout universe before FO76, and (from what I've read) are rather understaffed for AAA online game development.  They're a bit overworked and out of their element, so there are going to continue to be some growing pains until they get things fully under control.  Plus, fixing something like 'all PvP interactions' is a rather daunting task for *anyone*, more so for a small group with little experience.  Hell, Blizzard still has those issues with PvP, and they've got all the resources in the world to combat it.
---
&gt;  the fact they ruined my favorite franchise.
---
Get the fuck outta here with that. Nothing is ruined.
---
My survival experience thus far has been; if I‚Äôm not being spawn camped, it‚Äôs because someone else is. I also suck at pvp, so I appreciate other targets. 
---
I‚Äôm always interested in trading plans. Add me, same psn as my username. 
---
Opp's it did it again! 
---
Honestly,with pistols it seems the best bet is to also go into a vats build.  I‚Äôm currently going for an alien blaster build (because I can), and the best I‚Äôve come up for is a 15 agi/13 luck build around that notion. Sneak attacks, headshots, vats crits, seem to do the trick.
---
I know, I miss stuff all the time and I reddit all the time at work unless you are my boss then I am busy doing my reports.
---
No worries! I read so many they almost blur together after a while :)
---
Hmm can't decide whether to level up my main or alt... maybe main Saturday, alt Sunday. Experience farming time! Make sure your characters get the "well rested " effect or cook up some cranberries. Def taking advantage of this, this weekend. Good hunting 
---
all you junk and a bit of you aid. Drop it in your stash and you're safe
---
But if you teach a vault dweller how to make one..
---
i wondered about this too, but i guess he wants you to have alternate characters also filled up with $$$ to give him, 
---
since we can have 5 characters, each with the 25k limit, that means we COULD have 125,000 caps
---
here is the psot: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76bazaar/comments/b8zr11/ps4_w_bloodied_firerate_less_vats_cost_handmade_h/
---
Yes! The pipe revolver benefits from both rifleman and pistol perks depending on the weapon build. My non legendary level 30/35 pipe revolver does 100+ damage, compared to my western revolver which does 98. Pistols use minimal VATS, and are fairly light. I bring a combat shotgun or Gatling gun as super backup if there ate mobs, but I can take down a lvl50 super mutant in 4 shots for the most part.
---
I agree. But I think X-01 shouldn't be on any Scorch just because it is a prototype in this game. But it should also be a rare occurrence that has an increased chance to encounter them at a higher level. And an increased chance in Nuked Zones. 
---
How do you transfer ammo solo?
---
Conspiracy: Sheepsquatch is helping the bloodbugs take back the land from the dwellers
---
We are not at a high end raiding system so for now you can rock any build and no one would say anything about it. When wastelanders release we may see a different story though 
---
Kids these days -argument goes back to ancient Greece... :-)
---
All Rise is solid in general, and the weight reduction is nice. I always go Grognaks with an affix if possible. My ghoul slayers axe + glowing ones perk is fantastic in nuked WS. 
---
Character names are for your reference only to keep track of multiple characters if you have them. Plus character naming has zero protections against immature players who want offensive, demeaning, derogatory or otherwise inappropriate names (gamertags do for the most part). 
---
Also note, if you transfer to an external back to your internal X drive you will still lose the photos.
---
Maybe. Honestly, I don't think anyone has ever thrown one at me. Can you even tell the difference? Are there more than one screen indicator?
---
Hey man very sorry to hear that happened.  I have three kids myself, and I know how much joy it gives my youngest (8 year old boy) when he builds something in F76 or Minecraft which in turn brings joy to me.  We had a similar thing happen, I usually play with my 8 yr old just because he doesn't fully understand Fallout and how it works (it is a VERY different game than the usual 8-12 year old games which are simply get gun, shoot, repeat).  Fallout 76 is quite difficult to grasp at first as it may be hard to see how wrench, oil cans, rags, loose screws laying around equal weapon, armor and base components.  Also the aspect of eating and drinking (and food decomposition) is also outside the norm of the Fortnite world.  
---
He has done a great job of grasping this and gathering components, watching your carry weight, eating and drinking to avoid penalties, not blasting through your ammunition (this one probably caused the most initial grief), using melee weapons when possible, etc.  We have absolutely run into some situations where some higher level player (which is almost everyone since he is level 11) just railroad him and take all his loot.  He came crying to me just this last weekend (I was helping his sister) with tears in his eyes saying "some JERK just killed me and took all my stuff!!!"
---
The sad thing is we had a microphone on and I know they could hear how young my kid was and they just didnt care.  Didnt have the guts to say anything back, just killed and moved on (they were wanted at the time).  My kid had just walked into the Gauley Mine and there happened to be a wanted guy there.  My son said Hi and he wouldnt shoot but the guy didnt care.  Complete asshat.   
---
If you play on PS4 hit me up- ping me and I will IM you my handle (not the same as my Reddit account)
---
you have one of those grinch hearts before it grew 4 sizes too big, yours must be a shriveled crusty heart to feel the way you do about a special needs kid
---
thanks for outing yourself as this kind of person, ill block you now
---
"special needs"
---
I notice that if I use iron sights, I don't do nearly as much damage as I do in VATS while sneaking. I'm rocking a lvl30/35 pipe revolver too, and usually just use VATS on armor. Don't know if it's a glitch or how the game rolls damage.
---
Yeah I made an alt for that reason.  There isn't much advantage to being over level 60.  My new guy is 42 now, vats crit bullshit build :P I found a bloodied increase vats hit chance the dragon that inspired me to make it.  As well as a few furious rifles I'd like to try out.  If I can fill my vats meter up quickly with this furious, faster fire rate combat rifle maybe it will be better.  Dunno :P
---
If you want to run with pistols, you will want to carry a 10mm with an armor piercing magazine alongside your revolver. Big difference. Wander up to Philippi and grab a couple black powder pistols, too, and keep them both loaded always. Also carry a bat or axe for when you get in trouble. And grenades. It's not a very powerful approach but it is fun. I did it for almost 100 levels.  
---
That is fair. Because you wouldn't want to share all your junk. But maybe they add a new storage item that you could put junk in to share amongst your faction. 
---
lol its supposed to be an MMO, but everyone wants it to be single player
---
That's weird, they were supposed to have fixed that. Sounds like another bug lol
---
Agreed. If a snare drum made it through the bombs, surely violins have. Especially in an state that‚Äôs known for its fiddle music. 
---
There are a few mods that up the star count. Someone else on here mentioned the machete mod. Changes the entire look and turns even a basic machete into a legendary. 
---
I use two of the small conduit connectors on the floor, one each side of the wall. You have to do it before you place the wall though. 
---
Literally the first gameplay we ever saw from FO76 is PVP. And Todd Howard talked a lot about how fun the PVP is. It was advertised.
---
I think they changed the look the light version. They looked like steel plates with spikes that looked good with metal chest pieces. I don't like how the armor pieces get overly bulky looking. 
---
Camp Vending was announced on the [FO76 Roadmap](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019)
---
Hopefully Bethesda is working on it. 
---
Thanks for this. Lead is always my bottleneck.
---
I just read a thread about "evil griefers" and a special needs child that was interrupted while building a camp by these "ruthless scumbags" that destroy the game. The child was traumatized but somehow it wasn't the caretakers fault instead the whole Thread pointed their fingers at Bethesda ( because they are entitled to play the game like they want) and this "human trash" players. I wanted to point out that Fallout 76 is rated M but I also don't wanted to be downvoted into oblivion so... ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
You played survival?
---
Rose? Her voice isn‚Äôt very ‚Äúmusical‚Äù, I wouldn‚Äôt want to hear her sing. 
---
There are no ‚Äòraiders‚Äô, it‚Äôs just a pathetic excuse for some low-life to act out their violence fantasy so they can feel like a man for a few sec. They won‚Äôt go to pvp servers, too dumb and slow for that. All they can do is staying in PvE and keep doing their stupid routines. 
---
Yeah I think it was all blown out of proportion.  Like as it is now, everything you're risking can be banked, caps can be transferred but even if you're a new character and die right away you won't drop much.  Yet you can make the same amount of money as a level 300+ guy every day if you just YouTube cap stash routes.  You'll have like 4k in two days but will only drop 20 caps per death lol
---
This is so good! Really incredible weathering detail to top it off.
---
Your downvoted and really shouldn't be.
---
Would I be sad if I found out I wrecked a small disabled girls base afterwards?  Probably.  
---
That said, the only person who is at fault here is the parent that let their small disabled daughter play an M-rated game where its widely known that people do shit like this.  It's like letting your kid play in a pen of rabid hyenas and being mad that the hyenas bit her.

Don‚Äôt transfer anything solo unless you are ok with the chance that you CAN lose all of it. Find a container, write down peoples names that are on the world (I usually look for people with workshops because they are less likely to leave), put your items in the container, log out, switch characters, find the person on social and hope they are still in the world you were in, join their game, and loot said container. 
---
Amen.

Straight guess.

up to 4 at Camden park:

When I completed the Camden park quest, was awarded one.

   Ammo box at the booth thats behind you when you are facing the game with all the tires.  One in the generator, and 
---
the 4th in the PA suit inside the roller coaster.
---
AJ&gt;loose on a table/cabinet
---
If you go to a PA spawn point, even if there is no PA there, (and sometime when there is), check the cabinets/shelves in the area.  There's usually a core close by.   
---
Posiedon, there is usually one laying on the table next to the core processor, along with a random plan.

Maybe there should be a toggle option that shows the regions in colours. Green have 1-5 players in that region with red being a region with a lot of players in it. 
---
His entire OP is blaming other players, for playing in a medium that is totally allowed, for not following rules that he made up and ruining his daughters day.
---
His daughter should not have been playing this game. 
---
In my eperience, Ash Heap has lots of mole miners, which are difficult at lower levels.
---
Also ran across an L30 sentrybot last time through there - Melee killed it - bonus: dropped a fusion core :)
---
Lewiston depends on other players, as does the Excavator quest.
---
For both of those, first few times I tried (in the mid20's) , I got swarms of L48 mutants....and died a lot.
---
When I went back to lewiston and the mining HQ (in the mid 30's), server was relatively empty, and I got (mostly) L1-10 scorched.
---
low level enemies=low XP, but pennies add up :)
---
Once you get into the low - mid 30s, levels will come faster, as you will be better prepared for higher level enemies, which means more XP, wich means faster leveling.
---
Thanks for the tips on how to get lots of materials for ammo quickly. My offer is still up for those that use a lot of .45s or fusion cells, but might have a lot of 5.56 rounds just cluttering their stash box. Caps are welcome as well if you hust want the ammo without doing the work yourself, lol ;)
---
‚Äú...If the player had a mic, I could explain my confusion...‚Äù

Even if he doesn‚Äôt have a mic you can still talk to him, and he can hear you (if you have yourself set for ‚Äúarea) and respond with an emote signifying ‚Äúyeah‚Äù or ‚Äúnay‚Äù...
---
no
---
Not necessarily. The licenses likely were for use in that specific game. Which means they'd need to pay again for them.
---
1) How were they to know your daughter built it?
---
2) it's a game.
---
3) it's a PvP game
---
4) Minecraft is on Game Pass.

I‚Äôm starting my new character this weekend and leveling it in survival with that xp boost. She‚Äôll have no caps and the bare minimum aid. I just want to go somewhere secluded and grind levels. Let‚Äôs see if my plan works haha. 
---
It looks amazing! Good job!
---
No dude, the cheese is always free!  ;'-)
---
&gt; child wants to play
---
well to be fair its a rated M game, if your kid wants to play, tell them no and play an age appropriate game with them. as a kid I wasn't allowed in the same room as my older brother when he was playing God of War, and i turned out fine. the rating system exists for a reason.
---
not every game is made for every audience and this game was clearly labeled as a survival, pvp focused, game. and a poor one at that if people are just destroying bases for fun. at least in Rust or Ark you can steal supplies so there is value in raiding someone.
---
its not about your "cred as a gamer" its about you playing a game that clearly doesn't appeal to you and demanding that game change to fit your needs. just play a different game, there are a dozen new games coming out every week, its not hard.
---
The vending description text that was datamined seems to confirm this.
---
I'd you build the big vertical one you can attach horizontal ones to it, then remove the vertical one. 
---
Tell me about it. The hardcore pvp people are dumping all their caps. There‚Äôs gotta be a penalty for that. I took down a level 220 and got nothing. 
---
And bitter
---
Explosive laser?????
---
Also,  I never said I was on the side of the light. 
---
How about for more flexibility to where on the wall the conduit is, have a conduit that you can place thats just a double conduit, so one on this side on the wall and its mirror on the opposite side
---
And they are ugly as fuck

100% agree, drives me nuts. They should not be allowed to respawn in the area if they die without caps. Or if Bethesda really wants to crack down, they could just kick no cappers from the server. Had a guy with zero caps hunt my buddy and I down for over an hour desperately trying to kill us. Massive waste of ammo. 
---
Stay away from high populated areas. I run around on my level 40 out in the mire/bog and rarely encounter anyone. Built my house out past the abandoned waste dump and use that as a travel point to stay in the more remote areas. If I see myself climbing the leader boards I'll jump off something to my death to clear the map ping from myself. Hope this helps a bit

I don‚Äôt know how it works on your system but on my Xbox you can just click someone‚Äôs name and send them a message.

Just killed my 1st about an hour ago. It was beautiful chaos. I'm on xbox one. I didn't feel any lag.. 
---
I too like to appear randomly and destroy loud uranium collects 
---
I've seen a group that does this stuff several times on different servers. Did one of them talk in a fake high pitched voice?
---
It's unfortunate but it's also part of the game until the patch comes where pacifist mode affects buildings. As soon as those people started destroying things you should've left the server immediately. You can still fix the CAMP, it's a temporary setback. This game is significantly more lax than other survival games.
---
I've seen this issue be brought up before, and it is a valid complaint. 
---
I have not seen a proposed solution that I, personally, think is healthy.
---
Do you have a possible solution in mind? Even if it is just the start of an idea and not fully thought out?
---
The atom shop basically gives you the plans to make them yourself.
---
Yes, totals 4x damage
---
This is why Bethesda has lost their original fan base. Those of us lived and breathed their immersive single player experiences. 
---
If Bethesda wants to cater to the easily addicted online griefer community, then the rest of us just need to what I did with all my outdated Bethesda games: uninstall and move on.
---
Lotsa heads exploding 
---
I am happy they are making a hunting style gameplay for end game. I thinks hunts would be essential to the games survival. They just need to keep building upon it. 
---
Yeah there is nothing in the game that captures the size of the Ohio, and really there are not enough bridges either. But hey, I love it when I hear friends who have never been to WV talk about wanting to go because of the game
---
Nice, the only thing I really use conduits for decoratively is to make a "shower" head for over the bath tubs
---
Do it for funsies. Not because of how great it is.
---
IIrc there -is- a damage reduction when you hit zero caps. It just doesnt really affect multi-k dmg builds given their sheer output, and thats almost certainly the kind of build these people are using. Not that im condeming that inof itself, I'm perfectly happy to be taken down in a second, cause im gonna bring somone else down in a second too. Usually. Unfortunately, the right combination of assasins/sentinels/cavaliers etc, means the same kind of PVPer that generally runs a massive damage build is also immune to anything but massive damage, so the stupidly high damage builds are really the only option to actually kill those people. Well, that or a gamma gun. 
---
It can be pretty awesome.  I ran an unarmed build with an instigating DC on one character.  Base damage of around 348 x 3 for ninja x 2 for instigating,  it was essentially 1 punch man. 
---
Oh completely, AI trading prices are complete horseshit because they just add an extra 20 or so caps per legendary effect regardless of what it is. Not really Bethesda's fault as you can't accurately ascertain a legendary's worth automatically but people who listen to the in game value clearly haven't played the game enough.
---
Me and u/Ampersanders were VIP Guests to the Bethesda Game Days event and we had a blast.
---
Barbed Walking Cane mods for errybody
---
Interesting method thanks.  Not sure I would be brave enough to try it though.
---
 My buddy gave last week‚Äôs to our friend who uses grenade launchers and had no issue, so unless they changed it in Tuesday‚Äôs patch, it‚Äôs fine :)
---
Some people suck . Just server hop . 
---
Thank you so much! Weathering is my favorite part of prop making.
---
At your level, the main difference is gear, not level. If you think it's about level, then a twinked out L30 will probably still be instakilling you when you're L300.  
---
There's little difference between a L40 character levelled for PVP, a L60 who didn't have to change much respecing, a L100 who had a pile of perk points to use up specing for PVP and a L500 who has all the perks and 100s of points spare to move SPECIALs.   
---
Once you have the pertinent perks, all that matters is gear and the knowledge of how to maximise your damage.   
---
If you're only continuing with this mode for the unique rewards (as am I), then you shouldn't lose much. Avoid combat. If you get killed, leave your junk, close the game, load into adventure and fast travel to somewhere that isn't a station fast travel gankfest. This week's challenge was easy enough - I went somewhere out of the way, and pottered around until I got it done. Never saw a single person. Last one was more difficult as legendaries are harder to find, so I died a half dozen times or so, lost a few thousand caps, but never more than one death per person. Whatever the next one turns out to be, I'll similarly avoid well populated areas and quit out of the game rather than being farmed. I don't pretend to have the gear for PVP or have a clue what the current meta would be even if I did.
---
I'm not anywhere near camp limit yet, but i intend to sell low myself because i have no room in my stash. I started a new character and got to 1500+ steel so fast and I don't have much to do with it.
---
Legacy items that no longer drop. As for op, the beam splitter turns it into a shotgun and explosive shotguns are really good.
---
That could work. Honestly I wish they would open up a pay service where we could fund the royalties on tracks played in the game to open up a ton more music.
---
Even better would be to make more 50s style music that was more topically fallout. Like rock music made right before the bombs fell and not 150 years ago.
---
I tried that but just got repeatedly killed in the areas surrounding the vault, made no progress, had no fun :(
---
Same. My new character is level 18 now, and is killed constantly by everyone/everything, but has next to nothing to lose, so no stress üòé 
---
yeah 2 shot explosive
---
And how would this effect low levels trying to play survival eh? Step out of the vault, get blown up, get a penalty. Sounds really fair. 
---
I made something similar in one of my first camps:
---
https://m.imgur.com/Zs7lD90
---
It‚Äôs actually very light.
---
Material is PVC pipe, Sonotube, and EVA foam. The only metal on there are cans and screws.
---
because its a pvp game?
---
Bingo. This game is not about skill or logic, it‚Äôs for dummies who can‚Äôt aim and bought the duped magic armors. 
---
Very nice how much
---
How do you get serums? Craft them? You need plans to craft serums?
---
There are a few things to try:
---
* Start with the pylon and end with the generator. This works for me more often than going the other direction.
---
* Move the pylon closer to the generator, connect it, and then move it back to where you want it. Works occasionally, but you may not get the placement you originally wanted.
---
* Keep adding pylons until you get a connection. This is a waste of budget but it usually ends up working.
---
Honestly don't care. Maybe it rather teaches something to those kids, because when I was kid and got killed in MU online or Dark Eden by other players with OP gear, I didn't see it as "It is unfair", but rather opportunity to beat the challenge. Never did I felt like I was being bullied. Well I guess, back then children were less fragile and understood how to deal with these kind of situations and this whole "cyber bulling" didn't exist, because back then children knew how to close computers.
---
Your child is not mature enough for this game.  It's a sad fact, but please keep in mind, not every product is meant for every person, and the ESRB rating clearly states this game as "M", and online interactions are never rated in order to absolve them from liability.
---
It is unfortunate that this product is not for your child, but please keep in mind, the type of people that like smashing other peoples things need catered to as well, and this game does this for them.
---
These people are not being assholes, they are playing the game they bought with their money, they are not cheating, they are not breaking the game or any rules, they are operating wholly within the world that has been created for them.  If you cannot respect that this is a game for people that want to do this, then maybe you need to rethink what games are before letting your child play them.
---
I want a Tesla Powerwall and solar. I'm trying to save the ^((radiated, destroyed)) environment.
---
Yeah and speaking of immersion, nothing breaks immersion like someone yelling random shit into their mic. At least you can mostly tune out text. 
---
Nobody in their right mind would sell a good legendary for the suggested price, because in the almost 500 hours of play so far, I have never had a TSE weapon drop for me, so 500+ hours is required for 1 of them, if I sold it for the 120 caps the game suggests, why would I do that, when I could go and pick some corn in 5 minutes and get the same number of caps
---
My lvl 54 is now at a point where i saut√© people, its all about the equip and tactics
---
If you have the right gear at lvl 35 you can be scary af too
---
Since the whole base stands on only a single foundation block, you can place your camp about anywhere you happen to found yourself from. Also melee mobs need to find their way to the top of the stairs and in that time well placed platforms with turrets have killed them already. Also these turrets have 360 degree view. At least my turrets have, because they are placed under my base, but still off the ground.
---
The existing penatly only affects damage against players. they just need to buff it from 50% to 99.9% or something. that'll stop it.
---
Hacks. üòõ
---
how are their actions not at fault ? everything they did caused this to happen. and this happens to people that play this game, child or adult. 
---
a child building at camp has very minimal contact with M rated content in this game so he's not being a bad parent for supervising his child in an activity that can be beneficial for a multitude of things. 
---
so what you're saying is, a person rolls up and wrecks my camp so am I only half to blame since I'm an adult? or fully to blame for being upset that this happened when I can just block and server hop. nah...
---
they are griefing. they get no incentive for bashing a camp. and it happens so fast you can't log out in time sometimes. the only time they get caps if is somehow they bait pacifist players into attacking back and put a bounty up. and that's low.  and having to log out and hop worlds to hope you don't come back go ruin is really shitty game mechanics. it's not fun to be the only one punished for being bullied.
---
so bethesda has made it OK for them to bully players. it's poorly designed and sadly I doubt survival will change that. hopefully they make player camps immune in adventure for that reason alone. bullies don't want PvP. they want a target to bully.
---
Like all of the current "Survival " games, FO76 is built to cater to griefers. Its because that subset of gamer is a pathetic, easily addicted loser whose only joy is making other people miserable. Preferably while showing off their virtual swag.
---
These addicts need their daily masochism fix. And they'll spend money to look unique while getting it. So gaming caters to these psychopaths by selling them people like us to take out their fantasies on.
---
I quit on anything Bethesda/Gamebryo. And I dont do multiplayer games. It's better to just uninstall and move on, than to be the product for these asshole simulators. 
---
Tbf they did ruin the lore
---
If you truly knew me, you would know I don‚Äôt mess with hacks. Just a gamer girl who plays by the rules 
---
Instigating hunting rifle. At day 145 x 5 with sneak and at night 145 times seven in my case. Silenced with sandman of course.
---
That is the point.
---
This is part of the game, what were you expecting?
---
This. 100% this. 
---
Anonymity brings out the worst in people... maybe because many people are truly shitheads. 
---
"t's just a game, bruh".. well, we've seen how the people who use that term feel when the tables are turned on them (Where'd muh stimpaks go, fix this shit).
---
I'm with OP 100%... give me a full Co-op mode, with a "duel" system like ESO has. Absolutely no PvP unless both participants are 100% willing, and consent to it. 
---
The fact someone pulled this shit in adventure mode, AFTER Bethesda gave us a Survival mode, simply proves that some people are assholes. 
---
Sorry, man. That sucks. People can be shitty sometimes.
---
This is not fair or the responsibility of the people that raided you. It is your responsibility to not put yourself in that situation and likewise the developer's responsibility if that's what people like you want. But there are plenty of games that offer an alternative for that.
---
What is your point with "remember there are people on the other side of the screen?" To be courteous or something? Should I be courteous in a first person shooter? No of course not. If I expect to not be killed or raided then I would play a game where that isn't possible.
---
I mean,  this is the problem when you make a game mode where the incentive is to take stuff from other people. I'm taking about actual stuff they've worked for. 
---
Now,  i don't play survival and I probably never will but you're right.  There should be an in game penalty. 
---
However,  let's look at this from a psychological stand point on just how much Bethesda didn't think this through. 
---
No one wants to lose their stuff. 
---
In real life,  if I was going to go to Fight Club and the stipulation if I lost was I hand over all Cash on my person, I would deposit all my cash into the bank or something.  No penalty for losing other than pride, right? 
---
It sucks but the game gives me the ability to do that. Give caps to a friend.  Not carry aid items.  Etc...
---
People are going to do whatever they can to lose as little as possible. That's just human nature. 
---
Bethesda should have seen this coming but here we are.
---
Hell no.  Adventure is where this happened.  If I was in survival it would be expected.  Some of it was misunderstanding on my part, I thought the patch to make camps immune already happened.  
---
Sounds like Bethesdas usual ineptitude 
---
What lore did they ruin.
---
Are the lowbies initiating the trade, or are you?
---
I commend your efforts to help out lowbies, and wondered if your willingness to help them gives the lowbies  the impression your services AND GEAR are available for purchase?
---
Or...
---
Is your assistance service to lowbies a way to comfortably initiate a low pressure trade?
---
Just curious.
---
Oh boy, please report back when you find that even more secret passage. 
---
That event drops them?  I will have to finally try it 
---
Because all the assholes took themselves out of the agme when it was announced at E3 as some sort of protest that it wasn't tailor made to their own personal preferences, then proceeded to attack the game as much as they could, which in turn, drives out the people who were on the fence about it and only leaves people who would genuinely enjoy the game playing it
---
You can buy the serums from the Enclave for around 4K caps each, or you can craft them if you have the recipe.  You can buy the recipes from the Enclave for around 19K caps, or if you are lucky, they sometimes drop from killing the Queen.  
---
Alternatively, you can try to find a player to craft them for you for much, much cheaper.  I can make 7 of the serums and I charge 200 caps per serum (I'm on PS4).
---
I'm not talking about killing yourself with it. I'm am saying that when I lock on to a target with VATS and watch my nuke hit the target.......it doesn't do any damage. Hit detection in VATS is glitched.
---
It seems nobody commenting here has attempted to test VATS.......oh well I'll have a larger sample size once everyone gets theirs and start bitching about it.
---
Haven't managed to find anywhere secluded unfortunately, might just be my luck - I'm not interested in the PvP, rather just the current challenges so I'm not doing a PvP build.
---
Been hunted down in pretty much every corner of the map thus far, so I'm out of ideas really 
---
Most MMOs allow for you to opt in or out of PVP.  Its not forced down your throat for exactly this reason.
---
Yes!! From what I‚Äôve read online messenger and uranium drop those. I think even guided meditation does but I‚Äôm not sure. 
---
I took a level 20 into survival and did just fine, got up to like level 40 or so without any issues.
---
Maybe it's just that I spawned in kind of randomly in the middle of nowhere since that's where I logged out in Adventure Mode, and just avoided main areas like Vault 76 and Whitespring.
---
I'm planning on starting a new character tonight for the double XP. Probably going to just create them in Adventure mode, get some distance away from the vault. Then log out and switch to Survival. 
---
For all the complaining people did about being able to switch modes, it's the perfect solution to this problem. If you can't get away from the vault on ANY Survival server, switch modes and do it, then switch back. Easy peasy.
---
Apparently playing a PvP game as intended is called being a raider now
---
This has happened before to other players. What level were you? Was this on PC?
---
Lol.... yes. That‚Äôs perfect!
---
Holy shit that's a perfect analogy and so true.  Have an upvote. 
---
You took one of the most contested zones on the map and got mad that a player that should easily be ably to kill you repeatedly did so?
---
Maybe, you were too underpowered to be holding the ammo factory, Icarus.
---
I‚Äôm level 85 on xbox1
---
Supermutants, ghouls, nature, fev, cryptoids etc i could go on
---
Still like to play the game though but the story and everything around it feels shoehorned and halfassed
---
Keep in mind its 20years after the war
---
Catering to griefing bullies will do that.
---
Ill be on in 45 can do it for the mats and free.
---
PC doesn‚Äôt have anything like that. Since there‚Äôs no equivalent to XBL/PSN, and there‚Äôs not a chat built into the Bethesda.net client, you‚Äôre basically voice only. 
---
Yeah Thats what I assumed too, so maybe 1 item for sale at any given time since my stash is perpetually full
---
Take heart, griefers will cease to exist in the future!  They're asshat nature will be neutralized and they will have to find greener pastures to shit on!
---
This is not a good request. I've discussed this with my friend and when people see a loophole for abuse, it will be abused. Scorchbeast Queen sent flying out of bounds, 3 star legendaries flown away from Whitespring, farming for junk as your enemy is batted a mile away...you think you want this, but you don't.
---
Thanks for the input everyone! Now I just got to decide if I want my first alternate character to be a pistol guy or knife guy.
---
I'm using a pistol vats build aswell. Mind showing ur build?
---
I'm pretty sure I've made the mole miner death yargh stubbing my toe in the dark pre-coffee...
---
Well I'm not looking for them either. Maybe it's the subs we're on? Where do you go?
---
savage divide is the only region that drops all of its rare jumpsuits at the same time, i got them at uranium fever once as well after farming that event dozens if not hundreds of times with my friends. the BoS jumpsuit is the only one i‚Äôve been wearing ever since i got it, it just looks so good imo
---
You hit the nail on the head.
---
I have had plenty of success leveling an alt the past week in Survival mode. But I barely go to train stations, and if I do, they're kind of the odd ones out around the map, not the major ones in Watoga, Whitespring, etc. 
---
I don't particularly care for PVP so I just look for ways to avoid the high traffic areas. The map is huge so like you said, it's pretty easy to just switch modes, and get clean across the map so even if you rejoin the same server you're not going to be repeatedly ganked.
---
A healthier response that writing an essay, that's for sure.
---
I can rattle off a half-dozen or so games whose publishers like to go on and on about "player driven/created/crafted/insert-synonym-for-'made'-here stories". I've played many of those, and yet have never experienced any such story. The best I could say in that regards is that they are good games for player hijinks.
---
But FO76... This is the only game in which I've actually seen, with my own eyes, players taking on roles other than "the biggest damn hero on this lil planet" and actively contributing to the crafting of stories worth sharing. There's only one other game where there's a player-controlled boss, loads of player-controlled vendors and where it's easy to find players trying to role-play and help each other out, and I play that one around my dining room table with polyhedral dice. 
---
\^(And the player controlled vendors all have \_atrocious\_ Scottish accents. Seriously Dave; give it a rest man.)
---
Sorry, but no.
---
Which platform are you on
---
Hahaha! Ahhh, now I made somebody mad. FO has always had different modes for players to choose from. That's all we're saying. Have a good day.
---
Gt: Mcvdm98, will add you next time I'm on. Don't normally do teams but its fun once in a while.
---
what platform? If its PC, I want to join this amazing group of wastelanders!
---
Just make sure you have a stack of spoiled meat for that guy that one shots you next time
---
Although I sympathise to some degree. I'd rather see the design of the game move towards players being able to react effectively and allow actual gameplay to emerge from these scenarios. The fact that players are free to exhibit this toxic behaviour makes the positive interactions one has with another player more meaningful. And there's so much potential for emergent gameplay if players are given the right tools and mechanics to inflict their own justice and create in-game consequences for other players actions. I would also highlight that the game has a mature rating and Id argue that it is important, not because it is overly violent or has drug/alcohol gameplay but because of the social interactions between real people and the capacity to process and handle extremely negative interactions--like in this situation--is pretty imperative.
---
I stand by a player's right to be a sadistic bad guy who's impulse is to take joy from the destruction of others hard work or source of joy, at least in a game set in a universe that justifies it. But let us properly form factions and let the politics of this play out in game. Trade agreements or peace treaties could have been jeopardised by these players actions or at the very least they could have been blacklisted by player factions whose members have been given shoot to kill orders. The fact that so many players are reacting on reddit to this shows that the community is there to create such emergent content. It is being held back by very limited multiplayer design and proposed fixes like "make this indestructible" or "block this mechanic in this mode to deter such behaviour" just further fragments the community and drives this game further away from its potential towards a set of shallow, drab, independent experiences.
---
let me whack you with it and see if it hurts.
---
I'm 52 (age and level), and have no idea how to do that lol..
---
If the make a PVE only mode, they lose the easily addicted griefer demographic, desperate for their daily fix of inflicted misery. These people want to look cool while inflicting suffering on others, so they spend money on swag.
---
Which is why the griefing exists and is endorsed. Because good people arent the audience. They're the product. They are there to be griefed and made miserable so the pathetic addicts keep coming back.
---
In Survival games, good, reasonable people are the NPCs from Westworld. You arent the player, you're the Product.
---
Pistol builds can be really strong paired with a heavy VATS build.
---
And I‚Äôve only done it whenever it spawns in my world, I‚Äôve never hopped servers for that. I Only  hope for technical data. The bos is so slick looking. I‚Äôm on the hunt for Camo now
---
The child cried because of the game, they lack the mental maturity to play it, regardless of "adult supervision".
---
Solution id offer be...thise with zero caps or negative cant hurt ya, and you cant hurt them..win win for both sides
---
If a random player opens trade with me I just close it. I tell them over area chat that nothing that I have on my character is for sale - that's all stuff that I use. If they want to see my inventory, I direct them to my extensive for trade list, which has like 70 weapons / armor with reasonable prices (800-2K for 1 star bloodied, two shots, etc. on commonly used weapons).
---
I'd only ever trade the stuff I use for similar weapons. And really most of it just isn't for sale. No, I won't take 100,000 caps for my bloody + explosive + VATS crit harpoon gun. I found it myself, it's never been duped, and as far as I'm concerned it's priceless. I won't take 10 common BE dupes for it, no thanks.
---
Please find a game that allows co-op modes only or build protection for your kid. This is not the game for her. Those "raiders" did nothing wrong except make the game challenging or interesting. You DO have the right to not play with them. Either buy a single player game, or join an MMO who's platform and rules you agree with. "Immature and self centered audience" but you are asking them to change the way the game is made just to let your family have fun at the possible expense of all the other people on the platform YOU AGREED TO PLAY ON.
---
One of my characters takes stuff from  mid-to-high-level-owned extractors, if they aren't locked. If there's even a "lvl 0" lock on it... I leave it alone. That's the extent of it for me.
---
When goaded into PvP by some mosquito... when I've finally hit back... I wait by their stuff so they can retrieve it.
---
Base building is part of character, and a game like this, *to me* is built on people playing characters. That shit takes a LOT of work. Why the hell would I want to ruin someone else's fun?
---
Because griefers are easily addicted gamers who spend money to look unique while inflicting their misery.
---
You arent the target audience. You're part of the product sold to the target audience. 
---
Thye're just playing the game. It's not their fault. They're doing what they enjoy. Like it or not... I'm not saying you should grief people, but this is an online game about surviving an apocolypse. How on Earth can you not expect there to be assholes out there... It doesn't happen often ( Never once to me in 300+ hours.) If it did, then I would server hop, block, and move on. It's not that big of a deal. No need to get all upset over something that you can prevent fairly easily. It's just like all that BS "Online bullying on social media" shit. Um... No one made you get a facebook. No one's making you log in. The only person subjecting you to be bullied is you. You know the risks when you log in. You didn't have to play the game. You don't have to read those nasty messages the bullies send you online. It was your choice to subject yourself to the content. 
---
Agree with all of the above points. And I would add that you should start a melee build and a ranged build and level both to about 7-10. This will give you a good starting idea about which play style feels better for you.
---
In addition to what everyone else has said, there's very little reason to KOS.  GTA is great and has a lot of features for co-op play, but the game is pretty much tailored to being a dick to everyone you meet.  The mental state warnings they implemented forever ago were all but useless if someone really had it in for you or just wanted to kill other players.  On the other hand you have Rust, you kill a guy and get everything he had on his body.  I guarantee you if you could loot the weapons and armor from other players in this game it would devolve into a paranoid murder fest pretty quickly.  At best now, if you kill another player you get some caps and their junk.  You might get a good haul, you might not, but you're not going to get their two shot instigating gauss rifle, and you certainly can't follow him to his camp and raid his stash.  
---
In addition to that, with limited stash space, everyone has extra stuff that they can't sell and don't want to drop so next best thing is to give it to someone who might need it.
---
I found all three of them on the enclave vendor. Someone had vendored them (thanks!). Since they were all together I'd believe that they can/do all drop at the same time.
---
How do you sell ammo to get back to Caps?
---
Go to your camp and press Y (or triangle or the pc equivalent) to repair all. What's the big deal?
---
I take the munitions factory a lot in this game, I usually build enough to get the ammo machine working. People take it from me all the time. I fight back, but sometimes I am outmatched and then people take it personally and then hunt and bully me. After that I either server hop or call it a day. 
---
I'm sorry to hear that it upset your kid, I truly am, I have a young one and understand that no parent wants to see their kid upset. If that is an issue for you or your kiddo then maybe look into fallout 4 for building settlements. I don't say this to be facetious, you could just control the environment easier with mods.
---
Also, my kid loves to build things too in games, have you tried introducing them to either The Sims, or Minecraft? My kid loves both of those games.
---
It's amazing that this is such an intellectual hurdle in this sub.  This child lacks the maturity to play this game, regardless of how much supervision is in place.
---
slightly unrelated but I can't for the life of me understand why so many textures/objects clip through other objects.  Its so irritating when you lay down flooring and yet the wild weeds/grass pops through. small gripe but drives me bonkers
---
Yeah and block them.  Funny, weeding all of them out has made this reddit a lot more fun to read.
---
 "Why won't anyone think of the children?!"  is totally not what i was intended in my post, it's not mine or fo76's community responsibility for mental health and well being of children who playing this game, it is fully on their parents shoulders.
---
 I'm not blaming the victim - the kid, I'm blaming the parents for intentionally putting their kids in this situation and then venting and blaming the community of the mature game and the developers of said game for the results of their actions.
---
Don't those people need to be on you Friends list in order to have the "Join" option available?
---
good point though...another option be a marker over new players heads or something...or off limits pvp in forest/lvl cap to do it...I don't see why a complete newbie with no gear would wanna hop in all out pvp anyway honestly.
---
As a shop owner in Appalachia, I would have to disagree. I like the build limits for a shop/camp all in one. It‚Äôs enough room for a large store interior, plenty of shelves to show off wares, space for all workbenches separate from the main trading space, and even living space for resting. Just need to be clever in setting everything up. Here‚Äôs just a snippet of my current shop, [Hog Heaven](https://youtu.be/V2axR9SqfFM)
---
Jug builds some pretty cool stuff. He's also the main source a lot of camp build tricks people use.
---
How are you still being spawn camped?
---
What do you mean? Find another player that wants to buy ammo. 
---
Nope
---
It‚Äôs built into the game. Get over it.
---
Yeah, if you find one before I do, I'd buy one. Been farming for two days.
---
Have Camp set up by a kind of out of the way,  not so number 1, farming spot.   Will gladly hop in for 40% xp!
---
I am sure they are coming to the cash shop upon DLC releases and patches, but for free. I don‚Äôt see that happening. 
---
Why not keep that shit to the survival mode? or... is it that players like this don't like the fact they themselves might lose their time investment and collected stuff to someone else?
---
Nah, don't excuse this shit. It's pure Napoleon Syndrome.
---
I should clarify I‚Äôve not touched fo76 since then. Went back to adventure and realized other than playing through the same limited content on a ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù character, there was nothing to do. Hoping the double xp is motivating enough to try a new character again. Cheers!
---
I got the Adrenal Reaction serum as a drop from the SBQueen. I felt very lucky that day 
---
No one has ever loved you.
---
There just shouldn‚Äôt be a penalty to those who lose. Just double reward for the winner. 
---
I wonder if you'll be able to build a shop stall at a workshop?  In that case, you could just take a workshop with lots of build space, blueprint a shop there and just set up there when you have stuff to sell.
---
Face it, in a wasteland full of hostiles, no sane person would carry every penny of their currency on them. They doesn't even make any sense at all.   
---
It doesnt cater to them. You had many options. Move your camp, stop seeking revenge, switch servers. Plus, it's incredibly easy to repair. You made this worth complaining about yourself. 
---
Does the beam splitter make the game treat it as a shotgun for perks purposes? I‚Äôve wondered about that. If mods can change the classification of weapons. 
---
&gt;they‚Äôre full of existential rage
---
Wait...that's supposed to go away after coffee?
---
Not being a dick is better reaction.
---
well just a bit of advice, for the data go to the military wing in whitespring bunker and go through all of the desks on the left when coming through the door, you‚Äôre almost guaranteed to get some there. i once found up to 5 there, just fast traveled between camp venture and the bunker turning it in every time i got one
---
*laughs in muffled grunting*
---
And yet, I never claimed it was impossible.  Just not as easy as using account name.
---
It prevents you from getting or losing mutations, and it's in the luck tree.  Radaway and even radiation arches have a base chance to cure mutations, so if you got a mutation you like, or bought one you like, you certainly don't want to lose thousands of caps just because you wanted to clear up some rads. 
---
You totally look like you want to speak to the manager there ;-)
---
If on ps4, send me a private message with thier gamer tags. I have alot of orbital strike beacons I need a use for.
---
Why on earth would a special needs kid play fallout 76
---
Should just be as simple as opt in to pvp, leave it off by default 
---
I believe you are right. I checked myself too. Really hoping the ‚Äúdecorate your CAMP with Stash items‚Äù doesn‚Äôt count toward the Stash limit.
---
I will make more trubble because you might have a door there
---
Locks establish pax *physical access &amp; boundaries 
---
IF Someone decides to pick any lock, in someone else‚Äôs camp, or government supply drops that should be considered griefing. And every defensive incamp  resource should be made to fully trash them.
---
Same for AI.
---
You'll never get though to these guys. There's two types of people in the world...
---
1) those who think "I CAN do it, so that's justification"
---
2) everyone else.
---
When they get older, they'll be hiding behind lawyers, and using "My lawyer got me off" as proof they did nothing wrong.
---
Workshops are great but you should know that taking a workshop exposes you to potential PVP regardless of whether you are playing with pacifist enabled or not. And you can be attacked even if you are not at the workshop that you have taken. The mechanic is not well-explained.
---
At low levels it is usually best to capture a workshop, do the defense mission, and then leave the server. You will get the XP you need and the mission rewards. At low levels you usually don't need a reliable stream of raw materials (which is really the only reason to hold on to a workshop for a longer time).
---
I think I was there! Was the mutation serum guy dressed up like the Silver Shroud? I got a Chameleon mutation off him for like 100 caps. Couldn't hear any chatting though. :/
---
Nice.  My first was Masrupial, so I too felt like it was a jackpot win.
---
Pretty cool! Good to see people innovating with some of the existing assets.
---
All Rise is good but depends on your build, if you‚Äôre running a bloodied build that +10 health can really mess with you. I don‚Äôt have a bloodied super sledge or grognak but have a bloodied fire axe that is pretty sweet and does twice as much damage as All Rise.
---
Retconning lore is not ruining lore.
---
Same! I started a new character just for survival. Looking forward to the double XP!
---
Vague, incorrect personal attacks instead of focusing on the discussion? You seem pretty fucking stupid. 
---
That's truly awful and I'm sorry that happened. Unfortunately their are griefers/bad people on every game you play online. 
---
For example, my main is PUBG. I couldn't count the number of times I've been team killed for various reasons if no reason at all. It's infuriating and I wish people had the willpower to not do such things, but we can't do anything about it other than brush it off and move on. 
---
Again, sorry this happened I could only imagine.
---
It was pretty easy to avoid spawn camping, just spawn somewhere else, but it just sucked to have to give up on an area just because jerks were camping
---
And since Bethesda has the capacity to create alternate game modes, we can both have what we want.  You can go to survival and have your emergent gameplay, and I can go to adventure and putter around in my garden.  What pisses the people in this thread off is that they fear that most people will play in the more coop mode and they will lose their ability to grief and be stuck instead with people prepared to fight back.  Bullies never like level ground.
---
Ok *hacker*...
---
Congrats though you lucky duck
---
Its not worth it....ive had a few....just for fun and to try it out. The cool factor is there, but its gonna get killed sooner or later
---
I will be successful momentarily for you.
---
&gt; Why do you want to be a dick to other people?" Yes, you can and the game allows you to do so, but why do you want to? To destroy something that another human being has made; to cause them grief or stress or upset them?
---
Because it causes grown adults to write essays on why their special needs child should be allowed to play an M rated title.
---
Seriously, if I can run up and smash something in a few minutes and it causes this type of response, this is not a deterrent.
---
Yes, people are letting their inner assholes out in this game.  It's probably why they bought it in the first place, or, because of a lack of content, have resorted to it out of boredom.  And they are wholly within their rights to do so, in fact, far more correct than the adult letting their special needs CHILD to play a M rated title.
---
maybe they got tired of enemies spawning inside the CAMP so they used this to safeguard the house?
---
it really seems like a good idea to me
---
Because they don't hear "no" irl, so why would they in game?
---
Feel free to add me, always looking to play together. 
---
That and drills and syringers, that‚Äôs all I got from hours of play yesterday. 
---
This seems very fishy 
---
Do it. I was putting it off as well because I am very dedicated to my main. I bit the bullet and started a fresh character on a survival server. It is definitely a different experience. So far pretty positive sessions on survival. Not everyone is shooting on sight anymore. Give it a go!
---
Two thoughts on the ‚ÄúI wanna play as a murderhobo‚Äù line of thought:
---
1. From an RP standpoint, that‚Äôd never happen - people would aren‚Äôt be banded together in a survival situation and these type would have been knocked off long ago by the community.
---
But since we have non-permeance and server hoping, this type of play is incentivized.
---
2. Should PvP interaction be level capped? For example, you can only engage with players who are +/- 10% of your current level?
---
Because the other thing that wouldn‚Äôt happen are other survivors who are triple the average person‚Äôs skill and lethality.
---
"if you wouldn't do it on the same room don't do it anonymously"
---
The thing is, this type of thing does happen in the same room. My friends and I do pvp against each other all the time, and even when we do Coop there's always a chance someone decides to go rogue and grief shit, all while we're in the same room. Some people grow up like this, and assume people online have the same ideals for a good multiplayer experience, even if they don't. Personally,  I only grief if I know the person won't really care, but I know more than a few people who just assume they don't care, because after all "it's just a game"
---
This is why your story is weird to me, it's already (mostly) like that. As of last patch, slap damage is 0. So if other people were attacking you (without you attacking back) there is no way for them to kill you. If you had pacifist on (which you said you did), then even if you attacked back, they still can't hurt you. Yes, they can destroy the base (which will be changed in a future patch), but you said you were getting killed and losing caps, which means either you were attacking back and *not* in pacifist, or you had some workshops that were being contested, which wouldn't seem to be the case, since you just said you are ok with that mechanic, because you can choose to leave workshops alone.
---
Not saying I agree with people destroying camps willy nilly, that's a pretty asshole thing to do, but you are protected from being harmed, unless you choose to participate in pvp. And as for the camp, as others have said you can log and switch servers to get away from griefers, and if your camp is wrecked, pay caps to move it, then move it back to where it was. Even if you have to rebuild everything, it doesn't take any material to do it, just the cap cost to move it and move it back.
---
Like your entitlement to ruin my gameplay for example?  I never asked these guys to leave the game, I just asked Bethesda for a mode where I dont have to participate, and asked them to think about the fact we are not just content for them.  
---
I guess that's why I like using that term so much... also an old guy who started gaming around that time ;)
---
In my experience the pets seem to cap at level 20ish so I don't think they make good defenders. They do however make very good "pets". Just keep them indoors so people wandering around don't kill it accidentally. They'll pretty much patrol the C.A.M.P. object.
---
They did nothing wrong.  You are the one that needs teaching here.  You broke the rules, not them, or, you expected them to play by a set of rules that they were not aware of, nor, had agreed to.
---
You need to call yourself out, not the people playing the game as they are entitled to do.
---
You can randomly get mutations by having high amounts of radiation exposure or you can buy serums from a certain faction vendor or players. Serums are cheap now from other players so I prefer to buy them and only get what I want.
---
Starched Genes will keep the mutation, you need both levels.
---
Class Freak will lessen the negative effects of the mutations. All mutations have a negative impact.
---
I'l repeat what I've said before...
---
If they have no caps, the game should take their gear, starting with the most valuable, and convert it to caps to be given to the victor. This includes gear worn and used, as well as stashed items.  
---
Cap value should be calculated based on robot vendor prices, with no perks or charisma bonuses applied.
---
If the player doesn't have enough gear to pay the cost... their *account* runs a tab. and all junk, gear picked up is instantly converted to caps and given to the players to whom a debt is owed, until such time as the debt is fully paid.
---
so this house is better than the one floating how...?
---
just because you dont like the look of the floating one?
---
Couldn't it just be old stock?
---
I suspect she switched pacifist off.  Said that elsewhere.  I also said I didnt really care about that.  There is no scenario where rolling up on a peaceful settlement and blowing it to shit is not a crappy thing to do. 
---
Yup. Didn't know until seeing this post.
---
Oh come on...that was the perfect time to use the line, "The last thing they never see" ;).
---
If you need a hand just yell, with the right resources you can easily do 30 levels a day on a newb toon. 
---
Have you ever found a magazine? Every random magazine can also spawn as a magazine with a free holotape game on it. There are a couple of games that are found in specific terminals in the game world, but most are from random magazine spawn points
---
Must mean her daughter is a real PoS for having her base destroyed.
---
# PLEASE DO THIS. 
---
Every day it's "hey bethesda, you know what ***I*** would like in this game???" posts and I simply don't care, mainly because I have seen it 50+ times on here already. One place to dump suggestions, one place for the lurking devs and community support to look, it's just all around a good idea.
---
The Zenimax Overlords have spoken: Learn the Language of the Masters or go back to the abyss you abject sub-human creatures! 
---
I strongly disagree.
---
I went in for the first time with about ~1kc on my level 81 character, and lost all of it within the hour to a few groups of campers with TSE weapons.
---
Tried changing servers, tried different approaches and weapons, even got the drop on several of them more than once, it didn‚Äôt matter. Before long I was dead broke and out of aid items, and barely able to retaliate against the server leaders.
---
I‚Äôd get the occasional kill, but inevitably I‚Äôd be jumped by some Bloodied TSE Chameleon on a rooftop near whatever train station I spawned at.
---
Even tried running away during my invincible window - that got me caught in a tussle with a freshly spawned feral horde, which bought the train station camper enough time to catch up and TSE me.
---
Didn‚Äôt even know there was a 0 cap debuff at the time, but I‚Äôm sure it didn‚Äôt help.
---
I won‚Äôt be playing survival solo again until they sweep out all the duped weapons from the entire game, or make it fresh-characters only:
---
they are  rng loot wherever magazines spawn. so just search this reddit for magazine spawn locations, its been discussed before.
---
I used the floating foundation trick only because the spot I love gets attacked by molerats and dogs all the time. With the floating foundation, they no longer attack my base. I‚Äôm only floating a little above ground (water actually) so it is barely noticeable and, since my entrance doesn‚Äôt have a door, you just jump into my camp (no marsupial needed). I leave everything unlocked and, so far after 500+ hours, only one player attacked my base.
---
I still have one problem. If I plant any food, the molerats and dogs attack them. So I live off of dog food.
---
"Gen-U-wiiiine articles, right here!!" 
---
it really is.  Fortunately it wont be necessary long.  Fact is as the game is currently built I could have had a squad there and the camp would still have been leveled. These guys are just that fast.  
---
That's the idea! Was thinking pocketed leather armor and weapons with high damage/recoil suppressing components. 
---
Where's my Mouth Harp.  I know its in the game and I know where to find 2 or 3 of them.  But you CAN'T BUILD ONE IN CAMP!!!!
---
I found this in The Division 2 as well. The normalized dark zone vs the occupied (non normalized) dark zone. Surprising what happens when the bullies can get bullied harder, they seem to stay away.  Bethesda should implement a system like GTA has and match assholes with assholes. 
---
Im freaked out by those 6 legged pink things that remind me of Centaurs from FO3. They spit acid at you and are tough as nails.
---
People.  I usually don't bitch about assholes on the internet.  This time I did.  Sue me.
---
luckyyyyyyy
---
Agreed.  What does it hurt to say something though?
---
I was talking about that yesterday to an IRL friend saying my impression is that everyone is trying to pull the blanket their way. 
---
Different modes, all of which involved violence and destruction.  You don't have to participate in them, but asking for it to be removed from the game because you don't like them removes player choice and betrays the roots of the series.  If you want to play a game with small children or if you need a safespace then find another game.
---
Anglers? I have my settlement in the top right of the map and there is always one trying to fuck up my house.
---
Really, this is getting my raider juices flowing.  This post might have actually inspired me to play.
---
They're roleplaying people with no money! They're entirely free to roleplay as people with no money if they want! Maybe they're roleplaying someone who'd just been raided by someone roleplaying a raider!  
---
:D
---
Will you be selling your old set once you're finished with it? what kinda price would that go for. 
---
That's part of my point though. The emergent experience I envision or that I'm trying to describe wouldn't or can't exist in a split community. As soon as one mode becomes a safe haven and the other becomes just pvp that's two entirely different experiences and neither come close to simulating a post-apocalyptic wasteland with players facing and overcoming adversities. 
---
Yeah, I found out about the arches after a couple hours trying to get speed demon. In my defense, the loading screen only mentioned radaway.
---
Yes, sure. I also know a few locations where magazines spawn everytime. So I can just check the known magazine locations and hope.
---
Thanks, I will check those
---
Hi Jug!!!  i watched this vid like 5 mins after you posted it initally a  few days ago- another masterpiece!!!
---
Depends, I have a pistol build and use a good scope. From far away and using stealth, I can 1-2 shot people pretty well. 
---
What a fucking baby
---
I hear you loud and clear. but this is online bullying. you are causing someone harm. and if you just say it's a person's fault that it happened to them you're victim blaming. first world third world every world. it's shitty behavior. we are all humans that share this world and some of us strive to make it better for everyone. I'm sorry people feel the need to harm other people in order to enjoy their game play.
---
it is an actual mechanic in the game. and not everyone wants to participate hence giving Bethesda feedback and now it appears to be changing. those people wanting pvp will have that in survival but camp raiding a pacifist is NOT on common grounds fair pvp. it's griefing. it is bullying.
---
as far as helping people not in the virtual gaming world, maybe some of us already do: maybe we already give to charity, volunteer time and actually make a physical difference. and maybe on top of that some of us want the virtual world to be a better place too.
---
the point is, and the OP made it clearly - it's a world that real people play in game or not. being anonymous doesn't change that. actions have impacts. and what happened to his daughter was terrible. and it would be terrible had it happened go grown adults too. (in almost 800 hours played it happened to me multiple times. in fact 3 times in a 24 hour period at one point and I chose to never rebuild a shower I couldn't afford them months of flux grind go build and repair...) it's not a rare occurance at all and should not happen if Bethesda wants players to be happy. survival mode should be a solution for those that want that play.
---
The same freedom also allows you to be a public nuisance to people who mind their own damn business at the edges of maps because they get off to ruining your base. Survival mode was creat d literally for that reason, so people who enjoy pvp can do shit like what you suggest and the people who don‚Äôt want to participate can chose to play adventure mode
---
Before all else Bethesda needs to implement a cap to how much caps you lose in the case of a loss. Now you lose what, twice the number of your level in Survival? No way in hell I'm using my lvl 250 character.
---
I think people play like that because in the real world they feel that they have no control over their life, and making others have a miserable time in F76 gives them a feeling of control. It's pathetic.
---
Final Departure gives the Somerset Special, it takes place in roughly the same area as collision course. 
---
I‚Äôm leveling an alt and I‚Äôve been avoiding quests so I can get the high level rewards. I‚Äôve done collision course a ton and I don‚Äôt have the Special. 
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Somerset_Special
---
That‚Äôs kind of strange indeed. Do you use pistols a lot? 
---
PS4 :( Sorry.
---
Off top head, those with zero/negative caps cant hurt ya, or do 50% less damage at the very least....those that wanna argue that they can still be killed, eliminate your damage to them also that have zero or are negative, make it pointless to have a pointless battle for both sides. My view is...ya dont get to gamble/go to/have fun at the casino, spin the slots, play cards...meanwhile having no money/using the casinos money.
---
My feelings exactly.
---
Oh, sorry. Never intended to sound that way. But I've seen people on this sub say that Microsoft would not allow it, wich is not true. Even, Elder Srcolls Online can do it.
---
ASH HEAP BELONGS TO THE MOLE MINERS
---
I saw it at least twice yesterday.  The "hott" posts fluctuates a lot here though.
---
Can‚Äôt count the number of times that I‚Äôve shot my junk items on to the ground in a little paper bag in addition to shooting whatever is currently trying to kill me
---
You do have to opt in. By either controlling or contesting a workshop, or attacking them or retaliating when attacked. The first one (taking a workshop) requires a conscious choice, and the second (attacking/retaliating), you can avoid accidentally doing by turning pacifist on.
---
Called it.
---
The complaint was about the camp destruction, the utter lack of ability to opt out of it.  If all that happened is my kid switched off pacifist and got killed for it I would never have posted.  
---
Yes but Todd Howard said at PAX east this was one of the things they tried and it causes performance issues.
---
So they wanted it too, it just may not be feasible yet.
---
How do you get it to go indoors?
---
No, not those, those. Had to google and remembered the leg thing wrong. Its the snallygasters.
---
It still is, now it's getting grown adults to write a thesis based on why their special needs child should be allowed to play M rated titles and others need to adhere to rules that they don't know about or have agreed to.
---
Well I‚Äôm jealous you found yourself a good group of players to team with. My friend stopped playing so I‚Äôve been riding solo for a while 
---
Don't play Rust 
---
Ah, yes.
---
Agree on the private servers, I have wanted a private server option from the beginning. I even want the Atom Store accessible to my private server. But, private servers do not solve this guys issue because his daughter liked interactions with the largely friendly players on that server. 
---
My initial thought was that PvP should be removed from Adventure because PvP now has its own mode. But now that I think about it, what we really need is new functionality. Specifically, we need a ...
---
CALL FOR AID button in our Pip Boy. Like when we go down in battle but on a map level scale.
---
Follow me here. According to the lore, we were all together in the vault for 25 years. AND, our Pip Boys are all connected. Therefore, we should be able to broadcast a call for help that shows our location on the map. Then anyone who is of a friendly persuasion can come to aid - kind of like joining an event (maybe it would be an event). At that point, PvP should be fully open on that event. Friendly players can come in "guns blazing" like the 7th Cav to rescue the day. 
---
"You smell that? You smell that? Plasma son. I love the smell of Plasma in the morning"
---
The only hitch to this idea, is that griefers could use the functionality to fake a distress call and then ambush anyone coming to help. Maybe a randomized spawn point when people fast travel in so that the ambush is more difficult.
---
Or use the power pass through in the advanced power connectors plan?
---
You just move the C.A.M.P. object and they'll walk towards it.
---
I agree it's fine how it is, I'd just live to complicate it with more places to build lol
---
Your space is pretty lit, I had a saloon with a hidden basement for moonshine but it wasn't a full on store, nice!
---
He means Snallygasters. 
---
^^
---
Floating camps are fallout 76 cancer. Man I can't stand them.
---
Stardew Valley is often on sale.
---
this is fant**ASS**tic!
---
And thats why I posted.  Hopefully some of them will get that they are playing with real people.  Im even OK with it, as long as I am not forced to participate.
---
They're really just cute decorations. They do some defending but most arent going to be higher than lvl 20 and dies easily. I'd actually only reccoment a pet for a remote location without spawns just so it stays around longer. A turret is going to do you a lot more service for defence.
---
Sorry the wasteland isn‚Äôt stylish enough for you 
---
Yeah, I found out the hard way too.
---
Had one last night.  Was great with 5-8 low level guys hiding in the shed while 5 of us tried killing everything. She ended up not taking damage, or very very little of it.  Laggy as all hell, terrible.  Xbox as well.

LMAO

Vintage Nukashine is like pure distilled Candlejack essence. You knock it back and before you know it you‚Äôre ju
---
Or give him the advanced power connectors plan
---
Damn it man! It's so simple it just might work!
---
Just cause you are entitled to do it, or its within the rules, does not mean you are not an asshole when you do.  
---
I understand you point.  
---
From a personal point of view, it takes a lot of time and effort to obtain some items within the game.  Issue of rarity is often subjective, so for the purposes of illustration, set that aside.
---
Capitalism being what it is, let me expound upon my thought above.
---
Apply an IRL principle and equate the vendorbots "suggested value" to MSPR.  
---
IRL, something selling at 30x it's MSRP is usually considered price gouging/scalping.
---
IRL, would you would pay 30x sticker price for anything?  Would you not complain very loudly about the business wanting that kind of markup?  Asking questions like "do they think we are stupid?" "what are these people smoking" et al....
---
Carry that IRL principle back to the game, and what do you get?  shocked people saying you are insane, etc.
---
I miss MUDs :(. I was so addicted to one that was rp based when I was in college. It had MUD mechanics but you were expected to actually roleplay. When it went downhill I couldn't find any other MUD that didn't just have people trying to level up with no roleplaying involved. And I didn't really want to go MUSH, I kinda liked the game deciding if I managed to pull something off.
---
I rarely see those while I play. I just see a bunch of scortched, a proportionally lather amount of deathclaws than fo4, moleminers, and super mutants. I rarely see anything else.
---
....and smoke 10 packs a day....
---
Use the metal bunker build set, set up reactor, lay bare wires into the structure, turn reactor on to electrify the entire structure... Profit.
---
That made me chuckle.....just a little.....don't want to blow my cover!
---
No, I know those, I‚Äôm talking specifically in general. You can still take chip damage, or have your camp be damaged. Pacifist should just equal pvp immunity unless you claim/contest a workshop or manually turn it off
---
Same. And ghouls.
---
Bloodied builds are severely under used IMO. People scoff at the idea of running around with 19% HP, but I rarely die with Nerd Rage + Emergency Protocols running all the time. I can take 1 melee hit from the queen, at which point I need to GTFO of there and let someone else tank. But doing 650+ damage per shot with a 91 fire rate .50 cal and seeing the queens health melt? Hearing people say after / during the fight "HOLY SHIT HER HEALTH IS DROPPING FAST" and "That was the fastest queen fight I've ever done"? Absolutely worth it.
---
Start at 331 damage, then add:
---
Adrenaline perk (60%) 530 damage
---
Pyscho of some kind (25%) 663 damage.
---
Wanna get really nuts? Die and get revived to activate Revenant for 50% more - 994 damage per shot at 9.1 shots per second.
---
If they ever fix Ballistic Bock (doesn't work with .50 cal sadly), I'd be looking at 1,142 damage per shot, 9 shots per second, or nearly 10K dps. And that's before you figure in Glowsight (60%), which I'm pretty sure works on the Queen since she's glowing when she comes out.
---
Clothing is the absolute best weight/value proposition in the game. Straitjackets, ski outfits, golf outfits, &amp; ranger outfits are all pretty common and can clear out a vendor's caps for 1-2 pounds of carry weight.
---
Okay. 
---
*stares at world of warcraft*
---
Been wondering the same sort of thing myself
---
Lol I wish you all the best 
---
Well ya gotta play the game, join social media groups, make friends and trade....ya cant get mad at someone cause they got better gear then you. Not everyone with TSE stuff or explosive top tier weapons duped themselves, they buy from people with spares...as can you, gotta search around Facebook and here and get out there, these weapons and gear arent gonna fall in your lap.
---
yeah, forgot about those.
---
O M G....can you next work on World Peace, Transporter Beams, turning lead into gold and most importantly, cars that run on air?
---
Forced PVP is one of the many reasons I quit the game.
---
Wont happen in any case.  A good majority of people do not want to exist as content for the worst part of the community.  They will just leave the game.  And it will die, as, frankly, griefers dont buy shit.  
---
be right back, getting popcorn for this thread
---
This game is for everyone mature enough to accept that assholes exist.  Like, do you think calling someone an asshole for acting like an asshole is somehow going to change them?  They know they are being an asshole, and the more you hate it, the more they enjoy it.
---
I didn't think a primer for internet trolls would be needed in 2019, but here we are.
---
They are playing the game as it was intended and expected to be played. The earliest trailers of the game showed destroying bases was an aspect of the game. 
---
You are the entitled one for expecting the whole thing to change for you and your kid, who clearly shouldn't be playing a post apocalyptic violent game full of very mature content. 
---
It's like going on COD and complaining that people are ruining your gameplay because the enemy team keep killing you. It sounds like you should introduce your kid to minecraft or something. 
---
The game is multiplayer, you are indeed just content for other players. Why tf do i have to explain all this to a grown man, let alone a parent?  
---
Because it was poorly received by the gaming community at large: It massively skewed the player base towards "rabid fandom of Bethesda's Fallout games".
---
And of course, if you're a rabid fan of Bethesda's Fallout games, getting to share that fandom with other, equally rabid fans is fun all by itself. There's no need to troll people for shits and giggles. And you generally don't feel the need to get hyper competitive, either, because the Bethesda games you are such a fan of are not competitive games; you're just not that kind of gamer.
---
So it's all about the homogeneity and nature of the player base. IMHO, of course.
---
Yep, I've been actively farming magazines and completed the games collection long before most of the magazine sets. I still need a couple of magazines for achievements too
---
Its very...appropriate to a certain game style.  
---
Are you on PS4?  If so we can group and I should have enough junk to do a full repair.  I know it doesn't fix mean people, but it should fix your kids camp!
---
The games I was in prior to being killed over and over had literally nobody ever going there, this was the first few weeks after launch. I don‚Äôt think it matters how underpowered I am, I simply just want to play a game I paid for without being trapped, because I was broke when I made it to the factory the last game and I hadn‚Äôt had a camp to travel to because I hadn‚Äôt known it was a free fast travel from anywhere.
---
"While other players are able to attack player settlements while they are online, the game preserves player creations using "blueprints" to prevent players from having to start over if their creations and progress are destroyed.[22]"
---
He's the PoS because he wants the world to change because he wants to see his daughter build bases and is too lazy to RTFM, it seems.
---
Apparently not too much cause Bethesda already has a fix inbound.  
---
It happened to me , just by walking in the mine as soon as event was finishing I got 4 jumpsuits as reward, didn‚Äôt see the pop up but when checked my inventory behold 4 jumpsuits who knows I didn‚Äôt have them so I kept them 
---
Whilst the handmade is essentially an Ak47, the Chinese is more based on the RPD with the shape and chunkiness of the handguard and the barrel alignment. Personally I like the Chinese more as it looks looks a little uncanny and fictional, which I prefer in Fallout. 
---
I keep my camp on a lead node with two aster spawns.  If you're looking for nodes, [this post should help](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9yza6w/i_made_a_map_of_resource_deposits/), but as for locations to pick up lots of copper I've just found them randomly.
---
Feed them Toxic Goo and tell them it gives them super powers. I mean it *isn't* a lie...
---
Starched Genes is 2 points in Luck that lock in your mutation so that Radaway does not remove it, its basically a necessity once you have a mutation
---
So I accidentally did this to myself during a SB Queen fight the other day. PSA: Keep a few items between your purified water and nuke shine. 
---
Nope, at least as of Dec.
---
Think about ot like this then, a mission to the moon costs millions and millions, actual cost of materials is minuscule in comparative value, the games suggested price is essentially saying how much it cost for materials and not the effort that goes into actually going there
---
Can you have more than one in your camp at a time?
---
The wanted system is too easy to fix (mercy kill from a teammate), and trying to handle all reports of griefing would bring the complaint Dept at Bethesda to an even deeper standstill.
---
Even if walls were indestructible and locks were truly the only way to enter a home, it's easy enough to just deal with the wanted tag.
---
Plus, what would you do on once you got in? What's the endgame for entering? To take out the owner who came to their place to defend. Much of the motivation behind destroying a home, now, is to trigger a pvp from a frustrated player who's home has been demolished.
---
Read the comments.  Im not alone in this.  I tend to live and let live.  Just this once I wanted to say something.  Hint: Its OK to advocate for systems which minimize the impact of trolling.
---
Yes, and then people learned how valuable the place is, and it became a hotly contested area.
---
You are playing the game you paid for, you just don't like being on the shit end of the stick.
---
Do you propose the higher level character should not have been able to kill you and take over the factory?  because it sounds like you should be playing a different game entirely if so.
---
I have had a deathclaw and a sloth they were fun to have around camp, but they die fast and are hard to find.
---
http://imgur.com/MQmMPn9
---
Iv thought this as well. I would even be cool with the small outpost just sharing the space from your camp.q
---
No but legacy weapon , you won‚Äôt see lazer with explosive beans anymore 
---
Looks like someone‚Äôs having a case of the Mondays!
---
Thanks. I assumed as much but hoped otherwise. It would be interesting to open up play styles a bit by modifying weapons you wouldn‚Äôt typically associate with a build. But could lead to a ton of confusion too. 
---
I don't.  Perhaps all the people telling me to go play minecraft ought to go play Rust?  
---
Agreed.  Thus the apology.
---
while there is an advanced connector that goers through the wall it does not snap perpendicularly to it so it still needs work
---
Great, live and let live, just play the game according to the rules I have not made public, and we'll all have fun here.
---
Hint: It's okay for trolls to have an environment to be trolls.  This is not a hate crime.
---
Last night I was simply crouching in power armor with no stealth field and one shot a ghoul with a handmade rifle so I don‚Äôt think it has to be melee. 
---
Nope I couldn‚Äôt even get close enough to start taking it before I was suddenly shot by an explosive gun. Dumb old me shot back because I thought that the balance in this game might make it possible for me to win despite the level difference, but as you might expect, nope.
---
Yes.  Next question
---
Also go for the super duper perk so if you bulk them you might get double for free 
---
Sweet
---
Normal high level mutants can be tough to kill to start with.  @L49, ran across one in the divide; dont remember if it was an executioner or vampire weapon that finally took him out.
---
Amusingly, it dropped a handmade 1\* with a +30% damage against mutants :)
---
Witchhunting is against the rules of the sub.  Though I wish I had a list of gamertags of these people I could proactively blacklist.
---
Bullshit‚Ä¶ here I was, just walking by a few of those hunchbacks and they tried to assault me! They shot first! I had to do it. 
---
&gt;**I truly don't think all people who RP raiders are horrible.  Most of them are just having a different kind of fun than I am.** 
---
No, you're right: they're asshats. If they want to "roleplay" as a hated group, then they deserve all the hate they get. They get their jollies out of ruining everyone else's fun, and they should not be insulated from the repercussions thereof by *our* civility. Fuck 'em. 
---
All that said, let your kid know that it's a simple matter to rebuild the camp. Using the "repair all" feature, you can put everything back the way it was before the idiots came along. 
---
I will.  And bitch about it in one single Reddit post.
---
If you 'fermented" it... you'd end up with Wasteland Kumis, not cheese.
---
Maybe if you don't have the caps to pay then you should lose a random weapon or armor piece equal to the price of the caps. Oh wouldn't that suck! There goes that TSE hahahaha
---
Noticed the same with one violent night event. Maybe an overall buff of damage done by high level enemies..
---
I agree 100%  Im all for people playing the game as they wish to.  Including myself.  I should just be able to opt out of being a target.  Thus multiple game modes.  
---
I actually like this idea. Im going to steal it. Gracias
---
Shhsh don‚Äôt give it away
---
I'm in a moneyless phase in my life yet if i scam people online i'll be punished too.
---
Asshole behavior never deserves an excuse
---
and this was for Agility it Perception?
---
You aren‚Äôt on a trade sub
---
*logic processing* *all two brain cells connecting* 
---
Okay so I'll just kill my friends for caps.  
---
*Logic complete*
---
yeah, honestly wasn't expecting that haha.
---
i think if they remove legendaries, and require new characters for the survival, we could have a solid mode
---
but also id like to see harsher weather, less items in game, stronger diseases, etc etc for a real survival mode
---
Is Unyielding sought after? I usually vendorize it as soon as I get it.
---
On that note, what‚Äôs worth saving up to sell to players?
---
With the changes to PvP attempting to limit/eliminate one hit kills, and I can only assume Bethesda will continue going in that direction, I'd say the dragon may be too slow reloading to rely on. Though you could just use it as your initiator and quickly switch to a faster weapon for follow-up.
---
Currently Lock and Load is bugged when using Harpoon guns, you get faster reload but you can‚Äôt fire the gun which sucks. But even with that I think harpoon is great, I have collected a whole bunch of them including bloodied, instigating, ts, tse, medic, etc lol. If you can put up with the lack of fancy mods and slow reload (still faster than Dragon), it‚Äôs a very efficient weapon and you don‚Äôt ever need to worry about ammo. In fact I keep dumping harpoons because the weight adds up quickly. 
---
They do not exist.  The extra stars are just for future expansion of the loot system.
---
Ad Victoriam brother. 
---
And I enjoy the heck out of it when I see people like you.  I had a Raider murder me for a public workshop once, he looked the part.  It was fun.  If I dont want to get murdered I can just not take public workshops.  When they can level my base its different, over a line.  Glad to see a Raider who gets that.  
---
It feels very not Fallout limiting villainy.  I blew up Megaton in Fallout 3.  I joined Caesars Legion on one playthrough of New Vegas.  These practices, while true to Fallout lore and atmosphere, would be condemned as ruining the game in Fallout 76 culture.
---
This or a debufff would be fine.  I think penalty should be severe. They can play adventure if it's too hard.  
---
Hey buddy .. thanks for keeping this old thread alive hehe .. I'm not mad, at least not anymore. But you are dead wrong on commando play with handmade. The damage is very low on the TSE (118 pr shot) and the accuracy is even worse. I have sneak + covert ops + chameleon mutation and weightless armor. All of it malfunctions all the time. I gave up on rifle completely. I'm bloodied shotgun build now. 700 damage pr shot on a 1\* double barrel shotgun with adrenal + nerd rage and health at 20%. Works well with PA so I never die. Queen is too easy on this setup and everything else dies in 1 or 2 shots. Bloodied builds are way better that TSE in the old days.. so much for balance lol...
---
holy shit you must a true kid to think 30  is old ahhaha
---
YES, exactly! There is a big difference between actual PvPers and Raider RPers and legit griefers. Nothing at all wrong with the first two. But if you‚Äôre hurting or ruining someone else‚Äôs fun and gameplay for simply your own entertainment you‚Äôre a griefer. 
---
maybe even a powered door with a keypad ON BOTH SIDES 
---
Yeah we will see.  Vats seems to still be able to one shot at the moment but that could also change.
---
If I wanted to play Rust I would have bought it.  This is people just exploiting holes in the game mechanics to ruin someone elses fun.  Fortunately it appears a fix is inbound.
---
[You can use this if you like](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)
---
Who said I was mad?
---
I said penalizing cash-poor players further would be a bad idea.
---
I then gave an example of how a run of bad luck could easily deplete your caps, having nothing to do with intentional money dumping in order to grief.
---
That said - the majority of existing TSE weapons are remnants of the duping days, and saying otherwise is just lying to yourself.
---
Therefore, like I‚Äôve already said, unless they completely purge duped items (not likely), or make Survival playable only with Survival specific characters, I‚Äôm not going on solo anymore.
---
Funny enough, I've never had anyone throw one at me either so I'm not sure.
---
Don‚Äôt be so literal.  Obviously there would be more too it than that.  But I for one check out survival mode. When I did I had 3 caps and zero junk and zero aid items on my person.  I don‚Äôt want to lose that stuff I spend more than half the time in the game collecting it rather than doing missions and exploring. 
---
Good idea
---
WanderingWol15, I'll go ahead and send you an invite. Would love to team up some time.
---
Its not if you build a substantial base, particularly one that takes advantage of the terrain.  
---
I suppose I'm over simplifying Haha, but regardless of method I just want to make some cheese.
---
Which was already said prior to survival coming .. WE ALL knew these chumps would get tired of the Ass whooping they would get and would come back to adventure mode.  The good news is that the pacifist update should be coming real soon .. 
---
I gave ya an upvote .. And just wanted to throw my 2 cents in on top of yours. 
---
The thing about it which really pisses me off .. You get nothing for destroying a base .. So I dont even understand what the incentive is for allowing it .. other then maybe someone tries to trap you. Okay so Bethesda gives you the option to destroy a wall so you can get out BUT you are the one penalized if you got trapped  and blow away a wall ? So Again .. I really don't see why this was part of the game. 
---
Makes sense thanks
---
This! My CAMP always has one random half wall so I can bring power inside 
---
Well that would be dissapointing
---
Why do I have to explain that acting like an asshole makes you an asshole?
---
Why are shotguns good? Does each pellet count as a crit?
---
U still gonna die to a vats crit headshot from a pipe rifle.   
---
Also, Mr "bloodied TSE" you know that's not possible Right?  Lol.
---
Don't worry your not the only one complaining that had no idea about the game mechanics lol.  
---
Bloodied two shot explosive.  Right.
---
Sounds like a great idea. 
---
Nope my build has only ever been stealth rifleman 
---
That's what I surmised/suspected.....always hopeful though!
---
Yeah thats a good ide
---
&gt; How do you get serums? 
---
 Serums and serum recipes were planed as very rare end game rewards, but they were (/are) heavily dupped and too many users got all the recipes to craft them. 
---
 Actually you can buy serums with caps very cheap from players in Discord, Reddit... 
---
Better than to buy them for 15x times more from Modus like I did before the duppers infestation... :(
---
Doesn't effect vats, but does effect map markers... For example I have 21 perception and see people coming a mile away which works brilliantly for my sniper build. 
---
Bad guys spawn inside my generator shack. There isn't room to stand inside the shack next to the generator but they find a way. I have to remove a wall to kill them.
---
I found a corner and built a super minimal cap ( stash, bedroll and that's it ).  I'm only a level 6 lol.  Just stay away from train stations and vault 76.
---
Agreed.  Its also ok for me to call them out for it.
---
Flatwoods monster can also attack your camp (it happened to me, just about had a heart attack since it was my first time even seeing one)
---
I was content to let them have the factory but I just wanted to go elsewhere because dying on a loop isn‚Äôt fun at all. Kill me the first time on my approach to the factory? Fine, maybe they were defending their territory or something. That sends a good enough signal that the factory won‚Äôt be mine. But after that it just seems like overkill.
---
Why not just connect the house outside? Maybe I'm reading this all wrong, but at my camp I just wire the outside of the house around the top and everything inside works. Like I said I may be reading this wrong so my appologies if I am.
---
Basicly effects range, no massive difference in accuracy. 
---
But what if your camp is in a place that can only be reached by Fast Travel and/or Marsupial mutation... :)
---
The conduit sucks and takes up way too much budget.
---
&gt; They want to harass people and they're not having fun when everyone is like them. And now Adventure mode is filled with people who think they're safe from wannabe raiders which means prime pickings for a-holes.
---
Yes exactly.   I kept seeing people say "Now that survival mode is here, the griefers will leave us alone!" I'm way too cynical too believe that would happen lol.  
---
Ummm... how about you look in the game and find the readily available pass through conduit piece?
---
I don‚Äôt know specifically which one was last night, but I‚Äôve had a few of both and I‚Äôve always used a handmade for any sneak shots I have to do for these Biv quests because that‚Äôs easier than getting close. 
---
Ive seen people RPing raiders who dont do this shit.  They hunt down people with bounties, and play in survival now.  I think people should be allowed to be assholes, as long as I have tools to avoid playing with them.
---
This right here, people don't understand that not everyone uses reddit lol I'll always go with my father said, you can sell something for whatever you want, the important point is whether someone is willing to pay that.
---
Sheogorath approves... mostly; also... purple.
---
This guy saying what I always wanted to say.
---
If they fixed it so the switch on the inside worked properly I'd be happy...instead now I had to install another and click it from the outside to close the door on my panic room / jack pad
---
Oh, that‚Äôs nice :) I am not fond of the current ammo material grind, so win win in that respect. Thanks :)
---
Um you can get to 25 in 30 mins farming ammo factory. Need a fuck ton of alum/steel 
---
Thank's Elimarand, appreciate that. :)
---
exactly, its not what you ask, its how you ask for it
---
The idea has been the rounds here on reddit. [A community manager has replied to a similar thread before.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/au4vjx/a_fridge_for_camp_that_you_can_store_raw_food_to/)
---
I'd like to also add that if a fridge were to be implemented, include "Ice Cold" to drinks for double duration for effects.
---
Or a garage door with a switch on both sides
---
I'm an advocate of no pvp for this game, so please, don't preach about the ethics of what behavior the game allows to me.
---
She turned it off. Sure thing, Jussie.
---
If I were in that situation one my thoughts would have been 'how are you dying, pacifist mode is on, this should be literally impossible', at which point I would have checked that it was still on and turned it back on if not. It's a very obvious thing to check, and I dont believe anyone would have not checked it (especially since you must have seen this unfolding since you were watching her build the base in the first place). Having done that I wouldn't have come to Reddit to say pacifist was on and paint this dramatic picture of a special needs kid balling while futilely attacking her assailants and being killed repeatedly. I would expect that you would have said she turned pacifist mode off to defend her fort and was thus fair game for pvpers. That's not what you said.
---
No, more likely you had an experience where someone wrecked your base and you made up all this fluff and used your (possibly nonexistent) special needs kid to really sell it, earn your Reddit awards, and be an internet hero.
---
No I get that...but I have things that need to be plugged in (lighted posters)
---
At what level did you buy this stuff and have those caps?
---
Because it actually looks physically possible? The floating one would be fine if you just put some pillars under it, they're not that much out of your build budget.
---
Personally I'm ok with one-foundation stair houses, I think they look like mushroom clouds, it's very meta
---
So don‚Äôt slot lock and load then, noted :) Thanks :)
---
so if it was intended why is it being turned off in an update soon?
---
Those 4 will come before some of these QoL changes requested come to Fallout 76
---
Had the same thing happen last night as well on PS4.  Some dude roles up and tries to PvP with me and my teammate.  We ignored them so they started destroying my door and fusion generator.  I bounced as fast as I could and blocked them before coming back in.  That's the first time I've ever had someone destroy something in my CAMP.  It was cheap to repair, but come on...  If I don't want to fight, move on.  Don't get all pissy and destroy things.  Sadly the people that can't hack it in Survival, stick to Adventure Mode now.  And yes, it's a PvP game but just because you can do something, doesn't mean you should. 
---
To be fair I've seen TSE duped selling for 100 caps or less. And some of them looked pretty good. (Disclaimer : I haven't bought them, it was in the xbox lfg tab.)
---
Don‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôre not the only one on the Internet with poor spelling and a weak grasp of sarcasm.
---
Thank you for giving me an idea to try at my tree/waterfall house base
---
Well, the primary issue is explosives doesnt  get any sneak damage bonus.  My handmade will top out at  633 damage with all multipliers in play  (with probably close to 50% armor penetration)  And crushing blow topped out at \~420?  with instigating in effect.  That's pretty sad.  Especially considering that the handmade is almost the weakest rifle I have.
---
I take all 9-10k caps with me on my level 200 guy.  But to each their own.  I think the double caps drop is rough but I don't think your solution will solve more problems than it creates.  *Logic test* *thinks of 30 or so problems* yeah it won't.  Sorry :)
---
My guess would be that if you can‚Äôt get in the building without marsupial that the vending machine would be placed where you -could- get to it. I‚Äôm not sure what you mean by only accessible by fast travel. Is this a camp placed somewhere you just can‚Äôt get to? I didn‚Äôt know you could do that, but again I would assume you could build the vending machine somewhere where it could be accessible. Not sure.
---
If your being a raider please wear raider clothes/armour so we know and make it easier to kill instead of x-01 power armour with a jetpack.
---
For me the bulldozer feature slightly broke and now literally all the grass in my camp is gone. It sounds well and good, until you realize I picked my home because it‚Äôs on the border of the Bog and Divide so I get the large pine trees mixed with the golden grass of the Bog. 
---
It is a thing, and there are commercial products that help it happen available
---
I see you're on Xbox and this happened for you...you have given this *gamer girl* hope that it'll happen for me one day!!
---
Not shitting you, I watched one try to hit me with a rocket last night, and he turned to the wall, fired right at it, and killed himself. So yeah... blind + explosives probably isn't the best combo. 
---
Yeah stash management is is a really lame mini-game. It seems like either I can keep the neat legendaries I find, OR I can keep crafting materials, but I don't have room for both.
---
Pistols can be pretty amazing, especially if you build it towards medium/long range. Soften them up and move for the kill. I highly recommend pistols if only because they're cheap and widely available, and although not as powerful as rifles you can move much faster to go for melee
---
I am level 226, I pretty much only build camps. I've built camps across 3 different characters, level 5, 50 and 200+. There is no difference in C.A.M.P. budget. Leveling up does not increase the budget or decrease the cost of C.A.M.P. items. There have however been several bugs in which items continued to take budget in the current camp placement after being removed such as wires, objects placed on top of other objects and tamed pets. Probably others. The budget discrepancies are likely real but not for the reasons people believe them to be.
---
Same here. Lvl 91 Civil War Ghost Sniper. Love helping the kids get ahead, and killing douchebags at the same time. I could even come and throw up some missile turrets for her. Gamer tag is MrBojeezy on XBone
---
Instigating lever action 480 (base with nerd rage as i run bloodied) x2 from instigating effecct then x2.50 from stealth = BIG hitter.
---
Pretty solid but I would swap power user for batteries included. The weight reduction on cores is very noticeable. Bloody mess is nice but I have been using 1 rank of lucky break, luck of the draw, and 4 leaf. They seem to proc fairly often. You could get speed demon for faster reloads and movement speed. 
---
Yeah, I think explosive is buffed more than we're seeing in the numbers.  Either way I tested bot my dragons on a full health lvl91 glowing deathclaw, and there was a big difference...  On paper the instigating shouldve come out on top, but it didnt.
---
Might as well, Obama got one for less.
---
Good thing is since they nerfed explosive, there‚Äôs only approx 20% damage gain for an explosive version vs non-explosive. You haven‚Äôt missed much if you have anti-armor or bloodied type of weapons. 
---
Perk cards have never worked for the stash. 
---
Using phone dont care.  Lucky I punctuate at all.  I'm at work.  Damn jobless antifa libtard.  
---
You should of used fallout 4 which is an isolated environment rather than an online world open to others opinions. You took your child into a crowded public space and are upset because other people didn't cater to the experience you were attempting to create. In a space you didn't own... Think about that for a minute. I'm a father of two. I would never do what you did with my children and blame someone else. Grow up and accept the fact your experience isn't PAR for the course or you are in a for a rude Awakening. Pardon me for not giving it some spit bu using your kid to illustrate a point beyond sold reflecting is really some low level scummy shit. Enjoy your gold ass hat.
---
Right you are! Not only did I get the wrong story, but my memory was actually dredging up a scene from New Vegas.
---
Don't take Jet kids, it'll mess you up for life!
---
3 of my friends who play fo76 pretty regularly are actually going to try this tomorrow night.
---
Because your stash doesnt receive the weight reductions your person does from perks. 
---
No not really.
---
Writing is actually a healthy method of dealing with unhealthy emotions.
---
Professionals have people write all the time. 
---
PVE on full health enemy.  I think I'll do some more testing just to be sure.
---
Anyone know what they're screaming at me when I'm murdering them? I almost feel like I can understand the gibberish. 
---
This is one of the more civil and friendly online communities I've ever been a part of. Alot of people are selling things but even more people freely offer their unused armor/ weapons without being asked.
---
I bet you didn‚Äôt bother to Google ‚Äúhyperbole‚Äù.
---
It‚Äôs not supposed to snap. You place it where need be. I have mine running power through a bee built concrete wall at my camp. If you‚Äôre on Xbox I will gladly help.

With the double xp bonus and these bonuses you‚Äôll get around 150% extra xp
---
Damn, thats a good point...  It'd be easy for a PVE enemy to have picked up rads somewhere, right?
---
Someone suggested dropping a random armour or weapon piece on the forums which I thought was a good idea. This would be a good way to balance players exploiting the no cap system. 
---
How about we just be able to do what we want. Gimme mods. Gimme place anywhere, scrap everything. 
---
Don't need to.  I know it's not the same as sarcasm.  Which you clearly don't lol
---
Does this essay sound like it was written by someone that absorbed the morals of the lesson?
---
First thing I do when I wake up is grab my missile launcher and switch it to full-auto.
---
Most of the Time the Usual Npcs that you can find in that area are hostile to these mobs and kill em. I guess because f76 is a online game everthing happens in realtime? The first time  you trigger the event, those Mobs from the Event are spawning in. In the time you fast travel to them they fight against other hostile mobs and die. The game probably thinks YOU are near those Event Mobs and thats why they spawn and through that the normal Mobs also spawn.

I got the vebdor right now but no coat. Any1 wanna help me get this one and one for yourself ? Add me ign yantradub . Dont know how long it will stay alive tho so be fast
---
What I'm hearing is don't even let them on the Survival Server if they are broke? I could get behind that
---
If you get any BE heavy weapons, you let me know heh.
---
There also a few that spawn in the watoga highschool in desks, I found 3 last night while looting
---
You'd get a punched around here for saying something like that.
---
Wondering if we are getting some tidbits on the upcoming player vending today?
---
Like my topic says "Bethesda, how about instead of **conduit**..." 
---
In my experience Unyielding or assassin + sent will only be traded for similar pieces or GG weapons.
---
Congrats man, those headaches are a bitch. If possible, try to keep yourself weaned off coffee. You'll find yourself much more alert most of the time, and when you do need a pick me up the coffee will actually work as intended.
---
all you need to do to fix it is click 1 button, wtf are you on about?
---
Oh, don't worry, I get it.
---
in mass production, you can spread your (R &amp; D and) labor across multiple units to help keep costs down.    Legendaries are not exactly mass produced, so it more intrinsic value, which is much harder to determine.
---
Nature of the game (literally and figuratively) "suggested value" doesn't account for time/effort/other mats expended to obtain the item in the first place.  
---
(and IRL, there are countles people that part does not matter, only the bottom line is of concern) 
---
The reverse is also true if we sell to vendors - you burned how many stimpacks/radx to kill a legendary, and for the piece of armor you got, the vendor only offers 6 lousy caps for? 
---
What a cheapskate :)
---
 To that end, I'm applying real world economic experience to game economy to theorize why some sellers get the reactions they do.
---
Also there is no zero cap debuff in survival.  Another mechanic you seem to be "sarcastic" about.  It's in adventure only.  
---
I'm sure you could but this is totally intended. Caps would be super easy to make if the value was accurate. Morrowind was the perfect example of this. Some weapons price were so high that you could broke the whole economy and get super rich in no time. 
---
Fallout 76 approach to that is different. Bethesda wants every cap to be meaningful and also want to the grinding part to be central to the game.
---
Yeah, the other day on another site i was kinda shocked to see how some of the people who shit this game are calling it : "Inventory Simulator" or something like that.
---
But sadly, it's kinda true. On my main i can't even tell where does all that weight come from. And i'm not really over weight, until i go out and try to continue the main quest line.
---
A good prank leaves everyone, even the target, laughing.
---
definitely a joke.
---
And missiles. 
---
If you can‚Äôt understand how hyperbole and sarcasm can work together, then there‚Äôs little I can do for you.
---
Check out my post history for some schizophrenia :)
---
Where do u get scorched killer??
---
If you really wanna get you feathers rustled look up the markup on printer inc cartridges
---
I'd bet my house on it.
---
In runescape your level was calculated based on the total of your combat preparedness caculatwd from several different stats. It allowed you for example to decide "I want to be level X with so and so attack and such and such defence".
---
In Fallout, on the contrary, its level 60-70 guys that are the most dangerous. Usually secondary, alt characters of players with level 200+ mains who decided the caps punishment for death is not worth it if enemies are level 70 and fully armed to teeth.
---
If you allowed for level separation here, what would happen is that each level category would have its griefers -  people armed to teeth in level 20 godrolls. I myself have a TSE level 10 rifle and its a viable weapon even for higher level character.
---
Currently the situation is like this: levels 200+ are lazy pvpers who didn't want to build another toons. Level 50-70 are where most of dedicated players are.
---
No clue, but it does sound "this close" to something intelligible. I turned captions on for a while to see if it would give me a clue, but it just says like "muffled grunting" or "anguished yelling" rather than actually translating.
---
Yeah no dude was trolling. He refused to provide proof, and eventually his post was either removed or he deleted it cause of all the back lash. Pissed me off that someone would pull some dumb shit like that without proof
---
After you repair (I hope you do) could I get a tour or see screen shots? I work with special need children and I would love to see what she did!
---
Good.  I'm hoping you fix yourself lol.  Haven't seen so many misleading misinformed statements in a post in a long time.   
---
This app needs a happy/laughter emote. You made my morning! 
---
I never trust trade invites anymore.  Anyone who genuinely wants to give me something drops it on the ground for me, and vice versa.  And if they drop by my camp and offer to make me something, I happily provide them with the resources needed to do it.  I wouldn't even be diplomatic with anyone who expects to just be given things.
---
Because Gamers don't play it.
---
PS4 has similar issue for me.  
---
They can hear me, I see their icons animate, but I can't hear them.  
---
party chat works great.
---
I too have noticed the helpful posts all week. The loot breakdown, the best areas to farm, stats on weapons and armor. It feels good to browse this sub again!
---
I think we figured out what happened.  I forgot she had a workshop running.  So Im guessing that got contested and bam...hostile.  She claims she didnt turn it off, but you just never know.  I honestly did not expect this on the post though.  I figured I would vent a bit, get downvoted by the PVP crowd, end of story.  
---
I‚Äôve been running a pistol build since December.
---
It‚Äôs not as viable as rifles or melee but it‚Äôs also not terrible.
---
VATS is the key though. High agility and high luck are pretty much crucial.
---
I run a VATS crit build and can hit the damage cap in survival mode.
---
You seem awfully angry.
---
Is it because you run a Bloodied TSE Chameleon build with 0 caps and you don‚Äôt want to lose your crutch?
---
I am so hype to shoot a Supermutant for ~300xp in Survival right now. 
---
..or at least my CAMP 
---
OP is a middle aged white mom 
---
Because the game actively discourages PVP outside of those who seek it. 
---
You don‚Äôt need the key, just go to the dome and see if the door was open. Hop server if necessary. I went through all the troubles to get the key, yet when I got to the dome the door was wide open and the plan was right there laying on the table as if nobody wanted it lol. 
---
I won't be on until 3pm cst. My GT is Arsenal iv.
---
Yeah, it's what feel fun for me too. But i'll have to forget about "end game content" it seems, as i'm not interested in the bloodied builds.
---
I guess its failure to open strong was a blessing in disguise. 
---
Well deserved, I glad to hear you guys had a blast! 
---
You got it...waiting till after the patch though.  
---
Proof?
---
Humanoids definitely, animals I‚Äôm not sure for rads But considering npc‚Äôs battle each other too, any form of splash dmg or any dmg really will negate it. I love the idea behind the weapon but seems like it almost needs to be changed to ‚Äú90% dmg or higher‚Äù or something a little more viable
---
Or they could play Rust (shrug)
---
He's a father.  For most parents, anyone that hurts your kid is the worst possible person in the world.  Doubly so if that child has special needs and can't understand how to avoid the situation or defend themselves.  It's not rational, but it's not supposed to be either.
---
I think people are doing the math on this Double XP for Survival wrong. I keep seeing people say ‚Äú40% bonus‚Äù.
---
In Survival you are earning 120% of normal (Adventure Mode) XP. Am I wrong in my interpretation that we will be earning 240% of normal (Adventure Mode) XP?
---
I believe it's unlocked through the responders quest line 
---
Im totally OK with that. Im just asking for a passive mode server.  Sounds like Ill basically be getting it.
---
updated. see above. 
---
Is it worth the hit to accuracy though? I'd rather take an Anti-Armor or Bloodied, or Quad. 
---
Shame i can't buy it.will it be released again for selling or will it be forever closed?
---
This is the dumbest thing I have ever heard, wow. The only times PVP is your fault is when you're the one initiating, or you have a workshop. If someone is not in pacifist mode, and doesn't want to PVP, they have every right to keep walking and not fight back. It's not their fault that someone is trying to start a fight, dumbass.
---
Thanks, you totally get what I was saying.  
---
Hmm idk if I did responders quest line. Where do I find that?
---
No one's asking for all violence/destruction to be gone, just less intense so we can do other things too. Why do peeps keep saying go play another game...there's Adventure, Survival and probably a Hardcore Mode coming someday--all those of us on the other end of the spectrum would like is a different kind of choice. There really can be room enough in this game for everyone.
---
You can just grief people's bases?   I might have to get this game...
---
First, Two-shot is just kinda garbo in general now since the nerf. What you want is bloodied. A BE laser rifle would be extremely rare because it's a legacy weapon.
---
Second - none of the armor reduction perks that work for rifles, pistols, shotguns, heavy weapons, etc. actually work for energy weapons, so you're eating the full damage resist of the target, which puts energy weapons far behind other weapons. BGS knows this and it should be fixed "soon".
---
Third - Laser rifles still break pretty fast. Adding the shotgun mod to them seems to make them break even faster. Same thing happens with gatling plasma. I think it's because the game treats each individual pellet as a shot, and applies durability damage accordingly.
---
Fourth - very small clip size, though in all fairness, an automatic variant is similar in clip size to an AP handmade magazine, although the handmade magazine adds 30% armor piercing.
---
The one advantage would be enhanced crits through VATS, since laser weapons have I believe "vicious" barrels that have superior crit damage. If you were making a dedicated VATS crit sniper, this might be worth looking into. In that case, you'd probably want a Bloody + 50% VATS Crit laser rifle.
---
Good to hear this! And if we can ever get private servers I may actually try the game!
---
Would they all be a flat reasonable price?
---
Yellow Sandy??
---
I'm sorry, but that's asinine. If your options are that you have to change or do something different, then it absolutely caters to them. If they don't have change and only you do, then you are the only one being fucked.
---
Yeah.  I'd love to see a Fallout on the scale of GTAO with correct proportions.  I guess we'll have to wait.
---
Some mods add a star.
---
As a gang PvP oriented person I'm not against the seasonal system and I would definitely play it. But I'd also love to be able to use my fully decked character against other people fully decked characters. So while I'm in favour of survival seasonal system,  I'd love if some form of current relationship between survival and aventure remained, and that I could use my current character to compete against other people.
---
This would give the people the "fresh out the vault" experience that only beta players had, and thats fair thing to share, and simultaneously allow you to grow the existing communities and organised skirmishes PvPers.
---
Yup.  Drives me crazy.  
---
RIP player vending for the foreseeable future :(
---
Well said.
---
Well that's some bull. They aren't even providing a good explanation for it.
---
FYI that guy is not asking for 60k caps, the post is wanting the gun, and offering the caps.
---
You will always have my support. My u/ and my gt match. I have taught some, as well as being a parent, so I understand how kids can be devastated by bullies. Not so much by the physical part, but for merely being targeted. At lower levels, I have been griefed. Might still happen, but things are better every day.
---
If I can help, please drop me a message to my gt. 
---
The point of the wasteland is the primitive aspect of linking together things. This isn't home depot where it's a all in one wall, you need to MAKE it
---
No. I'm going to continue calling out people who decide to use PVP to be an asshole, I'm going to continue to insult and belittle those people because they're assholes and they deserve it.
---
&gt; "Ice Cold"
---
Weren't these in FO4? This sounds vaguely familiar.
---
Yeah. My plan was to just pick up every plan possible, and make caps through sheer volume rather than having high prices.
---
Check post history in regards to both questions.  ;)
---
I run a power fist on my main.  Leveling an alt (3rd) to use a bloodied non explosive the dragon I found, in a vats crit build since it also has an increased vats crit chance on it.  I do have TSE weapons stored on an alt because they are garbage now, so I find it funny that y'all still complain about them.  Nobody was duping bloodied ranged weapons before so the bloodied you're dying to are freshly found.  Dont believe me then try to buy one for Real money and they will be asking for over 100 bucks for them  because they only have one lol.  Lastly you can see I've been calling for extreme negative penalties for having no caps in survival.  Next question 
---
Thank you for this response. I may be misreading your response, or I worded the OP poorly, but I'm not talking about level restricted zones. I'm talking about zones where if a level 10 encounters a level 70, and I agree that anything above 56 is irrelevant, they won't be blown away helplessly. So, for example, in a "10 level zone" that level 70 could only engage with 60-80. 
---
&gt;Basic Repair Kits will be unlockable in the Atomic Shop 
---
oh fuck. brace yourselves for the wave of "REEEEEEEEEEEEEE PAY2WIN!!!!!!!!!!!!"
---
but you are ok with 30 foot  tall mirelurk queens, mutations that let us jump over a tall building, supermutants and scorchbeasts?
---
but a house with a stairway that leads to a house raised up off the ground breaks it all for you?
---
ok...
---
Repair Kits on the Atomic Shop? Unless I understood that wrong, I'm getting some BDO vibes here.
---
no, raw fluxes picked up in the nuke zone. I'd have tried even harder to find someone that dropped a bag of stable fluxes and junk.
---
but 30 foot tall mirelurk queens are real enough for ya huh?
---
k...
---
They are too retarded for survival that‚Äôs why they will stay in Adventure and keep harassing new players 
---
nukesdragons.com
---
Yes.
---
Noooooooooooo
---
Well I don't think this is positive news. 
---
I think a lot of people never realize who may be on the other end. I have had FPS games like team fortress 2 where  a 6 or 7 yo gets on and the entire team goes quiet, no one says a word other than hi.
---
I really really really believe Bethesda screwed up on Pvp. They have not had a game where it was in before so they have limited experience and honestly most games cannot find a balance for PVP.
---
I want private servers so I can host one, with friends, control who is on it, and we can actually do the content without players who "act" as raiders etc.
---
With no mods fallout 4 "raiders" are near your level. There is no level restriction on Pvp which is part of the problem for FO76
---
More like "pay for convenience". Which isn't much better anyway.
---
is may not the foreseeable future?
---
Machetes have a sacrificial blade mod that can add a 4th star for bleed damage.
---
Yeah, as soon as I find a +1 STR to replace a current piece, I'll sell that piece.
---
I'll probably sell limbs for 1k and chest piece for 2k. They're all 2 and 3*.
---
So you just figured that out in the last few minutes, huh?  Not in the last 16 hours from when this was originally posted or not in your last reply to me a few moments ago? She was building her camp but also went on an adventure to claim a workshop?
---
I think what you are doing is trying to think of excuses for what might explain your discrepancies when telling the story originally - throwing it all at the wall and seeing what sticks.
---
Hopefully others can see this for what it is, a rant based on a grain of truth (or pure fabrication) that was wildly sensationalized to earn 2000 upvotes and a host of Reddit awards.
---
Why do you think I care enough about you to check your post history?
---
you must live a fragile, delicate life if they are equal to cancer in your book
---
i mean wtf??? do you even think before you type?
---
I mean...they did say that they were only going to sell cosmetics didn't they?
---
Is there a random encounter that can spawn a tamable Angler? I need one for my Riverboat-Camp :)
---
I've had a Megasloth for a long time and I really liked him. Named him Gaaaarryyyyyyy?. One day I logged in and he was gone. There wasn't even a body or something. Sad day.
---
I terms of defending: The do defend your Camp and it's fun to watch, if your enemy mobs are very low level. High level Super Mutants will kill your pet in a second, sadly.
---
I get low levels that try to buy quest items off me, no you can‚Äôt have All Rise... well you can, just not my All Rise... I only get one and as a stealth sniper with no melee perks it‚Äôs the only melee weapon that does enough damage without hindering my kit with weight to warrant keeping around. If it didn‚Äôt have that 90% reduction.. sure I‚Äôd sell it to you for 300 caps or so, but you‚Äôll be disappointed you blew your money when you get your own.
---
Same with the Voice of Set, Blade of Bastet and Eye of Ra, though I actually did sell those because none of them fit my build at all and they where just dead weight. 
---
Yes, delayed to May.....
---
It's in Flatwoods. I remember there doing the main quest or following the overseer's journey 
---
It's weird, i just dumped my 10mm because of all my gun it was the one doing the less damage. Maybe i haven't unlocked the armor piercing mod for it yet. But i have it on a .44 i think.
---
i told him he was an ass for offering so much, it makes sellers think it is ok to sell for that much
---
May could mean almost two full months from now if its at the end of may and thats if it doesn't get delayed again. 
---
I definitely don't like keeping HP low either..and I admit, I still (at level 52) don't feel able to solo a SB, so that part IS a challenge..though I've read about using CRITS more, just haven't put much thought into that angle
---
Getting a new underground area is definitely exciting! I had assumed they wouldn‚Äôt be releasing anything that wasn‚Äôt listed on the roadmap.
---
Deleting this since someone beat me to it.
---
Thanks saw we are not on same platforms so screenshots would be amazing! Thank you again!
---
Well, Unyielding is way cheaper. My full BOS set was only like 3k. PvP pieces are sometimes sold, but for like 10k+.
---
So next week we‚Äôre getting a new quest chain and a camera and...not much else?  Not gonna lie I was looking forward to finally playing new end game content but oh well 4/16 it is(hopefully)
---
Did they fix that? Because last time i tried using that piece there was nowhere on a brick wall that I could get it to place where one part was outside and one part was inside.
---
I may of been 4 minutes slow but I added in the 3 links
---
&gt; instead you are blaming the griefers for being terrible people which they are but 
---
but nothing...the point of the post was to call that out and to ask for change, which is happening apparently. 
---
To add some stuff others haven't already mentioned;
---
\&gt; Use weapons with two different types of ammo.  You don't need two different classes, like shotguns and rifles, you can stick with one class, but get two different ammo types.  If you focus on one, you'll likely use it up faster than you loot it, and crafting ammo isn't efficient until much later level with maxed-out Ammosmith perk (80% more ammo per craft).
---
\&gt; Once you get a feel for what materials you need, go to your Junk section of your pip-boy and go to Component View.  Mark the materials you keep running out of; anything that scraps to that will have a magnifying glass next to its name in loot windows.  Screws are almost certainly gonna be one you'll want to mark.  Other than the stuff you're constantly running out of, you REALLY don't need more than 150-200 of any given material, and that's being generous.
---
\&gt; Take your time and enjoy the environmental storytelling.  Actually read the notes, settle yourself into the setting.  Fallout tends to be long periods of quiet interspersed with frenzied action, by design.  You've got time to poke around.  There's no rush.  There's also a lot of disturbing and/or silly crap tucked into various crannies and on rooftops in this game; exploration is rewarded, even if mostly by finding neat stuff, rather than powerful items.
---
I'm one of those horrible people who can drink 40 espresso and can also open a coffee shop at 6:00 am while forgetting to drink coffee until 2:00 pm with ill effects either way. Now exam time...that's another story.  
---
Good suggestion though, I'll go put the pot on. Cheers.
---
Ahhh I get you. A wall outlet would be nice.
---
Yes, you could find Nuka Colas in working dispensers that would be 'ice cold'.  If I remember correctly, you could put them in a freezer yourself and get the same effect.
---
You ever hear about Rust?
---
Cant find the duster coat.Shame
---
Immersion isn't about what's real, it's about believing in the world that someone else has created. The laws of physics generally still apply to the Fallout Universe. 
---
All I want is a cat that can't be murdered, like the cat at the homestead settlement in Fallout 4. 
---
Honestly a lot of us just want FO4 with coop.  More of us than the PVP lords probably.  Which is why well probably get it as soon as Bethesda figures out their ongoing monetization is heavily dependent on camp items...and who buys those I wonder?
---
The war drum is one weapon I rarely use, and weighs quite a bit, but I just can't let it go from my stash.
---
Don't feed the Yao Guai = upvote 
---
Scratch that I just saw we don‚Äôt get the camera either until 4/16 lol
---
Wait what? Repair kit? 
---
Damn, where did you ses this?
---
I am betting money that tracking player set pricing on thousands of items in each server might cripple their database 
---
I think I have enough hate to give a little to both.
---
Cuz you are still replying to me and helping me kill time at work like a good friend
---
[Per their screenshot, May 9](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/3Ky9GnBc3vDBfcbWVlNlba/02ebacb093557b76fb99d7109594563c/Fallout76_RoadMap_1920x1080_WildAppalachia-09-EN.png)
---
I‚Äôll add that there are many of us that came late after the patches/bug fixes knowing the game‚Äôs bad reputation, fell in love with the game, and we genuinely want it to succeed and others to realize how good it is despite its fucked up launch. 
---
Because of that, people tend to help out new players and be friendly. We want more people to play, and see how fun it is. 
---
That said, if you go into Survival looking for friends you‚Äôre going to be shot in the back by a Chameleoned sniper
---
It like eso you'll also be given them from raid and dungeon conquest 
---
   
---
If you have the main receiver, you will hardly notice the damage. 
---
I just saw this, this straight up pay to win and non cosmetic. Everyone is asking for these things since release, and now they want to choke us for money. 
---
If you have the main receiver, you will hardly notice the damage.
---
I don't know how to feel about basic kits being atom shop exclusive. It's not exactly "pay to win", since the better version is available in game and repairing weaponry is already pretty managable. That being said, it goes above being a simple cosmetic, and that's not going to sit right, especially if things like the refrigerator they mentioned follow suit. It also time gates kit repairs to post game, since the example they gave for how to get advanced kits was from the SBQ, which implies that unless you use atoms, you have to get to the end of the game to get repair kits. If basic repair kits are like 100 atoms each, or 500 for a crafting plan, I can live with that, but any more and I definitely won't be pleaded with this development.  
---
Sucks that player vending got moved back, but I'd rather it release later functional than release now and be awful, so I'm not too upset. The bigger issue is obviously the repair kits.
---
&gt; I don‚Äôt want us to discourage new suggestions at all though, even if there‚Äôs 10 bad for every good, you never know what might make it into the game
---
Very true, I wasn't trying to discourage them - just seems a singular place with a list of these suggestions would clear the front page for other types of posts and be easier for Bethesda to pull ideas from. After a "dear bethesda" post drops off the front page, it's very unlikely it'll ever been seen again, whereas a stickied suggestion post would be there for people to see any time they went to it
---
now ive  read everything lol
---
EVERTHING else you are ok with in game but a floating house is too much i love it ajjajajajajajaj
---
I have been noticing this more frequently lately, and noticing that there are times where I'll travel in, do the very last part of the event, get the "Event Completed" notification and then get no loot or XP from it.  
---
I've also been *doing* Events more frequently lately, so maybe this isn't a new thing.  I can only say that I've been seeing it happen more often.
---
I paid 4K for my 3-Star Grognak. I knew damn well it wasn‚Äôt worth the 90 or so value it has for vendor trading. Getting 4K caps only takes 4 days of a quick cap run and you can accomplish it pretty quickly each day. 
---
Yup as long as you use Animal Friend and Wasteland Friend perks separately. 
---
I dont like this whole pay money for something that helps ingame. I know it won't be a pay to win thing but it's still concerning saying they want to add things that are not just cosmetic in the atomic shop. 
---
Yeah if you think fallout is bad for being attacked don't play that.
---
It's a game about shooting and killing, idk what you expected
---
Glad I've been hoarding my Atoms.
---
it sure is the noises I make in the morning.  
---
I recall that being said, yeah. 
---
As someone that usually plays games with my 9 year old daughter you have perfectly expressed some thoughts that I have been having for a while now. In both Fo76 and SoT we have run into a lot of really awesome people but we've run into far too many griefers, as well.  
---
My mistake, I must have been confusing it with another variant 
---
I think I will. I love my main, the cookie-cutter PA + Melee build. Guy is a beast, but I‚Äôd love to make a stealth sniper. 
---
It's detailed on the new 'Inside The Vault' article.
---
I have buy repair kits? Should have to buy the schematic. 
---
I'm excited for repair kits and the new dungeon. 
---
Mayby you can only get to Survival mode if you have caps on hand enough for your bounty.
---
When you run out of caps you can stay but receive 50% armor penalty, but if you leave you can't get back to survival until you have enough caps.
---
Then you can run around in survival without caps, but with the armor penalty those you attack won't have to spend ton of ammo to kill you.
---
And also since it‚Äôs literally physical caps we‚Äôre using, we should be able to drop them as a pile or put them somewhere so others can pick them up. Right now it just feels like a credit card. 
---
Only the Improved Repair Kit. The basics are only available from the Atom shop, which straight up does a 180 on the promise that Atom Shop items will be cosmetic only.
---
As much as I hate to be the guy that rains on this guy's pity parade, I'm going to stick my neck out and say I agree with you. M-rated is not for kids. As much as we want to share certain aspects of the game with them, it also asks us to be parents and decide if its appropriate to expose them to said game. Unfortunately they will have people like this in the game, which, is one of the many reasons why its rated M. I'm not saying it doesn't suck. It does.
---
Minecraft is a wonderful suggestion, though.
---
I just hope they never fix the pylons on mats/conduits on signs glitches. This helps me power my camps very efficiently. In big buildings and stores I can get away with using only about 4 pylons to power everything, wires very hidden, no generator in sight. Placement takes some planning and foresight, but it‚Äôs easily doable in most all camps. Personally I run wires through multiple rooms and ceilings a lot and am not sure how this wall connector idea would work for that. But it sounds like it would be great for simpler camps for sure 
---
 vending is pushed back till may now
---
What is a repair kit? What does it do? Is this to repair weapons and armor in the field (without a workbench)? 
---
"Oh hi level 15! You want to trade with me? That's cool, I've got some excess stims and radaways I'll give you for free! ...... Oh, you're requesting my level 50 Bloodied Explosive .50 Cal and my 3* Furious Handmade? Well sure level 15! That trade makes sense to both of us!"
---
She plays heavilly supervised and only the bits I deem safe, camp building mostly.  Sometimes she runs a public workshop.  I thought #2 as well, hasnt happened yet, my fail.  Im waiting for the same things you are, which is why the post.  Im not saying the game should be modified to suit my kid, Im saying that the behavior I saw was griefing, and perhaps these people would think before they acted a bit more if they saw that there are real people on the other side of the internet.
---
I was so excited for Player vending... now we have to wait until May? 
---
Oh they are indeed. I‚Äôve been downvoted for questioning those that claim to be getting griefed and explaining how easy it is to not flag yourself. It‚Äôs an emotional thing for them because who likes to be killed? They just don‚Äôt handle it well or think about how to avoid it going forward. 
---
Also - there are a shocking number of children playing this game. I‚Äôve run into multiple 11 year olds who would keep seeking revenge until they had no caps left. 
---
You can still repair your gear the regular way, you dont have to use the kits. So I do see this as an issue.
---
Yes. These will be added next patch.
---
One thing that is usually advised along crits is to crouch and headshot. But for SB... I downed a few with the help of the WS robots, my first one at level 45, but i won't try that only anytime soon.
---
&gt; They themselves said this is the best place to feedback, so no, don‚Äôt change anything, let people post their ideas and be voted and discussed is its own place.
---
I can agree with the spirit of this, but after 1 day their posts just fade away and no one sees them again. A stickied post would be there for anyone to see any time, it collects all of the ideas in one central place for both players and Bethesda to see. I can agree there are negatives to stickied posts as you said, but I feel there is a better chance of ideas being seen for longer than posts that just fade away after 1 day
---
forreal, a two way garage door with a keypad outside and a open switch inside doesnt look hard to make
---
I love running into kids playing this game. They are so enthusiastic and have a viewpoint I am way too jaded these days to see without their help. 
---
sometimes these posts get overlooked because they dont get enough upvotes to make front page.  Think the mods could of sent it to the front page if they wanted too and weren't snoozing at the wheel. 
---
Dear Zventibold,
---
You're welcome.
---
Sincerely.
---
That's not true. They said its cuz it makes the other bots sad.
---
oh god my ptsd is kicking in remembering trying to get those @#$@$@ fences to line up right and/or snap in FO4
---
It is low damage, but high fire rate and manageagable recoil. Lots of bullets. Fun watching the robots disintegrate as you pepper them. 
---
First off just the basic in atomic shop purchasable, the improved one is in game drop from SBQ, if you find repair kits as play to win, not sure I see a true advantage of this? If someone wants to spend free Atoms earned or bought let them, if not like everything else in this game grind the SBQ and I‚Äôm sure other future bosses for the better in game drop version of the repair kit 
---
I would almost respect that approach.  At least they gave you a chance.  Time to log out if you didnt want to participate.  These guys rolled in and leveled the place in moments.
---
i don't think so either, but it is also not the end of the game as we know it, but will be treated as such. was just identifying what the new wave of articles and youtubers are going to sound like
---
Bethesda manged to go around a month without the game being a magnet for controversy.
---
Then they decide to do this.
---
Thats the sad part, the fun of it is sharing it with others.
---
If you've only been here a week, then boy did you miss the turbulent times. The bug rage posts/quits in Dec., the tse nerf rage post/quits in Jan., the banwave rage posts/"quits"  in Feb, the bloodied/Adrenal outrage in Mar.? Honestly, I was suprised that Survival mode went live with as little "I quit" posts, as it did. And don't even start on the "FO76 FTP posts, the Boobtube reviewer slamming 76 posts, the "this sub is dying, it's already down to 180k people" posts.
---
I think the more volatile people have slowly been weeded out of the community, which has lead to this sub being what it should be. Honestly, you came in at a good time.
---
Welcome to the community.
---
i do beleive that if you have a mic, but the other guy doesnt, he can still hear you through his tv
---
Doesn‚Äôt sound like you‚Äôre a very good employee if you‚Äôre doing this at work.
---
Most people, ya know, work at work.
---
Maybe you just expect free handouts?
---
Oh, i just read it, it's sad bethesda still doesn't understand anything.
---
Im super bummed about this.
---
You just need to bring a handful of water/food and as many stimpacks as you honestly need. Same for drugs. Only carry 1 or 2 on you and hotkey them, save them for when you need them the most, but never hesitate to not use them if you have to. Most of all, if you don't want to lose your aid/junk but don't have the stash space, then stuff your extra aid/junk in a container that can hold all the stuff until you can return to it later on. Just pray that you don't dc before you return.
---
When people request one of what are clearly the 3-4 weapons I use, I shoot them.
---
Also, if I ever trade with you and you‚Äôre wearing a wedding ring, I‚Äôm requesting it.
---
oBaMa huRR DurR
---
Graphic artist at a 3 person company.  Not too busy currently lol.  
---
they already identified early may.
---
until then you can sell as we've been doing from the start. i'd much rather them delay it than give it to us half-assed or broken.
---
Yep, which is why the mods made the Bethesda pls list on the side bar, but the mods here haven‚Äôt bothered with it for a while now:(
---
I think the question should be though - SHOULD power armor be so extremely underpowered? It's literally the same as being naked right now. That doesn't seem right to me. You give up stealthiness, the ability to use stealth boys, and legendary effects. Not to mention, you literally can't use heavy weapons effectively unless you use power armor, so a whole class of weapons is useless in PvP.
---
I just don't think that a set of magical leather armor should give you god mode, while several inch thick powered steel armor that was the absolute best pre-war stuff available gets cut through like paper. 
---
Mole Miners matter!
---
SBQ was an example btw, they say "various events" so that's still a wide net. Could be End-Game only, like the queen and actual raids and stuff later, or they could pop up in other events around the map or something. We'll have to wait and see, but it doesn't necessarily mean ONLY the Queen and Raid-like situations.
---
265 days to go!
---
Same, but if it means it functions better..then I guess that's a good thing about the delay.
---
If you're going pistols, go silenced. Once you get all three levels of Sneak, you can pop off a lot of armor piercing 10mm rounds for double damage without being spotted.
---
I don't know that they're that rare?
---
Right, you can't use Unyielding in pvp is why.
---
The only thing I can understand is sometimes when they do a power attack, it sounds like they say ‚Äútake this!‚Äù 
---
I have no problem with this.  Although I can‚Äôt imagine the need to buy one.  I always carry a spare weapon.  
---
Lol k dude 
---
I‚Äôm cool with it, as long as changes to durability rates aren‚Äôt datamined as part of next week‚Äôs patch. That would not be ok
---
üòÇ
---
I was thinking this last night. 
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ Glad to have had a positive part in your day! 
---
This guy is bang on. Had a scorched beast fight the other night and had to be 10 under level 40 joined and it was literally impossible to take it down. These low level people taking part are just ruining it for everyone. They don‚Äôt even try and pitch in just hide on roofs. It‚Äôs pathetic 
---
this is bad 
---
Also an Xbox player here. Would also love to lend my assistance as a guard/friendly face in the Wasteland! 
---
Can you elaborate on this ? 
---
what gave you the impression that we were getting end game content? literally every article, interview and comment has stated that it is coming at a later time. they've been pretty explicit and direct about what content is coming and when during these next couple months.
---
Agreed, either way I have no issue with this, plus we don‚Äôt even know the cost, it could be like 10-50 atoms for all we know which is not hard to obtain a day with dailies 
---
You do exist solely for others content, in some respects. I don‚Äôt think they were trying to ruin your day and honestly knowing the game is the way it is maybe you shouldn‚Äôt have let her play it? Fallout 4 has a very similar crafting system and no one will bother you. The people who fucked yo your base aren‚Äôt bad people, they‚Äôre just playing a game. They didn‚Äôt target your kid or anything, they had no way of distinguishing her from anyone else in the game. I get your point that Bethesda should fix this but tbh this is no ones fault but your own. 
---
Source?
---
Phoenix but it's random, it switches between other high tech plans based on my visits.
---
Wow.
---
I want different styles of the workbenches. Cooking station has like 4 weapons 2 chem 2 pa 2. Armor and tinker just have 1 but they could all use some love. The red stove was ok but really the last needed because cooking station already had the most options. Varied sizes and shapes would be ideal not just different looks. I like to build tiny houses and squeezing every thing in is an artform. The tiny cook station helps. So maybe like a wall mounted weapon bench?
---
"You can use Improved Repair Kits in all the same ways as Basic Repair Kits and they are also single-use consumables. However, Improved Kits buff the selected item‚Äôs condition up to 150%, giving it an even longer lifespan against the trials of Wasteland combat.
---
Improved Repair Kits are rare items that we plan to award to you for free as you take on various types of in-game content. As an example, you will receive them as loot when you take down the Scorchbeast Queen."
---
Basic available in atom shop. Little reading comprehension goes a long way. 
---

---
If you happen to notice the cap cost to FT to the event is much higher/lower than any other nearby locatio, the event is already over, and just hasn't dropped off the map yet.
---
Pay to win lmao, You can literally get the exact same effect at any single workbench around the world without spending any atoms at all. It's literally just for people that don't like travelling all the time. There's nothing pay to win about it when you can do it for free in game with the cost of a few materials. 
---
20 year old engine limitations.
---
In order for covert operative to work you have to be in sneak mode. Without any sneak perks, and in power armor, you won't get much sneaking around done. 
---
You could try swapping it out for something like Dodgy which give you 10% damage avoidance at the cost of 30AP, and you don't seem to running VATS with this build so you should have the AP to spare. 
---
You could also use Gun runner, Modern renegade, or Adrenaline... but with only 1 point available those perks are kind of meh.
---
Or pop the point somewhere else, but otherwise I think the build looks pretty good. 
---
Actually as I was walking by Summersville Lake, I realized it would make a great Ohio River.  It has the width and just the right embankments.
---
Lol, atoms are hard to get. "Omg like tots-mgee!" Here come all the drama queens and internet Whiner Choirs.
---
Read the article. They will also be given away in game. 
---
This is straight up violation of the 'cosmetics only' promise. And of course it's an advantage. A major one at that. Repairs are a major resource hog. People invest in a bunch of perks to make repair manageable. Now if we could all craft the repair kits, that would make it fair. But this is an *actual* pay to win mechanic. This is the equivalent of buying premium currency in the game to get unlocks faster.
---
In fact, look at the wording of the post. In the same heading, they mention features such as refrigerators, ammo scrapping and transferring scrap to inventory without stashes: there's a severe possibility that *all of these could actually be purchases from the Atom shop*. This would let players who pay extra have a significantly different game-play experience: the very definition of pay to win.
---
I think a lot of the confusion comes from it reading like you are saying conduit glitches and window glitches. Hence people suggesting using the through wall power connector/advanced plans.
---
Smooth‚Ä¶
---
Lots of improvements made slowly, new game mode and quests, new stuff coming next week.
---
*throws up in mouth*
---
*swallows *
---
I dont think "fermenting" is the correct terminology here.  
---
Lying Lowe Quest "New Enemy" Sheepsquash"
---
Item Renaming
---
Vendor Faction Update, Whitesprings becoming sort of a hub
---
Turret Balance Changes
---
Those are just the main 4 bullet points. We still might get other minutu changes or quality of life improvements.
---
To be fair this new dungeon wasn‚Äôt even mentioned until PAX last weekend. I was just saying it was nice to hear that new end game stuff was almost here. Wish they would‚Äôve provided more details though rather than waiting until next week
---
They both do the same thing it's the choice of the player whether they want to spend their atoms on it I assume eventually they'll also be loot crates like eso you got to remember eso was the same way at first with free content then they changed and eso is 100 times better than it was at launch if they don't make money how do you expect free content plus atoms are basically given out for free
---
Once you hit 50 there's literally no difference except builds, weapons and armor. A pure PvP built level 50/60 is 100x more dangerous than a jack of all trades level 300
---
300+ just means you're gonna make huge bank off him when you kill him, I highly recommend looking into build/archetypes and different armor/Wep combos
---
Can't wait for the repair kit!
---
Behaving like an asshole makes you an asshole.  If you behave badly, you are bad.  You are your choices in life.  You sort of are missing the point.  I didnt ask for any handouts and have accepted none.  I will earn back what I lost.  Point is people on this game ruin it for others because they think "they are just playing a game" and their actions don't matter.  Might want to rethink that is all I am saying.  
---
That's probs why I can't find it if it was removed/ deleted, ty for clarifying it for me.
---
Tbh  I also dismissed it as bs at the time and still do in a way, it's only my fascination for mysteries that makes me look into things like that still and tbh it's people like myself he probs tried to dupe.
---
I'm also still trying to find the guidestones mentioned in the investigators shack too lol 
---
It's still sometimes hard to find high end items for caps, so caps being worthless is still a thing on console sometimes.
---
You can definitely use Unyielding in PvP. Just combine it with Cavalier's, and you can easily have over 2k damage melee with a huge percentage of damage taken negated.
---
I'm from wisconsin. I approve. But only if they also add cheese curds, which make the sqeaky sound when eaten, and you can batter and deep fry to gain enhanced benefit from ingesting.
---
Its mentioned in this mornings inside the vault
---
Say the heartless griefer 
---
Agreed. Hopefully since they just buffed heavy and energy weapon durabilities they aren't itching to nerf durability across the board, but that would be pretty scummy if they did.
---
Yeah just designed a "no parking" sign.  It's a true test of skill and painstakingly challenging.  /S
---
Where your tame creature wanders is based on where you camp module is placed in the build area.
---
I don't think you'll be able to get the Deathclaw on the second floor and for it to stay there permanently no matter how you try to place your camp module. In fact, it can lead to some nasty bugs like your tamed creature teleporting, glitching into the foundations, or just outright dying instantly. 
---
This is something I actually miss from FO4: the legendary enemies *had* the legendary item and used them. A few times I bumped into a high level gunner that tore through my health with a legendary weapon of some sort. After stimpacks and lots of hiding I would go back to make sure I took that legendary item from them! I wanted that item for me.
---
I know it's more RNG now and it has to be... but I do miss that.
---
Agreed
---
This only happens to me when i fast travel half over the Map? Probably a intended mechanic dunno
---
Ayup.  I don't know how I feel about the situation (won't bother forming a full opinion until I see the implementation), but this is exactly the kind of PR blunder that Bethesda does NOT want to make right now.  No matter how trivial the situation is (or not), the haters will immediately glom onto this as another indication that they're going back on their word and turning into a P2W game.
---
No matter how I feel about it once it's in (and I have some serious concerns), this is a horrible, horrible idea and I cannot imagine it ending well at all.
---
In my experience it was always you either got one shot or you were a god in pvp, and the only way to be a god was full assn + cav or assn + sent.
---
We need more conduits, and there should be a wall-pass variant, of the wall power conduits, not the ones that have a top and bottom connector, the one that glows green when it's powered.  But there should also be a double-wall pass variant of the power conduit that has those top and bottom connectors.
---
It is a bummer but I‚Äôd rather them take more time to refine it instead of rushing it out 
---
How do to the lower level players effect the fight?
---
The conduits work fine without glitches. The pass through goes through the wall quite easy, and by using a 'single up' nipple attached to a 'single down' nipple you can pass through floors and ceilings as well. Pretty sure they're meant to function that way.
---
I got nothing, man.
---
Nothing I could say at this point could possibly be any harsher than the hand life has already dealt you.
---
Good luck, dude.
---
&gt;pitch in
---
that's the problem, if they did  pitch in you would have killed it..
---
My low level alt (lv71) was in here first SBQ fight yesterday, SBQ dide, lol
---
She has a Furious Gatling plasma, and after they fixed the energy weapons, they really shine :)
---
My defenses are usually busy playing pocket tennis while monsters destroy my camp  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_\/¬Ø 
---
It isnt the fact that power armor doesnt match up to standard. The high resists of power armor should balance with the more versatile legendary standard armor. 
---
But the thing is none of that really matters when I can get 90% armor penetration on my mellee attacks without hardly trying. And that's for both armor types. 
---
Besides, that super awesome "invincible" armor that everyone is afraid of is completly negated by using crit attacks. One of my favorite things is just to walk up to those jackasses jumping up and down and do a simple crit slice (which tracks their stupid hopping). Puts them down in o e shot like 90% of the time. The other 10% just requires another quick shot and they are just as dead. 
---
Think my worst fight had 18mins left and about 30% life left when 7 guys under 30 showed up and went hiding. Failed with about 3% health
---
Are you kidding me? Have you seen how much certain items cost to repair? The Decon Arch costs ONE of EACH type of flux to repair. Or $5, maybe, if Bethesda has their way. So I get to do several Nuke zones (taking hours) to repair my item, while another person uses the magic of a credit card and does it in 5 seconds. That is *the definition* of pay to win. The Unstoppables event? That was 'lmao' material. This isn't.
---
Dude, I'm not even defending their argument. I was making a point against it...
---
BoS jumpsuit - is that the orange / grey one? I can make those. BoS Soldier suit I think it's called, and I can craft the highest tier of lining for it too.
---
Starts with: ‚ÄúI'm guessing I'll get downvoted to oblivion for this post.‚Äú
---
Gets love and compassion instead.
---
Fallout community in a nutshell :)
---
They will also drop for free. Pretty sure the basics are targeting newbies that don't know how to play 
---
I think you missed the point. Decisions made in video games, even online ones, do not reflect the personalities and moral codes of the people involved. Also they aren‚Äôt trying to ruin your game, they‚Äôre trying to make theirs more fun. You‚Äôre a couple of seconds in a massive game for most people. Don‚Äôt be so self absorbed. Also it‚Äôs a video game their actions don‚Äôt matter in the slightest. 
---
Repair things? Did I miss something?
---
Meanwhile this is also a huge crutch never could find anyone to play with and was to nervous to keep my mic on to meet people only ever got to around level15 
---
Irradiated :) small difference but big meaning haha 
---
Or the game should just give you the caps for the kill regardless, up to 5 kills, then it stops.
---

West Virginia, specifically point pleasant, has a lot of history with ufos and the ‚Äúmen in black‚Äù I think it‚Äôs just fun Easter egg that goes along with the mothman. That town has a lot of legends and stories about things like that. 
---
it might have been intentional, but no patch notes brought it up, and noone from Bethesda has addressed it...
---
if they want to come out and say, "yeah, we adjusted the spoil rate because of ....reasons...."  then i would understand it was a conscious decision on their part, and so be it..
---
but as it stands now we are not sure if it was a bug introduced in a patch or it was on purpose
---
I think the point is that Bethesda originally promised that the Atom shop would be strictly for cosmetic items.  This is going directly against that as it is an item that directly effects gameplay.  Sure this item itself is not very significant but it is setting a precedent for adding other, potentially much more important, items to the Atom shop. 
---
Putting ‚ÄúUtility‚Äù abilities like this as they put it, behind real money is a HUGE issue. They say they want feedback so let‚Äôs give it to them. 
---
Honestly I‚Äôm not mad if they want to give the Atom shop as an option. But if real money is the only way, then we have an issue. 
---
God damn it, I was hyped for player vending.
---
The new quest definitely looks fun
---
Pay-to-win mechanics are not okay. It's only a little P2W is no defense. The moment you have real money for an in-game effect, particularly a consumable effect, you've jumped the shark. I think I'm done defending this game. 
---
I have been doing the same want to meet and trade?
---
No issue with this since the improved repair kit from quests/events. Also, seems a bit useless once you get past a certain level and have Weapon Artisan 3.
---
I don't care about semantics or silly arguments about how little or big of an advantage armor kits are. They're the first clear and permanent P2W-element introduced in the game. Earn-able or not, they *sold for real money* ‚Äî not to mention a complete 180 on Pete Hines' assurances regarding the Atomic Shop: \[[1](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-has-microtransactions-but-bethesda-insi/1100-6462850/)\], \[[2](https://www.vgr.com/fallout-76-microtransactions-hines/)\], \[[3](https://www.pcgamer.com/fallout-76-microtransactions/)\].
---
It's a cliche to say, but this is the definition of a slippery slop. 100% they're testing the waters here. I urge Bethesda not to go through with adding them into the Atomic Shop.
---
&gt;**Basic Repair Kits in the Atomic Shop**  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;We  read tons of feedback and suggestions from the Fallout 76 community, and  Repair Kits were a popular request that we wanted to get into players‚Äô  hands. We also felt we could try out something new with these, both  in-game and in the Atomic Shop. As we look to the future, we‚Äôre  exploring ways we can bring other community-driven ideas to the game as  well, such as refrigerators for C.A.M.P.s, ammo and food converters, and  even the ability to send scrap to your stash without having to head  home. Repair Kits are our first attempt at a utility item like this, and  we plan to make adjustments based on your feedback, so we hope you‚Äôll  share your thoughts with us when they go live later this month. \[[4](https://bethesda.net/en/article/6eQmVlhbjlkX0GzGb7DB3j/inside-the-vault-looking-beyond-patch-8-april-4-2019)\]
---
Not to mention the audacity in phrasing it like this is what the community has been asking for ‚Äî yikes!
---
I'd like to know more what Bethesda means by repair kits and the Atom shop; also the refrigerators being in the Atom shop section because it sounds like pay to win. 
---
Yes it has been rough.  After serving 13 years in the military I have finally encountered the worst part of my life.  Chatting non Reddit while designing parking signs :(  at least I have fallout to look forward to :( 
---
DO you realize the difference in experience here? I do a nuke launch, spends 100's of ammo, break my weapons and armor to take out the Queen, costing me several hours, while another person just buys the thing and does not get the +50% condition, while saving on ammo and other resources.
---
Yup if I even seen half of them shooting at it I would‚Äôve felt better about wasting my ammo but I just left cause it was a waste of time. ALL YOU PLAYERS WHO DONT SHOOT AT THE QUEEN PLEASE JUST DO SOMETHING!!! Lol all we ask 
---
&gt;radiated
---
No, I meant radiated like spreading out from a central location. Thanks Grammar Nazi
---
^(no you're right, edited and fixed lol)
---
Didnt want or expect the upvotes or awards.  Might want to consider that perhaps there is a reason the story resonated with so many people.  You are bound and determined to not believe me, which honestly is fine.  But just to be clear, I generally play the game myself.  When I handed her the controller I did own a workshop, but didnt think anything of it.  Didnt know there was a exploit these guys use to pull you into PVP anywhere.  The kid insisted she was in pacifist the whole time, but honestly, I didnt see how this could happen without her switching.  Doesnt matter though.  Believe it or not, read the tons of stories of others which have had similar experiences.  Point has been made.   I could give a shit about Reddit points.
---
Yes I think that makes sense. One time I got to the battle late, even though I‚Äôm sure my shots contributed to her death it was pretty minuscule compared to the overall scale of her hp, I didn‚Äôt get anything. Another time I joined after she mutated, I got a bunch of plans and the fluxes but no weapon or armor. 
---
Yeah, ain‚Äôt no way I‚Äôm swapping out characters mid trade and giving him time to take the money and run. 
---
Thats the underarmor. the BOS Jumpsuit is a cosmetic clothing
---
There are plenty of people like you out here across all the platforms.  I figure there are more of us than them, (the ruin everybody's day 'cause I can crowd) and all the positive replies to your daughter's experience makes me very, very proud to be part of the FO 76 community 
---
Well, the total cash supply increase is never going to exceed 1400 caps per day per player, regardless of how it‚Äôs distributed. 
---
They promised cosmetic only, this is not cosmetic. Simple as that.
---
Also, do you really think this will be the only non cosmetic things they will add if they get away with it? This game had a horrible launch, the least thing they could do is to stick with there promises like the fast sticked with there game.
---
But you're literally being given the improved ones for free from events, it's the basic ones they're adding to the store which for whatever reason, I cannot understand. Also decon showers are freely available in the world too. Almost everything you can place in your camp is also in the world. It's not the same thing. If anything, it's pay for convenience at a stretch. That's it. 
---
What legendary tokens?
---
Regardless, it's a violation of their "cosmetics only" statement.
---
We can make a fusion generator out of junk, but we can't put wiring in the walls and the toilets don't lead anywhere.  
---
It's pretty sad I have to heat my house with a burning barrel and throw my spoiled food on the floor because the only refrigerators that work are in houses that haven't been occupied in decades, and presumably have no power given how often the power plants break down despite receiving regular maintenance.
---
But it doesn't offer a significant advantage to anyone above level 10. This seems like something targeted to new players. Which is 100% fine with me. 
---
And they expect us to believe it‚Äôs because the robots are upset? I‚Äôm not buyin‚Äô it. üòÇ
---
No, but they will be available for purchase at the Atomic Shop/s
---
You, Sir, are a real camp-connoisseur.
---
I'd rather things but not broken and on time. I guess thats too much to expect these days. 
---
Yeah it does, i hope the mask/helmet is drop by the cryptid beast
---
Player vending, meh. But repair kits plus every vendor going to whitesprings? i say it's a-ok.
---
I'm cautiously optimistic.
---
If the advanced repair kits drop in game, that seems like an acceptable feature. It's kind of a convenience thing / for people who don't want to bother with camps and materials at all.
---
However if they suddenly nerf item durability that's a line being crossed.
---
Agreed.  They blundered.  Its just sad to me cause 76 is a absolutely fantastic coop experience.  Their mechanics just let a minority of vocal griefers ruin that.
---
Quote: Thye're just playing the game. It's not their fault. They're doing what they enjoy.
---
You are enabling griefers. Sort of aiding and abetting after the fact. You have chosen an unsupportable vector. Stop while you are behind. 
---
I need a trumpet. Give us a trumpet, so I can stick it on top of house as I play my trumpet tune. I have to use a tuba at the moment, but a trumpet would be more suiting.
---
I mean, I guess that is what would happen after the bombs hit haha! 
---
This man is going places 
---
Griefing is poor adulting.  I guess we are both entitled to our opinions.
---
I mean, I would be pissed too if someone put a giant light near my home that was binding me. We are the bad guys in this scenario.
---
Everyone upvote the crap out of this thread. This is a dick move by Bethesda. Many other devs have tried this stuff before and it's proven many times that a strong and robust community response can get them to back down.
---
And before anyone says "it's only repair kits" think about what this could mean for the future.
---
Every time i trade. They request all my maps.. and my equipped gear. 
---
The exact same i need better gear help me out! Then why are you askin for my maps? Cmon bro.. 
---
I hope they don‚Äôt increase the cost of repairing items in the hopes of getting people to buy these kits
---
CAREFUL!!! I talked about the ATOM shop being on the edge of abuse, but it got downvoted into oblivion- people said stuff like "THEN HOW IS BETHESDA SUPPOSED TO PAY FOR OUR FREE DLC?!?!?!!:?"
---
really made me cry for the future of gaming, we, the consumers, lived through Bethesda's debacle of "HORSE ARMOR"- rememebr htat?
---
now people are ok with loot boxes and pay to win mechanics on most games...
---
it used to be gamers would rise up to fight these types of shady practices
---
now it seems its just part of gaming nowadays to get shekeled like this, and in a full priced AAA game nonetheless!
---
I love this game and FO universe, and want this game to survive,  but good on you for posting this, i hope other people feel the same apprehension about this
---
That's exactly what I was thinking.
---
did somewhat similar at level 80 odds. I too did no damage whatsoever,and the best i've got is a armour piercing gauss.there was another 8/10 other players.
---
point being - there is always a first time for everyone,you kind of need to know what to expect - how bad is this ?  granted - no place for low levels, but need find out for oneself.
---
TOTAL FECKING INSANITY.
---
PS  2nd time in - only me - never even saw the queen - and got my ass handed to me on a plate,,,,,,, and all my loot is still out there somewhere.
---
It was their goal to make someone feel like shit.  Might be part of the game, but they are still jerks.
---
I would buy a "Permanent Repair Kit" but not consumables.  
---
I don't find the "Repair Kits" p2w as they don't offer any real advantage more like a QoL thing for those who want to pay for it.  
---
I am concerned though about future QoL requests/features for the game, they need to get onto these things and they need to be free, like "Item locking" or "Perk Management" or "Perk Cards QoL changes", etc.  
---
i love the idea but yeah single use kits for atoms seems a bit too much unless its VERY cheap.  Though there are plenty of options to avoid it so its not too bad... yet.  
---
That said I don't mind paying for that ammo converter (or break down ammo to parts?) but not if its a single use item.  A new workbench maybe but if its a use and lose? Not a chance in hell.  Similar to a fridge or food converter (canning station?) 
---
Yea its hard to tell, the wording on acquiring the Basic Repair Kits is interesting. It says Basic Repair Kits will be *unlockable* in the Atom Shop. That makes it sound like a plan you learn via atoms then you get materials to craft it in game at a workbench or something. If it was a direct consumable to buy I *hope* they would word it differently. Im ok with the plans to make them only being available through the atom shop seeing as you can get atoms just by playing. So long as its not an absurd amount of atoms that is.
---
If you‚Äôd keep me in mind I‚Äôd love to buy those off of you when you‚Äôre done with them. 
---
Neither of those scenarios sounds fun. Sounds like TTK is way too high in some circumstances, and people are gods in other, and neither one sounds like a good pvp experience. BGS has a lot of work to do if they want survival mode to be fun. Feels like a coin flip right now.
---
They really need to buff ‚ÄòAssassins‚Äô, as well as other legendary like Nocturnal etc. 10% additional damage is a joke. Far less useful than bloodied or anti-armor or even TS. People dump them at vendor bots all the time. 
---
That will teach me for building a shop this morning for the incoming vending machines lmao üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
To clarify, the only item they're considering making for the Atom Shop is a basic repair kit that repairs an item to 100%. They are also adding an advanced kit that is NOT in the Atom Shop that repairs to 150% that can be obtained from events like SBQ. Weapon repairing is already pretty managable, so it's more of a convenience than straight pay to win. Let's not lose our shit over this yet.  
---
That being said, if this is a prelude to them doing this for future convenience items like the refrigerator, or if they nerf weapon conditions to encourage kit usage, then we should press the devs and tell them that this isn't acceptable. For now though let's wait and see what these look like when implemented.
---
The fastest, best, place to get screws is abandoned bog town. The office directly left of the workshop bench primarily. Head to the roof and drop down the elevator shaft. This room contains 16-21 screws in it. Plus it respawns everything in the room hourly. It‚Äôs an endless screw farm. There are also more screws scattered around the town but this building is a gold mine.  Claim the workshop and keep coming back every so often. 
---
From their wording I don't think these will repair decon arches or camp stuff.
---
Reminds me of my step dad, the grump ass. Only difference is the moles don't say fuck every other word.
---
I was thinking with the 30% added  range to my pistols, I would only sneak at range. If I am any closer, that's when the sledge comes out.
---
I also recommend checking out the fallout 76 filthy casuals reddit, it‚Äôs a lot more friendly there 
---
I miss this too, but I can see why they removed it from a gameplay perspective.
---
This is a model which works.   As it is we have half ass broken PVP and half ass broken Coop.
---
Not that I think atoms for repair kits is a good idea, but the article states they are for gear.  So weapons and armor not camp items. 
---
Whilst I am totally against non cosmetics for atoms, this isn't really the best example. Your decontamination arch helps you 'win'? Lol?
---
DeAr BeThEsDa
---
very simple, every extra player makes here harder to kill, and that is how it should be, but those players need to do something and not hide to get the main event award....
---
You understand my frustration but dont see the point of the post.  OK.
---
Haha, well at least you're well-prepared. It also gives you much time for any improvements you may be able to make in between now and then. 
---
This isn‚Äôt a damage or armor stat buff, not an OP weapon. Just a repair item that is basic while a better one is available in game, they haven‚Äôt even given more details , this may only be useable ion adventure mode and not survival so let‚Äôs wait for some more details  
---
It's exactly like "pay to win".
---
Yes you can get "better" versions from limited events, but simply paying real cash you can now skip costly armor repair and ballistic fiber hunting and that is a big change.
---
Also if they are similarly used in Survival mode then it's even more of a big problem. 
---
If they decide to sell plans in Atom shop, then it's ok, as everyone can then make them without real cash giving all the same option. 
---
But if they are Atom shop exclusive to get, then that is not going to be ok. Yes, you can grind Atoms in game, but  dailies give you 50/day and weeklies 200/week only. That's 2100 per month. 
---
At the cost rating of current items in Atom shop they can be anything from 100-250 each. I'm more leaning on possibility of 250 each and 1000/five.
---
Ah! I didn't even think about speed demon! Thanks!
---
Yep, sometime in the magical and fluid date of spring. I didn't see it in the update about next week. I'd be overjoyed if it is though.
---
no, what you‚Äôre talking about are the underarmors but the jumpsuits are comsetic items that go over your armor. the model is the same as the mechanic jumpsuit that you can sometimes see around but the rare ones look a lot nicer and you can *only* get them as event rewards in specific regions, the change of getting the BoS jumpsuit is like 0.25% or so and they cant be crafted
---
I know you're joking, but if they actually did this I'd delete every BGS game on my PC, even my ultra modded FO4 loadout, and boycott all future BGS titles. I've put up with a lot of shit from Bethesda with 76, but at least they didn't go pay to win. If they did that... every previous player outrage would pale in comparison to the fury they would see from their player base.
---
YES. 
---
I never had a problem, with any of the walls.  Although Brick is the harder one.  I have more of an issue getting it "straight".  Its doable though.  Not even hard really, just....fiddly....
---
Assassin's will only remove about an extra 14%, so an extra 15 STR for melee might be better to some who use melee.
---
u/ladydevann
---
Can we still expect item displays or are those being moved back as well?
---
Congrats! Me and a friend did the meditation one a few times but that guys voice will drive you nuts.
---
I agree.  I can call them out for being pricks though.  Thats all this is.  And a plea for Bethesda to fix the mechanics.
---
Super gutted, damn! üò™
---
This is how it starts, I‚Äôve come from games that started with a ‚Äúno unfair advantages‚Äù mentality and slowly moved into ‚Äúliterally buy XP‚Äù
---
And there‚Äôs always two groups of players:
---
- the ones who realize what could happen and overreact 
---
- the ones who are like ‚Äúit isn‚Äôt that bad‚Äù or ‚Äújust don‚Äôt buy it lol‚Äù and let it continue
---
Hope Beth realizes what they‚Äôre doing here, I can already hear the cancer yters typing up their clickbait..
---
If the Atom shop is even an option, you'll have to ask, did the dungeon lack benches to ensure that players had to pay real money to get through the dungeon? Did item durability get a nerf (or stealth nerf) to increase revenue? Every durability change will be a battle between designers and accountants. No. It cannot be in the Atom shop. 
---
meh. probably the most lackluster ItV to date. not really complaining, just saying.
---
the prospect of the repair kits is a good idea, but it is concerning to see them in the atom shop, especially from launch. i guess pricing will be the ultimate factor. if they are charging 500 atoms/kit, im cool with that. it just cant be to the point where you're spending only your daily challenges' worth in atoms to virtually never have to repair your gear. would prefer that they would just make them in game items, but i don't think it is something to hit the streets in protest of just yet..
---
dope to get some new info about the underground area, teaser is always nice.
---
still not sure what the point of the camera is. it looks like so you're able to take pics without having to go to the full interface? maybe just aiming down sights? still kind of redundant and unnecessary imo, but whatever.
---
and to top it off, a delay in a much anticipated feature. im happy they are delaying in order to make sure it works properly, though I'd appreciate some transparency on what is going on; what's not working?
---
some nice little tidbits, but mostly meh.
---
Yes! I'm sure the molerats are the master mind behind this, that shit eater planning something
---
Okay smartie pants, which one is it? 
---
I can blame them.  I just did. (shrug)
---
Okay one item in massive demand in a post apocalyptic world, when faced with a twenty foot salivating starving hungry Reptilian Chameleon with razor sharp claws. Is a clean pair of trousers, and soft, strong TOILET ROLL, perfect when faced with life's unexpected surprises.....Of course the price will be 2 Caps. 
---
Mole miners are like French. Just add them a yellow vest.
---
Yup, no problem :)
---
Yes! I'm sure the molerats are the master mind behind this, that shiteater planning something
---
Awesome thanks man!
---
Absolutely, extra time for tinkering is no bad thing lol
---
Several hours to find screws aluminum and adhesive just to repair an item?
---
To the people saying "it's a PVP game people should be able to raid" or "the game incentivizes this"; destroying a base isn't raiding and there is no incentivisation to do it. Raiding is taking supplies by force. Destroying a base does nothing for you. You don't get experience or supplies or anything out of it other then schadenfreude. Harvesting someone's Crops and taking things out of their resource gatherers would be, but just running around with a group of high-level assholes and destroying someone's CAMP is not raiding. It's just being a dick. If the game actually rewarded you for doing it that would be one thing, but it doesn't. So don't pretend that you being a dick is anything more than you wanting to be a dick.
---
I built a kind-of floating base. The only damage it has taken is from griefers. My garden, artillery, and water purifiers, however, are different stories. I am on xbone if you want to visit. Same gt as my u/. 
---
Never managed to get that working myself.  Too ....fiddly.  But I like the idea, I may have to try that next build I do.  Have to be...very precise...placing them.
---
Or they fucked it up and are making it the same but at a later date
---
There is a youtube video about this very idea, he also used the conduits as railing. You can also attact any ceiling lights to the conduits and even some wall mounted ones
---
They forgot what?
---
They do this, they can put a fork in the game. 
---
You can get the advanced repair kits in game for free. Only the basic ones are in the atom shop. Why is that bad? 
---
Huh. I can't believe they actually acknowledged the fact that the Repair Kits could be considered P2W and pretty much gave us a heads up for feedback.
---
In the long run, it could be considered a little P2W since it directly affects gameplay, but you can't trade or sell it for caps and it's outclassed by the seemingly-more-available Improved Repair Kit.
---
I wonder how much would the cost be for one. I myself wouldn't buy it and just stick to getting them for free, but just wondering.
---
Yeah very annoying, without any perk food spoils in less than 10 minutes, that's ridiculously fast. Sometimes i go and gather plants to make alcohol and by the time i finish gathering all the resources some of them are spoiled, wtf.
---
The part of this that grinds my gears the most is that the kits won't be sellable or tradeable. Due to my perks and play style, I almost never need to repair my gear. These are worthless to me. Let me sell them to other players that need them more. I get why they won't let you sell them if they are atom store exclusives. But if they drop in the world too, then let me sell them. Otherwise they just take up space in my stash or I have to throw them away which is a waste for an item that dropped off the queen and took the place of some more valuable loot item.
---
It says gear and CAMP item. Read it again.
---
Thanks, sounds a lot more my speed than here.
---
Actually...yea.  Take the same code that you have on conduit points...but alter the textures to "wall outlets".  Now we have walls with outlets.  And wires running into them.  That would be cool.
---
Can you repair your gear midway through a dungeon without a kit? What if there are no benches there? How long will the dungeons be? What it item durability gets nerfed or a new creature gets introduced that does special item damage? If the accountants want you to buy repair kits, they can make you do it. 
---
Oh it is, I absolutely love it there, and it‚Äôs real easy to find friends to play with 
---
Thanks for the write up, and have to say this def sounds fun. I just sold (vendor trashed) a Berserker fatman the other day. Now I'm curious as to how this would perform with this build (would have easily donated it to the cause!)
---
Totally agreed. 
---
Even if you can't see it you are doing DMG as long as you fire on here :)
---
Balanced response. The simple answer is never to buy the repair kits. They sound pretty useless to me anyway. Why would I want to waste a repair only going to 100% when I can do it myself and get 200% for a negligible amount of mats. 
---
Thanks, I am still to low level. I still run away when confronted by scorched beasts.  3 appeared over white springs train station I ran to white springs hoping the sentry bots and assaultron guards would do the heavy lifting. Took one down. 
---
This is a classic if you give a mouse a cookie type situation from what I've experienced.  Somebody shows up wants to trade if you give them a few things for free that don't mean much to you like excess junk or some stims or chems then suddenly they think they can have anything for free or dirt cheap.  Again if I have some spare stuff or you really want to team up and have me help you and it is reciprocal (as much as a low level can help a high level player) then I have no problems.  Also I agree that it is absolutely silly to hoard items that are way above your level.  I think the pricing you are talking about of like 5K is pretty reasonable and I would likel pay it as I almost always collect 1200 caps a day or more from trading at vendors so I mean what is a few days of caps traded for a daily heavy use weapon.  But at a lower level you may have other needs to spend caps on. I don't really have an answer to any of this just agree with you that it can be frustrating.
---
So sorry you and your daughter went through that!!!  Screw them all
---
I've never bought atoms but have various camp items skins and icons. Not a big deal. Not pay to win. Pay for convenience. That's the main draw for microtransactions.
---
You can earn better ones in game, do without them, or earn free atoms to buy them. We don't even know if they'll be a paid consumable or if you'll be buying a repair kit generator that is a one time purchase. I'll start getting upset when they start selling something like tokens to buy legendary weapons or XP bonuses. That would be pay to win. This isn't.
---
"your a couple of seconds in a massive game for most people"...and Im self absorbed?  You are entitled to your opinion, but mine is if you act like an asshole in a game, you are a asshole.  full stop.
---
Again, this in itself is not necessarily significant but it breaks the promise bethesda originally made to keep the shop strictly cosmetic and not sell items on it that effect gameplay.
---
Doing this proves they are willing to go against their word and they are now MUCH more likely to add other more significant items to the Atom shop.
---
Today its just a basic repair kit but the next addition could be weapon or armor mods or even bulk scrap items or other things of that nature.  They could also start selling consumable buff items that would give paying players an advantage over those who do not pay for atoms.
---
Its the principle of the idea, not the significance of this item specifically.
---
It's a slippery slope but repair kits are only convenience altering items. Not quite pay to win yet, but this is indeed a bad sign. 
---
Pretty ballsy of Beth to include a pretty obvious Pay-to-win item in the atomic in the same FtV they announce they are pushing player vending back a month. It's almost like they want to make their loyal playerbase salty.
---
Yea, it can be a pain in the ass to finally take down a target and be rewarded with jack shit. When I go into Survival Mode I never carry that much on me, but I always have caps to lose.
---
Maybe if we paid caps to enter survival mode, which is what goes to someone when they kill you. If you want to stay in survival mode after you die to another player you have to pay more caps to respawn so you can't cheese another player out of the reward, or go back to adventure mode. If you don't die to another player and leave survival mode you get those caps back. 
---
Seems simple enough. 
---
Seriously. Seeing one of the devs say he spends all his caps to then lose nothing in survival mode makes it look like a conscious decision on their part to allow this sort of strategy of going into survival mode with nothing to lose. It's utterly annoying.
---
Totally agree with you here.
---
I want to be able to paint my handmade so I don‚Äôt accidentally drop one (again)
---
 The advanced kits are reward/drop only. Read before you freak
---
How about a power "condenser".  We have power radiators, which take regular conduit and apply power to "structure" elements.  Lets reverse it.  Say you have powered structure elements (regular wire connector on the outside). Inside you can place a "condenser" which would accept power from the structure and give you a connector point you can then attach wire to.  That would mean no need to run wire through the walls, just leave all the wiring external and use condensers to get wired power inside, if needed.
---
We did ask for repair kits..
---
Just not buyable ones from the atom shop, more like rewards for challenges or hard fights.
---
Bethesda is testing the waters for what they can get away with and a lot of people here are actually supporting them. They must not have played any mmo or mmo-like games before..
---
That's why I said if it functions better. Obviously it is broken or incomplete. No other reason to delay it lol
---
It should be interesting, because I actually cut out all stimulants, pre-workout, black tea and soda included.  The most caffeine I get is from chocolate.
---
Honestly, I did not take into account the collection of dropped loot when I suggested this. In retrospect, I can definitely see how this mechanic would certainly complicate that particular aspect of gameplay. Hunting down the flying corpse to check loot would more than likely be extremely difficult if not impossible (assuming it would de-spawn at a quicker rate than usual). 
---
Then again, the player would also accept this risk when choosing to use this particular weapon. If I were farming Legendaries, I would probably not use this Bat (at least not in an open air setting). 
---
I still think this effect is viable in FO76, and would add a bit of additional fun to the mix. 
---
Because you don't have to pay real money. Atoms can be earned in game OR bought with money.
---
An AI based universal voice translator. While my Chinese friend can speak some English, we still have to resort to emails to get some things across to each  other.
---
Durn it. I'm an idiot. 
---
Exactly,  I wish I could build inna more frequented location,  but the cost of repairs is too much for me to risk it. 
---
Guess I'll go back to doing that event.
---
Repair kits aren't a pay to win type thing. Pay for convenience. Welcome to the world of microtransactions. Chill out.
---
Yep, that seems reasonable.  I'd even be fine with 95%  But It does seem pretty useless if it cant even be used very often.
---
Same thing on PC for me, using Discord only now.  It's working for some in my clan, but we haven't parsed out the difference.
---
Wish I could display all the tire irons and rolling pins I got from her majesty 
---
It is worth noting that they mention "unlockable". It makes me wonder how these will be implemented.  Unlockable, to me, sounds like a one-time cost...so maybe the kit is never consumed? Or, they only drop in-game if you've unlocked them perhaps? What are people's thoughts on this wording?
---
People use 6-8 perks to reduce repair costs. These repair kits eliminate the need for those perks, which will severely affect your build. This is not a slope, it's a downright gorge.
---
Kill vertibird, repair, kill vertibird, repair...
---
It's a coop mindset.  You see the see the same sort of thing in warframe or other non adversarial games.  While fo76 also has pvp, it's a pretty small number of folks and they are mostly just griefers.  Which hammers home the mindset pvp is for a-holes in this title, hell thr holotapes even paint pvp badly.
---
Don‚Äôt buy them then.
---
They're still selling the regular ones which still are not cosmetic and breaking their policy. I've been pretty supportive of this game since the start but this is the first one that I'll jump on the mob bandwagon and hope people raise a fuss about. Microtransactions that help you play the game easier ruin games. Watch as game design starts going grindy to convince you to buy short cuts. 
---
I don‚Äôt care if they charge atoms for repair kits, I will probably rarely use them anyway. I‚Äôm more bummed we gotta wait an extra month for player vending, I was getting stoked to see what people would be building to accommodate.
---
Thanks. I'll go sit in a corner. 
---
üòÜ
---
Well shit I stand corrected.   And agree bad idea.  We should just be able to craft these.
---
If you're doing all of that, breaking half your weapons in the process, solely to earn something to repair one of those weapons slightly... I question your logic massively.
---
I understand and agree with your point that atom shop should only be cosmetic. You're damaging that point by going off topic and making it sound like that's the reason you'd do a silo and SBQ run.
---
never bought atoms, and have almost 5000 atoms and already bought alot of things with atoms, so not really a pay-to-win imo, being able to repair a weapon aint going to help me win anything
---
It is a first step 
---
True; but when you‚Äôre in a PVP fight, and you notice the other guys gun breaks, you head in for the kill only for him to auto-repair and you just got pay-to-win killed. 
---
So; you think, why not it‚Äôs only a few bucks. And then the entire game shifts towards that mechanic, and it is ruined. 
---
Either add this as a outright feature, or don‚Äôt. 
---
Surprisingly similar process actually....on a micro level.  Bacteria/fungus consumes &lt;base substance&gt; and leaves behind &lt;desired result&gt; as a byproduct.  
---
Yes its more complicated than that IRL, but in game terms...there wouldn't be a tremendous difference between aging cheese(milk) and aging liquor.
---
Once had a level 11 request a nuclear key card. I thought to myself, what are you gonna do with that?
---
Bye
---
I can already hear all the youtubers making videos about this
---
That 14% is worth a lot more than 14% though right? Because we're talking the difference between say 85% DR and 99% DR. DR is a strange thing - the higher it gets, the more it's worth. The difference from 98% to 99% is the same as the difference between 0 to 50%.
---
Yeah people have been super quiet layely
---
People use 6-8 perks to reduce repair costs. These repair kits eliminate the need for those perks, which will severely affect your build.
---
Also, they say that "Basic Repair Kits are single-use consumables that immediately restore one of the items in your inventory to 100% condition" and "Basic Repair Kits will be unlockable in the Atomic Shop using Atoms you‚Äôve purchased or those you‚Äôve earned for free by completing in-game challenges", clearly indicating that repair kits are going to be sold per piece in the store. In fact, I'd say having them sell a repair kit generator is probably even worse.
---
Thanks, did not know that.
---
It's rare that I have a weapon break in the field, so repair kits aren't especially exciting to me, but adding them to the Atom Shop is a huge slap in the face after all this time telling us that Atom Shop items would be purely cosmetic. 
---
I would urge you to reconsider this decision, or at the very least add them them to the loot tables in-game so that people who don't want to spend their atoms on kits have a way of farming them. They don't need to be super common, but adding them to the loot table for cryptids (or as a reward for completing events) would go a long way towards stemming the outrage you're likely to encounter over this decision.
---
I use level one locks in areas with a lot of hostile mob activity, I used to be parked on top a Rad Toad spawn in the Mire. Hated those buggers avoiding my turrets by hiding in my house, so I locked the doors. 
---
Other than that, I always keep them unlocked, because as was already said... I spent a lot of time making it look good, and if you really want to break it a lock isn‚Äôt going to stop you... and you can‚Äôt steal anything except my extractor, crops and water... oh no infinitely generating materials! 
---
Agreed. 
---
Bethesda is just trying the gauge are reaction to breaking one of their promises in a small way.
---
It started with HP bonus in March, now it‚Äôs repair kits, next is what? Cap drops? Junk drops?
---
So many in this community are *actually* **Defending** Bethesda, I‚Äôve seen so many games go from ‚Äúno buyable advantages‚Äù to ‚Äúliterally buy your xp‚Äù because of people like that
---
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a small change lol‚Äù ‚Äújust don‚Äôt buy it lol‚Äù these players need to stop, and so does Bethesda. 
---
Microtransactions are not required, it's up to the individual to buy them or not. Also, atoms can be earned in game OR bought. I agree Repair kits should be decently cheap, and be available in game as rewards.
---
So you are okay with making F76 pay to win and with Bethesda breaking their word on the atom shop?
---
They originally promised that the atom shop would be cosmetic items only and that they would never sell an item that effected gameplay.  Doing this sets a precedent that would allow them to offer more gameplay items on the store and eventually turn it into a pay to win mess.
---
It‚Äôs bad in the sense that if this slides by, it‚Äôll only lead to having other tjibgs being added, slowly making it p2w, and at the games announcement the atom shop was said to be purley cosmetic. Lunch box like loot crates have already been found in the code of the game, which caused anger to a degree and a lot of attention and nothing has been said on them and it‚Äôs development in the games files seemed to have just dropped dead. And also a Repair kit? You could find those in the world such in games like FoNV without having to pay for them, plus they should come standard with the game, they‚Äôre not new to the Fallout Franchise.
---
.. repair kits in the Atom Shop? damn..that's getting close to something I'd loosen ye olde purse strings for..not sure how I feel about that..
---
Um, the Basic Kits can also drop, y'know. They're not "Atom Shop only."
---
I'm level 70 and I got like 40k caps over the weekend I think your build and guns just suck
---
Recipe allows you to cook up some "Raw Cheese" using milk and some other ingredients (different cheese blends?)....then you "age" it in the fermenter....or wherever....and you get Cheese.  Code wise....exactly the same process used for alcohol in the current implementation.
---
I had accumulated quite a few glowing masses and traded them for some serums I had been wanting. 
---
If that happens then I'll have an issue. That's why I stopped playing GTA. 
---
How long will it be before they start adding those lunchboxes found in the files? Or a legendary effect that is like the auto stimpack but for weapons? It is a big slippery slope that I hope Bethesda learns from and doesn't put in the Atomic Shop. They have time to change their mind but the wording alone is scary enough.
---
Pretty sure they thought it through.  The catch seems to be that pvp is geared to allow people to role play raider.
---
FTA:
---
Basic Repair Kits are single-use consumables that immediately restore one of the items in your inventory, or **an object in your C.A.M.P.**, to 100% condition.
---
I hope the refrigerators won't be exclusive to the atom shop. The post doesn't specify
---
I too hate unrealistic homes and I am extremely judgy of your house if you are a higher level player but your CAMP looks like it was built by two 12 year olds with a free week in summer, some scrap wood from the back yard, and some old tools your dad let you use.
---
Literally says camp items... 
---
Agreed - they‚Äôve definitely been improving overall, but every couple of weeks we still get one that‚Äôs lacking in substance. For example, how are we supposed to ‚Äúprep for this daunting new battleground‚Äù without the most basic of information such as the recommended level, sugggested # of players, etc?
---
Sometimes local creatures will kill the hoard boss before you get there. Sometimes the event timer runs out. (In that case the boss is usually around somewhere.)
---
It‚Äôs a pass through conduit ‚Äî comes with the advanced power plan.  You need to attach regular conduit pipe pieces to one end and Connect the needed wires then connect wires to the piece of the pass through connector on the other side of the wall.
---
And that is the fundamental flaw with games that have items for real money, they are ALWAYS designed to push those items - be it through shady sales tactics "limited time only" "50% off" "retiring cosmetic" or through making the gameplay boring, repetitive, grindy, or more difficult than it needs to be. They will always push the items that make them money and it always leaves the question in your mind if the game would be better with zero MTX at all. 
---
Exactly. They‚Äôre a luxury item....
---
Thanks.  Now i can never eat cheese again.  
---
No, unless ypu have atom store camo equipped it will have a atom store icon next to it
---
Did you remove your finger from trigger at all? I use gatlings a lot but haven‚Äôt noticed this. 
---
Maybe they‚Äôll be sold as a plan in the atom shop and you‚Äôd be able to craft them 
---
Yeah, as long as the workbenches exist, these do seem like a convenience feature. I have to wonder though if this is their "fix" for the weapons that break really easily.
---
Not at the moment. Renaming should be coming soon.
---
fuck outta here chicken little
---
The people here must not have played any mmos or mmo like games before..
---
Bethesda is gauging our reaction to breaking their day 1 promise to see what they can get away with in the future.
---
Sure it‚Äôs a small qol thing, but that‚Äôs **irrelevant** it‚Äôll only hurt and fragment our community. The atom shop repair box is **not worth the PR and the dissent and loss of trust of the playerbase**
---
Period.
---
Completely agree.
---
Atoms are earned in game OR bought. Chill. It's convenience, not pay to win.
---
u/valseek
---
I believe my camp is Blueprinted, but each time I move I use the previous pieces used window to re-deploy them. I've heard with level it does increase, I'm level 88.
---
I want to make a Mole Miner outfit. Even if it‚Äôs just cosmetic, that would be awesome
---
Guess I'll be needing this image again  [https://i.imgur.com/pDJwI4l.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/pDJwI4l.jpg) 
---
I get that, but to Bethesda's credit the atom shop is getting lots of stuff I want.  I've played since beta and earned and spent lots of free atoms since then.  Last week I broke down and paid real money for more because there was too much stuff I wanted.  So even if you are not going to pay real money, there is still a cost to buying them in terms of other cool stuff you would not get.  (Opportunity cost for all you kids taking economics). 
---
I just couldn't see ever purchasing these based on what you get for the cost.  
---
I guess I just wondered if anyone would...
---
buh-bye
---
lv isn't that important if you have been lucky enough to get a good armor and a good gun :)
---
stash all you loot before you go in, you will die if you are low lv, but usually players in the SBQ nuke zone is ok and dosent touch you bag until you re spawn, or i might just have been lucky 75 times on my main alt  :)  (got a award or something for doing it 75 times the other day).
---
Normal ones are Atom Shop only. They are a useful in-game item, thus going beyond cosmetics, which are purchased.
---
I'm willing to be convinced otherwise.
---
okay chicken little
---
A few days ago a level 12 tried to but my level 50 super sledge with instigating 40% faster swing and -90% weight for 200 caps and all his junk this sort of thing happens to often worst part is he kept on following me in whitesprings trying to get me to trade with him until I quit and joined a new server
---
When they use the scorchbeast queen as an example of where they will drop...I'm less than hopeful.
---
That's an all round disappointing update.
---
P2W repair kits from the Atom store.
---
New camera but no mention of extra space for pictures.
---
Plus a delay on player vending. 
---
That's already existing and called pacifist in adventure mode ;)
---
Advanced one bluprint will drop in the wild. Not an issue for me.

Come on guys pass this through the team, dont go back on your word, **cosmetic only**
---
If you‚Äôre in survival honestly. Other than that i don‚Äôt really see it having a detrimental effect on adventure 
---
Am I happy about repair kits? Hell yeah. Am I happy about them also being available for the Atomic Shop? Hell no. However minor the appearance of these kits are in the grand scheme of things the fact that you can pay money for items that are found in game sound P2W for me. 
---
How long will it be that we get legendary weapons with "auto repair" that use repair kits? What would happen if someone spent money on kits so their "Two-shot, Auto Repair, Explosive Minigun" could literally fire forever without breaking? 
---
WWWWWWWWWWWWHAT IS UP GUYS JUICEHEAD HERE
---
May is early may, but yeah
---
So Instead of farming ballistic weave,. Someone can just go buy repair kits.  This is insanity. &gt;:(
---
Small change now but what‚Äôs next?
---
Bethesda is breaking a day 1 promise. It‚Äôs a freak not because of a tiny repair box,  but what it could mean down the line.
---
That's  very very true.  And when seasons begin in survival, whales with Infinite repair kits will never have to go home or grind for mats. It's actually worse and worse the more you think about it
---
It's not actually the first instance of P2W elements so far. There was a promotion about a month ago were every member of your team wearing a different Unstoppable's outfit netted each of you bonus HP.  
---
The costumes were available for purchase in the A.T.O.M. shop for the first time during this promotion.
---
Wow thanks I will be looking into this!!
---
More repairs aren't costly, and with white knight armor repairs are practically nonexistent. Since crafting benches are so frequent in the world they aren't even particularly convenient, and are a worse alternative to using fix it good or weapon artisan. The only advantage they give is being able to repair in a firefight, which, based on how the kit works by having to inspect the item, is clunky, and not even exclusive to the person who bought theirs on the Atom shop, since you can get better versions from the Queen. I'm not comfortable with this development either, and I'm concerned as to how it will be implemented and what precedent it sets for future content, but it seems to me the devs at least are trying to implement kits in a way that's not straight pay to win, so I'm willing to see how it turns out.
---
Maybe make the cap reward based off killers ratio of caps to bounty?  Be rapidly diminishing returns if they didn't have caps to cover bounty on them then.
---
The point isn't the item itself but the fact that they broke a promise they made to the player base
---
i agree ,this is a slippery slope
---
gamers! rise up and make your voices heard!
---
if none makes waves over this, then Bethesda will just keep doing it... until it really is P2W
---
This an awful idea. Being broke is the only thing that allows genuine pvp,  what happens when you get owned by a higher level multiple times and not only do have no caps but you're  favorite armor is scrapped and you have a debuff for over an hour. I don't  think you understand the implication of this move. You're literally giving high ranking players with heavy caps an advantage. 
---
Need some junk?
---
This is a great idea except, they would find someway to make it stupidly expensive. Either with atoms, or with ridiculous amounts of materials 
---
It's likely that they were used pre war as mining tools to save time, but hidden when the inspector came looking.
---
I know where it spawns, I just hop servers to get it lol 
---
 [u/ladydevann](https://www.reddit.com/u/ladydevann) 
---
Atomic shop was promoted to be cosmetic only, and pay for convenience is basically p2w without extre steps and sugar coated name. Its like in the sense of other games where you pay a couple pounds and you get to advance a couple levels? Convenient right? Wait...
---
Plus on another comment I talked about how lunch box like loot boxes were founf and we‚Äôre going to be atom shop items, but when that went public, these lunch boxs sort of disappeared from existence.
---
So unless you think thats what this games about, making a game easy by chucking cash cause you‚Äôre too lazy to find the junk, god I‚Äôd think you‚Äôd be in support of oter companies that sell a glow sight for around 5 bucks because it makes aiming easier and it‚Äôs ‚Äúconvenient‚Äù in your logic. (Sorry if that sounds a bit rude, but I‚Äôm a bit flustered at this because hell I spent ¬£60 on this game, repair kits should be damned in game with no extra cost, because they ain‚Äôt new to the Fallout Franchise)
---
That's...kinda how cheese has always happened.  You take milk....and make it separate (usually a chemical or cooking type of process, how you do it DEFINITELY affects the end cheese result)...then you take the hardened goo of milk solids and...for all intents and purposes let it rot under carefully controlled conditions until it becomes cheese.
---
Milk will separate and congeal on its own if you let it sit out for a while, so that's also a valid starter for cheese.  Which is why you can describe cheese as "Fancy Rotten Milk"
---
RIP! I would have loved to see the damage on that XD I have a Discord if you ever want to theory craft or talk about it!
---
You should know what you‚Äôre putting in your body.
---
Stash limits are at 800 i think
---
Meh...  honestly ,once you have both of the repair to 150% Perk cards,¬† ¬†repairing to 100% with a basic repair kit is pretty much useless to me, its buying me a few minutes.¬†  
---
That advanced one though, that sounds like fun, because after I've done a run through some super mutants and my armor is at 80-90%- being able to repair an item to 150% now vs going back to my camp would be a nice time saver   
---
As long as the advanced one is craftable\\lootable- I'm fine with giving the lowbies something on the Atom Shop- I mean if you are dumb enogh to spent atom points on something that just takes you to 100 when a few hits from a medium mob undoes it, thats a you problem
---
Really, may for player vending now? Come on man, I wanna sell my stuffs!
---
I personally use the "degrade slower" perks and they seem to be just fine. I always have gained way more materials than I need to repair by the time my weapons and armor are ready to break.
---
Also, they did recently buff durability of laser weapons and heavy weapons didn't they? So that is part of what makes me think this isn't a full-scale end-of-days scenario for the game. I'll watch it closely, but I'm not ready to declare this a nail in the coffin just yet.
---
Next thing is you are going to be bitching about how survival is not fun for those who are not in clans. Every game that is a survival either has small servers for small groups of friends so things stay friendly, or has large servers dominated by huge clan groups. 
---
The implementation of Survival mode is stupid, and was probably built to try and quell the cry babies like yourself who don't want their precious little ghouls being turret farmed by others in Whitesprings.
---
wow Pay2win is coming to FO76.... this is sad.
---
It‚Äôs a video game company, what else is new 
---
Who cares of you buy something that fixes it to 100%, I'm still going to my base and fixing it to 200%. I dont see an issue with that at all. 
---
Others: I spent 10 dollars to repair my one item twice
---
Me as an intillectual: I spent 1 minute flipping my stat cards around and got 200% repair for free. 
---
Unfortunately the problem is that you might get off 1 shot for the extra damage, but after that every enemy within range will be alerted to your presence and your "hidden" quickly goes to "Danger". Also keep in mind that an enemies detection could be beyond the range of your pistol even with the range perks. 
---
With a maxed out sneak perk, silenced weapons, some chameleon armor and escape artist you can literally sit on top of them with the "caution" alert, and still hit for extra damage while taking on a mob.
---
Without those stealth perks and gear after your first shot the mob is on top of you. And it is much worse when you are inside at closer quarters. 
---
In my opinion it's not worth spending the extra perk point on covert ops when it will only be useful in 5% of combat situations. Something like Dodgy is useful in 100% of your combat situations. Or even put the point into intelligence and use it for Gunsmith to help with weapon breakage. 
---
It is, however, pay to get a useful in-game item.
---
That Atom Points can be earned in-game is simply dodging the issue.
---
Exactly. This is madness. I was extremely defensive of the game during the Unstoppables controversy. But This will completely change the game experience between a player who pays extra and one who does not. Think of how it will affect them during PvP when one person can just keep repairing their weapons.
---
Yeah, high level chars have more to loose. I was just generally speaking why probably less and less peoples tend to play survival mode.
---
Ill mention im 100% pacifist all the time
---
buuuuut my mind upon reading the title immediately went to "she just really wants to build a turret base outside the white springs country club"
---
Agreed. It's the principle.
---
The kits aren't even out yet...
---
Repair kits in Atom Shop.....Bwaaaa Haaaaa haaaa haaaa ha ha......Pay 2 Win here we come!  What‚Äôs next, player vending machines in the Atom Shop?
---
It's absolutely pay to win. It may be minor, but one example would be using a repair kit in pvp after your weapon or armor breaks or preventing it from breaking in a drawn out fight.
---
more Junk for the SBQ to drop. no thank you. I can fix my own shit. I have been this whole time all by myself. 
---
\#nousableobjetsintheatomstore
---
I have one guy weighted down with so much bulk junk. Give me another month and oh my goodness. üôÑ
---
One important thing I see is that the wording is that they are unlockable in the atomic shop, just like you would unlock a skin for a weapon or armor or a camp item.  Then in the game you build said item or skin using materials.  I‚Äôm hoping that they mean you just unlock learning the plan to make repair kits
---
Uranium Fever is one of my favorite events in the game. If I need steel I can scrap the dozens of weapons and accumulate 400+ in a matter of minutes. If I need something to sell I can vendor those weapons instead. It also guarantees 3 legendary items. They're capped at level 40, but can still be viable with the right roll. My level 40 3 star bloodied, faster swing speed, reduced weight super sledge is better than any level 50 legendary melee I've found in 200+ hours.
---
They are available in game as well so im ok with it
---
Dont take this the wrong way, I understand what you are doing. There are still gonna be people that buys the kits because maybe they dont want to rely on others or maybe they lack the resources but have kits they can use. Those are my reasons why I would use the kits. I have good weapons and armor  but I lack the resources to repair them often.
---
You can add the chameleon mutation to help with stealth 
---
But what about the time spent farming the materials? What about low level players who don't have the perk cards?
---
They only repair to 100% .....  
---
The Perk cards you get at level 24 and then 40 repair to 200%
---
The point of repair kits is being able to repair on the go. You have nice sentiment but you can‚Äôt do what repair kits can do. 
---
I am against this for a few reasons:  
---
1. The game has a bad enough reputation already. Putting 'pay for relief' items on the cash shop is NOT going to help that out. Youtubers and games media sites are going to gobble this up. 
---
2. I don't like the way it was just slipped casually into the article: " We also felt we could try out something new with these, both in-game and  in the Atomic Shop. As we look to the future, we‚Äôre exploring ways we  can bring other community-driven ideas to the game as well". 'Try something new' is a pretty euphemistic way to describe cash shopping much-requested utility items. This sounds like more and more non-cosmetic stuff will be coming to the cash shop as well, and I'm not thrilled about Bethesda selling popular community requests in the first place. Many of us paid full price for this game, and even turned the other cheek when it was like half price a week later lol. Let's not go down the road of increasing monetization...
---
3. Utility conflicts with gameplay. For example, someone in one of my discords asked if this would be single use or infinite use. My response was that either way it's a bad outcome:  Single use = the player base gets milked, Infinite use = some small part of gameplay gets trivialized. Especially bothersome because the timing of these items would coincide with the release of tougher content away from benches like dungeons and later raids... so some people could feel pressured to buy these items for that content.
---
This is just bad, I think. I bought the game pre-launch despite the stink beginning to spread around the game, I've enjoyed it, and I've spent $50 on the cash shop since then to show my support for the future. But putting ANY kind of utility or gameplay-affecting items on the cash shop is going to sorely test my resolve. Especially since your cosmetics aren't even very good so far...
---
So if these repair kits show up there, and then fridges, and converters, and all these other neat ideas, I'm likely going to say screw this. It leaves a bad taste and I've had more than enough negativity around this game... most of it from outsiders, but it's so much worse when the source is Bethesda's marketing team.
---
Hopefully Bethesda realizes their mistake and this does not come to pass. &gt;.&lt;
---
The Unstoppables-ordeal was definitely a precursor to this. I always thought it was a bit weak to call it pay to win ‚Äî but I see now where that has brought us. Regardless, this time around we're talking a permanent feature which is so much worse.
---
make sure to use the perk card starched genes on lvl 2 that locks in your mutation of it will go away if you use radaway!!
---
If you can't kill people because they have 0 caps then players would abuse that to bait people out into attacking their decoy/bait player while the rest of the team sets up for the kill on someone.
---
That‚Äôs so crazy, I‚Äôm lvl 78 and I have like 7 mutations rn.
---
Where do I line up to petition a nerf on pvp dmg all around? Let's make these fights actually strategic and not, "poof! Smacked you for 8mil dmg."
---
take RuneScape 3 as an example
---
for over a decade they banned players who participated in any real world trading.
---
Then they start with a little daily drop, with drops you can earn in game!
---
Then they move to a bigger one with keys and prizes, but you can earn them in game!
---
Now?
---
You can quite literally buy xp, money, you name it. The game is completely p2w
---
The point here is Bethesda is breaking a day 1 promise just like runescape did, just like so many other gaming companies have done. You may think we‚Äôre overreacting, and you may be right, but that‚Äôs only because we‚Äôve seen it before and we know what‚Äôs coming.
---
Sometimes you can hear the mole miners speaking English, and one of the statements sounds like "Oh... my... god..." an their weird voices. Which is something I chant when I have to power through the morning without coffee, too.
---
i have stand fast and 4 chameleon combat limbs
---
Yep. I always bounce it off a roof piece and run it through a deleted triangle wall to get outside. 
---
\# bethesda Do not sell usable items in the atom store. 
---
I agree, would save a lot of trouble when bug reporting/finding players for trading playing with ect...
---
Repair for 100% and pay for it, or repair to 200 percent and not pay for it. The downvotes youre recieving has me questioning the stability of some vault dwellers inteligence scores. 
---
Ehhh I don't know, I'm not reading too much into it. It's basically a free reset on your gear. I use those "degrade more slowly" perks and I've run the queen multiple times, along with my usual playing for a fairly significant amount of time before I have to repair at all. And I don't ever use those "over repair beyond 100%" perks either.
---
It might be end-game stuff like the queen, and raids, and stuff, but time will tell. Maybe it starts that way but they loosen it up a bit when people complain, or maybe it starts out spawning them too often and they tighten it up. 
---
Basically as long as they don't nerf other aspects of the game just to try and sell them, my gameplay isn't really going to be negatively impacted by the presence of repair kits in the shop or via drops.
---
It‚Äôs stage one. 
---
Find something asked for and dress it as a benefit. Low cost and low impact. Lower resistance from community. 
---
Stage Two
---
Add other ‚Äúrequested‚Äù items; ammo scrapping bench, fridge for food, as shop items. Soft changes again, beneficial, should be there anyway etc. 
---
Stage Three
---
Early access quests, dungeons, worlds. 
---
Stage Four
---
Cargo bots deliver ammo, stims, weapons 
---
P2W drip fed. 
---
Ah, a fellow cheese head.
---
Take it a step further since we have beer in the game we should be allowed to beer batter/deep fry everything in the game.
---
Don‚Äôt even need a connector inside,  just have the outside come with a connector and have the inside textured with an outlet to show the entire wall is ‚Äúlive‚Äù.
---
Looks better this way.
---
Yes, a player can be a dick and it is none of my business why they want to be, nor is it for me to tell them they shouldn't. No one can tell anyone how to play a game.
---
I just wanted it to be said that, be it a special needs child, a special needs adult, an adult, child, genetically modified goldfish or Google Killer Combat AI in training - the player on the receiving end of this kind of treatment isn't at fault for the actions of the player being a dick.
---
Okay by the game: Floating tower of power supported by a single set of stairs.
---
Not okay by the game: Me adding in a structurally sound storage loft and drop ceiling because it would be unreachable, and the flat roof section ‚Äúintersects‚Äù with the regular one. 
---
At least we'll be able to take photos of your pain
---
My guess is because most fallout fans come from a single player background where they don't have to interact with or shoot other people.
---
 As opposed to say a call of duty or battle royale type gamer whose only objective in the games they play is to shoot and kill other people. 
---
That's just a part of the problem. Who knows what's coming next? DO you really think this type of behavior should be encouraged? Even then, I'd understand doing this like 1.5-2 years after launch when sales should gradually start going down too low to support development. In less than 6 months after launch? That's insane.
---
Yeah you can grind but hell I‚Äôd rather grind for cosmetics, not to fix a weapon. We already grind to fix weapons, grinding for atoms is like the same but with extra steps, and an extra cost. Repair kits aren‚Äôt new to the franchise, and should be available in the world randomly, not through purchase. Because watch how the next thing is gonna be paying to skip levels or get perk cards...
---
To me, the only time it sounds like I would ever buy one is if I was in the middle of the fight I couldn't(or don't want to) leave and all of my weapons were broken. This has never happened, so I don't see this as problem. None of the mats are hard to get except for some of the Nuked Zone stuff and I don't think any of those are used in repairing anything.
---
If a high level wants to buy them for convenience reasons that's one thing, but I don't want newer players to feel stuck between a rock and a hard place. 
---
It's an option. Not a forced path. Options are good and you do not have to buy them, also the better repair kits will be available in game as rewards. You could go shopping yourself at the store, or pay someone else to collect them. Convenience. 
---
Such pretty pictures of my mules knees and backs breaking from all the weight. 
---
Have you played the game? I‚Äôm in to Day 2 of farm for screws to do L45 excavator Armour. Farm water to sell to buy screws and adhesive while growing a range of crops and harvesting junk nodes. 
---
Not a quick process but far more rewarding than ¬£5 on a ‚Äúpack‚Äù of digital bullshit. 
---
It‚Äôs gone now 
---
I am going to have to be convinced that this is a good or necessary idea.
---
1 - Why would I need Repair Kits I'm already quite adept at repairing my gear to +200% and keeping it in good condition?  Does this mean a change in the speed we're losing weapon condition? I sure hope not because that's poo to put it bluntly.
---
2 - The Atom Store can make all the money in the world if it remains PURELY COSMETIC. Seriously, please sell me Wallpaper!!! I will buy it ALL!!! : D
---
3 - Items that can influence Gameplay have no place in a real money store. I guess no one will be able to Roleplay that Appalachian Power Armor Blacksmith when every Lucy Loo out there can just pop a kit ... 
---
4 - Isn't this a Survival Game? How easy and thoughtless is the game headed for?
---
5 - Yeah, Nah... 
---
Sell me Camoflouge CAMP items for Survival Mode!!! 
---
Gillie Netting or Skins for walls or whatever - Cosmetic items that enhance my gameplay and not take away from it - Thanks!
---
That just isn't true.  Basic Repair kits only take you to 100%  The two repair perks in question you 1000% still need as they take your weapons and armor to 200% 
---
ill be going commando to save storage space, so your pics may be NSFW
---
I don't really think its pay-to-win
---
Even eso has these and people are ok with them since you can also get them by playing the game
---
So what about players below level 24? And also, if I buy the kits, I'd never need to spend a level to get that perk card at all, instead putting that point in something else. And beyond all that, isn't this a downright lie about the store being cosmetics only?
---
Also isn't really pay to win if they cost say...5 atoms each. You'd be able to earn 40/week by just regular play. Yeah you can buy more, but as long as you can earn atoms in game the p2w argument is weaker than if you can't. 
---
The devs: "Interesting! Let me just type that up on my invisible typewriter.... *hums melody... Ok, cool. What's next?"
---
PC. I‚Äôm at work atm, but will be on after 6pm eastern.
---
Clickbait-y title as its best.
---
While I agree that this *could* lead to some nasty things, advanced one blueprint will drop in the wild. This means the basic, atoms one will only be useful when you are *badly* in need of them (aka you fucked up overhead). 
---
So yeah, I don't really care about that. If it is meant as an emergency repair kit, and not too pricey, why not.
---
BUT I agree with you on one point: They said "only cosmetic atom items", and this is clearly not the case here. Do I care ? Not that much. But it will certainly feed haters, youtubers and buzz/biased journalism against FO76.
---
Not a clever move from Bethesda, really.
---
I won't be buying any. I farm materials myself. It's just a convenient option for time limited players.
---
Because all people that don't like the game must be CoD kids. Yep. Definitely. 100%. /s
---
Maybe I'm wrong, but it sounded to me like you can get ebough of them from just playing the game or some may choose to save time and buy them. To me it really sounds like a good balance of making the company money and not introducing a pay to win mechanic because everyone can still get the repair kits without money. All that is assuming that repair kits are reasonable to craft or loot.
---
Agreed.
---
People here are actually defending Beth, because it‚Äôs ‚Äúonly a qol change‚Äù or ‚Äújust don‚Äôt buy it lol‚Äù but it‚Äôs the premise that‚Äôs the problem
---
Bethesda is breaking a **major** day 1 promise and people are ready to let them slide for it.
---
First it was the +10HP bonus which I admit I didn‚Äôt mind, now it‚Äôs repair kits, next is what? 20% xp buffs? Supply crates? Cap crates?
---
It‚Äôs a big issue, and so many people here who have apparently never played an mmo or mmo like game before think they can just ignore it.
---
Really really disagree with the pay to win kits. 
---
Especially considering that in the past weeks the challenges for atoms have become ridiculous. Level up 3 times as a daily? Craft 50 beverages, kill 50 legendary enemies.
---
Challenges use to be fun and now they're even more of a grind fest for 10 atoms and now there will be player advantages for those who pay cash. Really bad path this atom shop is taking now. 
---
Why not make them craftable. Make them need fluxes and other harder to obtain materials if you want them to be on the rarer side. Giving pvp players the ability to fix their best weapon in any battle just because they paid cash, vs worked hard to make a kit, is really unfair. 
---
im on here EVERY day, and read almost every post, and i have not seen ONE person ask for this
---
all the bug reports we have given every day, but they prioritize THIS?
---
I seriously need a tutorial on how to build a camp. I built mine ages ago and fussed around for a bit but basically didn‚Äôt move it or rebuild...until last weekend in survival mode. 
---
Now I‚Äôm reminded of all the camp building issues. I can‚Äôt orient floors well. Things don‚Äôt connect like they should. I get green things for a microsecond and then spend minutes trying to re-find that spot. It‚Äôs truly so annoying that I gave up. And I have nothing special compared to some other amazing ones I‚Äôve seen. I just can‚Äôt fathom their patience with the build system. 
---
I too am a bit of a scientist lol
---
I don‚Äôt think there is any need to apologize if you were out there fighting hard. Iv launched 3 times and never gotten a kill on one of my nukes. I figure anyone is welcome on the battlefield as long as they pull their own weight and do the best they can. It‚Äôs the people who hide out that ruin things. 
---
So you admit you don't have basic reading comprehension then. They said cosmetic only, this is not cosmetic. Seems simple enough, I figured you'd get it.
---
&gt; Not your backlog of saved links. Good try at a comeback though. üëç
---
I just googled it, because on top of simple reading comprehension I also have a memory.
---
&gt; I get it. Evil Bethesda is evil. But like....damn people relax
---
That's your take on this? They say one thing then do the exact opposite, and you excuse it away - then tell us that WE are the problem? Really?
---
Kids with their rich parents money would, teens who dont pay any board or rent... you know, people with money to throw away would buy this stuff, whereas people like me who have bills to pay and a family to sustain physically can never afford to spend money on these, so i'd be left behind
---
Roger that. Just got it this done this morning using the video that was posted on Reddit a bit ago. Pretty painful less run.
---
I switched back to Cannibal perk so I didn't have to worry about all my food spoiling anymore.
---
I miss my soups though.
---
You've got a point until
---
&gt;And by right they should now add DLC to fallout 4 adding these kits as 76 is the prequel therefore they would already exist in previous games...
---
Which is the dumbest statement I've read so far today.
---
Typical Beth bs.  Only thing I was really looking forward to.   What was their excuse
---
Based on the way this is...stated....I dont think you buy the kits themselves, as in purchasing the actual items, in the store....but rather you buy the "plan" to make them yourself in the store.  Then you have another "aid" item...with associated weight (1 or 1.5 doesn't seem unreasonable) in your inventory, once you make a few of them.  
---
Maybe I'm wrong though....but if you look at the phrasing `Basic Repair Kits will be unlockable in the Atomic Shop`
---
...yea...
---
I can't speak for everyone but repair kits were a big thing in New Vegas and it would be quite convenient to repair your weapons on the fly without having all the requisite bits.
---
That being said, using the atom shop to sell time saving convenience items instead of purely cosmetic items violates the spirit of their promise when then debuted the atom shop and opens up the door to other time saving convenience items purchasable with real world monies so long as they have hard-to-acquire slightly better alternatives in game, which doesn't sit well with me, quite frankly.
---
If it's 'pay 50 caps to unlock the plan' (or hell even 500), I'm not going to make a fuss about it too much.
---
If it's 100 caps per single-use repair kit, I'm not going to take it well, at all.
---
Hate to burst your bubble, but everybody in all the other vaults are dead (Savage Divide and Ash Heap) or already left *years* before 76 took place (The Mire). Except 51. Probably. 
---
Well... shit. That is disappointing 
---
Yah and the game explains this so well. Not. 
---
Those things aren‚Äôt cosmetic, they change balance towards those with the funds or willingness to pay them. The game was ¬£60 don‚Äôt forget. 
---
I want those two benches but you can get f‚Äîcked if you think I‚Äôm spending actual money on them. Yes I can earn Atoms at an appalling slow rate....
---
That pound of clothing could be a pound of bullets good idea. 
---
It also tends to float, making it impossible to move your base. 
---
Glad we‚Äôre on the same page :)
---
*nod* it's part of the "Armor" round up from Feb, I'll repost soon
---
They can make it impossible to move your base. 
---
Oh yeah, I know haha. I mention that considering the known lore, this definitely won't be happening. 
---
They drop in game as well and only repair items. It‚Äôs not changing much. 
---
Oh well that will work fine then 
---
If they go the path of Elder Scrolls Online, you'll be able to get the repairs gets in game from doing events and quests. The repair kits from the Atom Shop won't be as good, but are viewed as more of a convenience item. It's not really pay to win in any aspect.
---
ESO also offered food and drink available from the Crown Store (their version of the Atom Shop).
---
I'm feeling slightly sad about Player Vending being pushed but because I've been preparing for that day to be April 9th. BUT I would rather it come out fully functional then for it to be janky and buggy. What to do with all my stuff I'm hoarding for player vending tho!? :(
---
Excited that Bethesda is listening to the community! Excited to know about refrigeration in CAMP! :D
---
By selling the game for ¬£60. 
---
If it was free; fill your boots. 
---
I suffer from alt-itis myself but 2x xp doesnt really inspire me to play more... maybe less because entire areas will just be dead on all servers all the time, outside of events like fasnacht im hard pressed to think of anything that would sufficiently incentive playtime,.
---
I do. No radio. No ambient music. I've been playing every Bethesda FO game like that since 3. I prefer it that way.
---
But it provides a bonus to people who otherwise would have been able to leave a fight had they not had some excess cash lying around the, this can and will effect other players with the new survival mode being probably the main buys of these P2W items
---
How much for BOS
---
I understand that. I fostered troubled kids and yes, it is a choice, but oftentimes their life experiences has taught them such behavior is not just acceptable, but rewarded. I have seen very, very familiar patterns with griefing and real-world acting out.
---
I'm not saying everyone doing it is some abuse victim or anything. I have been mighty ticked off myself at what I perceive as assholish behavior on several occasions ( especially around scamming).
---
 Just that a griefer's motivation may not be as black and white as it seems, is all.
---
It's not that I dont believe that something like this could happen, it's that I dont believe you. Now it's you who owned the workshop (even though you were working?) before giving her the contoller? 'My special needs kid'. 'The kid insisted she was in pacifist mode'. Nothing you say sounds genuine, not even they yountalk about your child... except one thing.
---
You have an anti-pvp agenda and want to convince Bethesda to allow a pvpless game mode (ignorant of the fact that just last week they said they are removing camp damage outside of slap-agreement pvp). I am supposed to believe that an anonymous person on the internet wouldn't make up a bullshit story to get his way? I live in Chicago. Just the other day Jussie Smollette said he was attacked by two white men, even filed a report and started an FBI investigation. Turns out he was lying about all that for his agenda. It's much easier to believe what you are doing here is dishonest than that, but that's how it goes. People make shit up all the time to generate outrage, get attention, and get their way.
---
Again, don't preach at me about FO76 game mechanics. I'm not a pvper downvoting you. I have pacifist mode on 100% of the time. I'm someone who wants the same thing as you, but I can tell BS when I see it, and this story stinks.
---
That said, it's not a damn exploit or trick to pull you into pvp anywhere. If you claim a workshop you are consenting to pvp, and if someone claims your shop you are fair game for pvp. It says so when you claim it. Dont like it? Dont claim workshops. If it did happen the way you said it did (doubtful, as your story keeps changing) Perhaps you should consider that YOU are to blame for ruining your kids day, because you handed the game over to her when she was an easy target for pvp. 
---
By the way, when that next update launches, it wont fix this situation - if you claim a shop and go back to CAMP and someone challenges the shop you and your CAMP will be engaged in pvp with that person. The fix is to remove slap damage (damage done before pvp handshake). Workshops being challenged skips that handshake. Before you fabricate stories and plead for game changes, perhaps take a minute to understand how the game works in the first place.
---
Because they aren‚Äôt grieving you it‚Äôs a legitimate in game mechanic. 
---
Most of us just hate that mechanic...
---
I didn‚Äôt realize this. Now I need one too!
---
Having a repair kit is not a huge advantage, and not close to pay to win.  They are in game and not needed for play, and there is alternate method for repairing.  Typical overreaction.  There cost in atoms is likely going to be high enough they are not even worth buying.  I does give those of us that have 5000+ atoms something to spend them on.
---
Haha :D
---
"I killed someone who had no hope of hurting me and then was killed by someone I had no hope of hurting!" üò´
---
I think it's because for the most part  the people playing fallout games, are fallout fans.
---
 I know from my experience of playing FO4 and all the other games, I always wished I could show people the cool settlement I built, or go clear out some raiders with a friend.
---
Now I can for. I can hear gun shots in the distance and my first thought isn't "dumb super mutants shooting at stuff." Instead it's "I wonder who is over there, let's look at the map and find out." 
---
I can check out the cool things people build, and have people visit and look at the things I built. 
---
Sure there is PvP, and plenty of opportunities to be an asshole, but wandering around FO4, and building settlements, I don't think many people's first though was "I really wish I could be a asshole to some noobs right now."
---
Do they make u a better player at the game?
---
It's just an option to repair rather than farming for junk parts for players with limited time. The better Repair kits are going to be rewards in game. These are just an option, no one has to use it. Options take nothing away from your experience unless it's an integral gameplay element. This isn't instant kill weapons being sold for 500 atoms.
---
music, there is music in the game ? lol
---
Fairly normal, happens all the time, no they won‚Äôt just instantly respawn because another player showed up, best thing to do is changing server. 
---
And thus the anti 76 circle jerk continues
---
You‚Äôre not alone!
---
This is wildly unfunny
---
If they start selling something, then change the game to make you need to use the items (like increasing weapon damage), I'll set fire to the place on the way out the door.
---
Don't remember anyone asking for these anyway. 
---
I'm not sure they ever said this actually (although i'm happy to be proven wrong if someone has a link.) I do remember them saying the game would not be play to win, but I think people are projecting that to mean they said only cosmetic. I thought it was interesting at the time they talked specifically about no play to win, but didn't really clarify it beyond that.
---
All that said, I don't think it's a particularly big deal, at least not before we see how it's actually implemented.
---
Ya know slippery slope arguments pretty much never work in real life. However after 10 years of watching gaming and microtransactions become the norm and progressively shoved harder down our throats I have no problem with saying this is DEFINITELY a slippery slope.
---
Yeah atoms can be grinded for, but as a sales pitch we were told publically that the atom shop was for cosmetics only. Bethesda already have a lot of bad to their name, they don‚Äôt need to do this at all, it‚Äôs going back on their words which will just cause a bigger loss to this game, because as others mentioned, whats next? Buy XP? Buy Perk Cards? Literally buy legendary tokens? These are just a insult to people who payed ¬£60 for this game, I don‚Äôt minf pating extra for a snazzy look, but paying just to be able to play a game? Might aswell charge me atoms server hopping if thats how its gonna be. Repairing items is so trivial, even with grinding for junk, but you also grind for atoms so...
---
Unless they raise atoms that can be earned in a day to compensate, I don‚Äôt know how I feel. If bethesda does ignore the community, these kits better be darn cheap or thats just a spit in the face.
---
Agreed. Just when the game gets some positive momentum.
---
You can't "pay to win" with repair kits lol. I like the fact that they are made for atoms, if you wanna save time its gonna cost you money. They need to generate some sort of cash. 
---
Ill be creepin' around your CAMP looking through your windows trying to get those shots
---
So this is one of those good news, bad news sandwiches.  One the one hand, super excited about a new dungeon.  Also excited about repair kits.  Not so much having to buy them from the atom store, or player vending getting pushed back.  I'm okay with vending getting delayed to make sure it works, but let's shy away from any conceivable P2W mechanics with these repair kits please.  
---
I‚Äôm not selling any of them. I was just letting everyone know that it‚Äôs possible to get the jumpsuits doing that event. 
---
How about a bugle? Seems like the instrument you‚Äôre looking for
---
This sucks...
---
Meh, the youtubers get to make more videos and people fume on the internet comment sections, but I doubt anyone stops playing over this. It's definitely controversial but I don't think it's going to be canvasgate 2.0.
---
I play without the dumb suspense/ambient soundtrack.
---
I don't think they are but some youtubers will surely make some "Fallout 76 going pay to win" videos.
---
I'm not even planning on using them considering that regular old repairs give you 200% condition...
---
I'll let them have it after I finally scrap enough gauntlets for the extra spike mod.
---
You're thinking yogurt.
---
Needs mold... and a brahmin stomach! 
---
"We need a full on coop mode for those of us who just want to play it without this crap. "
---
Yes.  We have survivalist mode, we need darwinated mode where all of the asshats have darwinated themselves out of existence.  And then there could still be a mix.
---
It is telling that people COULD play in survival mode and try to grief, but instead do it in adventure mode.  That would be called cowardly bully mode, because honestly...  you could be in fight club, but you find it too scary.
---
As for taking the junk, please do if you can.  And please tell her, knowing that people are willing to travel to her to help her rebuild might be what she needs to know right now.  
---
As Mr. Rogers said, when you see a fire or something scary going on, look at the people around it and at all of the people rushing to help.  There are scary things in this world, but there are also plenty of people trying hard to make things right when that happens.
---
I play with a kid sometimes too, and she loves building and the reactions people have to her set up.  It makes her sad just to be ignored, I can't imagine how she would feel if someone griefed her.
---
Best of luck!
---
Uggggghhhhh.. no functional items in Atomic Shop, that's getting into pay to win mentality.  How much does it cost?  If it's really low, then something you can get from just doing some daily challenges that's one thing, but hopefully this doesn't become a thing.
---
Same would apply for ballistic fiber, which I forgot to list but we have yet to be able to bulk that as well.
---
it's stage 2, they already did pay to win with the 20HP temp boost they sold that everyone decided was no big deal. 
---
I wholeheartedly agree, on every level. I've been on and off going berserker with a berserker's handmade I picked up, and it is undoubtedly one of the most fun ways to play the game. Except I found that energy resistance doesn't affect my damage output, only physical resistance does, so I picked up the grounded mutation for a free 100 there (since I don't use any energy weapons)
---
Organ harvest time! Thank you for the correction
---
They are adding repair kits? Thats awesome
---
Yea, I really enjoy 76 but a game with a 50th percentile metacritic rating really shouldn't be thinking about how to make more money from the existing playerbase. It feels like an exploitation of the tolerant and forgiving attitudes many of the current players have.
---
I put the blame for this entirely on the cash shop team and whatever management figures are letting it happen. Y'all are going to ruin this game for the devs and the players. xD
---
One thing I can see as an advantage is the repair kit does not use any of your materials.
---
&gt; So long as you have a Repair Kit in your inventory, you can use it to fix up a piece of gear anytime, anywhere, and without spending any of your own crafting materials. 
---
This can be a big thing when you are talking about repairing PA without any ultracite, or combat armor without any ballistic fiber.
---
They drop in game and only cost 5 atoms. This will hurt survival more than adventure modes IMO
---
That‚Äôs how it was for me. I just left the event like any other time and then checked my inventory and was confused lol 
---
Snapmatic is the name of the camera in GTAV, isn‚Äôt it?
---
Play without caps or food and water. 
---
Agreed, I don't particularly mind the concept (because I think you'd be super silly to buy a 100% repair kit with atoms when you can get 200% condition for 10 steel and some springs), but changing the atom shop from cosmetics-only to having exclusive, usable items is a slippery slope. I think the whole idea is a bit silly; if the plan is to make a bit more money out of the atom shop, it'd be better to just fill it with more skins that people will actually buy, because I don't foresee many people buying repair kits from the shop. 
---
I don't expect the community response will be positive, not because of the kits themselves but because of the direction they imply for the atomic shop. 
---
If they MUST introduce these repair kits then they need to be introduced as a recipe and need to be tradeable.
---
This is the first time a controversy with the Atom Shop feels real to me. Not sure why they think this is a remotely good idea after their own claims of such non-cosmetic items not going there. Hope we can change their minds before its enacted.
---
The cost is not the problem, the problem is that this will lead to the appearance of other objects alien to the aesthetic that can influence the game more. and its gameplay 
---
Oh wow ok lol
---
my camps look like hobo shacks surrounded by crops, but when i see these i always think go duder, fuck physics.
---
&gt;I used to be parked on top a Rad Toad spawn in the Mire.
---
Let me guess, the junk node in the pond? I was there for a while, and it was nice having a limitless supply of food every time I went back to camp, but it got old after a while.
---
So you were the one that asked for repair kits. Dam you!
---
What is the repair kit? And what is the price for it?
---
This is the second post of seen you call someone chicken little on, get some new insults if your going to be like that
---
Exactly! And the fire bethesda will be because of this because if youtubers can make a story, they‚Äôll make it. I‚Äôve seen pages like 9GAG Gaming where they‚Äôre just 100% hostile against the game because of its poor launch, and only listen to the hive mind of youtubers speaking bad of the game, ignoring sll the good bits only to make a quick buck
---
&gt; Repair Kits are our first attempt at a utility item like this, and we plan to make adjustments based on your feedback 
---
Feedback: don't do this. Anyone who has ever played any "premium shop" game can tell you this will ruin your product. I'm genuinely surprised there's nobody on your staff who brought this up before the idea made it to this phase. 
---
forever or not?
---
It helps you farm mutations but thats about it
---
Duuudddeeee, thought I was the only one who did that. Had a camper kill me 3 times back to back first time I tried it and lost a bunch of stims. After that I started carrying only 2-3 of anything I use normally and a huge pile of spoiled meat and rotted fruit. First guy who thought he was getting a bunch of stuff from a lvl 91 got rancid meat instead then got pissed at me for not carrying other items lol
---
No, but that‚Äôs not the issue here.
---
Issue is Bethesda break a **day one** promise to us players.
---
Being that we‚Äôre all 76 players, it‚Äôs safe to say we‚Äôre more forgiving than most, and I feel Bethesda is taking advantage of that:(
---
Convince item that will be in game also, who cares?  Those of us that have 5000+ atoms have something to spend them on now, good job.
---
Well, to be fair.... 
---
fresh cheese just needs some acid (lemon juice) and heat.
---
Cheese would need rennet (brahmin) and flavours. Mmmmm. glowing fungus cheese.
---
Yogurt would just need bacterial culture, or some already existing yogurt.
---
This is exactly how it's handled in Elder Scrolls Online. You can get repair kits in-game for completing certain tasks, but you can also buy them with crowns from the Crown Store. It's viewed as a convenience and not "pay to win".
---
So long as they're available in game I don't have an issue. Repairing in 76 is insanely easy in most cases. There's crafting stations all over, too.
---
Interesting! I will test that for sure! Easy enough to load a energy resist card!. What level are you I could share some of my bought Berserker Bounty (currently have 50+ Berserker weapons in stash )
---
Will the cheese increase in quality with age too?
---
Yeah, nah my bad I came back here expecting civil discussion based on reality again. Oops.
---
Alright chicken little
---
It's a legitimate complaint.
---
I think it's the name of the app that's supposed to be like instagram
---
Thats my issue. Imagine being level 30 and only be able to attack 20-40 and be griefed by guy level 38 that has perfect items and build and be unable to call his friends for backup as the friends are level 60.
---
We are watching you.....always watching
---
Yeah but who doesn‚Äôt already usually carry two weapons for when one breaks ?  Even if you can hotkey repair kits (which it sounds like you can‚Äôt because you have to inspect the weapon u wanna fix) how is it better to repair ur gun instead of just pulling out a secondary ? That being IF the gun even breaks in a PvP fight which sounds like a rare occurrence n one u can prepare for without a repair kit
---
Would also like milk kefir, water kefir, kombucha and kimchi as fermented foods and use those for dailies instead of all the alcohol...a healthier approach to dailies, that does not require too much suspension of disbelief.
---
You seem to know your Dairy Products. Thank you
---
Yes. 
---
I share your skepticism, I don't want this kind of treatment for things like ammo scrapping or refrigeration. I just think it's too early to start demanding Bethesda reverse course without seeing the actual implementation. Bethesda has bent to pressure from fans before over some of the controversies surrounding 76, I don't think we're looming over a point of no return we have to nip in the bud lest Fallout 76 be dead forever. I'll call them out when they step over the line, not when they're standing next to it.
---
They didn't in ESO. The Crown Store repair kits were pretty much just a "lazy tax". The kits in ESO also repaired all your armor/gear instead of one piece, but repairing things in general wasn't hard at all (just like in 76).
---
still being compromised by god-toad. Atom should work as skin and cosmetics only.
---
Or that.
---
Make all walls connected powered.
---
Like someone else said, we can create a fusion reactor out of scrap but we can't figure out how to wire walls? 
---
When will Bethesda add pve mode to protect the children? In a M rated game for adults 18+??? Seriously, being an irresponsible parent and letting your kid into an arena ment for adults is just bad parenting on your end, grow up and be mindful of what you are doing. Would you let your kid watch porn? That's 18+ just like this game. This is not a place for children, no M rated online game is. They have ratings for a reason!!!
---
Please make it completely clear to BGS that a good majority of the community would be absolutely livid if the new legendary tokens are sold on the Atom store. The repair kit isn't exactly p2w, it's a convenience item, so it's kind of up in the air until we can play around with it. But making legendary tokens purchaseable with atoms would be both convenience and make people who spend real money on them have an advantage on getting better legendaries. Please please please run this up the network. I was shocked when I started playing fo76, I thought it was going to be like what many news media had said, and be bad, but I love it so much. I wish there was more high level content but we're getting that soon with the new dungeon! I wish it was easier to do caps runs, but we're getting that in like 5 days! I'm excited for the new backpack and scout quest, being I'm an Eagle Scout. I'm excited for new *cosmetic* items in the Atom shop. I'm not excited at the possibility of this game getting killed by microtransactions that take away from gameplay. Fo76 has so much potential, and if you keep introducing new content that's *free*, people will want the cosmetics and pay for them, not new convenience items or p2w, they'll uninstall and boycott over that. Thanks for your time and I truly hope you listen to the community on this one. The whole community
---
This puts a whole new spin on things and If True - I'm OK with this
---
GT is reddit name on XB1 Feel free to msg me to come over.  I'll try to bring snacks, plans, junk, and help build.  Always up for playing an instrument too!
---
Not bad in a fight, 20+ Strength with a wicked sword.
---
its a legitimate concern, absolutely.
---
one that will be blown incredibly out of proportion, regardless of it's affect on the game.
---
I reading this in Clint Eastwood's voice in my mind.  Nicely written OP.
---
Sure... you just have to defeat the SBQ to get them. So of course everyone will be covered up in the "free" kits. 
---
I think of all the times Ive been fighting something only to have my main weapon break, then I've gotta improvise, now if I was fighting players that "improvise" could mean I get killed, so why should someone having more real life money then someone else be a bonus to them
---
Yikes, man, Yikes.  Please stop selling water to find screws. lol.  Fans. Just wander through every instanced building near charleston and grab the fans and you'll be fine
---
I'll take a picture of it tonight, but my camp is a pirate ship, I ended up making a sort of "pilot seat". I made the same kind of set up above the seat. Half because it looks cool, half so I know when the flamethrower traps I have as "rocket boosters" are turned on or not.
---
I think it's because most of the people left are fallout fans and fallout has never been about getting sweaty and frustrated
---
Ignorance is not an excuse.  
---
It's 2019 - anyone playing an online video game knows that online communities exist.  If they don't want to be a part of it, that's fine, but if you intentionally ignore the community don't be surprised pikachu when things like an economy are established that you don't know about. 
---
and please downvote me, I know most of this thread is filled with children who need a rewards system to feel validated because they can't enjoy the satisfaction of winning a small pvp battle. Go on adventure , leave survival a killing monstrosity and add a few random respawn points and a 5 second mortality buff and a fake survival point based system you can spend (for the kiddos). Imo the leaderboard should offer a reward system for top three players after an hour.
---
I'd give out shittier rewards than that ugly old bat then and that's no fun!
---
Since they fixed the degradation issue of heavy weapons, you really should not be losing less than 50% ( out of 200% ) against the Queen if you are wearing your perks right
---
I‚Äôm not entirely sure where I land on this issue.
---
They did say that the Atom Shop would be for cosmetic items only... but I don‚Äôt think that this one particular inclusion is terribly ‚Äúpay2win‚Äù ... but it does introduce a slippery slope... but I don‚Äôt think that Bethesda is ‚Äútesting the waters‚Äù for the nefarious reasons that some people are claiming...
---
I think that there will be two factors that will be important to deciding how unfavorable this decision will be. The first will how accessible the Super Repair Kits will be. They gave ‚Äúdefeating the Scorchbeast Queen‚Äù as one example, but I would hope that many major group events across Appalachia would award kits and not just high-level content.
---
The other factor will be how expensive will kits be in the Atom Shop and how many do you get for that price if the decision goes live? To my way of thinking, selling three to five repair kits for 10 Atoms wouldn‚Äôt be too bad, as any casual player who can complete a daily challenge can buy a few and won‚Äôt feel as if they‚Äôre less well off.
---
Everything but your name. However you cannot get that photo frame background again
---
Elder Scrolls Online is a free to play game this game isn't. (it should be)
---
A simpler solution to this vexing problem would be to add wired connector to the basic set that provides connections on both sides of any surface (e.g. - Wall, upper floor, roof, etc.). This would be the simplest way to overcome this shortcoming. Advanced conduits are designed to sit on floors and I've found them to only work reliably by snapping walls on top of them, getting conduit runs through walls is problematic. They worked better in Fallout 4 IMHO.
---
Yes we did.
---
We didn't ask for it to be a P2W item.
---
Queen kits are 150 friend, I'm talking about the ole workshop repair trick! Ya know, repairing at your base that you can free travel to at literally any fucking point in the game? 
---
But no, let's complain about this some more :)
---
Yep. ‚ÄúChange appearance‚Äù from anywhere you want in the wasteland. 
---
So much this.  Can you imagine doing that?  I can't even fathom...
---
I was thinking about YongYea but heck, i'm sure there are plenty more... 
---
I'm more than a little annoyed as I spent a fair amount of hours rearranging my base to accommodate a new shop. 
---
On top of that annoyance is the fact they are releasing repair kits instead. Who the f*** asked for that?
---
 Not only do they seem useless to me they're making people pay real money to get them. 
---
As a wasteland foodie, imo, this is a great idea.  I'd rather run around gathering ingredients for this and all the obvious offshoots (as pointed out by others), than ferment alcohol anytime.
---
u need friends 
---
What's 10 minutes real time, in game time?  Half a day, if that?
---
I can imagine a few foods rotting in that time I guess, but not many.
---
Just like all the Fasnacht masks dropped for free. /s
---
Oh, so apples to oranges, then. Yeah, keep complaining about *everyone else's* INT score. 
---
Cept for using them in PvP...
---
That the latest movie you've seen with you pay monthly movie plan? this would just be another thing to cash out on for you wouldnt it
---
Yep.  Casual and proud.  Great builders too, amazing stuff.  Will make you want to buy atoms tho'... :-/
---
Na, yongyea will make one a month from now when it all blows over and proves to have been not that big of a deal.
---
Welcome to Camp building 
---
Rated M for a reason (17+ years old). Children should not be exposed to this game. I don‚Äôt like what happened either, but be careful what games you let children play, they are not emotionally stable to see these types of things happen. 
---
brb, buying more atoms
---
I have defended this game against the lies with my life, and the only reason I fear this development is that Bethesda may actually end up proving those garbage YouTubers and their cult right.
---
On top of the other reasons:  That's how the Overseer would have wanted it, may she someday find her way home...
---
That's pretty disappointing. Player vending was the only thing holding my interest until May. Couldn't care less about the repair kits, especially if they're going to be pay to win. Thinking I'm going to move on and try some different games at least until player vending and the legendary vendor roll out in May.
---
&gt; Or perhaps this is just an old man yelling at those damn kids to get off his lawn. :)
---
As long as you don't point a garand at them.  Oh, you can't that's only in NV :)
---
The definition of P2W is an advantage given to a player just by paying real money. By definition, it is P2W as you‚Äôre eliminating in game costs in exchange for real money costs. 
---
It is a small advantage but still falls under p2w
---
Because it's not really that competitive.
---
It's more like warframe than call of duty. Most people are in it for pve. 
---
&gt; Whilst I am totally against non cosmetics for atoms
---
If you are "totally against" them, then you should be totally against this as they are firmly non-cosmetic items being sold for atoms. 
---
I'm not gonna stop you, your buying my DLC
---
Is this kit a game breaker?  Not really, I generally keep my gear over repaired so it's never a problem.  I can only think of a handful of times I've ever had something break while out doing a quest or SBQ fight.
---
But they're testing waters to see if we'll accept it.  It's a BAD PRECEDENT and should not proceed, especially since they had repeatedly and emphatically stated that Atomic Shop items would be cosmetic only.  It encourages them to go to P2W.
---
Create a problem, sell a solution.
---
You posted my thoughts very well! Bravo and thank you! 
---
Well least your shop is also prepared and ready to roll. But totally agree, who asked for that, like we need names and dates, cause ain't nobody believing that. Completely pointless item.
---
Lol, that's a good point.
---
\+ karma
---
Then in your defence- 
---
Me: hey if you dont like apples dont eat them, have an orange
---
You: BUT THEY COST REAL MONEY AND SOMEONE ELSE MIGHT EAT THEM.
---
Me: yup.
---
Aaaaaaaaannk!! Rejected. Been pushed to May.
---
Also to note: ONLY loot the desk that has technical data. You can then server swap and the other desks will have a chance to the tech data. If you loot all the desks the desks will end up on a loot cooldown.
---
Also wanted to add anything in the atom shop can be bought with a currency that is earned IN GAME. 
---
Thanks, I'm new and when I realised how much more options there is, I was just hopping I could do that
---
What level are you? I''ve been able to quickly kill just about anything (players included) since something like 30-35.
---
Besides, I don't see the big deal. In reality, getting shot by a shotgun at close range should kill you nearly immediately. Getting stabbed by a sword should hurt. A lot. I don't care what kind of fancy armor you are wearing.  
---
And so it begins, much like the grEAdy days of Star Wars. 
---
But.. you can literally repair your entire camp for a few caps by moving a meter to the left or w/e 
---
u/ladydevann? Do you have any info on this?
---
I can't even imagine the other conversation...  "The coolest thing happened.  We spent 10-20 minutes destroying someone's camp and made a few hundred caps, no legendaries, and no new plans or gear.  It was great.  I'm going to go punch a stuffed animal next, because I'm feeling amped and this time maybe I'll take him down."
---
It appears that it's  a Plan that we acquire giving the Player the ability to craft them for themselves. In retrospect I am ok with this.
---
Ooof, you guys are really making it difficult for me to get my friends to check this game out. Y'all can't tell me you just realized this week that player vending was getting pushed back a whole month.
---
What‚Äôs the 10 hp bonus? This is all news to me!!!!
---
While I have the Appalachian trail playing at my camp, I've turned the background music off in the general game. I'm more sane that way....
---
Anyone who cant see that this is testing the waters for pay to win is being purposely oblivious. 
---
Sure it's not a necessary item, and we can play without it. But it does give a game play advantage to people who pay actual money. Even if it's a tiny one. 
---
If this succeeds then the next step is something that gives another advantage and so on and so on. 
---
Bethesda said only cosmetics would be in the atom shop. They've made the challenges incredibly hard since the brewing was dropped. They're going back on their word and changing the game.
---
When refrigerators come out as an atom shop item theyll say, well you can just craft fresh food anyway, it's not an advantage for people to be able to store loads of aid or flux. But it is. It changes how the game is played. That's not cosmetic. 
---
Exactly what i was on about 
---
why not use a normal wall with a window ?
---
Hey you‚Äôre the dude wanting to sell x-01 shocks for 15k, huh
---
at least your kinda doing a good thing? Your title is very odd
---
You forgot to mention the typewriters! The delicious screw and spring filled typewriters.. 
---
oh i forgot about covert op and i didnt think about radicool.
---
I may just do that. shoot me your discord info in a pm, I may be hitting you up soon.
---
Thanks man. I just started the moonshine quest and was working on that
---
That is not correct. Just like Fallout 76, you still have to buy a copy of Elder Scrolls Online. The game itself has a base price, but once you own it the game is free to play online (again, just like Fallout 76). Free to play online, but the game itself is not free.
---
 If anything, its exploiting lowbies, lol.¬†  
---
I've rolled 2 other Alts now, one level 43 and a Level 7 ( i think? )¬† and so have had a somewhat recent reminder of what its like to be that low again and yeah the armor breaks all the time but the repair costs are really low, unless they have a legendary armor ... but honestly if you are level 20 or 30, that -15% Ghoul or Super Mutant armor really isn't helping as much as they think it is and they need to stop buying ballistic mats, lol - People should be equiping the lower armor every single time they find a new piece - the repair kit just delays that but its kind of a rip off. A 1 time repair of leather or metal¬† level 10 or 15¬†armor for even 5 Atoms is a rip off.¬† A little leather froma Brahmin in Flatwoods and some cloth and you can literally craft new armor rather than repair it.¬†  
---
This sounds more predatory, trying to get these players to buy the atoms instead of just earning them through daily challenges 
---
No it doesn‚Äôt. You can play the game to earn atoms if you really want those repair kits. 
---
But the only advantage is the convenience of it? 
---
It‚Äôll take what... ~10 seconds of inventory time in your pipboy to fix a gun but people can have stimpacks hotkeyed but that‚Äôs somehow not an advantage all because people can spend money on repair kits ? Wtf ?
---
What if the prices are set for you like selling to vendors.
---
yes, keeping sucking the corporate dong m8, the accountants love you!
---
I change character and it pops up usually.
---
the WS jumpsuit is my favorite in the game.. i have a lot of rare apparel
---
I do remember people wanting stuff like repair kits in the first month or so of the game when people didn't really knew about the 200% repair thing, I remember some people asking for this kind of stuff for the atom shop, but those post were not very popular.
---
Now my take on this, I really need to see how it is implemented in game, test how the better repair kits drop n stuff, but all this stuff is concerning.
---
Yes clearly, if you have any item that requires rare resources to repair you can now bypass that with money. More importantly that applies to any future new stuff in coming patches. If there is some top level gun that takes 5 hours of grinding to repair you know they just sell repairs too.  
---
Good idea 
---
Do you have the Camo I can buy? 
---
I know the monorail station by fort defiance has 6-7 bags of cement. WV lumber yard in the north west, Walden Valley Galleria (typewritters) in the east, and Sugar Grove has a pretty good supply of screws. Aluminum and lead is found pretty regularly when farming Watoga's protectrons. Plastic can be found at Watoga and Morgantown highschools as well as Camden Pqark (Nuka cups with straws/packs on ground).Ballistic fiber and acid are the only two materials I have a hard time finding reliably. My camp location has a junk extractor and a lead extractor so I get by; but it would be nice to get a definite spawn location of ballistic fiber and acid. 
---
It's not too far away, only may 7th, that is if it doesn't get delayed again. But yes I am happy for any new content always. Def looking forward to the dungeon!
---
i ve only one character
---
i try may be
---
You don't have to buy it as it is in the game as well 
---
Oh i know, each piece of the EPA needs 14 bloody screws. That's a lot of fans, so i do both. Collect stuff on my travels, water accumulates, sell it to clear vendors, repeat.
---
Read the notes: "Improved Repair Kits are rare items that we plan to award to you for free as you take on various types of in-game content. As an example, you will receive them as loot when you take down the Scorchbeast Queen."
---
Just force Pacifist mode until Caps &gt;= (Level x2). Problem solved. 
---
yea! I actually like taking photos in game, but the limited space ruins it. I don't see this growing legs without more space to save pics. 
---
Once they are selling repair items, corporate will push the devs to make items degrade more quickly. This has happened in other games before, so I am not making this up.
---
This makes the game grindy for non-paying players. Which is absolutely fine with a F2P game, but is terrible for a game that I have payed for already.
---
I'm good. I found one on my main and traded via a friend. I appreciate the offer.
---
Hi good, I'm dad!
---
I totally agree, it‚Äôs not like our game purchase alone will cover years of dlc, maintenance and a support team the atom shop is still free to a point anyway, and if you‚Äôre worried about guns breaking have a couple, I have personally never broke a gun in a big fight, I don‚Äôt run the perk to keep my weapons falling apart slower just a single luck of the draw and have to repair my gun a couple times a week 
---
I'm at level 94 now and have over 20k caps.  Must admit I haven't bought much, just calibrated shocks for excavator and T60.  Might start buying more as I approach the dread 25k.
---
I personally kill other players in survival for my meds
---
Definitely. I wish people were more patient about these things in general.
---
The dungeon sounds awesome; Bethesda does a really good job on those.
---
Including Repair Kits in the Atom Shop...so no, no it hasn‚Äôt. 
---
Like this if you think they should update the scorched so they fight like normal enemies lol 
---
I'm not overly concerned, they specifically as they want community feedback. And while I'm fine with the time investment, some people may find they can't fit it in, so money for time convenience doesn't bother me. That's not play to win.
---
Ugh, it would be one thing if it passively affected the game...
---
But a SINGLE USE consumable?
---
That‚Äôs not cosmetic only.
---
I often get bored and move around, right now this place has got me pretty satisfied (plus I don‚Äôt feel like rebuilding my house from scratch for the nth time because of ‚Äúyou cannot place here‚Äù bugs) 
---
But if you want to know  the location, I‚Äôm directly east of Johnson‚Äôs Acre, and south west of Firebase Hancock. There‚Äôs two ponds there, an upper one and lower one the upper one is more decidedly in The Divide, with no carry over from the Bog other than being able to see it in the distance. It‚Äôs just over the cliff east of Johnson‚Äôs Acre and features a cool curved cliffwall on the northern side. 
---
I‚Äôm at the lower pond that‚Äôs further east of there, you can find it by following the stream down from the upper pond and I‚Äôm set up on the western side in a small clearing. The grass mixed green and golden brown, given that it‚Äôs a blend of the Savage Divide and Bog biomes. 
---
There‚Äôs also a large unmarked  lake to the west of there with its own waterways feeding it, further toward the bottom middle of the map, south of Lake Eliose (sorry I probably spelt that very wrong) with a good clearing for building on the eastern side. It was what initially drew me to the area. 
---
If a player doesn't have the caps to cover the cost of losing then they simply should not be able to PvP; they do ZERO damage to any and all players and their camps. They want to PvP then they need to go earn some caps first.
---
It's a BAD PRECEDENT.  I'm HOPING that the language is just bad, and it's a plan (cheapish) you can buy from the Atomic Shop.  If it's something that's cheap and easy to obtain from daily challenges, I'll be more understanding, but it's still a dangerous sign of moving towards P2W purchases.
---
&gt;and for the first time since launch I actually agree with the naysayers on this one  
---
I agree, feelings mutual
---
I'm on ps4   sorry
---
hahah prepare to get owned, and your crappy passive aggressive "Little reading comprehension goes a long way." is gonna get thrown back in your face, as it seems it is YOU who didnt ever read what the Bethesda devs said about the ATOM store intially only ever having cosmetic items
---
Agreed, allowing children in a special needs class play this M rated game is not a wise thing to do. I‚Äôm not saying children cannot play this, but better have parent supervision, which did not happen. You were at home. Next time you let a child play this game, supervise them please :) this could have been avoided! 
---
Lately my VATS will Target an enemy, and then do no damage despite being 95% hit chance from ten ft away, I have to quit VATS and Target again and it works just fine. It's not a huge deal but it's bad if I'm counting on that first shot doing sneak damage
---
Well there you go! 
---
It's a big problem with modern games all over to be honest. Immediacy; games must be accessible from the get go. Cheats used to be the way to get around this, for free, and then those were replaced by cash!
---
They did say repair kits are one time use items though, and can't be dropped or sold or traded: typical of Atom shop items. Also, they are single use items, which makes me heavily inclined to believe that they will be sold as bundles.
---
Learn to ignore people and wait with any trading until player vending starts. Thats what I do and it works (although on the other hand i have no crazy super-awesome OP weapons so no one is bothering me with trade requests)
---
Agreed! 
---
It‚Äôs just to learn the plan. Theyll be like 500-1000 atom. Pay for it if you want, but there is plenty of Atom to get through challenges for free. 
---
Plus if you unlock it on one character, then you have it on all of them. 
---
It's definitely not pay to win, but it's also not purely cosmetic neither. I hope Bethesda reconsiders this, but either way it's not going to stop me from playing the game. The kits are basically useless to me anyway... It's just the fact that newer players without a solid grasp on the game yet may feel obligated to buy them.
---
Except even in a real wasteland, I could cut a tiny hole in a wall, pass some wire thru it, and then have power on both sides of a wooden wall.
---
Regardless of which server they are playing... If a player doesn't have the caps to cover the cost of losing then they simply should not be able to PvP; they do ZERO damage to any and all players and their camps. They want to PvP then they need to go earn some caps first.
---
 Don't we already have double EXP on Survival BETA. So is this really 4 X EXP?
---
Craftable, sure, I'm fine with them not being sell able.
---
Stimpaks aren‚Äôt P2W because you **dont pay for them with atoms or real money** [unless you‚Äôre a person who does, if so, shame on you]
---
Paying real money for something that can help you in the long [and convenient run] is p2w, even if it isn‚Äôt winning you battles it‚Äôs still a paid advantage. 
---
Considering the repair kits cannot be dropped, sold, or traded, I'm curious how much they will weigh. 
---
Also will they apply extra item condition based on current perk card load out?
---
Its intentional.
---
 Fast travel now degrades simulating time spent traveling. But dont take my word for it.
---
" Improved Repair Kits are rare items that we plan to award to you for  free as you take on various types of in-game content. As an example, you  will receive them as loot when you take down the Scorchbeast Queen. "
---
This I like. 
---
The basic ones ? Meh. I've never actually bought atoms anyway, the game gives plenty. That said, if people want to spend money on something that isnt really going to be much or an advantage after the durability fixes we've had then personally at least i'm happy to let them give money to bethesda that will keep the game going, and gain the ability to be mildly lazy about the mats grind for repair in exchange. This isn't like, ten barreled two shot explosive handmade that fires mini nukes from the atom store, it's a minor time saver at best, i dont really forsee problems. 
---
I'm in the group of wait and see until we know more. 
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt understand it either. You can find them in game and you can earn atoms in game if you want more. It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs going to be used all the time because most people repair to 200%. The way I see it is they are meant to be used in emergencies and you should be just fine with the ones you get in game. 
---
Some people are thinking it will be a plan bought in the Atom shop. If this is the case, all other cosmetic items you buy from the shop currently work in the same way so the restrictions would make sense.
---
I cant find a meme or gif that shows the excitement I have right now.
---
nice try Bethesda shareholder!
---
While those guys who destroyed your camp are assholes, I completely agree with that, but before the game came out, I took great interest in being destructive as hell. Load up in a full fucking suit of power armor, pick up a nice machine gun and wreck all shit was my goal. I don‚Äôt do it cause I want kids to cry, I do it because it‚Äôs what‚Äôs fun to me. Normally if the settlement was super massive and well built I would ignore it unless I had some beef with the player that owned it. But  i hope those guys get hunted down by other players because there really isn‚Äôt direct ‚Äúconsequences‚Äù. They were playing the game and using what Bethesda gave them. Granted this was in adventure mode but still. I remember I was taking a break from my everyday murdering and built a nice house I was proud of. I went out to collect more junk and before you know it it was obliterated. I mean I was mad, but I got over it and said it was just a game, and actually let it motivate me. Turns out they were mega pussies and I killed their whole team. Hope those guys get what they deserve OP :). 
---
It was the super suit thing where you got +10 HP for every teammate wearing a super hero costume, some were available in game so most of us including myself didn‚Äôt care too much about it.
---
also you can get the improved repair kits in game so....
---
Im bored from grinding the past 30h for mods, I helped a couple random people in my server today and its fun, ur the big guy 1 shooting everything and they r scared of a lvl 30 ghoul, also it makes friends
---
was it the ranger sequoia? because thats what im using now in fallout 4 and i think kt shares the same animation as the flare gun
---
Sometimes I feel like the devs are trying to make people stop playing this game.
---
Good you did it now after the hype died down. People have nightmare stories where poachers would swoop in at the dome, or keys were already taken, etc. 
---
I wish 
---
Might be a good life lesson. She could have blueprinted the structure and not lost much. But retaliation should be a last resort and a careful one.
---
Good call!
---
Gonna get the popcorn ready for the incoming repair kit is p2w posts. 
---
I'm trying to stay positive and believe that they're pushing it back so that they can increase the cap limit and stash size to better accommodate player vendors. 
---
Is it 30lbs, just like in game?
---
Also, well done.
---
Pretty sure only Player vending is delayed.
---
Yup
---
Yeah, that seems odd.  I guess it is their way to avoid pay to play of weapons.  In other words, you could offer to buy a weapon with 10 repair patches that you bought, and that would A- be a greater incentive than caps, and B- you would get a weapon without even grinding caps.  It would totally be money based.
---
&gt; I guess I missed all those posts. 
---
I guess, I missed them too.
---
I've read dozens of petitions here, some recurrent ones. None about reapair kits.
---
Not surprised. I've also found many suggestions of new content in this reddit‚Ä¶ but I didn't read a word about someone asking for a brewery system. And that is what we got.
---
They listen to the community, yes, when they want...
---
Welp, This doesnt look good. 
---
If you mount a connector on a wall, placing one on the other side of the wall, and they should clip together.
---
As much as i hate to say it this is definitely fucked while it's good that a better version is available in game they shouldn't have put it in the atomic shop especially because it seems like a repeat buy. Not just that but unless it's a recipe for the advanced you are likely to break several things before you even kill her.
---
Depending on the weights, this is still useful since you can just rely on a single primary weapon and kits.
---
Lemme be clear: The OP was a tongue in cheek post about virtual frustration.  I actually don't really care if you have floating houses.  And honestly, the only reason I can't plop my base down anywhere at the moment is because they nerfed blueprint budget.  Not that I don't like building a new one, but I get attached to my CAMPs, lol.
---
Also, with the changes to CAMP budget, it's waaaay easier now to have a base that's both functional and sexy.
---
Meanwhile nothing is happening in game because everybody's stash is full of hoarded \* \*\* \*\*\* gear and none of us can walk fast or fast travel because we are all over encumbered lol! we got trolled! When is that camp decoration bit getting added?
---
Is it really pay to win if anyone can get it tho
---
So?
---
I won‚Äôt use them, but if other people do. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
But you don't need 200% when you can buy unlimited 100%'s, allowing you to use those perks for other things
---
to be fair, it sounds fairly cumbersome to repair.  You could take your enemy down by the time they are done clicking to repair.
---
i still havent tried a shotgun or bloodied build..that may be next..i currently play with two characters..level 58 and level 60
---
I don't think the community managers will be able to do much here except pass on the message. As amazing people as they all are, they are, after all, employees of BGS and I wouldn't be surprised if corporate has forbidden hem to comment on this issue for now. That said, I have some faith in BGS. They salvaged a bad launch, but another PR nightmare is the last thing they, and we as community, need right now.
---
Lol I'll keep that in mind :)
---
This is every camp I make but I don‚Äôt lock all the doors just the one with my decontamination arch
---
Yep. It's pay to win. The win is not really a win in terms of pvp. It is a win in terms of people paying money to advance in the game at a faster rate. If a player doesn't have to farm screws and ballistic fiber and flux then they can spend more time questing or grinding legendary items. It is most definitely P2W.
---
[Already shared my opinion](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b9dzfw/inside_the_vault_looking_beyond_patch_8_april_4/ek40lei/) in another thread where this was posted.  
---
Absolutely the wrong way to do any of these.  Don't offer any physical advantages, shortcuts, or benefits through the Atomic Shop like this.  All you need to do is make the basic repair kits craftable items, and the improved variants dropped only.  That's it.  
---
If you want to balance a future fridge, make it a furniture item, and require it to be powered by fusion cores, or cryo cells.  Not by Atoms. No Atoms. None, don't do it.  Balance with in-game mechanics.
---
Get "owned'? Lol are you 12? 
---
I'm only referring to THIS article and people freaking out about the repair kits. Which is the normal reaction, overreaction. 
---
People are acting like it's only an atom shop thing. When it's not. That's what I'm talking about. 
---
Well sure, they'd have to be one time use. Otherwise you'd only need one and would never have to repair your weapons with materials again.
---
I just think their use of the word "unlockable" makes it sound like it'll be a craftable item for you to use.
---
And yeah you can't drop or trade them because that would ruin each players incentive to unlock it themselves.
---
No one cared about canvas because it doesn't affect the game. Same with the rum. But at this point, they are starting to affect the game itself.
---
haha. I've been a journeyman cook for most of my life, and I live on my own homestead.
---
fDefault1stPersonFOV is for the weapon view-model in 1st person , if you have it too high like yours, guns might aim in too much or to little as the ads zoom on guns is set by the aim model which we cannot change.
---
I use 83 which is good for most weapons but some guns like the black powder rifle feel too zoomed out while others like the single action revolver are in my face still.
---
Lower it to at least 85 for a more consistent ads zoom as there is no real fix without editing all of the aim models for all weapons which we cannot do, the only "fix" is to just use default FOV for all perspectives but you should be fine just changing the one on the in-game menu a notch.
---
They don't do this because every wall type would need a wall for this specific purpose. It would be better to make conduits work correctly.
---
Oh word. Thanks for the reply :)
---
 Im not displeased. Their plan seems reasonable. Chill out maybe?
---
I tried that kind of CAMP for a while, the type with a single foundation and a stairway...but the aesthetics got to me.  Lol
---
That line is along the back wall.  Be sure to have your proper forms filled out and stamped by the governor.
---
Glad someone got the joke. :D
---
The text description would be much appreciated though.  I'm only a 107 with a 11 alt right now. Instead of a damage build, I went with a traveling emporium build that places emphasis on weight reduction and crafting, heavy on luck and strength. I'm frequently zonked out on chems and  Nukashine was my saving grace. I learned to love being over encumbered. Being able to blackout and save my junk lets me filter what I didn't want once I'm safe. His name is Gary, from Vault 108.
---
Dont like how you used a story which is irrelevant, because your daughter should not have been playing this game and this would never had happened to her  in the first place, to push your agenda : I want a wasteland utopia where everyone is nice to each other. There is literally nothing interesting in that, there is no tension you just know that everyone who comes up to you is gonna give you a heart emote and drop you supplies.Not only that it isn't true to the franchise: all the fallouts had raiders and the bethesda ones had karma where you could be good or evil.
---
As a side note I've seen no evidence of bethesda removing camp destructibility. What's your evidence for this?
---
I‚Äôm usually hesitant to attribute to malice what can be explained by foolishness, so I‚Äôd like to believe this is less a coordinated effort to increase repair costs and see how far they can push us on micro-transactions and more a case of someone saying ‚Äúhey this cool thing will probably be okay, right?‚Äù
---
&gt;Guess I'll just quote myself again since you didn't read it the first time.  
---
&gt;No other game has figured out how to put character name and not have to handle a large and endless number of offensive name reports.
---
Bethesda you pulled at my heart strings with that Elder Scrolls video, don‚Äôt you dare turn around and try to use that good vibe to cushion the fall of this fuck up!
---
The Elder Scrolls Community is definitely paying attention to how you treat our Fallout brethren. Not only will this decision effect 76 and Fallout fans but will definitely affect our opinion of your company overall pretty significantly.
---
I use gunsmith, white Knight , makeshift warrior and power Smith. I really never have to repair.
---
Dang, couple of bethesda bootlickers over here!!! I still think it‚Äôs gross ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 
---
Or I'd be fine with atom store to purchase the plan and then be able to craft them, like the current apparel and skins. Or they need to be lootable but you can sell them. Pick one or the other. Not some hybrid of the two.
---
Right now, you are buying a power up. This is no difference than buying extra birds, bombs, etc in Angry Birds to help you finish a level. A very, very slippery slope. Imagine if they sold bobbleheads in the atom store. No different.
---
Agreed. I can imagine the stalking for some of the quests.
---
Im imagining something very much like the "weapon repair kit" from FoNV, but usable for more than just weapons.  They count as an aid, or misc, item with weight, but are craftable.    
---
Now, I too will be disappointed if you have to buy the item itself from the shop.  But considering that shop items are account wide...not sure how that would work.  Would they only be purchased for the active character???  That's why I suspect its just the plans, and you have to craft them yourself from actual junk and carry them with you if you intend to use them.  Not droppable/tradeable probably means they'll be classed as "misc" items.  
---
All supposition, but the evidence is in my favor...
---
Yeah, that was annoying.  But since last patch I have a lot less trouble with them.  I haven't been paying attention to patch notes for a month or two so I'm not sure but it seems fixed now.
---
Two reasons why people are mad
---
1) bethesda breaking a day 1 promise. they‚Äôre also worried they‚Äôll go even further into p2w
---
2) because they see it as p2w. Spending money to get an ingame advantage is the definition of p2w
---
really?  because the process of using them sounds like it would take enough time for someone to kill you...
---
Honestly curious.  Also wondering if they made it that convoluted on purpose to discourage abuse like that.
---
The Repair Kit thing is important, yes, but let‚Äôs not overlook the fact that they DELAYED PLAYER VENDING. This is not a good day for Bethesda.
---
I don't think we've seen any official numbers except the quote from Todd Howard that they have "millons" of players.    
---
Now, the prices they sell to retailers is super low  but lets just take an overly conservative number of 2 million since he said it plural.   Take 25% as the full digitalof $60 USD ( like myself ) and the rest at $10  
---
500,000 x $60 = $30,000,000    
---
1,500,000 x $10 =  $15,000,000  
---
So a total of $45,000,000  in an extremely conservative formula  
---
I think they are fine for a while , lol.    
---
I disagree. Their plan seems fine. Your fear mongering is unreasonable.
---
Brahmin ice cream?
---
you guys throw this crap out there like we all are supposed to know this? Where did you find this out? This has been a question I have had for the last 40 levels now of how the @#$!@#$!@# do I get power from my generator outside into my place? :)
---
just feels like they are trying to rush this into the game due to player vending being pushed back
---
\+1 another voice here who is strongly discouraging Bethesda from moving to pay-to-win mechanics.
---
Make cooler skins, limited time skins....market those, sell those.  I would much rather spend my real money periodically on cosmetics as a gesture of support if it meant we would not be put into a pay-to-win world. 
---
Never thought of it in that way 
---
yeah... gonna be more than 5 atoms.  Otherwise they will be the norm.
---
Items to revive and XP scrolls... so ESO is pay to win, and you're asking me what the problem is? xD
---
Aside from that, it's bad because Fallout 76 has a 50% metacritic rating and a notably worse user rating. It has had terrible reviews and terrible press since launch, and the gaming community at large tends to bristle vocally whenever monetization is prioritized over player-friendly additions. 
---
The QOL in this game isn't bad, but it could be a lot better. Seeing them put QOL items on the cash shop in the form of extra utility is not a good sign. The game hasn't even been out for a year yet and they're trying to squeeze more money from the players, even while their Atom Shop cosmetics tend to be criticized as lacking or flimsy or dysfunctional (like the sign I bought that consumes a whopping 5% of my camp budget, and was consequently a waste of my money).
---
So yea, as I already pointed out in my original post as concern #1, this game has enough bad press already and it doesn't need more-- especially when that bad publicity is connected to cash shop practices, which are highly scrutinized and often controversial.
---
I will as soon as I get off work! (4PM EST)
---
Exactly! Repairing is never an issue. And if its about the mats they also have cards that make repairing so much cheaper
---
Yeah, plus the half hour of your time spent fucking around with the system trying to get everything placed back how it was.
---
I mean I gave him two weapons and some AID, and I logged out as soon as he was gone (instead of just logging out when I got back to my base as normal). 
---
You can do this very simply with the conduits. 
---
The wire node that has a single conduit running off it can be placed on the roof and it pokes through the wall. You can then connect any other conduit piece to it on the other side. 
---
How often does he refresh, do you know?
---
Well, if they made items less likely to break ... If be okay with that p
---
After much thought and a few comments I get it.
---
Basic Repair Kit will be a Plan the Player can unlock in the AS. Ok, so I know I don't like waiting around for 3 hours for my friend to get his shasta together and fix his boom stick  so these are a possible Godsend for the impatient to Get To the Dungeon Already 
---
Advanced Repair Kit is a Plan or Kit that drops in Game and is far Superior with the 150% condition in a pinch.
---
I get it
---
It‚Äôs just one step toward Pay to Win. And let‚Äôs not forget how Pete Hines has told us not to worry and that Atomic Shop items would only be cosmetic. 
---
lmao what top levele gun takes hours to repair?
---
the only thing id say would be balistic fiber on armor but with white knight thats totaly negated.
---
In Survival yes 
---
Being against putting Bethesda on the gallows isn't the same as defending them, we just don't think the response is justified at this point. People keep bringing up slippery slopes as to what this could mean eventually, and if they get there, we'll be there with our pitchforks next to you, I just don't feel the need to get it out of my garage over repair kits that is **worse than both current ways of repairing equipment and the future variant of the repair kit that's earnable in game.**
---
Yeah, those two-tile stairway sections need some work.  If you fuck up at all with one of those, their support rules are such that you have to tear down everything around them to remove them.  Ugh.
---
Nobody is going to drop a nuke on your camp unless they have a personal vendetta against you or something. It‚Äôs a HUGE waste of time, resources, and possible loot. 
---
They haven't released all the details yet, but the new legendary vendor will trade you tokens for your unwanted legendary items. Those tokens can then be used to alter other legendary weapons in some fashion, presumably by paying x tokens to reroll x effects, or possibly to add new random effects to a 1 or 2 star item.
---
You‚Äôre paying Bethesda so you don‚Äôt have to spend as much time farming mats if you don‚Äôt want to and just play. No one is forcing you to buy them but they don‚Äôt offer a paid advantage if your paying for them? U get nothing in return and they don‚Äôt trade in money for skill. You trade in money to waste less of your time, seems reasonable if you so choose. Their ur atoms spend them on what you want 
---
I will buy them, it doesn‚Äôt bother me.
---
thats true, but still better than wasting all those mats after some griefer levels your camp. 
---
It's literally always griefrs, so.. 
---
Lol other people can have opinions other than you... since when is voicing an opinion grounds for being a dickhead? If you have a problem with seeing other opinions then keep scrolling or GTFO
---
I got a ton of free masks and decorations for free. 
---
yes i am, do you have an issue with that? are you age-shaming me?
---
Bullies need to be taught a harsh lesson. That's why they get a nuke to the face for their ignorance. 
---
If they have ‚Äúmillions of players‚Äù as they claim, they will spend the money to get a few songs if deemed necessary. The benefit outweighs the cost
---
Just saw today's update. Sorry, I jinxed it.
---
Sadness 
---
Griefing is very rare at least for me and it is extremely unlikely anyone would specifically launch a nuke at you.
---
I saw a couple of posts about this, and went in. I didn't see anything like this.
---
So is it something someone datamined?
---
except the same AND a better version are being released in the game....
---
so its not really pay2win its more people spending money on something thatll take 5 minutes
---
Nuking someones house has never been a thing. There is even an entire nuke free zone. Pacifist mode keeps you and base safe from griefing. Unless you take a workshop but that is signing up for pvp.
---
Just wanted to personally thank all that have replied thus far. I‚Äôm happy to see a wide variance of opinions and an open, mature discussion that has provided a lot of food for thought. 
---
One thing I have started doing which seems to alleviate some issues is to offer to mod one or two of their own weapons instead of selling one of mine or explaining the farming process. Adding a hardened receiver or a bayonet to their vanilla weapon is a viable alternative. Of course, I do draw the line at crafting Prime attachments or Decon Arches as everyone should learn how to harvest their own flux and whatnot. 
---
Helping out n00bs provides a crutch for them, but it should never be a wheelchair. 
---
Anyway, my odd anecdotes aside, this has been a quite educational discussion, and thanks again to all those that have contributed. 
---
Weapons - not a problem. I usually have 2-3 weapons on me most of the time and their repair cost is minimal
---
CAMP items - no issue. If someone breaks expensive stuff while I am away from camp I just move the CAMP 1-2 feet, pay the 2 caps, and everything is in my storage repaired.
---
Armor - This is where a repair kit may come in handy for me. Short on Ultracite or Ballistic fiber? Just throw a repair kit at it. I know I have gone 2-3 days with no chest armor before because I was short on Ballistic fiber before I finally broke down and bought it from a vendor for 230 caps / 10 pieces.
---
Other time I can see it being handy is a SBQ battle. Being able to quickly repair your supersledge mid-battle without getting out of PA would be a boon for many people.
---
I‚Äôm just now hearing about these repair kits....what are they exactly?
---
Been playing since launch, only had one instance of 3 guys against me solo and just server hopped and was fine. Now haven't played enough survival to tell you that but I think most the people on xbox are fine with doing their own thing. Had many people give me free stuff without even asking or even really wanting it.
---
I don‚Äôt pvp but if I know Im gonna be facing high level enemies on a legendary run or sbq fight, I always make sure my weapons are repaired to the max or bring along a couple back ups. If your weapon breaks its ok to leave and fight another day. I don‚Äôt agree with repair kits being in the atom shop but its nothing to bitch about imo.
---
I see the first part as shitty. but i guess i dont see having a repair kit as an advantage when u still have to go into the pip boy, find  the gun and then apply the repair kit.
---
not spending time farming mats **is an advantage**
---
yes no one is forcing you to buy it, but that‚Äôs not the main issue. The main issue is that they exist, and maybe bethesda will go further down the p2w rabbit hole 
---
Griefing is literally next to zero. Especially with the update that if you put on pacifist mode. They can damage your camp but the resources are minimal to repair and nobody bothers even doing that. 
---
What's dropping a nuke for?
---
Nukes take two minutes to drop, so if it‚Äôs on your camp just leave. Griefing will be removed almost entirely soon. Just don‚Äôt play survival and you‚Äôll be fine and don‚Äôt take workshops.
---
Time for popcorn &amp; beer üëç
---
I logged out and back in today, issue fixed with no update to my ticket.
---
I pass through my base a lot when playing.... Repairing isn't exactly time consuming... So why is this necessary? There are long standing bugs they could have spent the effort towards....
---
I tried conduit and it doesn't work. I place a through wall connector, and tried to hook up to it, but the game said I had nothing selected. This extended to my entire camp (built objects only) and I had to relog to fix it.
---
I agree.  But the fact that you can't place it right now is mostly due to placement bugs that still need fixing.  For example, if you put a stone staircase on the outside of your house (walking up to the foundation), you will not be able to place that house anymore if you BP it.
---
You may be fine with being lied to but the rest of us aren‚Äôt very happy with the deception 
---
Coming later is all that I've seen. Currently, if your in Pacifist (Slap Damage has been removed) you should be safe from dying, other than something exploding. If you fight back, then Pacifist is turned off and damage to you can occur. This should happen later to protect your CAMPS. Once again the action of fighting back says your OK with being hostel pretty much. If you have Pacifist enabled, then you should not be doing any damage to the other player. For now, the best bet is to quit the game and log back into another server to get a restore of the CAMP.
---
Griefing is literally next to zero. Especially with the update that if you put on pacifist mode. They can damage your camp but the resources are minimal to repair and nobody bothers even doing that.
---
I'm all aboard Captain!
---
What is this in reference of?
---
oh my innocent child, if they are less than 50 atoms each or bundled for 200 I will eat my words but I doubt it
---
Why are you like this
---
Honestly I 100% hope I‚Äôm wrong and I‚Äôm just overreacting.
---
I want nothing more than this game to be as good as it can be,
---
If repair kits are as far as they‚Äôre going to take it I‚Äôm fine with that, but it‚Äôs just my experience with shitty devs that‚Äôs setting off my alarms at this
---
even if they tried to hit you with a nuke you have time and a warning to move. 
---
It makes the enemies in the area higher level and have better loot. 
---
It appears left arms are very hard to get. I've seen about 6 T51, with about 3 right arms. I'll have to farm them later unless you find one. You may want to have one crafted by someone. 
---
It isn't active for me yet in survival, I even logged out and signed back in. I'm on PS4.
---
C.L.U.M.P.s =&gt; Camps living under multiple patterns 
---
Hahahaha nice
---
repair kits because reasons.
---
Currently 75. My build is pretty focused around stealth automatic rifles, but it's always fun to mess around with other stuff. Another difference between our builds, I figure since I'm going to get wrecked if I get seen anyway, might as well have the adrenal reaction mutation and run a pseudo-bloodied build for a bigger damage boost. I end up around 160-170 damage per shot with my automatic handmade if I remember correctly. I've also invested in the mysterious savior perk in luck, which has definitely saved me several times.
---
I think my favorite thing about playing berserker is the sense of realism it adds when just about everything you see will die in 1-2 shots, but so will you
---
You have to "pay" for it, either earned Atoms or ones you buy. 
---
Then you use it once to skip a process that currently adds an intentional level of difficulty to the game be that in resource management or whether you carry more weapons at any one time. 
---
Free ones available via selected events and quest rewards, but if you don't do lots of quests and are all about the PVP this could change the balance of surviving in that world. 
---
**Also; i already bought the damned game.**
---
I've seen slippery slopes come true more often than not. It's basic human psychology to think "That worked? I wonder how far I can take this."
---
I don't understand why people have the impression that it's a fallacy, it almost always comes true sooner or later.
---
Protip: NPCs are too dumb to use pressure plates/powered doors
---
Don‚Äôt really care, not likely to use them as I like my weapons and armor at 200%. :)
---
Like I said in my other post, it should be either:
---
\- buy the plan and craft them at your camp
---
\- lootable and resellable
---
I would be fine with basic kits being option one and improved being option two. But it sounds like it's more:
---
\- Basic you buy in the atom shop only
---
\- Improved are lootable only.
---
This is the worst possible combination. You either have to buy your power up or you get a very very rare drop. This isn't any different than buying an extra bird, bomb, or other power up in Angry Birds. P2W pure and simple.
---
you‚Äôre saving material farming time and perhaps fast travel stuff, so you‚Äôre getting an advantage in both ends. paying atoms to not have to do those things are ‚Äúp2w‚Äù even if it isn‚Äôt letting you win gunfights instantly
---
I like the first reason, people getting mad because maybe bethesda will keep going at it, especially if people write this one off.
---
The repair kits in the Atom Shop have nothing to do with materials or ease of repair. It‚Äôs simply a test run of pay to win consumables. 
---
Did you catch the names of the guys doing this ? If so let me know and I'll start hunting. 
---
Yup happens with allot of the games i've ever played, it just means you're enjoying the game and that's good. Now get back to work üòÇ.
---
The way it's worded, you can't buy unlimitied 100%. You unlock the repair kit, then build them.
---
The percentage drecreases aren't DR. They're calculated after the equation for resistance is done.
---
When a full set of Sentinel's or Cavalier's is applied, that set also being Assassin's only ends up negating 14% more of the original damage before the Sentinel's/Cavalier's effect. This is in terms of full sets of armor.
---
You're reading too far into it. All items in the shop are unlockable and you craft them in game. At least outfits and such. 
---
its called the wall conduit.. its literaly made to be put through a wall and put a conduit on both sides of it..
---
I dunno, I don't think it's better. 
---
I recently had to replace my entire camp when brewing came out. I wanted to build a moonshine shed near the house and some stairs glitched out and wouldn't let me scrap anything. Let me tell you I never wanted to throw this game out the window more than during the 20+ minutes I had to screw with the blueprints trying to get the house placed back in the right way.
---
the problem is not in the repair kit itself, the real problem is that if we accept it, in future they will add more and more non cosmetic items on atomic shop like the fridge etc, and soon the game will be a real p2w game.
---
This is a bad move, one Bethesda can ill afford.
---
It's not about the Repair Kit. Weapon durability has been buffed and i've had very little need to repair while leveling or after anyway. This is about setting a bad precedent that can only become worse. There is no benefit to the playerbase for accepting this as a cashshop item.
---
^This! I have just used adrenal reaction, may have to change autostim so it doesn't proc at such a high health level.
---
Fallout 76 is my coffee
---
So out of 178,107 players in fo76 reddit, 85 want to RP raiders. You're stating that the 178,022 people who don't RP raiders just have to deal with it so you can enjoy the game the way you want to. To quote an earlier reply from you, "You shouldn't be the one who decides how someone has to play the game he bought." This post is you deciding that we have to play the game with people blowing up our bases because we don't feel like fighting them.
---
Survival mode is rife with broken built/geared characters. I have run into 1 of them in the time I have played it because most of them spend their time at the stations. There is a LARGE map outside of those train stations. Events gather the people that aren't perfect yet into a nice group that usually devolves into chaos once event protection is over. Walk the world a bit, check some farming spots for people looking for the xp bonus.
---
Basically Im not trying to say you cant RP a raider, just go do it where everyone who joins is agreeing to risk it all being destroyed. Don't come grief adventure mode because you are afraid of PvPers.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs my thinking especially with dungeons coming. I can‚Äôt really see myself using them anytime besides maybe towards the end of one of those, it‚Äôs been a rough run, and something breaks. 
---
Hold up now, we dont even fully know how they work yet.
---
Well I want to keep the plan too I just forgot to include 
---
When are these kits coming?
---
doesnt work
---
For that to happen maps would be more expensive [probably never sold], no?
---
So this point is what Bethesda needs to clarify u/valseek Is it a PLAN to Craft it or the actual Kit because Semantics :)
---
I would love to have Mole Miner jibber jabber as my ring tone. 
---
Meh, maaaybe at level 40-70.   
---
After that, you should always being leaving camp at 200% + or -   ( as you can't repair until below 100% ) and you should always be wearing your anti-degradation perk cards for whatever weapon type you use   
---
I'm guilty of it myself, I think I played 80 levels until I realized that being overweight is less of a problem than broken weapons\\armor.     
---
So if you don't do this, do it.  Pull your weight perk cards off, go overweight, put on Gunsmith or like me, Makeshift Warrior and when you need to fast travel, put back on your weight Perk cards.    
---
I t will save you a lot of gameplay and frustration 
---
Yeah. See when I was a kid I played travian. I kept getting raided and raided. 
---
I sent some guy a message saying could you please stop raiding me. 
---
He responded "that's not this type of game". I got frustrated because I was a child. I mean. I had no right to ask him to change his playstyle. I look back at it now and laugh at myself. 
---
I'm kinda shocked everyone is on the same side as this guy. 
---
It can be a learning experience. 
---
Buddy, I‚Äôm done going in a circle. P2W would be a $200 gun that one shots anything. Yes an advantage of the repair kits in the shop is my time. If you could pay someone to farm for you all day or buy 5 repair kits... it doesn‚Äôt matter because it‚Äôs your choice not to build up the stockpile everyone else has. No one is going to be fixing their guns mid-gunfight. They offer an advantage to people who are lazy or want to repair guns on the go. It isn‚Äôt going to be a p2w meta...
---
Maybe you're not, but you're using the same strategy. Capslocks, huge words like "dnager" etc. Anyway.
---
I misread the original beth post. Blueprints not dropping are indeed to be worried, but again, we'll see. Honestly if they don't increase either repair costs or reduce items durability I don't see these atoms repair kits as being an issue. With the right perks you can already have a huge lifetime on weapons atm without them, so stashing improved ones in the event of a raid, sbq fight or whatever will be enough, I think- if they don't nerf item durability, again. 
---
Those things are part of the storyline of the game.  Broken physics aren't.
---
But just for the record, I'm mostly joking and RPing with the pic :p I actually am not hurt in any way by these ugly buildings, I just wish they were nicer.  Lol.  Reminds me too much of Rust and ARK with all the floating stuff.
---
I am so over the grind to keep my equipment going, so I‚Äôm all for this
---
Personally don't see the point in these repair kits. If you have the right perks, you won't ever have to stop what you're doing just to repair stuff.
---
Fix It Good (charisma): when maxed out, you can repair armor and power armor pieces to 200%
---
Luck of the draw (luck): your weapons have a chance to randomly repair itself
---
Don't remember the name of the perk, but it's under luck, and your armor has a chance to repair itself.
---
Also, makeshift warrior and gunsmith make it to where you guns and melee weapons break 60% slower when maxed out, both are under charisma. Also, weapon artisan under charisma, when maxed out, repairs weapons (except the Grognak axe) up to 200% as well.
---
Not saying you have to use these perks, but they work VERY well. Implementing repair kits just seems useless.
---
ESO is far from pay to win dude lmao. Just because a game has bad reviews it can have a shop? As long as there‚Äôs no game breaking items in there‚Äôs not a problem imo. Repair kits are not game breaking. They‚Äôre repair kits, not 200% damage buffs. They‚Äôre literally trying to make the game more user friendly.  
---
I know everyone has more than 1 weapon but just for arguments sake lets say you didn‚Äôt. If your half through a nuke silo and your weapon breaks you have to leave to repair it, that sucks. It‚Äôs a nifty little item that you DONT have to buy. No one is forcing you to. You get no advantage over it except for time saved going to a bench. 
---
If QOL changes are bad, I guess them adding a vendor from white springs is bad too. ‚ÄúAll the factions i need to sell to are in 1 place so now I don‚Äôt have a reason to explore and don‚Äôt get to experience the rest of the map‚Äù. I swear people complain about everything lmao. 
---
i've only had one genuinely *bad* experience, in about 90 hours of play. i've only been been killed by someone once, cuz i went wanted after breaking into their CAMP (i just wanted to look around and use a bench, didn't know you become wanted after that aha), someone collected the bounty then even waved sorry and dropped some aid for me afterwards. only once did i get into a firefight over a workshop, and the guy was 3 times the levels i was, so i gave up no complaints.
---
but just the other day when i was already defending the cabins, 2 guys came up and double teamed me. i let them have it, tried to get my dropped loot, they wouldn't let me near it, so i fucked off, but then they followed me and keep killing. even went back to my CAMP and they went after my CAMP til i server hopped. 
---
Until they bring it back I guess. All items on discount at the moment are leaving the store. 
---
Did you find the plan to craft the long bow bar, or did you get it from scrapping? Or do you just happen to have that MOD box?
---
I agree with the others that are saying that Bethesda is just testing the waters for what players will accept being in the atom store. They probably have a dream list of ways to encourage mass spending.
---
I‚Äôm so over the grind to keep my equipment going, so I‚Äôm on board with this 
---
It's possible they changed the wording, or you're reading it in a different language, but it no longer says repair anything in your camp.
---
Because Falllout fans are single player gamers moreso than multiplayer gamers.
---
I think this is a grey line. You still have the options with perks to extend the life and durability to weapon cnd as wells as basic repairs.
---
This is just a short cut but ins't solely gained via real money. There are challenges for atoms.
---
I can accept because there are multiple alternative routes
---
Before launch they said atom store items would only be cosmetic.
---
Come to my bar then!  Ps4
---
Teamwork Oriented Workshop Networks 
---
Teamwork Oriented Working Neighborhoods
---
Someone had a good one before I don‚Äôt remember it though
---
Now that's an answer. üëè
---
To be fair I haven't been apart of many online games so perhaps my bullshit alarm isn't as well calibrated. Just my perspective, but the fact they have a superior version of the item that's part of the game coming tells me they're aware of our feelings towards these kind of items and are trying to accomodate us while introducing more ways to keep the game afloat. If they start touching weapon decay rates to encourage repair kits I'll probably do a 180 on how I feel about them, but for now I'm willing to see what happens.
---
I wanted to say they just worded it backward and should have stated that they have added a new Advanced Repair Kit drop that does all this, but a weaker version can be unlocked in the store.
---
But then I thought about that - We have added a new high-level drop for high-level activities, like the SBQ or upcoming raid. But if you don't actually want to play the tough stuff you can buy it for cash? Yeah, even looking at it in reverse doesn't pass the sniff test.
---
&gt; shekelers 
---
Wow, really?
---
Yep, I've had that too.  I mostly don't use the two-tile stairs atm because of that.
---
Obviously the player vending has some kinks and needs to be worked on. No big deal, it happens.
---
Would you rather it be pushed back, or be put in the game broken and have another thing for players to complain about? :P
---
Um, in the middle of a scrum,  like the Queen, you can't stop to repair to 100% and if you are wearing your perks correctly, even the queen should maybe take you down from 200 to 125% ish
---
If she is breaking your armor, you are NOT wearing your Power Patcher\Armorer
---
Thanks! I was wondering if I could do something in Audio Settings to make my life easier.
---
I agree that anything I loot should be tradable or sellable. To be clear, I am not defending this. I am staunchly against the entire idea of non-cosmetics in the shop. Even if the plan is cheap, I don‚Äôt see myself buying this as I‚Äôm high enough level with good enough perks to not need it. I hope enough other people avoid it as well.
---
Basic Repair Kits will be Bae when you're waiting around for your friend to fix their weapon/armor so ya'll can Dungeon
---
Every day. Whether I'm browsing the settlement, marketplace, filthy casual or this subreddit, I always have a reason I want to boot up Fo76 after work 
---
I have encountered exactly two assholes on Xbox.
---
1) a slapping, harassing "follow me everywhere while wasting every grenade in his inventory" d-bag that eventually got bored.
---
2) a foul mouthed racist little shit that dropped racist insults non-stop, until I finally stop moving, at which point he started off on a speech about how to properly play the game
---
Other than that, everyone's been super nice. Like... freakishly so.
---
how would this work past 50? 
---
No, you're not
---
What's your build like that you have so much resistance to ranged? I'm melee build and I'm constantly getting one-shotted
---
Originally, hardcore fallout players such as myself were kidnapped by aliens and brainwashed to be passive so all the little Billy Bastards could prey on us and take our caps and destroy our camps.  With the influx of new players, they parcel us out now amongst the servers, so it only appears that there are friendly people playing the game.  So Run! Run for your life!
---
 My truth is, the players, whether PVE or PVP who really love Fallout for what it is and know what it can be are in majority to the asshats and griefers who show up to any game just to wreak havoc because they can..  We have stuck it out through their kinds' harassment and destruction,  through all the bugs and failures and misinformation and are part of a really great community irregardless of differences of opinion.  Note the player who posted today about his special needs daughter's first base getting wrecked by griefers. The overwhelming support of players across all the platforms irregardless of PVE or PVP preference was truly uplifting to me and made me proud to be a part of this game's community. So if you are just joining in, Come On In! You'll be fine.
---
The toxic player base got bored. Leaving Fallout fans to play the game.
---
Buddy, don‚Äôt say you‚Äôre done going in a circle when I‚Äôm actually stating a point. I‚Äôve already said small advantages are still advantages. 
---
Plus, people are also mad because they could add more p2w in the future to suck money from their loyal people
---
Yes or for people that have all the weapons they need the legendarys they would sell high or keep them get the weapons and sell 
---
Who still goes to whitesprings lol? 
---
not a bit of aid, i lost 75% of all my aid the one time i died there.
---
Yup, I found that out the hard way after realizing I was triggering the auto stim every 30 seconds with nothing happening except my stim packs all disappearing üòÇ Dont even really need them if you're getting killed in one hit anyway though. And then at that point, you might as well pick up healing factor for regeneration outside of battle, and we can continue down this slippery slope of synergestic mutations hahaha (I've got about 9 if I remember correctly)
---
That‚Äôs fine!! I feel the same but the ‚Äòdon‚Äôt care‚Äô attitude is just going to make it worse in the future. They will try to do more and more if we aren‚Äôt vocal about it!!!!!!!!
---
Ooh and then corn into tortillas. Then it's Quesadilla Time.
---
Let's all be happy the perk works
---
On point 3 especially since they cannot be traded or dropped. So if this turns out to be an important thing you cannot have 1 person craft a bunch for their raiding friends. Everyone has to have this unlocked individually.
---
please explain how 120% exp is double exp.
---
The value doesn't change the ethic at work here, at what point does the value for you become an issue when you consider the value you paid for the game in the first place? It's F2P plain and simple. You pay to get an advantage over the user who doesn't. We can argue about the supposed benefit, but there is a benefit.
---
Pete Hines used cosmetic and not pay to win interchangeably in this interview. https://www.vgr.com/fallout-76-microtransactions-hines/
---
Right, but it also takes in game materials to make them, which I think would be a fair balance for the repair kits. Maybe you can unlock them but to craft them you'll need flux or something. 
---
It seems like most people are assuming it'll be "pay $5 for a bundle of 10" or something along those lines. 
---
I mean I know it's all speculation at this point, and we should wait until it's out and see how it actually works. But still, like I said, I'm just being hopeful.
---
For for the most part you will see a Nuke dropped at two locations only*
---
White springs for farming Xp, Rare materials and Legendary‚Äôs this is in the central of the map and while this is a low/med level area, due to Nukes and high player level traffic low levels can frequently struggle. The other area is in the bottom right, no where near any thing else and is end of story /mission target. 
---
* I‚Äôve seen over 20 Nukes dropped and only seen 1 that wasn‚Äôt these two locations,  
---
That might be different, if they sell you the plans, then you should make 100s and spam them off the wheel but that is not my reading of their wording.  I'm expecting an item and probably 5 or 10 Atom points each.
---
This happens to me sometimes with various objects. Sometimes backing out of building and re-entering fixes it. 
---
Totally agree...this is not about the actual item, its about the precedent it will set.  Anyone who has been playing should be able to manage weapon repair and never need this, but the 'what's next' is what is scary.  They already mentioned they had several other items in mind for this type of 'utility' transaction.  
---
"Unlockable via the Atom Shop" is ONLY acceptable if it's made *free* from the very like the frat posters or the Fasnacht player icon.  Except they can't be a limited-time thing.  But no, they've already said " using Atoms you‚Äôve purchased or those you‚Äôve earned for free by completing in-game challenges."  What a load of shit.  
---
I've played since Beta, and I didn't spend a dime on atoms until last week. After the positive experience of Fasnacht, and because it's seemed lately like the game was finally heading in the right direction, I felt like they might deserve my continued support.  If this is the direction we're heading, my wallet will remain firmly closed from here forward.
---
Yes reasonable. Was wondering why this wasn't a thing already. Doesn't seem that complex. 
---
I think the ending of "paying to win" doesn't apply since this isn't a competitive game like Rainbow Six: Siege. It's simply paying for a different gaming experience. It would be no different than buying DLC. DLC, that in the past, had actual impact in competition like Battlefield with their unlocked weapons per DLC.
---
Fallout's Atom store items are just paid DLC. Like the Horse Armor from Oblivion (never forget). 
---
Yep, I have cried when I got vampiric rolling pin of death now for the 3rd time.....
---
Sell Civil War Top Hats to all the faction vendors.  They cost 1 cloth to make and sell for 32 caps with the lvl 3 Hard Bargain perk.  Here's how to get it:
---
1. Go to the Overseer's CAMP
---
2. Walk west to the [gravel pit](https://fo76map.com?locationIds=2439)
---
3. Find the random spawn point a few paces west of the gravel pit.
---
4. Server hop until you find the Civil War reenactor with the plan
---
I have Healing, Adrenal, Marsupial, Speed Demon.
---
Looking to add twisted, talons, and grounded after triple checking energy resist XD
---
I hate how people have been talking bad about Atoms store, how they should get those items much easier. F#ck those people. This right here is what you get for not appreciating cosmetic only cash shop.
---
&gt;Repair kits (Non-cosmetic item) will be purchasable with Atoms only
---
No, they are not only for Atoms. Basic is only for Atoms, improved is for completing the challenge
---
Biggest issue in my opinion is people often don't know how to run her anymore. Your main damage dealers are generally melee, high rate of fire guns and shotguns. If you can't output a lot of damage per second then clear the mobs off the people that can. A level 20 with a pipe pistol can't even tickle the queen so the should be targeting the softer targets. In the last few months I've spent more and more time clearing mobs off myself and the other main damage dealers which wastes time. Tagging all the mobs gives a lot of xp as well which is another reason for lower levels to focus them while tagging the queen off and on. Some smaller gripes would be watching your positioning to make sure you aren't blocking people shooting. I run a furious prime 50 cal and people run in front of me all the time which resets the damage bonus. I've regularly had people just walk right in from of me and stop. Lastly if you can craft the Endangerol Syringer use it and try to tag the queen every few minutes using the event timer to track it.
---
I am, I even posted my own comment in this thread complaining about this....
---
They're treading on territory that is a pretty slippery slope, that's why it's an issue.  We were told the Atomic Shop would be cosmetic only.  Repair kits being available for Atoms would kind of break that.  And even if you're using your logic and let's say people accept it, you're really just giving Bethesda an inch that they'll probably turn into a mile.  
---
In fact, they pretty much described that themselves already, since they mentioned stuff like refrigerators, ammo and food conversions..  This seems to be their idea of how to bring community ideas/suggestions in the game, and if this is their way, then things are going to go downhill really fast.  The point is, don't give them a free pass because you think it's not a big-deal in-game, because it allows them to test the waters and see how much they can get away with.
---
Dear Bethesda.
---
I am an amateur designer in my own mind. I have great ideas, the best ideas, people say my ideas are the greatest. Give me stuff, because I say so.
---
The space limitation is a console limitation. PC has infinite storage (well, as much as your hard drive). They could store images on their server, this would also provide a way for us to hang our pictures up.
---
I have noticed that also. Makes me happy I'm OK with iron sights.
---
did you have it hotkeyed?
---
i do west tek alot but being on the lesser "well thought out" build (sadly i decided to be a gunslinger) and wanting to respec ive been cycling between west-tek and whitesprings to not get too bored.
---
but what would be the better xp?
---
Do you happen to have a floating camp?
---
Fallout has never been about pvp and the majority of the players are those that have been playing fallout for years. These call of duty and fortnight rejects are the problem. They cant bully in real life so they do it online to feel powerful, which is more pathetic that their real world cowardice. Sense the pvp servers were added they have become less of a hassle but there are still losers attacking people and camps cause they think it's funny. I kill them every chance I get
---
I work from home.. ;)
---
It changes repairing a weapon from loot management, balancing whether to repair the weapon or armour, crafting from scratch, gathering junk, etc. to clicking a single-use item you bought. Convenient. 
---
Wait... You don't want Bethesda to sell stuff like this, but you want to be able too? Hmmm...
---
Go get 10 advanced ones by playing the game naturally or spend $10 to say fuck it that sounds boring and get 10 right there and then. Welcome to how money works friend 
---
I'm level 327 on my main, 80 on my secondary character, and 111 on my mule, and I have a few level 20-45 mules as well. The issue is that being one shot isn't fun. My guess is that you haven't run up against someone who has a full set of assn/sent. "VATS crits go through though!" yes, they do, but that's bad gameplay design to have a single way to counter godmode. It's bad game design when there is a single meta build that trumps everything else and forces a very specific play style.
---
Yup. First they tested the water with that unstoppables event now this. We need to show them we don‚Äôt want this shit 
---
Yeah this is a lot of useless drama
---
1.) People will abuse this by stacking multiole walls close together for def in pvp. Also things cant float in real life. As someone who figure out how to make true 100% floating camps without stairs, even my way has limitations that allows it to be fairly easy for someone to destroy. 
---
2.) I agree on the sauare. But you have plenty of space as it is.
---
3.)  You can build 5 floors up. You can also build down if you are smart enoughto build on a cliff side.
---
4.) Agree.
---
5.) I agree but it is fine now. Just place things smarter.
---
6.) No its a camp, not a settlment.
---
7.) Just unbroken windows.
---
8.) Agree.
---
9.) For certain plants like corn, and carrots, mutfruit, and berries. Not razorgrain, gourds, or melons.
---
10.) Agree. Let us clip it to the side at least instead of the middle.
---
11.) Agree. I would also like to keep the grass..
---
12.) yes, like conan exiles.
---
13.) Nooo. Just learn to build better.
---
14.) Noooooo roads or paths. Thisnisna camp, not a settlment.
---
15.) No. Allow then to build closer, but its still a camp, not a settlment.
---
What level are you?  Why do you have a ballistic fiber problem?  That's an easy one to find
---
The karma-whoring posts about this have already started.
---
Ah good ol Pete. Comes out of his cavern to promote games.
---
I use a Grognak's ax, so, by definition, it needs frequent repair. It can't be repaired beyond 100% and loses health quickly.
---
I'd carry one for emergency. Nothing sucks more than being 80% through a queen fight and your weapon breaks. Or deep in a run through a tough area- which the vault runs are supposed to be.
---
Not everyone has the weight room to carry a backup weapon.
---
IMO it‚Äôs kinda pointless. We have camps for a reason or train stations to put stuff away. 
---
Oh just wait, I've seen a few that easily rival that, including at least one fairly incendiary bit of name-calling.
---
 If you still cant read it here it is

##### "BASIC REPAIR KITS IN THE ATOMIC SHOP
---
We read tons of feedback and suggestions from the Fallout 76 community, and Repair Kits were a popular request that we wanted to get into players‚Äô hands. We also felt we could try out something new with these, both in-game and in the Atomic Shop. As we look to the future, we‚Äôre exploring ways we can bring other community-driven ideas to the game as well, such as refrigerators for C.A.M.P.s, ammo and food converters, and even the ability to send scrap to your stash without having to head home. Repair Kits are our first attempt at a utility item like this, and we plan to make adjustments based on your feedback, so we hope you‚Äôll share your thoughts with us when they go live later this month."  
---
It's a lot easier to take the wall down and place conduit first, then replace the wall :)
---
Hello, folks! 
---
Whew it‚Äôs been a few months now, and we finally have some early bits and details to share with you all with respect to the Fallout study. So, the project is still in progress, but we‚Äôve got to things to share. Two study abstracts below, with some plain-language translation: 
---
**Country Roads through 1s and Os: Sense of place for and recognition of West Virginia following long-term engagement with Fallout 76**
---
Invoking Tuan's cultural-geographic notion of sense of place (SoP), the current study examined the potential for videogame play to foster a sense of affective familiarity with (emotional connection) and abstract understanding of (place recognition) actual, physical locations rendered in digital environments. A total of 556 players of Fallout 76 were asked about their sense of place for and recognition of West Virginia two weeks prior to the game's launch (T1), with follow-up questions two weeks (T2) and two months (T3) following the game's launch. SoP scores were compared between West Virginia natives and non-natives, under the expectation that natives would have greater SoP scores prior to gameplay. The expected T1 SoP gap was found, but this gap closed for all players at T2, with non-natives experiencing a significant increase in their SoP for West Virginia on par with natives' feelings of the same. This effect held for non-natives still playing Fallout 76 at T3; for those no longer playing, T3 SoP scores returned to T1 (pre-play) levels. Effects on place recognition (such as recalling location names) were similar, but less pronounced. Although an early exploration into SoP and videogames, these data have implications for SoP considerations in videogame research and design.
---
*Plain-language: When non-natives visit a digital (such as the version of West Virginia represented in Fallout 76), they come to feel an emotional connection to that place‚Äîeven if they‚Äôve never actually been there ‚Äúin real life.‚Äù* 
---
**Feeling and working in digital Appalachia: Two months playing Fallout 76 fosters a sense of place in West Virginia**
---
This poster reports analysis of data from a longitudinal study of 369 players of the video game Fallout 76, focusing on their "sense of place" experiences (the perception of meaning associated with a site or location) over two months of gameplay. Fallout 76 is unique in that the video game takes places entirely within a retrofuturistic version of West Virginia (following nuclear war). To this point, both the game's pre-release marketing and in-game experiences draw extensively on West Virginia geography and lore to immerse the player in Appalachia (notably breaking from common pejorative portrayals of the region). Regression modeling showed that players who felt emotionally engaged in the game and who felt less physical exertion were most likely to feel a sense of place for West Virginia, even controlling for their real-world experience in the state (such as being a native). Our data shows promise for the use of interactive media such as video games to encourage a connectedness with and fondness for "real-world" locations.  
---
*Plain-language: Emotional engagement with a digital place during gameplay can help foster emotional connection to the ‚Äúreal life‚Äù place, regardless if a person has any prior connection with a location.* 
---
What we think we‚Äôre uncovering in these studies, and note that there is so much data left to analyze (such as your shared thoughts and typed perspectives on the game, as well as some of the photos that so many of you shared), is that to the extent that Fallout 76 was designed as a way to immerse players into a ‚Äúdigital West Virginia‚Äù ‚Ä¶ it seems to have worked fairly well! All of this (and probably much more detail that you‚Äôd ever want) are available online, in our shared Fallout 76 project space: [https://osf.io/n9dw5/?view\_only=7e4446bdd5c7408fb0ea2a5c78a0366a](https://osf.io/n9dw5/?view_only=7e4446bdd5c7408fb0ea2a5c78a0366a). **We share this with one very important caveat ‚Äì as of this writing, none of this work has been subjected to scientific review.** In fact, both of these studies are being actively evaluated by peers. A core part of science is having other colleagues vet the papers and the analyses, so we‚Äôre reluctant to make any definitive statements just yet. We‚Äôre also still actively working on all of this, so we suspect we‚Äôll have a lot more coming out of this (and we‚Äôll continue updating this URL space, as we grow the project). One core analysis that we‚Äôve really not done yet? The role that enjoyment of the game might play in all of this; again we stress here that these are early analyses as we try to sort and make sense of the data that we have available to us. 
---
Our eventual goal is probably to have these analyses integrated into a larger analysis (rather than as separate studies), but right now were preparing smaller conference presentations so that we can get early feedback from our peers‚Äîother media psychologists and social scientists ‚Ä¶ and of course, gamers. =) 
---
For now, I‚Äôll keep looking forward to Wild Appalachia and from there, we‚Äôll be in touch. Reach out anytime, and forgive us in advance if we‚Äôre a bit slow to reply back to folks‚Äîwe‚Äôre in the end-of-semester push, but we‚Äôre not ignoring you. 
---
Sincerely,
---
\~nick

\#onlycomesticfortheatomstore
---
Already said that hardware limitations forbid this right now.
---
But if you are in instanced dungeon, that they said is coming, and your stuff breaks for whatever reason - what do you do?  If there are benches then that wouldn't be an issue but we don't know if there will be.  What we do know now is that there is a $$$ way to repair your gear instead of gathing junk
---
People aren't just thinking that it'll be a plan bought in the Atom shop... the team said it themselves in the post.
---
Yeah but its literally their job as community managers to pass on things we don't like, I know these guys do a great job or I wouldn't have bothered tagging them, just hoping the guys they pass it to listen to us
---
not everyone is old like you, grandpa
---
I personally don't have the time to test this, but it would be very interesting if the community could come together and do some data gathering on item degradation rates, so that there is a baseline to compare against after these repair kits go live.
---
I'm sorry this happened to you and your daughter. It recently happened to me as well. I don't understand the appeal of playing as a nasty person. I can never choose the bad options even against npcs, let alone think it's ok to do something terrible to actual people. If you play on pc feel free to team up with me! I want to start rping as some sort of responder (maybe the firebreathers since I use a legendary axe mainly lol) and make my base helpful as well. I can't wait until they make our bases unable to be damaged by players--soon!!
---
I dont trade with anyone, period. I drop my unwanted stuff to lower level players or drop it in the overseers camp box. I dont trade with other players cause they always try to buy the weapons and armor I dont want to sell. 
---
Welp patch 8 has gone from a lot of hype to nothing for me. I'm all for making sure they get vending right but now all we're getting is a camera which takes pictures... like photomode which takes pictures...
---
Oh no here comes *juicehead*
---
um  YES.  bethesda selling us an ingame item for premium currency   Does NOT equal players crafting repair kits with their own mats and selling them for caps.
---
I was just telling some one. Don‚Äôt be surprised if for the next few updates all you see is ‚ÄúSurvival Mode‚Äù desired stuff.  
---
Repair Kits: How to never get caught At workbenches again. 
---
To the casual and semi pvp player this isn‚Äôt going to break or make anything. 
---
It's a helluva lot faster than finding a workbench, discovering you don't have enough adhesive, so you plant some tomatoes, wait for them to grow, combine with the other ingredients, make some starch, break that down to adhesive, find you still need a bit more, so go looking for duct tape, using a spare not-so-good-gun, and the same guy you were fighting earlier has dropped $1 for 100 atoms and bought a bunch of repair kits!
---
They should just fix that. My bloodied gorgnak wears down fast but I only use it on occasion
---
I honestly see nothing unhealthy about what he wrote.
---
Did he get his feelings out and feel better by writing out what bothered him?
---
If yes, then it was successful.
---
Whether you like what he said doesn‚Äôt make what he wrote unhealthy or wrong. 
---
simplest solution - i like it
---
I believe this already exist
---
I want the frame drum, since I play the Bodhran irl. And I would love to find sheet music in the wild like we find recepies, so we can play different songs that might even provide a variety of perks other than well tuned.  I would totally scour Appalachia for new tunes.
---
Just tried, makes no difference I'm afraid..
---
Member that time everyone shit their pants over the lunchboxes that never released? This is the same thing. I'm pretty sure it wont affect me at all. Funny thing is - you get free atomic points for playing. 
---
I'm with you man. Let's jump on the downvote train together. 
---
It doesn't? How is it different?
---
But you can also earn said currency in game.  If people want to waste money on an item that gives no advantage it‚Äôs no harm done. I agree they shouldn‚Äôt be in the shop but it isn‚Äôt the end of the world.
---
i remember from FO4, spending so much time getting my settlement defenses ready, making kill chutes full of traps for the enemies to be routed to, but then, after all that work, the enemies just spawned directly inside the settlement, made all that work worthless
---
so, with FO76, I've learned my lesson, I now make floating bases and dont have this problem anymore
---
That boost was available with the vanilla not atom shop item as well. The Mistress of Mystery fulfilled that....
---
Same
---
They dont care, They‚Äôre crabby
---
My take is that I don't throw a fit at Everything. I can't really say how this will play out. Time will tell. Let's now forget you can get atoms free too. I haven't dropped a single penny outside of the initial game purchase. So far I've been able to play the game just fine without the existence of repair kits. If people want to drop money on something like that....it's their choosing. 
---
Now if they remove perk cards to weapon condition then add something like this? That would be some BS. But it's not. Nor does anyone else have an idea what's to come. 
---
What non cosmetic items are there?
---
No chameleon? It's not like your wearing armor anyway lol
---
Definitely double check the energy resistance, as they may have changed it in a patch- I've been playing with some different legendary effects and have had the berserker's stashed for a couple weeks. 
---
I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt get to the full extent of what your saying, but hell if I may, when I improvise, half the time I literally grab a random weapon from a corpse and use that to defend myself, but I‚Äôm aware in Survival mode thats Suicide with the absolute TSE Fest that it is today (honestly legendary affects shouldn‚Äôt apply in survival imo) And yeah someone with more money shouldn‚Äôt be a bonus, but thats what the repair kits can lead too (Sorry if you were agreeing to my point and not disagreeing, just found your comment a but confusing (not trying to insult btw))
---
70 something.
---
I scrap everything but at the end of the day I got like 3 pieces of armor busted and only 4 pieces of ballistic fiber.  so its lvl 30 leather until i loot some more lvl 50 junk to put on.
---
Yeah i havent even bothered to do the survival mode.  Its not rly a fallout mode in my eyes. 
---
My topic title references Conduit - I, along with others, feel they are wonky...
---
Let found weapons be used to repair, like in FO3 and NV. 
---
Edit their code to also be weapon repair kits for the matching weapon. 
---
Oh I'll definitely carry one for an emergency -  Trust  me man , embrace being a fatty. The only weight I worry about is being under what my Excavator Armor takes me to. :)  
---
I'm melee too , so I need AP for my power hits, just gotta slow down, take your time.  AP refresh too is more important than total AP
---
Yeah the try something new is terrible. If they just market people‚Äôs suggestions.
---
Damn. The burn is real. Lol
---
The system isn't about staking people's calls
---
Nothing in atom shop is pay to get. I've never purchased atoms but always get all the new stuff i want. And the better repair kit is only available as a drop or reward. The lesser is available in atom shop. Maybe you read it wrong. But the plan seems fine. Fear monger much?
---
Common OP at least link to what you are talking about!
---
Yes as of today‚Äôs inside the vault Bethesda plans to add repair kits for weapons and camps to the atomic shop. This is ridiculous.
---
Aw, large darn. Thought it'd be the same thing as sanctuary from FO4
---
Half height is all you get!
---
All seriousness, I would love a half wide...
---
No. Chill out
---
Not everyone runs those perks and it‚Äôs a paid shortcut no matter how you look at it. 
---
Seeing as how they are wanting to use this as a test for other requested utility items like refrigerators it‚Äôs a slippery slope.  Do we really want more and more utility items to end up in the shop? Wouldn‚Äôt you rather spend earned atoms on cosmetics rather than a shortcut?  
---
And that matters? I dont care about what the rating is i still dont consider it pay to win, but i forgot to put i agree with the idea that all atom store stuff should be cosmetic
---
Same no double exp
---
That's why you always save your builds as blueprints so you dont have to rebuild.
---
Hope you don‚Äôt have to purchase the ability to get double xp every weekend with atoms. Wouldn‚Äôt surprise me.
---
Yeah I was agreeing with you, people should have to improvise, not buy a repair for their gun
---
They placed the blame on others instead of being introspective are realizing their child lacks the maturity to play this game.
---
It's not in the game yet. Inside the vault showed repair kits where one you can get in the atom shop and the better one can be obtained by playing events 
---
Why would you go into a raid at 50% health? That's your own fault. Stop trying to make up excuses. It's the equivalent of going in with 50 bullets, with no aid, or trying to play with only your feet. You can make excuses until you turn blue - it's just an alternative to something that makes more sense. 
---
This sounds ridiculous, but it's still a possiblility. Imagine the Vaults get released, and part of the "challenge" in them is that there is no workbenches, so you can't repair unless you have a repair kit. So now you either have to grind out who knows how many hours to get advanced repair kits from a few sources, or just pay a quick $5 bucks and boom, you got yourself a bunch of repair kits, now rhe challenge is easier.
---
Does it break the game? No, does it go into territory that Bethesda really shouldn't go, 100% yes.
---
This is just a small QOL DLC. You can still repair, you can still find advanced repair kits in game, you can still buy these with earned atoms, you can use perks to offset the cost &amp; cnd of repairing as well as the usage cnd.
---
This isn't a big deal.
---
That's fair. Lol.  
---
I forgot about chameleon!!! I focus stealth on mine anyways so that would be an amazing addition!
---

---
Welp. It's not quite that bad, but it's a slippery slope... https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b9e31i/danger_sign_repair_kits_noncosmetic_item_will_be/
---
Yeah, I agree...I repair to 200% and wouldn't really ever need these.  It's the 'next thing' that is concerning to me.
---
We will have to wait and see...but an example of something that could really tilt PVP is any kind of aid item that heals that is not sellable/tradable/loot-able.  Players could load up on these and wouldn't need to fear dropping them during Survival deaths.  My mind just keeps thinking of of why the vault tec lunchbox is not in game.  I hope they never go there, and its that concern that I think has most people all fired up.
---
Hopefully but this would still be breaking their day 1 promise.
---
We can not get a sense of pride and accomplishment when we repair our items anywhere.
---
I suspect these will sell poorly in the atom store, most players will have the perks to get all their armor and weapon items to 200% with less materials and these kits can't do the 200% part. Isn't looting junk and keeping your gear in good shape part of any Fallout game? The buff kits dropping from the SBQ made me chuckle, let's put another shitty item in her loot table.
---
Just drop the whole game till they come to their senses
---
As they also drop in game it wouldn‚Äôt be a huge change.  You will be able to fix these things now regardless and it will free up people from having to hunt down things like ballistic fiber that are much harder to collect.  
---
Take it a step further: if your character becomes a monster in their attitude and actions, their character transforms into a monster in full. They become a [level] [creature] based on their perks completely out of their control that roams the wastelands in [insert appropriate area of the game here] with their character's name. The reward: start over at level 1. Welcome to karmic consequences.
---
Thanks! And I will be interested to see how these work. 
---
"Repair kits cost 500 caps for each one-time use.  Advanced repair kits are a 1% drop from SBQ"
---
That will piss me off pretty badly.
---
"For 50 caps, you can unlock the plan for repair kits, which will be craftable in your workshop.  Advanced repair kits are world drops, found commonly on elites like the SBQ, and more rarely from mid- - to high-level mobs."
---
That won't bother me at all.  Still stupid, but a pretty low-level stupid.
---
So, which one is going into the game?  Let me know.
---
To be honest, my current low level's .308 hunting rifle seems to last a lot longer now than I remember my first characters doing. 
---
I don't have have any experience with the weapons that everyone have been complaining about though so I am not sure how durable those weapons are currently. 
---
Odd it used to, unless they changed it...
---
I remember a post of ppl that datamined and found something about the lunchbox. 
---
At this point we are all far past pleasantries with Bethesda
---
You guys know there's literally nothing they can do now to fix this right?
---
Just the fact that they've written somewhere that they will sell them in the atom store is enough for all the youtubers to make their videos. They're going to absolutely destroy this game.
---
Speaking of DLC, when is one coming out that prioritizes fixing up all the building issues!
---
Honestly the entire system for Survival is kind of broken, the higher your level the more caps you lose, so i don't blame people for stashing away their caps. Losing over 300 caps on death from getting one shotted with a TSE weapon isn't fun. If they just scrapped the whole lose caps on death survival would be pretty fun. But as for now it just punishes high level players for playing with barely any benefits.
---
With repair kits, you won't need to use those perks any more.  Now you can use something else instead and get a different advantage.
---
This could make almost all durability perks worthless in exchange for cash.
---
The key point here is supervised. In the post that inspired this one, if the parent had been with the kid while the kid was building, he could have server hopped when the grieving started. I have no problem with kids playing Fallout, My issue is when the Mom checks in on them 30 minutes later and the kid has joined our group chat (not invited in) and she yells at US for what we are saying when we have no idea the person who joined is a kid. Yes, a real example from my playing. If the Mom had been there supervising the play, she could have stopped the situation from happening instead of blaming my group for our topic choices. If you let your kid play Mature games, Mature things can happen. Its your job as a parent to be there if it does.
---
How about rain coming through roofs...that one really gets me
---
I like this but instead of the armor penalty I say you just get booted. This may sound petty but I don't want anyone running around getting that XP boost if they aren't risking anything lol. 
---
If you have 300 caps left, and you decide to stay in survival, your rolling the dice. If you get killed and your caps get drained you get booted, and can't play survival until you go back into adventure mode and  make enough caps. 
---
I know, sorry DR was the wrong word... I mean it IS damage resist, it's just a % applied after armor instead of being the actual damage resist stat.
---
So are you saying you can still achieve godmode without wearing assassin? I've hit people with full assn/sent for 1600+ damage in one shot and they took zero noticeable damage.
---
It's not as showy, but here's my favourite conduit trick - why ruin the immersion with a bulky power pylon when you can just [snap a conduit to an existing power pole](https://i.imgur.com/8bFaI6D.jpg)?
---
There‚Äôs a large area of the forest that cannot be nuked so you could put your camp in the forest region if you are really worried, most people just nuke specific areas for the enemies or flux that it produces e.g cranberry bog fissure prime for the scorchbeast Queen, whitesprings golf club for hardened mass, irradiated fluids, glowing mass and glowing ghouls, flux etc, wavy Willard‚Äôs in the toxic valley for flux and sometimes you see the east of Morgantown being nuked. It takes time and resources to go through a nuke silo and launch one so good value locations are the ones that are popular. If you play adventure mode and stay clear of survival mode a player that fires upon you will do zero damage unless you shoot back without pacifist enabled so after lvl 5 when auto pacifist turns off go into settings and turn pacifist on.  Public Workshops are P.V.P areas so don‚Äôt claim them unless you feel you want to engage in fighting other players and you‚Äôll be fine.
---
One requires cash the other regular old caps?
---
I got handed a set of t51 with jet pack and a tse lever action when I was like level 30 or so. The tse is level 25, wish I could raise it now that I'm level 90.
---
You *could* just setup a pass-through conduit with a wall then blueprint it
---
Right!? How about just a simple through wall conduit with a wire connector on each side like this
---
&lt;--&gt;
---
Simple
---
They should be able to defend themselves, just not initiate.
---
I have been trying to limp by with my shop for over a month now without vending and its honestly laborious and in no way fun.  Like a sad old antique shop on a dusty old road in the middle of nowhere...  I agree that I'd rather have a system that isn't broken by waiting but they shouldn't have put it so high up in the original roadmap if they knew that it was too complicated to release that soon. An extra month is a lot of extra time in terms of a game like this.  If there is even a small issue when patch 9 comes out they better be prepared for the rage.
---
I'm reading that the repair kits are a plan purchased for atoms in the shop.  If that's reasonably priced, I don't hate it too much.
---
If they're purchased as one-use items (which the wording does *not* lead me to believe), I'll have some serious issues.  Especially if the advanced ones are unreasonably rare.
---
Yeah I guess thats one thing to look out for, weapon decay rates.
---
I also consume a lot of games but I remember the Atomic shop as being pitched for only cosmetic. And the better varients seem to only be gotten through extreme circumstances like the SBQ. I mean cool, right? But the process of going through nuke silos is so ridiculously long and not everywhere is there a workbench plus doing it solo? Those armour pen. Mr Gutsys do a whole number on armour. As much as I‚Äôd love to say that I‚Äôll accept only repair kits in atomic shop, I can‚Äôt trust that‚Äôll be it without some other intention... I dunno its a feeling I can‚Äôt shake, I have for sure mixed feelings on this, but overall I just scream ‚ÄúGod No Please No‚Äù
---
They added 1 fucking inconsequential repair kit and you made 3 billion assumptions. 
---
Premium currency, out of game vs Caps, in game.   I don't see whats so complicated.
---
Blah .. Don't care as I wont use this "gasp" Unless they realize no one is buying them and decide to make guns break after every 5 shots so that we are forced to do use repair kits  .. LOL ... jking 
---
Why is Bethesda starting to sound like a politician ..  "We have heard the people and we are going to give the people what they want " here is a repair kit .. Umm I never asked for a repair kit . I asked for a glitch free, crash free , entertainment fest.. 
---
Agreed. I plan to once the god builds get a healthy nerf. Whoever down in BGS Austin thought letting people go in with full built characters needs to be taken out back. 
---
It‚Äôs cool don‚Äôt get me wrong.  But when are people really going to use a repair kit? Fighting Queenie? Maybe. Nonstop pvp? 100%. Truly living off the land. 
---
Instead of adding semi useless content fix what‚Äôs currently being complained about. It‚Äôs not that hard. Screw what the dev bosses say. 
---
Everyone is too upset about repair kits and no one actually plays survival so this probably won't get noticed for a while. :(
---
It still breaks thier promise to the player base that they would never sell gameplay items in the shop.  This is just opening them up to put more significant items in the shop later until the game turns into a pay to win mess just like any other game that offers gameplay advantages for paying players
---
Glad to help üëç I honestly can't remember all the mutations I have off the top of my head, but I focused on the ones that benefit ranged, and I went down the path of "Well, this one already brings my strength to 1, so might as well add this one too since it's only downside is lower strength..." It was a very "if you give a mouse a cookie" sort of progression haha
---
Shhhhh secret time: Conduit lights don't count towards the new camp light limit.
---
People have gone into the SBQ fight with 200% durability items that break during the fight, so being prepared doesn't prevent it from happening.
---
Just log out at Camp McClintok ,  and server hop for these 3 locations:
---
1. Inside the building near the lockers on the 1st floor, NOT in the locker should be a ballistic bag
---
then run outside to the right, past the porto johns to the barracks
---
2. Outside the 2nd barracks building should always be a military duct tape roll
---
3. Inside the 2nd barracks against the back wall is another bag
---
Also, the Silos, Alpha, Beta and Charlie often ,though not always, have ballistic fiber bags inside before you even enter the main silo on the left behind you after you enter - and you don't need a nuclear key card to enter or even to have done the enclave mission - its right in that main room ( caveat, sometimes ) 
---
In Fallout 4 it used to be so that if you connect a wire to a conduit placed on a wall, the wall became 'electrified', meaning it gave electricity to surrounding objects, but you could also place a conduit on the exact other side and have power flow through it too.
---
I have no idea why they didn't enable that in 76.
---
LOL best description of Pete I've ever heard.
---
Lol. You know what would he a great idea team? 
---
What's that boss? 
---
If we trolled the players and made them pay for items they don't really need. ü§£üòÇüòÇ
---
Of course I do run around with the respective perks to decrease breakage on my weapons. But I know not everyone does that. So I really only run into broken weapons with queen fights. But still. Pretty funny. 
---
Depends on the build you have but If you end up not wanting it, I‚Äôd like to buy it. 
---
That is besides the point. Bethesda stated that the Atom Shop will have purely COSMETIC items and nothing that will effect gameplay. People will be able to use their money to change the way people play the game. The fact that you are okay with it basically means you are okay with Bethesda going back on their word and support micro transactions in their game.This item being pay to win or not isnt the point here. 
---
Here's how you fix it, first take them off the atomic shop, second make them tradable between players and rare at npc traders, finally make them an event prize.
---
Hope it‚Äôs just the bottle cap mine or a skin for doggie bags. 
---
The Survival double XP event is currently intended to be live and we're looking into this. Thanks for the report!
---
I was going to post the same thing lol
---
Has anyone proved this works yet?
---
If so ima put it on NukaCrypt.
---
Unstoppables controversy?
---
I don't really care about the pay 2 win as much as I do them dumbing down the game into easy mode.
---
Even if they don't go through with it, they've already killed themselves by even writing it. The shitty youtubers are already recording their outrage.
---
The point being raised is that this newest addition is not a cosmetic product, which was the vision for the atom store
---
I've seen drops from these (at the parade).  The corpse can be a real pain to find.  Did you find the corpse empty, or just never found it at all?
---
Of course. How can we rebuild Appalachia if we can't built villages, towns or even cities??
---
They will drop in game as well as be found in the shop
---
You should have given him ammo. One bullet at a time, by using the trigger
---
Definitely not a fan of this unless it's something insanely cheap, like 10, 20 atoms--that's a couple daily challenges worth.
---
That said, I can already repair at stations for cheap and the repairs will last me for a long time. Repair kits being introduced like this would be 1: an enormous fucking waste of your atoms, no one sane would buy this, and 2: edging on pay to win. It's always a slippery slope with these things.
---
# This should not happen, Bethesda. Do not implement this.
---
Uhhh. don't buy them?
---
Same here, but from what has been uncovered in the games data files (loot box like lunch boxes) I just cannot permit for the repair kits to be atomic shop items, as I've mentioned a lot, atomic shop was pitched as cosmetic, not cosmetic and repair kits, because they might aswell also sell disease cures since they do the same thing but just on the characters health. I only see this new repair atom shop pitch as a "Pay X amounts to speed up X process" like how a lot of P2W games work.
---
My take: If I get an asshole PM from someone on a subject- I edit it in ot the original message. Name and shame, people PM because they are cowards who cannot stand the light of day. Shine that light on them.
---
Nuke silos have repair benches in them too. Like I said that was simply an example. 
---
The game can 100% be completed and enjoyed without buying anything including with real money including repair kits. There‚Äôs is no paywalled content, no items that make the game trivial by spending real money, and nothing that gives you an advantage over anyone else. 
---
Dont patronize me on the broke ass queen fight, we all know its been broken since launch. 
---
Low levels make it harder - 
---
Queen disapears-
---
SOMETIMES she just stands there and takes a beating.
---
Finally fixed the 25 sonic boom attacks in a row. 
---
Doesnt drop anything worth while.
---
*Hi guys we noticed Anthem is getting all the hate on youtube now, can you sort something out so we are the game to shit on again?*
---
*Sure thing boss! On it.*
---
Try it out and see. Personally I love the 10% damage roll on a weapon. That and Furious work best on automatic weapons though, as typically you'll be one shoting with a sniper.
---
The ‚Äòmeh, don‚Äôt care‚Äô attitude will just reinforce that they can get away with more and more. We must rise up!
---
New and better camp items, posters, building sets, lights etc....
---
So much this.
---
&gt; It just felt shitty. 
---
Which is why those bottom feeders do it. They get off on making others suffer. 
---
I disagree, I think it would obviously be different, but I don't think it would be a mess. Both have their pros and cons, I guess the one I proposed would eliminate body guards in certain zones. 
---
Also, items do have levels already, and power levels such as Damage and DPS. I think you're making it more complicated than it needs to be
---
It was just the swarm (no mutated honey bee) , so no...I never saw a corpse...tried to look around for something but never came across anything that popped up as the corpse 
---
ok i will be on midnight EST
---
Instigating would be much better on that rifle.
---
Who needs degradation perks when I can just use my credit card to repair my gear?
---
Their child was building a house, hardly playing the game.
---
That‚Äôs it.
---
From the looks of this thread MANY people side with him (including myself) in the way griefers gang up and destroy things just to be asses.
---
I see nothing wrong with him venting and saying ‚Äúpeople need to realize that there is someone else playing that they are upsetting‚Äù.
---
I see nothing wrong with him saying people in pacifist mode shouldn‚Äôt have to deal with that crap.
---
The fact that you refuse to look at it from any other viewpoint than your mountain top of righteousness means you have nothing to really contribute. 
---
Thanks lol. I didnt see any of that cuz it was dark when I was there but that's it for sure
---
Indeed! Chameleon would be a huge QoL Improvement for sure!
---
If they are craftable they should never include rare or hard to get mats.  One of the huge advantages these kits will bring people is not having to server hop to farm rarer junk like ballistic fiber by crafting it with flux you are ruling out having many casual players be able to make it.
---
there is only 1 "p2w" thing i would be ok with them adding, and this is FAR from it
---
Yeah, I agree it's needed for the players who can use it. I'm not one of them so I should be able to sell you the ones I pick up. But according to the article, I won't be able to. So you'll either have to get lucky and find them in a queen drop, pay real money to buy them in the atom store, or grind challenges to earn atoms. 
---
I mean, dinosaurs were tall, if you were in a game with them would you have a hard time believing it?   
---
Houses that manage to not fall over being up 2 sets of stairs with no supports are kinda different. 
---
Perk cards only affect your character.  Once an item is off your character, it weighs the same as it did originally.  Hold your weapons and armor on your character and swap out the aid and junk weight reducing perks for weapon and armor weight reducing perks.  You won't lose those in survival.  Or make an alt and grab a friend.  Use the alt as a mule.
---
No. But people still put them out for that reason.
---
Oh I get it, I would be crabby too if things went down with this game like they did since day one. But a promise is a promise and they should keep their word.
---
Think about it like this, you need 6 repair kits at least to repair all of your stuff, a set of armor and gun.
---
I‚Äôm gonna guess that a repair kit is gonna go for like 25 atoms, and you can buy in packs of 4 or 8 or 16, because that‚Äôs fair.
---
That price tag piles up fast, and the atoms come at a rate of 500 ish per week, and, I have to repair ALL of my gear (with perks on) about 7 times a week (once per day), or around 42 kits a week or basically a cost of 800 atoms per week.
---
That‚Äôs a negative loop, and I‚Äôd never be able to get other items if I used repair kits, and that‚Äôs where the money comes in.
---
They should remove them from the store entirely, and make it a luxury you have to grind to find, which pisses off nobody.
---
The improved kits are really awful right now and aren‚Äôt even worth the extra effort.
---
Coffee, man. Coffee is my crack as a melee tank. Hotkeyed and hoarded.
---
I tried to play today and I got so frustrated trying to manage my inventory weight that I just quit - when I had bad experiences in the past with players being mean I didn't want to quit so much as I wanted revenge on them.  
---
So, in a way, the annoyances like how fast my gun breaks, how much JUNK I have to carry around to be able to make/repair stuff (because the limit on what you can store is low, when put in that context) is actually more upsetting to me than the douchebags who want to pick on me.
---
I mean, it is really upsetting when you have PVP encounters where the game is blatantly, horribly imbalanced because one player has found ways to achieve crazy damage etc., that can be intensely upsetting and stressful, but it's infrequent and brief compared to the constant dull headache of trying to deal with inventory weight...
---
They can easily be not craftable and not sellable, just don't put them into Atom store.
---
he spawns around the map, meat him several times in Charleston :)
---
God damn it NO ITS NOT PAY TO WIN.
---
Pay to win means you get bonuses EXCLUSIVELY by paying money with NO WAY to earn the required thing via in-game means. I'm so fucking tired of people saying everything is pay to win anytime anybody adds a thing to a shop that you can get by grinding out a currency in-game without spending a dime.
---
AAAAAARRRRRRGH.
---
(My anger at this isn't really directed at you, the term has been diluted and twisted for the last like 8 years so badly that I can't blame any individual for thinking that's what it means. I'm made at the hive mind, not the individual mind)
---
well shit. Noice!
---
I found that the other day 
---
More wooden inlay skins. I will happily purchase atoms for that
---
to ... 100%..... 
---
Thats useless to anyone above level 43   ( you get Fix it good at level 40, then 3 levels of it ) 
---
*Accidentally unload two shells into them. Lol!
---
I'm not. 
---
First of all I don't see the link you make with friends, you can repair your stuff on your own. Here the point is that you'll be able to do it in the wild.
---
And that's why I am not ok with it: selling a kit that repair your stuff for real money (that's what 'in the atom shop' means for a consumable) means this game becomes a pay to win. No need to plan for a dungeon, you can go with a repair kit.
---
No need to equip yourself for the SBQ, you can go with a repair kit.
---
No time lost when farming, you can go with a repair kit.
---
And the following lines are even scarier. Fridges? Other items through the atom shop'? Nuhuh, Bethesda.
---
But you had to be in a party with people in different suits. The more unique suits, the higher the benefit, meaning if you paid you could get a better benefit. 
---
I don‚Äôt play those other pvp games like cod or fortnight but I would also assume that 76 requires more attention to details and honestly some tlc. You have to stack your perk cards carefully, consider mutations, armor and weapons. Your armor isn‚Äôt just ‚Äúokay pick the one with highest ratings‚Äù your armors can negate perks, your weapons can be absolutely worthless in the wrong hands. There are so many different options on a lot of different levels. Another thing that you have to consider is that, as a level 234 with ridiculous armor etc., you can be killed almost instantly by a level 50 you picked a different build.
---
I believe the other comments are spot on, the bit so great release from bethesda didn‚Äôt help attract people, but fallout also has a following of nontoxic players. The game is t a pvp style, there is  a very long and very detailed storyline. A lot of people more interested in pvp style games don‚Äôt want to sit and listen to detailed holotapes much less, god forbid, do they want to read pages and pages of notes, computer screens, etc. they want instant gratification with leveling up, quick and easy decisions, and killing. A lot of killing, quite often with little foresight, manipulation, stalking, or tactics. Fallout is full of that I. A very large world.
---
Cost of entry to PVP should be u have a couple (x) hundred caps in your inventory...and if you kill someone the reward you get is based on how many caps you have in your inventory up to a specified amount ...if your caps go below a certain amount you have the option of bringing some caps in from your stash or getting kicked.
---
Makes law school really, really difficult. And law school is already really, really difficult. Lol
---
What plan?
---
until some idiot builds a base with 3000 of them.
---
It's possible there was one, but I haven't really looked for them often.  I kind of noticed one accidentally, I assumed that they wouldn't have one (for some reason).
---
It's also possible that was a fluke, and/or they don't leave corpses much/most of the time.  Sounds like something to investigate!
---
Nope he is just on the random encounter list. Certain spots you run across will trigger them. One is a vendor where you can get some unique plans for crafting and the hunters cloak.
---
Yongyea is gonna have a field day.
---
Diamond super sledge. 
---
Other than the respec scrolls everything else listed is a QoL change.  Only people who haven‚Äôt played ESO call it p2w.  It is extremely easy to max out a toon in ESO without dropping a dime.  
---
This is just catering to survival mode. Think about it. Never having to stop and spend 1 minute + repairing. Just pop a squat repair kit away. Removes the need to use benches. People who amassed their atoms at least. 
---
This isnt pay to win at all tho, I have 3000+ atoms and only baught the game and nothing else. I see the concern but this is reaching IMO as atoms are easily collected from playing the game without spending any money on atoms
---
Sneaking and hunting rifles are your friends, early game.
---
I know they have repair benches in them. But what about new content, like the vaults, or the dungeon they announced today? Have you played them? Do you know if they have workbenches? 
---
Like I said, I know it sounds ridiculous that they would do something like that, but repair kits literally give them the option to do that at any point down the line. 
---
The limit was not what I meant, I mean towards the overall buget they cost a lot compared to others.
---
Don‚Äôt buy it. If the majority of people don‚Äôt buy it, they‚Äôll stop. If the majority of people do buy it, then I‚Äôm afraid you are in the minority. That‚Äôs how this works. 
---
No he‚Äôs been here for a while atleast I think I encountered him in December so idk how long he was in before then 
---
It looks like Chameleon will not work if hazmat suit is equipped. Hmm will have to weigh pros and cons
---
Lol.  It takes longer to communicate "Here's a gift" than it did to earn the mask originally.
---
&gt; My take is that I don't throw a fit at Everything.
---
And my not liking non-cosmetic items for real money in a game they specifically said would not contain non-cosmetic items for real money is akin to "throwing a fit"? 
---
&gt; I can't really say how this will play out. Time will tell.
---
Then why take such a hard stance against those who are upset about it? You have no clue how it will play out, so digging your heels in and being condescending to others seems odd. 
---
&gt; Let's now forget you can get atoms free too. 
---
Ok? Can we not move the goal posts and stay on topic? They said non-cosmetic items won't be for sale, now non-cosmetic items are for sale. None of this has to do with being able to earn atoms within the game, that's an excuse and a pretty poor one. 
---
&gt; If people want to drop money on something like that....it's their choosing.
---
Ok? Again, you're adding fluff and non relevant points. 
---
&gt; Now if they remove perk cards to weapon condition then add something like this? That would be some BS. But it's not. Nor does anyone else have an idea what's to come.
---
And how would you feel if you were upset about those things and someone was telling you to "quit throwing a fit" and "I haven't dropped a single penny outside of the initial game purchase"? Just because YOU have no issue with them doing this, doesn't mean others don't. To take your opinion as the only one that matters and dismissing others opinions is silly. All I did was point out that they said one thing and are doing the exact opposite, that's called lying, I don't want to support liars.
---
100 percent this. As much as I love Bethesda, making a version of crafting materials only available to buy in the atom store is stupid. It's exactly like the various crown items in the ESO. You've made many mistakes Bethesda, but despite that the majority of the community gave you the benefit of the doubt. Just put them in the base game, no micro transaction bs. 
---
Make the base ones craftable, the advanced ones lootable from events like you said. And for god sake let players trade them. Adding them into the game but not allowing them to be swapped between players is so stupid and goes complete my against the grain. 
---
Stick to your promise that the atom store will only have cosmetics. If you really want money, then make the amazing content we know and love from Bethesda and the fans will throw money at you
---
No. That is actually a *very* real possibility. It has happened in other games. Corporate will definitely push for that.
---
Whoa, sick response time. Sorry I doubted you guys.
---
Upvote for this reply all very true 
---
It sets a precedent.  Regardless of how big of a deal this one item is it still blatantly breaks a promise that Bethesda made even before release day.  With them doing this now whats to stop them from adding much more significant items to the shop later?
---
If we don't let them know this is not ok then we could eventually see much more in the shop including items that do give a significant advantage.
---
Also, whats to stop them from adding something like a weapon mod to the shop and then drastically decreasing how easy it is to acquire the mod plan in game?  Sure technically you could still get the mod in game, but if they removed it from vendor bots and made the chance to learn it much less they could effectively force you to buy it through the atom shop.
---
Im sure no one really cares about the repair kit itself, it is the significance that comes with adding a non cosmetic to the shop.
---
I see a Doom guy build with this.  Plasma Rifle and a Chainsaw in power armor.  Rawr.
---
Hello, Harvard here and We Want You!
---
A lot of games do seem to start off with small items in cash shop before they go p2w but im not sure how F76 would become p2w honestly. I feel like the atom shop should just strictly be cosmetic items though. And they introduce the repair kits some other way.  Because I hope they won't do this with utility items that are actually needed like refrigerators and such.
---
It's a great idea,  just poor execution.  Should not be available for caps as it has a direct impact on the game.  Assuming that there is one repair kit type that can repair anything,  there are going to be things where it is distinctly advantageous to always use a repair kit saving you mats you would normally have to use.   Being able to buy that kind of advantage with caps is a big no no.  The basic recipe should be a drop or quest reward / vendor item like any other weapon or armor plans,  or the adv recipe itself.  No reason for basic to be buyable with atoms and the adv. drop from enemies like scorchqueen.
---
I honestly want to defend Bethesda, but in the sense defend them from I'm guessing is a greater hit (media, public sources, youtube, exc), so if rejecting this and trying to make it not become a feature is the way then well, guess that's gonna be it. And a point to justify it? I don't think they even have a valuable point, since a little birdie told me that E3 and other Bethesda talks they've said it was cosmetic only (Have I mentioned it was cosmetic only?(Can't stress enough that they said it was cosmetic only))
---
[Inside the vault](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eQmVlhbjlkX0GzGb7DB3j/inside-the-vault-looking-beyond-patch-8-april-4-2019)
---
They do more than one thing at a time.  Also there have been posts about it, just hasn't been a huge thing.
---
This stinks of a desperate cash grab, tying a user requested item to the atom shop.( which, for the most part features items which are very overpriced)
---
   Guess Bethesda hasn‚Äôt learned from the p.t.w fiascos experienced by other studios.
---
 Been stocking up on plans &amp; legendaries to sell, &amp; am not going to walk around for potentially another 2 months, thanks.
---
They should have been making sure vending was on target, instead of worrying about the friggin atom shop.
---
I read it fine.
---
The better version is not as easily available compared to the shop version.
---
What do you mean? What do people buy in game on eBay??
---
The repair kits are pretty common in mmos and games in general wear gear has durability. that is fine. they shouldnt be premium items, nor should they be sold in a market where bethesda themselves have stated will ONLY have cosmetic items. This is a deal breaker honestly.
---
I agree. Once they think they have tapped into a revenue stream, they will continue to add paid content that is not cosmetic. 
---
hmm I could make sure I was grouped, run radsponge and ghoulish and not use a rad suit... hmm will test
---
*shuffles in the dark while peeved about how long the coffee takes to brew, cussing out the machine out of existential rage* Yep, sounds about right. Cheers!
---
For what it's worth, any heavy weapons build with a good set of perks should be above par. Success (or at least, ease of success) generally depends on the balance of strong bloodied builds vs dead weight though. If the queen's health isn't visibly dropping then a lot of players give up, and then you're really screwed.
---
Same here, no double XP
---
Upvoted for visibility
---
I'm betting most of the people wanting this are farming constantly not randomly fighting enemies while exploring. 
---
But who knows what's next if we allow this? I am not fear-mongering. This is a genuine concern.
---
You get them instantly. 
---
And imagine this recipe has a cheaper cost to build than it is to repair the items you have equipped.   The weapons and armor in the game have different repair costs.  If they make this thing cost alot to build, using it on lower lvl weapons would be a waste.  If it's cheaper to build than repairing your high level build you're getting into pay to win territory.
---
Ya they're all over survival mode and keep dyin over n over with no aid or caps to gain..  it annoying really
---
So melodramatic for a goddamn repair kit. 
---
Have YOU played them? Do YOU know if they have workbenches? Not sure why you seem to think they won‚Äôt have any. But guess what? If they don‚Äôt, repair before you go in there and yet again, you still don‚Äôt have to buy repair kits. Crazy isn‚Äôt it? I know. 
---
They edited the article shortly afterwards to remove the CAMP part.
---
Hyperbole!
---
I totally understand this sentiment.  I've spent a long time gathering resources to building my camp.  I'm not even sure how many hours I've devoted solely into redesigning, remaking, and experimenting with my camp.  
---
During the early days I placed my camp under some tower in the mountains near Grafton Dam.  It was a good place, walkable distance to Grafton Steel and Dam, people typically left me alone.  Once in awhile I'd have a friendly visitor and on rare occasion I'd have someone tear down parts of my CAMP.  
---
Eventually I moved my CAMP deep into some mountains.  Basically, I found an area that was a pain to reach.  You could either spend some time climbing the mountain, but maybe reach it by a jetpack.  You're not going to be randomly passing through, it's not a chance encounter.
---
Now, I'm not saying it's impossible for anyone else to have their camp here, I did run into one occasion where a CAMP was placed in the same location when I joined a server.  Over the 150+ hours I've had my CAMP at this location, it has happened once.  At times I've had people make the trek to my CAMP, I'm guessing because they saw me on the map.  
---
Recently, I had my first griefer at this location.  These guys were purposely trying to grief or start PvP.  They went around back of my house and destroyed my fusion generator and the first water purifier that the other 5 were daisy-chained off of.  By the time I fast traveled back to base, they had already left, they too were either in high double digits or triple.  Everything else was left untouched, but they purposely went after the most expensive thing to fix.  Thankfully, I'm a resource hoarder, so it wasn't tough for me to fix.  Still it was frustrating because, Power Armor and weapon repairs ain't free yo!
---
Not wanting to deal with repairing and possibly more damage to my CAMP, I hopped servers.  I think I'm on the fence about limiting damage to CAMPs.  I don't want people to damage my stuff, but I do like the fact that people can RP how they want.  Freedom to play how you want does make this game great.  I play this game either with a small group of friends or by myself, I don't typically interact with strangers.  I try to be friendly, but I don't do any trading or teaming up.
---
I don't know, I'm just rambling.  I just wanted to talk about Fallout.  
---
Heavy TF2 build?
---
This is something we really do need without a doubt.
---
It never mentioned different suits.
---
Well, there has to be a balance. You are gaining the ability to repair ANY weapon, armor, or power armor piece on the go. The alternative is that it takes a metric ton of steel, aluminum, adhesive, springs, gears, screws, ballistic fiber, plastic, black titanium, etc. to create a repair kit. The tradeoff would be make it take a mixture of common, uncommon, and rare items to craft. So steel, ballistic fiber, and flux, for example. But you should be able to pick them up in game as well. They aren't a 100% essential item as evidenced by the fact that we've never had them in game before and everyone has done just fine. They are simply a quality of life and convenience item. Just like fusion cores. You can get them organically or use rare materials if you can't afford the time to farm them.
---
im screenshotting your comment as the most ridiculous thing ive read all day, thanks!
---
Thank you, I just logged into reddit and this was the first post I saw.
---
Now I‚Äôm seeing it‚Äôs everywhere haha 
---
I'm still not even sure all the repair perks are working properly, or at least they're not for some weapons. This is utter bullshit.
---
A delay means they‚Äôve been working on it, realized they have some issues that are best not rushed, and made an early call (rather than a late one, which would have had bias towards shipping a broken product). This is a good thing.
---
He‚Äôs one of the more common spawns I get when farming the first responder vendor bot. 
---
Also, be careful of height. If your building is very high, the pylons might be exceeding the height limit. That was what I guessed was the problem when I tried to do the same. I just placed connectors along the outside walls to get around to the other side of my building.
---
........ wut
---
Yeah see that's why I said I didn't know, because I have never had a workshop contested ever so I don't know how it works with pacifist mode. I've taken over many workshops all with pacifist mode on but have never had any of them conested so I have no experience on what happens. I am glad you shared your experience with me so now I know with pacifist on if I have a workshop and it gets contested that I can be hit but can't fight back. Definitely good to know. I'll be keeping my eyes open anytime I take a workshop now.
---
&gt;if they knew that it was too complicated to release that soon.
---
clearly they didn't though....
---
I wonder if they were not exclusive to the Atom shop if that would change things... If you could craft them yourself in-game AND buy them from the Atom shop if you wanted to. 
---
2 way power switches would be nice, so I don't have to use complicated wiring just so I can close my garage door from both sides...
---
The big deal is Bethesda going back on their word. With all the bullshit being pulled by other developers this year alone, the last thing the fans want is for Bethesda to lie. 
---
Weapon repair kits were a cool feature added in mothership zeta in 3 then restyled in new Vegas. Having a way to repair your guns in the field is a really cool and needed feature. Having it available in the atom store, even the basic one is a slap in the face to all the players who stood by them.
---
People buy weapons and armor for real money on eBay.
---
Level jumps, player resets, card packs, weapon/armor mods - there is a huge potential for P2W in this game.  Atom shop staying cosmetic would ensure a more balanced game.
---
All day. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm browsing here and found your post haha 
---
That's what the article says he says. That's actually not what he says:
---
 *‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt want to spend money in the Atomic shop for cosmetic stuff you don‚Äôt have to. We give you a shitload of Atoms just for playing the game. Folks that want to spend money on whatever the hell it is because they don‚Äôt have enough Atoms, they can, but it‚Äôs not, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm now better playing against other players because I spent money.‚Äô It‚Äôs not pay-to-win. And it‚Äôs not loot crates.‚Äù*   
---
I don't personally think that these weapon repairs kits are a thing that lets you play better against other players, especially when they are going to be drops in the game as well.  I get the cynicism, but when we are being critical of what people at the company are saying, we have to hold them to what they actually said, and not what a reporter interpreted it as.
---
Have you not seen fall out stuff on ebay tse gun used to sell for 20 bucks a piece before the nerf
---
surprised it took them this long to make it pay to win.
---
Huh, well looks like I need to contact support then. I was charged but didn't receive them. Thanks my dude.
---
Tse weapons
---
What‚Äôs the repair kits?
---
Just speculating, but the atom shop repair kits will most likely be dupe free. Can‚Äôt pass them to others, so only you can use them.
---
Exactly. This was basically his wet dream come true.
---
Fair enough, I agree in terms of business or when money is involved for sure.
---
Have you tried closing the shop and reopening it? Maybe try a relog?
---
&gt;Basic Repair Kits will be unlockable in the Atomic Shop using Atoms you‚Äôve purchased or those you‚Äôve earned for free by completing in-game challenges.
---
u/BethesdaGameStudios_, don't break your promise please.
---
NO NON-COSMETIC ITEMS ATOMIC SHOP
---
There will always be tests from the business side of this. From things like free season passes with new copies to paid seasons passes purchased separately. The business dynamic always changes but the market will never see it go absurd.
---
But again, it's not pay to win unless you're actively competing against another user.
---
For real, as if repairing was a burden in the first place.
---
Yeah but as u/Ragdoll_Knighit also agrees with (Bess you sir knight), Atomic shop was cosmetic only. And lets say Bethesda ignored all the complaints and added them and it was successful to a degree? What makds you think they‚Äôll stop there? They could say that you can now buy legendary tokens for the legendary vendor or even disease cures, they do a similar thing but just removes a disease, why not sell that? Even if it‚Äôs optional, it‚Äôll spawn new ideas to try and con money, because lunch box loot crate sort of items have been found in the games files, which mysteriously seemed to have died down when outrage was on that...
---
If the game rewarded caps and not players pool would jus kill each other pmfor hours to farm caps and buy serum recipes. It would straight up be cap duping at that point. There has to be a limit on how many caps are in the world
---
Or just realize that there are literally no cons... Wanna be a chameleon? Take off the hazmat suit. Don't wanna be a chameleon? Put on the hazmat suit! Don't think there's much else to it lol
---
There's just some cool stuff in the shop now that I can't imagine anyone would choose to put off getting it, or pay real cash for just so they could get these kits.
---
I don't see the value in them.  
---
The slippery slope of pay to win stuff is a whole other issue that I really wasn't even thinking of.
---
Some people I'm sure have emotional problems, stress, abuse, etc. and want to inflict pain on others. 
---
For me personally, I want to be able to just do whatever I want in the *game* and not have to worry that somebody is gonna be really hurt *in real life*.
---
In this game, in PVP fights, it does seem like a lot of people are [more] upset when they lose - more than some other games like Fortnite or PUBG where you are nearly constantly being killed.
---
I also understand how it's upsetting to have a camp destroyed - particularly if you don't have materials saved up and ready to do all the repairs.
---
One thing that's most upsetting (to me anyway) is when you're by yourself and a group of much higher level characters comes by and destroys your base, or whatever, and there's just nothing you can do - it's really upsetting in particular, that you can't even rely on something like a Mini Nuke as a last ditch desperation tool for revenge.  
---
No player, under any circumstances ever, should be able to withstand a point blank mini nuke.  Even a level 10 character with the most basic version should be able to obliterate a max level full "assasins sentinal" whatever armor setup with the mini nuke and if they've destroyed your base, the first hit should do full damage.  I dropped a mini nuke on some guy that had been destroying my base and he took NO damage - that was extremely upsetting.
---
Did you not actually read the article?  They specifically call out in the same section of the article that they're also looking into treating "refrigerators for C.A.M.P.s, ammo and food converters, and even the ability to send scrap to your stash without having to head home." the same way.
---
I couldn't even tell you anymore. AP regen was/is broken though. I would start there. The perk that uses your AP as a damage reduction + sentinel assassin gear is why it was OP. On top of having a good amount of AP regen items is why I was invincible to ranged. That all changed after they disabled my account haha. It seems stealth is the new meta. Good luck.
---
Please please please.  Do NOT put repair kit plans in atom shop.  BAD IDEA
---
To sum up, what I don't like about this. And this comes from a person who likes almost every update.
---
1. The addition of item with a direct effect in the game. - Although we might like this and the price may be laughable (we don't know yet), this is like opening the Pandora's box.
---
2. This will provide even more min/maxing to people who can abuse and break the game with some more points and perks free.
---
This is my view on the repair kits with that limited information that we have right now.
---
Add me sgt__lucas
---
They're still accessible via earned atoms as well as advanced repair kits found in the world.
---
Weapons and armor. I can't post a link or the autmod will remove the comment, but as an example just go to eBay and search for "fallout 76 tse" and you'll see 13 current listings. If you scroll down and click the "completed items" and "sold items" boxes there's 144 completed listing for that search term.
---
Huh...ok then. Just never met him. Good think he dosent actually tell you anything useful, lol
---
I think it's more that, You need to get a post to front page.. With alot of votes.
---
Alot of posts with no votes, jist spamming New. Isnt gonna be seen by bethesda, anf instead is creating a Wall, that blocks actually discussions and content from  eing seen..
---
Dunno but this is my current problem with another subreddit.
---
Kudos for your willingness to help any lowbie. 
---
My apologies for the pointed questions concerning trade and help. 
---
This game has turned me into a jaded an paranoid game player.
---
Early in my fallout 76 game play, I have had people in the past attempt to initiate a trade for overpriced junk items, and not knowing any better I got griefed and attacked for not wanting to participate after seeing their wares. At first I was shocked that someone wanting to trade was trying to kill me!
---
These experiences have made me very cautious so much so that, anyone near my camp gets blocked.
---
Anyone WANTED gets blocked. Anyone at train stations  who are AFK get blocked. Lolz
---
Sorry for the rant.
---
This is how I do it, it makes everything look so much cleaner 
---
The point is that they promised us even before release that they would NEVER add non cosmetics to the atom shop as that was the single biggest concern when it was revealed.
---
With this they have blatantly broken that promise and are just setting themselves up to add much more significant items later on.
---
And then if we could add it to the cram burger &amp; sweet rolls!!!!
---
Nice. It took me forever to find lvl 50 torso and helmet of T-60 (had level 40 parts) but I think I found them in back to back days pretty close to one another. Best of luck on completing your sets!
---
Eh, so what?
---
You can either grind out the materials or atoms instead of using real money for a quicker solution
---
Videogames are cheaper than ever and cost more to make than ever, plus this game isnt even a $60 game anymore and its constantly being updated and improved upon. Where do you think that money comes from?
---
For one, I'm not directing that at one particular person. I'm talking about the general reaction to what seems like everything on here lately. I'm not taking a stance against anyone. While my comment might seem harsh its not to outright offend anyone. We literally got flooded with posts about this like it's the end of the world. People need to step back and see that this may not be a big deal. It's too early to know! Right? I don't know .....
---
You wanna win this argument. Go right on ahead. This is exhausting. 
---
The sad reality is that with how the atoms can be earned in game so easily, most players don't spend very much, saving them for something special. Because of this very few people will actually need to spend money to keep their atoms up. Adding consumables us a way to goude some people into eating away at their balance. It's extremely slimey and I didn't expect Bethesda to be the ones to do it. Hopefully we make a loud enough noise and they chnage it 
---
You seem really upset, maybe you should drink some chamomile tea and go sit in the grass. 
---
I do not plan to buy them
---
So NOW they learn to delay, eh?
---
Cav/Sen makes you take 43% of damage, while also adding Asn will make you take 29%.
---
Great now they're going to make it so wires can't go through windows. 
---
They‚Äôre trying to suck you into defending your base. Are you in relatively short distance from a fast travel spot?
---
If we don't get a big mountain man beard, I'm going to cut mine off and mail it to Todd Howard.
---
^^^Disclaimer:  ^^^I ^^^won't ^^^actually ^^^do ^^^this.
---
Is this true or only placebo effect? "Luck &amp; Charisma Affect On Legendary Weapon &amp; Items" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sNK2\_3yH44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sNK2_3yH44) 
---
They're a one time use item. It says it pretty cleary in their notes.
---
Why isn't it not just craftable!Now I am not gonna use it at all xD
---
I'm just saying whenever I've been on a project that was going to be pushed back a month, I knew we weren't making our deadline more than a week out.
---
But what will you do with them?
---
I just need to know if it's gonna be a plan purchased in the Shop or if you have to unlock them one by one in the Shop. 
---
If it's the former, that's basically fine. Player One with a bunch of disposable income can't buy ten at a time that way, as they could with the latter. 
---
I don't even really see it as much if an advantage (i.e. pay-to-win.) If you're in a fight with someone in Survival and your weapon breaks, opening the Pip Boy to repair it is the last thing you're gonna want to do.
---
If you're fighting the Queen and your weapon breaks, you'd have to run out of the middle of the fight to open the Pip Boy and repair the weapon. That's not an advantage, it's more the point of the kit itself. You don't have to fast travel all the way home or to a station, repair, and come back, spending them caps.
---
These could be used to keep said weapons in tip top shape but that's more the point of them than an overall advantage in combat. Being always ready is a luxury, sure but if you have the materials you can already do that. This just sidesteps the materials aspect and with basic kits being one-time use, Player One with three TSE guns and two bloodied melee weapons has to choose one unless they bought enough.
---
The one issue I have is really the breaking point. I love the idea but I'd have just added a plan for basic repair kits to all vendor pools. No utility items in the Atomic Shop. Just paints and camp items. 
---
Tagging u/Lady_Devann so they can see the OP and my thoughts as well.
---
Until you have one of the preferred apparel plans, Wood and Steel. I have the Woodchucker perk active (Can get at level 17) so I always have 800 or so wood just from walking around. And I set up my camp by Sutton Station where the iron mine is. Between these two I can craft &amp; sell tire irons or bulk wood to the Raiders (Sutton) and Responders (everywhere else in the forest) quickly every day.
---
As a bonus, on the walk from Sutton to Flatwoods you can grab the cap stashes at Helvetica, Gorge Bridge Resort, Gorge Bridge East, Agricultural Research Center, and on the hill above the flatwoods trader without much of a detour.
---
Once the April patch drops, they are combining all vendors in a single 1,400 cap pool, so you will no longer have to run from vendor to vendor to get your daily fill
---
Players would cap farm each other and make caps from nothing and further ruin the ingame economy 
---
So by the same way you mean it will be available both in game and in the atom shop? Id be ok with that, maybe some won't want to grind for it and can just buy it. 
---
This.  I was thinking this but couldn‚Äôt get the words right. 
---
and the advanced ones will drop off the SBQ and other difficult to kill monsters (probably from the dungeon)
---
There is a penalty. It's an XP% loss.
---
I think it's because the playing demographic skews older.
---
The point isnt the value in the item itself. Its the promise of Bethesda stating that the atom shop will be exclusively for cosmetic items. They will break it with this update it assuming it goes through and thats not okay. If we let it go, then it's our fault when they decide to continue adding more ways to spend money to help your progress in game
---
I had my camp in the middle of that lake below Eliose for a while, beautiful spot. 
---
It's going to be hilarious, when people finally realize that buying the Basic Repair Kit in the Atom Shop, only unlocks a crafting plan to make the Basic Repair kit, which in itself, only repairs up to 100%.
---
I supported the Beta and stuck through all the bugs duping and lack of content, but if they do this I will dedicate this account to nonstop hatred against non cosmetic atom items. I will quote them and post the video clip where they say cosmetic only every fucking day and I will @ every person I will until they fix it or come out and admit they straight up lied. Betrayal will not be tolerated.
---
YES running around with a diamond studded super sledge sounds fabulous 
---
It read ‚Äúfor each member on your team wearing a unique Unstoppables Outfit‚Äù
---
Unique being the key word here. 
---
this sub has literally no stickies. plenty of people have made guides about everything. its all just dead and buried. the mods here suck
---
So when I started reading all of this...I checked my atomic shop and I'm not seeing them? I'm on PS4. And it says I have the latest version?
---
Not to buy them mind you, but to get some context of what everyone is talking about.
---
Thank you, I don't know why the fuck no one posts a link until you. 
---
Probably check the links in like every single post on the front page right now.
---
I felt this on a spiritual level.
---
There are no pay to win aspects in this game, why do people keep saying this. The atom shop is purely cosmetic, and the repair kits don‚Äôt give you an edge in combat: you still have to pull up your Pip-Boy, pull up the description menu on the item you want repaired and then confirm the repair kit. You‚Äôll be dead by then in a PvP situation 
---
But there's no alert system. I don't even know my base is being attacked üòÇ and I'm in bfe man. You'd have to hike and jump your way to me with a known purpose. I've only found them when I go back to log out for the night so I don't get spawn killed the next day. Just to find guys destroying me base. My buddy has had the same issue. 
---
Ah shit youre right, i browse by recent normally. Goddamnit  bethesda
---
This is happening because they still have a player base after all that‚Äôs happened with this game - and there‚Äôs a correlation between who is left playing and people who will purchase this garbage, playing into their lie. 
---
It‚Äôs only a matter of time before they release DLC at a price and label it something else. 
---
Shocked to visit this sub and still see posts. Some many better games have come out, let it die friends. 
---
Try removing the wall and placing the shortest straight piece of conduit on the floor going through where you wall was. The put the wall back in and place the conduit receivers on either side. Now you have a lower profile wall bypass 
---
It‚Äôs made for adults, yes.
---
Can adults also get upset at this kind of behavior?
---
Judging from the other posts, yes.
---
I‚Äôm talking about Runescape 3, the less popular and original version if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre talking about:
---
TH , Bank space, loyalty points for Damage boosts, presets, coins for bonds etc, see ‚ÄúA friends‚Äù video where he maxes using only MTX as well 
---
Yea, the repair kit itself aint the issue. Atoms is basically expensive ingame currency and repairing aint that problematic. It is rather that now they add repair kits and then they add Mutations and then they add Damage boosts and then they add premium Weapons, like they have in Elder Scroll Blades, what are op af.
---
I'm pretty sure, there hasn't been a single Atom Shop item, that you didn't have to craft after paying Atom for it.
---
I was wearing the big Santa beard for about a month. I loved that thing.
---
It always has, but it's faster than it used to be. Walking around degrades faster as well. I walked from Whitespring to Morgantown and all the food I gathered at Whitespring has spoiled by the time I got there.
---
Can you post a screenie, because when I try why I think you're talking about, it wont let me do it?
---
I agree whole heartedly, truely. But in the mean time, the bigger concern is that your child learns how to protect herself and her work from these shitlords until bethesda gets off its damn ass and addresses these issues.
---
Or after being harassed for 5 minutes I took action against a wanted player...
---
math is hard :D 
---
I see your point but getting killed in survival is part of the game. Repair kits aren‚Äôt going to make you invincible. Someone bigger and stronger will get you despite your weapon condition and someone will eventually get them. Nobody is competing for worlds best fo76 pvp‚Äôer. Oh you died because someone repaired their weapon mid gunfight? Ok respawn and move on.  I dunno, Thats just my opinion. 
---
We currently don't know the drop rate, if it's anything like legendaries they will be seen so rarely people will be afraid to use them. Regardless, like many have said, Bethesda told us the atom store is purely cosmetic. What part of a repair kit can be worn by my character. 
---
So... I really don't want to come off as a jerk here. But that's kind of the nature of the game. If you want a fun, low-maintenance base-building game where people can't do that to you or your kid, you might want to play a different game (i.e. minecraft, terraria, stardew). But this is literally a game designed to encourage positive AND negative interactions between players. I understand the frustration, but I don't understand why you're that surprised.  Please don't see this as an attack. This is just my opinion
---
Apparently so, I just read the patch update, the bending will be moved to patch 9 which will be in May.
---
I wouldn't mind so long as it is also craftable with reasonable cost in mats.
---
Has anyone heard if the new patch will stop mob spawns from smashing up bases while in pacifist mode?
---
This is what I‚Äôm most upset about. It‚Äôs not just a couple days, or a week or two, it‚Äôs a full month. 
---
I‚Äôm getting tired of hollow promises of content and constant delays of basic things that should‚Äôve been in the game at release. 
---
If you can‚Äôt properly plan and implement something don‚Äôt advertise it. They‚Äôve been talking about player vending since [January](https://bethesda.net/en/article/5te3GDsV1eOM2YOKoyWoI6/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-1-2019) and hell, it was in the [E3 Gameplay](https://i.imgur.com/aOOlWNd.png) back in June...
---
Stop with all the hype and and advertising features we want if you can‚Äôt follow through. It‚Äôs going to backfire and add to the already long list of bad decisions. 
---
I'm not sure why we got downvoted lol
---
It says they're 'unlocked' in the atom shop.  Yes, they're one-use, but if the purchase is for the plan, and you craft them yourself, I'm less bothered.  If you pay caps for 1 repair kit, I'm much more concerned.
---
I believe from the wording that it's clear you're buying the ability to make them.  Whether or not that's the case is still up in the air.
---
I was just saying. Repair kits are a survival mode item. Nothing more nothing less. 
---
We all have access to weapon artisan for 200% repair. Add these? Might as well remove the repair function on the weapons benches. 
---
Careful saying the G werd. (Breathes heavily)
---
I'm not too concerned with the in-game effects of this. They'll basically be nothing.
---
But giving the hate wagon this much fuel is the single most idiotic thing I've ever seen.
---
I have no idea why this is getting so many upvotes. Are there that many dummies out there that don‚Äôt know about power conduits?
---
I‚Äôve got one red bobby pin...
---
Did you read the lines about fridges?
---
This is a step in the wrong direction and in that case we have to express immediately that we are not okay.
---
Having a kit on you, with the apparition of new dungeon, means you will be at advantage compared to people who don't have kits.
---
This is also not the Devs but the financial team trying to do a quick grab, which is NOT okay. Next thing will be exclusive perks costing 2000 atom making your Armor unbreakable. This is a no no immediately.
---
This is three dog aaaooooouuuuuuuuu
---
Yea man, most people wont. Until they start turning weapon durability down. An explosive weapon already doesn't last for 1 SBQ fight. How long before they start making camp items deteriorate on their own. Things like that..
---
Shear Terror is still slated for the 9th.
---
At least the other adults should be aware of these things, I can assume that a child (juding from OP's post it seems like a very young one), could get a bit more upset with events ungoing.
---
The new quest line comes on the 9th.
---
Maybe the fo76 servers are powered by controversy. All this would make sense then. ;)
---
I got it to work once, with difficulty. Rebuilt my camp, couldn't get it to place to save my life. 
---
but but,  they're taking player feedback into account...     /s
---
Yeah fair, i mean this does kinda seem like a slippery slope, but i guess since untradable and not 200% durability it really shouldnt be a huge deal
---
Only the player vending is delayed. All other items seem to be on schedule.
---
&gt; In last week‚Äôs Inside the Vault, we covered the Lying Lowe questline, item renaming, vendor faction updates, and turret balance changes, all of which are all coming with Patch 8 on April 9.
---
That's the thing that concerns me. Repair kits don't seem like much of an advantage.   It's what comes next if they dont get a lot of flak over this.  
---
When would anyone actually need it?  With the durability change on heavy I can't think of an activity that will break a 200% item.  Even silo/nukezone over 1-1.5 hours is ok.
---
Patch 8 will be on the 9th and bring the new quest, item renaming, the new vendors, and lots of other changes. 
---
I got both the large generator and fusion generator plans just from doing workshops. I didn‚Äôt even do the powering up event but I got the generator plans after doing some defending and capturing. I‚Äôve found if I log on and take 3 workshops in the forest right away you can just keep bouncing back to defend really easily and get plans almost every time. That‚Äôs how I also got the small letters plan(which is valued at 1000caps) and a bunch of others that would have cost me thousands. Only thing I have really paid for is the Nuka Cola machine plans
---
Fair enough,  I reread it and you're right.    Just buying the kit itself is even worse.
---
They've learned from that mistake and are improving upon it. This isn't something to get upset about and there are better hills to die on.
---
Would you rather they hadn‚Äôt learned from the launch fiasco?
---
Then let them, repair kits are unnecessary as is. The reason you‚Äôd buy them would be to repair, which isn‚Äôt a burden in any sense of the word. 
---
I would love to see faction themed structures flags signs etc. it would be awesome to be able to display which faction you rep at your camp
---
Yeah and I could then switch lone wanderer for radsponge in group play and not need the haz suit AND be a Chameleon!
---
Yes they are near instant.  Should also get a confirmation email to the address linked to your Bethesda account
---
I'm predicting another 90 minutes.
---
How is Whitesprings becoming a hub? Are they adding something? 
---
At the very least, they said they‚Äôd listen to feedback, and we know there are devs active on this sub, so...
---
Sometime this afternoon. He's prob already got the notes written before any feedback but "pay to wiiin" came out.
---
This is false. 3 players with the right gear and perks tear through her. We have tested this. Did a fight yesterday 3 of us fast traveled on the event. While all the other guys were walking to it. Killed her before they even showed up. Took us about 3 minutes 40 seconds to kill her. Dropped a second nuke immediately after. Let all the randoms show up and give it a try. They were hardly doing any damage. We turned on the gas and took her down in about 4 minutes. If you have the right build she is easy.
---
Aw do you make up stories on the Internet too?
---
There's a number of YouTubers furiously mastrubating right now.
---
The main problems are that
---
* They went against their statement of the store being cosmetic only
---
and
---
* Public opinion of this game is now going to get infinitely worse instead of slowly better
---
More people shitting on the game = less new players. Literally no idea why they can't just...I dunno...make some good fucking cosmetics so people WANT to buy atoms.
---
This has a real Borderlands feel to it.
---
Right so those + dodgy = 100% basically?
---
This is how software development works. The release scheduled for 2 weeks after likely is already being wrapped up, and adding changes with such a large scope is probably inadvisable. Next open window is likely the release 4 weeks after.
---
Got it. Thanks !
---
Again I 100% agree with you and a lot of players are here because it‚Äôs the newest fallout game right now and just want to play alone and get upset when killed and such cause they don‚Äôt play all the pvp games out there . They just like fallout and it‚Äôs new. Also I agree and I think it‚Äôs the bigger problem it‚Äôs the groups of very high lvl players wreaking lower level players and multiple times until the player just quits and leaves they literally have no defence but to log out.  And yes it‚Äôs the way the game is played but when it‚Äôs 4 against 1 and they don‚Äôt stop until you quit is to me the definition of bullying and can be emotionally harmful and stressful  to others.  I myself enjoy helping others.
---
I think toxic Valley was, more or less, meant to be a lower level area to explore. You‚Äôll notice the enemies are low level but can still be brutal, the area is made for the next few steps after exploring the forest area. There is a lot to do there for sure but I think it‚Äôs underwhelming so it‚Äôs not too overwhelming for new players. 
---
There is a trick to running wires through solid objects. Something to do with attaching wires to a connector that you place on a rug. Then move the rug with connector on it and it doesn't check for collisions on the wires
---
It's too late, people already made up their mind.
---
I‚Äôve seen many people here ask for repair kits.
---
So both the vendor consolidation in White Springs AND the player vending is now patch 9? The former won't be in patch 8? 
---
Still not even a hint of the CAMP decorating with junk?
---
Im still waiting on the damn war pestilence and the other 2 power armour skins, ready to drop money if i have to. Idk why they dont just make more of that sorta thing, since everyone seems to love em
---
I still don‚Äôt get why you are upset that he wrote an essay.
---
Who cares?
---
He‚Äôs allowed to be upset, he‚Äôs allowed to vent (especially when he thought pacifist mode protected your hone already).
---
You don‚Äôt have any empathy, ok fine. Move on.
---
He‚Äôs not wrong in his opinion.
---
You aren‚Äôt wrong in yours.
---
Just understand that people don‚Äôt play fallout 76 all for the same reason.
---
Some people just like the crafting and building portion, they don‚Äôt take to people destroying what they built.
---
It‚Äôs understandable.
---
Plus you have to open the Pip Boy, inspect, hit repair, and close the Pip Boy. That's what, ten seconds, six if you're quick? A lot can happen in that time if you're fighting a Queen, horde, or PvPing in Survival.
---
The Handmade does more dmg and has less recoil
---
They are adding a bot from every faction except enclave to the resort. To sell now you will only need to visit Whitesprings, without fast traveling all over the map.
---
For a game that has fucked up in every other way possible it doesn't surprise me some of you are still surprised when they do
---
They not out yet, one of the many threads has a link to the post or check Bethesda's twitter feed for the news
---
That sounds like it'd be perfect
---
Immediately. If you didn‚Äôt there‚Äôs a problem with your cc, or something else. 
---
I don‚Äôt care about the proposal itself (as I consumer I just vote with my wallet) but I do care that every petty YTer is now going to jump on this, making more money from the situation than Bethesda ever could from repair kit sales. 
---
But it does provide an advantage. I dont pvp but I can tell you right now that if you happen to have one really good weapon or one piece of armor with boosting stats, and it breaks in battle with another player, the ability to repair instantly on the go changes the outcome of that fight. Especially if the person who puts out cash is the only one with that new ability. 
---
And it's the principle of the matter that the atom shop was specifically described to us to as cosmetics only. 
---
I'd this small repair kit thing brings them in loads of money, they will absolutely continue to pump out game altering items for atoms only. 
---
That's a relief.
---
Aunt Becky must have talked to you.
---
The sad reality, is that 76 seems like an attempt to make a more casual fallout online, similar to ESO,which is made by zenimax, Bethesda's parent company, who i have no doubt helped the Austin team with development of 76. ESO has one of the worse microtransaction stores ive ever seen. If it goes that road expect what you said and more. Exp foods that are way better than anything in game, a special ammo that's far more potent that ultracite. Special camp locations that need to be purchased with atoms.
---
I have defended Bethesda many times as I have alot of faith in them, even now I still think they will make the right decision. Please Bethesda don't make everyone hate you again. I was starting to like not seeing everyone beat 76 like a dead horse on the internet 
---
Yes, but the brainiacs at Bethesda put the keypad on the wrong side of the Brick wall Powered Doors, and I like for my CAMP to look like a home....A Wasteland home with Defensive Turrets of course, but still a home. 
---
I see your point, but I disagree.
---
I think it's safe to say that their reps are on here looking for feedback on certain items, and with something like this, they will definitely be looking to see how the community responds. 
---
If I'm looking to see the reaction to something specific, I'm going to type it in the search bar. 
---
If I type "repair kit" into the search bar, and see one post with 1000 responses, that's great. It means a lot of people agree with the post, but it also means only one person out of 1000 was upset enough to go out of there way to make a post themselves, and put themselves out there at  risk of facing disagreement, backlash, etc. The other 999 may agree with the post, but they may only feel strongly enough about it to hit reply to something that's already in front of their face.
---
If they see 1000 original posts saying the same thing, that shows the opposite- every one of those posters clearly feels strongly about this, and has it on the forefront of their minds.
---
Not to mention the psychological effect of scrolling through page after page of hate...
---
Hmm, so repair kits...
---
If they are easy enough to get, and they aren't the Atom Shop monstrosity they're currently advertised as, this could eliminate the main weakness of the build. Sounds like the improved ones are quest based and seem like they aren't P2W. I'll be keeping an eye on this.
---
Can you add Scorched anything to it too?
---
Rusty knuckles is fun. 
---
I would loooovvveee, half wide walls. I would love even more 1x1 walls, floors, and roofs. 
---
Lol your a funny kid, can‚Äôt believe anything people say anymore. Got all butt hurt once and put up your walls? You got some growing up to do son
---
If you wait for the end to act you'll be to late tho.
---
Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
---
ME NO TALKY REPAIRY.  ME TALKY OTHER THINGYS.  OKAY?
---
REPAIRY IS EASY TO TRIVIALIZE.  PEOPLE MAKE EXCUSE THAT REPAIRY OKAY FOR ATOM SHOP BECAUSE IS SIMPLE AND EASY.  THEN THEY ADD THINGYS PEOPLE WANT MORE BUT CANNOT DO THEMSELVES.  OKAY?
---
OH ok....I guess I missed that part! Ok tks.
---
They should absolutely be able to go through open doors and windows...replacing that wall with a solid wall shouldn't be possible but that's the way it is...and it works...it's just ugly and you have to redo the whole window/wall/replace thing anytime you want to move/delete whatever that wire is connected to
---
ah ok, im ready for you to prove me wrong! post the examples of "many" requests for this
---
I know there have been some changes to sneak in the past month. I'm just curious is this build still up to date or are there any tweaks needed?
---
Radial?
---
Imo, the repair kits are in a degree p2w, because gun damage I believe scales with the guns health(and if this slides bethesda may incorporate other greedy ways to look as if its not p2w), and yes the atomic shop should only be cosmetics only, 101% agree with that and that they should keep their promise!
---
However, hundreds of posts, with no upvotes shows that people dont care enough about it to even upvote the post...
---
Anything like this would be completely welcome.
---
They can just admit their conduits are wonky at best
---
Build a tiny square camp using 2x2 foundation.  This can hold everything you need and is trivial to shift around.  It makes life drastically easier to just move camp when you need it (typically quest hubs) in the field.  At that point you can hoover up all the junk and get you stockpile built up.  This also helps avoid loosing meaningful amounts of junk, thus making death far less annoying.
---
Don't bother repairing anything until level 40ish.  Its typically cheaper to craft/mod a new set of leather and just use whatever weapons drop (and no scrap when broke).  This is really true now that you can buy full sets of armor plans a now.
---
I'm not sure I agree with the general consensus on here. If the only way to repair was these kits then yeah, but these only help in saving time and materials. Similar to the shortcut dlcs in assassin Creed and battlefield. You can always fast travel to a workshop and repair. In pvp it won't matter since everyone one shots everything and pve only really saves time and ballistic material. I don't really see the benefit of these, especially compared to the free ones you can get from sbq and other quests.
---
You are viewing this through a very narrow POV.  Repair kits will be a draw for people like myself whose lives prevent us from being able to play more than a few hours a week.  Getting rarer mats is an extraordinary PITA.  Plus most gear doesnt require rare mats to repair it so why should flux be wasted on something that doesn‚Äôt need it?
---
Make it out of adhesive, steel, lead, screws, leather and plastic so lower level people have the chance to make them.  
---
Exactly.
---
I haven't heard about this, what is going on?
---
Sure that‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs been fixed, sir. 
---
To blast the rocks?
---
I'll be trying this.
---
They won‚Äôt.  But think about how long it‚Äôs takes to check your gear at benches now. I can scan and check my gear in 30s alone. Then factor in the time it takes to swap perk cards and whatnot. Speed is now a factor in process and mobility is now a priority. 
---
Repair kits will just be the never go to camp again item. Maybe they won‚Äôt maybe they will time will tell. 
---
I mean that‚Äôs what survival mode is all about. Who‚Äôs the strongest vault dweller. 
---
I agree you can just take the death and move on. Most do and some need to prove that they can kill you back. 
---
All they need to do is make the atom shop item a 50 atom plan, that way everyone and their moms can get this thing pre Flatwoods. Reduce the repair to 15% per kit and make the kit weight a good bit of pounds. Make a fair but demanding scrap cost to craft. And keep the advanced ones to bosses. 
---
Simple clean and no one needs to go to the hospital to get their undies pulled out. 
---
Gamers rise up,
---
But actually, this is a violation of our trust. 
---
Wierd. I‚Äôve been lucky so far I‚Äôm also way far away from the common spawning points but not in an inaccessible location. 
---
My only attacks come from the wildlife 
---
People who disagree are bootlickers.  It‚Äôs hard to take you or your complaint seriously when you talk like that.
---
I mean, you shouldn't blame them for playing the game how they want. Their base could be easily destroyed by you or someone else. I get the balancing problem and all, but if she can't handle the game, get her a game where she doesn't have to worry about other players and how they spend time with the 60$ game they bought. I recommend ARK because it has a similar, (but better) building style to FO76. Maybe even Minecraft or Terraria. Those are games where you can play solo, and don't have to worry about how people play.
---
I Use Combat and Handmade. I dont drop my 50k Ammu i shot em away to kill some nubs :)

### REPAIR ITEMS ANYTIME USING REPAIR KITS
---
Repair Kits are new utility items that will help you spend more time looting and shooting, and less time toiling away at a workbench fixing your gear. We‚Äôve received lots of requests for Repair Kits, and we‚Äôre excited to add them in the weeks following Patch 8.
---
These will come in two forms: Basic Repair Kits and Improved Repair Kits. Repair Kits cannot be dropped, sold to vendors, or traded with other players.
---
Here‚Äôs a rundown of how they work, and how you can get a few of your own.
---
##### BASIC REPAIR KITS
---
Basic Repair Kits are single-use consumables that immediately restore one of the items in your inventory to 100% condition. So long as you have a Repair Kit in your inventory, you can use it to fix up a piece of gear anytime, anywhere, and without spending any of your own crafting materials. Once you‚Äôve got a Repair Kit, open your Pip-boy to find an item you want to repair, hit ‚ÄúInspect‚Äù, select the new ‚ÄúRepair Kit‚Äù option, and then leap right back into the action. You can also use Repair Kits at any workbench in your C.A.M.P., at Workshops, or those you find in the world.
---
Basic Repair Kits will be unlockable in the Atomic Shop using Atoms you‚Äôve purchased or those you‚Äôve earned for free by completing in-game challenges.
---
##### IMPROVED REPAIR KITS
---
You can use Improved Repair Kits in all the same ways as Basic Repair Kits and they are also single-use consumables. However, Improved Kits buff the selected item‚Äôs condition up to 150%, giving it an even longer lifespan against the trials of Wasteland combat.
---
Improved Repair Kits are rare items that we plan to award to you for free as you take on various types of in-game content. As an example, you will receive them as loot when you take down the Scorchbeast Queen.
---
##### BASIC REPAIR KITS IN THE ATOMIC SHOP
---
We read tons of feedback and suggestions from the Fallout 76 community, and Repair Kits were a popular request that we wanted to get into players‚Äô hands. We also felt we could try out something new with these, both in-game and in the Atomic Shop. As we look to the future, we‚Äôre exploring ways we can bring other community-driven ideas to the game as well, such as refrigerators for C.A.M.P.s, ammo and food converters, and even the ability to send scrap to your stash without having to head home. Repair Kits are our first attempt at a utility item like this, and we plan to make adjustments based on your feedback, so we hope you‚Äôll share your thoughts with us when they go live later this month.
---
I‚Äôm far from a Level 300 mega player. Level 45, I play in between looking after my child, working and life. 
---
I find the hunting and gathering to be rewarding and pretty much ‚Äúthe game‚Äù. Skipping resource management by adding this type of convenience item is insidious and counter to the game itself. 
---
Honeslty the caps lost should not be tied to rank. So atm I am all for this and fine with this until they make it a standerd 100 caps per kill or something. This is simply bad design that I should not have to make another account so I don't lose so many caps per death.
---
Not sure if it's intended or not but I  think bethesda saw that if they had no caps then they are probably getting slaughtered already and a penalty would make them get slaughtered more? It's actually dumb in that way if u think about it.
---
I had that idea as I was writing my post. I doubt Bethesda would do something about it if just one guy was doing it. I'm going to see how bright I can make a room... for reasons.
---
I love my combat rifle. I actually switch between that and my handmade. Different ammos, so if one gets low, then I switch. My TSE combat rifle is actually more accurate than my TSE handmade. Last but not least, I have every mod unlocked for my combat rifle, but only a handful for the handmade.. they are much more easily obtained. 
---
@Ladydevan
---
I would dump some endurance for perception for concentrated fire
---
Get ready for the new outrage - useless item being in atom shop
---
Then you'll see the real face of resdit
---
If they make dungeons long enough, and don't put any weapon/armor benches in them, then people may very well NEED these; particularly if they make changes to durability. If they profit off them, they'll be able to find a way to make you need them. 
---
Devs gotta do what the straw boss says. But yeah not the way forward. 
---
Yep
---
Game is nowhere near dead. Plenty of people play.
---
Also, nobody is praising this. But you're a fucking idiot that can't comprehend that people like something you don't.
---
What‚Äôs the functional in game item?
---
#9 #9 #9 #9 #9 #9 #9 #9 #9 #9 #9 #9 #9 #9‚Ä¶ did I mention #9? 
---
As soon as you allow that kind of reasoning to step in, then you will be the same guy in the end that will allow 50$ lootboxes in the future.  
---
Atomic shop, such as any other cosmetic shop should stay cosmetic.
---
First off, worrying about upvotes is just as lame as worrying about downvotes.
---
Secondly, conduits are incredibly janky...I've tried and the thing warps to my 2nd floor...Yes it's kind of a minor nitpick, but having walls with power connectors on one or both sides would alleviate the conduit bullshit 
---
where the heck did you find that machete???
---
Because it's a cool game.... 
---
Because you can be yourself in the game , 
---
Because you do not have to pretend you're a badass , 
---
Because you're character has personality...
---
Because In a apocalyptic world we have to reunite.,just like the planet we live on ,  called Earth...
---
Just turn on you're microphones and communicate. 
---
It's life Jim ,but not as we know it...
---
Maybe you should have your kid build in a Singleplayer game as it sounds like that is what you really want. Try F4 maybe.
---
Ah, alright, fair point.
---
Oh, trust me, I agree. But every time we figure out a way to work around some of Beth's...issues, they "fix" it so we can't do it anymore. Which means now that they know we can do the window to wall trick, they'll "fix" it.
---
Iv never understood this. The power armor has fingers not mittens lol so thats the deal with us not being allowed to use the benches in power armor. Was that way in fallout 4 as well tho I cant remember if it was in Vegas or 3 ? 
---
Time to filter my recommended tab. 
---
There are forums and other ways to contact Bethesda, right?
---
I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôll make that much of a difference, there‚Äôs a lot of trading areas for players to use outside of the game like on reddit, the people doing farming runs are likely already selling on Reddit etc, so I can see your thinking but doubt it would create an effect that‚Äôs noticeable 
---
Your a fucking idiot if you cant see where this is going. Retard.
---
Imagine crying because they sell useless items when you can just teleport to camp for free.
---
Do. Not. Fucking. Do this. I literally just started playing again since several weeks after launch. I‚Äôll gladly go back to quitting. Don‚Äôt be EA. Don‚Äôt be Activision. You‚Äôre supposed to be BETHESDA. 
---
Wes Tek loops a lot better than white spring imo. But on my 350 i can get 450 exp from 1 vertibird which is 8alum 6 steel i think... can kill it in one shot. So spam it. 1 ork is usually 150 exp. 
---
It's just to strange to think that it's chance. It's happened to me and my buddy Everytime we are on the leader board for an extended amount of time. Just was curious if anyone else was having this problem. If there was a base alert system I could definitely see them trying to lure you back to your base. But the chances of finding a single camp in all the map is pretty insignificant. 
---
Now you just look silly. Besides, you get atoms for free.
---
I have several down already, monorail has 10 bags and one gnome! It's a good spot
---
You could do it in FO4...if it's not fixed by now ... (Reloads Lever Action) ... Oh fuck.... I'm sorry....
---
Yongyea is probably a hot sweaty mess right about now.
---
Yeah, and I'm going to get downvoted for it. Classic üëå üòÇ
---
I would think that anyone running an analysis is going to give more weight to someone writing something original than they would to someone essentially just clicking the "like" button... But if you want to look at it that way, then take five minutes, type "repair kit" into the search bar, and go scroll and spam upvotes. Can you imagine if 100 people did this, and the community managers logged on to see 100 posts each with 100 upvotes? That's how you bring about change, my friend.
---
Smarty said once ...  Chally follow your heart till it stops.
---
Heart is made of meat. Good meat is not free.
---
Gotta trade so follow the trades till they stop!
---
Not really? The game is well known for crashing, and other people have said it's been crashing more for them, too. 
---
Shhh... redditors believe that they are the entire player base of FO76. You'll hurt someone's feelings.
---
But repair costs materials that are not always easy to find. And I need to wait levels to unlock perks that cut down the cost. Is my time not worth anything?
---
What a lot of people hate is that Bethesda broke a day one promise of the atomic shop being cosmetic only, and from my experience weapon damage scales with its health, so these can be an unfair advantage against other players.
---
Another point is that the better repair kits seems to be for big big quest rewards, like doing the SQB, not like doing forbidden knowledge. The repair kits are just seem to be a con to get people to give in when in a sticky situation, because cosmetics don't reap any advantage over the game, but repair kits do.
---
I‚Äôm with you on this and they should have just stuck with making them quest rewards only to provide more incentive to repeat quests. They should stick with the cosmetics only approach and put dev time into making them more interesting than just being simple re-skins to generate sales. I‚Äôd like to see weapon variants like we have with items in camps with new sound effects and animations.
---
I don't think anyone is okay with paying atoms for repair kits. Just make them craftable, please Bethesda.
---
It completely sucks, but at least you can get the repair kits as loot drops for free by playing the game. That way you don't have to use atoms at least
---
What system are you on?
---
Just curious, what do the cans do on the outside of a war drum?
---
Yes, Atoms you get for free which YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SPEND ON COSMETICS.
---
‚Äúit's just a store where you can buy cosmetics if you want.‚Äù  Isn't me just sticking my thoughts inside quotes, it's Pete Fucking Hines describing the Atom Shop.
---
Worrying? Wrong word and not even close. Surprised is a better one. Guess I was right. There are a lot of dummies out there. Yes a very minor nitpick. Good job. Building has been wonky in every fallout that has it. Get over it and learn to work with it. 
---
PSN name
---
30% reduction will still only make it about down to 20% of original damage.
---
whenever i eat a corpse, i cant help but say out loud "NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM"  ...every time!
---
I understood that the vendors were not moving, only that white springs would be getting its own cap pool instead of sharing with the rest of the maps cap pool
---
Plankman33367
---
&gt; It's extremely slimey and I didn't expect Bethesda to be the ones to do it
---
... really?
---
At least they're making the item into a loot drop from the queen and other stuff.. I understand the frustration though
---
Only the basic ones. The improved ones are accesible via beating the sbq and other quests. I wish people would stop over reacting. Not everything needs to be a crusade.
---
How do we tag the Bethesda people. I think this needs to happen.
---
&gt;Your
---
How about *You're*
---
Home schooling failed you, but I bet prom was pretty sweet eh? 
---
Things can change. Move on, repairing is easy.
---
All day everyday? üò¨ 
---
this is the sole reason I have tried my best to have a out the way completely open to use no frills type camp dont lock my water, don't even have a door on my shack with a bed.  I to long for the no camp damage update so we can really build up camps.  I hope you can impress on your child that most people are good and greet you with a wave but jerks will be jerks.  You have to move on and rebuild (just like the asshat that spray painted our community mail box) Myself and so others cleaned it off and carried on if you leave they win. Best of luck to you and your daughter keep slugging
---
Thats the idea, keep them all together. 
---
Wish they would make the size of Legendaries larger than the usual, so that they actually ‚Äúlook‚Äù Legendary.  
---
Imagine a dumptruck sized bee swarm! Now THATS Legendary!!
---
(and oh yea, they should all be three stars)
---
Can't wait to make my way to a train station and to sneak kill any players who are camp-killing fresh spawns :-)
---
Or hunt down the #1-3 position players.
---
Unless he's in a third party chat system like PS4's party chat. The other mics get muted in that scenario.
---
Yeah good point they should award plans for this instead and the components for the plans are an amount equivalent to standard repair but increased in quantities slightly due to the benefit of portability.
---
you're right... just telling my story.
---
I‚Äôve noticed. I had vats at 100% and missed 1 foot away with a pistol. It‚Äôs either input delay or the server just forgot to apply damages.  As a stealth shooter missing should never happen. Unless something affecting the ability to do so. Which there are currently very little to do that. 
---
Starting a new character this afternoon and fully intend to go this route. Think I'll need that Discord link as well - need to talk to my fellow Zerkers!
---
Also, have you given the Ricochet perk a try? I haven't tested it yet but apparently when it procs you take no damage from the bullet it reflects. Assuming that's correct that's an 18% chance to avoid ranged damage. [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a7tldz/psa_misunderstood_perk_cards/)
---
Fair enough, but oddly I had seen all the other player requests they mentioned here.  
---
It's not about pay-to-win, it's about keeping the promise they made that Atomic Shop will be COSMETIC ONLY. By allowing this repair kit in the Shop, they are breaking the promise...
---
The problem is that it sets a precedent. "Pay to be lazy" can very easily be the first step down a slippery slope
---
YongYea won't mention that, though. And the masses that are about to watch all the youtube videos about this won't hear it either.
---
You could also stack concrete foundations in FO4. And build walls without floors. And delete stairs to have actual "floating" structures. 
---
Then why reward them with more XP and legendary weapons?
---
Jesus Fucking Christ you just won't drop the repair shit will you.
---
and meat stew for extra 5% exp
---
Basic Repair kits that will repair a weapon (or armor, I believe, maybe just weapons tho) to 100% without the need for a work bench or materials.
---
We don't know if the Atomic Shop item is a plan that you buy then craft or if you buy the item itself in the Atomic Shop, meaning you can buy multiple in one visit to the Shop. 
---
How it works is you open the Pip Boy, inspect, repair, then close the Pip Boy. 
---
This is a real advantage in survival mode where if your gun or whatever breaks, you have a six to ten second window that you open for your opponent when you have to repair said item. 
---
But of course! Just keep your weapon in tip-top shape to begin with! At which point, by using repair kits, your weapon will only ever be at 100% vs other players whose weapons can probably be repaired to 200%. 
---
But really, Bethesda said only cosmetics in the Shop. I'd say just move this plan to all in-game vendors.
---
Once they make camps passive that will be the only place for griefers. It cannot happen fast enough. 
---
 "  As we look to the future, we‚Äôre exploring ways we can bring other   community-driven ideas to the game as well, such as refrigerators for   C.A.M.P.s, ammo and food converters, and even the ability to send scrap   to your stash without having to head home "
---
This is all in the same section as selling repair kits for ATOMS.
---
Refrigerators for atoms?    I get to pay for less spoiled food.
---
Ammo / Food Converters?   I get to pay to turn that ammo I don't want into ammo I do want.
---
Send scrap to stash without heading home?  I get to pay to avoid travel fees,  pay for caps.
---
I've been enjoying the direction of this game this last month...  PLEASE,  don't go there Bethesda.  This is P2W territory.
---
Who cares ? only idiots will buy it  stuff is so easy to fix 
---
Google üòÅ
---
It's not mine, but I've seen people trading them. You just a 3 star machete and the mod
---
What if your bloodied gatling gun breaks in the middle of the SBQ fight?
---
I don‚Äôt think I could give less of a shit about repair kits. I have a main weapon and a backup. They RARELY break. Maybe once a month when I‚Äôm not paying attention? I don‚Äôt get the outcry from players.
---
how does some lame Kit affect you lol ?
---
Why not, nothing they can do with it in Adventure mode..
---
I added "new vegas" to the search to pull out today's comments:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/search?q=repair+kits+new+vegas&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all
---
Here's one from a month ago where they replied they would look into it, and they did!
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/av6ig3/bring_back_weapon_repair_kits/
---
Same. I've been making room in my stash for more ammo and whatever else.
---
seriously
---
If a repair kit costs 10 atoms for a basic kit, this seems fine with me. Improved kits can only be found in the game world. This sounds like a fair balance to me. This is not paying to win.
---
As for other quality of life items locked behind a paywall, if they make the cooler cheap enough to not force players to spend money, then I don't really have a problem with it. I don't see this as the slippery slope that everyone seems so concerned about. 
---
I do not think gun damage is affected by gun health.
---
As I said to another user, why reward them with XP and legendary weapons? 
---
A spelling  error is  minor son, when you grow up you may understand that. Is that the best you got? Seems weak...  well I‚Äôm doing real life things now son.  But we can totally talk later son . 
---
Pretty much, imagine if you could just buy a TSE handmade, bloodied axe, or mutation serums.
---
800 is perfectly fine. Just bulk the needed scrap. Don‚Äôt hoard on food, drink and chem. Invest in strong back and the perks to reduce ammo if need be and armour and weapons as well. Should you need them. Don‚Äôt keep legendary items that you aren‚Äôt going to sell or use within the week. 
---
No, the scorched mod is only for guns, I believe?
---
It's a slippery slope. The moment the community is "OK" with anything non-cosmetic then that opens the floodgates for other non-cosmetic items and features.
---
Mind you I also have no personal interest in repair kits. I don't actively PVP and if my gear gets in bad shape on any of my characters it is easy enough to farm it up, swap out a perk card, and repair it at my camp.
---
But hey repair kits am I right?
---
&gt;"Once you‚Äôve got a Repair Kit, open your Pip-boy to find an item you want to repair, hit ‚ÄúInspect‚Äù, select the new ‚ÄúRepair Kit‚Äù option, and then leap right back into the action."  
---
&gt;This sounds nothing like any  other item in the game that's craftable.
---
Well this is disappointing.
---
Well...this isn't a cosmetic item and, under certain circumstances, could give a competitive advantage so yeah, it is a bit disconcerting. For example, If I only have 8 points available in intelligence and 5 of those points are set aside for Gunsmith (for weapon longevity) I can now swap it out for Demolition Expert 5 so that my explosive weapons kick more ass and I can repair them on the go.
---
No, never. I notice the problem most when I'm fighting a big mob like a scorchbeast, when I explicitly DON'T want to stop firing...
---
I like it. Many multiplayer games have stuff like this. GW2 has it, it's not a power difference 
---
Indeed.
---
And then they go on to add exclusive armors, weapons and quests to the shop. They'll make weapons break faster to push these items. Will you still say "who cares?"
---
Hahah damn the salt is real. I enjoyed the game, my team has the first recorded Queen kill on Xbox for fucks sake. But Bethesda took a shit all over this game with every patch, every communication, and every broken promise. 
---
Could I still play it and enjoy myself? Sure, I‚Äôll just bust up some dudes autistics daughters base for rAiDeR kicks. But I‚Äôm not going to, because they don‚Äôt deserve the attention as a company any more. 
---
Have some self respect, boy. 
---
It‚Äôs the point of the repair kit, how could it be dropped? Repairy easy, thingy unnecessary, so you no buy. Should be praising their move to make the better on drop in-game.
---
I guess you should have said "I'm surprised this is getting so many upvotes" - but you didn't.  Too bad, so sad...
---
Get over the shitty building and learn to work with it?
---
Yea...fuck putting the onus on them to add/fix things...
---
lmao. Sometime, wait, most of the time. I judge people‚Äôs camps pretty harshly. I mean, I‚Äôm not an artistic person in any way but my camps are awesome. I know it‚Äôs only one aspect of the game, but come on people, you can do better ;p
---
No, I'm just very seriously invested in researching this game and this is my opinion based on hundreds of hours of research. Good rolled level 10 item is better than medicore level 50 item, so if you base it on item levels, you'll gonna have people wear low level gear to imitate lower power levels, and still be ridiculously strong. Bloodies explosive level 10 shotgun (2*) is infinitely better than level 50 exterminators rolling pin (3*). Best possible gear without corresponding perks is worthless. Best possible gear aligned with best possible perk selection for that gear without tactical control of the map is worthless too. The game is so complicated that majority of the playerbase, if asked whats OP and deserves nerf, will give you an answer that refers 3rd tier gear at most. Should your power level increase if you took psycho? Because your combat capabilities will be changed a lot. No way to compare F76 to Runescape where your combat effectiveness between attack 30 and attack 99 could easily be compared.
---
The first steps always do.
---
I had that feeling greatly today, but that is because my copy was waiting for me in the mailbox (new player). But I got slapped in the face big time as the update and install is still going on and will be for another 3-4 hours...
---
Handmades have been duped much more and thats why theres more of them being used
---
Yes they can, they can switch over at anytime with the after earning their XP or weapons.
---
i mean..i love handmades..but 17.6 pounds?!? c'mon!!!!
---
You're not the first, probably a system-wide issue (or someone is DDOSing them over the repair kits :P )
---
I've been leaning away from this game the last two weeks.. this makes me not want to log back in. I don't want to play a p2w game.. 
---
Yes, if it gives you more time to hunt good items or focus on generating caps rather than farming repair materials. 
---
Use my Combat to waste all the 38 ammo I‚Äôve built up
---
Yes but they can‚Äôt grief in Adventure mode.. no personal damage and soon no base damage
---
There was a limited time promo where players got bonus hit points for every member of their party wearing a different otherwise cosmetic Unstoppable costume. Only one of the set was available in-game. The rest of the outfits required an Atom-shop purchase. Some people gave that a pass since it was a modest buff and a limited duration event. 
---
I am on PC, I can give you one of each mask if you want, even a baret too. I will be on tonight. 6:00 ish Central time. My game name is tuckfod
---
Well there's people than genuinely like that sort of play that aren't assholes. It can be fun. But with this game I don't think it works as well. 
---
Alot of people? That's an overstatement. A few loud people. Breaking a promise? Not so much
---
And what if it doesn't stop there?
---
That must‚Äôve felt great at the time. Shame it would be pointless to use it now that you‚Äôre high level.
---
I dont see a problem with this. As long as it's not a power creep thing it's ok with me.
---
My comment was about bases being destroyed not about whitespring I could really care less about turrets farming some ghouls because I don‚Äôt even farm their
---
It is.  150% durability grants increase damage on melee weapons and increased DR on armor.  The fact that item condition grants bonuses, and you can obtain those bonuses with atoms, is a dangerous precedent.
---
It's not valid. Or realistic. 
---
I have been meaning to try that one! I think I can move some perks around and grab it to test.
---
Probably. I‚Äôll wait a few hours then might send Beth a cry for help
---
They haven‚Äôt been able to fix it in past games what makes you think they can in this one? You‚Äôre a special kind of stupid aren‚Äôt you? 
---
Pay to win. Especially in fights that are going on for a long time like scorch beast queen and you arent some super-equipped guy who can run around with 10 different weapons, melee, ranged and heavy weapons and can just swap stuff out.
---
If my gatling plasma is broken i only have my super sledge and lever action rifle left since i cant carry more stuff.
---
Having an item that instantly restores your weapons or armors durability that can only be gained from a microtransaction is fucking pay to win Bethesda !!!
---
Yes, or the entire community could upvote one Post.... If they saw a single post with majority vote... They wouldn't need to search "Repair Kits"
---
Also those 100 posts could just be upvote circle jerking themselves...
---
Multiple posts, muddy the water... It's like... If you show me 100 different, polls with would you like repair kits, yes or no. And only 1 person voted on each, would you care? no. But if there one poll with 1000 2000 10000. You would care alot more..
---
Either way, as long as Bethesda gets the point it doesnt really matter how...
---
But less spamming is always nicer.
---
The guy in question asked To Buy for a gun, not asking 60k FOR a gun. He stated he offered 60K or armor. He really wants that gun.
---
Yea, I‚Äôve been over encumbered for over a month, stocking up. Pretty disappointed. Actually considering a mule at this point even though I‚Äôve been avoiding that because I‚Äôm trying to play the game as realistically as possible.
---
No, as someone who buys maps regularly from other players, what the maps drop now are fine.  There is no need to add anything to them.  To make them guaranteed legendary drops is unnecessary.  Maybe if it had an extremely low drop chance for a 3*, it might be ok. Like jumpsuit level low drop rate. 
---
They're still being rewarded for being dicks that they can use in adventure mode.
---
It seems to me like it'll be like any other Atomic Shop item: you unlock the item then go craft it. But yes we need more details
---
If you don't care about them, honestly please just join everyone else and protest against them. As much as its a job you can do by yourself without spending atoms, what the real issue is that Bethesda is breaking their day one promise which was that the atomic shop would purley be only for cosmetic reasons. If they get to slide past this, they may slowly start incorporating some other things which slowly creep the game to be p2w.
---
Another issue is that in some cases, weapons damage scales with its health, so if you have a maxed health'd weapon (not 200%, just 100%), itll do more damage than a 25% health'd weapon, which can be exploited when it comes to PVP encounters, and with the nerf of perks that made armour and weapons decay slower, it all seems just a tactic to leech money off players, if the ludicrous prices of cosmetics wasn't enough, and as a player who bought this game for ¬£60 on day one with hopes, I ain't the worlds most happy marsupial.
---
You have a weird kid fetish my guy. Wait...wait are you not able to have children? That's ok, OP had a "special needs kid" they could probably lend you haha. 
---
 Pay for convenience doesnt equal pay to win
---
Do you guys remember this tweet? [https://twitter.com/DCDeacon/status/1032589221398282241](https://twitter.com/DCDeacon/status/1032589221398282241)
---
Is there actually a link to them saying it would be cosmetic-only? Because all I remember them saying is that everything would be purchasable with currency one can aquire in-game.
---
I ask not to be incredulous, but because it's preeeeetty hard to pick through the onslaught of articles and posts and info with this game, given the rough launch, to find that. I've been looking, cuz people keep saying BGS said that, I just can't find it.
---
Yes but not against other players. 
---
Completely makes sense why they nerfed durability perks and ignored the outcry.  And to have the audacity in that Inside the Vault to make it sound like they're doing us a fucking favor.  Fuck Bethesda.
---
Shot I still use them both lol. Ita the only power armor I have with a jet pack, and I use it pretty much exclusively right now till I get my x01 finished with it's own jet pack, and the lever action I still use for taking down groups of enemies faster tho now it only does 205 damage after the nerf. I was doing 488 before the nerf. 
---
I wouldn't care so much if the loot drop and cap loss wasn't so high.
---
Nuka Cola, Cherry, Quantum, Sugar Bombs and sweet rolls.
---
Especially sweet rolls. I think I fibally found the Skyrim Sweet roll stealer: We needed the XP boost
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure you could not craft in power armor in FO4 either.
---
Didn‚Äôt play NV  
---
Ya im curious to see what happens üññ
---
This is probably the fifth post I've seen about this, I'm still not convinced it's a thing. I've tried experimenting with and without Good With Salt, still not seeing some big loss or change. No offense to you or any of the other OPs, I just think it's really easy for one person to say they feel a difference and others to chime in with the same. If you're struggling to keep food then take Good With Salt. It helps a lot.
---
The point isn't how often you need to repair, it's that Bethesda promised they wouldn't do any PTW crap, and they'd only do cosmetic things in the Atom Shop.
---
They're breaking their promise (which I'm not surprised by in the least mind you), and that is why people are upset. 
---
They mentioned fridges, ammo converters and the possibility to stock your junk without moving to a stashbox.
---
This is already way to much if you ask me.
---
Some folks would say "no children of Atom, they won‚Äôt be founded until 2240 when megaton was built, if they do put children of atom in I‚Äôm going to quit because Bugthesda don‚Äôt know anything about Fallout!!!11!!one!"
---
Actually, there‚Äôs no real telling the folks that worshipped the bomb at the megaton crater weren‚Äôt already a splinter group or an expeditionary group from an existing group that had a religious undertones to their view of the war or atomic power. Perhaps a separate group that worships a similar concept called "atoms offspring" or "atoms spawn" or some shit. 
---
Folks forget to have fun, I‚Äôd like to see more content there though, for sure!
---
Agree, and I think it should be one of the strongest melee weapons in a whole game. To counter it's extremely high DPS, it shoud be very rare and expensive to craft and repair.
---
&gt; This is exhausting.
---
Agreed, have a great day
---
You're missing the point completely.
---
Pay for convenience is present in any game that has micros.
---
well those are 2 months old, but you were right, people have asked for them months ago i guess Bethesda really is on a backlog
---
But "if" it goes there then it's right to complain. But utility items never hurt. Again Guild Wars2 has far more competitive gameplay than this game yet it has items like this as well. It doesnt change power of player.
---
That's a shame, that'd make 5 stars.
---
That's not what I'm arguing against? My problem is that normal items are being removed for no good reason, so that players CAN'T buy them anymore. 
---
I know people have asked for them (they were also in New Vegas) but even when people weren't asking for repair kits they were sharing concerns about weapon durability out in the field, so this goes hand-in-hand with both those things.
---
&gt;But Bethesda took a shit all over this game with every patch
---
You're completely right aside from the fact that the game has literally only been getting better with each patch and you're 100% wrong.
---
Stop with the bullshit. 
---
I fully understand it, you seem to be the one with a problem understanding. The game is not designed to be a "safe space", pvp exists and is part of the game. There is no reason to feel even the slightest bit of regret for what these people did, IT'S PART OF THE GAME. Now had they known ot was a mentally challenged child behind the screen, they may have opted not to do it, but they had no way of knowing, and even if they did, they are under no obligation to hold back. 
---
It seems a large number of subscribers to this sub fail to understand the concept of pvp.
---
P.s. I'm not a pvp griefer, or even a minor pvper, I don't even have the trophy for killing 20 people. I will still defend to the death, the right for everyone in this game to pvp anytime they choose, until it's removed from the game.
---
Ok, whatever.
---
That didn't work either.
---
That you have to leave you PA to use. The point is this will lead to them making weapons break even faster to push these items. It's how it goes with these games.
---
Pete Hines said "‚ÄúAtoms are thing that we use and hand out as you play the game‚Äìquite honestly we throw them at you all the time,‚Äù¬†Hines told Xbox‚Äôs Larry Hyrb(aka Major Nelson.) ‚ÄúYou get them as little rewards leaving the Vault or the first time you kill a creature or the first time you pick fruits or vegetables from somewhere. It‚Äôs a little challenge reward. Atoms are used in our shop to buy cosmetics things. So you know, new outfits or skins or things like that.‚Äù

I've seen someone post something similar. 
---
It was Bethesda store exclusive initially.  So no, I don't give them any brownie points for releasing it on Steam.    
---
If anything it feels like a transparent PR move with 2 goals.  Capitalize on the general hatred of Epic Store exclusives and also try to sell a few extra copies now that they've finally got the game in a reasonably playable state and it won't get review bombed.
---
This is good advice, maybe I need to start stashing gear specifically for queen fights.
---
Every item in the atom shop we‚Äôve gotten so far hasn‚Äôt been the item itself, when I bought a jacket on there I got the plan to craft it, I have reason to believe that what‚Äôl be sold on the shop is the plan to craft them, which I‚Äôll be more okay with.
---
Lol, thank you for that.
---
Have a great day!!!
---
You must be naive to how the industry works if you think this is nothing more than me being dramatic. Or you just associate a business as your friend and can‚Äôt possibly consider they may do you wrong 
---
I definitely hope you are right. But it really sounds like you buy the kits themselves. We will see.
---
*Improved Repair Kits are rare items that we plan to award to you for free as you take on various types of in-game content. As an example, you will receive them as loot when you take down the Scorchbeast Queen.*
---
I'm ok with this however 2 out of the last 3 times I've "fought" the SBQ she bugged and was unkillable.
---
Atoms are free in game. Camps can be fast traveled to.
---
They want the mode to be about surviving not just about killing
---
Do you really believe that explanation? This isn't Fortnite, and the Atomic Shop stuff was never presented as a temporary roster. They already put out limited time items regularly. Suddenly deciding that normal items are actually going to be limited as well is scummy.
---
Which I why I would only try it on a new or backup character. It's way to risky right now
---
It‚Äôs not just loot.  I would argue anything you earn or acquire should be sellable.  That includes things you bought at the atom shop, perk cards, plans, etc.  Why not? 
---
It can be pay to win even if its available in game. Let's look at the recent Fasnacht event and the rare masks. Suppose those rare masks gave a bonus, but could have been bought in the atom shop. Yes, they are available in game. How many players were able to get them in game? It would have been a pay to win even with it available in game. Sure, repair kits aren't a big deal, but when you can avoid 200+ hours of grinding top gear for $100, it is pay to win.
---
yeah, lets have a talk about those mutation serums... ive got some news for you...
---
As stated on another post here, this essentially lets you ignore repair perks entirely - thus allowing you to spec differently than someone who doesn't buy them and creates a direct power difference. 
---
I totally get what you are saying and where you are coming from. However, that's probably an unrealistic ask as no one would ever repair at a workbench ever again. They would just craft repair kits. And it would make the repair perk cards pointless as well. There has to be a balance between cost and utility. It's unlikely they will reverse course on this at this point, so my suggestion of rare materials is to offer a compromise and maybe get them to reconsider. If we ask for them to be ridiculously cheap to craft, they will be unbalanced and they probably won't even consider it. All just my opinion.
---
"Upgrade potion:  grants 50 levels, and 3 explosive or bloodied versions of our most popular weapons (your choice).  Only 50,000 caps!"
---
Yes, P2W can be using in-game currency.  You're wrong about that.
---
The rest of what you wrote is spot on though.  If it's a cheap purchase for plans to make the kits, then it's not really much of an issue.  And in no way is this really a  game-breaking issue either way.
---
I'm a bit concerned about the direction we're going in, but I'm not (quite) convinced the ship is sinking just yet.  But without details, I'll simply reserve judgement until we know exactly what they're going to implement.
---
Lol yeh I realised my mistake, my favorite was fallout 3, but it was annoying, the repair system, thus said statement. That said though, I'm right. 
---
Well I mean look at the amount of people on reddit, plus on the twitter post of the Inside the Vault announcement, give or take a couple hours and watch youtubers blow this up and well.... it most likely ain't gonna be pretty, especially after the lunch box loot crate mock up found in the games file fiasco.
---
I mean if you just wanna suck up to blatant money making schemes, please be my guest and play Black ops 4, you can buy a glow sight for around $5, because aiming is convenient!
---
Narrator: It is. 
---
Unless you shot that higher level dude or were on survival that's literally how you were killed too
---
&gt;Bethesda is testing the waters for what they can get away with and a lot of people here are actually supporting them. They must not have played any mmo or mmo-like games before..
---
Or we played ESO where similar items exist and saw that it was not game breaking.
---
The point of the atom shop is specifically for cosmetic items only. Bethesda has stated and promised to keep it that way. not even a year in and they are backing out on it. Blindly accepting this just because its the norm does not make it okay. If this is okay, whats to stop them from adding more "convenience"? 
---
Yeah ok I made a dumb on that one xD But still currently you have to grind caps for them where as people could just buy them in the shop / buy caps
---
the ones that they will add now that adding that is profitable and this game isn't. 
---
I don't like the repair kit idea. People have been learning plans for months hoping that they could sell repair services when player vending came out. Not liking the pay to win atom shop spin either. DON'T DO THIS BETHESDA!!!!!!
---
I don't see any promise that it would remain only cosmetic things.
---
I agree with you completely.
---
I think people's issue is folks from Bethesda have said that the Atomic Shop will be cosmetic only. Allowing this gives BGS an inch to add more non-cosmetic stuff to the Shop. 
---
&gt; All the toxic people are back to playing callof duty
---
Let's not kid ourselves here - there are still plenty of toxic people in this community. Just look at all the people spawncamping in Survival, or all the scammers on trading subreddits. They're not as common now, but they're still there.
---

Obama hurr durr
---
what is that gun?
---
You can make 1200 caps a day, at level 1, with a higher level team mate acting as fast travel point/bodyguard (Watoga). So, I can have a level 10-15 (farming scrap, or a blessing of a rare plan for say witches costume or civil war gear) with 15000 in say, 2 weeks? 
---
That‚Äôs the problem though.  Mobile gaming has a subset of players called whales.  Whales spend FUCKTONS of money to ‚Äúbe the best‚Äù.   We need to NOT be courting whales.
---
The difference is noticeable from before actually.  I use Good with Salt but food does spoil incredibly faster now -- I end up vendoring most of it.  Sometimes it just feels like I'm playing game called Chefmaster: Wasteland from the amount of cooking and checking up on food I do
---
I DEMAND CHEESE WHEELS. 
---
We can agree to disagree, I'm just saying I know I would be much more inclined to do something if I got 100 separate messages all saying the same thing, as opposed to receiving one message with 100 signatures on it. There is a psychological affect there. 
---
 Just keep in mind that every little bit of annoyed you feel, they are feeling it worse. I'm okay with being annoyed for a little bit in order to bring about healthy change in something I love.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/F76RaidersOutpost?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Thank you for that.
---
So yup, I openly admit this seems to be a break from what was promised... but it still isn't giving any distinct advantage, still isn't pay to win, and people are acting like that's what this means, which I adamantly oppose.
---
Totally a different conversation to have about this, now, and they should be held accountable and questioned over this decision and what it means for the future, but still not the topic or conversation I'm posting this in response to.
---
&gt;  The atom shop is purely cosmetic
---
Except for the time it wasn't and this time that it isn't too
---
&gt; the repair kits don‚Äôt give you an edge in combat
---
Having the ability to buy endless amounts of repair kits allows you to skip repair perks entirely, thus giving you a direct edge in combat over people who can't afford or don't want to buy repair kits
---
Any more excuses for this bullshit?
---
ESO is free to play. This game you buy in a store for 60 bucks 
---
Damnit Bethesda, you know YoungYea loves beating dead horses, quit giving him content. 
---
DO NOT PUT REPAIR KITS IN THE ATOM SHOP
---
I beg to differ
---
Yes I am aware of this. My point is that it's stupid. 
---
I‚Äôve bought plenty of atoms because I have a pretty good job and love fallout so really don‚Äôt mind paying for stuff, especially if it supports the games continued development. 
---
Never had that happen, though support are usually pretty good about getting those sort of things sorted. Like those free atoms a while back, I got an email about them and *bampf* there they were on my account!
---
Great write up, sound like a blast! Hey, how much is your damage output on the Berserker Auto Grenade Launcher? I'm still trying to find a Furious one :(
---
Was it chicken little? Cause that was me.
---
We got over the new gameplay style.  We got over the rocky launch.  We got over the numerous gigantic patches.
---
I've been a hardcore FO fan since the Interplay days, but I will personally be done with the FO franchise if it becomes a pay-to-win game.  Even remotely.
---
Please, don't do this.  Don't be EA.

I'm enjoying the game enough that I was considering tossing a few bucks into the Atomic Shop for some of the cool cosmetics (Mostly the neon letters).
---
But if they ever actually add this P2W stuff, I won't spend a dime.
---
Im pretty sure they are, not by much, but I remember watching videos of Fo76 youtubers like CaptianNoob, and damn is he good at builds and weapons, and Im pretty sure he mentioned something about that, also other Fallout games which had the health of weapons did scale with its damage (Fallout 3 and NV), so it wouldnt be the same case if it was in Fo76
---
Is gunslinger really bad? I was hoping to make my next character a vats pistol main but I‚Äôve heard nothing good about pistol builds
---
Those guys talk to the dev team about content and changes.
---
They don't talk to the marketing team about when to not make money. 
---
We all do.
---
That's all fair, and I really do appreciate your thoughtful responses. Maybe I'm the one who hasn't realized how complicated the game actually is. I'm just tired of seeing so many claim that everything is unfair
---
4 caps/shell. How many would you like?
---
... what good will come of this? How can you defend it? I think if one supports this move they very well are a candy ass bootlicker 
---
Nah, if past Fallout games have shown us anything about vault born games it's that Tunnel Snakes only think they rule.
---
I don't really have a problem with this so long as they don't mess with the existing durability and perks of Weapon Artisan and White Knight (i.e. make gear way more fragile to promote Repair Kits).  Which is actually a big "if," because I can picture them dismissing that concern just as they already have for Repair Kits in the Atom Shop.
---
People asked for a way to repair weapons on the go,  yes.   Paid kits?  Hell no.
---
Many of us had hoped that a backpack variant would allow for minor repairs on the run.
---
Definitely send Bethesda support a support ticket, I contacted them once about an atomic shop issue and they sorted it out and replied within an hour, they were really helpful
---
They‚Äôve got ya. Might as well just hook yourself up to the milking machine. 
---
Unfortunate, but atoms can be free. Remember to stock up!
---
Dont use it anyways and just repair like a normal person? 
---
I agree, and that's my working hypothesis.  If they'd come out and *said* it's a craftable, I'd be pretty much over it.
---
Look at it this way...as they used the word 'unlocked', I have to assume it's a plan and is craftable.  If they come back later on and say that you purchase them individually, I'll seriously feel like they purposefully mislead us.  But I really don't think that will be the case.  I really hope not anyway.

Ok I didn‚Äôt know if anyone knew because I‚Äôm not on reddit everyday I‚Äôm on it once a week 
---
And yet if you "survive" too long you'll be killed. 
---
Another dude did post an article where it's stated cosmetic only stuff, so it's not wrong to call them out on this shift... but said shift still doesn't represent what many people are treating it as.
---
I'm all for holding their feet to the fire on this shift, for sure. But I'm not for holding their feet to it over something it isn't, by definition.
---
But yes as much as I hate the term, agree to disagree
---
I'm talking about setting the precedent that "we are okay with non-cosmetic items in the atomic shop"
---
Did you actually read Bethesdas post? Yes it will lol they even talked about adding the other stuff to atom shop. Go back and read it or delete the topic dude
---
I'm at school right now and all I have been thinking about is doing Technical data run for the brotherhood.

---
Why I have been upvoting every one I see.
---
All...Day....Long. 
---
But it will not cripple their database a month from now? Seems much more likely they just need a bit of crunch time to get it done right and well. Which is a very good thing.
---
Ooh, that exists? I gotta get loads of those.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt call them pay to win per say, but they aren‚Äôt cosmetic. 
---
I‚Äôm not one to call out a slippery slope, I don‚Äôt think there will be one, but it‚Äôs still disappointing if they are added to the shop.
---
That said, if it‚Äôs the plan to craft them like how every other atom shop item has unlocked the plan rather than give an item, I‚Äôll be relatively okay with that.
---
So what? A shitty practice doesn't become less shitty because other games do it too. This kind of thinking is why microtransactions have gotten so out of control in AAA games as of late.
---
They lack the maturity to play this game if getting their house destroyed reduced them to tears.  I‚Äôm not going to start empathizing with people who aren‚Äôt supposed to be playing this game in the first place.
---
Go play fallout 4 if you cannot handle sharing a world with assholes (even though the AI will still bust your shit in FO4 as well).
---
Yes, I have. Yet again I think you're missing the point. They might not have any because with repair kits being locked behind the Atom shop, Bethesda (as a company that needs to make money) would be incentivized to make it harder to repair stuff, or limit how much you could. They could easily design a dungeon that because of the amount of enemies, length, or multiple other reasons, make it so your equipment would break at some point during it, so you would be forced to repair. So, even if your "repaired before you went in" you would have to either use a different set of equipment, or use a repair kit. 
---
I understand it sounds weird or ridiculous, but it is possible, and it's one of the multiple reason why you should be against this.
---
If these items require more screws or springs to make than the item it fixes and/or only restores a portion of the condition I doubt no one would use workbenches.  Not to mention people would still use them to craft items still.
---
Rare mats shut out new players and lower levels.   I just hit 44 and have gathered maybe 5 flux in that time because the second a high level player comes by any mob I run into makes it hard to be there.  
---
From a business perspective Bethesda needs to think more of the casual player than the hard core.  Most of their potential audience isn‚Äôt going to have the time to play dozens of hours a week.  If they want the game to grow their focus must be on the casuals.  Things like this benefit the casual who won‚Äôt want to spend their limited game time harvesting junk to fix their gear because they managed to do a mission.  
---
Far too many people in the various FO 76 subs seem to forget that many players don‚Äôt have the amount of free time that the hard core do.   
---
Of course they did. In the beginning, when Fallout 76 was utterly shit, the fans pressured them into fixing the game. Now, when the game is playable and pretty OK, the fanboys took over and started worshiping Bethesda... of course they try this shit.
---
Go home Bethesda, you're drunk. 
---
Weapon artisan&gt;repair kits basically?
---
They arent useful to anybody who doesnt want to pay to win.
---
well, imagine if you could go into the sbq fight without needing to waste 5 perks worth of slots on gunsmith. You could take those five slots and use them somewhere else. That would be a huge game changer for me.
---
Are you crazy? How are the idiots suppose to jump on a band wagon if you tell them to think smart? 
---
What's wrong with repair kits in atom shop? If people want to spend there atoms on some repair kits.. they should be able to. Where's the harm in that?
---
I'm figuring we will pay a set amount for stacks of them... maybe like 50 atoms for 10. But you're right that plans are also possible.
---
Bring a few of them with you
---
Bethesda can you please stop deliberately damning yourselves? I thought we were past the slump but here we go again. Can I even get remotely excited for the future of this game if it just nonstop fucking controversy? 
---
Not sure where you get your information but ESO is not free to play my dude. 
---
It's not a bad idea. Also helps with making sure you have enough of the right amount of ammo, chems and so forth.
---
The total supply should increase because players will no longer be dumping valuable junk on vendors. You may have an initial rush of people farming to increase their supply, but that should fall off as the sale price drops due to competition and stash space limits.
---
Worst potential problem as always is likely to be screws, as they have high real value, are rarely sold to vendors and occupy little stash space.
---
I like the idea of something that adds incentive for nuking the Prime/SBQ, but I very much would like to see Bethesda honor the promise of COSMETIC ONLY! 
---
If it was craftable they wouldn't make it something undoroppable, unscrapable, and presumably weightless. It's just an option to click when inspecting the item. I hope I'm wrong but i would bet money I'm not.
---
So if the basic/advanced kits will be a flat repair to 100%/150% Weapon Artisan etc. might not boost that. Seems they'll only be useful in emergencies and certainly not required as I'm guessing a lot of people repair to 200% once those perks are available. I'm actually surprised that repairs aren't done by robot npcs as it's often used as a currency sink in online games.
---
You could earn them in game, but it only gave the +15, but if you bought them on the store - you could stack all 4 suits in a party for a +60 hp boost to everyone in the team.
---
Here's the store description at the time ‚ÄúBecome Unstoppable! Through February 4, gain +15 maximum health for each member on your team wearing a unique Unstoppables Outfit‚Äù, many dismissed it because it was "temporary" "only +15 each suit" or "but you can earn atoms in game" but at $8 a suit it seemed wrong then and clearly it was just the first step in introducing non-cosmetics to the atom store. 
---
Unfortunately funny memes shouldn‚Äôt dictate your life though.
---
I have no idea 
---
No, someone used the term 'shekelers' describing Bethesda's accountants.  
---
Call him a cunt of you want to, I don't agree, but I see why people would say that.  There's much worse out there though.
---
Except developers can tweek values on whatever they want to make earning currency a ball ache, or inflate prices so buying is really a more viable time effective option. If they started selling a gun that one shot people for 30,000 atoms it would be pay to win. Basically I don't think the fact currency can be earned in game is good enough justification or reassuring enough that we don't need to worry about them pulling future bullshit.

Unpopular Opinion Time - The reason I don't care that repair kits will be a thing. 
---
1. I very seriously doubt I've ever won a PPV battle because I broke someone's armor, or they broke their weapon.
---
2. I say that because I've never lost a PPV battle because of breaking my own armor or weapon. So I fail to see the advantage that person (or me) would have if there were a bunch of repair kits in inventory.
---
3. I'm at 300 hours, and even though many on here have more hours in, I don't have the drive to pause from questing for an IRL day to go gather supplies for repairing my shit.
---
4. Using another Bethesda title (ESO) as an example, PPV had a big presence. Same result as #1 and #2 - never died from a broken piece of kit in PPV. 
---
5. I realllllly don't want to load my stash box with "just in case" junk for repairs if I don't have to. I'd much rather keep a large variety of weapons in there - some just because they were tough to earn, others just because I like switching play styles. Same with armor. I should be able to fill my stash weight with multiple armor sets to accommodate multiple play options.
---
TL;DR - having a repair kit won't win you fights, nor lose them. having a repair kit WILL free stash space.
---
That's a ton of perk slots to spend on not having to repair though. You could use those on other stuff.
---
And this isn't really addressing the people that need repairs the most - the uber expensive over 50 repairs are where the urge to buy these will be highest. 
---
I am lucky enough to have a barcade that serves food across from my office that has an XBOX that I can get a midday fix on.
---
Reduced weight.
---
(It‚Äôs only 2 pounds.)
---
Wrong, it's p2w, regardless if you can earn currency in game. The only way it isn't p2w is if you can't buy atoms for real world money. End of discussion. 
---
But I‚Äôm not as there‚Äôs no reason to. Just because you have trust issues doesn‚Äôt mean everyone else should too. 
---
Bam! Got me üëç
---
Great write up, and having done something similar, I can say that a build like this definitely adds some zest! Just out of curiosity, have you actually checked to see if your damage doesn't drop upon equipping the hazmat suit? I had a berserker's lever action rifle for a long while and I remember seeing the damage drop when I was wearing a hazmat on a few months ago. I thought it was just calculating the radiation resistance as armor...
---
Good post and I don't see it as rant, more like vent.  I like to describe myself as a grumpy, sorta helpful 'ole hermit in the hills kind of player.  I like helping newbies when I can, when they ask, but not on advanced quests and tasks way too far above their level.  I got a team invite from a level 20 once that was stuck in the Glassed Caverns.  Was about to join when I messaged " What the hell are you doing in a place so inappropriate to your level?" Come to find out, there were 3 of them there all about the same level, guess the other 2 were crouched, cause I couldn't see them on the map.  They wanted me to clear the Cavern for them.  I told the one I was talking to, "Okay, for 300 caps each."  They countered with 150 total.  I declined and got a pretty hateful message about being so mean and opportunistic towards lower level players.  Or the lvl. 90 young girl who asked me to fab up 5k of 5.56 ammo for her, but she had no  mats or caps.  I made her 100 and sent her on her merry.  I don't trade with anyone below 50 as a rule, but the part about launching nukes is spot on. My experiences have been almost identical.  I still go help when I can, but I check their levels before I join and ask a few questions in advance.     
---
Yeah well. It doesnt surprises me they break promises. I do wonder: they said the repair kit was requested by many players.. I cant remember seeing a post on reddit of ppl requesting that.. 
---
I agree with others that pay-to-win can exist with in-game currency.  The irony is that the aftermarket already promotes a P2W paradigm.  You think all these players rolling with 3* exploit-du-jour gear found it themselves? No way. They paid for it.
---
Yeah repair kits. Not the Cage armor, the different tattoos or face paints, Mechanist armor you know all the stuff already in the game people wanted since release. Nah lets make them pay for repair kits guys! @Bethesda Fuck ooooooooffffffff
---
That requires a higher level friend willing to play.  A base of knowledge than many noobs don‚Äôt have and a huge amount of time.  
---
Like so many people many players don‚Äôt have the hours to do this every day.  
---
Not... really? I mean your example is a hypothetical that isn't how it works.
---
The thing your saying isn't, at all, the thing it is. If it WAS, then we'd be having a different discussion.
---
And no... if the currency required is obtainable in game without purchase, it simply isn't pay to win, because you don't HAVE to PAY to aquire it.
---
Man I'm so glad I can enjoy a game without checking in to make sure my YouTube overlords approve.
---
Ah yes I worded the title poorly, the other vendors will still be at the stations it's just the Whitesprings has each respective vendor now
---
I have a ton of weapons too but only one that's any good on the SBQ when she's in the air, my bloodied gatling gun. Nothing else I have comes even close. On the ground I have a bloodied sledgehammer that a level 200 gifted to me and a bloodied grognak's axe, but for that to be at all useful she has to be on the ground.
---
There's nothing to suggest that. I ain't happy about this either and want Bethesda to reconsider, but let's not jump immediately to hyperbole. Post level 40 repairing your stuff isn't a problem and they'll a complete waste of space in our inventories, it's the newer players that don't understand that is my main concern.
---
This is another reason why the flare should send a mapwide signal so the cavalry can turn up, not just people who see it

This isn't retail. If an item isn't selling in an actual store then it has to be removed because it's taking up space. These are digital items. They take up no space. Leaving them there costs nothing. There's no reason to remove them no matter how few people are buying them.
---
If you stay alive for too long, you become a target for other players. If you are killed by another player you lose caps and  aid.  If you die intentionally you lose nothing.       So you have an incentive to... not survive.   Pretty much defeats the whole purpose of the mode. 
---
They could also allow us to decide how much space we want to allocate, I have plenty of room on my PS4 but can only store 50 pics 
---
Try Trove. It doesn't have competative.
---
Thanks eh, much appreciated. Yeah, I think I'm going to try my luck at maxing the stealth timers, will be pretty sick for melee.  
---
And dam, sry to hear about your account. But sounds like they go through waves of bans then unbans? Perhaps its just temporary? 
---
Assuming they ever add enough enemies in a dungeon, and you only bring one weapon I suppose.  
---
I don't really see the issue with refrigerators and some cool item, maybe a cargo bot, that can send stuff to your stash. I don't see the need for an ammo convertor as we have a workshop that will make the ammo we want anyway and scrapping the idea for an ammo convertor might lead to more player vending. 
---
That kind of stuff doesn't bother me. It might be better, based on Pete Hines word, to keep plans for that in-game or make new quests to get them. But that's...not pay to win. You don't have advantages over another player. It doesn't give you extra damage resistance or damage output. A fridge that cuts spoiling time in half, a cargo-bot that takes your stuff to the nearest stash, that's just quality of life stuff. Cosmetic? No. But it's definitely not pay to win.
---
When they add something to the Shop that gives you damage buffs or resistance buffs, then I think you'd have a point about it being p2w.
---
I really like yhe cut of this guys jib! Tell Todd to give him a call!
---
One thing I wonder - is having each vendor represented at Whitesprings, and the shared 1400 cap pool, part of "player vending"?
---
Totally agree.  "Unlocked" *should* learn we learn to craft it.  If they used that term, but it's really a 1-item purchase, the backlash will be (rightfully) harsh.
---
They wont be in our inventory. It's just s button you click when you inspect the item to use a repair kit. 
---
I get it for "high voltage" devices, you need a dedicated wire run, but for lights and so on, any wall floor or ceiling tile which, at ANY point in the build is directly connected to power, should provide radiant power for low power devices, such as lights and TVs. 
---
If repair kits and the like can be obtained in game without Atoms for a reasonable price/effort. I have less of an issue with them being in the atom store. 
---
I stress that they have to be rather easily crafted. If its something of the sort of 10 screws, 10 gears, 10 steel, 10 rubber, 10 springs. I can live with that. 
---
I am in no means endorsing pay to win, but if there is some functional use atom purchases beyond cosmetics, that support further addition of new content and a better game, I have less of a bitter taste in my mouth over this.
---
1:1 or 2800 caps for 3k aluminium 
---
That‚Äôs not what‚Äôs going to happen at all. Let me demonstrate:
---
Player X has weapon artisan maxed out, which gives him 200% condition on repair. Perks can also be applied to reduce repair cost.
---
He receives one of these repair kits which gives him the ability to repair to 150% free of mats. 
---
Any sensible person would not use the repair kits as a main method of repairing their items as they are putting themselves at a disadvantage compared to what they could get by using the perks.
---
Mine's not legendary. Got the plan and - poof! - there it was.
---
I've gotten some primo stuff at WS in the last week or so. But it's random so I'm just lucky I guess. 
---
Hey valseek, you guys need to address the concern regarding repair kits like asap, it will drive the player base away as many of them seek it as Bethesda taking the game in a pay-to-win direction.
---
Please address this.
---
All the more reason for more info.
---
That sound you hear in the background is 10,000 new clickbait YouTube videos being recorded.  
---
Their thumbnails all have giant red arrows pointing at a picture of frowning Vault Boy with giant red letters spelling 'Fallout 76 Going Pay To Win???' and 'Bethesda Breaks Another Promise!!!'.
---
Geez...just when things were starting to get better too....
---
Ooh. How much does that add?
---
Unlike the rest of the list, the XP bobble head isn‚Äôt as accessible as the others. I‚Äôll add it anyway. Would be interesting to know exactly what the Xp bonus cap isü§î
---
Pay-per-view?
---
how many bloodied gatling guns do you think I have?!?! :P
---
Thr items will return because it's a rotation. This was never presented as a stagnant store either.
---
Wait... what? We don't use caps in the Atom shop, and the hypothetical you've stated still just reads as "pay to bypass" because that circumstance doesn't end with anything that leads to a distinct advantage over another player that just grinds nuke zones or whatever.
---
Exactly! and if they have a mic, I tell them, " Sorry, I got nothing you can use and you got nothing I need."
---
You are asking me to understand something that OP wrote a thesis on and still does not grasp.  Some people like to yuck people‚Äôs yum.  It‚Äôs part of the game they were ignorant of, and you are acting like I‚Äôm the one with comprehension and have reduced me to the level of sociopath because I refuse to empathize with a child playing a game clearly marketed towards adults.
---
It is not the ‚Äúraiders‚Äù fault that they didn‚Äôt know OP had a completely separate rules set that they had to follow in order to ensure their child enjoyed their experience.  It is OPs fault for having lofty expectations of a gaming community on top of a lack of understanding as to what passive mode actually entailed.
---
So if you wanna start throwing around terms, you can start with ignorance, just don‚Äôt start throwing it this way, pal.
---
I‚Äôm sure all those sellouts are into better click bait videos now, like ‚ÄúBORDERLANDS 3 EPIC EXCLUSIVE?? My reaction and thoughts‚Äù or other dumb shit 
---
Store your decontamination shower when you're not using it
---
Because they have to do more than you are doing in Adventure Mode
---
You‚Äôre completely missing the point you fucktard. It‚Äôs not about the votes dummy. It‚Äôs about the amount of people crying for more inconsequential shit from Bethesda when they have bigger more important shit to deal with. Man are you a fucking moron. And another point I‚Äôm not the the one crying I‚Äôm simply pointing out dummies when I see them. You‚Äôre the one crying about a fucking wall pass through conduit when there is already one in the game. 
---
Dum dah dum dum DUUUUMMMMMM
---
Please link me to more info about this I have no clue what's going on
---
I've never earned another player :p. /s
---
Here‚Äôs how you balance those things and meet the community half way. And not piss off 100‚Äôs/1000‚Äôs. 
---
Make the repair kit Plan cost 50-150 atoms. Then anyone that WANTS it can get it. 
---
Make the real kit in the atom shop cost 250ish that way people can buy it without making it. Which I will get to down below. 
---
Basic repair kit: cost 20 steel, 20 wood, 10 screws, 10 adhesive, 15 springs, 10 cloth and leather. Once crafted it weighs 8-10 pounds and is fair for the amount of scrap used.  It restores 15% of weapon or armour durability not counting the 200% you get with Weapon Artisan. 
---
Now you have an item that everyone can make or buy depending on their situation. The resources are fair and justified. 
---
If you can gather the needed materials buy the kit. Can‚Äôt but it craft it. 
---
You can tell whenever someone asks about gear and people said "Oh, just get a 3* Assassin's Sentinel."  If you actually play the game and find your own Legendaries, you know how rare such a thing really is.  Let alone a whole suit of it.
---
the point being that if you don't have to spend your perks on this you can use those perks for increased weapon damage and armor penetration
---
It literally says the better version of the repair kit is going to he a reward? Also who cares, it repairs your weapon how big of a deal is that? 
---
Everyone just attacks all game studios now with their feelings instead of thinking about it for a second. 
---
Play something else if you dont like it in the end. Complaining about something that wont even effect you is childish. 
---
Of course I've been against them. A lot. 
---
Don't panic and it's not a big deal at all.
---
Using crits isn't a very specific playstyle. Literally anybody can do it at level 2 strait out of the Vault. 
---
Also, it's not bad game design to have a counter to someone that's better than you. Everything should have a counter. 
---
There isnt one build that trumps anything 100% of the time. Not even close. Besides, those people worked for that build- even if it was just to collect the caps or whatever they needed to buy it off the internet machine. 
---
I have no idea how with something like 500 collective levels you don't have a counter to literally everything. I'm not even at 100 yet and I can switch my specs around to badass levels in mellee (one hand, two hand, and unarmed) as well as shotguns, big guns, both types of rifles (a little weak on full auto but I'm working on it),  decent pistols, and still have a ton of damage mitigation. And I run heavy stealth too. 
---
What on earth do you spend your cards on? 
---
I have a TSE gatling and a furious mini. And i dont do the SBQ fight often.  Its not that much rewarding.  Last time it dropped no plans only a combat armor piece which wasnt legendary...  
---
From what is known and what can be assumed, its a one time use thing that you buy each time to help you in game from a allegedly cosmetic store.... Bethesda broke their promise from day one...
---
I didn‚Äôt even think about that man, like I said I just got it. 
---
Yep. And then all the sudden it gets more grindy so you pay to make it more "convenient", i.e. Less grindy, and game balance starts to suck if you don't pay for the "convenience". This is exactly how gta works with decisions made to make the game less fun so you pay to skip the annoyance. How do you think they make so much money on shark cards when technically you could earn everything in the game?
---
Isn't recess over?  Get back to class...
---
Honestly, I think the plan for it should be a reward from a quest.  Or from having repaired a TON of stuff before.
---
There are connectors that work through walls. They are rather nice. You don't have to glitch because the materials for you to connect wires through walls already exists.
---
I assume that in 123 comments someone else has pointed this out, and hopefully dozens have, but given that this post has over 800 upvotes I am assuming the majority of the player base just doesn't know.

I regret buying this game, honestly.

How does plague walker work and how beneficial is it? 
---
Hey, I played that game too. It was a great game before they added \[gold ammo, coolant flush, mighty eagle\]. I don't play that game anymore. 
---
They probably found you once and continue to join off your gamertag. Try moving your CAMP to somewhere a little more hidden/secluded? Plus don't underplay people's ability to explore. Bethesda made a killing from gamers who like to explore lol
---
YOOOONNNGGGGG OOUUUTTTTT
---
Hat off to you üëç
---
" And there are ways to earn the basic one for free. "
---
You didn't read.
---
Well aware conduits exist - hence the title of this topic...
---
and as I've previously posted, I've tried the through-wall thing and it glitches to my 2nd floor or roof...That's fucking annoying...
---
It really makes no sense... it's like they want bad PR...
---
Look for people that place their camp new the zone. There‚Äôs always at least one person that does. 
---
Well from just implications and comparing to what its better counterpart is, it seems to be a buy and use thing, not a buy and craft forever, since mind you this is to generate a profit, a buy and craft forever won't generate as much money as a buy and use once, then re-buy again.
---
Also yeah your spot on, a day 1 promise was that the atomic shop was a cosmetic shop only, so even if it was a plan lets say, that's still breaking their promise.
---
Which means if someone doesn't have a load of cash to blow on the game, they're at a disadvantage, because then their perks have to go into these ones. 
---
Why can‚Äôt you lower settings??
---
It doesn't matter which one it is. If we're buying them off the atom shop, it violates the "cosmetics only" promise.  
---
Since handmades are difficult to get naturally, I'm just collecting combat rifles to make a sniper combat rifle.
---
I wish like hell I could say I was even mildly surprised by this development. The atom shop has been an over-priced shit show that uses manipulative tactics to get people to buy atoms from the start. Now they are flat out going back on their word that it will be cosmetic only, and...if we're going to be honest? That shouldn't surprise you.  
---
Bethesda's word has \_never\_ been good. 
---
There's a lot of people here who don't play the game or are dissatisfied with it and want to let everyone else know they should stop having fun.
---
Not a word you've been described as I'm sure...
---
True, the jetpack gives you an advantage in a ton of situations. I haven‚Äôt been able to make one yet due to lack of plans for it, but god damn I‚Äôm trying. Also that rifle sounds like it tears through everything.
---
Yeah, it seems pointless except to get their foot in the door with noncosemetic buyables. 
---
I myself have never seen a single post requesting repair kits.
---
And Bethesda, you specifically said the Atomic Shop will just be cosmetic. And this would not be that. 
---
This is really the time for you change your plans, and say you did so because of our feelings about it. 
---
Sure, these are all things they CAN do.
---
But they haven't. As it stands, the game is pretty generous with Atoms in just normal gameplay, REALLY generous if you make it your goal to grind the challenges.
---
And, again... you could earn those 30,000 in game, still not pay to win and still not a distinct advantage impossible for a non-paying character to aquire.
---
But fuck me, that'd be a shit concept and I'd revolt along with everyone else, for sure. It's cool to worry, and as I've already said on another person's comment, it is definitely a shift from the pre-release statement that all things are cosmetic... but by definition, still not pay to win.
---
Sorry but they removed that from the article before I read it, so even though I deleted my comment I stand by it. Apparently they made an error in stating it would apply to camp items otherwise they would probably not have specifically deleted that from the article.
---
Yes it was? Stores that use a rotation have a timer displaying exactly when an item will leave. Lots of items with a 'limited time' label have been added since launch and they've all had this. Given that, most people would assume that the items with no label are permanent. 
---
Sorry, yeah I did mean atoms, multitasking fail.
---
Your definition of P2W doesn't mesh with most people's definition.  No, a system doesn't have to have cash-exclusive items that are better than what you can get in game to be P2W, it just means that if I want to throw money at the game, I can bypass grinding my way to power like everyone else has to do.
---
It doesn't have to be a tangible item (even a virtual one), it just needs to give you a leg up over people that don't spend the money.
---
Do repair kits fit that description?  Yes, but barely, and not in a way that makes much difference to anyone, I agree with you there.  But this is the second time they've skirted that line, and I'm starting to worry a bit.
---
Yes, several people. Nothing interesting in it yet.
---
I agree 110%
---
Gotta entertain the basement dwelling nobodies otherwise who will?
---
I think the gun damage did scale due to a bug at some point a couple months back, but I haven't seen damage go up when repairing a weapon or improving it beyond 100% anymore, I think it was fixed.
---
Got your foil hat on? Ok good 
---
I can‚Äôt reply to you. I called him an ass and I guess he reported it. 
---
Too bad your not on xbox I would sell you my explosive berserker gatling laser
---
These shouldn't even have the ability to work with perks as they should not be a pay to get. Its clear implication was just to add a little health to a gun and not 200% fix it, that would render a workbench useless to a degree, but don't even bother with requesting a perk to fix help scale it, be more bothered Bethesda broke a day one promise of the atomic shop being cosmetic only.
---
You don't have to keep those perks equipped all the time though. Just when crafting/repairing.  That being said, repair kits should just be like any other plan, not an atom shop buy. 
---
These so-called ‚Äúmonetization experts‚Äù seem really stupid 
---
It is a slippery slope though. Not only is it not cosmetic, but it‚Äôs pay-for-convenience.
---
Bethesda, apparently.
---
Agreed that it is not worth it since you lose the buff from 200% but some people probably don't care about min-maxing that much and will still run with it.  That is why this would be a perfect item to carry 'just in case' but not put it behind a pay wall.
---
However, Bethesda said in no uncertain terms, the Atomic Shop would only be cosmetic. This is not that. it's a game mechanic. 
---
We are simply asking B to stick to that. The Atomic shop is popular, because we love the cosmetics in it, because you only buy what you think is fun.
---
This will be stuff you need. 
---
I'm saying that in this community almost nobody knows that subreddit even exists.
---
There are a lot of people playing as "raider", if this were not the case no one would complain this much.
---
It's not me deciding that you have to play with people that can blow up your base, it's a decision already made by Bethesda.
---
I play both Adventure and Survival, but this doesn't mean that I want an Adventure mode free of any danger, pacifist mode already offers enough protection.
---
If you don't have an adhesive farm set up I don't know how you can play this game.
---
highly doubt they will be 5 atoms each, Bethesda needs a currency sink.
---
Xbone? 
---
Noobs in a firefight needing to repair their pipe gun immediately is who I guess will be buying those repair kits. The rest of us will eschew them if we have the perk to repair guns to 200 percent condition. I might want one of those repair kits for an absolute emergency but I can't think of a time when I'd have used it, because given a choic between repairing my weapon to 150 percent and 200 I'm going to do 200 every time. I don't rely on any one weapon anyway, if it breaks I wait until I can get to a repair bench, just use another weapon. 
---
my psn is morgantim916! I'm usually online in the evenings (west coast timezone) 
---
Hmmm. I don't know if this'll work, but try storing the remains snf putting it back out. See if that fixes it. I've never tried that myself, but fingers crossed?
---
Same.  I saw 150% and passed.  If they do what you're saying and nerf white knight (again), weapon artisan and armorer, then I get pissed.
---
You can find videos from Todd Howard at E3 saying specifically that the Atomic Shop would be cosmetic only.
---
He was very clear. He even said for the life of the game. 
---
I think the point is that these are better than the basic repair kit 
---
What??
---
Might pave the way for additional utility items to be added to the store. 
---
I get much more frames when I lower the settings. 
---
&gt; it used to be gamers would rise up
---
we live in a society
---
Mistress of mystery set might be useful here
---
Wait there are rabbits
---
They should probably do a 180 real quick before it turns into a forest fire. I dont know how they would of ever thought this was a good idea or that it would be met with anything but vitriol 
---
They will if the whole playerbase is saying it they cant ignore it. They will get the message. If you think otherwise idk what you think PR is for 
---
I disagree with your definition of pay 2 win, I accept that you have a different definition but I disagree with it. These items fall within the umbrella of pay 2 win for me and even if they were 1 atom it would be a big deal given their "cosmetic items only" stance before launch. 
---
&gt; Now, go ahead and down vote me to oblivion, but I'll still be right.
---
You're right to yourself, but again - it doesn't match my definition and you are wrong to me. It's great you have a different opinion, but don't parade it around as a hard truth. 
---
Not sure I am in favor of this idea. I always count to four when throwing grenades.....
---
Let‚Äôs just see what happens. I‚Äôm happy with the game at the moment, I‚Äôm fingers crossed that this is either a mistake, a misunderstanding or them putting the feelers out for response. 
---
As somebody else said, if it‚Äôs free through quest then I don‚Äôt mind depending on how far this goes. The ammo bench is the limit of that I think.
---
I‚Äôm wondering the same. I run a heavy weapon build and don‚Äôt really use rifles, but I picked up a furious explosive hunting rifle. Plinked with it a bit before stashing it. 
---
Exactly. It's not "terrible". It's worth carrying around until you get something else, but it's not the last stop on the melee train. 
---
I‚Äôll try it. Thanks man.  Kinda crazy someone can do that to you and if you say anything you‚Äôre the one that gets in trouble. 
---
lol no worries! I want to say its on the pricey end, but im not online to check rn 
---
Yeah, with them adding more end-game content in the future this kind of quick repair may be essential. Especially if it means you don't have to carry spares of your gear.
---
Since the first data miners got ahold of the code for this game it has been plagued with rumors of pay 2 win and rightfully so. It‚Äôs hard to deny the hard code when it‚Äôs sitting there for all to see.  The perk cards, the lunch boxes, and now the repair kits. 
---
As much as many of us Fallout fans would love to say this is not a move to implement pay to win, its time to face the facts. This is the beginning, the cornerstone, and the first glimpse of what is to come. 
---
So a giant F to all my fellow wastelanders that were unfortunate F enough to pre order at the disgusting price of $80  F USD, and to those that waited a few days and purc F hased the game for merely half of the pre order price.  F 
---
To those that believe this is not a pay 2 win move, may I direct your attention to the grEAdy days of Star Wars. My only question at this point is how much real cash will I be required to spend, on top of my $80 pre order, after the next update to get my long promised player vending machine?
---
Thankfully we can all trust Todd and Bethesda to live up to the promise of ‚ÄúCosmetic Only Atom Shop Items‚Äù as we all know the repair kits will only be for looks....right?
---
The sad thing is that I didn't want to make this post *because* of people like him. Vulture reporting ftl lol.
---
But in the end, it had to be done. Better to push back now than having this stuff implemented and skewered later. 
---
Stuff happens, this is exactly what we wanted - clear communication with a date attached.
---
The reason is to make money. Simple as that. And it's not trust issues, anyone with half a sense in business could tell you that it would absolutely be advantageous to do something like this, as you would for sure make money. They wouldn't be putting it in the Atom Shop if they didn't think they could make money off of it. 
---
And yeah, I tend not to trust businesses, it's just a smart thing to do, like not trusting politicians. Do I need to remind you this is the same business that participated in false advertising when they stated the Power Armor Edition would come with a canvas bag? You can love the people at the company, you can love the product the company produces, but trusting or believing in the business side of the company is ignorant at best.
---
*snuggles*

Can‚Äôt believe I missed this. This is disgusting ü§¢ 
---
"People are infallibly truthful and never lie when it's to their advantage"
---
~ Idiots
---
ppl only read the title, and parret what others.
---
I'm iffy on this issue.
---
Todd Howard said it at E3 before the game came out. In their big Next Fallout preview. 
---
There was nothing vague or unclear about cosmetic only.
---
This is NOT cosmetic only. And it's obviously a toe in the water to see if people would be upset, and we are. 
---
We'll see how it's actually implemented. If it ever actually drops. ATM, they're to busy pushing pay to win mechanics to actually release on schedule, so they pushed it back an update. 
---
So can someone summarize what‚Äôs going on? I‚Äôm confused.
---
Nah I don‚Äôt have the option to store. Just to scrap since it‚Äôs completely destroyed. 
---
The only time I would ever have found those kits useful is when doing 3 SBQ fights back to back, one after the other. By SBQ number 3 I've got some broken guns, but if the improved ones drop from the SBQ's loot table, then I still wouldn't need to use the atom shop, I'd have the better one which is available as a drop.
---
Yes, buy things like defeating the SBQ. Which will cost me time, ammo and will break more things than what I'll repair with the kit, *if* it drops. As opposed to just paying some Atoms and getting an instant repair.
---
I assume differently.  The item is 'unlocked', which would clearly (to me at least) indicate you're buying a plan unlock, not an item.
---
If you remove your wall, you can place a piece of straight conduit on the floor so the ends are on either side of the wall, then replace the wall you can achieve pretty much what you're looking for. Just have to add the receivers to the ends and you get a less obtrusive bypass. 
---
It seems to do more if you are wearing a responder uniform. As it says ‚Äúresponder uniform not detected‚Äù?
---
Yup, that exact one. It was fun squeezing my camp as is into that spot, had giant Red Rocket sign right in the middle of the pond. 
---
Wasn‚Äôt enough plantable ground for razor grain and corn though, and if I‚Äôm going to mass produce whiskey for myself I need a lot flat space and access to a water source. I gave up on junk (and resource) nodes though... they don‚Äôt produce materials fast enough to sacrifice a good water source, flat land and a little seclusion for them. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll find a decent resource node near water and flat land eventually since I have a map of all of them. But it will probably be concrete or steel like the one in the dry lake where all the low levels stole my damn crops. 
---
The Bog proper would probably be perfect if it were not for the flying rats everywhere. 
---
You sir are a strong man to come from Battelfront 2, and 100% agree, wrote my own post on the damage with this repair kit fiasco (I didn't include BF2, but things like Black Ops 4 selling a glowsight for around $5 and a hammer for $30) and hell on gods earth if bethesda starts to do this, the absolute insane public show and possibly ridicule will start to happen in a couple hours when youtubers start cranking out the hot topic.
---
And that's great, but it doesn't affect the people who were _forced_ to buy _this_ fucking game on _their_ fucking launcher. 
---
You can place it anywhere in the wall yes, but it should snap in such a way that it is always at 90¬∞ to the wall wherever you put it, instead of having to fiddle around and dick with it and pray for the best.
---
And something like when you attach a power connector to a piece only said piece is powered and get rid of that weird and hard to predict power radiation thing.
---
They should make the advanced kits sellable because they're in the loot table taking the spot of sellable loot, but they won't make the basic kits sellable for the same reason the atom shop paints aren't.
---
I still have faith in people 
---
Well, there's your answer. 
---
Or just skip that entirely, pass the conduit through a window or door, then check it back to a wall
---
Ang other quest related paint schematics out there now that I have nuka  red and nuka quantum?
---
Been trying for BOS paint put technical data hasn't paid out yet.
---
I understand your frustration. I basically had the same response when they announced that Creation Club would not duplicate any currently existing mods (at the time).... and then they released CC and it had a bunch of existing mods. 
---
I support the devs, I support the game, but every company has its bad eggs. And that kind of duplicity in the name of money cannot be tolerated. 
---
There's no reason to implement them at all, let alone as a damn paid item.
---
I have five stairs and a dozen floors that do literally nothing but the game doesn't let me store or scrap them. I do love the CAMP/Workshop crafting but man does it have some issues.
---
Actually, in a wasteland full of hostiles, you're better off carrying all of your valuables on you. Otherwise, someone could break into your house while you're out and steal everything.
---
I would be okay with a cap stash at home... as long as it is pickable just like your doors are, and people can steal the caps.
---
I looked at that for eye of ra perks, but the dr still removed almost 20 points of damage from the ranged weapons. 100% AP is OP for sure, I am looking into a build that centers on this set itself.
---
Using our ideas to make a buck is a crappy move. Maybe I'll stop buy stuff in the shop for awhile. 
---
This gives me shark card vibes so hard. 
---
Yeah, there were a lot of posts around that time, but many accepted it for various reasons and given that it ended fairly quick - the posts disappeared after it was gone so it wouldn't have been hard to miss
---
&gt; This is disgusting ü§¢

I agree, and I don't think this is the end of non-cosmetics making their way to the atom store
---
I remember, tis one of the sacred relics Brother¬†Maynard carries with him.
---
OMG I WISH!!!!!

Didn't do a thing to high level player.  I was killed half a second after low level
---
great example: more weapon skins for something not called "hunting rifle"
---
I would man. This sucks. 
---
It isn't pay 2 win. I agree the definition of pay2win has been lost nowadays. It's still shit though.
---
This guy gets it. 
---
The repair kits aren't the problem.

It's that if the repair kits go well for Bethesda, in 6 months you'll see "custom legendaries" in the atom shop. For only 59.99 you can pick your legendary items mods!!
---
I don't care if this means we can never have repair kits. I don't want this to lead to the Atom Shop being the only way to successfully play the game.
---
I don't want this to become Fortnite's explorative monetized hellscape. 
---
This is my thought exactly. If they want money, make really cool costumes and camp items. Players will support you, aslong as you stick to your word and keep making the game fun.
---
It doesn't matter if it's easy to level, selling XP is bad bad bad and it is among the broadly accepted definitions of P2W. 
---
That said, it's a very contentious topic, so we all have our views on what's 'too far'. I personally believe FO76 lacked QOL at launch, and still does in a few ways, so seeing them sell QOL on their cash shop four months after that rocky launch is unacceptable for me. 
---
Anyway, we'll see how this unfolds. :-p
---
that would come around to about 1k exp on double xp + food/sleep buffs. and being a workshop you can build a bed. 
---
might actualy do that since shooting mutants is getting boring.
---
I'd love to work for Bethesda, put my two weeks in, and on the last couple of days do an official response of 'lol. No.' To these threads before walking out 
---
I mean... a lot of people are pretty OK with it, so long as it doesn't deliver a distinct advantage, myself included.
---
Perm base/forward base or base camp/spike camp üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª NEED WANT NEED WANT NEED WANT NEED NEED NEED!
---
Being able to set up a small tent and stash box for exploring, supporting a workshop defense, attending a pop-up flea market, dropping nukes, etc.
---
This would be a huge, huge QoL advancement! 
---
Ingredients are easy enough. recipe is not. Random reward for dailies.
---
Gotcha. 
---
&gt; Repair Kits are our first attempt at a utility item like this, and we plan to make adjustments based on your feedback, so we hope you‚Äôll share your thoughts with us when they go live later this month. 
---
Just taking a glance around the sub, I think you guys have enough feedback already.
---
You can use the Nvidia control panel to manually set a limiter on how many frames per second the graphics card will render. I'd try going in there and setting the limit and seeing if that fixes the problem. I'd limit your frames to know more than the refresh rate on your monitor to start with.
---
If this were a really real apocalypse situation I wouldn't carry more than 4 or 5 bottle caps with me. Not because I'm worried that they are going to get taken, but more so  because they are super loud when they jangled around. 
---
And relatively heavy too. Just looked it up. A single aluminum cap weighs 2.18 grams. Which comes to about 210 caps per pound. This means that the maximum 25,000 caps comes out to about 120 pounds. Ouch. 
---
Med-X.
---
You can have as many improved as you want without using a single atom.
---
Or, how about just a conduit thru wall with 1 power connector on each side that can also be used on floors and roofs.
---
NO.
---
I've watched RuneScape wither and die over the last 7 years *due to exactly the same mtx creep which started just like this*. I refuse to let this happen with '76.
---
The players in this community have a lot of power, with the wider fanbase of the franchise no doubt behind us.
---
Boston is starting to look more appealing already...
---
It's a horrible sign of a monetized fucking Fortnite nightmare to come 
---
idk, i use alot of conduits in my current build, but i dont move my camp around, which is what i hear the biggest problems with, so i suppose i just dodge a bullet there?
---
I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs pay to win. This is the road to it getting as close as possible before people completely lose their shit. Testing waters is all this is. 
---
I remember in fallout 3 there was a quest to retrieve a violin from a vault for an old lady in the wasteland. I think there's also one that appears in 76 in the garrahan mansion. It's just a junk item though.
---
It is, and a lot of players don‚Äôt venture down that way since there‚Äôs little of interest in the area, and the ones that do have no need for my 20+ razor grain and corn so they leave them alone. My friend built way up on top the cliff in a clearing with a large rock jutting out and his view of the valley and lakes is amazing. 
---
If they want more money, they should drop prices! I think more people would be willing to buy skins, but they are 15-20 bucks!
---
Things can absolutely be pay to win even if you can earn the currency used to buy them for free in game. The repair kits don't really qualify because they, themselves at least, don't really have an adverse effect on gameplay between those that pay and those that do not (just use repair cost reduction perks). That said, if something is released that makes a big difference, many people would be stuck to the meager atoms they can get each week while someone else might throw hundreds of dollars at the atom shop to leave them completely in the dust.
---
God damnit.  Player vending was what I was hyped for next week
---
The clear solution is don't buy it.  If they don't nerf repair perks, then it will die out.
---
Sometimes corporate pressure is too much.
---
Like I said. It's not about the people that already play the game and know it's not that bad.
---
It needs new players to survive. And like it or not, the average person is a complete moron. So yes, they **do** use their youtube overlords to decide their opinions for them.
---
And this definitely isn't going to be creating any positive opinions. 
---
Seeing all the posts echoing the same thing makes me think they will back down. It would be suicide for them all over again if they didn't listen to the community. 
---
Yeah they can't even get skins not to load in n64 level of graphics. I just said this but I'll say it again I won't be spending anymore money in the atom shop if they are going to use community idea to milk low levels who are struggling with the game. üëéüëéüëéüëéüëé
---
Hahahahaha omg. People will pick up pebbles for ammo now a days.
---
Nope.
---
I signed
---
reminds me of shadow warriors 2....
---
Oh honestly that wasn't a bug, its still in the game and is intended, but its just something not many people look at because in Fo4 it wasn't something to worry about or check. I'm not usre about you but I have over 400 hours in this game (weee no life, your probably have one heh) but I do notice, it, and it can be critical when I use weapons like The Dragon, god that thing is a decay cruncher, but that hell for sure is intended XD
---
This went downhill... lol. He was just trying to help then ya both got sassy
---
But..
---
If $$$ buys Atoms, and atoms buy in-game (non cosmetic) items, then that's kind of pay-to-win, isn't it?
---
Much appreciated. üëçüèºüòé
---
It is very strange.  Because the atom shop pricing has been improving quite well lately.  Either way, I know what I won't be buying LOL
---
yeah,.,...repair kits will be the last thing i will ever buy from the store...
---
So you would be cool with them added Fridges to the atom shop that allows you to keep your food better longer for a week? 
---
This is a very slippery slope. Mechanics that should be in the game could be getting locked behind a paywall and made temporary for repeat purchases. 
---
Permanent for a few months. They gave a full week to warn about it leaving after those items were here almost since launch.
---
It matters, yes. Bad press has hurt this game in the past and it will continue to hurt this game going forward with decisions like this. Sales and active players are the key to ensuring 76 is supported for a long time, so we need more players, not more people in games media talking smack. 
---
Don't underestimate the importance of public perception. ;-)
---
Everything else (bag gate, broken on release, false advertising, etc.) combined will be less of a problem than p2w items in the Atom shop. This will destroy the game. I am uninstalling as soon as I see this in a patch notes.
---
Because Bethesda thinks they need incentives to get people to populate the BETA survival mode. 
---
Can‚Äôt wait for all the clickbait rage videos for this! Thanks BSG! :(
---
First vote!
---
This was a great feature that added more to the game (imo). I loved not having to stop the action to make changes.
---
I normally carry a pen around, always handy to have a pen.
---
I would love to mess around with my perk cards/inventory from my phone when I‚Äôm not online.  Flag items for sale. Or scrap etc. 
---
pm snappzero he has them all. I have all but the healing factor, else I'd make them for you.
---
Truth be told, I don't care too much for these repair kits. In reality it's nothing crazy, But the negative press this will generate wont be good at all.
---
Next week it will be whitesprings because all the vendors are going to be there instead of just 1.
---
I've avoided ask the food issues by just taking Good Doggy and eating all the dog food.
---
Yeah especially when you are in the heat of the moment.
---
&gt; idk what you think PR is for
---
I don't think **you** know what PR is. Just like how a PR person isn't allowed to say *anything* negative about the company or game they represent, they also sometimes aren't allowed to respond to certain things.
---
Nobody is saying they won't see the complaints. They probably have already. But they most likely aren't allowed to reply to any reddit comments about it. And a monetisation decision is not in any way whatsoever related to the dev team. So they still have no influence.
---
I dunno maybe you can be right, but with its whole intended plan, and from previously data mine'd atomic shop items (loot crate like lunch boxes were found in the games file), I'm banking that its a buy one time use, but that's my speculation (but imo they shouldn't be in the atomic shop, they were free items in Fo3 and FoNV so what makes the difference here? M o n e y )
---
Seriously, like those 4-horsemen style power-armors I saw datamined a while back, I'd buy the fuck out of them.
---
Or a good weapon re-skin that isn't a croquet mallet or wiffle ball bat. 
---
What would your caps price for it be?
---
I eat the ass end of thr chocolate bunnies every easter season, so yes, yes I am.
---
They allow it because they wanted to see how badly people with high level, extreme builds could break the game.  Survival Beta is an opportunity for them to see broken, OP builds in action so they can nerf  them. The developers basically said so in a recent interview. 
---
Now that's a great idea to add.
---
If it gives you anything that you can not get otherwise it's a buff period/ 
---
&gt;You don't have advantages over another player. It doesn't give you extra damage resistance or damage output. A fridge that cuts spoiling time in half, a cargo-bot that takes your stuff to the nearest stash, that's just quality of life stuff, is that cosmetic? No. But it's definitely not pay to win. 
---
Let's break this down. 
---
A fridge that cuts spoiling time in half... 
---
Food that doesn't spoil rarely gives any buff to S.P.E.C.I.A.L it usually is HP and FOOD only. 
---
Crafted food that does spoil gives you decently powerful buffs to S.P.E.C.I.A.L as well as boosting in game numbers for other mechanics. 
---
Players would have more viable access to these buffs than players that don't have a preservation device. 
---
Players with this item have to grind less and can make more CAPS off of selling these items before they degrade.
---
Determination: Absolutely an advantage over other players.
---
A Cargobot that takes your stuff to the nearest stash for you.
---
So you can offload your junk safely before engaging in PvP with people that can;t offload their stuff instantly?
---
You don't have to spend time or caps traversing the map to offload junk?
---
You don't have to deal with the inconvenience of Over Encumberance?
---
Determination: Absolutely an advantage over players. 
---
A Bench that can break down ammo so you can craft other ammo types. 
---
A regular player can't even sell their unwanted ammo to in game vendors to do a pseudo-exchange of ammunition like this proposes. 
---
To say it isn't is illogical and delusional. 
---
That may be the case (personally I stay away from the slippery slope argument) but like I said if this is indeed a plan, that‚Äôs it, one purchase for complete crafting rights.
---
That might not be good for some, but I perceive a notable difference between purchasing crafting capabilities permanently for an account like we currently have with all the camp items and apparel, and spending say 200 atoms for 10 one time use kits.
---
Wasn't Heavy Rain really bad?
---
I was waiting for all the content to drop and restart the game around the end of year and now this.   
---
Maybe i should uninstall again...
---
All that needs to be said really. 
---
Thank you for the reply! Vsync is disabled , I'm using a Gsync monitor ( should of mentioned that TY ) I haven't reduced anything in Control Panel ( I'm checking now ) I don't see a frame cap option, but I did just turn on triple buffering for the application hoping that increases load and reduces frames ( going to load game see if there's a difference so thank you for mentioning control panel ! )  Regarding the .ini files, I wouldn't know where to begin . 
---
Yea, I've used that fountain a bunch of times before, but I left Whitesprings to travel to Watoga on foot. With my 900 lbs of stuff, I can't fast travel, but I'll eventually make it back
---
Thanks for the descriptions. Not sure why they don‚Äôt have them under the vendor listings when you scroll over the items.
---
FYI: Vault Boy headlamp is just the PIP Boy light on the helmet. It should really be labeled PIP Boy headlamp. 
---
You've really got to be absolutely shit at this game to need repair kits. 
---
The game features drills as a weapon but not a tool lol.
---
For the first time ever i actually want Juicehead to make a overly dramatic video complaining about Bethesda. 
---
With how the Nuka shine dlc added new crafting benches, I highly doubt Bethesda will ever make fridges or anything else only unlockable through the atom store. 
---
The thing with the costumes are a slippery slope, while I didn't really see an issue unstoppable clothes giving you stat boost, if they brought out buyable consumables that did the same thing, it would be seen as bad. Ultimately I think they should stick to skins and camp items.
---
So? I repeat... don't buy them.
---
If they don't generate revenue... they won't exist. 
---
However... 99.9% of y'all ARE gonna buy them. leading the way to the very thing that  you don't want.  
---
The business model exists, because there's a market for it. The end. Consumers are to blame. That's it. That's all. That's everything.
---
Drug addicts don't exist because dealers exist... it's the other way around. No market, no dealer. Period.
---
Guys, you aren't even reading correctly.
---
The post is about IMPROVED Repair Kits, the ones that only drop in the world and aren't available in the Atom Shop.
---
Learn to read.
---
Soooo... I'm looking at multiple definitions of what P2W means on google, all of them support my statement that it's using real money to aquire something of advantage over non-payer characters that non payers cannot get... is there a particular website of reputr whom the definition of it would be acceptable to you? Or can you link me to one of repute that refutes mine?
---
do appreciate you reaching out ps4 user, should ahve said such
---
No, he's still a cunt
---
Forgot to say [pc]
---
Are you on PC?
---
I wouldn't necessarily have an issue with it, game wise. It'd probably be better to have a questline to get the plans for the item, say a Responders quest to get some fridge or something gives you the plan for a fridge. That's just an example. 
---
The only real issue I have is they've said the Atomic Shop is cosmetic only and a utility item like a repair kit isn't cosmetic.
---
Bah. Speculation is a fool's game. Too much of it in this forum already. 
---
He‚Äôs a fucking twerp who browses Reddit and plagiarizes whatever is said on r/gaming
---
*Stares* in Unyielding Sentinel 
---
To be honest I really don‚Äôt know exactly what it‚Äôs worth but I‚Äôm thinking the 5-6k cap range.  
---
I want Yongyea two weeks late like last time.
---
It was the first wave of people who had a shit ton(100k+) of items. They said it was an indefinite ban until duping is gone, but realistically with the new weight limits duping is essentially gone at a large level. I didn't dupe, but I did stockpile shit from friends who probably were duping. Sucks, but I was in the wrong. RIP my Sent/ass gear.
---
Bethesda: Hey guys, we're probably releasing a item that's technically P2W in a sense but not really but actually yes all at the same time
---
Me: ...
---
Bethesda: Also IRL Mr Fuzzy plushie
---
Me: **throws wallet at Bethesda**
---
Dang um now I have some searching to do
---
By doing SBQ runs. Which will waste my time, ammo and break more of my weapons and armor than what I can get out of one improved kit.
---
I have to scavenge for repair materials while someone just insta repairs them with money.
---
I have to waste 5 perk card slots to keep my weapons from breaking while someone: that's right, *just insta repairs them with money.*
---
I have an inferior playing experience from a game I paid full price for, compared to someone who has a credit card.
---
And what's to say this is where it stops? Who knows what more could be added to the shop later?
---
I wonder if having the each vendors represented at Whitesprings, and the shared 1400 cap pool, falls under this too.
---
Paid mods? Releasing unfinished games? Changing purchased memorabilia for lesser products, in hopes that no one notices?
---
None of that is money hungry to you?!
---
This as been asked too many times.  It's all because of Playstation and their rule that requires your character to show your playstationID and not your in game name.  So they didn't bother to code it differently for PC.
---
They should work how they work in ESO. 
---
Nothing special or different.
---
The stuff with 76 i get 100 percent, but the paid mods is a stretch. When I played 4, some of the guys who had paid mods also made the same mods for free, plus there was never anything good on it. The free mods were always miles better. People are too blinded by 76 to see that Bethesda aren't they worse of them, yeah lately they haven't exactly been the best either. 
---
Thanks. Yea, it's taxing but I like it. There's a lack of lighting for high ceilings...so I made do. 
---
They're getting a lot better honestly.  I've noticed they're slowly removing all the initial items that were over priced and replacing them with better priced alternatives.
---
No.
---
I got 120 by the daily kill X enemys and level up today so far.
---
I'd take you up on that gladly but I'm on PS4. I appreciate it, though!
---
Forgot to add also, if you're really fancy and have an alt account like I do, group with your alt account and add Empath (25%).
---
And that‚Äôs totally fine. But as of now they haven‚Äôt done anything wrong in the atom shop in my opinion. You DONT have to buy it if you don‚Äôt want to. In no way shape or form are repair kits a big deal. You earn atoms in the game so if you do enough of those you don‚Äôt even have to buy them lmao
---
lmaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaao
---
Who knew they'd add microtransactions and p2w shit into a live-service mmo that was designed for the sole purpose of mimicking games like Destiny and Warframe.
---
Yeah you did mention that you had 900 lbs of guns sorry
---
While not strictly P2W, it's still not a cosmetic item. Also the wording is a bit strange, it says the basic ones will be ''unlockable'' in the Atomic Shop just like skins/camp decorations/emotes/etc are ''unlocked'' when you purchase them. Not the word that I would use for stuff that is not a 1 time purchase.
---
TBH I don't really care as my stuff takes a long time to break because of weapon artisan/fix it good, and I don't even use gunsmith/makeshift warrior so unless they stealth nerf weapon/armor durability I won't bother using them. The only time were it could probably be an issue is at the SBQ since it's such a long fight most of the time.
---
Maybe your right. But if they wont listen to the people who work for them we all might as well just uninstall. OFFICIALLY. Yeah your right but you really think they dont talk it over amongst themselves? There's no way this blows over fast. 
---
Good on ya.  I would volunteer for this as well.  
---
I think that was copied and pasted from the other Wiki, I have been playing for a good time now and I know in fallout 3 it did but it was easier to repair items in that game, i think it was removed in 4 and stayed out in 76.
---
I want nights a torch or Pip-Boy light or night vision a must. Rain needs to fell like a shower or a storm and not a lawn sprinkler. 
---
Yup, if they want me to actually pony up cash, they need to do a couple things. Drop the atom price of everything in the shop by a decimal place, or increase the purchase atom price by one. I will fucking _never_ spend 18 real world dollars on a fucking paint job, your prices are absolutely insane. 
---
Upgrade the store so that you can actually stock a decent inventory. I have a feeling a bit part of why they keep removing items before they add more items is because the shop as a whole is a clunky  annoying to navigate mess. 
---
And introduce a _shitload_ more content. Get people working on different color skins for all the power armors, let us have _every_ skin on _every_ fucking suit, class of armor, and weapon. Want to charge us a couple hundred caps per unlock? Fine, but give us the _option_. 
---
Have basic color swaps in the full color spectrum for every suit of armor. Black, blue, red, green. Raider themed paints for all armor, etc etc. 
---
You could provide us with a _shitload_ more choice before you had to get anyone working on new textures, just fucking around with color pallets for existing models. 
---
The problem is that they promised no non cosmetics in the cash shop.
---
It shows a willingness to betray the player base. And thatcmoneycis worth more than their word.
---
Sure money can be hard to get but there are other avenues they could go down. Out of game merch. (But they have been strugling with quality here). In game cosmetics (good plan but I think they got the pricing scheme a tad bit wrong). And of course new game sales ( probably difficult with all the controversy). 
---
The point is if there solution is to take back a promise and word it as if they are doing us a favor. Then any Faith we may have had in the game is misplaced and it wont get better. If this goes live in expecting it to do more damage to the game than any other controversy yet.
---
This issue with the things I listed is that it crosses the boundaries from cosmetic items only to being able to actually purchase advantages in the game.  Sure,  it's not combat oriented (yet), but they all have some way to get you or let you save materials or caps that would otherwise have to be earnable in game.    
---
This kind of stuff should be throwing up red flags,  They are technically pay 2 win,  you are buying stuff with real world currency that gives you an advantage in the game.   It's not as flagrant as buying a 3* leg. for cash,  but it IS pay 2 win.   
---
Even the repair kits themselves are VERY much pay to win.  Imagine being able to buy an item for real world money that lets you skip on the heavy repair costs of end game items.  thats whats happening.
---
This is literally exactly what I was thinking!
---
Nope. Lots of people are in tough places, powerless places... without being assholes to others. 
---
That shit's just an excuse.
---
I‚Äôve never played ESO. Just going on what I know. But do tell how it works there. 
---
When i say " it doesnt matter" i mean that even if more people liked the game i still wouldnt consider it pay to win
---
Just like how i wouldnt say a pay to win item isnt one just because the metacritic score is higher
---
The nerf to repair perks a couple patches ago I starting to make sense...
---
Because you‚Äôre being rewarded for taking the risk playing a mode with much more punishing game rules and features, griefers aren‚Äôt subhuman fam relax yourself.
---
You would think, but considering their recent failures investors must be worried and Bethesda needs to increase profits quick
---
Thats how I remember it working in Fallout 4, but I havent been able to get it to work here.
---
Yeah, that's crazy.
---
What if... this is the real goal of the repair kits. To get players to interact constructively..
---
The issue isn‚Äôt so much the repair kit itself but the fact that allowing them to put something that affects gameplay into the atomic shop, no matter how small a benefit it provides, can lead to a slippery slope where they add in more and more items that offer even larger benefits to those that buy it. That can then lead to those who bought everything that offers some sort of benefit from the atomic shop being unstoppable for those who spend a small amount of money on the game or possibly no money at all.
---
Your definition is an opinion, as is mine, as is everyone else's. You are taking a stance that YOUR definition is FACT and that is ridiculous. I've given you 7 definitions from others that support repair kits as being pay2win. You're free to have your own opinion, but saying it as a fact is incredibly irksome - because it isn't. 
---
'nobody died because of it' is about as useless a counterpoint as I can imagine. xD
---
They may be trash, it doesn't matter. This is Bethesda marketing dipping their toes in the water and checking to see if anyone notices. The wording of the article heavily implies that other big community QOL requests could also end up on the atom shop. That is horrible. This game is not out of the mud yet and it'll be months to come before its polish is good enough to warrant Bethesda even *thinking* about selling utility on their cash shop.

How could you guys betray us?
---
hear! hear!
---
So if i can get them in game who cares ?
---
Also Cryolators.  If a couple players show up with Cryolators, the odds of beating her are much higher.
---
Let me guess.
---
Someone stole your sweet roll.
---
Okay and how do manage to keep diseases for long periods for time? 
---
I hope that Bethesda follows through with the idea of letting us decorate with objects that we gave gathered. I plan on decorating my camp with a "Mr. Fuzzy versus the Teddy horde" theme in mind.
---
AA gauss is actually a bad gun for the queen because the DPM is too low. Same problem with hunting and lever rifles, and obviously the black powder stuff. If you're running a rifle build then you really want a good Handmade for spamming into the queen's head once it lands.
---
Test this stuff on normal scorchbeasts. Wait for them to land, then see how fast you can kill them without using stealth.
---
I don‚Äôt think so. It had a great story and game mechanics but you had to work for good endings.
---
That price doesn‚Äôt surprise me. That is an absolute pinnacle weapon. Chances of that dropping in the world are something like 1 in 500,000, if I remember the post right (some guy was doing math on chances for a specific 3* legendary combo on the exact item you want). 
---
Actually, I think it was more like 1/500,000,000
---
We‚Äôre talking the Windfury of FO76. 
---
So yeah, people might be willing to sell their souls for a weapon like that. You do simply can‚Äôt get a better one. 
---
And Deathclaws! I used to snipe the arms off of Deathclaws in FO:NV in the quarry with the .50BMG. Good, clean fun! Not to mention instant death ‚ò† for the Deathclaws hehehehe.
---
Whilst you are at it, Bethesda, may we, pretty please, have the .50BMG back? I could really use some more good, clean fun! 
---
They do listen to the people who work for them. The guys from bethesda that comment here pass things over to the DEV team. 
---
Do you really think these people whose job it is to use social media have any say whatsoever in the higher ups decisions on how to make the company money?
---
Yes they are
---
Vault 76 or the Whitespring 
---
No,  It's going to be people that want to avoid heavy repair costs.  Imagine not having to farm for those expensive materials and just buying an item to repair it for you.   
---
The problem isn't that you can do it whereever,  its that it lets you avoid the heavy repair costs.   You're effectively buying materials with real world currency.  
---
Yeah i'm a bit bummed out over them delaying it too.  was really hoping to offload some bulk junk/Chems/Aid Items and some of the extra fasnacht masks i had plugging up my stash space.   Was also really looking forward to going around and checking out other people's vending machines and C.A.M.P.S too.    
---
Finally someone gets it! I feel like I‚Äôm taking crazy pills with how accepting everyone is of this bullshit 
---
To make sure I had it aligned, I made a blueprint of the vertical conduit with a long piece attached on the bottom.

Nah I'm cool thanks, I like to earn them the proper way.  
---
Thanks though! 
---
\&gt;  I myself have never seen a single post requesting repair kits. 
---
that's ok, can't expect you to have read every single post over the past 5 months

ESO is a far different game though, it's an mmo, 76 isn't. Plus, regardless of that, ESO has some of the worse microtransaction I've ever seen, and that's from someone who played the shit out of it . A great example of how bad it is, you could wait thirty days to unlock a perk for your armor, or spend real money to make it go quicker. 
---
Yes... thats... pay to bypass, tho. 
---
As I said elsewhere, I've got a bunch of tabs open from multiple sites defining the concept, and they all state that it's paying real money to aquire gear/skills/abilities that give distinct advantages over non-paying players, usually revolving around items that cannot be acquired via in-game means.
---
Can you link me to a site defining it otherwise? I don't ask to be pedantic, I ask to see if I'm really just this behind the curve on the change and people really have changed the definition that much since it was introduced.
---
Fuck that, I'm not repairing my weapons to 15o when I can repair them to 200 at a workbench. It's just dumb to do that. 
---
What weapon have you been unable to repair above 100% with Weapon Artisan perk?
---
I‚Äôm not a big fan of that model either, it‚Äôs why I was relieved to hear that when I bought items on the shop, they were universal crafting rights, so I wouldn‚Äôt need to fork out another 800 for the same jacket for my new character.
---
If we do need to purchase individual kits for more than ~10 atoms a piece I‚Äôll be annoyed, but if the established model for items bought on the shop continues, it‚Äôll likely be the plan.
---
I can understand where you're coming from. 
---
Might be better to just add plans for the items at vendors  or whatever. 
---
Why? Do you have something against transvestites? 
---
Oh hell yes. A karma system. 
---
Positive for being nice *to people NOT ON YOUR FRIENDS LIST*  ( to avoid exploiting the system), and negative for dickhead behaviour.
---
If it comes to that point, which it hopefully dosent. I mean, it sucks, but so far it‚Äôs little things. 
---
I know a certain big green fella who wouldn‚Äôt appreciate that. 
---
Would be INFINITELY better
---
You can get a fusion reactor plan from doing the power station missions. The most important thing i wish i knew was that the unique items you get for some quests are tied to your level when you complete them, so if you complete it at level 25 you cannot get the lvl 50 version for when you get there.
---
Oh hell no
---
I feel like you're missing the point of the thread and my arguments, or we're just misunderstanding one another. Either way, I don't really care to define P2W as P2W wasn't really part of my post... it's kind of irrelevant. 
---
My post is largely about how poorly this will be viewed by games media and potential players, as well as the player base, and how bad the timing is.
---
So this is how a game dies.
---
Have you seen the ESO shop?  Most of it is cosmetic items.  There are things like exp boosters and respec scrolls that are sold but most items are aesthetic.  It is very likely FO76 will be like ESO rather than Runescape 3
---
*logs onto game*
---
Have a nice day!
---
Roger that! What perk cards lower the paper damage?
---
Also, FYI - the chameleon mutation definitely doesn't work with the hazmat suit because it seems to count the radiation resistance as armor! I checked that as recently as last night.
---
Tbh do we actually need ammo converters? Just the ability to sell ammo at vendors woulda sufficed and then we could of bought ammo we did need.
---
It just seems a pointless workaround to me for something that could have been solved so simply 
---
I would love to see what you come up with. I am exploring a sniper build with it.
---
Gp on youtube and looks for a Camp builder named Jug, he does a lot of good tips and tricks how building camps and gives interesting ideas
---
So with all that, Med-X, Empath... that's basically godmode yeah? I mean I know godmode in that form exists, because I've seen people with it and shot them with my 1600 damage bloody explosive harpoon gun and did zero damage. Just was trying to figure out how it's done.
---
How have you "seen" them return to Adventure mode? Shit lying like this is why the culture is fucked. 
---
No of course not. But I‚Äôm pretty active on here and read way more than I post. 
---
I‚Äôm sure there is. If you know of some post links. Also post some info on how often this has been requested.
---
Because honestly it sounds like an exaggerated claim. 
---
Yup. Several of my weapon, armour and camp plans are gone. Learnt them and nothing. 
---
Lol üòÇ
---
I will argue that for awhile in video games, you didn‚Äôt have any sort of pay for anything. Sure the 3-4 dlcs that you‚Äôd get for maybe 10-20 bucks a pop, but that‚Äôs it. Therefore the cosmetic items being up for sale is already making us pay for more. Although you are correct that it isn‚Äôt pay to win.
---
I‚Äôm not sure about guns being scaled but melee weapons definitely do more damage with the repairs
---
Which is why there would be a 5 kill limit.
---
Stop complaining already. They only repair to 100%, if you're not already keeping your guns and armor above 100% already, then it's your own fault. Who cares if they bring a utility item into the Atom shop.
---
And stop with the "pay to win" BS, if you can't win without a mid-fight weapon fix, you weren't going to win it anyway.
---
The rifle takes 3 or 4 shots to drop a level 68 super mutant. As for the jet pack, I use it for everything from climbing to roofs to get a break in combat to flying up while shooting to throw the enemies shots off. Its handy also if you want to get on your own roof to build at your camp
---
lmao this the stupidest thing i've read today. kudos.
---
Except it‚Äôs a way to attract and keep newer players.  In effect, they could get to their desired build much quicker if they don‚Äôt have to worry about perks related to repairs.  
---
So many ignorant people who have no idea what p2w even means.  ESO has had services/consumables in the shop since it's launch and it's not p2w now it is?  So many drama Queens in this sub.
---
I love you guys
---
Na, i'll just keep playing the game.
---
Probably maxing rifleman. You should also pick up unyielding armor to up your perception like crazy, it's great.
---
Just got the notification. Lmao
---
So what‚Äôs the point in this post then? Is it just you wanting a bit of clout because you clearly have your mind set on the fact that griefers are scum.
---
Uggh... I can‚Äôt wait for player vending. 
---
If an item that gives you a competitive edge in the game can be bought, officially, with real world money, the game is pay to win. It's not "over used". There is a spectrum of fuckery, and \_every game anywhere on that spectrum deserves to be fucking panned\_. 
---
You legitimately don't understand. 
---
You have to keep contracting them. A lot of people that run a build with it, will drink dirty water, sleep in sleeping bags, and pretty much do whatever it takes to get diseases... either that, or just let them happen naturally.Plague walker will still give you area damage, whether you have no diseases or 5.. its just stronger with more. 
---
In my case, I cant get rid of my 4 diseases, so it may be a huge benefit to get the plague walker mutation... unless the diseases magically fix themselves. 
---
Bethesda needs to add a dialog: accept challenge or forfeit ownership 
---
You're totally missing the point.  Doing this allows you to effectively buy hard to get materials that you would otherwise have to farm.  
---
It's not that you yourself would or wouldn't do it.  It's able to be done,  and it's definitively pay to win.
---
*reads title as a future vendor*
---
*hears the sound of falling caps in my head*
---
Yes please. Let's do this with the kits instead.
---
Yep: "Bethesda plans to add pay to win microtransactions"
---
Yes, I would. Because it is a **qol** add you can purchase with currency you earn **in game**. Someone owning a fridge isn't more capable than someone who doesn't. I would like to not have to craft 40 soups everytime I play for 4 hours
---
I know. I meant as a need to traveling at night. Only time I need to use lights at night now is to look for corpses and like. Nothing say damn better turn on a light to walk to town. 
---
Looks like I just need a stable violet and a stable fluorescent flux now if anyone wants to tell me 1 of each. 
---
Yup. Completely agree (assuming you‚Äôre referring to the now pay to play fallout76) it‚Äôs a slippery slope and it‚Äôs not a fun ride. 
---
Level 50
---
GODDESS!!!!
---
No, what they said was people kept asking about auxillary items like fridges since fasnacht. Implying at most it was minor items that do niche things.
---
Again with the misinformation chief.
---
Vsync avoids screen tearing by essentially locking your frame rate. So another option you have is to try enabling VSync and seeing how the game performs. I'd strongly suggest enabling VSync in-game, as the game should automatically limit the FPS there.
---
Repair kits may be the first step to tons of other QOL things being added to the Atom Shop, would you be mad if they started adding ammo you could buy? Or a fridge that makes your food decay slower? Or something that collects lost items and sends them to your camp? Or any number of things that the community wants added to the game? 
---
Yeah, repair kits by themselves don't upset me that much, I'd never buy one, just like I'll never buy anything in the shop, but if we don't make a big deal out of it now, later one they could just keep adding things too it that start having bigger and bigger impacts on the gameplay, making it easier and easier, all for real world money.
---
And yeah you earn them, but the rate you earn them goes down the longer you play the game, and Bethesda also controls that, so they can also slow it down if you want to.
---
I truely think no one who says they RP as a raider in this game is actually RPing as a raider.  Their just psychopaths who enjoy fucking with other peoples shit.   
---
That said, part of this is on you. This is a M rated game, and you should not put your kid down in front of it, I legitimately hate that this is the reality, but there you go. 
---
why are you taking my post as a challange , this is an advice omg..
---
Me, too.  If I forget to repair my Handmade, then the Combat rifle comes out.  .45 ammo is easier to come by, too, so sometimes it's good to switch it up.
---
I don't understand why you're getting heavily downvoted. This is good advice for a game they've fumbled so hard. Every week we hear about some insane or incompetent thing Bethesda has done with fallout 76. It's been an absolute shit show since release and it just gets worse as time rolls on. Supporting this game just justifies their business practices
---
Oh I get the point. 
---
&gt; So many ignorant people who have no idea what p2w even means.
---
This game is not ESO. I certainly remember Pete Hines and Todd Howard saying the Atom shop will be cosmetics only.
---
How is this controversial?
---
It would be a cash grab,   assuming it'll be available for atoms (why it's on that list)
---
Long shot and sniper aren‚Äôt needed really in a vats build. Sure you can use them.  But other points are needed elsewhere. 
---
Would this game even be good as a single player rpg?  I've played it for nearly 400 hours.  Probably would have dropped it off a cliff after 10-15 in single player.
---
Thanks! Conduit is probably one of my fave building items. I know it eats budget but it just looks cool and gives a tidy appearance. 
---
If it was plans that would be fine, but it would beg the question, why not just make it an unlock in game. The fact you can't trade them makes me think it won't be, as if it was a buy one for 10 atoms, being able to trade them would be insane, you could start charging real money for them
---
Wdym now pay to play f76??
---
Nice, this is good info for me because I dont really mess with workshops
---
I mean, they are already getting rid of slap damage, and pretty much the ability to destroy camps
---
OK I wtry that and let you know ! thank you for the suggestion
---
Probably not, it was linked to player vending which is now delayed. They probably want your money first.
---
Bethesda you fools, please don't do this
---
Yeah if they actually go through with this fucking shit I'm done with Bethesda and all things Fallout. I'm not going to support a company that's adds P2W to a game franchise I love; I'd rather the franchise die than support dick heads.
---
That was the mistake of the FO76 fandom in the first place: easing up the pressure on Bethesda. They saw the game being OK and they started patting Bethesda on the back and the moment the devs started to get goodwill from the fanboys, they did this.
---
I mean repair kit wow is literally the most useless thing maybe for beginners game but thorse endgame I just go to my camp and fix and theres a lot of crating tables around the wasteland if people wanna buy convenience then let them gosh such fuzz over something so irrelevant 
---
Only if the only way to get the atoms was with the cash, not by playing. It's then "pay to bypass".
---
Nope, those are NPC vendors and have nothing to do with player vending.
---
I would rather not get another update for six months than start down this path towards pay to win. Do not add this to the atom shop. You hear us Bethesda, don't be hard headed . Y'all should be grateful you have fans that care as much as we do about our game. Listen to us and you can avoid a lot of bad pr. Just posting what you did was like throwing a gas can on a bonfire.
---
I was cruising the menus in my Xbox and thought I had found a place where players were looking to arrange play time.  I forgot where.
---
"game is losing players" I love pulling statistics out of my ass.
---
I‚Äôll offer 5k, also logging in now to see if I have either of those guns you are looking for.
---
Shit dude that always worked for me :( just asked my partner, he says attacking a friendly responder eyebot from stealth with a melee power attack worked for him (whereas I was able to get it in anything the last two times I've had that one). Good luck?
---
Absolutely!
---
Repair kits?  Context? 
---
tantrums over repair kits in atom shop
---
Respective level i think.
---
I'm done arguing with you. You aren't right, you have a different opinion and that's it. "Now, go ahead and down vote me to oblivion, but I'll still be right." is such a monumentally ridiculous stance to take when stating an OPINION. I gave my side, I gave plenty of information to back my side up, any further talking is just a waste of time. Have a great day.
---
After such a colossal fuckup that was this games launch how do you even think about this
---
If you have to buy Atoms, to buy a repair kit, to repair your only useful weapon while on the go... you probably just suck anyways.
---
REPAIRING GEAR IS NOT P2W
---
Kind of hope they allow us to place the vendor machines in our camp or whitesprings, I'd prefer not to have a raider Orbital strike my camp.
---
um, where did you get this plan for 1k caps? I have been trying to get my hands on it for months but the prices people have asked for it were outrageous. 
---
brahmin yoghurt, brahmin milkshakes, Pancakes, bisquits...
---
This game can't be dying more than Anthem or Battlefield 5.  It will probably survive a few years at least.  Most people that say they hate this game are still curious about where it's going.
---
But why put it in the atom store versus making it an actual in game item acquired but a quest or something? 
---
If they put it in the store for free. Cool.
---
If they charge for it. Kinda sad.
---
If they charge for it and make it temporary. That‚Äôs dirty.
---
It's really wonky buying those. I bought once for the fusion shop garage door and it gave me a screen that said paypal didn't go through. But checking paypal it charged. I checked the atoms and they were there so it worked. When it's charging there's just a blank screen like it's hanged too. They probably need to test outside the lan more.
---
Though it does unlock the plan that the player at that point must craft, unlike any other plan, those items come with the built in self destruct feature, obviously. So though we ‚Äúunlock‚Äù the plan, we certainly don‚Äôt own it, and it cannot be shared, Trades, or sold, for obvious reasons. 
---
Truth be told, I have no problem whatsoever with the Atom Shop and respect the fact that despite being ‚Äúmicro transaction‚Äù based, Bethesda has gone out of their way to only include cosmetic items to avoid the ‚Äúpay to play‚Äù business model, which they by no means had to. 
---
The most financially successful online game of similar format, GTAO, has the blatant pay to play Shark Card store and you don‚Äôt see them apologizing for it. True you can grind the game to buy everything (as I did) but obviously it‚Äôs so much easier to simply buy a shark card. 
---
I almost think Bethesda is being too nice. You can earn free Atoms rather easily, especially with the new challenge tracker, and they have yet to add exclusive Legendary armor or weapons to the shop, which they are certainly entitled to do. 
---
Granted, the recent addition if the Wiffle Bat did add a bit of a built in advantage to the player that equips it (it cosmetically hides the true power of the weapon as even if the bat is fully upgraded with energy coils and/or barbs, it still appears as just a plastic bat) and though this advantage is very minor in the grand scheme of things, it did set a new precedent.
---
Ah.
---
Can you milk me Greg? I have nipples..
---
Exactly. Bethesda is exploring the sensitivity of the community.
---
I must have overlooked those in all previous posts with my excitement for vending.  I‚Äôm excited for those as well now!
---
I actually am alright with them being in the Atom Shop, **BUT** only if they increased the rate at which we earned Atoms. and made it so you could buy multiple kits at a discounted price versus buying a single one.
---
The front page is crying because something isn't p2w in any way, yet everyone is crying.
---
What‚Äôs the item?
---
This is the logical scenario, players don't spend atoms so they never have to buy more, you might spend 1000 a month, which can easily be earned in that timeframe. Adding one time use consumables would be a way to make us drain out atoms so we are forced to but more. 
---
The alternative for Bethesda would be to have a team dedicated to making cool outfits that release weekly, forcing players to have to spend money if they want to look cool
---
Fingers crossed! At least if you get a bit of movement, it's progress üòÖ
---
how about just using the available power conduits?
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/8u4eOte](https://imgur.com/a/8u4eOte) 
---
this is a 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 tile double conduit west-east and north-south building passing with 40 outside power connectors, 10 at each site.
---
not sure what else you need.
---
Can someone tell me what exactly is going on? I‚Äôm very confused with these posts.
---
No it's not pay to win yet, but it is the path toward it.
---
You‚Äôre aware all of the original gangs came from vault 15 yeah?
---
It's like they're begging us to quit so they can put more resources into a new game.
---
Hi am on pc and if op doesn't take ur offer is it ok if I can have the mask. Ign TheMadHam. 
---
It isn't inherently a shitty practice. FO76 has literally the best implimentation of it because it is purely cosmetics, meaning zero impact on the game, and the currency is earnable in game. So you can opt to not spend a dime on it, and still be able to get things.
---
Nah, I‚Äôm on Xbox. I just didn‚Äôt have much in my inventory and they were next to each other alphabetically, and basically what I‚Äôm saying is, I‚Äôm a big dummy and need to slow down sometimes. 
---
They said this is the first step. They want to add more things you can only buy with Atoms. Refrigerators, ammo refitting benches. It won't be long before you have to spend Atoms to get rare weapons to stay competitive in PvP or successfully survive Adventure locations.
---
It's the start of an endemic problem. Just LOOK at Fortnite and how it's monetized. It isn't about the utility of the fucking item it's about what it means. 
---
So much for only cosmetics in the atom shop. Seems like they're heading to a model focused on generating more income for a game that was already half off in the first month of its release. I trusted you Bethesda. You never let me down before and I knew the bugs were part of the Beth experience but this is a complete and total game changer in all possible meanings.
---
I guess the atomic shop isn't bringing in the money like they thought it would (big surprise there). They haven't crossed the pay to win line, yet. However, I agree that anyone who currently enjoys the game should be worried about this. The next step after refrigerators and ammo conversion is expanded camp budgets and a bigger stash (all for real money). Then they might add some time delays mechanics (similar to fermenting) that you can pay to skip. Pretty soon after that they will offer a "premium subscription service." If we don't draw the line here, it's not going to stop.
---
I don't do PVP, but if I were to join survival,  for the unfair advantages they're shoving at the griefer asshat crowd, I'd sure as shit shovel every aid item into my stash and every camp I have onto a friend or alt.   
---
Which I suspect is what people do. Maybe require a bank of 2k caps be stored with the game before you can join survival? 
---
Happens to me all the time since I frequently move my base, just close build mode and open it back up 
---
I hate to be the one to pump the brakes on the outrage train and all, but are we SURE we're reading this correctly?
---
Basic Repair Kits are "***unlockable***" via the Atomic Shop.  What if that's a recipe, and not a purchase-per-use item?
---
Given how easy it's been to amass thousands of Atoms for free via Challenges, I wouldn't have a problem with this.
---
Purchase-per-use would be a god-awful move, but we don't know for sure that that's what this is, do we?
---
What is your build if you don't mind me asking?
---
I'm not someone who runs around looking for pvp (even in survival). In fact, I try to avoid it as much as possible (especially in survival). But on the other hand if someone comes at me I'm going to make damn sure I have the knowledge and ability to defend myself. 
---
And I don't have sent/cav/ass. I do have 2 pieces of 1 star assassin armor but I don't really think that does much honestly. 
---
My standard is simply see them first. Then avoid or use sneak skills to get in close before they can react. And I'm not talking about the actual sneak perk (pretty sure that does next to nothing in pvp). I mean playing hide and seek like in the really real world- blocking line of sight, planning your route, ect. 
---
If they are using ranged then they are done as soon as you are in the the second position (one step and a strike). If they are in mellee and see you coming, than you would be surprised at the fact that almost nobody ever blocks. More so, even less people expect you to block.  
---
That's called strategy. And strategy will nearly always win out against the old spray and prey or run in blindly swinging. 
---
This is even easier in adventure mode because the asshole attacker is always at a disadvantage because their initial strike doesn't even hurt at all.
---
Ah thats too bad, thanks for the response though! 
---
It isn‚Äôt selling XP.  It is selling the ability make faster. 
---
Everyone is always so salty that someone found a better way to farm than they did.
---
I understand, darker nights were in the beta but idk why they changed it
---
I can just see it now... "Buy a cargobot pass! For the low price of 2,000 atoms, you can send your junk back to your stash. get 10 uses with each pass!"
---
It‚Äôs so dumb that the players who survive are punished. The fact that it distracts you from the core game while you keep checking the leader board so you know when to suicide is just so dumb
---
So why mention it? The only reason I can see is to make your opinion seem more reputable. And then telling your audience that you're "not an asshole" essentially, is just you trying desperately not to come across as one. You're welcome for clearing that up for you. 
---
Purchasing digital advancement with any kind of non-digital currency is pay to win. Obviously, there are different levels of such, but that's what happens when you break the term down. You pay to help yourself "win." Pretty simple really. Coming from 20+ years of knowing English...not that that makes me more informed, mind you...
---
P2W = an item you buy that gives advantages over other players
---
Have you tried contacting customer support?
---
I can do a lv85 SB in4-5 shots, but then again it's a AAE...
---
yes, dps is very important and i love my handmade, but an AA dose a lot of dmg in one shot, so they do work pretty good even on a SBQ...
---
I‚Äôm not trying to jump up into your face and screech you‚Äôre wrong, but again the main issue is that even if it was a plan, the atomic shop and atoms were pitched and promised to be only cosmetic and they‚Äôve gone ahead and broken their promise, and honestly I payed ¬£60 on day one and having hopes, and after that fiasco I‚Äôll be damned if bethesda starts taking the mick and going back on promises
---
We have ZERO idea what the datamined lunchboxes will do. Don't assume so much, it is a bad look.
---
I‚Äôm assuming this involves selling to vendor bots‚Äîhow does that work with the faction caps pools? I haven‚Äôt quite figured out how it all works, and often when I try to sell stuff, they‚Äôre out of caps. I‚Äôm imagining that if even a few people on a server are trying to farm caps at the same time, the pool is going to run out very quickly. 
---
I think it‚Äôs more about the precedent that it sets. It paves the way for more non cosmetic stuff.  
---
What are repairs kits? Is like a bunch of junk to repair it armor or something?
---
Porque no los dos!
---
Just when I‚Äôm reading this when I poop
---
They're adding pay to win utility items to an EARLY ACCESS INCOMPLETE GAME. That's just terrible. Pete Hines promised us the game would stay on the cosmetic side of the line when it comes to microtransactions.
---
God I love this game but Bethesda is really killing me here. 
---
I'll buy some with the atoms I earn from playing the game. 
---
Thats certainly a problem,  But I don't think it's the biggest one.  The worst part about this is the ability to avoid expensive repair costs that take hard to get materials.  You're effectively buying those hard to get mats with real world currency.    
---
VERY pay to win    
---
These need to be an in game item / recipe.  Probably just an item or the recipe would have to have a steep cost to be balanced with end game gear.
---
&gt; I don't find the "Repair Kits" p2w as they don't offer any real advantage more like a QoL thing for those who want to pay for it.
---
They allow people to fully spec out of repair perks because they can buy an endless supply of repair kits, they can use those perks in other areas making them stronger. How is that not a real advantage? 
---
6k
---
When I hover my curser over her it says overseer and I didn't get another hollow after I am become death???
---
I'd love more weather in general, heavy rain, snow in the mountains...but darker nights are a bad plan, because unlike in 4, we can't \_choose\_ if it's daytime or not, so it's just a shitty mechanic to force on people. 
---
How dare they pay for server infrastructure. 
---
Gw2 has items like these, but the key difference is the currency exchange, you can convert gold (ingame currency) to gems (the store currency).
---
The same would be converting caps into atoms which is not available, only irl money to store currency. 
---
They are DEFINITIVELY   pay to win.   The OP's point isn't the only issue with it.  You're able to pay for items with real world money that let you avoid heavy repair costs on end game items that take time to farm.   There is an exchange of real world money to an ingame item that affects your gameplay  &gt;  Pay 2 Win.
---
"I'd rather spend real money to repair my digital items because playing the game to do it is dumb so stop complaining" 
---
Get someone to kill all the enemies and fast travel away and move the camp 
---
Probably graphic issues. 
---
+ is still a drop item 
---
I mean, shear terror looks pretty cool tho 
---
OMG I love it! This is the largest appeal for me, the individual creativity that can come from the game. Even with it's limitations, there's some amazing ideas!
---
Plus what does this do for PVP. That's a clear pay to win, as now they will be able to instantly repair equipment? I'd assume they'd disable it but still. This is not cool. Just when shit seemed to be going awesome...
---
game works fine on ps4 
---
"Layid tomi?"
---
And it should.  This is the first step to far more Pay 2 win tendencies,  they even outlined in their posts.  It's a sign of things to come,  and if it doesn't get attention it won't have any chance of changing.
---
Truu
---
They're all useless in my opinion
---
Sorry. I'm used to sites like Twitter, where people make totally absurd assertions and then expect to be taken seriously. 
---
People are citing examples of how the definition of P2W have changed since it's introduction, and I humbly admit my own definition has become outdated against the masses.
---
Regardless, I'm saving my pitchfork and torches for mutations and major mechanic changing items.
---
This is exactly what I expect from Beth and this game. 
---
It's called reddit, lol. But for real, if you are on xbox there is a built in LFG function where you can post about looking for players to do an activity. 
---
Ah yes. The scorchqueen is so easy to farm for one repair kit.
---
You have no idea what p2w even means
---
After this they won‚Äôt get another penny off of me. Had bought cosmetics but pay to play is an outrage. They truly are take the..
---
Que annoying 5 minutes where he recaps everything from beta until now, followed by comparing it to anthem or destiny, and then directly reading Reddit and Kotaku articles. Yoooooongyea out *don't forget to visit my patreon* 
---
You have my sword! 
---
Dude you're doing it all wrong. You can get hundreds of screws in an hour or less just hitting a few locations for fans and typewriters and stuff like the Charleston Capital building, interiors in Watoga, etc. Also, those junk nodes out in the wild, you can build a junk extractor on if you put your camp there.
---
They never said they wanted to bring those items into the shop, but said how they wanted to find a way to bring them into the game. Hopefully, they DO NOT come in the Shop.
---
Works as morning. Only guns that reload round by round reload all round. Lever action, pump etc...  my quad lever reloads all 20 rounds. Same with my quad pump and quad single action. 
---
It's not bitching dude, it's a pretty serious issue. Regarding your issues with power armour, which one are you using and do you have power patcher. Since unlocking it weeks ago, I've only had to repair once and the cost was so insignificant it was almost nothing
---
except that nobody cares what juicehead's opinion is anymore. He's made a massive ass of himself over the last couple months and nobody takes him seriously
---
...and then there's yongyea....
---
"The Atomic Shop was founded to give you as much choice and variety in how you want to customize and celebrate your adventures. It doesn‚Äôt offer anything with a competitive advantage, and more so, it aims to bring joy not just to you, but the other dwellers around you."
---
From here: https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2a4GTCpUPyEsGCGYWyM6Q2/welcome-to-the-atomic-shop
---
Just wanted to point out the actual page that documents their hypocrisy. I don't think any argument needs to be made other than "you told us you wouldn't do this." This will cause me to lose trust in Bethesda just as things were looking up. 
---
I find myself completely agreeing with you! 
---
If we can make repair kits then so what. If they exclusive to the atom store, that sucks. But this would really only be an advantage to PvP players. 
---
Agreed, at level 27 I already have max rank Fireproof and a padded torso (haven't found a dense mod yet). But let's be honest, out of 24 players on a server not everyone is going to be a "PvPer worth their salt" lol. At least that's been my experience using the MIRV grenades so far.
---
Lololololol. I told you guys about this. I was told my experience with a Bethesda published MMO would not carry over. Incredible. It will get worse. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/96iag0/perk_cards_are_not_microtransations/e40muy5
---
I don‚Äôt think the whiffle bat thing was intentional honestly, just a cosmetic oversight overwriting the modded appearance.
---
Legendary glowing diseased rabbit has a nice ring to it.   
---
It‚Äôs already up LOL
---
Alright I'll try this when I get home. I've never had any problems with the camp system before.
---
But the animation is normal length right?
---
Because they said they would not have such things in the shop.
---
Same on xb1. I put my headset on and they are still super quiet. Join a party and it's fine. Oh well.
---
You don't understand the long-term of this. I've seen this EXACT thing happen in games. 
---
Next they tune the rate of ATOMS you get in game by making the challenges increasingly frustrating and difficult. Then the things in the Atom Shop become essential to have a good play experience. Soon it's not just repair kits, but a masked subscription fee to keep playing. 
---
Want 100% accuracy in VATS for PvP at double the maximum gun distance? Just drink a Nuka Cola Titanium, available now in the Atom Shop!
---
It's the start of an endemic problem. 
---
Just LOOK at Fortnite and how it's monetized. It isn't about the utility of the fucking item it's about what it means. 
---
It would be an advantage in an sbq fight when you don't have access to a crafting table.
---
Repair Kits are NOT QOL.   They are Pay 2 Win.  You pay real world currency for and item in game that lets you skip expensive repair costs,  saving hard to get materials you would've spent otherwise.  You are paying money for end game repair materials.
---
Not the comparison I was making, but nice strawman.  Repair versus switching, not repair vesus workbench.  I usually have half a dozen weapons on me.  Much rather switch than repair in PvP.
---
Ain't this the same shit people said about the Unstoppables outfits and their boosts?
---
Agreed. This is simply about what standard we PLAYERS set and hold them too. 
---
My issue is: Wait until fucking tuesday when they get implemented so we can actually see what's going on rather than treating a newsletter which is inconsistent in the accuracy of it's statements. But nom, get your pitchforks now folks!
---
I play games for fun not to defend crap
---
You paid for the game. Of course It's pay to play.
---
What if these repair kits were only useable in adventure mode? I wouldn't be too unhappy about that because it's not so much pay-to-win as paying to better enjoy my limited time playing. 
---
P.S. I'm not defending them going back on their word, just like to play devils advocate. 
---
Agreed üëç
---
I use power pylons to use wireless power
---
One pylon on one 10 power generator = 10 wireless power within a radius to power my lights,etc idk if it's a glitch or not idk but that's what I been doing 
---
They are 100% p2w.    You're buying expensive repair materials for real world currency.
---
If they make monetized non-cosmetic items the game deserves to die before they can exploit their playerbase. 
---
I feel the same for when I'm not in the top 3.
---
I'm suggesting that the PvP server be something other than 3 vs 15
---
Oh, I‚Äôm not against the idea of repair kits in the atom shop, i just think that everyone over reacting over everything and anything Bethesda is hilarious and a waste of potential energy. 
---
It is pay to win
---
1. You can buy atoms with money making it pay
---
2. The kits will give you an advantage in both pvp and pve. Let's say you are fighting someone in pvp and your best gun breaks. If you have a repair kit you can repair on the spot and continue fighting. If you don't you have to run and find a bench. If the enemy has a kit they will kill you before you find a bench. In pve if you are fighting a queen or a legendary or even an event you want to get done. When your gun breaks you will have to switch to a weaker gun or run and repair while the guy with the kit can keep fighting then get all the loot. Making it the win part.
---
So yes it is pay to win. But even worse like someone else said it is Bethesda testing how hard they can fuck us before we will complain. We have to nip this idea now or we are gonna get fucked later on.
---
Not on the lever or pump. I haven‚Äôt used my quad single action in months. 
---
The quad lever would sit there and load all 20 rounds pre fix for the lever action reload 
---
Thing is... ESO has a different PvP model, too. So, getting experience boosters and the like isn't a fast path to victory... it's a faster path to getting to a location to be on sort of equal ground for victory.
---
and really... "I paid real money to fix pretend shit, and get back into a scorchbeast fight faster than you" is pretty damn silly, if you ask me.
---
Yeah, sure, it can be a slippery slope to more paid items... but... that's a factor only for those who think in those terms. I see it as "a fool and his money...".
---
If you don't see this game as a giant competition... then none of this crap matters. 
---
IF Bethesda is to start hiding content behind paywalls... that's a different issue altogether.
---
Yeah I mean as you said, repairing is fairly easy and the repair kit itself, while helpful, I can see only really giving someone an edge if them fighting is extremely long and drawn out over multiple repair bars of their weapons since one person would have to run over to a workbench and repair while the other just instantly repairs from their inventory. 
---
The thing is, this seems like they‚Äôre testing the waters to see if adding in pay to win elements into the game is well received by the community or not. It would have turned a ton of people away from the game if the first pay to win aspect they added in was, for example, the ability to buy a legendary gun of any choice with any modifiers through the atomic shop as most people would see that and immediately be upset since it means someone who just got the game 5 minutes ago could be as strong as someone who has been grinding since release. 
---
So again it‚Äôs not the repair kits itself, its the fact that letting them add in pay to win elements can lead to the game just being a game of ‚Äúwho can drop the most amount of money‚Äù which can really turn away those who don‚Äôt have the money to keep spending on the game just so they can keep up with those who do have the extra money to spend. 
---
Hope that clears up why people are upset with Bethesda‚Äôs choice to try and add the repair kits into the atomic shop! 
---
Don't bother trying to convince this sub of it's foolishness, you will just be downvoted into oblivion.  People went all "omg its p2w" when ESO added consumables and services...they screamed, "soon there will be epic items to buy in the store if we allow this".  Well..its like 4 years later or something and it's still not p2w, lol.  
---
Should be an option for " Ok if they cost less than 100 atoms"
---
I personally don't get it. Is it really that hard for people to repair their stuff? I have plenty of weapons and PA so that even if i'm short on screws or something I can switch until I have the resources. Not to mention the perk cards to make this easier. I won't buy any because I don't need any. If I get one as a reward then i'll use it. I just don't get the point to the repair kits. 
---
Dude, your the first person I've seen that can't tell the difference. But you say that everyone else is wrong... Either you're wrong or just about everyone else is. 
---
The odds aren't in your favor man.
---
Honestly luck, your other option is to grind it from a workshop I‚Äôve heard the steel mill is a good spot for it as a reward
---
Then the game should have been free to play or atleast released In a complete state rather than early access 
---
Weird flex but okay 
---
In game there is a system of lootchests you can purchase keys for called Treasure Hunter. These lootchests (especially during events) have a high occurrence of bonus xp (double xp for that skill while training) or straight up experience through magic lamps.  
---
On top of that, there are now items in game called Bonds that you can buy from Jagex.  These items are redeemable for Runecoin (Runescape's mtx currency), Treasure Hunter Keys, or for two weeks of subscription to the game.  These can be traded for gold in game (last time I played they were worth 16-22 million gold each depending on the event going on for Treasure Hunter). 
---
So endgame weapons are made easily purchasable through bonds, max level experience through treasure hunter, and the runecoin shop (which was originally cosmetic only) has a few helpful in game items, such as bank boosters for more bank space and rune pouches to store spells instead of having runes take up inventory.
---
I got flamed to high hell for calling out that +10 or +15 HP boost for what it was, a data grab. They have data to show us that we'll pay money for in game buffs. Is the context warped? Yes. Does it matter to them? No. 
---
Good lord that guy needs to go play in traffic.
---
Can we get a "I do care and it's a slippery slope option"?
---
Are my clean water purifiers also quieter?  I never noticed!
---
Where them on alternating days, obviously 
---
I'd be interested at 3/per. Maybe like 2000?
---
I'm just not seeing it. Maybe you fast travel more than me or something. With Good With Salt I can cook a stack of food and have it last for hours.
---
Its QOL considering you can get Atom Points by playing the game hence not having to spend money. if you can only buy Atom Points then yes but you get a ton for free just for playing the game
---
No I'm pretty sure it does apply to weapons, because on one of my alts I used weapons that didn't have legendary effects, no perks to increase damage (wanted to see what it would be like without them without altering my main characters perk build) and no mutations/drugs/drinks to increase damage, and I do see a change i damage for guns such as The Dragon but also some simple guns like a 10mm submachine gun and melee weapons like the mole miner gauntlet and fire axe, I do definitely recall seeing damage decrease, mostly predominant in The Dragon since that decreases a lot.
---
Weapon reduction was removed in Fo4 btw, and in Fo3 and FoNV to repair weapons you had use the same weapon or a similar exception (like Riot gear being able to be repaired with combat armour)(God they need to add jury rigger perk back and that type of repairing back).
---
Weapon health affecting damage is definitely not looked at a lot by players since it was mostly forgotten due to Fo4 or just new players don't know about it.
---
Also just checked both pages in case it was copied and pasted, but it seems to have not been copied and pasted, because the first link I sent just directs you to the secound link when you scroll down to find Fallout 76
---
Being able to purchase a one time use consumables that instantly repairs your weapon, from a store that's suppose to only be comsetics is shitty. Regardless of how insignificant a repair kit is, next we could get triple exp drinks, or special variants of ammo that do way more damage. What about buffs that increase your chances for a legendary. Is it starting to sound like p2w now?
---
This might be it, though! 
---
You're using bad language in this poll. People will quibble over "pay to win". 
---
No no no this is reddit, if there is any hint of a change all of us will lose our collective hive minds and boycott everything until nothing happens 
---
It's almost like there's a search bar and everything.
---
gonna cry?
---
They're listed in the same breath as the Atom Shop exclusive Basic Repair Kits. 
---
Simple solution, make better cosmetics that people want to buy.
---
Haha yes they will definitely see this one post.
---
Ps minigun gangüí™
---
Which is also a +40 health boost if you had a full team suited up. Which really is actually a pretty decent buff.
---
Let me know what/if any lever actions you have.
---
Piss your pants?
---
Well i said what they think but I'll change it have a better suggestion?
---
Yes. This week, each of the 7 factions has a pool of 200 caps/per player... the Responders, Raiders, and Whitespring have multiple vendor bots across the map. the others, for practical use, have a location each, a couple in Watoga, one in Harpers Ferry, and Modus. It resets every day. The pool is base 200 caps... if you sell 200 caps worth, and anything you buy will partially refresh that. 
---
So, you stop by one everyday. Sell everything to get the vendor to zero. Buy whatever. Then sell down again. There's a C.A.M.P. sweet spot, assuming you are lvl26, that can get you to 6 of the 7 for under 10 caps fast travel+ Travel Agent perk.
---
However, next week, I think, the factions will all be available at Whitespring, and I think they will all share a single, 1400 cap pool. This will make purchasing AND selling much easier, you can head to the Whitespring Mall to buy stuff, and probably hit whatever vendor is closest to sell.
---
Yeah I worry sometimes about the parallels between the Atom Shop and Solomon's General Store.  SGS started as a cosmetic-only shop.  I finally got tired of all the MTX BS Runescape has been pulling as of late and stopped my subscription in November of last year.
---
That's what I think of every time it comes back up, but considering I still have zero issues managing food spoilage I'm thinking it's just like the supposed trade stealing bugs and such. It's a non issue.
---
It's not the convenience of being able to repair anywhere that people are upset with. It is the fact that you are purchasing materials and thus game time used to harvest those materials. Have $$$$$$$ = no longer need to harvest screws from sugar grove or ballistic fabric from the asylum.
---
I'm not saying we are, I'm saying if we complain it will be better than just leaving it s they don't see we hate it
---
It's about the principle. The cosmetics only promise is a big thing to many of us. I'm not going to continue purchasing them if they become a cheesy mobile game convenience store.
---
Yeah if they tought that doing the exact opposite of what they promised was going to help out their game they must be as smart as the people defending the idea. Jokes on them their not getting my money lol 
---
This sounds like something that would work well as part of the back-pack expansion. 
---
I'm fine with unlockable via atomic shop as long as it's also unlockable via game. 
---
If they go through with this I cannot see private/mod servers ever becoming a feature like they said it would. First thing people would do is find the server that takes all this stuff out of the atom shop and just make characters there.
---
I'm not really hopeful that they'll have private/mod servers anyway at this rate, but this would be the final nail in the coffin.
---
Bethesda lost all my support. They have turned into Activision/EA recently... Corporate bastards not loving their fans any more only the cash. ES6 will flop as well, calling it.
---
I think I was pretty fair about it. It sucks they are planning on doing this, but it can hopefully be avoided with just communication and being clear with Bethesda "no we don't want this" or so I hope.
---
Naw, think what you want, definitions change, but actions are actions.  There are people that don't care anything other than 'YOU SAID COSMETIC ONLY SO YOU'RE A LYING POS!!!11'
---
When they give us details, I'll see what those are, and I'm sure I'll stop caring at that point, I'm sure it won't be enough to get upset over (to me).  What grinds *your* gears is totally up to *you* though.  Just don't hang yourself up on a word or two (unless you're arguing the slippery slope thing, but that's another issue).
---
same experience, i think having an offline single player mode might help
---
You are the reason why games of this generation suck continually more and more and why companies take more and more advantage of people. Why do right when you can get away with doing the fanbase wrong? Why you‚Äôll even have people defending your wrongful treatment of the fanbase!
---
If Fallout 76 had a larger playerbase, more in line with Fortnite, or what Red Dead II could have had, then I would agree with you.  However, Fallout needs to build its base up before it can go down that road.  
---
Monitization only works if there are players, and if Bethesda did what you are suggesting they would just end up killing their own game.  I understand the concern, and lord knows FO76 had a brutal launch, but I have to think the powers that be at Bethesda are smarter than that.
---
Let me guess, your character name is XxHyperbole69xX
---
It‚Äôs ok! Go to Harpers ferry, buy the plan, and you can make one!
---
If you‚Äôre on the XBONE, I can give you one or craft you one!
---
The latest Inside the Vault makes me feel the game is going to move in a direction I'm not interested in.
---
Lazy gaming. 
---
Like send stuff to your stash box. Come on. There's Red Rockets and Trains Stations all over the world. I mean how much easier can someone make it.   
---
Ammo converters? Again, how lazy. 
---
I hate that the laziest but most vocal players are getting listened to more. Instead of making smart choices that make sense, they are just trying to please lazy gamers who just want to sit there pushing attack and loot. WHy not just have two options on the controllers.
---
Attack and Loot. 
---
Yeah it‚Äôs like a 1/100 that you really need them
---
I thought I got one yesterday actually I‚Äôll check when I get on later.
---
Just leave it, you aren't some hero sticking by a sick friend,  it's a company, they don't care about you
---
Agreed. Pretty soon coming to the atom near you: Vault Tec The Vault 76 battlepass! Only ;$/&amp;;$/&amp;;&amp; atoms!
---
That's definitely a good point. Now I can stop hoarding BF, springs, etc. Just kidding. I will never buy one of these. But it's something they obviously didn't consider and/or they are going back on their word about cosmetics only.
---
Mate up until the last few years companies didn't put microtransactions in their games and they payed for server infrastructure just fine. Now they also get money from cosmetics but they NEED paytowin in order to fund the servers? 
---
The issue has been resolved and you should now correctly earn double XP in Survival until 6am EDT on Monday.
---
Yeah, from what I can tell what we have are two game modes that encourage griefing instead of discouraging it.
---
Adventure mode should be for those who just want the casual fallout experience with friends.
---
**Survival** mode should be for those wanting the more hardcore roleplay like game mode, where you can raid or be raided but still be able to play the base game. You have to roleplay a dweller in the shit with roving bands of people ready to destroy everything you hold dear.
---
Then they should just have a pvp or deathmatch mode. For those who just want a straight pvp deathmatch experience. Take out the base building and streamline the pvp mechanics.
---
I'm all for Roleplay when everyone is explicitly understanding that roleplay is happening.
---
As it is now most casual players aren't into roleplaying, they want to do what bgs said at launch.
---
Play a fallout game with your friends.
---
If you click more info on adventure life at login, 
---
It says "the base Fallout 76 experience, focused on cooperative play. For those seeking to explore rebuild Appalachia with limited interference from hostile players." 
---
A good portion of this game is base building for a lot of people playing. if the "raiders" are specifically targeting people building their homes, and destroying them as they see fit and consequently destroying a large portion of your gameplay, how is that only "limited interference.
---
**"Rebuild Appalachia"**  how is this possible in the current state of the game.
---
And if bgs didn't want to try and cater the whole game to a thousand different audiences then it should have just been "Adventure in the wastes of Appalachia with death around every corner" pvp all the time, and the players have to individually decide to fight.
---
 Sure some will but others won't, the difference to how it is now to how that is, would be, that everyone going in would know that.
---
&gt;This is all in the same section as selling repair kits for ATOMS.
---
Repair kit *plans* for ATOMS.  That's why it talks about them being unlocked via the store.
---
Doesn't mean it's wonderful, but it's also not as evil as you're portraying it.
---
I wish I had a nerf gun type skin for my TS Hunting rifle
---
not really, let me try that
---
I just mean we can improve this shit show by sticking around and kicking up a storm, I'm not saying buy atoms if you haven't before, I just meant if you already do I would not stop just for this
---
This deserves a double platinum award.
---
Ya,   I put the game down a week after launch and have been excited to play with these last few updates.  I have a feeling thats going to be changing soon if they don't listen to the players on this one.
---
There is a gilded Gatling gun but it‚Äôs ridiculously rare and my dumbass scrapped it on accident üòû
---
Thats where my team is based, the lakes south of Eloise near the maps edge.
---
Yea I think it‚Äôs outrageously priced especially for how much budget per letter it uses, but the prices are that way because some people just have to have the plan, I make most of my caps grinding plans and outfits 
---
They should be thinking about how to make more money, but with *more* cosmetics. Especially for cosmetics they're low on, like hairstyles, facepaints, makeup, etc.
---
I‚Äôve gotten one before. Granted it was a 1* but I remember getting it. But people seem to tell me I‚Äôm wrong. 
---
LMFAO!!!! BETHESDA? BALANCE!? HAHAHAAHAHHAHA
---
Exactly. You wouldn‚Äôt need to bother; the new meta game is doing whatever events drops the repair kits or buy them. 
---
I‚Äôm in the don‚Äôt really care camp, but this could do with a ‚Äúsceptical‚Äù option, since we haven‚Äôt seen the specifics as to what exactly is being sold, it might be individual items, it might be the plan to craft them. 
---
Spend it elsewhere. P2W content has killed games by dividing the player base into the few that have the money to pay and do and the many who don't have the money and leave. It's an extremely slippery slope and most of us would not like to see Bethesda test the waters on that slope.
---
Sounds good, lemme check what I've got when I'm on later and we can figure something out? 
---
Idk, it seems more of a QOL thing for me. The fact that you can purchase the basic repair kit for atoms but earn the improved repair kit in game seems like a fair trade off for me. No ones gonna win a PvP fight because they can repair their gun anywhere, weapon workbenches are so ubiquitous in this game I never have a broken gun for more than 5 minutes.
---
I get where you‚Äôre coming from with the slippery slope argument but I don‚Äôt think this crosses the line yet and its more of a QOL thing for more casual players.
---
what part are you guys not getting? I'm not saying I like Bethesda, just we have already proven if we complain enough they will listen
---
I am so sorry that happened. People are asses. 
---
However know that people who do that are small. They have no power in the outside world and the only way they can feel big is to cause people grief in a virtual world, with no real consequences. Also know that these are the first people to say that is how the game is played. IT IS NOT. PVP IS OPTIONAL. THAT IS WHY THERE IS A PACIFIST MODE. 
---
Next time it happens. Tell your daughter to block them in Xbox and jump worlds. Explain to her how sad their lives must be to destroy somone else's happiness. Not to engage with people like that because they are only looking for attention and are unremarkable and can't get it anywhere else.
---
If on Xbox PM and I will send my gamer tag and I will play with her and be her back up.
---
Have you ever considered that lunchboxes maybe didnt come *because* people lost their shit?
---
Yeah spot on I'd say, you grind to find junk which some hate, but then they don't hate that Bethesda want to make a problem and sell a solution, leech money since you can "grind" for atoms, but... don't we already just grind for junk?...And thats bad?... 
---
Bit hypocritical if I may so say, so yeah, its a p2w con sugar coated to try and appeal people, which clearly isn't going well at all.
---
Fuck yes this is what I'm trying to explain to people. Repair kits aren't a huge advantage but selling all sorts of QoL items in the Atom Shop is a huge issue
---
Thank you. I would happily get a lesson. Colinwheeler on xbox.
---
I'm guessing FO76 team are jealous of all the hate Anthem is getting so are escalating to give people more reason to hate 76. 
---
You bought the game so you have to farm for legendary gear still. I dont see why spending easily acquired atom points is too different as long as its not:
---
A) Mandatory/constant (if its a plan to buy once im fine)
---
B) Cheap (200-300 atoms? i get that literally by accident in a few days)
---
IMO i would rather some of these things be guaranteed from the atomic shop than have to server hop dozens of times or get lucky someone has a plan i need.
---
Considering this really doesn't impact PvP, I can't imagine this being a major problem.  My weapons rarely break, I have the perk cards to keep that from happening.
---
And Atoms are pretty easy to earn.
---
I guess they may just be Uber rare, I really want a bloodied one, would be neat for a build 
---
If it is a low level player (sub 50), and its their main character I just craft gear for them and they're usually super appreciative. I have not had people do random trade requests. If they're on voice comms, just tell them you're willing to craft/mod gear for them and ask them if they can donate the junk required (if you're low on anything). 
---
Explain how to do things for those willing to listen... but just mute the entitled players though.
---
Here‚Äôs hoping they revert their idea of using current characters. 
---
That makes sense.  You can always craft the small kit from 10 screws, 10 springs, 20 lead, 20 steel and 20 plastic but have the larger ones take more.  
---

The worrying thing is the people that say I don't really care, I know it may sound a bit condescending, but no one in their right mind should be ok with paying real money for stuff like this. 
---
That's what I was thinking, "vintage cheese"
---
Look deeper.

‚ÄúDay‚Äù might be over-stretching, I prefer to do adventuring or quests than junk hunt outright. I‚Äôm 100% moving my camp to a junk node! 
---
I don't really care about repair kits (though they were a requested feature). What I want is to be able to repair weapons that are above 100% durability. Lugging around multiple chainsaws is a pain.
---
I'm not freaking out personally.  I just know how the click-bait/Jim Sterling type sites that feed off every bit of drama associated with gaming will react.  
---
It was kinda nice not to see Fallout 76 in their sites for a couple months and other victims such as Anthem take all the headlines.
---
&gt;But it sounds like it's more:  
---
&gt;\- Basic you buy in the atom shop only
---
Why do you think it sounds like this when they explicitly say the basic kit is *unlockable* via the store?
---
If it was just bought, there'd be no need to unlock.

Sounds good to me. I‚Äôll be on around 4pm PST through the evening.
---
I made the same mistake,  Nowhere in the article does it say plans.   Alot of other people are getting "plans" from somewhere too.
---
I think it depends on the channel tbh. The drama channels sure, but for a lot of bethtubers a really successful Fallout 76 would be better than more drama. 
---
When lots of people play and enjoy a game they tend to watch videos on it. Drama might be hot for a time, but its a short term viewership that doesn't normally stick around (unless you follow drama from game to game). 
---
Seeing this news wasn't really exciting for me, but more of a bummer.

---
Here's my main build at the moment by the way. 
---
I'm shuffling some things around so it's not perfect but I'm getting there. 
---
No bloodied, no weird armor or very specific perk combos. Just the old sneak up and stab you in the face. 
---
My main weapons are the Blade of Bastet, Vampire and +strength ski sword, and an instigating hunting rifle. I did just find a furious exploding +perception assault rifle though this morning so I'll probably use that a bit more (hence the need to spec into auto rifles). 
---
I'm no pvp killer by any stretch of the word but I'd say I have a good 80% win ratio.  
---
Ever heard of loading times.
---
Yeah. Clean slate a wasteland free of duped TSEs and Sentinel Bloodied sets spawn camping the train station vendors. 
---
Love this game. Please no pairs items like this. If repair costs are too high (which they sometimes are) Power Armor I‚Äôm looking at you. Then please rework the repair cost. Paid repair kits are not an adiquite option.
---
Also, I personally don‚Äôt struggle with repair costs because I rarely use PA but I know it‚Äôs an issue for some players.
---
Need an option for "I'm fine with them but move them to in-game"
---
There are conduits that go through walls 
---
Only if they make it so things like tents stop raining inside!
---
The thing is you get atoms really easily.  If you somehow are running short make a new toon and toms of atoms are suddenly raining down on you.
---
None of my weapons require rare or difficult to find materials.  At level 111, there hasn't been one time when I didn't have materials to repair weapons or armor since level 60.
---
No no, I gotta say people have cited and given examples of how the definition is much more fluid than it has been before, and I was absolutely in the wrong to speak as if my own interpretation picked up after the introduction of it in the like 2000's isn't more valid than others. I was wrong to come off like it was.
---
I disagree. Why should it be "free to play"? Because you want it to be? Because....  you say so? Because it works out better for your wallet?
---
1 100% guarantee that you have a library full of games, some unplayed or half-played... games that cost you full price, half price or no price.
---
You don't have to spend a dime on this game beyond initial purchase, unless you have *severe* FOMO. 
---
If and when Bethesda begins to bury game content behind paywalls, I'll opt out. All I see so far is paid items that only matter to the players that have to be on top, always. 
---
Speculation is a fool's game. Everyone can run around all day screaming the sky is falling.. I prefer to wait until it actually starts falling. and... beyond that... I can't do fuck all about it when it does, expect crack a beer and do my thing.
---
If the game somehow goes P2W... I'm out. Simple. 
---
It isn't hyperbole if it's been happening to DOZENS of other games. 
---
I doubt it plans, mainly because why they add it in that way. Why not add it in as a quest reward for the new scouts questline. It makes sense that scouts would carry repair kits.
---
Nope - pretty sure they were being setup for specific events/raid rewards. But then they got backtracked into fixing problems for 4 months. 
---
Anyone who thinks repair kits are P2W clearly just doesn't know what P2W means.
---
In multiplayer games, people who see a slight advantage or easy road that requires money will ALWAYS TAKE IT if possible.
---
Even if the advantage isn‚Äôt too significant, people will buy so much of it to the point where it does become a huge advantage.
---
That‚Äôs the problem with CoC.
---
K I should be on closer to 6-ish. PSN Skizzunky
---
Assuming that rare time a weapon or armor actually breaks?  Not an issue.
---
Youtubers are gonna have a blast at this new source of news. 
---
Eververse was never treated as pay-to-win, only people worried about it becoming pay-to-win. The only thing Destiny's microtransaction shop has that could be considered pay-to-win is a 10% xp boost for like 2 hours
---
Just because it wouldn't make sense for them to do it doesn't mean they won't. Like, I mean look at the fucking bag. That's basic competence there and they blew that by switching to nylon and trying to tell people canvas wasn't available. 
---
They'll do it. 
---
Is anybody really surprised here?
---
Read the article again:
---
If it was actually purchasing the items, why are they "unlockable"?
---
It's plans.  Everything else in the store is plans.  Plans would unlock the item.
---
The problem is a person has to open their Pip-Boy, scroll to their weapon and click inspect. That is a long time in a pvp battle. 
---
Recognize entitlement for what it is, disengage politely. You owe them nothing. 
---
I think we're overreacting here. Everything listed here seems like quality of life stuff, or extras on top of an already pretty solid experience. I can't see any of these things really tipping the scales for anyone significantly.
---
Personally, I'd love something to spend Atoms on. The game makes it stupid easy to earn them.
---
Dunno. I'd really like to see us not flip out about small stuff like this.
---
I just really hope this gets alot of attention.  I've been enjoying where the game has been going the last couple patches after being really bummed about the release.   I'd like to keep being excited to play.
---
Where's the petition, lemme sign it! Fuck microtransactions, this is a full priced game...
---
It's like the Twilight Zone. I keep watching games die due to P2W, and this is how it starts. The crazy hair-on-fire alarmists are right, but by the time the verdict is in, nearly everyone will have left the game. 
---
True. But F2P mechanics in a ¬£60 game is something I think we can agree is a bad move, particularly when the opposite was posted. 
---
The game just runs like arse. I exceed the recommended specs and still get stutters, 1-5 second freezes. I run the game on mostly minimum settings too.  It‚Äôs been this bad since fallout4 but at least with fallout 4 modders made fixes. 
---
I‚Äôm really disappointed they haven‚Äôt done much to sort performance. I was expecting better. 
---
They are if you play 50 hours a week or so. Many of us don't, and earn Atoms very slowly.
---
Also, the Atoms isn't the point. The point is they broke their promise.
---
Why is it "unlockable" if it's an item?
---
Also, every other thing in the shop is a plan.
---
Also, items crafted from Atom-bought plans are not tradeable.   Like the kits.
---
It's plans.
---
You're certainly free to infer that.   
---
But, lets consider it is a plan  (And they just forgot to mention that)  You pay for a plan with atoms.  How much is this recipe going to cost to make a Kit?  Is it going to be really expensive on par with high end gear crafting costs?  Is it going to be cheap?  Moderate?  If that kit doesn't cost alot of high end materials it's going to be the go to repair method for any high end gear.   making farming high end materials nearly obsolete.  You think they would do that?
---
u/LadyDevann 
---
Tell them we said NO.
---
I'd settle for that if they made it so they only showed up if there were within X amount of distance. But yeah I'd prefer nobody show up and people actually need to scout for raider camps or hire muscle. Pay a high level person to get you to your mission because a new gang set up shop, that would be sweet.
---
first fasnacht masks not dropping , the player vending delayed and P2W now? Is Bethesda killing this game?
---
That's my worry. I hope they make this burrow awesome and give it some unique rewards. Even cosmetic ones would be cool.
---
You get shit loads of atoms for free in game. Anyone who pays real money for atoms is either impatient or financially stable enough to have that kind of disposable income, and in such case you shouldn't be bitching either because you're rich.
---
While that‚Äôs true, I wish more companies followed the Warframe business model. The game is free. Everything is obtainable in game for free with enough play time. Purchasable currency is transferable between players as a trade currency. Even then, there are some rare materials that are required for some of the best gear that you can ONLY obtain by farming them, they are NOT available for purchase. They also steer clear of any pay for service that they feel is predatory. Example, a few years ago they introduced Kubrows (dogs that you can hatch from eggs and are companions that help you in combat) and since from birth, the appearance is determined by the genetics of the pets parents, they instituted a 20 platinum (pay for currency) slot machine to randomly reroll the appearance. Since many players value ‚ÄòFashion Framing‚Äô (investing in cosmetics to look as good as possible), some players used this feature a lot. One player even rolled around 250 times, spending 5000 platinum. After a couple of days, when they got the reports about this new system to see how it was received, they saw the numbers for how many times people were rerolling the appearance, and they immediately removed the feature and issued an apology to the community for instituting what they felt to be a predatory micro transaction, and the community was like ‚Äòthat wasn‚Äôt what it was intended to be? Oh...well, you‚Äôre...forgiven?‚Äô I have never heard of anything like that before, and I was shocked to hear that happened, especially with how games (especially free to play games) have been tending more and more towards micro transactions over the last few years
---
No u can buy them
---
&gt; Pretty ballsy of Beth to include a pretty obvious Pay-to-win item
---
It isn't pay to win, it's pay for convenience which is why they are using to test the water. The fact that it isn't a cosmetic item and isn't a combat item mean it kind of rides the lines between the two. It breaks their promise of cosmetic only and can influence their decisions in the future (like reducing durability so players are more likely to buy repair kits) which is what we should be calling them out on.
---
yep terrible direction.
---
No trick is needed, as I said there‚Äôs a conduit piece meant for what all these people are complaining about a lack of.
---
The analogy is pretty accurate. In black desert the initial p2w complaint was that you can buy costumes for real money and then extract chron stones and use those stones to prevent item degradation (repair them).
---
Except the basic kits only go to 100% and the improved are ingame drops only so ill never use those because they are worse then juat repairing your weapons and armor to 200%.
---
wrong, they already said on the inside the vault that the repair kits you buy will be one use only
---
Beth did way too many of those get slammed and take a picture naked challenges.
---
Defo! Let the players find each other in an organic manner. I hate all this forced interaction that just comes riddled with exploits. 
---
So i guess then if you feel that way, please advise how this is pay to win. What exactly is some one winning by spending money on these items?
---
OH, it‚Äôs per player, I didn‚Äôt know that üòÖ Thanks for clearing that up! So if I see that the Lewisburg vendor has 193 caps, another player standing right next to me in the station might see a different number of caps in the trade screen? And if I jumped servers, I‚Äôd see that the vendor still has 193 caps?
---
I honestly don‚Äôt care! I spend hours on a game which after the initial outlay, COSTS . ME. NOTHING. I don‚Äôt mind spending more money and getting some cool decorations etc, we all have a chance to get free atoms every day in this game, what you choose to buy with them is your decision.
---
Said it once and said it again. roadmap looked decent, but implementation is what was going to kill it.
---
I forgot that AWS said they would accept caps out of fall out 76 in exchange for paying for all those servers they host. /s
---
The Assault Rifle is based on the MG-08/15, a weapon of German design.
---
It should stay on 5.56 but have much higher damage, and have slower handling with better recoil (than it already has).
---
It should be the best AR IMO, because it‚Äôs a combo of an MG and AR.
---
Judging by how Fasnacht went and whatnot.  It needs to be.  New bosses, new enemies, better loot!
---
lol,  ok.    Let everyone know!  Repair kits are a-ok!  This guy doesn't need em!
---
I will uninstall the game as soon as they add any non-cosmetic item to the Atom Store. 
---
u/LadyDevann
---
Tell them we said NO!
---
They were heavily requested for awhile. Maybe a month or 2 after launch.
---
I'm more angry at the fact that player vending got pushed to May. I have a maxed out stash box full of Legendary items waiting for that feature. &lt;sigh&gt;
---
I can try.
---
Drink from the sulfur water fountain in the whitesprings gazebo east of the golf club. It is about a 10 second walk. It'll cure disease
---
Bethesda, please don't go down this road. I have been a huge fan since Morrowind. Fallout is my favorite fantasy world and I lived FO4 enough to buy it and all dlc for PC and PS4. I have been playing FO76 almost daily since beta (and as much of beta as allowed). This will open the floodgates. It may start as a slow drip, but someone will come along and make it a steady flow. Then when "not enough revenue" is being made it will turn into every other pay to win game out there.

---
I am glad its not a mobile game, imagine getting advertisements every 5 min... XD
---
Apparently enough people have been asking for it?  
---
I don't recall ever seeing anything about people asking for them but who knows...
---
Don‚Äôt worry! A fix is on the way! Keep your eyes peeled for our new refrigerator coming to the atom shop soon! But act fast, it won‚Äôt stick around for long!
---
How about they just give me my private server!
---
There is a difference between ease of management, and the actual timers for spoiling/hunger/thirst being changed though.
---
It is easy now, without any spoilage perks. 
---
It was much easier before. 
---
Much less obnoxious before as well. I didn't use to have to PLAN around spoil timers to play the game. Now I do have to do some planning around them or I lose 32 meats in a half hour of play like I did last night. It's still easy, just far more annoying.
---
None of this matters.  You \_can\_ purchase a hundred dollars in atoms and speed-repair gear in the field. The fact that you can \_also\_ spend a couple of weeks grinding for atoms to be able to speed repair \_one\_ item in the field is immaterial. Also, the text talks about them as individual, non transferable items, and the word "blueprint" is never used.   
---
Your optimism is great, but bethesda doesn't \_deserve\_ it. 
---
They're not out yet, it is just a planned feature for right now (hopefully that means it can be unplanned) 
---
Then they clearly world have written that these kits are craftable at some bench. Instead they just talk about having these kits in your inventory.
---
And even then, it's a breach of trust by first promising that Atom shops would be cosmetic only and then going back on that. What next? Exclusive gear? Access to restricted areas?
---
I agree and I'm not saying people should like them but the short sighted, selfish view of "fuck Bethesda" that so many members are choosing will just cause Bethesda to ignore the problem or for the game to die out
---
Lmao 
---
I told you guys about this. I was told my experience with a Bethesda published MMO would not carry over. Incredible. It will get worse. 
---
yeah its not showing on the link
---
inb4 "But you can earn atoms in game"
---
Can‚Äôt get much more clear than it being present in the list of connectors.  What do you expect?  The game to exclaim ‚Äúhey dumbass there‚Äôs a connector your cabbage head self can use instead of wall glitches‚Äù.
---
I fail to see how this is an issue... it‚Äôs a clearly visible piece with a clear purpose.  Of all the camp problems this really isn‚Äôt something to worry about.
---
&gt; The problem is that they promised no non cosmetics in the cash shop.
---
Yeah, if true than I definitely agree with you there, do you have a source for that? Id be interested in it
---
Just announced, not implemented yet.
---
We don't even have any real details about how it all works.
---
&gt;If that kit doesn't cost alot of high end materials it's going to be the go to repair method for any high end gear.
---
High-end gear doesn't require much rare stuff to repair it.  Also, the kit only repairs to 100%, so you're missing out on the extra damage/DR you get when using your 200% repair cards.
---
As for the rest of your questions, they're not answerable at this time.
---
Yes. Unless there's a glitch.
---
Read the post.... "unlockable" everyone calm the fuck down
---
You guys ever notice that as soon as there's a problem around here everybody starts paying to win? Oughta leave this world behind...
---
Exactly. I really don't understand that people somehow expect game worlds to be more fair than the real world. Haha
---
As long as massive functionality isn't locked behind a paywall, I'm fine with people having an option to pay instead with atoms, especially since atoms are also even available in game for free if you put in the effort so technically speaking it's more of an effort wall.
---
 I play regularly and haven't bought atoms yet with cash. I rarely have had under 1000 at any given time even with regularly buying things. 
---
They broke a lot of promises, why does this one matter so much? And saying that you have to play 50h a week is a gross exaggeration. I've never played anywhere close to that and I have thousands of atoms. 
---
Imo here we go.
---
Not what I said at all, way to completely twist my words. I said IF they wont keep the atom shop bound to cosmetics THEN they should have been F2P \*OR\* they should have released the game in a \*\*COMPLETE\*\* state, rather than an incomplete broken one. I don't \*want\* it to be f2p. If it was up to me this game would have came out in a complete state with compelling content in the early, mid, and end game.
---
I think looking at this as a potential stepping stone isn't complete speculation. In fact, I'd say its pretty obvious that they're testing the waters. I'm sure if the blow back from this is big enough, they will hold back on adding more advantageous BS "utility" items. I think there's more speculation when it comes to Bethesda actually finishing this game because we honestly don't know what they're doing. Its been like 5 months and all we've seen right now is a parade made pre-launch that offers 3 minutes of very low level content.
---
I really love this game. So I don't want to be forced to opt out. I'd love to see where it goes and see what it looks like where its finally complete.
---
I feel like the devs are just reading a memo from the bosses and doing what they are told. Unless the burrow stuff coming requires the need for these things. I don‚Äôt see a reason for their existence. We have weapon artisan and fix it good as perks. 
---
Oh god it didn‚Äôt happen again did it
---
I think there are a lot of people who have atoms they have earned that they want to spend but don't care about cosmetics.  While people assume the worst, at least you actually get something of value from completing challenges.
---
P2W means buying an item that gives advantages over other players. Why is it even an option here?
---
Same man! I buy em fairly often, I love the game and don‚Äôt mind at all paying back to the enjoyment it gives me.
---
it seems like it
---
If you only have to unlock it once then craft them indefinitely, then I don't think this is so bad.  You get plenty of free atoms, especially as a new player, so a one-time hit is pretty reasonable.  Although I hope they offer it at a discount or free when it's released, since I've burned through most of my free ones already.
---
If it was something you have to buy every time, then I'd consider it pay-to-win.  THAT would definitely be pitchfork-worthy.

Bethesda felt they gained a tiny bit of good will, now they must crush it with more of this GREEDY BULLSHIT!!! 
---
They are chomping at the bit to find the laziest way to into our wallets...
---
Well I don‚Äôt have the ones you want, I have a 1* instigating, 2* assassin‚Äôs explosive.
---
also they say it's been widely requested...where? I never heard of it untill this inside the vault
---
Ohhh okay. I thought they were released. All the commotion about these things made me think they were out. But that explains alot thanks bro.
---
Yeah I know lol.   There's things I love about this game, but I don't understand how the hell Bethesda ever thought this was a good system.  I've felt the same way about a lot of  things in this game. Some of their design choices are so baffling to me. 
---
Because people seem to think it i don't but if people see it as such it should be an option 
---
Who said abandon? I say just boycott the shop. Spend nothing.
---
I think you're not getting my point
---
One of the main obstacles to having a really monster DPS build is having to waste perk slots on stuff like this
---
I‚Äôm thinking for dungeons. When your deep in a dungeon and something breaks you can‚Äôt really pop out to go repair too easily. 
---
The valuable materials they would have used otherwise.
---
NO NO NO NO HELLLLL NO! This is the pathway to Pay 2 Win, don't do this, PLEASE don't do this, think of the backlash, after all the promises, THE PROMISES you made to keep the ATOM Shop cosmetic only, think of all the hate and drama this is going to cause
---
PLEASE, PLEASE DON'T DO THIS!
---
They absolutely can lose caps if they fail to defend.
---
But make it so they can't gain any caps. A mandatory death sentence is not a healthy mechanic.
---
That‚Äôs the problem. How hard is it to add more details to the ITV page. It‚Äôs not like they charge by the letter.  A reason is needed. 
---
Alright thanks everyone talking about it made me think It was released
---
I'd hand over my cash for a re-roll if they aren't going to give us any other option.
---
I don't think people leave over this, but making noise about it is good imo. When people bitch Bethesda responds. That may not be the most ideal relationship, but it is the proven one (tbt to push to talk and FoV) 
---
In this game, you can eat fat mans.
---
Put simply, heavy guns suck. 
---
Chameleons vs Scarecrows. I did my homework on this subject.
---
The basic kits being an Atomic Shop item is what I'm talking about. Plus advanced is only available as a drop from the Queen iirc. 
---
It's not a good combo to have one item available from the Shop that is supposed to be cosmetic only and the other item available as a rare drop from the big boss fight. 
---
A better way would be to have the repair kit plan available at vendors in-game. Or maybe, if it has to be in the Shop, make it free like they did with new quest posters.
---
It's still an instant advantage to be able to repair a beast weapon. And in the new mode you don't exactly know when you'll get attacked, and you may have a broken weapon that this would obviously give an advantage to.
---
yes I would do that but I have seen a lot of people in game, here and discord saying they will just leave the game over this

I sit at 19% HP with rads filling the rest of the meter. Unbuffed my Bloody .50 Cal does 331 per shot. With Adrenaline and Psycho I hit 650+.  With Revenant 900+ per shot, at 9 shots per second. Nothing in the game besides the SBQ stands against me for more than 1 second. Even Glowing Mirelurk Queens, Hermit Crabs, and lvl 80 scorchbeasts die instantly at medium range. I can easily carry the SBQ fight with 8 other people standing around contributing nothing (and have, damn you lazy people!). 
---
I do very specific activities when farming - usually SBQ or running nuked Whitesprings over and over (I use my 2nd account as an anchor to stay on that world and reload it over and over).  There isn't much else for me to do besides those two things to farm legendaries and more ultracite ammo (which I don't really need). Both of these paint me as a target. I actually rolled a new character (the level 80) because losing 600 caps every death blows.
---
If I wanted to compete, I'd have to completely respec. No more power armor, no more heavy weapons. That's pretty much my characters entire identity. I'd like to be able to play with power armor and heavy weapons and be on close to even footing with other players.
---
Nice. Thanks a bunch!
---
Because it's a free to play game.
---
This is a full priced game with the boss literally saying from the beginning "cosmetics only", a game with enough scandal as it is.
---
Ok,  I'll give you an example.
---
You want to repair a hunting rifle.  It costs some screws, plastics, wood, springs, whatever.  Maybe you don't have that stuff and don't want to go farm.  Open your wallet and buy a repair kit,  You've just bought those in game items with real world currency.  
---
Start applying that to more expensive to repair end game gear, and you're saving alot of time farming stuff like ballistic fiber as an example, all because you opened your wallet.  
---
But you don't see, the weapon and armours (I forgot to mention armour damage threshold also scales with its health) only needs to get to 100% to have max output, the extra 200% is more of a "just so it doesn't break as fast and keep max output for longer".
---
And yeah, they are pretty bad but again that's on purpose as they're not there to replace workbenches, more of a survival strategy when weapons and armours are low health, it's a tactic because the in game ones are for ludicrous hard events like SBQ, where as if your in a pickle, need a quick help me, spend money and have your weapon brought back from being broken or just repaired.
---
&gt; Repair Kits were a popular request 
---
When?  I've never seen it requested.  If it was, it was probably the smallest of minorities.  What I have seen is more and more people wanting fridges, myself included.
---
What do you mean? Did Bethesda say they were pushing back player vendors?
---
For what it‚Äôs worth, I completely agree with you man, IMO it isn‚Äôt pay to win, you can earn atoms every day FOR FREE, then it‚Äôs up to you how you spend the FREE Atoms. It‚Äôs as simple as that.
---
I was thinking that might work, I just haven't tried yet. Good to know it does 
---
I have all my perks for durability. 
---
I personally can't be bothered using resources that I could use a repair kit I bought with in game earned currency. 
---
IF THIS WAS P2W. Id be outraged but this is the community over reacting to something minor 
---
I haven't bought a microtransaction in my life, yet here they are.
---
That "don't buy them" crap is cute on the internet, but it doesn't work in the real world where ten people will spend $5k on this crap. The only way to prevent this cancer is to raise hell each and every time it shows it's ugly head.
---
Man, they fucked up a BAG.

That wasn't rocket science.

Reread, the Inside the vault and I think you may be right. I guess it all comes down to how much it costs to craft.
---
I think I could be ok with this IF:
---
1) The atom costs wasn't a lot and you could quickly earn enough caps with dailies to get it.
---
2) The cost of materials for the repair kit was more than a typical repair.
---
I was one of the ones who was very vocally against the Unstoppables P2W Scenario as well. 
---
People were jumping down my neck that it broke the cosmetic only rule about the Atom shop. 
---
(You can check my comment history as well) I got a lot of downvotes. 
---
If you give Bethesda an Inch they will take a mile.
---
It worked! Vsync capped the frames at 180. SO thank you for that. shame its what we had to do but I'm back playin and I have u to thank ! hey if play the game on PC yourself feel free to add me up ign is    Sipsissimus! thanks again!
---
I'm on PC, but thanks for the offer.
---
The thing is, Harper's Ferry is currently a death trap at my level, and those plans are extremely expensive. 
---
Totally agree there's a difference between helpful utility like the repair kit and a game changing utility like a god ring or something. 
---
Completely agree, not commenting further as people on here are acting like dicks to anyone who won‚Äôt defend Bethesda poor choice.
---
I'm big mad.
---
Yes to next month it was mentioned in the inside the vault today
---
Or play the game and get the better ones for free
---
And how does that effect you playing the game? 
---
And how does that effect you playing the game?
---
That‚Äôs because unfortunately fallout 76 is a massive compromise. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love the fallout 76 formula but this game has so much untapped potential. Poor performance and bugs aside, it feels like every design choice was made to try and please everyone but all that does is please no one. How they‚Äôve handled PvP from the get go for example.
---
+you get a lot of stuff that makes game easier so the p2w gap is huge
---
I‚Äôm kinda curious what the rad situation will be like in there. Will I have to wear my x-01 or should I finally focus on getting a decent set of armor for when I‚Äôm not in my suit?
---
Except we were talking about repair kits. 
---
Not anything else. 
---
On the repair kit topic alone. It's not pay to win. 
---
They aren't adding anything else so save your outrage for that. 
---
My hope is that they treat it like most other games; there are specific legendaries you get from specific bosses, and those ofc have varied chances to drop.  This would encourage people to keep running it in the hopes of getting specific loot.
---
if you focus , you'll get the answers you need
---
I'm sure you mean atoms.
---
I can't imagine it being a plan, despite some people inferring as much.  If there was a single plan the recipe would have to be about as much as an expensive repair on a high end piece of gear or it would trivialize ALOT of repair costs
---
They stated that improved repair kits will be a rare drop. Unfortunately judging by the rare masks in the parade event they may be almost nonexistent.
---
You‚Äôre reading mod plans 
---
Yup, completely agree. They‚Äôre taking the piss now.
---
I‚Äôve been experiencing the same thing but thought it was just me not paying attention. Now you mention it, I‚Äôd agree with you. 
---
I'm not spending any Atoms for any repair kits to acquire. If I get my hands on a repair kit of either, it will be through solely gameplay.
---
This has no place in the Atomic store being cosmetics only, as it should remain. They first tried this with the Unstoppables outfits as a limited-time HP bonus, and now they're testing the waters with these repair kits. Let's stop this before it gets worse, and put our foot down as a whole. This is unacceptable. The only thing I want to spend Atom points on is cosmetic Atomic store additions or CAMP items which are cosmetic in nature. Keep to your word, don't break it, or you will undo all the progress of goodwill and rebounding you've built these past months.
---
Dont defend this like a bethesdrone... Its a slippery slope to more p2w... Those fridges will be p2w at this rate...
---
If they wanted that then there would be no map markers. 
---
I'm past level 200 which means I lose 400 caps.  
---
I can hear it already: "If you're past level 200, there's no reason you should be getting killed."   
---
The people saying that probably have a level 50 alt that they transferred all of their level 50  OP weapons over  to from another character. 
---
Seems like it. My level 1 character with no air and no caps is ready to get some levels. All she is going to have is a hunting rifle and some ammo lol. 
---
I like my cookies the way I like my Overwatch
---
With lots of salt
---
or on console, I'll just bite the bullet and get it on xbox when it comes out then on pc when it is out of the epic store. I'm sure it will be worth the money.
---
It's easier to place the conduit and then place the wall 
---
I get it, but your arguing with the wrong type of consumer, I buy Atoms all the time, I‚Äôm married, kids, the whole nine yards and do t get much time at al to earn free atoms by doing the in-game challenges, I don‚Äôt drink / smoke etc, so buying atoms is kinda ‚Äúmy thing‚Äù, I don‚Äôt mind, whatever they put in the shop is fine by me, I understand your point, but I guess everyone has different opinions.
---
This starts the pay to win. üò≠üò≠
---
They promised they wouldnt. üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
I don't have the same issues. I don't even plan well, I just have four tatos and four mutfruit at camp and regularly make stew. Then fast travel back to camp when I run out. Ammo is more of a problem for me than food ever is.
---
Handmades are viable (meaning logical to use, craft, and maintain)  at levels 35+. Are you not that level?
---
I haven‚Äôt been in fallout 76 news in a while, what‚Äôs this about?
---
I don‚Äôt have a problem with it at all. So no, I definitely will defend it. 
---
I can see it cost a coup hundred atoms, I can also see it being cheaper than your typical repair, but I don‚Äôt think they repair your weapons past 100%
---
Yeah whenever I try that the wall won't place. ü§î
---
And I was downvoted for saying that the ZOS team didn't help with the game. That topic seemed volatile and based entirely on whether the person you disagreed with was saying it was good or bad for the game.   
---
They said it'd be a smooth launch because ZOS has experience via ESO. I pointed out that Bethesda bought a studio that did online games and did the work for 76's online and got my inbox exploded by people saying that ZOS obviously helped. 
---
Its going to flop harder its finally getting better im just sick of it
---
Actually they get to prove to everyone else how much of a piece of shit they are, i think its part of the "look at me i want to be famous" generation. 
---
Imo thats because a majority of the "griefers" are obviously younger children and teens without access to PC platforms.  I imagine Playstation and Xbox are about even in the griefer department.
---
Not cool to pay to have aspects of the game easier to deal with... This is my vote of disapproval.
---
It‚Äôs twofold 
---
You can level up on a specific build much quicker if you don‚Äôt have to worry about perks related to repairs   You also don‚Äôt have to farm as much. 
---
Since you can‚Äôt respec perks very easily, or break them down to smaller values, it could take a long time to make the proper adjustments. 
---
My entire character and perk incentory would look a lot different.  It absolutely gives people an edge especially newer players under lvl 50. 
---
Yeah a gatling plasma used to break after one plasma core. I used 5cores and it never broke so good on that
---
They promised us...my heart is breaking. üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
Use some nukashine.
---
Do you understand the concept of whales? That "don't buy it" crap may sound clever, but when ten people out there are spending thousands, it doesn't work. The *majority* of people **don't** buy it, yet here it is.
---
The only way to stop this shit is to raise hell. Apathy solves nothing.
---
8========D
---
I mean I would do the challenges, Bethesda doesn't loose out if you don't do them
---
By the way if you want a full assassin set, I have multiple.
---
Really isnt a discussion to be had . What they want to do is is heinous.
---
What will it be?
---
Can not find the booblehead? Well, now they are in the store.
---
Can not you level up? It is good to have this meal with extra experience in the store.
---
Do you need more space? We have 200 more charges, just for one package in the store.
---
If people do nothing, this will make the game become a pay to win.
---
Gave a level 2 some water/food/ammo this morning outside the vault - got attacked 3 times - good times....
---
You callin' Bethesda a liar??
---
The chance of me buying atoms even one time until this games improves from it's already improved state will become never at all and the more of this they feature the less I'll play.
---
I did however read that the other repair kit is a Scorchbeast queen drop
---
People who support these types of microtransactions and defend them are absolutely bootlickers.
---
Pay to play is defined at the industry level as a service that provides a player or group of players an advantage in overall gameplay
---
Thinking what I will change of my CAMP XD
---
Well was gonna try to come back this weekend but looks like they just want the dumpster fire to keep burning. 
---
Same here its just tiring i stayed with this game through the shit but i cant hold on much longer next its xp boosters and loot boosters its going p2w
---
I'll admit it does sound ambiguous in the article and there are a lot of assumptions being made. Here's why:
---
\- Under the basic repair kit info: "Once you‚Äôve got a Repair Kit..." seems to indicate you buy them.
---
\- "We also felt we could try out something new with these, both in-game and in the Atomic Shop..." Right now, you buy a plan for a skin or camp item and it unlocks the crafting. If the repair kit did this, it wouldn't be something new. This seems to indicate a new mechanic. We are all assuming that means they are a single-use consumable that's purchased one at a time since that would be a new mechanic.
---
\- Bethesda constantly redefines words in marketing. Unlockable could very easily mean 'unlock a single repair kit for atoms' in this context. Look at how they redefined what a B.E.T.A. test is when the game launched.
---
Level 33.
---
I don't know if anyone's noticed, but they barely comment unless it's something they were already thinking about doing or has an easy answer. You'd have better luck asking Todd himself. 
---
from what I've read, it can be found in the wasteland as well.
---
Oh geez. That's a huge bummer. Maybe it's for the better? Like it had issues and they need extra time
---
So I just did a simple search and last couple months there were over a 20 separate posts directly suggesting repair kits. People suggest shit all the time, this isn't really out of nowhere.
---
Yes, if Mr Bethesda was here right now, I would call him a liar.
---
Well played.
---
Try on your camp.. craft some foods, open your inventory, look them and them craft some other foods and look bak inventory again.. boom! Your first foods lost some condition already.. wakanda shit is dis!?
---
I think you but the repair kit blueprint as apposed to individual kits, haven‚Äôt heard any of the other stuff tho 
---
He was busy driving Scorched into the pavement, like tent pegs, with his sledge at the time.
---
I was just trying to help.
---
Some of them have sounded like armour. In this quest where some woman on a recording suggests I get wood schematic to protect me, but what's the point if I can't craft it? 
---
Are armour plans rare or something?
---
They have to find more ways to monetize the game because it didn't sell as well as they had hoped and most people that did buy it stopped playing early on because it was such a huge clusterfuck. This direction doesn't surprise me at all. 
---
Random encounter. 
---
Totally agree with you repairing weapons isn't even a hassle if you know where to farm for junk
---
&gt; Thermos Lunch Boxes are one time consumable items that allow you to prevent one flux/food/drink item in your inventory from spoiling. Thermos Lunch Boxes will be unlockable in the Atomic Shop using Atoms.
---
Personally, if I could spend a little cash, to save a lot of the grinding for mats, I would probably pay it. Only if the price point is fair. 
---
I've noticed the same thing.  My numbers in my full Vanguard armor were mid 500's DR and mid 700's ER (better than my X-01) and an exploding legendary Protectron at Watoga would kill me every time I killed one up close.  In regular fights I was using Stimpaks like crazy.  In my lousy Excavator armor, I would survive the Protectron easily and in regular fights only occasionally needed a Stimpak.  As an experiment, I switched to some non-legendary armor in the mid 400 DR/ER range and I do just as well as I did in the full Vanguard set.  The numbers should tell the tale, shouldn't they?  I'm missing something.
---
They gotta track that though. To see how many people actually do them and price stuff out based on that. If they see no activity or sales they know something is wrong.
---
Me too, friend, me too
---
It's **NEVER** ok to go beyond cosmetic only in a $60 game.
---
1).. Your opening sentence sums up so much of what is wrong with online forums. I disagree with you, it doesn't mean I'm twisting your words.
---
2) How many games drop these days in a (your words) COMPLETE state? How many games, based on this engine, haven't been buggy on day one? This was a surprise to you, was it? 
---
3) We've seen non stop bug fixes, improvements and tweaks. The fact that some players have 8 hours a day and 16 on weekends to play, rushing to endgame... they're supposed to drop hundreds of hours of new content for those players in the first few months? I'm confused. Every where I look... 400 hours played, 500 hours played... 800 hours played. Look, if the game sucks so and lacks content... why the fuck is anyone playing it for hundreds of hours? 
---
At least on your last sentence, we agree.
---
As for utility items? I'm alllll for them. Let the "king of the hill" players pay to keep the game running. Good for them, thank you to all those players who want to pay to win, I appreciate it, keep up the good work. I'll continue to play this as I did ESO. I'll play, and once in a while, I'll drop a few bucks in support, to buy a new hat, or a cool new suit. 
---
If they get greedy... if, for some reason, they take the highly successful model from ESO and throw it all out the window, and decide to turn this into "Falloutnite", I'll move on to the next game. As it stands, I'm already around $0.20 per hour played in FO76, I've got my value out of it. 
---
If I support the game, If I like the game.. I am not opposed to spending money on it. I will not support it if it goes P2W.
---
It's on Bethesda to decide if they can make more money as it is, or going that route... it's a Business after all, and their FIRST reason for existence, gamer's egos aside... is to make money for their shareholders. 
---
Oh, I wasn't aware vault 15 was a handpicked control vault. My mistake.
---
What does this mean?? It means Bethesda are still fucking up a potentially great gameüíÄ
---
I‚Äôll find out here shortly when I log
---
Yeah, the advanced kits will, I was referring to the basic kits though. I'm guessing that it might be the plans for them like yung_bert76 mentioned.
---
It will we have to fight this until they take it out of plans
---
It‚Äôs only 4x as long if it‚Äôs a lever action and a pump shotgun
---
It starts with this but it‚Äôs a snowball effect.
---
I love this game and I want to see it do well so I'm just trying everything I can to make sure it doesn't flop. Ugh I bet juice head is going at it right now making a new video if this repair kit stuff stays it can only be a downward spiral from there.
---
Bethesda, naughty naughty naughty......
---
Stash your junk or you‚Äôll lose it in death lol, got all the up to level 10 before I actually noticed, I still think about all my lost junk 
---
Repair Kits should be something everyone can craft with junk they find in the world, just like in Fallout New Vegas.  The fact they may be complete items you can just buy goes completely against their initial stance on the Atomic Shop being ‚Äúcosmetic only.‚Äù  
---
If they want want to add the blueprint for Repair Kits in the Atomic Shop for FREE, sure.  Everyone has access to it but they have to manually craft them with the required materials.
---
Eh, adds to the Atomic shop are handled differently than other functions. Or would you rather they beta vending, and have a glitched vending machine that sells your 3* TSE at a discount? Or gives away all your stimpacks for free? Or pays someone to take your stuff? It takes what, 24 hours to datamine and exploit weaknesses? Vending will tie into your inventory and caps. Let's not expose these things any more than we have to. 
---
I'm in the same boat. I stopped playing around mid January, and just started again a week ago. If this happens, I'm done for good, won't bother keeping up with the news about the game, and will try my best to forget it exists.
---
Apparently they‚Äôll be introducing ‚Äúseasons‚Äù where players have to make a new character after each one is finished.
---
Something tells me you're not done.
---
Uhhh.... how much do you know about the alien blaster in this game? ‚ÄòCause if you don‚Äôt... it‚Äôs *terrible* in ‚Äò76
---
I never needed any repair kit \*at all\*.
---
I only see people going mad about something 100% no needed
---
Besides I am sitting on 5000k atoms, earned from the game... so... well...
---
I think you nailed my take/problem, I'm too literal with the term "win". The individual word itself is a bit different than how people take it as a whole in the "phrase". It meant a very specific thing when the mechanic was introduced, but it has kinda changed and evolved over time and my own and some older gamer's take on it doesn't quite encapsulate the whole of how it's used.
---
But they will probably take me from how many atoms they sale, if people start refusing to buy and just do challenges Bethesda loose since they don't gain any money from people solely getting atoms from challenges and if people do this they are basically giving away free content
---
If people also don't do the challenges Bethesda are not just givng stuff away for free
---
Lol...if this goes live...
---
Commenting on this because I had the same thing happen to me so looking forward hearing why. 
---
It doesn't matter, it's still something that gives you direct in-game power being sold for real money. It's pay to win.
---
If they stay on this path, there will come a time when there are 20 blueprints you need to buy for your character to be competitive.
---
And ultimately this is them breaking a core promise that motivated a lot of players. They said cosmetic only. Full stop. I would NEVER have purchased the game if there was even a hint that there would be ANYthing pay to win.
---
I would imagine it‚Äôs a just a emergency option. They probably don‚Äôt want to put workstations in the dungeons to keep them going and flowing smoothly. 
---
Making them craftable makes zero sense. Why would anyone waste the resources on repairing an item when they can just use a universal repair kit, which would undoubtedly cost fewer materials, not only creating a bigger demand for the mats to create them, but in turn devaluing all other junk items. To be honest, the atomic shop, besides making them quest rewards, is the best option, but only if they aren‚Äôt more than say, 25 atoms per. 
---
Hell, even make the plan timed exclusive for a few months, and then put it in the vendor pool for caps. But selling them for atoms is ridiculous. 
---
I read this like, "wait,  isn't this already available". Yes, yes it is
---
That does not make it acceptable however.
---
Repair kits were great in New Vegas, I'm all for their inclusion, but as player craftable items, not atomic shop nonsense.
---
#ocftas
---
They didn't say _who_ was requesting them.  Maybe it was their accountants who need that sweet Atom Shop money to balance their books.
---
Calling it now TES6 will be trash full of microtransactions. They will add more and more p2w shit if we let them do this. If you think it's not a big deal, then think about a pvp fight where you opponent just hotkeys repair kits and you will never win
---
Being available from the queen was an EXAMPLE. It‚Äôll likely come from dungeons as well. 
---
There is nothing wrong defending something 
---
The problem becomes if they start designing content that way. So far benches have been fairly common around...not everywhere but enough that you can find one to keep going. If they release something like this, will they start looking to design content where you're going to need to use the repair packs because there are no more benches?
---
They say the advanced ones will drop, and give the SBQ as an example...so will they be very rare? And of course you can't trade them or sell them so they become junk for some and others will be forced to grind or buy them to get the benefit or just to get through the new content of 'dungeons'.  
---
It seems a pretty minor thing right now, I just hope it doesn't herald a much worse issue and we don't see a huge array of non-cosmetic items coming to the store.
---
It was old. Like announcement day old, in a French or German interview. My phone is just about dead so I can‚Äôt link. But yeah he said it
---
Good for you. But those people paying for microtransactions are the ones keeping servers alive.
---
If you haven't spent a dime, and don't plan to... then why do you give a shit?
---
"Cancer"... LOL. Gamers are so fuckin' dramatic. It's a business. It's sole reason for existence is to make money, for the company, for it's employees and for it's shareholders.  Games are no different than automobiles, ipods, bags of chips, movies... they're created and sold to take cash from your pocket and put it in theirs.
---
All I see, time and again, is the same, tired, hackneyed shit... vote with your wallet. If nobody buys, then nobody will sell. That's 100% how this works. 
---
But, people will buy, They always buy. That's why the business model exists as it does. 
---
So... "raise hell", you "fight that cancer"... or, you can actually do something concrete... and not buy the games in the first place.
---
But all... this? This forum ranting, and telling others what to do and what to spend their money on? This is just jerking off in public. 
---
What system are you on? I would love to see this in person. Amazing design and setup.
---
The moment they released the costumes a while back that gave bonuses (which is technically pay-2-win), I knew that it would come to this.
---
No one in their  right mind is going to do this.... not with the 200% repair perks available at 43....  
---
I wonder how people will feel if what you buy in the ATOM shop is the plans to make Repair Kits?
---
Mines the one about repair items in the atom shop. Really catchy chorus. 
---
Then you still have the other person being screwed out of caps.
---
I'd still rather see a no caps / no pvp solution. Pair that with a true pacifist mode where you can neither do to nor take damage from other players. SWTOR handles the PVP flagging well from what I've seen. If you want to participate then you flag yourself. If you chose to turn off the flag then you must wait for through a 10 minute timer with no PVP. If you pvp then the timer resets. To prevent server hopping, just make it a daily choice. If you flag then you are pvp for the next 24 hours.
---
It absolutely opens the door for them to put legendary weapons and armor for sale.  It also opens the door for them to nerf certain items making it more necessary to go that route. 
---
Gotcha
---
Xbox
---
You have 5 Million Atoms? Ok, but not all of us play 20 hours a day.
---
I mean,  it doesn't say plan.  Just the kit.  I thought the same thing when I first read it,  but i'd rather take it at face value.  
---
Plus,  Thinking about how a repair kit plan would work just doesn't even seem feasable.  Would it be a single repair kit that repaired all the gear?  Would that repair kit cost alot?  Not alot?  Would it then make repairing a high end piece of gear trivial?  maybe it wouldn't be useful on low end gear cause it costs so much?   It just doesn't make sense how a single repair kit plan would be balanced.    
---
Plus,  they didn't say PLAN anywhere... so theres that.
---
Like to talk to these people that have been asking for them.....
---
Honestly what are they thinking the press around this game is bad and now this... Hope this gets them mass attacked so they back down
---
I figured out back in February that their are two people in charge of the game, fighting each other for dominance. It becomes more clear every patch. One side is making the game and the other is punishing the players.
---
You can craft mutations?
---
"Maybe" by The Ink Spots and "Uranium Strike." 
---
IKR 
---
I wish I had your group when fighting the queen. Takes an age for me. Last night a level 19, 15 and a couple of 60s showed up. Luckily a couple of level 200s arrived and we did enough to take it down.
---
Fair point about weapon degradation though. That's been much better lately. Which kinda also makes these items a bit pointless... although I still don't like them in the atom shop.
---
I promise you, every.Single.time. I've tried that my camp could no longer be placed and had to be broken down and rebuilt from scratch.
---
My camp did not take just an hour or two to build.
---
Doesn‚Äôt work unless you are unarmed (unless that‚Äôs been changed recently) 
---
That's fucking horse shit
---
I do know it‚Äôs absolutely horrendous. My hope is one day it‚Äôll get buffed, and I‚Äôll have a prime character for it, with tons of ammo.  Basically,  a fun little novelty character. (This will be character 5, I have a problem with leveling characters and then never playing them again)
---
I have an instigating sitting on deck for when he hits 50, just in case.
---
&gt;Basic Repair Kits will be unlockable in the Atomic Shop
---
is how it's worded in the English version
---
Maybe yours is bugged.  When I did it, I found I got about 50% extra damage if I was just in underwear, which is rather underwhelming considering how dangerous that would be.  Bloodied is objectively superior.
---
Could be that it has to have armor on but very light weight armor for it to be effective idk I had a few berserkers and they weren‚Äôt that great.
---
Oooh. Same here! Could I friend you and next time we‚Äôre both on, come see? 
---
My echo my shadow and me. 
---
Lonely is the man. 
---
Level 2xx here. Aside from max mele perks like slugger, i cheap build single star rifleman and heavygunner perks to make them usable. http://imgur.com/gallery/0NnpS5O
---
Yep that‚Äôs apparent 
---
A shit storm would surely ensue
---
I just can't do the bloodied thing. Too risky. 
---
I'm not trying flex or anything, but in a stand up fight, I'm going to beat you probably more than half the time. Instant head shot crit would wipe you immediately (especially if I switch to my executioners rifle)
---
In a fight where I can get even a two or three step drop on you, you be on the ground before your barrels are done spinning up realistically at least 80-90% of the time. 
---
But that's not what you are built for so that's all good. I agree. Start a new character if you want to pvp. I have 5 just for messing around with different styles (they are all  below 30 but that's neither here nor there) 
---
Also, they said the regular kit will be challenge rewards as well. There seems to be so many options of getting these things that I don‚Äôt understand why everyone is so pissed that OOHHH mAyBe if We need and emergency repair kit we‚Äôll have to pay a whole 10 atoms reeeeee üôÑ they haven‚Äôt even said a price but everyone wants to freak tf out. 
---
It literally says you can‚Äôt drop, trade, or sell these repair kits. The only thing that comes to mind with that is other atom shop items. They don‚Äôt want people buying them and then selling them to people for in game currency. It is the definition of pay to win. 
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter if they say they are ‚Äúplanning‚Äù on doing this because even if it is on their minds they are thinking of non-cosmetic items 
---
Personally, I think the best choice would be to have a mode with zero PVP and another mode with unrestricted PVP.  
---
The "no PVP" mode would even include workshops. Want a workshop that's taken? Find another server.  If a huge majority think that's just a terrible idea, then at least make the workshops  defensible,  where with the right amount if turrets it's nearly impossible to contest.  It's absurd that  a workshop loaded with missile turrets can be easily taken by someone with a stealth boy and a death claw gauntlet. 
---
The PVP mode doesn't have to do away with fast travel. And it doesn't need a leader board tracking the top three. It could operate the same as adventure mode, but with other players being a potential threat. In PVP mode workshops can be contested. 
---
That's a better way to do it IMO. 
---
Arms I would say Targetting or Recon. One (almost always) highlights all enemies in red (and sometimes neutrals, like Whitesprings bits or camp turrets). The other is like a recon scope, but whatever your gun, anytime you aim at something. It‚Äôs also currently exclusive to the x-01
---
We should probably not let them get away with this because it will escalate to something worse before we know it. 
---
Ah, so "they" requested Mr Bethesda to develop a perk card that extracts more money from players wallets.  Rank 1 is Repair kits.
---
God, I love ‚ÄúUranium Strike‚Äù
---
&gt; It's the start of an endemic problem. Just LOOK at Fortnite and how it's monetized. It isn't about the utility of the fucking item it's about what it means.
---
Ok, lets look at fornite then, the **FREE** game that generated $2.4bn in 2018 alone, making it the most profitable game of the year by almost a billion dollars selling shit that you dont need to buy, this is how videogames earn money, but, the games still arent comparable. You saying that the game will be locked behind a paywall holds no weight, there is no basis for it since they havent said anything about atom locked weaponry or armor that you will be forced to buy to remain competitively viable and I see no indication of them introducing anything that isnt a skin or QoL shit that you can just get the materials for in game.
---
Again, videogames cost more to make and less to buy than ever, consumers will not pay the price they should cost so this is the middle ground, would you rather have a $120 retail pricetag?
---
Lets not pretend that this is so EA style fuckery, and if you really think it is then protest with you wallet and/or your time
---
The Repair Kits are a great idea them being payed for is what he is defending they suck now cause p2w has to ruin the good ideas... 
---
Imagine trying to complete the dungeon but you got the one guy running around looting everything and scrapping while you just want to get through it and kill the bosses lol. That would drive me insane personally. 
---
I disagree; without any way to find people to PVP in survival, it ends up being easier to just hunt workshops in adventure mode.
---
For only 1,000 atoms, you can buy a refrigerator to keep your food good indefinitely! Runs on special fusion cores, also purchasable in the atomic shop, for the low low price of 100 caps each!
---
This matters because it opens the door for more P2W BS.
---
There have been MANY posts about it.

And then it goes on if you want to sort through all rage posts about them today, there are plenty more farther back in time.
---
Huh idk why they would try to turn it into a competitive shooter instead of a survival game. Hopefully thats not true but anything is possible with the way this thing has developed.
---
That thing just looks like fun if it did the damage you'd expect from something like that. I want to Van Helsing things!
---
Those military ammo bags also contain ballistic fiber. Are you running any level of White Knight?
---
Challenges are account wide, that's not how it works.
---
I tried it would just wood armour and it felt more in terms of damage. But being a stealth shooter armour isn‚Äôt a high priority. As I‚Äôm just going to die If you get in my face. 
---
I don't have a bloody explosive handmade. I've tried. Lol. My berserkers explosive handmade does the same damage as my furious explosive handmade, except I can't wear any armor with berserkers. It doesn't make any sense.
---
I'd be really sad if bethesda went away and stopped making games. 
---
But it would also not be the worst thing for the industry as a whole if backlash against bullshit like this DID actual harm to a company for once. 
---
Honestly, don't even need a wall.  Just need a Conduit piece that just snaps to walls that has a wire connector on both side.  That way they don't have to create a bunch of new wall models.
---
Survival is a PvP only mode, what did you expect?
---

---
What? The concept of whales is a well-known fact in the industry. A minority of people who completely lack self-control spend huge amounts of money on MTs while most people never touch them. You're asking me to prove that water is wet. 
---
I literally never look for people using markers and I bump into them all the time. Post level 50 everyone goes to the same places to farm. 
---
The way it's described it just that it decreases the ap cost of power attacks.  No mention of unarmed.
---
Of course! My GT is stoicsasquatch . All are welcome at the House of Pebbles.

---
Unlocking a recipe isn't acceptable either. It's pay 2 win no matter what, if you can pay with real money for a direct ingame benefit.
---
Learning a recipe is an ingame benefit.
---
This is a test to see what the playerbase will accept in terms of P2W. It's fucking disgusting that they're even trying it after stating in no uncertain terms that the game will have cosmetic-only microtransactions in the store.
---
I only notice it on fast travel. I don't know if they purposefully activated the "trip time" on fast travel for food spoilage or not, because it doesn't seem to apply to other timers (needs or chem/food effects) like it did in FO4.
---
Well I‚Äôve just been told they are in fact individual kits that cost 20 atoms each so if you could let me know what you find out I‚Äôd appreciate it 
---
Oh yeah man, don't bother unless you got a few 200s or some 100+ with some nice heavy prime weapons - you should know fast if you can do enough damage to beat her.   
---
I've been burned at least 10 times when we didn't do enough damage that I walk away if I see its going bad
---
I support them doing whatever they need to do to keep the game going and more content coming. Sorry.
---
Erlk√∂nig from F. Schubert (on classical radio)
---
Slippery slope always happens in the gaming industry. It's happened already in the industry as a whole. Look at how DLC started off, look at how over time it slowly became what it is today because of apathetic fools like you. Look at Bethesda's own words in their blog about how this is only the first step. It's already happening.
---
Hey I agree with you man
---
Absolutely! :)
---
lol   ahhhh  it all makes much more sense now
---
What platform?
---
Thanks for posting. Sharing the same woes, I'm invested and the findings so far seem inconclusive. It seemed to boil down to a GPU issue affecting Ryzen and Xeon models. Maybe your processor shares the same threading related cause, albeit this is not confirmed.
---
I've yet to see an official statement, bit of a shame that.
---
Yeah I know whales exist, I did a marine biology module in my animal behaviour course. 
---
The request for proof is for the assumption that "most people never touch them". You understand how unlikely that is right? 
---
Nah. ESO has never gone that route. Can't see why this would. Speculation of that sort is just silly.
---
I can see attribute respec kits, I can see stash expansions, sure... but legendary weapons? Meh. Time will tell. I think I'll be right on this one.
---
Lmao just fix the game entirely, it feels grindy as hell, and the servers are not feel so good.
---
In order to get out of that stuck situation you just have to leave the server, or open up your build menu if you can and store whatever you are stuck inside of.
---
I believe if you move the CAMP module around (after you place it to designate your build area you can move it like an item anywhere within your CAMP) to different spots you can change your spawn point. 
---
It works for me, but it still places you at some random locations around the build-able area, but you can play around to get it so you are not spawn falling or materializing inside of something.
---
I'm fairly sure what's in the ATOM shop will be the *plans* to make repair kits, like everything else in the atom shop.
---
Xb1
---
Tell them of it means more quality content then yes! Or please have some better pr! The fanbase of this game is toxic as hell and needs to be handled. 
---
Repair kits sound awesome, buying them in the atomic shop doesn't. If you want my money release the Rider power armor paints that were data mined in patch 5 or 6 that never showed up in the atomic shop. üòí
---
It's not pay to win if you get the atoms in game.
---
What's odd is I had this issue day one of the hotfix, but yesterday it went away for me, absolutely no changes. I'd run scan and repair, I'd double-checked that when I re-installed the game it didn't add a custom ini file, everything I could think of (beyond contacting customer support, because there's only so many times I can be told absolute bullshit before I get sick of it...last issue I had was "It looks like your computer is trying to use the integrated GPU, maybe that's why you don't have a \_fucking head\_ it can't POSSIBLY be because faschnacht was a buggy rushed release). 
---
Keep the Atomic Store cosmetic only. That means no utility items or consumables. CAMP items have no impact on gameplay advantage thus far. Repair kits do. The Atomic Store should have more cosmetic apparel and weapon skins, hairstyles and tattoos, and/or CAMP items, not these repair kits. Keep them out of the store, I'm not spending Atoms on that. All Atoms I get is through gameplay and spent at leisure to either spend now or save up.
---
Putting plans in the shop is not ok. It's still the exact definition of P2W. You can get a new account, pay a bunch of money and get a huge benefit.
---
The only way to make it not pay 2 win is if it's cosmetic only. Full stop.
---
This is a bold post, Cotton.
---
That's because there doesn't seem to be any way to script the grass under to not spawn.
---
The way the grass works is that its a 'texture' attached to that particular type of ground piece.  To remove it would require you to either remove the grass from all those ground pieces - wherever they are laid and all the time - or replace the ground piece with a unique one that is identical in everyway except that it doesn't have the grass texture.
---
Its genuinely an engine limitation as no one has figured out how to do it dynamically with Skyrim or FO4 either.
---
System?
---
&gt;It doesn‚Äôt matter if they say they are ‚Äúplanning‚Äù on doing this
---
Wrong definition of "plan".  I'm talking about the in-game thing that lets you build something.  Not "intended course of action".
---
Currently, when you buy a jacket from the Atom shop, you are unlocking plans to build that jacket.  Not a jacket item.  That jacket, once you build it, is not droppable, tradable or sellable.  You can also build an infinite number of them once you've unlocked the plan.
---
This sounds exactly what they are planning to do with these repair kits - sell a plan in the store.
---
16 Tons is definitely my favorite. It fits very well in the theme of West Virginia 
---
I still disagree, even with that convincing argument lol. I've seen your edit and am very glad you admit there may be more to it. The problem, and history atests to it, is the slippery slope. Once you put something non cosmetic in a pay shop, balance suffers between people who pay rl money for items, and those who don't or only use in game currency. That's just a fact of the modern gaming industry. 
---
*your?
---
Furious is best with fast, lower damage weapons. A high damage/slow firing weapon has about the worst pairing with Furious.

Yeah, but you gotta make a GIANT STATEMENT. Just in case.

Oh my fucking god. You are unbelievable. We're done here. You should really go and educate yourself on the subject, though.

Nah.. his response seemed pretty reasonable to me. You aren't seeing the bigger picture here.

 pay to win = juego para tontos
---
Strength for the running ,and int for the charge length. I don't have mine completely maxed out, but they help a good deal if you are living in your super powered sardine tin like me.
---
well your literally paying to be better at the game than others
---
It sucks that I got pushed back, but I want a good product, so push it back 
---
Yeah I was expecting some big performance gains. There‚Äôs been nothing that‚Äôs really made a big difference for me since launch.
---
That‚Äôs not what they said. They said repair kits were highly requested alongside refrigerators and such. Not anywhere did they say anything else would be p2w. 
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs a physical item or a plan to build the item. If you can‚Äôt get them without getting the plan it‚Äôs pay to win...
---
my boy Tyrant coming in hot with the straight facts
---
Sheikh Abdullah bought skins for everyone who worked for him for Christmas. 
---
Actually you bought the game to play with a community, not bought it so you alone can do whatever you want. Wanna kill "humans" that don't wanna do PvP go kill some raiders. But when you are the direct cause of others leaving the game, this is how mmos begin to die
---
Can someone explain me how repair kits would be pay to win... 
---
I never ever needed repair kits since launch.
---
I mean. Never. At all. 
---
What do I miss here?
---
Besides the 150% one ( which can give weapon bonus) is a drop, not an atom item.
---
We were told that Fasnacht had rare masks. And unless anyone has proof of them I don‚Äôt think anyone got one. 
---
Nothing will suck more than ‚Äúneeding‚Äù these repair kits and doing the burrow for a chance at say a backpack only for it to not even drop at all sans for maybe 200 people?  
---
I meant like new effects to push out the meta we have now. Everyone is getting tired of seeing bloodied this and that. New weapons are always a plus same with armour. New food and aide are good. But make it something that all this hype about it worth the bitching and moaning and happy people are worth it. 
---
How does your BASIC repair kit give you any advantage over your "competition" who has an IMPROVED repair kit that he got in game? 
---
As if repairing a fucking item by any means is any kind of "advantage" anyway.  You kids need to grow up and stop using terms you don't understand.  Explain to me how that repair kit is going to give you any advantage over me when I one shot you with my bloodied golf club?
---
I don't see how a repair pack is pay to win. I've never had issues with repairs. This seems like it's just a bunch of people making a mountain out of a mole hill. Also the better repair packs are dropped for doing SBQ and similar events.
---
Hopefully they release home server code before they finish running this sinking ship into the damn ground. 
---
Add it to the list (it‚Äôs a very long list)
---
You get the atoms for free. The atom store can literally never be pay to win because of that. I get that you want to be mad but this isn't anything to be mad about.
---
Good news is your Camp is located near a random event location (there are dozens on the map).  So you might be able to stumble upon things giving you rare and valuable plans.
---
Yeah same spending actually money always seemed dumb to me
---
This is an excellent question, a berserker weapon for a person with 0 DR or ER should, be the strongest version of that weapon.  Or at least comparable to a bloodied weapon for an individual with extreme low health.
---
I don't go to movies. I don't find value in spending $50 for two of us to eat $0.35 worth of popcorn, $050 of fountain drinks, and a movie I can watch at home in 2 weeks for $5.
---
Yeah, I do judge my entertainment by value for dollar and time spent. Some entertainment, I have a higher threshold for that dollar spent, others, not so much. I paid $10 for "what remains of edith finch", played it twice and my wife played it once... good value. 
---
As for your last paragraph here... "fuck 'em"... ok, so you're done? Not playing anymore?
---
Which colleges run courses on this topic? Or should I just go to kotaku and do a search?
---
Yeah it‚Äôs one of my favorites too. As soon as the chorus comes on, I can‚Äôt help but sing
---
Agreed, my post is telling people to do just that! Keep fighting, why does every post here but yours see me as an boot licking Bethesda fan?
---
Some people like the easy way. 
---
whats better than a lvl 50 all rise?
---
You need to remove damage perk cards also. Also I remember something about the evasive perk needing to be equiped as if Bethesda had it backwards.
---
From my tests when I tried to make it work.you had to be completely naked in order to get any real benefits. Under armor did not count against it but Barbarian and blocker did. Evasive should be the same as Barbarian but for some reason my weapon damage went up only when I equipped it so I assume the programmers goofed and set it backwards.
---
Huh. I‚Äôd heard reports of hacks on PC, consoles are a different story. Maybe what the other poster mentioned about finding your base once, and tracking you via gamer tag, then
---
Stop playing on a potato 
---
Not being single use doesn't make it non-cosmetic. 
---
I like the idea of the repair kits but i won't use atoms for them lol  It be cool if they were implemented ingame rather than the atom shop imo. I'm just happy that the double xp weekend for adventure mode is on the one weekend a month i have off.
---
Well, there is a two in there, I could definitely see the confusion.... :)
---
It was a minor weekly event. The costumes themselves didn't give you actual bonuses. That was ill-advised, but not out-right pay-2-win mechanics.
---
I stopped playing until they finished the game. Looks like I won't be coming back as I just don't do pay2win at any degree! 
---
I don't find an announcement that additional testing of a mechanic that can impede my fun stupid. I'm frustrated by the idea that repair kits, as described, are being described as pay to win. So far, all we know is that for some unknown cap amount (1800? 10? I'm sure everyone "knows") for an item that may be a one use, may be a plan (like everything else in the Atom shop). Sure that contradicts Pete Hines. So what? 
---
I eont wear it always but it'll be  a really good help thanks!
---
Is this sub even moderated??? Why is the front page filled with 40 threads on this?
---
useless fanboi comment
---
Here we go on the path to becoming Black Desert. :(
---
To be fair, in my experience it's a vocal minority that are toxic, they're just very vocal, and very toxic.
---
Lmao...you make pvp sound like some big drawn out event....but it's not so your example is moot.
---
Wouldn't be a Bethesda announcement without backlash.
---
But I get the whole "cosmetic only in the Shop" argument.
---
What the fuck are you talking about? If you can buy in-game power of any kind in a game with competitive play, it's pay 2 win. Full stop.
---
It's completely unacceptable and the fact that the modern gaming audience has gotten so fucked in the head is incredibly disappointing. Bethesda promised they will only have cosmetic microtransactions and are turning around and testing p2w items *4 months* after launch.
---
You're not at all wrong.  I just don't see how 'unlocking' an item would work, if you're not talking about unlocking the plan.
---
When you unlock a hat in the store, you learn how to make it, just like learning a plan.  You unlock the 'plan', then you craft it in game.  It's the default atom shop method.  I'm *assuming* since they said 'unlock', it will be the same thing.  If not, shame on them.
---
As to the mechanics...yeah, not a clue, we'll need more information.  It says 'as long as you have the repair kit in your inventory', which means it's an item (though you use it in the weapon/armor inspect UI).  One time use, so a consumable, which is different than other unlockables I believe.  And if I recall correctly, nothing else in the atom shop gives you an *item*, it's all skins or unlocked plans.
---
This is definitely something different, we'll need the details to be sure of anything.
---
&gt;"Once you‚Äôve got a Repair Kit..." seems to indicate you buy them.
---
If you want to parse that sentence (while ignoring the unlock one), why doesn't it say "buy a Repair Kit"?
---
&gt;If the repair kit did this, it wouldn't be something new.
---
The "something new" is unlocking a non-cosmetic item via Atoms.
---
&gt;Look at how they redefined what a B.E.T.A. test is when the game launched.
---
They didn't.  They were conducting a load test, something you do late in beta.  You thought it was an early beta test because.....well I don't really know why.  The ship date was way too close to think that the beta was an early beta.
---
I mean fair enough, I don't struggle either even without perks. It's just damned annoying seeing things spoil at times under 30 minutes. Last night I went to give a friend some tarberries I picked literally ten minutes ago, and they spoiled while I was trying to drop them. It's just dumb.
---
Speech to text is a bitch ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs legit, i think this is a waste of a post. What are you hoping to accomplish? Your not calling anyone out, your coming here to vent your frustrations and garner sympathy. You deserve none. Fallout is a harsh universe and an M rated game. If you can‚Äôt even handle having a base destroyed then your daughter certainly has no business playing the game. Next time keep up with the patch notes and don‚Äôt be mad at people for acting like dicks online, that‚Äôs something that will never change and your only wasting your time coming here and being angry about it. Call me an ass hole, but if I knew you personally I‚Äôd tell you the same exact thing.
---
Call me a banana but I'm not seeing those repair kits in the store. Where are they?
---
Also they're going to be the plans to make repair kits, not the actual items.
---
Just trying to see if anyone has one they will trade me.
---
Game works perfectly on ps4. Then again, ps4 isn‚Äôt a potato. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I‚Äôm alright spending some money on it if it‚Äôs a limited item like the black power armor paint even getting the daily and weekly atoms arnt that hard and pile up over time but if its something like this where all it does is save me a few mats that would take maybe 5 minutes to farm then there‚Äôs really no use to buy them, even if they were In game I probably wouldn‚Äôt go out searching for them.
---
5$ for watching a movie? That's like 2.50$ hour. Why not just play minesweeper. its free and has endless  repeatable content.
---
..and yes, If they continue to add Pay2Win items I'll be forced to stop playing the game that I love. I won't support anymore of Zenimax's corporate influence over BGS.
---
So.. hold up. 
---
What exactly are you here telling people to do, then if not "Don't buy it"?
---
Lay it on me.
---
"na√Øve fool" says the early 20s little shit (maybe older, but I doubt it) that thinks business owes him fuckin anything, and that his pissing into the wind online amounts to something of value. THIS? This is a pissing match between people with nothing better to do... that's it. Pot calling the kettle black, here, boy.
---
Cranberry relish plus crabberry drink for even moreeeee!
---
Because someone could drop enough cash in the shop to never run out while others run out and grind.
---
The only games with micro transactions that actually get my cash are free to play games, and only when there's no block to actually playing the game while NOT paying cash. Neverwinter got a decent chunk of money from me,  because baring legendary mounts everything I NEEDED could be gotten as a drop.   
---
Bethesda's not doing the right thing here, or in blades, and they won't get a cent from me  for either title as it stands now. 
---
We will always fight for fairness of promises in video games. I'm not going to change tune, not until I see how it would be implemented visually, and not after that either most likely. They'll take this feedback seriously if they want the game to do well as recent.
---
True Todd's nuts taste great. Sluuuuuurp
---
I think the title is a little misleading. You can still earn them in game via challenges. And the stronger repair kits will only be earned in game. 
---
Pay to win.
---
I know. I hate subreddits. I hate looking at these. But every now and again, you see a gem in the barrons of hell. 
---
Exactly why people are concerned.  Worst case scenario this is what it sounds like on the post and is an item you buy for atoms that goes into your inventory to use when you need.  
---
Every other scenario isn't much better.  
---
I believe others, like myself,  are frustrated at what this could be and want voices heard BEFORE it becomes a problem.  
---
They are adding tonnes of new content, and it looks pretty good. But this thing was a huge misstep, IMO.
---
If they bought those items with real world money, then yes, I agree with you. However, if they bought them with in-game currency, using legit farming/crafting methods then no, you're wrong.
---
Can someone honestly tell me how the game is right now on Xbox? I have the Xbox One S, and performance and general framerate issues at launch were atrocious.
---
Todd is a liar!!!
---
If I'm not in melee, the standard combat rifle using 45 cal makes short work of mole miners, and I'm really liking the executioners combat rifle (also 45 cal)....
---
And in that quote it doesn‚Äôt say that other utility items WILL be in the atom shop. But know what? Either way idc. I‚Äôll buy atoms to get them if it happens just to support them. 
---
Wait, you mean that rocket launchers AREN'T mining tools? There goes my new mining strategy. 
---
I dumped the whole game till its properly tuned. Just not yet it seems.
---
It says repair kits are unlockable through the atom shop. That to me, reads that after you unlock it, you can make them yourself, which is how literally every other physical atom shop item works so far.
---
As long as they don't put an extreme amount of atoms to it, I personally don't see an issue. If they make it 400 or 500 atoms, you can make that in a few days by completing the challenges. 
---
However, it is a COMPLETELY different story if they put them at a high amount. 
---
And to reiterate, it says unlockable. Not attainable, not bought, unlockable. Stop assuming the worst because you don't know how to read.
---
Wait what?
---
/r/fallout76filthycasuals
---
It‚Äôll arrive when it arrives. Or maybe later depending on when they get around to it lol.
---
While I am the first to speak out against griefing, what they did to you was just be an asshole not griefing.  Its a PvP specific mode, what did you expect would happen? 
---
Shit.
---
Oh right..because benches aren't scattered ALL OVER THE WASTLAND lol....
---
I‚Äôm with you man, there‚Äôs no argument from me on this. 
---
Except that the better version is a free drop only. I really don't understand how this is such an issue especially when atoms themselves are also free unless you optionally WANT to pay for more
---
Ohhh ok my bad :)
---
Naaah. Zero atom cost, because this is a functional item, not a cosmetic one. Flat out, there's no debate to be had here, this is bethesda going back on their word and it's not acceptable at any price.   
---
Your suggestion actually makes this system MORE pay to win. 
---
Up at the space station there is a cliff on the right side. I've built a few camps up there. Not a massive amount of space but it will do. 
---
I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre trying to turn it into a competitive shooter, just saying the plan is to have a seasonal reset in survival mode specially.
---
You‚Äôre a banana!  (But just cause you told us to üçåüòÅ)
---
I'm guessing you stopped reading before my edit where I stated my take on what it means is outdated and I'm willing to admit I may be wrong as to how the term has evolved.
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm pro p2w, nor do I see how the repair kits are pay to win when you get atoms for free from the game, it‚Äôs like saying camo paint jobs are giving an advantage in game by blending into the environment 
---
The only thing I like about people putting money into atoms are the fact it brings more money to Bethesda to provide the services such as free dlc, the more money they have the bigger and better dlc can be 
---
/r/Fallout76FilthyCasuals
---
Sorry, that was supposed to be phrased a question. 
---
You can‚Äôt craft repair kits in eso so why would they do it in 76
---
They‚Äôre supposed to have spikes which cause damage, but I didn‚Äôt add them due to prop policy. I don‚Äôt want my weapon confiscated for poking an eye out.
---
Depends on the price. 20-100 Ap: I wouldn't fuss because literally anyone could get it by completing a challenge or two, but it would still be them going back on their word and introducing microtransactions beyond cosmetics; it wouldn't be worth the trouble, basically.
---
Yea, someone else said that in an earlier comment. I know about the fountain, but I'm in watoga, and too over encumbered to fast travel 
---
Are you fucking d a f t ?
---
How do you think Fortnite made its billions?
---
Have you ever played the game to see how it's paywall locked?
---
This isn't a 1 for 1 comparison but going beyond that look at fucking ESO ONLINE. They do the same thing except their content is level normalized so it's not as abrasive. 
---
Look at Runescape. 
---
Look at literally any foreign market online game. 
---
There's plenty of precedent. I mean they already straight-up lied and said the Atom Shop would be cosmetic only and now this. 
---
I mean you can get improved ones through playing, so there's that.
---
Perhaps you'd like to buy some from the new and improved Atom shop then?
---
Yongyea is that you????
---
It‚Äôs not about the money it‚Äôs the principle for me. I think many of us are of the same idea
---
Oh, I'd love them to fix it.  I like to use 'high grass' mods in FO4 and run into this problem all the time there.
---
But actual talented and driven people have been going at this problem for half a decade now and they haven't figured it out - I don't have hope BethesdaAustin will.  And not because they aren't smart enough - I just think they have a similar outlook as BGS (if it ain't too broke, don't fix it).  I mean, it took BGS finding out a modder fixed the 'raining through overhead' thing in Skyrim and the earlier games before they got around to implementing it in FO4.
---
Hell yes. One of my most memorable moments is launching a nuke while Ride of the Valkyries was playing.
---
The joke is funny. I'm always in support of moving things out until they work correctly.

Imagine if you didn't have to fucking spend atoms to get the things you need to play the game, but only on the things that are optional?
---
WHAT A WORLD ‚ú®
---
When I first started playing, met a higher leveled player and he gave me some stuff out of nowhere. Fast forward a couple of levels and met this one guy who was giving me way more than I needed and I asked him why. He told me he wished he had help starting out. 
---
I‚Äôm lvl 40 now and ever since then I‚Äôve been doing the same for lower leveled players so they can pass that on the same way those other guys did :)
---
That's me before caffeine for sure. I also swing missile launchers around at anyone who doesn't proffer a lot of caffeine in the morning.  
---
Buy a VIP Response ticket from the Atom store, guaranteed response with 2hours, only 200 Atoms! 
---
I agree it‚Äôs a bad look if the game doesn‚Äôt have a history of screwing up, but we‚Äôre talking about 76 here. 
---
Use the we don‚Äôt know yet, it‚Äôs just beta, it will get fixed soon excuse all you want. I‚Äôm with op on this one.
---
Who even needs one there are benches everywhere. Even a weapons bench where you fight the queen 
---
Go to a bench to repair. Play the game to earn them. ITS FUCKING MAGIC! ü•≥
---
You get atoms from plying the game too, doesn‚Äôt mean you get a lot of them or enough to buy anything after playing a while in the late game. We may only get one a week or two. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs worth it when you run down condition of a weapon in one play session. 
---
We're all missing something, because that something is hidden behind invisible modifiers that reduce damage outside of just DR, like a flat % damage reduction.
---
This aspect needs some work.
---
On the bright side now you have plenty of atoms to spend on repair kits (heh)
---
Bethesda are dirty fucking liars. They promised the atom shop would be cosmetic only and now look. Fuck this company so glad I never bought this garbage. 
---
Silly you! The player vending was just delayed because the vending bots didnt like it hahaha xDDDDDDD get it xDD beccause the bots didn't like that players couild vend and now they have competittion xddDDDD

Basically just the "update" version of this quote:

Not all of us!  Some of us are just enjoying the PVP experience.  When I started this game I hated PVP soooooo much.  Now I really love it.  Learning how to use my weapons better,  learning how Sentinel Armor works (which the set I have is just a scattered one not a crazy one).  You just get unlucky with the griefing and modding/exploiting idiots in a server once in a while.  Otherwise there are areas you can stick to where you won‚Äôt run into people too much. 
---
As much as I‚Äôd prefer you not steal my spot, there‚Äôs a nice area near the mothman town (can‚Äôt remember it‚Äôs name, point pleasant?) underneath a power pylon with a junkpile too, the pylon is supported by a concrete foundation that sticks out of the ground on one side, and a cliff overlooking it on the other, there‚Äôs also a beehive on that cliff, it‚Äôs a nice flat spot, you can also place a foundation down and two stair cases down and you can build up inside the pylon like I did, Ive had someone track me down and ask how I did it 
---
Logged in to survival for the first time, as soon as I loaded in I got shot once and died instantly (Im level 104 with full legendary gear etc)  not bothered since lol.
---
Actually Gw2 hosts almost their entire infrastructure on AWS now so its not far off.  
---
With Gw2 you can buy Gems with irl currency or ingame currency. it is also another B2P MMO without a subscription that is over six years old so lessons can be learnt from it.
---
I don't completely mind a P2Excell system where a few helpful items can be purchased without grinding. In the case of fo76, getting early access to crafting benches, generators or purifiers wouldn't bother me at all. Maybe even being able to purchase an EXP buff or something of that nature. However, saying that you could purchase a AAE RW Handmade for $9.99 or paying $5 for a mod to add explosive to your weapon is totally out of the question in my opinion.
---
P2W in the strictest of terms bothers me as it creates a classist economic divide within the game and community. Only those willing to empty, or at least dent their bank accounts can really stand on their own at the top.
---
Being able to gift atoms would be really nice. I personally don't mind modest investments in games I've already paid for, but many people won't or cant. That being said, if you really wanted to, you could buy gift cards or prepaid visas and share the codes.
---
imo mandatory:
---
9x Rifleman
---
3x Tank Killer
---
The other 3 slots open:
---
3x Glow Sight, for nuked Whitesprings or similar.
---
3x Picklock for compulsive farmers.
---
3x Concentrated Fire for awful players, uncapable to aim.
---
1x Green Thumb is needed to farm nuked flora.
---
I don't see the issue if the items can also be earned in game. None of the new stuff coming is even p2w, its just convenient. 
---
#votewithyourwallet
---
People are angry?
---
Good job on assuming my age and getting it wrong. Not sure what the hell that was about.
---
Anyway, I'm suggesting people SPEAK UP. Tell them we do not want this and that this idea can fuck right off to the depths of Oblivion.
---
"Pissing in the wind" Got rid of Online passes. It got rid of the original vision of the Xbox One, It fixed Battlefront (kind of), It got Bethesda to send out the collector's bags that they advertised, and more. Being vocal works. Being an apathetic corporate bootlicker solves nothing.
---
is that in luck?
---
Read into it however you want.   It doesn't say plan though.   I understand how the rest of the shop works and why people would think it was a plan,  that was my first thought when I read it.
---
But, damn,  if it IS a plan...  it could create all kinds of problems.  Imagine if the item costs like a bunch of plastic, screws, wood, springs to build.  All of a sudden it makes repairing high end gear trivial.   What if it costs a bunch of ballistic fiber and other stuff,  now why use it on  low level item at all?
---
And is that put down at the end REALLY necessary?  I'm reading the post EXACTLY as it is.   Nice.
---
Dude, just stop. Nobody gives a shit. If you're still playing, you're making a mistake. Their game is dead, and they need to recuperate as much money as possible, and they'll do it by sucking the hardcore players dry.
---
save you atoms ;) 
---
you don't have to pay anything
---
Valid point. Perhaps if they took it out of the Atom store and added the Basic as  drop from Belly of the Beast or something?
---
Those folks are the opposite side of the spectrum. They are toxic for the game as well. 
---
I understand that with melee and position myself so I am not hitting them. I run heavy guns and regularly have people walk in front of me with my explosive 50 cal is just spraying them and the don't move. Not like that is something you wouldn't notice.
---
ive always had good with salt..i never had this issue..the perk only works with food your carrying..not what is in your stash box
---
Wrong, I've paused playing until some more content comes out. If they add play to win bullshit there's at least me that will 100% stop playing. It's not nearly enough of the fallout that I enjoyed to keep supporting them doing stupid bullshit like this.
---
Silver linings and all that...
---
Lol i killed her less than 10 times in 600 hours.
---
Its my time to waste.  As it is yours to waste berating me for it.
---
Ah,  The ol'  but you don't have to defense.   Love it.  
---
Wait what? Only criticism about repair kits is allowed today üòÇ
---
The game sold over 200.000 units last year in the UK and it was released in November making to the top 20 best selling games in 2018 and this is only for the physical edition so no too bad.
---
I'd consider a lot of mobile games p2w but they dribble out premium currency so you can buy things with it without spending money, however you'll never keep up with a paying player as a f2p. This isn't that bad yet, but it opens up the possibility for this to happen in 76. 
---
I assumed everything is connected. From the obelisks in Fallout 3 and the occult stuff in Point Lookout, to the giant colossus at the bottom of Dunwich Borers underwater.  In fact, that colossus (it's technically just a reused statue decoration) face seems to be the same one you can find in 76 in several places.
---
Seriously, this is the kind of thing I am happy to see.
---
"Hey by the way, this isn't ready, so we're pushing it back. We're now aiming for X date."
---
Sure it's a bummer it got pushed back, but I'm glad to see they're both trying to make sure things are READY to be released, as well as informing us about the changes.
---
You wrote ‚Äúcome stic‚Äù
---
Can I get a tick blood tequila sunrise and a deathclaw steak. Oh and a front row seat to people overreacting, thanks good sir. Now take my caps
---
But they didn't say in the ItV that regular kits would be rewards from challenges. 
---
"Basic Repair Kits will be unlockable in the Atomic Shop using Atoms you‚Äôve purchased or those you‚Äôve earned for free by completing in-game challenges."
---
They're talking about atoms in that second part.
---
I‚Äôm very disappointed about this too, probably been delayed until they can figure out how to make people pay for them lol
---
I though ESO is like $20 USD for just the base game without expansions.
---
There were also interviews where they said cosmetics "and other things" but people only hear what they want to hear.
---
.50 Cal doesn't have spinup time =). It's higher damage per shot than the handmade after the latest patch, higher fire rate, with a magazine 20x bigger.
---
If I were to go full pvp I'd probably drop bloodied and just use my TSE .50 cal. AAE .50 Cal would be better, but TSE is what I have.
---
In PvE, Bloodied isn't risky at all. Far from it. I can take 3-4 melee hits from ghouls, mutants, etc., before going down. I can take at least 1 melee hit from the SBQ as well, which is more than enough time to use a stim and back off. Standing next to exploding cards and robots - not a problem. Even against those level 52 Major Gutsies, I take maybe 1-2% HP loss per shot. The trade off of running bloody is that my damage goes from the 100-200 per shot range into the 600+ per shot range. Nothing survives long enough to hurt me. If I DO die on SBQ - great, someone will revive me, revenant activates, and suddenly the queen is losing ridiculous amounts of health per second.
---
Even on survival, death isn't the worst thing in the world. More of an inconvenience really. Having to stash everything is more inconvenient, but dying and losing ~5-10 aid items? Not a big deal when I have hundreds stashed / muled. I've farmed nuked whitesprings in survival. very few came surprisingly, despite the fact that I was running around out of stealth, doing laps of whitesprings and clearing glowing ghouls. 
---
As it stand right now, there's no incentive to do survival, except for that temporary 200% exp buff. I'll be there this weekend for that. I guess we'll see if anyone ventures into the nuke zone. In my experience PvPers don't bother, although I can't see why not - rad shield should be enough to keep them healthy alone.
---
Holy shit. A reasoned answer on Reddit. Someone call in the down votes. /s (I up voted you brother. Don't the mob get you down.) All right, back to the screeching masses. 
---
I wouldn't use "mad" to describe how this makes me feel.  "Let down" or "disappointed" would be more appropriate.  Maybe even sad. Because they're going back on their word to keep the atom store cosmetic.  And because they can't seem to stop shooting themselves in the foot.   It's fine, I'm still going to play the game, I'm just not going to reward Bethesda by supporting these kind of actions.
---
Ok and? If you earn the atoms used to buy them, that means you didnt pay therefore not p2w. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

‚ÄúYou silly sod you got us all worked up, what‚Äôs he going to do nibble me bum? One rabbit stew coming up...........,.,......Geeezus Christ! Run away run away RUN AWAYYYYY‚Äù

https://help.bethesda.net/
---
See, there's that internet forum logic, and attempting to change the direction of a conversation.
---
You take care.
---
Repair kits that can repair items, not having to use junk to repair. You can get them in game or buy them in the atom store. 
---
It's been free to play several times, I know that much.
---
;)  corrected
---
At least 6, I doubt they really care though. They took the ideas from the good people here and turned it into a cash grab.
---
That's not how I roll..... I'm bringing shocks back....
---
You still have like zero fucking perspective. Like zero. What are you fucking fifteen?
---
Its my agenda to push if I want to.  Feel free to downvote and get back to griefing.
---
It is disappointing. Many people are looking forward to player vending and how it will work.
---
Ah hell no!
---
Everyone except the YouTubers who will harp on it for at least a month after everyone else stopped caring.
---
Speaking of promises.... it‚Äôs fuckin April now,  where the hell is my canvas bag?
---
Well I'm not lvl 90-100 or have a mic BUT I can handle myself pretty well, I just need some fusion cores because I'm mega overencumbered and out of stash space
---
I suspect the griefers living out their murder fantasies are less emotionally stable to be honest.
---
Until you want to milk a Brahmin or visit the traveling vendorbot and his minions. For some reason those two will register being attacked when you have plague walker, even if you don‚Äôt currently have any diseases and you‚Äôre doing zero damage. 
---
I ended up getting rid of the mutation just because I wanted some stuff from the vendorbot. 
---
I personally think they should just get ride of explosive effect s on guns
---
Unless the things are like, 5 atoms or so, I dont think anyone's gonna buy into it. Also, why are people saying its pay to win? Who goes into a PvP fight or even a PvE fight with their weapons nearly broken?
---
You know what else got stealthily nerfed recently?  How fast food spoils.  Funny how they mentioned refrigeration in the same paragraph they announced the repair kits.  It's a bad sign of things to come.
---
So you are a fish and bit on the XP hook to provide a target for people who are paying bethesda to shoot other players online.
---
Not to protect children, to let the rest of us play without being held hostage to griefers.  
---
Well at least not death threat over the player vending üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Because it goes against their promise of only having cosmetics in the Atom shop; it is a useful item and the better version is rare, based on what they said in the dev diary. Further, it is a microtransaction, and I'm against those in principal.
---
These are my main issues, but there are others that people have brought up.
---
Remember to travel by regular server when you can. Place your camp where you want to play and jump back to the Survival to actually play. 
---
I was killed 5 times making my way to Flatwoods and i had to respawn at Vault 76 each time. I didn‚Äôt have money or aid items to lose but I lost so much time to it that the extra xp was useless. 
---
Also, when I unlocked Charleston station to fast travel and respawn to, it was deadly there. Spawn camping. So better to respawn at your discreet camp, switch to regular server to fast travel and then switch back, away from the station. 
---
Finally don‚Äôt use an unsilenced weapon or wear power armor. The noise will attract PvPers to your location and you‚Äôll be dead before you realize they are there. Stick to melee and silenced weapons. Also, monsters that shoot at you will draw attention to your location too.
---
The could be saying unlockable as a marketing tactics to convince players that it isn't P2W.
---
Couldnt it be a possibility that theyre adding these items to the game and then skins for them in atom shop?
---
Any time you can pay real world money to increase your power in a game, it's pay to win.  Repairing items increases their DMG/DR thus granting you more power.  
---
It's not edging on pay to win, it IS pay to win plain and simple.  Players that buy repair kits for atoms have an advantage over those that don't, end of conversation.    
---
They need to revert this decision and make the repair kits craftable items.  It's fine for them to also be ingame rewards for dailies/quests etc. but it's not cool to sell these for atoms.  
---
This is a greedy, slippery slope.
---
Get an upvote. I'm more interested in this than player vending.
---
I'm keeping too much weight in junk and magazines i would like to display and cannot play survival  for this reason.
---
Fuck em. I don‚Äôt watch 76 gamers
---
No, Fallout 76 is a good game because I find it fun, and have enjoyed the hell out of it. And what's the point of a game if not "fun"?
---
It's "good value" because I've gotten a hell of a lot of  hours out of for price paid.
---
Shame you can't understand the difference. Now, please... tell me more about what I am saying.
---
I'm amused, but anyone with robotics expert can easily sway the vendors. Am I right?
---
That‚Äôs exactly why there‚Äôs a regular adventure mode if you don‚Äôt want to be killed. 
---
You're not alone my dude, people are overreacting on this
---
Guaranteed the OP didn‚Äôt watch your video but jumped to criticize you ASAP. Your content is great just keep doing what you‚Äôre doing man
---
Rofl ü§£ü§£
---
Thank you for the sage advice. 
---
Yes, rank 3 gives you a 30% chance for double. I have built up my flux stash pretty well this way. I don't think it is working right because if you spam the craft button it doesn't trigger as often. I just take it slow. 
---
I loved the idea of the wiffle bat.   Sadly it wasn‚Äôt really what I was expecting.   It‚Äôs less unique cosmetic and sound more pointless skin.
---
They've announced plans for a Repair Kit item, which will fully repair equipment without the need for stopping at a crafting station. So far it appears that this item will only be available through the Atomic Shop.
---
People are upset because this contradicts an often repeated insistence that items in the Atomic Shop will only be cosmetic, which obviously is not the case for Repair Kits. 
---
Repairing isn't a competitive advantage tho. 
---
Everyone carries backups weapons.
---
It just allows some to skip the grind for rare repair mats like flux or ultracite.
---
There's one near Arktos Pharma that looks out over the Landview Lighthouse.
---
‚ÄúOr other things LIKE THAT‚Äù (if that‚Äôs the correct quote) 
---
People really only do hear what they want to hear..
---
Pay to repair armor? Glad i saved my money for something else
---
What? No! Read today's Inside the Vault.
---
I see you hit the bethesdareplied bot to see if they‚Äôd said anything as well. 
---
Damn mine is at 21lbs with a scope
---
Probably a major issue with player vending.  I was imagining a nightmare scenario where players could buy everything in your inventory / stash the other day.  Maybe they found something on that level?
---
*Fallout 76 will be multiplayer.*
---
Ok, that sucks but I'll try it.
---
*Numerous bugs*
---
Ok, I may want to go back to Skyrim.
---
*Advantages to players buying Unstoppables items on Atomic store*
---
Yeah, definitely better to go to Skyrim.
---
*Item advantage to players with atoms*
---
Fuck this shit.
---
*Skyrim and Fallout mod store still down with bugs*
---
Of course.
---
Shit. Thought you said gatling. That's a bit harder. 
---
Probably have to jump to the side and hope I can get the first shot. Mellee is pretty well useless at more than maybe 2 steps. 
---
Honestly, the only real reason I do survival at all is for the legendary rewards. I do like the added feel of danger though. I miss Fallout 4 survival where a pipe pistol or Mollie could slaughter you. 
---
Honestly.   Tempest in a tea cup to me.
---
Repairs are pretty easy.
---
Unless they change it.  Hence, the tinfoil hat conspiracy post.
---
Ya man they pissed off ppl in many ways today üòí you would think they should know better by now lol 
---
I‚Äôm going to close bidding at 6pm EST. So if you want this get your bids in before then.  
---
Ok so just pop the repair kits you find ingame instead. 
---
This would be a major dealbreaker for what I was hoping would be my favorite game for a long time. 
---
I‚Äôve spent money in the Atom Shop and I‚Äôll continue to as long as it‚Äôs purely cosmetics. 
---
If non-cosmetics are introduced they won‚Äôt get any money from me, and if I see it affect gameplay I‚Äôll move on to another game. 
---
Maybe it‚Äôs just me but that seems a little high priced, is that standard pricing for PA mods? 
---
It is.  It will depend on how it's implemented, but I'm near 100% sure it will be less of an impact than the *horrible* costume debacle that ~~proved to be the games undoing~~ didn't change anything.
---
Thinking about it, they said it would be unlocked in the atomic shop.  While I don't necessarily believe this...did they say it would cost anything?  They give away stuff all the time there.
---
But spending time worrying about what _could_ happen is a waste of time. I understand people aren't trying to fear monger, but being mad about something that hasn't happened is silly.
---
/u/TeamKillTyrant this is what I mean, if you dont put it in right then anything attached to it will be crooked relative to teh wall.  
---
In my house I originally had the through teh wall conduits opposite each other but I eventually scrapped them as I couldnt get them to be actually opposite each other.
---
However controversial the implementation of repair kits could be, they wouldn‚Äôt offer a *competitive* advantage, weapon condition doesn‚Äôt determine damage output/resistance.  
---
Let's talk facts: we will get mediocre kits that we will be able to earn ingame and trash kits that we will be able to buy with atoms (that we can earn for free too). The rest is just speculation. You do have a point about them testing the waters tho. It's probably best to voice our concerns before they decide that they can get away with anything. Still no reason to call it P2W right now like some people do here. That's just overreaction in my opinion. Juding by cash shops in ESO and Shelter i don't think we have reasons to believe that that it will go anywhere beyond selling consumables. As a matter of fact i would be more worried about them adding some sort of loot boxes filled with unique cosmetics, cosmetics that were removerd from the store and consumables. I can totally see that happening in a year or so.
---
Holy crap lol you could be right üòñ yikes..
---
What a stupid decision Bethesda... it‚Äôs so easy to repair your stuff already- and scavenging for supplies is part of the fun of the game! Not to mention how easy it already is to dump your stuff in a stash, there‚Äôs stash boxes everywhere! Train stations, Red Rockets, other player CAMPs... geez how lazy do they want us to be?!
---
Try voting for the reason that most closely resembles the reason your would rather they be in game.
---
Well, again, the entire post is a bit ambiguous, and probably purposely so. So the point of all the complaining is to give as much feedback before it launches as we can. That will accomplish one of two things: get them to release a clarifying statement, or get them to change course.
---
Regarding beta, when it was announced in June that there would be a beta, it was assumed it would be like what everyone has come to know and expect for a beta: a several months of testing. We got, instead, a few weeks of 'testing' that didn't result in much, if hardly any, fixes to the game before release. Same with the beta being free. Oh, right, you have to buy the game pre-release to get the 'free' beta. It's things like that that make me concerned. And you're right, we did assume, but it was based on past experiences and conventions.
---
I honestly hope we are all wrong about this, but I feel it's better to make some noise and be wrong, than to be silent and be right.
---
It should all be ingame, like in every other Fallout game it was featured in.
---
Let me rephrase, this is nothing to be upset or let down over.
---
I'm actually about 200 caps per leg under the general market price 
---
Fed up of game developers constantly lying, there should be laws that keep game companies from doing shady shit like this.
---
Hate to say, but I would pay for this. Leveling my alt is not as much fun and my time is limited. But I understand how that is a form of pay to win. 
---
He said adding repair kits will break the game.  That covers in game.
---
Yeah that sucks.
---
What do you guys expect from a game that has been shit on so hard there are stores that have tons of unsold copies? I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised that Bethesda realizes that any players that do remain are so invested in it that the players wouldn‚Äôt think twice about buying QOL improvements.
---
No the menu system is horrid because of consoles.
---
...Atom amount, not caps. And given the fact that Pete Hines is VP and in charge of public relations, his word not being good is a very fucking bad thing. "so what"? 
---
Meh. Honestly, this doesnt bother me much. I wouldn't necessarily consider this a P2W move either. I mean really, how much advantage does a repair kit REALLY offer over say another player who opted not to purchase one. Tbh, id consider this more of an extra perk than anything.
---
Now, having said that - if they were to start offering unique high power weapons, weapon upgrades (affects weapon stats), armor enhancements (affecting stats/in combabt enhancements) etc, then yes, that's would absolutely not be cool, in any way. 
---
As it stands, a repair kit REALLY isnt going to be a game changer. Not going to cause some guy to go on a rampage due to his 10 repair kits in inventory! 
---
"OH NO, WATCH OUT, THAT GUYS GOT 10 REPAIR KITS HE PURCHASED IN THE ATOM SHOP. P2W!!" - Said no one, ever, (robably). 
---
Money guys probably won't double back at this point. Game probably isn't doing well, so they're probably trying to squeeze out more money from the people left playing.
---
This is for sure the most likely scenario for the delay.
---
At the rate that FO67 showers you with atoms, this is not comparable to a mobile game that is designed to get you addicted then suck the money from your wallet.
---
It's crazy how they just nerfed the speed food spoils right before they say they might add refrigerators.  Just like they nerfed the repair related perks right before releasing repair kits to the atom shop.  Such a weird coincidence 
---
Armor condition does change the damage resistance though.
---
I love the game, and when I was in filthy and mentioned i was level 100, I got shunned because I must be one of those farmers who isnt level 15 with 200 hours behind me. 
---
Main fo and fo76 is full of haters, people who think the refund meme is funny, people who are still upset about the Bobby pin thing. Get mad over the littlenstuff.
---
Filthy is full of people who thought the beta was perfect, and no change is needed. The game was perfect.
---
I like to play devils advocate, and try to find a good balance. Dont pull out your tiki torches and pitch forks until we see how things work. If it is full on pay to win mechanic, scrap it. Actually at this point, any other title I would have put away by now. I've gotten my monies worth and some.
---
ohh those actualy stack? i always used cobbler because i didnt think theyd all stack.
---
I‚Äôd settle for a nice cosmetic wall.... I‚Äôm supposed to believe I can craft all these fancy floors, but what? Can‚Äôt properly build a wall? Can‚Äôt manage to find wallpaper? 
---
That‚Äôs pretty sad tbh 
---
&gt; if they bought them with in-game currency, using legit farming/crafting methods then no, you're wrong.
---
This is basically the same thing as the repair kits , though.  With the armor/weapons--which is much more game changing than a repair kit--people could purchase them using real world money on ebay or purchase them with caps they legitimately earned.  Repair kit is the same.  You can buy with cash...or you can buy with the other in-game currency that you legitimately earn...atoms.
---
7k 
---
you mean the people that tried charging for skyrim mods?  who cares?  I want this game to get developed, not die.
---
In my opinion they could just add them to the world loot pool and that be that. Have them drop as loot from aid containers, place them randomly in the world, add them to the ammo vending machines (on a flip side the ammo cost at vendors needs drastically cut and the quantity incredibly increased)
---
Which is a terrible way to do it because you can't trade the currency either. If you want to milk money out of players do it to the rich and let regular players trade for it from them like warframe.
---
What‚Äôs even worse is, Bethesda are smart people, they know what they are doing and don‚Äôt care. Every time they try to pull some shenanigans, they make all the haters right. 
---
It is all ingame. You can earn atoms by playing. 
---
The link is that I always seem to be waiting for other players to fix their stuff before we can move on and actually 'do' something. It turns into a half-hour of "I don't have enough of X".  
---
The only way this particular item becomes Pay to Win is if it means getting into more Dungeons faster. I'm not sure we have enough information to make this call yet.
---
I agree wholeheartedly that Pay to Win items have no place in the Shop, however the Devil's Advocate in me can see the value of such an item for a Casual Player that wants to join their more prepared friends for an hour long dungeon crawl once a week.
---
they are already trickling back and it's the worst ones. The ones that kill everyone because they are mad they can't hang in Survival so they take it out on everyone else thinking they are proving something to themselfs. 
---
If the story being told made any sense I would believe it.  It doesn't, and he kept trying to make it Male sense by providing new, different information that contradicted other things he said. 
---
Upvote because you literally made me laugh out loud. Well played :)
---
Ok how about this. You're in survival mode and chase this 250 lvl guy to get some caps but he ran the corner and hid somewhere for a second, repair his armor and comes back out killing you. That's the sort of stuff that you cant normally just do, you have to pay to win in that way. Doesnt matter if you get a little sliver of free atoms to buy it, point is the person with the bigger wallet could hypothetically always win. 
---
"They're literally raping me right now."
---
Not funny. Not okay. Don't be that guy.
---
Also, just FYI, cuckholding is something done to a man when someone else (generally but not always another man) has sex with his wife. So, if you're 'cucking' a man, you're having sex with their wife. See where I'm going with this? 
---
Finally, if you are so insecure to feel the need to use a juvenile insult of a stranger's masculinity as your handle, then I would really think long and hard about therapy. If you're young enough to misuse the term cuckholding so blatantly, then you might want to get your parents to schedule your appointment.

Thought that same thing too. This is getting bad

---
When I'm doing SBQ and fully charged up - all those scorched adds that spawn - the hermit crab, the 95 deathclaws, the mirelurk queens and kings, megasloths etc. - they evaporate. I am talking, as soon as I'm aiming at them, they're dead. Same goes for 80 scorchbeasts. They never get into the air if I spot them coming out of a fissure. 9,000 dps will do that. 
---
I have a few bloodied sniper weapons. Bloodied Gauss rifle, handmade, etc. I could go that route. It would be woefully inefficient in pve though. I'd take 3-4x longer to do anything, and SBQ would be a real chore. ANd for what? PvP kills don't get me anything. I have more aid than I can ever use, caps are worthless on PC. If I'm going out with a fully optimized PvP character, it would be purely to stalk others in pvp, and what is the incentive to do that, besides ruining someones day?
---
&gt; How do you think Fortnite made its billions?
---
By selling shit you dont need to buy, I answered that already
---
&gt; Have you ever played the game
---
Yes, I dont like it, but for other reasons
---
&gt; to see how it's paywall locked
---
Yeah, you have to play a free to play game a bit more than you would have to if you didnt buy some stuff, boo-hoo. Also, they arent comparable, at all.
---
&gt; Look at Runescape.
---
&gt; Look at literally any foreign market online game
---
Lol, yeah, look at all these free to play games using microtransactions, literally one of the only ways they can, to make money
---
&gt; There's plenty of precedent.
---
Show me this proof you have that the game will be locked behind a paywall some how, actually you cant because you dont have any proof. Tell me how you think the game will be locked behind a paywall, because at this point were only talking about an item that will save you a few minutes of play time. Do you think theyre going to introduce an instakill gatling laser that uses no ammo, gives you an xp boost of 200%, adds 1000 strength and gives you a blowjob or something?
---
Again, I ask, would you rather pay $120 at retail for a new game, or have microtransactions? You cant have both, games cost money to make and barely make money, if you arent about the former then you are part of the reason why we have the latter and if youre so upset about it then maybe you could talk to your guidance counselor during lunch tomorrow kiddo
---
1. Bethesda says Atom shop will be cosmetic only and won't offer any gameplay advantages.
---
2. Bethesda reveals on roadmap that a convenience item will be available on the Atom shop.
---
3. You have now been lied to.
---
4. You defend this action because you don't care about the repair kits, when you should care because of the principle of the matter.
---
By saying that you don't think I understand what p2w tells me that you actually do not know what it means. Pay to win very literally means that you pay real money to get things you can not get in any other way. Pay to level faster or pay to get items faster is not pay to win by definition.
---
That's not what pay to win means at all. Take your boot licking elsewhere.
---
I thought the millions of Fallout 76 players asked for this.
---
The trailer clearly shows people raiding in normal armor. If ,as i hope,it will have actual raid mechanics,then there might be sections with high rads.
---
I just hope it's not just clear this corridor,just shoot the boss.
---
DEEPER.
---
Holy shit, yeah, I have been stocking up on items I don't really use, but I'm planning on selling, and I'd be furious if I lost them all over some kind of stupid glitch that could have been caught in testing.
---
If they make it a plan instead of an Atomic shop item, I'd be okay with it. Just make them  like they were in Fallout New Vegas that require you have or find the materials to craft weapon/armor repair kits. Honestly this is why New Vegas is better it actually had firearm knowledge well at least the people who made it did and it also came with the game.

Yeah I had my camp all set up for like 2 months now. The other day i was fucking around  and added a wall to where you get in and you.

Have one of these spawn points out of my camps front door. Zoned in to 2 level 91 Deathclaws battling about 5 level 68 Mutants. Was rather fun. 
---
I absolutely understand that sending a message to them that we do not like this move is important.....
---
.......but this is only true for "Basic Repair Kits" according to their own language, for "Improved Repair Kits":
---
"Improved Repair Kits are rare items that we plan to award to you for free as you take on various types of in-game content. As an example, you will receive them as loot when you take down the Scorchbeast Queen."
---
So it isn't as if these items (or in this case, a better version) aren't available in the game without Atoms (free or purchased)....?
---
No I get that, and I know  what I‚Äôm getting into with the risk involved but why should Survival get two double xp sessions and adventure only one
---
If it gives no advantage, then why would anyone ever buy it under any circumstances?
---
Raid with only what you brought with you?
---
Oh my.  I may regret all those super stimpacks I've sold off.
---
1) No work benches?  Citation needed.
---
2) How many atoms?  Have they even said they'll charge for the unlock?  It wouldn't be the first free item in the shop.
---
3) I believe they will unlock (for a price, probably not really free) the *plans* for the kits.  You 'unlock' them in the store, as opposed to 'buying' them in the store (hopefully I've interpreted that right...)
---
4) There is no 4.  But I like your thinking, you should be working at corporate, you'd do well there. ;-)
---
From that ‚ÄúRepair Kits in The Atom Shop‚Äù section, what I‚Äôm taking away is that Refrigerators will probably be an Atom Shop item as well. 
---
This is pretty bullshit Bethesda. Put functional items in the shop and you‚Äôll ruin this game. 
---
The game made no money and hardly sold a fraction of the units they were expecting, they will do anything and everything to get the money they assumed they would have gotten since launch.
---
I‚Äôd your getting issues on that beast then it‚Äôs got to be the engine. I really hope more optimisations come. 
---
I spend most of my time farming white spring which is probably why it‚Äôs so crap for me
---
Cool.
---
Repair kits are not pay to win. They dont give me an advantage over someone else. I will never pay for them and it will never matter. Those complaining are just looking for something new to cry about.
---
I don't see how Repair Kits are game breaking and no one is forcing you to buy them.
---
Don't you have to buy the linings first from the vendor and then you will see the plan to upgrade to shielded. 
---

---
Like really tho what does that have to do with anything?
---
So they can go another route with releasing these things.  You‚Äôve become so complacent that you‚Äôre willing to dish out more money on a $60 AAA title with cut out content JUST for it to be finished. If you‚Äôre willing to stand by and say adding in non cosmetic items is okay, then YOU are the problem. YOU are what‚Äôs making gaming shit. I hope your mother can kiss you with that knowledge.

Use the one that goes up the wall and has a connection point built in, then place that and place one more connector on the top or bottom for attach a wire
---
I mean they might need ballistic fiber to make.
---
ü§£
---
In general, I'm of the same mind as OP that my only issue is that it goes against what they stated initially, but frankly if it's an option of have it in game and it costs atoms or don't have it at all, I'd choose to keep it. 
---
Atoms are pretty plentiful and the flip side of the argument is it gives people who don't care about cosmetics something they can use all their atoms for. 
---
If they give no advantage, why would anyone ever buy them?
---
Any college with a visualization or media development program actually would have the concept of "whales" brought up in their core business curriculum.
---
Nah not the same. I grinded my fortune selling junk and ammo, then garbage guns, now great stuff. That‚Äôs how I got my god tier weapons and ammo. No one paid me. You can buy a explosive handmade for 2-3k caps. That‚Äôs two days vendor runs. 
---
‚ÄòAs an example, you will receive them as loot when you take down the Scorchbeast Queen‚Äô
---
Not bad. But I understand the hesitation. Honestly the repair kit is an unnecessary item for me. With perks I can repair items well past 150% health, and that‚Äôs just a fast travel away. So I can‚Äôt think of too many times I would need a repair kit (maybe carry one into a SBQ fight just in case). And then get one back once SBQ is down
---
Haha as if locking picking is the killer. When I had settings set to medium I my gpu was 80-100% but now on low textures it never hits 100% really but still get those nasty long stutters during combat 
---
I have no problem with it at the moment, until they fix losing caps based on level.
---
I have a level 265 and my friend made a level 60 pvp character for the server. We both have the exact same perk cards equipped and special stats, both full sentinel assassin and have an arsenal of bloodied weapons, same gear, same cards, same effectiveness in PvP. But regardless of that, I would lose 530 caps a kill and he would lose 120 caps. 
---
That means if I went up against said friend, I would have to kill him 4.5x as much as he killed me, JUST TO BREAK EVEN. And that is why it‚Äôs all completely bullshit and idc if people get rid of their caps, they should honestly, no reason not to.
---
Thanks Ted
---
&gt;Also, just FYI, cuckholding is something done to a man when someone else (generally but not always another man) has sex with his wife. So, if you're 'cucking' a man, you're having sex with their wife. See where I'm going with this?
---
Are you assuming my sexuality right now? Not funny. Not ok. Don't be that guy. 
---
And aren't you, after assumptions, trying to insult my masculinity? The hypocrisy of you grand-standing, soulless rapists is astounding. 
---
Stop raping me. 
---
I dont mind the repair kit, but i think if they were to do it they should have the regular one to get in game and the advanced one in the shop for like 50 atoms or someother price like that.
---
Not in Europe though. The game sold over 200.000 units last year in the UK and it was released in November making to the top 20 best selling games in 2018 and this is only for the physical edition so not too bad.
---
HAHA! Now that's funny right there...
---
&gt;  it‚Äôs just beta, it will get fixed soon excuse all you want.
---
I didn't. Stop putting words in my mouth.
---
The FACT is, we LITERALLY do not know what lunchboxes will entail. Period.
---
No, we need rifles to stop weighing so much to begin with.  They're way too heavy for what they are.  They shouldn't be 20-30 lbs each.
---
I am so disappointed about the huge delay to player vending! I was looking forward to this so much!
---
And I‚Äôm not even going to start on how Bethesda already plans to break their promise of ‚Äúcosmetic items only‚Äù in the atom shop. Unbelievable.
---
Yeah, here it is.

"Patch 8 on April 9" and "We‚Äôve received lots of requests for Repair Kits, and we‚Äôre excited to add them in the weeks following Patch 8."

LOL,  I'm the one making assumptions?  I'm the one who is LITERALLY reading it as it is.  YOU'RE the one ASSUMING it's a plan.

You will still be affected because it is an online game where others can attack you.

---
I haven't played much recently so idk how easy it is to earn items, but it just takes the amount of items that you'd want to buy on a regular basis to be great enough that you can't buy everything by grinding, or the grind becomes too extreme. Obviously it will never be as bad as a mobile game, or at least shouldn't be, because it's a AAA title, but it's worrying that there's potential comparisons to be made. 
---
&gt; Tell me lies tell me sweet little lies...  
---
This isn‚Äôt an end all be all. As stated a middle of the road option. BGS or really BGS-Fo76 IS going to pull forward full steam ahead with their decision either way. 
---
I‚Äôd rather buy something with atoms that the game is giving FOR FREE than to shell real money at. 
---
At least with this idea we are getting an option to do both. If your lazy and don‚Äôt want to do the work buy it. If you want to work for your reward the option is there. 
---
BGS with this option can still get money and we can still get item/content without us being strong armed. 
---
And how does this make it more P2W? The atom prices I listed are easily gained a few hours/days of play.
---
I don't care.  I get atoms every time I play for stupid things like eating or drinking or killing animals.  It doesn't affect my gameplay, and I'm not sure why it would affect others.  This isn't a game you win.
---
Yeah but they'll be pretty rare and hard to get if they are rare enough to be put on SBQ. So basically it incentivizes buying the basic kit from the store purely for the sake of convenience.
---
Legendary pipe revolvers aren‚Äôt in the loot pool, but pipe bolt action is. It‚Äôs very strange.
---
No they wont. There have been pretty decent skins, but did anyone actually buy those skins with money? No, they bought those skins with Atoms, that they earned inside the game.
---
That's exactly what I plan to do as soon as they add private servers. Especially when this happens. 
---
This I can fully agree with you on, The weights are ridiculous.
---
Thats not the point I was making lol. Yes legendaries is a stretch. It's what this small door might lead to though. 
---
Picture this, It's repair kits now, Bethesda sees no controversy, and make a lot of money from people buying them in the atom shop. they push it further the next month, now it's re-spec and pay for level up. They see a little back lash, but that money makes up for it. Next month it's perk card boosts. Next month it's buffed armor. next month it's buffed weapons....
---
It's a slippery slope to offer game changing items , because people will always pay for them, maybe not you, or me, but someone will. 
---
I like repair kits, repair kits are fine by me ,but I want to be one of the people saying "repair kits are cool, but don't go to far with this Bethesda..."
---
Ah okay, so people did request this.  Well I'm still not going to freak out until I see it in practice.  If it sucks, I won't buy it. 
---
That's a shame, I'm 102 currently, and have never felt shunned over there. God forbid I play devil's advocate over here though, downvote central.
---
I didn't bother playing the beta, it's Bethesda, it was never gonna be great, but in general I disagree with the whole open beta/pre order culture that's become the norm, I'm old enough and dumb enough to have seen how it's negatively affected games. I picked it up a few weeks after release on sale (would have paid full price) and my experience has been relatively smooth since my first day playing.
---
It really isn't a big deal, all it really does is save a little time and a few materials. It's not game breaking at all, unlike what some people are suggesting.
---
You get 100's of atoms a day for free. IMO it's nothing to worry about, it's not like this is a real money only store.
---
The ones on the atom shop repair up to 100% if I‚Äôm not mistaken, the ones that exceed it, the improved version will be in game only.
---
Of that black power armor skin came back on the shop, I would drop money to get it. Just saying.
---
If they want a sure fire way to kill this game going pay 2 win is the way. just to clarify i am saying offering any kind of advantage to a player for real world currencies over traditional players is wrong. you wanna be like wargaming this is how you become wargaming.
---
I know, I was saying it‚Äôs even worse.  Like, we already had shit pancakes, but AIDS-COVERED shit pancakes?
---
There are cards that do the same.
---
I'm counting them right now. As of now, about 68 posts...
---
I like the challenge of fighting something that has free thought and theoretically gear that is at least comparable to my own. It gets kind of old doing the same old strats over and over again fighting something that uses zero strategy (though I guess the scorched kind of use cover- not well though) 
---
Do you want broken vendors?  Because this is how you get broken vendors.
---
There's a saying - cost, schedule, quality.  Pick any 2.  
---
(Oh, the cost is 0, so that one is already chosen, but you still have 1 pick left).
---
This is late as fuck as far as red flags go. Did u miss the last 10? 
---
Not only that, Atoms can be obtained with in game challenge. You don't have to buy anything üôÉ
---
I don't have much issue with price. It is the lack of selection for me.
---
I don't think most people feel the repair kit its self is some huge p2w advantage.  The concern is that we were told the atom shop would only be for cosmetics.  We don't want it to become something like what you described, so there's a harsh reaction to this as it signals a significant change in direction for the shop and the game.  
---
This isn't pay to win but could be the first step if they go through with it. At some point they can start adding armor, guns and other stuff.
---
I‚Äôve purchase $40 of atoms in the last month and a half or so. 
---
exactly. also it isnt that hard to repair armor. People just wanna run and gun and farm legendaries like this game is a looter shooter.
---
QQ..  it's a repair kit.. it doesn't even repair your items to 200% past durability. The way I look at your still better off going to a workbench putting on weapon artisan or fix it good. Only takes 5 min. Why is everyone crying about this, its not a game changer. QQ
---
Cosmetics give no advantage but they get them
---
If I am already getting all the cool skins with Atoms I earn inside the game, then when they drop the prices, I am also going to get all the uncool things I don't even want. I am just gonna take them, because I have Atoms left over after buying the cool stuff.
---
Your juvenile and century old attempts at insults do not phase me. If it's not locked behind a pay wall it's not p2w
---
Not surprised, going to be tricky to implement. 
---
"This is just one man and his opinions."
---
If they do. I think by making this move, they won't. Not in any official capacity.
---
However, yar har, fiddle-de-dee, so on. Have mod, will travel.
---
If they are like 100-200 atoms that'd be fine.
---
I'll repair the same way I do now and would only use them if my Decon shower got broke and I don't feel like farming a nuke zone.
---
1) You don't know if you're buying a kit, or paying to unlock a plan.
---
2) You don't even know if you're paying, just because it's unlocked inthe shop doesn't mean they're charging for it.
---
(I don't believe #2, but it's a valid question nonetheless)
---
Why nobody seems to understand that starting fresh would just delay the same result? You would have a month of "everyone is a noob" and then someone would start dropping uber guns and armor.
---
Cannot second the demand for hairstyles more enthusiastically. Current crop is so sad. :(
---
Even if it is a plan, the advanced ones aren't craftable. That is still now an item that effects gameplay placed behind a pay wall. Regardless of the efficacy of the item in relation toncurrent mechanics, it is still going back in the cosmetics only promise and if it becomes accepted repair kits will not be the only gameplay altering item sold.
---
Because they want people to play survival of course.. they just released it. And what does it matter, that the literal first 2 weekends are for survival, and only one of them for adventure.. you can‚Äôt be serious about joining a murder mode, then complain afterwards that you were killed on sight. If you just mind you own business anyway, play adventure, and you‚Äôll get more exp that way, in spite of the double exp weekends. AND you
---
Get to keep your caps and aid section.. not a hard choice mate
---
The problem isnt just this per se, I think people are worried in general since its kind of a slippery slope. Games start off slowly introducing things before moving on to more pay to win stuff
---
^ this
---
I bought the power helmet edition. The helmet is really cool, anything else in that box was basically thrown into a drawer/closet. The whole bag fiasco was idiots who didnt even buy the thing. They just wanted to stir a pot. The bag was oddly shaped to hold the mask anyway, which who planned on carrying it anyway? This community of people are garbage. If I was Bethesda, I wouldn't spend money on pr or people to play in the social media either. On the other hand, for those of us that arent complete morons, it's a toxic hell hole. And would be nice to have someone talk these guys down / block thebl heavy negative people who are here for the refund meme. 
---
The problem with discussing P2W is that the definition varies. A *lot*. On the extremes there are people who believe anything that affects any minor aspect of gameplay is P2W. On the other you have people like Chris Roberts of Cloud Imperium who seem to think P2W doesn't even exist outside of direct hardcore competition (or in Chris's words: 'there's no win condition in my game, how can it be pay to win herp derp'). 
---
... I added the herp derp. :-P
---
Anyway, I don't really think P2W is the important part of the 76 discussion right now. Selling a playerbase QOL items, or any non-cosmetic item really, is a poor decision when we're talking about a game that's been ritually trashed since release by the vocal majority and critics. Bethesda should be focused on continuing the good work they've done so far by bringing the game up to snuff and making the players feel like they care and that this game has a bright future-- not for their pocketbooks, but for our community. 
---
In other words, Bethesda needs to court the playerbase, not controversy. And I feel like most people could have predicted this decision would not go down well.

All you asked was about why purchasing something that gives no advantage. 
---
People will spend money on any and everything
---
I would rather the kits be crafted using a good sum of materials used to repair a weapon normally so you still are having to scavenge for the mats but now you are able to repair you gun in the field if need be.
---
Are they forcing us to pay? No. Before we all lose our shit, let's wait and see what happens. 
---
I just back into the game after a month away for these new content updates then they do this. Have you no shame Bethesda?
---
The only thing that should be in the Atom Shop is cosmetic items, costumes, skins and so on. Nothing that gives a benefit to people...because then it's pay to win.
---
That's not an assumption. It's how EVERY SINGLE  atom shop item works. It's also EXACTLY what they said. Unlockable. Go buy an outfit out of the atom shop. What does it say? Unlockable. Then you have to go craft it. You don't have to pay more atoms to get another one, you can just craft another one. 
---
That's how the atom shop works. It's how it always works. You're the one making the assumption that the have decided to change that with ZERO EVIDENCE what so ever to back up that claim. 
---
I have evidence to support that it's a craftable item you unlock, which is every single item in the atom shop.
---
Yep.  I shoulda been a tank or at least 'tank like' but it wasn't to be.  It seems they may want us in power armor.  I don't mind all that much I guess but the constant 'chugga chugga' sound and clunking around gets a bit old.  It could be worse, it could be raining.
---
Personally I don't see the big issue with these repair kits. The only ones in the Atom shop are the basic ones that repair to 100%. The good ones will NOT be available that way. Plus, it doesn't take long before you have so much junk in your stash, repairing is a minor annoyance. With my 200% repair perk,(Which is better than the basic kits anyways) plus all my perks that make my weapons last longer, I can go a pretty long time between repairs. These would be a pretty minor convenience. Useful mainly if I am not paying attention and my weapon breaks.  I would call them more Pay for Convenience than Pay to Win
---
This is kinda how I‚Äôve seen it. I‚Äôm level 108 now, and since level ~25 a repair kit would‚Äôve come in handy only 1 time that I can think of, and that was completely my fault for not checking my shotgun‚Äôs condition before doing a silo. 
---
Same though. Always is The Reclamation Day.
---
If the game needs to adjust the effort it takes to repair, then they should be adjusted through a mechanic that can't be accomplished with real-money. This is EXACTLY the kind of perverse incentive that I talk about in the post. You don't fix a design flaw in a game by allowing people to pay real money to become more efficient than other players.
---
Sure... as long as they are not in the atom shop.
---
It‚Äôs just not. One way a person is playing the game , using their time and efforts to advance. We can‚Äôt conflate paying to be better in a game with being better in a game because you put forth more time and effort. 
---
That is exactly how it will work, because very other atomic shop item gives you the plan. This will likely be a shortcut to get the plan for a new item. Pay 500 atoms or whatever to get the repair kit plan, or play some new event for get instead. There is nothing in there that says "Pay 100 atoms for 1 repair kit"
---
Thats what i mean, i have no problem repairing my items, but i know for a fact i would use an regular repair kit on my shottie so i can save my aluminum for my armor. I think its more of an convenient alternative to repairing items. 
---
...But I wasn't even saying it was P2W? I highlighted that just because of the fact of many people believe that Bethesda had always said it was going be strictly cosmetic. But I'll highlight that one sentence just for you, friend.
---
Just make sure your weapon is topped off before you leave. If you get into a fight with an almost broken weapon, thats your own fault. If you use an entire weapon degredation in 1 fight... you just suck.
---
I agree. I bought a $25 xbox card and used as much as I could in the atom store. I felt like BGS was making good strides so I was okay with getting a couple of limited time items. I haven't read anything yet, but based off of these posts, it might be the last $25 I spend. I don't mind spending as I purchased most of the stuff put on the creation club for fo4. 
---
Unpopular opinion I guess.
---
Spending hundreds on an item to repair your weapon? Shit we better look out! 
---
And you can repair items yourself beyond 150% with the right perks. The repair kit seems like a ‚Äòcarry one in case of emergency‚Äô situation. Who doesn‚Äôt carry a backup weapon anyway?  That‚Äôs sorta the tension of the wasteland too- having a melee weapon break in the middle of a herd of ghouls :)
---
Hey, I would love one of these. Sending you a request now. Let me know on here whenever you have time to trade for it. I can throw in some caps too if you need me to.
---
Really? So these crappy 100% repair kits, (I can repair mine to 200% at a workshop) make you more powerful than other players in some way?
---
Not only that they will also be a rare drop from sbq and other things 
---
Coming from bf2? I don't think bf2 has had micro transactions that weren't cosmetic for over a year now...
---
Repair kit is still shady as fuck, but stop throwing undue shade. 
---
That's total a fair perspective, at this point I would just do it for the exploring aspect and lore.
---
I know it's a very unpopular opinion on this sub, but 76 would have to be far, far more pvp oriented for me to be interested in the multiplayer aspects of it. Obviously that not the direction 76 went in, I've accepted it. I'm just trying to salvage some sort of experience from 76, as I hate the thought of skipping it entirely given how much I loved 3, New Vegas, and 4.
---
Items that have real gameplay effects for atoms... or rather, real money. That is setting them up to justify anything pushing the game towards pay-to-win. That is what we don't want.
---
We get the quest and turret upgrades and all factions vendors at ehitesprings
---
Honestly, I would pay Atoms for refrigerator xD It would be more meaningful than anything inside the Atom shop.
---
I'm not sure on your math here.
---
If an anti armor can kill something with 1 shot where a vampire takes 3 shots.......
---
The guy with the vampire is going to consume 3x as much ammo, his gun will break 3x faster, and he will take 3x the amount of damage to his armor.
---
The advantage gained by a faster time to kill is massive when you add in weapon/armor repair and ammo cost.
---
I cannot upvote this enough haha
---
Since it was a direct response to another post, the context is specifically about repair kits. 'It' = repair kits in my post.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox and I‚Äôm certainly getting double xp, 750 per super mutant warlord is great!
---
I think they did the right thing. I don‚Äôt know, it seems like people like you will always complain. I‚Äôd rather have it pushed back, in honesty, than them releasing it and it being broken as fuck.. so this is definitely the lesser of two evils in my opinion.
---
Fair enough, Ive seen the links to posts people have added so no argument it wasn't out of thin air.  But, at the same time all the other ideas mentioned in the Bethesda announcement (like refrigerators) were things I had seen a ton... And I just can't see using the basic kits so it makes me ask why?
---
I dont know why anyone would buy this useless trash, all it does is broken weapons (WOW! what a big game breaking advantage!). Waste of atoms when i could spend them on funny lookin hair and hats
---
Nobody‚Äôs Fault But Mine - Blind Willie Johnson
---
it looks like it's just the plans, if another poster is any indication. which if that's the case, you'd still have to get the supplies needed to make the repair kits. 
---
Specificity my dear Watson, it's elementary
---
Which is why I said weapon or armor changes etc. A repair kit will not affect my personal gaming experience.
---
Weapon mods, yes.
---
Armor mods, yes.
---
Character enhancements, (possibly).
---
As a side note, if they want us to buy and spend Atoms, im sure most of us would happily pay for cool camp stuff and more custom skins etc.
---
Repair kits.... no. 
---
What?
---
When people constantly come back for more my gun brakes extremely fast. I havent had the problem but I know a guy that used a .50 cal and that think brakes extremely fast even after the buff. It's just an example of a possible outcome. 
---
But you can get them in game too? Also the amount of caps you can get can easily be picked up else where. I think this is being blown out of proportion, people can come up with 1 off situations all day but what are the odds that this would happen?
---
yeah on pc only getting 27 per on my 15 which is what I was getting before the event.
---

^All I have sadly. 
---
I'm on PC. You can get tons of flourescent at Whitesprings, and there's enough for a few stable flux in the queen nuke zone.
---
Blizzard model, sell the hell outta horses, make bank.
---
If they'd just sell 50 kinds of quality costumes and 50 power armor paints, they could bankroll the whole franchise.  Activision (Blizzard's papa) made $1 BILLION in microtransactions in one year (though I don't know if Activision has any P2W games in their family).
---
Or fuck it, add mounts to the game, and just license Blizz's mount models from them for 50% of the profit.
---
I don't think the ammo converters is lazy. As someone who exclusively, and abundantly uses the .50 Cal Machine Gun. It would be incredibly useful for me to pick up the excessive .38 rounds that I can't sell on the market (unlike every other ammo type that someone will actually buy) and then be able to either break them down into lead/steel/gunpowder or convert them. Should the conversion rate from .38 to .50 be high? Yes, absolutely. But the ability to do that would be incredibly helpful and allow me to spend less time farming basic materials in excess just to be able to use my favorite gun.
---
Side note: I agree with you whole heartedly that being able to send loot to your stash, from presumably wherever you want, is incredibly lazy. 
---
Who cares?  The game is very easy, acquiring anything you need for any reason in any amount is literally the only thing you have to do in the game at this point.  Need a shitload of X?  Spend 15 minutes going where there's good amounts of X and get it.
---
If someone wants to pay to not have to acquire stuff to repair, it's the same thing.  Instead of going and picking it up off the ground, they pay real $ and spend their time however they want.
---
This is a PVE game that has had its barely-existent economy destroyed several times over.  Nothing is hard to do.  Nothing is hard to get.  If folks wanna spend $ to get a level 5,000 character, who cares?  Doesn't affect your game in any way, especially if you're playing adventure.
---
Nothing changes for you in this game regardless of what they sell.
---
Wasn't the 970 the card with the VRAM issue over 3GB? Anything more and things slow down due to how they segmented the VRAM.
---
Oh no. I seriously doubt I'll ever use them. 
---
It's just for collection purposes really. 
---
I started out wanting to do this gunrunner kind of RP where I'd be kinda like that guy (but a lady) from John Wick at the hotel who is like the sommelier of weapons and has like semi orgasmic shudders at talking about weapons. 
---
Boy, you are wrong on so many levels if you think Duping still exists
---
Slippery slope argument much? Jesus take a minute and realize what you are crusading for. Here's a quick little pro tip as someone that would crusade endlessly for random shit. Reddit is a small place, it represents an extremely small minority, it also tends to give mind it's opinion towards one thing. Ultimately whether or not the repair kits are popular or not is whether people buy them or not. Do they expand it and possibly "ruin" their brand is 100% based on how many people buy crap. Adding a bunch of posts about the outrage for this will amount to nothing, you can discuss it if you want but these sounding alarm bs is tiresome and makes this subreddit insufferable. Every single patch people  fill it up with complaints after complaints. If you don't like it, don't buy them, just like I won't buy them.
---
Can also buy bulk aluminum with caps from vendors, or even better, other players. 
---
What promise?
---
Very true. I have a few nice PA skins, a hat, and some Workshop stuff without spending a dime!
---
The issue is they said the Atomic Shop is supposed only cosmetic. 
---
Small, temporary promotions like the Unstoppables giving boosts is fine by me but basic repair kits would be something permanent that affects the game, even if it's a plan you buy once then can craft in-game. 
---
I'm very open to crafting a bunch of repair kits but I would rather items like this be in-game. Save temporary boosts for cool promotions like Unstoppables. 
---
I'm all for having the whole story, so this is helpful in terms of being able to decide how 'bad' their choice is...
---
That being said, how that's phrased, I come away from it with the impression that they are "experimenting with other things" ***beyond*** the Atomic Shop, not part of it.
---
However, I can appreciate that this isn't a press release and is a live interview. Therefore, the wording could indeed be intended to be taken either way and really only Todd could tell us what was really meant by that. Sadly it's in the past and now, to avoid further outcry, he *could* spin it any way he wants. 
---
That's just my two caps worth...
---
have a second weapons? Why does he have only 1 weapon?
---
This is one of the easiest multiplayer games in history.  Absolutely nothing is difficult.  Everyone wins, all the time.  Who cares if someone paid to get there?  You still play the game the exact same way if you choose not to.
---
Just to offer a different perspective on your first point I believe the repair kits are geared for dungeons. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they had no workstations in them to keep them moving along instead of having people running around and scrapping when you‚Äôre trying to kill bosses. Just my theory though. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I agree with that, hell I just got the 1500 Camo bundle entirely by working my ass off across WV. It's not what is for sale, it;s the fact that something that is non-cosmetic will be for sale in the Atom Store. Contrary to how we were told that the Atom Store would always be cosmetic only.
---
It's the breach in trust and a sign that Pay to Win could become more prevalent, moreso than the item itself.
---
It‚Äôs not paw to win, it‚Äôs the bridge
---
Why is this what we focus this kind of effort into?
---
To be clear, I kind of agree with this post. I just don't understand (on a side note) why we can use this kind of power to control video game companies (or try to at least) but we can't do jack shit when it comes to our country (I'm american fyi, but this applies to a lot of places). 
---
This makes me so mad that on a whole, people seem more outraged about FO76 than they do about their freedoms and bla bla bla.
---
Don't mind me. I'm just annoyed by Trump's idiocy. 
---
I've been having this happen somewhat frequently lately and reported it in a ticket a couple weeks ago. Been calling it the Tipping-Over-Dead glitch and usually happens when I first enter an area, but it's happened later a few times also. I stealthed past the prison once, but never went in.
---
Had a scorchbeast fall at my feet from the sky once from it, and a glowing Snallygaster died to the glitch halfway through sniping it to death. Since I hit it, I did get loot from that one. Glitch also got the Supply Mr. Gutsy  at Camp McClintock while I was in the middle of trying to talk to it.
---
True. I think they should have blown us away from launch with skins for all weapons and armor
---
When people think large corporate entities owe them decency. What world do you live in? 
---
I guess that's not too bad I suppose
---
So you think the repair kits are good?
---
If you have the ability to spend that much money in the atom store, and would do so just to break the game, why not give that money to people who need it, instead of to corporate America? 
---
You think giving Bethesda all that money will STOP them from doing this? You are the type of person every business loves: surplus expendable income, and nothing to do with it. If you want to hit them where it hurts, stop spending money with them all together. 
---
Totally. Looks like they forgot everyone xan repair stuff anytime for free.
---
Pay to win? Ahaha because someone might repair his gun mid pvp? Do you think you're gonna need to repair ,when pvp is a matter of seconds?
---
I agree with saying that this feature was absolutely not a priority, but crying over zero info is nonsense.
---
They might cost 5/10 atoms each for all we know.
---
That‚Äôs horse shit yes they will. I‚Äôve spent about $40 on Atoms in a few months since starting plating. 
---
I have no problem spending more if the game stays good. Honestly, I‚Äôve been happy to spend money because it seems like the devs really care and they have great communication and community engagement, unlike some other studios. 
---
If it becomes pay to win, or paywalls any content, I‚Äôm out. They heavily implied that refrigerators and food/ammo converters will be in the Atom Shop. Next it‚Äôll be combat items, or materials. 
---
I love the game, but there‚Äôs other games to play. 
---
Repair kits are not the disease. They are the symptom.
---
Soon, they'll add pay walls if this goes unchecked.
---
You'd be surprised how many people aren't in their right minds and do things you wouldn't
---
Nah, I completely understand that. And like I said, I understand why people feel we should raise a big stink about it...I just think there's also room for a more nuanced take on all this.
---
I play this game for the CAMPs, so I love that I can save up for cosmetic items...but there is almost certainly a lot of people in this game grinding for Atoms (because daily/weekly challenges are essentially the only perpetual end game at the moment) who do not find these things compelling or interesting...lots and lots and LOTS of MMOs have "paid" or earned items for convenience which when translated to FO76 may be appealing to these types.
---
EX: Sure, you could level up provisioning and learn the recipes and find the ingredients and craft the food with the buff you need for your raid...or you could just chuck a few coins/gems/whatever at a stack of "fortifying meals" or whatever in the paid shop. This isn't so much pay-to-win as it is pay-for-convenience...which I don't love as I am a cheap bastard, but I don't see them as the same thing.
---
Again, not saying we shouldn't call it out, just...there's a bit more to it than that.
---
They are avalable as rare drop in-game also. Making them not p2w. 
---
"I'm against developers making money for things stupid people will pay them money for."
---
Stopped reading there.
---
Repair kits are not the disease. They are the symptom of bigger paywalls to come.
---
He doesnt he has like 4 .50 cals. But we got stuck in a never ending loop of the people attacking us seeking revenge so once out guns broke we had to just leave despite not getting killed. 
---
I agree. I'm on Ps4 with a huge group of 15+ who play almost every night. We can run triple queens on a server, server hop and repeat. I've found TSE, Bloodied-swing speed, Vanguards-sentinals, ect. The gear is there, albeit rare.
---
Doesn't matter. I don't want anything that can be bought in the Atom Shop to be *anything* other than purely cosmetic. If it affects the game *at all*, it should *not* be in the Atom Shop. They said the Atom Shop would be cosmetics *only*. Doing anything else proves them liars and untrustworthy.
---
The majority of you guys, were from?
---
It seems like there are more new or returning players. I had to wait on servers 3 times during the faschnact event. I was moving to a specific server for a trade, but it had been a while since that was a problem, especially at 2am server time. 
---
Only the laziest player would ever pay actual money for one of these. Maybe maybe earned in-game atoms. But I can repair way better myself at my own workbench. So this is not a must-have at all. Hell, you can also perk up to have your weapons degrade wayyy slower if you really wanted. So chill :)
---
I want pay to win! I will pay 50$ for a vertibird i can control and modify!
---
Thats not my point, im saying that the repair kit is an useful alternative to repairing items if u need to save resources. I just use my lack of having aluminum at all times as an example.
---
20-100 ap is a might as well not exist amount of ap.  Any new character can get that in less than an hour.  I think you've missed the point here.
---
Because people are lazy. 
---
Jesus...they were so close, they were communicating and fixing issues. But the goddamn suits need their money, greedy bastards.
---
They were probably like "We didn't make enough money since nobody bought the game so we need to milk the people who played anyway, its not like they'll stop since they accepted shit"
---
The performance on PC is a disaster. But your VGA should be enough for atleast a solid 60+ fps.
---
God yeah, Ive already seen yourubers suh as Juicehead putting titles such as ‚ÄúFallout 76 Goes pay to win?‚Äù, so no doubt this will get a lot of attention, and me too man, the direction for the game is mostly positive after its launch fiasco, I really only want the best for the game honestly, and that means no cheap scammy things like repair kits.
---
Eastern USA, there's only 2 of us right now. 
---
Do you need more space? We have 200 weight extra . just for one package in the store.
---
will become a post nuclear blackdesert
---
If they get away with this in fallout 76 just imagine what our beloved elder scrolls 6 could become. I mean i guess im fine with it to support the devs, and all games nowadays have it, so i guess its just how it is now
---
I'd pay for a +200 carry weight back pack.
---
The promise Atom shop was cosmetic only. Even in repair kits are light now it‚Äôs still a bridge being built. Still grooming is into acceptance 
---
No point in staying in the fight honestly.  They had no more caps. I honestly think revenge should be disabled if you run out of caps it's just annoying lol
---
My joke is that they should‚Äôve known in the first place
---
Just came through lol. Dunno what happened there
---
Yeah. That's also irrelevant cause why should you not wanting them to be able to be more important than people who do want to? 
---
That's like forcing everyone to stop eating meat because you want to be vegan
---
Plus the atom shop one only repairs to 100%, The in game one does 150%, and with some perks you can already repair to 200% right now
---
They shouldn't be in the Atom shop. I forgot to mention that in the post.
---
Further, since there will be vending, by your argument, everything useful will be duped. Of course, there will be dupers if they can find a way, but that shouldn't prevent a cool addition; rather, the duping must be stopped.
---
Got the wrong perk cards equipped?  I use vampire weapons (yep, even SBQ fights) and I hardly repair that crap. The trick is finding a vampire version of a weapon that is naturally cheap to repair (bless those simple axes). I hack away at tons of ghouls and carry a backup in case. 
---
It states the improved kits will be available but makes it sound like the basic kits are atom shop only.
---
I'm on the side of, let's wait and see what happens before calling for Todd's head but there's plenty of reactionary numbskulls out there.
---
Thats not the real point.
---
1. Bethesda flat out said they would NEVER have a non cosmetic item in the shop.  This is blatantly breaking their promise to us as the biggest concern when the shop was initially revealed was that it was going to be more than just cosmetics.
---
2. sure, a repair kit is not pay 2 win.  However if they do this and don't get any pushback from the community that tells them it is okay to add other stuff to the store.  Maybe next they add a hard to acquire mod plan (and secretly nerf the in game drop rate of said plan).  Or maybe they start adding XP boosters or even exlcusive legendary items to the store.  The repair kit isnt the problem, the problem is the precedent they are setting by adding an item that effects gameplay to the shop.
---
So not only have they now lied to us about what the atom shop would represent, but they are also paving the way to add more significant items to the shop later on.
---
I'd expect nothing less! I advise you not to carry too much aid, because you are not getting it back in any case :)
---
Advanced kits are indeed available as a Queen drop but basic repair kits (or the plan for them...still don't know which) are only available through the Atomic Shop.
---
I've only done it once and wasn't impressed. Just like starting up those stupid reactors. 
---
With that i can totally agree. Any deviation from laid out course right now  esp when it comes to atomic shop is gonna hurt game's reputation.
---
Who cares?  There is nothing they can add that will affect how you play the game unless you also purchase those items.   
---
NOTHING CHANGES.  You will still go do whatever you do.  Someone else will be doing what they want to do.  Most players in this game that aren't retarded are immortal gods in combat, never die unless they want to, and know where to go if they need X Y or Z.  They pick it up off the ground.
---
Instead of picking stuff up and putting it down.  Someone wants to spend $.  Same result, people not paying lose or gain nothing by someone else being lazy.
---
Who cares if they sell 1-shot-everything guns.  All good builds can already basically do this.
---
That's a pointless distinction though. Getting extra XP while I play the game because I paid money is, inevitably, paying money for XP, though I understand you think that the need to play to claim it is an important nuance.
---
But in the end ESO isn't relevant to 76 so whatevs. :-p
---
Oh you can skip that with lock picking + hacking. I always swap those in for silo runs, shaves off a good 5-10 minutes.
---
Agree. However BGS should have known not releasing that kind of info would insight panic and anger. Just release the full thought behind the idea. They do this on buff and nerfs in the patch notes. Why not on ITV?
---
I actually don‚Äôt carry a second, did a queen run today with a fully repaired lever, and the only perk I have is a single luck of the draw, after killing the queen two scorched beasts and a load of everything else I returned back to camp a bit over 150% repair left
---
I kinda feel like it‚Äôs another wave of ‚Äúoooooh popular opinion let‚Äôs get upvotes for my karma‚Äù 
---
Will I use my free earned atoms to have one just in case if it breaks in a big group battle to benefit everyone that one gun isn‚Äôt out of the fight against the sbq absolutely
---
Would work now if they take like the C.A.M.P item floor safe or stuff like that so we can store perhaps 5k max, just so if you loose it all in survival, you can still go back to Adventure knowing you can afford travel, some vendor items etc. I like the idea, but with a limit to the cap stash ,so we cant stash 25k there and have 25k on us for √§n example. 
---
So repair them even better yourself for free. Just a few perk cards and your own workshop/camp. You‚Äôre welcome :)
---
You want to make more money, Bethesda? Here's some things you could sell me that I'd buy immediately:
---
Private server access
---
More CAMP space
---
Fireworks for my fucking flare gun
---
More weapon and armor skins
---
Non-combat pets!
---
More art to hang up in my CAMP. 
---
More hairstyles
---
More clothing options
---
None of that changes the way the game is played in a hostile manner. I'll give you my money right the heck now for a double CAMP budget. 
---
100% agree with OP. All the god tier items come from single isolated drops. All have the same stats. Just look at what is being traded.
---
It was how you 'asked' the question
---
so where is pay 2 win a disadvantage to you here? You won anyway. You could just repair your guns and keep killing them. As for them, if they repaired, you left anyway so it would've been a waste of a repair on their part.
---
Yes, otherwise i would already be on with you guys ü§òüòÅ
---
It doesn't have to be PvP. I've had fully repaired shotguns break on me in the \*middle\* of a fight with a Grafton monster. Seriously. It didn't even last a single fight.
---
I'm against non-cosmetics in the Atom shop. I'm against paying extra for an item that is of use in an online game. I have no problem with buying cosmetics (I bought $20 of Atoms to support Bethesda) nor do I have a problem with DLC; heck, I didn't have a problem with the Creation Club.
---
I have a problem with people breaking promises.
---
I can‚Äôt imagine not using gunsmith. I use auto weapons so they break really quick. Also just as a little tip the power armor weight reduction perk isn‚Äôt good. Once it‚Äôs on your chassis the chassis always weighs 10 pounds!
---
I'm still waiting on the datamined .44 skins!
---
Pay to win is horrible in games. No one benefits from this but Bethesda's wallet.
---
eh, if it was a real money only shop I could see the cause for concern. But as it stands, atoms are very easy to get. I personally have thousands I haven't used just because the cosmetics are so lack luster.
---
That's unfortunate. Have you encountered any microstuttering?
---
Huh. Now that I think about it, I‚Äôve never seen a legendary pipe revolver
---
Paying money to become more efficient than another player is a pay 2 win mechanic in a game about looting.
---
To be completely honest with you, for only 1k caps, I don‚Äôt have anything better than the All Rise. 
---
I do have Two Handed Melees that, in my opinion, are far superior to the All Rise, but I wouldn‚Äôt consider selling them for less than 2.5k, and that‚Äôs for the lesser models. 
---
When I reached end game, I started seriously farming and amassing enough caps to buy truly top tier weapons, and since my build is TH melee, I bought a lot of them. 
---
On the low end, my backup TH Melee Weapons sell for 2-2.5k Min. My primary TH melees are ones I personally paid anywhere from 3.5k to 5.5k. 
---
These values are by no means set in stone. I openly advertised prices I was willing to pay for weapons that met my exact requests. 
---
Must be willing to put your caps where your mouth is when building a weapon collection in this game, assuming you are a notch above a ‚Äúcasual player‚Äù which I assume you are or you wouldn‚Äôt be posting here. 
---
And don‚Äôt discount the All Rise too much. I used that exclusively for quite a long time before upgrading. 
---
I wouldn't say anyone should be making adjustments until there are more details.
---
Increased item degradation has never been mentioned outside the tin-foil hat conspiracy posts knocking about in here. 
---
I made a post a while ago that piggy backs on what you said. And maybe could be the fix to this as well. But good stuff. 
---
you would need someone like you for that.
---
My main 90+ sniper uses various maxed 1 star legendary wood.
---
Not bad for a stealth build and the increased sneak speed is handy, but it should have more mods and the possibility of more stars.
---
A light/heavy variant would be nice. But if they aren't going to expand it, could understand removing it from loot lists, but be nice to add them to the Free States vendor then.
---
Not in the field. It's not that big a deal as some of the other things they suggested 
---
That‚Äôs a really strict definition of p2w though.
---
Imo if you‚Äôre buying something that‚Äôs noncosmetic that helps you in the game, that‚Äôs p2w. 
---
Now this is a low level of that, to be fair. It‚Äôs not like spending money to get free legendary weapons. But still it does give you an advantage, for money.
---
The what is the point?
---
I only gave the situation I can think of where I wouldn't have much of an issue with the plans for Repair Kits being available for purchase in the Atom shop.
---
Stuff for my camp mostly, also a cowboy hat and pajamas. 
---
I‚Äôm a huge fan of Camp creation. If they keep coming out with cool stuff I will absolutely be spending money on it. 
---
If they start adding things you can pay money for to make the game easier, I‚Äôm not going to spend any more money in their shop. 
---
Exactly! I would understand the outrage if the ones in the store were better, but they are junk! I will still always use a repair station for that sweet 200%
---
That is exactly the marketing tactic that is used to have you accept changes you don't want. It will be too late by the time it's actually in the game. I'm not just pulling this out of my ass. 
---
How is being able to repair your item without a workbench  pay to win? Are dumb?
---
So instead of grinding mats to repair things you'd rather grind mats to make individualized repair kits? That sounds like adding an extra step.
---
In my instance it was of no concern but other people it might me. I just dont feel they should have any non cosmetic items in the atom shop. It's my opinion you dont share my opinion it's fine 
---
You just suck at scavaging if you cant get enough materials to repair.
---
Hold on now. It says unlockable via the Atom shop. It doesn't say you have to keep buying them there. My hunch is that once it's unlocked you'll be able to craft them.
---
I dearly hope that's the case.
---
Anyway, as long as they aren't too expensive, most of us have tons of unused atoms because who cares about cosmetics? (yes I know some of you do, so spare me the outrage) 
---
yeeeeeeesssss this this this
---
Some people have all voice chat turned off. 
---
Why don't you just calm down a second? BF2 is no pay to win, I know that. If you had carefully read what I was trying to explain you'd know that the reason for this wasn't EA's goodwill but the community's backlash against their actions. That's the only thing that helps, and that's why the so called crying copy pasta is the right thing to do until Bethesda sees its mistake. 
---
To clarify, it's not acceptable. They promised that the Atom Shop would be cosmetics only and would never affect gameplay. This would 100% affect gameplay, even if it's just a matter of convenience. Thus, it's not acceptable even for a basic repair kit that "only" repairs an item to 100%.
---
Granted, I'd be scared to death to step in there without my full bloodied build, power armor, and emergency protocols active. That shit hurts outside of PA.
---
So what if Bethesda's implementation varies from what a marketing manager/VP says? What exactly is his word supposed to good for? Advertising? We don't know how they are implementing these things, the statement they made is far from crystal clear. Until we do, we can't evaluate the impact, and worst case, they may be breach of a purchase contract. Ask for a refund? Would you like to pursue your remedy in court?  Again, so what? 
---
I‚Äôd prefer different difficulty levels. Easy mode to accommodate those who don‚Äôt want a survival type of game or pvp. Normal can be how it is now but open house pvp. Hard can be less materials and more pvp zones and so forth. They shouldn‚Äôt accommodate just one crowd. 
---
Yup, I can't understand this at all. They added a really good skin for a limited time and then poof it's gone! Like not even once has it showed up again since and that's baffling me, because if it showed up limited time again the people who missed it would dive on it even paying money if they didn't have enough atoms in time.
---
Well now you're talking about something completely different. When it comes to perk cards whenever you open one door you're closing another.
---
I'm talking legendary effect vs. legendary effect.
---
I guess the scenario plays out like this:   You are PVPing in Survival mode.   You headshot him.   He kneecaps you.  In seriatim.  And each of your health bars slowly dwindles down over the span of 10 minutes.  Just as you both reach the nadir of health, your respective weapons break.  But you have a repair kit!  You hotkey it and issue the coup de grace, thereby using your whale-like prowess to ruin his day.   Because that‚Äôs how it goes down, right?  PvP rounds take so long that repair kits are pay-to-win?
---
God I wish cause any lvl
---
After 60 or so doesn‚Äôt make you more powerful!
---
I could final make all the alts u want
---
I'd rather pay $120 because game prices haven't gone up since the 1990s and the cost to produce them has. But microtransactions are predatory and bad for the entire industry and players. 
---
Stop getting butthurt over the internet lol. You excited for atom shop repair kits? 
---
Im not refering to the repair kits in any way, im asking if the default degradation of guns are tolerable enough to not use gunsmithing and replace it with other perms
---
Weird
---
Some people use party chat. 
---
Because they might lose a gunfight to a player who just repaired his weapon and lose bragging rights!
---
&gt;Hey guys, Juicehead here. I wanted to talk for 30 minutes about something I really know nothing about. Repair Kits.
---
&gt;It's funny because there are posts requesting Repair Kits.....
---
show me at least 3 posts of people asking for repair kits in the atom shop.
---
A Lot.  Two words **A** **Lot**.
---
eh, I guess. You still get 1 shot by melee builds. Also, almost no one in game has the same hp levels, there are perks to increase it as well as it's dependent on your endurance stat. 40 extra hp on a guy who already has like 280 isn't much
---
That one was epically ruined for me
---
Does this mean the vendors sharing one cap limit is not coming in this update?
---
Fair points. But why leave something in the atom shop that changes the game state. Albeit in a small way but still a change. 
---
Thank you for saying this. So many people have been complaining about this, like it‚Äôs game breaking or something. ESO has the same kits available, and even though they‚Äôre cheap, hardly anyone uses them. 
---
I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll get your share of down votes, but you‚Äôve got my up vote for sure!!
---
I mean it's all about what's feasible. A lot of suggestions are asking for things would be most likely require new things that need art, animations, etc., or completely new functionality that takes a lot of time and energy to code to and test. A repair kit is just an item you use that makes a number jump to 100. You need some art and little code and you're done.
---
This.  I'm always amazed at how long my 200% stuff lasts.  I see something turn red and actually get happy I can lighten my stash by spending some resources.
---
There are people who don't play as often and/or have the money to spend.  Let them buy this with their earned atoms.  Beats getting a lousy poster or hairdo.
---
Ive bought atoms like 3 times so far lol
---
I am glad other people have noticed that the crappy 100% kit is the Atomic one. I have a feeling I will eventually wind up with so many 150% just from playing the game, I will be trashing them
---
What sight  are you using?
---
The introduction of repair kits and vault raids at the same time is purely coincidental I'm sure. /s Seriously, if you can't see how Bethesda would make them a must-have item for a raid (think no repair stations in the dungeon) and then monetize them, you're just not seeing the money-making possibilities. I hope not though. 
---
But also, I'm super bummed about player vending not being ready. I'm sitting on a ton of stuff and haven't been posting because I thought it was almost here. 
---
i had this problem, deleting my .ini files and scanning/repairing seemed to fix it
---
In a game about looting, paying money to become more efficient than another player is pay 2 win. It means that when two players put the same amount of time into the game, one player gets further than the other. That is pay 2 win. 
---
Those players who pay for them aren't doing it because they're lazy, they're doing it because they want to be more powerful for the same time investment.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt it be Nice - The Beach Boys
---
And that depressing one about being down in the mine. 
---
Yup. It's always after building up a workshop or being 85% of the way through an event or silo, then losing everything/all progress. I tried to disable the menu music but it keeps coming back.
---
There isnt a perk that reduces the weight of the chasis?
---
\&gt;Breaking this promise is unacceptable
---
 üôÑ 
---
Then don't accept it.
---
Bethesda promised a fun and eventually glitch free experience. We got a glitchy, unplayable mess at launch. As a gift we got a 15 dollar game many users can‚Äôt even redeem. Now they‚Äôre making the game P2W at some level. Screw Bethesda.
---
It was a stupid comment for them to make. It's not a real money only store, there's nothing wrong with a few little things in there.
---
I apologize for not having any help to offer, but you're not alone. I can't talk to or hear anyone for whatever reason, no matter the voice channel. I can see people are using their mics but nothing comes through.
---
My question is who even asked for repair kits? They say they listen to the community and implement ideas players are asking for, and this is one of the ideas? I‚Äôve never heard a single person request pay to win repair kits for lazy ass people that don‚Äôt want to use a bench? I‚Äôm lost. 
---
I too want to see this. Can I friend you and come see??  My GT is RhymingFezzik
---
Just normal iron sights on the pipe revolver and short hunting rifle
---
I can also put in a prime 2 Shot explosive combat shotgun. From my past build 
---
Im curious to know how common is it for a players weapon to break during a pvp fight? Its happened to me before while fighting the sbq but thats when I pullout the backup.
---
I actually low key wish they put some of this stuff in the game. 
---
But something isn't always better than nothing.  This might be one of those times were even though it wasn't added instead of the other ideas, it really wasn't needed at all.  
---
To me it seemed unnecessary, but it wasn't going to ruin my experience... but a lot of folks are flat out pissed about it.  Will be interesting to see if Bethesda makes any tweaks to it before it's added based on all the feedback.
---
The people saying they have no issue with this item doesnt understand if this happens its only the start. They are seeing what they can get away with then next thing you know its going to be exclusive weapons or exclusive armor. It starts with one and expands. And all it takes is one to make it in.
---
Good points. I think that is why Black Desert has been able to move to other platforms. If it did not do a little P2W then it would not be on console now.  
---
Gamers... Rise up üëÜ
---
You can believe what you want but try to convince everyone that what they are doing is a good thing. After all none of us know how it will be implemented until it is in the game, and it still cost something. I would prefer that both variants be dropped loot in the game, that could be traded and sold to other players.
---
So....improved repair kit. Lootable drop from SBQ. Like a Fasnacht mask? Cool story bro.
---
It is, but iirc it starts to have issue at 3.5GB. NVIDIA Inspector shows that VRAM usage is usually a bit lower than that so I thought(hoped) that's not an issue...
---
Are you in team chat or area chat? No one in area can hear you in team. There are also outside game methods of talking. Either way we still see that you're talking thru your icon. Most just don't want to talk to those they don't know. 
---
game isnt about looting bruh
---
Right?! If a clean vault wall existed in the shop, I'd buy it yesterday. 
---
I find it depends on the weapon. Some need to have faster degradation and others don‚Äôt. 
---
I'll be nice and stop at 6, but you can do your own research and see there were a lot more

---
I totally get what you‚Äôre saying but the reason for all the outcry is mainly that people are afraid of this snowballing into much larger things. The idea is we stop Bethesda now and hold them to their promise of a cosmetic only atomic shop so in the future we don‚Äôt see other features locked behind a paywall. Essentially we want to nip the rose as a bud.
---
Because the point of the kit is using It anywhere you are without having to find a workbench/switch perk cards
---
And honestly I dont know how to amass alot of caps
---
What if they bought them with the ill-gotten gains from their duping? Because that's most of the guys I know about.
---
It‚Äôs for sure a whole heaping of that ‚Äòlet‚Äôs get free upvotes/clicks/views‚Äô. I agree that I tear sh*t apart and hardly ever repair (my alt isn‚Äôt leveled or perked properly yet, so that‚Äôs a bit harder). But once you can repair past 100%, the whole repair game is a breeze (unless they nerf down the road)
---
I would say you get the mats and then you can repair on the go 
---
IMO If they are pushing this forward, it's for the best. People are hyping a lot over player vending and Bethesda can't disappoint by it feeling a rushed feature.
---
 After all it was for this very reason the FO76 had such a rough launch.
---
A refrigerator,  something that would provide an in game advantage, has NO place in the atom shop.  It should be in the game,  via vendors, drops, quests, like any other plan.
---
Did I hear someone mention my armor :D
---
I am -definitely- hanging my opinion on the "win" aspect. After some of the feedback I've gotten, decided to hit up a friend that works at a kinda popular game company on pvp balance stuff, and he's made the case pretty well that it's changed definition dramatically in the public's eyes, even if I and him disagree with that change.
---
But I still feel like the fact that the advanced and better version being acquired in-game from events is being weirdly overlooked in the whole discussion. Repair kits are not Atom exclusive, and the people who get then from the atom shop will be getting the lesser ones.
---
And I'm 100% on board with holding Bethesda accountable for going back on the "only cosmetic" thing. It's totally a red flag, never thought otherwise... it was the nuance of the conversation over what p2w means I was opposed to.
---
BUT... learned it's more complicated than it was when introduced back in the day.
---
No, but it's testing the waters. They want to know our reaction. They are a big company, they have discussed this in length--this is not something they decided on willy nilly.
---
They *will* add more if we accept this.
---
Just like my mom!   
---
\*HighFive
---
Still doesn‚Äôt excuse them from breaking core promise.
---
Questing, dungeon diving, looting etc. are core components of this franchise. The hope of finding something cool is the game, tied up with a narrative and world building elements. It‚Äôs open ended and explorative so no two characters are the same. 
---
If I find something awesome I feel like I have earned that, if I come out of a fight or quest or random jaunt in a position to restock, rearm and head back out then you‚Äôve hit that sweet spot and that is its reward. 
---
If you want immediacy then different game genres cater for that; FPS for example. Even then most games have a degree of unlockables, in racing games it‚Äôs tracks, cars and liveries, in beat em ups it‚Äôs characters and skins, etc. In RPGs it‚Äôs the (sometimes hopeless) hope you‚Äôll get something cool from that Legendary Super Mutant. 
---
This sort of buy to unlock item is infuriating because it‚Äôs lazy game design tailoring to a playerbase that seemingly would rather have convenience over achievement. Yes; Atoms are easy enough to come by, and I am more than happy for them to remain to buy the odd decorative item. 
---
I get why your upset. This COULD be a very slippery slope.
---
But c'mon, it's a repair kit, not a weapon, or a permanent damage boost. It's something that would add slightly more convenience to a world already littered with workbenches. I honestly can't remember the last time I had something break, I always repair before that happens.
---
Now I have no doubt this is a test of sorts, but judging from the general consensus, I doubt it will go over too well.
---
Preach!
---
You've brought up an important point concerning discussion of the cash shop's general existence. However, it doesn't change what they're doing with this update, which is moving away from a cosmetics-only cash shop. I personally don't care if we can buy it with money or grind for it in-game, this is a no-go. :-p
---
That would be the saddest and most costly decision they ever made then.
---
Don‚Äôt forget about the 150% ones that drop for free!
---
But wouldn't you pay Atoms to get it right now?
---
Same here
---
Ya.  My game defaults to party chat on PSN.  So I don't hear any other voices but those in my party, even though I see their Mic icons.  And my Audio is set only to my party members, not those in game. Unless I go in and manually turn the settings for others on, after leaving my PSN party.
---
I dont have any full autos so i only worry if im gonna have to repair my semi handmade and lever action at an extreme rate instead of just a little more often
---
But anyone can buy bulk junk (aka repair materials) using in-game caps and repair easily. And I guarantee I‚Äôm a pvp battle, repair condition is practically non-existent in terms of influencing who wins that fight
---
I was and I had to relog then the launcher updated along with that it seems to be working now
---
Your gun isn't making you unstoppable in survival. It's all about that armor. (Which costs considerably more.) 
---
There's no middle of the road here. There's "Bethesda keeps their word, and doesn't put a pay to win feature in the atom shop" or "Bethesda lied to us, again, and people are defending that decision". 
---
I find it to be incredibly unlikely that they're going to put something like this in the game and have it be a one time cost. 
---
The system you suggest does not reflect what has been stated will be implemented, so why on earth should I sit here and look at your wishful thinking as anything but that? And if they do, and they make it possible to purchase things that make it so you can get weapons PAST 200? 
---
That's _worse_. That's pay to win in a even more concrete way, _especially_ for specific weapons where _damage increases with durability_ such as the chainsaw, ripper and buzzblade. 
---
Tse is crap in survival. Explosive yes but 2 shot doesn't work if you're vats. And there are perks to better your build to fight these. Fireproof helps, secret agent with stealth boys help so you cant get vats. Its all about strategy and there is some skill involved when you cant vats.
---
No. Get yourself a set of unyielding sentinel and fear nothing. Except for gutsy. They tear through everything.
---
yes, that also.
---
Sekiro my dude, it‚Äôs a great game with no controversy. Metro Redux as well
---
No,  because thats bullshit.  The minute they start putting in items that aren't cosmetic is the moment I uninstall this game again.
---
Guilty of buying atoms for that sweeeeet power armor vault-tec paint. 
---
Truth.
---
Agree 100% with your post. 
---
Bunch of crybabies. Go sell your game to your local Pawn Shop and email TH a big FU message if that floats your boat. Go play Fortnite or Fallout 4 and make YT videos ranting about how much better things used to be. 
---
And while you‚Äôre doing that, I‚Äôll be buying atoms because I‚Äôd like to repair some weapons on the fly. 
---
Shut up already and stop complaining. It‚Äôs a friggin video game. 
---
Well, at least this inspires me dig up that old hashtag from twitter from a few years ago that always made me giggle.  
---
#firstworldproblems
---
none of these ask for them in the atom shop. reading comprehension is important.
---
I don't understand that logic. If you can get it for free by playing the game then there is no problem.
---
It was brought up on another post that these may be for the dungeons/raids that are upcoming. If you cannot travel out to repair your armor and weapons, then these would be a quick fix in your inventory.
---
What a stupid post. 
---
&gt; reddit posts do nothing
---
Not true. Most of the big changes in the game came out of suggestions on this subreddit.
---
Great question, I typically run with backups and typically keep an eye on my weapon stats, never really been an issue for me.
---
QQ so the rich kid has a bunch of repair kits.. cool story bro.  It doesn't even repair your items past 100% durability. Your still better off going to a workbench. I see no issue with this imo. Now if it gave a damage and/or an exp boost.. that's a different story. But repair kits? So insignificant 
---
no i need a refund lol
---
ok, peasant.
---
Yeah, it's not even P2W, it's just pay to play (conveniently).
---
I been thinking about gift carding some of my friends when I have the extra cash. I did not really think about that one. 
---
Make it a recipe you can learn and craft after completing the raid. Then also make it available for atoms so you can either craft or buy.
---
All of this stuff i've seen about repair kits, but I have no clue what they are. Do they repair things?
---
Nice try Uncle Pete. (I'm kidding). For me personally, it will have no impact. I won't buy them, I'll continue to repair my stuff normally every few days (.50 cal takes forever to run out of dura now, even when doing back to back SBQ). However, this sets a dangerous precedent. This is absolutely a "let's test the waters" moment. It breaks the promise we were given. It leads to a very slippery slope. They're already planning on selling ammo converters (consumable ammo conversion kits for atoms?) refrigerators (keep your food fresh for longer, only 1,000 atoms plus 100 atoms per day to fuel it!), etc. 
---
Well don't worry, I'm sure that after I leave they'll stop adding things that give in-game power in the cash shop and everything will be cool. You're good.
---
Where have you been all day? Lol
---
The other vendors are staying put, but Whitespring is getting vendors for each faction except the enclave, and all vendors in the game share the same cap pool. 
---
i never needed that ever... 
---
In case you don't know, 200% give you a huge damage  and protection bonus on the item.
---
100% gives ... well... nothing
---
it's pay to loose, aha
---
They slow down considerably later on, save them for things you can‚Äôt live without. Some good stuff in there sometimes!
---
7.5k
---
With as many people playing and having access to the weapon bench and perks needed. And the mention CAMPS. And with Benches scattered around kinda makes the kit seem un needed. 
---
Hell even perk swapping takes less than 10 second. Repairing maybe makes that under 30. 
---
THANK YOU!!  I‚Äôve been waiting for someone to point this out. I get ppls fear of it being a gateway, but honestly, these seem useless to me. I could see maybe a small use of if you run into a nuke zone forgetting to repair prior, ok sure....but I won‚Äôt be using them
---
Nope, they sold out too.
---
Wouldnt the people that pays bethesdas bills be the ones buying atoms with $$$. Thats why they not listening to you freeloaders.
---
But they listen to me. MORE PAY TO WIN BETHESDA. TAKE MY MONEY! SELL LEGENDARY MODS I CAN EQUIP ON ANY WEAPON. I WANT A 2 SHOT EXPLOSIVE GROGNAK AXE!
---
So are these repair kits gonna be one time use only ? If they are that hardly seems like an advantage 
---
I wish I had that option lol. 
---
Well it‚Äôs all about trade offs. And I‚Äôm just saying I‚Äôm using the legendary you‚Äôre complaining about and repair cost hardly affects me. I choose to use vampire weapons mostly, but I don‚Äôt have issues repairing those weapons generally. 
---
What point do they start slowing down, lv 200?
---
I half expected this to be a 12 page rant about morals and how Bethesda has betrayed us all, LOL.
---
This is what you all get for supporting this game that has been extremely anti consumer from the get go. You reap what you sow. 
---
I can see the use of them but if you go in well equipped you should be good. 
---
My lever gets repaired once a day with weapon artisan maxed and having gunsmith at maxed. 
---
Because its fallout not elderscrolls bigger focus on crafting
---
Because the asshat who you originally commented on deleted their post about how repair kits wouldn't give a "competitive advantage," and I can no longer reply to it, have the reply that was meant for them.
---
"You're right it doesn't determine damage output. Now, this hypothetical situation may be a bit of a stretch, but at the same time it is well within the realm of possibilities. Hypothetically: you're playing Survival. You've just had quite a few encounters with other players and come out on top (congrats!). But your main weapon is on the brink of breaking. What's that you hear? The clunky thud of PA changing in your direction? Oh it's just one person you think. My gun/melee weapon/armor will be ok. That's when you hear more PA footsteps coming from another direction. Now if you have been relying on that one, maybe two particular weapons, or meticulously cultivated armor set for PvP, and it/they break, you're fucked. That's where being able to repair your weapons/armor on the fly will give you the advantage over other players. And that, is where it becomes P2W. That's where it becomes a competitive advantage."
---
Oh wow literally no one noticed man. Thanks for telling us!
---
No one will request something for the Atom shop, they requested the item and understanding is important because the item will be both in the Atom Shop and in the game... read the entire original post
---
"going good". 
---
*Riiiiiiiiiight*
---
 Vaso me?
---
I have had my voice chat off since my first encounter with a screaming child. 
---
If you really want to make your point known... stop playing. If we all organized a boycott where we all stopped playing until they took them away, it might work. Though sadly it depends on if they still end up making more money from those that don't care vs. those that do.

But yes, I at the very least will stop considering buying any atoms if they do this. Before this I was not opposed to supplementing my atoms as long as it wasnt' too costly (20 bux for  a power arm skin is too much but if I had to pay only 5  bux I would have) but I will out of principle refuse to spend any money on it if they go this route (ask R\* how much I've spent on GTA outside buying the game... 0 and it's solely cause out of principle I refuse to pay for MTs that are not cosmetic only or even spending money on any MTs if they put those kind of MTs. Elite Dangerous, spent 20 bux on some skins and decals. So I'm not above buying MTs). And I will make damned sure I'll let my friend know how much I disapprove if he buys any if they go this route (and he has been spending money on them).
---
That's the point, though. They start with this, that people won't really see an issue with. They don't care and might not even expect much from the repair kit, because the precedent is what they're after.
---
YES PAY TO WIN

---
Get involved.
---
well we don't about that know yet, right?
---
Defeats the purpose of having it as a reward, then. It's like asking why should we do the Queen fight for a decontamination shower when we can just buy one from the Atom Shop.
---
Activision own Candy Crush; paid 4 BILLION DOLLARS for it a couple years ago. 
---
Every rose has its thorns 
---
We were talking about ESO and xp scrolls, which work totally differently.
---
The Atom shop is less about pay2win and more about Mr. Hines breaking his word IMO
---
This is not subtle. This is pay for advantage -- not yet to the level of pay to win, but the slippery slope has been created. Next atom exclusive weapon will be offered, then armor, then buff cards, then cap bundles.... 
---
Find something else to be outraged about in life.
---
I agree and it isn‚Äôt ok but the ‚Äúgriefers‚Äù at question wouldn‚Äôt have known that a child was just trying to play the game like Minecraft and that the fact it‚Äôs aimed at adults so these players would have thought it‚Äôs a 24 year old with a cool base and that she‚Äôll eventually repair it.
---
So yes, they did do something horrible but they would have had no way of knowing the situation behind the screen I believe if they knew your special needs child was behind that screen they may not have attacked.
---
BTW: I can‚Äôt stress enough that I totally agree with you and arnt a posing you I‚Äôm just saying cut the greifers a sliver of slack because they would have had no idea who was playing or who they were.
---
What do you trolls gain from going about in subreddits of games that you don't even play? Get a life, please.
---
True but I can usually get a few kills on her every night just by server hopping. I don‚Äôt think it will be that bad. 
---
Unless your being attacked at your camp it‚Äôs pretty difficult to find your killer, and I mean the same concept is already achieved by being able to put aid items in your stash before entering survival. Plus I just like the idea because of immersion, like if you had 5000 caps and that‚Äôs all you had walking the wastes would you really have your entire savings on your person at all times? This is a role play game after all
---
Before Survival mode and changes to Adventure mode, I'd have agreed with you.  Pay 2 Win has always been a thing that allowed for the more competitive(more willing to spend money) to one up the less competitive(less willing to spend money).  Because of this, anything that would give a player willing to spend money even the slightest advantage in a PVP setting is seen as P2W.
---
However, with the changes to Adventure mode mostly removing all forms of PVP, and what little is left being too quick for a repair kit to matter(plus if the workshop has a weapon/armor workbench, you can repair a bit between the enemy respawns, assuming they bother).
---
Meanwhile, outside of Survival currently being so one-sided, it is a competitive mode for competitive people(and anyone willing to risk being slaughtered repeatedly just for 20% more exp).  They are trying to make it "THE" PVP mode, and while they do have some issues to address and improvements they could make, there's never going to be a point where a repair kit gives someone an unfair advantage.
---
Also, just like how a game can change and improve so can the stance of how a cash shop works; as long as they don't start selling exp scrolls, damage/defense buffs, healing items or auto revives, they aren't really the hypocrites you are making them at to be.  Not to mention it's more a QOL item(as are the others mentioned) that people have been asking to be added to the game anyway.  This isn't the "slippery slope" you and at least 1.3k others seem to think.
---
P.S. Can't wait to see how much my karma drops from this.
---
Dang, that really sucks... I'm cool with them not releasing to make sure if works, but I was really looking forward to this option starting. Guess I'll start purging more of my stuff to make room for things between now and then.
---
Not everyone is that elite.
---
PLAN: Weapon repair kit explosive vents
---
I was down to 22 mins, and joined a friends game.. back to 43 mins on all 4 again!
---
Havent seen a ANYTHING, and I've been reading for the last 7 hours.....
---
/sarcasm
---
same
---
Coming soon to a patch near you: sleazy stealth nerfs to weapon/armor durability and the related perks, to make sure you can fully utilise the game as it's meant to be played!
---
Can't blame em for trying to make some money.. I mean at the end of the day. They are a business, with tons of employees and expenses. 
---
Your right about that. I dont want to appear that way so I'm going to remove this post before I get flagged as a whiner haha and your also right about it needing to be finished correctly. Ty for the chat bud lol 
---
"It's not pay to win, its grind to pay to wind"
---
that's the real question :-) i'm glad you were able to see my point
---
I'll add my voice to the chorus: This is a slippery slope towards pay-to-win, and I will have none of it. 
---
I‚Äôve got 1 violet , how many caps ? 
---
You're welcome! I'm glad that you started this discussion between us and then weirdly tried to suggest that it was somehow my fault.
---
All about destroying credibility. I think most people who play this frequently enough know that repairing your gear past 150% yourself is the way to go. I don‚Äôt think many players in the know would really mess with them. It‚Äôs like crafting water filters. Who the hell uses those past level 5?
---
Not clicking that, they‚Äôve been advertised on here enough today lol.
---
&gt; You can believe what you want but try to convince everyone that what they are doing is a good thing
---
I never said it was a good thing.  I said they seem to be selling plans, not items.
---
That significantly reduces the evil, but ‚Äúreduces‚Äù is not ‚Äúeliminates‚Äù
---
I can‚Äôt decide whether the used games market was more utterly disrespectful to the greater good of gaming or if the current knee jerk reaction on Reddit for every bug or justified business decision is worse. I used to feel bad about buying used  but not participating in the juvenile discourse behind what people expect from games and what games actually are is really much much worse and is going to destroy games. 
---
People forget that (outside of some of the highest parts of gaming‚Äôs development hierarchy) the people making these games are gamers too and are doing what they can with what they have. Pay and bonuses are designed to lure the best and encourage the best. 
---
The Jason Schriers (along with every other podcaster or streamer out their voicing opinions other than their personally choice in favorite food should stfu) of the world who get a peek at the world and at best are invited into the vestibule really have zero basis to make demands. So neither do you. 
---
Guys I buy new armor when mine breaks. Todd's only looking out for me.
---
As someone who uses energy weapons there are a ton of cool ideas for skins for the laser and plasma rifle, but it seems like the mostly want to put out skins for weapons nobody uses
---
That‚Äôs how it starts, man.... starts as repair kits and then next month it‚Äôs something worse.
---
The only problem I have with this argument about them testing the waters is the fact that previous experience has proved beth incapable of testing anything out before selling it to customers.
---
Just watch how all the sudden things break easier or it's harder to find anythign to repair them with. Sure, it seems fine now because they didn't design the game to try to push you to buy MTs (they only use limited time stuff to try to push it). But once this starts how soon before they get tempted to rebalance the game so that it feels you need to pay to fix the balance? I mean GTA V didn't start out so bad at the beginning (I could have still poitned out things they did but it wasn't too blatant) and look at it now that Rockstar has figured out that works. THey don't even try to hide it anymore. They didn't even try to be subtle with RDR2 and thankfully that backfired on them. And it's obvious because they are putting in better anti griefing measures (ones they could have put in GTA) than they ever put in GTA (and I will say Rockstar relies on griefing to sell microtransactions, griefers help make it too frustrating to make money).
---
Oxhorn has a great video about this! Connecting the dots between precious games and 76 about what the interloper is or might be. 
---
https://youtu.be/5tTVXcuMNnQ 
---
So you can pay money to circumvent the rare drop... so, pay-to-win...
---
I read what you wrote, and now you're just trying to get internet points after a piss poor explanation vaguely related to what everyone else is crying about.
---
Bethesda doesn't live in a vacuum and is aware what happens when you put non-cosmetics in a shop.  They did it because they had data that said the backlash wouldn't matter compared to the morons that'd buy that junk.
---
Why is the quad Tesla better than the double shot? Is it more overall dps compared to the short burst?
---
Shhhhhh they‚Äôre probably listening don‚Äôt give them any ideas üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Bethesda's wallet is the only reason this game exists.  They're running a business, not a charity.
---
P2W doesn't ruin anything.  It exists solely because players utilize it.  If it was as hated as everyone pretends it is, nobody would use it, and it wouldn't exist.  Instead, it gets put everywhere now because the people complaining are dwarfed by the people paying.
---
Awww I made it angry.
---
Great job man!
---
FYI, only the cheaper 100% are in the Atomic shop. The 150% ones will be found as drops
---
Grinding to get good items is the name of the game my dude. No one bitches about constant legendary runs, or farming for plans or any other type of gear. But suddenly this is an issue? 
---
Well IMO if I pay $80 I‚Äôm payin to get rid of the damn thorns 
---
I think the atom shop versions of the greaser outfit and clown stuff is clean, new versions.
---
Welcome to the real world, I guess.  Promises are meaningless, especially when money is involved.
---
The SBQ isn‚Äôt elite lol. It‚Äôs a bullet fest with the whole world unloading on here. There‚Äôs low levels there all of the time even. 
---
You have to buy treated and resistant, and I found the plan on a table
---
That's 5 atoms each. They'd make 0 money.
---
My chat volume keeps defaulting to bear zero for some reason. So I keep having to mess with settings to hear someone properly in area chat. Also I found out that your headlamp doesn‚Äôt show to other players exactly where you aim. For instance, I‚Äôm aiming down at the paper bag, someone else‚Äôs view shows my headlamp aiming off in the distance instead
---
Yeah, like Planetside 2 did
---
So what if the dungeon raids break your guns and don't have any repair stations? Seems sneaky that they're appearing at the same time, no? 
---
There are surely more people that dislike griefers, but you really can't ban them from the game. The game is set up to be played like that at the moment, even if we don't like it :/
---
I've given this game all the chances in the world and am still here but if anything non-cosmetic touches the atom shop I will have to turn away until such time as they are no longer on the shop.
---
For no reason should anything non-cosmetic be on the shop and it really is that simple. If Bethesda can not keep its word on this then why should I continue to support their still very buggy and still very incomplete game?
---
Well RIP Elder Scrolls 6
---
I'm not even sure what part you want patched.  Conduits of all sizes are free rotating objects that only snap to other conduits.  Even in FO4 they didn't snap to walls, getting them lined up straight in 4 was just as annoying.  
---
You mean that its difficult to use them on brick?  Well...visually brick walls are about triple the thickness of any other plan...so that kinda makes sense.  Its harder to use the passthrough on brick because there's less room to work with.  
---
The ONLY part about using them that I really dislike is that the wire snap point isn't on the actual connector, but rather in the middle of the conduit piece.  Makes snapping wires to it obnoxious because the snap point isn't where it visually should be.  That's what I would want patched, if anything.
---
First off, Bethesda doesn't manage ESO.
---
Secondly, Do you have an example, asI am unfamiliar with what they have on their shop these days. Id wager the effects are very minor to the overall game, unlike being able to instantly repair any weapon from a broken state at any time, anywhere. Middle of a nuke silo? Middle of a raid? Middle of a PVP battle? That kind of effect can chance the course of the game significantly.
---
and I mean improved repair kits are found in game and can not be bought with atoms soooooo yea everyone just calm down for a minute. 
---
Sentinel combat armor =stand still= never die
---
When would I get the modification perks? (Armorer, gunsmith etc..)
---
Preach it brother!
---
I would lol
---
Haha yeah I‚Äôm talking mostly in context of now compared to launch
---
Can you still use it as a drum?
---
Yes, if the reason you think this should be acceptable is because everyone will accept it, I will draw the line there and call it bullshit when I see it.
---
Same argument people told me in GTA at the beginning when I pointed out why paying for money was a bad thing... "it's just a little money, it skips some time".  This doesn't pay attention to the fact that if you pay for something that gives you an advantage in the game, they can start rebalancing the game to make that advantage really needed. To the point the game is slightly unfun without paying for it (you pay to fix the balance). It works and as Rockstar pointed out, companies just have to skim being too obvious so people like you don't notice that is what is happening (you just know it's a bit easier and more relaxing to buy it so why not?). And yes, Rockstar/Take 2 did have a conference where they outright said about how you can't get too noticeably greedy.  
---
So will you still be saying this when they make guns and armor break so very quickly you can't keep up with junk or when the cost to fix the stuff is so bad that you barely can keep enough?  
---
wow
---
Yeah but still this is only the beginning if we allow these on the shop we‚Äôre opening the floodgate
---
I am not opposed to limited release cycles, but that one was literally only up for a day. Typically when games do limited releases, they do it on like a monthly schedule, so you would have to actively try to miss a release.
---
It was never a steamy turd
---
Well yeah, its is bs...but when you think, is ESO doing anything different? I mean their DLC are including game changing  things too. Like one DLC gave you access to workbench that allowed you to change perks of gear, expansion allowed to craft rings and necklaces, And yet I have never heard anyone say that ESO is p2w :P 
---
Found a level 3 locked safe in the basement  of the boot leggers camp just north of watoga.  You have to go around back and the door to get inside is also a level 3 lock.  Also found another level 3 locked safe in the flooded trainyard, southeast from the fast travel point and in the 2 story observation shack next to a train engine.
---
"Basic Repair Kits will be unlockable in the Atomic Shop using Atoms you‚Äôve purchased or those you‚Äôve earned for free by completing in-game challenges. "
---
I can see it with solo with single slightly over 100% durability weapon and missing some gunsmith points.  Would have thought it would only be a couple shots with that gun though.  
---
Personally if I want a "festive" run I'll take enforcer 3 and just clip weapons since it's one shot a limb for self destruct.  Lasts me quite a while even with no gunsmith.
---
Repair kits? I haven‚Äôt seen anything about them, care to fill me in?
---
Yea so stay away from this sub and don‚Äôt come back.
---
Umm... no, I am not... And your attempt at an ad hominem did not go unnoticed.
---
When did they nerf repairs?  I repair my plasma gatling to 200% now and it chews through enemies for ages before finally breaking
---
This is of course the reaction they want.
---
From cosmetic only to:
---
‚ÄúWell it‚Äôs only repair kits so that‚Äôs not that bad...‚Äù
---
6 months later selling workbenches and ammo.
---
Melee?
---
Melee would kind of be an outlier of what I'm talking about because of the lack of ammo cost and the one shot kill nature of melee weapons.
---
This could simply be attributed to falling player counts, so they reduced the amount of overall servers to decrease costs.
---
Exactly! Although they seem to be decently rare, because the only example they provided was being dropped by the Scorchbeast Queen. 
---
Haha. I was referring to the likes of what they offer. 
---
I won‚Äôt deny that would be cool, imagine an sbq fight with a swarm of them
---
We must be having very different experiences then.
---
I am not seeing it as flawed mechanism. If you see that as is i understand however if you look at other perspective like me for instance. I dont have much time to play games everyday. I have wife and kid and work so maybe hour or hour and half a day to play. Then i dont want to go around find springs and other items to just fix one item that would help me explorer the world and grinding for loot because i spent almost 30 minutes to find godamn springs so annoying. So yeah if you have time to explorer and also searching for the parts to fix then that would be good but i dont want to do both as i only have very limited time. 
---
I have to disagree. I don't mind spending Atoms for in game items, here is my reasoning.
---
We know legendary weapons and certain plans and items do not drop very often, and are rare enough that they might as well not even exist in the game.
---
After 5 months and about 300 hours, I just, last night, received a assassin's combat armor leg. 
---
If I could have paid for it with Atoms, and it was reasonably priced, say 1200 Atoms, I could have grinded for a few days to week to get that same item.
---
I get that you don't want to spend money on ingame items, but since Atoms are fairly easy to acquire, I'm all for it.
---
That statement goes out the window if the item is insanely expensive.
---
Actually....you can't do much with "Ore" either.  Certainly can't sell it...although I think you can drop it....  Same sort of thing.  Just class the item as part of the "Misc" tab and it's all but invisible to traders and in the player trade menu.  i think they're making a mistake if you make them un-droppable though because people WILL be willing to trade for them, and player economy is a thing.
---
The way I look at it, they are running a business. Can't blame em for trying to bring some extra money in. They are pouring alot of time and resources into this game with all this upcoming content. So can we really hold that against em? I'm not 
---
I don't disagree. Bethesda's Fallout games have succeeded *because* of mods.
---
Nothing happens at all, I'll try restarting the game. If that doesn't work, gonna repair the files. 
---
Well, aside from the 1400 per day that everyone can get so long as they consistently do it, I personally amass caps by farming Legendaries and selling them on Market 76, but that‚Äôs just me. 
---
It‚Äôs a time investment, no question. I could go through WS and West Tek 10x before finding a single weapon worth more than a couple hundred caps. 
---
The vast majority of legendary pickups are worthless. Single star weapons that no one cares about except casual and low level players. 
---
I take it a step further and destroy all single star weapons and most 2** weapons, keeping only those that I know have decent appeal. I concentrate on the 3*** ones, but even those are by no means gold mines. I sell unwanted 3*** to Vendor bots every day. 
---
When it comes to armor, I try to only carry 3*** in my inventory to sell. I‚Äôll keep an occasional 2** when it has certain qualities, but usually I end up dumping those too. 
---
Like I said, it‚Äôs a time investment. Some would call it a grind. But it‚Äôs what I enjoy and having max caps is a part of the game that I personally find enjoyable. I was Level 178 before I even launched a nuke. Was too busy farming and building my business. 
---
Some players like combat. Others like pvp. I like owning everything and never balking at an absurd price for something that I want. Is the Whitesprings Caddy outfit really worth 3k? 
---
No, of course not. But I wanted it so I bought it. To me, it was worth the price. The reward for dedicating so much time to farming and trading is the luxury of not caring about how much something is when you want it. 
---
But that luxury does come at a price. No question.  
---
No; in the real world, breaking promises damages relationships. People only pretend that they're meaningless when trust and relationships are broken.
---
"We read tons of feedback and suggestions from the Fallout 76 community, and Repair Kits were a popular request that we wanted to get into players‚Äô hands. We also felt we could try out something new with these, both in-game and in the Atomic Shop. As we look to the future, we‚Äôre exploring ways we can bring other community-driven ideas to the game as well, such as refrigerators for C.A.M.P.s, ammo and food converters, and even the ability to send scrap to your stash without having to head home. Repair Kits are our first attempt at a utility item like this, and we plan to make adjustments based on your feedback, so we hope you‚Äôll share your thoughts with us when they go live later this month."
---
Hopefully they works. Good luck. 
---
I've always wondered if I put a water purifer in one of the pools and get pure water of the toxic water that's there because if I can do that I'll move my camp up there
---
Do you have any evidence of it specifically affecting Fallout 76? Anyone can say it's a thing. That's how the trade-stealing thing got out of hand.
---
I've killed a legendary chicken in the game but never saw a legendary rabbit . How about instead of regening health it keeps spawning more rabbits lol
---
That jacket doesn't provide in game benefits or advantages over players without it. 
---
Im with you on this, people cannot be giving them benefit of the doubt, quit defending a company, quit fanboying over this. They're holding QoL updates that we've been begging for since launch hostage, behind a pay wall, behind a massive grind.  
---
Disgusting that they are doing this, if it does come to this they can kiss any support from me away. I'll suffer, through their buggy launches + titles no more, You know why? It's because they will be able to back on their word about any game now, you cant trust them with Rage 2 p2w, with experience boosters and guns, you cant trust them with upcoming TES 6 with p2w weapons, repair kits, alchs, paid mods.   
---
This is a noticeable crack in their foundation and backing on their word.  
---
If they do go back on their word, this is a super big red flag for what has to come. Use your brains people, quit being blinded by your fanboy-ism that "Beth can do no wrong"  
---
( I do enjoy fo76 quite a bit, but if this comes to fruition, then Im done, Im not going to waste my time grinding atoms for p2w experiences or QoL updates that should be free in this game.)  
---
Bethesda is walking a fine line.. and if they cross that line, well, Fuck 'em. I don't need them in my life anyways.
---
yeah. im having a good time.
---
"if we want this game to not die due to PR"
---
Too late
---
Oh lmao 
---
If they want to earn more money from the atom shop then they should be giving us a bigger range of cosmetic and aesthetic items to customise our characters. Give us more hairstyles or tattoos, better/more weapon skins and cooler looking camp decorations. They don‚Äôt need to start selling utility items. Many people are happy to spend money on cosmetic items as long as they keep providing us with new and cool looking things. 
---
I've been having a good time so far.
---
What are your thoughts on the changes of the game since you last played back in January?
---
The only reasons there is a bigger picture is because people are blowing this out of proportion, It‚Äôs not a big deal. The items are not even out yet, but most think this is cause enough to break down their office doors.
---
If I find one I'll let you know. I can modify the t51 torso with stealthboy btw. Crouching slowly drains AP (not cores) and makes you invisible. 
---
Sadly they are probably right. Look at Rockstar and their reputation... doesn't matter how many people bitch about how unbalanced GTA is... it works and the people who don't care and will just pay money to "fix the game balance" (because they can't comprehend the game balance is bad specifically to encourage that shit) will throw money at it with these tactics. Look at how many people are already defending Bethesda on this one and fail to see how this is a really bad thing. We already have a very good game for them to look at to see where this ends up (GTA V wasn't near as bad when they first put out online but as the tactic worse R\* got bolder and bolder).
---
Iv seen folks selling for 25 each unit, if that's not good for ya what's your price lol
---
Lol it could always be worse. 
---
The worst part is that it makes legendary armorna kind of moot point, right? Like what's the point in farming the good stuff? 
---
I also agree that the sound and feel of being in power armor gets old. The game just feels better outside of power armor
---
Bunch of cry babies. Did you watch the amount of armor sold after pvp started on ebay yet everyone cries because of repairing kits... Hypocrite if you ask me.
---
Where did all the TSE and stuff come from? People spend 10.000s of dollars in duped stuff... C'mon guys. If you don't want it don't buy it. 
---
I don‚Äôt know, I made 1600 caps bounty hunting
---
I agree with you unless the recipe is also available in the wild. Then it is just pay because I don't feel like finding it.
---
That's still coming we just wont get our personal vendors yet
---
im not 100% disagreeing with you. I would like clipping. Plenty of annoying spots.
---
Lol i said days ago i was leaving fallout76 because bethesda doesn't know how to fix shit all they do is make more issues hency why my ass is on anthem that game atleast has next to no bugs unlike bethesdas fallout76 
---
Yea a lot of drama queens are writing their break up letters with fo76 as we speak .
---
I disagree with op, this is merely a time saver, not pay to win.
---
I'm going to be at the end of 1000 posts, but this seems like quite a great spot to highlight the idea of adding the ideas I had for morphing Survival Mode into ["Raider Mode"](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b730e5/raider_mode_instead_of_survival_mode_better_name/), in addition to adding the Karma system like the past games had.
---
This would **hopefully** provide an outlet for these players hellbent on destruction by having workshops of the "nice people" to destroy, since it would become Responders vs Raiders. It would allow them to literally still harm those who otherwise don't want to harm them. 
---
I know @Grimparrot isn't reading the thread anymore, but if he does, hopefully he'll endorse the idea :) Not only that but weighing in and offering his own ideas would certainly be welcome!
---
That being said, as someone who purchased a Minecraft server from someone who was an asshole and cheat in real life, in order to preserve the wonderful community I had become a part of... I know the tribulations of being a third party to other's creations getting destroyed, and not really understanding what motivates griefers. Particularly in 76, since in Minecraft they would at least gain lots of materials (potentially valuable), but where's the reward in 76 beyond getting a few caps? Thankfully for the players on my server, we had a plugin that would allow us to roll back specific portions and undo things that specific usernames did. More importantly, it provided us with the griefer's username, and we had a no-griefing policy which meant these players were banned. :) 
---
So I empathize with you here and agree that it sucks to see people's work (especially your own child's) be destroyed. :(
---
not really, i enjoy knowing who‚Äôs poor and who isn‚Äôt. thanks.
---
hahahahaha oh i was convinced.  bummer!
---
They don't mention that refrigerators will be sold in the atom shop, do they?
---
Seems a little out there to assume everything mentioned in this news letter is exclusively going into the atom shop. 
---
Correct, Bethesda doesn‚Äôt manage ESO, but it‚Äôs their property, and anything in the game has to get their approval. 
---
And yes, you can use the repair kit anywhere in game. But in that game, you can‚Äôt use any earned game currency to buy them; you have to spend real money to buy the crowns that are used to buy them. 
---
Being able to buy them with atoms doesn‚Äôt break the game; grind out some more, or just don‚Äôt buy them. 
---
Part of the danger in the game is losing your stuff when you die. Pick your battle's. Allowing people to stash at will is a bunch of shit. Repair at will is a bunch of shit. 
---
I cant wait for the shit show that will become TES 6 when this comes down the shit pipe.
---
I can sell you 5 of each for 300 caps all together 
---
How about no. How about instead... stashing shit doesn't keep it safe from paying your bounty? How about, no matter where your stuff is in your account... across all characters... your bounty is getting paid.
---
Stashing caps to avoid paying your bounty is pure cheeze. (the "z" is 100% intentional... this doesn't deserve to be associated with real cheese)
---
Well then. I‚Äôm currently a stealth shooter and thinking vanguard would be ideal as the don‚Äôt get hit 4head mentality. Unless another set has better effect. 
---
which means whales can play without repair related perks, giving a clear advantage.
---
It sets a precedent of the "slippery slope" variety. If you haven't seen it before, this is what the first stage looks like. 
---
I'm old enough and lucky enough to have some money to throw at this game and I will pay to get something for my camp or a skin I want simply because I want it.  I say NO to p2w for the same reason I didn't spend $40.00 bucks on E-bay for a Godroll gun package. I don't want to be successful in this game by buying my way there.  I hate to see them go down this road too, but they will for as far as they can, for as long as they can. There are always going to be people willing to pay to get ahead of the guy that doesn't or can't.  Bethesda, please understand there is a exponentially huge difference in paying to much for a rug or hairdo in the Atomic Shop, and buying even the cheapest p2w product from same.  Please don't go there.
---
Here we go Bethesda shills showing up out of the wood work.
---
Yes, it works.
---
White Knight was nerfed a few weeks ago and now they're talking about selling repair kits?
---
Food was made to spoil faster and now they're talking about refrigerators. 
---
C'mon. 
---
I‚Äôm sorry you watched his video, but a great post shows he doesn‚Äôt dumb down everyone
---
it sets a precedence for that TES 6 and Rage will become as well..
---
At the end of the day, they are running a business. Can't blame em for trying to bring on some extra revenue. I mean they are spending resources and time on server maintenance, employees, new content coming out.. etc. 
---
Well, if it realism you want... then being killed by another player should allow them to loot all your gear. This is a roleplay game after all.
---
["These will come in two forms: Basic Repair Kits and Improved Repair Kits. Repair Kits cannot be dropped, sold to vendors, or traded with other players."
---
"Basic Repair Kits will be unlockable in the Atomic Shop using Atoms you‚Äôve purchased or those you‚Äôve earned for free by completing in-game challenges."](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eQmVlhbjlkX0GzGb7DB3j/inside-the-vault-looking-beyond-patch-8-april-4-2019)
---
Nothing about them being plans is implicitly stated.
---
Holy hell, you guys have your panties twisted so tight, it's cutting off circulation to your upper extremities.
---
Bethesda already included repair kits in game, for free, at **every friggin workbench". But you want to hand wave and go into hystrionics, because of an Atom shop item that lets you repair to 100%, not the 200% you can get from perks, **that you can buy with currency earned in game**.
---
If you couldn't win without having to repair your weapon mid-fight, or at a work bench, I hate to break it to you, you're not going to win anyway.
---
The Atom Shop is designed to to make money to fund the servers and additional content.  If you don't have money to buy atoms with you can earn them in game so all good.  You can certainly play the game without buying anything from the Atom  shop, but I buy atoms when find things I want as a way of supporting the game.  To me its worth it.  I see where repair kits might be a problem for some people in pvp, on rare occasions, but they would be welcome in long instances.  In any case Bethesda is getting a lot of feedback so we will see what comes of it.  
---
oh boy, they added pay to win
---
All rise is pretty tough to beat. Mine is better but that‚Äôs my opinion, better effects less damage
---
It's definitely a way smoother experience. I'm not getting shot at or anything by randoms (which I really didn't mind). I actually ran into some guys that wanted me to check out the Fair that they started at Whitespring. Shooting ranges, cooking you food, jet pack courses. They were awesome. A really great experience back so far. Can't wait to try more stuff out. 
---
Juicehead has jumped on news he found on reddit quickly before, he‚Äôs had to walk back a fair amount of the things he‚Äôs said as a result, particularly the whole ban debacle.
---
And an upper floor and a roof with the same
---
The atom store ones repair to 100% whereas the in-game one repairs to 150%. You might need them for dungeons but seems like you‚Äôd do better farming the sbq 
---
There‚Äôs literally the same amount of crafting if not more in eso. ü§£
---
And if they make all of that available then great for you! I'll go back to New Vegas and leave you to it.
---
Sold man when you gonna be online as I'm online now. Gamer tag is the same as my tag here
---
Several patches ago they made white knight not work as well. Maybe a few other qol perks as well.
---
What‚Äôs all this about repair kits? Like for a popped bike tire?
---
I've heard that was an issue for some people, but I've repeatedly checked and manually adjusted my in-game settings, as well as scouring Windows' labyrinthine system settings (in case one of their updates broke something - Realtek did update their audio driver recently) but I haven't been able to fix it. It used to work just fine, and then it didn't. I haven't had a chance to test this latest bit of advice yet, so we'll see how that goes.
---
Clearly you don't understand the definition of paying to win.
---
2shot only adds about 25% dmg now, but he found quad meant he didn‚Äôt have to stop firing to reload nearly as often. (4 times less often I‚Äôd imagine). So it didn‚Äôt necessarily kill 4x faster, but not having to lose the target meant he could just keep zapping away. 
---
It might have also had something to do with the build used by ‚Äòthe dummy‚Äô in that case. I‚Äôm not sure if he was using against a specific armor build
---
Just bring more weapons. I normally bring 4 guns, when I am going into a Nuke zone I bring 9 guns. Simple as that. Works now. Will work then.
---
I see why people are upset, but we are creating a problem that don't exist. We don't need them, so we can elect not to use them. If someone buys them, good. That gives money into the game and adds future resources into more game development. 
---
If you're implying I got paid then you're pretty stupid.
---
They did nerf the White Knight perk a few weeks back, reducing its improvement toward armor durability. 
---
Dragon. Lever action. And its crazy strong if you play it right. I tend to aim for weight reduction stats on weapons and gear so i can tote lots and not be weighed down. 
---
Setting mines and using grenades is key imo and also marsupial is absolutely required for vetter sniper angles/safe spots 
---
I truly don't get it. As an XBox player the +AP is a non-issue once I have gone through the trouble of opening the PIP and consuming.
---
Sure people wanted repair kits they could craft... doesn‚Äôt mean they wanted to have to pay for them with atoms. 
---
ü§êü§£

"Are you assuming my sexuality right now? Not funny. Not ok. Don't be that guy." 
---
Valid. I did make that assumption, and kink-shamed cuckqueans at the same time. Not my proudest moment. I know I still have a long way to go. I am very sorry for that. I shouldn't have said it. :-(
---
"And aren't you, after assumptions, trying to insult my masculinity?"
---
Valid. I hadn't thought of it that way, but I should have. You're right about that. Again, you have my sincere apologies. I spouted off without thinking and you appropriately called me out on it. I was insensitive and unnecessarily aggressive. There's no valid excuse. I'm truly sorry.
---
I also made an unwarranted assumption about your intelligence, which you've also clearly demonstrated was false. I offer my apology for that as well, and I hope that you can forgive.
---
No grandstanding, no assault, no trolling now. Just one human being to another. Please don't throw the word rape around like that. I was insensitive. You showed me that. I'm asking you to be sensitive despite me. Please? It's really really disrespectful to many rape survivors, even if you're also a rape survivor. It's really, truly, hurtful. I can believe that you don't mean it that way, but is that really the point? If someone shoots a wolf by accident, they may not have intended to kill it but the effect is still the same. So I'm asking you, in earnest, to please find another shocking hyperbole to get your point across. There are others to choose from which don't, even inadvertantly, mock such a horrific and life-shattering experience. 
---
You guys are just now seeing DANGER SIGNS?
---
Probably explains why the view is obstructed by so many signs at this point.
---
Say that again the day they sell exclusive weapons on the store.
---
Yeah sure!
---
Better get grinding this week and next. Make the best of the double exp
---
dick move? totally.
---
Yes yes, we know you're just after karma. Here your upvote
---
Keep fighting the Man!. 
---
Yes, clearly you don't.
---
Is a kit to repair weapons with. Idk if it can be used on armor or PA. Seems pretty popular though. In a notorious sort of whey protein. 
---
Sounds like reasons to switch  to melee ;)
---
Okay I‚Äôll jump on now, GT is Lady Rot Roh
---
I asked for an example. Thanks for providing one...
---
&gt; or just don‚Äôt buy them
---
That puts you at an objective disadvantage to people who do buy them.
---
It is in the weekly dev update. I am at work and I can't access the main page from here, but just check the launcher or the main site. There is a few posts here about it too.
---
Two people having a dragged out PvP session, multiple stim packs, couple of minutes of back and forth, both their weapons break, who wins?  
---
The one who has to run to a weapon workbench and fix his gear, or the one that paid for a repair kit?
---
Again, I whole heartedly agree. Stashing and repairing at will IS  a load of shit. It's just lazy. Albeit, being able to repair on demand has the potential to be competitively advantageous. However, converting one ammo type into another? Why not? There are a few ammo types I don't even bother picking up because I know I would have a post trying to sell those on the market FOREVER. And they would never sell, taking up precious stash space. So why not give those useless ammo types new life in the way of ammo conversation?
---
Not at all what I‚Äôm going for there, but anyways, you know about the repair kits and still don‚Äôt believe the lunchboxes are going to be a real problem coming up?
---
Rare mats are easy to get if you make a decent farming route or use the market .... 1400 cap limit each day should easily keep you in over abundance of mats from players
---
This is what I pay get all the mats I need off the trading reddit 
---
Shot gun shells= 1 cap
---
5.56= 1 cap  all other ammo except plasma thing are 2 to 1 cap
---
Acid = 2 to 3 cap
---
Ballistic fiber = 7 to 10  ( if you use power armor who cares) ( also With  just your caps from  1 day you can buy 140 ballistic  fiber)
---
Steel  and lead is 1 to 1 or 2 caps at most
---
Plastic 2 caps
---
Springs and screws = 5 to 7 caps
---
Any other mats are 1 caps or less
---
Flux only violet = 80 to 100
---
Rest are 40 to 50
---
How do you get max caps each day... sell craft-able  clothing .... sell  all unwanted chems and purified water
---
Non cap way
---
1 while springs nuke is 10 stable florescent flux that = like 300 shotgun shells ultracite easy  
---
Violet flux farm queen
---
Screws , gears, springs = sugar hill or any office type setting 
---
One 15 min run in a mine is over 1000 lead In Excavator .... Steel is same way with 4 server 
---
hops... 
---
put camp on acid deposit ...
---
Plastic hit the cats lady‚Äôs house both schools
---
Hit all bos miltary camps and other camps like mc clintok  and main bos  building  = about 30 to 40 Ballistic fiber
---
 Ultracite- hit he cavern
---
Silver gold adhesive - farm ghouls
---
black titanium ... mole miners
---
Super mutants gun powder and extra caps to buy stop market....
---
I don‚Äôt understand why people have such a hard time getting mats...
---
Are you like three years old? The adults are talking.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eQmVlhbjlkX0GzGb7DB3j/inside-the-vault-looking-beyond-patch-8-april-4-2019 
---
No they are not skins
---
How can you be big mad over them testing something you can also test for free?
---
I mean, if this is what gets you big mad, start eating some kale.
---
Tell you what, I will PM you but I don't want to post it here and promote it.
---
They are atom shop items that will make you invincible! Apparently...
---
What do they have thats not cosmetic though?
---
Nah, I'm not butthurt. If this bothers me once I have info, I'll vote with my wallet, not whine on the internet. And I never believe marketing/PR people. Their job is to lie to me. Life will be much easier once yall figure that out.
---
It runs like a steaming turd but the game is good and getting better
---
It says you can earn them in game as well...Im really not understanding what the uproar is about. Its not like this is the only way to upgrade your armor, And is hardly P2W. The repair kits dont make you better at the game, Which is what P2W means. Its literally a convenience item. And I saw someone mention a subscription service like ESO+, I say BRING IT ON. I would pay to double my stash space or carry capacity! I dont mind paying to support games I enjoy playing. Thats how they stay afloat and continue pumping out updates and making improvements in the game. Unpopular opinion I guess. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
It‚Äôs on its way to getting better, it‚Äôs current state has stabilised since launch.
---
Were amongst a controversy right now, some concerning news without necessary specifics.  
---
Ok, honestly, doesn't matter.  If they're going to screw us by starting down a P2W path, then an archived example of a website won't matter.  We've got Todd saying in video they'd be cosmetic only items and that won't matter.
---
And I was, up until this announcement, one of their bigger cheerleaders.

Cobbler an relish don‚Äôt stack but the drink can be used in conjunction with either cobbler or relish

Spoken like a true shill. I'm guessing you're the same one that defends intentional time-sink unlocks and the $40 "time-saver" packs? You write as though they're struggling to put food on the table for their children. The person's comment was spot on; this is a test to push you to see how far they can milk you and what changes can be made to make you more likely to be milked. If they cannot make things to put it the atom shop that people want they will try to put things in the atom shop that people need. They also have the ability to update the game to control what you need. See the issue? Their time has been paid for with the original 60-80 USD.
---
ah, I forgot about the White Night nerf. Thanks for clarifying.
---
Not karma, just viability, I saw this guys post and thought I should join in:  
---
&gt; I think everyone should make an original post calling out to Bethesda so that they can see the true magnitude of the issue  
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b9fmqx/psa_dont_complain_about_the_number_of_posts/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b9fmqx/psa_dont_complain_about_the_number_of_posts/)
---
Why shouldn't we feel "let down" that the game maker is going back on part of the assurances they gave for the product we bought?
---
No, if you were actually still playing, then you'll continue to play. This is just another post to hop on the karma farming train.
---
Watch out we got a bad ass over here!
---
both can pay for it with atoms which are free, so at that point it's basically like who came more prepared
---
It isn't pay to win, but we were promised a cosmetic store only.
---
So that's your argument?
---
Last I checked people are paying 10x more for bloodied/anti armor deathclaws. Are you using vampire because you want to? Or because you can't afford something better?
---
We still have no clue what the lunchboxes will entail. You are making a false equivilancy here. "Because A is true, B must be too."
---
7.5
---
Juice probably wrote his script as soon as he read the ItV. I like him but he can be fairly reactionary like a lot of people can. I know I'm guilty of it at times. My first thought when I read it was "pay to win" but the more I thought about it and read more people's thoughts, it began to feel more "pay for QoL" to me. At the same time, I can understand how his definition of p2w applies here. 
---
They gave time to make the changes being called for before Tuesday. We'll just have to wait and see what happens. 
---
All Praise Mr Pebbles!!!
---
They don't need an ammo converter.  Just allow people to use a tinkerer bench to break the ammo down to its base components.  Then you could recraft whatever ammo type you want. Or use the steel or plastic for other items. 
---
Ammo converter is a good way to make another workshop useless (munition factory). 
---
People like you are why we can't have nice things.
---
Which is a shame because this is worse than canvasgate imo
---
8k
---
Yes, when they choose to do it in a way that will eventually get them to balance the game badly in order to influence to pay. Look at GTA V online's history, it wasn't near as greedy at the start. And look how rockstar encourages griefing and makes super grindy missions and a lot of other "bad game designs" they do on purpose to help encourage shark card purchases.
---
Yes, they need to make money. No, I am not going to be ok with it when it is somethign that will effect the product they want to sell badly and make it worse.
---
Its enough. These types of games aren't intended for everybody to have everything. 
---
Sister ;).
---
Yeah but there‚Äôs 2 problems with the way Bethesda chose to approach this request. The first is as you‚Äôve agreed- it‚Äôs a very slippery slope. Bethesda promised cosmetic items only in the atom shop and in this Inside The Vault alone they discuss many other future ideas for non-cosmetic items in the atom shop. The second is the message that it sends to the community- ‚ÄúYou want new helpful qol game improvements? Okay, pay for them.‚Äù
---
True, but no one wants reading comprehension anymore, they want to watch whiny Youtube drama. 
---
signed,
---
An old grump :p
---
I‚Äôve noticed a lot of people are making this extreme jump of ‚Äúthis is the beginning of the end for pay to win.‚Äù 
---
Highly dramatic and unfounded accusations. 
---
Well, I guess my time on this earth has made me a little weary of "promises" made by companies. Take everything a for-profit business tells you with a grain of salt. 
---
Fuck that guy
---
&gt; If we were talkin an damage/exp boost I'd understand but repair kits... are so insignificant.
---
You can respect out of your repair perks entirely because you can buy an unlimited supply of repair kits, thus giving you a damage boost by putting your points into other damage related perks. 
---
Meh.
---
100s a day? In the first week maybe, but once the main storyline is run through, you need to be completing every daily, every weekly, every challenge you find, to be making 50-60 a day.
---
If we are ok with this now eventually we'll be ok with worse implementations.
---
That promise was made before F76 was released. They anticipated far bigger sales number. As long as they don't skrew the game play to make us buy those items i am ok with it. 
---
If you get gunsmith perk maxed, you can totally skip over all this repair kit drama nonsense and chuckle at all the whiners :)
---
They obviously ran into some kind of problem with the system and are delaying it to work out the kinks. This is the right move on their part, both delaying it, and telling us in advance that they are doing so. I'd rather it be late than broken.
---
Being non competitive is already an issue due to the amount of duped weapons and armor. This isn't going to make it any worse.
---
$$$
---
I'm good with everything here \*except\* the inclusion of non-cosmetic items in the Atomic Shop, even if it is solely repair-like/restorative in nature. Just no.
---
Thanks for the info
---
Haha you know sometimes being on reddit for so long can make you forget that females do in fact exist. Rock on!
---
Maybe chameleon because if you fight someone you want to one shot kill them as fast as possible preferably before they see you 
---
At level 100 I'm still making more than I spend. And I guess if you really want a boost in atoms just go make an alt for a bit, lord knows that lv 250 needs a break.
---
Not if we stop them!
---
What better way to manufacture demand for a paid refrigerator than to stealth-increase the rate that food spoils...
---
Damn, if only that point was utterly relevant to the post you replied to.  Then there would have been a reason to make it.
---
You'll note I never said anything about whether or not selling a plan is good.  Just that selling a plan is less evil than selling the items.
---
You'll also note that "less evil" is not the same as "good".
---
Dude seriously, I don't get your problem. I mentioned BF2 as an example for what the community can achieve. Yes, there are people buying these items, otherwise we wouldn't have the problem. Yes, there are many posts about this topic right now. You don't have to participate though, but obviously we are worried about the subject, and some people express themselves. So what's the big deal? 
---
Exactly right
---
No I‚Äôm saying the datamined info on the lunchboxes combined with the real timeline on repair kits is a good reason to believe they‚Äôre going to keep pushing towards a non cosmetic shop. Keep googling that logical fallacy sheet without having any idea what they mean though ;)
---
You know I could really imagine what the quality of this game would be in a year or two with out people spending money in the atom store
---
Well folks time for a new dlc release, we have 30 cents in the budget let‚Äôs change the colour of one spec of dirt and have people search for it
---
What part of "not as evil" means "ok with this" in your mind?
---
I'm just putting this out there. If any of y'all used any XP or duping/weight reduction exploits but are freaking out over a repair kit please exit stage left. 
---
Doesn't mean we cant say something about it.
---
I would give you all the upvotes if I could. 
---
Searched for ya tag but it cant find ya
---
Wait... you want to know facts and details and not just start a thread of reactive UMBRAGE?
---
Nice. Good for you. I was waiting for that. Well done, sir.
---
Why don't you get back to me on the day they do. Until then, stop being hysterical about hypotheticals.
---
I paid full price for the game and I'd gladly pay $20 for an actual DLC (like other games offer). What, exactly, have they "poured a lot of time and resources into" so far? Moonshine? Fixing bugs that should have been fixed before launch? Like 3 or 4 new events? I loathe this monetization model with a passion, because you're defending unreleased dlc to justify them lying and being greedy. 
---
First he's wrong it isn't a pay to win feature. 
---
It's a pay to be lazy feature. The only place it really shines as a consumable is for things that require ultracite or flux to repair. 
---
Otherwise we are all drowning in the regular materials for repairs.
---
What it does do is to help those that play single players that don't do nuke zones often.
---
But there are perk cards that provide the same or better functionality for free and work benches are everywhere in this world.
---
I don't know anyone that goes into a nuke zone with just 1 or 2 weapons or brings their super duper expensive to repair PA into a blast zone for farming flux. 
---
Are you a character's over the 1500 plus carry weight maximum weight limit?
---
If it‚Äôs a mechanics thing could you not just have a toggle on off and it be purely cosmetic? I have no idea how it works just toss out an idea 
---
Very true, you don't need an ammo "converter." But currently we are stuck with no way to make one ammo type out of another, either by literal conversion or by breaking on down. If I can break down all those .38, or .44 rounds and use the steel, lead, and gunpowder for my .50 cal, then fuck yes! That works for me! In that case I will actually start picking those up so I can break them down later. If not, then I will keep leaving them on corpses, or dropping them when I get them for an event award. 
---
It would great if I could find a use for ammo i can't sell to other players and use myself. Instead of letting it go to waste, why not let players use the components to their advantage? 
---
Waste not, want not. Ya know?
---
Joke's on you. My vault suit has got ballistic fiber now. Maybe if you'd learn to play the game you wouldn't have to shell out so much cash. 
---
Well I'm not. They should only be craft able in game. 
---
I think you are down playing the evilness. They start with shit like this to desensitize us.
---
The part where tone of voice doesn't carry well on the internet. ;)
---
Even if all you have to do is kick a rock over to get the better version, they lied that the atom store would be "cosmetic only" and that is enough to be upset about. 
---
Love for Larry's

There is also a  magazine spawn inside the hut I think its first floor, i switched to Melee so its been a while since I farmed it for acid .  Also:
---
 bobblehead spawn on the roof. Its on the shelf by the spit. 
---
 lvl2 safe with a steamer trunk on the second floor. 
---
first aid container on first floor.

Its a pretty fruitful spot for farming.

Why would you stop, you are just going to pick it back up when you are done being angry. Its a great game don't stop enjoying it over something miniscule as this.

Nope. Not worth your time. Don't waste your money. You'll hate it.

How is being able to repair a weapon that is about to break not a mechanical advantage?
---
I agree and will use my earned atoms for them.
---
It starts off as repair kits. By next year it could be legendary weapons, XP bonuses, armor. It‚Äôs not only cosmetic items like we were told. I get that it‚Äôs a business but this is the shady shit that turns people off 
---
Careful there, you might dislocate a shoulder with how far you're reaching.
---
If Bethesda wants to make money, they will move beyond cosmetics. 
---
I am anxious to get a little edge , pay a few bucks and get some cool shit from the Atom shop.
---
No complaints here.  
---
I'm sure, They'll release something like that in the atomshop along with the other QOL ease packs that seem to be where they're headed!
---
Not all of us are cheating scum.
---
No kidding!  We earned the perks why can‚Äôt we trade or sell them??
---
Doesnt exist ^^yet
---
Probably be an atom store buy, as most of the other ‚Äúclean‚Äù items are
---
Honestly all those clickbait bullshit youtubers do, all they do is spread misinformation 
---
any chance you could get him to link his perks and weapon just curious as to what he uses as a baseline
---
Well, that's the thing. The kits aren't op, but it's the idea of it. You know the saying "Give an inch and they'll take a mile"
---
Its better to let Bethesda know now that we don't appreciate anything of this nature. 
---
Totally not sure why you'd want all those repair kits equipped when the regular materials in your stash are free and accessible from any in game workbench.
---
easiest way to not make them P2W is to do two things and it will only work if they did both.  
---
1. make them 10 atoms each with a max of 5 purchased per day
---
2. add a daily quest that gives 2-5 of them for doing something. this should be a forest area daily. 
---
I've had flux spoil before a nuclear event had ended.
---
Ah ok thank you
---
I say no to paying atoms for Items like this. Give me a quest to unlock a plan for a repair kit or a vendor bot that sells them, or even need to repair raider gear, head to top of the world to get a raider armor repair kit, Shotgun Broken? Head over to the white spring resort where you will find repair kits for your favorite hunting rifle on sale now at the black powder etc
---
I lost $150 making this post.
---
No matter how you slice, dice, mix &amp; match it up it is still BETHESDA.  BETHESDA said cosmetic only and BETHESDA is testing this in the Atom Shop.
---
Nobody should be surprised at this point with all the mis-truths, mis-leading information and direction and using the carrot &amp; stick approach....meh 
---
I just flat out don't watch youtubers, that solves all my problems with them.
---
 I personally think every one of them is a waste of time to watch.
---
[Pay-to-win. In some games, players who are willing to pay for special items or downloadable content may be able to gain an advantage over those playing for free who might otherwise need to spend time progressing in order to unlock said items.](https://www.google.com/search?q=pay+to+win&amp;rlz=1CDGOYI_enGB774GB774&amp;oq=pay+to+win&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l3.8104j0j7&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;sourceid=chrome-mobile&amp;ie=UTF-8)

Google Pay to Win and you'll be proven wrong. 
---
You forgot u/Valseek
---
What I don't like about repair kits, especially consumable ones that you have to keep buying with Atoms, is that it incentivizes them to keep weapons breaking fast because it becomes a revenue generator. Even with free Atoms, it's a way to bleed off your Atoms if you don't happen to be interested in much of the cosmetics, to possibly entice you into buying Atoms when they get low.
---
How about my weapons don't break so bloody fast and I'll fix them at my CAMP?
---
Not a troll. I wanted this game to succeed. I'm the biggest fan of the fallout universe I know. But supporting this game makes you all fools. Bethesda does not care about this IP. They only care about separating you from as much $$$ as they can and you're feeding right into it 
---
Apparently they increased the cost to repair weapons in game 
---
You are an ape
---
Being able to repair on the field is valuable. I have had to fast travel a few times to repair something then go back to a quest. the kits are not Pay to win in a traditional sense they are pay to not waste time.
---
I also agree 
---
Trust me, if it gets to that, I‚Äôll be the first guy selling torches and pitchforks. However, until it gets to that, we need to *Dutch voice* ‚Äúhave some goddamn faith‚Äù üòÇ
---
&gt;Repair kits in the atom shop!  
---
&gt;\- Patch 23: Weapon repair costs doubled in-game.  
---
&gt;Winter Weather in the atom shop!  
---
&gt; \- Patch 24: Merry Christmas, we've added a winter wonderland to the wastes!  
---
&gt;Winter Coats in the atom shop!  
---
&gt;\- Patch 25: "Cold Tech" added to game engine resulting in disease and AP drain while walking  
---
&gt;You're right; this more likely?
---
Some folks might see this as counterproductive, but it's true. Folks are more likely to spend smaller amounts of money at a time on microtransactions than large amounts, and therefore they'll buy more things in general over time since it seems like you're spending less money, resulting in more profits for the company. It's kinda neat in a way.
---
This game isn't for you, move along.
---
1. Because no one rolls around the wasteland with just 1 weapon.
---
2. You going into your pip-boy to use the repair kit will render your avatar stationary and immensely head shottable in game.
---
While pressing a # key will automatically bring up a secondary weapon loaded and ready to kill.
---
I don't think it's that bad. Besides, if delaying it means that it'll actually be perfected, then imo, I don't mind waiting a bit longer.
---
Think of a Stimpak, for your equipment.
---
I wonder how long it will be before they take that shit down. 
---
So you are a New Vegas fan. Not a Fallout fan.
---
Heh, then he should be called Halo_Reacharound üëå
---
No doubt vampires is situational. It can be good on high ROF guns but again at a cost of ammo and weapon degradation. Same thing as 25% fire rate vs explosive. Again explosive is going to outperform 25% because of cost.
---
Suppressor would be a fun legendary if not for the increased cost that comes with lower time to kill. I have a suppressor Tesla rifle that I use in nuke zones but other than that you would do yourself and your teammates mote Justice by taking the enemy down rather than decreasing their damage output.
---
Again my point here is that Bethesda kind of painted themselves into a corner here by making ammo and repairs such a major part of the grind. It looks like there is no turning back with the upcoming pay to repair mechanism and several legendary effects are severely hampered by it.
---
See, you've already voted with your wallet, you paid for the game. I loathe this fucking idiotic "people who complain about bad things are just whinging on the internet", like stating that a bad decision is a bad decision, loudly, is a _bad_ thing. 
---
Marketing and PR people are supposed to do whatever they can to sell a game, but when they make a statement and then the company they represents does something exactly counter to that statement, that's not acceptable. 
---
"their job is to lie to me" dude, no, their job is to sell you the product, selling you the product with misleading bullshit is one thing, a literal lie? No. 
---
Basic Repair Kits are not p2w items they are just a QoL addition due to only being able to repair to 100%. Advanced will be obtainable through events and the like and will be able to over repair giving you a damage boost. Atoms are very very easy to obtain and you do not have to pay for them to be able to get stuff in the store. 
---
Honestly I understand why they have to go this route as those who will buy atoms for stuff like this are helping support the game. Because of the large amount of hate mongering that has happened with this game sales are not as good as they should be and we are getting free dlc as compared to a lot of mmo games that charge for dlc and expansion. 
---
I know about him but apparently tagging more than 3 people flags it as spam and no-one gets notified
---
I repair weapons all the time in the field. 
---
If I am in a quest that I think will take a time I carry extra weapons and hit repair benches frequently.
---
Nope, they're not even over their own weight limits.  They're just glitched.  I've tried literally everything...taking off power armor, putting it back on, logging, eating food/water, hitting the run/walk toggle, and without exception, I can sprint once per login and then my character walks for the rest of the time ingame.
---
Also, one of them lost her Garb of Mysteries by being able to somehow put it in storage, and when I removed it from storage it vanished.  Since Bethesda can't restore items and there's no way to make a replacement Garb of Mysteries...that character is permanently glitched in two ways.
---
What is a repair kit?
---
The faces looked really familiar, so the other day I pulled out my "art of fallout3" book and there are drawings of these faces/heads.  I seem to remember them being used as decorations to some buildings in the Capital wasteland. I may be mistaken.
---
Adventure Mode weekend comes up after that.
---
No one said all players were I'm just putting it out there. I'm on the fence because in pvp yes I can see it being an issue but otherwise what does it effect if normie mode isnt ranked?. Perhaps it will come with a disclaimer like "cannot be used in survival mode" who knows.
---
I wonder if you could forward them to the mods and have the mods ban them from the sub?
---
Same here. Plenty of people will buy for this reason. Even if it's a buy each time instead of a plan.
---
Uhh...I‚Äôm not any sort of troll, I‚Äôm explaining that the game has improved since launch day, not sure what post I made a month ago that you can interpret as trollish.
---
You're absolutely right about this changing the game balance:
---
Right now you need to do grinding for lead, cloth, acid, steel, plastic, or what ever else you need to craft the appropriate ammo.
---
With a paid ammo bench you just pickup what ever garbage ammo you find pay 20 dollars for the bench and have what ever ammo you want.
---
Like you and everyone else sensible have pointed out, these things are not cosmetic items and *will* have a significant impact on gameplay.
---
Theory: nobody was buying shit from the shop so they're trying to monetize the game more
---
What they SHOULD DO is lower prices so more people would actually spend money, but nooooook
---
Lets say you can earn 1000 atoms a week for free... That's nice but someone who does that and   buys 1000 more will still have  twice as many atoms to spend therefore will have the advatage. 
---
It's sad watching you play devel's advocate because your too sacred to admit your wrong.
---
They're not gonna change their minds, they're in a don't give a shit about you mode and only care about $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$mode.
---
Did anyone also think that 'free' DLC's forever meant they won't try to recover their 'free' stuff in some other d e c e p t i v e manner?
---
I like the game but the management of it sucks giant balls and at this point if the servers shut down I just don't giva fuck
---
How is this pay to win? It's not like it makes weapons better.
---
You're welcome my dude. I'm glad it turned out! 
---
It's neither unfounded nor dramatic. 
---
Remember when your food started spoiling faster and now they want to sell you a refrigerator?
---
Remember when they nerfed White Knight and now they want to sell you repair kits?
---
C'mon man
---
Thank you so much, just finished it and this is great. Targeting hud, and now I can fly lol
---
Wasn't aware of that. Good to know, thanks.
---
Not you, I meant the guy who made the post. I was warning you about him.
---
&gt; Keep googling that logical fallacy sheet without having any idea what they mean though ;)
---
I know plenty well what they mean. Thanks.
---
&gt; No I‚Äôm saying the datamined info on the lunchboxes combined with the real timeline on repair kits is a good reason to believe they‚Äôre going to keep pushing towards a non cosmetic shop.
---
Sure, they will, that was a given from day 1. But what lunchboxes will actually be, if they are ever released, we do not know. They may have the  atom shop prefix on their IDs, but that  doesn't mean they will end up there. We don't know how they will be implemented into the game either. So comparing them to these repair kits is a false equivalency.
---
It would certainly make it more interesting. It‚Äôd be awesome to see the forest area from above. 
---
Depends how you read it, I'll agree, if all that is atom shop stuff, im gonna take issue with it too. -however- what it says is:
---
 " As we look to the future, we‚Äôre exploring ways we can bring other community-driven ideas to the game as well, such as refrigerators for C.A.M.P.s, ammo and food converters, and even the ability to send scrap to your stash without having to head home."
---
I realise it comes just after the repair kit stuff, but there is a full stop there, i don't read it as definitivly saying those things will be atom store too. Fingers crossd that it isnt, at least. 
---
I have the perk where I can repair my stuff to 200%, and I only had my moan gun break once because I forgot to put back the perk for 50% less gun wear. Whatever it is called. The repair kits would be nice to have, but if you can repair some to beyond 100% with lower wear and tear on it would you really need the kit? For me I can live without it, but with player bending the plans to make them would be cool, but not needed.
---
Fingers are very crossed 
---
Got your DM but maybe it should be mentioned publically. The more the problem gets out of hand, the more it forces Bethesda to act to resolve the issue.
---
Not saying you have to but just in general.
---
Thanks again :)
---
You earn free atoms from doing content, I don't understand what all the complaining is about. This doesn't give you a real advantage anyway. Repairing in the field is just for convenience, you can always fast travel back to your C.A.M.P. to repair.
---
Classic Bethesda 
---
you earn free atoms ingame...
---
Your reasoned logic has won over my initial disappointment. Have an upvote fellow vault dweller!
---
Your inner troll is leaking 
---
I can't playSekiro. I'd lose my freaking mind. I tried playing Dark Souls 2 and Bloodborne but rage quit immediately LOL 
---
I don't think it's so much they have a hard time acquiring them is that they don't want to acquire them. They want to play the game their way. FO4 accommodated this, but 76 is less forgiving. For example, I like to explore and hoard things. Others don't. But I'm not a big fan of running nuke zones so I have very little stable flux. They just aren't enjoyable for me for reasons. For some, a lot of the 76 gameplay mechanics can feel like work.  We're all different. 
---
Well said....exactly correct, we're on to you Todd
---
Yeah, I know that now, in two weeks.
---
The thing is, unless you pay really close attention to the news article, it kind of implies that it won't be mode exclusive except for that actual schedule section.  And while Survival is getting double XP both weekends, Adventure only gets it for the second one.  As a non-PVPer, that seems unfair to me since it's supposed to celebrate "Wild Appalachia and Survival Mode," not "Survival Mode...oh and Wild Appalachia."  
---
Once again, this is just my opinion :)
---
I'd you go through with this I will never purchase another Bethesda game ever again. I stuck with this game because it's fun and it can grow to be better. If you do this I will leave. DO NOT DO THIS.
---
Smh It didn‚Äôt. they got pushed back so they can keep working on it 
---
Nope. Your done unless someone gives up third own. FYI I‚Äôm on Xbone
---
Pay To Win is a shitty euphemism - call it what it is: Pay To Cheat - cheaters never win, they're not winners, they cheated instead of playing legit so their "win" is bullshit/doesn't count.
---
I'm a big cryptid, mysteries, time travel, alternate realities/we live in the matrix, serial killer and space buff. Nothing I probably haven't heard before, but will still give it a watch; cheers. Also unrelated but Sasquatch is my favorite :D
---
Just need patience my friend, I assure you you‚Äôll feel immense pride and satisfaction beating the bosses
---
Bethesda please listen to this guys, fucking please.
---
You can earn them in-game, and if your gun breaks and you don't have a back up your fucked anyway so how is it pay to win?
---
Whelp guess I‚Äôll drop some of these these legendaries That I was planning to sell.  Some of them I Can‚Äôt hold  another month. 
---
They work very well on them.
---
The lunchboxes were just some shit that was data mined and really could have been anything (or nothing).
---
This is strait from the official source. 
---
Not exactly the same thing. 
---
Here‚Äôs an idea: maybe they didn‚Äôt want to release a buggy player vending that duper‚Äôs could exploit because people will complain. So they waited to make it more functional and people still complain. Reddit can find a way to complain about everything 
---
Exactly my point, which is large part of what I don't understand in why people are so up in arms about what otherwise I think we could all agree is kinda a cool addition. 
---
From the description they're handling this the same way they handled repair kits in Elder Scrolls Online. In ESO, the repair kits were sold in the store, but were also ridiculously easy to get in game. I think people are panicking, but don't realize they did this years ago.
---
Nothing wrong with cheating?!?
---
GTFO!!!
---
Yes, but it also costs materials. Using the repair kit does not cost materials.
---
your best bet is just move on and to start a new account.
---
Your the op, are you dumb?
---
Or maybe they spent too much time on these repair paks! I didnt do what I was supposed to do, but look at this other thing I did!
---
Because you can buy the repair kits in the shop. And in certain situations having that repair kit could mean life or death. 
---
Seeing all of the different posts gives me hope that they will see the err of their plan.
---
Ignore the squeaky wheels this time Bethesda, it's only the people complaining here. Most player don't mind it.
---
REPAIR ITEMS ANYTIME USING REPAIR KITS
---
BASIC REPAIR KITS
---
IMPROVED REPAIR KITS
---
For anyone saying it's a plan you craft, absolutely **no** where in this are they saying that
---
I'll throw this out there as I did on the 'official' forums which they are ignoring except to censor you to fucking death......this is for those heavy guns that break when you look at them, not the usual pew pew 1 shot guys, of this I am convinced.  They do NOT fix that and as someone above said, create the problem and sell you the repair kit solution.
---
So, if you're listening/reading BGS, scrap that idea.  
---
Dude for real. I've given up on holding legendaries waiting for the new vendor. And anything of real note I just sell here. Player vending probably won't be as easy as reddit selling anyways. 
---
Pay to avoid grind. Cool cool cool
---
I‚Äôm curious though if the vending machine will have an added stash limit where I can at least store them 
---
Pay To Cheat is a plague on the world of video games, it's not just slightly bad, it's f#@king ***Evil***, seriously.
---
IMO PTC is worse than child rapping priests who sell crack.
---
The long-but-free way is to start a new character, get the worn veil for that one, then transfer it to your main character via a friend.
---
Haha fanboys week 1 "itS JuST AeSthEtiC"
---
Bethesda week 50: Yeah guys were really hurting for cash, start the drip-feed to get them conditioned to it first.
---
The repair kits are a first in many bad developments going forward just watch 
---
Basic repair kits are only unlockable through the atom shop and will only bring the item back up to 100%, advanced repair kits will bring it back up to 150% and will not be in the atom shop rather you'll get them as drops they used the example of you'll get them by killing the scorch beast queen but they didn't say if that is the only enemy that drops them, personally I feel A. It won't actually make that much of a difference gameplay wise it's not really a pvp boost since it's not hard to kill anyone regardless of their armor since the game will balance out your damages to be more in line with each other and B. If they are cheap it won't be hard to earn them i don't imagine them being the same price as clothing or skins because if they want people to actually see them as worth it they be somewhat cheap and they have to show it's worth earning
---
Yes sir!
---
People who design mircotransactions understand that not everyone will buy cosmetics, the pricing makes up for that. The reason I say make better cosmetics is because there are plenty of people that would pay for better items, if they were there, and you wouldn't have to put utility items in there as well.
---
Why couldn't they just put the repair kits in the game, so that way the people who don't have the time to play that much can just find them scattered around in containers?
---
I dont see it changing, fuck people already dont "own" their games, they have licenses which can be fucked with whenever.
---
No shit
---
Free my boi mas!
---
Would you say that camo gives an advantage?
---
It's not *possible* to "over react" to something as vile and Evil as Pay To Cheat!!!
---
Theres a reason I don't play ESO
---
Ahh yes you are 100% correct, you clearly know everything going on with the development
---
The Knight, Knight CPT and Knight SGT all look the same except a small rank insignia on the left arm. The same is true of the Officer and Palidan. Elder kinda looks more like initiate.
---
Excellent. I'm running a drunken priest build and was going to build a chapel but I was going to make mine based on a barn
---
Exactly this.
---
u/BukLauFinancial I was getting a little argumentative and insulting. I'm sorry. But yeah, i think you are stuck on the definition and therefore being stubborn about the whole concept. The point is that once you are able to play real money to get an advantage in-game, the game starts getting worse. It doesn't matter if you *can* get those same items without paying; you will never be able to get as many as someone with unlimited funds.
---
It's just a slippery slope and we are all scared that it will only get worse.
---
Shocked and dismayed, actually.
---
Thank you for apologizing. Have a nice day!
---
Thanks buddy
---
Wouldn't "pro no pay to win" just be "anti pay to win"?
---
Plus some people just have no interest in cosmetics, ever, doesn't matter how good they look. I don't have a problem with some QoL type things like this for people who want to be able to spend all the atoms they have just sitting around when they don't care about changing hairstyles. 
---
If you read the notes, you can see that you can get them as drops from events
---
I keep hearing that and I've got my fingers crossed hoping it's true. Would be nice too if it's entirely separate from your stash so that I don't have to worry about accidentally selling or scrapping something I want to sell to a player for better caps. 
---
"why be mad at bethesda lying about the atom shop being cosmetic only?"
---
I was aware of the bugged achievements, but not the challenges. I haven‚Äôt had one not complete yet. 
---
I was thinking about doing this, and might switch the walls to barn walls and see how it looks.
---
Trust me, making a new character was my last resort, lol.  I actually mainly used the 122 character until the glitch happened, so I switched to my second char who at that time was about level 90.  Then the same glitch happened to her at level 119.  And I'm not one of these people who tries to dupe shit...I just play the game, build stuff, take settlements, etc.  After extensive testing and not being able to fix those characters and getting no help from Bethesda, I decided my only recourse to continue to enjoy the game was to start over.
---
Man I'd like to build some new armor and weapons, shame I have to use those parts to repair my existing equipment.. BUT WAIT, I can just spend money to fix my equipment.  If it was a single player game, who cares.  But FO76 is not a single player game.  If I'm playing in certain modes, that gives other players a decided advantage over me unless I also spend that money.  
---
"REPAIR ITEMS ANYTIME USING REPAIR KITS
---
As there is no mention of a blueprint or schematic of any kind we can only take what they've given us.
---
Too much faith already lost on this team.  They started to rectify it... Wild Appalachia has been fairly good.  But they broke many things with it.  Dailies that can't be completed because Biv won't give you the right recipe and gives you dupes.  The Mask debacle with the Fanascht Parade.
---
People's problem is that this is a slippery slope.  If this is acceptable, then here comes your ammo conversion/fridge in the atom shop.  Things that should be added to the game or should have been in the game since launch.  Then eventually, things that do give a legitimate advantage.
---
Personally I'd prefer better cosmetics. More ways to customise our characters. Make stuff I want to buy and I see the free Atoms as a future discount. Have a lack of cosmetics or mediocre content, I see the items as stuff I can live without or wait until I've earned enough free atoms. I have bought atoms before so I'm not against that, but personally I think the repair kit in general is an unneeded addition to the game; atoms or in game pickup. 
---
They'll just put it on the Player Driven List of Stuff We Want.....and then charge you for it in the Atomic Shop, so prolly sooner than you think lol
---
If you neglect weapon maintenance completely and only have one weapon, it's nice. But there are  Weapon Benches everywhere, you can always move your camp, and you can loot enemies for temp weapons. On a fight per fight basis the kits are only a time saver. The effect is easily matched by time.
---
It‚Äôs the apes who get all their ‚Äúinformation‚Äù from clickbait YouTube videos 
---
That looks like false information. Pretty sure they never said anything about Ammo/Refrig being Atom only. Hyperbolic extrapolations are not something you need to get up in arms about. 
---
I have one piece of chameleon and maxed sneak perk until I get more chameleon. But I wanted something more that helped in various situations. 
---
I was trying to down a bounty last night/this morning. And whatever armour they had I couldn‚Äôt even dent them.  I don‚Äôt want their armour but I want something that I can rely on should I need it. Chameleon is good but only if they don‚Äôt see me. Once they know my location all they need to do pop some psycho and run at me.

---
Todd you did it again.
---
Haha. I think you should brush up on your lore and exactly what the vaults were created for in the first place. I'll give you a hint.. They were to house those chosen to rebuild society after such an event. Not to just " survive ". Move along kiddie.
---
The advanced repair kits ARE being added to the game, this is actually an inferior product being made available for sale that provides NO player boost, only a QoL replacement for grinding for materials. This is just paying for screws and plastic, nothing more.
---
I'm fine with pay to win, because nothing is better than beating the hell out of people that pay real money and still aren't as good as me.
---
As someone who would play with Mas frequently, it's surprising that his 76 journey came to a sudden end because of throwing duped materials (off players that were just killed) away so those materials were not retrieved. Those 76 Twitch/YouTube streams were some of my favorite in quite a while as it was a bit of RP, exploration, and a lot of hunting suspicious players humping one another over a world container. The fact he has the screenshots to showcase this and Bethesda support still does not take action is frustrating. 
---
I don't think repairing your gun is a big enough thing to be pay to win, shouldn't be an issue anyway because you should keep track of it and have a back up just in case. I do agree that only cosmetics should be atom worthy but I don't think the ability to repair stuff on the fly is pay to win.
---
Now that you mention it, I'm a little surprised that I haven't seen anything that "splits" under certain circumstances.  That would be interesting, to say the least.  I wouldn't want the fight to get really much harder, but being forced to change tactics isn't necessarily a bad thing.
---
I don't know....I have evolved my opinion through the day. The purchase is probably for the plan to craft a kit and not for kits themselves, just like it her items. Ii this is the case, I feel that the kits can be balanced in a way as to not give an advantage. That balance would be drastically higher material cost to craft a kit than repair an item. What if the kits cost a bunch of  screws, ballistic fiber, flux, and some other stuff just to craft it. You would not be using them all the things me because it would be such a pain to craft. 
---
Same,  I used to watch all of them but after Yong Yea's constant negativity, I  unsubbed from all them except Mr Matty Plays
---
A G R E E D  ....as was confirmed by Bethesda COD (no not Call of Duty, Company of Deceivers)
---
Hi, Knive user here. Only play with one Knive at the Moment :D
---
I bet you can put that Repair Kit like every other Item in your Quickbarwheel thing and spam it like a stimpak. I don't see that as Pay2Win either, because you cant harm other people with that ''directly'', also you don't get a stats boots or whatever that other people cant get through the normal game, but still this is going into Pay2EZ and thats wrong in my opinion. I know this is a completely  exaggerated  example but whats next? 20Magazines, 20 Stimpaks, 500 Ammo of your choice for just 50000 Atom? Sure why not, lets buy that and sell it for ingame Money.
---
The reason why you cant trade Repair Kits is because People would generate Caps out of it by other Players and as long this stays everything is good.
---
**This** is the most appropriate response, I agree 100%
---
Wait, what costume advantages?
---
Another I think a lot of people aren't thinking about is the weight of these things yes you can carry then around but depending on how much they weigh they might only have a few and no one wants things taking up their space in their stash so theres that too
---
Side note: I would like them to add more unique hairstyles to the atom shop since the only ones they have currently were the unlockable ones from fo4
---
The VP of the company promised this game would not have any pay to win elements, and that the atom shop would be cosmetics only.   
---
It doesn't matter if anyone buys them or not, it is a non-cosmetic item that gives you an advantage in some situations, purchasable with real world money. 
---
And a single action revolver 
---
Dude it is smart if you think about it i could have my house in toxic valley and i'm in the ash heap and my sword breaks instead of fast travelling i can fix it right then and there and with it in the atom shop i can make a business selling fixed items think of the possibilities
---
So what about the people you kill who have no caps you get no reward for killing? That doesn‚Äôt seem balanced, the stash could just hold 1-2k caps like a little savings, and you would still want to bring caps to place bounty‚Äôs if you are killed or claim workshops or do whatever with somebody can still kill you for your junk or aid or the caps you have, but having someone with no caps attacking you with nothing to lose, I feel like the caps thing is more about punishment than reward which is fine and there is no need for the idea if when somebody gets killed with no caps or aid something detrimental still happens, 
---
Yeah, I was like...whelp, gotta give them money now haha
---
Pretty much. I made a post on how we could get the best of both worlds. But I‚Äôm crazy so whatevs. 
---
Based on BGS‚Äô way of things they‚Äôll  full steam on with the idea regardless of what reddit or other places want from them. 
---
Oh, THIS is the danger sign huh? Not the 9999 other signs
---
200% this. People are burning down the village in outrage over something that is a convenience at best and useless at worst. 
---
How are you looting when you aren't playing? ü§î
---
I have nightmares of that happening to me. 
---
Pay To Cheat is vile and Evil in all forms, no matter how innocent you try to make it out to be, no no no!
---
It ***must*** be stopped.
---
My question to you would be.  Where do you draw the line?  If this isn‚Äôt pay to win, will the next addition be? Or the one after that? Or what do you consider pay to win? Then it turns into a ever escalating pay to win where finally they have legendaries in the shop.  That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm afraid of. 
---
If it's a licence it should not cost as much as owning the game and then that would justify the aggressive monetisation. But they charge full wack for half made games they then put more effort into monetary parts of. 
---
Easy fix for that....they'll just make the challenges more and more unattainable or bug infested, sucking the oxygen out of the room 1 molecule at a time until you don't know you've just been asphyxiated 
---
I'm in agreement with you.  It's something that may not be NEEDED right now, but once available I can see things progressing to the point where they are required.  We've already seen the adjustments on food decay, and weapon condition.  How Long till the "I bring 4 guns every where I go" crew gets fed up at the bullet sponge enemies in a dungeon with no crafting/repair stations to be found.  How long until 4 guns isn't enough because of weapon condition degrading faster and faster each patch.
---
I think the people who have a problem with this can see further than the it doesn't matter group.  Try to look months into the future and predict what you'll see.  We've all been screwed over too many times to let stuff like this just slide.
---
You have it backwards is why. 1% to 100% everything has the exact same stats but when you go over 100% melee weapons and armor gain mpre damage and dr.
---
That's what happens when you get older, you can't handle your liquor.
---
That isn't in the field. That is at  bench.
---
Preach! 
---
The only way I will have a problem with ammo conversation/break down will be if it is somehow tied to the Atom Shop. If anyone has to pay or grind dailies/weeklies to convert and/or break down ammo, then fuck that.
---
Y‚Äôall crazy if you still play this game. I gave up after the first week.
---
"it's ok if you lie to me, I don't mind"
---
I see. I could have looked it up before commenting and I ended up finding it before you shared this with me. 
---
So what I have to say is you're crying over spilled milk. This isnt that bad. This is a QOL improvement for the people who dont have as much time to play this game. You really have to sink time into this game for it to be tons of fun. 
---
"Unlockable" means "bought" in the atom shop. Just look when you buy anything it says its unlocked. It's because we already have all of the files in the old hard drive, not something that is downloaded when we purchase it. We just need a key to be able to use them. A key that unlocks- and costs money. 
---
That feels like a fairly niche reason to be ok with pay to win. Especially since pay to win usually just makes a game go to shit.
---
Yeah, I'm definitely not saying that they SHOULDN'T add more cosmetics, especially for me I want more CAMP items since I'm personally more likely to buy those than I would buy skins for weapons or armor. 
---
Just that I think adding diversity to what's available isn't a bad thing, just like I'm actually disappointed we lost out on the lunchboxes just because people immediately started flaming the sub before even listening to both sides 
---
If true this needs to be highlighted in the O.P.!
---
Any luck?
---
The slippery slope argument is weak though, because it's so meaningless.  Every decision anyone ever makes can be boiled down to what could possibly happen next.  It's amazing that games have made it to where they are because gamers are constantly in a state of paralysis.  At this point we don't even know what this is.
---
Your loss.
---
Buying the game again is not the solution. That's the opposite direction one would want to go when the problem is with Bethesda / their support team.
---
I haven't booted up the game in a bit... what do these repair kits actually do?  Fix guns?  Camps?
---
I'll hut you up next time I'm on Xbox - guyb9 - I'd like to come along and check it and roll with fellow men of the cloth
---
So, the repair kit is the new horse armor?  Sorry, had to be said..... 
---
I said I'd stop when they add them. So I will be stopping next patch unless they change their minds.
---
I'd say not because there is already a camo outfit in the game. Power armor tho, that's a hard maybe.
---
Well pay to be lazy and pay to win are the same, your wrong
---
Pay to win just means it makes the game easier or saves you time on grinding stuff or irl money
---
People seem to forget a huge X factor here. Bethesda is not in control of this. We are. If they put something in the shop and it doesn't sell it will go away. 
---
Here's another thing to think about. New revenue could be connected to more content down the road. If they can find new revenue streams this game could last longer. 
---
Ok. Just posting the source you asked for.
---
Which brings back to the, let's wait and see what happens. No need to be shitty till we know what's going on!
---
Dump sniper. Max out tank killer. 3/3 concentrated fire is debatable. I‚Äôd be more inclined to go 1/3 or 2/3 conc fire and max out 9/9 rifleman. I‚Äôm running 3/3 conc fire but I‚Äôm working on shifting to long shot and seeing how that works for me. 
---
If they are going to ask us to spend atoms, then at least fix the challenges so atoms are being awarded.
---
* Locations challenges are glitched and cannot be completed - even though I have discovered all locations, the challenges are not showing I have
---
* Disease challenge is glitched, and even though I have gotten sludge lung numerous times, it wont unlock 
---
* etc....
---
Nice point....stares at camo pack purchase.....In pvp yes.
---
you must be on PC on console we just have to make a new account
---
People need to spend a little time wetting the bed over nonsense and more time moving some SPECIAL points over to Luck to get Lucky Break or Luck of the Draw and their repair woes are literally gone. You get either of them at  level 14 and 24 FFS
---
Good on you man for risking the down voting mob over this issue
---
Cries in *pcmr*
---
I think the repair kits are the limit, anything that could give you extra damage or an excellent gun is over the top, repair kits are right up on the edge of pay to win but not quite in my opinion.
---
I appreciate it.
---
So you want the straight pay to win option. As that is would be equal to the closest.
---
They still haven't been added, but that's what they are supposed to do.
---
The cosmetics dont give an advantage, so why would anyone buy that garbage?
---
dude u predicted the death of fortnite.. oh my
---
Any form of Pay To Cheat is vile, Evil, despicable, period.
---
No no no!  This must be stopped, must not be tolerated!
---
I agree with you on the point that the idea of repair kits is a great idea for the game but they should absolutely not be on the atomic shop. We were promised a cosmetic only atomic shop and if they go back on their promise now nothing is stopping them from doing much worse additions In the future.
---
I know, not a huge deal, just goes a bit beyond cosmetic is all...
---
If he didn't want to have the discussion, then he didn't need to post on the thread. He didn't even have to read it. He started the discussion between him and I.
---
what are these repair kits your referring too? Some sort of magical item that will tear apart the fabric of the universe?
---
This is the state of gaming culture. It‚Äôs super annoying. I feel like devs or companies shouldn‚Äôt even mention road maps or future content. Just drop it on folks and let it simmer. Early access = complaints and hate as if the ones bitching don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs early access? Road maps lead to wandering minds of how it will be implemented and ruin the game when it ain‚Äôt even out yet. 
---
Announcing a game 6-12 months before it even comes out stirs the pots and floods YouTube with personal opinions that some how shape the future of a game that‚Äôs not even out. 
---
Games used to be highlighted in magazines, and we would read about them and either be excited for it or not. Now days a game gets announced and people flood the web with all the possible negativity that can be highlighted and everyone raises their pitchforks. Even people that wouldn‚Äôt have even played it. Bandwagon haters are thru the roof
---
This^
---
I quit ESO because I can't tolerate Pay To Cheat.
---
Not here, not in this game too - f#@k no!!!
---
"My opinion is right and everyone else is wrong!"
---
GTFO
---
You mean you support pay to play.  Well I don‚Äôt. And we are both entitled to our opinions.
---
I completely agree with you!! I hate the way they sound through their breathers/respirators!! It‚Äôs so creepy...(glad I‚Äôm not alone with this!! LOL)
---
Haha alright! Ill be on in a few hours when I get off work.
---
Yep. The ones *not* working together got their asses kicked. 
---
Technically that is ridiculous bullshit and you know it
---
There are workbenches everywhere in the world. Multiple per dungeon even. 
---
You have bought the MOD for 500 caps at the Enclave bunker, not the plan. And at Watoga, the Phoenix BOS vendor bot sells plans for jet packs, but not for the X-01.
---
&gt;It's just a slippery slope and we are all scared that it will only get worse.
---
More then that - modern gaming history shows us that it usually does get worse, and that Fallout 76 is unlikely to be an exception. 
---
Good point. It fits into the definition of cosmetics so I'm not bothered. To further expand on your question, if one item gave you stealth-boy like visuals, would this still be cosmetic only? Lots of grey zones :)
---
This reminds me of the great Horse armor fiasco of 2006. #shockwaves 
---
"One of the worst things about modern gaming culture is that there are people who are talking about things that I don't want them to talk about, in ways I don't want them to talk about it". I love that about this subreddit.   
---
if you don't find value in youtube content...stop watching it? 
---
Pay To Cheat is vile Evil despicable, ***never*** OK.
---
when? I didnt noticed this at all
---
I dont know. "We plan on bringing these to the store that you can pay real money for" sounds pretty clear cut to me. 
---
If you want to argue that it's just a small convenience thing than fine. But you can't argue that it isn't happening. Because they said it was with their own words. Words that may seem fairly casual, but I guarantee were very meticulously planned. 
---
I want a legendary shovel...
---
That too! I always want to use them on my melee build 
---
They're clearly not pay to win; so yeah, the kneejerk response and clickbait title are annoying.
---
PS: So this comment itself doesn't trigger kneejerk responses, I am NOT defending Bethesda going back on their word. 
---
I've seen several "bethesda is lying through their teeth and it's a-ok with me threads" and they're all ridiculous
---
Tf Bethesda?
---
Pay To Cheat is vile Evil despicable and never OK!
---
My example was the repair kits from ESO. I apologize if that wasn‚Äôt clear. 
---
Yes it‚Äôs an objective disadvantage, but you chose to not buy them. It‚Äôs no different than people who bought duped TSE weapons with real money; regardless of how nerfed they are, they are still more powerful than base weapons of the same type, so you‚Äôre at an objective disadvantage because you didn‚Äôt spend money there either. 
---
I don't have to look months into the future for this. This is the same company that runs ESO, and the online store there has yet to create a single thing that is necessary to play. After many, many years it is still just cosmetics and a few buff and help items, but you won't ever need these items. Seeing how what people predict here never happened after years in ESO, I am not worried in the least.
---
With the success of their business plan there I can't possibly imagine that they would suddenly turn 180 degrees and make worse business decisions here. They know what works. They want to keep their players. They want to keep players in the game. That is how they make money in the long run.
---
Why does the atomic shop take all the cool stuff off and leave the boring stuff? Lol and why the fuck is everything 1950s backwoodsman themed. I'd pay real money for the merc troublemaker outfit and welding mask!
---
Yeah I'm not too alarmed, as they will come naturally in game. Just worrying about how far the promise of 'cosmetic only' can be broken...
---
Assassin's Creed odyssey, you don't need to buy the experience point booster.  Try playing without it though.  You get to run all the quests, the side quests, the daily quests and everything else to keep up level OR you can just buy the experience point doubler and you'll find that being in the sweet spot for experience is super easy.  
---
You can buy Praxis in Deus Ex, and if you want to see all the cool stuff in one playthrough you need to.  If you have enough time to play through the same game twice, you don't have too... but then you get to be super OP for the entire game which isn't really much fun.  Sweet spot is buying 3-5 Praxis, and its what the game is built around.  
---
Shadow of War pre patch, zones drop specific weapon types with specific weapon bonuses.  When you change zones, those bonuses no longer are nearly as useful requiring you to go out grinding for hours to get a new sword.. or you can buy a pack of weapons for gold and immediately go play and enjoy yourself.  You only get an hour a day to play?  Well enjoy getting beaten on by a half dozen orcs who are immune to your weapons effects.  BTW, you could kill them easily by spending 2 dollars...   
---
And those are both $60 games.  You don't  have to buy them, but plan on spending many extra hours on them doing pretty mundane tasks otherwise.  I don't have that kind of time anymore so I end up buying those items so I can just enjoy the damn game.  Studios can build a game around having something, then remove it and offer it in a microtransaction.  Its getting excessively common.  They make the game worse to get an extra few dollars.  
---
I did read the whole thing and if you read closely they say it is a NEW idea and a suggestion to see the response and ideas of the community as a whole and if most of the community likes this idea then they would stick to it until it does become annoying
---
It most certainly is, he is just gargling bethesda's balls and can't think clearly
---
You'd have to be a greedy f#@ktard.
---
"it's ok if companies lie to us, because they exist to make money". Nah. 
---
Dude... you‚Äôre wrong. Take the L. 
---
while I don't think that its a good idea to have these items in the atom shop, people were just saying a lot of "we should be able to get these in game" as if they didn't know we could, so I just thought I would toss that out there.
---
This is kind've like the adrenal reaction bug. They let it fester for arguably too long. I was hoping this would have been corrected with the last hot fix, but it seems like this is something we're going to live with until at least next patch.
---
The thing about the lunch boxes was they had things that sounded like damage boosts which since it was in the code nothing said if that was only towards ai or to players too so it created a problem but this isn't a problem simply because the better ones aren't able to be bought and the ones that can be bought might be pretty cheap
---
Yeah unfortunately I'm on PC so my only option would be to buy another copy of the game.  Which is obviously unacceptable considering my account should not have been suspended in the first place.  Appreciate you taking the time to respond though brother and best of luck to you.
---
&gt; Well pay to be lazy and pay to win are the same, your wrong
---
No it isn't. 
---
Pay to win would be getting a gun better than what you can obtain in game.
---
Pay to be lazy means that you can avoid material grinding for super hard to get mats like ultracite and flux.
---
You get nothing better with the kit than you can get in game. You just get to be lazier than other players.
---
The ability to be lazy is not a competitive advantage.
---
Why can we just craft these? 
---
They haven't given ANY DLC yet, actually. Many of these months were just fixing bugs that should have been fixed before launch. And yes, this is paying for an advantage, that's p2w. 
---
R u kidding me, I thought u won't go into this direction after all of shit the game received, wtf....
---
i just explained that. if your main weapon most likely your best weapon breaks these kits will instantly repair them when used. meaning the back up weapon which is at least on my character a lesser weapon less dps legendaries that are not as good. you could in theory repair the better weapon so you don't lose damage. 
---
plus you could just not carry a back up weapon. which means less carry weight.
---
I love how the most obvious shit that should've been caught during QA has to be pointed out nearly six months after release because they are still testing the game. And using paying customers for free labor to do it with.
---
It is if you repair a gun mid battle against someone
---
See ya
---
No.  The definition of P2W has been so diluted that when most people say it it's meaningless now.  I've seen people say that being able to buy cosmetics is P2W.  This really needs to stop.
---
P2W is when you can buy an advantage that cannot be obtained for free, and it has to be a significant enough advantage that it either a) will make it significantly more difficult for someone to defeat you in player-vs-player combat, or b) significantly reduces the difficulty of a pve encounter.
---
There are games with real P2W where you can buy a robot that allows you to fly across the battlefield near one-shotting players who haven't paid, players who can never even get a similarly powerful robot without paying no matter how much they farm.  That's pay-2-win, not this piddly "pay-2-get it sooner" shit.
---
Well good news, now you can buy 100% repair kids and use those perks for damage upgrades. That's p2w. 
---
First, fix the items that break far too quickly.
---
Second, what's next...booster kits or mods to make the energy weapons better?  A different magical Unicorn Mode where all bugs are fixed, but it'll cost ya?
---
Did you guys think it could just be slid right in and nobody would notice??
---
/duh
---
Feel your feelings, but let's not encourage spam.
---
Yeah I have Marsupial, Unstable Iso, Electrically Charged, Adrenal Reaction, Chameleon, Carnivore, Speed Demon, Plague Walker. But I don't really see the point in making them for 300ea. The market has them if you ask.
---
From 0 to 100
---
It's a very gray in my opinion, we will have to see when they are released
---
Hey OP, when you say ‚Äúboycott the atomic shop,‚Äù do you mean don‚Äôt buy any atom or don‚Äôt buy anything in the shop with atom?
---
does it really matter what i call it. anti- or pro no pay 2 win. it just means i do not think pay 2 win is a good idea.
---
8.2k
---
It's not a particularly good paytowin tool, but it is one. And assuming that the repair kit available through the gameplay is in any way dictated by RNG, that is not going to be all that easy to get. I am not saying this is a game breaking mechanic, just that it is not great news for the direction they want to go in the monetization of this game. It makes the idea of Legendary Tokens, 50 for $50 seem closer to a potential reality than it did before. 
---
Also, just feel the need to point out, the last time they had weapon repair kits in a Fallout game, they weren't easy go make, but you could make them in game. So, that's kinda lame.
---
I would literally rather crash my bike face first into concrete covered in dog shit rather than tolerate the existence of Pay To Cheat in the video game world.
---
It's vile Evil despicable and never OK!!!
---
I'm against "pay to win" in any form.  While this isn't necessarily "pay to win," it is definitely paying RL cash or time invested in challenges in order to save time or bail yourself out of an unfortunate situation.  I don't like it.  
---
Now the thing that really burns my brahmin is I have to grind like mad for something completely cosmetic like sign letters, but I can't buy them in the atomic shop, and yet they have the nerve to start selling functional capabilities.  Bethesda, please think about that a moment.
---
and you will be in your pip-boy, stationary and dead.
---
That would make it a pay to die faster advantage.
---
In combat, you switch to your next weapon with the hot keys.
---
1 - Melee
---
2 - A Shotgun
---
3 - Rifle
---
4 - Automatic Handmade
---
I'm sorry but at this point I just don't see a problem.
---
Say you're in survival, grinding in a location, and you're having a really good day, but there's no weapon/armor repair shops around. Do you A) Move your camp to where you are (even though you've got it set up on a water spot/junk node/lead node/etc), B) fast travel away and repair your shit then walk back. OR C), toss  a hundred atoms or whatever at the game?  
---
Some people will choose option C, and those players are going to have an advantage over other players, if only purely in a "time spent playing compared to grinding for mats" sense. 
---
I know what you mean. It's not really a locked door but a powered keypad door. It's not tougher, but it's harder to pick. The only way to be sure is to store it until the invulnerability patch comes, but I want to be able to just use it. I'm also wishing for a little more immersion.
---
Let‚Äôs just say for arguments sake it‚Äôs offered in store only, in game you can crouch in a bush and be blended in giving an advantage, however that advantage can be obtained for free by simply completing in game challenges earning free atoms as can the repair kits be earned free 
---
Second point and this is the important one the microtransactions put money into Bethesda‚Äôs pocket which in turn means this game is financially viable for continued effort to pump out new dlc, shop stuff pay the electricity bill for the servers
---
Repair kits aren‚Äôt loot crates where a limited amount of people can drop 100‚Äôs of dollars a month into them, it‚Äôs a way to get some money flowing into the game to keep the lights on
---
Did you read far enough to get to the part where it says you can get better ones from playing the game for FREE? or the part where you get atoms for FREE? or the part where all the dlc content for this game is FREE?
---
Oh x01, it's only the mod. There's no plan for it yet.
---
You got the mod. When you get the mod it still says you need the flux even though you can apply it without. It confuses a lot of people.
---
I'm sorry but I honestly don't this it's this big of a deal. It's just one non-cosmetic thing in the Atoms Shop, I don't think it's ruining the game really. 
---
Or maybe I'm just too dead inside to care too much about this issue, idk.
---
Or maybe just make sure you go in with your gear over-repaired to begin with? Unless a dungeon takes all day to complete, your gear will probably endure for the duration that way.
---
My idea here would to not buy atoms or anything from the shop at all to show Bethesda that we will not put up with this.
---
When I'm on team, I never hear anyone on area. When I'm on area, I don't hear people on area 99% of the time. The system (for me at  least) is pretty much completely broken. 
---
Food spoils incredibly fast after patch. Refrigerator will be sold on Atom shop to slow down food spoiling. Coincidence? I THINK NOT. Unless the fridge plan is simply a new plan available in world and not in the Atom Shop, this is absolutely not cool.  
---
Revenue needs to be generated in order to keep things free such as DLC. We are talking about repair kits, not legendary weapons. Quit your complaining... I can't see a repair kit being more than 100-250 atoms each. How many of those do you earn in a few hours of playing this game? 
---
That‚Äôs pretty cool I didn‚Äôt know you could do that, how do you get the blueprints?
---
There are those who would argue that the child rape is worse.
---
It's not cheating if it's part of the game
---
More like soupy diarrhea .
---
Until you're able to buy more carry weight in the atom shop... ;)
---
Third person perspective, little red dot. Or put a mark on the center if your screen.
---
It takes getting used to, but you can still use the iron sights. If you go into third person you still get the targeting dot.
---
And to be honest I dont have a problem with the repair kit's themselves, its the other stuff mentioned that has me worried.
---
My hope is that they will listen to the feedback here and actually do something with it. Whether you're for or against these kinds of QoL changes.
---
My worry is about what comes next. They said they were looking into doing the same thing for other mechanics like refrigerators and ammo converters. These were things that were requested for better quality of life, not a purchasable shortcut.  I can‚Äôt get on a lot so I would rather spend what atoms I have on cosmetic items. 
---
So you on rn? I can meet up to pay you 
---
It's the fucking eververse from Destiny all over again.
---
Slipper slope from here on out
---
More like your loss, enjoy those micro transactions! lol 
---
That's all true. I think if there prices weren't wildly high in the store they would have a steady revenue. I know I'd buy 5 bucks of skins a month if they were a dollar each. As it is I never have and never will purchase atoms.

I use vats the back up if I should miss. But i trained myself to know where the center is. So I really don‚Äôt have a problem with free aim while chameleon 
---
What is it, out of curiosity?
---
Maybe they are looking for a atom sink. Kind of like what they did for caps and vendor plans, and now pvp where half the caps from a kill get vaporized.
---
I use it. And yes it's frustrating when your weapon disappears with you. Makes it difficult to be percise when aiming.

From a level 235, the climb to the top is better than the view. Don't rush it.
---
They drop at queen
---
Yeah, it's not going to be a QoL addition, it's going to be a "we know you will pay for this" addition.
---
Nice try with the last second bid buddy I see you!
---
It‚Äôs yours.  Will message shortly for details to meet up 
---
I'd be interested in a discussion, but dictating what is right from the start is not the way to initiate one.
---
What makes anyone think that there wont be a stealth nerf to the durability or weapons and armor? It already appears to have occurred with food spoilage and your thirst and hunger bars all having been seemingly sped up.  Just slowly raise the amount of hits to durability over time and boom all of a sudden those repair kits start looking mighty tempting.
---
*cough* NCR ranger uniform *cough cough*
---
I'm cool either way. Just glad I got my armor finally done. The shocks are all I need now to make it complete, well that and reactive plates to swap in when needed. 
---
Not terrible! Keep drawing! :)
---
Something that will never happen, but let's entertain it anyway: You would still be able to get it for free.
---
I have a suspicion about this. It may be just wild speculation but... what do most enemies carry? Rifles. If you‚Äôre out scavenging for caps you can load up on 50 rifles from Westtek and go hit every vendor in one go. Melee weapons have nowhere near the same value (I‚Äôve sold found rifles worth close to 100 caps *to the vendor*)
---
So it‚Äôs to limit easy cap farming.
---
Probably not actually true, just a shower thought I had last week
---
You are my new hero. They were exactly where you said they'd be. Although I got a who lotta nothing for completing the quest it still feels good to have that one scratched off my list. If you need help with anything let me know.
---
I don't see why everyone is getting angry at Bethesda. You can find repair kits and maybe even buy them from some vendors or craft them. Just like some of the outfits, you can find them in the game or buy them. I can see that really serious people would buy repair kits but I can see that most people won't be affected by it being in the store. 
---
Puts me out of a job as a repairman as well.
---
My bad I thought you were OP when I originally replied. 
---
And it seems like people are misinterpreting the statement. If you read it closely it only mentions adding the repair kit to the atomic shop. It says that they are looking to add more community ideas. No where does it say those ideas will be in the atomic shop. This first one just happens to be in it. People are making something out if literally nothing. They are grasping at straws just like every update. They just wanna rise up. 
---
Honestly, I used to respond hard negative to posts like this.
---
BUT at this point since so many players have God builds, mostly from duped items.
---
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE? Let the dupers back in. (Hillary cackle).
---
a pet system that would allow a SUPER limited autoloot, if you ever played warframe think kuburows that only hunted 1 specific item (like you could set it to .38 ammo, and it would go loot the .38 ammo that nearby corpses had)
---
I'll admit it's not a cosmetic item, but I'd like to support Bethesda and keep getting new content for free. 
---
Should be extended 2 hours.
---
I'm r/outoftheloop can you fill me in on the Unstoppables thing you mentioned?
---
[ODER] 
---
Bethesda already promised that this game will never be ‚Äúplay to win‚Äù in which a lot of us agree with. To many games go bad because some douche kid gets his parents card and buys gear that gives them an edge vs. earning it. If the game is really to hard to play for people and they don‚Äôt enjoy it because they can‚Äôt just spend real life currency on items. Then go find a game that supports that. It‚Äôs dumb logic and several lawsuits are already being processed about loot boxes and such. It promotes underaged gambling and doesn‚Äôt actually purpose a value toward currency. A lot of companies are choosing not to go that route because of these lawsuits. I‚Äôd much rather die to a person who has earned their way vs. some dumbass kid that doesn‚Äôt know how to earn a single thing in life. 
---
I have a stealth rifle build and the guy probably had sentinel if you didn‚Äôt do anything to him I have combat armor all chameleon and extra sneak and carry weight 
---
&gt;Plus... no one is talking about the new Dungeon!??!?!? Follow previous BoS Teams in "follow in the footsteps of the Brotherhood of Steel who sent their own forces into the darkness and muck below Harper‚Äôs Ferry for mysterious reasons. We‚Äôll share more details about The Burrows in next week‚Äôs Inside the Vault‚Äã"
---
I'm really stoked about this one because I love the BoS and Taggerdy is one of my favorite characters in the Appalachian wasteland, but it's hard to get a word in edgewise when shitbirds are constantly spamming their sonic attacks. Fortunately my tour of duty in the great meme war inured me to the inevitable abuse that will be heaped upon me for suggesting that perhaps the Todd man isn't as bad as he is purported to be.
---
Awww thanks, I drew this during study hall today. I think the subreddit needed some fan art. :3
---
Damn never thought of that as a trade but that‚Äôs a pretty great idea.. fallout 76 photographer..
---
We better establish some standard pricing pretty fast beforw these artsy boys start gouging prices lmao
---
You're a bootlicker if you don't care that a company went back on one of their biggest promises.
---
I don‚Äôt disagree on the cost aspects they are a little high, but again Bethesda is a business and they bet in the person that wants everything now, I‚Äôve bought atoms and I have no issue with doing it again knowing it supports the life of this game
---
&gt;Their thumbnails all have giant red arrows pointing at a picture of frowning Vault Boy with giant red letters spelling 'Fallout 76 Going Pay To Win???' and 'Bethesda Breaks Another Promise!!!'.
---
I agree. That's just 90% of bad review videos image... 
---
It's okay to have a different opinion on this. My standard for defining "pay-2-win" isn't "can a free player not do this"but rather "can you pay to impact game play"
---
Hell, I play Elderscrolls Online a TON and while a majority of the stuff you buy is cosmetic, there are things you can buy that impact gameplay. It's been years going and very established so when they charge for stuff like Vampire/werewolf/cures it makes it P2W, but not in a way I mind. (worst example in ESO is the Banker minion. It's $50, I bought it, and holy shit it's changed the way I played the game. No way to get it without paying) 
---
Charging for repair packs in 76 isn't significant, and if they stopped there it probably would be fine. But by selling them it absolutely does make the game P2W. The game isn't bad and the P2W doesn't make the game worse, but it has P2W mechanisms. 
---
So it's okay to not let repair packs bother you. But it bothers many of us because it does mean that the threshold of "can money buy game mechanics" will have been crossed and likely will never be uncrossed. 
---
Maybe I'll post my fan cover for the game here too, soon. My "model" pic seemed to go over well haha
---
What acc happened in the last bit of the trade?
---
Just do it ...... shit sorry wrong brand
---
Dont care. As long as atoms can still be earned ingame, I see no problem with it. 
---
How is it like Eververse? That cash shop is cosmetics only as well. 
---
You know a lot of people on this subreddit asked for this specific thing, repair kits like they had in New Vegas. Then when Bethesda announces they‚Äôre releasing them and asks for input and advice on how it should be available everyone gets all worked up and talks about quitting the game, even though we all know you won‚Äôt. It‚Äôs so childish, just give your ideas on how it should be implemented but don‚Äôt start this stupid hate train over theorizing about intentions and how it‚Äôs gonna ruin the game and that no one should play it. If this ruins it for you then stop playing.
---
I‚Äôm driving home will be on in an hour.  What‚Äôs your GT?
---
"Thoughts and prayers, don't forget about ME today"
---
I believe you mean pay to win. And this isn't that. And please feel free express yourself. 
---
How do I upvote more than once
---
What are you talking about?  You obviously didn't read my post if that was your takeaway.
---
Well even if they take them out so that they dint drop anymore they cant just remove them from people's inventory so it wouldn't solve anything. I disagree though. I think they need to introduce other legendary affects worth having like maybe your bullets have a 15% chance to cause bleed damage or something that way explosive isn't the only weapons everyone is using.
---
I just wanna say ESO has repair kits buff food exp buff etc in the cash store. They balance this by making in game items that are identical and better. Thus encouraging farming or supporting a crafter or you can cop out and get slightly less useful stuff for real money.
---
Well good on you for being somewhat rational, but understand that most people do not view it that way and would not pay that much for a game since "$60 is too high"
---
As for microtransactions being predatory and bad towards players, you have to take it game by game, some are and some are not, I think fo76 has thus far, and for the foreseeable future fallen in to the good, but, you cant really argue that its bad for the industry when it makes bank, like I said, protest with your wallet and your time if you do not like it
---
In what way is the ability to repair your weapons and/or armor during combat not a combat item? I don't think that this particular item is going to even make a ripple in the meta of the game. But I don't think that they are taking a step down a path that in the long run is going to lead to Fallout 76 being it's best self. 
---
Just make it so it's 75% reduced damage penalty and it applies to all things, not just players. If you want to play broke, then you're going to break all your weapons taking 50+ shots head shotting ghouls. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes
---
Food spoiling faster has been a player accusation that has not been backed up via datamining (to this date, to my knowledge.) A refrigerator has been asked for for a long time and I would be shocked if it were Atomic Shop, especially considering the fermenter (which essentially performs the reverse process) was completely free. Also, little information has been revealed about the repair kits: while wording points towards a single use purchase (for an undetermined cost I might say) it could very well be a recipe. You, and a large portion of this sub currently, are upset over something with very few details and something that is also subject to change, and these baseless accusations of pay to win are again, unfounded and overly dramatic. 
---
But we arent in full control. They took it upon themselves to try and balance the game. I was for the tse getting nerfed but not as much as it shouldve been. But they should have never messed with the demolition perk. They took too much stuff away and now trying a p2w deal? Like i said all it takes is one little thing to get through and they will keep trying to add more and more against the wishes of the players.
---
And that's how mobile gaming became what it is today...
---
You know Battlefront 2 you could play the game and get the lootboxes without paying a single cent. Still pay to win.
---
It's not because they don't force you to do it that this is fine.
---
Notice all those down votes? The try-hard fanbase is who I blame for all of this. They run around trying to silence anyone that has anything to say other than how great this train wreck of a game is. 
---
Fair enough. To me, it‚Äôs a minor part, but I can see how someone‚Äôs build might find it a more major part
---
haha thanks... Unfortunately, my attention to detail translates well in to C.A.M.P. building but not necessarily photography.
---
Weird! Where did it break down this time?
---
Confederate uniforms, because they're traitors to the union. ;P
---
I agree. Not necessarily with the "I'm quitting" stuff, because if everyone said they're gonna quit, they might as well just do it because fuck it, but constructive and strictly speaking out about stuff we want and don't want is useful. I'm proud of the community speaking up about this. 
---
It's a deal, my dude!
---
I'm level 30-something and my weapons break nonstop. Bethesda created a weapon-breaking issue that they are now proposing to solve through us paying them money. I'm upvoting your post and hope other people won't waste their money on Bethesda's lie.
---
My Playstation username is similar to my Reddit one, I'll be adding you soon!
---
I honestly don't have to repair that often to see a big benefit to using repair kits.  I mean unless I'm just being lazy and don't want to go to a workbench but not that big a deal.  Besides, repairing with weapon artisan is much better than any of the kits so sure, go for it whales üòÇ
---
That is a pretty jaded poll. 
---
True, but like many of these posts, I feel like *some* of the anger could be mitigated if they chose their wording better or simply separated the bit about atom shop repair kits and other camp suggestions.
---
It's hard not to think they will put the ammo bench or fridges up for atoms when they said that exact thing about the repair kits in the same paragraph.
---
My hope is, that this is all just misunderstanding and that they maybe release a statement clarifying exactly what is or isn't happening.
---
Get kids. They spend it for you.
---
Clearly you're using an alt account since it's almost two years old and has been used; you've probably been banned with your main one or just as likely this is an alt account by someone at Bethesda like all of the paid Twitter accounts that seem to love the news. GTFO loser.
---
How 
---
The opposite is true.  
---
First, as show by the original post, the actions of these individuals \_did\_ matter.  Those actions had tangible, real-world repercussions on the emotional well-being of another.   And this was not just because the other person was a special needs child.  Social interactions, whether positive or negative and regardless of media, \_always\_ have some degree of impact.
---
Second, people curtail their own behaviors when there are consequences, even if those consequences are just a hit to reputation.  The way a person behaves when they are anonymous or when there are no repercussions for their behavior -- such as how people treat strangers in online video games -- is the most honest representation of their personalities and morals.  The way you act online is \_more\_ representative of the kind of person you really are than anything you do in "real life".
---
That‚Äôs the one where you don‚Äôt move and whatnot?
---
Yeah I counted 20 rounds all sneak instigating and calmex with +10 damage while aiming and I could easily 60-70% clear his health but it just insta filled back to full. 
---
I‚Äôll keep looking for more options. 
---
Cool. I‚Äôll hold off on buying the starburst linoleum then.
---
If you go to top of the world train station and head south there is a lake which I found to be a good spot
---
Also the area northwest of posideon power plant seems to be good (specifically I like my camp right next to the farm)
---
Gear doesn't even last the entirety of a queen fight if it's over-repaired, so I'm doubtful. 
---
its not even P2Win at this point, its pay to keep playing and suffering through a game that was poorly built, poorly optimized, poorly planned, poorly executed and poorly tested. I hope this pile of garbage that only a masochist would play is NOT indicative of ES6, but at this point I'm not too optimistic.
---
Find a deposit on a recource you are in need of or commonly in need of and build there
---
Not only Bethesda, the fucking mods here need to do some actual god damned moderating. In every other major subreddit dedicated to a singular topic, the mods pick one post about a breaking subject (usually the first to address the issue, post a trailer, etc), give it their blessing, and delete all the redundant bullshit. 
---
Look, I get that people are upset, but having 80% of the front page of /r/fo76 dominated by repetitive posts about the same issue is fucking asinine.
---
Why are you all still holding onto hope for this game?
---
Over thereüëâ
---
As far as new content, stuff is being pushed back farther for them to force this thing on is. I read an article and it was stated the atom shop was to be used for cosmetic stuff only. Im all for introducing content into the game but to make non cosmetic items available in the atom store and not allowing the same item to be found in game contributes pay 2 win. 
---
Have you been to Taggerdy's camp? (non marked location) over by Lake Eloise (sp?) I thought that was such a neat place. Had some holo tapes and lore was great when I found it! I am excited to see what the ArkaPharma dungeon and this Burrows is all about!!
---
Much higher render distance, its a tweaked version of the engine that allows for multiplayer, much larger map, new lighting system ect...
---
 [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2a4GTCpUPyEsGCGYWyM6Q2/welcome-to-the-atomic-shop](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2a4GTCpUPyEsGCGYWyM6Q2/welcome-to-the-atomic-shop)   
---
No need for an archived page, the original is still live ;)
---
No, it's bad. You get to pay to unlock them.
---
Ptobably cos' theres much more happening all the time since its online and does have more little details compared to fo4
---
Well fuck. Thanks.
---
I'd rather not have more companies follow the Warframe model.
---
It's either grind a lot or pay to skip the grind. This is from the 'Platinum' page:
---
&gt; **Platinum**  an be used to purchase [warframes](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Warframes), [weapons](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Weapons), [equipment](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment), [sentinels](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Sentinels), [mod](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Mod) packs,¬†and other various items from the in-game [Market](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Market). It can also be used to instantly finish crafting wanted items in the [Foundry](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Foundry).  With platinum, the grind to obtain weapon and warframe blueprints and their resources is circumvented. 
---
Then there's these packs [https://www.warframe.com/prime-access](https://www.warframe.com/prime-access)
---
Would you really like to see more of this?
---
**IT DOESN‚ÄôT MEAN THEY WILL BE THE FUCKIG ATOMIC SHOP!!!** Why does EVERYONE keep saying this ffs!!! Nothing in that wording means it will specifically be Atomic Shop and this post is completely baseless! 
---
I have to agree with this. Maybe my tastes just don't match those of the artists employed by BGS but I've been looking in the Atom Shop all the time, just LOOKING for something super cool to spend money on. And I understand some of the zany items are amusing for some people; the wasteland is a silly place. But can I get something sleek, practical and mysterious? Or maybe don't put that cool hot rod edm discotheque power armor on display for a limited time. I would spend money if they would give me some serious options. Or hell, I'd pay more if their character editor let me look actually muscular. Max muscular just makes you look average in this game.
---
Anyway, better cosmetics would be better than pay-to-repair-quick. 
---
Yeah earlier fallouts you could reload so doing things fast (with no lag) was fine, you could always revert to an earlier save too. It takes some getting used to. I wait until the item sells before selling the next. You have to be careful to when switching cards too. The r and t are right next to each other, end up dropping an item instead of going to the perks menu.
---
This isn't a pay-to-win item, it's a time saving one, though admittedly it's not cosmetic.  Bethesda can change their minds, this wasn't a promise sealed in blood. Besides, most of the people complaining probably have even bought any Atoms, so what is their issue?
---
Yeah, I found a full set of assassin sentinel armor, a full set of bolstering armor, three legendary 2 shot explosive weapons, including the handmade rifle, three legendary bloodied weapons, all with the best secondary modifiers.
---
I earned them all, just lucky  I guess.
---
I found all of this within the first 2 months of beta launch.
---
Oh yeah that sux man, honestly I think with auctions if it‚Äôs between 2 people then the second highest bidder should get a chance to counter offer once after the bidding closes. Then if the other person matches or bids higher it‚Äôs done. I‚Äôve been in too many auctions where someone posts right at the last second and the OP doesn‚Äôt let me counter bid even tho I had the highest bid for like 30 minutes. GG tho kinda sucks how the reddit karma system works sometimes.
---
acting like manchildren isn't the way to go.
---
Well, why the F aren't they fixing the other majorly broken things in the game instead of taking game chems to stay up all night and think of ways of monetize the game...you know like fix the gear that breaks after a few uses instead of selling you the stuff to fix it....and then making it look like we asked for it so they delivered.  Next will be 2000 atoms to stop your food from spoiling....or they could tweak a number to make it realistic instead in-game.
---
Kinda makes you wonder if they leave stuff in the game purposely broken but due to a miracle they have fixes on the Atomic Shop.
---
That's a partial list of why people are pissed.
---
I wouldn't mind buying them if the prices were adjusted, but I can't make myself buy a single $20.00 powerarmor skin. There's all sorts of cool stuff to buy and I'm sure they plan on releasing all of the FO4 assets eventually and I would definitely buy alot of them for a dollar or two each.
---
Basic repair toolkit = get new players to spend
---
Advanced repair toolkit = keep the present players longer
---
Seems like a retention plan Bethesda ;)
---
Watch a Scorchbeast Queen battle and you'll understand.
---
But mainly, it has to deal with 24(-ish) other players running around, and while individual assets are comparable to Fallout 4, the overworld contains many spaces that would have been separate loads in Fallout 4.  Here, many interiors are seamless with the exteriors, and there's some overhead for that.
---
I was so confused for a second. I was all...plans? I don't have them!
---
Selling solutions to issues with the in game economy creates a conflict of interest and should not be done.  They literally would lose money selling repair kits if they improved the repair mechanic in game.  Not a good move for the game at all.
---
Cool yeah my GT ATXlien just shoot me a message saying like ‚Äúreddit‚Äù on there and I‚Äôll boot the box up and buy it boss 
---
I could ask him, but I doubt he kept notes. I think you‚Äôd never really use vats with Teslas but could be wrong. Personally I only use Tesla‚Äôs as a ‚Äòtagging weapon‚Äô during legendary runs with other players, so I really only needed it as a tickle weapon. 
---
My friend keeps tweaking his build so I‚Äôm not sure exactly his combo, but he liked the Tesla for counteracting some armors in pvp. 
---
The main issue most people have is that on day 1 of this games reveal we were told and promised it was ‚Äúcosmetic only‚Äù and what they‚Äôre doung now is going back on their words and testing the waters, because if this slides the atomic shop will most likely have other things than just cosmetics and repair kits in the future. 
---
And a side point is that since weapon damage and armour damage threshhold scales with its durability/ health (stops at &lt;100%), it effectively does affect gameplay more, and for a trivial item that isn‚Äôt new to the Fallout franchise (Fo3 and FoNV had it, free may i say), its a bit of a spit in the face to those who paid full price of the game, see it literally go on sale the next day and then later break a promise.
---
Usually when people play without caps they're north of level 200. If they just capped the loss to 300 caps (ignoring bounties), I'm sure most people would probably find that limitation understandable but still rewarding.
---
I'm getting exhausted of all the BS about this game, having to stop playing it start to seem like a better choice.
---
Meanwhile I've found nothing of note and I play it for at least an hour everyday üòÇüò≠
---
This is the single aspect I will yield to, as it is true. I will continue to get irritated about these posts because most of them are pointless crap based on false convictions but I agree they serve their purpose  
---
I see what you did there
---
Good
---
They were mentioned in the same sentence. 
---
All very fairly stated. It is my own thing that it's so hard to wrap my head around a different version of it than I'm used to. This is a genuine learning experience of how slightly different generations of gamers have defined things slightly differently and neither is particularly wrong.
---
One of those rare moments where reddit has provided insight to a different view than mine that has expanded my understanding, even without changing my opinion. I had heard that could happen, but thought it was a myth... lol.
---
I am literally encouraging everyone else on this forum to make a post themselves and essentially bury this, soo...
---
I haven't played in a while. What do the repair kits do?
---
Interesting, that's really cool man.
---
Fair points, but I don't think there's an MMO out there with "just Cosmetic" items in the Shop. Don't get me wrong I am not excusing Bethesda, but I don't mind if they add utility items to Atomic shop. For me it crosses the line if someone gets an advantage over me for paying. In this case I repair my weapons to 200% and I don't see an advantage when I can find better items in the game. QOL however, I agree should never be paid for those enhancements just need to be made period. I guess you are then referencing the Ammo/Food/Re-fridge.... hmm.... 
---
For like a week if you wore any of the unstoppable outfits you and your team would get like 15 more hp. Not really much of a crazy controversy. This repair kit thing is much bigger 
---
That's the thing is people are getting mad at nothing. They be fabricated this future in their mind where you can buy a fridge in the game and they're applying it as if its happening now. Nothing is confirmed. Wait and see how it affects the game and then complain.
---
This community is so toxic and just latches onto an idea and rides it into the sunset not caring if the bring their favorite game down. Its sad that people only care about tearing something down rather than offering something constructive. 
---
I'd even be happy with different body models and poses instead of the stupidly ridiculous makes me wanna rip my eyes out ones, like the dipshit guy looking like he's show his butt and checking fingernails at the same time.......wtf
---
I triangulated between Harpers Ferry, Watoga and WhiteSprings and ended up just East of WestTek that way it keeps fast travel expenses down when doing sell runs.
---
I would then fast travel to Vault 76 for Flatwoods and Sutton Station to grab the Responders and Raiders vendors pools.
---
All that being said, they plan on getting a vendor of each type/pool at White Springs in a future patch so all of the logic above will be wiped out once that happens... It's not a bad view though if you build near the cliff.
---
If you're on PC swing by and check out my camp. MatchesMalone
---
Thats a quality plot twist. 
---
If I don't have to farm for items to make repair kits because I can buy them outright that makes it P2W. 
---
Well...this post took a turn.. 
---
One of the talking points in the release of the game was how the atom store would only ever have cosmetic item. This them breaking that assurance to see how far they can push us.
---
It seems camps have a sort of spawn timer, and depending on size and placement of the building, it could cover the spawn point
---
Yeah I wish there was. Be nice to craft a full set without having mods (like emergency protocols weighs 4) in the bank.
---
The problem with U/S gear is that pretty much no one will sell it for caps, so you have to _have_ good gear to _get_ it. 
---
&gt;But you just agreed you can get the currency in game. Therefore it's not pay to win since you don't have to pay, no?  
---
Oh right glad you summed it up like that, I cant wait to buy Caps in the atom shop, or a TSE shotgun, but its ok guys cus I just drank 5000 beers to get the atoms for it
---
Try logging out and back in.  Twice I contracted the disease from breathing smoke in the Ash Heap and it did not give me challenge credit, but I noticed after logging in and out a few times while the disease was still active, it counted for the challenge.
---
So if you have 2 players both with weapons and armor at 50% durability.  One player can use a repair kit to go to 150%, increasing their damage and dr.  The other doesn't have a repair kit because they didn't want to spend atoms.  
---
The player above now has a competitive advantage.  Not only did the player with the repair kit get an immediate and instant bonus to DR/DMG, they also saved all the time necessary to farm ballistic fiber and other mats to repair their gear meaning they spend more time doing other activities like getting XP, killing legendary enemies, completing quests, and otherwise advancing faster gaining levels and items faster than the guy who needs to devote even a small % of their time to farming mats so they can repair their gear "the old fashioned way".  
---
How is all of the above not a competitive advantage for the player spending atoms on repair kits?
---
In some sense it can be p2w, mostly due to the fact weapon damage and armour damage threshold scale with the actual health of the item, and with the nerf of white knight a couple patches ago, it doesn‚Äôt seem right at all...
---
Remember how upset y'all were when you could buy a costume that would give a slight boost for a limited period of time and were acting like it would doom the game?  And it didn't change anything at all?  And don't give me the "but they promised!" bullshit, nah read the comments you guys are acting like this will ruin the game and is grossly unfair.  That's what I'm calling out.
---
Right when you think this community is able to enjoy the game it has a meltdown over something stupid like this.  Weapon benches still exist, there's perk cards to improve the durability of your weapons, there's a bounty of aluminum, adhesive, screws, etc out in the world, you'll be able to get these repair kits for free just by killing things and exploring.  Your weapons will still be just as good as the idiots who are too lazy to farm materials so they give Bethesda even more money for kits.
---
Yeah ikr very annoyingüòÇ I suppose that's auctions tho, luck of the draw and yeah gg on the bidding üëç I've had to wait 2 mins to post this as wellü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
nobody in the industry is a fan of Bethesda. these posts are possibly all from industry.   
---
stop the repeat posts.   
---
Mods, do something about this pls.
---
When they explicitly state 'cosmetic items and items that give no advantage' then the implicit other possibilities can not include what has explicitly been prohibited.
---
It‚Äôs only really an issue for me if they silently nerf weapon/armor durability. Otherwise junk for repairs is plentiful as are work benches to repair items on. For PvE players, absolute non issue. For PvP players, I still don‚Äôt see much of an opportunity for this to affect a well prepared player, but I don‚Äôt PvP so I‚Äôll defer to the experts on that. 
---
But for me, it‚Äôs all about the silent durability nerf. I‚Äôll keep an eye out for any changes on that front, otherwise it seems this is much ado about nothing for me. 
---
Yeah. Because you don't have to buy them at all, like you said. You aren't even pushed to buy them. There's one popup when a new Prime Access is released, and it's on the front page of the game market, but otherwise, it's not pushed at you at all. 
---
you assuming the kit will pop in your inventory if you buy it, I would not bet on that.
---
Bethesda is talking about "unlocking" kit, like you buy the recipe. you will probably need to craft it before/
---
Besides, in you sc√©nario, I would probably jump to a station with the proper bench.
---
Agreed.  I didn't know about the perk issues you mentioned, but even without those, it's clear it's not anywhere close to Bloodied territory.
---
This. It doesn‚Äôt matter how grant the p2w factor is, it‚Äôs p2w nonetheless.
---
It starts with a kit. It‚Äôll end up with advanced Power Armor. 
---
Oh he just used a stim lmao or your lagging 
---
I guess I never believe these types of posts.
---
If it happened to me I would delete the game, restoring 20Gb of storage space and request a refund.
---
Ya, I won't use them either. Unless I get the 150% ones in game. But I can already repair everything (weapons, armor, pa) to 200%. I rarely break anything anymore. I really wish they would fix the Grognak repair bug first.  I can only repair that to 100%  
---
What I woukd really like would be plans to craft repair kites myself!!
---
I got used to it, but unless they fixedit, you used to be able to switch weapons and the new gun wasnt invisible 
---
Raider here..go to the Bethesda website..bwahah
---
...and you're not pushed to buy repair kits, either!
---
Please.... Completing challenges to earn trivial amounts of atoms every week can't honestly be considered a good way to buy stuff from the shop. Even if you log on every day and do all of the daily/weekly challenges I think you can earn a max of like what, 200-300 atoms? Anything that looks even remotely interesting in the shop is usually priced at like a thousand or more. 
---
Okay then I guess I understand why people are upset when you put it that way. Thank you!
---
Wait they delayed it?
---
Go to Bethesda‚Äôs website
---
Where are the weapon skins? Like get on it already. Don't hose your community with repair kits what a bunch of B/S!!!
---
On area settings, volume at max, I see the chat icon at the bottom of the screen, so it is definitely detecting speech and mic is doing something.
---
But I‚Äôm in mid 100 levels and have yet to encounter anyone who responds to my voice. No clue if anyone has ever heard my SOOTHING VOICE....
---
Sadly that won‚Äôt happen, after a bomb in sales there are a bunch of angry investors, after a bad launch there‚Äôs a bunch of angry gamers so with all the work that has to be done to just keep everyone happy cost a bunch of money which the atom store is hoping to make, that 20$ to some degree literally puts food on many peoples tables 
---
Why didn't you block him?
---
If this was adventure mode why did you attack back?
---
Why didnt you just leave the server as he said he wanted caps?
---
Well, it's exactly like you said until they drop the kits or they drop a clarifying statement all anyone has is speculation.
---
If what everyone here is saying will happen, I will be upset, if it doesn't happen, I will be happy, if some kinda middle ground, even better, I love the middle ground.
---
The current eververse is. When it was first announced and implemented in d1 they said it was cosmetic only, AMD that it would make future dlcs free, and shortly after there were xp boosting armors you could get. And you still had to pay for dlcs.
---
Now bungie spends more time making items for the eververse than they do making items that can be earned in game.
---
My analogy was more of the 'foot in the door' aspect. Bethesda does this, gets a lukewarm response, which will further embolden them to put more p2w style items in the Atomic shop.
---
I love this game, play it daily, but this is just a ploy I've seen before.
---
Why would they? It is bad business. They never did anything like that in ESO, which is their other large online game. Why would they make worse business decisions that work against themselves here? 
---
They already know there is no such thing as a stealth nerf in these times of datamining, it would be known the second it happened, and it would not gain them anything. Also, people enjoy the bonuses from items that are more than 100% repaired. Repairing at workbenches and the looted repair kits is vastly superior to the ones in the atom store. Why would people choose a worse method of repair? The atom store ones are for absolute emergencies at best. They will never become a standard since they don't provide the bonus the workbench-repair and looted kits do.
---
Why would you do that to me br√∂ther? *sad moth noises*
---
There are lootable ones. The better ones are loot only.
---
As long as there are enough idiots clicking on those videos. I mean seriously... who is still watching those youtubers? You could just as well stick your face into a toilet. Watching shit 24/7.
---
Idk dude--I don't LIKE the idea, but pay-to-win isn't the same as "pay to have a more convenient gaming experience." Pay-to-win means gaining a significant and crucial edge with physical money, where if you don't purchase the item, you have no chance against/compared to those who have. Atoms can be gained easily without cash and the repair kits/etc. will rarely, if ever, make the game playable vs. nonplayable.
---
I don't necessarily agree with the direction, but I also don't think they've gone back on their promises. Plus, there are a million other tangible reasons to hate the game (and counting).
---
I used to have this happen a lot by the fusion generator. I thought it was safe but I saw a dog half way through the wall biting it one day. Ended up putting spike trap on the other side and that stopped it (along with a shotgun turrent). Same with the flamers, if you wire them up all willy nilly they end up breaking themselves after shutdown. You have to keep messing around with the way they're wired until off is off.
---
Can't wait
---
I bought the unstoppables with cash because I had alreasy spent my earned atoms on camp items. But the unstoppables were the first skins or costumes I had ever seen in the shop that were worth spending money on. Apparently there were two cool power armors I missed. But I would spend another 40 bucks easy if they had anything good. I'm not motivated to buy summer dresses and weird floppy hats and whatnot. Some people are, but I feel like most of their items are just off the mark.
---
I'll be first in line to conplain if they start offering Stat boosts or special atom shop only weapons.
---
Unless you stop to check you won't know what condition your weapon is in. Hot key use will probably work, but if your weapon breaks during combat you'll still probably have to select it from the menu in order to use the kit. It doesn't change combat on a fight per fight basis.
---
Come now.
---
A "great idea" would be player greenhouses.  Refrigerators.  A lock on selling favorites goods.

A "great idea" is not a paid workaround for a system that already exists.
---
This...
---
&gt;I know this has been said
---
....
---
&gt;posts anyway, adding to the 60+ fucking psots about the topic already cluttering the page
---
That's exactly what I'm assuming, because I find it to be  _highly_ unlikely they will sell this as a single-time expense. 
---
It's literally in the same paragraph. 
---
They nerfed White Knight and now are selling you repair kits. Follow along. 
---
I feel it needs to be released then we can collaborate and figure out their best fit. Hell lots of things have left the atomic shop. People need to just calm down and smoke some more weed.
---
That youtubers you hate so much will force bethesda to change this due to how much attention they bring.
---
Im just spending it all lol. Have soon spent more caps in a week than I have in my entire playtime haha.
---
&gt; This isn't a pay-to-win item, it's a time saving one,
---
This logic can extend to literally anything. EXP boosts are just time saving items. Selling end level gear tokens are just a time saving items. Literally everything in the game is a timesink, so you can sell them on the atom store and it's time saving. That is illogical, this gives a direct player advantage for real money. 
---
&gt; Bethesda can change their minds, this wasn't a promise sealed in blood.
---
Ok? They said something and it was a lie, I don't know about you but I'm not exactly lining up to support liars. 
---
&gt; most of the people complaining probably have even bought any Atoms, so what is their issue?
---
Have you seen restaurants in the news that serve bad food that makes people sick or have known rodent infestations and still serve food? You haven't actually bought any food from that restaurant but you are still able to deduce it's a shitty move and have an opinion about it, right? 
---
If Reddit, Twitter, and other social outlets are a good indicator,  they're getting a healthy dose of feedback on this one ;)
---
I get the complaint about duping, but anyone that knows the game mechanics can make a competitive budget build with a pretty low bar for farming gear. Sure, the high tier stuff is great, but 90% of the benefit you get from that gear is in the first star. 
---
If you're playing caps poor intentionally, you're a POS. If you're playing caps poor because you keep getting wrecked, then asking you sit out a day and just play on adventure until your vender cap pools refresh imposing too much restriction
---
Yes! Exactly! I‚Äôd buy all that stuff with atoms (even with real money if I think it‚Äôs worth it to me)
---
Items which give any actual advantage to play should never be available for purchase with real-world $.   
---
It quickly leads to a game which is not enjoyable to play for those of use without the funds to spend.   
---
At this point I don't give a shit about player vending machines if it means P2W will be implemented. 
---

It could be, but I am a glass half full guy. I prefer to be positive rather than negative. 
---
Oh my god I think i lost brain cells reading that?
---
Also not to be rude, are you aware that weapon damage and armour damage threshold scale with its health? So if you keep popping a repair kit every once in a while, keeping it over 100% repaired you‚Äôll be doing max damage which wouldn‚Äôt be fair agaisnt others who don‚Äôt do that, along with it being such a tricial item that was free in Fo3 and FoNV.
---
Repair kits do affect gameplay to small degree, but yeah again most are upset due to the promise of cosmetic items only being broken.
---
I'd LOVE to support bethesda. Toss blackbird paint up as a permanent atom shop item and I'd toss money at it today..$5, say? Not the _fucking obscene_ $20 you'd have to spend to get it at their normal rates, but a reasonable price? Sure. 
---
THEN.DONT.PLAY. 
---
It‚Äôs literally that simple. 
---
Doesn't exist in survival. Bankruptcy debuff did not carry over AFAIK
---
Watch me bro.
---
I don't see it as pay to win / cheat, I think of it as just something you can buy to make it so you dont have to go to your camp or seek out a bench when you're exploring, if they made it so you earn Atom easier and didn't have to buy them it's not pay to win / cheat at all.
---
Yeah, that makes sense. 
---
Unfortunately assholes live in this world.
---
They are letting you rename things so that should help reduce the chance. I also have lost, a furious sighted damage gatling plasma.
---
I see the Repair Kit as existing in this nebulous gray area.
---
It is decidedly not a cosmetic item. But I also cannot see it transforming the game in any meaningful way given the prevalence of crafting stations throughout the map.  That they are offering a superior version outside of the shop as a reward makes it even murkier for me.
---
These Basic kits amount to "Pay to go faster" and that's a mechanism that I find perfectly acceptable in mobile games where using the in-game premium currency to accelerate actions is common.
---
But I do agree, this is a slippery slope that could easily lead toward more game-changing items becoming available for purchase. 
---
Nah I mean it full healed.  As in if I didn‚Äôt even hit him. You can see the health going up if you stim it‚Äôs slow and fills up. Either way. I‚Äôll look into a hybrid of chameleon and something to compliment it.

 Oh man i wish my dude wasn't out.

Makes sense, I'll refrain from making any judgements until they are out.
---

---

---
&gt;you are assuming the kit will pop in your inventory if you buy it, I would not bet on that.
---
I don't see why that's an illogical assumption.
---
Well, they are finally implementing stuff they probably wanted from the start. Fucking. Lame.
---
It is since you can earn atoms for free
---
Well, thank you for showing that you have very little reading comprehension. I don't know if you just add words as you read, or just jump to conclusions, but no, the sky is not falling Chicken Little. 
---
if minuscule stats like that is pay to win for you then i hope you dont lose any more brain cells. 
---
The mobile game genre is a joke, it's trash games that are just there so you aren't bored at work and *designed* to get you addicted and then drain your wallet. We're talking about real video games. Also, we're talking about repair kits, not buffs or extra content or any of the other things that would actually influence your experience to have an advantage over anyone else. And the battlefront fiasco you reference was a very unique situation where the $ to igc ratio was insanely disproportionate to the in game grind and we haven't seen anything like that since. I think this is all just getting blown out of proportion. Repair kits aren't pay to win and the atoms aren't hard to obtain.
---
"It just works", never believe what Todd Howard says.
---
Exactly! 
---
These kits are for emrgencies at best, the improved looted kits and the workbench-repairs provides so much better bonuses. But yes, the ability to craft a few emergency kits would be nice,
---
IMO, if they want more money, they need to take the Fasnacht Mounted Flag model and do a series on States, countries, etc.  I'd purchase a whole United Nations worth of flags.
---
Why would they promise a cosmetics only shop and start throwing utility items in? It also wouldn't need to be a "stealth nerf" in name.  Half the conversations I've seen regarding the food and hunger changes are framed as if they were a glitch or conflict with some other change implemented in a patch.  Still hasnt been fixed 3 patches later however.  Still no use in speculating on will it or wont it happen.  I just personally dont trust then not to be tempted to tweak the durability to sell more kits
---
Yep, till patch 9 in May. It was mentioned near the end of Inside the Vault
---
I really don't see how atom shop repair kits is considered pay-to-win.  Sure it can be helpful when fighting SBQ but PvP is a different story.  You're only as good as your aim/skill not the condition of your weapon.  Looking for a fight at 10% weapon durability is pure negligence.
---
That sucks
---
And you know things will break faster once there's a "fix" to buy. 
---
What? Are you sure about that? Because then that would make the mechanics highly unfair for players who can‚Äôt yet 200% repair their items, and I know for a fact that when I used to have a messed build, whenever my normal The Dragon decreased its durability, I saw the damage output would drop not significantly, but to a small degree (untill it broke ofc) Plus the Fallout wiki doesn‚Äôt state the 100% to 200% part so unless you can tell me where you got your info (genuinely intrigued) I can‚Äôt really take what you said in
---
Holy fuck you people are blind, it is 100% pay to win because it's the same method that other games have done. Stop apologising for shitty business practices.
---
Theres so much in this game it's crazy. I love it. And I understand there is a lot of shit that needs to be fixed, but it's not worth tearing down one of my favorite games over. Fortunately I have other things to play right now like the division 2 and I just got the handsome jack collection on sale for $15 on xbox today so I'm running through borderlands 2 again.

Everyone has wanted repair kits since Fallout 4.
---
Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôve already got more than the guy who says you can wear a repair kit ;)
---
It needs to be vastly heard
---
Honest question for the OP - if this is, in your words, a small time change and not worth the controversy, why all the outrage (from the community and whatever level of frustration from you). I keep seeing people saying it‚Äôs a slippery slope, but I don‚Äôt know that Bethesda has done enough to warrant outrage regarding the addition of these types of items to the shop - yet. 
---
I like to be informed, so I ask questions. I would sincerely like to understand your reasoning OP before I make a decision. Thanks in advance for being civil. 
---
Slippery slope argument and while not impossible, it seems highly unlikely on the "gear tokens" part. I'm not sure exp boosting items would be bad, so long as they'd have a version in game as well. 
---
That said, if you don't want to support them, you can choose not to play. Though please feel free to discuss the topic here, though be polite. 
---
They didn't promise cosmetics only. Just check the interview with Todd from June 2018. What they promised was a focus on cosmetics and no pay2win. I would hardly say that a worse typ of repair that gives less bonuses than the other two repair-modes is p2w. 
---
I agree so heavily with this. You run around at 0 caps, you risk nothing (aside from aid but that is a different issue) while the person running with any caps risks it all.
---
Just FYI, when you get these mods, they say you need stuff to install them, but you don't. Just press the button to install. The mod is a kit that already has it all included. For future reference... 
---
If they sold 2500 atoms per kit, then it's okay I guess.  Only the privileged  are dumb enough to purchase them.
---
Technically, they've done it a couple times with armor.
---
First time was back when they increased the Ballistic Fiber requirement.  It used to be that crafting new armor was cheaper than repairing old armor because it didn't require Ballistic Fiber in many cases.  This becomes a moot point as you accumulate Legendaries.
---
The second time was back when they nerfed White Knight, which used to reduce armor decay by 90% at Rank 3 and now operates at 60%.
---
I think somewhere along the line, weapons were affected too.  I don't remember it costing 12 Steel to fix a dinky Combat Knife, but it's been that way for a while now.
---
Unclear about the outrage. There have been items such as water purifiers and workbenches in the store for weeks. If you don‚Äôt want them, don‚Äôt buy them. 
---
Even if someone argues that these aren't pay to win, can't deny that Bethesda said things in the Atomic shop would be COSMETIC ONLY. Maybe you think repair kits don't offer a significant advantage, that's fine. Bethesda is setting dangerous precedent and may decide to go farther down a path of selling stuff that affects gameplay. We already know from leaks that they had plans for "lunch boxes." Perhaps in the future if bethesda sees that items like this are popular they might decide to add full on loot boxes to generate revenue. I don't like it.
---

---
Oh mercy absolutely, it's been open season since that Inside the Vault dropped and rightfully so. I feel that we as a community could do a better job proposing solutions instead of diatribes about how Bethesda has damned us all.
---
What's not to believe?  I literally included screenshots of the tickets I received from Bethesda.  My account was suspended because they claim I had 31k flux and 21k ultracite.  I then included screenshots of the dupers I killed that dropped those specific mats, as well as a screenshot showing that I threw those mats away.  All of this would be easily confirmed by Bethesda if their support took 2 minutes and looked into my ticket/account (which is the whole reason I made this post in the first place).

Come on, Bethesda used to be the best game studio out there, you made my holy Trinity of favorite games, fallout 3, fallout new vegas and Skyrim.
---
Now that you have the resources, the numbers and the technology to make massive, immersive games you start doing things like this. You managed to ruin your reputation in a year and you just keep ruining it more.
---
A lot of people have asked for it since Fallout 4, but to be honest they're not really useful to higher level players which makes up 80% of the player base.
---
I do agree on the cost of Atoms, though I've never bought any myself. I did get the Power Armor Edition, so I've definitely supported them.
---
Thanks I will give it a try
---
I don't know about Deus Ex, never played it, but I've heard conflicting opinions about the xp booster in AC:O, some saying they never felt a need for it, or that it makes the game too easy; and some saying you had to have it. I've played Shadow of War pre- and post-patch and didn't really see much of difference in the game and never felt a need to buy anything at any point. Weapons and Armor and New Orc Captains came pretty easily. I recall similar rumblings about the MTXs in Dead Space 3(you could buy loot boxes with crafting materials) and never felt any need for any of that either. I feel like a lot of people claim that they made this game slower or that game grindier unless you bought MTXs, but I just don't know if it's actually true because I've just never felt it and I honestly don't think people are being honest when they make the claims. Obviously the AC:O one has a directly comparable improvement with the buff on, but I think there's some bias at play when people think a game is tougher or grindier without the MTXs(although the same could probably be said for the opposite as well). The people complaining about them don't often use them and sometimes don't even play the games that they are complaining about. Personally, I just don't think it's as egregious as people claim, especially considering the amplification of the echo chamber effect that occurs on the internet.
---
If you've felt it occur in a game, then I don't think it's wrong to be wary. But I think it's unfair for the gaming community to judge every instance of MTXs and non-cosmetic things as wholly corrupt and evil and then come up with hyperbolic and intentionally extreme logical jumps that they know will never actually happen. The idea that they'll make item deteriorate faster is ridiculous to me and probably pretty easy to prove if it happens.
---
It was just an example, "time saving item" can literally be applied to anything because everything takes time to get. Obviously gear tokens are a stretch but again, just giving an example to prove my point. 
---
&gt; That said, if you don't want to support them, you can choose not to play. Though please feel free to discuss the topic here, though be polite.
---
For sure, same to you too - support what you want I have no hate for you for doing playing and even if you like and buy the repair kits, it causes no animosity from me. I think I'm being fairly polite in my discussions
---
This time I hope so, this needs as much negative press as possible, I was sold on a cosmetic only store which I wasnt happy about to begin with. This is unacceptable.
---
Shhhhh. üòâ
---
Sounds like you‚Äôre trying to speak for everyone here
---
And a long one, loot cool down on those desk is 72 hours at least, and I think more like 96 :(
---
Did you actually read the post they put out? Basic repair kits can be purchased in the atomic shop for now. The improved repair kits can be earned through activities like the SBQ. Then they say that it is a popular request and "we also felt we could try out something new with these, both in-game and in the atomic shop". It sounds to me like they are just seeing if anyone is interested in buying them for atoms. Simple solution, do not buy them and they will adjust accordingly. I know I won't be paying for them
---
Sorry to hear it - I havent had that experience yet, but I would have recorded the whole thing and reported the player

---
The reason I mentioned them is to say that it is inconsequential to the underlying argument that no item that provides a tangible benefit should be sold, as per Bethesda's promise for the Atom shop to be cosmetics only. So because the advanced version wouldn't be craftable, there would be a niche where the basic one provides a benefit that you couldn't otherwise get without paying money.
---
At least that's what I was trying to say. Frankly, at only 150% repair, I still don't see it being more useful than workbench with 3 intelligence for 200%, but it's the principle of the matter I'm arguing against. No game play benefits is a pretty black or white issue and there would definitely be benefits to purchasing the repair kits.
---
Why charisma?

By the way, how did you make walls without foundations? Or are those something else?
---
You buy something to skip a step in the games process that can be done naturally, if some weren‚Äôt so lazy to go look for junk...
---
Plus the weapon damage and armour damage threshold scales with its health, so these repair kits to a degree can be exploited in some sense.
---
Also these items aren‚Äôt new to rhe franchise (free im Fo3 and FoNV) and I think OP also may aiming at (or not, OP didn‚Äôt say it) but the atomic shop was promised to be cosmetic only, and repair kits aren‚Äôt cosmetic (except for one jackass who said you can wear them) so a lot of people are also just up in arms because of that.

---
Wouldnt you just then seek out the improved repair kit thru gameplay ? I get the anger but I think its a non-issue since most people are going to want the improved model over the basic model and the people who are going to want these items MORE (end game players) will be in a position to farm the improved one.. wont they ?
---
Tried to before I bough the flux and it would still not let me. Otherwise I wouldent have bothered. All good tho. 
---
Thank you for a well thought out post
---
I would not be surprised if a pay for stash room option comes along soon.
---
To be honest I would be mad for seeing so many of these post but this is true and needs to be stop before Bethesda goes to far.
---
Not everyone uses PC. Console players don‚Äôt have hot keys. 
---
You‚Äôll have to refresh my memory on the xp boosting armor. Was that in D1? I know some ghosts do that in D2. But even still, xp boosts at the level cap gave you motes in D1 and more loot boxes in D2, which (IMO) doesn‚Äôt really... scream p2w to me. 
---
&gt; Just bring more weapons.  
---
The fact that you have to provide a more inconvenient work around for players who don't buy repair kits from the Cash Shop demonstrates that the repair kits do provide a clear advantage over someone who didn't purchase them.
---
Imagine playing "survival" mode and watching an ill-prepared player who's armor is about to break only to have him instantly repair in the field without needing to search for an armor station. 
---
Stimpaks are essentially repair kits for your health bar. Do you not think that a person has an advantage over you by having a stimpak when you're forced to to use regular food to heal? 
---
I'm down with the repair kit plan sold in atom shop.  
---
The very first sentence of this post hits the nail right I. The head 
---
Because... Wasteland.
---
Seriously, though. Yeah, it happens. Nothing is safe. Best to store your decon shower unless you are prepared to have it destroyed this way.
---
He cant pay to win if you steal his wallet üëâüèªüòÅüëâüèª
---
Actually, I don't plan to ever buy any. But I like the option being there for people who can't invest as much time.
---
There are some people who just get enjoyment from ruining other people's fun.  Yes, those people are assholes, frame it as you like and bleat about mechanics all you want.  PvP is fine with me, it's the dicks who just want to chase tears that are asses.
---
The fact that it could be a plan or consumable is inconsequential to the root of the argument. Bethesda said there would be cosmetics only that provide no in-game benefits. There is no way to read the announcement that does not violate this promise except for your point 2, which I would have no argument with, but then why even include it in the shop. 
---
Right? I'm a huge fan of piano and play it myself and was disappointed by the lack of instruments. Also wish there was a way to manually play the piano lol
---
I think I'm echoing what's already been said, but the requirements for a single player game, versus a multiplayer game are substantially different.  But factoring in what everyone on the server can see, hear, interact with and then it starts to make sense there will be a lot more processing of information involved than for one p in ayer.
---
I'd love to spend my atoms but nothing has grabbed my attention fully yet. I bought a Jangles bandana cause it was only 50 atom and I like bandanas. I like stuff like that. I don't like 1400 atom power armor sets. 
---
Beautiful post XD, stay strong soldier!
---
Alright put down the crazy juice for a second
---
That would be a better situation but still not great at all.
---
Completely agree, I've just gone around upvoting every similar post. The actual sense of community strength is really nice to see.
---
Who‚Äôs looting so little and who‚Äôs gun breaks so fast that this is even necessary. 
---
I‚Äôve never had that issue before. I didn‚Äôt think the ghouls would be in range of the turrets. Every time I go towards the white spring that house is still always full of ghouls. Just server hop? 
---
I bought the game, time was, that was all the support a game dev needed. 
---
By that logic, so does every power weapon in the game. Selling TSE shotgun or whatever the newest meta is would just save "time" spent grinding for it.
---
Quality of life in addition to cosmetics. There it is, the line. It's not P2W, just pay to have fun. Pay to go faster. Pay to grind less.
---
It may not be P2W but it's where the slope gets slippery. How much paid QoL till the game becomes unplayable without it? There's a reason the line is at cosmetics.
---
Yeah, a "pro" would say get Unyielding Sentinel or Cavalier because they hit up online vendors for whatever they want.
---
In practical terms though, Unyielding tends to work better than Bolstering.  You get all those lovely bonuses to SPECIAL which benefit you one way or another.  Melee will hit harder, you'll have more Action Points to play with, etc.
---
The problem with Bolstering, and by extension Vanguard, is that DR/ER only gets you so far.  Colonel Gutsys cut right past it.  So do melee Scorched.  And in PvP, Anti-Armor gear speaks for itself.  If you're facing something that gets you down to low health in the first place, it's likely that Bolstering isn't going to save you.
---
You eventually come to realize that flat damage reduction is more valuable - whether that's the perks Lone Wanderer, Serendipity, Dodgy, or even all three.
---
Like, I'm not running hardcore Bloodied.  I keep my HP somewhere around 30% and wear Unyielding and a couple pieces of Unyielding Sentinel.  I can take the 20 or so high-leveled Scorched in Distinct Thunder on my own without breaking a sweat, even as bullets are going all over the place, because Serendipity and Dodgy are either reducing or outright preventing damage from ever happening in the first place.
---
I've bought $60 worth of Atoms I believe since the game went live.  
---
If I'm not mistaken they are people who got trapped in their suits, but I honestly don't remember if that was something actually in game or if that is just my head. 
---
True but if the atom sales go up then more stuff will be added after the ammo and camp upgrades so the game/devs will keep on adding and adding more pay to WIN features.
---
How about being told at E3 that the Atomic shop was for cosmetics only and now they spin a utility item into? Think thats also good? Because I see that as the bigger problem here imo
---
The EA sickness have finally have shown itself
---
The bigger issue is that gathering and crafting should be secondary, residual activities to "killing shit". 
---
The lack of content and predictable mob spawns makes the game boring....
---
I'd love to see this just to see all the mules getting re-specced
---
Nope, sorry. I primarily play adventure mode. And when I play survival who cares? It‚Äôs a repair kit for weapons and armor. Cry moar
---
Yes! I just want the damn double liberty spike mohawk cut from the older games. I get we're all super smart vault dwellers sent out to rebuild but I went a bit feral with a chainsaw and cannabalism.
---
No to repair kits for Atoms! 
---
This isn't play to win, it's a time saving item. I'll bet everyone would relax if they made the kits adventure mode only, not usable in survival  (pvp).
---
Oh right glad you used sarcasm instead of having a good debate.
---
But yeah, *how dare they* make you play a game to earn things. Next thing you know, they're going to want you to kill things and loot them in order to get items or some shit. 
---
Yes thats true. Im more focused on the way they worded the bit about future items. It seems like they are testing the waters to see if people will pay for the repair kits. The fridge, ammo/food converter, and courier system for scrap that they mentioned are all (like repair kits) QOL improvements but arent necessarily needed to succeed, and I can see them making them atomic shop only items if they have enough people purchasing repair kits.
---
My solution was pretty good. 
---
Make the plan cost 150 atoms. Easily attended with playing the game. 
---
Make the actual kit 300-500 atoms. Now people can have access to it either way. 
---
Make the crafted one require 4-5 different resources and slap some weight to the item. Reduce the amount of durability returned on use. Still keeping the weapons and armour bench in use. 
---
Make sure the advanced one is fair good of a drop from the queen and future bosses. 
---
Now you a best of both worlds moment and bobs your uncle. 
---
And then there was a white knight perk nerf... and now food spoils faster... and they mentioned fridges...?
---
[X-Files theme plays]
---
Still applies very noticeably to weapons like the ripper and mister handy blades.
---
Defiantly need more Fan art on this sub! Keep it up üòã
---
I don't think it was intentional...
---
A major pain, yes. 
---
Mas deserves his account back. Hunting down dupers and destroying their duped items should not result in a ban.
---
Do you remember the ghost people from the sierra madre? They're basically like that, except that you can actually kill them easier
---
Sadly, game development is a lot more expensive these days given the size and scope of most  AAA games.
---
Damn man, harsh all around.
---
I get flak for it, but genuinely I agree with both sides of the argument.
---
If this is how the benches and kits work we should be angry, but we should wait.
---
We should wait till they drop, but if they drop and it works exactly how all these people are interpreting it'll work, we should be angry.
---
It's like the B.E.T.A, game launch, survival beta.
---
You shouldn't be angry for issues with the B.E.T.A it's a beta
---
You should be angry that the game dropped with none of those issues fixed.
---
You shouldn't be angry about the announcement or even the beta for survival mode, because once again it is a beta.
---
If they drop the beta title and officially launch survival mode and it still has these reported issues then, yes you should be angry.
---
I have had tons of bugs and issue playing this so,
---
I was ready to jump on the hate when I read ITV and posts like OP, after reading more level headed responses it has cooled my head.
---
There are fights that go on way longer than expected and weapons can break. 
---
Maybe you're still hallucinating. Are we real? Are you? Is anything real at all?
---
Think of the repair kits as BGS testing the waters. It's a fast, slippery slope from "minor in-game items" to "all of the things" for more money. The slope is littered with increasingly more useful in-game items until a year or so has passed. At that point a new player with sufficient funds can buy in at level 50 with all of the legendary "abilities", a stash limit of 80k, SPECIAL at 65/65/65/65/65 and every perk card unlocked upon waking up in Vault 76. 
---
If the game's community doesn't squash P2W loudly and swiftly, the game will integrate it. 
---
they‚Äôre assholes for playing a game differently to you and using mechanics the devs intentionally added? grow up you muppet
---
That is some of the lore, so your head is right. Radiation caused them to mutate and get trapped in their suits. Whether it was a messed up ghoulification or something else is unknown. I have a feeling it has to do with some of the toxic fumes in the air around the ash heap. 
---
Ok.   One more thing to make me believe Bethesda are a bunch of morons. 
---
Why are not loot from dead enemies linked to the players level? 
---
I'm sick of killing high level enemies and getting legendary items that I can't use. 
---
MAKE LEGENDARY LOOT USABLE TO THE LEVEL OF THE PLAYER! !!!!!!
---
Sooo.... you didnt say what the messed up. What's the problem that you are referring to?
---
You sure are true Soldier. As part of the Enclave we salut you in being against this dirty communist propaganda known as a ‚ÄúAtomic shop Repair kit‚Äù
---
That sucks, man. Even with the evidence you've brought fourth I don't think anything will change. 
---
At this point it should be obvious that the system Bethesda uses to suspend people is going strictly off of people's inventory and not how they obtain them. Bethesda is approaching dupers through a "correlation leads to causation" approach, or that the "ends justify the means". 
---
Frankly, I'm fairly confident Bethesda knows they may have suspended non-dupers by accident, but if they haven't addressed it by now then I don't believe they ever will. Eventually everyone will be unsuspended, but till then I would recommend finding another game to pass by the time. 
---
In the (very arguable) case that this is actually true, _charge more for the games_ then. 
---
And also assuming a Sub on Reddit speaks for every player of this game.
---
There's a huge difference in buying a super weapon and fixing in game items.
---
As much as I would love to I think that it just drives their business up.
---
Thanks for your assessment. I appreciate the input. Very informative
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm going to name my weapons ‚ÄúDon‚ÄôtSellSupersledge‚Äù and ‚ÄúDon‚ÄôtSellRifle‚Äù and so on. But that still won‚Äôt stop where you accidentally hit the space bar too many times cause the game is laggy.  I‚Äôd like a way to make them not even show up on the list of items to sell like how legendaries don‚Äôt show up on the list of items to scrap. 
---
You'll never have to pay to win if you chose to not pay to lose! \*taps forehead\*
---
Is there anyone who supports it?
---
Thank you fpr the clarification. I guess I should trust my memory more. 
---
Potentially, though I'm assuming if you stop to use this in combat it'll give your opponent an easy headshot.
---
You sure are a true soldier fighting against this communist propaganda known as a ‚ÄúAtomic shop Repair kit‚Äù
---
As a member of the Enclave I salute you!
---
Take a quick scroll through the fo76 subreddit from today - will come clear very quickly 
---
Because they allow people to repair in the field without a repair station and (I assume) not have to use any junk items such as ballistic fiber. 
---
The fast travel restrictions on "survival" mode make this advantage even larger. If your weapon breaks while you're out in the middle of nowhere then you don't have to make the decision to fast travel back to your camp. You can just repair right there.
---
lol I never said they were scum to begin with, you did then I agreed because they are. The point is because it's clear you're not getting it or you're a griefer yourself, is that why should dbags be rewarded?
---
This has absolutely nothing to do with the point you are trying to make in your first post. You just seem to be upset at anything they do. 
---
I agree, but for some reason people don't like going past the $60 mark on games.
---
It still "just costs time." That is all it is saving in either case. You can grind to repair and you can grind for weapons. Someone who pays for all their repairs can convert that saved time to grinding for gear. In this one respect it's very much a zero sum game and if some people are able to get any advantage from paying money it is inherently unfair in a multiplayer game with PVP.
---
Last I recall fortnite was cosmetic only?
---
Bethesda: Hey! look at this new ballistic beer that increases your ranged weapons damage by 15%! but you have to pay for it with you weapon durability... or with atoms
---
Really 76 broke promises? jesus so now in addtion to nearly everyother label you can apply, it's also P2W?
---
What a shitshow.
---
Thats actually funny. Lol
---
Use a glitch and sneak into the Dev room
---
This is like the minor health boost from the unstoppables week all over again
---
Its coming out around the same day as the Ever Upwards quest. So player vending AND backpacks, woot
---
Free 8 scopper Mas!
---
So if these were adventure mode only, you'd be okay with them?
---
Thanks for the input. It really doesn't matter now since I can't afford the upgrades and will most likely just onsell it once I get it.
---
Repair kits only repair to 100%. Since the looted improved repair kits repair to 150% and workbenches can repair to 200% which in both cases gives bonuses to the items in addition to the better condition they are essentially a worse service for absolute emergencies. Nobosy will choose a worse method over a buffed and better method. 
---
Is it useful? Yes. Is the looted repair kits much better? Hell yeah! Are workbench-repair still superior? Damn right!!!
---
I like the idea
---
;-;
---
So are you going to complain if they start selling plans for weapons and armor to avoid RNG? At what point do you feel your accomplishments in the game diminished when someone else is able to do far more in less time because they paid for it?
---
The logic is that Bethesda promised the cash shop would be cosmetics-only. And we only get a certain number of atoms, so if people start spending on QOL items, they're going to have less for the cosmetics. And then there is the argument that this is a slippery slope and breaking one promise can lead to breaking many others.
---
There's are various angles of logic here. You might not agree, but even still, your point about getting it for 'free' doesn't in any way invalidate the points I'm making. :-p
---
Apparently, they loved chicken-fried steak.
---
While I agree the fact that they are not freely available in the world and can only be purchased ruins them
---
Find a steel or lead deposit to harvest. You can bulk the excess and sell to vendors or trade others with it. 
---
The stupid thing is there's cosmetics I'd buy if they existed but they don't, specially more weapon skins
---
This probably won't be seen, but the newest Inside the Vault said that the Basic repair kits would be in the Atom shop, but the Higher tiered one is a loot drop from enemies. Quoted:  
---
Not saying its okay, but at least the improved Kits are available as drops.
---
Not necessarily okay with them going back on their word. But all else equal it wouldn't affect me.
---
Have no idea man. While atomic shop is purely cosmetic atm, people still complain about how time limited sales is a bitch move or how expensive a skin is and so on. At this point, I'm starting to think whatever Bethesda do with atomic shop, people will never be satisfied. They be like, if you hate me for no reason, imma give you a reason to
---
Dickheads who play like that are welcome to join the Dayz community... That game will effectively crush their spirits and spit them out.
---
Here's my doubt though.  It's been six months.  The servers are still wonky and prone to spontaneous disconnects.  Players don't run silo/SBQ combo as it is, because the likelihood of getting kicked off and being unable to rejoin the server (where is that feature, btw, Bethesda?) is a very real and all-too-common possibility.
---
If they make the raids take just as long, only to promote degradation, the same thing will happen.  Once the newness wears off, players won't do them because it's a resource sink with little reward and a high chance you'll get absolutely nothing because you won't be able to complete it.
---
I'll always remember that moment when I saw 80% of my health bar replaced with radiation in a matter of seconds whenever a legendary raider that spawned with a minigun with radiation damage shot at me.
---
Yeah man. One thing I've been working on personally is thinking before I react. CBD fucking helps with that a lot. Lifes more fun when you enjoy things instead of hate things. 
---
They‚Äôre breaking their promise of cosmetic only items in the atom shop with repair kits and implying other QOL items that were suggested were going to end up the same way
---
I've played plenty of those games, and the cash shops have bothered me to various degrees. In the case of 76, I'm fine with the cash shop if they keep it cosmetics. If they don't, I'm not fine with it, because this game was launched in a poor state and they still have some months to go before that is corrected... so selling us QOL or any non-cosmetic item before then is shitty. 
---
If you don't agree, that's fine too. ;-)
---
Those are skins of the existing items. It'll still require plans to make at a CAMP. After that, then you can use those skins. These repair kits are functional and exist in the Atom shop only. The advanced versions will be available as drops albeit not a common drop.
---
Who hurt you?
---
I use my pitchfork üôÇ
---
Oh. Repair kits? If they are like 10 or 20 atoms then I'm fine with it because then you can get plenty just from playing the game and it's not pay to win. They seem useless anyway though, my stuff rarly break so I wont be getting any.
---
There's still time for them to realize this is not the direction they should go.  All they have to do is keep stuff like this off the Atomic Shop, and make sure it stays that way for future things too.
---
The inevitable backlash is already in progress, and it won't be long now until youtube morons start making their videos on it, then it'll have even more exposure.  That might happen, before, or after the release of this stuff, and I actually for once hope it happens before, because then it means Bethesda gets more pressure to make sure it doesn't go the way they planned.
---
If Bethesda really wants to up their Atomic Shop game, like you said, there are so many cosmetic items they could make.  We go nuts over new furniture items, and certain clothes. And I'm sure there are droves of people waiting for weapon paints and skins, they'd make a killing from those.
---
Yikes. It‚Äôs an accomplishment to repair your armor and weapons? When did that happen?
---
Everything is for sale with soft-currency. 
---
They already sell things for hard currency. If I didn‚Äôt stop playing the dozens of times I was booted during the beta I won‚Äôt cry over repair kits, sorry.
---
" That was your doing by A. Letting her play an M rated game"
---
I wonder how they make baby mole men, and why aren‚Äôt there mole woman....... unless it‚Äôs the mole rats they... nevemind
---
My thought was we would get an alien invasion dlc/event and the alien blaster is/was a tease. If nothing else it was deadly in FO4 and other games and needed to be nerfed pre Fo76 
---
...Kinda feel like we should have had a Megathread for this.
---
At least I'm certain this meets the post quota for an entry in 'Bethesda Plz'
---
LOL,   they are talking about it in the exact same section as they are talking about these repair kits.  what the hell are people supposed to think??
---
There's no debate to be had, this is a pay to win item being added into a shop where they explicitly promised there would be no such items.  
---
And if your gonna throw out a stupid response like "you can get the currency in game. Therefore it's not pay to win" then expect a stupid answer. If you justify this, especially by saying that, you are justifying literally **anything** going into the atom shop.  
---
Want a TSE weapon? 5000 atoms, but you *can* earn them in game so its not really p2w  
---
Want invincibility for the next hour? 20,000 atoms, but you *can* earn them in game so its not p2w  
---
And so on
---
It might be because this is a scavenging/survival game. So finding these resources is a core mechanic.  
---
Appreciate you taking the time to read my post.
---
I would understand the suspension if I had kept the materials and had them on me but like I stated repeatedly in my post, I threw away the items as soon as we got the dupers to switch servers.  If literally anyone at Bethesda hopped on my suspended account and checked, they'd see I not only don't have those duped materials on my account, but I don't have more than a couple hundred of any material in general on any character on my account.  The main reason I made this thread was to try to get ANYONE at Bethesda to confirm that I don't have any of those materials on my account and then to lift the suspension on my account.
---
I have a feeling at some point someone at Bethesda got on my account to delete duped materials/lift my suspension, couldn't find the materials (since as stated repeatedly I didn't keep any duped mats), and then just ignored my ticket and moved on to the next ticket in their list.
---
I mean they do enjoy blowing them.....up.
---
no sympathy.  should have given up on this turd of a game right after release like the rest of us.
---
You already selling them for cash online, right?
---
This is how it starts. In a year we could be seeing legendary items being sold on the Atom Store because it's "a great way to let people with less time, but some extra cash play more while supporting Bethesda financially."
---
Problem is not everyone defines pay to win the same way.  For certain a paid convenience, something that seems silly to spend anything of value on to me with repair points so prevalent.  Others, not so much.  In that regard, I‚Äôll never know if someone beat me because they were able to farm uninterrupted for X hours and got a lucky drop versus just a plain lucky drop walking around whitespring.
---
The week long promo unstoppable bonus was more pay to win than this is.  
---
I agree and disagree 
---
I agree with everything you say except that last bit.
---
I regularly play Dark souls 1-3+dlc and I hate loving and love hating that gameüòÇ
---
But really, you're right I've learned that its a lot of work to be angry
---
*insert Smashmouth meme*
---
Yeah I‚Äôm not too fussed either but I can understand people getting pissed off about it from a principles perspective.
---
At least for me, the significance is that Bethesda lied.
---
Great idea.
---
1-What is the relevense
---
2-You earn atom so unless your a camp junkie you might have so in store
---
3-Relevance? + Y do people want fridges, so the can store food for longer without it spoilingn They could get thur-hiker and the salted perk in luck and it would do the same thing. On 1 hand one lets you get this immediately and one can take 6 or so levels to get.
---
4-Not lazy, improving I've seen plenty of people wanting this just as much or maybe a little less than fridges. Their page say it was highly requested. Same as fridges so they Implemented it, like their gonna with fridges and if a majority of players want something and your sales are low you would put it in the game as well?
---
Hell yea hit me up I got 2 for $50 
---
I don't see either why the opposite would be less logical.   
---
again they talk about "unlocking" kit. And for now, every usable item in atom shop need to be crafted first.
---
In fact, we know nothing (jon snow).
---
I soiled my power armor I was so scared...
---
I and my friends wanted to buy f76 on the release of survival mode but when we heard that all the characters built on months of exploits can enter survival mode at will we lost all interest. This mode could be a blessing for Bethesda, a new start after a dreadful launch. Who the f make these stupid decisions? Why any new players would want to buy the game and get destroyed day 1 by max lvl godmode trolls camping by the vault? Survival mode is ruined on launch just like the original game mode. So much potential wasted. GL, have fun. I ain't joining this mess. 
---
Get in my belly.....
---
I also like the idea. I'll never buy them, because I can repair to 200% at my camp, but if it makes Bethesda more money, they will continue to support the game. 
---
I can see the server disconnect while someone is doing this and it uses the kit but doesn't fix the item already...lol
---
Until they stealth nerf repair perks/durability and pretend blind/deafness when all the posts about 'why is my repair stuff not working anymore' flood the reddit and other forums, just like they're currently ignoring all the posts about hunger/thirst/spoilage now.  
---
But they're "listening to the community"!
---
Burn in Gahenna Bethesda! In Gahenna!!! Argh!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
I hope, sure, but the thing is about as useless as a level 1 drill. Toning it down I'm fine with, but I'm wondering if I need a mod to make it not absolute trash or something. Maybe the long barrel.
---
I use an automatic laser rifle as part of my build and it's great. I'd just really like more options than red or green pew pews.
---
I guess I just don't care what people buy,  it's the same as buying a tse off Ebay.  You can buy repair kits, refrigerators, and ammo converters until your bank account is empty for all I care. 
---
Pay to wins been going on since the game came out.
---
Bethesda just wasn‚Äôt reaping the benefit.
---
To suggest that this somehow Destroys the integrity of the game is ridiculous.
---
The only reason i'm vocal about this is because i've been enjoying the game the last couple weeks, and have been liking the updates they've been posting.  This one is a turn in the wrong direction, and the inclusion of this stuff would result in me uninstalling again.  
---
Ahh, the 68 people have spoken! If we are talking the amount of hate posts, they should have shut down servers during beta. 
---
wrong
---
Feelsbadman
---
;w;
---
On that note, that's why it's so important to get involved with local politics. It's easier to make a difference, and all those little differences tend to trickle up. National Politicians always start in local politics.
---
Yes.... this!!!   I want a brick garage door to go with my Boston style brick building....
---
It‚Äôs testing the waters to see there‚Äôs a market for it. When they get money for repairing your shit, they‚Äôll drop weapons.
---
There are perks that make it really fast but yea armor
---
Is based on build and preferences because with a rifle build you have to kill before they see you because automatic always beats single fire 
---
Considering that I posted it less than 30 seconds  before you responded I dont think you read it so you arent worth arguing with. 
---
Am I the only one that isn‚Äôt surprised about this? Just ignore the darn repair kits they aren‚Äôt forcing you to buy them
---
Wow! That's a wholesome post. üòä
---
Yes, but not half and quarter sized versions.  My favorite is the light laminate floor for my dock in the water but the dark is growing on me for landings for the upper levels.
---
Check your PMs for a Dropbox link of everything I took. Great C.A.M.P. Build by the way!
---
Its probably like the railway rifle and not effected by perks
---
Thank you. I swear I've tried that before but maybe I'm wrong. 
---
Exactly this.  It's no different than not having to farm for a weapon or gear upgrade,  in this case it's just materials,  but you're still paying real world money for in game items.
---
The people down voting you hate that your right :)
---
Yeah you can get a decent chunk of atoms just by turning the game on. 
---
That's a lot of "if's" though, and personally, I don't give the aftermarket too much credit.
---
So how do I report a cheater in survival mode? If someone from Bethesda could point me in the right direction I have plenty of video proof of a cheater who is unable to die regardless of damage 
---
Awesome, thank you!!!
---
Well I'm sure your parents lied and said there was an easter bunny, Santa claus or haunaka harry, so I'm sure you'll be able to pull your vault tec suspenders up and wipe the tears from your face and move on
---
Just slash the base price of them, up the quality (drop the tacky recoloured suits) and have them available for a week or two, that way we'd spend our earned atoms, but what's left is cheap enough that we wouldn't think much of spending real money on it. If those outfits were at most a third of their current prices, I'd buy a few of them for sure. All I've ever payed for in the shop I payed for with earned atoms, which are easy to save because there's barely anything I want to buy anyway.
---
I mean you can support it by buying cosmetic items. You can already repair to 200% ingame with perks
---
People say that it's not that bad, yet if people start buying things like this then it'll show them it's okay to do more, similar things like it
---
I have 0 problem with the cosmetics system, but I payed for a full game and was told I'd not have to pay for more features. Don't want to head down the call of duty path
---
Arrrrghhhhh!!!!!!
---
You're aware u can get them from daily challenges and the improved one from events like sbq right? 
---
Like someone pointed out, camo paint for PA is too an advantage, not just repair kits. Not many people equip their PA torso with stealthbois so right camo in right environment make a meaningful difference. Heck, camo with steathbois gonna be so nice. Skins ain't just cosmetic if pvp is involved
---
Well said. I actually haven't read the article but I need to at some point. 
---
It is actually. *Without* the perks it does something like 10 or 15 damage. It's bizarre.
---
Yeah man I'm just now finding this out and its nice to be able to share it. üòÄ
---
\*Mind Blown\*    whoa dude
---
Oh no, The sky is falling!
---
Weapons repair kit
---
Not sure you fully thought through, say, PvP implications of stacking up on repair items in the field, but since I don't care about PvP, I'll let that go.
---
Fact is, this proposal sets a slippery slope precedent for other non-cosmetic items farther down the road, item types that can't be easily rationalized as 100% non-impacting utility items. That's why folks are doubling down. I'm not ready to liken Bethesda to EA, but isn't helping the former's PR either.
---
Bottom line: I have no problem paying gobs of real world caps for cosmetic items in the Atomic Shop, and thus fund continual content. *Cosmetic*.
---
HEAR HEAR! 
---
Respec a lvl 2?
---
Haha so funny haha coffee joke haha
---
I can‚Äôt wait to feel the joy of that shotgun that just broke in that clearly homicidal vault dweller‚Äôs hands üòÄ
---
They're assholes for getting kicks out of other people's misery.  I guess you're one of them which is why you don't understand.  Well, some day someone is going to stab you in the throat for what you think is no reason. It'll be because you've been an asshole all your life.
---
Arrrrrghhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
---
So your question is why all the outrage and what has Bethesda done to warrant the outrage given.
---
So yes, as you said, I think this is a small change and that we as a community are overreacting to the addition of a box, which in one way is true: the addition of a repair box for atoms likely won‚Äôt affect our gameplay much if at all.
---
The issue that does warrant the outrage is twofold: 
---
1. Many gaming companies are moving into micro transaction system that is or heavily borders p2w even those that originally said they wouldn‚Äôt.
---
2. Bethesda made a promise to the fans prior to the release of the game, and at E3, that it would not feature anything that would give a player an advantage and would be purely cosmetics.
---
I think point 2 speaks for itself, but your question is what has Bethesda done that would warrant our attitudes or *fears* about the change:
---
They actually did break this promise earlier, during the unstoppables event, for each player on a team wearing a different super costume a bonus was given to each member. While a few of the costumes were attainable in game, to obtain the maximum bonus: atoms would need to be spent. 
---
From my own perspective at the time, I did not think this was a huge problem, it did break the promise but did so in such a lenient way, that I forgave it and even (I apologize to them) belittled the same people who forewarned to me and to others that Bethesda would only escalate this change in policy if there wasn‚Äôt outrage. 
---
I didn‚Äôt believe them, today I found out I was wrong, the unstoppables event was a tip of a toe, the current repair box release is a full toe.
---
We need to show our feelings about this now before it escalates even further in ways I don‚Äôt even want to think about but as another piece of evidence data miners have already found ‚ÄúVault Tech Lunchboxes‚Äù that many believe to be a early form of a lootbox. This could very well be cosmetics in a box, but given the changing climate I believe that it‚Äôs fair to be worried about it.
---
Now again, your question was what has Bethesda done, but after what I presented to you, what has Bethesda done to make you think they wouldn‚Äôt do what every other major AAA company has done? From 343, to Bungie, to Jagex, there is a clear pattern here, and Bethesda has broken a promise to us today or even earlier depending on your opinion.
---
This is my answer, some others may also want to leave their input too, I don‚Äôt speak for all of us so they may have different input than me.
---
Other than that, have a good one, and I just want to add:
---
I really do hope I‚Äôm wrong about all this.
---
so much for the ,oops we're sorry we we wont do that again, from the pay to win outfits lol
---
If it is a one time payment for a dlc that's different then having to spend atoms each time you want a kit. So unless the atom shop is selling the ability to craft it it is different then buying a dlc
---
They are going to do it anyways because someone will use it all the time to be more effiecent thus making them real money. I don't think they will care enought about public opinion. I mean the cost of ATOMS is already outrageous and they havent budged on dropping those in price. 
---
If I see this happen I'll personally boycott the atom shop!
---
You arnt paying for more features. You can tie your own shoes. Or you can pay Todd to tie them less efficiently. Its your choice. 
---
The 100% ones are sold, 150% are in game drops, and 200% is a craft bench. 
---
Right. Because waiting and see what happens with the Unstoppables outfit clearly didn‚Äôt lead to this
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be worth the risk of being banned from fallout lol
---
Unless of course they decrease the rate at which you can acquire free ATOMS. Then it will still be technically possible but highly unlikely. My bet is that the FREE will ultimately be in name only.
---
I think everyone should just calm down, take a minute, then go respec 3 points into Int and run 3 star make shift or gun smith. Just saying.
---
Arrrrrghhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
The gold 44 mag skin was a flash sale like a month ago. Its gone.
---
Holy Mother of Atom it‚Äôs the Gawd dam Apocalypse
---
(Fart Noise)
---
And that'll be when I uninstall.
---
East and slightly North of WestTek... Head East from WestTek until you hit the ridge and then head North along the ridge. I can see it from my CAMP.
---
Well, in a way they are. Stuff in the Atom store generate money, money generate budget for the game, which provide the pay for the developers so they can keep improving and developing the game. So, the one leads to the other. 
---
Well, if they sell them for 10 or 20 atoms then it isn't pay to win because you can get plenty of them from just playing the game and your weapons and armor dont break fast enough for buying them to be any more efficient than just earning them. 
---
People are upset because we've been told multiple times that the Atomic Shop would be for cosmetics only.  Putting a utility item in, even something as simple as a repair kit, is a complete departure from that statement.
---
Many were wary of the inclusion of microtransactions period,  but most were willing to accept that they would not affect gameplay.  What this represents is a turn toward more monetized in game advantages, and the predatory marketing practices that go along with them. 
---
You don't have to pay to win, but you can is the premise, and also the fact that they promised one thing and changed their mind. 
---
I‚Äôm trying to get access to the dome for the ammo and whatnot now. I does suck but I just want to try out other options for a backup weapon. 
---
I know the feeling on the laser rifle. I have vampires 3* and I love melting SB with it. Lasers are amazing. And anyone that says otherwise. Doubts the power of science!
---
As for the long barrel I couldn‚Äôt tell you. Maybe google it for reference. 
---
Or they will pull them into a mega thread and let the boo Hooers circle jirk eachother. 
---
Is this the real life...?
---
Is this just fantasy...?
---
Yes! Elder Scrolls Online rakes in so much cash... it's hard to see how this game ISN'T Zeni saying "Great, now let's do it with Fallout!" Especially considering the next version of a full Fallout game is probably a decade away. There's no way Zenimax would be willing to go that long without raking in cash from the huge Fallout fanbase.
---
Sending scrap to your stash is just the Fallout version of the ESO banker (which costs just under $40 in the ESO shop btw). 
---
I think it's only a matter of time before there is a paid subscription model offered with a monthly allotment of Atoms and perks like junk weighs 0 in your stash (ESO craft bag). 
---
There are plenty of lazy gamers that would rather drop five bucks then spend a couple hours grinding. AC Odyssey its incredibly easy to get materials and gold, yet they still make loads of money off selling materials packs, and "time savers". Im just worried that if Bethesda tries to capture this market it will exclude those of us who wont pay for things from enjoying new content.
---
Some of the outfits and hats are rare drops that some people will pay big caps for. It seems the various colored clean outfits go for around 2k caps on Xbox 
---
Why do you think they nerfed ‚Äúwhite knight‚Äùnow? What decisions do they make on the future based on player repair potentially costing money?
---
The moment F76 turns f2p the Atom Shop becomes the main Money Source. I guess the Repair Kit is a test from Beth to see how the Community will react to that Business Model xD And it flopped hard.
---
It's a bit far from the Monorail Elevator.  If you start at Camp Venture and head toward the southwest, you'll bump into it as you transition from the Mire to the Savage Divide.  It's around the Kerwood Mine, I think.
---
I used to clear trails in central Idaho's Wilderness of No Return, and a lot of people would tell me, "You're living the dream, man!"
---
And in a way, they were right--the crew backpacked all summer deep into the backcountry; our boss was a 40 mile plane ride away; we got plenty of sunshine and the work made us strong.
---
But everything that made the job awesome on a good day could also   make it downright horrific on a bad day: when it rained, we worked (and camped) in the mud. If a tool broke, you'd have to improvise. If there was a serious accident, you'd have to be carried to the airstrip, then flown to town.
---
And if the weather turned stormy, we could end up stranded, camped at an airstrip for days without food, waiting for the plane.
---
Working in the backcountry was great, but the old-growth forest and steep canyons meant sawing through 60" fallen Ponderosa logs and digging the trail out from beneath landslides. The wildlife was majestic, but bears, wolves and cougars would prowl around camp at night, trying to steal our food.
---
tl:dr:  Just because I work in your vacation spot doesn't mean I'm on vacation!
---
I think people are more upset about the possibility of more items like this being added then just the kits themselves.  As many people have said it's a slippery slope to things more p2w then the kits
---
Did not believe this when I was younger, but after over 3 decades I can assure you, they do. 
---
Do not know if it's karma, universe, God or whatever. 
---
But it happens even if it takes some time. 
---
Always.
---
1st. You said what I said, people are just angry because it's in the Atom Shop. They wouldn't be angry if it was just sold as a DLC item.
---
2nd. If they sell them for 10 or 20 atoms then it isn't pay to win because you could get plenty from playing the game legit.
---
You gotta move your camp unit to the periphery of your base away from the cliff 
---
I payed 60 bucks for this game, there shouldn‚Äôt be this kind of shit in a full-priced game.
---
This is reddit, there will always be people to complain in this particular situation on your idea they would complain they can‚Äôt buy it free with the atoms they earned from playing 
---
Just because it's not necessary doesn't mean it's good. They'll eventually add things that you won't be able to get or do ingame, and as I mentioned, they said before launch that they wouldn't sell non cosmetic things.
---
Does that somehow not make it play to win?
---
Think about this for a moment....
---
 When dungeons come out...folks will be spending hours grinding and the more time they dont have to go home the more loot they get.
---
Now tell me that the person who spends real money on repair kits wont have an advantage?
---
Just yesterday or so I was browsing the fallout lore subreddit and I thought ‚ÄòYou know, I haven‚Äôt seen any negative posts about 76 for a while. I wonder if Bethesda has finally gotten things under control?‚Äô And then I see this üòÇ
---
I guess my first sentence isn't visible on your end, here I'll copy and paste it.
---
*So are you going to complain if they start selling plans for weapons and armor to avoid RNG?*
---
The above is obviously what I was referring to as rare plans are currently the only in game content. Like you said, all it does is save time, but at that point why are you playing? Go flex your wallet dick in the real world were someone may actually care you have more than them.
---
There was also a robot you could repair as part of a quest, and then assign him to a settlement. Putting beverages inside him for 20 minutes made them ice cold and gave more benefit.
---
Arrrrrghhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!
---
Oh. I found a few clean hats and remember seeing something about them. Old school runescape party hat flashbacks  commence
---
Whats the advantage?
---
Yes I am. But the rate at which players will be able to get them from these challenges has not been announced. And unless you are able to get a lot of them from these challenges, someone will still be able to buy more packs with cash. If you can only get 5 improved packs, but a player drops money and purchases 20 regular packs, they will still have an advantage. 
---
Fucking hell this is the 12th post I've seen on the same subject. Why don't you all just make one thread and moan on that? 
---
I am well aware the original is still active, as I said in the main post:
---
&gt;So just in case the original post was changed
---
Sometimes in situations like this companies burn the original material
---
Was interested in buying f76 when I heard about the survival mode. Now I couldn't care less. Bethesda messed up again. Wasted opportunity for a fresh start for a game that is known only for it's exploits and bugs. 
---
Everyone is someone's asshooe. Yourself included
---
Thanks 
---
Further more I'd like to say they didnt lie, it's just a cosmetic for your gun to make it look all brand spanking new and shiny
---
And you get that free downvote for having an opinion lol. 
---
All I want is that field scribe outfit. That red combat sweater is so choice!
---
The shop is an easy way to get something to people without designing an event or relying on a random drop.
---
I get the 'only cosmetic items' thing.  I get that it matters to people.  But personally I don't care if they stick to the absolute letter of that.  If they add something that isn't *exactly* cosmetic but has no appreciable effect on the game balance, there's no loss.  The costume 'debacle' was certainly pushing things, even though it was minute, I won't argue that.  But this isn't going to raise to even that level, and that's assuming the worst.
---
Until we see what they implement, I see no reason to get riled up about it.
---
Some people...people who may or may not have a hoarding problem...level their mules to take advantage of weight reduction perks ;)
---
Nailed it. Lots of promises made and they're slowly conditioning us to accept it. Im soooo... Tired of defending everything they do. Its not right. 
---
I get that but all I'm saying is that if they were to sell a DLC pack that let's you craft refrigerators, backpacks, repair kits and all that no one would bat an eye nut if they did that same exact action but the dlc was sold through the Atom Shop people would lose it based in name alone.
---
Repairing gives you zero edge. I'd call this cosmetic. I can play an entire weekend and only repair once. 
---
Its an echo chamber today. But im frustrated thats all
---
Would doing that cause my camp to despawn as long as I don't move it out of the building zone?
---
You're talking about the same sub that cried over a complimentary bag's material
---
That's what I said boss. Hopefully there isn't a market. Hard to tell how many players from the total player base actually use this sub, but if this sub is any reflection of the total base, it won't go over too well 
---
Man, I was about to really get back to this game with a couple of buddies I hadn't really connected with in a couple of years. Now I'm not sure I want to.
---
Me? 
---
The smart way is to keep it cosmetic only, but increase the limited time only items. Release stuff for one week, and thats it. Never again. 
---
Wear power armor üòÇ
---
I understand how they work and the player will choose to use the best method of those that are immediately available to them but given that the only known way to get the Advanced repair kit (150%) is by killing the Scorchbeast Queen then I think we can take Bethesda at their word of them being a "rare item". 
---
This means that, in most cases, the player will need to choose between a Cash Shop 100% field repair or having to leave their current location to fast travel to a repair bench. 
---
I'm sorry that you're having trouble understanding the implications this item will likely have on the game but they will give a distinct and very real advantage over players who choose to not buy them. 
---
Its not in the game for consoles. But it is ok for PC
---
I actually have like 3k atoms sitting unused right now, because the Atom Shop decor stuff has been pretty meh. So I would love to spend those atoms and maybe even buy more... I just need cool, reasonably priced decor to spend them on. :-p
---
Also, to your point about using Creation Club stuff-- I had that exact thought last night when I was playing a modded up FO4 run. I just bought the Noir Penthouse package from CC and it is \*amazing\*. I mean, the guy who designed it is awesome, and he should be producing stuff like this for Bethesda all day. It's crazy that the purchase I made in FO4, a nearly 4 year old game, made me so much happier than anything I've bought in FO76 so far. xD
---
Here's a video from Oxhorn showcasing it for anyone who's interested: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXs9zMF9l9I&amp;t=1653s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXs9zMF9l9I&amp;t=1653s)
---
I think the unlocked player home itself is shown around 15 minutes in. 
---
It‚Äôs not pay to win at all.
---
Have a look at guildwars 2. LOADS of cosmetics with a few QoL things. Atoms are sinilar to their gold/gem conversion system; earned in game as gold or bought as gems. Very successful game. 
---
I get the sentiment that you don‚Äôt want people to ‚Äúbuy things to have advantage‚Äù but really, it‚Äôs not going to hurt you. It supports the game and the devs. And is a neat little QoL thing that you can realistically earn in-game pretty easily. Atoms aren‚Äôt hard to come by without spending money if you actually play the game. I have a surplus of atoms and DONT focus on challenges. Just happens as you play the game.
---
Pay to win would be ‚ÄúI bought this gun that 1-shots you and you can‚Äôt hurt me at all‚Äù
---
This is just ‚Äúpay to have less of a grind‚Äù, which is whatever. But doesn‚Äôt really hurt anybody.
---
I think it‚Äôs the fact that they will get money from it, determine that it‚Äôs a success and cram that shit down our throats.
---
No you can move it just like any other piece.
---
Fair point, and basically goes back to my point that 'competitive' and 'P2W' can be pretty flexible things when it comes to interpretation. I rather doubt they're going to remove reskins as an option though. xD
---
That's not how DLC works and I think even the biggest critics understand that. DLC cost money not okay time.
---
Yes, I was just being sarcastic about the other posters argument and the fact that your response had been downvoted. 
---
It takes resources to repair. Maybe less for you since you've apparently spec'd that way. It's a feature, not cosmetic
---
No fix I know of for that one.  My plan was to wait and do them on a second character if necessary, hopefully after they have had time to fix more related bugs.
---
I agree with everything you said except the last sentence. I'm choosing now to get riled up about it so hopefully there's enough negative press that they stick to their original intent and we can keep supporting them the way we have been.
---
...I promise, Devs see all. 
---
I have a few chassis but I'm not a high enough level to use the armour pieces so I'm not using it yet
---
Yes I understand. My point wasn‚Äôt that these actions did not have consequences, it was that the consequences are part of the game you‚Äôre playing. If you can‚Äôt handle the consequences of the video game then don‚Äôt play it. Equating being on the losing end of a pvp interaction created by the developers to bullying or being the victim of some ‚Äòass hole‚Äô is silly. 
---
Well the dlc you mentioned would be a one time payment then you would be able to craft as many of the things as you wanted but the kits appear to be one per purchase so it is slightly different.  I wouldn't mind spending a few bucks or atoms on the ability to craft repair kits but that doesn't seem to be how it will work
---
What arguement lol? He just said "wrong" and I dont think he even read the damn thing.
---
Yea, you never know. Any amount of money could be a justification to them
---
What‚Äôs worse is the better version isn‚Äôt an atom store exclusive...Genuinely makes no sense to me, just make them both in game only.
---
I didn't downvote his repy, someone else did
---
Then under that example they‚Äôd still be breaking a promise of free dlc for the game, hence there would still be a group that would complain
---
Oh! The actual Camp unit. Sorry I thought you meant the entire thing. I'll do that then as it is on the balcony üòÇ
---
They havent said how they will be sold but so maybe they will just sell the "plan" if you will 
---
Can I get one later I‚Äôm not home but I would like one
---
That's what I'm hoping 
---
No, they said there would be free dlc but they never said ALL doc would be free.
---
If you're after the Western Duster outfit, if you're on XB1 I'll craft it for you
---
No worries  I fell off many a cliff before someone told me you could move it.
---
No joke
---
I mean, I‚Äôm all for **all for** paying for utilities... In Warframe. Which is free to download, lol
---
I havnt specced that way, I just swap stuff around, repair, and swap my cards back. Infact, getting 200% gives a pretty noticable damage buff and armor buff  that 100% repair kits can never get. So... maybe we should also ban users who use the better repairing perk. It's obviously ruining the game for others. 
---
I wouldn't consider repair kits in general to be pay to win.  It isn't necessarily about the repair kits or how much they will cost.  The part that worries people is that this represents a trend, a push towards more paid advantages. You start with repair kits, a seemingly harmless qol item, and move on to bigger and more expensive items as the community gets used to them.  
---
fuck you, acting like your post was a novel, it's a few second read at most
---
lots of people (a lot of which don't play the game) watch those videos and it shapes popular opinion.
---
That's not entirely true-the better repair kits can be acquired in world from events 
---
Sugar grove is probably the most popular. Lots of fans on the desks inside the entrance, and 3-4 globes. 
---
Any offices really, just look for fans and typewriters. It makes it easier if you flag them for search in your inventory, then you pick them up everywhere. I have 500 in my inventory right now. 
---
If so then it's still breaking the only cosmetic promise but it wont be pay to win because anyone can get the atoms for a one time purchase legit.
---
No love for the Brotherhood Recon Rifle?
---
I dont doubt it at all, I feel like I came across differently than I intended. I just saw a little humor in the situation is all!
---
Are you paying extra for your perk cards?
---
Hope you enjoy 1 diluted stimpak then lol
---
yes they did dickhead
---
Found it!!!
---
Thank you!!!

---
Haha not even an argument, I just thought it was funny is all
---
Yeah it wont be p2w but still kind of shitty of them to break the promise 
---
I understand the concern but its assuming guilt before of an event that hasnt even taken place yet if ever.
---
Nope but I obviously specced in a way that makes it unfair, that even paid content cant beat my setup!
---
But they never said there would be some free and some for sale, again giving people something to complain about, the point is there will never be a point where a decision made by Bethesda will make everyone happy 
---
Arrrrrghhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!
---
No - there are 20 ultracite pa mods but no jet pack.
---
Nice, good to hear.
---
The repair kits are not p2w, they are a convenience. All it does is let you repair your weapon without a workbench.
---
Also, idk about anyone else, but I always carry a backup or 7, which swapping to another favorite is quicker than busting out a repair kit. 
---
Wrong place?
---
A promise is a fucking promise. If you break it then YOU are the asshole. 
---
Now you're just derailing the conversation.
---
Nice to see someone giving all the reasons their quitting, and in a mature way, and having a mature solution.
---
I am actually, you just a smug cunt
---
True
---
There should be. Also what are those other mods
---
Fortnite literally has only cosmetics lol. 
---
You aren‚Äôt wrong.  So what?
---
Mulching Blade?
---
Oh I agree with that, someone will always have something to complain about ni matter what. 
---
Early on in the game I was playing with two friends. One of them was off doing her own thing and ended up playing with some random who eventually joined our team. Of course the two of us that were not with them immediately traveled to the new persons camp and put cat pictures on as many surfaces as we possibly could. 
---
Play the game, earn your free atoms, buy repair kit.  Alternatively you can repair your items the same way you always have.  Zero issue for me.  That said I‚Äôm one guy and if everyone else feels differently then their voices should be heard as well.  I‚Äôm not going to join your posts but I‚Äôll support your right to make them :)
---
I‚Äôve defended the game since day 1. I stepped back for a while to let them fix bugs, but I‚Äôve never gone around hating on the game. I truly hope the obvious fan outrage is enough to change this choice. This subreddit is covered with hate about this decision, and the youtubers seem to have gotten a hold of the story as well. Here‚Äôs hoping Bethesda makes the right choice!
---
I'm sorry, but my 200% repair using junk gives me an actual advantage to armor and melee damage. People who use these will actually be at a disadvantage compared to me.
---
If you are working on the diseases challenge, do you know where to find Jelly Fingers?  It's the only one I haven't managed to find yet.
---
I bet. Have a good day there kiddo.
---
Nah I reckon just be able to find Legendary Stash boxes on Enemies with ammo/fdc/weapon weight reduction
---
I don‚Äôt have any at the moment I‚Äôm not even the poster
---
God, do you remember the days before reddit and social media when one had to *shudder* go to a game's official forums to see real-time player feedback?
---
Dark days.
---
If Todd Howards says it, i'm pretty sure it's a lie.
---
We can't let this turn into a pay to win
---
Tree tops and Picketts fort if you need leather
---
That‚Äôs good to know. Thanks I will need to take some time and look for my self now that I have most of them. Thanks for letting me know! 
---
Fuck pay to win
---
I was making a joke but just so you know even in just a chassis you don‚Äôt take fall damage. At least you didn‚Äôt in Fallout 4. I haven‚Äôt tested it here...
---
Players, the queen, bunker science wing

I wish it would happen but it never did and never will. Too many people complain that it's dark at night (lol..) and they can't see shit without putting some light on.  I just hate how easy and unrealistic games became to cater to a society that has everything everything handed to them on a silver plate.
---
Games are supposed to be fun, but also challenging. Night or different weather should become more than just a change in screen tint. It should be a gameplay feature that introduces new ways to interact with the world. It should should pose a challenge but also give benefit to those who prefer to play in these conditions. Some ingredients/monsters/events should only happen in certain weather conditions and time of the day.
---
THANK YOU!  
---
Finally an non-snowflake argument!  
---
Too bad i can upvote you ony once sir..
---
Another nail in the coffin. I uninstalled the game a while ago and haven't had any regrets except for buying the game in the first place, and then having it go on sale in a week's time.
---
He stole that; https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/b9c8qg/what_seems_like_an_easy_job_but_is_actually/ek3sjbw/
---
People got mad 3 weeks after the unstoppable 15 hp week. There was one costume you got in game, and then a few other fun ones in the shop. They all counted as armor and at endgame you'd get one shotted. So the 15 hp was completly negligible. But people still cried when the figured it out, once again, 3 weeks later. 
---
That's just a slippery slope argument. 
---
100% that is the way it works and its super easy to test in game. The wiki also is lacking in my experience. Also the only way to make use of the v. fast melee weapons (ripper, chainsaw, etc.) is to repair to 200%.
---
Hey I‚Äôm always here for a new copypasta
---
I started playing online games with Ultima Online back in -98, so if you don't think I understand how online games, microtransactions and p2w work, well, that is on you.
---
While you choose between using shop repair or abandonning the dungeon, I bring out my back-up weapon. That is how gaming experience works. You adapt. You wanna use the basic kits, good for you. I won't.
---
Thanks mate will try

I know hahaha and I believe that is true, remember reading one of the notes on the loading screen 
---
Fuck Bethesda. They‚Äôre out of touch
---
Exactly 
---
Paging u/cortechthrowaway
---
I respectfully disagree. Game has advantrue mode where no pvp present. Having repair kit wont impact anything and even pvp mode people will come out with the best gear they have and breaking down weapons wont impact that much in any sense.. Also i think everyone is having p2w concept is bad idea but i respectfully disagree too. Because not everyone really have so many hours a day to play game. For example i dont want to spend hours just to get springs and stuff so that i can repair my armor. Thats absurdly cost a lot and takes time. I rather explore and grind for legendary instead of looking for stupid junk items. In that sense having these items are actually balancing out with people has no time to actually playing long time. It doesnt necessarily break the balance of the game but improve the quality of the time playong game i beleive.
---
It does for me. Easily. Since I started playing again earlier this week I've been through about 4 SBQ fights and nothing has broken. 
---
Respectfully, it's still something they said they would not do.
---
I have weapon artisan and fix-it-good at max rank so I'd never buy these, but still.
---
Damnum absque injuria, you just know they'll add this before they fix the bug wherein you can't repair a grog axe past 100% even with perks.
---
Bethesda: Please just don't.
---
Other point being is yes prices on the store are silly but bethesda needs that money flow to keep the game running and to pay the team to handle be content it didn‚Äôt make the proposed sales it hoped for so it‚Äôs indeed scrambling to fix the game and make investors happy and as it‚Äôs gaming community we should consider investing a bit more money to make that happen 
---
That seems like a better use of it
---
Damn just saw this, i was driving home and messaging while stuck in traffic.  
---
I would be ok w that.  Again it's a fine concept in survival mode but outside of that I just wanna use public workshops to make resource gathering easier for others And to experiment with camp ideas/blueprints. 
---
Hahahahahahaha  
---
No.   
---
YouTubers only say things to make themselves richer. They are usually full of incorrect information and "scare tactics" to get people upset so they can get more comments and views.   
---
Most game studio companies don't look towards YouTube for public feedback, they look towards message boards, Facebook groups, etc. 
---
The only time I can think of that these might be useful is during the SBQ fight, and if "improved" ones drop as loot, I figure most people would want those anyway.
---
What's unacceptable is cheating in survival mode, can someone from Bethesda get in touch to sort this out, if this isn't cheating, then this whole combat system is broken. 
---
Oh, RNGesus has not been kind to me with mutations. I had marsupial for the first time recently, and in my excitement I healed up... including a Radaway. I died inside. 
---
Thanks for the tips and suggestions. I‚Äôve been so into the melee zone, and the perks and tactics don‚Äôt translate well for stealth or ranged play. 
---
I'd build an internet(terminal) cafe. Brings me back to my childhood.
---
Devs can see whatever they want, but if upper management says they're not doing X, they're not doing it. Period.
---
I mean... we all paid-to-play...
---
The standard for P2W is very simple.  If an item costs real world money and provides an advantage over someone who doesn't, it's P2W.
---
This is actually the second flag on the slippery slope.  The first was the Unstoppables gear that had the temporary health bonus.  People complained, but we mostly wrote it off as a cheeky thing.  It only lasted a week or two.  Now, we're at the next stop - an item you can purchase to grant an instant repair to your gear that flies directly in the face of "We're only offering cosmetic items in the Atom Shop."
---
Players feel a line has been crossed because it has.  What happens at the third flag?  Super Duper Stimpacks?  RadShield on demand?  I think that's what they're ultimately upset about, and given that Bethesda barely has this train back on the tracks, it was a really stupid addition to make.
---
You can't be serious - sarcasm??? ü§î
---
Just because the cheats are being sold by the devs they aren't somehow magically not cheats now.
---
No, that doesn't make it OK, in fact, it's *worse* [than buying cheats from a third party].
---
Personally, despite the flaws and being suspended that one time for 2 months I love this game. So happy they unbanned and me and didn't reban me with everyone else.
---
I think finding new and unique items and weapons with new effects is the way to go. I've been grinding for the survival award legendaries because they are unique. Not because they are OP. I like the random cosmetic drops as well. It's fun grinding for the ultra rare stuff.
---
I think if they had set bonuses for legendary items that would be kick ass. Like a full set of kangaroo leathers give you the marsupial effect. 
---
A pair of glasses or goggles that gives you night vision.
---
A helmet that reduces head-shot damage by 50 pct.
---
Stuff like this would be amazing
---
Lots of people only think of themselves and the anonymity of being online exacerbates that behavior.  Have no fear, the day will come when a kind stranger will arrive at your camp and leave plans, recipes and equipment just to be neighborly.  That said I hope those fellas that wrecked your hard work find themselves with the fleas of a 1000 ragstags nesting in their collective croches. 
---
You sure about that?
---
I think of it more like the community is taking preventative measures.  At the end of the day, Bethesda and Zenimax are businesses. They are always going to push the boundaries in terms of what customers will put up with to turn a higher profit.  
---
The only hint is that it would be great if we moderated this place and cleaned it up a bit.
---
No those shots are not lost they remains in the cores charge but the ammo loaded shows 13 which come from no where so more or less you have more ammo technically
---
Wasn't gonna comment to this ..."story post" but FINALY someone gets it!
---
I don't even think it would be a problem in pvp. By the time someone opens up the pip, scrolls to the weapon, inspects it then fixes it they would already be dead. 
---
Good for you. You're still, for all we know, among a minority of players who feel this way. You're also handwaving and lighting torches without knowing anything more about it, or how it's going to be implemented.
---
Personally, I'll be glad when this latest tsunami of whingy posts about something Bethesda did are over.
---
fallout 76 now epic only! All current bethesda owners need to re-purchase the game
---
I'd like to see snappable conduit, to go with this.  Maybe have like as grid of 9 snappable nodes per wall, floor and roof piece to attach conduit to. Also make it so that putting conduit on the ceiling, is on the ceiling, not clipping through like it currently does. By default, it should sit on the ceiling the way it does when you place a vertical piece.
---
I approve of this message, I‚Äôd pay actual money for it.

Selling an Uber weapon for cash is no ok. Selling a convenience/qol item is ok. That‚Äôs how mmos without monthly subs survive.
---
Please, tell us how you know everything they're doing. Please provide us with the inside scoop on exactly how this will be implemented. Do you have a crystal ball? A time machine, maybe?
---
I can read perfectly fine. What I said is what I meant. You think it‚Äôs gross I support this, I think it‚Äôs gross gamers cry over things that aren‚Äôt for them. 
---
The repair kits aren‚Äôt for me. I will not use them.
---
What‚Äôs more concerning to me is the lack of post game. Cry about that more.
---
As if bethesda cares about what they say. Even the community doesn't take them seriously, I can't imagine the suits up in management doing so. They probably won't even know the videos exist. At best, a secretary or community manager might tell them about "negative press feedback" and they will assume it's some journalist or something
---
After getting told how bad my mother f\*cks by an angry teen, I deactivated that shit.
---
There are busted pipes in both of the cooling towers, also there's some equipment you have to repair along with the pipes. Look for sparking.
---
Get this to the top on this reddit so Beth can see every time they come here
---
Thanks. Not expecting much of a response from others. There will be trolls of course.
---
I really hope to encourage other gamers to vote with their wallets. Provide constructive feed back or displeasure. 
---
As someone gaming for the past 30 years, I really want future generations of gamers to have some of the fun times that I have had, without micro transactions (pay to win) and games released unfinished. 
---
You should take a breath between "bethesda, waaaa's" and elaborate more.
---
I like this game, and it was stated this wouldnt turn into pay 2 win... And if it does i know alot of people will quit. I spent alot of time for my build. I didnt dupe. And turning this game into p2w might as well allow duping. Not Everyone has the money to spend to get decent wpns that want to play and its going to take away certain aspects of the game.
---
lucky me my incredible rocket mace just cost some steel to repair
---
then i cry when the scorchbeast bug herself out of earth and never land so i can't tag her u.u
---
I'm trying to get their attention about a cheater in the game, it's absurd how this is carrying on in this game and its getting ridiculous 
---
Only carry what you can afford to lose.
---
I am truly afraid of what Bethesda will do to monetize TESIV. 
---
I took that section to mean they were implementing player ideas and requests not that they were all going to the atom shop.
---
For me it‚Äôs about the principle and what this opens up to happen in the future.
---
There are a few tricks you can use to get power through walls. It‚Äôs a pain because you have the most freedom to do what you want. 
---
It can't be it because its not time https://cdn2us.denofgeek.com/sites/denofgeekus/files/styles/article_width/public/2019/02/unnamed_1.png?itok=GjaCt7eG
---
Right now, I don't spend much time going out of my way to farm resources for repairs because I have perks like White Knight, Weapon Artisan, Gunsmith and Makeshift Warrior.  I even wound up taking Makeshift Warrior down to rank 3 because 5 seemed excessively good and that help free up INT for things like Nerd Rage.
---
But that's presuming two things:
---
* They keep the numbers the same.  There's no reason to assume one way or the other what they'll do in the future.
---
* They don't create ridiculously long dungeons that starve us of workbenches.  As others have said, it's probably not a coincidence that this change was announced the same day as The Burrows were.
---
Now see, that's a reasonable reply. Thank you.
---
So, can I ask you, why is my argument stupid? I mean obviously you disagree, and that's fine. I'm not gonna go calling you stupid just because we have different opinions. But, what I said is factual.
---
Pay to win means you have to spend real money to have an advantage over others. But you don't, everyone has the same access to Atoms without paying money.
---
I agree with your point about how it could get out of control, but until then, I see no harm with a tiny item like this. In my gaming experience, repairing weapons isn't much of an issue. I can repair my gun to 200%, run a silo and a SBQ and barely be under 100%. That's just me though, maybe it's different for others
---
Oh my bad
---
I am fine with them being in the shop if they are insanely cheap to make lots of them if the value of the item in games is 10-1 that's fine.
---
This said, i still think shop should be cosmetic only. 
---
Two different kinds and the good drops in game for free.  Atoms can be earned for free.  As long as they leave it in the shop so people can save up I have no issue. 
---
I agree with you  The problem isn't the item but this one item puts us on the slippery slope to P2W.  It's better to make sure we never get on that slope rather then try to climb back up it. 
---
Absolutely, but most people hardly see the harm caused to society by Pay To Cheat and games that are specifically *designed* to induce stress/frustration to push sales of "gems", "faster unlocks", whatnot.
---
My opinions are not always the best, but, they are often well ahead of those of "ordinary people"/societal norms. 
---
I may not be smarter, but I do think differently and put significant effort into considering issues that *most* people do not.
---
People typically suggest that I belong in /r/IAmVerySmart - yes, I know they are insulting me though I don't take it as an insult.  Rather, I am amused...
---
I like people who can disagree without just being an a-hol - people who don't think that yelling: "libtard!" at me wins the debate üòÖüòù
---
Oh I know what to be looking for, but literally none of it is there! Both towers already look completely repaired but the quest still says they need to be repaired. I think it's bugged and it has something to do with the pixelated nonsense, probably.
---
Don't quote me on this, but I think the BoS vendor in Watoga does.  If not him, then MODUS at Whitesprings.
---
I'm board for this. I'd rather be in power armor and clunk than not see
---
100% agree. 
---
Ask me how I know
---
Bethesda ... Keeping promises ... It seems you know nothing about Todd Howards isn't it ?
---
Spoiled milk already exists, it happens when you let brahmin milk expire. Turns into "Spoiled Brahmin Milk", just like how other items turn into "Spoiled Meat" and such.
---
I mean I repair my weapons to 200% and use 50%reduced durability perks so tbh I can't see myself using them.  
---
If they added in lootboxes or something that made a difference in combat then I'd care but this is a pay for quality of life thing not pay to win.
---
Man. Bethesda is going to add TSE weapons next 
---
Yeah, I love being stealthy, and the constant screen flashing is really hard to deal with.
---
I appreciate the well thought out response. Credit to you for presenting your point in an intelligent and coherent manner! Cheers!! üòÉ
---
Before I even read anything.. let me guess
---
1. I  got suspended because I either did something wrong or did something  that could be perceived as wrong. When can I get unsuspended?
---
2. YOU DESERVED TO GET BANNED AND STAY BANNED. I DON'T GIVE A DAMN WHAT THE REF SAYS
---
3. Listen here buddy, I didn't do anything wrong. THAT'S MY PURSE, I DON'T KNOW YOU
---
4. I know Bethesda makes no mistakes and YOU SIR ARE A DUPER
---
5. Then occasionally someone adds a mostly fruitless update to the situation "Dur I got an e-mail a month later!"
---
Did you read inside the vault?
---
Wait a few more weeks. They will have a refrigerator in the atom shop for purchase. Keeps food from spoinling!
---
Saving grace here is that it's probably a plan instead of a single use item. Considering how many atoms are given for free throughout the game, having a 300-500 atom plan for repair kits is acceptable given that a better alternative exists for free in the game. 
---
And before anybody jumps on this, no, that would not be pay to win. There are plenty of avenues in game to earn this without paying a dime. A player dropping $50 on atoms wouldn't get any extra benefits if it was just a plan. It's going back on the promise of cosmetic only, sure, but that's not on the same plane as pay to win. Pay to avoid a couple hours of moderate grinding is not the same thing.
---
Yes.  People have gone in with almost 200 Stimpacks and have been known to lose 90 in a single death.
---
It kind of sucks for those of us who run with Traveling Pharmacy in Adventure.  I don't intend to join PvP with this character, as she has a ton of Caps, but I have worked to whittle down my Aid over the last couple days, if only so I could replace Traveling Pharmacy with more useful things.
---
I don't need to know anything about it other than that it is a utility, QOL-based item, and not a cosmetic. 
---
Also, feel what way? Feel that because Bethesda promised to make the shop cosmetics only, they should keep that promise? 
---
Frankly, I don't think you even read the post given how irrelevant your reply is. 
---
I really doubt people's gonna make use out of these repair kits. I mean, most people don't even use chems! Can't imagine people actively popping repair kits just to get their weapon durability to 100%. It ain't like weapon break super often that you need to pop one every 5 minutes
---
Okay, but would you rather not have to pay for them at all? Why not just make them an item you can craft?
---
Stalking you and your overencumbered be soon to be junk pile!
---
Pay 2 win u mean?
---
BGS said they wouldn't do this. Online games require more in the way of trust and assurances than games you buy and own and can run whenever you want, forever. I'm wondering about a lot of things they said now. I'm wondering about their commitment to supporting the game for years, for example.
---
I‚Äôm conflicted on this, on the one hand it‚Äôs edging into pay to win/pay to reduce annoyances.
---
On the other, unlike most ptw games you can earn atoms at a pretty steady clip in game. I‚Äôve noticed I earn at least 50 a session just farting around at random, and if I‚Äôm trying I can easily get a couple hundred. 
---
I‚Äôd say wait to see pricing, if it‚Äôs like 25 atoms per I‚Äôd be ok with it, much more and I would start getting angry
---
***Paying instead of playing*** - it's not legit no matter who tries to rationalize it, no matter who you are paying.
---
Pay To Cheat takes many forms, some of them easily self-justified to those who buy them.
---
Very very bad for them to go down this route.
---
Clearly? Actually, I've never really used Reddit (I'm 49 for heaven sake, I owned Wasteland on an Amiga) and started lurking since I started FO76. I just recently got into it enough to start participating ‚Ä¶  warm fuzzy cuddly users like you kept me away. I guess I see why ‚Ä¶
---
Thanks for the warm welcome! And, for what it is worth I was more or less asking a serious question.
---
In case you are really wondering, this is all true. 
---
Not exactly correct.  It was in beta and removed whe beta stopped. However some players retained it after beta.
---
Can i help you?
---
They've been lying since E3 and only now does this upset you
---
That we went from this item being part of standard loot and craftable in fonv, to "make it rare" as a compromise to buying it with real life $ is crazy to me.  
---
Fuck all that.  use fonv's system where you can craft them and it's no big deal for players to have them.  They should be easy to acquire and common.
---
Play to win! Not pay to win.
---
It's been 3? Years so my memory is a bit vague, but I recall them having eververse armor that gave a slight boost to xp. 
---
On your second point you're absolutely right, its similar to the unstoppables bonus, where it's a slight boost but basically useless to higher leveled players.
---
My main point/concern is that they are gonna start using the atomic shop for more and more 'quality of life' items, without adding content to the actual game. Much like how nearly all the cool stuff in Destiny is in the eververse.
---
I dont know, time will tell so I'll hold onto judging until its actually implemented, but I'm still nervous.
---
This. Right here. I'm more bothered about the other items brought up. Like the fridge. It's all small ball but it's really disappointing.
---
Not yet - it is on my list as well to do
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10
---
Haha thanks to this guy I was right on the money!!!
---
I suppose.
---
It fixed for me by putting the items in stash &amp; taking them back out.
---
I reckon its tied to the bug that won't allow inspecting items in vendors inventory. 
---
&gt;You‚Äôre supposed to be BETHESDA.
---
Er... Bethesda were the pioneers of nickle-and-diming their userbase with dumb microtransactions. EA and Activision *learned from Bethesda*. Horse armor is a meme for a reason. 
---
It's time we took Bethesda's belt and scissors away, and lock em in a room with bed for walls and floors.
---
Yes, took screen shots to sell a few items and when I went to upload I saw not stats... weird
---
Your fault lmao 
---
Complain enough and they'll stop like they did with the lootboxes.. and then bring it back quietly when people are distracted by other things.
---
You have to pay to let Bethesda know what's broken in their game?
---
Well your second point is what I was building up to, as I am fairly sure that that is why they think they we will want these. As its not like there are really ANY fights in the game that will burn a full condition   
---
(viable) weapon much less the two(+) we are all carrying. Even Glassed caverns is not that bad.
---
No. 
---
Yeah, let's complain about people complaining about people complaining about repair kits instead!
---
Really though, it is pointless. This reaction has already made an impact. The community managers have been tagged countless times and are definitely aware what the community thinks. Whether or not upper management decides to care about it or not is at this point beyond our power.
---
True but it's just the perceived beginning of P2W for the reason of the backlash
---
if the repair kits can be purchased and bring the resilience up to 150% on call 
---
there‚Äôs no chance for long haul power armor users like me to fight someone who carries more than a few 
---
depending on if they can be hotkeyed and favourited and multiplied useage like a stimpack.
---
could very well be the start to pay 2 play
---
Go to the website, it‚Äôs literally we everyone got the info from 
---
They really don‚Äôt need to be tagged in every post.  If you want someone to help you don‚Äôt hound them relentlessly. 
---
Eh, Bethesda will do it and eventually the screeching will stop. I'm not worried about it, I'm just going to enjoy the game like normal.
---
What were they doing that leads you to believe they were cheating?
---
I mean I imagine that the vaults aren't endless nor are peoples carry weight so you can fast travel bk to base after a clear? you can then sell the items you farmed in the vault to buy the mats to repair your stuff to 200%. I honestly don't see the problem.
---
Everything before the repair kits was cosmetic. There is a difference between selling cosmetic gear and selling items that change the actual gameplay. I didnt say it destroys the integrity. I am just voicing my concerns with them excluding those of us who wont pay for new game content.
---
Is it a cosmetic item ? Has Bethesda promised to pit only cosmetic items ? Do you like to be fooled ?
---
It is not Pay to Win. It is pay for minor convenience.  And only the crappy normal kits are in the Atomic Shop. The better kits will drop in world from events and stuff
---
Right, the only thing that comes close is the SBQ.  At Makeshift Warrior 3, I can break a 200% Super Sledge on her, which is why I now do a 1-2 approach of Anti-Armor Fire Axe in the first half, and Executioner's Sledgehammer in the second.
---
I don‚Äôt know about set bonuses. Things are a bit over powering now as is. 
---
Man we all are disappointed by this repair kit thing but let's not talk shit just for the sake of it.
---
If they delayed player vending is probably because they found big bug or a possible exploit and they need more development time to fix it...
---
Stop doing this.  Every post has tags to the devs and it‚Äôs inconsiderate at best.  They can see the posts.  You don't harass people you're asking for assistance. 
---
I'm just not going to get bent out of shape until I see something that is really P2W, that's all
---
Well yes that is a viable stance on the subject, but that is and will be discussed to death elsewhere, here I want to make sure every one has the facts. I just don't see these things as being overly cost effective **in terms of avoiding farming**.
---
God that is so infuriating. It does seem that turrets won't fire at anything that is not in the camp's parameter.  I mutant 50 yards away can steadily chip away at your generator until it blows up and the turrets won't even notice him.
---
So you like been fooled.
---
I think it depends on what weapons you're running and how much damage you're putting into the queen. My crew runs her several times a night, and we do not get out of a fight without broken guns. 
---
Gotta agree with this. They've had mostly garbage in there for a while with a few gems every now and then (like the blackbird paint). I come back from a two month hiatus and I see excavator paint, ultracite paint, plenty of weapon skins, awesome power armor paints, and a lot of it at reasonable prices. 1500 for a bundle of some clothes, weapon skins, PA skins, and suits still feels like a bit over the top for a $60 game, but it's far more reasonable than 1800 for one paint that can only be used on 4 of the 7 power armors. I will happily buy more from the store if they continue to add awesome stuff at fair prices, and if they do it well enough I'll even pay out of my wallet for them
---
‚ÄúLook at me, give me attention‚Äù
---
You‚Äôre right- until then...
---
In terms of food, Carnivore solves a lot of that for me.  I have to give away so many glowing meat steaks now- I get too full too fast. :)
---
Well ok then, lol was worth a shot
---
And here I just spent money on atoms last week to get the camo pack. I originally stated I‚Äôd never buy atoms until the AS started getting better valued purchases. Wanted to show support for the bundles. 
---
Yup, you win
---
Similiar to the other PAs but I think with a couple of unique ones (?).
---
Like rebar ( for torso ). I have that installed.
---
‚òùüèªthis person doesn‚Äôt speak for all of us
---
I don‚Äôt think the repair kit is supposed to replace traditional repairing. It‚Äôs supposed to be a repair option for when you are out adventuring with no workbench around. 
---
Gunmetal Gatling skin, please. Something clean. I'd never let my weapon get in the condition the Gatling base skin shows.
---
How are repair kits pay to win exactly? Do they give some magical ability to one shot opponents? Damage buffs? Increased defenses beyond what perks already give?....this just sounds like senseless whining.
---
Never claimed to know everything except whats being posted here and on Bethesda fourms. People are upset... Thats pretty clear. Im just hear venting frustrations about this possibility of them going back on there word about ATOM shop content. With the climate of Pay to Win in gaming tgese days... Bethesda made it pretty clear at E3 they're not going that route. It would destroy whatever credibility they have left. Im fucking worried about ES and future developments. 
---
My DeLorean is in the shop and my girlfriend wont let me touch her crystal ball. 
---
If there was 200% versions sure but think about it, we're not paying a subscription so the only way we get more content is if they're making money and unfortunately alot of people don't care enough about cosmetics to invest money in it.
---
 So it's either quality of life things being added to the store or straight up pay to win power armour sets if you want future content.
---
I decided after the release it‚Äôs used copies only of Bethesda games I get what I want but they get nothing from me, however still love this game
---
Heavy breathing, panting, primordal grunting... yup, thats about right.
---
It is.  But at the same time, remember the Unstoppables gear?  That bonus HP promotion was cheeky and cute, but it was along similar lines for a couple weeks.  This is the next stage on our slippery slope and I think it rightfully makes players hesitate and ask where this is going.
---
If you need a bodyguard my services are available for a small price of fusion cells. I have the finest enclave training and technology available
---
I spend more time repairing my armor than I do my guns.  My guns don't seem to break often, partly because I have Gunsmith level 5, and I have a feeling when I get the perk for bonus condition repairs, I'll be repairing stuff even less.
---
Armor always seems to require more repairs, but again, I lack the perk for bonus repair condition, maybe when I get that, I'll be repairing a lot less.  Materials used to be an issue, but nowadays I have a good system for where to get my stuff, and I seem to have enough for everything.  
---
Overall, I actually don't think I'd use repair kits very often except maybe for an emergency armor repair if that's possible.
---
Either way, even if I don't perceive repairs as an issue that demands field repairing with kits, I don't think this sort of thing belongs on the Atomic Shop.  If we show them we're tolerable of it, who knows what the next iteration of Atomic Shop benefits will be, this needs to be nipped in the bud.
---
Perks, you prob have ordnance express or other weight lessening perks that don‚Äôt affect your stash
---
Do you have any weight mitigation perks? They don't apply to stashed items 
---
So wait they are taking pvp out of the main game mode so how can anyone "win" I know there is this belief in bergeroning everything to the lowest common denominator but games are inherently unfair. People with more free time end up with more and better resources. They have already made plans non special for the gotta have it now crowds
---
Stop it.
---
I‚Äôm teasing you about listing reasons melee builds are great (no ammo costs, one hit kills, etc). I don‚Äôt run bloodied because I hate being low health- don‚Äôt enjoy the ‚Äòglass cannon‚Äô build. Plus running bloodied means you really gotta wear the proper armor sets too. 
---
I use vampire because it fits with my play style, not because I can‚Äôt afford virtual caps. I used to sneak around, trying to snipe from the shadows, but once I found a vampires melee weapon, I loved that I could get right in a deathclaw‚Äôs face and just whack away and not worry about taking too much damage. So ymmv, but it suits my build pretty well. Btw, I have a crap ton of bloodied and AA weapons, but i sell those mostly (other than certain AA pieces I keep)
---
I‚Äôd like to chat about the new dungeon or sheepsquatch ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Yeah, real good way to make sure they stay out of a toxic environment.
---
You say that like it's a bad thing? I honestly cannot wrap my head around the mindless hate in this subreddit for youtubers who make content on this game. 
---
This is a horrible decision, it needs to get panned, none of the reviews I've seen as yet have presented anything but clearly defined "here is what I know, and here is what I think" which isn't..bad? At all? 
---
This is a fucking _horrible_ decision, and they need _all the pressure that can be thrown at them_, and if youtubers "shaping popular opinion" Help pressure the game studio into _keeping their fucking word_ that's a _good_ thing??
---
Why would someone respond to you when you‚Äôre being hostile and name calling?
---
What a plot twist 
---
I'm glad you are still enjoying the game. Hopefully gamers such as yourself who are going to continue enjoying/playing fo76  an steer Bethesda in the right direction. 
---
Can you not tag them in every single post? It's not helpful and just rude.
---
Some people just seem to love throwing around "pay to win". People seem to forget that there are perks to reduce costs. Not to mention that atom shop repair kits don't repair 200% like the one you get from a queen. Not to mention you can get atoms really easily. 
---
Honestly, even if repair kits were FREE in the atom shop I wouldn't care because I always like my armor and weapons at 200%.
---
Ok, im sorry for calling you stupid, and i know this tiny little thing in theory doesnt really matter, but its about the principle of it, if we allow this then itll get worse and worse, and were better off stomping this down before it gets out of hand.  
---
This can easily spark a downward trend of allowing more and more stuff that is technically p2w into the shop, then making the game free to play because they can make so much more money from doing that and selling gear in the shop.  
---
Also pay to win doesnt mean you *have* to spend money to win, its simply giving you the ability to, yes we all earn atoms slowly, but what if these were really high priced? Pay 1000 atoms for 1 for instance, can people afford to fork out for that? Thats about a week and a half of daily and weekly challenged to get that many atoms, that could be acquired on the spot by someone putting an extra ¬£10 into the game, that gives that person an unfair advantage over other players who dont spend money on them.  
---
Also what about if i want these repair items but i also want the camp items, now i have to choose between a cosmetic item that i was aware i would have to save for or a new game play cjanging item that id need to buy to keep up with players who have brought them.  
---
Basically to cut a long story short it opens up a wolrd of hurt to the casual gamer who most people are and allows only the richest gamers to fully enjoy the game.  
---
And as someone who brought the Power Armor edition you wouldnt like it if i had an unfair advantage that my power arnour breaks 50% slower compared to people who didnt buy it
---
I posted this on the twitter about a couple months ago i was doing the same thing and all i got was negative comments saying i was no better than dupers for destroying duped gear.
---
I am way more upset by the player vending. Everyone is cursing them for the new thing, but they buried this at the bottom, and almost no one seems to care. These repair kits dont effect my gameplay, other than it's nice to fix during a silo launch. 
---
Everyone wants to share opinions on ethics, I just want my storage space back. I'm sick of holding on to stuff already.
---
Supposedly its one of, if not THE best dungeons Beth has conjured up, which is exciting.
---
I really hope that Sheepsquarch is as gnarly as the folklore details.
---
Kinda explains why ballistic fiber is such a bitch to get.
---
It‚Äôs true.  
---
You survived without repair kits when you were level 20.
---
Or just go where verdant season is and start farming radstag and other hide bearing critters. 
---
I have defended this game to a fault.  This crosses a line that I can't look away from.  At the very least, refund full purchase price if it goes this direction.
---
What level are you and what platform?
---
Yeah. Exactly my point, plenty of people would pay out of their wallet to buy cool skins, they just have to make them, which I know isn't as easy as just saying "do it" but still.
---
Well, mostly because game developers are pulling shady shit like, oh, this? And shady shit like multiple DLC packs for $30+ each, and...so on, so at the end of the day, even with a "$60" price tag, most games end up being $80+, for similar (or, sometimes, less) content than you could have gotten for $60 ten years ago. 
---
Playing devils advocate here..  but what if it's not instant? What if it took 30seconds to use the repair kit. Or even, make it adventure mode only, or you can only carry 1. 
---
I'm against pay to win, but there are lots of ways this could be limited to "pay for single player convenience"
---
Meant to add if you pick up new junk before you get to the bag, then it resets to the new bag
---
Do u miss the part where they want to add ways to send things back to ur stash?
---
Guess what bet those will be in the atomic shop too...
---
I've had bots do the same... Must be an improperly places spawn point... Although if you look at it it's about the size of a small room so maybe someone forgot to add a door? Lol I cleared them out after laughing a few grenades and hacking up anyone who got to the edge.
---
Oh, is there pay to win?  I thought we were all repairing our own gear to 200% for a handful of materials laying around the world to be picked up freely. :p
---
My fellow vault dwellers, this is the perfect human being. Instead of asking or getting gifts, he gets the enjoyment of giving and only receiving the happy feeling of someone else‚Äôs happiness. Happy birthday my guy, keep being good because there aren‚Äôt many good folks left.
---
Meh, whatever it‚Äôs fine. 
---
I won't claim to know how much up keeping a game costs. But if PAX is anything to go by, then 76 is already a financial success. So why do they need to add mechanics like this?
---
Invincibility, and I have video evidence of this. Being shot repeatedly, their health bar constantly regenerating, and having no health left and still not dying, to then just repeatedly kill me. I have all the videos on xbox, I just don't know how to share them online 
---
What makes you think tagging them over and over again in every post is helpful?  Harassing people is not the best way to get their assistance. They can see all the posts without it.
---
I think the issue being is too many people trying to demand how they want the game, I find that if we‚Äôre gonna get a proper AAA game out of this we‚Äôre gonna have to let them make a few rash decisions that will make sure the full future of this game can happen I‚Äôm not in support of p2w but I do support the micro transactions they need funds to make it happen or we have to pay for future dlc 
---
Your post is bad, and you should feel bad.
---
It‚Äôs a sign of desperation and failure. 
---
RIP my sweet fallouts. 
---
Burn in hell bethesda... for now.
---
I actually am gonna check this one out. I don‚Äôt like the idea of this being okay in the game. It‚Äôs way to slippery a slope cause if fridges and converters get added as well then we are approaching pay to win territory. People just have to keep being vocal about it and not let it die down. 
---
When survival got announced people were really vocal about not wanting characters moved but only for a day or two. Then they left moveable characters in. If people really want Bethesda to notice this has to keep up for at least a week. 
---
I‚Äôm happy to sell you some more cores. Again. And again. And again. 
---
On a serious note, that sucks and sorry to hear it :/
---
Still waiting for mine *cough cough
---
No , I never said griefers were scum , I said they weren‚Äôt. 
---
Might be a language barrier I can‚Äôt tell.
---
Oh how contrarian of you!
---
Very cool,
---
Very legal.
---
Agreed. But they didn't care about all of the "I quit" posts clogging the board every patch day for a while, so I doubt they'll do anything.
---
Don't worry, I do, bout to delete it
---
I've seen it said quite a bit. It was a more relevant argument before they fixed the weapon conditions. Now that your stuff won't break after 10 mins (for the most part), repair kits aren't even that necessary. You won't need them if you use the workbenches scattered around as you go do whatever you do
---
Yup pretty much avoid knuckleheads 
---
You have to stop.  You're in 8-10 posts adding nothing to the conversation just tagging the mods over and over. That's how you get them to go away and ignore you.
---
I'm still hoping that a wrong choice of words made the news sound differently than intended. Basically I hope that the intention is to not put the repair kits on Atom shop and that it's only an error in the text. Maybe the plans for the kits can be as promotion unlocked from the shop for free for the fist week? Because if not, than it's a big departure from the original promise. If this game is really heading the route of non-cosmetic items in the store, then I will consider no longer playing the game. I've been strong supporter for the game since release. No controversy or outrage had me even contemplate the idea of dropping the game... now this is a dealbreaker.
---
Thank you for the well wishes. 
---
‚ÄúI REGRET NOTHING ‚Äú!
---
There is a very simple solution here. Have the developers churn out tons of atom shop stuff. Price it decently.  People will buy it!
---
I bet the atom shop sold more excavator power armor paint plans than any other single atom store item since launch.....BY FAR!! You know why? Because people had been asking for it for months!! I bought atoms last weekend to get the fricken' combat knife skin for god sake.  I bought atoms to get the lever action skin a few weeks ago.
---
People have been asking for gun skins for months. Guaranteed if they dropped a skin for the handmade that looked like an AR-15 it would make Bethesda an insane amount of money!!!!!  
---
Bethesda------------------here's the short list of cosmetic stuff-
---
\-ultracite power armor skin
---
\-handmade skin
---
\-combat rifle skin
---
\-raider outfits
---
\-responder outfits
---
\-bos outfits
---
\-mystery faction male outfit
---
\-faction flags
---
\-log cabin building set
---
\-bunker building set
---
\-tree house building set
---
\-metal Quonset building
---
\-camouflage netting
---
\-nuka cola anything
---
I have no problem spending money on atoms if it helps with game development and future DLC. I will not support pay two win tactics and most of the fans of this game won't either.
---
What?  You pvp in power armor?  Don‚Äôt other players tear through your tin can so fast you‚Äôd never have time to worry about repairing your weapon?  Do you have camp vs camp tower Fortnite style battles?  ;)
---
Test this out once you place your camp. Log out and then back in. Then have the other person do the same. The game will often let you build your camp close by another person's, but when you try to reload them it will think they are too close and give you the can't place camp message.
---
Yes, I‚Äôm dying to buy some nice Power Armor skins but the few they have are not very appealing to me. Also, I‚Äôve already bought all the CAMP items I wanted and I had no problem buying Atoms. If the cosmetic content is there, people will pay. I personally don‚Äôt see the need for repair kits and wouldn‚Äôt pay for them.
---
Only pack rat but even when I turn off that perk the weight is still .75 in inventory and 3 in stash 
---
ah my bad!
---
Why is this community a bunch of whiners? Let them do wtf they want to do.
---
No one cared about the unstoppables thing.  In fact the sub routinely ridiculed YouTubers that made 'Bethesda pay to win' videos about it.  That's why you didn't know about it. It was never an issue.
---
Yeah I'm not looking forward to my FB feed reinvigorated with a newly found criticism of F76, and this time I might have to side with them.
---
My opinion on this is that Im all for it as long as we will be able to craft them or find them in game as well.  I play ESO as well and they have repair kits that range in level that repair single items available to buy from npcs in game but they also have crown repair kits available to buy with their "real money" currency called crowns that repair everything you have equipped to 100%.  Dont know how many times being able to buy one of those really quickly from the store in the middle of a hard dungeon and other situation has saved both my ass and my groups asses.  
---
Ah the socialist gamer. Wants equality for all and everything given to him by the game maker. Sorry bud but Bethesda is a business and businesses want to get paid. 
---
I could care less about this as long as they continue to put out decent content, continue to patch and fix issues, keep the game fun and bring on new challenges.
---
Take a look at ESO. They have have an ESO plus membership that many players pay for that provides many things beyond cosmetics. That game is still going strong for 5 years now.
---
What does that have to do with this?
---
If you got this covered then I won't bother looking for ya. Else I'll be on in about 45 mins or so.
---
Horizon‚Äôs Rest and Helvetia.  Can walk away with 50+ screws and a bunch of other stuff.  All low level stuff in the Forest.  
---
There is alway a workbench around. Somewhere. 
---
I 100% agree with this. Placing an item that streamlines play in the atom shop is a step toward a "pay to win" model I don't care for. I am all for repair kits being in the game, but the fact that they'd be purchasable with atoms means I can spend cash to avoid in-game downtime. Fuck any game that does that. That's some freemium iPad shovelware shit.
---
Same with anything that gives a mechanical advantage. Fridges to keep your food from rotting that cost atoms? That *might* be one thing if it is a one-time purchase but really something that ought to be a quest reward. Or hell, lock that stuff behind a DLC with a bunch of extra things to do and special utility items to unlock.
---
But consumable items that give an advantage being purchasable for real-world money is just... Awful
---
And materials
---
I've been able to create almost rounded walls....   It took a while of experimentation but if you want a curved wall....  You use Brick doors and concrete foundations on alternating sides.  There are youtube tutorials for this, so check it out first....
---
1. You need the brick building set for this as it has an overlap due to the way the bricks.  It hides it if your angles are off by a bit.
---
2. You need a large flat open area in a low level location because you'll be moving foundations around for a while to get the angles right.
---
3. You'll need around 100x concrete plus the contractor 2 perk card.  I found that when laying down and storing foundations a lot that sometimes they get lost.  
---
4. Layout 20x concrete foundations in a 360 degree pattern (basically, you are laying out four sections of 5x foundations in a 90 degree L pattern).  You can make the wall longer by adding 8x foundations to make a 28x foundation 360 degree wall (four sections of 7x foundations in a 90 degree L pattern)
---
5. Keep the 4x middle foundations, these will be your keystones, and move all of the others out of the way or store them.  Use the Brick wall doors (yes, you have to use doors) and put them on the outside edge (away from the middle) of the 4x foundations.  
---
6. Take 3x foundations (or 5x if you are going for a larger wall) and line them up at angles so they look like they are equal and just touching, then place brick doors.  You'll know if they are lining up right by the way the joins look on the outside and inside and, if you have marsupial, if you get on top of the wall, or use stairs if you don't.
---
7. You can then line up foundations in a cross pattern, with the center block in the center of the circle, from each door, leaving the keystone doors in place (this is important), and placing the doors on the opposite sides.  This is where you move the foundations around a lot, leaving the doors floating.  Also, try to make sure your doors are level.  This is best seen from the top of the wall.
---
8. Once all of the joins look right and the angles look right, you are almost done.  Don't get me wrong, this takes a lot of practice and patience, especially with the PS4 and the controller.  This is one area where the PC guys have a huge advantage of the fine control of a mouse.
---
9. Leave the doors floating but move all of the foundations out of the way.  Place a foundation at one of the doors, then place one on the outside of that door.  Take the inside foundation and move it two doors over, then place an outside foundation.  Do this all the way around, placing an outside foundation every other door.
---
10. Once the outside foundations are in place, place the inside foundations at every other door.  
---
11. Blueprint it as a 360 degree wall, making sure to tag all of the components.  Once it's blueprinted, view the blueprint to make sure nothing was missed.
---
12. Blueprint a 180 degree wall and a 90 degree wall and a 45 degree wall.  Do some odd angle ones too.  You can never have enough blueprints and you really don't want to do this again.  Believe me, it takes a lot of precise placement to get this right.
---
13. Store everything.
---
14. Place the 180 degree wall from the blueprint.  
---
15. All of the outside foundations will be forced to the inside causing an overlap and making the outside a clean circular style pattern.
---
16. Re-blueprint it, so that you can plunk it down on uneven terrain later.  The outside foundations of the original add to the terrain placement issues.  The clean version makes it easier to place.  You can also use this version to re-blueprint the 180 degree, 90 degree, 45 degree, and other versions.
---
17. You now have "round walls" that you can use for building.
---
Oh look.. there you are again.  You should add something to the conversation instead of just harassing the devs. I'd ignore you, too, if you tagged me 12 times in a few hours.
---
There are a lot of them. But it‚Äôs not always a weapon bench. 
---
but you know and I know that you're only half the man that I am. And I have half the brain that you do! But week after week you've tried to make me look like a jackass
---
The wording doesn't seem that they're unlockable, it's that they're purchasable. That is, it's not going to be a thing you can make, it will be a drop or a purchase. 
---
Imagine if they did this with stims
---
I just upvote you. Trying to get in the conversation is a complete waste of energy. They will still be scared like sheeps.
---
Those who know the game inside out will still have armor and weapon at 200% for almost zero effort.
---
the thing is, you make a lot more money on YouTube talking about how bad x game is than how good games are. I honestly don't like the decision to add a paid item to the shop, but I feel that fallout 76 and other games have been unfairly condemned by a lot of people who would have otherwise enjoyed it because the YouTube hate cycle has 2000 videos about how shit the game is and hardly any about the actually good parts of 76.
---
In my opinion it's the cosmetic items themselves that were the first step in this slippery slope. Trivial as they are, they should just be injected straight into the game for free. Yes FREE. This is Bethesda, not some indie startup. And it's a franchise that has ALREADY proved its sustainability. I cant entertain any arguments about where the money will come. The money will come. Make the investment. Please your customer base who are also your FANS. 
---
Or at least we WERE your fans until the dollar signs started reflecting in your eyes. Me and Bethesda go way back. All the way back to ES1:Arena. And I feel very VERY let down. I remember when Todd promised that ES would never go online or multiplayer. His reasoning for it was sound. Still is. But he couldn't resist the buckets of money floating around online, apparently. Greed. Microtransactions are a cancer on the industry which DIRECTLY and NEGATIVELY affects the gaming experience. The relationship between art and capitalism is already an unfortunate but necessary evil. Microtransactions takes the industry further in the WRONG direction but without the necessity. Just greed. And I would love for my old friends at Bethesda to make me proud and rise above that.  
---
A similar thing happened to me (except I totally deserved itttttt) if you move your camp everything will store in it but you'll have to rebuild it 
---
Actually as far as I‚Äôm aware it‚Äôd make Pete Hines a liar, if I remember right he was the most vocal one about the whole ‚Äúno p2w in the atom shop‚Äù semantics I know but it‚Äôd be funny if Pete was the one who got shit this time 
---
I am extremely confused as to what you mean
---
See I think everyone read that wrong they said other player ideas like fridges ect.. not that the fridges would be in the atom shop...and I do not support the repair kit's just saying I think everyone needs to reread that part
---
Dude, I though we were supposed to be preventimg suicides, not encouraging them D:
---
Maybe if you tagged them a few dozen more times everything will be fixed! You know how people love to be relentlessly hounded.
---
Fair. But how many CAMPs are around you at any given time? 
---
You also don‚Äôt need the materials if you have a repair kit.
---
That‚Äôs the big deal.
---
Not that it saves time by not forcing a player to go to a workbench
---
That‚Äôs what people are mad about
---
"if Bethesda goes through with this ridiculous, greedy, thoughtless money grab, we boycott the atomic shop until it‚Äôs fully cosmetic once again."
---
You're missing the whole point of the shop and the game mate
---
A lot of people are complaining about the future of atomic shop items. It was supposed to be cosmetic only so who knows what they might add to the shop next. People are mainly worried about that.
---
Every piece of clothing you purchase in the Atomic Shop is craftable, undroppable, and untradeable.  I think it sounds very much like a craftable item that you unlock through the Atomic Shop.
---
Some of the perks were nerfed recently and now they're selling you repair kits. You think they'll stay the same?
---
In a active server, it‚Äôs difficult to not be number 1 every 15 minutes. I can‚Äôt level without being hunted. I like the idea of less restrictions but I feel the leader board is garbage. It shouldn‚Äôt be called survival if the main intent is straight up PVP.
---
Is this all you did today?
---
Imagine you have to spend 10 hours grinding to get materials to repair your gun, or spend $5. 
---
That's where this eventually leads. 
---
Sleazy fucks. 
---
Honestly, with what you've shown here I do think your account was flagged by an automatic system. Unfortunately, I really don't think Bethesda may look into your account or unsuspend it. 
---
HOWEVER, I only say that not because I think Bethesda is evil, but I firmly believe it would open a whole new can of worms if they start looking into some cases but not all of them. It's honestly sounds like a headache trying to go through all appeals of people declaring their innocence.
---
Unfortunately, I believe Bethesda just through out some system to automatically suspend people who fit under a certain criteria regardless of any evidence that you may show.
---
Unless Bethesda makes a official statement on suspensions that's the way I see it. Only God Howard knows how long these suspensions may be. 
---
It's similar to bdo's situation. In bdo you  can try to upgrade your weapon and when it fails it degrades. So you have to repair it with this special item. Well if you pay 20 bucks you can repair it basically 4x as fast which saves you a months worth of grinding. So here we can get repair kits off scorch beasts MAYBE or we can just pay and skip the hours of grinding. Though inferior still saving grind time. If they limit us from server hopping it will become a crutch.
---
If people would follow youtubers that are honest then this kind of youtuber wouldnt exist. But people like those who shit on every game.
---
I dunno man.  I feel like Steve Erkel would have some kind of Home Alone alarm system on steroids setup.  You'll end at the bottom of some stairs covered in silly string.  "Did I do thaaaat?" faintly in the distance as you black out. 
---
Left?
---
Repair kit ring a bell?
---
Over blown reaction to an item that has as much impact as a cosmetic. None. 
---
This isn't them trying to gradually ease you into paying for everything.
---
It's them asking lazy stupid people to give them money. 
---
So be it.
---
Pretty sad that this is an issue to begin with. Only the crappy 100% Repair kits will be in the shop. The better, 150% ones have to be obtained in game, and neither can repair as well as the 200% I do at a workstation
---
The point you were making was just as irrelevant. I was trying to help you understand what people have a problem with. My bad. No need to be an ass hat. 
---
Dude learn how assasin sentinel armor works... 
---
I literally never know. They aren‚Äôt on the map. But what is the point you are trying to make?
---
Bethesda said themselves in the Inside the Vault that it‚Äôs intended for more mobile on-the-go repairing. 
---
As the true heir to the iron throne, Stannis Beratheon would say:
---
Well. Things are going "well"
---
It is the principle that matters here. They promised no P2W in cash shop, so we want them to keep to that promise.
---
There is a bigger picture here in regards to the repair kits. It isn‚Äôt so much the fact that they provide a small in-game advantage, but rather they will act as precedent for introducing more P2W items into the shop further down the road.
---
Yeah ik, it‚Äôs so weird how you can‚Äôt understand what they are saying, while they are screaming through the broken gas masks. It‚Äôs so weird. üòñ
---
You know that these sorts of decisions are publisher-mandated, right? the Devs don't have final say on the majority of the shit put into their game. 
---
The issue is not the item functionality but that it puts them on the slippery slope to P2W.  Being on the slope isn't a guaranty that it will happen but it makes it more likely.  The best thing is to never get on the slope in the first place.  
---
I‚Äôd do it, but I‚Äôm away from my PC right now
---
Same, since they have a 10 turret limit now you cant make bigger budgets a p2w thing, your at 10 turrets regardless. I know its an engine thing thats holding them back but i still agree if it was an option
---
Especially since you have to go through the "inspect" feature of the Pip-boy to use it.  If it was something you could equip to a hotkey or favorites slot I could see the argument, but most PVP fights would be over by the time you got to use one of these.
---
Not very creative or effective.  If you want someones help typically you explain the problem and then ask them for assistance.  You don't poke them repeatedly until they bruise.
---
I think to many people take you tubers as the word of god
---
Don't think we are buying repair kits. We are buying the plans for the repair kits. Just like every other thing sold. After buying you will then have to craft them with additional materials.

So nukashine was an odd choice for a first dlc I had questions about why. Until I saw the interface for the fermenter, then I understand why. Fermenters were the prototype for player vending. It also broke the game. It was very small and not many people noticed around other things to talk about(good and bad). But there were numerous problems with making a stash container that could access some items but not others and that was with just one player in the mix not (potentially) all 24 with the added complication of cap transactions.
