Oh I think you’ve nailed it. It’s definitely repaired more than 100%.
---

---
Thanks!
---
---
---
If you don't give a shit about Fallout 76, then why are you on the subreddit in the first place? That's like walking into a sewer and complaining it smells like shit.
---
Midwest, Indiana
---
I might get 1 of each, except marsupial, herbivore, bird bones and speed demon
---
Tho first I need caps for paying all them
---
It's just so long you can't see them lol
---
I too have lost track of 3* corpses either because so much was going on or because I kept getting the infinite spinning circle. I would love to see the infinite load circle thing fixed but I would also love to see marker lines on legendary corpses (kind of like in the division or borderlands but just with legendary) or auras or something to help us find them when we lose track or they warp. 
---
Thank you! I want to upgrade my t-51b legs and need more violet flux, but I’m holding off based on the SBQ big.
---
MATN might be my favorite you tuber. But I don't love the idea of being forced to work with teammates, which is the (understandable) way he's going. I'd rather just go back to building on fo4 and waiting for fo5. 
---
Lol. funny seeing this post.  Last night I got tired of all the notes cluttering my stash and inventory so I loaded up a supply crate with all of the notes I didn't care to keep anymore.  
---
Melee can sometimes reset the bug. Its weird
---
The “git gud” argument is laughable with this many people reporting the exact same thing.
---
Gt?
---
my base used to have a door until a deathclaw wanted in
---
Looking forward to the “Scorchbeast Queens are no longer immortal” patch note.
---
You deserve an upvote. Way to look out for noobs such as myself and other farmers. 
---
Better yet you will be called “entitled” for standing up to the turret camp crowd.  
---
The missile turrets represent a higher level of douchebaggery.  Nicely done! 
---
Geez, did you just crawl out from under a rock?!
---
:P
---
How much would that make? 
---
Can't remember which days but we had the exact same thing happen twice in the past week
---
While this one was happening it both froze and then crashed. I’ve also only done one nuke run.
---
Are we still doing this? These posts come up all the time in CSGO and everyone stopped caring cause we know they're all bullshit. FO76 is under a microscope so these posts are getting a ton of attention now cause everyone's looking for a chance to shit on this game even more. Every online game has these "I was falsely banned" post but FO76 gets the most hate for it cause everyone's just looking for any reason to hate Bethesda right now.
---
Out of curiosity, did you ever decide to try that technique on a larger scale? Just wondering. I have 2 alt characters that I want to delete permanently but don't want to lose the items and caps unless I have to.
---
Well you can see her health bar, and you can see energy weapon projectiles. So keep an eye on the health bar when the energy projectiles are flying.
---
Awesome thanks!
---
You know that completely fair. 
---
Yea its ok tho, exciting stuff! I cant wait for the backpacks and the legendary vendor. Every Thursday they do inside the vault, last week was on Friday tho. 
---
This is over a week old, and your like the third person to post it as "new" today
---
Ok he’s showing up now like all the time. He’s pretty cool, damage is nothing to gawk at but the fact that he draws attention is pretty cool. Doing it with a pistol and he shows up a lot
---
Yeah the legendaries dropping no loot or a drill/syringer have been bugging me forever. And out of maybe 10 3* enemies only 2 of them dropping 2 or 3 star loot or a drill is frustrating
---
Armor and less common weapons learn mods way to slowly, I agree. I like your idea that using them and repairing them should have a chance at granting you a plan, at the very least repairing them.
---
I’m not exactly tripping over Single Actions, Lever Actions, handmades 10mm smgs etc.
---
Unless I want to burn the materials to build and destroy them over and over again to get plans I really don’t have a good way of learning them at a rate that won’t take years. 
---
So they shouldn’t fix these bugs?
---
lmao. U do realize that other people could be shooting at her right?
---
Yep same here when I was there doing the story mission
---
Congratulations, you discovered the very first instance in history that bethseda messed up
---
Consoles are hard to get hot fixes on for whatever reason. Expect it in the next large update. If they figure out how to fix it by then, I mean
---
LAST NIGHT I LAUNCHED MY FIRST NUKE(SOLO) AND THE SERVER CRASHED AS I APPROACHED THE BLAST ZONE SOMETHING I WAITED 6 WHOLE PATCHES TO NOT HAVE THIS HAPPEN, AND IT HAPPENED! 
---
Pro-tip: I think since my luck is only at 2 on this character, i have to accept it for what it is and backwardsly somehow hope if i launch with 15 luck ill become fallout god. What absurd logic i posit eh?
---
Be careful its addicting lol. I go to sleep at night to the thought of all the legendary drops I got that day.
---
Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:

Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title.

 No. I did almost kill a level 65 one that jumped me and landed. It almost died but took off just in time. Ran like a scared rabbit and I chased it across the bog until I literally ran into a Mirelurk Queen, all 2 stories of her. ;) I briefly though about stabbing her but ran instead. ;)
---
Give them all stupid hats so I know who to shoot
---
No. Why should one legendary become the best in the game, hands down? That’s not anything remotely resembling balance. You just want to feel overpowered. 
---
If someone joined the event, it will usually respawn a SB.  Had it happen to my wife TWICE on a single defend workshop event because we were teamed up with some lowbie friends who THOUGHT they were coming to help 0.o
---
Wondering the same shit right now 
---
I don't care about the rewards tbh. I'd rather people just watch the video and support Jon in any way possible. Whether that's subscribing to him on YouTube, donating via Patreon, or just watching and sharing the video.
---
MATN is my favourite YouTuber and is a decent guy. Support him rather than some random nobody who posted the video here.
---
Cool. Jumping on now.  You still available?
---
I have been saving for two things... The eventual player vending, and more immediately, because I like to help newer players along.  On any given day I'll give away a few thousand rounds of ammo... A few hundred purified water... Bill building supplies... Starter sets of armor/weapons...
---
So yeah... That box stays filled.
---
I mean I agree but I also think there would be a ton of overlap in names.
---
The bounty has been claimed.  I will be doing more of these events in the future! Thanks for everyone who came out and played!  Special thanks to LimitedDub, HAMRismy and PandaExperience for assisting, and congratulations to Raider\_Legend who claimed the bounty.
---
Fus Roh NOOT NOOT!!!
---
25,000
---
Im on now. Lets roll.
---
...and? I'm not trying to be rude but your post just stops. Imagine reading half a book and the other half is missing. It's annoying. TELL ME HOW THE BOOK ENDS.
---
The game is great. It did help that I only spent $30 on it. 
---
Just to clarify, we're not actually friends. We've spoken several times, I'm a mod on /r/manyatruenerd, appeared in a few videos and livestreams and I've met him in person at EGX Rezzed, but we're not friends. I'm just a well known community member.
---
I'm at work, and don't really care too hunt you down if i was at home. But, I do enjoy how getting your buddy /alt account to let people join the world is a solid idea.
---
I hope this all goes well for you and I'll probly check out the stream just for kicks
---
Honestly, I just kind of made mine up as I went along lol.  I'm honestly not any good with pre-planned builds because I did not pre-plan mine. It's hard to 'plan' a build like you could in the other games, because you don't start out with a certain amount of points in each category. 
---
 Here's something I found on youtube. The video isn't mine, but I think it's useful in explaining how builds work.
---
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfB9rk_BAUU
---
Thanks I guess I better just scrap all my junk I was wondering why I was not getting anything when selling random junk I no longer need
---
Go back to the Whitesprings bunker. The red computer in the room with the Pentagon table will give you a quest to get another.
---
See, I used to do that in fallout 4... but how can you get significantly doped up now?  Combo chems like psychobuff, with some food and drink, maybe a bottle of vodka or wine in the side... that's about as doped up as it gets.  Early on I would eat 3 or 4 chems before a sb fight and it took a while to realize only the last one I took was actually counted... I think 2 chem effects at once wouldn't be too much to ask...
---
I wish there was a mod for the ones that wear propane tanks for helmets and they all just talk like hank hill 
---
You are more than welcome, we are trying to build a fun fallout community.  We do queens often and try to have a lot of fun messing around in Appalacia!  Everyone is welcome to join us!
---
No, I did not consider that. Clearly I think I'm the only one doing damage and am amazing. You're a genius for pointing out the very thing I didnt consider.
---
and when you die. you drop all your gear
---
That's awesome! I'm still sure there's a way to make room for all the bulk. I had to make room when the Great Unworking Bulk Snafu of 2019 happened last month. Lol. You can figure it out until they get it patched
---
It's at the raiders vendor train station  near the ski slope. Every time for me
---
Cheers 
---
I know but I never see that happen when I use it
---
I've posted before saying I might get the game and just updating that I like it now that I have it. The story is unfinished because I'm only level 10 with so much left to explore and do. I may edit my post and add more/post pictures of my CAMP in the near future. 
---
scrap tour junk and turn it into bulk, you’ll see which yield the most caps.
---
also keep an eye out for assaultron heads- they waste a lot of stash space and are not scrapped when u scrap all junk.
---
It’s moved to paper bags now too...
---
Yep, O918 
---
O is the letter
---
Honestly, I'd just focus on investing in strength.   If you have 15 strength, you can swamp out melee, shot guns, and heavy guns. 
---
1. Wrong subreddit, this isn't a marketplace
---
2. Required?  Did you mean requested?
---
3. Such a specific weapon, basically god tier roll... good luck on that one buddy, hope you have a full set of vanguards to trade for it 
---
Maybe it just doubles your available accuracy?  Like if you had a 5% chance then 100% added you'd have a 10% chance? Idk sorry thought maybe you got rid of the item and couldn't remember what it said?  Got me curious now.  I just never went for that prefix cause didn't want my shots to cost more. 
---
clearly you do. since apparently you can tell the difference in how much damage your doing with similar weapons on SBQ when other players are also doing damage to her.
---
Oh damn I didnt realize only one chem could be taken at a time. Unless I'm wrong. I've been loading up on chems like its water, didnt know I was wasting effect potential. Maybe that's why we have bufftats, calmed, fury, and other combo drugs now as it has multi effects?
---
Does anyone have the codes for this week?
---
Even unique Enclave legendary mods for energy weapons would be neat.
---
Walking around this huge map..... ain’t nobody got time for that.
---
you can. wut.
---
At work!
---
You need to hold him there for another 6 hours thanks.
---
500 for the .45?
---
Assultron head scraps to wrapped assultron head which scraps to junk.. not like it's annoying but theres 2 stages to assultron heads lol
---
Thanks, i had since figured this out.
---
Supporting a billion dollar company because you "like underdogs" is the most pathetic thing imaginable. 
---
"I GOT CAUGHT CHEATING, BUT IT'S FOR THE WRONG ITEMS! THESE ARE THE ITEMS I REALLY PICKED UP &amp; KEPT!" 
---
*posts incriminating evidence* 
---
Imo the game has some issues but that doesn't stop it being fun as fuck
---
I play mostly solo and I have a great time. If the game feels lonely I watch a YouTube video on my other monitor
---
I think this would really help sell that game mode as a way to play aimed strictly at sado/masochists.
---
Gahahahah 
---
I got distracted after about 15 minutes. He was heading past the top of the world 😂
---
I've played up to level 16 so far and have played completely solo. I don't understand why people think you must team up to play.
---
Or the stuff they broke two weeks ago ie psychopath Grimm sprint four clover SMH 
---
Yeah I'm fine with scrapping. Was just wondering the cap limit as I sell armour that I get. Thanks everyone anyway
---
*Eyy, another year! * It's your **7th Cakeday** LtBlamBlam! ^(hug)
---
DUCK YEAH!
---
Most likely. I don’t use chems period, I usually just sell them 
---
Takin a tad longer than usual, can I get an 8:00?
---
It is a pvp mode. You aren't forced to play it
---
I’ve never had one attack my munitions factory 
---
Yeah these are all server lag issues. It's like this for every nuke zone i run. Also ppl incompletely looting bodies adds to the lag. I dont want pre wat money either but i scoop it all up and deconstruct it later to try and reduce the lag as much as possible.
---
 There are non survival servers. Come on now.
---
My comment was less about the level disparity, but more about someone who had those levels and simply chose to be a dick.
---
What perks are you using to get melee that high?
---
Me as well
---
Then leave. 
---
Is there an error code?  
---
Is your firewall blocking it for some reason?
---
When support does nothing then what?  They aren’t going to refund your game purchase.
---
I mentioned that earlier to my pals, about picking it all up. I pick other peoples meat piles up too when they drop in for me. 
---
Like the other people said, Grafton generally has them. I was awarded them from an event. 
---
I drop them at front of v76.
---
 The stars are the individual Legendary effects. So a 3 star has three effects, a 1 star only one. ;(
---
Find a mute button, AND don't piss on the toilet seat. Or at least clean up after yourself if you don't know how to aim and/or lift the damned seat. Haha.
---
There was an armor glitch where you put your weight limit in the negatives, I've never duped but I have used that bc it was incredibly useful (patched now)
---
inconsistent..sometimes non-legendary enemies will drop 3*
---
Banning players for bugs in their game, instead of doing proper QA. Pathetic.
---
Nah.  The huge bridge south of Flatwoods with the south-end locked room (near the creamery) that you get the key for from the roller coaster at Camden Park.  The other is the junkyard workshop East of 76 with the black titanium resource.  Think it's the Gorge Junkyard.
---
Playing devils advocate here but what proof is there that you didn’t just throw this bag of stuff on the ground and took screen shots of it pretending you found it? Still think you’re not telling the truth.
---
wait really? how do i do this??
---
On my way to your server. Whereabouts are ya?
---
SOBs is what melee players do when fighting them.
---
Ppl that complain "more lifeless holotapes and notes" are either to young to remeber having to read on a game or dont know how to read at all. 
---
I love grenades.  They're great for opening and pulling aggro.
---
Ahhhhhh new river gorge bridge. I've never seen PA there or gorge junkyard 
---
If you'r on xbox i can come to the rescue :)
---
Admittedly, their numbers arent all the way accurate, to that SINGLE drop. However, having read the entire thread for your other comments, you knew these were duped items, and still took them for use. That makes you just as guilty as the ones who duplicated them.
---
If you want something to complain about, find something that actually affects the gamepl--- oh, I'm sorry, you cant do that, you got banned. Oh well.
---
I vendor all of mine 
---
All legendaries heal at halfway.  The exception is if you do an attack that kills in one hit or if you use something like furious that takes out just above 50% health and then second hit kills, you never see the heal.  It is also possible with a very fast weapon to take a legendary down without it healing.
---
Yeah, someone did the math and it was something like 1 in 500,000 chance you'd get the legendary drop you want. I'm not even sure if that included getting boned by non-max gear.
---
We *really* need the Purveyor. 
---
I played all of the beta and have a level 102 and a level 65.  I’d pass if I were you.  Maybe try it out in 3-4 months if/when they have player vending, legendary scrapping, and you can actually kill and loot the enemies. (Referring to the server-side damage ignore bugs that manifest as “healing”, and spinny-loot, respectively)
---
If you want a post-apocalyptic shooter rpg with holotapes and solid world building where you feel you are part of rebuilding society, I’d sincerely suggest The Division 2 when it comes out in a few weeks
---
Hope this helps
---
Do you have a moment to talk about our lord and savior RNGsus? 
---
Rng hates you :(
---
This is still the favorite weapon bug as well. I have to reequip my second handmade every time I log in.
---
Nice iteration on Jug's round Whitesprings camp.
---
Hey your one of the moderators of r/Amish right?
---
Duping only exists because of Bethesda.
---
You don't stop exploits by going after users, you patch them out ASAP. Maybe even have a free Beta if your game is this much of a dumpster fire.
---
I'm surprised that legs aren't included as a weakness for more than Mirelurk Queens and Radscorps.
---
Protectrons are weak in the legs and take more damage there. 
---
Assaultrons can lose their legs and be rendered immobile, pretty good given how mobile assaultrons are. 
---
Ghouls legs was a weakness in Fallout 4 and while you can't amputate the leg as easily in 76, slowing them down to a slow shuffle defangs the ghouls greatest ability to charge at you at great speed.
---
Quad explosive handmade with +1 perception. I about this my pants and then looked at the lvl and about threw my controller through my tv screen
---
I was just saying this.... Regular SB drop crap. I can kill a deathclaw or mothman easier and get better loot.
---
Pass.
---
Dangit I'm on ps4 :/
---
I just learned this lesson myself. :( Disappointing.
---
Google Fallout once and get 56% upvoted Reddit content. Ooooh k
---
I've got the same bug.  It's been broken for me since launch.  Sometimes it even has a marker in the basement, although there is no basement to the post office.
---
Can I just keep hating them for releasing buggy crap and turning Fallout into Elder Scrolls: Wasteland?
---
Rose? Is that you?

---
That was a different redditor. I dont remember his reddit name but it was glorf or something similar, not this dude. 
---
Google's black boxes have latched onto the fo76 whiners and considers anybody complaining about the game to be newsworthy.
---
Their algorithms have committed to amplifying the negative feedback loop because it leads to people clicking on ads.
---
Fuuuuuck!!!
---
I've never gotten a worthwhile drop. I find my time better spent cruising the subs for good shit for sale.
---
I really hope they do this whole legendary vendor/trade in thing right. I want to play the game, but all there is to do for me at this point is do my daily vendor run before I go to work. Like you said, grinding for legendaries is downright demoralizing.
---
That simply shows a bad connection to the server and then the legendary healing like it should.  You have a very clear point where your video actually skips that even shows your connection is bad.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
For anyone watching, the point where the video skips is right at 19 seconds.  
---
We should be able to upgrade legendary gear up to level 50.
---
I’ve killed a couple ghouls and they run off (literally) before I can loot them.  I’m pretty sure they were sprinting too.  It sucks that i have waste my Action Points chasing down the dead loot bag 
---
Go ahead. Hate them for the legitimate reasons, that doesn't warrant undeserved hate and misinformation surrounding this game just to make it seem worse than it is just to make people hate it more.
---
Yeah, but I'm sure he's going to be a randomised system also. I don't think it will be like, "here's 3 Lvl 50 1* items, I'd like a 3* instigating explosive hunting rifle with faster shooting thankyou". I'm guessing it's going to take like 3 max 3* legendaries to get a new max 3* legendary, item reroll, perks reroll.
---
How about we don’t listen to the idiots.
---
And just play the game.
---
Of course it’s a game mechanic.
---
If it’s NOT?’b
---
Then what? Quit? Or call it a challenge?
---
This game definitely needs text chat! I play at night and will probably never use a mic, I even have voice chat turned off completely most of the time. 
---
Probably you. XD
---
to bad, could have helped you on pc as well :/
---
Someone will read this and help you out, that bit can be tricky, i even had a SB trying to make it even harder on that roof top :/
---
I have mine on the edge of a cliff near a spawn point, in the Forrest.  3 scorched spawn there all the time.  My single elevated turret kills the solo charger all the time.  Feels nice to come home and find meat piles all over my front yard. Lol
---
Actually, trolling on my post because Bethesda gave you a case of the frownies is  You should go to another sub if you don't like it. Your negativity isn't going to change anything, you will never matter to anyone, so stop trying.
---
Its hitting "A" three times just after the second shake.   :)
---
My list 
---
Toxic Valley(Clarksburg, Grafton Dam)
---
Savage Divide(Top of the World)
---
Mire (Harpers Ferry, Valley Galleria)
---
Forest (Point Pleasant)
---
Ash Heap (Camden Park)
---
I been to all if these more than once yet the challenges listing show I haven’t???
---
That’s 270 points missing ?
---
When do plan to fix this issue?
---
Aim for there thrusters 
---
Doesn't med x effect berserker negatively?
---
I'll try that
---
That's there weak point 
---
Yea... makes you do even less damage.
---
He is speaking the language of the gods
---
To each their own.  I like to get a big fat cluster of glowing chubby bastards when Whitespring gets nuked and chuck a couple grenades at them.  Tag every one of them for XP, cripple a few, and take my time with headshots.
---
That's not even its final form!
---
And yet, \[IRL\] we have "Christians" that ***bomb*** abortion clinics (when Jesus said "let he who has not sinned cast the first stone").  And, we have poor white folk in the South, and Rural areas that vote to increase income inequality and take away their own Health Insurance.  
---
It seems that it would be impossible to overestimate the amount of stupidity humans are capable of.
---
Yes after too many queens I have 300 Leather and 300 ultracite and 300 Bone for what!?
---
At least 3.
---
Good to know, Thank you \^\^ I will try and find room for that 
---
Its not giving me another quest the computer has no options to click on 
---
I've started building 2 story buildings... does work tho!
---
I just recently picked up an Instigating combat knife and I must say it is an extremely enjoyable method of killing mobs.  I do feel a bit silly carrying it when I’m in Power Armor though.
---
That’s what I do man. I have great weapons but there were all purchased on here and likely duped lol. 
---
It's on hit, not kill. The .esm file says that miniguns and gatling lasers have a 20% chance per hit to proc. I use a minigun and it doesn't proc nearly this often. I find that it provides some increased service life, but it will not let you use just one gun in a queen fight. My shotgun, on the other hand, procs often enough that I'd think you could use the same gun all fight. This is probably because each shot of the shotgun has multiple opportunities to hit (pellets).
---
I vendored 90 frag and 60 plasma grenades today. I've been looting west tek for steel and plastic haha
---
My favourite way to fuck with turret farmers is just to close the door facing the golf course.
---
Yeah, I hope we have some level of control. Like either we throw something in and retains the weapon/armor type, or it retains only the main legendary prefix and rerolls the weapon/armor and the second and third modifier. If it's totally randomized then, in my opinion, it won't be much of an improvement on the current system.
---
I'm an old raider burnt out from too much jet(it makes you jittery) and other amazing chems and stuck on pre war ballistic weapons. Am I missing something lol
---
Are you sure that you're at the computer I said? I use it all the time for this same quest so I don't see how it would not be working.
---
I have everything pretty set up, so a re-build is gonna have to happen. Which why not! But for that price, I just find that this shouldn't look so bad no matter the direction you place.
---
Hoping to give people a heads up on this \^\^ 
---
i've kept a furious swing speed dagger because it's fun as hell, same as a bloodied swing speed boxing glove lmao
---
Protectrons: Combat Inhibitors / Legs
---
Laserotron: Legs
---
Scorchbeast: Wings
---
Mirelurk: Face, belly, legs
---
Deathclaw: legs, head
---
Colonel Gusty: propeller
---
Omg. I was on for a few minutes doing an enclave bot mission, and noticed the legendary super mutant did the whole insta-heal on himself a few times,  was kinda aggravating,  but figured it was part of his legendary-ness. 
---
No, it's just a bad joke. Rip my humor.
---
It’s pretty hard to come by ultracite so I guess that’s worth it.
---
I agree... bad boxes and joint positioning it seems
---
I found a lvl 35 junkies exploding lever that still kills quite nicely.  It's been my main for over a hundred levels.  What was it?
---
Lol I thought so sorry for ruining the joke lol
---
Fucking dupers get to keep one of everything and I don't even get to keep one of one?
---
Or, do it horizontal, but start with the center letter and work outwards. If it's not a gigantic word, it shouldn't get to the point that it sinks into the wall
---
well come to me in two days and ill drop you 200 leather 200 bone and 200 ultracite
---
It's got about as many issues as any other fallout title. New Vegas had many game ending bugs. Skyrim had progress halting bugs as well. It's weird how it only became so toxic once they tried to appeal to a multiplayer crowd, who have proven themselves again and again to be the worst human beings in the face of the planet. Though I suppose it's worth noting it's not the same Dev team.
---
U on Xbox?
---
Quad explosive handmade with +1 perception. I just gave it to some random noob lol. Probably doesn’t even know what he has
---
Lol
---
I was thinking of doing the same build if they ever introduce a shared stash
---
So what the delay???
---
Meh PC. :( But I do like 10+ queens a day duping with an italian. 
---
Use the letters to write “take some leave some”   I leave a bag there and go about my playing. One day maybe someone will see it. Has lights and arrows pointing to it too 
---
Currently, with a very lightly modded gauss rifle. I can do about 225 damage with all the rifleman perks.  That with having the 2.15% boost from ranged sneak attacks, I can one shot most things. But a huge group will overwhelm me very quickly with it's slow reload and minimal ammo capacity. 
---
I do run Tank Killer too. Haven't found any legendary plasma rifles yet but the Gauss Rifle I had did 224 dmg and it seem really kind of pedestrian so I sold it. Guess I'll have to revisit that one.
---
Hey, after the mission you'll be able to take out your frustrations on any of the bots in Watoga. You might even consider them self delivering metal scrap units in a scrape when you need 1 or 2 pieces of steel scrap. Oh, and the occasional legendary one passing you is an easy earner too
---
Mhmm, that's what I did. Something about the Apostrophe really makes it wonky. I ended up trying to place that one without snapping to make it work. I just thought the snapping was snazzy and very unexpected, but broken unfortunately
---
I'm at the surveillance system terminal is that the right one???
---
Haha, for sure. I've seen maybe 8 of the same AAE Handmade I have for sale (this one may have been found after more productive duping methods were patched?), and the TSE Gauss I was using before the nerf was 100% duped.
---
I'm pretty confident most of my 3* AA/SS melee weapons are legit (I collect them), as the majority are the only I've ever seen for sale with the specific modifiers.
---
I GOT IT GUYS, its all a test, like the vaults, maybe we just have to... sacrifice one of our own!
---
Cookies. Do you even internet, bro? 
---
Is it red?
---
Yeah 
---
Flat out doesn't work for me unless I'm on area. 
---
Troll
---
I found one in a boat house northish of Grafton. Dont know how often that place gets looted, so I dont know how rare it is.
---
The note thing is a great idea in theory, but could easily be abused by griefers.  One expression of that idea might be a mailbox object/system so that we could leave messages or items for people at their base, since anything you left for that player would vanish if he logged out before finding it.
---
Not to mention I just lost 7 mutations trying to fix adrenal. My best weapon was only doing 65 damage and I'm a level 130
---
I got a max level TSE minigun with faster movement while aiming first time in the Whitespring grind. There's no rhyme or reason. I was fresh level 50. Please don't think I'm trolling. I'm just pointing out that there's no real indicator for drop possibilities. 
---
These conversations need attention, but honestly, I don't think anybody will do anything about it. I don't want to be a downer. I just wanted to point out that this post is like 10% of the conversation in this sub. 
---
It wont, because it will show the lack on resources for servers...
---
I say the no-way to see ping or amount of servers avalaible (for hoping, instead random jumps) are premeditary and not by mistake
---
Yeah my TSE guass is probably your guass’s brother. I have a ton of explosive weapons and I’m almost positive they are all duped along with all of my armor. I was sweating bullets when they shut down the servers to purge the dupes 😂
---
Got a heavy combat right arm that’s vanguard? 
---
I prefer about 5 shots before a re-load. I run Speed Demon mutation so my re-loads are quicker. Lately since my 1 shot kills disappeared with the nerfing of TSE I've also been using a suppressed combat rifle. Does 80 dmg but I can get multiple shots (read 3-4) before an enemy responds plus I often get 2.15 dmg multiplier for sneak attacks.
---
Have you completed the actual "I am become death" quest?
---
Not sure I've looked at adrenaline and bloodied mess perks. Will have to do so.
---
Keep an eye out for wanted players, that's how I got Good Grief.
---
Honestly Berserker is the most useless effect in the game unless you are running a stealth build. The damage drop off for even the slightest bit of DR is absurd.
---
I would feel the same way. Damn dude.
---
That would be nice, I wish it were so, because it means people who don't continuously grind the game or dupe items will then have items that can actually compete with the nerfed weapons, buffed enemy world that Bethesda is creating to combat the dupers but royally screw casual players. But considering how grindy they've made other things in the game (Mr fuzzy tokens, nerfed workshops, nerfed perks to reduce material costs), people playing the game more is better for them, so I don't think they'll create a system for people to quite easily get the items they want, just instead another motivation to grind.
---
I run a stealth sniper build and use a lever action.  I can one to two shot most enemies with vats head shots 
---
How the hell you y’all have so many caps. I have like 200
---
That’ll teach you to keep your mouth shut. Does it suck he is aloud to do that? Yes absolutely and I hate that he can do it. But Bethesda has allowed that since day one for some reason. You think crying about it to him is going to change his mind? You think crying about it on reddit is going to change something? Laughable. I kinda want to find your base and blow it to hell again after you rebuild just for whining like you are. 
---
Check out [falloutbuilds.com](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/perk-matrix/) perk card matrix. It really helped me to plan out my play. You can get cards that have your weapons breaking less, guns have a chance to repair themselves, armor can get repaired with getting hit etc. As others mentioned, the stash has been up'd to 800 with a higher limit possible in the future. It's hard to go from FO4 with basically an unlimited stash to next to nothing. When I first started playing I felt like I was playing an inventory management game haha.
---
Yes I am
---
Same.  If these camps annoy me, I jump servers.  What I do find is that if I stay up top at the entrance, most of the ghouls come up to me.  Least I can do is kill most of them so that the camp has very few to kill!
---
Yeah maybe there is a certain time I need to wait to get another one???
---
It sucks, but you're likely bang on with that.
---
Well what was the point of making a subreddit where you can’t post!?
---
1. I agree
---
2. Your budget will increase with your level so at some point you'll have the budget you want. 
---
3. I agree
---
4. The more players in the event the higher the SBQ health is. I've heard its something like +35 hp per player. I agree that something needs to be done about the AI behavior but it's legit end-game. You need at least 6-8 high levels with very specific builds/gear to even stand a chance. 
---
5. At this point i feel like most of us are just bored with vanilla 76. One can only run a nuked whitesprings only so many times but the DLC is on its way, we just have to be patient. 
---
I. I'd like to see some sort of display cases so we can actually place items from our inventory. Armor dummies would be sweet too. 
---
II. An ability to break down or sell ammo. 
---
III. An official player hub (pvp-free) somewhere on the map that allows players to "rent" vendor stalls to help centralize the vendor community.
---
Yeah, I mean obviously if testing was being done at all on this game before release, that should've easily been picked up on.
---
I hear ya man! I didn’t take you the wrong way. I just needed to vent! Haha
---
If he bought the game he's entitled to his comment about why he's staying away from the game. If he didn't buy the game he's still entitled to discuss why he's staying away from the game. He gave his two cents in a public forums for discussion, don't be an elitist dick
---
I used to Love ffxi because of linkshells, chat etc. This game would be 10x better if there was something similar. 
---
Me too, but I've ran out of things to do. I want to play it but whenever I start it up I just get so bored and don't know what to do..
---
New glitch. Try it
---
How many luck points do you have?
---
I have 12 (+ a few extra with food). I get some decent drops now and again, with high levels and high repair levels, the best legendary mods are still hard to come by though.
---
I have carnivore and I can eat all of the packages food items 
---
That's not normal in my experience, explosives are less than 1% chance.
---
I have noticed a few times I get a streak of loot that's above-average,  and I wonder if people have figured out how to hack the server drop algorithms...
---
You'd think this one is an easy fix, but a lot of the easy fixes seem to be getting ignored so \*shrug\* 
---
Plans only, there's a train car East of Watoga that has the plans sometimes along with the Marine plans.  I've actually gotten them as drops off of Grafton Monsters as well.
---
I'm also grinding for the neon signs and letter set plan.  Why so expensive???
---
11. I don’t think that has anything to do with what kinda prefixes you get though.
---
Well I've only been on f76, for around 4 weeks I'm level 51 and I basically just collect everything going, even if I have to walk past max weight. I dont do the trading. Just sell everything crap, and walk! 
---
You can find cargo bots occasionally flying around in the ash heap and savage divide, just look around for vertibots and a cargo bot will usually be nearby.
---
Except people aren't. I've got 300+ hours in this game and I've seen it numerous times. Just because it doesn't happen to you or him doesn't mean it doesn't exist or isn't exaggerated.
---
Mysterious Mothman perk for faction members
---
Wait no my lever action has 50% ignore and 25% fire rate
---
Try relogging and see if that works
---
I know, I feel the pain. I guess we'll see
---
Bloodied mess extra 15% damage to all weapons &amp; adrenaline builds up extra percentage per kill(time limited)
---
Wot, I sold like 147 1-3 star legendaries that I got from a glitch and only got like 500 caps
---
[removed]
---
+karma   ;)
---
Please tell me about the game breaking bugs in Fallout 1 and 2. Heck, even Tactics.
---
Kids these days.
---
Have you been to SBQ fights? How many?
---
Just a combination of 9 Slugger, 3 Incisor, 3 Solar Powered, Adrenal Reaction, Gun Fu, Adrenaline, Nerd Rage and some other stuff. And over repairing with weapon artisan. I also have 15 luck and full crit perks there so the damage spikes massively in VATS. You don't even need a bloodied weapon to be utterly busted as a melee in this game. All Rise will carry you to end game and beyond no problem and It's free
---
I had boosting with one player in mind :)  Never Go it Alone! (Join 20 teams), Field Medic (Revive 20 Fallen Players) and Good Grief! (Kill 20 Players) can all be boosted with one friend.
---
I'm sure an attitude will get a hit fix out sooner. 
---
Shits and giggles. 
---
Already tried that didn't work I'll try again tomorrow to get another one but Cheer's for your help 
---
What your saying makes a lot of sense, though I guess if we were to have persistent PvE worlds in fo76, I doubt we'd have the issue of overcrowding due to the technical issues having more players on a server would cause. 
---
As far as PvP, yeah, I definitely can see having top dogs on every server that ruin the fun for everyone.
---
If I were to guess why they didn't go for persistent servers to start with, I would think it to be because if they did allow too many players, then the exact issues you mentioned would crop up, and if they allowed too little or kept a maximum number of "active" players it would result in not being able to play with friends
---
I guess the question does come down to how simple it will be to host private servers, and how much control moderators on a server can exert. I remember way back when I played Minecraft there were a fair few successful servers that revolved around PvE because of the level of control available to admins, and I think this could work in 76
---
+karma    ;)
---
I don’t think so
---
Yeah just like the Bobby Pins. this stuff should be top priority.
---
Or you can have that type of response.  Cheers brah! 
---
Try to funnel them. A good spot might be  in  the doorway right at the base of the  collapsed roof ramp.  If you're more daring, you  could also open and close the  elevators to pick them off.
---
If all  else  fails, find a bunch of grenades, preferably plasma. Just stock up, and  throw  them as needed.  The buildings around Top of the World have lots of raider corpses that usually contain 1-2 grenades regularly.
---
If you're on PC I can get you through it if you haven't completed it.
---
That really sucks. I'd fill out a support ticket and hopefully they fix it for you. Thank you for the heads up. 
---
*Sounds like* **communist propaganda** *but* ****ok****
---
That's what I thought, but someone was trying to convince me otherwise.
---
Is it possible to get them from forbidden knowledge? 
---
I dont know, just been selling everything possible,  they have perks that increase selling prices. Some and its easier to farm high-end weapons if you get a higher friend to pickup his loot and give it to you
---
All the hate is overstated.  I understand how hardcore gamers could get bent out of shape.  It’s been really buggy and frustrating at times (very different game than previous Fallouts) but it’s still fun and they keep fixing stuff.  Been playing solo for a couple months - lvl 50.  Once you learn to work around the quirks it’s a great game.
---
It’s what I assumed, but how the process was achieved?????
---
I’m still cap farming so chems are worth more to sell ya feel
---
I've done 200+ turn ins and I've never seen it personally if it is in the drop pool.
---
too many actually. My whole character is built for SBQ. Unyielding sentinel with deathclaw gauntlet that does 2.5k per swing
---
GTA was doing it for a time too.
---
Is an Enclave commander above an Enclave general?
---
If you're going for a non PA build you're going to love the DR on BOS modded CA though.  It's all totally worth it.
---
I don’t know. They should have been 1,000-2,000, like the white springs plans 
---
It's a legendary heavy sledge I found a heavy searing sharp rocket mod for it's pretty sweet... reflects 50 percent damage back when blocking I think it's great
---
You can download Imgur. Post a picture and copy and paste the link to show it. It takes time but that's really the only way you can
---
Oh nice, thanks 
---
Sounds fantastic! I love helping out lower levels.... even if they don’t trust me. 
---
I get it. You are squishy.... getting squished sucks! (Been there, done that)
---
There is a windmill by grafton that you can build on. It is an unmarked location, northwest of the town, on a hill, and is pretty cool.
---
I'm always encumbered, which makes getting to all vendor factions difficult at best.  The game often feels like there's a low-grade anger towards the players.
---
The drop rate on the Watoga trains is not good. I farmed it for several days at 3-4 hours per day. Before I gave up. Never saw anything but underarmor and marine gear.
---
Secretly I am using it as a front to sell quilts and furniture
---
Hmmmm
---
So. You want easy gameplay? Nothing challenging, just one shot. Doesn't seem fun if the enemies are weak.
---
Had three gulpers in a nuke zone that we where flora farming in . it was a 3 star legendary and 2 crowned and the 3 star would not die !! we ended up dying 3 times each!! I’m a level 133!!  nothing kills me anymore unless I’m overwhelmed!!  I punch deathclaws for fun and melee scorchbeasts with a baton for  gods sake !!!a gulper!!! The other two died in 2 huts from my AA Grognaks . So we fight and fight for about 16 minute of nonsensical bullet sponginess , run out 3k worth of ammo and get dick for loot nothing but gulper innards and garbage WTF!!! 
---
I haven't tried the elevator but I've tried funneling and aiming for the thrusters which I have to say retrospectively is ridiculous bc they just block it with their leg(arm?) when they aim at you 
---
Idk what your talking about, after 16 characters it stops the name and shows the stars no matter what for me 
---
If this is the 900 hours since the game released dude, then I'm guessing he has a TON of free time now.
---
I visit all vendors in roughly 30 minutes haha
---
It's a bit misleading. 3*  legendaries have a chance of giving you a 3* item, but not guaranteed
---
I once walked all the way through the shopping precinct before I was bounced back to the entrance.
---
I thought the whole point of the mission is that the robots won't harm you anymore... well fuck that then...
---
Ay, i’m ready!
---
Can you accidentally cure serum mutations if you forget to have starched genes equipped?
---
How many mutations are you able to have at once?
---
I need to go to bed now, so I'll get back to you tomorrow, I'd love to get some! 😀
---
Maybe I was just lucky, I found several sets of plans so far.  Chest legs and arms.  
---
Lol yes I speak with a lightning sword tongue
---
Is there any good reward other than the initiate paint and the shielded under armor plans?
---
Only if you use rad away or have sun kissed n you can have as many as you want n lmk 
---
Okiedoke that's right out too bc they cover their thruster when they aim at you...
---
PS4 players are chill and usually don't have problems with the game so you should usually have a smooth ride. Welcome to the wasteland

It's the same neon letters from Fallout 4 and they were wonky half the time in that game too.

Speedwheel has med-x, diluted radaway, purified water and various foodstuffs (bonus for scorbeast steaks), and an explosive lmg for when I’m running events/nukezones with other people so I don’t paste everything before the can tag it.  
---
At 20% health with adrenaline, nerd rage and emergency protocols proccing I have insane damage resistance and my Gatling gun does about 550 dmg per shot, the 50 cal sits a 390, at 10% health it’s 775 on the Gatling and 500 for the 50 cal. Stabilized makes for awesome accuracy and spread, and one gun army will stagger the assasins/sentinel players and it’s just a few shots after that. I know that it sounds scary running around at that low of health but I rarely die anymore (the occasional rad death in a nukezone if I’m being careless becuase I run 80% radiation capped health to begin with).  
---
This build is optimized for solo sessions and requires very little maintenance, I have other intelligence tree perks to maximize weapon and PA durability, ammo production (big guns is hungy) and super duper.  
---
If you’re on xbox I have the scorchbeast fight I referencing on my feed and I’ll put up a clubhouse one the next time I’m in whitespring after the bomb drops. If you have any other questions I’m happy to answer.
---
I’ve only seen the initiate paint once and never the shielded plans, and since I don’t wear t-60 at all the plan is just stashed on a mule.
---
Eh I'm taking psycho idk what you guys are saying 
---
Wow, that picture came out really well. 
---
Negative :(
---
bro, their number could easily be the total for that character, sure what you had on you was slightly less but factor in how many of each before you even found that bag.  as for you not actually duping, you grabbed stuff that clearly was duped, that's on you.
---
The smashers code!
---
I've got the paint twice and the shielded once so far., wasn't sure if there was any reason to keep doing turn ins. 
---
Me too, thanks.
---
I've seriously server hopped for probably 20+ hours and never saw a single combat armor plan. Lots of Marine wetsuits.
---
No I just don't need to be at the point where I'm getting my ads kicked and wasting all the supplies it's taken frivolous tedious hours to collect for nothing over and over. There's a difference between a challenge and a totally imbalanced game
---
I launched one about 3am. Dont know if that counts  
---
I seriously thought that character was a guy in drag till I zoomed in, but I'm still not 100 percent convinced.
---
There's a scorchbeast here too ugh but at least if fucks with the robots on the roof
---
I just see it as not as many people as he thinks got explosives and if he just got the achievement for the queen kill he probably didnt do very much damage to the queen, I've gotten crap drops from not doing enough damage to her. 
---
The glass cavern is always flooded from entrence to exit with ultracite 
---
Yea, i hope that you guys are aware that its not just this one. This is a huge issue for me. There are too many challenges that are broken.
---
I struggle to understand the decryption but I am curious to see what this code is, was running my first silo over and hour ago and went to put the code in and said it was wrong. Checked the time and it was 12.04, gutted I was so close.
---
They wont, but you can hurt them
---
Try one or two missile turrets instead of all the machine-gun turrets. The missile turrets always work for me... The machine-gun turrets not so much.

---
I’m getting the feeling I may have popped you.  Lvl 40?
---
I’ll probably be on in about 30 mins or so. Let me know if you do in fact have a spare set and if you plan to be online.  Thanks.
---
Ok ill try
---
Hmm... I actually haven’t found that, thanks, it gives me something to look for.
---
You can only have one at a time, medx and psycho overwrite, whichever you hit last is active.
---
They reset like an hour ago
---
I'm level 39 now and still not found the stimpak plans. Saving up my blood packs though!
---
They wont, theyve said they cant/wont
---
Follow the brotherhood quest it should point you in the way. 
---
Wrong
---
They need to add a few options: Mark to sell, Mark to keep, Mark to scrap. This way things marked as the first two wouldn’t get scrapped. That would or could include loose and bulk junk. If you did the third, then even bulk or whatever weapons and apparel could get broken down. 
---
They reset
---
I have several, if you’re on xbox I’ll be happy to sell you one for cheap.  
---
The best thing about Bloodied weapons is that you can get scary damage even with just one star items and adrenal reaction.
---
My mouse won't show up on the main screen menu
---
Yep that's what happens. Afterwards they are 99.9% passive towards you. There might be a occasional rebel out there that decides you need a dose of laser fire. You'll probably end up killing robots to get to trade with Phoenix more often than not.
---
I can still eat it as a Herbivore, so probably not. 
---
How about we call it “This is my Rifle.....” in reference to FMJ (I think that’s the movie)
---
I thought this whole time it was on kill,  haha. Maybe the low proc was why. Anyways, a decent shotgun is my dream weapon. I have like 6k shotgun shells saved up because they never drop for me, even crapy ones. I'll definitely give that perk consideration when i get a shotty.
---
It happens in the whitespring lobby no matter how long after loading you step in
---
Go kill people at Workshops for good grief. It’s super easy if you get the drop on em, and it’s decent caps if you hit people level 100 plus. 
---
If I pick up black powder weapons and they are level 15 I leave them at the overseer's camp or hunt down a lower level player to gift them to. Some armour, meds, ammo etc. It's a tough wasteland and when you just start out it's tough to find good gear for when you get cornered.
---
They reset 1 hour and 26 min ago bud. Those are old codes.
---
69420
---
Thank you fellow comrade!
---
I think I remember reading that that perk works per trigger pull, not per shot. Try feathering the trigger on and off so the gun stays spun up, might work better that way.
---
I'm happy when I find someone doing this.  I save mini-nukes for the occasion.
---
There’s no crying crying in baseball!!!! 
---
Exactly, I'm reading through OPs comments, he is not a smart individual, says he's too lazy to cheat, then goes on to explain that what he did was intentionally cheating but he shouldn't be punished, calls Betheada stupid, plays the victim, this guy is a piece of work. 
---
If you got scaly skin, twisted muscles, healing factor, grounded I'll take those plans 
---
Likely wont be solved until Wednesday with the first letters show up on the board. Unless someone cheats into the dev room and grabs the codes from there.
---
No idea... Maybe we'll find out later in the year :)
---
Yes I do, i may join you on in this boat as serum recipes are alot 
---
Thank you. 
---
Is this a joke?
---
Well that just hurts.  I hope you enjoy your lucre.
---
Likely wont be solved until Wednesday when the first letters show up on the board. Unless someone cheats into the dev room and grabs the codes from there.
---
Yes! Its very annoying. ;)
---
How often do you block?
---
I’ve spent 200+ hours on my melee character and I think I’ve blocked once. 
---
Lucky... a (max level) bloodied explosive LA is my current dream gun! I actually got a really similar situation when I was leveling up, a 3star TS vats accuracy vats gain rate level 35 LA, it was my main squeeze for a long time. After the TS nerf I switched to a simple AA Lever because the VATS accuracy issues with TS were really annoying.
---
To be fair most of the diseases aren’t deadly. Rad Worms, Snot Ear, etc. They need actual affects for diseases though, so like when you get worms you get hungry faster or if you get Snot Ear you lose hearing in one ear and lose your balance or something 
---
sorry those ones have been sold
---
Me either, funny how that works. 
---
You could do it too if you just dropped some junk
---
I don’t think it’s consisted meat OR veggie, I think it’s considered it’s own “canned food” category
---
Like scorched beast hid armor
---
Right, as first I thought I was going to feel bad. But reading through the whole thing, I was like 🤦‍♀️. 
---
I think that's how I got here, too! 
---
You know how to cap farm right? Mothman Omelettes/Golf Outfits/Flux, chems are just small potatoes :) Good for rounding out vendor’s cap limit though  
---
Mistress dress :)
---
it says no solutions found.
---
They do land at munitions factory, just out past the helipad, but yes I still agree, the chance for a prime plan is good enough to fight them
---
I can’t find your hand imprints on your moms face
---
This is great, thank you.
---
Hell the caps from super mutants is better the the SB loot. 
---
Ah yea... well unfortunately there is no physical version of the game in existence outside of consoles. Even the collectors edition was a cardboard disc code. Bethesda.net is the only place you can buy it
---
gamestop has the pc version for $40 if you are willing to get it from them
---
Yeah, I know.  Honestly, it's a huge pain in the ass having to keep track everything.  It pisses me off to no end that our stash is so stupidly small.  Just house the player's stashes on a separate server.  If it takes a minute to open, I'm cool with that.
---
Unique, if you click on the challenge it shows you which you have taken in the past and which ones you still need 
---
Yeah, sure
---
I'm getting pretty good at timing it... At least with a two handed weapon a lot of the time if you strike and immediately block you'll stop the counterattack and often knock back an enemy
---
Hehehe
---
It always was strange that the commendation system existed solely for that one mission. This is a great fucking idea.
---
Cross faded? you mean candy flipping. 
---
Nicceeeee..was that a drop or did u get it from the market subs?
---
Im so sorry 
---
I wish I could put away enough stuff that I wouldn't need calibrated shocks on my PA. It took me awhile to downgrade that much though from my excavator with Cali shocks 
---
The bridge PA is in a locked locked room on the underside of the bridge.  There's a PA station and tinker bench in there too along with a chest and some junk loot.  To get in the room, there's a key in a duffel bag in the roller coaster car at Camden.  On the same bridge, there's also a key in a lunchbox but that opens the opposite room on the other end of the bridge.  In there there's a terminal and emails talking about how the builder was going to meet some people to sell it. Related but not necessary.
---
At the junkyard, the PA is in a locked (lvl3) trailer rig next to a shack down by the junk and lumber resources.  There's a couple dead raiders and an electric chair inside.  Sometimes there is no PA that spawns in there even if the door was locked.
---
Both of those locations have been consistently lvl 15 for me.
---
I was surprised the other day when I loaded up inside  Blackwater Mine for the uranium event.
---
Oh im not op im just saying this has come up before and that was beths response
---
Oh I know where the armor spawns, it's just never been there when I've gone. 
---
yeah i think the only way to actually spawn inside is thru an event..i really really really wish we could fast travel to the inside of whitepsring resport..it takes to long to go inside and then leave the place
---
Starred legendaries heal at half health, if it just says legendary it doesn’t  
---
 I'm also running Adrenal Reaction and Adrenaline perk. So I'm always at around 20% health. 
---
I'm missing over 1000 Atoms from Challenges that aren't tracking properly. It's 2019, and a AAA company can't even program a simple counter? WTF?
---
I usually do bulk sales,  straight jackets, so I outfits n chems easy enough for non filthy casual
---
Wait, uh, what?  That video is insane.  You did that after this latest patch?
---
Take pharma farma perk to loot more from containers, get chemist to double yields of diluted stimpaks, super duper to top it off and you'll have 700 diluted stimpaks in no time 
---
Well I figured Bethesda fucked up when they're flop of a game came out! I still love them but they should've let zenimax develop fo76 as they'd have built it right, Bethesda make amazing single player games never should've tried doing an online game so there's too many issues and bugs allowing this, but if you're banned for this then I should reinstall the game and post pictures of my inventory, I never duped anything but used multiple unlimited carry glitches to amass tens of thousands of resources and a few hundred weapons and varied armours in the first two weeks of the games launch.
---
Even used an exploit to level cap my second account so I could avoid the annoying grind!
---
Anyway forget this game friend grab there next single player game as you won't get banned even if you do dupe xD
---
Yeah, I get that the devs want balance in the game -- but it's not balanced, it never has been.  If you create a toon fit for combat, then you have around 6 pounds free in your inventory.
---
If you make a toon that has adequate carrying capacity, then you might as well name it "Deadmeat" in honour of the combat ineffectiveness.
---
Everybody knows this. You have apparently not played the game long enough to experience any of the enemy health bugs. Stop. 
---
Same here, clicked on it to see what Betheada did now ( I'm a Bethesda fan since early 2000s and I play FO76 with my wife so I don't purposely look for dirt on them)  ready to believe they did something incredibly stupid just to see OP is a cheater and whining about being caught cheating. 
---
While this is 100% correct story wise, it made me think why do vendors have mods for PA that was never in production or use.
---
bah!  beat me to it.  yeah....that.  i am ALWAYS selling of diluted stims.
---
Yeah, I had a minute left for that event and it froze up on me, on Xbox and havent gone back yet.  Someone recommend hiding in the elevator and letting the scorchbeast take care of them and then just killing the ones that try and come inside the elevator.
---
I kept having that problem, and the enemies would either destroy my turrets or the turrets would ignore them. It was really annoying, especially when I spawned at the bottom of a cliff and had to climb up. It sucks when you try to build something nice and it keeps getting eaten.
---
That’s mixing molly and acid. Cross faded is generally just two or more substances taken at the same time. Candy flipping is a type of cross faded 
---
Idk man this game can be pretty unpleasant and at the same time theres such a vast number of titles I can enjoy without starting to scream at them
---
If you invest in herbivore or carnivore you can use food to heal much better than stims
---
And if you have healing factor mutation you dont need much healing
---
But having the abive you main problem is having too much stimpacks like 500+
---
I thought death claw did more damage than fist?
---
Plink plink plink plink plink plink plink plink plink
---
If you are on PC and it is lvl 50 ill take it off your hands. PM me 
---
I wish that would happen to me. I agree it's inconsistent, but does Bethesda intend for it to be inconsistent or is it just on their list of things to fix. Also, I thought the SBQ was the only one that was consistently dropping 3\*s (not that I fought her THat many times), has she always been inconsistent too?
---
i watched this guide : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sALXl70gAqQ&amp;t=618s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sALXl70gAqQ&amp;t=618s)
---
but i still need the word on the wall in the enclave command room
---
I agree! I bet they will! Some of the stills you see have a “hopper” that can’t be activated...yet!
---
I just hope we get to start crafting quantum-ultracite ammo if we get to craft Nuka colas also!
---
they seem to ALWAYS go for my crops.  it is like there is nothing else for them to do.  :-(
---
Considering how easy it is to become a general in FO universe, I suspect so.
---
"Is your armor made of scorchbeast bones?  By the gods, what I would do for a set of that!"
---
Ideally, yes, they should fix it. Until such time, I just work with it. To make sure I have the right weapons, I just always make sure to reset my weapons after a loading screen or power armor (though I don't really use that much at this point). And if I change weapons, I always do the two again. Otherwise it seems to put whatever or nothing if I don't specify. I agree it's a pain, but now I just have the automatic routine.
---
Very cool
---
Similar thing happened to me. Was using someone's base until I was attacked by a grafton monster. Started shooting it and accidentally clipped the users base and got a wanted level. Just chilled and let someone kill me lol that was my first death in the game on day 4 or 5 
---
My ideal stash size would allow for... 7 power armor chassis, 4-5 guns, 100-200 of every junk item, a few hundred aid items about 100 radaway 200 diluted stimpaks and however many medx and psychobuff I run into , and all of the ammunition I scavenge but am not taking with me. But that makes me a hoarder I guess 
---
300% better trash is still trash.
---
Not trying to shit on your idea OP, but am I the only one that feels like power armor is way too common already?
---
gg no text wrap
---
Ya worth a shot. 
---
Another good one is to catch people mid event and see if you can slap damage the mats out of them before they make it to a stash. Don't want to server hop mid daily lol
---
Yeah Bethesda forgot that multiplayer means they have to find clever ways to punish toxic behavior from toxic ppl things like this just make the game less enjoyable I have a much better time just aimlessly exploring avoiding others then any experience near others so far 
---
Put a recurring event there, why not
---
I have 786 diluted stims on hand ATM, along with 600 diluted radaway and 2-300 diluted radx. Working on offloading these lol
---
That is an old mechanic that existed before FO4 overhauled crafting and the concept of junk, with workbenches placed everywhere.  You can do a lot more, in the field, with a handful of components that weigh practically nothing.
---
In NV you couldn’t break down a weapon into components.  You can now.  We can do better than reviving crappy legacy systems instead of taking advantage of new systems.  Get creative!
---
Oh lol.
---
Good point.
---
Death claw is a fist
---
need todays code for this week? anybody could help me for Saint Alpha Silo
---
Is this a copypasta
---
I need the key word for alpha myself. Then i can nuka crypt it.
---
The lockpicking crate thing is what got me too.  I lockpicked something I thought was part of the world and not part of someone's area.  It wasn't red, it didn't say it was stealing, nothing. I didn't think anything of it until BOOM I was wanted for 10 caps and it was so frustrating. The bounty would not go away either even after hours of playing.  Eventually some people came over and killed me for the bounty.... I think they tried staying near me for a while bc they thought I wanted to do pvp or that I was a problem player or something. But I just wanted to praise them and thank them for removing my bounty. :P 
---
Winners win.
---
Games broken anyway, cut your losses and move on to the next chapter in your life. 
---
True, true. Mothman Omelettes aren’t overly sweaty, you just go to Point Pleasant and collect the eggs around the statue and ritual site. Enemies are capped at 5 and you can get 252 caps per run (the omelettes sell for 9 each with Hard Bargain 3 and I think you get 28 per run, not sure though)
---
Didn't the previous games teach us to do that?  And suddenly they want us to play inventory manager.  Grr.  Grrrr.  Grrrrrrrrr.
---
^ def the sound of anything over max level x20
---
Show me what you entered? When no letters of the keyword are known just put a single question mark.
---
Oh ok. I havent played since November. I'm glad they're finally getting everything together. It looks like 2019 will be a better year for fallout
---
Same here confused AF
---
I know your pain. I have the same issue, but in addition they spawn in the center of my home and destroy my generator before I can even get to them. Which in turn locks me out from the home because my Keypad door has no power. 
---
I think they can work on making enemies spawn outside of the CAMP boundaries and the frequency of the attack’s. It would probably help a lot if they didn’t also have invisible stairs attached to every foundation. Because of the invisible stairs even radrats can walk up to your wall and shred it in mere moments. 
---
Ok 1 the game is super fun if you have friends or anyone from the community 2 take it slow go do some events or farm some stuff dont rush the story like i did or you wont have such a good time after the story ends 3 try to meet and be friendly with people
---
Im from Florida, cross faded always meant weed and booze lol. 
---
 "Heres hoping this makes the list of Official Bugs that should be fixed."
---
I reported a handful of Social bugs I was experiencing the first week of launch. I also complained on their support forum, and over the course of months multiple times on this sub. To date, not a single fucking one of them has been added to their bullshit list of known issues. And no, they didn't fucking fix them either. The worthless Community Manager is even aware they are ignoring them. But since they are worthless at their own job, nothing has changed. The bugs were so bad they made this multiplayer game literally unplayable with friends. Not figuratively, literally. Which is why I haven't played since Patch 5 broke even more basic functions.
---
That’s pretty freakin dope!!! Great work!! 😁
---
This is the kind of person Bethesda is encouraging, everyone. No, not everyone is like this, but the fact that people like you are out there is saddening. 
---
Thank you
---
Its always been solved by monday before... this is sooo frustrating
---
That’s usually what it is haha, I was gonna say that but didn’t for whatever reason. I’m in Virginia 
---
Ummm fo3 taught me to have a locker with 500 of each gun, 500 of each armor, and pick up everything. Including the coffee cup on your table. I'll sell it back to you for 2 caps.
---
NV taught me the same things as fo3
---
Fo4 taught me to keep literally everything except purified water. Purified water is sold to vendors. Until I can put down a pick me up station. Then I sell copious amounts of drugs and hoard the purified water too.
---
Fo1 and fo2... Actually taught me to keep a nice stash in the trunk of my car.
---
I am what’s your gt?
---
Sorry man, everyone that helped me solve them got suspended/banned.
---
 Takes roughly 500-1k keycards a week, depending on luck. So without the extra people and the mass keycards its impossible to do without the letters to narrow it down.
---
Collected last night,loged in 12 hours later still there.unspoiled. just put on good with salt rank 2 and am now server hopping looking for more!
---
Would you say that the idea is worth your commendation? Do you commend him on this brilliance?
---
I HOPE someone from Bethesda sees this video! His ideas are great. I want to play HIS version of 76. 
---
Funnily though the Assaultron head is actually REALLY heavily armored.
---
My sibling.
---
I'm built like a well outfitted bloodied melee. But lately I primarily use only a bloodied/Attack Speed/blocking Bowie knife and a bloodied prime crossbow. Also I wear all unyielding shrouded wooden armor.
---
Can clear westtek/ws with just a Bowie knife and not a single shot fired. Can shank the crap outta SBQ too. 
---
I thought the insta-healing was part of them being legendary. Wasn't that part of F4? I noticed I had to give them a few seconds for their legendary loot to drop. Still only 3 star legendary no 4 or 5s.
---
Whatcha talking about no one goes back there? I go there all the time to farm ticks for their blood to craft stimpaks! 😂 but I agree it would be really cool for them to tie that into the new DLC. 
---
Unfortunately, this armor no longer fits the Fortnite Fallout aesthetic. We only have silly whacky armors now! Haha lobster man armor!
---
Honestly. I feel the same. That quote is literally my extremely passive aggressive way of saying that I know they will never acknowledge the multitudes of bugs I've been experiencing. Their lack of transparency and communication with their fan base irks me. The hiatus was because I felt they didn't give a shit about their players. The amount of times I lost my daily at Camden due to their servers crashing made me rage. And now instead of telling the players what they are fixing, they are trying to razzle dazzle us into getting hyped on the upcoming content instead of you know fixing their broken multiplayer game. A multiplayer game you can't even see your teammates in cause they randomly go invisible with no way to interact with them. 
---
No shit it is a great point. One we have been making since the beginning. But we won't see a fix until you figure out how to make a multiplayer game work on a single player engine. The evidence so far shows that you in fact, can not.
---
Yes! I’d love a lot of Fallout 3’s armor and clothing to come back, honestly. Some of the raider masks/helmets were too cool. 
---
What’s the best weapon to kill super mutants? I tried sledge but thbbbbbb and lasers just don’t cut it.
---
Is me finding completely empty first aid boxes everywhere just bad luck if people got to them first? I can’t even remember the last time I found one with anything in it. I do have the pharma perk on 
---
Ohhh fallout tactics taught me to make a gigantic loot pile on the mission exit grid, have one unit pick all of it up and hope I didn't encounter anything along the way back to base 
---
well at least in FO4 it would say "Enemy has mutated!"
---
where the fuck did that go? Can't blame people
---
I'm a big fan of the Bowie. I deal so much DAMAGE with that thing. Come to think of it, it's got me out of some pretty sticky situations. I guess Somebody Up There Likes Me ;) Haha
---
how much for excavator jet pack friend?
---
also would like talons mutation and speed demon :) would pay 200 caps each for mutation serums
---
You got a t51 torso with a jetpack already installed?
---
👍🏼👍🏼
---
Yeah I hear the SBQ drops are all over the place
---
[https://imgur.com/a/TJb5tNP](https://imgur.com/a/TJb5tNP)
---
What can I say, the people who play this game, particularly in that manner are pretty c*nty.
---
Thanks everyone for commenting. Yeah I definitely don't know about Google's algorithms 
---
Ok now I want this.
---
You're a scholar and a saint, sir or madam.
---
Ah, key letters are supposed to be the letters on the wall. When none are known just put a question mark instead.
---
Yes they would have sir. 
---
I turned off his turrets. He wasn't even there. He just left them on. Also, random people passing by will likely be unknowing of what is going on
---
Personally I use a Mr Handy's buzz blade but sneak crits to the head are always good. 
---
You're trying to loot the same containers too often. You'll need to branch out to looting a few more places before circling back to the first location. For example sometimes I'll go to Huntersville then west Tek then black water mine, swing by whitespring bunker for some technical data go to camp venture head back to camp stash junk and I can usually loot all containers again. Once you get going with pharma farma chemist and super duper you won't be going out of your way to find more aid containers 
---
Definitely less pathetic than trolling a gaming sub, lol.
---
Dropped my bloodied explosive gauss almost had a heart attack lol
---
Incentive to keep players from cluttering servers with unwanted lego loot. It’s free server stability!
---
Noope. 100odd. 
---
like, the guy was actually lower level than me, but I don't do the PVP side of this game, at all. So I legged it. 
---
Oddly enough, reading about the issues actually encourages me to play more. 
---
Damn. Did not know all the work that went into it this early. Guess wednesday I'll be plugging the pairs in.
---
I ate at subway once. 
---
i put in a question mark now and got a very big list of possible combinations
---
Hit up a few events, you always get stimpack rewards. And don't be afraid to die in this game, worst case you respawn and hunt down your dropped loot.
---
Just look up what his routes are and stand on one of those roads. My camp is right on one of them, and I’ve seen him three times within a week while I was crafting stuff. 
---
Grahm walks a set path it's posted on this sub somewhere I'll go find it 
---
The waist joint (the little grey/black tube they swivel on) on protectrons is where you'd going to be doing extra damage specifically. I thought for the longest time people meant torso as in their chest area
---
Global chat is super needed. Just like imagine being on a server and just saying "sbq in ten". Game changer.

I don't care about the "cost" making games accessable is a must.

AAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
What's a turret farm and why don't people like it?
---
I go there almost daily. Gotta get my ticket blood fix. 
---
I think it's great.  People pay $60 for worse games with less than 20 hours of playtime everyday.  I'm on 100 hours and can see finishing this in 150-200, but had a blast and got more than my money's worth.
---
Yup. When no key letters are known it checks 56 thousand possible words. Usually there is anywhere from 500-3000 possible solutions when no letters are known. Normally i have a group of people and we just test all the combinations, though everyone either got suspended/banned or quit playing. Just isnt feasible to try to solve them before Wednesday now.
---
I have my camp near Flatwoods and I do Fertile Soil. A lot. The event seems like it pops constantly so I can end up doing it like five times a day. It won't always give you Stimpacks for completing it, but sometimes you can get multiple Stimpacks at once.
---
Also, there are lots of chem boxes to search along the quest path (in front of the church, under the bridge, in those short silo-type things across the street from the research center...).
---
Turn your mike off when your kid is screaming. I don't want to be a party to your bad parenting.

Sharing is caring, so let everyone get a hit in that way we can all get XP.

Don't be a jerk and put your camp right in the middle of the action and leave it locked up.

These rules are more like guidelines than actual rules...

I don’t do PvP either, but I’ll help someone clear an accidental bounty.  I don’t want their stuff and I don’t find any enjoyment hunting folks down.  
---
I showed up to a neighbors camp who had a 10 cap and waved, talked to him for awhile, cleared his bounty and let him come by and use the resources at my camp for whatever he needed.  Good dude and glad I could help him.
---
That’s awesome 
---
I looted a serated one once which makes me think they are moddable but I've never got anything from scrapping.
---
I’m sorry but this game sucks ass. I haven’t played since december but this shit happened too often when I was playing. The PlayStation 4 version is complete shit and if your fighting more than 4 enemies good luck playing at 10 FPS. I fell for the biggest trap. Bought this shit for 120$ and barely got any extra content and now they’re selling the full ass game for less than 30$. I’m big shitty. 
---
TL/DR: fuck fallout 76
---
It is a random loot item. Not unique like in FO4.  I believe it can spawn with levels 40 and 50, but I could be wrong.
---
Hand embroidery? That's *really* impressive!
---
I have seen him in white spring 3 times.... doubt this is accurate.
---
This happen to me the other day and I stuck around and the sbq gave me loot three times. It wasn't the best but it was nice to get more crap then no crap. 
---
Same as name here.
---
don't forget you can make healing salves. There are about 30 blood leaf following the river from overseer's camp to flatwoods/vault tec agriculture, plenty of soot flowers everywhere around flatwoods and the last ingredient is boiled water.
---
I have seen him in white springs 3 times. Doubt this is accurate....
---

---
I can help you with that if you want.
---
Noted.  Do you feel special now?  
---
If you want someone to help let me know. Shot you a dm.
---
Codes arent solved for the week and probably wont be until Wednesday. 
---
Means no farming till then :(
---
Or maybe it can become instanced community loot? In the case of the extractors I mean. Say someone takes a workshop and sets up extractors and starts up the shop to produce items and w/e.... Have the product bins and extractors and stuff just be instanced loot per person and anyone can pick loot up out of anyones workshop without it infringing on someone else. 
---
Also maybe limit the amount of workshops a person can claim and build at to 1-3 only.
---
:(
---
Would only work if they require new characters that only work in the mode. Otherwise you could just log out and switch to adventure, fast travel, and then switch back. 
---
I'm sure there's a newer and much more accurate map.
---
Sure it is. But the claim is that I duped. Which I didn't 
---
I am starting to feel bad for the people working on this team. It is very clearly mismanaged. Stopped playing a bit ago at this point, its just too broken. I do think the people working on the team are trying the best but it's just a total mess. 
---
This game sucks.
---
Once I found this out about the lack of stacking, I am doing the exact same thing.  
---
I think it's my heritage, but I really enjoyed rolling slow and heavy with a massive load of loot and then dump it off at my base of operations and the relax with a long slumber with Curie.
---
Ok cool I'll try it out!!
---
Already addressed that. Read.
---
It was a drop from a Whitesprings nuke event which was very surprising considering all the useless armor stuff I've tossed or sold away.  As I collected it, I saw it was a Legendary Lever Action.  It was only after I exited the event that I saw the 2 stars and did the  Inspect where I saw the Explosive part (and then saw the Level 35 which was a downer)
---
Since a post from a while ago, I've always done the Inspect for a 2 or 3 star.
---
Nukacrypt will have em up before nights end. They don't use dev room....
---
I hope it is like graham and hard AF to find. I feel like ppl.want this game to be too easy

I took multiple trips for loot. Then I got the fast travel while over encumbered perk. Then I picked up every piece of junk from every workshop and stashed it all in one workshop. Boston airport. Because I have no reason to ever go back to it. Hah! Take that game crashing when I look in my workshop inventory and there's WAY too much junk!
---
Bump, anyone got a fix yet? Its funny to watch my level 21 deathclaw aggro everyone, but someones gonna blow my camp up soon out of annoyance
---
I’ve gotten ultracite mod plans and prime receiver plans from regular scorchebeasts 
---
Idk about Bethesda but I haven't heard of that.
---
Use food n drink instead to stock up
---
It's a buggy piece of shit that I warn everyone interested to stay away from. I know people will down vote me or say there are hardly any issues, but that is part of the problem. Person A sees almost no bugs and thinks person B is lying when they say they are plagued by them. Bethesda could not make a consistant experience from one player to another, so one person will have a great bug free experience while another person will be plagued with bugs to the point where they quit playing. I quit on the day patch 5 released and reverted a bunch of bugs because of a rookie programming mistake. Some sessions I spent more time in load screens than the actual game, because it's programmed so poorly it crashes all the time. To this day Bethesda has ignored my bug reports, as evidenced by the lack of fixes, as well as the complete absence of them listed in their official known issues thread. Bethesda used to make good games. They don't anymore.
---
But hey, if you enjoy a game full of bugs, by all means this game does a great job breaking
---
I appreciate the offer however i have been working on re-writing the site so that people can crowdsource the correct codes. Will be focusing my efforts on that for now.
---
The game was a hot mess when it was first released, but it has come a long way.  I feel that it is on it's way to being a really solid game.  Bethesda really stepped up and took responsibility for it.  You can find the game pretty cheap now, I say go for it!
---
Not surprised. They say I performed the duping glitch which I didn't . That's the point 
---
I hear you. I played every day the game was live since the Stress Test. I finally quit two hours into Patch 5, they broke so many more things I couldn't stand playing it anymore. I just check the sub every once in awhile to confirm my belief that Bethesda truly doesn't care about us. The same tone deaf responses by the employees. I just saw a ridiculous comment by the CM about a good suggestion just posted. One that has been posted countless times since Beta. I'd already made up my mind that the CM was a completely worthless position, but reading that comment today just sealed it for me. 
---
Probably. I have only seen him in 3 places.
---
3 X white springs 
---
2 X just south on the road from thunder mountain power plant
---
2 X in front of haven’s church (also in the mire)
---
I have too, but when a player kills their first random SB and gets a wing fragment and a piece of meat it's just so anticlimactic. Getting a 1* legendary off of a SB that's annoyingly difficult to kill makes much more sense than a legendary off of a bloated glowing one that took 1% as much effort 
---
Where? 
---
Where about is he body? I can’t seem to find his location. 
---
What platform r u on?
---
Not looking "for a reason to hate" looking for a reason to hole them accountable. Not willing to bend over and take it when I don't need to to. They're are dupers out there but I am not one of them
---
Theres just about 26 aid boxes from vault 76 to flatwoods. With pharma farma you can get a boat load. I wrote a walkthrough on my profile page of where almost all of them are. 
---
Well, the civil war was 1861-1865. The "wild west" period that is mostly associated with cowboys is 1860s to 1890s. So, they basically overlap.

I saw him walking in Savage divide along the road to the train station near top of the world. I remember this well because I was level 22 and he saved me from 5 level 50 gutsies

Same, a random Reddit post with 9 score and I use my data to load it just for this.

They take up sooooo much budget per letter. It's ridiculous. ☹️
---
I actually loved the game that's the misfortune. Not that it's all I had (900 hours guy) but I was genuinely into it. 
---
Walk thru of flatwoods to get 26+ aid kits. There are a few I missed when I wrote this.

I thought a recent(?) patch “fixed” the self-destruct mechanic? At least that’s what I read in another thread. 
---
It's someone who places a camp and wall of missile turrets behind whitespring golf course, basically the only good place to level up and get legendaries these days. People don't like them because these Farmers leave their base completely, the turrets kill all monsters passing by automatically, and other players have no chance to get any of them. Plus, it gives them an extremely unfair advantage. Any time ANYONE enters the area, all the ghouls respawn. 
---
Thus, you have almost infinite loot, experience, water, food, and even a chance to sabotage other players for your own personal benefit.

Found an instigating combat knife which does double damage to a target with full health. And I also have the stealth blade mod which increases damage done while in sneak. Needless to say with the appropriate perks this thing gets the job done.
---
I actually liked listening to that video. Ran across it earlier. No idea why I played it. I don't really like watching YouTube videos when I can read a post with all the information in 1/10th the time
---
PC on my way home, add / friend me, I'll donate crafting / construction materials.
---
That's a really good point - Events let you do this.  So, there's clearly no technical reason why they can't.
---
Myself, I'd like to fast travel into Whitesprings Bunker too, but I'd also like the option of respawning inside an interior when I get killed.  Having to wait for the entire exterior to load again, just so I can go back inside, is somehow more punishing than the death itself.
---
Sup y'all 
---
Here's another. We use our voice, and our intelligence, and relay to Bethesda that we hate this, because we really do. No one likes this crap. We inspire change for the better so everyone has a fair chance. Your strategy just encourages more people to do this. 
---
This message should be carried on to the rest of our community, your video was a little short, but it got the point clearly. I don't care about quality, you truly have me hope that this game can improve, and it is ! Thank you good soul, may the angels of Appalachia stay with you :) 
---
And the number of stars in their title is how many times they can Regen. If you hit them fast and hard enough you can get em down before that triggers.
---
Well shit. Now I want to try it :)
---
Its great if you prefer solo play, nothing can really ever see you and 90% of enemies are 1 shot. Not as much fun in groups though.
---
/wave 
---
I've never used a bed in all my hours of play. It could be nice to use if you have to step way to cook dinner or something and come back for an exp buff, but that's about it.
---
Just gotta say my teammate respawned and I turned invisable for him while my corpse stode in the elevator
---
True. There should be a repeating misc, quest like the “kill wendigo in a clown costume” one where you get a random reward. 
---
Maybe a repeating quest called “eradicate the scorchebeasts” 
---
Honestly tho that's a good plan, get a couple of friends and presto chango your a high level
---
Bwhahaha you had me going there. Good job
---
BUT I see why this is a problem
---
I will literally stand at the back door closing it over, and over and over and over...you get the idea.  Did this for about 40 minutes straight one night.  
---
&gt;Here's another. We use our voice, and our intelligence, and relay to Bethesda that we hate this, because we really do. 
---
Speak for yourself.  Its a multiplayer pvp game.
---
&gt;No one likes this crap
---
You cant speak for all players, so dont try.
---
&gt;We inspire change for the better so everyone has a fair chance. Your strategy just encourages more people to do this free of any penalty
---
There are in game mechanics to solve your problem.  IF you refuse to use them, that is on you.  PVP has a penalty.  You get wanted and get shot.
---
Stop acting like you cant shoot back.  git gud nub
---
Giving up on this dumb game was so liberating. I don't have to give a fuck about any of this. I'm working up to uninstalling it all together.
---
Do a full auto pipe gun lower weight and comparable dmg
---
I guess if the benefits outweigh the Addiction Penalty. Over encumbrance use to be the worst thing about being addicted to chems and such.  
---
You unlocked it on the Combat Armor Helmet.
---
You cannot unlock it on Arms, Legs, or Torso by scrapping, only by Plan.
---
You are wasting your materials on building heavy legs for scrapping. Save your materials and build and scrap light arms instead (cheapest part). You can unlock all scrappable mods from any piece. Once unlocked they can be applied to light, medium, or heavy pieces.
---
You might’ve got it for the combat helmet.
---
Honestly, there's no other way to put this: it's *stupid*.  You kill a 3\* Legendary and you find something Lv. 35, or without 3\* effects.
---
What is so difficult about reading the level of the players who killed the enemy and rewarding them with level-appropriate loot that has the appropriate number of effects?  I'm at a loss, Bethesda.  Similarly, I fail to understand why "Making the Scorchbeast Queen's loot table more 'legendary'" is something that takes you months to figure out.  I don't get it.  What in the world makes you think this is a valid reward?
---
It's a multiplayer online survival game - games in this category are typically unforgiving and let players do what they want. I played Rust for maybe 20 hours and it is 10x worse. This is decent and your camp is easier repaired then most games in this category as well.
---
That reminds me. I love a lot of the new enemies... But why... Why aren't any of them able to be 50+? I'd love to see a level 70 wendigo kicking ass in a nuke zone, not one random level 42 wendigo among 16 level 62 bloated glowing ones. Nuke black water mine for special level 60 mole miners. We just get boring scorched ghouls and super mutants -_- rant rant rant I'm sorry I am ranting so much hahaha

Are you searching and looting, don't forget to hit Y to search the box or your appropriate key as well as loot the container, two different things.

I think stealth group play is awesome. My toon has max stealth. I hide to the right or left of my boys and 3 shot everything with my AA AR. I rarely get noticed, and when I do I have a steady supply of plasma grenades to toss in. 11/10 stealth fun times
---
Already posted on both markets. Just covering all the bases but thanks for the suggestion homie.
---
Didn't say that ever but yes I would indeed need one for this much stuff. Made one like a week later after I went on vacation to transfer to. 
---
This is my method of farming stimpacks. 
---

---
I fought her for first time in months last night.  Shot almost 2,000 rounds from gatling gun before realizing it was futile and leaving.  There were 6 people fighting her, all over level 75.  It's stupid.
---
I'm not cool enough to understand if that's helpful or you're being a dick
---
not necessarily true, unlocked bos arms or legs from scrapping combat armor legs or arms but it happend early on. lots of patches/updates since then
---
Again I can provide the date info on my phone if you'd like. 
---
Also, to anyone who reads this, sorry for the crappy formatting, I’m a fellow mobile user and am not the greatest at posting with the right formatting, just thought this needed to be said..
---
The big one for my group is what we've termed the "night hag" bug. 
---
So buddy runs a female character because lady of mysteries(cause who wants to see balls dangle underneath your skirt). So what happens is they'll climb inside their power armor, which then promptly disappears. Leaving a naked female model stretched out of proportion. Long limbs and long fingers, very much resembling a night hag from elder scrolls "random number". 
---
They walk in an incredibly awkward manner and can do all emote actions. Combined with the "constantly falling" bug just makes it better, especially when you're not expecting it.
---
And you thought mothman was scary.
---
Then quit ?  
---
Not a fraction as powerful as it is in fo4
---
It's happened to me, theory being the UI pulls items from other tabs if you drop items too quickly. Those who were here for beta said it happened then also. Many have asked for the ability to lock/unlock items to prevent dropping, selling, scrapping or trading. AFAIK no answer from BGS yet.
---
I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/apgrv5/items_are_disappearing_from/) about this awhile back. The doubters were there, or those who blame the user - which is a luxury they can afford, til it happens to them : )
---
That’s what I’m wondering. Apparently, in FO4, you could see the negative elects of your various addictions in the pip boy. Now it seems to be much more difficult to compare the benefits versus downfalls, since the FO76 pip boy doesn’t list the downfalls. I was hoping there was an online resource that explicitly listed the negative effects of the addictions so I can gauge whether the perks of the junkie equipment are worth it.
---
Where did I claim to cheat? I picked up from a bag on the ground. Their claim is that I duped. Never did. Thanks for your comment
---
I usually don't meet players in my gameplay, but when I see a level 200 trying to kill a level 6 at vault 76... I destroy him with my 2 shot missile launcher (I am level 47) and help the guy out. But when I do get attacked, I usually server hop 2-3 times till there is q server without that many people, or many people with bounties (they usually are really aggressive). 
---
I found those in the hospital in Charleston I think...
---
Well I'm sorry you don't believe me. Thanks for taking the time anyway. 
---
I appreciate your offer, I'm on pc though. I have a pretty good set of mutations right now, thinking about reaching out for the adrenal reaction serum. 
---
Any of those out of bounds areas can be possible expansion sites eventually
---
You said you knew what was in the bag was duped items. How did you know that?  Did you place it there?  Did you know the duper?  You didn't say, but you did say that you knew it was cheating having those items, so yeah, you're a cheater and you got caught, stop crying on reddit. 
---
You’re absolutely right. It doesn’t show negative effects. I am also perplexed by and if negative effects will show in the future for Chems other than mutations.
---
Stupid question, but dont ghouls heal from radiation damage?
---
Would explain why I've gotten legendary loot off of supposedly non legendary enemies.
---
Yah it isn't just you. I killed a dozen deathclaws and a dozen Grafton monsters and behemoths and it never popped for me.
---
I always do this, probably only get accepted by one out of every five. But if you’re the one to accept me I’m sure as hell going to give you some heart emotes and a couple of stimpacks.
---
I just got mine today as well and in excited!! It keeps crashing to desktop right out of the vault but I'll figure out the problem soon I'm sure. 
---
Idk if they shoot thru those things. I put mine on a little table lifting it above stuff. Worked decent. When they decide to shoot stuff that is.
---
However, I think you should contact Bethesda support... They sure can't fix 100% of the problem, but they can fix a little. Oh that just reminded me, you also have an option to block the guy ... I dunno what it does but you can try that I guess ? Tell me more if it works :)
---
Stay safe outhere, Appalachia is home to many monsters unfortunately :/
---
depends on when u started looking for them. i havent seen them spawn in over a month. after an update they seem to have stopped appearing 
---
Hey, I actually found these very plans at the ATLAS facility today. Might try checking there?
---
Hahahah.  Nice.  Fast travel while encumbered is mandatory.  It's irksome as hell that they removed it from F76.
---
OP isn't smart, he's still trying to argue about it. 
---
Thanks for the technique :)
---
I may use that
---
nice video
---
The learn chance for the BoS Material Mod has always been None, in every ESM from BETA to patch 6. Not saying you are wrong (maybe you found a bug/exploit), but the ESM does not agree with your statement. I scrapped maybe a thousand pieces of each type of armor to learn every scrappable mod before I read any plans (just in case one did unlock by scrapping). Never once did I learn a learn chance None mod (one that has a corresponding plan) by scrapping.
---
I hope so, it’s frustrating for people who want to do a fine-tune build that requires careful attention to detail. I was considering trying to run with it and documenting my experience, but wanted to see if anyone had attempted something similar already that I could reference for the junkie build.
---
It would be handy to know when a limited time offer pops up, even something as simple as a mailing list would work, or like you said; roll it into an app. 
---
Workshop defense events work well (and gv e free fast travel spots)
---
Thanks for the support! We need more caring people out there.
---
Well hello there [Mr. Stabby](https://youtu.be/vYxaVMNc2Vc)
---
That’s a shame! Do you happen to have any online sources I can reference to see the experiences other people had with the build? I may still try to run it, just so I can document my experience for future players.
---
No problem. I have seen this question asked many times and I have answered in comments with a scaled down version of this post. Figured it was time to post an in depth guide. If you come across any good locations for materials or better methods let me know and I will edit the post. 
---
There is no high end content so you become the content, good news it's on the way with the road map. If you dont want to pvp I have some tips for you, turn on pacifist mode and your problems are over. Or change servers. It's a pvp game it's not really toxic that some one wants to pvp you while your in pvp mode. Best of luck.
---
It is a pleasure sir :) 
---
In fallout.. and elder scrolls games... We're taught to pick up and sell everything. Oooo a paper lantern... Can I pick it up? Yes! Selling that... A candle... Hmm can't activate that... Guess I can't loot it... Oooo! A spoon! Score! I can sell that!
---
I've only seen 3* Legendary enemies regenerate their health. I farmed Whitesprings all day today after dropping a nuke and that's what would happen. 
---
I spent almost 300 hours playing (I'm on sabbatical and have been all this month) and in that time I only ran into like 4-5 people that harrassed me like this. Did I just luck out? Why did this seem to happen more often to others? I'm genuinely wondering what I did that was different. 
---
Sure :)
---
Please don’t be discouraged there are still plenty of us who like dropping spare legendaries &amp; aid for our fellow vault dwellers.
---
Remove the indent at the beginning of your post. Those spaces make reddit markdown think you're writing a code block. 
---
I just hit 140 and still go there for ticks. Also that lumber mill just south of there.
---
The sites with codes have an archive of the previous codes. I'm curious if anyone has an archive of the letter/number pairs and the keyword from each week?
---
I’d always use chems in moderation now due to past Fallout titles. I think I got addicted to PsychoBuff and was even more over encumbered but in Fallout 4 I was more of a PsychoJet type. Take care bro good discussion. 
---
I've heard mixed things since the store patch. I figured I'd give it a shot. Maybe it was helmet. I'm nearly out of other possibilities. 
---
No worries!
---
What system? 
---
It’s assholes like this that forced my hand, I’ve created the Whitespring Turret Enforcement Agency, or TEA for short. Any camp I find on the golf course with turrets that are obviously intended for farming ghoul hordes, are getting a swift ass kicking from me until they take the turrets down or leave the server. 
---
I typically get attacked back and cussed out but it’s the right thing to do! 
---
Quiting is never the answer, stay determined, fight it... quiting is the equivalent of weakness. And we, fo76 players, are not weak are we?
---
PS4. Sorry. Should have mentioned that
---
I thought I was reading a terminal.
---
How do you know its built for SBQ?
---
Bravo P-4

People are giving out serums for free or selling at low price, check [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76bazaar/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76bazaar/)
---
are you on PC?
---
You will always hear mixed/conflicting things on the Internet, especially here on /r/fo76 because the game is so buggy and unintuitive. Unless lots of others show up to corroborate an account of something happening that the data in the ESM shows otherwise, the general consensus is: show us a video or it didn't happen.
---
but there is literally no way to prove that, that could be your bag that you dropped...
---
Out of curiosity where is your camp located? I had one in toxic valley. Stuff never grew there. Like ever. Finally moved and stuff grew.
---
That's so strange to me, I very rarely run into people causing problems. Shoot, I've only even ever entered into pvp once and that was over a workshop which, in my opinion, i open myself up to by using workshops as the "king of the hill" style mechanism they have is part of the game. Good luck out there. 
---
because as of right now there's no higher dps build.
---
Yup it took me two days
---
Just buy them from BOS Vendor or the Grafton Responder Vendor (Not the train station). Everything is there... 
---
I’m going to look you up for some serums but alas I work away from home and not back for four days. 
---
Thus the tag in your thread. 😏
---
I accidentally broke a bunch of stuff helping a guy defend his workshop the other day (ok, so maybe my super sledge is a little OP). I fixed everything using my own junk and let him kill me to get the caps, lol.
---
If you can't make the Combat Armor Helmet yet, find me on PC. I can make some so you can scrap and learn it, and also test to see if you learned the BoS material mod for the helmet. IGN: jchamlin. Otherwise you can find Combat Armor Helmets that occasionally spawn at the blown up building right next to Wallace the Free States Vendor in Harper's Ferry.
---
All good. Xbox here. 
---
you aim at them and it shows their name like you said.... same with the map.... im so confused
---
Console or PC?
---
Some areas are prone to spawning monsters like places with random encounters, I would avoid building my camp there.
---
Happy cake day
---
I’ll give that a try. Had to go back to knives to get something out of steel while farming other stuff. 
---
Lol sorry I fixed it, diddnt know it does that
---
Why give atoms for SB kills?
---
Oh right..don't want to f-up the revenue quotas do we... 
---
Play long enough that you understand the situation, then leave quietly. There are a few that like the completion of this game, but its not true for most.
---
Have you gotten the Halloween skeleton plans? 
---
it shows addictions but its hard to get one and they only last for a limited time.
---
what does iirc means?
---
People really need to be more aware of this....
---
“I don’t really even care if nobody sees this”
---
Uh.... ok.  So which is it?
---
Later skater
---
Unlike melee stealth, range stealth is easier. My stealth sniper is using full set of unyielding, I don't use sneak perk, the agility boost makes you undetectable.
---
I find they sometimes join together. So you need to erase and redo. Plus I only paid 4k. If you look there are people selling low price.
---
Ah how cut another salty exploiter assuming I am also a cheating scum like themselves. Cute kid... that's my line... heres another trophy... 
---
I have found that if you craft a piece of combat armor put the cheapest mod on it then scrap you have a better chance of unlocking other mods. The BoS mod I think you can only get by buying the plan or or if your lucky technical data. I have unlocked I think all combat armor mods. If your on Xbox I can mod or craft them for you. I also have a ton of 1* legendary combat pieces.
---
Word. I appreciate you taking the time to check it out. 
---
The Nerf finished off for me. Fallout is dead to me.

Was it gta that gave you a dunce cap and made you naked?
---
I have SILO code alpha done and input. Just need a team. Gt is Deckchairs FTW
---
This is so important! Why isn't the dev looking into this? I swear I have wasted more than 1,000 plastics on this.
---
&gt; What? BGS is a computer game company first and foremost. They have said it over and over all of their games are designed for the PC first and then ported to consoles. This game is no different. 
---
The dominance of PCs has long since ended, now most AAA titles are generally made for consoles first then transferred to PC because steam has like dominated the PC side for so long they take too much cut and won’t pay for exclusive content unlike like consoles makers. Of course there are two sides to every coin and the reverse is true for Indy games were sales aren’t guaranteed so the cut that steam takes is outweighed by having a platform to host on. But it can’t be ignored that BGS has always made PC games so it probably why fallout 76 is on pc. 
---
Cheers for the link
---
Hey it's not all that bad :)
---
Negan.

Thanks, I'm on pc though 
---
No worries, sorry I can’t help you!
---
I’ve been attempting to do this exact same thing, scrapping combat armor to get the bos mod. I’m currently on my second character and need this mod. On my main character I was able to server hop Grafton train station and found all three bos mods in 30 minutes. From what I’ve been hearing the only way to get bos mods own is through quest rewards in the cranberry big area. Can anyone back this intel up?
---
Feeling the same way
---
he means the name you give your player when you create them different from the name you see on the map and above their heads which is the same as their bethesda net account username
---
What do you play on?
---
I'll join you. Let me know when you're launching!
---
So, you have no proof of anything, and yet you decide to post here?
---
This only works if you can see your teammates name tag. Sadly, if the teammate and name tag are missing there is no work around. At least that has been my experience.
---
Hey I appreciate you taking the time to check me out mate.
---
Yeah this is exactly why a lot of my friends stopped playing FO76 with me. It was also combined with us doing the DMV quest at the same time.
---
I did this cleaned off all mutations replaced them. After time was up for serum it still says same stuff under effects only -12 hp (class freak lvl 3). Did it fix but not really show it? Or did I waste alot of caps? 
---
When you use the crossbow, the bolts are reused, and available to be looted from a corpse. Not all but, I’d say 50%.
---
past level 50, outside of how many caps you lose on death, levels mean nothing. a lvl 200 attacking a lvl 70 is the same as a lvl 50 attacking a lvl 50.
---
When pvp is an option some people with play that portion of the game and only do the pve side to get gear for the pvp side. Even when it comes to lvl 50+ attacking someone who just went lvl 5. pvp is just part of the game.
---
Hell I don't normally pvp but I saw a supply drop while I was in flatwoods and I sat at the crate for the lvl 17 that came to claim it, if he went wanted (he didnt) I had my shotgun at the ready.
---
Thanks. Didn’t even know it has been one year. Never really used reddit till FO76 came out. Lol. 
---
Stop trolling newbs!
---
The great and wonderful Xbox community
---
You do get diseases from spoil meat even with carnivore.
---
Why contact Bethesda support? To co plain he got killed by another player?
---
I use controllers!
---
I haven't had an issue with controller play, but I only know the experience of a filthy casual. 
---
Huge help and I was able to send a nuke yesterday. This is what I came up with https://i.imgur.com/8LnFmyL.png 
---
That’s all I need! I’m one of those too

---
Are the people there as salty and toxic as I heard or is it just a few
---
It's saved to your account, but not cross platform 
---
Ah, ok
---
Stories like this seem to come from console players. Guessing that crowd is different from the PC crowd as in over 100 hours, not a single person has attacked me without me a) having a bounty or b) holding a workshop. 
---
Unless you’re up for switching platforms, I’d follow the solid advice/tips others have posted. Also keep in mind that although quite unpleasant, griefers make up a tiny portion of the gameplay. Don’t let 1% ruin the 99% for you. 
---
I thought it was just me!!
---
Lolz, reminds me of that saying,  a fool and his money, are easily parted..
---
Srsly, maybe he was trying to learn HOW to pvp..?
---
Yes! When I’m not running my PA/Instigating sledge I pair the cultist dagger with the ritual mask and camo chameleon combat armor.   I like to surprise people in their camp and drop a bunch of spoiled meat and bones and disappear 
---
Makes sense, I was dropping quickly so the theory holds up. Hopefully we get a fix soon! 
---
I completely agree with this, I started playing a couple of days after release and as a massive fan of the franchise I was really disappointed. 
---
However, Bethesda seem to have pulled a miracle out of its arse. It’s vastly improved from its early days and although it still has some way to to go, I have growing confidence it will continue to improve. It has the potential to become something truly brilliant. Oh, and the roadmap looks really exciting too.
---
Remember who else packed people into rail cars for transport?
---
Surely they’re working on fixing it. I just don’t want to scrap my robot models anymore which I’m sure is less of a priority :(
---
I use an old Xbox 360 controller and it works great! If you are used to using one you will do fine
---
I've only used the code that came with the game and in game challenges to get atoms.
---
Easily more than 1k plastic here also. That is the only junk/scrap component that I don't have a min/max on atm because I blew through too many stacks of it rebulking what I was carrying. 
---
I use controller, its great. Only issues are finding somewhere to assign push to talk, and for some reason lately on the world map the sensitivity is cranked.
---
I've heard the same. Haven't seen any evidence of getting it on a quest though 
---
I agree, I would like the Enclave to actually come to WV and set up shop with a real NPC quest hub.. MODUS is too freakin creepy IMO.. but I do agree
---
Cola nut
---
Thank you, I’ve heard this is the case. If so, the junkie build would be incredibly difficult to maintain - definitely not worth the effort imo.
---
And thus, I came to amass a fortune that could buy me Titan.
---
I wanted so bad to love this game. But after the mama dolce quest we were doing on a whim took my X-01 calibrated shock and support said sucks to be you... I quit. I know there are issues with that quest, but we have done it a bunch of times no problem. Heh....
---
At least you got an answer. Got a temp suspension over a week ago with no response to my follow up ticket. Maybe there is hope after all. Never duped but I do do a lot of trades through reddit. Maybe I got some duped meds or serums who knows. Good luck
---
This.
---
Sorry you had to waste the caps, but thanks so much for the reply ! We’re gonna need a hot fix  ASAP Bethesda ❤️ thanks ! 
---
That lumber mill is still the best source of wood in the game 115 levels in and I'm still going there.
---
Well, I tough of if it in my post, i dont know I guess it could pressure them for private servers. Or help them introduce a way of banning people who kill to much, for no reason and get hundreds upon hundreds of bounties a day... I dont know honestly, I only intended it as a solution that could be developed. 
---
It took me 500 hour to even get psycho addiction the first time and then I’ve gotten it 5 times after. So only really ever bothered with one. Chugging down whiskey and never got an alchohol addiction.
---
Thank you for feedback though, appreciate it :) 
---
Id say like 60 percent are toxic for no apparent reason
---
That’s a hella scary person if I saw you I’d probably run like never before
---
Yeah, it was the helmet
---
Lol. My trouble shooting rolling pins gonna teach you lessons 
---
idk why the downvotes i legit just got the game two days ago and i didn't know, sorry. 
---
I may just run with an alcoholic build instead, since the junkie build sounds unsustainable long-term. I just wanted to see if anything had changed with the recent updates and/or if more information had come out. Thanks for your input!
---
Ex COD players lol
---
My instigating deathclaw with all the relevant mutations and perk gets to about 360 a little more if I and whacked out of my mind on chems. But I can one shot most things if I am on a team (herd mentality mutation). 
---
Did anyone read the patch notes thread?  CM addressed this already.
---
&gt; Hey! Yes this will still occur for now. As you mentioned in your other comment, this was introduced when we fixed an issue prevented Bulk from autoscrapping while crafting.
---
&gt; To stop Scrap All Junk from autoscrapping bulk in your inventory, but still allow it to autoscrap from the stash while crafting, we need to introduce some new functionality. This is being worked on, but isn't part of today's patch. We'll definitely let you know when that change is in place and ready to roll out though.
---
Did you read the patch notes thread?  CM addressed this already.
---
Could I add maybe the worst risk v. Reward in almost any game 
---
With Party Boy maxed in charisma you get a +6 Str Buff. Great for Melee. Or if your overencumbered haha.
---
Prepare to be disappointed
---
Not sure there's anything else there anymore
---
I believe fury gives better damage then psycho buff. It is 30% melee damage. Although I have not taken the time to really compare them. 
---
Yeah people are scared of players with high bounties because before the bobble head patch was put in. Seeing a 100+ bounty meant seeing a player who could not die and would one shot you from half a mile a way with an explosive shotgun. 
---
I don’t expect a 3* every time. However I’d like them to be at least scaled to max lvl considering I’m lvl 214. Especially for the ultra rare weapons. 
---
Well now it means naked people with rolling pins lol
---
Yeah haha that build is much more well-tested, and I think I may go for this instead of the Junkie’s unless I can get enough responses to make the experiment worthwhile!
---
It’s not a glitch if it’s a supermutant because some carry stimpacks that for some reason bug and instantly heal them
---
Yeah, they send generic copy/paste crap, pretty dissapointing, but ohwell i guess. 
---
Doing what you describe is toxic is actually really fun and exciting to some, myself included. I honestly wish that Bethesda made this game much more like fallout 3 or fallout 4 but rather is more of an open world survival game more than an RPG. 
---
Once you reach a high enough level and have dont almost everything in the game it gets really stale because there is not much end game content. There is also not much incentive to replay the main story. Additionally you get to a point where you’re maxed on caps so playing the be as rich as possible game ends quickly. Furthermore, much of the rare end game items that players would grind (although I still grind sometimes) is frequently acquired through trades because it’s been mass duplicated. 
---
As a result what’s most enjoyable to some people  is pvp, it’s more unpredictable and dynamic, with decisions and conflicts which the main game is lacking and desperately needs. Although I must admit a guy chasing you down for 20 minutes without you fighting back is excessive. 
---
Personally, I run around servers with friends and see who is interested in fighting back. If someone is unwilling to engage after 5 minutes we move on. What ensues in other circumstances is often an enjoyable pvp war where teamwork and  strategy can often plan into the equation. Additionally raiding bases is another interesting and dynamic form of gameplay. It is particularly hard to role play as factions, raiders, etc. if you have little to no conflict with other players, and many players have to turn to external self imposed role play to fill that desire. 
---
For what it’s worth, I routinely assist low level players with grinding when asked. Additionally I often give away free legendaries, ammo, and supplies to lower level friends and strangers. At a certain point your stash gets so full, that you can help but give back to others. Once the pvp servers go up you won’t have to worry much if any about people attack you,
---
My 2cents hope that helps a bit with having a perspective on why people attack other players, higher, Lower, and same level.
---
Holy macaroni, boi you wouldnt last 10 minutes playing any other survival multiplayer.
---
This changed two patches ago when all the plans became available through the vendors with higher prices. I’d really like a solid answer on this from somebody who has found the bos plans recently.
---
Also there is the fact this isn't really a PvP game, it is more PvE.
---
Well when you run out of ideas. It is good to know you can PvP
---
That's awesome..and it seems like a unique TSE..unlike the common ones everyone has
---
Do a run every day selling up to the max vendors. Between expensive bulks like aluminum, purified water from your water farm, and things like extra chems, you should be able to max your sales every day 
---
Do you enjoy scamming people
---
When even the mobs have nothing better to do than to grief... 😅
---
Do you currently play? What do you find disappointing in it?
---
Maybe I’ll figure it out, maybe I’ll leave on area Mic. Appalachia can listen to my roommates watch TV and discuss D&amp;D shenanigans
---
Thank you. I’m getting quite used to it
---
this is a joke right?
---
I know right? I lost a legendary shotgun to that glitch.
---
Thanks for this. Makes me feel better about not seeing them in a week of farming.
---
The only one I got from scrapping was for the helmet. 
---
It's true that turrets are junk, especially if you like having the room to build a creative camp. That said, in fo4, I used to get them to shoot over shirt walls by setting them on a short box behind the short wall. 
---
Once you complete the “officer on deck” quest for the enclave, go to the armory and use the terminal to get the x-01 plans
---
I read it, but I made this post out of frustration and forgetfulness as I just blew up 20 stacks of steel and 15 stacks of lead, I don't remember how much of the rest. I just try to keep a 2 lead bulk to every steel bulk in my storage. That is why I remember those 2. I keep a max of 100 stacks of bulk lead and usually between 50 and 60 stacks of bulk steel in storage at all times. Most of the rest are kept between 5 and 25 depending on the use. I also try to keep a minimum of of 400 loose screws. That isn't too hard as I almost never even think about that one unless I am making a bunch of items to scrap for mods. 
---
I am currently out gathering plastic to bulk up stuff again so I can sell everything in about an hour to an hour and a half. 
---
Love my controller! Use an Xbox 360 controller.
---
I play mostly PvE with my wife, it's fun and we love it. Once and a while though, I get people like this or who are generally just total asshats. I've come up with three solutions:
---
A. deal with it or leave the server
---
B. Fight them until one of you concedes. 
---
or
---
C. My new personal favorite technique, but you can lose a lot of caps. Be warned. 
---
1. Go back to your base, or move it if it is close by.   
---
2. Equip Ammosmith, Wrecking Ball, Ordinance Express, and Explosives perks
---
3. Create a shit ton of Mini Nukes, or whatever does the most damage for you. 
---
4. Proceed to enemy base.
---
5. Fire at will.
---
This PvP duo, whom I'll concede were considerably more prepared for PvP (Marsupial, and I'm guessing Instigating OH blade, PA), who stole our workshop quit the server after I demolished their base back into oblivion (i stored by stash box so they had to go back to their camp, giving away the position).  And if you happen to be reading this then yeah you deserved that shit. 
---
I noticed that. Just recently.
---
You're either a very angry housewife or a very wacky wastelander
---
Before I clicked, I was going to comment unless it had lasers and explosions It isn't cool.... then clicked... it is cool was not disappointed. 
---
No, xbox...but I've stopped playing at this point anyway.  May come back March 12th.
---
I try not to fast travel; I only end up doing it when a nuke comes in.
---
Theres also the fact that said naked guy can have a lvl 200 team mate nearby, not wanted, that one shots you after you kill the bounty.
---
Lmao
---
If they integrate Xbox live into the game for PC, Microsoft has speech to text available for developers that want to add it..... literally heavy lifting already done for them:

---
I feel you.  I’ve got 1400 screws, 80 bulk springs, 50 bulk aluminium and adhesive, and 50+ bulk lead sitting in stash that I later downsized to sell to make space.  Scrapped all by accident and had to farm both high schools a few times to get enough plastic, then got grief killed and had it all taken from me.
---
Ive go 2 questions and a tip. I thought server hoping for materials wasn't possible. Mostly because camp mclintock never has anything there when i would server hop on 6-8 servers.  Second question. I thought they made it extra annoying to server hop . Like to the point where you have to exit out fo the game entirely so you don't get shoved back into the one you were just in.
---
 Finally id like to say you are really going out of your way for wood. Just south of vault 76 is a lumber milland if you start at 76. YOu can load up on tons of random crap including countless fallen trees to add to the 150-200 count of wood in 10 minutes. IF your actually desperately on a wood bender wv lumber co has a buttload  + Prickets fort has  a decent pile. 
---
We need to wait for the cipher tobbn populate. Anyone can go grab those. I have all of alpha
---
"BLING BLING BOY IS GOD, CHANGE MY MIND"
---
It'd be neat if they made the Strip one big cell. And maybe made the Mojave Wasteland a bit bigger and more open? It felt very closed in, with all the unclimbable mountains and such. But boy, I'd pay _good money_ for that
---
If you are just looking for a good camp spot with a junk harvester and water, go to the sunshine meadows (not sure of the name, west-most river) and look around for a downed tank and spilled logs. There should be a junk pile there that’s close to water. It’s functional but it’s hard to decorate. The enemies that are there rarely spawn and the hardest they get are no more that 5 low level scorched.
---
Cool.
---
It's not that I want it to be "easy"...I want it to be repeatable and enjoyable.
---
Requiring me to sit idly by along a stretch of road for hours at a time hoping that the legendary vendor walks past me isn't a fun or interesting way to spend my time. I got other things to do with my life (shrug).
---
Speaking of which...
---
"The cost of the ammo is really high..."  
---
It's never been hard to get Ultracite ammo. People act as though it takes an entire day just to craft one reload's worth of Ultracites when the reality is you spend 30mins in a well-placed nukezone and you'll acquire the resources for a few hundred rounds of whatever type you wish to make. Not much different than farming for normal rounds, really.   
---
Makes me wonder if it's just that you can't just go out and do it on a whim--The choice to grab the materials requires the alignment of fleeting factors; the motivation in tandem with an available nukezone, etc. To me, that's the reason. Not necessarily the amount of time or effort actually invested, which gives the process the illusion of being more 'costly', but because it has to be available to be done when people feel like doing it... Lack of convenience might as well be tantamount to climbing mount Everest to some people, after all.
---
In the shopping center? He's fighting the other robots..just server hop til he's there
---
shhh we don't  want big beth to nerf that spot
---
No I'm just a naked guy
---
It doesn't work for me, why's that
---
I got back into the game a week ago after a long break. I was trying to to own the Grafton Steel workshop just so I could craft the Mothman sign. The game crashed while I was clearing out the workshop. I raged quit.  Then a couple days later, I gave it another chance and the server I got into crashed right after I got the workshop. To this day, I still can't craft the damn sign. Hell, I couldn't even stay in the game for 15 minutes without any issue.
---
Like, for f\_ck sake, Bethesda, where is the money I gave you went to? I can't help but feel like Bethesda just rob me.
---
Is a 360 controller better than Xbox 1 controller? I have Xbox 1 controller. It works with my Steam Box
---
With enough soap you can blow up just about anything though 
---
Oh yeah... The upper 20s to low 40s grind is a bitch. Plus Rose wants you to rush all over the map, and the next quest chain will force you into the Mire and the bog. It'll take you to about mid 40s before before it starts feeling a little more balanced.
---
What level are the enemies and what are they?
---
Actually no, what about people who picked up junk not knowing it was duped, even if they purged it, they still had it fo through their account. If it happened within a month of the ban wave, they were banned. How if that fair?
---
OMG... I just sold one to a vendor thinking it was worthless...
---
I've found that a lot more needs to be done level up between quest line ventures. If thier are hoards of enemies, I've generally needed to be a considerable amount higher level. However, I do not play a hardcore character, just play for fun.
---
Don't worry, the struggle makes it realistic :)
---
Yeah, I got a temp ban on this sub for ranting over someone taking my drop when I was full of stuff I was using to replenish my stores. I made the mistake of mentioning the moron's screen name and basically asking for a witch hunt. Oops, I get frustrated sometimes and forget the rules in a lot of the reddit subs. I got suspended in the 76 marketplace once. I simply stated my opinion on the price of something that someone was selling. The admin messaged me, told me I was suspended for some time frame. I don't remember what it was all about now, but it was something stupid and I did not feel that I had broken the rule that was being enforced on me. I laid into him, I don't think I used the big 4 curse words, but I used words that offend people that get bruised if you look at them funny and quit that sub. Me, I try to be as straightforward as I can. If I make a mistake, or obviously break a rule, I will apologize and take my punishment, but on something that is very subjective with no way of defending against the mod or admin, I don't need those people or their subs. 
---
Another survivor sold it to them, I’d assume. 
---
No idea, I'm sat in SILO alpha right now and I've put it in 
---
This happened to me today until they game froze then crashed causing my Xone to shut off. The game has crashed on me numerous times in the past but its never shut my system down. Farmed Whitesprings after nuking it today and every glitch happened mentioned in this thread happend to us. The game also didnt give us credit for killing a Grafton monster  for the weekly challenge. 
---
This is brilliant definitely bumping this with an updoot
---
Read the description, it says you cannot attack but others can attack you.
---
Ok ok good point. Tbh I've found him 1 time but I'm never actually looking so take it for that. But yes if you are lookin all the time which I suppose I should to get more plans and such. I wonder what will happen In survival when ppl are preying on others at vendors?? That's what I'm ready for really.  And really I'm  curious about the nuclear winter content, and wastlanders content!! I thought survival would complete me but BGS  new gamemap messed me up and while I'm ready for March 26th I wanna know what the hell we are in for with the new stuff too!!
---
Dip something else, come back later. 
---
&gt;Also, this could just be coincidence, but I get much better legendary rolls if I let it heal all the way back up before killing it.
---
People keep repeating this. Pretty sure it's bullshit.
---
That vendor is savage and he’s most likely taking on the whole of Watoga and he won’t stop to trade until they are all dead.
---
What if they're developing a 76 expansion set in the capital wastes, built on a remastered version of the Fallout 3 map?
---
My bad, typed the code wrong, amended it in original post. Rookie fucking mistake or what 😂
---
Nah, it was literally any kind of enemy. It wasn't the full auto-heal I've read about here either. When you shoot someone you can see how much life you've taken off of them and their health bar gets "dimmed" to show the amount of damage you did. Then after a second it starts to take that life away from them. As soon as their life actually started going away, it would stop. The remaining bar wasn't dimmed anymore and they wouldn't lose nearly as much health as I had hit them for. Hard to explain.
---
Get good .  If you suck then you die in the wasteland I got to experience you wanted you wanted to play with other people in fallout not everybody's nice if you're not going to the game you're going to die a lot if you don't have resources in the game going to die a lot you don't have friends that build stuff you're going to die a lot and if you think that ruins a player experience guess what fallout was meant to be a single player game not a multiplayer monstrosity so if you're complaining do what everybody else did and just play fallout 4 instead of playing this crappy amalgamation and stop giving Bethesda money for bad games and then maybe you'll have a better player experience go figure where you can complain about the wall of turns at somebody went and spent the time to build an AFK farm everything so they could actually have fun with their version of the game or maybe you should just not go to that base go figure?
---
I play on xbox also and have rarely crossed paths with a toxic player. In my own experience, most people are either friendly or want to be left alone. Those that have tried to fight with me have been pretty easy to avoid and that’s only been a handful of times. 
---
But you don't get xp for killing with turrets just the loot. 
---
Whenever I see people with a 100+ cap bounty they usually have lvl 200+ buddies around that will one shot you if you try to kill their wanted friend.
---
Lol. Not for me
---
I had to stop there too and level up a bit untill I could use the power armour I had stored, also started using melee
---
Ah, yeah that's trash
---
Sometimes if you ignore the enemy for long enough or it loses interest in you, it’s health automatically comes back.
---
Wait so then what the fuck's the difference between a non-star legendary and a 1-star legendary?
---
It's a positive feedback loop. Negative feedback loops cancel themselves out, positive feedback loops amplify themselves.
---
Positive feedback Example: "If a microphone picks up the amplified sound output of loudspeakers in the same circuit, then howling and screeching sounds of audio feedback (at up to the maximum power capacity of the amplifier) will be heard"^[1]
---
Negative feedback:

---
Most of what I run into are level 50-60 ghouls/wendingos or scorched zealots. Guess I gotta get to those levels to have a better shot
---
Mad Max would sue the pants off them. 
---
There are some good ideas for survival mode, but please leave the generalists alone in adventure. I switch perks in battles and like the system the more I play and build my set.
---
Harder enemies in the north of savage divide would be good. Anything that builds the lore
---
Good to know. Thanks.
---
I just got a stalkers rolling pin
---
Yep. I can move for a second and generally crouch, then am frozen for what sems like an eternity. 
---
Why do you even want an instigating rolling pin for? 
---
I end up as a little lower level than the hoards but do ok as long as I keep my distance and pick a few off first. Haha just feel like I'm not involved in the storyline when grinding
---
Yeah but how can you tell in a SBQ fight? Theres so many people. And when you're alone your enemies dont have enough hp.
---
Working in the excavator armor questline now, ammo has been a bitch to keep track off. Build has been pretty fun focused so far 
---
I’ve seen Grahm 3 times. I seen him walking through a nuked Whitesprings twice and once walking on the road by Top of the World. 
---
Do you have a workshop, this means you're flagged for PvP, as an added bonus with pacifist mode on you can't fight back untill you go 8nto the menu and change it. Here's hoping the fuck off PvP all together from adventure mode when they launch survival. 
---
Because ive done SBQ solo before unlike you.
---
It is worthless. But they are a meme. I legit just killed a lvl 55 with a rolling pin. It was hilarious
---
For the memes. I killed a lvl 55 with one. 
---
I am just a shy person. I would rather type than voice chat. That simple.
---
Yes it’s a bug and it is back again.  It came back in the patch before the most recent one.  The BGS community moderators said they are looking into it.  For me it seems to happen more often with handmade and combat rifles.
---
Absolutely I loved the raider armors in three compared to four and 76. Looked much more sadist-ish, less junky, and less bulky.
---
I like your style.
---
But healing salves are so much easier to craft..jk..good work ..thx for sharing 
---
I have destroyed some on the golf course. I ran into one outside the walls to whitesprings, it had 2 missile turrets and 2 heavy mg turrets with one facing away from WS. I left it alone since it was only protecting from the random spawn that the robots didn't kill. 
---
Phoenix is very protective of his little Super Duper Mart and will gladly take on a half dozen or more other protectrons and various other robots. So if he's not in his shop, check the alley behind his shop and sometimes even over by the crashed vertibird or just listen for the angry robots and laser fire.
---
Just go to whitespring resort wearing a suit and keep server hopping 
---
I *live* there. Multiple characters; all the same(-ish) CAMP. Till they drop turret cost, or raise the budget, I shan’t move. 
---
Yeah...there's an achievement for it, so the like..3-4 times It's happened i've gone to someone I know to give em that point towards that total. 
---
The system's frustrating. Sometimes you get one and you don't know why, Sometimes people grief in non-bounty forming ways to push people into "attacking" them...it's all nutty. 
---
I thought it was a mole-miner
---
The spinning wheel glitch pisses me off. I have had it on 7 out of 23 SBQ kills. Friend got ultracite jp and i got a damn loading icon.
---
Dopppppeeeeee
---
You aren’t forced to use fast travel either. 
---
Do u have the healing salves recipe? It's one of the first quests..problem solved
---
Thank you! Quicker than Nuka crypt 💖
---
I don't think canned foods count
---
I’ve killed a behemoth, deathclaw and scorchbeast and none of them updated the quest.  I’m on pc. I think it’s bugged
---
I completely obliterated a turret/missile farm behind WS golf club tonight.  When I walked out the back the owner started firing and I fucked him and his camp up proper like.  Then he came back with another player and I did it again.  Keep it up fuckos! 
---
I had this happen to me once. Logged into to whitesprings with glowing ghouls everywhere but it wasn't a nuke zone
---
They needed an excuse so you will find ok to only have the option to shoot them out...
---
Ay chief, howd ya solve it?
---
I do not know how they have coded the game. It is also safe to assume that the best course of action is being discussed by the leads.
---
He best thing to do is invest in the high priced items (5-10k and up) then worry about maxing caps last
---
I never played Rust, I don't even remember it ever being released. I see it mentioned quite a bit on this sub for comparison. Who made it, and was it truly that bad?
---
Also, BGS could easily make the parts of the course that initially surrounds the buildings a no camp zone. Or better yet, give the robots 'God' powers to destroy any camps on the golf course grounds and the camp owners/teammates without being able to be damaged. I would pay a few thousand caps just to watch that happen. 
---
DOnt forget that these are the people eating tide pods.  It shouldnt be a surprise that they like to play with and or eat shit.
---
Hey, are you still selling serums? I’m interested in getting Marsupial, Electrically Charged, Healing Factor, and Speed Demon.
---
I don't. I have t51 torsos and know the plans, though!
---
Well u came off as rude..good job
---
Congrats! It’s Your lucky day :)
---
Calm down Brock Samson.
---
You counteract the asshole design by blowing their shit up.  I mean, it’s one thing if you are making an effort it’s another to not even try and homie don’t play that shit.  Eat some lead and relocate.
---
Most everyone who was helping me solve has gone on to greener pastures, or got silently suspended/banned.
---
So as rough as it is, it is up to the community to solve it now and i will update the site when its found.
---
Rule 3
---
Cool idea
---
Title sounds like an advertisement for a glory hole
---
Hails yes I am down with TEA!  
---
Gulpers have a natural regen w/o the legendary modifier, and the running when they are at low health is something they will do sometimes.
---
Is this 12k or 20k
---
I'm trying to guard these death prone teenagers 
---
I would be super amped for a covert ops commendation.  A gauss composite stock would be really interesting as well.
---
I used http://fo76codebreaker.online with no codeword, it gave me 12 possible combos and then the third was correct! I only had 4 keycards and was playing on my own though!
---
How many two handed melee damage perks do u have
---
Protections are weaker in the crotch than the torso 
---
 I don’t believe so as the patch notes didn’t mention anything about increase in damage. While I find it easier to take on scorchbeasts now, I find it harder to take on the Queen after recent patches. Haven’t been able to have a successful Queen kill.
---
Why are we screaming 
---
It could be fun, but I don't think it will happen. If you remember, survival in fallout 4 was highly immersive and did not have fast travel.
---
I like this idea. It'll be dangerous to destroy whitespring turret camps though. Some asshole will have 10 TSE minigun going 
---
The screech attack was nerfed so it only happens once every 10 seconds instead of unlimited duration. As a result the attacks themselves got more strong to compensate.
---
anyone have Charlie yet?
---
Yes that's what they are
---
Unpopular opinion but why just not let the game die? It's obvious that Bethesda doesn't care about it nor has the talent to fix it. There are way better games out there.
---
What were the silo code pieces if you dont mind me asking?
---
I may be interested but later 
---
Confirmed. As of now.
---
Game is dope. Approaching 400 hours
---
I say you gives them a choice 
---
1) you want one of these (motioning to all rise) 
---
2) you want to talk to this guy (motioning to TSE) 
---
Pick your poison beotch 
---
I though no loot appear on the corpses of the enemies killled by turrets (if you dont hit with any other weapon before they die) same way I guess you dont get the experience.
---
Hello member
---
Yeah that’s a really cool idea. I’m guessing the quest/event would involve actually reinstalling the rails since most of it broke off. A quest related to-
---
SPOILERS AHEAD
---
-the time machine Easter egg would be good one since that’s monorail related as well.
---
Non PA raider armor? i am soo confused
---
I never had an issue with gathering stims at a lower level (pharma phama was amazing for me and still is. Although I wish it would give me more blood packs  lol). So I never had to make large quantities of healing salves. I have seen it mentioned in other posts in the comments about this subject. So I added it to my post. As well as other suggestions and advice I have received in the comments. 
---
Wait there is a link to a site that shows an image of what the plans make?! That is something I've been looking for a whle now
---
Dont waste time on what probably is a F4 + F76 repack
---
Like just regular raider armor plans to craft. 
---
I've got a piece that reduces ammo weight and another that reduces junk by 20% saw another one at a vendor that reduced chems by 20%. 
---
I'm always sending trade offers at whitesprings to compare the loot we get 
---
Unless you are on a team NPCs will regain most if not full health if you die and come back to an area.
---
unless we are given perment servers loss on death is acceptable.  Stash limits also play a factor.
---
Wish they just had 1.5 times normal health instead, the regeneration makes them invincible for about 2 seconds while there bar is refiling.
---
My main source of food is soup..so at the same time ..I always farm healing salves ..I rarely ever use stims..only when I'm out of salves 
---
What are you playing on? PC, PS4, XBONE?
---
I punch em with me death tambo 
---
Yeah... I didn't watch it before because I assumed what he was referring to was akin to an actual bug I've had before but I just watched his. That's definitely how they all are normally.
---
Actually is fast travel from indoors the thing that have no sense (as never was in the franchise)
---
Can You? Yes
---
Will You? Nope
---
Forbidden knowledge drops them a lot. I sold like 150 to vendors today.
---
I'd rather have an app that lets you modify your camp or repair and upgrade weapons and bulk items for you so you can just log in and go right to selling
---
Technically correct in engineering contexts but I believe my meaning was clear. 
---
I sell all of my chems
---
becuase there is people that will just expend another 100+ h in the game just for it... so why to fix it? It makes people keep online for longer
---
Yes you buy them from the vendors. I've been trying to get them forever, wo far only have arms and chest
---
More than just that. Additionally folks who hace exploited the games dupe systems and other glitches and bugs have weapons that do thousands of points of dmg. The game is broke, simple as that. I love it, but it's broke AF.
---
Warframe does exactly this. PC players get shit sooner, but we're also pretty much the guinea pigs for all the bugs and such. Later, stuff is packed into one big update for consoles.
---
can you make me a lvl 50 one? i live in europe though so im not sure what the time difference is.
---
How do you get that mod
---
There is now, it is called snowflake parents raising snowflake children. Just like many leagues don't keep score anymore. Too many people can't take the knowledge that they lost, or were not the best at every thing they do. 
---
My personal favorite is to the people that cry that something is not fair is to tell them that their parents lied to them every day of their life about how good they were, about life, and especially about fairness. My oldest daughter was complaining to me a couple of weeks ago that everyone is telling her and her boyfriend how ro raise their child (we were offering tips based off of experience, his parents also) and she was tired of everyone telling her what she has to do, and nobody has told her that she has done a good job on raising her son. I couldn't help myself, I started laughing my ass off at her. I simply said that almost nobody will start saying the good job bit until your child is like 10 years old, that is if you are lucky. She then made the mistake of saying to me that wasn't fair. I literally fell to the floor laughing. When I could breathe, I simply asked her if she or her mother had ever told her that anything in life was fair? If looks could kill, I probably would have been ashes like what a laser leaves behind. After that she smiled and realized what I did. I let her focus pure rage, hate, and whatever other post partum issues she was going through and take them out on me. My daughter has a bachelor's degree in psychology and a master's and LSW or whatever it is in Social Work. She still hates that I am a high school dropout and that I still am able to outsmart her, especially on a psychological level. But I also proofread almost every paper she ever wrote from elementary school until she finished her Master's dissertation. She also told me that she will do like I did with her child(ren) and always encourage him/them without every deceiving them into believing that anything is actually fair. 
---
If you read this far, then you are better than me lol. Oh and I believe that BGS should put a stop to people camping at whitesprings. I also believe that the douches that are so negative about anything and everything in this sub should, well they are douch bags they will continue to be this way because they have mental issues that need to be addressed by professionals. 
---
update for people still interested uranium fever is still looking to farm the event is almost guaranteed to spawn 3 lvl 40 mole miners with 3 star legendary. they however are now limited to dropping lvl40 gear.    So if you are ok with lvl 40 gear farm here, if you want lvl 50 try some of the other suggested places. 
---
True enough. Raiders are assholes.
---
This.  If you can’t handle the pvp elements of the game then you should probably pick a different game.  And the pvp elements in this game are so watered down compared to others.  Your base getting destroyed is nothing.  It takes so little to repair everything.  You’d last about 5 minutes in Everquest or Dayz.  This game is a cakewalk in terms of penalties for death.  
---
They also get stronger btw...
---
I mean, that one should probably apply universally, in or out of Appalachia
---
Started a post and asking for a fix. I got downvoted and told to re-acquire all my mutations and pay again.Now i see reports that it's not even a sure thing and that the bug might come back either way.

I think MODUS was manipulating the promotion system as hard as he could to get you lightspeed fast-tracked to General. But you could be right.
---
Nothing aside from the fact one regens and one doesn't. 
---
Anti-Armor, Faster Swing Speed SWITCHBLADE. Its my favorite. 
---
Based on the zone levels, you should probably be in the Ash Heap 'til 35, but yeah, the spawn range in the divide is 15-99.
---
its already the same engine, more probably a F4 + F76 bundle
---
Don't forget insomnia. And you need bottles to carry water.
---
They are very rare drops from quests in the Savage Divide. Not sure where else. I got a plan from the One Silent Night event
---
Gonna take a ride down to the GolfClub cave and see if there's any left. BRB
---
&gt; GTA was doing it for a time too.
---
GTAO never did this for *cheaters*. The dunce cap and griefer matchmaking were for players who "misbehaved" but within the rules of the game.
---
Cheaters don't even get banned because for the most part the mod menus are apparantly undetectable.
---
But make the mistake of joining multiplayer with a high-res testure pack installed and you're banned.
---
Psn ? 
---
Would be cool
---
If anything, they were nerfed. Increased duration between screeches, and the attacks count as explosive, so the Fireproof card and a dense torso mod basically negate them.
---
I run carnivore and a melee build so I very rarely have soups, but I will be damned if I do t have a stack of glowing meat steaks on me at all times. Lol.  I drink boiled water so I can use all my purified to dilute stims. I never thought I would have to start transferring them over to an alt character due to weight even with rank 3 traveling pharmacy. 300 regular stims, 300 diluted, 200 RadAway, and like 200 diluted RadAway tends to add up. Gained like 50lbs of carry weight when I started transferring them. Lol. 
---
Minor bugs....we are talking New Vegas right?  Sorry just made me chuckle.  Honestly I would enjoy either 3 or New Vegas done with the Fallout 4 engine.
---
I just trade everyone. never know if they have something they are trying to get rid of or other way around
---
easy to bypass, because that doent count fanmade creations... also it was easy just make sure they use the original voices fille, while they dont incluide it, so the people needs to extract their own file from the original game (if they had it) in order to play the "mod"
---
Used a lot of times in a lot of mods.. the modders were just using a excuse... and nope,. as llong as I know its not "on the way" its just totaly stoped.
---
I'd buy if it's not Beth Launcher exclusive.
---
I can't understand this mechanic. Why the hell isa non-wanted player able to kill another non-wanted player that just killed a wanted player? Wanted players shouldn't have support from any friends while they keep their status. That's BS
---
Where the hell is the thruster? 
---
You're missing a 2%.
---
Well, armor weight affects stealth. So leather is pretty light, it’s a good choice. Light/ultralight mods reduce its weight even further. Beyond that, if you don’t have Escape Artist perk yet, something like Muffled leg mods might help. 
---
nice post and good ideas. Id like to see legendary hemelts and headgear with unique buffs/debuffs only seen from headgear along with int scaling on all gear
---
You too? Same here
---
He is the 2%
---
Pacifist only prevents you from damaging other players. It doesn't stop other players from slap-damaging you, but it will prevent you from acidentally entering full PvP.
---
I like the cultist dagger, still sticking to only trading for the Gauss and Hunting rifle?
---
Ps4
---
Bethesda needs to heed this if they want to make the game what it should be. A multiplayer fallout. 
---
Why didn't you just destroy his turrets, hope servers, or go elsewhere? Like any other mature adult would.
---
oh brother ..  this game, man...
---
And literally the entire game is littered with it lol
---
No they did for the last one. u/waffle_cop Can confirm.
---
Just an update. I went to the next step in the quest, did what you would typically do if the terminal wasn't bugged out, no progress was made.
---
I can also confirm that this is a working code, thanks!
---
Alpha 91688167
---
Cheers
---
I thought that too but I looked at the quest marker today and it said "go to the Clarksburg post office". When I got in it said "research the key".
---
The 2 areas right next to Top of the World (Pleasant Valley Ski Resort and South Cutthroat Camp) tend to have high-level enemies. Approach Top of the World from the west or south and you'll be fine.
---
Its not a 2-shot.  Just explosive unfortunately.  
---
I don't think a TSE is possible anymore post-nerf?  I thought it was now either or.
---
But why?
---
PC
---
That's happened to me at the fort defiance event. Killed three scorchbeasts. Looted one, mediocre drops. Second had no loot at all. Third straight-up disappeared before I could get to the body. No meat pile or anything. 
---
Mirelurk king?
---
They do half damage for 3 in game hours if they run out of caps and can’t cover their bounty. Still I agree with a set amount of times you can seek revenge tho.
---
I don't think I kept one of those but I have an awesome 3-star golf club on PC...
---
Also, I don't know how to post pics on reddit, sorry...
---
If you look at the picture, OP's base also happens to be right next to the golf course.
---
I don't think it means a literal winter, but that would be cool to see. Either way I'm hoping it's a better take on survival, scarcer items requiring you to manage resources better. No fast travel, death drops everything but PvP is disables. Inclement weather is far more powerful 
---
Oh yeah mate, 
---
Harley started out as my secondary character that ended up being my main, As literal copy of Harley Quinn as i could get in game. So my insane juggalo went melee, found the slugger outfit, put on some pretty clown makeup and swung a bat for a good bit. Before switching to a bloodied sledge hammer with a searing rocket mod hidden in a croquet mallet skin. At least she was a she... not these days,  between all the radiation and subsequent voluntary experimentation with enclave, which resulted in some uhm.. ah .. nah...." mutations", she is a little more manly these days. still quite as insane as ever the mo is to run head first into things that everyone runs away from. *though Harley looks like a ultra marine so ive started working on alts more.* 
---
The there is Cooper aka Face (01, no seriously select face 01,) with pretty lite blue/grey eyes that i said god dang that looks like Bradley Cooper... if there was going to be the guy that catches a diseases from using lady killer this was him... He was the first out vault, he was really disappointed to find his first lady was some sort of insane ginger with green punk hair that kept saying "not us"... though he still managed to come back with a disease. Hes ex military and focuses on rifles and goes for that stealthy sniper vibe. He mostly just kills from afar like the classic rifle build. He doesn't have much of a story beyond being sexy but there's always the rad worms 
---
After those two came Stinky Pete, he looks like what happens when you roll down a hill in a trash can with out cleaning it out first. He literally focused on all of the perks that were based on looting, carrying stuff and sneaking around. i think i have like 3 points i can use for "offense" so his primary MO is to sneak and run away, which he does really good. I do have serendipity on him which i used on my melee main so the idea is he dodges some stuff and some stuff he doesn't dodge. For the most part he wears the scavengers outfit and the torn rags. though pete is a member of the brother hood of steel and at level 20 was able to get the down into the glassed cavern and started to try and take on the scorched beast down there to prove his worth not more a day ago. And we would have done it too if it wasnt for those dang feral ghouls that snuck up behind him.. and those 3 broken rifles... or the fact he ran out of 4 different kinds of ammo, then died and came back a 2nd time and got the same beast down to 20% health. .... He fought hard, even decided he liked the taste of ghoul and became a cannibal to heal up some needed health. oh man that was a good fight, Stinky Pete is a tough lone wander...he mostly uses pipe weapons and has chameleon gear from level 10 up to 50 with a full set waiting for him. 
---
Then along comes Money, Who i can never play with out going  "*Mon-Money* , *Every time I think that I'm the only one who's lonely Someone calls on. me. And every now and then I spend my time in rhyme and verse And curse those vaults.. i leave. but along come Money.. Mon-Money. then along comes Money"* (okay bad ass the game loaded usually by this point)... Money Loves money, at least he loves caps, he does cry every time he scraps pre war cash into cloth.  He is what i get when i max Charisma just for the sake of maxing it along with some random other stats that are mostly team based. He's the guy that comes along and can lend you any skill, even the 5 point skills. He always sells stuff for max caps and gets the best prices cause hes that sorta guy. He has a line up of medic weapons i cant use cause he isn't level 50 yet. But i throw anything with a medic prefix on him. 
---
Then there is Grog, who is named after grog on critical role, he doesn't speak very much because he isnt that sort of type, all of my heavy weapons and heavy ammo go to him.  I havent had much of a chance to flesh him out past this point but i have a couple of anti armor heavies on him that will really help out. 
---
At some point there was, what currently is my  6th Character that was created on a 2nd account. With the intention of setting of a trader on xbox, so that character is in infancy at this time but i can totally say that they are 100% a member of the [Vault Tec Corporation](https://account.xbox.com/en-us/clubs/profile?clubid=3379845807786406) 
---
Well yeah, but I really, really want to see at least the need to use gas mask, that would of bee so cool.
---
I’m with you in theory, but how would a backpack add more carry weight than power armor?
---
That line caught my attention too. Afaik no one got banned who didn't have a plausible case against them. 
---
I've killed her with two level 50s who only had regular gatling guns and a level 25 rifle build. So actually I've killed a tougher SBQ than you by myself.
---
I understand, but i used 10 plasma grenades thrown 2 back to back at a time plus a TSE handmade. I went from having just repaired it to broke it. I also had just killed a swarm of gulpers including a 3 ☆ at the Carson family bunker across from the dyer chemical plant. My handmade broke so I jumped to my camp fixed it, then jumped to Dyer chemical. The legendary gulper was to my right and below in the creek or river. Trust me, this was a bugged fight. 
---
if you do a queen run and cant loot the mobs or queen WAIT!!! I was with maybe 10 people who killed a SBQ from a nuke I launched, I couldn't loot ANYTHING!!! But I was bored and had patience I went around looking at bodies for almost 30 minutes but finally they started being lootable and I got every one. This isn't acceptable, and needs to be fixed but I did manage to get a thousand pounds of loot several legendaries "all junk".... I launched the nuke to just catch the prime site on the edge of nuke and we pulled the queen out of the radiation so that helped fighting and waiting.
---
I  have a bunch of suppressor switch blades for some reason, I also have some greaser jackets so i could form a gang and kill something really slow
---
So your still expecting everyone installing a game to install and log into yet another app to use something that should be part of the game?
---
Next time you go get tires, plan on stopping by another place to get them balanced.  Yea, that's convenient....Just like when PDF files used to have to be downloaded, then you go to fire up Adobe and import it to read it.  People forget - the "good ole days" were not that good most of the time.
---
I get the toxicity - I play BF too!  At least you don't have to go to a separate client and can mute/hide it.
---
necro on this thread, but did you ever tame a gulper anywhere?
---
Naw, the nuclear blast was too far away. 😎
---
Nice screen grab though. Perfectly timed. 
---
I had a simular issue on PS4. I had to exit the game completely to clear it.
---
The problem with this is that if you give helmets functionality it quickly becomes a must to have to be competitive and the ordinary apparel headwear becomes unused by everyone but hardcore role players. By keeping functionality away the headwear is a free choice. While I myself can agree with what you want it would go against what the Devs have tried to do with apparel, and thus I doubt it will happen.
---
SHHHH my TSE .38 auto is my secret... 
---
10/10 want more noot
---
So maybe youre really saying you want a mod weight reduction perk and not a weapon one. eh eh...
---
Well it needs to be fixed. Also you missed the big points about a lvl 36 one shotting me at 104. i don't play so random asshole players who are half my level can hunt me down and one shot me, i also don't want to run down players and shoot them for no reason.  i play to have a fun pve experience with my family and friends which is frankly being ruined by the mechanics. 
---
Why are so many people determined to make a problem where there isn’t one?
---
The person you are complaining about is using game mechanics, working as intended. No abuse or exploits. 
---
You have an issue with this and wish to avoid it? Hop server. This isn’t to be negative, harsh or rude. It’s the quickest most logical solution to this issue people doesn’t seem to be clever enough to simply avoid.
---
He's a douchebag for going after you but what he's doing initially by farming Whitesprings with turrets is actually a very clear idea and he should not be punished for doing it. So basically, you're a big whiny baby who didn't quite deserve to get stomped on like you did, but a whiny baby all the same.
---
IMO. 
---
Power Armor doesn’t seem like it should carry anything besides your body anyways. 
---
we need factions I wanna be b.o.s. not just pretend to be... that being said energy weapons are still trash af
---
Correct me if I’m wrong, but pvp is enabled on the Fallout 76 servers. Which means player versus player. It’s part of the game for a reason. Yeah it absolutely sucks to have your base destroyed, but it’s part of the game. So now you retaliate and fuck up his camp and teach him a lesson. It’s the apocalypse it’s not supposed to be fair and neighborly 😅

They can't one shot you unless you enable a pvp mode like workshops or join a party with someone who shoots someone else. If someone takes your workshop you could just go to a different server. If someone is chipping away at you with slap damage you can just fast travel away from them. That's your options.
---
They should expand the Pip-boy phone-app from FO4 by adding it to FO76 and add CAMP and crafting menus to it as well.
---
After my motorcycle wreck I put 300+ hours into Darksouls in about the same amount of time. It's easy to do it when you're not able to move or leave the house. Saying they don't have a life is fucked for those that don't have a option.  
---
I did a lot better on my second character even as a low level.
---
2handed Melee and strong guns.
---
A level 30 all rise is perfect for you
---
For me, gathering ticks is currently bugged (on a PC).  When I kill multiple, it only shows as single recovered.  I do gather the blood packs at the vendor so I collect at least 2 during the daily selling-grind cycle.
---
However, I am now crafting healing salves and saving on stimpacks unless I really need to use them.  Pretty easy to find the ingredients by the river/bridge close by the Overseer initial camp.  I have a stimpack and healing salve in the quick access.  When I see I am getting low, I hit the healing salve(s) first and then stimpack if really needed. 
---
I wish they hadn't nerfed the Watoga stimpack farm.  Maybe lower it but to get rid of it seems ... spiteful.  Plenty of farm areas for other things, why just nerf stimpacks and not clipboards, phones etc.
---
FWIW - I don't like using the diluted formula.  I don't think it does enough when you are swarmed like at the Whitesprings club house and especially during a nuke event.
---
Building a weapon should also produce appropriate materials.  Anytime I build something out of a box, I have parts left over.
---
I too would like some kind of pause button besides the Quit option.
---
Even if it's just a button prompt on the pause menu to induce an afk timer that is 25 minutes long that'll leave you invisible and unnoticeable.
---
I get that afk'ing takes us bandwidth and an open space in the server but if it's genuinely because we need to put the game down to do something but it's not going to be a long enough incursion to force us to server hop essentially, then why not give us an option to do so that can only be triggered while [HIDDEN] and away from enemies and outside of workshops.  25 minutes, why not?
---
Good! You understand the point of the game then! 
---
My guess is it will be like the FROST mod for fo4 on PC.
---
Im sure someone has already said this, but there are some complaining about regeneration in general, but the majority are acknowledging that Legendary enemies health does regenerate, but only once. The bug they are bringing attention to in their posts is the one that, after they already regenerate once as they should, damaging them to a certain threshold causes their health to instantly return to full. No regeneration effect.
---
Chameleon armor piece and crouch.
---
Ur off tge radar and map
---
I would, but I'm not online 
---
Cant wait to craft 200,000 quantum untracite ammo in a 30 day period
---
Yeah they broke it with the latest patch, the previous one worked.
---
Can confirm this bug.  This happened to me only with my own name popping up.  I had disconnected my mic as it picked up noise and the prompt indicating I was speaking perma-displayed and persisted between a log out and in.  I had to close application (on ps4) to make it go away.
---
Turns out they are all very susceptible to being killed
---
I feel your pain.  I have quickly quit out of the game to respond to my child post bedtime.
---
For all of use who would use this for a just cause, there are those who would abuse it.
---
I can see a butthead activating this afk immunity on and off to quickly jump someone and go afk immune to wait out the retaliation.  
---
Sadly this is the price we parents pay in online gaming, no pause button. :)
---
I have an anti-armor rolling pin...
---
Surely this needs to happen
---
I was so surprised when I found my first combat helmet, only to find out it didnt offer any protection.
---
Your ideas a re great
---
Are you a heavy guns build? If not and ur on Xbox I'll buy that minigun from you
---
What platform
---
Yep, tick blood and booze would be great reason to go there.
---
I spam diluted and they do even less with the healing factor mutation without class freak (roughly 13% for initial burst if I remember correctly). I compulsively dilute them. I don’t know why. Just like I can not avoid picking up anything with screws. Lol. I have like 500 stims and it just is never enough.   
---
I'm on PS4 sorry
---
someone level 180 last week posted he finally got a TSE drop..it was a black-powder pistol..ur gun still seem awesome..last week at WS I got a 2* zealots handmade..I was really excited..might have been the best gun drop for me
---
It's not really PvP I'm worried about. I've been hidden in chameleon armor, and an AI enemy must have randomly bumped into me, causing agro.
---
I'll pass. I prefer to play straight up. I'm weird like that....
---
My server spawned without delay at least 2 legendary enemies in every area I went to today including two legendary super mutants at my own camp upon fast traveling in.
---
Two legendary radrats at sugar grove.
---
Like 5 legendary protectrons just going from watoga station to watoga shopping plaza.
---
It was...  A *legendary* day to say the least.
---
I don't care if they listen or not, It's a rant.   
---
Just like how I don't care if Metro Exodus' controls are ever un-fucked, because they're utter garbage trash and playing the game feels like pulling teeth. Not because it's a bad game, but because it's gameplay is so shitty it makes it hard to even stomach playing. I can give my opinion of something without giving a shit if anything is done about it. I'm not so self important to think my opinion matters whatsoever. There's a lot of dumbasses in the world that think they're right about everything so if we all got our way the world would be a pretty stupid fucking place. Stupider, even. 
---
Gimme
---
Here's one for CAMP plans: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/afcgjc/i_made_a_visual_catalog_of_camp_assets_by_plan/
---
Thanks for the confirmation.
---
Or Bethesda did fight it few times, but being the developer they just equipped the best of the best armor and weapons and thought "ok it when down with just 50 mini nukes, better increase its health and resistance".
---
Shit, those evil hermit crabs are in F76? Didnt know that!
---
That is my experience as well
---
Nice look!
---
I'm on PS4 
---
Yea, getting a brain as a reward abs maybe some flesh and random armor peice isn't worth the loss of bullets.
---
Yeah, don’t get me wrong, I love the game and like the “after *everyone* died” theme. But at least do more with factions than a quest line and some holotapes.
---
Maybe Enclave style themed events for every faction? Or the option to permanently align with a faction after you hit a certain level to access unique loot, like how staying with the Railroad in 4 netted you the ability to armor clothes
---
Si
---
Jump on a pole. I usually go afk in chameleon. I usually go on a roof top, fence or any high prop I could find. I have marsupial, so no hight is too far away.
---
It's funny I use that on Xbox and it's the only program that has ever understood what I am asking. Makes sending text chats super easy. 
---
I'm really enjoying it, on pc. I can see why some don't like it: some fallout fans feel it's missing the dramatic story, npcs and mods. Personally, I never got too into the story in fallout games so the less than urgent tone works well with my style of slowly exploring and quickly getting sidetracked and this game works really well for that. It's also got enough of the twilight zone feel to feel like a fallout game to me. It did need a lot of work at launch and still needs some tweaking but I have to say I'm looking forward to what's down the country roads.
---
This sub doesn’t allow images. When you make a post there will be an option saying text video photo or image. I assume that you chose text
---
Any one doing whitesprings on Xbox now?
---
They should alter Serendipity to be like this.
---
Just note that any actual movement without player input could throw you off ledges, dodge you into a wall (not much of a dodge) and even cause you to miss your attacks while aiming or swinging.
---
So maybe give you a function similar to prompting a critical hit, only without vats on.  Maybe...  Pressing L3 when you want to dodge your next hit then moving the analog stick the direction you want to go?
---
I haven't played for near 4 weeks, I got bored from my friends not playing they all have different reasons one has too much rl commitments now 3x are bored of the game due to lack of content and 1x is sick of the bugs 
---
hoping the content situation being fixed soon may bring them back (I don't like playing solo and people are dicks)
---
You don’t fuckin say?
---
What if there was a under-helmet armor, just like the under-armor for the body, you craft it with flux and get different stats, and it’s worn under your “show” hat so you can still be pretty. 
---
This game made coop play hard in many ridiculously creative ways for a cooperative online game.
---
I think you can take the same photo 10x in the bog regardless of location to complete that challenge?
---
speak for yourself this is how I met my wife
---
They absofuckinglutely *can* one shot you, the fuck is with people on this sub trying to tell people their **Experiences** didn't happen...?  Holy shit.
---
I'm looking for Free plans/mods
---
shotgun + enforcer perk (I think it shows up at lvl 30) and you can knee cap enemies pretty reliably. then just head shot them while they are down.
---
I hope this is exactly what they have planned! I would love to visit the Capital Wasteland in the time period that Fallout 76 takes place in! 
---
Honestly, I know it isn't what you probably want to hear, but I had no idea I could do this and it seems like an interesting and cool idea that I now want to try.
---
I'm sorry that this setup upsets you, but I think it's pretty cool, I like building a lot in this game and this is something that I haven't tried yet. I also wouldn't have thought to use the siren in such a way. 
---
Which vendors did you find yours from?
---
How is now contesting workshops griefing? It seems this sub loves to call anything with even a sliver of pvp griefing.
---
Or a very angry husband about to give some doe the beating of its life.
---
Not viable as people would just abuse that ability to grief.
---
No online game does or should have a pause option.
---
Who wants to be able to pause in destiny or division or cod or fallout makes no sense even thinking about it 😊😎 love everyone though happy Tuesday to everyone 
---
Yeah just ignore the rest of the sentence. Create a strawman argument. That's really smart.
---
I hope they implement this for the next patch update. I've scrapped my enclave under armor 3 times! Scrapping too fast or because of lag idek.
---
Highly confirmed.....
---
A diluted one removes 150 rads instead of 300. But if you take a full one and you only needed say... 100 rads removed it's a pretty big waste. Especially when you have a hard time coming across them. That's all I'm saying. You'll be swimming in them before long if you keep playing.
---
If they don't mind losing caps.
---
Its rng. I try to just do the raider train stations and Morgantown 
---
The plan has been freely available on the terminal all along and the mole miners have plenty of Black Titanium.
---
Should be one and the same...

Im really not sure what youre refering to. Im refering to the fact that there are multiple "kill this creature" and "discover this location" (just some examples) that I KNOW Ive completed that are still marked incomplete. Hell, i can fast travel to all the locations the game requires me to "discover" as part of a challenge, so how have I not met the requirements of discovering them? Broken.
---
T'was painful to scroll through but...
---
An interesting read.  Keep at it :)
---
My buddy told me he solo'd her today with his melee build.  He said he is posting a video tomorrow on Youtube.  I believe his channel is CosmicScoundrel.  
---
Find on YT - there is short clip that shows exact location.
---
I love that photo. A+
---
It’s def broken. I killed a death law, and it gave me the Grafton monster after a relog 
---
I used the power armor glitch to get myself into the executive suite of the enclave bunker and inside it there was a terminal for something similiar, presidential something-or-others you could redeem for items and paint jobs, I'm willing to bet they add that in one of these updates
---
Lol i see what you did there! Yo but did they unban that guy? He seemed to have a legit deal, but i didn’t investigate that well! 
---
&gt;scorched with miniguns
---
They're easy to spot as they are often holding it pointing at the sky and shooting you with it.
---
Yeah sorry about that haha, next time I'm gonna write it on reddit rather than word, hopefully that will fix the problem. Thanks for your time!
---
you reap what you sow
---
much appreciated!
---
I for one enjoyed the list thank you
---
Believe it or not, Crowned enemies, and workshop defend events netted me most of my stimpacks.
---
mclintock is a popular farm spot
---
regularly gets cleaned out by farmers 
---
No insult intended! Nukacrypt has always been my go-to. NC always had codes up within 30 minutes of the rollover. That's why when I went hunting and found someone else with it first I was surprised. Should've been more clear.
---
Ok, so I got the foundation to go on the plant, but unless the plant is on the ground I can't it to work, and once I have a blueprint it wont work either.  Which kind of devoids the purpose of this.   
---
Can you help a little more on how to make this work?
---
Lol none
---
I’ve seen these trading posts. They usually have there friends in sniper outfits ready close by hiding in case stuff like this happens.
---
Very true, if you follow the western edge of the map, the river, south of the mothman building on the map, you'll come across enough blood leaves and soot flowers, with chemist perk, to last you well beyond the forest area.

Move your base then move it back.  Everything gets fixed.

Hopefully at wastelanders release

What do u mean by accent walls ftw?

Sunday Brothers' Cabin has, like, 90% of teh code for brewing there, right down to a distllery, outputs, and ingrediants ... but teh quest doesn't trigger when you're there.

I know I'd be asking for death if i was covered in a radioactive cancer fungus.
---
Props on NukaCrypt by the way, it's an awesome looking site and my first place to look for codes when they've been decrypted
---
noot.
---
Auto Stim Perk, Blocker, Serendipity, Stealth. But yeah you gotta be really really careful XD
---
I know, just trying to let people know in general :) 
---
The clean ranger hat is a guaranteed spawn at the radio tower near death claw island, if I remember correctly.
---
2 things: 
---
I'd bet that SBs are the worst effort/reward ratio in ANY GAME I've ever played
---
And there's no damn way I'd try to kill 50 of em to get calibrated shocks
---
Idea is solid, just needs some balancing and "make this actually worth doing" effort
---
I got 3 level 80s attacking me there the last time I played.
---
It's been about 2.5 weeks since I've fired the game up again. That is a HUGELY significant reason for that.
---
Do you have any Marsupial serums left? 
---
I can confirm it.  I haven't done that build yet, but I sure as crap know when one of them shows up.  You'll literally see the queen's health CHUNK down.  I have to yell at my friends to "get here fast, the queen is going to be dead in under 2 minutes" lol
---
The grind, wasted potential, no story, no endgame. 
---
The first few hours will be fun and exploration can be nice as well but as soon as you level it'll just be grindy and unrewarding as hell.
---
Reminds me of 2 stories, first was when I was like lvl 40 and this 140ish lvl guy kept smacking me when I was in a trade menu with a vendor. I finished my stuff then grabbed a fat man and dropped the bomb on him, didn't seem to faze him at all then he just one shots me. After that we teamed up for a few hrs. Good times. Second story was when I was lvl 60 this little lvl 8 decided to initiate pvp against me after a SB fight near hopewell cave, well because of recently picked up loot I was overcumbered and didn't realize it til i tried to run after him. So i was chasing this guy with my grognak axe running out of ap and he would stop to let me catch up then he'd start running again. Eventually he just fast travel away, Biggest fail and funniest pvp I've encountered.
---
I usually take multiple different chems at once and only today did I realize that they don't stack. I can understand not allowing players to stack the same chem but we should be able to use different types at the same time.
---
Yes I do , PSN? 
---
The lumberjack camp of north-north-west would like to disagree.
---
I thought it equally odd there were none in New Vegas. 
---
It’s one reason I’m rocking a level 40 lifesavers robot left leg.   Weapon weight reduction included.
---
I always thought in Fallout 4  it would be a better idea to have gun emplacements that you needed to craft and assign a settler to, rather than automatic turrets. 
---
Wouldn't work as well in 76 though. 
---
I only found out because a tip so said lmao 
---
I dusted off my sniper for the first time in a couple weeks to try out a new instigating/vats acc lever gun I found on my melee/PA alt.
---
I didn't quite have this issue, but I did have a lot of enemies with rebounding health.  I would shoot them in caution, watch the health bar deplete, then it would just rebound back.  I was using an instigating lever gun and a 2-shot/explosive handmade, both with the same issue.  Their health would drop nearly to 0 with the lever gun, then rubberband back up to 50-75%, as if my legendary effects were being entirely negated.  I switched to my reflex sighted handmade, which would drop them by like 20% a shot, then the health jumped back up to maybe 5% less than what they had before.  Again, as if it had no legendary effects.  I had to reload a 35 round stinging mag three times to take out 5 super mutants between lvl 42-68.  That's 105 rounds to take out 5 enemies, which seems outrageous for a really top end gun.
---
This happened when fighting gulpers, super mutants, a scorchbeast and mirelurk kings.  A wide variety of enemies between lvl 40-80.
---
My melee alt has 0% trouble with rebounding health or damage not applying correctly.  After putting my main sniper on the shelf for the better part of the month, I remembered why I rolled up the alt.  There's something fundamentally broken with legendary ranged weapons, be it rebounding health that ignores all of the legendary effect damage or a completely broken state in which the gun(character?) becomes entirely useless with ranged weapons requiring a full quit to desktop and restart.  I can always jump into a suit of power armor with my bowie knife that I use for sticking mole rats to stay in the nuke zone, but obviously I'd rather be enjoying a couple rifles that took me an AWFUL long time to acquire.
---
The source of my weird obsession with desk fans.

Before F76 there was only you, the world and its characters.  Now we have each other to see, hear and interact with.  For the most part this has been fun.  From friendly waves to helping out.  I have been saved a couple of times by strangers and have tried to pass along the favor.  But Bethesda has also created a fantasy playground for bullies and individuals with sociopathic tendencies.  Mutual combat is fine, lots of games have you choose up sides and wail away at each other.  But the "griefers" who beat on lower level noncombatants until they lose all their stimbats and die are just classic playground bullies who should seek help.
---
Fuck roadmaps tbh
---
IDGAF what the game's roadmap says, we're lost NOW and that map is for the next state over anyway!
---
 Would you believe that I've seen that irl before. Looks really strange....
---
scorchbeasts were hyped as endgame enemies along with nukes. yet drop the shittiest shit that ever shitted shit.
---
these commendations seem like a good idea to gain some of the rarer paint jobs (if they add the ones you mentioned and the ones in game files like the BOS elder paint)
---
even then i want fort defiance to be transformed into a bos safehouse/trade area (where you could turn in these commendations aswell.).
---
it would make sense that since (APPARENTLY *sigh*) only bos members get access to the upper floor (yet apparently ghouls and other enemies are allowed past the laser grid)

Possible solution is to go to your camp and sleep. I know that this is not going top work for all; it's just going to depend on where your camp is. Believe me, I wish there was a pause button because even though I don't have kids, I hate having to pee in the middle of a mission.
---
That place is the real secret, wood piles for days 
---
I want a Bowie knife made from a meteor. One of the legends behind the original Bowie knife is that Jim Bowie found a meteor in the swamps of Louisiana and made a wood mockup of what he wanted to a blacksmith in Arkansas and that is how the original Bowie knife was made. Nobody knows since Jim's knife was lost or stolen after the Battle of the Alamo. There are many rumors in and around Texas about it and the 9 replicas that were made at the same time as the original. All I know is I used to have one (replica of course) and it sure as hell made quartering up deer and elk very easy. It was too big to easily use for skinning, but it was good for everything else. In desperate times, I used as a can puncturer to get to canned soup when I couldn't find my can opener. (Before the times of peel top lids). 
---
Maybe Jim is looking down on us and thinking WTF are these idiots doing talking about my knife on those bright things. 
---
Yeah and in a game set in a post apocalyptic world, especially where role playing is a part of it, people being "bullies" fits in much better than people being nice to each other. Watch any post apocalyptic movie and see, there are few good guys, and many raiders, and people setting traps, and killing each other for scraps of food.
---
I have 2 20% weapon reduction pieces that I can't live without even though they are crappy pieces. 
---
I vaguely remember a holotape of a guy talking about how they lost the bid and how it was going to tank the company. Luckily the bombs dropped and it didn't matter. 😜
---
UPDATE: I’m happy to report I just stumbled upon the Small Letters Plan tonight by sheer luck. I went to claim the Charleston Landfill Workshop hoping to try that a few times to see if I could earn it as a reward. As I was approaching, I heard a super mutant...sounded different from most. Much to my surprise, it was Grahm the traveling merchant! Only my 3rd encounter with roughly 200 hrs of play. I remember reading lots of folks saying he often sold it. I went through his inventory, and not only did he not have it, he didn’t have a single thing I was interested in. So I said goodbye and went to claim the shop. As I was waiting to take claim, I wandered around to the left (roughly 7:00 o’clock in relation to the claim spot) and searched a random small red toolbox on the ground and I was in utter shock when I saw “Plan: Small Letters.” Literally thousands of different things could have spawned there, and it was the exact thing I was looking for. Just thought I’d share in case someone else would like to give it a look. Good luck all!
---
I have a zealots leather shoulder with +1 STR and 20% reduction and another piece that is just the weight reduction. 
---
The only impressive part of the scorched I’ve seen was a random horde that ran into.
---
All wearing responder gear,  one with a note saying that she wouldn’t get locked up and dissected,  she was going to beat this plague.
---
In that moment I was reminded that the bulk of the scorched are people who wanted to help others.
---
Do people ACTUALLY still play this game? Dude I got 700 hrs on FA4 and have this game up after 10 haha 
---
Rifleman doesn't have an equivalent to ground pounder. Well, I don't think it does. 
---
Is it actually talking about the Grafton Monster or the Super Mutant Behemoth? Because I know West Tek was responsible for leaking some stuff in the water and that’s why there are super mutants in WV (it says it on a loading screen) Other than that, I’ve never really seen anything 
---
Uh oh, your pirate signal into the Matrix has been found. Get to a get to a wet wall now. 
---
Nerf them all? Okay!
---
Yeah that's pretty normal. I monitor this subreddit for updates, because I played it a bunch when it came out and I love the series, but there's no endgame progression and too many bugs. If it ever gets to a playable state, I'll come back. 
---
Nope, it is fun for them to watch it on their matrix terminals. 
---
I think I read in there somewhere that the Grafton Monster was a result of their tampering as well as Super Mutants, but I could be wrong. 
---
All of my friends left after beta. Everyone I met in game (a friend's list of like 40) are all offline always.
---
I miss em. 
---
Upvote earned. :)
---
I apologize for the length, but I hope some do read the entirety and give me feedback. I can’t be the only one who feels taken advantage of.
---
Sometimes mics just don't work. I'm also having a problem currently. I can even see the mic "activate" on my screen, but no one can hear me. 
---
Not if they add cosmetic slots for helmets like they did with the clothing. you have cosmetic over armor why not have that with hats.  
---
Sure some like gas masks and the responders head gear wouldn't be able to have cosmetic bits over them but as the gas mask is face slot it doesn't mater. and only RP's wear the responders helmet anyway. 
---
Dedicated PVPers are using Sentinel/Cavalier (15% reduced damage while not moving/sprinting, respectively, for 75% with 5 pieces) Major effects combined with Assassins (8% reduced damage from players, for 40% with 5 pieces) a minor effects. Stacking those along with some defensive perks (dodgy, serendipity, blocker for melee) means massive damage reduction (they are multiplicative, so they don’t go 100% immune, but it’s a huge reduction).
---
If you aren’t running similar damage reduction effects and just relying on power armor DR, well, Incisor for melee combined with their massive inherent damage means they effectively ignore your armor (450 DR on X-01 becomes 112 armor after Incisor, and when you’re swinging a super sledge for about a thousand damage, 100 armor might as well be tissue paper).
---
Hell even without ignoring your armor, 1000 damage against 450 armor still does like 700 effective damage. It’s a oneshot even without Incisor. 
---
Yup I just looked it up. You’re right. I never even would’ve put the Grafton Monster with all of that but now I know 
---
I’m starting to think maybe. I haven’t had a mod unlock for hunting rifle or pump shotgun for about 50 scraps each, but I know there’s mods I haven’t unlocked on both. This character is only level 18.  Maybe there’s a certain allotment every few levels?
---
I really don’t like RNG stuff like this. It’s what burned me out on ESO eventually. 
---
I don't know, but it might be worthwhile checking near Grafton. It's odd that Grafton Monsters rarely actually spawn there, but there's a chance that the convoy was around there when it broke containment.
---
Then again, since each cryptid is a species of creature, it's possible that the primary subject was transferred successfully, and we may have to fight a King Beast of Grafton or something in a DLC, where we find that off-site containment.
---
Another possibility is that the Grafton Monster in the Grafton Day event is the one mentioned in the terminal. A pre-War AI knows about it and calls it their beloved mascot, so it's entirely possible that West Tek hid it in plain sight as the town mascot, so they could easily observe it while robots prevented it from wiping out the citizens.
---
problem there is only two hats in the game that could fit that role.  marine tactical helmet, and the sack and hood raider helmet. 
---
That sucks man. Nice that you didn't decide to let it be. It may not be intended but if you move your camp and replace your recent blueprint it will be fixed. If you are feel like having fun using "last laugh" with orbital strikes is a nice way to blow it up aswell. Saw some others kite ghouls onto a base with gamma guns. Have fun with it I guess ;p
---
And then you give them Mercy. I was watching Znation on one tv and playing fo76 on another. I started counting my kills like 10k and saying I give you mercy. Once they were dead, I went back with a .38 pipe weapon and shot all of the scorched and ghouls in the head saying I give you mercy. My wife I didn't realize was standing at the door and when I noticed her she asked me if I was sick. I said nope, just bored AF and it brought a little fun to the game again. 
---
Good question, I’ve never bothered to check since they don’t scale with any damage stats, with their short range they go out of style pretty fast.
---
He had like 1,000,000 rounds of ammo on him in total i believe, doesnt seem very legit
---
Because they are in group as a team. You attack one. You attack all of them. 
---
girly?
---
This is a great resource..

https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_armor_and_clothing
---
I’d be happy to come dance around with you and your rolling pin. I have an anti armor Mr Handy just for the occasion. Except I’m on PC so won’t happen sorry. 
---
Aw
---
Curious, why do you need to craft stimpaks? I'm level 75 and I've been finding more of them than I'll ever need throughout the game. I've sold 200+ along the way and still have over 50 in my stash. 
---
Problem is I get to a point where I’m not unlocking mods, but I know there’s some missing. On hunting rifles I’ve scrapped 50 now with nothing, but I don’t have the suppressor yet. 
---
I'm pretty confident Graham sells them. Unsure about the other vendors tho.
---
It’s been 79 days and the stash size has gone from 400 to 800, but I am still carrying everything for this reason. I am still hoping they alter and balance the weight reduction perks to potentially apply to stash weight as well instead of restricting it just to personal weight. 
---
&gt;So here I am, doing something about it.
---
We've had these complains for months now. Seeing how the world gets better? Seeing those turret camps to disapear? Im not.
---
&gt;So I waited until he left his base, and I turned his dumb turrets. 
---
Is this trolling? Clearly he built the switch there for that purpose.
---
Whine whine whine bitch bitch. Get a better strategy. I’d blow you up too if you messed with my camp. You deserve it you whiny prick.
---
Does it make all weapons weigh less or just the equipped weapon? 
---
Marine wetsuit lid
---
&gt; Doesn't matter where you enter, it can happen.
---
I only get this from Whitesprings, and mainly from one entrance.
---
Yeah, did the same. Had about 5 of em lined up, different versions, colours.
---
Now, all it does is take up stash room.
---
NEVER fast drop, scrap, queue or sell items. You can clearly notice when trading via menu that it has issues. Sometimes it will select the item around the item that you are adjusting the price for. There are more examples like these. Most of the players have legendary only on them now but accidental scrapping of weapons was also a thing because of it.
---
Oddly enough I made it to the final mission at level 32 but I specced melee and shotgun
---
Everyone wanted fallout multiplayer. They just also wanted dialogue and real questing with actual depth to the exploration.
---
I was pretty disappointed with wendigo cave my first time. After that I just used it over and over for quick wendigo loot. Didn't feel very fallouty. 
---
It's broken, if it's the second legendary effect on the armor it never applies.  Rad Resistance is useless anyways, Rad Suits and Power Armor have a hidden Rad Reduction stat that provides a flat reduction to incoming rads.  1000 armor + drug rad resistance from before they patched Rad X wasn't as effective a Rad Suit with 1000 Rad Resist.
---
Good, their games a pile of Shiite, I sold it. 
---
I've run into a lot of legendary enemies that quickly heal themselves and then ran into a scorched mirelurk queen that refused to take damage.. Even three clean shots from a nuke launcher didn't register jack squat
---
Being able to keep coming back should be a option to some extent. Especially with workshops it is just a case of who is more persistent. You burn more materials and caps standing your ground and winning most of the time. Caps especially if you are in a team and die about once. Until my damage was insane people would just tend to throw themselves into a fight time and time again.
---
That is why you have to put your camp in a very strategic location. It also has to be tactically sound also. Almost hidden, or barely noticeable. Maybe just the camp box out and all items in storage for protection while you are away. 
---
Yesterday I got vanguard weapon weight reduction AP increase 3 star.
---
Even the base item is fair, level 50 metal hand. That's the closest thing to god roll I've ever had, and great thing is I prefer vanguard armor so I don't try to desperately trade it into even more rare and much more sought after piece like I see a lot people trying.
---
I think it got dropped by Ghoul next to WS main building, judging by my screenshot. All those crappy 3 stars and 1 stars from 3 star enemy, totally worth it. Well, for a while.
---
Honestly, if you are this unhappy, you should just break up, block them on social media, and change your number. Maybe focus on yourself for a while. Take up Rockwall climbing or ornament making. 
---
I always get a new hairstyle but that's me. 
---
...And like all doomed relationships, I think you expected too much from her.
---
Chemist and super duper.
---
Butchers bounty too. 
---
There's a river by Harper's ferry. To the south it ends. At the beginning (where the river is super tiny) there's a hut with 4 ticks that spawn.
---
Kill the ticks. Search then with butchers bounty.
---
Use them to make blood bags. You get x2 and a 50% change at making an extra 
---
Then you make x2 stimpacks with the same chance at making an extra.
---
Then you make x4 diluted with a Chance at getting an extra 2.
---
I'd place a camp there and come back every 30min. 100 stimpacks in no time. Even more diluted. 
---
Move the mic closer to mouth, speak louder?
---
Not really waste, if we're looking to buy the game once it's more stable.
---
I think the game engine does not allow small fixes.  They fix something and then you DL the whole game to update it. 
---
Any 2 star is inherently more rare than bloodied/AA 1 stars.
---
This community can be toxic but primarily against negativity towards the game. As far as player to player experiences go it’s amazing and that’s primarily because this game’s main player base cane from a single player perspective. The main games were never made for PvP or competitive nature. That’s why I’m really pissed their focusing on a PvP update. I’m ok with the thought of separate servers but only if it takes the competitive people away which it probably won’t. If they can’t win there then they’ll go back to normal servers. We don’t need more reasons to kill each other. We need each other to help make the game more positive and fun
---
Hell yeah
---
I've been noticing that the game is on a pretty steady slope of improvement, seen lots of engagement from Bethesda employees actually listening to players. It feels like now more than ever, Bethesda is showing their support and respect for the players of their game.
---
I paid extra to pre-order the Tricentennial edition, and I feel like I've gotten my money's worth and then some.
---
Your feelings aren't invalid or wrong or whatever. Me disagreeing here isn't to make you feel like I'm right and you're wrong. But I feel like they're doing a crack-up job. It's irritating how long it takes them to fix basic bugs, but still, I digress.
---
It's sad you feel how you do, but do what you think is right for you, and if leaving the game and Bethesda brings you happiness, then I hope you do so. Have a nice day
---
I feel like masking an album, dunno if I should tho.
---
But isn't Fallout 76 a biggest risk they have taken for a while?
---
And people who made ES games and Fallout 3 and 4 did not make 76.
---
I see them at one of the watoga vendors usually. 
---
The Bowie Knife can spawn with the Serrated prefix as well but Datamining shows there are no learnable mods for it. Dont think mods in the world either that will apply to them.
---
If I saw you I would stash my junk and go ham brother. Most people don't seem interested in pvp, but I'm excited for survival mode when things get a bit more dicey
---
Thanks.  That kind of trouble shooting info is helpful.  Now i wont do the same thing.
---
There was a train in Madison Indiana that was designed to go up a steep hill. Southern Indiana has a plateau cut by glaciers.   It now sits in a museum in Indianapolis, I believe there is another one similar somewhere in the Smokey mountains. 
---
No such option .  Bummer.
---
Yup
---
I swear I used to be better at it, too. Maybe it's all the aspartame in the nukacola.
---
Well. If you want to play efficiently you are. You're basically forced by the Meta
---
*YOOOOOOOOOO!!!!* It's your **3rd Cakeday** EnigmaT1m! ^(hug)
---
I do the same and got to the desk by the shops the other day.
---
Salavaged Assaultron heads when used in stealth do 0 damage while charged. If the total health pool of the enemy is exceeded the weapon your using does 0 damage. Not to mention the ammo bug that also exists. 
---
This was occurring with most weapons that could "one shot" something from stealth. Most notably happening to the Guass Rifle but that was fixed.
---
This is the same issue i believe.  Not all weapons are effected. 
---
The best way I can summarize Fallout 76 as opposed to Fallout 4, seen as people try to defend 76 with the argument. 
---
Fallout 76 has no life to it, it's mundane and basically a shell. 
---
Fallout 4 on the other hand is filled with life and personality. 
---
For gods sake, 76 was found with the same code as 4 and parts of Skyrim... Copy and pasted. 
---
Just cause you appreciate their older titles, do not defend this lazy excuse of a game. Especially when they charged people full retail price for it. 
---
I get many of you wanna justify your purchase and not accept you were conned, but you were, I know I was and I played 76 up until recently trying to convince myself it'd get better. 
---
It didn't and I've got much better games to spend my time on then some hollow lifeless and filled to the brim with bugs game. 
---
Hello. I know I am very late here but I am hoping you can help me gather some feedback. 
---
Can you recall what the negative effects related to the X-Cell withdrawal you have/had?  
---
It for sure looks like a mole miner, so I'm thinking he will be either in a set location or in at least an readily findable one
---
I wouldn't know what cross faded means. I am not some boozed up meth head going from one lsd/molly party to the other.

In any case, the only things you should be bulking is Aluminum and lead.  See here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WjWGNTadalTRvtG1MzzFqGVQ3YOWv5QgnurmNyudPZM/edit#gid=0
---
Well from a pvp perspective handmades are the most top tier weapon you get use. So i guess there is that. 
---
Sorry my teen kinda blew up tonight and decided she didn’t want to come home.... so I had to go get her and practice dragged her home kicking and sulking. 
---
Spawned into a game where a pack of scorched killed me , As I was loading back in I hear a Guy on the Mic getting attacked by the same pack. I Load in completely and Kill the pack and I hear him Mumble  "Ahh man this guy is gonna take my $hit".. Guess what I did ..? I left his bag alone .. why ? cause why tf do I want to ruin another players experience?... I bet It made his day to come back to the Mobs killed and his bag Untouched... Come on guys the MATS are everywhere go find them and do your fellow players a solid. 
---
Now someone thats asking for it is a whole other story... ;)
---
Not really, you can find plenty of resources while walking across the map, besides no one is forcing you to fast travel. Don’t push for the feature to be removed just because you don’t trust yourself not to use it. 
---
But that 5% better hit chance in VATS is a game changer
---
Well if youre like me.... i can sneak past almost anything whwn im crouch walking lol

PSN?

No problem man, I lucked out and actually found it in a random container.  Thanks anyway for the offer.
---
I just think about the amount of cavitation that has to exist inside the scorch beasts I kill. It is suprising they can take the amount of hits, especially with an AA weapon. I hunt, and the amount of damage 1 .308 bullet or even worse 1 saboted shotgun slug can do to an animal at 75 to 150 yards. With a shotgun I always aim for the head, otherwise I could end up losing almost half my kill to cavitation. The rifle damage it as bad, but I do try to head shot or go for the heart/lung shot to avoid losing meat. 
---
ESO Fallout edition at this point. I was under the impression that Fallout 76 took people from almost all of Bethesdas different studios and subsidiaries. But Todd Howard certainly was listed as the producer for all of those games.
---
Can you wear a normal hat over that? 
---
Yeah, I’m gonna try to move on, as I said. Not sure how good I’ll do. Me and myself don’t get along very well, hence these escapes.
---
Joined in on a sbq battle last night. Wasted a bunch of ammo and durability. After she was downed, her loot box just sat there spinning. Suddenly the whole carcass just flat up vanished, and I couldn't find the blood pile anywhere. Ended up walking away from that battle with only whatever I could scavenge from the hoard carcasses left on the ground.
---
Have not found any reason why it does that but it has been like that for a while. I tried farming regional events only a few times. Sometimes you would go a week without seeing a quest and the other time you can repeat the same one multiple times in a day. Not sure if it helps but I try to log out close to a daily location so the next time I log in it hopefully picks it up because range.
---
Just look at how often the forest gets normal events even when no one is close in comparison th the mire and toxice valley especially. It's a bit wonky I guess.
---
open all the PO boxes, one will need the key you have got.
---
Then go to the computer and read all entries, you can't search by box number IIRC, but there is basic info on about 8 boxes that you can go through. one of them is the one you need to read.
---
Yes, I do this too! Wasn't sure if it helped but thought why not do it anyway.
---
Yeah I’m going to try to move on, as I said. Not sure how much good it will do me. Me and myself don’t get along very well, hence all of these escapes.
---
But I invested so much. And I was blown away by games in 2006, I don’t think I expected TOO too much.
---
It's only available as the 3rd trait on legendary armor and it pretty damn rare. The effects are:
---
-20% weight for food, drink, and chems 
---
-20% weight for weapons 
---
-20% weight for ammo 
---
-20% weight for junk
---
Enemies frozen in various poses moving, and non reacting AI are the bugs i see regularly every hour.
---
Saw a Scorch Beast drifting across the sky frozen in a pose. 
---
I hope so, for everyone who’s still enjoying it. And thank you for your kind words. I’m curious, have you played the early Elder Scrolls games?
---
I have never RP’d, but wow... serious respect to the time taken to put this together. I truly hope these options can be literally that, selectable restrictions for admins on dedicated and private servers in the future. 
---
I do the bulking to sell, not for storage. The storage is just to make it easier to see my inventory, not for weight. 
---
"murica fuck yeah"
---
That’s so sick bro
---
Go to the computer in the postal office and when you enter it go to search by p.o box or something like that
---
It's that rocket thing underneath the main body that keeps them floating.
---
Hey there. Great tip. I just crafted a serrated max level combat knife and am dying to try it out. It has damage of about 65 I think. Good tip! Finally a reason to get Ninja cards.
---
Lol yesterday someone nuked the area south of Watoga. I went there to check it out and collect flux. 
---
At one point I died near the edge of nuked area, and had to respawn outside to BOS camp. I had died several times prior on that server, including indoors, so then the game no longer shows your loot location as marker. You see the task but it doesn't have location.
---
From BOS camp I had to fight scorched and one SB, all while Im running low on intact weapons. 
---
With one scorched I killed while retreating backwards, in all that tense situation dying over and over, I dropped down to pond and he was up on the edge, I accidentally placed my explosive shotgun to it's body when I was shooting when he died and opened the inventory thing, and then I roughtly saw the body to fall down. After I several deaths I finally clear that camp, then spent next 10 mins trying to find that body. I was so desparate, explosive shotguns aren't super common. There were plants in the pond and I was afraid the body was under them, making it not targettable. Thought about throwing lots of explosives on the area trying to fish it out. Eventually I found the body, with my shotgun there, and it was so beatiful. I was semi-afraid that the scorched might have also looted it and it could be on other scorched body.
---
Then I was kinda not expecting to find my loot, of course I cleared my junk inventory when I went to the nuke area, but still I had looted some stuff from it. 10-15 minutes later I was nearly giving up when I found my bag. There wasn't a lot valuable stuff there, maybe 20-30 screws/springs and little of hardened mass. That was so great.
---
Would you believe, no crash or disconnect to lose any of that, particularly the shotgun was really important. 
---
I don't think in my case there was any glitch, I was shooting when the scorched died, it instantly opened the inventory and just by chance my mouse was right over my weapon.
---
What do you mean? It doesn't go past 95% and it already does 95%.
---
Damn that is marketing level.
---
The only way to get good 3* weapons is to kill legendaries with a glowing aura to them
---
Never had the pleasure to. I'm not really into role playing games, Fallout being the exception. Though I do want to try out the Elder Scrolls series. I'm not a fantasy fan, generally, but I play too much sci-fi. Some monsters and magic might be a good break.
---
are you set to area chat? and are you set to push to talk or always on? (push to talk is backspace by default)
---
Well I always do that’s why I had to wait for it to land
---
Yeah, but if you want to sneak attack in vats using a melee weapon with stalker on it, it costs more ap for literally no benefit.
---
"I sell FEV and FEV accessories."
---
It is the user's fault. If they didn't actually drop the item, it is still their fault for playing such a buggy game. 😁
---
I’ve have notice this too since the last patch. I would have 25 bobby-pins in my stash and 25 I carried around. Use to never need more, then bam patch and a skill 1 lock broke 4 bobby-pins never had that happen before.  Now it happens ever couple locks braking at least one depend on lock skill level 
---
There was a glitch for a bit where you could “display” them for the duration of your session. I was sad when they patched that.
---
Always shoot things that run fast in the legs.
---
Try eating some chips, that should guarantee everyone on the map can hear you.
---
Don't sweat it, 3k is one semi decent drop away. 
---
I'm a leg man.  Get the legs first, way easier to get the head when it's crawling on the ground.
---
This looks like a 80s heavy metal album cover. Damn awesome. 
---
Player to player selling?
---
&gt; not two close
---
Not too close
---
He offers a shielded underarmor service that's pretty legit.
---
It's already acknowledged and an upcoming feature.
---
Probably so they can track multiple accounts being used on a single machine, and so they all can be banned in one click.
---
I’m sorry what? This guy is known in the community?
---
no you just repress the memory of how bad you are
---
Same as here
---
Players work hard to get where they are, so either join the game build yourself up and play against them and stop being lazy demanding to nerf everything and if it’s the jealousy then leave the game altogether. One question how do you know it’s a bloodied build when it shows nothing of their build after they attack you.
---
Oh, wow! That's certainly an insight on the knife's origins. I had no idea, it sounds like it would be great inspiration to write a quest for this game, and retrieve "Jim's Knife" from the Zetans too!
---
My pun intended to correlate it with one of David Bowie's (imho) greatest songs.
---
Is the GT right? Can’t find you
---
Yeah. Could be cosmetics or gear.
---
You'll just be part of the problem which is sad. Someone is going to be really disappointed when they find out you're ruining their experience by doing that 
---
Yeah, i thought of the possibility of you aiming towards David Bowie. I grew up in Texas, and had to take Texas history in 7th grade. Plus the area I grew up in was where Stephen F Austin brought the original 300 to Texas and where the first capital of the Republic was. I just love history so i researched it a lot years ago. 
---
Yes, it is.
---
The one for killing mole miners with a miner hat and pickaxe is also bugged, at least for me.
---
&gt;Which means player versus player. It’s part of the game for a reason.
---
Wrong. We get punished for it if we start it. If you even destroy anything you get a wanted level. Even if they're doing something shitty like this. Even if they go destroy your base. I could go wreck your entire base with 25k caps and it wouldn't hurt me one bit. As a lvl 35 if I destroy his turrets, could put a big strain on my money. I'll get a hefty bounty AND lose my caps if killed by him for initiating PvP. 
---
Mmm so in other words, Fu*k everyone who wants to work together the fair and honest way to kill ghouls themselves, this guy should be allowed to put his base here and auto farm them with a turret exploit???
---
All depends on the build. I have never spend more than 15-18 rounds .45 on my stealth vats build to kill one SB. Personally i find them way to easy to kill.
---
I think stealth and vats are strongly disappreciated in this game.
---
No, I just have literally no interest in PvP ever. If you want me to get rid of your bounty, get on the mic and ask.
---
Found mine in Harper's Ferry
---
He offers all types of serums too, should ask them for free.
---
seems like he was recaptured, sedated, and transported successfully per the last paragraph.
---
it would have ended, "subject is currently being tracked down" or something along those lines had the case been otherwise.. I think the cryptid may be stowed away somewhere waiting to emerge.
---
Maybe they should give you the option to scrap trees and other stuff within the building area
---
No. If you tag them you get loot. So he was tagging dozens and letting the turrets do the rest. They take no ammo whatsoever so basically he's not doing much of anything. 
---
Also, you are correct if he's not there. When he left his base with his turrets on and it kept killing ghouls, other people in the area trying to kill them weren't able to because the turrets stole them first. That's why it ruins it for other people. You arrive there and all ghouls are dead. Who killed them? A turret did. No one gets to kill them or get any loot. 
---
Would make sense if the distilleries/stills at Sunday Brothers Cabin were enabled. They can be interacted with but currently do nothing. My guess is they will implement the 'Home Brew**'** event there - create Muttberry Shine, Sunday Shine and Tater Shine whilst fending off waves of creatures.
---
I used to do that, but now there’s an angry deathclaw at my camp I cant get rid of, so best avoid it until it dies or loses interest or something
---
Why not D. Come together as a player base and protest this garbage tactic so people can't build 5 feet from the back of the biggest enemy spawn in the game, basically exploiting????
---
Yeah i was hoping you could make explosive crossbow bolts
---
I'm gonna take a guess and say that people tried to evacuate, leaving passenger cars somewhere outside of the general map areas.
---
Limited by stash size I believe
---
I know, I just was too tired to think of better words for the quote. 
---
Oh ok because I can't find any power armor anywhere
---
Exactly how mine is. It's over the wall so I can instantly scale the wall and GTFO but too high for ghouls to get in. No turrets at all. I've had people run by and kill all of them swarming my foundation. It makes them laugh. No impact to their play. 
---
Yeah I’m well aware, I’ve gotten bounties before. But if you absolutely weren’t allowed to do it, then it would be in the game that you physically cannot harm another player or their camp. Yet it was written in the game. So you have to adapt and play against it. Someone destroys your base, get your guns out and destroy theirs. And if you have zero caps and he keeps destroying your base, you have nothing to lose by going after him.  I mean if you wanna sit around and only build there’s Sims 😅 
---
I have like 6 of my own and two I’m holding for my brother
---
Well each suit and frame weighs 10lb so you can fill your stash and carry weight with them if you wish, but then you can't store anything else
---
I def don’t NEED to craft stimpaks; I’m in your boat and sitting on a pile of them—especially with Pharma Farma. 
---
It’s just fun and easy to craft and I enjoy doing it. I usually fast travel to Vault 76 to cut down on fast travel fees so when I’m in the area I usually make a stop at that shack for those quick and easy blood packs for some quick and easy stimpaks, lol. 
---
I started bombing the turret farms. I lose some caps, but I don’t mind. 
---
I appreciate that, though I’m on PS4. Thanks though!
---
Ok so how about this.... Homes built too close ro whitespring grounds aren't subject to the same PvP rules. You can destroy them with no penalty? So if you're outside of it, no problem. But if you're 5 feet away, fair game?
---
How much for a suit of x-01?
---
It's a problem because it farms them when he's gone. Other people come there to kill them and the turret kills them first. So no one gets anything. 
---
Yep yep, that mill is a good spot too! I usually find a few lurking around Point Pleasant as well when I go for those Mothman Eggs, lol. 
---
Automatic. When you use shotgun, it doesnt arc anymore.
---
I lost my explosive pump shotgun lvl 50 Fighting the scorchbeast queen I change to my melee weapon and it disappeared. 
---
Yeah, I don't mind a camp with a couple turrets outside the walls. I have seen people attack those too. I just have mine where I can fast travel to WS for 5 caps. Plus I have a lead  resource thing so I pull in tons of lead just from that, well when I remember to go empty it that is. 
---
Right, but more and more are doing this every day.... So it's on many servers
---
Nobody is shocked by this.
---
Lol same here
---
Sadly no, I wish we could though.
---
Doing the Lord's work
---
Pls
---
I'll buy that lmg from you. Will you be on at 7am today?
---
Enemy Crab: MASSIVE DAMAGE
---
RIP speedruns--- wait, those werent possible anyway
---
Right but I don't see why it's ruining someone else's experience. When I was camped on by a PKer at Whitesprings who was triple my level and forced me to go elsewhere, it made me pretty angry and ruined my experience. But it was put in the game that way to be able to play like that, so I sucked it up and went elsewhere. 
---
Yeeeeeah, no thanks. I either join a TOWN and suffer from being unable to move my home closer to me or suffer from terrible equipment? That's really just... An awful idea, right there.
---
Nice criticism. You must have a better one to show us.
---
Booze, meth, acid and ecstasy? Dunno about you but sounds like a fair old time to me. 
---
If you go to thunder mountain power station in the mire, find the southern most cooling tower and pick the lock on the room at the top. You have a good chance of finding it on a control panel desk in the opposite corner of the room.
---
Mine arcs great.  Less range, more spread. I prefer the shotgun barrel for mobs.
---
I would say dont rush the game, do side quests on easier areas, explore and continue with the main questlines once you have a higher level.  Explore the forest, toxic valley and ash heap first
---
But it's mainly Austin(Battlecry studios) and they have no experience with Fallout or the engine.
---
Harpoon gun offers unlimited ammo with the fletchettes mod.  Shoot one, pickup two.
---
That wouldn't help not need foundations, though? 
---
I use an Xbox controller for pc games whenever I can, it just feels so much easier and smoother in my opinion. I don’t use the push to talk option because I have a headset with a mic switch on it so you can switch the mic on and off and push to talk for the controller isn’t necessary 
---
Absolute mad lad.
---
PS4.  Gamertag XxMr_MiAxX... Issues, I lost my explosive pump shotgun lvl 50 Fighting the scorchbeast queen I change to my melee weapon and it just disappeared.  been playing since the Beta only was able to Find that one explosive weapon and to lost it is upsetting
---
Camden Park has all the Excavator PA mods. Watoga Shopping Center has tons of PA mods for T series.
---
I was being facetious. Well, the booze anyway. I tried a few different goodies over the years, but I just decided that I liked my job with no pay, aka volunteer firefighter. I would drink occasionally, but only when I knew I wasn't going to get paged, or couldn't respond if I was due to where I lived and the amount of snow on the road. I just never felt the need to alter my state of mind with chemistry. I don't even remember the last time I had a beer. It was before September of 2017 though. That was when I went on dialysis and I got my transplant a year ago. I take enough drugs for medical purposes that I don't want take anything else. 
---
I did try a CBD gummy the other day. No thanks, I slept 14 hours. I don't believe in that crap. The only drug I take other than what is prescribed is caffeine. Even then I don't drink near as much soda as I used to. My body doesn't like sugar anymore and I am allergic to fake sugar. So sux to be me. 
---
I agree with you 100%. Same things happen to me and I’m really tired of it as well. 
---
Strange in numbers has been bugged to hell since beta, with all mutations. They need to rename it to random clusterfuck
---
Wow, someone doesn't understand sarcasm. 
---
Yes, completely agree. Found a way to place two missile turrets without them being obvious over there so it's looks like it'll be my permanent spot since my character's a vendor :p
---
I’m at the very same part of the game. I’m level 25 and Rose has me fighting lvl60 Super Mutants. Burns too many stimpacks. I think a part of the problem is high level players spawning in these lvl 60 mobs? 
---
I used to do this. I even set up workbenches and water purifiers with vaultboy pointing to them. After getting one-shotted well away from the workshop a couple of times I never take workshops. If a challenge is to take a workshop I do and quickly log off.
---
The fact that you are in PvP mode and don't have slap damage but full damage wherever you are as soon as you've claimed a workshop makes me not want to have them.
---
Bethesda is not banning people on a whim, again that was just the usual fake news.
---
As for your glitch, relogging should make the copies disappear. Happened to me countless of times.
---
Why not alow them to sell stable flux ? each faction could sell a different one.
---
You could have the generic item from a SB kill and add each faction a specific way of getting items.
---
Give the responder some aids, do enclave event, kill scorched for BoS... 
---
I'm throwing some idea but i don't know the lore enough 
---
They always manage to spawn within my defence concrete walls,  destroying my fusion reactor, artillery cannon and junk collector, even though they only way to get in there is using the powered door with keypad or  jumping over it when you have the marsupial mutation or using PA with jetpack.
---
I understand molerats manage to dig underground. But either it ghouls or mongrels that manage to spawn within my defenses. 
---
 No. My knife is way faster. ;)
---
Are you on the PC, because the mouse interfacing with the menu when dropping, selling etc is jankie as fuck. I accidently sold my TS Lever while selling granades because the mouse pointer slid after I was selecting quantities. I wish Bethesda put a little more thought into the PC UI.
---
I believe you can find it from the pumpkin event among others, but not with this random encounter.
---
They're just doing what I would, automating the gathering of a resource to make it easier on them. It's just an enemy grinder that happens to be in the most popular spot. They aren't cheating or glitching or anything. I see no problem with this
---
Please tell me how your post implies any sarcasm
---
THANK YOU!
---
Wondering this myself. I just collected 100+ tokens. I found a machine at Abandoned Mine Shaft Elaine (SW), called "Token Exchange Terminal". Also mentions it is part of the Hornwright Industrial Mining Company, if that's of any importance. In it, there are prizes ranging up to 100 tokens. However, the tokens I have (collected, also, mainly from the fairs--the nondescript token) don't seem to register here, as the machine is telling me it doesn't detect any tokens. So, this was my last thought for these tokens, for now. Going to drop again, as these ones are easy to obtain again when we figure this out! 
---
Oh I must have missed that! Sorry 
---
Have that sometimes when the servers crash, don’t see why it’s necessary to type my stuff in again if I was literally just playing 
---
 You are an idiot. Its the best game they ever made. Yeah I was at the beginning too and probably have more hours than you. 
---
 The game keeps getting better, its just amazing.
---
Grahm can be spawned at spawn points, much like the Responder Vender Bot mention in this thread.
---
 https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aotn63/psa_charleston_responder_vendor_bot?sort=confidence
---
I've had him spawn below Grafton at the fork in the road about 4 times now while server hopping that spawn point. 
---
I also agree whole-heartedly, and with all the other drama, I had forgot about this. And I now realize no fix for the slap-damage is in the works (among all the goodness)? It should be just 1 HP damage under all circumstances, simple.  Except maybe, they think giving the PVPers a separate server will be an answer? Any way I am lvl 112 and not a dick.
---
It's probably about true.
---
Sadly you remember the griefers, but not the ones ignoring you.
---
Not if ya got portable power maxed out ;) then it’s only 2.5 lb
---
So you see all those corpses, yet you're still trying to go out there... sure it's not some kind of warning? Lol
---
I've noticed that loading takes much longer if I load in near my camp.
---
As soon as the water has loaded in I'm usually good to go.
---
I’d say the “😎” is the giveaway
---
Yes, for a wasteland there's a lot you can't do, too many restrictions on lots of things.
---
I saw a guy who had built a tree house in The Mire, it was cool. I wonder how he did that?
---
sorry dude for messing with your post but BETHESDA isnt listening to the ppl that matter... their listening to ppl who just want more crap and wanna make the game easier... 
---
my turn for a REAL Suggestion: Stop adding more crap to the damn game and fix it.. send  your damned programmers to "computers for dummys"
---
and teach them the fucking limits of the damned consoles.. im tired of getting kicked off a server or bluescreened because it takes your system 3 mins to load the main graphics while standing still... and god help us if were walking... it never stops loading... JUST because you can program a computer, doesn't mean you know its limits... figure it out, and fix the damn game ..  preferably before the DLC's...
---
you're not wrong
---
I have 120 in my stash atm to sell (been selling other shit lately) I mean, I'm a sneak sniper so I don't get hit so often... but still
---
Thank you sir. 
---
Thanks, working on getting lv3 home defense actually!
---
Very cryptic observation there chap.
---
I personally can see that emoji being used freely in both instances.
---
Yes, the excavator armors were built and in use to an extent. They had the man vs machine challenge against the auto miner and lost. 
---
Spent my first hour there figuring out... Well everything.
---
I don't play much at all and I have 100k ammo all up (i can't bare to throw it away, I make my mate who doesn't play anymore use his random weapons to use it)
---
Anyone know how much the stealth blade mod actually does? And how it stacks with ninja?
---
I get servers where people are friendly than ones that arnt. When I log on I always look for high lv players on the map or groups of 50 and above players. Though I am in the 160s. I just dont like conflict. 
---
You probably run mods. Search for what you need to update in your Fallout76Custom.ini
---
 Deja vu  
---
I've just been in this time before  
---
Higher on the beat  
---
And I know it's a place to go  
---
Calling you and the search is a mystery  
---
Standing on my feet  
---
It's so hard when I try to be me, yeah 
---
Some of us high level guys (I am 280) are ok I promise.  I always play in pacifist and hate pvp. I like to actually help lower levels and usually drop food, ammo, plans, stimpacks and radaway for them when I see them. 
---
Thanks for this was able to build up a bit. Will make a point to swing by on my Vendor runs.
---
It very well could be, I was just saying that the 😎 emoji is likely the marker that OP wasn’t implement serious.
---
If I was to say “that sucks, needs more of _____” (which this statements underlying message would be, if not sarcastic) I wouldn’t be using 😎, something along the lines of: 🤣🤢👎🏼 would be a bit more fitting.
---
Like you highlighted though, it is a personal interpretation so how it comes across to You, Bobby, Veronica or Myself can differ.
---
Well, if I was criticizing for real, I wouldn't have followed up in the same post with no editing a compliment. The 'though' I did mean to edit out, but I stopped because I would rather not hide what I said. No, I didn't say it is amazing, or anything like that. The perfect timing with the lazer bolt and the mushroom cloud in the background is amazing. That is why I said perfect timing, mainly stating the obvious, but that is my sense of humor. People with even just a hint of common sense can usually understand what I am saying. Obviously you don't seem to have any. And with that, I will not respond to you again, as I don't deal with stupid people online. I dealt with that enough in my lifetime. 
---
Now add some mech-bear cavalry and t-rexes and you have the description of dubstep (when it was actually good).
---
All weapons! I have 4 pieces of reduced weapon weight armour and regularly carry around 20+ weapons without any other weight reducing perks, like another comment said, it's a life changer! 
---
I think the criticism is valid 😎
---
Definitely watoga or harpers. I see them regular 
---
You would be surprised but some of the deases actually do that. 
---
actually you can use some chems together
---
You can tame animals? Whaaa?
---
The area around Point Pleasant typically has a lot of ticks, especially the cemetery down the road from there I believe. 
---
I also want to thank the high level characters who shop at the top of the world, my base is nearby but when I fast travel back I am sometimes swarmed by mobs twice my level - over-encumbered, hungry, thirsty and with broken gear I have twice run through the train station trying to get away. On Sunday two hero's in power armor saved me from mole miners and yesterday a level 120+ saved me from super mutants. I would have been an easy kill and could have lost all of my junk, but instead we shared a few emotes and BOTH times the high levels followed me to give me cool stuff, ultracite power armor plans for later or some very needed stimpacks for now.
---
These encounters are some of my best experiences with the game and I would like to say why. I was gifted the game by some buddies who played a lot and wanted to make a squad. They hurried me around for 25 levels but quit the game because of the well-known problems. Over the last week I've started playing alone and it has been good but hard, I'd never fought solo or had to plan a route or design my own build. Playing slower, exploring and choosing my own goals has felt more like the ever-popular Bethesda games, but being helped by other humans is amazing and hints at what this game was meant to be, which I hadn't understood when I rushed through specific obligatory quests.
---
Considering I've been hunting a combat helmet, *expecting* an armour boost, I'll know not to bother now...
---
Not quite the only helmet with armour, the tattered mole head has a whopping 1 Dr! 
---
An attempt to close an argument as a winner is a guaranteed denial of a defeat.
---
I cant be half as stupid as the person who cant cop criticism, while criticising.
---
I am also convinced that you're back peddling.
---
tf are you talking about , try learning to read correctly before u be an asshole
---
lol 'quick trade for 1000 caps worth of *stuff*' in the middle of pvp
---
Haha same here
---
it's broken - once it loads as I got all killed except mirelurk queen (and killing it doesn't change anything) and once it loads as I didn't kill any monster from the list. Sooooo lame programers in BGS...
---
Kind of only feels practical for automatic weapons.
---
it used to be a duper's fav hot spot. Lots have been there
---
.... really?
---
wow. I made same error as op. will have to try this.
---
Just got lvl 60.

Every time I’m like screw it he’s only 20 lvls higher, maybe me and my lvl 50 buddy stand a chance. Bam. 1 shot. Dead. I do Zero damage every time and I’m instant dead every time. Don’t even know how. I’m assuming it a 2 shot explosive. I like to play the game. Not farm legendaries at some place I don’t even know about yet. The PVP in this game sucks ass.

100% agree

Whats your psn?

I am fairly new to reddit, and rarely use emojis, so when I use a cowboy emoji or the sunglasses depending on my mood and what type of humor I am reaching for. This entire        /s or other /letters is just not needed imo. Also, I am that guy that if I see the # symbol, I still think of it as the pound sign from the old touch pad phones and security systems. I also call tweets twits since that is about all twitter is good for. 
---
So to explain for other people, I do this because, well I can, I also do it because I think it is funny. Other than my wife and grandmother, I really don't care what anyone thinks of me. As my wife has to explain to me that I have a very dry sense of humor which leads a lot of people to not understand me. That's not my fault, it isn't their fault, it is part of being human. I very rarely say something intentionally to hurt another person's feelings, if I do, most of the time I apologize, sometimes I just say O don't deal with stupid people and don't talk to those people anymore, or if I have to, I try to have a translator with me or I just try and talk or post at a 5th grade level. I figure if that is what most newspapers print their stories at, it must mean people understand them. I prefer the wall street journal myself as they tend to print their stories at an 8th to 12th grade reading level. Still very sad imo, but too many people just don't read enough on their own to have a proper dialogue anymore. This has been true since at least the mid 70s. Damn television and now computers phones, etc. I still try to read 2 to 4 new books a week. When I run out, I go to the classics on the kindle ap. I also read medical journals and when I was a pre-teen I would spend rainy days in the summer reading law books. (My mother worked for a law firm)
---
I play video games as a way to work on my hand eye coordination since I have developed tremors from all of the medications I have to take to stay alive. 
---
The long story short, I almost never try to insult anyone, especially unprovoked. If I do, I try to right the wrong. If that can't be done, oh well, it is just the way life is, no matter on the interwebs or IRL. 
---
My Level 30 Metal/Leather Chest pieces take some BallFiber as well, so it ain't just you. :/
---
Shhhhh
---
What system do you play on? I've been primarily PC for a while now and I'm at level 83. I can't remember the last time anyone actually made an earnest attack against me. 
---
As far as I can tell, the addictions are still broken despite them claiming it would be fixed last patch. I used a lot of drugs and I haven't seen more than one addiction and that addiction fell off after re-logging to another server
---
I always do more damage to scorchbeasts shooting them in the head (Yes, I use Concentrated fire.). Not sure what you mean about the belly on them. 
---
Have 1 on XB1
---
I have posted about this a coupke of times. I agree with you, but get ready for the moron brigade that I consider psychotic. "ITS A SURVIVAL GAME." or "STUPID CAREBEARS"
---
Anyway yes, a lot of us, probably most of us agree with you. 
---
Yea same thing just happened to me. Ruined it. My weapons didn't do any damage. Then they one shot my buddy and take turns shooting are dead bodys. Possibly hacking to cuz when they were shooting us they were using explosives shot close range and taking no damage to themselves..idk but again it ruined the game for me
---
I've also found that the old clothes at the Battle Cemetery fetch a decent price sometimes, as well as the Ranger Outfits.
---
Yeah I def wish there were more of those commendation type quests in the game. Make it a high number and have incremental rewards like the op stated
---
High level player here and I only PvP with Whitespring trapcampbuilders.
---
Better than kb and mouse tbh. Game was made to be played on a controller from the ground up like any console port these days so why not.
---
They do since the beginning for me...
---
I started playing around the 15th december and i often have 1 to 3 screws on them.
---
Loading screen says no, but experience says yes. For example, berry mentats disable psychobuff effect, but psychobuff doesn't disable berry mentats effect. I always use it on SBQ fights
---
Yup. Visited his establishment for some PA mods too.
---
Been playing for 11 years its so good. What i miss the most is all the random encounters and unique locations it felt devastated but alive.
---
Thank you ! are you still doing this ? I'll be online at 6PM GMT.

---
I think the issue is if any helmet has any kind of bonus, everyone will use that, and they want everyone to use and buy funny/crazy/interesting hats. 
---
They solved this issue for clothing, we just need “headwear” that you could wear underneath. Or take it another way and have it be something you can craft into an existing hat.  
---
Sent pm 
---
May I ask why it took you so long to realise you didn't like your build?
---
It would be awesome 👍
---
if you're melee and fighting the SBQ outside the rad zone, it isn't useless. If you're doing PvP and someone uses a radium rifle or gamma gun, it isn't uselss
---
Nope, not griefing. He initiated it, and stupidly wouldn't quit. Enjoy your caps! I love it when some idiot doesn't know when to cut their losses. Can always use the extra money for travel expenses or a high-level crafting recipe.
---
Been trying different things. Unfortunately, due to the lack of build guides and wikis at release date, everything has been trial and error.
---
You can't speak for everyone, and many certainly didn't want multiplayer. The lack of dialogue is a compromise which is fine, notes and such is enough for me and there is plenty to explore and uncover.
---
If you're the sort of player who farms the same spot over and over server hopping to rinse loot, then it's no wonder you aren't enjoying it. Because that isn't how it's meant to be played. Obviously one can, and it's easily done, but takes the joy out of it. Don't play it if you don't like it dude is my advice. Try the new Metro 👌
---
I need arms plz. PM me...
---
As in sell to vendors to earn the 1,400 daily cap limit? I have two methods, they are as follows:
---
If I know I have time to play the next day: West Tek Research Centre, kill all the mutants, take their guns and sell them. I would scrap everything that has a lower value than an assault rifle. Cook glowing meat steaks and sell them too! With 15 charisma, you only need to relog and repeat one more time for 1,400 caps.
---
If I know I am going to be busy the next few days: Nuke whitespring, equip good with salt perk and harvest all nuked flora with green thumb. I would be good for 3 days. Just login to sell.
---
because item lvl drop depends on monster level that drop it - yesterday I dropped 2 legendaries - 60 LVL protectron gave me \*\*\* 50 LVL unyielding combat armor arm, while 22 supermutant berserker from other location \*\*\* LVL 20 pipe rifle
---
There's a house already in the Mire that you can put your camp at, maybe it was there? Or maybe he knows some magic I don't...
---
agreed, pretty common.
---
Ugh. That would be so nice.
---
Bethsda has been jipping me with the venders
---
My Gt is mikeeparks I'm on xbox and I love the fact that others do things like this as well. Any time I see a lower level player in a bind I offer help make gear guns and upgrades. If I could do serum I would as well. If any one needs a hand if I'm on hit me up and I will do what I can I'm currently level 155 and my camp is near white springs station. Its nice to meet new people and help.
---
Maybe just start a new character and then if you ever want to play with your old build you can. If you’re on XB1 I can help you power level in nuke zones and transfer gear and plans 
---
Ugh, took a while to dig it out.

---
Hey ! Could you make one for me as well please ? I'll be online tonight 6 PM GMT 
---
This is not turret exploit.
---
Just start a new character. You can have 5 characters. Leveling to 50 won't take that long anyway. I have one for melee, one for shotgun and one for sniper, I'm not regretting. 
---
Im on PC and I have an inventory that is absolutely priceless so I cant trust anyone to transfer it for me.  
---
Besides, if a respec cost 1000+ atoms, that would be very expensive if someone wanted to do it alot.
---
where is the 'quick trade' button?
---
yes, it's mods - you'll find on this reddit what you have to paste into custom.ini file - it fix the problem.
---
I’ve been noticing more random encounters idk if I’m looking around more or if they’ve been tweaking them since launch. 
---
The experiences in FO3 were very epic tho I agree and hard to recreate in a multiplayer environment. Part of why it was so exciting was the single player aspect, but now you have a lot of random encounters it’s just other players instead 
---
Haha, imagine him in Rust.
---
If you read my post and my post history you will see that I certainly am not unaware of all the faults of the game. I was specifically discussing the complaints of no new content after 3 months.  I agree the game is mostly a poorly thought out money grab. But I was just pointing out that its actually not been that long comparably as far as new content goes. But regardless. I still play the game because I still have fun despite it all. That’s why I am here posting on this sub.
---
Survival is about tension. There is no tension if you are always able to run home or to Vault 76 the minute your pockets get fat. The exception being when you are dead and your junk is dropped and you are floating in the ether. At the very least, restrict a player to fast travel between train stations, so you are forced to at least get to 'home base' with your load before you can teleport around. It would also have the pleasant side effect of turning train stations into the most dangerous areas in the game, while players skulk around looking for potential victims, or others play protector-types, looking for raiders to smash. 
---
If Survival is intended to be an unrestricted pvp-oriented mode, literally everyone that decides to bloat up on junk should consider themselves a potential target. You SHOULD have to creep through the woods and stay off roads in case you get spotted by passers-by or packs of baddies. If you're over-encumbered you should absolutely fear for your safety. It SHOULD encourage safety in numbers, so that when groups raid West-Tek or Uranium Fever, the walk back to someone's conveniently placed CAMP is perilous. This gets even better if you could not see other players on the map and only had the events to go on, as knowing that an event was transpiring would lead some to complete it, and others to stalk players nearby. People would scramble to form groups during and after these events just to get home safe. Sure, maybe the 4th person added gets assassinated by the other 3 and relieved of their load before they can spend it but that's life in the wasteland.
---
There’s perks and armor mods that negate most explosive damage so I doubt they were hacking, sorry that happened to you tho
---
Y’all already finish?
---
Don’t get me wrong, I understand where you’re coming from. I thought that “😎” was a pretty clear signal in terms of not being serious about your response.
---
I said in another comment that perhaps if 🤢/👎🏼/🤣 were used, then it’s a different story as to how clear the tone is.
---
At the end of the day, if OP had taken offence to it I’m sure they would’ve addressed you and you would’ve cleared it up. I only added my “edit:” in to cover myself because the way I’d written it came across kind of snarky when I read it back.
---
Out of curiosity, how do you find gaming helps you with the tremors? My grandma has an essential tremor and I’m certain it’s something I’ll have to deal with as I already show the same signs she did, when she was my age.
---
As far as i can tell i did not receive it
---
Good point. But it also doesn’t take me 9 seconds to sit down at and get up from a table, especially if something is trying to kill me. If all this realtime bs is going to happen, then end the animations for sitting, lying down, getting up, and maybe even getting in and out of power armor. It’s a cool sitting animation, but I don’t need to see it for the 3000th time. 
---
[Rust](http://playrust.com/) is still kicking, it's not that bad if you realize that raiding people's houses is only goal you have in the game.
---
It's game where you pump adrenaline to maximum when you have to fight for stuff you were farming all week.
---
There is just one rule. Better wins.
---
They wanted to reduce crazy build ideas that could give players an advantage in PvP or deny players access to some parts of the map. 
---
We found a way to do exactly that, so it's kinda pointless now
---
Oh! well that would never work, do you know what kind of character names mass ammounts of people have used xD
---
So many downvotes for telling truth, i didn't know that there is so many whinnie the pooh on this sub :O
---
I always assumed insta healing to be a legendary enemy thing as i dont notice it otherwise
---
done
---
True, I didn’t think about it that way, definitely a lot of money to be made by Bethesda if they so choose. They should still keep the current method as well for us paycheck to paycheck folks lol
---
While you are at it - please fix the translations for (at least) the german descriptions of the challenges. Sometimes they make no sense at all or are misleading, I had to ask in game for the english text on several occasions to understand what was necessary to complete them.
---
I just tell em to do what I Would do.  They are too stupid to listen, thats on them, not me.  As if their weak sauce downvote hurt me lol
---
Always have mate
---
Gimme your psn I’ll request n send message with which you need 
---
That’s not cool, it’s bloody awesome!!
---
But that only applies to your toon and not your stash box
---
Yeah, i was eating popcorn while watching this whinefest. This guy probably never saw high levels farming nuke zones.
---
If the OP had taken the wrong way, I would have apologized and just say it was my attempt at humor. Which is the truth. 
---
It seems to help some, but I don't know if it is in my head as an excuse to play or if it really works. The problem is the meds I take really doesn't care it just causes the tremors. I just learn to deal with it better thanks to the gaming. I think the wii as cartoonish as it was would probably be better with some of the sports games. It helped my grandmother until it died and my mom wouldn't hook up the one I sent to replace it. 
---
If the owner of the workshop is below lvl 15 I dont bother with it and ignore the workshop. But its free for all if above lvl 25. Yes pvp isnt a main part of the game but it is fallout and I like to imagin I'm the "raider".
---
I love it, my characrer has a similar concept but different build, I'm focussed on carrying, crafting, scrapping, heavy guns, and buffs for my teammates, 15+ Strength depending on if I'm in a group or not and tge time of day because of Solar Powered, and 21+ Intelligence based on if I'm in a group and boosted because of Egg Head.  Heavy Gun Perks only get used in White Springs and against the SBQ really but either way my Medic's 50 Cal and Medic's Gatling Gun work wonders in a group, can't really play solo anymore though.  Fortunately solo play is just for easy farming like screws, steel and wood, or redesigning my camp.
---
Nice char :) 
---
When you get to a higher level part of the fun is giving away extra plans, guns, armor, etc... to new players. I leave stuff in Flatwoods, too, in the vendor’s cash register or nearby on the floor. I hand off stuff to new players when I can, but a lot of times they run.
---
Like come on dude :D
---
*YOOOOOOOOOO!!!!* It's your **5th Cakeday** biobasher! ^(hug)
---
I can see restricting builds from certain areas, like areas quests happen in. But there's no reason I shouldn't be able to build a real tree house. IMO.  
---
And it'd be cool if there were a few small towns that weren't quest areas that we could "build in".
---
Then all should be wanted. 
---
I almost downvoted you because it is definitely not my cup of tea, then laughed and stopped myself. Thank you for the info. 
---
Are u interested to that, mate? 
---
PC players are way more introverted lol
---
150 here and I do the same man, I actually go out my way to go to flatwoods and lend a hand where I can. 
---
I only wish my excess vendor trash was more useful to the wanderers around there ;)
---
Yup we played it in group of friends when we could spend whole week in the game. 
---
From today perspective i have no idea how could we spend there almost 2k hours.  \^\^
---
So YOU’RE the player they created the Junkie’s weapons for! Can’t tell you how many Junkie’s weapons I’ve tossed because I’ve no interest in going this route and have never met anyone who was. 
---
If you post on the trading subs that you’re looking for Junkie’s weapons I bet you could pick up some sweet items pretty cheap. 
---
Respec at a cost seems reasonable, even a time period in between.
---
OP, get over it.
---
You get too hung up on tiny points of the map when their is a massive world with plenty of good farming spots. 
---
Just like when you tripped about no one telling you where the hatch was with the aliens.
---
( That was precious)
---
You guys are wasting Bethesdas time with requests that do not improved the overall game and just put training wheels on everything.
---
I actually wonder if it's a gameplay variety thing. All the weapons groups are a little different for perks available. Possibly spreading morebg
---
Shotguns don't have armor piercing. 90% weight reduction and faster reload on the same perk. Stagger and cripple on the same card. Crowd control?
---
Pistols don't have faster reload, but can increase movement speed. They also only get 75% weight reduction. High mobility strikers?
---
Heavy weapons get 90% weight reduction, but reload speed is a stand alone perk. Damage reduction while firing is unique. Tank build lots of agro?
---
Melee only gets 60% weight reduction (already too light?), Get the most armor piercing, no cripple perk. Strikers through and through 
---
Rifle get armor and stagger on the same card, but cripple requires it's own perk. Versatile damage dealers, but squishy and often lacking mobility. (Does the most damage depending on build. Highest potential.)
---
Not sure if this helps, but it seemed like an interesting thought.
---
Perk list please
---
The two shot thing isn’t a thing anymore dude. Probably some bloodied build. Can be ruthless ;)
---
I’m not into PVP but it isn’t all that bad really, it’s just not well balanced....yet!
---
If I ever find Legendary items like that I will also go crazy with caps lock. Fair warning. 
---
The one thing I want to see is with PvP if you don't have the caps to cover your next potential death, you can't seek revenge.
---
Yes, people are free to play what they want, but when it's a game that's in the state that FO76 is and it's developed by such a developer. Seeing those said people DEFEND these two things, to me really shows you the kinda people those players are. Play it all you want, I don't care. But when you have people try to enter an argument or a general conversation saying that it's a good game or defend that mess, I won't accept it personally and will shoot their opinion down. 
---
People are free to have opinion, doesn't mean they're right though.
---
There's always going to be a right and wrong. 
---
After putting in nearly 80 hours or so into Fallout 76 (more than I wish I did) I WOULD advise people to leave like I did yes, so what? I've had friends I've told to avoid it, they borrowed it from another friend to find they agreed, that it's dreadful and they're happy they didn't buy it, even at a discount. 
---
Yup, one spawns not too far from my camp in the mire, not as bad a neighbor as the 4-5 glowing bloodbugs, 3-4 glowing fog crawlers/anglers/rad toads/gulpers, the ghouls, and the mirelurk queen that all spawn within 200ft of my camp though.  I think those bloodbugs are plotting something, they're getting really ballsy and so is the mirelurk queen, might be working together, I'll have to ask the gulpers for help.
---
I don't even have a legendary effect on my combat knife and I love it. From my experience, the true power of this weapon is that it seems to stagger enemies and interrupt their attack animations really well
---
I think you should read the 2019 road map for the game that came out 4 or 5 days ago. Specifically I think the part in Summer 2019 that reads, "**New Feature: Legendary Players** – An all-new prestige system will allow players above level 50 to become Legendary, resetting their characters with all new more powerful abilities." Personally I am in the same boat and knowing that is right around the corner is making me push to past 111 where I stopped a few months ago. Right now i am averaging about 1 level per day. Wish you the best of luck. Link to the bethesda website for reference: [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-our-roadmaps](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-our-roadmaps) 
---
... well no gold or silver for you yet? Nice catfish attempt. Maybe some chummy person will come along and not dunk on you for posting stupid stuff like this.
---
we should have got a free respec after they decided to.nerf certain perks and weapons. a lot of level.ups wasted to get specials where you want them to use certain perks..then they go and change the perks.on you.
---
Check the title, I’m buying those 😅
---
I wish, it happens to most of my team mates as well, very annoying
---
if you have tactical marine helmet plan they cost very little to make and sell for 20 to 30 caps each depending on your charisma and perks. 
---
no, luck doesn't give better chance to get better loot.
---
This!!!! Or burping!!
---
Also, I don't go looking up people's post history neither, I mean why would i want to do that? 
---
I don't need to do research on someone. 
---
You don't pull out your phone and search up someone's social media history when you meet them in people for the first time, especially in conversation so why on here? 
---
Thank you. I completely forgot about the only mod I have which is the mod to fix the death tambo sound issue. Thanks 
---
So why take it out and depreciate what someone else can love? Let it go- walk away. Pissing all over it in public isn't a fair send off or farewell. It's embarrassing and makes you both look bad and it's just negative energy being recycled back into negative energy. I hope you really can learn to connect with you and love yourself, that's where everything starts. One small step until you find your pace and you move forward in sync down this crazy journey of life. Maybe it's not Bethesda and the game that is making you dissatisfied. Maybe it's unrealistic expectations.. whatever it is i hope you get there . 
---
But please don't piss I'm my sandbox.
---
Oh shut up and eat a jar of rotten pickles
---
Good on you for stopping the turrets, I'm fine with people camping at Whitesprings, even 1 or 2 turrets isn't so bad, but it's just a dick move to camp in the heavy spawn areas like at the golf club.  Bethesda really should prevent you from camping so close to White Springs, but still close enough to where you can walk there if you're over encumbered and need to sell suff.
---

I’d like a non-pvp option. I have zero interest in it and have been ambushed a few times at workbenches. I don’t have a pvp build and someone raiding usually does, so I just log out and log back in on a different server. It doesn’t happen a lot - I’m on a PC format.
---
other legendaries do regen. Sometimes they don't. It's not consistent and has always been a bit buggy. Someone said starred legendaries heal at half health and non starred ones don't but I've had both happen to me.
---
Imagine him being literally the only other human NPC they add. Lmao
---
What else would they do with theyr playtime given the lack of pve content?
---
&gt; Then the server catches up and adjusts the monster health "instantly" to what the server thinks it should be and updates it for the player. Less of a bug and more of a server stability issue.
---
This is what I've always assumed. The laggier a server is, the more this happens to me.
---
Looks like they have only solved Alpha so far.

You can sell them, you just wont get the full value in caps.
---
Do you have the Hard Bargain perk (or Charisma boosting gear) equipped?
---
If you do, removing them should lower your sell price (not sure if it'd be enough though).
---
Yes I agree the animations for things are slow as f

If I place a power armor piece onto a frame in the inventory view at any time it always appears duplicated. But it is a visual bug only. Once you enter the frame the bug goes away. The pieces and core are never actually duplicated.

I use few mods - 21:9 that bethesda doesn't bother to fix for many patches, silencing turrets and other stuff in the camp and clean brick walls (I don't understand why you build them from the scratch and they're already dirty?!?!).

Seems that PC has very few twats. 450+ hours here and I was griefed once, which I just fast travelled away from. I've mostly seen Xbox players complain (as a general observation).
---
All I can tell you was I was interested in this too till I found out there were bugs like you can't become addicted to chems while wearing power armor. I cant remember what other armor pieces effected it but there were others and it might be tied to items that protect you from air born diseases maybe... like i said I can't remember. I wish you luck. 
---
It makes no sense. Half the world you can't build in because it's "too close to existing structures." But you can build 5 feet from the freaking back of the golf course lmfao
---
I had this happen before, it is just a display bug. If turning the quest off/on in your pipboy menue or reloging does not fix it you can just visit the location you are supposed to go and do the necessary step (pick up a key). It will update for the next step then.

If you can't remember where to go, there are some good step by step guides out there, for example on dulfy.net or IGN

Ultracite PA plans are only dropped by scorchbeasts (not only SBQ, I got some from LVL 80 too, but it's much more rare). Due to the low availability they're expensive - I would rather look for someone that learned it and ask him to craft you (with your materials).
---
&gt; Gamertag **gofukyurself326**
---
Hmm...
---
I've got a few ultracite plans. Braces, vents, coiled torso. 
---
They drip from SBQ but they're rare. Some are super common and you end up with loads.
---
Thanks for the advice!  I wasn't sure how rare it was, the the few times the SBQ gave me a mod plan for the Ultracite it was either the Rusty Knuckles or the Explosive Vents and they both were rewarded to me several times.
---
Not sure if it's the same but Deathclaws actually take more damage from shooting them in the belly, at least that was for sure the case in fallout 4. I've only ran into a few in 76 but it seemed to work the same to me.
---
Makes sense, I think earlier today I had three copies of the Explosive Vents plans, so I'm guesisng they're the most common.
---
&gt; Of course - once you finish the first challenge the next one is to collect wood 7600 times. That is not going to happen within my lifetime.

I'm sure 900h guy has completed the challenge. ;-) But more seriously, I've been playing since the B.E.T.A. and have 440 hours logged, and the wood challenge shows around 1300/7600. And that is only because I made it a habit to click on every log I come across.
---
If y'all ever feel like boosting this, there is [Sylvie &amp; Sons Logging Camp](https://www.ign.com/wikis/fallout-76/Sylvie_and_Sons_Logging_Camp) in the NE part of the map, which has a sh!tload of wood piles ready to loot.
---
Don't forget: the most rewarding challenge of them all is the Explore Appalachia For 7600 Hours that will net you a stunning 20 Atoms! :-p
---
In total I've had the explosive vents 8/10 times from SBQ - it's almost every drop at this point. 
---
It’s not to far away from West Virginia you know. We could see it in a future update 
---
I don't consider myself to be a signficiantly high level, having just reached 116 but seeing high level players pick on low level players pisses me off.  Almost makes me wish my build was good for PVP.
---
It's good to use if you're in the area and want a couple hours of +5% exp, or when I was a very low level and needed to heal/was low on food. Now it's more of a decoration with occasional use. 
---
I did similar... wanted to save some ammo so I used a combat knife I’d picked up. Holy cow - they’re so fast! It does seem weird running around with a knife in power armor... like a toothpick weapon.
---
Not so often.  It does happen though.  Snalleygags* (Spelling?), super mutants  , mirelurks etc.  At least 1 spawn with chance at legendary.  Always worth a check on login.
---
Damn, looks like I gotta farm that event for those, the Enclave Bunker for ths X-01 Jet Pack, and Lucky Hole Mine for lead, good thing I enjoy mindlessly farming and tedious tasks.
---
It not just power armor. Anytime I switch armor around it does this. PS4 player.
---
Console - PS4. 
---
Ha! I thought it was just me.
---
I fear no man. But that... Thing...
---
That thing scares me.
---
They will be added probably 
---
A level 63 asked if I wanted my Wanted gone. Told me to take off my armor so he wouldn’t damage it. Then told me to come get my stuff.  Told him thanks.  
---
I was wanted after opening supply drop. 
---
I had a great display of multiple PA’s, walls of legendary weapons and various bottles and nuke colas in FA4. Displays were great.
---
I really hope so man its not much to ask for ya know how I feel?
---
I have a base luck of 12 but recently started boosting it with appalachilli, opposom bacon, and day tripper and it does kind of feel like the legendaries I get are better quality, it’s a bit subjective and I prob wouldn’t put any more special points in it but luck giving snacks and chess can’t hurt lol
---
I lost my marine chest panel feeding people. Now I let them starve.
---
I was thinking they'd go either east or south, like Richmond or Charlotte. At the same time the feel of the game is wilderness so I wouldn't be surprised if they avoid cities. 
---
Two steps and back at the entrance?  Hell I've gotten all the way to the crafting room before and had to do it again, more anoything than anything but it should be fixxed, never happens anywhere else as far as I know.
---
And me shooting them in the head like an imbecile, and thinking "these things are too hard!".
---
Neil Breen?
---
Yes. Yes it is.
---
I killed SBQ at least 30 times (it's none of the achievement, I know) and didn't get any usefull mods plans, just one mutation recipe. Really, find someone who made you mods.
---
I find the higher the player, the more likely they are going to fuck with you. My most recent encounter with a d bag, I was level 9, carrying a load of junk to build my base. Decided to capture an unowned Workshop so I could put down a stash box. Capture it then use a bench to fix my guns quick. I instantly die, respawn and see a level 300 in chameleon gear capping the workshop. I think oh he might have wanted it, I'll just grab my junk and go. Nope, the cunt took all my junk. Why the fuck would a level 300 kill a level 9 and take his junk. He then Tries to kill me again, using slap damage this time. I gave up and just left the game.

The Pitt was great and I would like to have some larger cities to explore.
---
I always put excess stuff in the overseer's cache there. Sometimes I'll claim Sunshine Meadows, set up the food processor and a water purifier, and do food and water runs. 
---
Yes! I hope they will reveal the DC zone in a future update, maybe with high level bosses.
---
Whoever commented I can no longer see your comment 🤷‍♀️ 
---
100k ammo in total of every type put together isnt unreasonable, i thi k it was 600,000 of 1 type of ammo, 240,000 ultracite ammo and a few hundred thousand of other different ammo types.  
---
That is pretty unreasonable, not impossible i dont think, but so highly unlikely its inplausible
---
People keep thinking the turret bases don't achieve anything but to grief the other players.
---
It's not true, it's a weapon farming method. 
---
They don't get XP, they DO get loot. Every kill by camp turrets generate loot for them. 
---
It's greedy, selfish and obnoxious but there's a reason they do it and it's not to grief, it's because it's a very efficient legendary farm.
---
Didn't see anyone mention this but the good with salt perk will help keep them from spoiling 
---
I’m a new player and I’m really enjoying how the game plays. I’m sure those people are out there l, but everyone has been really helpful. Xbox Gt: dubjthreat 
---
Is anyone else having a disconnect issue? I'm level 222 have been playing since the BETA version was released. But after the last patch I can log on for about 30 seconds and I get disconnected. I live with my girlfriend we both have been playing the same amount of time using the same internet and modem and she dosent have this issue at all, but if I join into her server she gets disconnected as well. Last night she was playing with 3 people on her team, I joined her server and when I got disconnected so did all 4 of them. I also created a new character on the same XBOX and played a few hours with no disconnect issues, but as soon as I logged off the new charecter (level 14) and loaded my original character level 222 AGAIN after about 30 seconds server disconnected.... IS IT TOO MUCH TO ASK TO LET ME PLAY THE GAME? I can deal with the bugs and issues the game has, but I can't PLAY this game at all now, unless I want to start over...AND NOPE I JUST DONT WANT TO DO THAT...
---
Common usage of turret house strategy that you could encounter in the game since its release. Nuke sites are farmed like this on daily basis.
---
It's a pretty boring and cheap strategy but it's nothing against game rules and it doesn't exploiting any game mechanic. If someone stood there with overpowered explosive gun or high-end hammer which oneshoting everything on sight results for others would be completely same. 
---
Whats more there is nothing easier than moving somewhere else and mind your business. If you are sitting in this location all day and night, you are not much better than this guy. He just promoted it to higher level.
---
If your an Xbox player look me up I can build you the handmade and modify it for u.

Thanks! Now instead of wondering where to get lead, you are going to be scrounging for waste acid to smelt all that ore. 
---
I am a first time player of Fallout. The kids and the hubby begged me to play on pc. I finally relented. I love it. I am only level 91 but I am the packrat for everyone. LOL. My camp is located near the Whitespring...its about where the snake is on the map. My camp has "open" signs on both front and back. All doors unlocked. One open purifier out front (locked one is the one I use) for anyone passing by, once you go into the garage there is a door to the garden and fertilizer. In the garage are all the benches minus the cooking area. There is also a bed in case the wandering traveler needs it. Upstairs is the kitchen with a cook station, an upright piano, a deck, etc. I constantly am filling up the trashcans inside the Whitespring so if you need anything come by! I also stream on twitch tv as TwistedMamaLlama. Lol. My name in the game is NehaLightdancer. Stop by! I love helping anyone! 
---
Real sorry to hear that dude. I’ll be honest, the difference at these kinda levels is lack of content. I help others out because there isn’t a great deal for me to do and I’ve always enjoyed doing that since I was first out the vault, even more now since I have loads of spare supplies. 
---
And the player you encountered...
---
Well, clearly mega bored and a nasty raider by the sounds of it :/
---
When I used to get griefed at lower level - server hop. These people want you to react! Good luck out there ;)
---
Loot tables and exp are off in general. It is more bullet efficient for leveling to kill low level mobs then high level mobs...even at a high level.
---
With a bad build or 1 star or less weapon, killing lvl 20 mobs give more exp per bullet.
---
I keep hearing that people get wanted for that but not once have I gotten wanted for opening a supply drop, is it random?  Or am I bugged because that is a bug I would appreciate keeping.
---
That's true... Forgot about acid, just finished dropping the last of my supply actually. Before some guy came into my base and started harassing me with his knife. Guess I'll have to get more when I go lead hunting next. XD (Side note, lured him to the highest floor which was at peak height of my c.a.m.p and then logged out. Here's hoping the guy who interrupted me fell to his death since he was already hurt. ;3)
---
"Lack of discernible head..."
---
That's what clues you in to it being the Grafton Monster.
---
This is why i still keep playing. I'm in my 130's and make it my mission everytime I see a sub 20 to give them a hand. Almost always drop a baggy of 20 stimpac , radaway and radx with any guns and ammo I can spare. At the end game it's so easy to get 500+ .308 or 10mm so giving them away with any spare plans is no issue. The more newbs that come in and have a good experience the better. As the saying goes one good turn deserves another.
---
Take out the deathclaws legs before you aim for weakpoints. If you have a crippling weapon, you can break their legs and incapacitate them utterly. They can't even attack with both legs broken. With one, they're incredibly slow.
---
Nice one man! 
---
I pick up all the clothing outfits at white springs and the asylum. Straight jackets sell for 20 each and the golf outfits are like 11 each with only 1 chr and they weigh 0.10 
---
Respeccing is called creating a new character...
---
I like that, nice.
---
I want that dumbshit Marty in the YouTube comments to come here and try to defend this guy haha. What a douchebag.  
---
Thanks so much, but PC  here.
---
No Escape!
---
Could have clearing out Raider camps as Order of Mysteries quests. Definitely need more rewards for doing stuff. On my alt character I have no reason to go into any locations other than to secure some junk. Only following the key quests to get certain items/access.
---
Fallout 3... so many wonderful memories. That's where everything started.
---
Appalachia is wonderful, Boston was amazing, New Vegas too... but DC is where I left my heart
---
I remember the sewers, used to get lost in there so many times... and the underground metro with so many mazes and secret exits, OMG I spent so many nights wandering in the pitch black tunnels with ferals. 
---
That was the real devastated wasteland...
---
Nothing worse than a drone on Fadeaway
---
Pretty sure you get rubber from scrapping some guns. By habit, I pick up every weapon that drops and scrap them. Steel, wood, and rubber for days, after clearing something like uranium fever.
---
I desperately want a starched-genes equivalent for us junkies. Addictions aren't really viable at the moment.
---
Aside from the one active Chem issue, the Pipboy is notorious for incorrectly displaying status effects (see any mutation thread). Addictions are hard to acquire and in my experience new addictions may overwrite existing ones. It's far too micro intensive to play at the moment; having to constantly check your damage output, senselessly chugging 10+ chems when you realise a particular addiction you knew you had doesn't appear to be functioning.
---
Sad thing is, if they ever clear up these issues it'l likely result in a huge nerf. I'm sure with 5+ (I should find out the maximum) addictions a legendary with our prefix would be very competitive. 
---
thank you
---
I did an event twice today where killing the Scorchbeast that spawned from it landed me a prime receiver plan each time (of course for weapons I don't use). I'm kind of surprised plans or legendaries aren't regular drops for Scorchbeasts. It would make sense and make killing them a lot more worthwhile.
---
Have found some bodies/loot spawn at the spot where the ghoul spawned rather than where you killed it, it if you lead it outside to the tennis courts you might find a pile in the canteen area.
---
I have had some interesting effects where a ghoul wont wake up while I am hacking away at it...which to be fair is not the worst thing that could happen as its an easy kill
---
i posted it a few days ago  and a plyer responded:

they changed it 2 or 3 updates ago and i dont think anyone is sure why. but anytime you go after a drop that you didnt summon it gives you wanted, so pretty much ignore if you didnt drop it
---
its slight but if you see "steal" after picking now instead of "take." its the only warning you get now

I messaged a few higher level players in my server tonight as I was having a tough time beating the final Fire Breather's mission in Belching Betty tonight because I was going against level 45+ to 65+ scorched in the mine while I'm only a level 22 with weak af weapons. Luckily someone who was a level 150 was willing to help me clear the mine and then crafted me a decent combat rifle and some armor at my camp. 
---
I had been trying to beat that mission for two months now, but due to mainly 95% disconnects and then my lack of good weapons or armor I couldn't finish it. Thank you to all you helpful higher level players!!!
---
I have carnivore and u can still get diseases with spoiled meat and ir does bring up ur hunger bar but it's so minimal. U just want get diseases when u eat them raw
---
Have you ever played Rust? Nakeds with rocks are the most dangerous enemy.  
---
Odd, the other day my friend and I shot down a cargo bot, it accidentally landed in someone's open air camp, we picked the lock and got the loot out of it and didn't get wanted, also I think it may have destroyed part of their camp because it landed right next to some crafting tables, their generator and their water purifier and was set to self destruct.
---
Ok thanks
---
That's the medical googles.  Best place to find them, the BOS Hood, Fleight Helmet  and Welding Helmet is at the Ranger Station in Cranberry Bog.  
---
I didn't delete anything I don't think. Was it deleted for me? 
---
wow
---
Honestly, it wouldn't be that big of a deal when pretty much every single online game has text chat. I understand that some people might like a "Singleplayer-ish" experience due to this game still having a Fallout name on it (And for those people they could just add an option to disable text chat, just like every game has), but text chat in online videogames has been a concept for over 30 years now, so there are pretty much no excuses when it comes to difficulties in implementing it. 
---
Not looking for any validation. Just bringing awareness to what's happened to me and others. Couldn't care less if you approve or not. 
---
Yeah, I felt bad but it was meant to be, the box literally fell out of the sky and rolled down a mountain into their camp.
---
My point isn't to argue what I've done it's that I've been accused of duping which I haven't done.
---
Thanks for clarifying that while I was away
---
I don’t think I was defending the game though. I don’t think you actually read what i wrote. Or maybe I wasn’t a good target for what you wanted to say. I never once defended it as a good or bad game in my initial comment. OP said many things, I was commenting on his suggestion that 3 months is too long to wait for additional content from a Bethesda game. I pointed out that 3 month is absolutely the normal period. Yes yes, the game never should have been released in the shitty state that it was, but that wasn’t what I was discussing. 
---
I bumped into him at the bog town last night at my last opportunity to get the weekly photo challenge with him. What a wizard!
---
Bethesda knows about this and has done very little... They like the community forming around these issues and in all honesty expect most of us to come together!!! If we want factions and choices to make a difference and change things then this is necessary... The game is static and this will entice (and already has) many people to form their own groups (Such as the TAPA or automated turret protection agency)... Wouldn't you rather join the BOS or Enclave and actually believe you can make a difference other than what has already happened?  I have heard of BOS groups trying to stop nuke launches and Enclave groups trying to launch countless nukes!  These are better than NPC's, because you cant read the solution online..... too many people have gotten used to godhood in the fallout series (All this being said I respect exploiters a lot and believe that they improve these games... People who who use glitches (I only consider those to be people who use duping and or glitches that give unfair pvp advantages, and I don't believe melee is overpowered or glitched as you can easily put over 3k damage to them before they touch you)..
---
When did I say I was cheating? Never admitted to that. The accusation is that I used the dupe glitch which I haven't done. 
---
How about next time you just tag the enemies and let the turrets help???!!!
---
It was rhetorical. People on reddit often assume they know someone’s opinion based of off one little post. Like you did here. 
---
Oh ok, thanks
---
I thought it was just me. I broke five in a row the other day. 
---
Well that's KS for stopping by anyway. It was nice of you to comment.
---
I playing on PC ,but I also lost 3 good weapons in a similar way The worst is that no one is likely to read these complaints and nothing will change. For me Bethesda is mocking people, because the game gives you almost nothing but junk and every time you accidentally find something nice you lose it in a ridiculous way.This is the reason why Betesda is first in my black list for game publishers, I probably will not buy another game of them
---
At first it was almost immediately but then I got the email and it took them a week. 
---
Lots of wood at Whitespring fyi. Do the circuit and grab golf clubs, pool cues, racks, golf tees and then the wood items in the cabins/putting green/laundry. Board games, toys, wood piles, picture frames, etc.
---
Or as has been said, move your camp.
---
Definitely needs something to distinguish between the sets. But if you mix and match, what then. Maybe we need a colour system or numbered or ANYTHING lol
---
The replies to this tells a lot. 
---
 Honestly it's hard not to feel let down by this game and this company recently. Hell even by this sub. 
---
I hope where ever you end up next is better!
---
Do you have Pharma Farma? That does wonders for me.  Based on the wiki, luck only improves the condition of found items: [https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Luck](https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Luck)
---
Rust: You log in for the first time and there are 8 completely naked players bashing each other to death with rocks. You run away, gather supplies, and get one shot blasted by a high level with a sniper rifle who steals your rocks and wood.
---
Just kill them and sit on their bag so no one else can grab it. When they respawn throw up a heart or two. If they get salty then its on, if not then all good. Its better to ask for forgiveness than permission lol
---
&gt;  but once u hit level 30 or so and have discovered every thing the game gets really boring
---
No way have you "discovered everything" if you're only level 30.
---
&gt; If you enjoy playing solo you shouldn’t get it,
---
If you enjoy playing solo you absolutely should get it.  I've only every been attacked once in 290 hours.
---
How did I admit that? I've not once said they didn't count wrong. Maybe there's more details I'm not aware of that got lost in the sauce. Maybe that is my bag(it isn't as a reminder) Or maybe I didn't dupe and picked up a f-load of stuff from a bag I found. I'm not sure what your point is in telling me I can't prove my point when I've admitted that already. 
---
I don’t remember xD
---
Stormtroopers in Fallout 76 confirmed!
---
Happy Birthday 🎉 ! That cake looks delicious !!
---
Good for you! Keep grinding my person! 
---
I wondered if they will open up that slice of land that's on the other side of the river (left side of the map).
---
In every demographic there are arseholes and nice people. Dont write off a whole group of people just because of a few pricks. Im lvl 309 and im nice to people. The fault lies with not having anything to really do past sbq, some people use this as an excuse to be arseholes. And then add in the exploits that are still in the game and its a shit show sometimes. But overall, in the 500+ hrs ive spent in this game, the overwhelming majority of people have been absolute fucking diamonds. Regardless of the level they are. Ive also met absolute tossers that are lvl 10.....so it swings both ways really.
---
Maybe split intelligence down and include Nerd Rage as well as makeshift warrior 
---
Even more reason to include some more cities imo, add some variation rather than more of the same
---
I have a 200 cap bounty right now because of blowing up a camp outside the back doors of whitesprings last night. 
---
I totally agree! Needs to be initiation based PVP if you're in pacifist, and playing adventure mode when the new modes launch.
---
I was on a server with a griefer recently who was beating anyone lower level. Completely ruined my evening and rinsed me of over 500 caps +and don't get me started on the screws I'd been farming for). Tried server hopping and got spawned back info the same world and the f***er followed me.
---
The fun part of DC was walking through the subways lines to get to other parts of the city.
---
Also Megaton was like comming home for me. 
---
Looks purrrrfect!
---
Loll
---
Can you not find an explosive legendary crossbow? 
---
Sounds like a slippery slope toward loot boxes
---
You knowingly used the duping glitch, you may not have created the item but you used and knowingly had the duped items in your inventory, you've already admitted you knew those items are not allowed, you knew the risks now pay the consequences and stop your tempter tantrum and crying, this is embarrassing. 
---
Floating Stash Box.......UNPLAYABLE!  Looks like a good place
---
I hope they add. Theres already the asset of it, looking exactly the same. Its where you find the excavator suit. 
---
You can place walls without foundations if you build uh a metal wall frame (the one with stairs under defense). It’s finicky tho-
---
Place a frame with stairs and attach a frame without stairs to it. Build two walls, one on each frame. Scrap the wall in front of the stairs. Scrap the frame without stairs. Scrap the frame with stairs. 
---
You now have a only a wall (in front of where your frame without stairs used to be). You can mess around with more walls and roofs to build something without a foundation, although you still won’t have complete freedom. 
---
Happy birthday!
---
and that is one good looking cake :)
---
Have a good one
---
Isn't Raven Rock right on the cusp of WV? Would definately like to revisit the area
---
We all just hope you mature eventually and in the future don't run to the internet for validation on something you did wrong. 
---
Those are the stealth builds.  Not sure what theyre up to. 
---
If you need help and on pc hit me up ign minorthtreats
---
Wow, video games sure bring out the weirdos. 
---
Not that I agree with it, but I think it makes sense, they had to limit where you could place your CAMP because they let you place it almost everywhere, unlike FO4 where you were limited to the settlements.  
---
I'm on Xbox unfortunately, but thanks anyways man! 
---
Hah! Absolutely!
---
I am lvl 141 and still havent found out how to craft stimpacks 😁
---
The last 3 days I’ve only been able to do ecological balance but I usually don’t bother with that particular quest cause you have to obtain the password each time you do it 
---
Think Fallout 4 with a constant rad storm mod on. Probably a bunch of new, deadly and frequent weather types. With changes food and water, maybe more scarcity. 
---
What psn name I'll add u
---
Ayyy happy birthday dude
---
The purveyor will rip us off XD
---
Short for “duplicated.” It can get you banned even accepting glitched items and it screws up the game. 
---
Banhereicome!
---
I found some two shots so far  and found a bloodied deathclaw recently. Now i am aiming for legendary armor
---
at the roof of the back entrance for the whitespring bunker.
---
I've had this happen a couple of times with normal mongrels, it's pretty annoying.
---
Accepting duped items gets a ban so you can see where people are concerned. 
---
Yeah. I ended up in the ceiling at white springs last night when I used vats on a ghoul that didn't drop out properly. Used vats on him again to get out. 
---
Not sure what platform you on, but I'm on XB1.  If you get bored and want to run around with somebody, feel free to add me:  GT - AlpineYJ.
---
You are ruining his play experience too. How I play is all that matters to me. I don't care if someone does this because it's a cheese farm spot anyways. How about you go somewhere else to farm.
---
Sounds like they had an actual pvp build vs. random gear. It makes a huge difference.
---
That's a lot of stimpack weight you are carrying!  I try to keep 50 stimpacks, 50 radaways/diluted (because I use them alot in WS nuke events) and 20 or so radx because I hardly use them.  For healing packs, about 30 at any given time.  I give/sell my diluted stimpacks and radx.
---
It’s not even bad against higher lvl enemies if you mod it for anti armor. I have an anti armor legendary version of what you’re talking about, super useful. 
---
Yup I have unlocked every material+pocketed and others this way and it has taken at least 300 scraps... What happens here is that it seems to be over now :/ 
---
Will give a try at the enclave vendor thanks! Is it the armory one?
---
"It just works" 
---
Used to happen to me a lot in the silo when I did melee VATS on the turrets. Normally you can just jump down, but a few times I was so stuck, had to FT out. 
---
I can build it for you, I’ll be on for a few in a couple of minutes. 
---
IGN Mcgivens82 
---
Why would you do that knowing that it's possible you can be banned?
---
I'll take things that didn't haooen for 500 Alex
---
Build one of those 100% foundation enclosed camps.
---
I run stealth vats as well. The majority of SB defense events I've experienced are 2-3 scorchedbeasts. It's impossible to maintain stealth long enough to do more than the initial front end damage. After that it's plugging away with the LE or handmade.
---
idk, i was trying to stall the dupers
---
Two word: Hemlock. Holes.
---
Geez, can I have it? I’d love to have that just as a back up weapon. I would treasure it forever :)
---
There isn't, op is a liar
---
I loved this area at that level.  Since dying is so weird, I would just keep throwing myself at those enemies and rack up xp.  
---
Congrats on your copy! 
---
Explore much of vault 76 as you can cause you’ll never be able to step inside once you exit unless of course you start a new character.
---
Also just a hint, eject a special holotape from your room’s terminal and visit the overseers office for some lore (there’s another holotape loaded in the overseer’s terminal but it’s all good if you miss out on it cause you can get it from a mr handy named Pennington I think outside vault 76.
---
And take things slow, don’t rush quests cause you’ll get bored of the game pretty quick. Explore the towns and buildings, listen to holotapes, read notes and read terminals. This game has a lot of hidden details that make it worthwhile.
---
On behalf of the cult of the Mothman we welcome you to Appalachia! (Find the ritual mask and outfit, they look sick as)
---
Half the traps don’t work either. I’m very disappointed with the tripwire. 
---
Lol you would have been vanned right away if it was past the limit. 
---
I think rather than an app solely for the atomic shop, I think a sequel to the pip boy app (fallout 4) for 76 would be nice that includes any updates on the atomic shop
---
Yes, really really needed. 
---
I can't wait to eat it.
---
Just shoot some of the mobs once, you'll get the XP when they die too haha 
---
He goes on walkabout every so often. I found him in the water on the opposite side of watoga yesterday. 
---
They also clip to the side of slanted roofs, but that’s another set of problems if you try to place on that way. 
---
You have to be a lot more specific here.  Otherwise, you are encroaching upon White Knight territory.
---
* Turret farms in Whitesprings = goofy, but not really bad.  
---
* Turret farms directly behind the golf club = target.
---
The statement about enemies not being able to path over there is incorrect.  Somebody else posted in another thread about this, but you can effectively kite the ghouls out of the front of the golf club, lead them near the edge of the road adjacent to the pool area, and around behind the turret camp.  99% of the time, the turrets can't see them, and there are usually convenient stairs you can lead them up for some one-on-one face time with the turrets.
---
Exactly, thank you.
---
Name could be derived from what armor type you have the most of on that chassis.
---
...or how about just being able to name them?
---
Upvote the shit outta this. 
---
Not currently but maybe at 10 am (eastern time) today 
---
We need a message stating that "(some monster) has mutated!" - just for this one defining purpose.
---
Could the avoidance of cities be attributed to Bethesda’s Server Ability (or lack there of)?  I think maybe this is why the ideal of “West Virginia Wilderness” was appealing.  More wide open and less taxing having to load all the buildings like you would find in Fallout 4’s downtown Boston.
---
What’s the pumpkin event? 
---
Is 10am eastern time normally the time they add new atomic shop items? (I live in a completely different Timezone)
---
I'm level 12. Yesterday, I roll into this guy's house he built and this level 150's guy is just standing in there. I say what's up and he just stands there, not moving. I start using one of his benches and he runs out the door and locks it. Requires level 3 to unlock and I'm at level 1 lockpick, so I'm fucked. I had to jump servers..
---
Guess I know where I'm headed after work. Thanks
---
That would be nice definitely yeah but on the bright side on the roadmap there seems to be more exciting events/quests coming like a fasnacht parade! 
---
Asking too much
---
\*\*plays theme song\*\*
---
Belching, farting, and peeing on an open mic should garner a bit of attention.
---
You can buy the recipe from the enclave bunker med terminal.
---
What I’ve noticed, we usually get new items either 10 am eastern time (for me) or 7 pm eastern time (for me as well) and since it says on the home screen that the Mothman stuff was ending February 25th and today is the 26th we might see new stuff here in a few hours. Or maybe not. 
---
I love combat knives, they were my weapon of choice for a couple months. I never seem to get a good legendary effect, though, so I'm mainly using a switchblade at the moment. Nothing beats the feeling of speed you can get from the spammy knives!
---
&gt; I hate the video about fallout 3 because nobody hates fallout 3

&gt;Never said people DON'T hate it.

Welcome to the  mother fucking wasteland.

In this day and age where people sue for a lot of silly reasons, I can see this happening. As the suit is a iconic homage to mad max, it would not be the creators that sue but the studio (aka Warner Bros) will.
---
&gt; but a lot of times they run.
---
In-game "text-chat" could help here…
---
I don't want to force anyone to talk or to interact with me, but at least I could say: "I've left some free stuff in X, that could be helpful for you, feel free to take it".
---
It really has nothing to do with level. You can run into a level 20 asshole or a level 200 asshole. 
---
An asshole is an asshole. Most of these players are either young or just really an asshole irl. The game doesn't change that. They get their kicks at the expense of others. 
---
Also possible to get them from workshops. I’ve got multiple copies from defenses.
---
I mean you can contact bethesda through their support page about a duper. Next time just witness it and don’t get yourself involved, rather contact Bethesda.
---

Plot twist: We become the raiders who take over the Pitt.

With my luck I'll just become a Trog.

I’m not sure about the price but if you’re desperate for Grahm there are two random encounter spots that he does have a chance to spawn. Which is walking down the road from Janet’s ice cream place and walking from the Charleston train station across the orange bridge and walking back to the shack next to the station.
---
It's 12pm here in the uk
---
Lower level players can't grief as much as high ones can. Sure a level 7 can punch you and try to fight you, but he's not going to have access to the same gear as the level 100+ troll who can 1shot you through slap damage with his 2 shot explosive gauss
---
It’s 1:08am here in nz lol
---
Ye, when you get high enough lvl its hard to find stuff to do, now a days I just do my vendor trip to get caps, and jump around to places hunting for legendary mobs, after my round I normaly check if I can find any low lvl players on the map that I can visit to give recon rifles, ammo and stimpacks, I normaly get out of my PA before reaching them so they dont get spooked.  
---
I have found that its aboute 50/50 who runs away and who stays long enough for me to drop stuff for them :D  
---
I do wish there was better emotes in the game for stuff like this, hell I would even be happy with just one emote, that displays a present/gift, just to make it clear what I am doing.  
---
So if you see me ingame (PC) dont be scared, I am 100% pve, and just wanna help people have a fun time if I can.
---
Same username as in here, lvl 190+
---
Do you have any more witch costume plans?
---
You can contact the National Authority Regarding Cheating.
---
Gave you a follow on twitch :)
---
Well I’m in NA so it’s it’s 7:10 am for me and my atomic shop gets new things either 10 am or 7 pm for me then apply it for your times. 
---
Southeast part of the map, not very common but seen about 4 of them.
---
NARC!
---
You can jump 10 feet in the air with marsupial and still remain hidden. Seems legit.
---
Everything that we can sell to other players already I’d imagine 
---
New atomic shop items go live at 12am for the UK at least they used to. Haven’t played for about a month so idk if they changed the timings.
---
Drop your camp on a Junk pile. Very useful. There are several on the river bank going north from the food processing plant. 
---
I am assuming there will be no limits as far as that goes. I am just guessing but it sounds like it is going to function as a second stash box of sorts. You put in it what you want to sell, and set the price that you would sell it at. I also hope they include a way for you to select items you are wishing to buy and what price you would be willing to spend. So if someone visits your vendor, they can earn some caps themselves if they have what you want.
---
You bought stimpaks with caps? Damn dude. Just take over and defend workshops for a few hours. You get stimpaks (almost) every time you clear each quest. 
---
Everytime someone says it their bday it reminds me of this. Happy Birthday
---

---
I’ll buy marsupial and adrenal if you have them 
---
Standard first two workshops for me are Charleston &amp; Hemlock. After that, it is dependent on my other mat or team needs. 
---
i love how he looks!
---
Very well done!
---
Thats if you are in a nuke zone, which I couldnt care less about until they actually put good drops in there. And then I would just be using my power armor that is just collecting dust in my stash. In my eyes, rad suits are just as useless because you cant wear armor over them. Outside of a nuke zone, you just have those random locations of barrel piles or getting hit by a ghoul. Would be nice to actually have the items that say they give me rad resistance do just that. 
---
Roll top desks facing the bartender. Looks the excite right height for bellying up to the bar. My teammate made an excellent looking bar with about 6 lined up. 
---
Thanks for the feedback. Your idea for a wishlist is great I'd definitely use that!
---
I collect low lvl legendary armor and weapons for this exact reason. It's fun.
---
Happens to me occasionally at the Fast Travel point to Watoga Station, Harper's Ferry, the Service Entrance to the Enclave Bunker, and occasionally on my first time logging in for the night if I log out at my CAMP.
---
I'm pretty sure it's related to how much crap the game is loading, and when it allows you to move, and that Front Entrance to Whitespring Resort just has a ton of crap.
---
If you open up your Pip Boy during that "pre-load allowed movement", I'm also fairly certain that is when it locks up the controls and you have to restart.
---
 Not very much I think in a price range of 100-500 caps depending on the person. You can find them on Graham or workshop defenses. 
---
I only just started taking workshops again. I find most of them to be rather boring, and I feel like I can scrounge better results faster on foot. Now I take them mostly for plan drops, but acid is kind of a pain so I'm definitely giving that one a go tonight.
---
Pretty soon in Survival everyone could be considered Wanted
---
Nearly missed that Nuke in the background! That's class, like catching a lightning strike.
---
I definitely think it’s a great idea
---
I made a video on that, you can actually get over 300 wood with woodchuck perk on
---
Plan drops from multiple defense events, plus power core mining for caps. 
---
And I still haven’t made it to the Institute on FO4, even though I pre-ordered it, because I have been too wrapped up in the settlement aspect of the game, so I am probably not typical. 
---
Most of the items are ludicrously priced.
---
Same i am still not convinced 
---
I think they are all event outfits of forest events 
---
Ok
---
This is not a single player game... 
---
Toxic Valley and Forest 
---
I've been walking around  with 30+ unused level points for a few weeks lol
---
You could have just fast traveled out 
---
I do Leader of the Pack all the time for this purpose 
---
I actually farm low level legendaries to give to low level players. There are good players out there but there is a good bit of griefers too. 
---
My new  character was griefed and killed by several higher level players. I'm talking there were 70s and I was 5. So u have a good intentions to be cautious 
---
you can kill it with vats. 
---
By the time you load and walk into Whitesprings the mobs are usually dead. Hence why you hear turret fire as you approach Whitespring...
---
Nice pic!
---
Fortunately Bethesda has a product for you. It's called Fallout 4.
---
How about legendary scortchbeasts in general? Gimme 3 star bigboys. 
---
Less damage than serrated mod, normally.
---
I think it's a 1.5x modifier, and it's additive with Ninja. 
---
Why a straw hat is 500 and a red sun hat is 300 makes no sense!
---
I do like where you going with this but, a lot of people out there including myself shoot down every cargo bot we see. 
---
So something in its design would have to keep this from happening maybe gaining a wanted level but then again we'd have to be able differentiate between workshop cargo and keycard cargo.
---
I don’t understand what you are saying. Who should kite them? One on one fave time with the turrets? Why do you need to kite them to a turret? Properly placing your camp requires no kiting.
---
You're not wrong. I play on xbox and we have more dupers, greifers and exploiters than both other platforms combined. The level of dirt baggery is too high here. Honestly i could see bethesda saying "weve identified a method to remove 90% of the greifers and exploiters, xbox support will be abandoned"
---
When was megaton founded 
---
I could buy a straw hat irl for less lmao
---
Destroy a players base while they have a bounty and you won't get one yourself. 
---
I’m guessing it’s going to be like the flatwoods monster terminal entries and just be a dead end. bethesda seems scared to actually put something in the game that some people won’t find.
---
If Bethesda releases an expansion that's the Fallout 3 map I will buy all the shitty pink beds off the atom shop in a heart beat.
---
You put 259 hours into a game in modern day gaming that means your addicted because most games only last a week or a day
---
What happens if you get a bounty but you don't have any money?
---
The Institute would like a word with you.
---
Also happens outside of power armor sometimes. And it used to happen in Fallout 4 too (with speed reload perks). 
---
killing  s**corchbeasts** just borring and nothing else... 
---
Happy birthday! 🎈

---
You can usually avoid other players solo pretty easily traveling in a group you get seen more 
---
I don't understtand this post. With 2 more levels you would have the exact same damage output as him with the same weapon. Sure, he may have his perks set up a little more structured, having more time to get multiple cards and tweak but its not like lv 200 is 4x better than lv 50. Both of you have the same damage potential after lv 50. Also, how did he kill you so fast without you being engaged in PVP? You should be getting slap damage unless you retaliate. All I'm saying is him being a drastically high level has nothing to do with his damage output, so that fact is irrelevant. Just wanted to point that out.
---
I feel like this generation of gamers is entitled and demand something new but keep it the same and if you change something they go fully mad 
---
PS4 actually but I am looking into upgrading my PC soon so thanks for the heads up!
---
I think it's 20hrs after you clear that factions caps
---
Even when taking into account that you can earn atoms through gameplay, the prices are still nuts.
---
I'm doing forest events for a couple of weeks now,to the point that i can level daily in the 190s just from them. No sign of vtu jacket yet.
---
I read somewhere that it’s 20 hours after you first sell them something.   I’ve not personally confirmed this.
---
As far as I know they reset 20 hours after your first transaction. 
---
ahh thank you, I have never heard that I hate those buggers!
---
I found a decent trick for trying to build where there isn't a ground, and it requires at least 1 foundation somewhere and 2 sets of stairs. You may have to do some planning, and this MAY not work for you, but it helped me ALOT. 
---
I would put a foundation on solid ground near where you want your camp built, put a set of metal stairs up, some wooden floors at the top of them, then another set of metal stairs down, and build floors on the bottom of them. ***It's hard to explain, but try it, and you will see what I mean.***. at the bottom of that second set of stairs, you'll be able to build floors over a cliff, on water, and anywhere else that you cant place a foundation. You are essentially creating a floating camp, with only 1 grounding point. You can **sometimes** delete one set of stairs afterwards, if they don't work for your build. 
---
As a higher level player that spends way too much time helping lower level players, thank you for giving peace a chance and not just running away. We’re here to help! And when you get up there in levels, return the favor for a newbie. 
---
Honestly, I’ll take any sort of improved drop for Scorchbeasts. They’re not worth the time and ammo for how poor their drops and XP are.
---
Maybe they ignore your reports because they are important.
---
Survival mode will be released 26th March
---
Bit of a stretch but okay xD 
---
I do! Unfortunately is going to be like another ten more hours until I can get online but I would be happy to give you them. Do you have the patience to wait that long?
---
I had this guy once give me a full suit of power armor with a power core i was so happy even though i don't use power armor much
---
I hope there is a communal area where everyone can set up a shop....it will be hard to know where these will be if they are not centrally located?
---
Happy birthday
---
This has happened other places as well. I think it was the red rocket? I was attacked by a giant spider or something?? What ever it was caused the video to bug and all you saw were these giant tentacles coming out of the ground that moved all over the place and you could not target them to shoot it and kill it. 
---
Saved post
---
That's been a bug since Beta. I got the "Wolf Pack" Event during the beta, and the very last pack meant with the big Alpha had one of these bugged guys I could **not** kill. Had to run away until another player who could actually target it killed it and finished the event.
---
If you rack up a bounty and you're broke you'll get a damage debuff and that's it.
---
Broke ass griefers piss me off. 
---
Well, there are no PEOPLE to protect.
---
Every once in a while I find myself thinking “you know what would be cool? If we had a real horde of spawns descending on a town or something ... masses and masses swarming ... “ and then remember “oh the towns are all empty ... never mind”.
---
That’s the function the robots serve.
---
It would be nice to have a reason to care about a horde of things swarming and killing stuff, but I can’t rightly get my head behind “protect the robots” the same way.
---
Isn’t that what the clones are for?
---
I've been trying to get the Mr. Fuzzy mask and have been able to get those dailys to start by being certain locations, widows perch and big bend west entrance. I'm not sure if all dailys can be started based on location.

Of course! Thanks 🙏

---
Fair call man, to each their own. Personally I'm still finding fun things to do after having a lv110 and a lv 90.
---
Also if you are interested in new content you should give a read of the roadmap they put up. Lost of new stuff coming soon.
---
One of the last times I played which is part of the reason I stopped was that me and my friend were out hunting down all kinds of things and ran into two mirelurk queens and king two super mutants  and a scorchbeast showed up. None of them took any damage or it regenerated instantly when we attacked. They chased us for what seemed like forever until we changed servers and were able to kill things again until they too took no damage.
---
I’ve had them drop at the AWOL armaments event at the Robco facility. 
---
Ah ok thanks for the answers everyone
---
His name is long dog. Show some fucking respect
---
you sure told them
---
That's how i collect them too. I have 7 now and i am waiting for the last one to drop from a magazine and finish the challenge :)
---
it helps a lot to equip the perception perk card for the magazines. It makes a blip+sound from pages turning.
---
13% now. It was 14% when I posted the link.   
---
Yep. 1.3 people out of 10 recommends Anthem. So much better than fallout's 0.7 people out of 10.
---
Huh. Good idea.
---
Xbox is filled with derelicts. Had a random person message me telling me they were lvl 323 and they could give me free stuff. I said no thank you. They weren't happy and decided to spout some hurtful things over the in game chat. I just blocked them and moved on. 
---
My idea is that the cargobot doesn't actually fly around. When it takes off from the base it just fly's straight up, getting smaller and smaller till it disappears. That way you wont have to worry about other player's shooting it down. 
---
Pretty sure the trigger is having 100,000 of any item. So if you did not exceed this then your fine. 
---
I always eat the spoiled food and rarely get a disease 
---
I never said there was a 'quick trade' button. We had discussed what to trade and for how much beforehand, he offered them up fairly fast, and I accepted. It was two weapons. I didn't think it would be that unbelievable it could discredit my whole story. 
---
This, I’ve times it and its this. For example, when I turn it on before work tomorrow I can do the raiders and harpers ferry, everyone has to wait till after work to reload for some dumb reason
---
They drop on them sometimes as loot too.
---
Thanks for the fast reply, will check it later :)
---
I have a cousin with that same name 
---
I Craft a batch of Level 1 &amp; level 5 Leather armor &amp; BOS Recon rifles every couple of days, and make it a point to hand out at least one set each time I'm on (everyday), sometimes it's difficult to give stuff away because the low level players "Run! Run Away!"
---
I also drop Aid (mostly Diluted Stimpaks) for players up to around level 25, and happily accompany other players to events like Uranium Fever, it's surprising how many level 50+ players haven't done many of the events, just because they don't know what's required, or that they can get good rewards from them.
---
I want the abraxo paint job back
---
I killed several Mr. Handies, but still no luck :/
---
I'm afraid I'm going to have to call shenanigans. I'm actually on XB, and I don't see it. I've encountered exactly **1** griefer in my entire time playing. No dupers, no 1 hit killers, no jagoffs. 99% of the people I meet are cool, just playing the game (even the workshop PvP'ers).
---
From what I remember, they said it's just a different type of server. So you choose a character then choose if you want the normal server or the PvP server when you come on. If you don't like it then just go to the menu and join a normal server with the same character.
---
Don’t be afraid to accept team invites. A lot of times people just want to max their perks. I learned way too late and now that I really need a team for perks, I have a hard time getting anyone to accept. It’s not that I want to actually play with them. 
---
Are you Xbox? I have 8 
---
Thanks for sharing! :)
---
I'd prefer just numbering them, since I enjoy mixing and matching different pieces on one frame for Aesthetics™
---
same
---
Definitely. Those levels were a grind. 
---
I second awol. I think I got 3-5 from mr handys during that event one time. Lol I probably threw them away
---
I get where you are coming from but it just feels like it makes it to easy. It's all ready fairly simple as you can fast travel there for free. And you often have to go to it anyway to defend it.
---
I jave noticed that  2 but i mean things like uncle leo the freindly supermutant,the radroach king you would have sttlers strapped with explosives run up 2 you and ask 4 help there was so much activity in the DC waste land . I get that its because its multiplayer i just miss the way that game felt like the world around you was alive and the npcs had some sort of life to them 
---
So does Med-X not stack with psychobuff?

Hmmm, so obviously it's Keyboard Curmudgeon.  Lighten F up, you way too self serious crybaby. You pick one word to get bent about out of what clearly a humorous riff on your pre-emptive perjorative Keyboard Cowboy labeling as an attempt to downplay any who dare think you were being a way too self serious crybaby when you being a way too self serious crybaby. Got Dan, but you must be a hoot and holler in social circles.

I've gotten the buzz blade as drops twice in the last week or so.  Once was outside

2800 caps is only 2 days of farming and selling. Go to the asylum and pick up every straight jacket you can find (there are about 20) - that’s about 1000 caps. Pick up all the junk too  especially all the white enamel buckets because they contain plastic and you’ll need plastic to bulk all the scrap you picked up to sell it. Then walk south to Big Bend Tunnel East and clear the place out - getting a dozen weapons to sell. Waddle (you’re overloaded) east along the train tracks to Watoga, stopping to kill the Super Mutants or whatever at the train yard along the way. Don’t forget to pick up the plan sitting on the table. Also search the train car on the tracks between there and the station for two weapons and a plan. 
---
When you get to Watoga, sort by weight and sell the weapons. 
---
Major/Colonel Gutsies drop them often in my experience, regardless of location/region. 
---
I’m planning on selling things cheaper than the vendors. Sometimes the vendors prices for things is a bit much 
---
Now that's a very viable idea.
---
How exactly does one export photos from fallout 76?
---
Not at all, this is a feature. Why should you get free resources delivered into your lap with no risk, fully automated and for free? I see zero issue with players being able to shoot down the cargo bot and get your resources. Taking player resources should carry the same consequences as taking them elsewhere in the game though ie. applies wanted status. Also, the name of the cargo bot could just be the player's name, like "Kindredlife's Cargobot" to denote that a cargo bot is carrying player resources.
---
Maybe you should try praising the Lord and passing the ammunition more often.
---
Ah, man. I am on PC. Sorry buddy.
---
You and me both but I'm not counting on it. There's a fire hose of feedback BGS has to manage, and this one is not consistently reproducible nor has everyone experienced it. Prioritization risk - its not the frequency or scope of occurrence, but the severity of the impact. I hope BGS mgmt considers this when stacking up fixes and dates.
---
I'd remove 3 points from luck.and put it in endurance to get adamantium skeleton, and replace something in luck with class freak and have all the mutations 
---
Looks like star wars 
---
that seems a little rewardy with out any risk
---
Thanks for the offer, but I'm on PC
---
Hasn't worked for me either. It kept sending me to same world. I had to manually leave world and join another for it to switch.
---
Maybe there's something near the charleston station spawn point. I've always wondered why one appears there, but never checked the area.
---
Welp, a bunch of mutants are shooting me... Seems like a good time to have a nice long sit down.
---
I managed to get it to work in the end, but it took several tries :/ 
---
I would love to see Richmond in Fallout. I live in Richmond so this would interest me greatly
---
I know. I invested, like you. And was blown away, as you.
---
They say that you never hear a song quite the same way after the first hearing. We play, feel, then replay, replay, and repeat. And something deep within us saddens a little. But this is not the song’s fault! It is our nature.
---
Is this my favorite game from the studio? Of course not. But Imagine how hard it must be, being Bethesda. If anything, I love and respect them even more for taking risks. And boy, what a risk!
---
Could you imagine if Valve had Bethesda’s spirit?
---
I find really good gifts are the brotherhood rifle and a heavy leather studded chest piece for new people as they are always helpful 
---
I stopped trying after probably 5 different times. Now I just do it manually if I need my camp.
---
ive had 1 one hit killer, 1 greifer at the base while building and 1 join your team just to destroy your base griefer. apart from that i had 2 dudes that wanted to play games at the excavator site and wherent knowing what was really under that croquet mallet skin
---
It’s a fine build! Recommended perks are Nerd Rage and Serendipity.
---
its almost as if, OP wants to take advantage of whitesprings farming, and is jealous the guy is doing it better
---
You should be getting one from HisNameIsVolte when I hop back in. See you later.
---
In my experience, after the initial defend mission, any recurring ones happen very infrequently to the point where you often DC or leave before it pops again. The biggest reason I thought of the cargobot was to stop players missing our on extractor hauls because of disconnecting. 
---
(xbox) I think ive got a spare one (that I bought before known plans, and well, I already learned it).
---
thats most likely what happen.
---
That's a fair shout tbh. Though u will say you are lucky, or I am dep3nding who you ask, defence things pop for me every 10-15 minutes and I have to stop what I'm doing and go then waste caps getting back. 
---
Oh yea, it’s major fun. What with the setting them up and the nice talk before, telling them what they want to hear and promising them all their desires. Then the buildup of excitement when you realize they’ve gotten to the point of trusting you and you know the scam is going to go through because they eat up everything you tell them. Then the rush after it’s done and they look at you expecting, followed by the realization in their tone or their silence of what just happened. It’s beautiful.
---
Sometimes I scam people who I don’t need anything from, I just do it to take. It’s terribly fun. Absolutely the most fun I’ve had in a game in a long while. I’d recommend it if you ever get the the point.
---
Sometimes the rush from the scam isn’t enough so I stick around after, tell them if they do as I tell them they can have their things back. Most everyone plays. They run around houses doing laps. They run timed races that they always are a second too late to make it in time for. They try and complete jumping puzzles. They do these things because I tell them to, because maybe if they do I will give their things back. “You have to give it back now! You said you would!” They say as I laugh, it’s terribly amusing.
---
As a perk of what I do I find myself with far too many legendary things to hold onto so lately if found myself tracking down randoms ingame and just giving things away, it’s a nice feeling, it almost compares but not quite.
---
I’m almost done collecting all the things. So close. I’m not sure what I will do once I’ve collected all the things, maybe I’ll stop, maybe not. To answer your question again, I’m a raider and yes I enjoy scamming people.
---
As I stated I myself shoot down every cargobot I see, it's just the scavver in me, but on the flipside I also like to see how others would implement this idea.
---
Your outlook does align with mine on this rest assured. But I do like to see how others think.
---
The copious amount of ceiling turrets can be a pain.
---
I’ve only done 2 nukes and have done them alone both times and it really wasn’t too bad. Just bring plenty of ammo and stimpacks and you should be good. Good luck!
---
Ok and?
---
That is actually a brilliant, yet simple idea. Now that you mention it (and the similarity to dragon souls) I can't believe it hasn't already been done.
---
except buildings dont load over the internet they are queued from disk and the only thing synced is your location
---
It's should be on the same wavelength as a water purifier or Brahmin pen. Gathering resources over time. You already have the workshop, why make the player have to constantly go back and forth. 
---
Thank you! I will!
---
Clearly 200 is greater than 50, so it was cray unfair! /s
---
Yeah when I did it with my friend he hacked the terminals and turned them off before we would go into a different room. Except for the ones in the hallways. I’ll have to remember to equip that 
---
Reread your response, we do agree. I read the "something in its design would have to keep this from happening" and was like whoa whoa whoa buddy, come on. Lol we're on the same page.
---
To each their own, and I understand not everyone is a Diehard FO fan, and there are many who want more PvP interaction, but it is a huge map with lots of (sometimes obscure) content.
---
My main Character is a little over 140, and there are still several events I haven't done, and a couple of unfinished quests.
---
If you're anywhere near level 50, my guess is that you have not yet explored the entire map, where you will trigger many more side quests, and events.
---
There are still many things buggy, glitched, or in need of improvement in the game, and I for one don't mind if they delay the introduction of new content if it helps get things fixed a little quicker, but either way, I am still enjoying the game immensely. 
---
His name is giraffe doggo and he's a stretchy boi
---
Would be pretty cool to see that. A lot of the armor in Fallout 3 and NV looked great but rarely got used because it wasn't as protective as stuff like power armor or combat armor.
---
Now that we have protective linings and power armor works differently, it would be quite nice to see some of those aesthetics return.
---
Except the Grafton Monster!
---
Afiak luck effects the durability level of items you pick up, not how often or how good they are. 
---
Always thought this could do with some animation or effect to show it's happening, and that it's supposed to happen.
---
Stealth is very helpful when solo, especially durimg the stage where you have to repair the reactor pipes within the time limit. Sneak bobblehead + stealth boys mean you can complete objectives without constant respawning enemies draining your ammo, depleting your health and breaking down your guns.
---
Turning the turrets against the robots can also be more helpful than simply deactivating, but bear in mind they can detect you easily when sneaking. 
---
A while ago before the change to venor inventory, I was serverhopping grafton looking for plans.
---
Realized nobody does grafton events, so each server hop I either got grafton day or protest march.
---
I didnt always finish the quests, but I would kill all the SMs so I could trade in peace, and sell all their weapons.
---
 They are lower level so they are easier to kill (but they dont have the best weapons.
---
Farming nuke zones for flora is definitely more efficient. I could clear all the vendor pools from selling nuked flora
---
I'd be interested to see what they'd do with it. It might be relatively intact since DC would be the real target in the area. 
---
Server hopping. For X-01 you can either buy from someone (I've got Headlamp bright, Jetpack, Targeting Hud and Stealth boy for sale, I'm on the PC) or server hop many, may times... 
---
Ugh. I was hoping that update they did a couple times back for vendor inventory predictability helped but alas that doesn't appear to be the case. Also...I'm on xb1 unfortunately or I'd hit you up. 
---
Yea its nuts, I've only been doing it for couple days. The chance is so low.
---
thanks!
---
yea think so
---
ive given up on the X-01. sure it looks cool. but the inability to find mod plans kind of ruined it for me. i switched to the T51B and never regretted it
---
I’ll keep that in mind. Thank you :)
---
That sucks, but the flooded look of the first floor would actually be sort of sweet if you could control it lol
---
Honestly though, this mechanic was never well fleshed out and in FO4, and still isn't in 76.  The idea is they are mutating and gaining additional abilities, but frankly it just seems like a silly mechanic that annoys the player and is prone to be interpreted as a bug.
---
It either needs updated to have a more obvious and engaging visual aspect to it or just removed and legionaries given more base health.
---
Yeah that would be pretty rad. 
---
The X01 mods do constantly change from server to server, day to day etc but some are more rare than others. I usually see 3 mods when I pop in and the headlamp is quite common, I’ve never seen the jet pack and only ever seen 1 set of calibrated shocks but I’ve seen the medic pump, stealth boy, recon sensors and vats matrix overlay a few times.
---
I may be there with you at some point. I'm going to see how insane this drives me first.
---
It always seems to break "last weapon" / dpad left (I dont know pc) if I had a fist weapon on before I got in PA.
---
Fist weapon unequips like it should getting in PA. but from then on no matter how many weapons I equip manually, it will not let me swap back.
---
After last patch it's even worse - the most sought ones (Jetpack, calibrated shocks) are even more rare. With all other PAs you have an option to buy a plan for mods from vendors, but X-01 you can't.
---
I agree. I was disappointed when somebody called me by my gamertag. I'm Baddie Mcbad, dammit.
---
alternatively, the T60 is super cheap to repair. it may be a good power armor choice
---
I found an undetonated atomic warhead as a random encounter and cutting the correct wire disarms it and lets you loot some rare scrap. Cut the wrong one and it will beep letting you know to get the hell out of dodge! I like taking a photo next to it while in full BoS uniform :-)
---
I’m only a level 41 but I still try to help out whoever I can. I still get the occasional griever but not as much as I used too. Love when I have good experiences with higher levels! 
---
"everyone wanted X" or "everyone said X" is generally a figure of speech. An obvious exaggeration. Otherwise it wouldn't make sense if it wasn't as the majority of earth probably isn't aware of Fallout.
---
When did I say I'm not enjoying fallout 76. I can almost guarantee that I've played it more than you and will get more hours out of it than you in the end. I just play it like a MMO-Lite. Because it is. That's literally what it's meant to be. 
---
I generally play fallout games with minimal UI, while roleplaying a character, and avoiding immersion breaking things like fast traveling. It's easy to get caught up in the world and have your disbelief suspended. That's not the case with 76.
---
This is a "grind to get the good gear" kinda game. It always was. Infact, I see alot of the story and solo player components as the weak parts of this game. And ofcourse in past fallout games those parts were my favorite. 
---
Eventually you find yourself tossing shit out just to free up room in your stash, finding someone to give stuff to just makes me feel better about picking up so much junk to begin with...
---
Thank you so much!  Definitely was not my goal by posting but very appreciative!  I really hope this community stays as great as it is.  I love seeing people help one another!  Have a great day!
---
I usual give out “starter packs” to new or low level players. 5 stimpacks, 5, radaway, 5 rad x, 5 purified water, disease cure, treated underarmour,  a levelled weapon I’ve fully upgraded and a pile of ammo. I only encourage them to pay it forward some day. 
---
Are they really though? I mean I've got 8k saved up even after I've spent 4k. Besides the upcoming clean stairs, and apocalypse power armor skins I don't think I'm going to spend them on anything else. Everything that I really wanted was free, and it seems like it will be free to me. 
---
What TZ are you in? I'm in GMT.
---
Same i posted a pic on here b4 its little things like this that make fallout so good
---
It doesn't even farm them in the sense that if the owner of the turret camp isn't there to get a shot in they're not getting experience or loot from the ghouls.
---
I just equip the Wrecking Ball perk and go to town anytime I see turret camps at Whitesprings.
---
Im not sure, but at The emmet disposal site (short distance west from west tek):
---
At the end of one leg of the mine, there are a couple broken barrels with a bunch of super mutant body parts spilling out. 
---
I think there is a terminal entry referencing them disposing of their failed test subjects.
---
Theres also the grafton monster thats also down in charleston, on the train tracks. I didnt notice a cage broken there, but I also wasnt looking. Im guessing they transported it by train
---
If i were implementing this, the vendor and yer stashbpx would both share the same stash limit, so u don't get an extra "stash". 
---
Sneak vats/crit is very viable. Shotguns are very strong as well. 
---
I have gotten diseased from spoiled vegetables with the Herbivore mutation.
---
Are you sure on that? I've never noticed a turret kill where I didn't get a hit in giving me loot, though I've honestly rarely build turrets. Most experience comes from taking a workshop where someone else already built some.
---
Ok thank you for clearing that up
---
Ditto. Also uranium fever drops low levels sometimes and you score tons of steel from miners weapons with scrapper for a win win. Hmu low lvls.
---
I am a stealth rifle build as well... and in my video of the tail end of this experience you see that I had to switch to my pickaxe to be able to kill and loot.
---
Here's to hoping the fix this..
---
I keep trying to help out low levels, everytime I come across a camp, I give them a wave and they log out while I'm picking out a care package from my pipboy 🙁
---
Saw a level 14 heading to powering up event, figured I'd help out and start running over.  He came running around a corner, pistol whipped me and ran like hell in the other direction
---
Would you guys consider granting the atoms to people when the game is bugged and stopping us from achieving them. It's happened multiple times, and even previous free mobile games I have played have awarded free game economy when they've made mistakes with their coding. I honestly ran out of content quite quickly and the only reason I get on daily is to complete the daily and weekly challenges which often don't work
---
Cant find the frame, or can't find the individual parts?
---
I've run across very few frames that didnt have both a fusion core and at least one of the pieces, although the piece(s) may be above your current level.
---
What level are you?  
---
Asking b/c just though exploring to level up, I  found the parts to complete a set of raider armor before L15, complete T45 and T51 before l25.
---
I'm l32 now, and have partial sets of t60 and x01...and separate frames for each level of armor.  (I have not done the mission for the excavator suit.)
---
Cant use PA all the time as it seems to eat cores without a couple of perks - IIRC, the perks that reduce power consumption come in around lvl 50.
---
There are several armor respawn sites in the Forest - you may find armor without power cores (people that already have frames may take the core and leave the suit).
---
To get cores, you can revisit armor spawn sites, a couple of challenges drop them as rewards, sometimes they are just laying around, sometime found in ammo boxes....or hit up a power plant. But I'm straying to another topic...
---
Ive never seen them. 
---
But if you think about it, raider armor is made from survivors pulling together whatever they could scrounging out in the wild.
---
I think it would be cool if you just automatically learned a plan after x number of hours for just living out in the wasteland (like the raiders before us). 
---
Ive got 14 intelligence, but I cant figure out how to cut a propane tank in half and use it as a helmet.
---
Nice.
---
Yeah mate they're all totally viable they just require more upkeep. I played the main quest line in the same way you want too but then I made the jump to PA/melee at the end just to cut down on my component grind.
---
 A [build like this](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/builds/sniper-shotgun-stealthy-boi/) sounds like it would be up your street.
---
I'd love a dense city area like the pit or dc ruins with lots of verticality. 
---
I'm level 23 and I've always found t45 t51 and t60 power armor in the farm run I do but lately I haven't been finding any frames in the places
---
Maybe no difference in base damage, but the lvl 200 has had 4 times the levels to accumulate gear, solid perk load outs, countless SBQ/legendary runs, and has been around long enough to benefit from the mass duping. Which directly, or indirectly, affects damage output, and damage resistances.
---
All of which, the lvl 48 would not have access to. 
---
Tank hunter.
---
AP and stagger (?) Instead. 
---
This is insta-healing that happens in addition to the planned 1 time 'mutating' healing effect that legendaries do.
---
Instead of a full heal, it is as if your damage is undone... In this video you can see both the insta-healing bug and the scripted full heal event in the same battle - [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/386603496](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/386603496)
---
I mix long range sniping with 1 rank 3 shotgunner ( for building breach and clear) perk it's a very viable build. Scrap every hunting rifle you can get your hands on from scorched and super mutants. And see you on the Filthy side!
---
I'm on PC, level 72, and saw my first SM screw drop just last night.
---
I just remove the targeting for the turrets and let them distract the robots. I only destroy turrets in rooms in which I need to remain stationary.
---
Any combat shotgun with a maxed out enforcer perk can make short work of robots. That's what I do.
---
500+ hours on xbox and my experience has been pretty much the same.
---
Yeah, I use the T-51b outside nuke zones, since it has the best non-rad defense, and use the T-60 inside nuke zones since it has the second best rad resist, easy to find mods, and cheap repairs. I'll buy the X-01 mods as I find them, but I'm not in a hurry. 
---
Cut him some slack, hes got a small oil pan, and a leaky drain valve.
---
Gotta take bathroom breaks every 5 minutes, and the closest toilet is the high school.
---
Multiplayer game.... You're not the center of the universe sunshine
---
Wow! Just Wow!!! Like the timing/luck needed for this!!!
---
If you want more pvp, then you should stop playing until March 26 pvp server's are up. If you want more quests then you should stop playing until April 9th or May 7th. If you want a new Main questline, then you need to wait until the Fall. The mayors questline in Watoga is decent, and you should do it, if you haven't.  
---
LMAO seriously? How do you clear it?
---
Wow, that looks exactly like something I'd want. Thanks!
---
Put your generator on the 2nd or 3rd floor.  In addition, the noise will be lower and they will not be drawn as much to it.
---
Had this same issue last night
---
Yeah. Someone today had left a full set of power armour outside of vault 76. Very cool. Can’t wait for player interaction to be better encouraged.
---
I'm sorry but this issue is not worth all caps. It's a minor inconvenience at worst. 
---
I had to afk at that station once when one of my kids woke up early. Not sure what happened, but when I came back I was dead and a group of high levels were milling around. First thought was WTF!? but there was only respawn option so a player didn't kill me, and all my bulk junk that I was there to sell was still in my baggie.
---
It's been my experience that most players are just looking to do their own thing and those that are looking to interact are more likely to help than harm. 
---
Try the logging camp East of the Sons of Dane Compound, it has so much!!!
---
LOL. The link you posted literally answers your question
---
I already gave it to some random player lol. Sorry man
---
Id be all for visiting post-apocalyptic Pittsburgh again
---
Battle Royale?
---
It was a high lvl gulper from a mire event. 
---
Workshops would've been used more if you didn't have to pay  caps to claim them
---
👆This☝️
---
See, I didn’t think of that and it makes sense.  However, would the items found in those buildings (enemies, junk, weapons, etc) affect severs?
---
Thats yo. Any insight and context is helpful. 
---
Long dogs are under environmental protection, you should get wanted for shooting those.
---
I do this occasionally myself. Still using the AA Gauss a 100+ dropped for me when I was almost 50. Been paying it forward ever since
---
Thank you for the suggestions. I’ll keep it in mind 
---
I have a problem. Lol. I compulsively pick them up. Even when I know I have enough. And I refuse to sell them. I think I may need to join a support group. Lol. 
---
No problem! There's probably much more suitable builds out there that was just the first one that popped when i googled.  
---
Have a play about with [this build planer](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1111111&amp;d=&amp;w=&amp;n=) to help you get an idea of how you want to level up your charachter, if you're that way inclined. I went in blind and just added things as i wanted them then respecced my misplaced points after level 50 :)
---
What scared me the most was the vault with the geck, that is material for nightmares.
---
No problem. 
---
Hope you're on XB. Bring caps and screws.
---
Better wear a helmet too.
---
Automatic is best for farming imo.
---
My character is a Stealth/Sniper build, I typically sneak through the Golf Club to kill all the ghouls, but the Turret Farms draw them out the back doors and kill them all before I can even get to them.
---
It's a Chicken Shit exploit that needs to be removed, and if Bethesda won't do it, then it's up to the Players, so for anyone interested, here is the Turret Farm removal process, Step by Step;
---
1. Remove all your caps, &amp; Junk (don't want the owner profiting from this)
---
2. Equip Wrecking ball Perk Card
---
3. Deploy Orbital Strike Beacons, Nuka Grenades, Artillery Strike, or whatever you can to inflict massive Damage.
---
4. Mop up any remaining CAMP items with a Drill (trust me on this one)
---
5. Server Hop, Rinse, Repeat.
---
If the owner returns &amp; kills you, seek revenge, and get some caps &amp; junk for your effort.
---
When i have extra stuff ill seek out low level characters to give it away to......its 50/50 if theyre extreemly gratefull or dont even want anything to do with me.     Sometime just getting the message across that im trying to help is half the battle!!  
---
  GT is my name here! Hit me up if u need a hand.....the 0 is a zero in high0utput
---
Wish there were more interactions like this for me on console. On XB1 any time my level 20 is invited to a group for a higher level player, I always ask why (they usually just say 'free fast travel/perk sharing/etc' which is fair), but 80% of the time my base just gets blown to smithereens within minutes of accepting the group invite.
---
Happy Birthday!
---
It should be, "reduces V.A.T.S cost per swing."
---
Road leathers with treated and or boiled....I think, leathers. Enjoy
---
Sad or not, it's their own right.
---
Just dropped for me on PC. Add me SurfaceNoice 
---
I'll give em to you.
---
There should not be an atom shop on a 60 dollar game with a 120 dollar special edition that is released in an early access beta state
---
If you want to spend 1800 atoms on a PA paint job, be my guest.
---
Yes. 3 bucks for a hat is crazy. More than 10 for a single skin for a power armor (not even a pack of skins) is grossly overpriced.
---
Just tell your kids to "grow up!"
---
Agreed with the comments. Most players i encounter are awesome and Willing to help and share.
---
Love the community guys!!!
---
I'm the enclave armory there are some pieces of paper lying around that tell you what plants turn into what flux when you nuke them. Check em out. 
---
Heck im level 50, i could do with that baggy
---
For some reason, yelling at a 2 year old to go the fuck to sleep, is frowned upon.
---
You replied earlier on Xbox, I was the one who bought the jetpack and shocks lol
---
Hard disagree on that one. I don't care if you are having fun. 
---
Question: If you do not want to engage in PvP why did you buy a product that has (and was marketed as) always having a form of PvP enabled?
---
A good mmo lite. Not a good traditional fallout.
---
Give it a shot. Pay less than 20$.
---
Going on a certain beta game and build a spaceship with my friends to land on a moon or alien planet? 
---
Did you want to pay extra for all that DLC content or let people who actually spend real money in the shop do it for you?
---
All pyramids were made to honor Mothman. That one had just awakened to its purpose.
---
Just as all moths are drawn to the light, so too will all pyramids be drawn to the embrace of the Mothman.
---
Todd disagrees with you, maybe don't buy his games if you don't like their design.
---
Also the metal helmet.
---
not always true in my experience - I've killed 68 LVL glowing super mutant (\*\*\* and crown) in NAR repair yard and he dropped \* AA Lever (just one star) - I was very disappointed. 
---
Not pushing it to be removed. I'm saying in a hardcore mode it shouldn't be present regardless.
---
Also it's way easier and time efficient to spend 5 minutes going to the right places for resources rather than not fast traveling ever.
---
They're cosmetic items. Makes it easier to suppress my OCD hoarding of everything if I know they're not in game naturally.
---
please don't look at me.
---
Level 48 has more of a chance versus 200 than you think. Hit points don't scale with level. Damage scales with gear and perks, and you have access to almost all of it (2 more levels, and you have just as many special, and all the same perks and gear as anyone else). The biggest difference is, if you kill him, hell lose (and you'll gain) 4x as many caps as if he killed you.
---
I have around 2900 atom.  There's nothing good to spend it on and you can earn enough in game to not have to buy any unless you want everything in the shop.
---
We can debate its existence,  but nobody needs to spend money there.
---
Eh... the cap cost isn't much unless there is a ton of stuff already built.  Fresh, no building cost, is barely more than the Cap reward you get for clearing the enemies outside the area.  A loss of 5-15 caps for a large chunk of exp, crafting items (like Ballistic Fiber for higher level areas) and random CAMP rewards seems well worth it.
---
The main deterrence is leaving yourself open for PVP.  But as a low level player I would just do the Clear Event, Claim Event, and then first Defend event (usually within minutes of claiming), reap the rewards, then server hop and do it again.  It filled out my CAMP Plans very quickly and helped me level up.
---
I rarely left myself open on a server with a claimed workshop, until I reached level 20 and used the Gorge Junkyard to farm up my Black Titanium required for the level 25 Excavator Armor. 
---
Oh good call, I always forget about that perk.
---
Can you.mod mine please?
---
I've observed recently that most horde events are broken - I fast travel to the place, see the "intro" animation and that's it - no markers, nothing on the active quest list - wasted caps...
---
But it's not really 3 bucks. 
---
You can earn that many atoms without even barely trying in like 2 half days. 
---
Bethesda has to take these free atoms into account when they look at the bottom line of actual real money they are making and have to use on...you know...keeping the lights on, giving their employees a paycheck, and giving us free dlc 
---
Nah, they just want some variety and some actions with more permanent consequences + choices in relation to NPC
---
I can often do this in less than 3 minutes..
---
I've had a few team invites from people who just saw that I was in a place they needed/wanted to go. Especially lower levels who haven't discovered a place yet. Free fast travel. 
---
I didn't realize Grafton, West Virginia also existed in Boston.
---
This 
---
Hurry up already!!!!
---
I suspect it will factor in item level as well as legendary effects. Doubt we'll be able to grind up lower level stuff and get a level 50 item.
---
I for one hope this never happens 3 is just fine.
---
I wish it were that easy to return to the server you were on but no. If you leave the game and return to the main menu, you'll get a new server when you join again.
---
I think items laying on the ground like desk fans and ballistic pouches don't respawn. But logs, flowers, and ore deposits do. Or maybe they just have a much higher respawn rate.
---
I saw a level 5 in the mountains relatively close to my base. It turns out this level 5 had a better base than me and was a mule for a much higher level player. I had intended on taking all of my known plans over to them, but soon realized they wouldn't be needing them. I ended up chatting with these guys for a little while. I love this damn community.
---
yeah, sure!
---
With that argument in mind: why not 4 dollars or 2? More importantly, why are they ignoring the more successful model of selling these things in packs? Grab a few things that are on-theme, mix new and reused assets, and sell them together to justify the price tag. 
---
Ow the edge
---
How this video didnt get more traction on this thred ... What the hell ?
---
This guy make so good points and hes true fan of the series. 
---
Or we join the BoS and Pillage it and leave it for dead.
---
Yeah I always do... just for the sake of maybe meeting some cool people to chill with. Free fast travel is a bonus.
---
Don’t let your level difference dishearten you, being level 48, depending on your build, you should have either incisor or tank killer for armor penetration. That for me has bridged the gap between me and high level griefers. There’s nothing like listening to the rage of a level 60 getting their ass handed to them by a low level. 
---
But anyway that’s not the point.
---
I do agree that if you don’t want to pvp then you shouldn’t have to.
---
I also think that unless you accept a pvp offer, then they should do 0 damage to you. 
---
I don’t get wtf Bethesda we’re thinking with that one.
---
I hate bullying, I love nothing more than griefing  griefers. 
---
I will go out of my way for it. 
---
I am the griefer griefer. Lol 
---
Took them 2 months to fix the lever rifle animation and you expect a NEW piece of MAP? 
---
yup, pretty sure every fifth gutsy i fight drops them. pretty sure i have an extra or two. I'm on PC and wont be on until this weekend but if you want one and can wait it's yours
---
I don't think they explode under the ground but have a very very tiny blast radius, like really tiny it's been reported many times.
---
It's funny that I tried to communicate free resources exactly the same way: using the pointing vault boy. On a side note: I thought you'd only be in pvp mode while in workshop area, but reading your comment makes me think that you're in pvp mode regardless?
---
I do it I made a couple friends out of it plus they might need reviving and that’s the only trophy I need
---
Are you on ps4?
---
No, never do. Too many bad experiences with high level players. 
---
That is true it is possible. I do it all the time. I just would prefer not be to alone for the first 10 minutes of the fight. 
---
I still solo all the enemies at drop site v9 before the nuke drops. Repair my weapons and Armor at the workbenches like 50 meters away in the Glassed Cavern exit.
---
I used to solo the Queen and all that before the most recent patch. 
---
Now that she is "harder". It's not a 1 man job to kill the Queen. So every second matters, at least to me. 
---
Also remember there is 3 platforms and a wide range of audiences that play Fallout 76. Not everyone is as prepared to fight the Queen as us Min/Max'd players. Some people may be over-cumbered in a field and still want to participate. 
---
There's about 60 drop locations for power armor (though a lot of that is raider-level stuff, which you'll outgrow fast) from what I've seen, though any of those may be picked over before you get to them.
---
Black powder IS NOT silent lol! Nothing screams "here I am assholes!" Louder than the report off that bad boy. However your initial target prob won't hear it. So there is that. 
---
If you have assasins sentinel gear on then you take 0 damage while standing still. Even if they jump as long as they don’t move too much they are immortal. Some grade A bs I think.
---
Not a PC player so forgive me if I get any terminology incorrect haha. From what ive read on here I believe the issue is to do with mods or changes you have made to the INI file. 
---
Same here.  Except I’m a hoarder so I used to keep around 100.  But it always just floated there without me even paying attention.   Now all the sudden I’m breaking 2 on lvl1 locks. Lvl3 locks take like 5... and I just actually noticed that I only have like 10 in inventory.   Wtf is happening?!
---
First off, its a great idea, Id really love to see it suggested as something beth really takes and goes yeah this totally works we need to add that. 
---
The main issue is the balance between Risk-Vs-Reward, you're basically asking for more reward but where is the added risk? "well it can get shot down but you get double loot if you fix it" This isn't a risk but instead something you would hope happens for the reward.  (really easy fix right here even with the disappearing bot routine is to just make this something people could lock pick, flag them wanted same as a us supply drop(which currently flag anyone that picks a container not owned by them), make it require random items to repair with the option for the owner to just unload it and have to lug it back to camp) 
---
Since im pretty sure the rebuttal will be i dont like pvp, it could just simply go missing according to chance, It could require materials that are randomized every time, it could blow up after x minutes if not repaired, it could attract assault trons or mr gutsy's *&lt;-- again inherent risk of using the reward mechanic* 
---
Games are about Risk Vs Reward, with reward there needs to be some risk, other wise the game just becomes a movie or, at best, a theme park ride. We end up with something that focuses on the non-interactive parts of the experience but rather than on the interactive element that is the core of the ‘game’.  
---
 Giving a player the choice to play it safe for a low reward, or to take a  risk for a big reward is part of game design. A candy cargo bot isnt just about the player that filled it but the players that might wanted to chase after it. 
---
Ideally if they are adding PvP servers they should turn the adventure servers into pve ones, they wont but if they did turn them into full blown pve servers then the damage mitigation would take care of shooting drones out of the sky, if they removed lock picking from said hypothetical pve server then that would also prevent lock picking on above counter suggestion. 
---
yeah, i did a post yesterday in the trading subs if you need more info!
---
Dark Souls style “notes” would be fucking sweet.
---
I have never seen one or one for trade. I don’t believe they exist. 
---
+Karma
---
A E S T H E T I C 
---
I am a fellow radium rifle weirdo, and will pay well for your time. Really appreciate it!
---
Also I have had the SBQ corpse flat out disappear after we killed her. My friends tell me if I'm there when she spawns it won't happen.
---
I server hopped for a while but never found any X-01 Jetpack or Calibrated Shocks.  When I thought about how much time I was doing an activity I didn't enjoy, I just bought them off of another player.  Life is too short to server hop for days on end.
---
I still check that vendor for the mods every time I'm on a run for caps.  I have never seen them for sale there.
---
Wait till Wild Appalachia starts.
---
\^This! Please let us do this!
---
Better yet, a portable tripod mounted at the bottom of heavy weapons.
---
I used to send random invite to people so we can share perks and free fast travel point. And sometimes play with them if we're in the same area. But almost no one accepted it so i stoped.
---
Yeah I noticed a different explosion yesterday fighting the queen that was the size of the regular nuka mine. 🤔 
---
Does he know a guy named Andy Bell as well?
---
Yes, the items are what affect servers the most i think. 
---
Seriously tho. I found a pipe bolt action modded into a rifle with a silencer packed with all the rifleman and gunslinger perks u can squeeze into your build to be very effective. (Benefits from both 😉 at least for now) 
---
On that note...if anyone reading this on xb1, I'm in the market for x01 calibrated shocks. PM me here.
---
So basically post apocalyptic Amazon delivery drones...I like this idea
---
Lever action for fairly high damage and fire speed.
---
I also like the refined .50 reciever on the hunting rifle. 3× ammo production with the .50 for a 2 pt dmg  reduction againt the hardened .308.
---
I haven't played around with the gauss yet, mainly because I don't want to carry energy ammo.
---
for example?
---
If you do the "Mayor for a day" quest, you get a key to a safe that has 10 stimpaks, and you can keep server hopping and unlocking the safe for more stimpaks.
---
I’d walk all the way to the bethesda offices and fellate every dev in sight 
---
That's not true. I've had my crew already in the bog waiting while 1 of my team-mates is in the Silo trying to launch. 
---
She sometimes turns into a meat pile straight away or just straight up falls through the world and nobody gets loot. I'm pretty sure i've seen every enemy in game at least once, fall through the world seconds after it died and you get no loot. 
---
It sucks when it happens. Worse when you crash/bluescreen and she's at &gt;5% hp. 
---
Haha.
---
I only did it once and it was alone.
---
Just bring lots of ammo and stimpacks.
---
This was patched out.
---
Happy birthday bruther.
---
Eh, only real difference between Hunting and Sniper rifles is the barrel type (and scope).
---
I found a .50 hunting rifle last night and I see it says it is supposed to get some some advantage for vats criticals.  I just crafted ammo for it this morning, will try it out later this evening.
---
My first encounter with a good guy, I did not even realize the house I was in was his camp.  It was early days playing and still exploring around the vault. Nor was I on reddit to learn of all the fancy camps possible. Fortunately he had a mic. so I understood he wanted me to stay and give me something.   I managed a heart emote for the bag of goodies.  
---
Oh the irony. 
---
Amazing write-up, shame I'm on pc though. Would have loved to create some sort of hilarous complementing characters.
---
 
---
Most I can suggest is using the recipe.
---
Upvoted for degree of difficulty. Nice work, great image
---
We'll find out on April 9th when player vending goes live:

---
I would assume that you would be able to sell anything that is not flagged as a quest item.
---
Found them both on Mr. gusty
---
Flatwoods.
---
Two medkits at the church.  One in each of the silos near the ag center.  Plus you can get some by doing the event.
---
And where would I gather the bloodpacks?
---
once a year seems resonable that they would recycle.
---
I have no turrets and I'm outside of the golf course itself. It would be incredibly easy for me to just world hop and put a similar building down where he did, you know. Your argument is silly and shows your salt 
---
Morgantown Airport (outside, in the tents area) with pharmafarmer is good for 15-20 stims a day.
---
LOL yes it makes a distinctive sound that echos.  I probably should has listed the gauss rifle instead of that one. I also forgot pipe rifles.
---
Why I quit playing till everything is maybe fixed in a year or more if I still care by then.
---
How long does stuff you transfer or drop hang around?
---
They've done this for a while.
---
I always thought it was a tongue-in-cheek joke... Loose Screws.
---
You can do more than one vendors per days?
---
Absolutely, surely this wouldn't be hard to implement, given that mods are already an in-game items. Surely just a new list of 'plans' and an extra option on the weapons bench/a new crafting station.
---
Yes we know, we know. $60 is far too much to pay for a game worth hundreds of hours of playtime which will get completely free updates into the foreseeable future. And adding a voluntary shop where you can buy purely cosmetic items? How DARE they try to make their video game profitable!
---
There's a good chance I may have found some of your stuff. Do you remember dropping a hunters legendary LMG because that thing was in my stash for 16 levels and I just traded it to get my self a full set of marine armor and a good shotgun.
---
Yup, the jump thing seems like an obvious bug to patch out. Also how the DR stacks would probably be better if revamped.
---
Yea. The question is which of the 365 days will it be.
---
If your on pc, I can repair it for you
---
Enjoy your cake!!! The overseer will be along shortly to give you a Pipboy. 
---
Imagine the server hopping necessary to find a server with a free spot for you and your friends...
---
If you get even Rank 2 Pharma Farma in Luck, you'll have plenty of Stimpacks.
---
Doing the random Events also tends to yield 3-5 of them and the Grafton ones, in particular, are trivial to complete.
---
Do low level events (so you don't need to use them to stay alive).
---
Grab public workshops and do the "defend" events.  
---
Use the Pharma Farma perk and play a couple of sessions and you will be over-flowing with stimpacks.  
---
One you have many stimpacks, you can use the Chemist perk and super duper (I think) to convert them to dilluted stimpacks  
---
Or you can craft them (I don't know where the recipe/plan is) with the super duper perk.
---
I know what you asked but no one will have the answere for u.
---
I had a lvl 87 one shot me and I was a lvl 120 and I didnt engage in PvP at all. I was just minding my business and chameleon wearing melee build boom one shot me lol it is what it is. Part of this game is PvP soooooo you just got to be ready for people killing you for your stuff. I do think that places like inside whitesprings or nuke zones etc. Should be a neutral area no pvp....
---
You can make blood packs from ticks blood that is of course you have the recipe to make blood packs. That’s how I do it or get the perk card for pharma farma which can give a small chance at finding extra chems or healing in aid kits 
---
I have my camp within artillery range of the back of the golf club.   I keep a generator and 3 artillery in storage with the idea that I will rebuild/deploy  them as necessary.  So far I haven’t had a good opportunity to use it.  But it will be awesome when I do.....
---
Play now, get leveled up you should be good enough when the new content is released.
---
Gauss feels.... Off. I loved em in fo4 but this game they feel odd. and idk about the dmg either shows a healthy amount on weapon stats but it doesn't seem to translate into fights. 
---
I hope it's "everything".
---
I kinda wanna open a restaurant.
---
I’ll gladly take Marsupial off you.
---
My husband has a 2* switchblade he calls Mr. Stabby. Ghoul slayer and 40% faster, he uses it with his T-51b PA... it's hilarious 
---
I want a set of assasins sentinel for the sole purpose of griefing griefers. 
---
Suppressed gauss...extra kick ass with sandman and covert ops...i use TSE for this but a basic gauss with rifle perk cards and above leaves a bit of a sting.
---
I'm saying it's not 3 bucks for a hat. It's zero bucks. It's zero bucks for a skin of power armor. The rate at which they come out with quality things that I actually want, is far lower than the free atoms they give away for the daily and weekly challenges. 
---
I guess you could make it unavailable if you’re in combat, and then you can’t initiate PvP for 30 seconds after you come back. That way you can’t get out of fights with it and you can’t use it to surprise attack. 
---
Sorry for the confusion, i knew that you understood the question. And your probably right, it comes around when it does and thats that.
---
I would like this. It’s not just prepare, but go to the bathroom, let the dog out, or go grab a beer. Just give us a minute after doing the silo:
---
I ran into one of these in Ash Heap that was able to bite me clear over the top of railroad cars.  Land mines eventually did the trick like they always do.
---
This issue occured previously linked to a mod. Well, specifically it was linking to the falloutcustom.ini being improperly setup from a copy/paste off the nexus mods site.
---
Thank you.  Very helpful.  But a couple things still confuse me:
---
1) I have a combat armor chest piece that is upgrade from “standard” to “reenforced”.  According to this link there should standard, sturdy and heavy.  Where does reenforced come in?  And can you upgrade to sturdy or heavy from standard?  Or are they completely separate?
---
2) what is the BOS prefix mean?  And how do you get it? 
---
Sounds like they bought a bunch of OP gear when it was cheaply available.  It makes a huge difference.
---
I mean, it’s not perfect, but it’s at least a step up. If there was a town in every region that’d make 36 possible rental lots on every server, so real estate already outnumbers players and not all players would opt to live in town, so I really don’t think it’d be a huge issue. To be safe a group may prefer to grab lots at the Toxic Valley or Ash Heap towns since they’d probably be in lesser demand. 
---
Meh. I do NOT miss the endless green monochrome expanse. 
---
I was just saying to my buddy that what I enjoy most about Appalachia is the fact it has *COLOUR*. 
---
Neither are you. 
---
Do You use silenced weapon so they cant track You? AI will direct them in line where You made a shot, so after You shoot move to left or right avoiding incoming attack on that position. To be honest i never bothered to fight more than one in the same time, i rarely encounter 2 in the same time not to mention 3. But i will try to find 2 and fight them. Ill let You know the outcome.
---
Thanks again for the T-51 gear yesterday! Nice to see more good people in this game. 
---
High level here. I used to but lately it seems I'm getting a ton of people who immediately hop on voice chat and start asking for stuff. I don't mind helping people out but I'm not Santa Claus of the Wasteland, go grind for your stuff like everyone else. Just because I'm high level doesn't mean I have an unlimited supply of legendary weapons and armor to hand out. And forget about screws, you can farm desk fans just like I did.
---
I'm also getting sick of randos who want the game spoon-fed to them and only team up so they can constantly ask me to share cards and clear enemies for them. Again, I don't mind helping but damn dude, I'm not a hired guard, go handle your shit yourself.
---
Greedy people and mooches have really turned me off from random invites and being generous to newer players.
---
They won't sell on the Market, mostly because they're from the dev room and unobtainable.
---
I've come across enemies stuck in walls and floors like this and it's especially annoying when trying to complete a workshop defense event. I figured out that throwing molotovs at them can cause them to catch on fire even though you can't hit them with melee or guns.
---
They do give us a minute, they give us 3. I just need 6 personally. To go repair all my gear then go to restroom and grab a beer is about 5 minutes. 
---
 I like both the hunting and LE. I finally switched from my crafted hunting rifle to the LE after 50+, when I got a 2* FE lever. If I come across a legendary hunting rifle, I may switch back.
---
I am not a gift, yo be given , bought or sold!
---
If you have done it with others, then you know what to expect.  All my launches have been solo.  The first took me about 45 minutes, but I had never even been in a silo before and got disoriented very quickly.  I can launch in about 20-25 minutes now on average.  I  usually turn the  turrets on the robots, but I've turned them off completely and just dealt with the mob  as I went because the turrets can get on you  (annoying mostly), if you get a low robot spawn run, but you should do just fine.  If I can do it, anyone can.  Good luck!
---
Instead of nuking the turret farm behind the golf club, an option is to get the ghouls to follow you out of the FRONT of the golf club.  Lead them in a wide arc around to the right of the building - getting as close to the wall as possible.  Keep leading them to the rear of the turret farm to the unguarded stairs that are usually there.  Lead them up the stairs to the turret platform.  The sheer volume of ghouls will overwhelm the turrets and destroy them (plus.. pretty much the rest of the camp), and you will not get a bounty.
---
I don't really mess with X-01 a lot, but info have 2 suits right now. A level 40 I'll sell for 500 caps with no mods, and one of my two old X-01 sets is still there with some mods installed  (no shocks, no jetpack) that's level 50 / 600 caps.
---
Gods of Nuka “Power Armor Justice”. Contains the hit single “Too fast to live (too many robots to kill)”
---
i dont play the game anymore, but if you use mods, you might need to download the newer versions of them and replace the old ones, that helped me the last time
---
This. I grab a workshop just about every session and have got to the point that I'm selling stimpacks.
---
No active dodging. 
---
I'm playing a character, with their own skills... the skills of said character should not be based on MY ability to mash buttons.
---
Just my $0.02.
---
Maybe it's a mobile game. 
---
Don't you have phones??
---
Thanks for stopping by!
---
Omg a swing speed boxing glove would be awesome
---
This is why i love this community sometimes
---
What are u talking about bloodied can't be that good the question is did he have his negate 45% explosive
---
This happened to me about a month ago with some t-51b
---
wait, what?   
---
i read rumors about that, but i can't imagine someone will gift this stuff to me without request or anything just becouse he was so happy to get a gun he wanted. i just was talking with teammates on ts3 and they said they heared it isn't available anymore, like the forest camo jumpsuit. shall i drop it and hope bethesda won't notice or am i screwed now anyway?
---
While it would be nice, it’s complexity and low priority I fear will keep it on the Dream list.
---
If I don’t log off, I try to find a place I can hide (sneak mode) and be safer.  I always stash my junk and normally don’t have anything too valuable on me.
---
If I do have lots of junk, in a hostile spot, or found something very valuable, I do a quick log out from server.
---
+1
---
If you roll with a wanted outlaw, then you're a wanted outlaw.
---
Thank you for this! I’m getting the silo pieces right now! I’m really exited to do this alone! 
---
Put on Pharma Farma and use the search function. Any chem box, med kit, Dr Bag, and bathroom mirror will now have a search function it lets you research them and you have a chance to get more healing items. I find doing flatwoods, medical centers, and whitesprings houses (lots of mirrors and medkits) keeps me reasonably stocked. Also if you craft them and keep chemist and super duper on you can make a lot quickly.
---
Cant remember from top of my head, it could have some parasites. Im sure my thirst bar after being infected was disappearing very fast. In short period i have used my 10 corn soups. Where normally i have that for good 2-3 hours of game play.
---
You can get plans from vendors for sturdy and heavy. BOS - Brither Hood Of Steel - is ultimate strength randomly dropped from completed events. 
---
He probably gifted it to you, because he knew you could get banned from having it. That guy is probably an asshole.
---
Maybe like every other piece of technology you should let it load before you start pressing buttons :p
---
Genius.  
---
blood packs? I serve hop and keep re-searching the places?
---
Oof
---
yes, the items are what effect the servers, In fallout 76 everyone has a copy of the game world in the default state, and when you load into a cell the server sends you the history for the cell. this is why stuff explodes or you zone into white springs or when you load in and everything poofs before you refresh. 
---
The server is just keeping a list of what isnt there(this is pretty clear when i join a server a friend is on across the country and its really laggy for me), it also is keeping a list of meat piles and where they "mostly" are though some times that isnt MP synced. 
---
Enemies have spawn points in each cell, you can see ghouls in t-pose some times, those enemies respawn when a player enters a cell and they aren't dead and the spawn isnt flagged as having been used recently. (this clears when players leave the cell as apparent by death inside dungeons). But this seems to be per player since if you hang out in whitesprings and wait for a new player to zone in or join the server they make new ghouls spawn at the tennis courts with out you having to do anything other than kill them. you can get team mates to leave the server and rejoin during blast zone events to get more stuff to spawn.  There might be a corpse to spawn point thing going on though.
---
All of those are timers and they all slow the server down, so if a player joins a server goes though white springs and then never comes back but stays on for 4 hours they may impact the server it self depending on how they are doing player tracking. Which would explain why some high traffic areas are laggy even when no one else is around. 
---
I was planning on it, but I guess server reset was last night? I have a keycard but need the new launch codes.
---
I do the same basically. I try to afk in the bunker or the resort itself because I figure the chances of someone hitting a robot and getting a few hundred enemies all of a sudden is a good deterrent from initiating PvP there. 
---
Can I serve hop and keep going around to the same containers?
---
LOL!   This still hasn’t been fixed??  Had a few of these spawn as part of a workshop defense wave months ago, making it unbeatable and had to abandon the workshop. Ooof.
---
Ok... so combat, marine, leather, etc can all be upgraded (or downgraded frankly) amongst the standard, sturdy or gray variants.  As long as you get the plans.  Either from vendors, scrapping, etc. right?
---
And BOS is another level of available plan upgrade but it’s not available for purchase and must be acquired through special event drops?
---
If so, back to my first question, what is “reenforced” on my Combat Chest piece.  That doesn’t seem to fit into any of those categories. 
---
I'm interested
---
whats your price for the combat rifle?
---
You forgot super duper...
---
This is hilarious. Vic is right, you could have just fast traveled, but you also could have laid down, taken a nap, sat in a chair for a while, used all of his benches for extended periods, or played some music if he had instruments. He gave you a little soft trolling, might as well give it back a little bit.
---
One time I found a camp of a low level player (still a few levels higher than the one I was using) and he wouldn't let me inside to check it out, so I saw he had a lamp that I could access through the window in the door. I turned it on and off for a few minutes, which I think annoyed him at first but then he gave me a heart emote. Good times.
---
Happy Birthday fellow Dweller! Just curious, what platform do you play on?
---
Ok long story short. Somone just guessed the code. And they got SUPPER Lucky. 3rd try! So yeah.
---
Nah, no hop needed, just check all the boxes on the walls, dr bags, and the explosives crate in the one building (might be locked, server hop for that one last)
---
Well the 5000+Damage I saw someone capable of with a bloodied/unyielding build with a meat hook says otherwise ;)
---
Ill invite randoms who are close to my objective so I can fast travel to them.
---
which outfit is that? I haven't found any with backpacks apart from trapper armour  
---
No, i'm busy
---
I have 160-100-8 in damage/energy/poison but the catch is I wear no armour I use perks
---
Yeah no kidding I finally maxed it out with wasteland whisper but I've only been able to tame 2 things everything else says pacify 
---
Although I like having a whole server by myself....could u release the temp banned accounts now before everyone decides go play another game? 
---
That's what half my friends did. I happen to like gaming with people n friends.
---
What’s you PSN?
---
Less of an issue if the cargobot actually goes from Point A to Point B directly (and with some haste) rather than hovering around in circles as people shoot at it.
---
This would also open an avenue for upgrading your cargo bot. Add armor and engines (speed) to increase the likelihood it makes it back home in one piece. Maybe add ordinance to shoot back at whoever tries shooting it? I'd suggest a missile launcher, but with damage the way it currently is, maybe a super sledge?
---
I am avoiding PVP until they balance out a few issues.
---
Dafuq
---
I dont have chemist nor superduper nor pharma farma
---
I would think devs ninja nerfed lockpicks
---
Under the same issue of trust. I don't understand how anybody buys any piece of legendary armor or weapon because you cannot actually inspect them before you buy. Like how do you know what the affix for the 3 stars actually are. 
---
 Silenced weapons, max stealth, light armors, chameleon, and high AGI; the full gambit.
---
 I'm more concerned about not losing the 4 generators I *just* set up inside. If you don't draw aggro they will continue to attack and strafe the structures, doing constant DOT acid damage.
---
It doesn't allow me the time to 15-20 stealth shot each SB when there are 2-3. Then, it's about trying to cripple a wing on one instead, so I can jam my handmade in their eye.
---
I'm down for the queen of you guys need help? 👍👍
---
I've spent all my point in melee still need 20 or so points into the build to make it right. Maybe I should remake my character
---
My point was they could have re-skinned the subway cars, or just made a passenger car as they made the Grafton monster.
---
thx, so those stats are with ur perks only?
---
Hopefully they will see this as the start of some automation type new content.
---
Reduce gathering from workshops that fill very quickly.
---
Mr Gusty’s for our camps that auto gather from our camp harvesters.
---
Cargo bot station at our camps for workshop gatherings.
---
Next issues that will arise from this after risk - reward is balanced, is stash boxes filling up from all this extra gathering and server stability with all the new extra junk etc being generated.
---
I like it.  Great idea we can build upon.
---
That does make it harder, expect more like 10 then from that run.
---
What they said ^
---
i'm scared af right now. i dropped the item now inside a huge lake in hope no one will find it. 
---
"Luck Information
---
Luck has always been a useful stat and, even though its only directly affected statistic is critical hits, it has other functions as well. It affects the value of loot when opening chests or looting corpses so it greatly affects the quality of items and capability in earning money"
---
https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Luck
---
Feels weird if it shouldn't improve the loot.
---
That is such bullshit......and explains why lower levels ask me why im inviting them.
---
It's all about what's best for you. The options I'm aware of are: 
---
* Sell to vendors to earn the 1,400 cap limit each day. 
---
* Loot enemies that have caps (e.g. Super Mutants)
---
* Learn where cap-stashes are in the areas you frequent. If you want someone to tell you where they are, there are several Youtube videos that give away the locations. 
---
* Start a shop in /r/Market76 or /r/fo76bazaar and sell what you can to other players. 
---
The are in My Documents&gt;My Games&gt;Fallout 76&gt;Photos. Or something like that.
---
I currently run with Scaly Skin, Twisted Muscles, Marsupial, Healing Factor, and Carnivore with 3\* Class Freak perk. The negatives aren't terrible, actually, and I haven't had much trouble shooting with my hunter rifle from a distance. The DR/ER is nice and the increase to melee damage is VERY nice.  
---
May I suggest adding Electrically Charged or Unstable Isotope to the list? For melee, these can add some more damage and I am hoping to get one or both of these at some point.
---
I tried, I couldn't get a lock on it.
---
This. I was going through my inventory to find out why I was encumbered, and I had 126 regular stimpacks, and 26 supers.
---
I so desperately want to be able to leave non-nonsensical and crazy notes in the forest that start off with a story and end with: "I'm also watching you from behind the trees :)" 
---
  I read somewhere mutfruit takes 17 hrs (game time, not real world) to produce.
---
corn and tato take significantly less.
---
To that end, add more mutfruit plants, and stagger when they are planted.  
---
That should give you a steadier supply chain.
---
I enjoy doing this as well.   Even if it's someone one their second or third run up, you're still helping them.  It's all good.   I have crafted low level weapons and modded them up especially to give away.
---
Oddly enough the explosive handmade is the best legendary I've found it's a 3 tier ghoul slaying explosive round handmade. 
---
I had a legendary 3* LongDog as the leader of a horde event in the Bog. Took for EVER to find the (useless) legendary loot after finally killing him.
---
It occurred to me, too, but I didn't have enough patience.  Besides, it was terrifying to look at :p
---
Yea I use ironclad for 50 each and barbarian for 50 damage resist(just ballistic) and scaly skin mutation for 50 each
---
Found this: " It affects the value of loot when opening chests or looting corpses"
---
Don't want those responders after me--oh they're all dead.
---
Yes, you can. Select it and press "Inspect". On PC it's X, not sure on the consoles but it should say at the bottom of the screen.
---
Theoretically none if the join server feature did it behind the scenes. 
---
Huh, didn't even think of land mines.  I'll lay some down next time I see it.
---
🤣😂 I'm with you!
---
The photo mode reminds me of how bad this game actually looks.
---
I understand the pain. Does it happen often? Did  You consider moving the camp? 
---
Happened to me once on ash heap map, straight away relog and server bounce. I was low lvl back than but i managed to save my camp.
---
I just want the Blackbird PA skin back up. I didn't start playing until long after it was gone.
---
And then they fall through the world and you can't loot them. I've had several crippled deathclaws do this.
---
I believe if you get on a new server you can, though it can be hard to tell if you actually move servers. I generally put myself near a place with logs. If I can't interact with them I am on the same server, if I can then I am on a new one (used this when trying to get Charleston responder bot vendor to spawn)
---
This also gives us a market place.
---
&gt;I'm on xbox, claycalebrissy .  My son and I both play so you never know who's on, but we're always willing to help.  
---
My friend and I hang around the vault for people to come out so we could swoop them up and take them under our wing. We've done this several times now and our posse just keeps growing. Most of them are over lvl 50 now and they're all pretty chill laid back folk. There's so many now that we run in 2 groups and all sit in 1 party chat. Makes launching a nuke a piece of cake when you're rolling 8 deep lol.
---
Im on 2/10 commendations for the enclave quest, level 47. If you need help with something me and my 3 man team (me, a level 83, a level 33) can help you IF you help us in a week or 2 when we do fissure prime.
---
Did you watch his video? The "wall of turrets"  that has his panties in a twist is literally just three rocket turrets controlled by a switch and a couple machine gun turrets. 
---
I'm getting pretty sick of dead legendaries falling through the ground before I can loot them. I've lost out a bunch of loot from horde events and farming whitesprings. 
---
Nice. I may try a few hours and see if I can get hooked. I don’t have anyone to play multiplayer with so any suggestions on how to maximize a solo run?
---
This exact same thing happen to me yesterday with a glowing mongrel at site prime.......long dog, Ha!!
---
thnx for the offer but i just wanted to have a go at the sbq tonight..bit late now tho
---
Which workshops give you stimpaks
---
I've had people run from me or ignore me on approach and my guy is the wasteland chef. He just wants to feed people. I'm getting ready to build his restaurant.  I try to help people where I can and just be cool. And chef is only a 55 (get that, "only" a 55).
---
Just about everyone has accidentally bought, scrapped, traded or dropped something they didn't mean to. I think it's a combination of how much inventory management there is, and the interface bugs. You're likely in good company. 
---
Happy birthday! What an awesome cake too!
---
beat me to it, or further twist, we blindly help rose setup the pit :)
---
Lmao what's precious is you creeping all the way back to months ago through my posts and comments to go find a post that someone was lying about. If you paid any attention, you'd see that I wasn't the only one calling their bluff. You'd also see I'm not the only one who has a problem with camps behind the golf club, based on the upotes and various comments. Hop off.
---
I was thinking that the cargobot would have its own separate storage. Nothing crazy, maybe 30 pounds. That way there's never an issue of overloading your stash 
---
No. I don't trust people really want group. Instead, I assume they are trying to fuck me out of something. Hence, I always solo. 
---
Yeah, I was just chuckling last night about how Wallace, the libertarian-anti-commie robot in Harper's Ferry, sells communism poster plans. 
---
Thanks, I’ll give that a look over! 
---
Thanks! 
---
Its a shame, a beautiful helmet, hope nothing happends to your account, you'll have this post to back you up anyway if anything happens
---
Planning on coming back when the new content comes out? 
---
I have it. It’s been up twice. 
---
Happens to me at the WS Bunker, too. I'm pretty sure it's happened other locations (Nuka Cola Plant, for sure), but I don't remember where else.
---
I'm leery of anything that works like reactive plates - those can get you into PvP even in Pacifist mode.  I believe both Electrically Charged and Unstable Isotope can cause that reaction if someone hits you causing you to initiate PvP.
---
Healing Factor seems to provide little benefit and I use chems, healing is not a big issue outside combat.  Carnivore is interesting though - does it provide more benefit besides just hunger benefits eating meat?  Like if I eat a Glowing steak, I get 2x the melee damage bonus?  That would be a BIG plus.
---
Wherever they are on the map might be a indication as to what their intentions might be. I myself like to invite pretty much everyone on the server whenever I'm about to enter a nuke silo. So I'll travel to the silo, start spamming invites and then anyone who checks my location should be able to tell what my intentions are.
---
I'm over 300/400 ballistic/energy resistances. Use BOS modded heavy combat armor with either bolstering if you run bloodied or vanguard if you run high health
---
I do. I think they often want to fast travel free or use group based perks. Iv always been gifted stuff when I open my camp and add people never had anyone acting badly. 
---
Isn’t there a limit to server capacity anyways? 
---
If there’s a slot for every player up to the maximum capacity then there wouldn’t need to be server hopping.
---
It’s also not guaranteed everyone will want a town house anyways. 
---
The only issue I could see were if 4 players on a team wanted houses side by side by side by side. 
---
Otherwise, it’s a fun idea. I imagine the raids on houses would be much more fun as well with towns! Right now my CAMP gets maybe 2-3 protections or a mongrel or 2.  Id love to see large scale raids on towns!
---
What’s your platform? I can craft them on ps4
---
ironclad sucks up 5 perk points i think? 
---
thx for sharing, because i see people w/o P/A in a nuke zone and i want that..haha.
---
I agree. If I drop shit for low level, it's on my terms, no trading, and on my own time. 
---
I’ve helped a lot of low levels in my time and some have told me that they thought the community was super mean. 
---
Both legs does not kill the blobby glowing ghouls at Whitesprings when nuked. I usually blow the legs of a hoard of 5-15 of them with my shotty, only to switch to melee and go back to kill them if someone else haven't already.
---
All of them. 
---
I would actually say that you're almost guaranteed to get 3-6 for each event.
---
3-6 for taking it, 3-6 for each defense event after.
---
I get more radaway that way than I can use as well. I either sell them, or include them in low level care packages.
---
The Pitt is a 9 hour plus drive from WV. Over the mountains is a bit of a stretch there
---
Tuesday is when they typically do patches, however I don't know of any planned patches today. As far as the weekly event and store updating, I thought it was supposed to be 10 am eastern. Doesn't seem to be the case today. I want my new stairs. 
---
I would invest points into first aid and farma pharma. First aid to increase stimpacks effectiveness and pharma to get more stimpacks while searching. Also two handed melee is really op right now, but you could go whatever route.
---
i figured that place should be a small workshop for distilling unique booze.
---
This is by far my favorite part of this game.  I love saving plans and recipes and popping in front of a newb to drop the gifts at their feet.  Even better is when they instinctively attack because I've just startled the crap out of them.  I just give them a thumbs up because honestly, we've all done that. 
---
Sorry for your disappointment then. I'm sure you will play more than I manage to these days certainly.
---
Playing in a party is more efficient than not, even if you're not actually playing with the people in your party. All you need is one other person and you can get 15% increased experience gain, 20% movespeed, 25% increased mutation effects, plus you can share perks. I sometimes invite randos just for that, not to mention travel benefits (to the person or their camp) and just chatting with someone (if you're into that sort of thing).
---
I thought they fixed that?! 
---
So.. destroy his shit.  Log out, block him (NOT through the game, through B-net), then get on another server.  You'll never have to see his ugly mug again.
---
That is the thing that perplexes me.
---
I don't know whether it did originally spawn in the Crystal Cavern as some people claim or not however the helmet itself has been circulating for months.
---
There have been rumours of previous break-ins in QASmoke and the rest of the 'rooms' other than the latest one that 'made headlines'  but they are just that, rumours, no more substantiated than the rumours that say that this item could in fact be legitimately obtained.
---
Moreover there were rumours of people getting temporary suspensions due to this item then reinstated once they had substantiated the provenance of the item but again no proof other than hearsay.
---
As far as I know there is no official list of what can and what cannot be legitimately obtained in game. I have never seen a Whitesprings Jumpsuit in 760 hours played and that is just an example, the only 'rare' cosmetics I have seen are the Hunter's Longcoat and the Clean Spacesuit and only because I spawned the Responder Vendor Bot that sells them.
---
How does the average Joe that does not visit Reddit - which I assume is the vast majority of players - know what is legitimate but just exceedingly rare and what is not legitimate?
---
Moreover has been any official word from Bethesda on this subject?
---
Is there any substance to any of this beyond hearsay?
---
I noticed this as well!  Was really looking forward to seeing a bigger, better explosion the first time I made one and was pretty disappointed.  Hope they fix it soon
---
Doesn't Grahm have that plan?
---
There are so many legendaries on certain armor and weapon that are useless.
---
I was well outside the workshop area when I got one-shotted so I'd say yes, you're in PvP over the whole map.
---
I also have Xbox I can get on in about 5-6 hours I will pay you more than 500+ caps my username is oldmangames1216
---
Posts like this are annoying.
---
You don't like the base? Get a bounty on your own head.
---
I have to agree if it was a non stop flight it would indeed reduce the frequency of it being shot down and upgrading/mods would definitely be beneficial. And a Super sledge does sound about right.
---
bring on the ghouls that could throw body parts (very painful ones might i add) from fallout 3 broken steel.
---
say bye bye to your crumby turret farmers :)
---
I alternate between .50 cal hunting rifle (for the benefits mentioned above) and a .45 cal lever action for mid range since it has better fire rate. It's also helpful using two different rifles so that you don't waste 'good' ammo on low level baddies. I used a pipe rifle before I found the lever action, for ghouls, roaches, etc. 
---
&gt;y  
---
&gt;Give Award  
---
&gt;share

&gt;report
---
I could see that happening. Shes crazy enough to order players to hide some steel for no reason. Someone will find it...eventually
---
I just finished Belly of the Beast yesterday with lvl 41 stealthy rifleman. Wasn't even hard.
---
yeah
---
Nice while in flight, but I definitely circle and attack the boo-tocks with my AllRise. Constantly circling and attacking also seems to distract the SB, break its attack rhythm, and concentrate the aggro on me. Especially effective solo, but makes group efforts much faster. 
---
Right, but you're answering "are the prices reasonable" with "well, there are only a few things that I've actually wanted". Those are two different things completely
---
never found the BOS armor...where did you find the plans/amour?
---
I got mine from claiming workshops and defending them
---
Yeah I used to allow folks to join me till my camp got trashed 
---
All it takes is just the one to ruin It for others 
---
I assume they did it for balance reasons. If you explicitly make something give you much better loot in a looter shooter, everyone would pick it. Luck is still work it for the increased critical fill rate, IMO anyway 
---
As far as I know, Carnivore just provides the hunger benefits and elimination of disease from meat. What's good about it is that once you kill a mole rat or other animal, you can just eat the meat without any worries. I'll have to see if you get additional benefits when consuming meat that grants other perks (I doubt it, though).
---
Yeah I only have 3 or so and I have no idea which is which.
---
Explosive bolts 🤔
---
I have been saying this since it came out!!!! We need to be able to leave notes in the world. It would add so, so much to the game. 
---
I got X-01 which shows me resistance of 560-538-560 (might be +/- few points), while outside PA I wear almost full Vanguard BoS Combat armor (heavy) and got (+/-) 442-492-25 (with grounded mutation).
---
Cool cake. Happy Birthday fellow wanderer🙂
---
Make sure you hit that “search” button though! It’s not automatic!
---
Your title reminded me of this:
---
https://youtu.be/C9-aUaKPhes?t=70
---
Thanks man, will be online in about an hour
---
Found the plans for the arms and legs pre-patch 5 and bought the chest plans off the market for 2k if I remember right about a week post-patch. I offer modding services on ps4 for 100 caps per armor piece or 25 if you bring your own scrap
---
Except the resource gathering is supposed to be a limiter on resources.  If they wanted you to have those resources automatically, they’d go straight into your stash.
---
There are many things far better to spend server budget ok than a couple dozen cargobots flying around for what is actually very little benefit.
---
Ima casual gamer and a software dev so bugs don’t bother me much.  They eventually get fixed.  Hardcore gamers are very competitive and invest a lot of time in games though so they tend to get pretty pissed off when bugs become the thing that destroy a days work.  I get that too.  
---
okay. let me know when you are coming online.
---
I've only noticed a couple on Xbox, and they have only appeared over the the last three weeks. Up until then I have been free from idiots, only ever meet nice people, I'm usually the one shooting others as I just see movement out of the corner of my eye and start blasting away, luckily I don't damage them as I'm in pacifist mode.      
---
I think it’s the lack of legendaries in safes and other locked containers. Knowing whatever was inside wasn’t worth the time made me rush lockpocking and eventually ignore anything locked.  It wasn’t worth swapping the perk cards
---
Thanks, figured it out just after i posted. FO76 reddit is rly helpful. 
---
Golf outfits. Purified water.  Assault/combat rifles but they're heavy.
---
No offense, but that’s a terrible reason for a pretty complicated system.
---
Take your time and explore, the game is made so you can investigate what you want to, when you want to. Weapons are down to your fav style of combat. You have melee and guns. Both vary a fair bit! 
---
A crucial part of bettering your guns is the fact you can ‘scrap’ ones you find off enemies and lying around at workbenches - and in the process, learn new mods for aforementioned scrapped guns. I could go on forever with tips but these are my raw basics! Good luck vault dweller! ;) 
---
I got the flame trap and the electrical trap both for completing one of the free state(?) missions. I thought they were quest rewards.
---
My main in non-PA = DR 342, ER 399, RR 76 (not Perk'd for extra DR/ER)
---
Aww stretchy dogs. Yeah I usually see them up by the giant red rocket station.
---
DLC
---
Cripple their legs, stand their punishing them till thet die.
---
You can't let gulpers out of your sight or they heal 
---
If all the plots were flat and the same size, you could just plop your CAMP into any of the empty plots. Then it's just a matter of finding a server with enough empty plots rather than one with plots X, Z, and C empty.
---
I would think that we would be one of the main targets to be hit because of Fort Lee being appx 20 miles away. Plus, Richmond used to be the capital of the confederate states and was where Patrick Henry announced his speech, "give me liberty or give me death". 
---
We can only hope
---
Hi there! If you Claim and Defend a Workshop it should be awarded to you. In addition in Agility is Home Defense perk card that gates what defenses can be built.
---
I posted a few days ago about the same problem, and now after just killing like a wild-man, im finding they drop with kills much more frequently...I now have over 400 diluted (b/c i run bloodied). Perks: chemist/super-duper, and buy/find blood packs to double the stimpaks you have.
---
10 blood packs with perks nets you 20 stimpaks then  dilute them and get 80 or more depending on your luck with super-duper. Again, i use diluted to run at low HP for more damage using AR mutation.
---
Shooting their arm(s) often makes them drop their weapons, too. 😉
---
Each faction has their own cap pool. 7 different factions. Up to 1400 caps per 20 hours. 1800 if you can find Grahm and traveling Responder bot. They have their own pools aswell. 
---
You're probably right - double benefits from meat, not cooked food, and its cooked food that gives you the extra benefits like melee damage.  How is Carnivore different from Cannibal?
---
I’ve noticed the same thing but sometimes if you run around a bit in the area you can still find the legendary. It’s a pain but I’ve gotten 3/5 this way
---
Had a glowing wolf last night, same thing. A level 22 came by and killed the wolf. I shoot level 80 SBs out of the sky with my 2 shot gatling but damn if I could bring stretchy down.
---
Combat armor, Sturdy Combat armor, and Heavy combat armor are different base item types. You cannot convert from Combat armor to Heavy combat armor. 
---
  
---
BoS is a primary mod that replace the "standard" mod slot. I believe "reinforced" is also a primary mod, but I haven't used it, so I'm not sure. 
---
Sentinel is a legendary affix. 
---
That gives me hope that it will return a third time and I can snatch it up then.
---
Love the design, really looks lore friendly and fits well into the games environment. I hope they introduce the Gage's Eye Patch as a cosmetic item for the Atomic Shop. I want to build me a gruff ex-Raider mercenary for hire type guy. Also want that sick Warhawk again!
---
Currently just have a Paladin Danse character being my merchant character since he's already high enough level to get all the perk cards to reduce weight.
---
Personally I fell in love with the boxing gloves. It's just so therapeutic running into a mob and beating them all down via jabs and hooks. Especially when you hit low level mobs and just knock them all out one hit style. It's just so damn badass!
---
Sure you can, just press X..  
---
&gt; &gt; Trade window toggles between offers only and all  
---
... See! It just works!
---
I wonder if a trap base could be designed around the aid drops..... for science.
---
I got a decent amount doing the Collision Course event at Morgantown Airport last night. 
---
I think it came back as I haven't seen the stretchy boys in a long time until the last patch.
---
Yeah, I hate how often I get the damn rolling pins.  Wtf an I supposed to do with this?  We can't use it for cooking.
---
Though now I have this idea about being able to use legendary cookware to get better food with more perks.  THAT would be a reason to keep the rolling pin. 😋
---
Though that's probably a stupid idea... 🙄
---
I believe its a bug.
---
Haven’t played this in a while, but me and my friends were so convinced it was a secret area you could nuke and fight a secret boss.
---
Needless to say we were disappointed when we attempted it. People were saying it’s only an Easter egg based off of something so I doubt it will ever be an actual character in the game/enemy
---
maybe i should go back to X-01..your stats are great, and also...if only i could get my hands on a BOS set for non-PA.
---
These are facts bruddah
---
Dilute your stimpaks, they are fine diluted until way later in game.
---
I haven't used the Cannibal perk, but I think it just allows you to eat humanoid enemies to satisfy hunger and restore health. Carnivore won't take up 3 perk points (max Cannibal benefit) and the variety of meat, I think, is also greater.
---
I run into people like this of many different varieties. The only solid advice I have is to change servers. I know it sucks and it's an inconvenience to you, but I used to try to fight back against super high level people and/or ignore them and it never pays off.
---
I tried this last week end. First time and going solo. 
---
Just be up on your ammo and heals. 
---
I an using Power Armor and mostly melee weapons. The enemies were mostly not to hard just a LOT of them. I got the end and then learned teh hard way if you mistype a code your key is done. So I had to get another key. But being mostly melee took me for ever to shoot down another cargo bot. I then had to go back through the reset silo again. I dint make it. I didn't have enough heals anymore and it was getting frustrating. I was close, but this weekend I hope to be better prepared so I will just have to do it once.
---
I can see it now. 
---
We get a radio signal from that location and Rose sends us there to "help" her raider buddies, turns out they wanted Rose to come herself so they could kill her but instead they give you a chance to join them and leave rose or "die"(knocked out). 
---
If you stick with rose you have to make your way out of the hell hole known as the pitt.
---
You wake up in a work in progress arena without your gear, tasked with fighting opponent after opponent sometimes fight another player(if you decide not to fight the other player the crowd will start booing and the boss will send in raiders with guns to kill you both). Once you defeat 5 enemies either by downing them and executing them or downing them and letting the boss kill them, the boss decides you need to die and sends in 2 of their raiders with guns, luckily you still have the melee items that were scattered in the arena. etc.
---
You know, it would be really cool to get a dlc like the pitt.
---
Wish I knew this after a nuke hit too close and it not only destroyed all the structures, but also two rad showers. Now I have only one that I often store because of griefers.
---
I’m glad it’s working out for you now.
---
What’s interesting is to see the spectrum of attitudes towards FO76, and I suspect that a lot has to do with “gamer type”, and what their hopes and expectations are.
---
Here’s a good read, about a “taxonomy of gamer type” - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartle_taxonomy_of_player_types
---
I used it to gain insight into my own “type” and did a questionnaire which scored me on the axes of Killers, Achievers, Socializers and Explorers.   It didn’t surprise me to find I scored highest in Explorers followed by Socializers.   So while I love finding places and things in ‘76, I miss the Social aspects of the followers/companions of prior games.
---
Never leave a weapon behind. Scrapping is a great resource for mods/mats, and if you have enough of either, you can sell them at vendors.
---
When you're lower level and poor dragging a small utilititarian camp around with you is more economical than fast traveling everywhere to unload.
---
i recorded it and uploaded it on youtube, just to be safe.   
---
[https://youtu.be/uvfE-Ymhf-I](https://youtu.be/uvfE-Ymhf-I)
---
Just have someone kill you. They won't get any money and you'll get the debuff. 
---
They tried shooting the long dogs. See where it took them. Learn. Adapt. Live. Let longdog be.
---
It's easy to create &amp; send a snapshot, and if I was paying 5000 caps for a single Item from someone I didn't know, I would request that.
---
Other than that, it's fairly easy to check out someone's Reputation/Sales history here on Reddit.
---
A lot of trading transactions require some degree of trust, and players that are running dedicated vendor characters have a lot to lose if they violate that.
---
Aight'

From my anecdotal experience, things you drop in a bag on the ground last for 30-60 minutes (tested by dropping things in my camp and coming back later to find the bag still there), and things you put into containers persist for at least a few hours (tested by dropping things in overseers cache and checking back on it later).
---
&gt;He's purposefully ruining the play experience for other players and gaining no benefit at all. He was away from his base in the last video, and left his turrets on to fire at anything that comes by. This means he derives no benefit from it at all. He's just sabotaging others play experience.
---
People have been doing this strategy since the beta. Chances are this guy doesn't care about your experience, but also isn't trying to ruin it either. I get that you don't like it, but move on. Make some friends so you can take down these bases or just move on. Posts like this don't contribute to the sub. 
---
great idea! BGS please make this happen.
---
u/ladydevann Will you please pass this suggestion along? Seems relatively straightforward to implement but adds a lot to interaction and player-driven economy.
---
I did that to a guy once. Had a full Raider PA set that I won on a quest so I found the lowest guy that could use it and fast traveled to him. He took off running so I went in his base and dropped it off with a full power core then jumped back to my base.
---
Alternate idea - give the bunkers an "Armory" with workbenches and a stash box so you can do all this before leaving the bunker.
---
If you play an instrument long enough you can get the "Well Tuned" buff, giving you increased AP regen, and if you sleep on a bed long enough you get the "Well Rested" buff, which gives you a small increase in experience gain for an hour.  Be careful where you sleep though, if the bed is directly on the ground you may contract a disease!  
---
throw it away, now 
---
In a game with the only decent content being what you make, the inevetible endgame is this
---
you currently can't craft mods as a standalone item like you get from vendors. 
---
You mod items directly.
---
Being able to sell things only helps if you can make them in the first place.
---
Cthulhu, nobody wants to fight Cthulhu. That’s all I’m saying.

we just spawned the rare vendor bot with 3 ppl, one always keep him locked down and we relogged in a circle so everyone get multible trys. we got about 20 items out, till a horde of ghouls killed the lvl5 responder bot. 
---
Nah, they need a roulette wheel that you use caps to get a random discount or free item. Nothing like a nice compulsion loop to keep Pavlov's dog happy. 
---
Errr, wait, that might be evil. I'd blow all my caps. 
---
In to works... But can't come soon enough. I have to pull out all my PA's to find the one I want.
---
That said I envy the players who haven't yet come to the Appalachian wasteland. They will hopefully never know our struggles.
---
Anywhere in particular u farm?
---
I've gotten really lucky with that I guess. I haven't had anything malicious happen so far. Just the occasional kid who wants a wasteland babysitter. 
---
I'd pay 500 atoms for a custom bag 
---
Use grammar.
---
Take that one step further- you're BoS and you're out on a patrol quest - choosing BoS faction means you can only bring certain supplies out because of the weight of your PA. You're running out of food and water and you come across a Responder farm...
---
I wanna fight the Flying Spaghetti Monster 
---
I'm behind you!
---
IMO Gauss Rifle - can be silenced and a ton of damage if you charge the shots.  Until you have that, probably 308 hunting rifle 
---
I'm saying the prices are reasonable because they only have a few things that I would consider worthy of a purchase. The rate at which we are given atoms, if you only want a few things, then they're free. If you think they're putting out a ton of desirable items, then the prices are unreasonable, as you'd be spending close to the full price. Also purchasing 300 atoms doesn't equal 3 bucks, it's 2.40-3.00. 
---
You'll be reloading 24/7!

I have been shooting for the legs of the super mutants since FO3. If you dismembered a leg, they died instantly. Otherwise, they were crippled/slowed. Then shoot the arms to disarm (pun intended) and leisurely kill them with melee
---
Butcher's Bounty now works on ticks for extra drops of tick blood.

Very easy to farm a bunch of blood in the early areas of the Forest.
---
Chemist works on blood packs, and stims, along with super duper, a quick detour to vault 78 and the lumber mill can give you 100 stims easy.
---
I'm a lvl93. I personally will sometimes find low level players and just give them a whole ton of health, food and water items to clear out my inventory.

Reinforced is an armor mod for the combat torso (got this from the master list of all mods).[master list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17WvJ9wZzT9B2uVka7lSkB8C8CXIXYkeUSY6SMqCGuHQ/htmlview#)
---
I see your point however no one has ever substantiated the claims either way.
---
All I see is either 'I say that it could be legitimately obtained, take me at my word' or 'I say that it will get you banned, take me at my word'.
---
The one item that we know that it was illegitimatelly acquired from the dev room Bethesda stated in the patch notes that had been eliminated. It did not say specifically which one it was but hey, it was present in the previous .esm and is absent now so is not really hard to do the math.
---
However the Marine Armor Helmet is still in the .esm with the exact same FormID, it would bear to reason that if the only copies in existence are illegitimate they would have done the same?
---
They only had to change the FormID of the item and \*poof\* they would have all disappeared.

Happy Birthday!

Funny story about a Perfectly Preserved pie. My husband decided to try his luck on the first pie machine he saw. He got the pie! And the server crashed... he did not get the pie and now I mess with him every time we play FO76 together. 
---
What exactly is an eater egg anyway? I see this term thrown around often
---
I was under the impression that teammates can't scrap things in your camp that you built yourself?
---
No?
---
4.
---
Duh.
---
You absolute mongrel- 4 is the best wasteland. Because it had C O L O R. It was a wasteland, but it had color, and was bright, and gud. Also it didn't look like it was rendered on a boiled dog turd.
---
I would love to be able to send a drone to drop a loot container.
---
Run whitesprings/west tec/chemical plant/ everywhere else in the bog, but I've gotten stims in lower level areas as well. They just are dropping more, but you gotta kill kill kill.
---
So little map content, no story. It was fun if you had 1 person to fuck around with. Then, in a few weeks, you've done everything and the stuff you haven't done doesn't matter because it's just an underdeveloped patch of map somewhere with the same 5 enemies and your shit is about to break again. Fixing broken shinpads was fun for 2 weeks. My last fallout franchise game unless they upgrade the engine and fire everyone who made 76
---
Sweet.  Access requested. 
---
I super-sledged the ceiling turrets in VATS. About half the time I glitch above the ceiling. It was fun at first then I almost got stuck 90% of the way through the silo run.
---
An Easter Egg is just a hidden secret people hide in their games for you to find just for fun. 
---
Most of them are just tiny things like a hidden object, but every now and then they have bigger ones in certain games like secret bosses, levels, etc..
---
Govt drops should have never been made to generate a bounty. In fact, if they wanted to do the right thing, they should have made them produce loot for everyone who opens it, not just a single one shot loot for the first person to get there.
---
As long as you play solo and avoid nuked areas, stealth/VATS/rifles is good.  Just be ready to constantly be fighting encumbrance due to lack of str, PA, or rifle weight reduction (perk doesn’t exist)
---
I don’t think they ever refactored the stealth system to support multiple players, because I found sneak attacks inconsistent at best with other players around, and downright non-functional in nuked areas.
---
I was defending a workshop red rocket? Got notified my camp was under attack. 
---
Overburdened and stash box was full.

Came back to missing  roof and missing workbenches. 
---
Playing my main till the turrets thing gets resolved.
---
No dupers on xbox? lol. They were selling TSE decked shotguns to vendors for 25 caps and giving them away to players. 
---
Most the players I run into are cool now but earlier there were a lot of dbags. Teams bating a player to PVP 1v1 while the rest of the team hid, stacked bobble heads, etc. Base griefing still happens sometimes still per the people I talk to in game.
---
I did have someone running around griefing low level players Sunday and when he messed with my level 35 friend I killed him 3 times in a row before he left the server. I guess he didn't count on a level 180 being teamed with a level 35.
---
How much RR do you need to fight the SBQ outside nuke zone?  My unarmed non-PA currently has trouble but he only has around 50 RR combined.  Maybe I should pop some diluted Rad-X as well.
---
Something hidden in a video game, ala easter eggs in a garden. The first ever was in a early (like 8bit or less) adventure game, with the developers name hidden inside it. Since then, the term has been used to refer to all references and secrets in video games and other media.
---
I hope the manage to fix the SBQ so she does not run away before timer expires, actually takes damage during battle, corpse does not disappear, and actually drops loot.
---
I have a sneak-sniper and belly of the beast is fairly easy. If you need help me know, I am on PS4
---
Bump! Got this Problem too. Mostly when inside Buildings. WASD not responding for a few seconds, Mouse works fine tough. 
---
what flavor kool aid is that 
---
Why not?
---
I don't know. And that's because I don't work for Bethesda's accounting department. I don't know what their operational expenses are and I havnt seen the market research that I guarantee you they did before assigning those prices. 
---
For why they don't sell things in packs, I also dont know. And frankly i dont care. It could be because they dont want to. That's up to them. Just because other games do something doesnt mean that they have to. 
---
You dont have to buy the completly optional cosmetic items if you dont want to. And you especially dont have to spend any kind of real loot. I've bought a good 15-20 items off of there, havnt spent one red cent, and still have 540 atoms stocked. 
---
When my camp got trashed it was we teamed up &amp;  they found out where my camp was parked.
---
Even if they didn’t change the names and simply added the armor rating
---
Also far less likely to be a child.
---
They already said recently as of 3 months ago that even FO76 was designed for pc first and ported to consoles. I mean just look at the raw numbers, more people bought FO76 for the PC than for the consoles until the game stores started bundling 2 copies of FO76 with systems, and bundled it with used controllers. 
---
The only reason the console numbers are higher than PC numbers now is due to the game being given away on consoles. It has never been given away for the PC.
---
\+25 Rad resist legendary prefixes are sometimes bugged...  they don't always get applied correctly.  Nothing you can do about it but to toss out the piece and find one that has it applied correctly.  I have a mix of working/bugged +25 Rad resist pieces (only kept bugged ones with a good 3rd effect).
---
Curious like a crazed-looking cat...in a bathrobe. :)
---
I always assumed that was how it worked ... So when I would clear out a loot drop, the person that called it in would walk up to an empty container?
---
maybe they don't care about this item becouse it's just a cosmetic, it had once some stats, but that was gone. maybe with a patch, idk since i had the helmet only in my stash as collectable. they might thought it's ok when ppl have it, but removed the stats so this isn't a benefit in combat. i have this item now for 3-4 weeks, i just ran over it since i told an clanmate where it possible could been since he wear a full suit of marine armor and it would fit perfectly, but since i only had this single one i want to check if we get another for him.   
---
idk which item they removed, but it was maybe something which gave players an unfair advantage. the other stuff was nerfed so it don't have any impact ingame.
---
Some options are available through scrapping pieces.  I find Dense mods (for chest pieces) to be extremely useful against explosive weapons - your own and others. 
---
I like the idea of the smoke signal! that would be awesome!
---
&gt; I miss the Social aspects of the followers/companions of prior games. 
---
I don't understand this part. You can now have companions - but they're actual people. 
---
You make the Overseer proud.
---
Yeah, this makes no sense whatsoever. It is like Bethesda has seen how every successful online game is handled and they go out of their way to do the exact opposite of how it should be handled. 
---
What makes even less sense is that this isn't even their first online multiplayer game, ESO holds that title and it is even handled better than this, they at least fix major bugs in timely fashion instead of waiting until the next patch.
---
Boy, lemme tell you. Last week I went to the BoS vendor to buy the calibrated shocks plan for the T-51b. Imagine how I felt when I went to the notes tab and saw it was for the T-60. 
---
So I’m targeting an Unyielding Build.  So in order to optimize this, I should to hunt down the best 3* Unyielding Heavy Combat or Heavy Marine armor sets I can and then search out the mod plans for upgrading to things like BOS, Deep pockets, etc.  is that a good approach?
---
I turn my area mic on sometimes "person president, I have been assigned as your security detail. Please proceed to your active markers or communicate if you do not have acceptable kit. My orders are to see you make it alive to your current destination and to outfit you." Proceeds to drop BoS outfits, armor, weapons, plans. 
---
Beth! Please let us dual wield knives and daggers! 
---
Hey, its my birthday too! Happy birthday, birthday twin! 🎂
---
I have done it twice solo. I think something changed recently because the first time I removed the targeting restrictions, let the turrets kill off the robots, then disabled the turrets. The disabling part wasn’t an option when I did it this past weekend.
---
My recommendation is to use the turrets to your advantage for the pipe fixing, core destroying, and core replacement parts but not in the final room. Easier to clear out all the robots yourself than also have to deal with the turrets killing the good robots. I almost got overwhelmed protecting them and dealing with the bad bots and turrets. 
---
Go stealth, go focused, but keep moving. 
---
Cool so hopefully that creature could still be something we fight later on. There’s another one of those metal heads that are on the wall down there in another spot that I found. It’s up in a cave in the giant vine tree in the mire. I’m so tired of wasting ammo on the scorch beast queen. I’m hoping for anything at this point. 
---
Wouldn't even need a new list of plans. If you scraped enough Hunting Rifles, chances are you have most if not all mods for it. Like in Fallout 4 when you made a new mod or went back to the default attachment, it put the old one in your inventory, it could easily work like that
---
I'll keep that in mind!
---
How many mod slots are there?  2 right?  Primary, Misc (and Paint)
---
As far as I know they patched that out and now container only respawn after a set amount of time. Only the world loot changes with a server hop. 
---
Thing is, the game doesn't "always have a form of PvP enabled." People have found ways around the slap damage mechanic that is supposed to prevent unprovoked attacks from killing you in 1-2 hits. If the game functioned properly and minimized damage until you actually shot back you wouldn't see nearly as many of these posts.
---
Of course it will be that 
---
It's the mothman cult.

If you're on PC I can mod any piece of your combat armor for BoS - free of charge, just need mats.

I still got the same stuff on the shop
---
Am level 48 and thought the same thing. Have spent the past few days just farming plastic for shotgun shells and adhesive for repairs. I can't seem to keep more than 10 stimpacks at a time... Would love to have enough to feel comfortable joining in on the fun at the next week zone...
---
There are ways around that gear. It's one reason people want AA weapons now.
---
I bought around 60 high tier weapons, and around 10 god tier armor pieces so far. I frequently traded the items for other items, I made bulk of what I own in-game by looking for people who sold something I deemed valuable, looking for somebody that wanted exactly this item, and trying to get two items out of their tradelist for the single one they wanted. I used reddit channels with karma system, without one, discords and whatnot. I was always rather cautious when selecting the trade partners, and I have never,  for once, been screwed up. All the items I purchased were as specified. For some of those its obvious (i.e. if its name is sentinel you know what it is), but for other items it does not mean so (think two shot explosive vs two shot bashing suicide damage).
---
I would say at this point "use at your own risk".
---
Given that no one in this thread or the other ones that I have seen crop up on the subject seem to have any evidence either way I will assume everyone is as clueless as we are. 
---
I posted an in-depth guide on how I farm stimpacks. 
---

---
You need some school shooter jackets and some xanax dude lol
---
I found another one of those metal heads in another spot that are on the wall beside sleeping creature. The bone shrines are pretty common. 
---
I like the urgency as it is. This game is/was about prep. Have your armor and weapons repaired at all times. QoL just makes things too simple.
---
This item is circulating because once you scrap it, you learn the plans to craft it and it's very cheap to make then people sell them to vendors for easy caps. I've seen this helmet usually by the dozens, dropped in suitcases, coolers and trashcans near train stations.
---
I think they said patch 6 (last weeks patch) was the last plan patch before patch 7 (march 12).
---
Seriously this game needs gambling in the worst way. 
---
The best thing to do is get marsupial and chameleon armour. Jump somewhere high and crouch. Crouching will hide you on he map by default, and with the armour (or mutation if you have no armour/weightless armour) you’ll be invisible.

\+1.  Love checking the shop for new content / sales.  Seems we get a new weekly refresh, and then a mid week sale or new item, and that's it.

There are folks who just want to see things burn.
---
Could you imagine that thing come to life?
---
Personally, with all the fissure sites on the map I would like Bethesda to add DLC content to see those sites get nuked and see what things crawl out of that hot mess!

Well my camp is at the Mirelurk pond quite some way away from the ghoul spawns but still on the golf course. I have a single missile turret to help out with the Mirelurks, but that spot was just too great looking for me to not use. I also have a switch for turning off the turret just inside of it and never lock my camp.

yeah it seems like we have to choose between cool lights or everything else..

I’d be happy if bethesda improved the camp dozing thing so that we could flatten land and move large trees out the way
---
I did that on accident at the barrier that you have to destroy the mainframes, and trying to get out ended up on the wrong side of the barrier. Sat there for like 15 minutes debating on if I wanted to restart. Turns out you can still complete the mission if you happen to glitch past a barrier. If you know the next steps. 
---
What is unfair about using turrets to kill enemies?
---
I sometimes get Radstags who spawn under my raised foundation.   I have to shot them when their heads appear in the floor.     One time one of them somehow destroyed my fusion generator as I was spawning into the game for the first time that day.  
---
Where is the plan
---
But what if you like everything else but that particular design?
---
But the OP wants complete 'Pacifist on = No PvP'. That was never the deal and a complete seperate issue to 'slap damage isn't fit for purpose'.
---
You'd still see these posts, except they would read as follows:
---
&gt;Today a level 200 followed me, a level 35, around for 10 minutes whacking me in the head until I died. When I respawned they proceeded to do the same thing again. WTF Bethesda.
---
Then you have two choices:
---
* This specific design is not enough to stop me from purchasing the product. Therefore, why are you now complaining?
---
* This specific design is enough to stop me purchasing the product. Therefore, why did you buy it?
---
Yes, I love the social aspect of playing with my friend, but as I said earlier...
---
      *”1. Appealing stories delivered by appealing companions such as Cait, Curie, Piper, Nick Valentine etc.   I really miss them.”*
---
For me, a lot of the appeal of FO4 was the compelling story telling, delivered by convincing voice actors, and delivered over time as the “relationship” evolved.  That’s what I mean by “companions”.   Running into random strangers spouting immature rubbish in the early game made me narrow my audio options to “team”.   I don’t need this.
---
I miss the game’s delivery of story telling
---
I would love this
---
Ya, lol.

I'm playing the game right now everything on LOW, and  that seems to be the only way for me to play this game, which is ridicoulus.

I’m not sure if the game could handle it, my PC is well above the required specs and I still jitter to all hell in Charleston.

Yeah no new store stuff for me either

Came here to say this! Boiled water, Bloodleaf, Soot Flower. Super easy to collect from Vault 76 to Flatwoods! Used just like a stimpak and super easy to collect. Works with born survivor perk card and D pad quick select!

Yup. Not worth the cost. I started making the quantum and cola grenades. . . And after some research the quantums are almost useless. While the colas work GREAT! I'm always running around with 10-20 of the nuka grenades on my person. They even sometimes one shot griefer's holed up in your camp. Multiple tests. . . 100% positive results.

Lol. Noice.

I suggest going to a tinkers workbench and relapsing the cores rather then trying to find them. It took me WAY to long to find all the mainframe cores.

Nothing new on the atomic shop yet
---
It’s half creature half plant I believe. It has arms and legs and bleeds when you shoot it. The tentacles coming out of its mouth also move. I think it’s some sort of alien because of those weird metal heads on the wall beside it
---
That's how it used to work.  One person calls in an Aid Drop, everyone was able to get their own instanced loot from the crate, error free.
---
Back in January, one of the patches, first or second that month, I forget, changed it.  Now the loot is "persistent" and any player who is not the person who calls it in will receive a bounty for picking the lock.  If the lock is already picked you are free to take the loot inside though.  It's only the act of picking the lock that is hostile.
---
It seems that it was an unannounced but purposeful choice.  Much like the nerf to the Watoga Mayor quest's daily chest being changed to one and done.
---
I'd hazard a guess they felt that it was too much loot being spread out when people were able to call in high level area drops and everyone on the server able to get their own instanced loot.
---
Yeah and you didn't read what they said clearly or you'd understand that those people hurting others need help, not an outlet to get away with it.
---
Um no you’re not going to sell lmao
---
Yeah, but after playing through the entire game with a friend and grinding levels for an explosive build (both got nerfed), I didn't really have any reason to play anymore. Didn't really help that my first and only nuke put my game in an infinite loading screen.
---
Huh....was wondering why the glowing mongrel was at full health again after chucking 3 12 gauges into its skull...
---
Thank you redditor, very cool!

nice team/rifle build, but your luck is pretty low...i found it really affects condition of looted weapons..you might be able to lower the gunsmith 5, and add a few points to luck. just my 2 caps.

I wonder how that would fit in with Fallout lore?

dont know i bought it from another player
---
That's a level headed reply that I wasn't expecting,  so thank you!
---
I'd say that people can complain about an aspect they don't like, but they should give constructive criticism. I don't think it's wrong to try and improve designs, and a lot of people have been suggesting good ideas.
---
 If it is something that wouldn't have a massive impact on the rest of the game (option to not PvP entirely) it could be openly discussed by the Devs.
---
I agree there are outside methods to confirm vendors but I think this is a basic function that should be in game. Bethesda has failed if I cannot walk up to another player and effectively trade with them.
---
That would be nice but they'd probably overprice them 
---
with fava beans and a nice chianti
---
You can kill ticks as others have said, or you can just buy them. Most vendors seem to have a couple, and they're only 35-40 caps. If you've reached level 34 be sure to grab the chemist perk so you get 2 stimpacks per blood pack.

I echo this - For the many who have helped me.  In return, I try to help out as many as possible.  ONly ran in to 3 a-holes so far, but for the most part, there's good peeps on this game.

I shot down a couple of cargo bots near Watoga.  It was one of the bots that is accompanied by 3 vertibots.  Once I got it to come down, it was locked. I picked the lock and it said that I would be stealing from it.  I took the nuclear keycard, but I did not get a bounty.  This happened a few times, actually.  I have not yet had a bounty from doing this.
---
Having to refer to a snapshop of some kind or reddit just proves my point that Bethesda failed. Love the game but this is a no brain addition that should be added. 
---
In the same note, if I walk up to a random and we are chatting and I want to just see the weapon he is using I have no way to do that. I can't even inspect my team mates weapon. Not without dropping or trading it.
---
I went to Blackwater but could not find freddie lang

They are low level Wanted bait if you really want to get that "Kill 20 players" trophy.
---
I always feel bad when a new player gets a bounty from my drops though.  I always go to the Flatwood Relay Tower when I log in on my Vendor Trip cause of the Ballistic Fiber spawns.  And I always have a couple dozen supply drop Holotapes so I call one in.
---
I've killed a few level 10-20 players who get the bounty.  They usually start asking "Why'd you kill me, Sir?" on the mic.  I don't loot their junk, I just kill them to get their bounty cleared and then move on.  Half the time they instantly log off the server.
---
The few times I don't kill them though, about 5 minutes after they get the bounty, up to 4 level 80-150 players appear in Flatwoods and start to converge on their location.  And I just imagine they aren't as forgiving as me when it comes to looting their junk bag.
---
Much appreciated but I'm on XBox.

I just need to build up my stockpile of fusion cores and not waste them while enroute to the caverns. Was down to 4 when I got to the end. Currently also working on leveling up the perk to make them last longer. VATS seems to burn through them quickly.

In this instance me and two others were inside his structure talking and helping each other (was crafting protective lining bos soldier outfit for them) when one guy attacks from the front.  We all pop out to attack back when a lvl 200+ SHOTGUN SNIPES us from a ledge behind his camp at WS and basically 1-3 hits us all.  I took 1 hit the first time, 3 hits the second time with full health and 350 dr, 300 er.  Something is broken.

I glitched past a barrier that I had not disabled yet one day. Asked my sister to come and finish the part that I could not get back to and she got like 5 steps in and noped never agained her way out of there. Lol. Turned out I could complete the mission even after not distorting all the mainframes. After this I decided not to use cars on turrets unless they were higher up. 
---
Nuclear Key Card cargo bots won't give you bounties for taking them.  Only Government Supply Drops called in by other players from Relay Towers.
---
Random Event supply drops will also not give you a bounty.  Sometimes it is hard to distinguish between Random Event and an old Government Drop called in by a Player if you aren't paying attention.
---
I'd definitely store my junk, sneak up on your ass, and pop a head shot off from the cover of the woods receding back to the darkness from which I came.

Matter of fact I’m due to move my camp again.
---
I know Fallout 76 is not all like them, but there’s no safe an consistent way to tell good or bad folks while ingame.
---
I'm disgusted, but curious. Please go on. 
---
The radius of the quantum is also a joke. I much prefer the nuka grenades myself. 
---
Its a cool idea, but it doesn't fit the design goal of workshops.
---
Workshops are intended to be zones that encourage pvp by requiring you to come visit them, build a base, gather resources, etc.
---
If you never have to visit it, that defeats the pvp purpose.
---
I don't do pvp personally, so I would love to see your idea happen, but I think they would probably rather make workshops more important and thus regularly contested.

For PS4, I think it requires 2x the game size to do updates.  Kind of sucks, The last big update I was at almost 90GB free, and it told me I didn't have enough space.  Luckily I had a bunch of old installed games I could clear out, now up to 140GB.  Hopefully I don't install a new game between now and the next update.
---
There are work benches 3/4 of the way through a silo, so you can usually get most of your gear to within a reasonable condition
---
And smell the ashes
---
I went solo one time on a silo run, and when I got to the end, I didn't have the code, so I was like... "fuck." and had to run all the way back.
---
ther amount of bullets and stimpacks i wasted, ugh..
---
It will be well received, sometimes caps lock is just what we need to convey our feels lol, hopefully they're happy feels and not bad ones.
---
With the crackdown on duping, they group of guys that used to try all the combos from the decipher program either got suspended/banned or stopped playing the game, so it sounds like we will not have the codes after just a couple hours anymore. 
---
Don't worry about ruining anything. A key tip to a new player is that the only penalty to death is losing the junk that you currently carrying. Make sure you scrap and store your junk regularly and you will lose nothing each time you die. Early on this lets you play around and learn the mechanics of the game.
---
You on ps4?
---
I'd pay for atoms if they did introduce old skins or items of clothing from other fallout titles instead of querky fortnite esk  knock offs.
---
I'd personally love if they introduced elder maxons get up, y know the BoS officer underarmor with his trenchcoat 
---
Ya, I think it was the ones around Abbie's Bunker.  Flamethrower and Tesla Arc trap learned upon completion.  Along with plans for Light Combat Arms/Legs/Torso intermingled as rewards.
---
Same here man, I so badly want slugs in this game. Increased range, maybe an anti armor or staggering effect. Only downside would be less procs on the Enforcer perk.
---
We'd have to rent them? Not a bad idea given the benefits but wasn't sure that was the original proposal.
---
Let's not forget General Oliver's outfit from Fallout 3!
---
that gamertag tho, lol
---
ill add you.
---
 I'm gonna go with the third option  on this and  use my officially licensed version from Robco  the H.A.R.D.P.A.S.S. 
---
neat idea but it's not for me .
---
The codes reset an hour ago. Going to take time to get new codes. 
---
Ill sell you 17 copies of explosive vents lol. Also have a full set of plans of the pieces that are equally useless now. :(
---
Well I will not try to deny your argument that the game UI in regards to trading is complicated, ineffective and exploitable, because you are right.
---
Cultist Blade and Dagger plans are sold by Harper's Ferry vendor, I believe.
---
No, you’re just a cringy edge lord. Trust me man, I don’t engage with pvp in this game because it is broken. Congrats on having the higher level and perks to squash lower levels. You must be so good at the game. 
---
Store is same. That might reset at 7 pm eastern, not sure though. 
---
2/10, overdone, unfunny, unoriginal
---
Who hurt you?
---
Why not simply build a stash box? 
---
I thought I did too, but if I edit my post it's actually there.... Weird Reddit post formatting? 
---
The generic Enclave officer uniforms from FO3 were pretty awesome, too - the General uniform we get in FO76 is cool but it still feels weird hopping straight up to General and seeing everyone run around in that outfit; would be a bit more immersion-friendly to see other officers running amok, too.
---
But this hasn't locked people to craving a maxed luck-build yet so it seem to work?
---
I saw two simultaneous census violence markers the other day. 
---
Also tried doin scorched horde, found the boss, marker was underneath the floor inside glassed cavern. Fml.
---
Darn, well you still get a decent amount if you follow that route.
---
Neat! 
---
Wish you could have captured that as a video.
---
Didn't someone post an Alpha code here a few hours ago suggesting reset was then and not one hour ago? 
---
Good bot
---
Thank you very much!
---
Well that stinks 
---
No, I get some people don’t like it. I’m also not the one talking down to others because they enjoy the game. 
---
And no, my parents instilled in me that there are some ignorant and entitled people out there who *think* their opinion has more value based off their circumstantial evidence.
---
What are you guys talking about ?
---
Where in lucky mine is such a creature to be encountered ?
---
I think I know this place quite well, I get 400+ ore each time...

You should watch Ready Player One~
---
Completely forgot about his gear but yeah I'd deffo buy and wear it
---
Dude. Go back to farm ticks! TICKS have very important properties!!!!! 
---
Absolutely I can pass this along to the team. Thank you for the tag!
---
I wrote this a few months back and it still stands, I've since tried a complete Bolstering BOS Heavy Combat armor set.
---
TL,DR: The Sentinel Unyielding Heavy BOS Combat Armor (SUCA) isn’t what it “should” be, an end game set of armor. It lacks rad protection that can’t be fixed with perks or mutations and it can’t deal with mobs due to stun effects, you’re better off running lvl 45 Excavator with NO perk cards equipped.
---
Let me preface this with I’m no guide builder, I’m not the guy who writes 20 page detailed guides, but I am the guy who will try anything (sometimes aimlessly) to gain an advantage. My gaming experience covers about 40 years, I started by playing pong so I’ve played a lot, my first real character building game would have been diablo, which I beta tested when beta testers we’re chosen based on your gaming resume.
---
I didn’t use any power armor till lvl 45, partly because I didn’t focus on any missions either main story or side. For my first 80+ lvls I just explored and killed stuff. I didn’t enter my first Nuke zone till at least lvl 60 and that was when I discovered I really needed some power armor. By the time I discovered I needed power armor I was already wearing a few pieces of SUCA that I had traded for, again I hadn’t really focused on any missions but I was deep into trading so that’s how I had acquired them.
---
So at level 80ish I decided a few things, get every set of PA, every mutation serum and complete my SUCA set. By level 204 I had done that. I did have to trade for the majority of recipes, that damn queen isn’t very consistent with those.
---
So on the 17th Bethesda announced the TSE explosive nurf was coming. It was then that I decided to find a new build for current lvl 208 Melee/TSE Lever action build. Like others, I was thinking a bloody low health mutated build would be the way to go. I also deiced it was time to look at that SUCA set considering we no longer had rechargeable fusion cores and to be honest, I wanted out of the PA.
---
So with my 70+ unspent perk skills, I rebuilt my character to run no power armor, run low health with mutations and “try” to take advantage of the +3skills I would be getting from the 5 pieces of BUCA. My initial thoughts we’re the 15% damage reduction, a few mutations and new perk cards would be more than enough. Right out of the gate there was a problem, no significant rad deduction from the Armor itself (+20 rad reduction from Arm and +5 from Shielded Forest Operative, +40 Rad resistance perk card). The only way to go into a nuke zone not wearing PA is with a hazmat suit and or running Rad sponge, it just isn’t possible to be done any other way, if your running solo.
---
My other stats we’re fairly high enough, or so I thought. My Def was pushing 400, (also using Junk Shield) higher than my Excavator set but I soon found out that it didn’t matter how high my Def stats we’re. When you’re not in PA you have the ability to be “stunned”. This makes charging into Mobs a nogo zone. I found myself is serious trouble when either being shot or attacked my multiple enemy. Even with 300% health regeneration I was getting pummeled because I just couldn’t 1 shot them quick enough with my sledge due to being stunned. It was like being hit by radscorpions over and over again.
---
I was getting frustrated so I started reading up on other builds, watching youtube vids, trying different perk card combinations, different mutations and in the end it didn’t matter. To be successful with endgame content as it is, (Scorch beast queen and WS ghouls) there isn’t a viable way to not run PA without serious drawbacks. For testing purposes I removed all my perk cards, equipped my Lvl 45 Excavators PA and only used Radaway and RadX and found it easier to be successful. This shouldn’t be the case. The best non PA in the game shouldn’t work like that IMHO.
---
I think complete armor sets need a legendary perk, like in Diablo 3. They have to make not wearing power armor more manageable, it would open up the game and give folks more options to just PA.
---
I’d be interested to hear your experience in not wearing PA. Maybe I’m just missing it and didn’t try the right combination. I put my SUCA set up on a trade board and folks were almost willing to trade their first born child for it. I don’t dabble in PVP much, maybe that’s we’re it would shine with a Sniper build.
---
Deckchairs_ftw was the one who posted and code was 91688167 but not tried it myself.

Happy to give it a blast if you want to join me in about 20mins

Now for an analysis of the Fallout 76 soundtrack. Before, the end credits for the game were really short, but now there's an hour long credits sequence which included the copyright information of the songs. 
---
I've been trying to collect the music of Fallout on the original records for quite some time.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/3rvrjh/for_the_past_couple_years_ive_been_trying_to/
---
My other work for finding records in other video games like Bioshock, Mafia, and LA Noire are here.
---
https://rapturerecords.imgur.com/
---
By far, most of these are shellac 78s since much of the time period Fallout draws from dates before the invention of the vinyl LP in 1948.
---
What's unusual about 76 is that it is the longest Fallout soundtrack at 50 songs, but I already had over half of them.
---
Granted some of them are repeats from previous Fallout games.
---
*Fallout, Fallout 3, Fallout 4*: "Maybe" 
---
*Fallout 3, Fallout 4*: "Anything Goes", "Butcher Pete", "Civilization", "Crazy He Calls Me, "Happy Times", "I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire" 
---
*Fallout 3 E3 trailer, Fallout 4*: "Dear Hearts and Gentle People"
---
*New Vegas* commercial, Fallout 4: "Orange Colored Sky"
---
*Fallout 4*: "It's All Over But the Crying", "Atom Bomb Baby", "Pistol Packin Mama"
---
***
---
Yet I already had quite a few songs on hand in my record collection for one reason or another mostly because of their use in other similarly themed video games (and TV shows).
---
Admittedly I first started tracking down these 78s back in 2010 for Bioshock 2 and there was bound to be overlap someday, but it gives the effect that my collection is getting too large or the people choosing the songs are not aware of their uses elsewhere. I still enjoy the feeling of a new experience of associating a different song with a different game.
---
On the other hand I suppose it is less work for me.
---
Alas Fallout 76 broke the streak between Fallout and Bioshock and the Ink Spots. There were 11 Ink Spots songs used between the series and not a single repeat. Until "We Three (My Echo, My Shadow and Me)" which was used in Bioshock 2.
---
Bioshock 2 also had "Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition" [which also appears in the game's trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzWTcDydlpM&amp;t=106s). And it also appears in the Mafia II soundtrack so the Kay Kyser jingle really gets around.
---
I've had "Mr. Sandman" for quite some time. It's the name of a perk in the series (compared to the frustratingly numerous song quest names in New Vegas, another story). It's also used in Mafia II. What takes the cake is that it was used in the Fallout 4 VR trailer until finally making it into Fallout 76.
---
"Uranium" is a bit of an oddity. I searched for this record way back in 2015 before the launch of Fallout 4. Specifically an interview with audio director Mark Lampert.
---
&gt;"Lampert hinted at the fact that if we delved into the Dot Records catalogue and looked at the weird 1950s atomic war-pop song sub genre we’d probably find a few things that will be in the game."
---
The article was originally written in October 2015 for idigitaltimes, but now redirects to player.one where the date is changed to June 2016...
---
Anyway, this was after the Fallout 4 debut trailer with "Atom Bomb Baby". That song was originally issued on Kernel Records and later reissued on Dot. So the only other atomic-themed record issued by Dot Records I could find was "Uranium" by the Commodores.
---
When the game came out, the song wasn't in the game and I had jumped the gun until the release of Fallout 76. As it turns out, there's a cut Travis voice line in Fallout 4 where he mentions Dore Alpert's "Fallout Shelter" which was originally released on Carnival Records and later reissued onto Dot. Go figure.
---
I had "Don't Fence Me In" and "Swinging on a Star" mostly because I liked the tunes after looking through a lot of Bing Crosby records. He recorded a lot, but Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 4 weren't content on using his commercially released stuff, more on that later.
---
"Juke Box Saturday Night" is just really catchy and crammed full of music pop culture references at the time. Plus they do an impression of the Ink Spots "If I Didn't Care".
---
"Jumping at the Woodside" was used in an episode of Agent Carter which was alas cancelled after 2 seasons. Since the flip side was "Dark Rapture", I had to seek it out. Of course as a period drama, it also had "Pistol Packin' Mama" which was also used in LA Noire with other murder-themed songs and later used in Fallout 4.
---
I did not have the Tommy Dorsey version of "Opus One", but I had the Mills Brothers vocal version of it which is rather catchy. For some reason, I had "Opus Two" which is a followup of the song.
---
"Sixteen Tons" I had around because it is the most tolerable of the Tennessee Ernie Ford songs. I also have an unusual commemorative pressing int he miscellaneous album above and an answer song called "Sixteen Pounds".
---
"Straighten Up and Fly Right" I had from Mafia II before it was used in the Power Armour edition trailer. 
---
"Wouldn't It Be Nice" was fortuitous because I had collected the songs from Bioshock Infinite which were old-timey 1912 sounding covers of modern songs. The flip side is "God Only Knows" which is sung by a barbershop quartet in the game.
---
&gt;So I’m minding my own business in Whitesprings using the weapons workbench and all of sudden someone is smacking me and then once I get out of the workbench I died. A level 200 something killed me and he was STILL whacking me with his barb-wired cane.
---
What the fuck are you talking about. Other players ***CANNOT*** kill you unless you've opened yourself up to PvP. Did you capture a workshop? Did you have a bounty on your head?
---
Slap damage does not kill. You did something to flag yourself for PvP. Be better.
---
sorr, my bad... PC
---
You should be asking the aptly named u/AberrantMan.  I'm off looking for some brain bleach.
---
Assaultrons S/D if you cripple their limbs.
---
Enforcer basically picks robots apart.
---
Thank you!
---
Of course, it wouldn't be a Fallout game without some bizarre choices and exceptions in the soundtrack where I have to wonder what twists in licensing occurred where Bethesda had to use that particular version and whether it actually exists as a record.
---
"Heading Down the Wrong Highway" I already had because I was collecting Johnny Bond transcription discs which also provided a song in New Vegas. [This also marks the first time Bethesda has licensed a new transcription disc song from Soundies Inc. since the death of the archivist and the acquisition by The Orchard](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/3tfr16/rip_william_s_cook_and_soundies_inc_aka_the/). However, this is the same Johnny Bond transcription disc CD as the one used for New Vegas. Alas, I still have yet to find a player for these discs. 
---
"Nobody's Fault But Mine" manages to steal the crown as the oldest recording in Fallout since it was made in 1928. The crown was nebulously held by Cole Porter's "Anything Goes" which uses his 1934 vocals, but adds a 2004 overdubbing by Vince Giordano. However, it is also at the intersection of 78 record collecting that I had hope never to come across, namely it is highly sought after and extremely rare and expensive. The some of the most expensive records ever sold (commercial releases as opposed to one-off performances) are not vinyl, but shellac 78s simply because there are so few. The Paramount label is interesting because the original masters were thrown into the Milwaukee River by disgruntled employees. This is worth noting because the Project V13 trailer uses a Ma Rainey song "Slave to the Blues" released on Paramount which at 1926, is technically the oldest song in Fallout. At least there are a lot of reissues. 
---
Fallout continues with the tradition of using obscure versions of songs used in films. Like "Why Don't You Do Right" taken from a Snader Telescription. Fats Waller's "Ain't Misbehavin'" isn't his first hit recording, but made for the soundtrack of the 1943 film Stormy Weather.
---
"Shenandoah" is taken from a broadcast of the Tennessee Ernie Ford Show.
---
"Steel Guitar Rag" I had a little bit of trouble since I had to consult a Bob Wills paper discography to figure out that two takes were made at the same recording session, but they were released on separate record labels at the time.
---
And finally we see the return of the APM stock music. 
---
Fallout 3 had vintage examples of stock music like "Jazzy Interlude" and "Let's Go Sunning", while New Vegas had newer songs like "In the Shadow of the Valley" and "Lone Star" meant to sound vintage. All in all, the instrumentals heard on their radios are stock music and never meant to be commercially release.
---
Fallout 4 omitted the stock music songs when they reprised Fallout 3's soundtrack. Radio Freedom may be library music as well, but I have been unable to find an actual match. Fallout 4's end credits do mention APM, however.
---
However, the Fallout 76 jukeboxes definitely play library music tracks from APM. These seem to also be from the CD era of stock music, but further investigation is required.
---
**TL;DR** The Fallout 76 soundtrack is another formidable adversary that is somehow both easier to find and harder to track down.
---
I think this would be a really good idea if we knew the game had a large player base and 2 year+ lifespan.
---
Problem is, the player base is already dwindling, the roadmap for the first year is set, there’s already a lot of content locked (vaults, buildings/rooms at white springs) and even Fallout 4 wasn’t supported for little more than a year.
---
I hope I’m wrong. It’s clear they won’t make a game like 76 again after this disaster but for people like us who enjoy it would be really good if they kept adding bits here and there to keep it interesting, kinda like WoW expansions I guess?
---
Yes I am :)
---
Bold of you to assume
---
I suggest using the enforcer perk.
---
I don't do silo runs without it. Turns your shotgun into an instant cripple for most robots.
---
What would be the model here? Vendor farms screws and other Mats so that he can make the mods beforehand? Or request that the buyer brings his own materials?
---
I could see each being lucrative. 
---
I knew unlocking all the mods for the lever action wasn't a waste of time...
---
I think I just used the word “rent” arbitrarily, but I suppose there could be a weekly fee for living in town. Something like 50-100 caps a week but maybe the town would have built in crops, water, resources etc? 
---
Many weapons reflect their Prefix in the name, and display the Major Prefix, like: Two Shot Handmade (Bullets Explode for Area Damage), This alone is why I seldom Trade people I don't know with my main character, it could be someone just sizing you up for PvP, and I figured out very quickly that everyone just wants to buy my primary weapons anyway.
---
I wish Bethesda would make it to where your favorited weapons don't display in the Trade menu at all, Atom Shop Items already do this, so it shouldn't be that difficult.
---
I bought the Siren plans last night cause I was bored.  I'm going to build one and permanently power it up at my friend's camps when they aren't looking just to annoy them.
---
Near as I can tell, that's all they are good for.  Unless you set it up to be a warning, like "someone opened your garage door" or "enemy walked into your garden (pressure plate)".  Etc.
---
It's going to be about the current state of the economy in fallout, and a remembrance of when the economy was corrupted by bugs (duping meant that you couldn't really trust that the market was stable, no constant tug of supply and demand). It will have a lot of information on why you even want caps, which might help when I explain the different ways of getting caps. I'll go into fallout market, and share a few interviews with people who play the game in an economically unique way. It will be up on Friday!
---
Yeah, I don't see a good reason to change the government drops because it hasn't always been that way.  If we loot it, does it actually affect someone else looting it?  If so, then I guess it makes sense as you are 'stealing' at that point.  But if our loot table from the container doesn't affect anyone else's, then that's silly.
---
I got helped a lot at lower levels by high level players  wandering by ....I'm not sure how many people I likely owe a thanks to for killing scorchbeasts that had me pinned down in a house or bus .
---
players that dropped off water , food or ammo (I got my first 1 star from another player ) 
---
now I'm high level and I love scooting around the map and dropping off extra supplies and gear to the lower level crowd .
---
and always keep a few low level legendaries on hand for new folks .
---
Here's the thing. PvP et al are features that were actively talked about pre-release. Alongside features like C.A.M.P and the setting these were clear design decisions on display from the start.
---
Now, there are other sets of criticism you could put into the 'oversights' category. Such things as text chat, reconnect to previous server, weapon mod acquisition balancing, all those smaller QoL and balance changes that absolutely could do with a tune up.
---
So from these two sets you have two groups of features for players to mull over:
---
* Features that can be reasonably sussed out before purchase. E3, Quakecon, press releases.
---
* Features that require playing to suss out. Ingame 'look&amp;feel', non-flagship features.
---
Now, if people are buying regardless of features from group A then where is the incentive to change them? The money has already changed hands. Are you going to buy Fallout 76 again if it changes? And everyone that doesn't have the game yet has the same information that the paying player does. Changing the game doesn't alter the publicly available design style of the game, and the current design is clearly good enough to sell it to people that don't like a particular feature anyway.
---
Now for group B. If people are buying without knowing (because knowing ahead of time is impossible) then there is incentive to change. These issues bleed into the public domain and could potentially impact sales because you don't know if a person who did buy the game and is now complaining would have bought it at all if they knew beforehand.
---
At the end of the day the dev team leads and the management team will sit in a room and ask 'Do we want to devote resources to making a change that does not seem to impact the willingness of people to buy the game?'
---
I've already got the electrified one from PeniSlug. I would happily take the normal one from you.
---
If they do, they must include the 
---
roving trader outfit. It is the back bone of 
---
fallout 3. 
---
You on PS4 
---
Vats is important for SB only due to crits being so useful.
---
My Lever-Action chunks their health if I use my crit on their head. 
---
Sorry that you feel offended by the idea that people can enjoy bad things without them being good things.
---
Happy Birthday, hope it's a good one!
---
Ya, the loot in the box is the same for everyone now, if someone gets to it first and takes it, it's empty.  Before it was instanced loot for every player.
---
I am thinking that was the main goal of the change.  The locking and subsequent bounty for picking one that isn't yours was there to make sure that the calling player had a higher change to actually get their own drop.  And penalize those that took the drop that wasn't theirs.
---
Without the penalty, the calling player would be out of luck more often.
---
I'm on PC, but thanks anyways
---
Oops I didn’t realise! Makes more sense now, thanks for clarifying :)
---
What's your gamer tag? Is there anything you need/want in return?
---
what the hell did i just watch
---
I rarely craft and repair stuff now that I started up another character. I hit level 21 and i've basically just been cycling through found and quest reward equipment, even if it kinda sucks. My screws and adhesive always seems to hover around 80-100 no matter how much I scrap.  
---
Overleveled enemies just because another player is within a 500 meters of you is pretty BS though. My camp and questing zones are constantly getting flooded with level 50-68 enemies just because some level 50+ player fast traveled close-ish to where I am or where i'm going.
---
And waaaaay too much stash room for the number of items. Pre-update, you could barely store 1 suit in there unless you were careful. 
---
Thanks for the tag and the detailed report! Documenting each of these to see where they're at internally.
---
If they wanted to get fancy they could activate all your CAMPs decorative appliances and lights when in town. Your sink gives water, your fridge keeps food cold etc. You pay X caps per instance or per week for the services. Put it near Grafton Dam to justify having water and electric. Hold periodic events. 
---
Shit, have a Halloween party just like they did on October 23rd, 2077...
---
Heck I straight up bought some pricey plans for a level 30something last night off Grahm during a blast zone at Whitesprings. I still do my daily vendor grind, but it's feeling less and less necessary, as my main character nears the cap cap, and my mule is close too.
---
Personally, I hate this idea. So many of the suggestions I see on this sub involve changing the game so that players will get maximum benefit with minimal effort.  If you're taking over workshops, then that should be part of your playing strategy for that session.
---
Just my opinion.  I don't expect it to be a popular one, so I am prepared for downvotes haha 
---
As mentioned before, if you or anyone on your team claims a workshop it automatically opens you and your team up to pvp without slap damage. Or if someone on your team hits the person that kills you or their teammates, all members of the teams go into pvp. Pacifist only makes it so you can not do damage to other players, it does not turn off pvp. As far as bypassing slap damage to one shot someone I have never experienced or seen it happen. I have heard it it possible especially when you were allowed to stack Bobbleheads. 
---
So if you truly do not to pvp, do not take workshops and do not play on a team where others take workshops. 
---
Like is there like cultists plan for like for the c.a.m.p to build stuff 
---
Orr the high levels that decimate an event so no-one else gets loot
---
I don't need anything. I'll jump on your game. Let me know when you are on
---
What's the benefit of Ultracite? It has the second best overall scores: 
---
* Roughly tied for first in Ballistic (with T-51b)
---
* Third for energy (behind T-51b and X-01)
---
* Third for rad (behind X-01 and T-60) 
---
I was initially concerned about repair costs, but power armor rarely needs repairs, and ultracite is just lying around next to fissure sites. My larger problem is how much harder it is to get mods than for the T-51b or T-60. 
---
I rate the best PA as T-51b outside nuke zones and X-01 inside nuke zones, but I use T-60 in nuke zones because it's easier to mod than the X-01. 
---
My T-51b defense is in the low 600's for ballistic and energy, and high 300's for rads.  My T-60 defense is in the mid 500's for ballistic and energy, and high 400's for rads. 
---
You can sorta do this already on XBox.
---
If you get booted, you can go to the "Social" menu, choose "Recent," pick a recent player you encountered, and Join their world.
---
It doesn't work if they've hopped servers, or the server itself has crashed, or if you're first opening the game.  But it's something.
---
The option is also there on PC, although I've never tested it out on PC.
---
If you’re on Xbox I can hook you up with a stimpak recipe 
---
Hey leave him alone.  He's busy being overly dramatic.
---
2 Hrs to gather wood, lol, smh
---
So true! I have to add that to the list. Though they do look similar to the BoS Scribe outfits.
---
Not a problem sorry I couldn’t help you out 
---
Are you sure you know which items have screws? Cus I'm level 24 and I have 250+ screws all the time.
---
Well unhappy cake day to you. 
---
Nice thanks 
---
They don't patch every week. If one was announced, then yes. If not, then no. As for the weekly event, give it a few hours it might just be running behind.
---
Hey, wastelanders!  A few weeks back, /u/lordbaronstein modded the legs of my brother and I's Excavators with calibrated shocks.  We had limited materials, but he made it happen at a reasonable price and they've been incredibly durable as we stomp around Appalachia hauling 400lbs of junk at a time.
---
This guy is aces, and absolutely the epitome of a dedicated RPG'er.  One of the best folks I've encountered in the community.
---
And damn, today's deal?  The coveted calibrated shocks!
---
Thanks for everything, /u/lordbaronstein.

My friend and I are in my base in the process of executing him because he didn't want anyone to take his bounty. Like any good friend would, I suggested that he stripped down so that his armor won't break, and deposit his junk into a nearby stash box. He kneels down, I recite the Game of Thrones execution sentencing, we laugh as my High Rise smashes him Robert Baratheon style, and then we see a lower level outside of my locked door. 
---
We think it's a little weird, and so we ignore him. I get a message from him asking if I had spare gears to give away. We didn't think he was a threat and so I let him in, dug through my stash box, and that's when I had this great idea that if he "slapped some beeee-asss, mon" then I would give him 40(?) gears. My friend and I were laughing hysterically thinking he wasn't going to do it, but lo and behold he hops on the bass, and now we're laughing even harder. I jumped on the piano and my friend was on drums. Pictures were shared, and I gave him his gears. He took off and that was it. Sometimes the game can surprise you about how great it can be with moments like this. 
---
TL;DR: low level asks for spare gears while watching me execute my friend at my base. I gave him the gears after he jammed out with us slapping some bass. 
---
Is that the way it works? If your luck is up and you find a weapon, that weapon is permanently more break resistant?
---
Globes, typewriters, clipboards etc etc, I know. 
---
Just hit level 20 some days ago (been playing for a while but I mostly take it easy and slow) and I have nothing but positive experiences from high level players. I was given away plenty of chems, mostly stimpacks and radx, and a few nice weapons. One guy even saved my  when I was being overwhelmed by a mob of supermutants in Grafton during the 'protest march' event, another one did the same when I was succumbing to the 1st scorched wave of 'collision course'.  
---
I try to pay it forward by putting chems I don't use into first aid containers all around the toxic valley, which is the area I'm currently stationed at and my favorite 'biome' so far, albeit a bit rough.
---
Because OP doesn't want to have to travel back to the workshop to actually claim the materials being extracted
---
Mothman stuff on the Atom Shop.  That's about it, I think.  Not very "Creepy Twisted Nature Shrine" like in the various spots around Appalachia though.
---
The stairs are pointless anyway since they snap to the middle of the floor instead of either side. #mildlyinfuriating
---
Aw really well thank you so much!!!
---
Yes. The only thing I hoard is stimpacks (I have a problem, even with ~200+ I feel like I never have enough.) everything else I keep ~20-30 and the rest gets sold off to vendors. 
---
&gt; It's easy to create &amp; send a snapshot
---
&gt; it's fairly easy to check out someone's Reputation/Sales history here on Reddit.
---
Why on earth should anyone have to do any of this though... Seems the easy option would be to just let me inspect the item before trading, like every other game that allows player trading
---
But I have the blade and the dagger cultists  plan 
---
If you go into your inventory there is a way to make items with junk you need in it appear with a magnifying glass icon.
---
This is interesting.  Unfortunately, I typically play alone so I dont really ever see this but good to know for the future.
---
I've been attacked by this thing on three separate occasions trying to defend the ammunition factory.
---
I still have nightmares.
---
maybe there will be NPC's, maybe I will get a raise, maybe this is a lie
---
Yea, BUT i like it for the items that hangs from my hip. The cups, silver spoons &amp; forks. It has so much detail that other ones dont have. 
---
What level you at?
---
It's brought up and on their list to do.  But they also said there were other factors than time that determined the success/failure, so they had to look into it more to make something more useful.  Would suck to show up to an event that said it had 10 minutes left only to see it was 1 second away from failure anyway.  Wouldn't accomplish much.
---
I wish they'd drop the "So you were banned" sticky and return the "Known Issues/Bugs" Sticky that contains all these Beth responses.
---
You shouldn't even be given the option to join an event if you won't be able to get rewarded...
---
Bethesda has stated they do not want people to be able to build too close to any existing structure. This was obviously an oversight on their part as it's unintended to be able to build five feet from the back of the biggest spawn point in the entire game. Also, anytime a new players spawns into the area, the ghouls will instantly run out of the building, thus being killed by the terrorists. When the player is not there at their house, no one will get any experience, and they will all be dead. It's basically making it harder to find the enemies to kill them. Even worse, it makes it exploitative during a nuke event! You can literally farm legendaries without spending any ammunition or even being harmed, gaining a serious advantage over every other player
---
I don't know what timezone you are, I'm GMT though.
---
Is 88 an alarming number to you? 
---
I can't decide if you are really too slow to pick up on the fact that they are trying to sound like they are from West Virginia (which, oddly enough, is where the term "redneck" originated from. Pretty neat story, but we are not depicting union rebels)
---
Ok, that sucks.  I've got like 50 of those drop holotapes, just never really bother to use them.
---
there's a partially hidden passageway way down at the bottom of the mine that leads to something pretty interesting.
---
Didn’t Skyrim have explosive bolts for xbow?
---
&gt; I love seeing items on sale for 24 hours in the Atom Shop
---
Then their bullshit predatory sales tactics are working. There is no shortage of digital pixels, there is no reason for sales at all. You're being played so you fork over your (or your parents) money. 
---
I don't take loot from players that died to mobs. That's just mean.  My point is don't carry enough junk that losing it means your experience gets ruined.  I haven't been able to retrieve my loot many times due to unforseen circumstances, so I deposit in stash boxes asap.  If someone asks, I usually return theur stuff especially if they were wanted as I enjoy PvP and making friends, not greifing players.  However, if you're walking around with 1k steel and 200 of every other mat my sympathy quickly diminshes and my greed takes over. 
---

Its like an hour to drive from Pittsburgh to Morgantown, there is a reason the football game between Pitt and WVU is called the backyard brawl. You can do it by bike in less than 9 hours according to google maps.

Dang. That's impressive. How's the condition on those 78s? 
---
I've been making an effort to call one in every time I go to a Relay Tower.  Which I try to once a day.  Even if I don't pick it up.
---
Lovecraftian horror has always been a thing in Bethesda games and thus also in the Fallout universe.
---
For the love of all that is holy DON'T AQUIRE TILL YOUVE HIT LEVEL 50
---
It’s just a natural progression for shotguns to make them accept slugs. All they would need to do is create a slug receiver and the ammunition. 
---
World of Warcraft had/has a great system for enchanting or modding other player's gear: a separate part of the trade window for items that were not going to be traded. 
---
Maybe something like that could be worked into the game.
---
I typically play alone too.  Doesn't matter, you still get the list.
---
When I say "encountered," I mean "shared the same server with."  You don't have to actually interact with them for it to count.
---
I'd prefer the old model, where everything is included in the base game, zero macrotransactions - and then I pay for future DLC's as they release.
---
Level 5, I think? Been a bit busy so haven’t been on for a few days :))
---
A level 3 will give you 1000 rounds per FC I have not noticed it improve weapon degeneration.
---
Covered under humanoids I believe.
---
In my experience head shots do *slightly* more.
---
If you get the Rank 2 Armorer perk, it removes the Ballistic Fiber requirement from all armor crafts until Max Level (45/50).  It's almost a MUST for new players to get if you plan on crafting armor.
---
It also makes it much better at low levels to Scrap broken armor and craft new ones than it is to Repair.  Cause the repairing of those level 25-40 armors still require Ballistic Fiber.
---
If you're going to do something like that then do it properly. Place your camp near a very traveled area such as Whitesprings Station or Watoga Station and then just build like 20 sirens in a circle and power them all on at the same time.
---
It's beautiful.
---
We're aware of this one and looking into it. Thanks for your report!
---
Saw another one last night there. He was level 37, and only had machine guns, but it's still sad. 
---
Yeah going to do some testing will try to have number later this week.

---
 Long Shot should feature some weight reduction. The perk compares similarly to the shotgun perk Scattershot which includes accuracy improvements and weight reduction.
---
Once you stop having to craft guns to scrap and get mods, your screw stock pile balloons.
---
Now I'm at 550 screws.  Before I was always under 100.  When you have to craft up 25+ guns to try to get that Hardened Receiver mod it chews through those screws you get quickly (10+ screws per craft...)
---
ah yeah that sucks, i use to be on pc gaming but honestly i found i was spending too much on upgrades every other year for a single person. 
---
FO76 was totally an impulse buy too on thanksgiving cause it was on sale for 40.00, I picked up a tricentennial on sale too so i got the whole thing (minus the bag) for the regular price. I also picked up another copy for my kids and between 2 copies we have it installed on 4 xboxs, that covers 5 fallout accounts. 
---
/u/LadyDevann can you please pass this feedback on to the team? It seriously needs to be reviewed. People are literally exploiting an area that should not allow building too close. You can literally build five feet from the back of the building 
---
We're aware of this one and looking into it, thanks for the report!
---
The human-centaur-pede
---
Thats weak.
---
Build 10, on rugs, glitch them in to things he doesn't want to delete. Make the wiring convoluted enough you have to take out multiple power lines and power sources to shut the array down.
---
Double the chance I disconnect before it even drops? Eh
---
it takes no skill no talent and removes the best spawning area for the entire server
---
Your patches for the game is paying off fallout 76 was £25 in the uk now it's £35 well done I'm happy for u and keep it up from a fellow fallout fan to u also add weapon mods for power armour
---
Pretty sure I have a level 5 Vampire pipe rifle if ya want 
---
Psn Merlance 
---
Wont be on till later though.
---
I'm going to use my jetpack to fly up to the top of my friends' CAMP buildings, placing the Sirens up there.  Then power them up.
---
They won't even know where it is coming from.  They don't even know Sirens exist.
---
Yep standard mag size 500 bumps to 1000 with power user. IDK about life. Will test it soon 
---
That crossed my mind. I guess you could do it either way (seen both done currently). For example: you sell me junk x y z for 0 caps, ill make mod and sell to you for 10. Or ill sell you the mod for 30. If its premade, I guess you could have them sell you the junk and reduce the sell price (but youd have to go reference something that lists out the materials, since you dont see that in the trade menu).
---
Personally I kind of hate having to list out all the mats I need for them to give me. Id rather just sell for caps, and if im short one material, knock a few caps off or something.
---
The main thing is it eliminates the need to pass armor/weapons back and forth, while accomplishing the same goal.
---
Damn. This game be like that sometimes man, I’m sorry
---
Well they said they were making the Queen drops more “legendary”. Obviously that didn’t work.  That’s almost as good as the drill I got off the three star Colonel Gutsy at AWOL Armaments. It’s incredibly frustrating that they remove flare guns but not drills and syringers from the loot tables. 
---
Find a junk pile to build on and always cap Charleston landfill workshop. Maybe get gorge junkyard too. That's 1 to 5 junk extractors yippy could be collecting on. Most of the time when i empty the one at my camp i get a handful of screws.  Not alot bbit it adds up. Also resist the urge to modify everything you make. At that level i really only put on sight mods because most of the iron sights i find hard to use. And even with out perks in melee just make a melee weapon or two for back ups to conserve ammo. I like pool cues with a sharp mod. Takes wood steel and adhesive and weighs less than a pound. Just go around poking all those low level scorched and scoop ip the copious amounts of ammo. Screws are a progress gate, meant to keep you groom having everything too fast. They want you to take a break from craftng and quests and farm and explore.
---
It was less than 8bit and the name of the game was “Adventure” for the Atari 2600
---
I think that rifles already have the most perk cards of all weapon classes. If you add another perk card to the mix it makes rifle characters less versatile. You have even less perk cards to give flavour to your character.
---
Thanks, buddy- you're doing great work.
---
Also... I forgot that you made a housecall to my sky fortress to deliver my bro's brick shithouse T60 and jetpack!  ❤👍
---
My Berserker runs 0/0/1000. I have autostim perk and use Serendipity and Blocker to mitigate almost every other hit. 
---
Stealthing and using crit hits help me avoid enemies.
---
During scorch queen I pop Stealth Boy 3's and M of M devices to stay perma hidden. 
---
Berseker weapons give me a 50% damage boost on top of perk card load outs
---
Cost Nothing to repair literally! 
---
Also gives me a constant sense of urgency when crawling around with ~~high~~ **any** level enemies!
---
Bothers me so much when whiners cry and call others "cheater" and "exploiter" when it's just someone doing something they don't approve of but is totally legit in the game.
---
I'm going to hide them ontop of the two story buildings they have, with power connectors going up the side from the back half of the building they use to feed their purifiers.  They won't know where they are, where they are being fed from, or that Sirens even exist.
---
Is that why people shoot me on sight? Lol I never knew I was getting a bounty every time I randomly came across an aid drop.
---
They have explosive harpoons, I don’t see why it would be that hard to do the same for crossbows. 
---
I’m afraid it’s only the Enclave faction vendor in the Enclave Bunker in the Military wing
---
I need to offload a lot of junk materials, since I don't really use them on my Berserker build (a bit to repair weapons that's it...)
---
Feel free to add me on Xbox (GT: nnaatteedd), my crew and I like to provide escort services to wanderers in need.
---
If you're on XBox give me a call... GT RCInvictusX. Happy to take on the bounty.
---
Oh wow, thank you so much! I’ll send you a friend request when I go on :)
---
I used to accept random invites to help people out, but the last time I did that I was in Watoga station. They were at Charleston, so I figured they just wanted cheap travel, but I noticed on the map that they fast traveled to my base. I fast traveled back to watch for mischief, and they started trashing my base just after I arrived. I was done playing anyways, so I logged out. I logged back in to minimal damage, so no big loss, but I don't want to have to babysit the randos.

Pretty sure they are going to use the Legendary Player system to keep players between 50-100 and boosting themselves outside of the leveling system.
---
I did not know that, thanks for that info! 
---
I bought a 2.5 terabyte solid state hard drive from Best Buy for $65 and plugged it into one of the USB ports in the front. Transferred the whole game to it and updates go to it also. My little 500 gig PS4 was DONE after the beta download, lol.
---
Fallout is a single player franchise. I don't recognize this as a legitimate game. MMORPGs are so 2001.
---
on ps4, but it is the one reason I ever get a bounty....
---
When I largely had no idea what the hell I was doing in this game in regard to getting power armor fully modded, u/lordbaronstein very kindly provided assistance and was very helpful. He's since modded two additional sets for me, which I regifted to other players that needed the help too. Thanks for making that happen.
---
Also you should know that trying to kill low levels is literally not rewarding. I get very few caps. I go after the level 200+.  They seek revenge a few times and I'm a thousand caps richer.  Also on my low level alts since damage is made equal I engage in PvP with much higher levels, they have more confidence.
---
Those Responders to the rescue, per the norm. Thanks pal, happy trails! 
---
Yeah, I have my camp on a junk pile + I always take the landfill. Lately though, screws just haven't been dropping from those.
---
I usually only modify my guns with better receivers and the sights, too. 
---
Glad to hear some positivity, &amp; glad you are enjoying it. The game has its' issues like anything else, but at the end of the day it comes down to what you like. :)
---
Enjoy! 👍
---
 Only the unbattered clipboards have screws and they are extremely rare.
---
What kind of life is this? Lol 
---
At lower levels, Camp McClintock can give a few ballistic fibers, plus springs.  Then Charleston Capital building and It's neighbor, Riverside Manor is pretty good for screws.  
---
I used to do a rout, hit McClintock and Summersville then go to Charleston and Riverside and repeat got a ton of springs, screws and ballistic fiber.
---
I've been attacked by glitchy longboyes at the Red Rocket workshop and also at my CAMP. It takes patience and a lot of stims but they can be killed if you time VATS shots properly.
---
Make new armor. Repairing it is too expensive.
---
It bugs the hell out of me that swapping to a new mod destroys the other one. You don't even get scrap for it. It just evaporates.
---
Also the Relay Tower outside Flatwoods (directly West) has Two Military Ammo Bag spawns.  One by the Skeleton outside the front door, one by the foot locker on the back right door inside.
---
You can occasionally find more inside the lockers, etc.  But that's random and instanced.  The two ammo bags are always there (as long as someone didn't get there before you, in which case... server hop).
---
If you get those each time you log in at low levels, you should have a nice supply to do some stuff with them as needed.  Two first aid kits, one locked (level 0) that tend to have a nice supply of Stimpaks.
---
Enemies in the area are level 1-8.  Four Turrets on the outside walls.  One level 8 Crowned Mr. Handy.  1-2 level 5 Protectrons.  1-2 Level 1 Sentry Bots.
---
In before OP is banned for using bethesda IP on the cake
---
Yeah I offloaded a lot of material and aid to an alt the other day. But I acquired just as much and now have to do it again. Lol. It really is a issue needing to pick up EVERYTHING you see. But never know when you might need it. 
---
Really kind of puts a damper on the argument "You don't need to buy atoms!  Just do challenges!"
---
There's still challenges bugged since launch
---
Mothman is a little bitch 
---
FO76 sux bro, why discuss? If gamers weren't such whores with low standards we could stop this shit in its tracks.
---
They aren't cheating or exploiting.  You are just unable to deal with a game that has competition for resources.
---
They are not ruining the game.  Their are inconveniencing other players by being first to a resource and helping themselves.
---
For now, at least, Bethesda is saying this is ok but letting it stand.  Bethesda has provided a in-game mechanic for you to challenge another player's actions.  Destroy the base.  The consequence is you get flagged for PvP.  If you don't wish to do this, Bethesda also allows you to switch servers to try to find one without this situation.
---
I go to WS, there is 3 players in the clubhouse with sledges all higher level than me.  I try to tag some ghouls but for the most part the team of 3 ends up 1 shot killing everything before I can get to it.  I'm frustrated, inconvenienced.  MY EXPERIENCES IS RUINED (lol).  I would luuuuuv to challenge them but I'm much weaker.  I hop servers and find an instance of WS that isn't being "hogged" by other players.  This is all by game design.  Design can change but nobody here did anything wrong, nor cheated, nor exploited.  It is just the nature of the game.
---
"...sabotaging others play experience."  what a joke.  You're sabotaging my reddit experience with this post lol.
---
It'd be neat to be able to set a route for the bot to take. Like select fast travel nodes as steps for the bot to take. So you'd check the map, see where people aren't, then setup the route accordingly. Might take a while, depending on the route, but that guarantees safe delivery.
---
Dang you've done like ever weekly since launch haha. 
---
I like this. A battle like the SBQ is supposed to be epic. You need to have time to prep and really get in the feel, whether that id quietly preping your gear or showing up to the site to clear scorched. Y'know?
---
Where is the asylum
---
Even I, a non PvP gal, have started attacking such bases. But I suppose some peeps do it on purpose to start fights 😂😂
---
It’s a mixed bag. The 12” 78 is practically unplayed probably because it was a non-standard size for a jazz record.
---
In general, Fallout 76’s soundtrack is leaning older with more songs from the 30s than any other Fallout game combined. These 78s are a bit harder to find and can be a bit more worn. Several songs are supposed to have been issued on blue shellac, showing that the colored vinyl trend is nothing new.
---
3 took the middle ground with 40s and 50s. 4 leaned more into 50s and 60s. New Vegas is far and away the newest with recordings made in the 60s, 70s, 80, 90s, and 00s.
---
I should farm helmets?
---
I stopped playing...
---
Yeah, but do you really want that as a Perception perk?
---
F this thread. Give me my 10 minutes back.
---
I have not been able to complete all but 1 of the "Discover Locations" set even though all map markers have been discovered, and 7600 hours for 20 atoms, wtf, that's over 3 years of 24/7 game play.
---
I think you're confused? It was only posted once...
---
Why do you still come gere then
---
Grahm belongs to the same faction as Watoga station, and responder bot is in the responders faction ;)
---
I try but they always run. TAKE MY PLANS DAMMIT
---
What's unfair about using turrets to kill enemies?
---
This is a PvP game whether you like it or not.  A number of game mechanics are in there purposefully to not only encourage PvP, but to require it.
---
Pick flowers 2 weeks in a row for 40 points .. kill huge creature last week.. and now the god damned take a picture at lakes counting up til 4 and not popping after taking pics at the 5th .I am so godamn tired of this fucking game not working. Road map is not even slightly impressive if you can't fix these simple issues. 
---
I really hope they don't do that. Imo Lovecraftian monsters are best described then actually shown, the curiosity makes it much more intimidating
---
I completely agree with not passing around my "valuables" to any shady characters.
---
I'm all in on this idea, whatever form it takes. I can see this quickly turning into a tiered system similar to real suppliers/customers where tier 2 sells bulked mats to tier 1 who makes mods who sells to general public. Each tier has their associated markup and everyone gets what they want.
---
... where do I sign up
---
This guy right here helped me get my T51 power armour built just the way I wanted. I was dreading the process.
---
I may even have to get a suit of raider armour upgraded shortly. ;)
---
Glad your enjoying it, I love it and have played every day since the Beta even if only squeezing in an hour or two and I’m still discovering new things, the roadmap looks really promising and I can’t wait to see what they bring us with new content, there’s been the odd bug that’s caused frustration along the way but not anything that’s made me want to stop playing or couldn’t be worked around in some way, on the whole it’s been a very positive experience and I hope they continue supporting the game for years to come cause I’m a total addict lol
---
Wait, hold on a second... Does over-repairing affect the stats, rather than just the durability?
---
It's got laser beams, power armor, heavy weapons and a fkin nuke. There's too much awesome in a 4x6. Would be nice if these could be printed easier.
---
&gt;shows your salt
---
is op who is only posting salt
---
Yeah, love the game too!
---
Where do I get the outfits and I have 3 industrial water tanks which give a max of 5 purified waters but how many waters would I sell to get close to 200 caps from just one vender I have hard bargain maxed and charisma at 9 I just need a great way to get to or close to the 1400 daily sell
---
It would also be quite helpful if all mods require no skill or just level 1 skill to apply said pre-made mod. Otherwise players buy mods they cannot equip and blame the seller.
---
It gets a little confusing sometime to figure out what is the best mod selection for a particular playing style and i ‘m glad that i could help. You are always welcome! 
---
Yeah, no. The potential for abuse of that system is far too high. That's a terrible idea. 
---
No problem. The PS4 will format it for you then plan on it taking forever to move files but it works like a charm.
---
Agree, thats what I do if I find someone irritating. Hopefully those peoples will move to pvp servers and pvp will be disabled permanently on adveture servers
---
Justice being served.
---
Plot twist:. The FO3 remaster is a FO76 expansion
---
Ahh didn't know that. Thanks
---
Ultra-light Torso certainly used to be in the scrap mod list. Probably a bug, because none of the other Ultra-light mods were in there.

And I would love to play with a Furbie and wear Jinko pants but it's not 1990 anymore. 
---
Jesus Christ those were terrible examples!
---
The 90's sucked! 
---
But you get the point 
---
I noticed yesterday, when i added in another power core into my suit, it all of a sudden says the suit then had like 16 power cores! but, it was just a visual glitch as when i took off the suit to reinspect it, i only had the one core...
---
i was pretty excited there for a bit lol
---
Everyone has a different play style but, lvl 100+ turret camps behind the clubhouse is about the only thing that has made me want to wreck a camp, I haven't but it sure is tempting. 
---
I still envy that The Flying Fortress. It’s higher than the top of the world! Next time we should do some bbq with scorchbeast steaks. New river red ale’s are on me!   
---
Turn Pacifist on in your settings. Problem solved. 
---
First they need more items. But whose to say if you already own the sale item? Would you still want to see it? Or would you want an item random per individual?
---
If lack of content makes you act like a dick, you were a dick to start with.
---
That'd be a great idea.  Right now I just add a floor sticking out from my building, but an actual turret mount that'd hit things right underneath it would be wonderful.
---
when i get the option to try another world, invariably it gets stuck on a never ending loading screen
---
i found best way is jsut back out and retry like the old way
---
and people complain about not being able to kill the sbq chuck norris ya good luck scratching him ;)
---
I love this idea. I like the blueprint part as well but feel maybe we should be allowed a main camp that we can set up at a town or out in the wilds but also have a travelling camp that allows only bare essentials for repairs on the go and storage. Other than that I would upvote your post all day long if I could.
---
You guys could even combine it with another often requested feature, the display of available mods for a weapon.
---
Just add a new crafting category at each workbench where you can see available ones but need to have learned them to be able to craft them (much like the current C.A.M.P. items works, you can see but not craft them).
---
This way you would show all available plans for a specific weapon, motivate people to actually trade for mods and reduce the amount of weapons a player needs to craft in hope to get every mod plan which could reduce stress on the servers too
---
Oh yeah i remember it. Happy that i could help. We should get you a mighty raider with some reactive plates. It looks sick! 
---
Related- I can't wait to open up a distillery when the DLC hits. 
---
grinding for plans/mod
---
you may have accidentally put your camp on an enemy spawning hotspot, or one that is programmed to generate random encounters... my only advice it to move your camp and see if that helps..
---
I hope you go bind if the proof is too high
---
It would be nice to even see some acknowledgement from @Bethesda regarding which challenges are broken.
---
My combat chest can be made ultra light as I have that on my combat armour atm and it must be learned from scrapping as I wouldn’t have bought that plan. That would have been before the vendors changed to having more plans and static inventories though so I don’t know if anything’s changed
---
Are there patch notes for today? I can't seem to find anything.
---
I thought it was the cult of the interloper
---
Speaking of selling stuff to each other, it would be great if the caps slider could pass from 25000 over to 0 the way it does from 0 to 25000
---
Also, most of that 5GB is replacing other existing files on the hard drive, outside of new atomic shop items, the new data is taking the place of previous data, and once the patch executes, the download is marked by the console to be overwritten by new data.
---
The fact that there isn't much end game content is what puts so many people off.    
---
I am playing the game with my brother and am level 10 and its a blast.  
---
My level 100 just does busy work and has no real purpose.  But you have a long time to play before you get to that point.  And most people forget it takes dozens of hours until you reach end game - and that's still a great amount of game play for the money. (Compare to like crackdown 3!)
---
I’ll be on the line for a dirty wastelander for sure if they ever decide to put it back in haha 
---
It would be better if players had to dress up in Ritual gear, and sacrifice other players in his chamber using a Cultist Dagger in order to wake him up.
---
That would be Ohio, Pittsburgh is to the north west of Wv.
---
This is a great list! I wish I'd have seen it sooner... Learning all this on my own playing through was a long and tedious and very wasteful process. Do you know if all of the updates that the game has had over the last couple months affected the accuracy of the numbers?
---
I completely understand I run pacifist mode turned on, and turn it off just to break those bases turrets
---
hmmm.. amount of damage was not a requirement before.. is this a new thing that you are suggesting?
---
I was seeing the spinning wheel before streaming.. I only streamed the end of this experience to get video proof. 
---
And in the video you can see the legendary do its full heal one time... the insta-heal bug is different. it is instant healing that only undoes the damage you just inflicted. It is also seen in the video, separate from the full heal.
---
PVP
---
I understand where your coming from and I know this game is designed to be played for a very long time, but disliking changes because they may make the game less grindy seems sadistic. 
---
Breath of the Wild DLC confirmed??
---
Wow! It’s almost like this idea has been around and posted daily for like 3 months now? 
---
Seriously, this sub needs to start cracking down on duplicate threads because I’m so tired of seeing the same damn topics. 
---
It's a huge if, but I would love the next expantion to be Oak Ridge TN.
---
Where, Why? Oak ridge TN is the home of Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the Y12 National Laboratory this is where the US goverment builds and dismantles all of our nuclear stock pile. We also send other countries nuclear capablities once we have disarmed them here.
---
This would be the main goal to use or disarm the big nukes.
---
It the other side of the application mountains so you can keep the general feel of the game.  
---
As far as lore in the are, I would love to see them us the evil dead shack its in the area. A vault build around UT's body farm. They could give it a real horror feel.
---
I get the point but I respectfully disagree with it. We have modern examples of "the old model" and I just prefer it. Something like Witcher 3, you buy the game - you get a full amazing game. Then the DLC comes out and you buy that, and you get a full amazing DLC. That's the model I prefer, this always online games as a service model with promises of "Free dlc" and insane prices on mundane nonsense just irks me and I don't want to support that sort of system. I have no qualms with those who want to pay $18 bucks to paint their power armor blue, but personally I prefer the Buy standalone full game, then buy DLC after it's completed model. 
---
Bless this post. 
---
It was as not marketed as having pvp as a main feature. Me, and many others, assumed it would be optional. And then you get killed through slap damage while crafting. 
---
Camp Town race track 5 miles long... 
---
Weapons and armor only level up to 50, regardless of the player's level (this in part is why a level 50 can easily be on par with a level 200 as the gear for both tops at 50).  It would be pointless to create encounters for level 100+ without first increasing the level of said weapons and armor first.
---
I just don't wear armor/power armor. Just stay nice and cozy in a level 1 hazmat suit (they don't break).
---
Going to start carrying orbital strikes 😍🦄
---
Lets make an XB crew that marauders around the servers taking out whitesprings camps!
---
It’s not easy to find if you don’t know where to look. They hid it rather well. Once I caught wind of it I had to look up a video on YouTube because I wandered around down there for an hr looking.
---
Not only that, but if you are in the northern panhandle of Wv, the drive to Pittsburgh is only like 30-45 minutes.
---

check the next few ITVs
---
It's not necessarily that, throughout the game you see cargobots flying everywhere. Most factions used them for their own personal game. Why can't we, the players. Using it as a way to transport stuff between a workshop and your base seemed like a good what to introduce it.
---
Its because you started playing it a week ago. There is still stuff for you to do, kinda. These 'hey im Noob-Noob and the game hasnt exposed its ugly wounds to me yet' posts are cute
---
Happy birthday!🎁
---
Enjoy getting your ass handed to those lv.50 Major Gutsies that the game likes to spawn, then =D
---
Well you're no fun.
---
There are people that need a constant stream of new contents and others who don't,or at least not at the pace of a new game every week.
---
No shame in being either of them.
---
Many toys have screws as well. Hot plates also? For sure tag screws for search if you haven’t already.
---
It's fort defiance
---
I know also making a new armor gives me more durability with the perks I have. 
---
Love it. Need it!
---
This would definitely combine well with trading, creating something akin to a small hub. And proper defenses would make it a safe zone to truly rest and/or plan a next adventure.
---
If my stealth breaks I do indeed ~~run away screaming~~ die! 
---
Lol, so um not the only one who finds them so annoying😂
---
I thought I was done but now all o do is take over player ownedworkshops. Lots of tense situations with hiding.
---
The horse is long dead, can you please stop beating it? 
---
2 months? That bug existed in FO4. So that bug has been around a lot longer than 2 months. That bug has been around for 4 years, since FO4 came out in 2015.
---
 Yes it does. The faster the weapon the more it does. My Mr Handy Buzz went from 17 to 49. My Combat Knives gain about 30% and my Shiskabab went from 65 Ballistic to 100.
---
I hope this wasn't stable
---
Ah I didnt think of that. 
---
Mods require skill levels to attach? Its been a while since ive attached a mod (item) to a piece, all my personal modding is done from learned parts
---
Indeed it was, otherwise it wouldn't have dropped, I was and still am, gutted

Good thing it has no CND, you can take time to enjoy it
---
Oh man I really want all of these, but especially the Fallout promos. I preordered the game but didn’t hear anything about this. Was it vendor specific?
---
with 5 stars.
---
That's one thing u don't take out in the open..that needs to be stashed immediately the other day I was walking around with 100 ballistic fiber ..without realizing
---
It's fun, more so with friends!
---
Probably to be reminded as to why he shouldnt play. I still play tho, I must for my friend plays it with me.
---
I actually got like 300 with the woodchucker perk. In like 2 server hops I had thousands of wood heh.
---
Yeah that's what the announcement post said on the website. I then did a search for pvp on this reddit before posting my questions, and saw that thousands of people supported a post explicitly asking Beteshda to let us start new characters and a Beteshda mod answered they'd take in that suggestion, so I wondered if there maybe was news on them changing that.
---
That drops 5* nunchucks 
---
This guy right here is the man, has helped my and my guys out on a lot of things for our power armor. 
---
He is polite he will answer your questions not like some of the others not so nice people on here ( had to keep it PG)
---
He has great prices with or without mats 
---
Definitely going to come back everytime I need something done. 
---
A great example is Tuco's teeth in Rage. Breaking Bad was huge during development. Someone put the cube with his teeth on a shelf in the sherrifs evidence locker.
---
Even with armor, those things tear thru it.  (I think their bullets have really high armor penetration values)
---
I hate me some Mr. Gutsys.  Also those turrets on the top floor of the AMS Headquarters in Watoga.  In fact, that whole AMS Headquarters with its Radiation ticks, Gutsys, half a dozen turrets with armor penetrating bullets filed around a narrow stairway leading into the area...
---
My first time going there sucked!
---
I just don't like the idea of building my camp in a decent spot only to have it surrounded 20 minutes later by four people who have decided they want that spot. 4 on 1 is where this would end up. Because it's an MMO. So yeah, sorry, but no thanks. 
---
I know that most pf us dont like that and to be honest instead of being shot to initiate pvp it should be simple option for a player to activate pvp or deactivate with 5 min delay on that one. 
---
However post apocalyptic world is not made only from good people but from bad ones that try to con You, use You or kill You as well. One has to be cautious of any other person in the world. Walking dead is an example how people can really be😛
---
To be honest not too many friends :) so it would be hard i guess
---
GT: Kuthorn
---
I'm LVL 150 and I have only killed 2 players in the 400+ hrs I've played. Both of those players picked the fight with me. I have been griefed and killed by groups of low/high players, but I can honestly say not enough to bother me. If they want my scrap that badly they can have it. I will still enjoy playing and collecting more. 
---
Is this story real? X-01 shocks dont require flux. They are a mod add only. Only plans require materials.
---
You had to lockpick the drop to view and loot the contents
---
Also if you dragged your cursor over *Im on pc, it says STEAL FROM...
---
If it’s free if doesn’t require lvl lockpick perk to loot but you chose to do so anyway.?
---
Not judging I see them a lot I was actually in cranberry bog when I saw one land near super duper mart.almost looted it when I noticed it needed lockpick
---
Luckily the guy who requested showed up and grateful I didn’t loot. He even invited me to a SBQ event!
---
Or better yet. What if someone knows the plans/recipe for something, they can craft the plans/recipe to sell to someone else.
---
you jest, but has anyone tried this?
---
Haha, I remember going there and noping out instantly :D
---
I personally don't see workshops as zones to encourage PvP, yes they do allow you to do this. I their main purpose is to allow players to extract resources passively. The whole pvp element of them seems tacked on and most of the time doesn't actually work. I've gotten bounties so many times for trying to defend my workshop.
---
Workshops can actually benefit multiple people if the owner chooses not to lock extractors. Ive played on quite a few servers where players would come and go between the workshops, grabbing stuff from the extractors without any hostility.
---
I just keep setting little goals. First it was complete the main quest, including beating the Queen. Then it was discover all locations. Get all achievements. Create an amazing base. Get all the mutations I want. Tame a cool as Megasloth to guard my base. Help my friends level and reach 50. Do every event at least once. Collect all of the crafting plans/mods. Nuke multiple populated areas to find the best locations. Try all the weapons to find my favorite play style. Create an OP build. Hoard/collect all 3\* legendary weapons and armor and try combinations (just picking the current meta is the most boring way to play). I have a cool base design but now im looking for the perfect location to place it without it being a popular camp location. Photographer goals, get 50 amazing photo mode captures! Get Gud at killing scorch beasts. Capture every workshop on the map in one server. Also find the best setups for each workshop location. Create a gunner build, big guns build, melee build, trader build, survival low maintenance build. Try doing the daily quests, find your favorite or a set, and try hitting that up for a few days, then switch to a different ones.  
---
It's mostly up to you. Find some goals to set for yourself. Don't pick one setup and run it for the next 100hrs. Mix it up. Try different things. Meet new people. Run quests and help out lower levels. I understand that once all quests are done it can slow down a bit. But you can always find something to do, if you really like the world they gave you to play in.
---
damn man you got any  Dave, Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick &amp; Tich?
---
Hi there! We're aware of the threads on players building so close to White Spring and are discussing options internally. Thank you for tagging! 
---
There is one spot you can put a base there that is basically a glitch, and people do this. I always call down an orbital strike on them and have a friend take my bounty. If you are a whitesprings turret farmer and you join my game, you're going to lose your base.
---
Ok, this idea is cooler.
---
Ok, hopefully that reveals more. I take it from your answer then that details about character and map are not public atm.
---
Im lvl 380 on Xbox and I’ll try and fight everybody after a nuke zone just to get there flux for shits and gigs I don’t need it at all but if they kill me they can have mine to why did you fight back if you wanted to keep it all lmao
---
Yeah it's a mistake that wont be repeated for sure. I was intending to make the shocks and got side tracked after visiting modus to see if he had another mod. Took a phone call and when I came back the area had been nuked... started collecting hardened mass etc and then got caught out
---
You were using the flux to craft x-01 shocks? I didn't think that was possible. And yeh, dump your valuable junk before doing anything risky! 
---
You can still move the CAMP around, just the TOWN that's in place with the heavy gear. You'd have one small one to move, one big one to settle.
---
Devil's advocate. Sorry! ---- First off, you're level 48. Two levels from the max level cap. The difference between level 200 and 48 is not as huge as you'd think (other than he has more time looking for better weapons and buying flavor perks, but there are plenty of level 50's that can rock a level 150+ easy). Secondly, if you really were on pacifist I have no idea how he killed you with a Barb Wired Cane unless you were already at 5% hitpoints or something. The only time I've been blasted without slapping back, or on pacifist, is when they had a Two Shot explosive weapon, and that was before the nerf. Even then it took quite a few hits. 
---
Don't get me wrong, it really sucks of him to attack you for no reason while you're crafting. That's just a jack move and I'm sorry for that. But, I feel like there's either something you're not telling us or a little embellishment here. 
---
Snallygaster is based off a lovecraftian monster called ghast so they are already showing them. I just think it would make a cool feature to the game to bring alive something that a lot of people are really curious about.
---
Wait for a prime nuke, you can easily pick up 100+ pure violet to craft stable. Use green thumb to farm, and good with salt to maintain.
---
SE part of the map at edge of the savage divide and the mire. Its part of the BoS quest line 
---
Aww, I still remember the day you and two more from the gang came to my camp with t60 torso’s on your hands wanting the jetpacks. You are always welcome. Hey, I’ve got the raider shocks now too if you want.
---
Unless I have done something incredibly stupid, when I went to put the mods on the other day it told me they needed flux?
---
What happens on a mixed set?
---
Had the same thing happen last night on Xbox.
---
Have fun taking 3/4 hp off a SB
---
caps. don't actually have anything of significant value yet.
---
It may show that flux is a component, but mods dont use materials to add them to power armor
---
Nah you can make em pretty fast. What are you playing it on? PS4, PC, or XBone?
---
Like I said in a previous comment, the idea of having your own cargobot would be an interesting mechanic. The best way I could think to introduce it as I said above. Yes it would help with issues such as dcing and losing items, or not being able to grab the junk to reset the extractors. I believe it would an an interesting dynamic, some have elaborated on the idea of others players being able to blow up your bots for the resources
---
I was going to suggest the same thing. This is a nice trick to use on xbox as long as the entire server didn't crash.
---
I've been running a bloody explosive harpoon gun for ages. One shots nearly anything in the game minus SBQ, infinite ammo, takes forever to break. You'll end up dropping more harpoons on the ground than you shoot.
---
ok?
---
&gt; For now, at least, Bethesda is saying this is ok but letting it stand. Bethesda has provided a in-game mechanic for you to challenge another player's actions. 
---
This is flat-out lying. They have never said that they support this at all. They have not commented on this.  Officially, you're not supposed to be able to build too close to any existing structure. however, you are able to build five feet from the back of this structure? That doesn't make any sense. Doesn't make sense why Bethesda would allow that at all. 
---
&gt;EDIT: since you linked the vids, took a look at your channel. You have one of the saltiest collections of FO76 vids on youtube my dude! XD
---
Most of my past videos are me uploading videos of bugs I've gotten on video. Don't see how that is being salty 
---
500ish Atoms a week. 5.6k(ish) in one time large Atom rewards. So sure you can get those 500 Atoms in a couple of days. But then you're not going to get anything for the rest of the week. It would take 3ish weeks to get Atoms for a PA skin. The game has been out for roughly 18 weeks for a estimated all time total of earned Atoms being at 14,600(ish) if you've completed every daily and weekly challenge and have gotten all of the one time large Atom rewards. The challenges and Atom Shop are a very large funnel that we're spinning in and the bottom of the funnel is our wallets  for the record I have no problem spending real money on cosmetic game items 
---
If you're in a position to drop your own nukes, you can re-earn the flux you need in about two hours.
---
First, do a run of whitesprings to gather the high rad fluids, hardened mass, and glowing mass you need.  Just server hop until you find one that's already nuked.  When you've got one each for as many violet flux as you need to make, go home and store them (of course, and certainly not implying you don't know to do that - shit happens).
---
Next, you want to do a silo run and nuke the empty space halfway between the Hemlock Holes Workshop and Wavy Willard's Water Park.  There are roughly 250 flash ferns in that region when it's nuked.  There are almost no enemies, hence getting the other materials first, but that also means it's a walk in the park to go harvest what you need.
---
You can definitely get 150 raw flux in one run, add 15 each of the other mats and bingo, you're back on track.  Grab some extra and sell em afterwards to help make up for the lost time/caps.
---
Good luck!
---
It was greeted out, like stuff is when you dont have a component for crafting? Will recheck tonight, I was surprised as well, as I thought mods contained everything needed
---
Sale or not I don’t even know what to buy. The camo paint for PA is nice so I got that, but that’s about it. Where’s ANY skins for popular weapons such as shotguns and handmade or gat. The devs need to actually play some multiplayer games such as COD and learn a thing or two. 
---
A lot of times it is people looking for an easy fast travel. My crew and I will send out invites to low levels to help them out or provide a guard service while they do quests and whatnot.
---
Pretty sure this past week was the first week they hadn’t done this lol
---
That's impossible to police. I think the idea for the rule is to prevent spamming from one individual duplicating his own thread over and over. Whereas you can look at this as a common re-occuring problem within the community to provide a highlight for the dev to observe. If they want to take it a step further, they could pareto the threads and work towards that for a more clear picture.
---
As a consumer, yes it's annoying. But as a dev, it's a tool.
---
my normal start kit is a brotherhood rifle heavy studded chest and then going to there camp and dropping this prefab warehouse 2x3 cabin with all the crafting stations bed and music chair 
---
I'm over 500 hrs, and the Flatwoods Monster is the only enemy I've yet to come across. 
---
All these great reviews, I’m half tempted to make a yelp page for you haha. Unfortunate you aren’t on Xbox,  it really amazing to see how many people have benefitted from your skills and generosity. Hope your business lives on for a long while.
---
Congrats Power Armour Guy, from Radium Rifle Guy. If I see anyone after mods I'll send them your way! 
---
Anti-armor
---
This. I have 1,300+ screws across all my mules and I blew through a bunch last week making Gauss Rifles to get all the mods. Also, the higher level perks let you repair armor/PA/weapons with a lot less materials so there is a dramatic drop in repair costs. For example I put White Knight x3 on when repairing armor and the ballistic fiber cost is low.
---
Na I've noticed it sense the game launched.
---
The spinning wheel is still usually a lag thing from iether end try jumping servers or resetting your router
---
Wait I'm now assuming that video wasn't just one kill lol
---
Thanks. I'll do so when I get home later tonight, and I'll start saving Atoms.
---
Ah of course sorry lol yeah I have some anti armor weapons, I think I even have an assasins anti armor super sledge
---
Only in our dreams lol. I thought of that too, I mean it would make sense, if you know how to make something, you can show someone else how to do it.
---
Wait... is that a use for burnt textbooks im hearing?
---
Nope. I got a bloodied pipe bolt action, benefits from all rifle / pistol perks.
---
You can do that before you launch the nuke. You can spend hours at that targeting computer if you want. 
---
I’ve only ever seen ultracite plans drop
---
EQ had a beta bug that would be an amazing perk on such an item. Sometimes, if an attack killed a mob, the excess damage would be appied to the next hit on the hit tables by any mob. So a big finishing dragon strike that killed the tank would overflow, blowing the life out of some noob on the beach when a rat hits him.  
---
Any over-damage is applied to the next successful strike by any player in the game. Watching some noob shoot at a legendary 68 Supermutant and blow it to kingdom come would be awesome.
---
My thoughts exactly. he's not considering all the fun you would have playing battleship with all your new friends in the neighborhood. 
---
That was a typo.  It should read "For now, at least Bethesda is saying this is ok BY letting it stand..."  sorry for the confusion.
---
The bug videos combined with the "griefing" videos and the "cheater" vids make me think you see a lot of negativity in all corners of the game.  Just the impression I got.
---
Carnivore doubles the hunger/thirst, HP/AP heal of meat items both cooked and raw(including certain stews/soups).  Neither it nor Herbivore are all that great, but if you are in need of healing, or need to recover a lot of AP quickly, then they can really come in handy; however, if using serums make sure to get Herbivore/Carnivore last, as I believe they are still bugged with serums.
---
As for Cannibal, it heals a certain amount of health and recovers a certain amount of hunger, per rank, when eating a corpse.  IIRC, the ammount healed is 25/50/75 for ranks 1/2/3.  Unfortunately, Carnivore doesn't double that healing; however, Ghoulish does increase the amount healed, since eating a corpse causes you to take light radiation damage and Ghoulish 3 heals 1.5 times that radiation amount.  Obviously Lead Belly reduces or nullifies the healing gained through Ghoulsih when paired with Cannibal.
---
Unfortunately, there are/were some bugs with Cannibal that I'm unsure on whether they've been fixed or not.  The first was a bug that caused rank 3 Cannibal to heal for less than rank 1.  The other caused you to only gain 1% hunger when eating a corpse, if you had Carnivore.
---
okay exactly. It's an MMO. Which means there are supposed to be other people. Thank you for agreeing with me. If you want a single player game, go play Fallout 4
---
I need to get a berserker version of that!
---
God this reddit community is so soft. Bethesda please dont listen to anything here regarding PvP... Ever. 
---
So ive been doing some "social experiments" engaging in raider roleplay with random players on the map. Both at workshops and at their camps
---
9/10 players leave the server. 1/10 plays along. 
---
The player that decides to play along gets their stuff back in the end. 
---
So hered the jist. 
---
Since the workshop changr ive been announcing my intention via mic. "Ahaa a worthy opponent! Care for a battle??
---
Carebears often curse me off at this point, racial /homofobic  slurs, basement dweller yada yada.  Which i will argue is harassment. Toxic pve community. 
---
One guy said "i dont wanna fight i need concrete to build my camp so im using the extractor here" to which i replied "ok im gonna fast travel around the map, get you over 100 concrete, come back, fight you and take this workshop!"
---
So i did just that. Spent 140 caps traveling to abandon bog and the monorail elevator. Gave it to him. Then he stashed it. At which point we pvped and became friends. 
---
Everyone else traveled or left the server. Some had their little melt down and harassed me verbally. I should start reporting them. Lame.. How am i supposed to find friendly pvp if people who don't wanna pvp waste my time by owning workshops?
---
Experiment #2 bad boys in town.

I roll up to your camp. " hey theres some bad bois around tonight..  You know... This is a nice camp.. Nice decon shower... It be a shame if something happened to it. Maybe i could keep it safe... Make sure nuthin happens to it... Just gotta grease the wheels and gimme  lil junk ya know?"
---
Everyone server hops. No one plays along. People curse me off. Call me slurrs. Im literally going to give the junk back, you only need to drop a few for me to move on to the next portion of my bit that leads to rewards for the player/ me switching to a different costume/roleplay. 
---
God you guys are soft.. Pve only players scared to lose a lil junk so they can spend their time... Collecting more junk???? What?? 
---
Bottom line. This is a multiplayer pvp enabled game. Stop pretending its not. 
---
Ive gotten to the point where i know how to "grief" a player without ever breaking any camp items or hitting them. "You got a nice camp... Shame if something were to happen to it". 
---
Honestly i dont feel like im doing anything wrong. Im playing a pvp enabled game with encouraged raider roleplay and you guys are so soft and scared its disappointing. Those of you cursing me off. You are toxic. You are harassing me by cursing and being inappropriate.  Offensive stuff. Im doing what todd wanted. Im playing a fun multiplayer interractive game.
---
This whole reddit community is such a small outpoken segment of fo76 players. There are millions of active players and this tiny sub full of soft bellied carebears does not speak for the pvp community or the hardcore roleplay community (all 12 of us). 
---
Keep fast travel to workshops. maybe for once they'd be used in pvp and NOT piss ppl off since they're mostly jump spots.
---
ok 500?
---
I've had to lockpick random encounters to open them and they didn't give me a bounty, that's why I assumed it would be fine to lockpick this one.
---
Was just trying to be nice and let you know. Lot of people in this sub like to be dicks to anyone who says something wrong. So was just trying to save you some hassle.
---
If you want me to delete it I can, was just trying to let you know.
---
Cheers dude, that's a solid tip. Not done a silo run yet
---
Have you thought about not coming here so often? 
---
Other players - headshot
---
I've only ever received one (I'm 81), and I declined. I also, once accidentally invited (yea, i dont know) and the dude (knightmon with a number in his name) was one of the nicest, most helpful, and chill guy I've seen in the game. 
---
Your mileage may vary, but at 81 I've only grouped twice and traded once with people. Not my thing.
---
The only way to get rid of one is to be killed by another player.
---
Yes, we really need more interesting things to build like this. I would also like to be able to upgrade the bit over time with scrap.
---
Were you in power armor as well? I get this bug at harpers ferry and grafton steel while fast travelling to those locations in power armor.
---
sounds like a good deal to me. I'm afk till around 5:15 pm est tho.
---
Fairly easy fix, just like modding soulbound in MMOs. Player who owns the equipment goes to the craft station and initiates a "service" session and places the item. The modding player then joins the session and selects the mod to apply and the price. both agree, mod is applied, money goes to the modder and item goes to its owner.
---
No.  That would be horrible.  They actually fixed it in the last patch so it does _not_ go from 0 to 25000.  It stops at 0, and stops at 25000.
---
On the PS4, you can use the R2/L2 buttons to jump by about 25% of the bar left or right, making it possible to move to minimum or maximum price set in about 4 button presses.  R1/L1 jump by smaller amounts.  I'm sure the Trigger/Bumpers on XBOne work the same way, not sure which are used on PC, but pretty sure they can set price with keyboard anyway.
---
Saving them saves money 
---
Thank you dear sea fog! Radium rifle is my favorite looking weapon thanks to the based design from the infamous volkstrumgewehr (which is a beast in COD WW2 btw) Good to know that there are people who appreciate it.
---
That sounds like a feature. Player cargo bots should just have a unique situation so they are easily identifiable from regular cargo bots.
---
Swedishfaz
---
Just did a scorched horde saw a 3* legendary Scorched conqueror. As his lifeless body fell through the ground I got a glimpse of "Anti-Armor" then it was gone. This happened after losing a 3* Gutsy fro AWOL Armaments didn't even get a chance for a glimpse on that one. 
---
This is exactly what was happening with people using the chat mod; only since it was cross-server it was super easy to get people to friend you then hop to your server and help out with the SBQ.
---
My friends list went from being full of people that had ditched the game, to having people that still logged in again thanks to the chat mod.
---
Stash your junk destroy the bases and fast travel to someone and let them collect your bounty. easy peasy.
---
no
---
I should still be around then, just send a msg to my GT PlaTJyer
---
This guy is the best armourer on fo76 for sure. Made and customised all my p.a and is trustworthy enough to have modded and repaired my uny sent armour and legendary weps to 200% on many occasions. Just an all round nice guy. hope you have many more happy customers like me!
---
It would lead to some interesting discoveries. What percentage of the fallout 76 community just kill on site. It probably doesn't help that Bethesda  labeled all most all passive creatures as red. I personally don't shoot something unless it shoots me first. 
---
Somebody on here told me they tried sacrificing someone in the chamber, but I'm not sure if they were wearing the ritual bindings, or using a cultist weapon.
---
I wouldn’t say no to a Yelp page haha. Thanks a lot, it means a lot to me when people appreciate what I’m trying to do. 
---
Would be nice if the Inspect option on all Plans / Mods told you what items they were for, and what effects the Mods themselves had.
---
How is a person supposed to know what "Hydraulic Bracers" do without looking it up online?  Or what the plain old.. "Bladed" loose mod is for.  Blood Cleanser or Medic Pump, what do they do exactly?  Can't find the info in game unless you apply it to an item and then look.
---
500 hours and never saw any griefer of any sort or form. I only once had a couple of guy mad at me for killing a legendary before they could tag it. They were right.
---
It is also a cool end game utility to improve qol. It would give players something to put resources into and would generally make workshops less tedious in the late game.
---
I was just about to say that lol "No! They just fixed  that" 
---
I have the X-01 and T-60 vats matrix overlay
---
Going to run all night, Going to run all day...
---
will do. my GT is same as my name here.
---
You couldn't have missed my point harder if you tried. Fallout 76 is an MMO, yes. But it's not like others. This system works lead to griefing on a game that's already on life support. 
---
I mean hey, if you want the game to die, cool, but I got one would like to see it become what was promised at E3.
---
And for the record, I did not agree with you and if you derived that from my posts, you need to go back and read it again.
---
This type of mechanic will drive the already dwindling player base out, in my opinion, and it's a bad idea. 
---
That's my take, since it's pretty clear my opinion isn't wanted here, I'll leave y'all to it. Have fun, enjoy, and all that other fun stuff. 
---
I see people set up a camp with all the ameneties right outside the nuke site before they go launch nukes. Fast travel and repairs right where you wait.
---
If PA counts as an item from our stash then we could get this with Wild Appalachia.
---
 I have a 3 star Vampiric one and OMG its a beast.  I have 1 melee card (don't remember which one) and a Whitesprings run is a walk in the park.
---
I think Phoenix in Watoga Shopping Plaza sell the available plans for all T45/51b/60 Power Armors.  Camden Park vendor sells them for Excavator (Graton, not Station but town, Vendor as well).
---
X01 plans don't exist (Mods only from Enclave).  Ultracite mod plans from SB/SBQ.
---
Until I found out that this meant pvp, workshops were my #1 priority. I haven't set foot in one over a month.
---
I think that's just a naming bug. Most PA should have the type in the name 
---
So you're saying when people commit crimes, it's perfectly legal because they haven't been caught yet, right? Even if it is, does that make it right? does ruining someone's play experience like this make it okay?
---
I definitely wasted 40 bucks on that game
---
The vaults should be high level dungeon but it's not sure
---
I agree with everything you said except that theres an atom shop
---
Holy shit. I never even thought about that. That's ingenious. I should destroy his entire base and have my friend quickly come kill me and claim the bounty and then just buy a random piece of junk off of me to get the bounty back. 
---
Obligatory link to r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
Absolutely, but idle hands and all that. Keeping dicks preoccupied makes life less hassle for everyone 
---
Fast travel to workshops works too. Means that the payoff for putting your life on the line is convenience of transport to the welcome mat. That's a legitimate incentive to claim on its own, even if only for an hour while you traverse an area.
---
I added you
---
They fixed that. It stops at 0 again when u go all the way left with left trigger. 
---
There's room for an epilogue as Owyn Lyon's Brotherhood chapter sends a recon detachment in on its way to the Capitol Wasteland.  There must be some old legends of the "Lost Chapter of Appalachia", founded at the order's beginnings, locked in mortal combat with a horrific foe to protect the future of humanity...
---
One wonders if it also has to do with the mysterious object he took from the Pitt during the Scourge...
---
Nope it will stay until some one kill you :/
---
How good is berserker vs. bloodied? I feel like I'd rather run around at 19% HP in full power armor than no damage resist lol.
---
Sadly The heating coil is the only available mod for the super sledge.
---
On the point of her dropping through the world, this is definitely something the Dev's are aware of an investigating. 
---
&gt;Adding Blatant Alcohol Based Content
---
"Adding"... but Alcohol-Based content already exists.  All booze provides stat boosts.  Perks exist to make those boosts even better, or give you more boosts.
---
I am sincerely glad you are enjoying the game. Where do you want to start with why people are negative about Fallout 76? 
---
NP mate. If your sledge has faster swing speed then it'd go for made loot.
---
Don't bother using online farming locations for screws unless you're into server-hopping, because everyone else is trying to farm the same locations. Find your own locations and then don't tell anyone :P
---
The level scaling is a broken mechanic now that half the players are high level. Either you farm the Toxic Wastes and Ash Heap for 30 levels or you routinely run into max-level enemies.
---
Great business.  Are you on during the evening hours for those of us that work during the day?  I would definitely like the calibrated shocks for my Excavator and would also like to add to my T45 as well.  I have all necessary mats.
---
Lol yeah that would be the perfect super sledge
---
Exactly! I think it’s completely doable. The problem right now is that it would basically eliminate demand for what you are asking for. The trading of mods themselves. But, if we did what someone else said, made it so anyone could put on any mods but only proper gunsmiths could craft them, I think it would successfully create demand for both. Maybe less people would bother to use gunsmith as a must-pick
---
&gt; This is a multiplayer pvp enabled game. Stop pretending its not.
---
we aren't pretending its not. We are eagerly waiting for when you people can go fork each other on your own server and let the rest of us enjoy the game.
---
Ye, is only game 👍
---
I dunno. With the ability to manage the card decks when you have so many of them, you can maximize whatever weapon you have. I mean, do you have any trouble at all with level 60-70 enemies or even mobs? I tank and can clear whitesprings golf club in nuke zones pretty easily by myself.
---
Humans: Willing to leave their car at a body shop IRL to have work done it.
---
Also humans: I’m not giving you my virtual weapon to install a mod on it because I don’t trust you. 
---
You brought up some good points in this! While I personally haven't needed more than the 3 minutes I can see why some players would. I can bring it up to the Dev's and see what they think, and see if it's something we would want to have a large conversation about.
---
The Heavy mods you are thinking of are for the Sledgehammer weapon, and the plans are not learned from crafting/scrapping.
---
With artillery you can try. 😂
---
I think there might be actual laws against cigarettes and such used in video games/cartoons. (which is why you don;t see joe camel anymore).
---
or it could just be bullshit I heard long ago. never cared enough to look into it.
---
Seems nitpicky. Adding more then. Is that better? 
---
This is a really cool idea! That way it would save us some room for other perk cards, plus I only use PA, I have no regular armor at all. 
---
Realy? Thats sad :(( after i optained the supersledge from the mayor quest i was so happy that another mod exist but if we cant get it... -,-
---
Honestly, whatever is comfortable for you. I saw the prices of the controllers, fainted, got back up, and bought third party used. 
---
I have small hands so I may see if I can find one that fits better. I bought the Xbox One for Christmas and that controller took some serious adjusting. It's huge.
---
doodah doodah
---
Nah he the shit praise Mothman 
---
I've seen him 3 times on my level 76 character. Once when I was like level 35, and then I killed him twice in a week level 70+. It was cool to finally fight him, but I wish he dropped something special.
---
I mean NPCs in Fo4 smoked. I don't see the difference. 
---
Just with her, or some/all other enemy entities?
---
this game is just awful. i agree with op. its not even about needing a constant stream of new content. i can play fo nv and fo 3 immersively over and over like its my first time again. fo76 and fo4 just sucks. plain and simple. i cant stand the new dialogue choices in fo4. i cant stand the lack of dialogue in fo76. its absolutely bonkers how it went from an rpg to a sandbox game about collecting junk and preciouses. there’s no other human npc’s. there’s so little few types of enemies and factions. and the event quests are so goddamn repetitive and boring. seriously you must need a pea sized brain to still be enjoying this game. the people that still enjoy this game instead of boycotting fo76 are the problem. if everyone stopped playing then bethesda would be forced to make some actual goddamn changes. but naaa lets keep dumping money into a broken game. 
---
/u/Ladydevann you're awesome! I'm sure reading these types of complaints can be draining and I appreciate you. 
---
that is key. I had a level 6 shooting and smacking me. I was initially unaware it was even happening. Once I realized what they were doing, I crafted, modded, and then dropped a fully loaded pump shotgun for them with ammo. The whole time they are still trying to fight me. 
---
They pick up the shotgun and ammo. Then resume shooting me with that.  
---
Some people are just pricks.
---
So I was right! Less than 8bit, adventure game.
---
Agreed. Wastelanders need to learn the price they have to pay if they take any of my workshops. They all belong to me.
---
Get yourself a gamma gun, make it full auto. Then take as many gjouls as you can out the front door of the golf club, up through carpark and then back through the little swimming pool area to the sides of the offending base, as the turrets etc are usually aimed at the golf club and rarely do they have any on the sides or back. Then get near or inside the base and spam the ghouls with your gamma gun while they attack the base and destroy it. You will refill the health of your little horde and no wanted status 👍 IM DOING MY PART 👐 jazz hands 
---
I bough the pip boy long ago. Best atom purchase so far.
---
I've seen different threads to the tune of wanting a TOWN system or being able to build closer to other CAMPs. I have to say, though, this is the first time I've seen the plot and set town area suggested. I think it's a fun idea and will include that in my report. Thanks for posting!
---
Happy birthday praise Mothman!!!
---
Guess what.. We aint leaving. Im not giving out quests in a pvp server.
---
The pvp servers gonna be a battleground. Thats it. Kind of boring imo. I dont want to play call of duty. I wanna play fallout.  Ill go in there when i want a good fight but ima keep raider roleplaying in adventure mode. 
---
Ill go in there for battles but im going to stay in adventure. PvP workbenches are for the strongest on the server.  Dont get butthurt when i take it. 
---
I want a more dramatic emmersive experience. Adventure mode seems like a better fit.
---
 I wont find dummys with 100s of junk items owning workshops on survival mode either. Mans gotta eat!
---
I know that there are heavy mods for the normal sledge but after the mayor quest in watoga i was going to my crafting station, looked at the mods and there was the mod for the heated coil aviable so it IS a heavy mod attached on my reward supersledge but it seems its not aviable atm for us :(
---
Definitely interested in speed demon, maybe more. What's your PSN?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/av13vn/are_sirens_useless/ehbuccc/
---
Go confront each other.
---
The talk they are giving is making PvP completely optional on the main servers. You cant damage me or my camp, so I cease caring where you are or what you do.
---
Needed "Bad Boys" in the background
---
not much. as of about a month ago we were going to be able to use the same characters. The map will stay the same. All pvp restrictions will be removed (slap damage, pacifist mode, etc.). Also, we will lose more than just junk/caps. The extents of what will be lost however has not been specified.
---
You could use vertibot signal or artillery smoke grenades. Just make sure your artillery is out of range or they are unlikely to appreciate the gift of death from the sky
---
Without knowing how its going to work... sure would be nice if they released some videos showing the process... you'd think. Anyway, they should make a SERVICE option and a place for end user to place materials (steel, screws, gears, etc.) and then on our side we select the mod to install an the price. As part of the materials, they also select the weapon or power armor needed. When both parties agree, the caps are moved and the work is done and then the item is back in the end users inventory. So it never really leaves them and all parties are safe. Mod doesn't leave me until I get the caps. In short I could always just sell the mod to them as well an they do the work.
---
There's a fix for that: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aqtokr/fallout_76_pc_version_graphic_presets_explanation/egisn7v/?context=3
---
Thanks! I live in GMT+2 but I have a very flexible schedule and has this thing of watching Timberwolves games so I stay up up to 10PM ET most of the time. I have friends from all over the world and I do schedule times that would fit for all. Early morning, late evening are usually good times on your local time
---
Something I am working on with the new restrictions

---
To be reminded why he shouldn't play? That's probably the worst reason I've heard yet lol. 
---
While slightly annoying, the vast majority of glitches and lack of oversight and thought into this game don’t affect new players/low level players/ people who haven’t finished the game. 
---
If you are a level ~60 or below who hasn’t finished the game, I’d be willing to bet there’s really only like 2-3 issues with the game:
---
1. The quests seem like chores because we know everyone is dead and we know nothing we do matters 
---
2. High level players can obliterate us on sight just if there whim feels like it. 
---
3. Maybe heavy weapons and energy weapons are useless
---
I absolutely agree with people when the complain about things like Bobby pin weight, legendaries being nerfed, the lack of role playing features like making a shop. If you are low level, you don’t have any legendaries, barely have any Bobby pins, and are still experiencing West Virginia for the first time, probs not even concerned about role play.
---
TLDR: most issues seems like replayability issues (something that is important for a game with fallout in is name) but replayability is not important for a first time play through 
---
I think the cargo bot should require significant resources to create and to a lesser extent maintain. This way, high level characters could have something to work towards. Using cargobots introduces the risk of people shooting it down for resources and you would still have to return of someone contests the workshop.
---
Stealth non-VATS rifle is fine too, just need to hit the headshots. You can run plenty of quality of life perks that way.
---
As you said, stealth works poorly in coop. I make do, but the damage output is a lot more impressive solo.
---
You are the best! Although I crafted them, I envy the combinations I’ve made for you, which I never had time and resources to spare those kind of goodies to myself haha :)
---
ohhhhhh please, get off your high horse
---
Surprisingly, the Mothman event lured him out for me twice. I had figured the other cryptids got a spawn increase buff as well (as I saw a lot of Grafton too) but maybe that was odd luck on my part. 😳
---
Flatwoods can (oddly) be found in Cranberry Bog a lot. Walk around there for a bit around the random  event spawn locations if you know them, and you’ll come across him eventually! Two days ago I saw him near the entrance to Glassed Cavern. 
---
Holy crap that Glowing One 
---
When I did it solo, I hacked the terminals to turn off targeting restrictions for the turrets, so they would attack anything. I'd wait until the turrets and bots had about wiped each other out before going in to clean up. I also found it beneficial to leave some turrets alive, and just avoid them, so that when more bots spawned they'd  help kill them too.
---
The horse beating will end when that nobuild zone expands to where it should be.
---
That's incredible... that people still play F76.
---
my personal experience with non-PA builds is simply that they are not an option unless you're in low level areas and then switch to PA for the real stuff.
---
Splendid Idea
---
P.a for every possible situation :)
---
Likely that game companies don't want to encourage our youth to smoke. I know it's a touchy subject but there's no good reason to be a long term smoker.
---
Not being in power armor is the only benefit I need to not use it. I can't stand the constant head bob and the over intrusive UI, the legendary armor effects are just icing on the cake.
---
I feel like sentinel armor synergizes better with ranged builds than with melee. With a gun you can find a perch and just take pot shots at everything without taking significant damage. Cavalier armor is probably better for melee.
---
I do agree that the stagger is very annoying. I'd love it if they introduce a perk to help mitigate it. Bring back Rooted and add a chance to avoid being staggered to it.
---
*YOOOOOOOOOO!!!!* It's your **4th Cakeday** foleythesniper! ^(hug)
---
I missed spelled Bethesda oops my bad hahaha😭😂
---
You didn't experience the launch bugs. There's also the FO1&amp;2 crowd that feel disenfranchised from their original experience.
---
Because you're taking this way too seriously.
---
I have a few rules. I do not take workshops unless I think I can profit from it. Under level 50? Not worth it unless they have friends.
---
 Last night there was a level 25 dude taking a bunch of workshops. I noticed a level 160 was making a beeline straight to this guys workshop. I fast traveled in and snuck my way up some geometry. He was taking the workshop and had no idea I was right above him. The moment he captured it, I contested and dropping him instantly. What followed was an intense battle. He had a level 90 buddy join in. It was 2v1. I must have gotten 5 kills a piece to their 1. They were using a oneshot melee build. Eventually they gave up. The level 90 sought revenge and fast traveled away. I stumbled upon him in Watoga, still engaged in a duel with me. After he died, I saw where he respawned at his camp. I made my way over to the both of them and had a nice chat. 
---
Only time I was a huge raider was when I killed a dude in excavator armor sitting on 5% HP. He dropped about 100 lbs of scrap. That was worth the 50 cap bounty alone. He came back to claim the bounty and I got a few hundred extra caps off him.
---
Being a raider / PVP is very fun.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Great idea.
---
I am 100% certain that all the old weapons and armour were not forgotten, but they are saving them for future content. 
---
We've seen a lot of players requesting to name Power Armor and Weapons.
---
I'm excited to say that this will be a feature in a future update. We created a ["Known issues and Feedback List"](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am3agv/fallout_76_known_issues_and_feedback/) that talks about this.
---
In 80 hours and I done even know if I'm in pacifist mode, because I've never been griefed, or even hit by accident.  Mainly play solo and only ran through a nuked Whitesprings twice when I needed a level to unlock a decent legendary I had found.  Anecdotal, but...
---
Oh definitely not. Smoking is terrible for you. But so is drinking copious amounts of alcohol which a few perks heavily encourage. 
---
It is worth it if you can get it for dirt cheap, which shouldn't be to hard. Go with one of those stores that are handing the game out with used controllers. Then you can get the game for free.
---
You are special. Not special like special, but special, like spEchIAaaaaaL.
---
Hey thanks for that :) Your kindness is very much appreciated!
---
Tiny tiny tiny tip: 
---
equip the charisma perk called something like: real estate, and fast travel cap cost is reduced by 30%
---
Also since fast traveling to the vault 76 and your base is free, having your base in a strategic location can save you a lot of fast travel caps.  (You just have to be willing to do a little walking since your strategic base location and vault 76 will only get you close to areas)
---
You are amazing :')
---
I think I have 2-3 pieces with RR, as well as a marine armor chest piece which has some. I usually pop a rad shield/rad x diluted before a fight and it takes her rad  aura from 12/s to something like 2.
---
Any chance you're on PC and interested in a Berserkers Explosive LMG with prime receiver and about 2000 ultracite .308?
---
I wish I had the time/money to devote to collecting all these. I have a jukebox that plays both 78s and 45s and it would be cool to stock it with all these. It wouldn't work with the new releases that have a center hole that doesn't match their traditional US RPM speed as that's how the jukebox determines what speed to play the record at (big hole=45, small hole=78). Again, good work and nice collection.
---
Agreed it is super frustrating. My front wall is white out for that reason, if you build it brick out first you can put up your roof and then replace the wall(s) and have your roof look right.
---
You don't. You hit the limit.
---
Thank you, pc :)
---
Because I want this game to succeed. I apologize if that's somehow a problem. 
---
Fact is, the game, in its current state, is on life support. Something like this would basically pull the plug. 
---
Hahaha that's harsh.
---
Bethesda isnt talking about it. This lame subreddit is. 
---
You guys have ... 5 months before outer world releases and most of the pve players quit.
---
The pvp community is whats going to drive this game into 2020. Bethesda knows it. 
---
Keep circlejerking your crappy pvp suggestions. No one is listening. You babies dont need another saftey blanket to protect you from raiders just playing thr game.
---
Server hop. Block. Move on. Cry on reddit. We aint following you. Its against the rules. I dont break the Terms.
---
Happy birthday to you too!
---
/u/waxapple took me to meet the Mothman for the first time today. It's a good birthday even for me!
---
For clarity, yes investigating all accounts of this happening. If it ever happens to you feel free to record it (If you're on xbox, you can quick hit the center button and X to record the last thirty seconds.) and send it to me.
---
It’s the travellers leather coat, it is acquirable as a reward from events in the mire or trade with other players.
---
*I'm a PoS and yes I enjoy scamming people. 
---
FTFY
---
Anything in life is worth it if the price is cheap enough! If you can find the game for close to $25, it’s def worth it.
---
They are wrong, on so many levels
---
For sure man! 
---
I believe so, specific to France and Australia.
---
well permanently is not likely, but much higher CND than ordinary.
---
If you mean: does it stay in high condition if you lower your luck, then yes, thats been my experience. like swapping in weapon artisan to get longevity, but that only repairs up to CND lvl. The CND lvl is affected by luck when you get the weapon.
---
I stay perma stealthed, you get 50% more damage, but for me I like the thrill of easily dying. It really changed my play style and made each encounter more rewarding. On my 170+ in T-60 scorchbeasts, scorched, moleminers, everything (except kinitic gun Gutsy) were easy mode and boring. With this build Scorchbeasts are terrifying and each encounter takes thought or you will die. It helped refresh the game for me and keeps it fun (going for map completion on my Beserker atm). 50% extra damage and having NO real repair costs is also nice. 
---
Question not clear. Not wanting certain mutations is logical. Plague walker seems useless to me.  Scaly skin is great for a non-vats user though. 
---
What is your goal? Also, if you get class freak you can reduce the negatives of mutations by up to 75%.
---
Right? And you can’t use the better large stair frame on the second floor.
---
This is a post-apocalyptic game, which means you get to do whatever the hell you want.  I prefer co-op, but I respect your style. You do you. 
---
"Hey, I'm a veteran and played the hell out of this game that I find terrible for some reason and now I am going to complain on Reddit because I'm stupid".
---
Better?
---
Wholesome experiences like this are my favorite things to read! 
---
The way so many people view PvP in this game baffles me.  I got called a gay cringy edgelord on reddit for even mentioning my raider tendencies. For me the most exciting and challenging moments in this game have come from fighting other people.  I dont understand, people can endlessly grind whitesprings and queen bullet sponge, but Todd forbid somebody shoots at them in a shooting game.  There are no NPCs in this game, they encourage PvP combat at workshops, and they dleiberately introduce you to a raider faction.  It is almost as though the game was designed for us to roleplay as raiders.
---
So there a max and never gos up dang 
---
I disagree on this. Rifles who just have their weights corrected, then there wouldnt be a need for a perk to do the same thing.
---
I’m asking why all my stats are so low?
---
Thank you 
---
Great idea 
---
That's a cool idea!  I have not seen any so far, but I am sure it is doable.  Maybe focus on one-handed (for the cultist weapons) and sneak perks, throw in some night-based perks just to give it that Mothman vibe. It probably won't do the most damage, but if it is purely for fun/rp I don't think it would matter.  
---
Yes I am on PC. I'm scared to ask how much that would cost me?!
---
They are going to be that screwy until you get class freak 3. It will reduce the negative effects by 75%. Yiu can also improve your negative stats by wearing certain pieces of clothing and armor and modded weapons.
---
Yeah just for fun you know thanks for the ideas 😁
---
He would have to have 10 people to man them though
---
I could see it being in Survival and not spawning a quest. More like a mobile workshop function, so get stuff sent and people could attack it. You'd be pinged where its under attack and could then hunt down your cargo. The raiders have to move the items on foot and a tracker keeps telling us where they are. If they make it back to the raider camp, you loose the items. Of course the raiders will have a fight on their hands an you only have a general area they could be in.
---
Holy shit. I presume there's a corresponding degradación in stats when the status goes down? I tend to repair at the 50% point, but usually not sooner...
---
The cost of the ammo, even if the resources to make it are easy to get, *are still higher than the cost of standard ammunition because there are more resources*. It's not a lack of convenience that is a problem, it's having to set aside one of your nuke launches in order to farm out the pieces of it when you could be making the arguably economically better choice of grinding out Legendaries at Whitesprings. When you don't have the ability to play 9 hours a day and instead only an hour or two at most, things like that become tangible. You'll be able to sustain all your ammo use with a lead extractor in your camp and scrapping for acid/steel with the gatling, probably not for other higher RoF guns. For a dude that had at most 4 hours to play at a time, It was better to stick to Hardened/Standard receiver than Prime. 
---
But yeah, totally ignore opportunity cost when making an economic assessment of something, then blame people not finding the option "Convenient" enough on a month's old post lol
---
Ok thanks 
---
It's not the grind for legendaries itself, it's the trade system that keeps me grinding. I enjoy running a shop online and selling stuff I grinded myself
---
turrets and traps take up a bunch of your budget.. the less of them, the more of other stuff you can build
---
Meanwhile I want a Starched Genes like effect applied to Plague Walker, so that diseases don't wear off and can't be cured, but you can still get more.  That way Plague Walker can actually have more than 4 diseases at a time, and thus be viable damage wise.
---
It would still be a risky build, what with -3 to all SPECIAL's, periodic Food/Water loss, 25% more damage, 50% more Limb damage, 50% more Rad damage, bleeding from wounds(including loss of AP and Rad Damage taken from being hit), as well as reduced damage with melee/range, less AP/AP Regen, less Carry Weight and higher AP cost in VATS.  You'd pretty much be a glass cannon, unable to take much in the way of hits, but it'd probably be pretty good if you heavily invested into stealth.
---
I love this so much! It's great to see how your Power Armor trading grew so much. 
---
Check out this post from a while back... click the hair link: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9tx7ex/spoilers_atomic_store_files_found/?st=JSM257SP&amp;sh=6822aff1

What platform are you on?  I want to start a raider group.
---
Ah, I see. Check your diseases. they tend to also drop stats. Other effects can as well, check your player status tab in the pipboy.
---
Only need to get to level 51 with this build

---
Using reason with this guy isn't gonna work
---
We all want this game to succeed. At least most of us. But at this point for some of us making jokes and making up what ifs keeps it light-hearted when things have been fairly sucky. I think we all know this isn't a real possibility.
---
Shit I got like 8 oof that’s so helpful 😭😁
---
Don't worry, Bethesda will fix it within the year
---
Lol bet you were one of the people to say they should shut down servers
---
Honestly the passive system should work like GTA V. If you enable it, people can't damage you, and you can't damage people. That simple.
---
If this happens.... My wanted level is going to be HUGE!
---
Place 2 foundations, and put the door between them.  That should allow you to place the door in either orientation (though it's still a bit fiddly).  You can remove the extra foundation afterwards.
---
i REALLY think that some holiday gear should be free. I've played a bunch of other games where at least 1 cosmetic item was free for Christmas, 4th of July, Thanksgiving, etc.
---
It takes no skill no talent to farm the golf club any which way really.  Pot, kettle, both black.  If you want a challenge, head on over to West Tek, when the grown ups go to.
---
The second thing has been happening since beta. They just don't want to fix it 
---
lmfao triggered much
---
The easy fix here is to make Pacifist work both ways.  No slap damage.  If I wanted PvP I'd play literally any other online game.  Part of what makes this game so much fun is that the people that make online gaming suck aren't here... please don't encourage them to come here, or at least make it so they can't ruin our experience if they do.
---
Fully aware of the Warhawk assets being there, but I'm still waiting on it to be released. The Gage Eyepatch though is something I've always wanted to wear on any character.
---
Yeah, there would of course be an inherent risk such as this to broadcasting your CAMP location to the world. That's why it should be optional.
---
Has anyone tried killing a player at the altar with a cultist weapon/wearing cultist gear? Have thought about trying but never get around to it.
---
... Go on.
---
PS4 but that is super kind of you. Thanks!
---
The plans for those are not on any levelled lists don't appear in game. You can find the mods though.
---
We need wendigo week first. 
---
Yeah would love that too, am I remembering correctly that it wasn’t available in fo4 too? Had to be console commanded in or modded?
---
Well thats good to know. I was under the impression that luck affected the CND of new weapons you find, but they were no different then the exact same weapon found with low luck. You would just have to repair before you got an decent use out of it.
---
I am trying to get vanguard sentinel for a heavy build and weapons with added DR while aiming. 
---
Wendigos are the most common cryptid for me
---
Even if you don't do the silo, 3 minutes is rarely enough time because typically you're away from your camp on your own quest or collecting materials and need to switch from that over to deal with SBQ.  Even more painful if you're over encumbered or otherwise dealing with something you can't immediately quit in order to head to the nuke zone.  I also think the SBQ should have a longer timer to kill her (perhaps even until the zone itself disappears) since every single failure I've had with her was simply because the timer ran out due to glitches or a bunch of level 20 moochers showing up.  It's just an incredibly frustrating way to "lose" a fight that you were winning up until some random timer expired.
---
Lakeside cabins is a workshop. You cant blame someone for attacking you there...
---
Youre supposed to fight eachother on workshops.  
---
Aw, man.  Dang, I was going to offer you a bday present if you were on Xbox. Oh well, happy hunting!
---
Ive seen him numerous times in the wood North of Monongah, and in the wood east of the Whitespring. Maybe he has a higher chanve there? Also the cliffs above the cranberry bog east of west tek.
---
It would help if you could let us know what platform you are using. 
---
class freak 3 is a MUST if you want to effectively use mutations.  Its  a card like starched genes in that you must have them for a mutation build. It would be nice to pick and choose, but those serums are expensive let alone the plans! (19k). I was lucky enough to get a carnivore serum plan, and it says the serum is worth 2k caps. I sell them for 500 each. Cant seem to find the others...i'd make a fortune in caps off the marsupial....lol
---
I saw a mole rate like that yesterday. I just slowly backed away.
---
There's a sub specifically for things like this...and you FAILED to mention what platform.
---
Sirens are a good way to let other players know where your base is at, if you have an open base for others to stop by and use benches/etc.
---
I've pooped at the targeting computer before.  Just have to watch out for that random Gutsy that you forgot to kill to wander in there.
---
What about the grafton monster? He is always in Charleston, and several places in toxic valley. 
---
I concede that you’re are right regarding which platform the game was made for. I disagree that the increase presence of console players can be chalked up to it being literally give away for free, while it is true physical editions were and are sold at a steep discount compared to digital purchases and this most doubtfully plays a big part. (Heck the price drop was what motivated me to buy the game in the first place). This now also true for digital sales. 
---
I believe it is the way people of the different platforms approach the game, if you are on a console you just don’t take for granted lots of things people expect PC games to deliver and are so much more likely to give them an easier time. Like how there is the desire by PC players for an in game text chat system because that’s a common feature in PC games but it’s also extremely rare in console games. 
---
You kind of can, but its a pain in the ass to do, and it requires the other set of stairs (so its more or less pointless). 
---
Basically the way I did it is i built the third floor using the center staircase. Then snap the stair frame onto the third floor. You cant remove the first set of stairs, because the stair frame is technically not attached to the second floor, so you get a "floating error" if you try to remove stair 1.
---
What I ended up doing was I built the centerstairs outside where you cant use them (put a wall up infront of the stairs on the 3rd floor
---
I remember seeing a different way using the posts to get those stairs on an upper floor, but I couldnt get it to work 
---
Not for me I see wendigos most as they are a common spawn at whitesprings and at cranberry big during the scorchbeast fights 
---
This kind of stuff usually happens to me over by the scorchbeast queen
---
Yeah and I thanked him for it. At what point did you read me complaining he did?
---
Initially sounds like a great plan...reality... remember 4 or 6 now 800 lbs of stash limits? At first it's like oh man, now it's like what do I gotta drop to keep this probably will never use again thing.. 
---
Hi! Old thread :)
---
Yes, I'm on PC - I solved this with a second account tbh. I can't link 3rd party sites, but I paid $10 for a key, which to me is a fair price for not losing my stuff.
---
Ah, nice. I forgot about the basement guy at the club house. Weird though I've never seen them in the bog, except fort defiance. All over the mire though.
---
Sure, but by tying it to level the answer to that is "*leave my camp and go level up until I don't have to drop anything*". Keeps us playing the game instead of just getting frustrated.
---
I always get them attacking me when I’m trying to fight the SBQ
---
Don't fear high lvl players. Just wave at them and try to talk. I'm always sharing stuff I have when I can. I remember being in the mid 20s and a lvl 150 dropped by camp and dumped around 1000 rounds each of a couple ammo types. I told him I use 10mm and .308 is all. We talked a bit and then he went on to help some more. Survival is coming and it could get even better for interactions when pvp players move over to there from time to time.
---
You won't be able to run Stabilized without power armor, affecting your guns spread and armor penetration greatly.  At the very least you need to get some AA gatling gun or 50 cal, or a backup weapon to use.
---
Armor is just armor - just pick the pieces that work better for your build and provide more protection.
---
Glad to hear it's an upcoming feature, I hate grabbing all my power armor and having to deploy them all to get the one I am going to mod or add/replace a part
---
upvote for that pun
---
I did my first nuke (whitesprings) in the mid 30s, got my ass kicked, but managed to survive. Used up like 30 stims and radaway.
---
O ok now I understand what happened. Thanks guys. So now my next question is how do I get said weapons of mass destruction?? Hah I like that griefing griefers idea. In all honesty is there a way to make your character well rounded in pvp and pve? 
---
There is quite a bit of lore around it for it to be an "easter egg". Oxhorn did a pretty in depth video about it. It's called the Interloper. 
---
I've been at 0/10 for my entire play time.
---
They never spawn.  Common belief is that they are low level enemies.  And they only spawn if the area is "Fresh" and the first person entering it is a low enough level.  Otherwise it's a bunch of high level or nuked stuff.
---
Cannot confirm that myself.  Never get a fresh Whitespring, and never seen a low level be the first to enter.
---
Oh man, all that second hand smoke, my character has asthma and already fiends for bufftats and psycho... not sure he can take another addiction...especially... smoking.. eww
---
Thank you for your kind words! I’m very happy to help this community grow. Also, I appreciate the hours you all are putting for us. Many thanks.
---
Yeah the lag in response has made us all drop, scrap, sell, or buy something we didn’t mean to. 
---
In RDR2 I smoked all the time...loved it...lol
---
The text feature is more for those people who are deaf, and unable to use voice chat. Just because console games don't offer a function doesn't mean we should just accept that as "how it has to be".
---
It is silly to not put in a text feature in the game, especially if they are trying to push the game as having a trading economy. Without text chat trading in game is almost 100% pointless, you end up having to rely on outside websites to fill the void left by not implementing a text chat feature. As for console games not offering text chat? Diablo 3 has text chat, hell even MINECRAFT has text chat on console, there are numerous other games that have text chats on console. Almost every single game that has a trading economy built into the game has text chat on console because it is pretty much required to have an economy in the first place.
---
No, your friend is right. And what makes it worse, you actually become a burden on the people trying to kill the SBQ. At lvl 30-40, you're just not able to deal enough damage to offset the increase in DR and HP the queen recieves from an additional person at the event.
---
so do you recommend just holding more fusion cores and go with something like lightweight armor with weight reductions
---
Yea im surprised we couldnt make it out of the vault let alone wood armor. 
---
read your title again and tell me you didn't say Beth is bad at math
---
I played beta into launch and then two or three months after that.  The bugs were never gamebreaking (for me).. aside from the explosive damage glitch.  Other glitches like the stretched power armor thing were just humorous.
---
Haha same my game consists of farming ammo atm. Although i know im going to smash through it. 
---
Ammosmith perked helped me alot.
---
Haha yeah same 😀 
---
np! good luck with your build, and praise Mothman!
---
Looks like im on a quest to find them through events. So is it just basically any event in the savage divide? 
---
Yeah it would be great to have this, never happened to me *yet* but you never know!
---
I've already added "  SeventySix - ATX\_Main.ba2, SeventySix - ATX\_Textures.ba2 " 
---
it always worked before the last patch...
---
No longer seeing any Atom shop items in game... 
---
I didnt read it all. I love raiders and am sick of the u justified raider hate
---
I thought you can in the trade window, just push X while hovering over the item like in your own inventory!
---
Yeah, after having 3 level 200+ players kill my friend and I, then trash her place for no reason, and attempt to grief us after, I no longer trust players. They may never be what they seem. If they're not on my friends list, I don't interact at all.
---
It's an evolution of the Cult Of The Mothman. The creature at the bottom of the mine is The Interloper. There are interloper shrines all over the place, including the Mothman museum. As I mentioned elsewhere, Oxhorn did a pretty good video on it. 
---
On thing Ox missed was the church in Hevitia. The "totem" there (for lack of a better descriptive) is most definitely a mid-point between the Mothman and the Interloper. 
---
I guess I forgot to mention it was whitespring. We agreed not to do sbq till after like 50+
---
Praise Mothman!!!
---
Things on the known bug/planned features list shouldn’t be constantly repeated like they are. That’s really my only point 
---
I'm playing as a Nuka Cola billboard. I don't imagine things would end well for me if we were to meet up. You'd have a blast.
---
I’ve use Filthy Casuals mainly, I just check this sub for news and if I’m bored 
---
Damn, I kinda love both the ways you are using those!
---
I've never been able to hear anyone or be heard that I can tell using my Logitech G930. Windows and other applications see the mic just fine but for some reason it's like it doesn't exist in Fallout 76.
---
This quest took me two weeks, hundreds of ghouls, and many server hops. I think it has something to do with killing ghouls in golf attire.
---
Really sorry guys, i forgot always it and u re right! 😅
---
Anyway i m on ps4. 
---
The poor horse! 
---
That is some sinister shit, bro
---
Then how did they know the brotherhood of steel would be a thing?
---
Yes I supposed it would trigger you, that's why I posted.
---
Player created radio stations plz
---
I don't think that or the Abraxo Cleaner are in the game
---
Orbital strikes are made for this. It's a beautiful thing. #CryEveryTime
---
The legend of the Snallygaster predates Lovecraft. It's roots go back to the mid 1700s. 
---
Try shooting him with the vox syringer!
---
If you see me on PC (Lionneserra) my camp is right outside the Overseer's camp. My house has no doors, three water purifiers, a small garden, and a rad shower outside. Whenever I return from the wastes, I dump all ammo I don't need (everything except 5mm and .50-cal) along with excess healing and non-perishhable foods into the Overseer's stash.
---
I love to craft! Need something made, just ask. One of my greatest joys in this game has been being a beacon of light and hope in the wastes.
---
I can't wait for player vending! I aim to open one of Appalachia's first One-Cap stores.
---
Has anyone tested to see of they are effective lures? I really damn hate having some mongrel alpha chilling in BFE that I have to hunt down to get to the next wave of a "Defend XYZ" event. I'm hoping Sirens can somewhat ease this burden.
---
I've never seen this...but now I really want to.
---
Dang that’s a good idea thank you!!! 
---
Didn't even cross my mind. I was too busy panicking.
---
I see him everyday... every time I spawn at my camp just south of Morgantown...you know the big house with the red star? Just behind there, to the south... by the stream that follows the road.I set up two turrets in Hope's to kill him, he just inks away like the mothman.  Its kinda creepy, like stalks me...always level 30 something. 
---
The game is also rated M and features gore, violence, drug use, drinking, and sex if you count earlier Fallout titles in which you could hook up with companions. So while I get your point, letting us smoke isn't quite the same as making Mario a chain-smoker.
---
I absolutely agree on your last point, as an ex-smoker. Plus I wouldn't smoke even if we could, I need that plastic!
---
What do you mean "returned"? Was it in the atom shop before? I'd never seen it prior to last week. But I would DEFINITELY love to see Blackbird return. 100%.
---
As an alternative I would take a combination of significantly quicker login/logout/loading and actually re-spawning in the same place you were at when you logged out. If it weren't a big deal to do that you could just quickly log out and log back in.
---
I would have to agree with some other comments posted here, that a good way to combat the issue is to tag the enemies and work with the farm in place. 
---
The only reason not to do this would be for personal challenge, and you cant find that in abundance elsewhere. 
---
That aside there are the options of server hopping as well as initiating pvp. The fact that 3 extremely viable options have been presented and are hitting a brick wall is a clear indication to me of this posts intent.
---
Those are 3 Game in game mechanics in place to help combat this issue. I feel this would be low on Bethesda's totem pole since there are in game options to avoid or enjoy the situation. 
---
To me this is viable game play. Not just for farming but also to roleplay as a raider, which that kind of play is encouraged by Bethesda. 
---
There are many kinds of playstyles and players out there. To optimize you have to include avenues for all these players and playstyles while maintaining a balance. I think Bethesda is doing an ok job with that. Your play style is most definitely not permanently hindered and there are ways to avoid players who want to play this way. 
---
So why are you dead set on ruining their experience Op?  
---
Why commit genocide because of their beliefs in how the game should be played? 
---
The world is big enough for everybody to do what they want if they are willing to put in the effort.
---
Put in the effort op, it's just another mob or boss fight in the game in the end. Just one more hurdle. 
---
Your satisfaction should be immense from overcoming this challenge.  
---
All is intended with respect.
---
I said the same thing until I did everything there is to do in the game in a week of casual play and THEN I realized what the complaints were about. Mind you this was when the game was broken as shit too. The fact that there is still no content or remotely anything to do after months is a testament to the criticism. 
---
Behind the big cabin with the red star? I’ll check that out for sure
---
Oh I see, that actually makes sense, I assume like you have to make a new character that can go in PvP? That makes sense so you don't have all those of 100+ with TSE weapons 
---
2 days ago i found my first explosive weapon, and explosive shotgun...BUT... it was only level 15 :(
---
i died a little inside
---
I'm not sure about that workshop but at Gorge Junkyard there is a pile of logs that you can build a wood resource extractor next to.
---
Those rare event outfits are worth a fortune because of how rare the drops are, scrapping one would be a huge loss to me.
---
I've seen them 4 - 5 times at my base
---
Go for it. Find highground and tag everything you can hit. 
---
Each turret eats like 10% of your budget. 
---
That's, not working, as intended? Whew, thought it was just me
---
This is nice, but again there is NO GROUND where I want to build. I'm so high in the air the CAMP bubble doesn't touch ground. Every single "trick" still needs ground, and still needs at least one foundation to start.
---
To clarify, I want to build one one of the Monorail pylons. At the top. Because it would be awesome.
---
This
---
Currently some junk is worthless.
---
I was in the nuke zone in WS, 3 glowing ones went at me. Not many by the count but I wasnt paying any atention to my health bar so I died. Another player was near by so instead clicking die and respawn I went for scream for help. Of course he ignored me and waited till I die. When I come back after respawning, all my junk and that player was gone. Shame I didnt pay attention to his nametag and thank god we cant drop any legie items, I had about 15 legies on me from nuke zone.
---
Would extractors. There available at lakeside cabins as well as the Gorge Junkyard. 
---
To see what people are talking about. It’s just the nuke mission that’s got me down, collecting the eight codes is tedious and boring...
---
Yeah, this would only be used for griefing players and causing server problems. I do not see any fun or upside to allow building like that.
---
Under resources on your building tab, just place a harvester and power it. You should see a big long pile of logs
---
Theres probably a better way to do it, but heres the bots user page (click on the comments tab)

---
one of the first time I spotted him there was a guy on mic talking to a friend nearby and for the first few moments I was positive it was the mothman speaking until he said "let's go farm  white springs a bit while we wait for pizza " 
---
so either it was the guy nearby I saw afterwards speaking over the mic  or the mothman has spoken directly to me and I'm now his one true disciple . 
---
but just in case I'm building a temple at white springs filled with pizza , so sayeth our lord mothman , praise be !
---
Flatwoods Monster is a lie that vault dweller parents tell their vault dwelling children to get them to bed at night. /s

I'm at about 300 hours and haven't seen it yet.
---
Agreed, I was a bit sore about not even having a free tree.
---
allthatshitbyyou.jpg
---
Look for a large pile of logs. Wood extractor is placed over that.
---
How did I not know this was even a thing?
---
Praise Mothman thanks for sharing your story!!!
---
Wouldn't it be fantastic if having the quest active caused them to spawn?
---
I'll look into this more, thanks for the idea. :)
---
I haven't been crafting for anyone, though to be honest it's rare that anyone actually visits my place despite it being close to the main drag. What I *do* do is join in on quests/events whenever I can, i.e. Collision Course, Powering Up ____, etc., so long as somebody else is already there. I'm fully over doing an entire daily quest by myself (except for the occasional Breach and Clear or Uranium Fever), but if you're trying to get a power plant online, I've got no problem helping you out. I just hope you see it as me helping you and not me doing it all for you. If you want to finish it on your own, do say so.

Imagination, interaction, and exploration. I have the imagination to build new bases to interact with other players, and the curiosity to find new places, learn new lore, and solve the unsolved. 
---
Yeah for real thanks man
---
Wow bro dannnng
---
I don't really agree. As I said earlier, quest areas make sense. Everywhere else should be open game. 
---
I am the devil and I am here to do the devil's work.

I’m with this. Alternatively if your parents are screaming at you too, turn the mic off 😅

Ultra-Light Build Combat Armor Chest can be unlocked by scrapping, and it is the only Ultra-Light that can be (all others are learned by plan, or with the Enclave Scout armor, only by mods). Just keep scrapping Combat Armor parts and you will eventually unlock it on the Chest.
---
So long as you can handle yourself or know where to hide, get out of the way, can get busy and you will die often. Make sure you store all your junk before going and once in a nuke store, store it often .. but I see much lower levels than yourself. WhiteSpring is where the XP is at .. just make sure you have lots of stimpacks and Radaway or on a team where someone has rad sponge, of course a hazmat or PA suit will go a long way.

I had a new character and she was level 15 abouts when all of a sudden I could jump really high. I really wanted to keep it so I was careful not take meds to loose it. I did make it until I was high enough to get starched genes. I love this mutation it gets me places I would have trouble getting to without it.
---
Huh, I hadn't realized the top third or so of the map is basically in Southern Pennsylvania.
---
Same on the level 80 front. I walked in and saw loads of dead Scorchbeasts so I assumed another player did the quest just before me 😅 
---
I played ESO since launch, until I logged into this game... I've played every day for a few hours to "I think I have a problem" hours... it's a great fun game, even the griefers add a layer of content to the experience. I went back to eso for an hour or so to hangout with friends made, the whole time thinking about this game... yup, I enjoy this game. Bugs and all.
---
Thank you everyone for the feed back. I'll be crafting a bunch to scrap tonight as long as it doesn't cost a shit ton of BF
---
The separate PvP and PVE servers can’t come fast enough for me.  For now I’m done with workshops. I love the game except for PVP and I hate that claiming a workbench means you’ve consented to let another player kill you. At least taking a workbench doesn’t turn off pacifist. I’d rather have someone kill me than accidentally kill someone that’s just trying to help defend the workshop. 
---
On PC most every player I’ve met been friendly but yesterday on two different servers I was killed after claiming a workbench for lead. I’m level 170 something, have never turned off pacifist and don’t intend to unless I go on a dedicated PVP server to duel with someone.

SaltySpitoon187 if need still fell asleep 
---
Psn ? Sorry fell asleep 
---
Yessir. Did this the other day. It’s not the queen though sadly, but I was still shocked to see it cut through a level 80 scorchbeast like butter.
---
I’m itching to see how this fares against the queen. 
---
Psn? Sorry fell asleep , lmk if still neeed

I used to do lightweight armor for when I got out of PA for crafting, etc but now I spend more time outside power armor.  Carry 2 gatling guns, one is AA that I can use outside of PA but I also have a handmade and some rifleman perks.  My non-PA armor is all carry weight reduction legendary pieces but its 2 junk 20% and 3 food/drink/chems 20% pieces currently.  I can carry more outside of PA now.
---
south of yellow sandys still.. always spawns at my camp. 
---
(bonus: graham the super mutant takes that road, so he visits my camp sometimes.) 
---
PT I just woke up it’s 10 am rn 
---
I did. I was well fed, had nothing except my mutations. I took a screen shot but don’t have it on me. I just wanted clarity because it doesn’t seem right.
---
They do. It just lists the materials you would otherwise need. It will let you apply the mod without them.
---
So skip it. It’s easy enough to bypass if you don’t want to do the collecting
---
I personally have not come across this glitch, at least on PC. I can sometimes see flickering on objects in the far distance, but never close up like this. Have you tweaked the .ini files at all? could be whats causing the glitch if you are on PC. Looks like your playing borderlands or something, gives the interior a cartoon look.
---
I have yet to see this problem posted here. Hopefully a fix is out there for you
---
Lmk psn if still want 
---
Absolutely!
---
That would have probably been good to put in your initial post.. about the monorail pylons.. people have built up there before, but they may have changed the way it worked after some patches. 
---
SaltySpitoon187 lmk if still want 
---
Says you
---
I believe so. It’s one of those “leveled list” things where plans are included as one of the possible rewards. But the chance of plans, let alone one you want, are probably pretty low. I’ve done around 20 Silent Night events since then and haven’t gotten another plan. 
---
I work alone.

Great video, this is a new oxhorn, spoilers at the very end.
---
I indeed almost went throught the passage almost everytime I went there, somehow I noticed it without giving any thought to it, and wow it is a nice discovery...
---
Thanks a lot for info !
---
np
---
ill just let you get back to hating triggered boy. stop calling people stupid online to make yourself feel better.
---
Agreed with most of this.
---
The game is great as long as you have the storyline and side quests. Once you've worked through all of that, though, there isn't that much to do except grind. And grind. And manage your inventory. And grind.
---
I took a break once the game felt more like a chore than a game, but I'm hopeful the upcoming PvE content breathes new life into it for me.
---
There are some real issues with the game (and haven't really played in more than a month as a result), but it feels like a lot of the negativity is just hopping on the hate bandwagon because it's the cool thing to do.
---
No problem, I think the number of replies multiplier that get added to the flair screws it up if you are trying to search. For example, if you click on the flair under a post with "bethesda replied x 13” it will show you only the posts that they have replied 13 times to, which will likely result in showing you that single post. 
---
Thanks autobot. You have been more than helpful ;)
---
Wow.  What a great service. How much for a full set of X-01?  (I’ll give you my level 40 T60 if that will get me a discount.). 
---
Also, are you selling fusion cores?  If so, how much?  
---
I’m sorry if these questions were already answered. I’m at work and can’t browse them comments. 
---
Yeah I couldn’t face FT-ing out and having to go through the maze again. No matter how many times I go through silos I still get confused. 
---
Ok. thats all I can think of. Any perks that drop things? Nightbreed during daytime or the like?
---
at least a wreath or something stupid like that.. anything!!
---
It is a legal item in the game. Here's Bethesda's official response on it:
---
https://imgur.com/Ln20atE

It was one of the limited time items long ago

I run it from an SSD too and the load times are a lot better!

Apparently Blackbird has been there twice, so it could easily return again.

If you have asbestos armor you can molotov yourself and get most surrounding beasties with the area damage

Nope. I’m wearing Power Armor so some stats should be higher but they’re low.

Bethesda considers the Marine Armor Helmet a legal item in the game. Here's Bethesda's official response on it:

https://i.imgur.com/Ln20atE.jpg
---
Vanguards armor, perks like evasion, ironclad, serendipity, etc 
---
Perk ans Special builds You will find online, adjust them as You see fit to Your gameplay style. Scavange a lot. Collect almost everything since You wont know what gives what at start (every junk item shows scrap type in your inventory) Save every type of ammo, you may wanna use it later with different type of gun. Scrap guns and armour, that gives You mod plans, though armour mods after scraping are much rarer then weapon.  Dont bother with taking over workshops unless You are ready for some pvp as some players use that as reason to attack You, to be honest they are not even worth a risk. Farm Power plant event when You reach one. Every one of them gives You free generator plans up till You get fusion generator (100 power production). Explore, do quests, kill mobs.
---
I equipped Jesus on my steering wheel.  
---
It's up my aaaassssss.
---
No, I’ve just been procrastinating and playing Tesla Vs. Lovecraft 
---
Blocker, lone wanderer, fireproof, Suppressor, serendipity, dodgy, Ironclad, the list goes on and on. 
---
There are a ton of different legendary armor pieces you can wear with varying levels and types of protection. Power armor users do not get the benefits of armor or underarmor. 
---
The PS4 had an error and auto-closed the game. This was recently fixed. You missed that. That was not fun. There was also the pipboy freezing glitch. After loading into the world near a CAMP, opening the pipboy locked controls. The only fix was to die or quit to the main menu and reload.
---
There were a few others, like a team not being loaded into a server from the main menu. This one isn't game breaking until the leader gets into a room with no space.
---
I agree that design decisions are no problem. But again, the FO1/2 crowd could argue against that.
---
Ironclad, barbarian.
---
Also legendary effects from armor.
---
I like to run around without PA, I can do more damage without it. But im pretty fragile and die pretty easily lol. Need more endurance, but I cant decide what special I want to deduct from.
---
Sneak + Marsupial + a full suit of maxed-out, Vanguard armor on a VATS crit build means I don't get hit often. I use power armor for nuke zones and carrying capacity. I do get lazy and try to tank some stuff and regret it but being sneaky is your armor.
---
Also, there are tons of people running around with low health and insane DR due to a combination of build/legendary effects/mutations. 
---
Sentinel Assassin armor if they PvP and don’t move. Cavalier Assassin if they PvP and sprint. Some run a mixture for PvE. It’s all in the armor stars and the perks associated with the style of play. Unyielding is you play Bloodied. Vanguard if you play high health. 
---
1 Bolstering, 1 Vanguard, 1 Unyielding, 1 Assassin’s is what I use. I feel like I have well-matched 1-on-1 PvP but I can’t generally take on another team by myself.
---
Well, it's not quite the straightforward, but yes, it would be technologically doable to do it that way. However, it opens up legal questions that those working on a big mod like this don't need to deal with. It's a risk, and like I said, the actors' unions are no joke. Re-recording is easier than fighting off takedown notices 
---
Don't have to worry too much about resistances if you don't get hit.  Non-PA users tend to be a bit of a glass cannon.
---
That being said, there's some really nice regular armor with great stats, not to mention legendary bonuses that can make you a bit tanky.  Not going to get the same physical resistances as T51 armor, but they can still get pretty nice.
---
I'm ~65, and while my gear really sucks for that level, I do OK with smaller groups and singles, and I've run SBQ a bunch in just my hazmat suit (though I do die a bit more than I'd like, but it gets the job done).  Great armor isn't absolutely necessary unless you're trying to melee a mob of glowing zombies.
---
It would take way to long to explain the numerous ways to achieve that... not trying to be a  ass but if your lvl 93 and havnt figured it out without researching it yet or trial and error ur gonna be in trouble ...so many factors ...your legendary armor pieces come into play ...your perk cards your build ..if u play solo or if your a team player ..there is literally tons of different configurations to get u to that point ..it basically comes down to your own build and playstyle ..look at read or research the perk cards and armors to figure it out  because without knowing what ur trying to achieve no one can give u a answer really...a good place for you to do mock up builds would be nukes and dragons that might help u ..good luck 
---
Gauss has great damage and fire rate, the only problem is the heavy ammo and small ammo capacity.
---
Whaaaa you mean people game the PvP system?! /s
---
I wish they would eliminate PVP from adventure mode completely once survival mode comes out, or at the very least limit it to workshops
---
If you have your water purifier or resource extractor locked at your camp, anyone taking from it should get a notice saying "key required" (and getting a key is impossible for someone who doesn't own the place).
---
NOTE: What I am saying should ONLY APPLY TO ADVENTURE MODE.   Essentially, I'm saying that douche bags should be forced to play the game in survival. 
---
I was hoping that the assholes would leave us alone once survival mode comes out, but the more I thought about it, the more unlikely it seems. 
---
Most of the assholes enjoy  being a big fish in a small pond- which means they'd probably rather harass low level players in adventure mode than fight skilled, leveled players in survival mode.
---
So I don't think survival mode alone will solve the problem.
---
I'll never understand the crazy impact they claim everything puts on the server. It's constantly updating your location and everything around you, yet somehow crafting items can bog the whole server down. A server with 24 people on it. Other games can handle hundreds of people all crafting things at the same time, but for some reason, this is some huge task for Bethesda.
---
I have now done 3 at once but I tend not to want to do this again, just not worth the time or ammo to do anymore....
---
Do they disappear when you loggout?  Wondering bc if they do then it would be pointless to dump excess at the end of my play session and I should do that at the beginning of a session.
---
I'd like to get 4000 caps for it. I'd also be willing to trade if you've got any interesting legendary items. Preferably 3* combat armor or anti-armor weapons.
---
Bedezduh encourages murder and robbery against the new and the weak, simple as that. I told my friends how the game was set up and they’re like wtf and stayed away from it. 
---
In practice, that's probably how it would work
---
We're gonna need a trailer building set for this as well.
---
So it's more the legendary effect.
---
Full set of unyielding armor by 20% health gives you +15 on every Special ability.
---
Full set of vanguard armor gives you +175 Ballistic and energy resi on top if full health
---
Full set of bolstering armor +175 ballistic and energy resi by low health
---
Got a heavy combat or marine armor for Max defense 
---
In combination with a second legendary perk like sentinel (full set gives you +75% dmg reduction while standing) or Cavalier (full set gives you +75% dmg reduction while sprinting) and some Perks that's give you dmg resi and energy resi, you got a damn massiv dmg and energy resistance. That's it :) 
---
Ia! Ia!
---
I'll check my stash when I get off work I may have a few 3 star anti armor. Also combat I'll let you know around 3:45 EST
---
Tried that............
---
I won’t be on for about another 10 hours, but if you’re on then DM me your Beth name and I can join ya there. 
---
I let myself die unless Im on a resource grind, I just hop places where enemies cant get and snipe them or run and sneak. I hate power armor 
---
Yeah I havent launched yet but been in the silos and made it to the last steps alone and it isnt that bad really. I know I can do it alone no problem....I think I finally will pull it off in the next few weeks....
---
Ah I just looked it up and you are correct my friend. Not that I didn’t believe you I just wanted to know. The Ghast is based off of the actual snallygaster then 
---
Witcher 3 wasnt an online only game that required servers that actually cost bethesda lots of money SON
---
Scaly Skin Mutation as well
---
Lol yeah 😂😁
---
Back before explosive patch I might break 1 weapon my 2SE lever action. But we killed her before the 20 minutes was up and no one was stacking anything. We had 10 guys and took us 15 minutes and close to 1000 rounds of ammo. 
---
Got some stable cobalt flux and a plan. No legendary armor or weapons. Not really worth fighting the queen nowadays. White springs still had the best chance of getting good drops without using up so many resources. And has all the necessary ingredients to create any stable flux you want. 
---
Then you'll die alone.
---
I love it on PC, I am on almost every night....
---
You ran across me on day two of my playing. It made a huge difference in my decision to stay after being griefed by a couple of high levels later on. 
---
Thanks for the plans.
---
And they need to remove Wood armor pieces!
---
I'm not arguing that WS is the lowest denominator of farming spots, but WT is always empty on my servers when I go. :)
---
Yeah. I used mods to put it in the game though and I loved it!
---
Avoid lights, turrets, crops. Use as little as possible and build for the terrain. The idea for a Mothman church sounds awesome, if i wasn't working on my bar I might make one. I would probably go to the mire or forest with heavy tree cover.  Keep it small it looks better, maybe like 8 x 3 foundations with a small upper floor for a bedroom. Pews, lanterns, candles, small garden. Keep it dark, creepy, tucked away. As for plans, Watonga. I get many plans from the administration building, with the AI at the top. What you don't need sell to a vendor and buy plans from them. 
---
Thanks for this
---
Such a huge comment section, I don't blame you. 
---
I do have a couple X-01 suits. One is a level 40, one is my old personal use level 50 suit. It's got a few mods but nothing special. 500 for the level 40, 600 for the level 50.  
---
If you want a brand new crafted X-01 suit, I'd have to figure a reasonable price. 
---
Keep an eye out for my upcoming post, it's going to have added info and features!
---
Apparently they were able to fly. At least that’s what the German settlers said lol

---
&gt; killing ghouls in golf attire.
---
Yes.  Those are the Unruly Ghoul Golfers.
---
I’m 43 so that level 40 suit sounds perfect. 
---
I have a bunch of mutations, max strength, gladiator, blocker, radicool, 4 pieces of unyielding armor keeps my damage resistance around 350ish, I could use some better armor. I usually have about 25 to 35% hp to radiation ratio. I have the auto stimpack perk in agility that saves my bacon a lot. I still die but I can lay down a lot of hurt. 
---
Before adrenal reaction was busted my non bloody supersledge was hitting for just over 900.
---
I keep my PA for nuke zones. 
---
So u were triple their level then ? They were say for example lvl 10 guys and u are lvl 100 + ..unless I read it wrong the cap count shows u are the way higher level and they are basically fresh out the vault...not to shabby then if they gotcha ya .
---
I'm 49 and just realized you can craft adhesive at a cooking station.  Just need tatos, corn, mutfruit and purified water I believe.
---
I had a Fallout76custom.ini that I  use to completely remove DOF, but  I removed it from the files before taking these screenshots, but with,  or without the custom.ini,  it's still present, I just removed it for the  sake of an unmodified screenshot.
---
The one big thing I'm hoping for it that you can show your camp location on the map so people will know what camps have vending machines with stuff for sale.
---
Tbh when we can officially do factions enclave and BoS shouldn't be a true faction. We're really close to DC and the Pitt. When the bos heads east  from California if BoS is thriving in WV they would definitely run into us, which is a problem. Joining the enclave is a little less of a canon issue though. Reviving the responders and free states has no consequences though.
---
The monorail is my wanted build right now, but this applies to many kinds of builds. Another one I would like to do is on top of another building. 
---
I doubt you'll get many takers here...At least in my experience, I find handmades all the time, but i want a TSE handmade, and wont buy one...ill either find it or ill never have one.
---
it has a great feel to it and very low recoil....you might get lower level players interested..hope so!
---
If the medical scrubs and surgical mask with the laughing cartoon smile on it are discounted il be tempted, I’ve had my eye on them for a while cause I want to go on a stimpacking reviving spree in them lol
---
Cool. I'll be on tonight, shoot me a friend request and I'll let you know when I'm on!
---
No problem. Going to see how long I can keep it going. 
---
&gt; (I got heavy combat plans from harpers, sturdy from watoga station)
---
Heavy and Sturdy Combat Armor Torso, Legs, and Arms are available at both.  But not all the time.  Seems at most one of each, Sturdy and Heavy, (randomly) will be available.  Sometimes none, sometimes one or the other.
---
The vendor plan patch was either incomplete or poorly explained, and things are not as "always" as they said it would be.
---
You can leave the silo and come back within x amount of time without progression loss
---
But they always run away lol. STOP IM TRYING TO GIVE YOU FREE THINGS!!! \*\*Level 10 runs away as fast as they can.
---
&gt;Is 88 an alarming number to you? 
---
well yeah . to avoid geting banned alot of dupers only duped a few items to the 100s
---
The "golfer" Ghouls can only spawn as regular feral ghouls and not any of the tougher higher level versions. They wear golf attire type clothing (there's 3-4 versions, some of which look like player wearable gear)
---
They do spawn in non-nuked Whitesprings at higher levels very rarley. Grouping with low level players and then searching the ghoul spawn near the giant "water main break" hole in the fairway is generally the best way to spawn them
---
Good to know. I have only launched a couple nukes and still get lost. Lol. 
---
Screw it. Do a Netflix tie-in. Nuke a Christmas light-covered house, get the Demogorgon and the entire Upside Down.
---
This was the work around I used at that level. It make no sense but you do what you gotta do.
---
I’ve also had my T60 painted by the lord, great service! My question to you would be.... if you could have any mod that you don’t have, but that is currently available in the game, which would you pick?
---
It's cause the Rifle IS scorched it hisses "one of us" , "not one of us" doesn't it!!!
---
I don't think it exists for some reason. I'm in the same boat as you and server hopped til I dropped and have never seen a plan or a mod.
---
Just sent you a friend request. I think my gamer tag is also public avenger. 
---
Its from a mission somewhere. I know I got them for free.
---
My build relies on not being seen if I am I can move to a new position and re engage from range. I control the battle field and decide when and where to attack. Using marsupial I can get into good spots to snipe and I carry a good supply of chems in the event I need to heal. Not using power armor is very doable if you have the right build. Legendary armor also makes a huge difference which is something you loss use of when in PA
---
Hmm. But there needs to be an "I'm actually a 500 hour player running a new level 1 build" emote. I feel bad when some level 30 calls me over and tries to hand me all this stuff. Dirty twink feeling between the shoulderblades or something
---
Great post. Super simple solution to a real problem. I’m sure the dev team will look into this because it just makes too much sense, suggestions like this are going to help make this game better and better.
---
This game, while fun in some aspects, has proven how disconnected Todd is from his player base.  It would require a book length post to explain all the ways. 
---
I'm a sneaky bastard and when I want to not be seen I don't wear my PA
---
I concur with regard to the sentinel armor. I have a mismatched set of 5 pieces of armor (chameleon, troubleshooter's, etc.) that all have the sentinel effect of 15% damage reduction when standing still. Those armor pieces combined with things like Nerd Rage, Blocker, Serendipity, Fireproof, etc. allow me to withstand many attacks and take little damage.
---
Some enemies still kick my butt if I go at them head on such as the Mirelurk Queen. My strategy now  is to use sneak and an instigating melee weapon to take enemies out in one hit, including the Mirelurk Queen if the circumstances are just right.
---
Did you do all of the treasure maps. I'm very low level rn, so have plenty to conquer in the world. I am just curious because I only ever see a few people mention treasure maps. I've only collected one so far. 
---
Man that is awesome.  Me and my two buddies dominating a server last night.  Dozens of kills until finally our bounties were so high, some level 90 bro in power armor tried to come collect.  We kept killing him till he got really upset and rage quit, lol.  It was glorious, the guy was so mad on mic, which we would have streamed it.  Every time we killed him he kept getting madder and madder.  
---
**Welcome to the Wasteland**
---
The FROST mod for Fallout 4 made lockpicking (and everything else in the game) insanely hard. I'm now a master lock picker due to that. Still suck at hacking though.
---
Yeah, I know. I specifically said "this always online games as a service model with promises of "Free dlc" with no drop date and no information and insane prices on mundane nonsense cosmetics just irks me to no end and I don't want to support that sort of system"
---
I don't like the always online "buy our microtransaction" model of gaming, which was why I said some games now are fundamentally developed with this in mind instead of just delivering an amazing experience they deliver drip fed content designed to put microtransaction items in the faces of children to buy. It's reprehensable and I dislike it. 
---
I'm 96, they were 94, 56. When I died I could see 96 caps leaving, when I killed them, their bounty was 10-15 caps, so I only got 10-15. I cant say what they lost, only what I gained. I assumed its an equal and offsetting market, but it wouldn't shock me that the game got their cut as well. 
---
Agreed, maybe it wouldn't really be BoS because we have no contact with Maxson, but called something else and using everything left behind at Defiance? So it's that Faction's framework with Vault Dwellers running it and recruiting?
---
You're right. Same for the Snallygaster.
---
Yeah, I noticed that too (had to hop a few times to find those). 
---
I dont get that at all. I still dont understand whether or not vendors inventory are instanced per player, per server, or some of both. 
---
If its both, why?
---
I know grahm has instanced loot per player, because I found him. Had players spawn on me, left the server and rejoined the same one, and he had different loot (pre patch 5). But I also did this on the current patch with the charleston vendor bot, where I relogged and got the hunters long coat.
---
I tried this. Had a sweet set up too. A guy came to buy serums and stable flux, Somehow he spawned inside my locked up camp and eventually left it. I told him to go to my service window and then he picked my locks. 
---
I asked what he was doing, he said he needed a workbench. I told him I had them on the outside for players to use. He asked if I had the flux. I said of course I have what you need. He starting blowing up my base, Since this was after the patch my explosive weapon did nothing and he one hit me with a melee. 
---
He raided my bag and then realized I’m smarter than he was, I do not carry the items I sell until right before they are ready to buy at my service window. 
---
He destroyed my base but no big deal I had everything to replace it. I eventually left because he had friends joining in to destroy. He talked a lot of crap in the party and played dumb. 
---
Guys like this could ruin the game for newer or younger players. I reported him for their sake. Not that anything will happen to guys like this, but I’m sure he has been around causing issues to other players as well. I decided to leave the vendor business for awhile until we have vending machines. 
---
Just be careful out there, I would have killed him if Bethesda didn’t nurf the explosives so much. I wish there was a way to activate a security measure that instantly kills anyone within a selected area inside your camp. That would have been amazing. 
---
Hmmm...I could quip that I offer that service - just send them to me and I'll sort it out.  But instead. 
---
1\* weapons - keep (then sell to others) Instigating, Bloodied, Furious, Anti-armor, Two Shot...if they are weapons people use.  it doesn't matter if the rolling pin or tire iron has a great legendary prefix - they are still rolling pins and tire irons.
---
Of note for 1\* weapons - Double and Quad ammo capacity is important for Harpoons, Double barrels and a couple others.
---
2\* weapons - see above, then if they have explosive - you've got a 2-10k caps winner.  Other attributes like +VATs (damage or accuracy), +25% fire rate (guns)  or Swing speed (melee) are highly valued.  
---
3\* weapons - see above, then if they add 90% weight reduction, VAT's cost decrease, and a couple different attribute adds (+1 end), that adds to value as well.
---
1-3\* armors - something else will have to fill out.  I do know that Weight reduction (ammo, chems, weapons, etc) are pieces that people want.  but in general - I don't run armor and don't understand the combinations 
---
When trading with another player, pressing X toggles between seeing the other player's inventory and only seeing what the player is offering.
---
It’s plausible, 4 confirmed it exists
---
I don’t use builds for my medic really. I made my medic the full on support role. I can fix all types of gear over repaired so my wife can just focus on damage for her character. What aspects do you enjoy? Focus on those and pick your perks the way you enjoy playing the most.
---
Check your weapon modifiers, some greatly increase the weapon's durability. 
---
Its a great resource and I appreciate everyone collecting info, but that most is a bit of a mess. I would think it needs to be cleaned up and easier to read to be stickied material. 
---
Tbf, if i leave my car at a body shop and they tell e they've never seen my car when i come for pick up i can very easily get the police involved and possibly get my car back or maybe monetary compensation as well as the persons responsible being fined or having to serve time.
---
If i spent days or weeks farming for a specific legendary drop but need it modded and take it to someone who then decides to steal it an block me I cant do shit and probably wont play again for a bit because it would leave a bad taste 
---
I want people to drop tech data so we can RP BoS soldiers scavenging instead of just Raiders
---
Ok.  I will send over a friend request tonight and if you happen to be on great.  Thanks again for the service you provide to the community.
---
No I forgot it's been glitching latly what sometimes shows is actually wrong ..u get the proper numbers it just doesnt show up right on your screen ..
---
100 percent agree 
---
Yeah the locked supply drops I think are fairly new atleast within 1 or 2 patch versions
---
Never. They’re always from people who aren’t near me 
---
I’ve been researching this exact topic. Apparently the only way to get the bos armor plan is from quests in the Mire/ bog. I’m finishing the bos questline to see if I’ll get it rewarded to me post patch.
---
I stand behind my wife’s tank melee?
---
Well that's a lot cheaper than I was expecting! And thank you for the reply I didnt really pay attention to the amount of replies you had. Itll be several hours before I can get on but I would like the lvl 50 suit
---
Sorry to blow up your post, but I was curious if a full set of level 40 T60 would be cheaper. I didn’t realize T60 had higher ballistic resistance. 
---
I’m guessing people came to his Camp and destroyed it or maxed out his budget. 
---
Already bought both at full price, but the Rockin memories are priceless.
---
Not always for me - even had someone come along and respawn them muties while I was at WT one day.  And I see Uranium Fever constantly being farmed even by very high levels but almost no one will show up if you go do AWOL Armaments.
---
&gt;Here's the thing. PvP et al are features that were actively talked about pre-release. 
---
Todd's statements about PVP were nebulous and ill-defined.   When asked about PVP he said "We're still ironing that out.  We want the atmosphere to be tense, without being 'griefy.'"    
---
Not his exact words, but that was the gist of it. 
---
He basically said "Do you love PVP? This is the game for you. Do you hate PVP? This is the game for you." 
---
Which is why it isn't uncommon to see people bitching about both PVP and a lack of PVP. 
---
Yeah, I put scorched killer on a zealot shotgun and it did worse damage than just zealot. Go figure. 
---
Dude I use ps4 so that would be great if I could get some help thank you 
---
Are you threatening me, Vaultdweller?
---
I’m not arguing against text chat, I think it a great and worth while feature, am just saying PC peeps kind of take it for granted by console players do not. Take BGS other MMO ESO it took two years, two years! Before they added text chat to the console vision, their justification is that they didn’t need to because the game voice system not unlike what we have in 76. 
---
I think most of the ideas people are throwing about are great but their time scale is absurd, it’ll probably be close to a year before any of them are fleshed out let alone implemented. I tell them this and say they should just enjoy the game for what it is but they don’t want to listen. I hope this guy who was banned rightfully or wrongfully picks himself up and just stats over once again because anything that has been built and demolished can be rebuilt and in the end it’s the building that the most fun. 
---
I got my start at that hut.
---
Why stop there? They should just give us an infinite supply of every resource in the game. I mean, I can basically get an infinite amount of stuff if I play the game so why don't they just give me all of it to begin with so I don't have to play it. Gimme gimme gimme.
---
Voluntary cosmetic shop from which you will be able to pick up items even without investing IRL money. Thats not even greedy, thats plainly evil.
---
I have yet to find BOS Mod plans in the wild.  Though many people have told me they received them from maps in Cranberry Bog.
---
Deep Pocketed Combat Plans were removed from vendors in the patch.  But I did find the Deep Pocketed Combat Torso plan in Harper's Ferry Sunday night (2 days ago).  Too bad I need Limbs, not Torso.
---
Mod plans exist in the wild still, but there are so many, it is rare to find specific ones.
---
Oddly enough, the only Armor Mod plans I have seen spawn in Camp Venture have been for Robot Armor (ultra-light and deep pocketed).  Someone needs to tell Beth that Robot Armor is crap...  who knows, maybe that's why the BOS failed in their mission, all decked out in Robot Armor...
---
I have found Marine Armor (not mods) plans for Torso, Arms, and Legs in Camp Venture.  But no mod plans for them there.
---
Lots of loose PA Mods in Camp Venture, including Excavator Calibrated Shocks twice.  PA Mods seem to share a random spawn with loose Weapon Mods on the table left of the Weapons bench in the level 3 locked cage and on the shelf with all the Weapons/Grenades in the Storage Key locked room near the Tech Data Turn-in location.
---
All this talk about crafting stimpacks is starting to Tick me off lol.
---
Sorry couldn’t resist the pun.
---
There are some good charisma perks for that I use team medic which heals close by team members if I use a stim pack. If you are able to share it then anytime anyone on your team heals everyone does. I am working on a medic build I plan to try out if you want to check it out I can link it. 
---
What not the roulette wheel?
---
FF14 ended the world so they could reboot it as 2.0. I guess we now know what event will lead us to Fallout 76: A Wasteland Reborn.
---
I received one for bos legs from an event. I think it was Census Violence. I receive a lot of mod plans doing events. Even after the recent update. 
---
Damn, didn't know there was so many console players. I might use an alt character to build you a template and send you pictures, but past that I wouldn't be able to help.
---
Dannnng well thank bro 
---
Hmm... that may make me reconsider aggressive renegotiations.
---
And thanks for the pointers there a lot of help 
---
Why? Do you just like trolling around and destroying CAMPS?
---
Awesome! This is the stuff that makes the game exciting imo. Hope our paths cross some day. Mwuhahahaha.
---
&gt; I still dont understand whether or not vendors inventory are instanced per player, per server, or some of both. 
---
My friends and I always see different, unique, items on vendors.  With the exception of items that players sell to a vendor.  Those are shared.  And hopping (or, in my case, disconnecting but rejoining my teammates server) changes the non-player sold inventory of the vendors.
---
So vendor inventory is instanced for the player, and created the moment you join a server (recreated if you leave/join the same server).
---
Totally agree! -- interested to see how survival mode changes the dynamic 
---
I prefer the Cavalier cause I run a unyielding build and also a Speedbuild :) mostly Explo shotguns in variety but some times I take out my bloodied powerfist for lvl 91 deathclaws and lurk queens. After 2 hits most creatures are death. But to sprint 2 min at a piece with 75%dmg reduction is really nice. Ran in front of the enemy and shot him in the face with the Explo pumps haha. Would say Max. 3 seconds where I don't sprinting and take a aim. Makes a lot of fun haha
---
I can place more stuff at my camp now then I could at lower levels so something is increasing 
---
Don't you get board? ;)
---
I thought us PC guys maintaining radio silence, never heard anyone or found anyone that could hear me using my Logitech G wireless headset. Got tired of wearing it and just set up an external mic with push to talk enabled. A couple of days later I saw someone with the area speaker icon lit so I gave them a shout and they responded. It the timing may have been coincidental but I’ve talked to several other players sense then. You’re post has me wandering if fallout doesn’t play nice with Logitech G. 
---
For a while I ran a mutant slayer's boxing glove because stat 2 was SS. 
---
Swing speed on fast melees is beyond satisfying to roid out   
---
sadface, anti-armor rip
---
Do you use chems? You might have an addiction 
---
Yes that sounds like the exact information from early January I read on their website. They stated it would be a beta on launch, they'd need testing and player feedback to optimize, and they generally sounded very open to changes from the initial ideas.
---
Before posting here I also searched this sub on pvp and read a post in reaction to the survival mode announcement, upvoted by almost 5K people, asking for having us start new characters. Beteshda replied in the thread they'd discuss the matter, so I wondered if there was news around that, or any other specifics not mentioned on their website.
---
Nice to read about the stash increases and some other changes of lately and looking forward to log back in again today!
---
Yeah, honestly I haven't played in a month. But I love(d) my red PA. 
---
So what you're saying is they need add flying versions as well.
---
Maybe using a fusion generator instead of gas ones? Fewer turrets? Better at lighting? Nothing in the code changes budget or cost of items based on level.
---
Max charisma to support team and endurance to support yourself. Then min/max other stats to fit your combat play style. My medic is max charisma endurance and agility for sneak stealth then random points dispersed into 3s with 2str 
---
Yeah it's one of the best paints... too bad it's only for 51b.
---
Thinking about gettin it. Whats there to do long term or end game?
---
Respect. 
---
Upvoting for the futility of the event.
---
Might wanna include your system
---
Issue is Applying mods still requires the Perks it normally takes to make them yourself (if you have the plans or learned it from scrapping)
---
I got it rewarded from an event the other day. Keep trying events.
---
I did it after following low level into the area. If there was any higher than 80-100, none would spawn. Once I saw none were there I went in and got 7 of the 10 and finished it.   
---
All of them were inside the building at WS by Tennis Courts with only one of them out on the fairway.
---
thx for the offer... but it's not my cup of tea .(
---
Agreed, but it shouldn't be that away.  
---
Both Fallout 3 and 4 have direct links to the thing in the lucky hole mine
---
It's not a bug, it's just no more to do until they update content.
---
I agree, too many unnoticed bugs right now.
---
The one I disliked the most must be the lack of vendors selling plans and mods. 
---
From what I have seen it is assumed that the item cost is what drops as you level. Where at level 5 I could barely place 4 turrets I can now place many more. I dont use turrets however because they still take up alot and i use a fusion generator however it has no noticeable cost difference then the others
---
Good point, thank you
---
No problem
---
20 real life hours?
---
Yup, its crazy man almost like they made it part of the game.... Oh wait.....
---
I only run power armor. I wear the BoS Knight suit (cosmetic only) under it, because it's comfortable and literally made for being worn under power armor, and for RP purposes. 
---
As someone else stated, you're heavily gimping your damage output by not taking stabilized. 
---
My question for you would be, why do you not want to use power armor? Just a style / preference thing? If that's the case you might want to look at other builds. If it's because you're low on fusion cores... they're so easy to come by. Take all 3 power plants and you have enough cores to last for weeks after a few hours of emptying them out every 20 mins or so.
---

---
From beta, no less.
---
This is so impressive I love it! I only recently started collecting records and it's very addicting once you start. You collection is totally awesome! Have you seen the vinyl tracks for Fallout 4? We have a cool set where all the sleeves are magazine and comic art from the game.
---
So right now it can't be completed then?
---
Oh okay then there should be something that when you set up a S.T.O.R.E  there is no option for players to destroy it or lock any picks,  because there should be a prevent damage system that would prevent players from doing any damage to you S.T.O.R.E and a key system but a normal key not pickable, not like this one we now have option to place. and if someone actually would try to pick that lock a message should pop up that you need a key to open this lock. That would prevent bad players from doing anything to your S.T.O.R.E . 
---
This is a great idea. As a gunsmith, I've modded at least 50 guns for people. Only 2 people have directly expressed concerns about giving me their gear to work on. I have been told that I come off as "The real deal" and seem trustworthy. But it would still put a lot of people at ease.
---
Right now I see one main issue with this idea. Currently, you need to have the appropriate gunsmith/armorer rank in order to ATTACH mods, not just build them. So I would still need to have their gun to attach the mod I just built for them. Honestly though, this is a small hurdle to an otherwise great feature. I would totally produce hunting rifle suppressors and scopes en mass. 
---
The debuff is not enough considering how people are abusing it. A team of 4 who bait people in to pvp by having one of them have a high bounty with no caps. The 3 other members dont get any debuff and the victims get no caps from the kill unless they are capable of defending themselves against the ambush 
---
I had a guy that had a wanted level. I shot him a bunch but he had a ton of stimpaks. So I continued to fight him, then I go and blow myself up, comical I know.. 
---
A low level player that could not fight back told me the guy broke into his camp and was hitting him, though he could not be killed yet the lower level player knew this guy was being a jerk on purpose. 
---
So after I died homeboy took the little bit of junk I had and ran back to his base to put it away before I killed him. I followed him stealthily and saw this massive steel base with two fusion generators, a rad shower and so many nice and neatly put together things. 
---
I said to myself what and idiot.. I messaged and asked him why he took my stuff. He said cause I was trying to kill him. I said of course your wanted right? Since he was messing with a new player I felt the vigilante inside telling me to teach him a lesson he wouldn’t forget. 
---
Lots of rounds later and to my surprise I did not get a wanted level while destroying a wanted persons base, I took my time while homeboy was out doing who knows what. 
---
He returned to find his base in ruins. Including his hard to rebuild items... I told him he use to have a nice base and he came after me in power armor of course and bat. We dueled it out a little and he disappeared again. To my surprise he went and repaired his base.. well sorta as much as he could.
---
He said my junk helped him fix his whole base... It didn’t I had some wood steel and a few odds and ends nothing to fix the damage I did. Lol
---
So I went and saw he was able to repair one generator and a few walls and furniture. Most his work benches were gone and his rad shower still gone. I took out his generator again and he left after that. 
---
I do not like players like him going around being jerks to new players and carrying his wanted level around like he did nothing wrong. Then to get cocky and rude as well. 
---
Anyway wasteland justice prevails against a punk who needed a wake up call. 
---
The horde ones are the ones that piss me off most. Spend 40 caps for fast travel, endure a 2 minute loading screen, then the thing has just....gone.
---
But horde events have been fairly broken ever since launch, so maybe this is a different issue.
---
Good point because it did say that. Well done 🙏
---
I'm now thinking about investing my time and engaging group of people to build our own game. It will most probably include cosmetic microtransactions to pay for the servers. We're not an AAA company, we're not even a studio yet, just bunch of people from the industry thinking about making something they'd love to play themselves.
---
Like any idea that wants to be a candidate for being a good one, it has to be scalable. It has to be something that can actually be done given our access to time and resources, and it has to be something that players would actually want to play. And you know what? Most likely nobody will buy it anyway. But since that's something we'd love to play ourselves, we still can start it, give it out for free to gamer friends, gather feedback, improve it, build community around, and let it evolve adjusting to demand. Somewhere along those lines a cosmetic store could start paying for servers. I'd love to take it a step further, and engage the modders community. I'd love to build a game that's transparent, and lets people to build content that's then incorporated to the base free game. But also, let them create cosmetic item alternatives they could submit to game and earn their cut of the sale. That whole vision would not be possible if not for the commonness of microtransactions.
---
Not in the sense that it's gone from your Pipboy, no.  But it's "complete" for now until they add more for you to find.  (Imagine it will show up in new content updates sending you to the other Vaults).
---
Np! I only know cause I’ve gone in a couple times and realized I didn’t grab my Keycard or Fusion Cores so I had to go back haha
---
Ahh, okay that makes sense, thank you.
---
Toxic Valley / Ash Heap / Savage Divide (level wise) and guns are everywhere. If you use Ballistic Weapons, go find yourself a Hunting Rifle and a Shotgun for support
---
That’s how I get all of mine 
---
Yeah, but one fusion generator uses a lot less space than three or four generators. 
---
It's possible something in the actual fallout exe changes cost based on level but nothing accessible via the editor shows that, and it would be weird to add it there. 
---
On top of that, people have [done fairly extensive and planned out tests](https://old.reddit.com/r/fallout76settlements/comments/aontef/results_of_my_camp_budget_experiments_does_budget/) and seen *no* change in cost based on your level. So I don't see any reason to believe it's actually changing right now. I think it *should*, but it's not.
---
I mean seriously. I’ve said in a couple threads now that I’m tired of all the dead horses being constantly beaten and I think changing the sticky would help a ton 
---
Thanks! I will try that.
---
I want player to be able to set up their own radio stations. How cool would it he to be walking the wasteland and just puck up random radio stations with DJs and music.
---
I did finish the BOS questline (Belly of the Beast) post-patch.  It did not yield any BOS plans.  Only the Ultracite PA and then of course the updated Ultracite PA Plans from Taggerdy's computer in Fort Defiance.
---
I have level 40 and 50 T60 suits in stock, they don't come in level 45. I sell those for 500 caps as well. 
---
The problem is that my shack I made at level 5 with the exact same items took up my whole budget where if I build it now it does not. So something is changing 
---
You upgrade your weapons every 5 levels so I'd honestly just use whatever legendaries you've picked up until level 50. I just followed the main quest and received appropriate weapons along the way.
---
You should really just concentrate on a specific build paying attention to what specials you pick and what perks you choose. You can worry about weapons later. My 2 cents 
---
I'm on xbox as well Gt mikeeparks level 155 If I'm on and ya need any help grinding, gear, junk, or food and water hit me up it makes game better when we help others
---
Electric power connectors to keep wiring tidy have an absurd budget cost. 
---
I haven’t played FO76 in a while now (logged in once to see if I had been banned, but still intact). Good to see that “war never changes” in FO76. I have had issues like these from the start. What frustrated me most was using a sniper build, taking down a leader or legendary, then by the time I went to loot, the bodies were gone. Must have hit the floor and kept on going. 
---
This what happens when people,who play online games, leave from online game and people, who play singleplayer games, stay. What makes this whole thing even more laughable, is that players who don't want to PVP have been given so much protection to avoid it- slap damage, server hoping, no perma death, cheap repair/build costs and blocking. 
---
Yup, overseer must be around somewhere, she leaves a fresh note after you launch a nuke for the first time. I also figured that it must be open ended so they can further the game in DLC.
---
I came home from work yesterday and my gf had collected me 13 regular stealth boys and 3 stealth boy mark 3s from just one day of farming so yeah 88 isnt that fishy. And guy which one of your friends didnt drop off his junk beforehand? Lol rookies! Jk 
---
Thanks!But the main reason is the my of my game play I do is quest so I’m a head of most people for my level and the areas I’m in are mostly mire and savage divide so it’s hard for me most of the time 
---
I'm a filthy casual who's taking his time with the game and is only level 29. I did find a plan for strengthened combat armor (limbs, I think?) this weekend, but I have no combat armor and can't craft any (doesn't show up as an option when crafting), and I don't have the armorer perks. I found it after fighting off some ghouls at the Willard Corporate Housing area next to the water park. It was in a trailer near the center of the park.
---
I read the plan but it isn't in my list of cratable options (didn't bother to look up why). Strangely, I can build an eyebot helmet, though. No idea how I learned that one.
---
I assume you are past this point, but just in case - There is a point in the quest line where there is no marker, you just have to find the next tape on your own, and if you follow the main quest you will. I think it was the one at the Top of the World that didn't show a marker for me.
---
It's too bad DC is far enough you can't see  it  from the mountains.
---
Imagine how eerie it would have been if you could see a swirling, glowing maelstrom above the Capital Wasteland,  since  it did  get  hit  very hard, and since  a  lot of the region is still pretty radioactive  200 years  later, imagine what it's like only 20 years after the bombs dropped.
---
Yeah, the broken ones are disappointing. And then there's the one like 7600 hours for only 20 atoms.....that should be more like 500 atoms at the very least. I killed one of every creature on that list for killing a huge creature and it just refused to unlock.
---
Heres some other locations that I've found regularly spawn frames, cores, and/or parts.
---
SPOILERS:
---
1. &gt;!grafton dam: in the shed inside the fenced area.  snipe the mutants first.  they will gang up on you.  This one used to be every time, now its about 80%!&lt;
---
2. &gt;! in a broken down shed about 1/2 way between grafton steel plant and the alligator.!&lt;
---
3. &gt;!Gorge West:  you'll need the key from camden park.!&lt;
---
4. &gt;!camden park:  in the raider camp inside the roller coaster.  completing the challenge here  dropped 2x cores.  Also found 2 more cores in an ammo box.!&lt;
---
5. &gt;!lumber mill top left of the map: careful, lots of mutants here.  mutants will respawn in large numbers rather quickly, so don't hang around the armor station too long.!&lt;
---
6. &gt;!arkos pharma: 2nd floor, in the cage!&lt;
---
7. &gt;!one of the half round metal hangars at Wade airport.  I forget which hangar.!&lt;
---
8. &gt;!basement of the blue hornwright? building southeast of the Posiedon plant.  Completing the quest here will give you some goodies. !&lt;
---
I believe in armoring all dwellers for reasonable prices! Shoot me a friend request (gt: TurdFergusonn) and I’ll get you taken care of tonight!
---
like why are they recalled?  I hate that.
---
According to the wiki, I have found every one of the tapes, I believe I even was rewarded the Atoms for collecting all the tapes in the objectives thingy.
---
Yeah, there are a few things that have weirdly high costs.  Like the Fertilizer collector, which has a modifier in the code that increases its cost to 48 times what its geometry would imply or the terminal which has 7 times its geometry. If the terminal actually automated stuff I could see why it has such an increased cost but all it does is let you change stuff as you select it, not automate it, so the increased cost seems odd.
---
Thanks i have some weight reducing items that i may try.
---
This all day. If you attempt to scrap a favorited item it should have a popup window to ask you 'yes/no' before it poofs
---
Its really confusing since you have to lockpick and steal from the cargobot for nuclear cards, so who knows what's in that supply box.  This is just a moronic design change by Bugthesda, but yes everyone should be careful.  Unless its a drop from a cargobot I shot down, I'm leaving it all alone.  The contents of supply drops are quite useless anyways.
---
But yet they still complain.  I simply don't get it especially since a majority of players are squishier than ghouls.  I mainly play single playee games myself, but thats because they offer more adventure.  This game has the potential to combine that sense of adventure and progression along with the heart pounding intensity that is PvP.  
---
Maybe near the museum 
---
If there bounty is more then there caps then you only get what they have which kind of sucks since they can get more from you then you can them 
---
Just give all the enemies wings. And the scorchbeast scream.
---
I cannot wait. Wandeeing the wastes will be so much more tense 
---
Thankyou for your input it was just to try a different style but you are right its not worth losing the stabilised perk.  I enjoy using the heavy weapons and the occasional shotgun.
---
Well someone was going to send me a pic of place we’re I could put it and just wondering if there are other creepy cool place to make it at you know 
---
I miss the Dude vibes from that Tumbleweed song  :(
---
Will you be on in about 3hrs?
---
Lots of people say that, but if you test it while eliminating the variables as /u/ProximaDust did in the link I posted above there is no change. There's also nothing in the code that would account for a change. I would like nothing more than to be shown that I'm wrong, but you saying that it's so when the evidence says it isn't just isn't enough.
---
Where do you get them from though?
---
Craft and scrap light combat arms. Those are the cheapest to make.
---
I found them a lot easier  with explosives  and explosive Legendarys  but don't know  about after explosive Nerf as I have not encountered another one yet
---
Is there actually (not just implied) something sleeping down there? I looked around trying to find it but never did, just a secret room and the cache with the locked keypad.
---
That will count for unlocking chest mods?
---
Handmades are common enough I would think that most high level people who have them, can mod them. I unlocked all 42 handmade mods, 30 LE mods, and am working on the radium (13)/tesla (4)/gauss (30). You may have more luck with one of those, or the heavy guns.
---
I grew up and lived most of my life in Pittsburgh.  Naturally, the Pitt was my favorite dlc.  I'd love to go back.
---
My husband's character is junkie built. He's lvl 160 and I gave him a lvl 35 1* Junkies the Dragon yesterday. With all his addictions he got it to do over 700 damage. He just takes any drugs he gets his hands on (get Pharma Farma perk to get extra drugs) and max out your Super Duper combining it with Chemist if you make your own drugs to get extras.
---
Something I noticed though is leaving the server gets rid of your addictions. Husband got booted while using the Dragon, came back to server, and the damage went down to its normal damage until he loaded himself with drugs and alcohol again.
---
Yes send me a message with psn n which you want 
---
I didn't get one when I launched my first nuke
---
I figured as much, but it's nice to have clarity. Glad to see a lot of back and forth with the team and the community now.
---
I dont know much about the data other then what I have witnessed in game. I could literally place probably 5 or 6 of my first camp and still have some budget where it was maxed out when I first made it. My base is like 5 times the size my first one was 
---
Yes, it does. You can unlock any mod for any slot by scrapping any piece. And once learned a mod can be applied to any light/sturdy/heavy variant. You now know one of the best pieces of information for learning armor mods by scrapping. It took me thousands of scraps for each set of armor to learn them all, and most were crafted light arms. Good luck!
---
I have close to 300-ish DR/ER with my mixed armor pieces, still decent protection.  My non-PA unarmed character has 400-500 DR/ER from normal armor pieces and various perks/etc.
---
Damn you, that is MY spot for a camp. Lol! Now I know when my camp "cant be placed" it's because of you. Haha. I'll visit ya!
---
One quick note about that. When players move into an area, enemies spawn because the players move in. So there’s really no “clearing an area before people show up”. 
---
I could see the use of having a slightly longer timer there, though. I usually save my .50 Cal and ammo for the SBQ fight and use my Gatling Laser in the Silo, but I do realize not everyone has a varied arsenal. 
---
dynamite with a laser beam!
---
i thought the pitt was in detroit?  maybe im thinking of something else
---
Many of the perks are mentioned. Scorchbeasts do almost no damage to me. Most things do very little damage. I am a paperbag as far as radiation resistance. That is what I am currently working on. I can one shot most things from sneak. 
---
I only use power armor for fast traveling.
---
The biggest challenge for me is charred and glowing ghouls.  They are so fast that if I don’t have a perch they can overwhelm me with rad damage. 
---
it's placed next to the overseers chest at the entrance of the silo.
---
I have a feeling pvp servers are just gonna be players with dupped Assassin sentinel armor standing there dueling like it’s the year 1750. Without it your are just gonna get owned. 
---
Same here, I jumped on after the patch installed and instantly tried to open my pipboy. All controls locked, same as before
---
Have you done a test where you write down exactly what you are making on a low-level character and how much budget it takes up then compared it to the same things, at the same place, for a high-level character? Or are you going by what you recall? Cause the former is what /u/ProximaDust did. I'm going to re-do his test myself later this week to be sure it still applies.
---
Hey Bethesda are these going to make a Mothman faction??? Please consider the idea!!!
---
They not these oof
---
I love this! You absolutely need “I Didn’t Know the Gun Was Loaded”!
---
Hail,Union Merchant!
---
It's a blue print I used and for my first 30 levels I was in the same place and the budget would go up slightly. I would have to pack up and replace the camp down but it was in the same place. 
---
Thats what I thought. 
---
But if thats the case why are some plans not always available, if another player cant buy the plan before I got there? (which a lot of people tend to still believe).
---
Ah stuck at work. I guess sell to the highest bidder lol :(
---
Jumpin' Jive was in? Damn that's a shame they took it out. Hep hep
---
Then that's awesome and I'm sure when I test it later I will get the same results.
---
Hey bro Bethesda make the Mothman cult a faction pls!!!
---
Your missing the point entirely. I'm not asking for an instant delivery of supplies. Im asking for a cargobot that can fly to your workshop, land get the junk then fly back. It would be quicker for a player to just fast travel. The cargo bot adds another option similar to how extractors or purifiers produce items passively over time
---
this isn't a survival game
---
Thanks for the tip on the PS4 buttons.
---
Also, I wasn't aware it had been patched.
---
I now understand, I bought a bloodied SS deathclaw gauntlet and it does 823, without chems. I don’t even have Radicool yet.
---
I dont know the specifics but something has to change with budget in some way. I hope you figure it out lol
---
Correct
---
No, jet just gives me the sight.  
---
Hey bro would you pls consider making the  Mothman cult a faction pls 
---
That is a month for me.
---
You get two (and unlock the recipe to make more) from the Enclave main quest. I think you need 3 yellow fluxes to create new ones? I could be wrong about that part, though.
---
Sometimes I login just to have a look at the list. Thanks for putting it online. Keep it up. 
---
Or train cars from FO4
---
Gracias.  Now that the hard part is out of the way, I just need to find 3* Unyielding Heavy Combat or Marine armor and all the plans to mod them to max... how hard could that be?
---
Bro I got multiple lol not just one lmk when on I’ll get to you 
---
Hey man could y’all consider making the Mothman cult a faction please?
---
I have successfully tamed a scorched beast, didn't last long tho. It immediately attacked my teammate and then became an enemy to me again. Not sure if it was a glitch or not but it was awesome to know it possible. 
---
Me too! Lol holy schnikes, OP don't play! Lol 
---
u/TheroRed said it perfectly! On our list, but the success/failure's make it difficult. Hopefully we can get that Known Issue's restickied soon!
---
The enemy just never sees me
---
Very. Still grinding for those myself. 
---
Maybe there's a bug in the way blueprints work. I'll have to compare it and see if you can make a blueprint at low level, level up, and have the blueprint objects take up less space while the same objects if placed individually, take up the same space.
---
Bro hey make the Mothman cult a faction pls 😂😁 it would be amazing!!!
---
Oh yeah definitely. I would join that faction in a heartbeat. Hopefully have a faction based on BoS that's somewhere between fo3 and fo4 ideology. If we call it the Brotherhood of steel Beth would have to eventually destroy it, eventually change names, or have it very secretive and isolationist. That or decide that nothing in fo76 is canon, which would be a bad move too really 
---
Good luck
---
i took 4 photos and its ok, the only one i cannot understand is the 5th: "at an old fishing hole".....i dont know where it might be. Anyone?
---
Thanks :D 
---
Figuring shit like this out is *my* endgame ;)
---
Good idea!! 🙌👍
---
PC? Ill show you two good spots
---
Post your findings lol 
---
Grahm is pretty cool but what if the Mothman cult was a faction???? That would be even better 😂😁👌!!!
---
Nice I'll shoot ya'll a friend request say I'm the guy from reddit!
---
Revive Taggerdy's Thunder?
---
I got ps4 😭
---
Hell yeah I’ll get on around 4:30
---
My guess is those will become functional once the new content is live.  Those are just a new type of Workbench that is just not active yet.  You can find those distilleries all over the map.  It's clearly part of future content just not enabled yet.
---
LOL @ "everything there is to do in the game in a week of casual play." 
---
I'm not going to argue that there is a wealth of end game content here (it's woefully shallow), but to explore and clear every location, do every quest/side quest, capture and defend every work bench once, do every event even only once and launch/clear a few nuke drops would be in no way possible to do in just 20 hours. Or even 40 (which would be full-time-job level of play, not "casual").
---
Reply to this with list n psn 
---
Handmade is good, if you can find one. Sledgehammer is best melee at that level.
---
You gotta go through some hidden passage ways and there’s a sleeping monster down there. Just look up a YouTube video
---
I sniped one of these dogs, hit it nice in the head and BAM it turned into snake dog and went absolutely bananas for a little bit. I did finally manage to get a hit and kill it but it sure was spectacular fire a few moments.  I hope when my end comes it's just as awe inspiring. 
---
I am being stubborn about playing an inefficient build :)
---
I play a PA-wearing QOL tank, using a bloodied rifle which procs if I can't be arsed to press the stimpack button. It takes me about 5 shots to kill a level 68 mutey, which is way more than a "real" bloodied build (sneaky VATS), but I like it :)
---
I don't really mind grinding the lead and steel, as I can gather at least 500-1000 per hour if I don't get bored first. It's just this is the most lead and steel I have had at one time (did some trading) and I thought the numbers were funny :)
---
OP: Me too. That quickness and the stabby sound. I can face tank things by stabbing them before they can get a hit on me. I also love the animation of the running swipe. Feels like something from assassin's Creed.
---
With my character I went from sledge/explosive shotgun &gt; all rise/furious Gatling &gt; bloodied mole miner gauntlet/tse bolt action pipe rifle&gt; bloodied Bowie knife/bloodied crossbow. Total regression lol
---
Definitely. With screenshots and notes :P
---
Yeah. I'm able to play for a few hours before work in the mornings. That happened within 30 min of logging in. All I could say to myself was "I guess this means no more events that have a legendary enemy at the end until it's fixed. Back to the Technical Data farm."
---
Exclusively under the expert care of Pat Sajak. 
---
There were a ton of horrible bugs at launch. There still are a bunch, but it's way, way better now.
---
OP play too much might be more the issue :P
---
Anytime! I’m sorry you had a bad experience with others, but glad you decided to stay.  If you ever need anything else let me know. 
---
PeOple CanT enJoY sOmEThing I dOnT lIke I aM RıgHt but AlL oF yOu DuMbS lMAO
---
Probably gonna get shit for this because people love giving other people shit for silly things that affect them in no way at all lmao, but I use an XBox One controller on PC, so yes, this is exactly what happened to me.  This is it exactly.  I had my deathclaw gauntlet on to slap down low level mobs while I was doing some business in the forest, then I fast traveled to my camp and from there to Whitespring for some xp grinding.  Armored up, and then this is what happened, yes.  Wanted to be able to switch back and forth from my rifle to All Rise, and this is the bug I kept getting.  Fortunately, thanks to a friend's help I'm no longer as squishy as I used to be, so this bug didn't get me killed, but it definitely could.
---
Damn. That’s not what I wanted to hear. Thx man
---
i thought when you kill the  Queen  you get a 3 star items, what happen to that?
---
I get that a lot too, but I just move to the next one. 
---
I figure it was the same reason the digital version of vice city lost a lot of its music, licensing ran out.
---
No I have 4 mutations and level 2 starched genes and my decontamination shower has never removed anything but rads. If you take off starched genes and walk through it you will lose mutations.
---
White Springs has a fountain that removes diseases and not mutations.
---
So THAT's how it works!
---
Goddamn it, I have to wait until next December :(
---
Happy birthday!!!
---
Something like that. Since we're all vault 76ers we lose touch with the Brotherhood of steel basis, can even make it so eventually we make contact with the Brotherhood of Steel and become allies. I think it would be pretty cool if we ran into the semi canon BoS based in Chicago and find out what's canon and what isn't 
---
Those words... "too much"... is it possible to use them together in a sentence like that? :o
---
does it have a time limit ? 
---
You get more options if you scroll down. 
---
I would suggest near the Lighthouse where the Enlightenment Event takes place as that is how one summons the Mothman.
---
Has the benefit of being accessible to Low Level initiates... I mean players.
---
Ya especially because this presumes all trades are Reddit organized and nobody you meet wandering the wastes is worth trading with lol
---
I was there for every stress test, all but one BETA session, and played for a long while afterward even as my friends all fell off. Unpopular opinion but the game is actually a lot of fun for a long time and has a lot of potential to get even better. Keyword potential. Really it was Bethesda's repeated bad actions, and failures to act that turned me off. I'll check back in somewhere down the line if the dust settles before the playerbase is gone. 
---
Enjoy Appalachia, and hope you keep on doing so.
---
Yeahhhh I like that idea thank you bro
---
Yeah, ive seen that issue brought up.  I personally havent had any trust issues either, but you know, there are dickheads out in the wasteland.
---
If they dont do the easy fix and remove skill requirement (to attach single use mods), My thoughts are:
---
High level players (who would have good legendaries that would be more wary of handing over said item) *should* have said perk unlocked by that point.
---
Low level players are more likely to have non legendary items needed to mod. Whats a high level crafter gonna do with a stolen level 20 pipe pistol? No incentive for the crafter to steal it, in which case the risk of handing over weapon is minimal (if it was me, id probably just craft them a better version for free).
---
Then theres the mid level player who just turned 50 and hasnt gotten that perk. Its always the middle class that gets the raw deal ;)
---
Agreed. One can never play too much :)
---
I don't think it's just you. I get drops at Morgan Town Airport and my Game often locks up for 2-3 minutes around Charleston. My comp is mid to high end so I shouldn't have issues but I guess it's just an issue with the Game itself
---
Mods do not show up in the crafting list.  You have to find the plan for the base item first or have a piece of the equipment to mod. 
---
Sentry helmet and other cosmetic pieces like assaultron helmet can be randomly learned by scrapping certain pieces of special junk dropped by the enemies. 
---
This. Another game for reshade I use is also ‘Home’
---
That’s not legitimate according to Bethesda. A bunch of people have been temp or perm banned for doing that. Can’t pick up anything you know or suspect to be illegal. It violates the TOS according to Bethesda 
---
Oooh this is a really good idea, just don't display anything Favourited. Stop people from accidentally selling their faves too.
---
Correct, Whitesprings has a ton of Abraxo and Toxic Larry's meat and go always spawns 3 snallygasters as well. 
---
When this game has died on console platforms it will still be active on PC. At least assuming Bethesda eventually adds the mod support that it promised.
---
Thank you, and all Union Merchants for welcoming me among us. Hail to you! 
---
L32.  I did not start with a specific build in mind.
---
Due to weapon effectiveness, much of my combat so far has been melee.
---
That said, the 4 guns I use the most are (in order): 
---
Marksman hardened piercing sniper rifle (found, upgraded)
---
Perfect Storm\* (reward for completing a quest)
---
Tactical Combat shotgun (mostly for flying critters)
---
tactical piercing 10mm auto (found, upgraded).
---
backup:
---
38 auto pipe rifle (found)
---
Thats impressive didn't know you could get that high. I was thinking of trying out a shotgun build as i have a decent shotgun and 90% of the associated perks for it and my special stats will allow it and can easy switch between
---
I could give you my vamperic boxing glove of death or my bloodied pool cue...Im sure they might do better... :P
---
You are talking about the Decontamination Arch inside the bunker, that was just a false rumor. As long as you have Starched Genes equipped no method of rad cleansing will remove mutations
---
Thanks everyone. So alot of it is sneak builds and the right armor pieces. I have all the best power suits but I'd like to start getting cards where if I want to switch to a sneak build I can just do so by switching perk cards
---
Yeah...I've bought a lot of games for the same price and gotten less enjoyment and played for a shorter time but still felt satisfied. I think people are treating this as an MMO, which generally have extensive end-game content, rather than a multi-player version of an inherently single player game. I blame the advertising.
---
Thanks dude, I appreciate it. Probably t51b helmet plan, that is the only t51b that I’m missing haha :)
---
Much of it depends on your teammates play-style so I can see why they differ!  One of my teammates uses the "Radicool" perk, so if I were to get the "Rad Sponge" or "Healing Hands" perks they would end up working against his build.  
---
Overall I feel like the best way to be a medic/support in this game is to talk with your team and see what would benefit them most.  If you play random teams, you could keep a stock of helpful cards and swap them out for each group based on their particular needs.      
---
I hope you get it man!
---
It's true. Tesla rifle is bugged. Enemies don't take any damage.
---
I was in the Garahan mining headquarters, liberator boots were in the area so they were easy to dispatch but when I got into the building and killed all the bots, I notice my health bar was still dropping. 
---
I thought it was a little wierd but didn't think anything of it, but then I got 2 broken arms and thank Mothman I have an auto stimpack perk otherwise I'd have died. I quickly did what I came to do but I was still being hit the whole time, no sounds, from either my character being hit or the environment saying there was enemies nearby. 
---
I tried to also use VATS but there wasn't anything there. Didn't see anything in sight but was still getting hit. 
---
I finally said screw it and got out of there, 15 stimpacks later...... and totally screwed armour
---
Visit Pickets Fort. With Wood Chuck equipped and hitting all the wood piles I walk away with something like 450-500+ wood.
---
\[Fallout 76 Build with 6/1/8/15/10/8/8\]([https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#AwUABw4JBwcBAQEAMk8D6AEB8AECLgTEAQFvBbUBA4ABAg0DRALRAQGYAQGCAQXgAQFNAvEBAsgBAiABwAECUQMbAjYCHQPVAQEZAgA=](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#AwUABw4JBwcBAQEAMk8D6AEB8AECLgTEAQFvBbUBA4ABAg0DRALRAQGYAQGCAQXgAQFNAvEBAsgBAiABwAECUQMbAjYCHQPVAQEZAgA=))
---
I also love being the support dude in most games. I was taken back a bit on how the devs handled this. You are super squishy. I wish we could share two perks at once.
---
 I went full resistance and demolition expert so I could have some fun. I feel like Nerd Rage and Serendipity work good but only at low health which sucks because usually at low health your about to die anyway. I tried to take both perks off and did not notice too much of a difference. Not sure what to do there with 5 extra points.
---
Another thing that grinds my gears is that most of the time your friends are downed instantly so you cant revive them.
---
  I wanted to get a flamer weapon and test out the friendly fire perk. When I find a good 3 star one I will let you know how that works. Setting your buddies on fire to heal them sounds fun! 
---
That issue seems to be pretty repeatable. What totally baffled me is on one server, my PA torso would unequip itself everytime I fast traveled / had a loading screen /possibly reentering PA. Im guessing it had something to do with my regular armor underneath, but it was only my torso that would unequip. leaving the server was the only thing that would fix it.
---
I've seen alot on these builds where you can do like 1000x the damage if your below a certain health with all the cards stacked
---
There is no limit timer but the other items that are on sale only lasts a day, so maybe a day, or more than that.
---
&gt;Most players miss the dramatic reveal of the Queen spawning out of her hole.
---
What dramatic reveal? She just flies in place half underground and half over ground. She's not climbing out of the fissure like other scorchbeasts normally do.
---
Also, she should probably do that and have a dramatic reveal
---
the jacket is dope i have it
---
It's not just me, I had to jump five servers last night before I found one without someone else's camp here. Haha. 
---
I've helped create a monster lmao.
---
Preach.  
---
Well, they just released a roadmap of new content and features going from March through the end of the year, so there's that
---
I wouldn't consider capturing a workshop anything substantial because it goes away if you leave the lobby which is fairly common due to disconnection and what am I starving for materials for? I've made my base and have the best gear possible and that's it. Doing all the quests with my friends was how we got to level 100 in the first place so that was the first thing finished. We have fired off plenty of nukes between my 3 other friends and have done that many times to farm enemies just for shits and giggles and even that provides nothing. Sitting in your base and playing with your dick until someone tries to take a workshop isn't content and neither is the terribly forced PVP that absolutely nobody wanted or wants to engage in. I hate when people pick something minuscule about a game and call it content. Like yeah I can sail around Sea of Thieves for hours and do nothing but the same boring missions and someone will go "Oh yeah but did you do this boring mission!?" For what? You're not being rewarded for anything that will help you once you've beaten the quests. So when I get the legendary weapon I wanted, what do I use it on? Already did all the quests and maxed out my level the best way possible and got most of the achievements. Whatever you're doing beyond the quests is purely to waste your own time because you have nothing else to apply any effort toward that would make an impact on your game. Hey if you wanna waste all your free time then that's fine with me but I prefer to play games where there is something actually to do and I don't have to lie to myself to justify the purchase. 
---
Marriage. Children. 
---
No. No. No. You think duping was bad? Try finding people that have insane amounts of 2 shot mods selling them for cheap. While you grinded to make 3 and cant get a cap for it. It is a good idea but honestly not a issue at this point. You dont even have the vendor yet.
---
YES YOU HAVE! :)
---
Don't worry, it'll only last me a few days, I'll be back next week for more. Thank you again!!
---
This is pretty much what I myself do on Xbox. I sell Power Armor and every cap I get from sales goes directly back into buying mod plans! 
---
#teampoopsock
---
Not unless you find one from someone else. I accidentally scrapped mine.
---
After my post blew up last weekend, it's great to see something similar on PS4 to help the people that can't see me on Xbox! Keep up the great work!
---
Could have cut out the middleman and bought some of my surplus .45 hah!
---
Everytime I level up its the hardest decision of that day I have to make, unless I'm dead set on maxing out one set of cards on that day
---
those aren't workbenches, those are death traps. That tinkerer's workbench is a grave for unsuspecting souls
---
Dont pull pvp from normal servers. Its a bad idea. 
---
Just leave adventure as is. Add survival. Then add private servers later. 
---
I dont see how anyone could claim that there isnt enough tools to avoid pvp right now in adventure mode.  Server hop. Block. Slap system. Bounty system. 4 layers of protection against friendly pvp. 
---
U really need another layer of protection against losing some wood n junk and 100 caps??? 
---
I still havent had to take on a team yet, unless I accidentally hit one member of a team and they all just melt me. 1v1 I've never had a problem with anyone
---
I noticed you said “pumps are too slow” so I figured I’d spread the knowledge. If you drink from a pump and then spam the “collect” button you get a ton of water, usually like 10 per go. 
---
Nah, I haven't done them all. Some of them don't work haha. But, yeah I usually do the dailies each day, except the level up(I only have one character and usually play for about an hour) and the weeklies as well. 
---
What counts for Clutist? cloth or hat?
---
welcome to the wasteland..this is actually one of the best games i ever played..only one other game ive played more than this..i am approaching 400 hours..if u enjoy grinding..this game is for you..there is also a ton of content..but i dont want to spoil anything for u :)
---
same. Even if you miss 2 minutes of the fight, you're fine 95% of the time
---
No need for ironclad, that's a waste of points as you'll hit dimishing returns on armor quickly. Sink 2 points into chem resistant, throw on bio mesh mod and use chems all the time.
---
More points into charisma. Run party boy when solo for up to 6 more str. During SBQ, you can run tenderizer or if getting aggro, suppessor.
---
Consider running a low health build. This opens up significant possibilities for more damage and more risk. It will force you to play better instead of just wading into every battle without a thought. 
---
They did get that right with this game where dying has no consequence except you lose your junk
---
Wait. There is no rush to finish the main quest line. At lvl 16 you should still be on the left side of the map.
---
Wind chimes and Mr. Handys are reliable sources. 
---
More purifiers don’t actually make it produce faster.  Just allows you to store more between collections.  Camps have a maximum water/hour limit.
---
Believe the same is true for farm plants.  
---
I agree but have you seen how many posts there are out there of people complaining about it? 
---
Joining
---
Mules are exactly what seems to get people banned. Picking up stuff since the BETA, nothing legendary or "duplicated" just a ton of junk, ammo, plans and all I put onto the character. The "mule" on the totally different account got banned, no reason sent yet to that email and no response to the ticket as of yet. 
---
That's great to hear. It will make scrapping weapons without fear of scrapping your main loadout so much easier.
---
Odd, I have yet to find the "2 shot anything" plan. Maybe I'm missing something?
---
Also, I don't particularly think 2 shot was the downfall of TSE
---
Adrenal Reaction doesn't proc until you're below 20% anyway. Sure you can one shot almost anything, but you'll die if you sneeze too hard, so I think it's a far trade off.
---
yeah cans are your friends
---
At that level, head to Flatwoods and go in the Agg Center.  Bonus if fertile soil event is up.
---
Robots drop it.  And cans all over.  
---
It says, 6 Days left
---
What's the counter to someone popping a stealth boy to evade all the turret AI and chucking 6 orbital strike beacons? You're asking for a hub that trolls would enjoy targeting. 
---
Any can?
---
Awesome! Thank you so much
---
No, I understand that, it's just... do you actually get anything for doing that? It seems like you're just making other people miserable for no reason other than the sake of doing it
---
Dammit, hooked again. How much do you have and how much can I give you? :)
---
Awesome :)) thank you
---
Hey I'm enjoying both anthem and fallout 76. I have something to look forward to in the future according to their respective roadmaps.
---
Whether their content will be worthwhile remains to be seen. 
---
I am level 125, and I am just starting to hit my stride. Now it's all about making caps and fine tuning my build.
---
tin cans, regular cans, and aluminum cans..theres one that has no aluminum..not sure which..if you are level 13..im sure u may have visited summersville..if u clear out all the super mutants (beyond easy) theres a whole in the back of one of the buildings with a bunch of cans..aluminum along with ballistic fiber is the only things i have trouble getting lol..but as the other guy mentioned..robots are a reliable source also
---
I figured.  
---
Pickets Fort. With all those wood piles in tight groups. With Wood Chuck equipped I leave the fort with 450-550 wood.
---
Dammit auto correct. Clothes or hat. I’m using Ritual Mask so far got 1. 
---
TBH I think the content and bugs are only half of the problem. Today, people in general seem to be looking for something to be pissed about. This game has loads of potential, and plenty to do if you're not trying to speed run it. I've been playing since mid December, rerolled once because I really didn't know what I was doing the first time around. I'm currently sitting at LV 29 and having a great time. I'm not gonna say Fallout 76 is my favorite game of this generation "that's Skyrim and I don't care if it's technically last generation SKYRIM FOREVER!!!!" but is up there. All the road map did for me is assure me that I have things to look forward to. 
---
I literally just today started up a new secondary character with the idea to collect a bunch of power armor, mods, ect, and make a dealership
---
Any tips for an up and coming buisnessman?
---
Most builds are complete at level 70 or 80 at most, assuming you optimize your perk choices while leveling. Getting a good weapon though... that's insanely hard. I'm level 235 on one toon and 120 on another and I still have only found one good weapon in all my farming.
---
It does? What fountain?
---
This... would be amazing!!!   The mod system is so complex, I don’t even know what I should be hunting for!  
---
Yeah, that’s me, 100% a “glass cannon”
---
Adrenal reaction stacks with anything.  Berserker weapons included.  Why should bloodied be the only thing that it doesn't stack with?
---
It's in the gazebo just past the tennis courts between the golf club and main building.
---
Is there an in-game list of all the mods for handmades, or did you find the list somewhere else? Interested to see how many I have!
---
The only law enforcement in the wasteland are the watoga protectrons, and well, look how that turned out. :)
---
i have the gunsmiths perks maxed.. i can craft something good if you are ps4
---
Yeah but if you wear Unyielding armor you get 15 points towards every S.P.E.C.I.A.L which already gives you a massive gain on top of the bloodied.
---
Obviously everyone knows that a TSE style nerf is on the table for bloodied. I feel like instead of another massive Nerf Bethesda should leave bloodied as it is and only make it to where it doesn't stack with adrenal reaction. Do you really need to do 10k DMG with your deathclaw?....or is 6k damage enough?......maybe risk dying every once in a while.
---
I was playing with an explosive double barrel berserker last night and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. No dense armor to protect me. I'm no fan of Nerfs but bloodied + adrenal reaction is insanely OP.
---
this
---
That would be great!Thanks!
---
FWIW, 2 shot or bloodied gatling gun with the "speedy" receiver on it is an amazing weapon that only costs 2K or so caps - pretty widely available. And the munitions factory produces lots of 5mm, and of course you can craft 5-10K of it in a go pretty easy if you know how to farm lead and steel.
---
Well, I reckon that’s just a hazard of life in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, isn’t it? 
---
Millions of people play this game. 
---
3000 active reddit users on this sub. 
---
This sub gangs up on pvpers. Calls them griefers. 
---
I wouldnt worry about it. Bethesda isnt stupid enough to implement pvp changes suggested by the most toxic pve community around. 
---
Such a small segment of players represented here. No one is stupid enough to take pvp suggestions from this forum.
---
Is it a “fountain of youth” type thing, or a bug?
---
I’ll have to check that out...thanks!
---
Hell yes!!
---
Well I do like to hear people cry. 
---
I've got 3k and I was looking to sell it off at 2 caps per round. Seems to be around the going rate price according to a few searches on the market reddit.
---
Have an upvote
---
Yeah but that’s exactly what he needs right now, no more fucking around just a straight answer to find out if he’s going to play 76 again or switch to warframe.
---
Water production doesn't stack so 1 of each is type is best or something like that (the others will just act as storage)
---
According to your numbers, the unbalance comes from unyielding armor and not the bloodied legendary effect. Berserkers benefit from radicool and a high strength in general. As well as adrenal reaction. 
---
I've been playing a bloodied melee since the beginning and adrenal reaction combined with bloodied isn't the issue. I have never kicked so much ass as when I am wearing a full set of unyielding armor.
---
Most people will be shocked and outraged when unyielding gets nerfed. But it's coming. 
---
Omg that works. Thanks. 
---
I've been running bloodied without adrenal reaction all week.
---
I'm an actual glass cannon and die a lot......I never died before the patch when I had adrenal. Right now bloodied is more on par with bersrker.
---
I farm stealth boys by server hoping vendors. It's actually pretty easy, so you should stop your witch hunt bullshit already
---
Take your Stims over to a Chem Station and dilute them with Purified Water. Then set that on the Hot Wheel so you can hit it around half health. You'll start to learn about the sweet spot to use them and keep from wasting a full Stim when you didn't need too.
---
Good thing they're separating us with survival mode. I'm pretty sure people complain because they can't avoid PVP even if they wanted to, atleast that's the way I look at it. I used to like PVP but too many broken mechanic situations had me with pacifist permanently on.
---
You have along time to play before you reach the level people are complaining about, take your time and enjoy the game for what it is! Not for what other people think it should be. 
---
You should get secret agent so you don't have to burn up so many stealth boys. That can't be cheap to do
---
Guilds or clans taking over huge areas, and acting as a faction essentially, with vendors and stuff would be awesome. 
---
Because you can't wear armor with berserker....... unyielding armor.
---
And every other legendary effect sucks without adrenal reaction.
---
Yeah, no info as of yet. It's slated for release end of march according to the roadmap so I'm assuming we should get info sometime in the next month from an ITV
---
Live WVPD
---
Where is all of this impotent rage coming from? Is this your outlet to hurt others and get away with it?
---
Yeah, I hear you, but once I got rid of adrenal and re-mutated with it, it’s fixed itself
---
Why not let it show the general event timer in a small number beneath the icon on the map and when you hover over it it gives you the current objectives, their status and maybe how many players are currently at it?
---
kinda like here [https://imgur.com/a/yLbKFjm](https://imgur.com/a/yLbKFjm) 
---
Cool! Thanks for the clarification. I've just been wearing what I'm finding because it's all better than what I can craft. Something to look forward to.
---
She flies out all covered in some "wild green" effect that soon disappears like it does on all 3 star legendaries. 
---
Any mountain cliff overlooking a large area. Mothman really likes mountains and gazing at the horizons from cliffs, they allow it to stalk its prey much easier. Show your respect by following that example and making a place of worship that imposes its presence in a similar way.
---
Let me come back to you. 2 caps per round is making my bank balance nervous :P
---
Agreed. 
---
I'm about halfway through a The Complete Works of HP Lovecraft and he's really never wholly described anything. 
---
He'll give fantastic descriptions of worldly things (entire cities, dream worlds, cave monkey monsters), bit leave the other worldly stuff pretty vague. He mostly just describes how indescribable they are, using his complete aversion to descriptions as a means of description itself. 
---
So, yes, let the sleeping monster lie. Because, hey, as the Mad Arab said: *what is dead may never die, and with strange aeons even death may die*
---
That's kind've my attitude towards it. Still, many in this sub seem to think people destroying CAMPs aren't an intended game mechanic
---
Its partly mutations (Scaly Skin, Grounded), partly perks (Barbarian, Evasive, haven't added any Ironclad to it yet) and I think 2 of the 5 pieces are Vanguard.  The only problem is radiation, and mainly because I was trying to use him for SBQ fights outside the nuke zone and the queen does have a radiation field around her as well.  Looks like I'll have to stack on some Radshield/Rad-X Diluted for SBQ fights outside the nuke area.
---
Don't discount specific resists depending on what you're facing - Zealots, Troubleshooters, Mutant Slayers, Assassin...  I wouldn't bother so much with Ghoul Slayers or Hunters though.
---
Others are correct. Having one Industrial purifier nets you the same 60 water per hour rate as having multiple. However, the purifiers only store 5 water so additional give you a larger storage to actually take advantage of the 60/hour rate without having to stand by the machine and harvest water every 5 min.
---
So what?  Nocturnal weapons are only good at night.  Should those weapons be buffed during the day so people who insist on using them are dead equal with you getting to run around doing full damage with your berserker weapons at all hours of the day?
---
If you know how the game mechanics work, and you knowingly choose to play as a berserker, I'm not sure that you get to retroactively bitch that something else performs better.  
---
I have all mutations and run with a 4 man group with mutations, makes me pretty op but when I'm alone I usually crap the bed. 
---
Maybe when you trade an item, there should be an option that you check off on the items you are handing to the person you’re giving the caps, you earned, to repair/mod your weapons or armor pieces. So it would basically be a box you could check off so that if they try and steal your items you would get them back. Say you give someone a really nice chest armor that needs repairing, so you find a new friend and play for a bit then ask them if they can repair your armor. They agree to help you so you trade them the weapon and they say that once they’re done repairing it for you that they would trade it back for an agreed price back from them, but they decide to fast travel away or log off. Now that nice armor piece you worked forever to get is gone. If you could mark it some way so that it will ensure that you get it back once they’re finished, none of that would happen. So that they can’t fast travel away, can’t log off, sell it, scrap it or take it away from you in any way when you mark it to be returned to you. Or have it so that if they do log off or fast travel away that the item you marked will be returned to your inventory. I don’t know if it makes any sense I’m just having ideas because I do hate it when my items are stolen, I’m not a dev, so I’d have no way to actually make it real, all I can really do is make my point as best as I can and hope for the best. 
---
Things are better now as far as stability goes. Even a month ago getting booted off the game once every forty minutes or so was common. 
---
But the biggest bummer is the sheer lack of things to do. You follow a path set out by terminals and recordings and that's really it. There's just fuck all to do other than that. It gets really old really fast. 
---
If you haven't seen Many A True Nerd's video yet, you should, because [he has great ideas for towns](https://youtu.be/W31mxU9s6MI?t=7291). 
---
I'm also a glass cannon without armour.
---
Upgraded to SSD as soon as i got my ps4 pro. Totally worth it if you play a lot. For large content games like FO76 the loading time is halved and pop-in is faster. 
---
Trust me I was pissed after I lost adrenal......but in hindsight bloodied is still stronger than any other legendary effect without it.
---
Bloodied is more balanced with the other legendaries without adrenal.
---
I know that I going to be an unpopular opinion but it's the truth.
---
The Charlestown, Watoga and Grantham stations are still tiny though.
---
Haha...sry, but welcome to Appalachia! ive been there. :/
---
Sounds just like my 1st Nuke, it was a total comedy of errors lol, I used plasma mines and nuka mines to try and kill the sentry bot and assaultrons when I ran out of ammo, way more robots than I was expecting and much longer process than anticipated too, anyway I died 3 times blowing myself up with the explosives cause as I tried to back away from the explosives I’d thrown I was tripping over the dead bodies of the other protections and gutsey’s I’d killed. Finally launched my nuke and thought phew at leat that’s over and tried to fast travel to the nuke zone but I never got there because I was kicked back to the dashboard, it was Alpha silo too lol, anyway I just chalked it up as a practice run 😂😂😂
---
Yeah it’s true, don’t get me wrong, I love adrenal, but yes it’s op with bloodied!
---
Game is definitily fun, and you can pour 50+ hours in it easily. Enjoy the ride, try to explore every little corner of the map, there's a lot of detail and great easter eggs you can find.
---
I can't remember the exact name, something with sulphur. It's a small drinking fountain on the inside wall of the gazebo.
---
Running berserker sure makes me wish I had those 15 extra points in strength for carry weight. Some deep pockets and dense protection would be nice also.... LOL.
---
If it's just that, then that's pretty crazy. 
---
Soooo...don’t you need to meet the skill requisite to install a mod? I’ve run into that problem frequently. Maybe it’s been patched, but that has been an issue for me with a lot of mods I get from events or that find in the wasteland.
---
I'm taking smaller than 12x12 inside. Watoga makes my local train station look big, and none of them have a bathroom like the in games ones do. If they do they are for the ticket sales guy only.
---
This was me and my team, I mean the opportunity was there, your sign virtually said ''hey come sell me plastic then take it back'' lol you got raided by the Poop Raiders buddy 🤣
---
So, the result of your experiment is that 90% of FO76 players hate roleplaying and PvP so much that they curse and quit the server when they interact with you. And your advice to Bethesda, based on this, is that they should double down on PvP and antagonistic roleplaying. I don't find your arguments very compelling. Personally, I vastly prefer cooperation over conflict (this is a common human attitude), and I would like to build team C.A.M.P.s and have vault raids and other more PvE stuff added.
---
Roleplaying is a cool but rare interest. Very few people in the real world are LARPers or Renaissance festival workers. The same goes for how people play online. Live roleplaying is just not a common interest. That's a big reason why it was a huge mistake for Bethesda to cut NPCs from this Fallout game. People don't feel stupid or put off when interacting with an NPC who is acting in character. NPCs increase immersion and draw us safely and non-judgmentally into the story world. When interacting with a real person, suddenly, you have to figure out their expectations and try to meet them...or accept being viewed as a wierdo/loser by them.
---
Just look at your post. You express a lot of scorn for this whole subreddit and any players who is alarmed by your highly unusual behavior towards them. That judgement was being thrown both ways, by you to them and by them to you. All because of the stupid, stupid absence of NPCs.
---
Hah, I understand. I may cut you a deal since I feel you're going to be a repeat ~~offender~~ customer. 
---
I used to enjoy shooting them down but now because of the poor loot they carry, I seldom do that any more unless absolutely necessary (such as collecting flux in nuked zones)
---
[u/jchamlin's](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ag37qe/fallout_76_all_plans_recipes_weapons_weapon_mods/?utm_source=reddit-android) is probably the most comprehensive.
---
[u/lnodiv](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a52bwy/fallout_76_plan_checklist_every_plan_in_the_game/?utm_source=reddit-android) made a decent one as well, though not complete.
---
Not recently. When I was below lvl 80 I did all the time that's how I met my group, but from 80-140 most people we've encountered since PVP and aren't the kindest players.
---
Top of the world. 
---
Loot the skii poles lying on racks and stuff. 
---
There around 80 aluminim at that location.
---
You mean the perk level?  Like Armorer 3* or whatever?  Or do you mean being a high enough character level?
---
Yes sir thank you 
---
Come on man......
---
Do you really think doing 10k damage with your deathclaw is not OP? Are you honestly on the edge of your seat playing your bloodied build living in fear of death?
---
Tin pitchers in kitchens are made of aluminium, cake pans are too, aluminium cans, surgical trays and I think the red rocket ship toy might have it
---
That would explain why after doubling the purifiers (because the game glitched 3 more into my inventory) I never saw a difference. 
---
Exactly all it takes is one to sour anything.
---
Watched 90 min of this thinking the whole time, "if only they could do all this in the game. I'd start playing it again as soon as they do."
---
Instead, I don't think they would rework the whole game. He pinpointed what's wrong with it, and now I have to accept the fact that it'll never be fixed.
---
Oxhorn rules!
---
My take is that... thing, at the bottom of the Lucky hole mine is (I forget his name) after "unlocking" the Interloper's power.
---
It warped him.  He "succeeded" where everyone else before him failed.  The belief in the Mothman cult is just a beginners introduction into what lays beyond. 
---
Mothmen are the Interlopers minions to this material plane?
---
Bwahahahaha...
---
Seconded.  Take your time explore the forest and top area until level 20 and the ash heap till 30 before going east.  Yes you can do it at any level but it can be frustrating.  Enjoy the game there’s no rush to complete the main quest or reach level 50.  The early levels are the most enjoyable. 
---
You shoot down cargobots?
---
I’m doing that quest where I gotta attach something and follow it back
---
I just avoid all players now and stay on pacifist. Don't need anyone outside of my team anyways.
---
I’m not exactly in the position to give business advice but all I can say is that don’t be a businessman, be friends with people. Tend to their problems, not caps, and you’ll find a lot of trading partners that way. Don’t turn down people, try to find deals that works for both parties. That’s the magic of this game.
---
&gt; offender
---
Dammit, stop setting the hook so deep!
---
Adrenal Reaction still works, if you remove the mutation and add it back it will stay. Even if you log out and back in, the damage will be there. The status-effect display will still be bugged but damage is what it used to be.
---
What sniper rifle do you sport? I’m a little bored with heavy and shotgun builds now and am thinking about a sneak sniper build. But the best sniper rifle i have is a suppressed Gauss, is it too slow for a sneak sniper build? 
---
What platform?
---
Awesome, thanks for clearing that up!
---
Thought they announced it was going to be in a hotfix this month on the 29th?
---
Side note: people (and Bethesda) are aware that the anti armor perk only reduces ballistic resistance only right? 
---
So anti armor on a laser is worthless and only half as good on a plasma gun.
---
Just checking in case nobody here knew...
---
I mean, there's already a weapon and armor bench at the unmarked barn (the one where you exit glassed cavern) about 5 seconds west of the drop site bunker, which is where most people stage for the queen fight anyway. 
---
What would be nice though, would be a bench and stash box at the exit of the silo, so you can scrap and stash all the junk you pick up going through it, then just fast travel to the drop site, then fix your weapons and armor.
---
So it would be best to just have one of each kind of purifier than have a bunch of them? At my old camp I had 4 industrial purifiers and was getting 5 from each very often. I moved camps and now they don’t produce anything
---
At my old camp I had 4 industrial purifiers and was getting 5 from each very often. I moved camps and now they don’t produce anything
---
Thanks thats great help.  Ill search for one now!
---
I just saw your post from your profile. That is awesome! Wish we were on the same platform so that I could visit you/welcome you on my Campenstein. Thank you for your kind words! 
---
Yeah it’s not the best idea lmao just cause you have to drink the dirty water first but good for this challenge i guess 
---
I don't give a shit if it's overpowered or not.  Im against this snowflakey attitude that every weapon and every combination should be equal so everyone can perform in exactly the same way.  
---
People are going to cry their way into there being no point of any legendary class at all.  You assume that just because you've gamed the system and assembled a five piece set of unyielding armor to accompany your build that everyone else must be doing the exact same thing.  I mean, good for you, but what shit do you give if Johnny on the Block is knocking down super mutants with one swipe of a claw or two?
---
It was a drop and I’ve picked it up in lockers as drops and sold it to vendors.
---
Please, please, please. I chose my flair as the least objectionable human-centric group available, but I'd much rather be seen as part of the slacker schlubs whose offspring would form the "settler" class in future fallout games.
---
I am a dick. But it comes out mostly when I see people crying on Reddit :P ...well off to blow up someone's camp.  JK, I'm at work.  Maybe later xD depends on how salty everyone is when I get home :)
---
how fun is it again playing the same 6 event quests over and over again? run here. activate computer. kill waves of enemies. done. go here. repair reactor. kill enemies done. go here kill more enemies done. wow so much stimulating action! i almost creamed my pants from the gut wrenching fun. 
---
If it means anything, I'm more than happy to deter the griefers for you. 
---
Which is your favourite? 
---
Hey!
---
We're not schlubs, we're just...
---
...kinda chilled, man ;)
---
The perk level. It displays a lock symbol by the perk level and it makes the mod sound when I try to install it, but doesn’t apply the mod or remove it from my inventory. Possibly Relevant: I play on XB1.
---
That is a good point. I found an outstanding melee weapon.
---
Those fusion cores are heavy. Don’t forget ‘Battery included’ perk to make them lighter. At one time I farmed more than 60 of them but dropped most of them near WS vendor bot lol. 
---
LOL......you mad?
---
Just you wait til you look at my medical supplies on the market... Soon, soon I shall have all of your caps. :)
---
you stfu about my princess bed. It ties the room together
---
A mixed bag of huge support and hate have come  from every standpoint - newcomers to Fallout veterans. Aside from obvious bugs expected from a Bethesda game, the world is as gorgeous as you would expect from a Bethesda game. The aesthetic - even I would say story - is beautifully thought out and not terribly executed.
---
Most of the hate honestly has come not even from the game itself, but how Bethesda addresses extra content and physical collectibles (like the [$200 misrepresented bag](https://kotaku.com/200-fallout-76-edition-promised-fancy-bag-delivers-ny-1830724582/amp) or [$80 plastic rum bottle that was advertised as glass](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2018/12/31/fallout-76-fans-have-every-right-to-be-upset-over-80-plastic-nuka-rum-bottles/amp/)). It’s almost comical how much consistency occurred from inconsistency.
---
I think players should create their own T.O.W.N, with it's own name. NPC Settlers could move in if we ever get NPCs in the Wastelanders update. They can build their own houses/commercial residences on plots you place (similar to Sim Settlements). Same thing if your friends decide to move in too. You can set taxes, jobs, your own NPC advisor, etc. Similar to C.A.M.P, if you join a server with a T.O.W.N already placed in your T.O.W.N's location you have the option to jump into another server. Players could open their own businesses and such. Would be fun! 
---
Yeah, it does. Sucks if you die, respawn and eating something locks the game. Grumble grumble.
---
This is a great post. Very clear and detailed; I hope they clean up PvE.  "Just want to enjoy the Wasteland and rebuild it with others, as promised at E3." Exactly.
---
Someone trips over the plug in the Chinese attack simulation we're all living in.
---
Ya I just figured this out recently.  Couldn’t figure out why my mods weren’t taking even though I had all the materials.  It made the sound!  It should be grayed out or at least give you a message saying you don’t have the necessary skill/perk to complete that task.  I had it, I just didn’t have it equipped.  All I needed a a reminder to do so.  Instead, I went without installing that mod for like a month until someone else showed me.  
---
Yeah, I was gonna drop one in like 45ish min once I get home. PM me for GT 
---
anybody know after a quarter of health why she just completely stops taking dmg? happened twice already.
---
Of course,  one of my great disappointments in my young life was that there wasn't a serial to that film. 
---
I'm just remembering how much FPS I used to drop around goodneighbor.
---
Where could I find a chem station near the starter area? I have the plan but I’m short on Aluminium rn :/
---
Nowhere near it.  Asking for nerfs so you can feel more powerful is absurd.  That's all.
---
I actually have over 40 maps right now. I probably have more but it was 40 when I counted last, and far I've only done one map. That should be added to my list of goals. I've been saving them since the begging to do one big treasure hunter day, but I just keep pushing it back.
---
hah, nope.
---
Haven't used a stimpack, radaway or rad-x in weeks. I sell em for my 1400 cap per day run :P
---
Dat ammo tho...*temptation* (not at 2 caps per though!)
---
Platform? 
---
At least there wasn't a bug that existed for over a **decade** that let you have infinite carry capacity by simply re-equiping a deep-pocketed armor piece repeatedly. 
---
Good time to get into the game, with the roadmap for this year you'll be familiar with everything as new content is rolled out. I have been playing since beta, at about 260hrs and taking a break since I got to the point of timing myself to run silos...
---
BGS did say they plan to keep 76 online for a long time, possibly forever? They also said private servers would be a thing but word's been mum on that, but I think you're right it will grow and improve over time. Hopefully most of the players who have left will revisit in a year and see what's changed, I used to do annual FO4 playthroughs until 76.
---
PC master race. 
---
Don’t encourage them to “nerf” anything.  
---
People build tasteless and ugly houses. Add a big flat field to it and will it will look absolutely terrible.
---
To add to what the other user said, if the benches showed us what mods are possible, but not available to us. We should then be able to flag that as “wanted” which would show up in our vendor-bot as wanted.  
---
Another user could see the mod requested and then use my workbench to make it and sell it to my vendor right there. 
---
This could keep going further and when you put a wanted on an item it could notify users that have the ability to craft that and give them the location to deliver it, and now the race is on! 
---
1 cap each for you. But you'll need to say you're buying it on the market post for ahem ~~karma~~ reasons.
---
Why why why was this on my Google News Feed? Is Google drunk?
---
It could mostly be recycled assets from FO3. Sounds like it's right up FO76's alley
---
Obviously you're welcome to that opinion, and I don't disagree that there are still major issues. However, most of this subreddit wanted a roadmap and was given one. 
---
I'm not saying it fixes any of the game issues, but it at least signals better communication than what we were getting.
---
I'm not going to pile on about mules - I get it - Bethesda did this to everyone because of this insane low stash limits and a system so terribly flawed that basic materials take up room in your stash.  I'm so past done defending them - the game has tons of flaws and some of them like shitty server performance is just inexcusable.  C'mon, what are they running servers on - 8088s?
---
Have to say I've gotten lucky so far with mostly avoiding PvP - the only time I'm exposed is when I'm taking over a workshop which I only ever do on my alts these days just for atoms, and I usually lose them in short order.  Luckily the camps have been left alone so far.
---
I've blocked a lot of Wanted players in the past so maybe that helps tremendously.  Not for the 5 caps guys, but anyone with 50+ caps Wanted is on my block list.  Suggest you do the same - its been pretty peaceful overall for me, although maybe camp location has something to do with it as well.
---
Ha, say you were the lower lvl guy looking for a friend.  LOL  My son is on a lot too and he may think you were someone I was trying to trade with.
---
I feel your pain bro. My original build was using a quad explosive radium rifle and I felt the same as you when everyone called for the TSE nerf. 
---
Bethesda set out to balance the game and I can assure you that bloodied will be getting a hardcore nerf in the near future. What I'm proposing is a soft core solution.
---
Psn is nalgachuey
---
I don’t understand why there has to be some hidden message in posts. Like do people lie so often on here for you to assume I’m not saying something? Your “feeling” is wrong. I said exactly what happened. It’s was barb wired and it was a cane. I’m level 48 and don’t have great weapons. Yes I was on pacifist and I know I was cause I’ve never taken myself off it. My boyfriend died with one hit from a boxing glove and he’s level 52 and the person who killed him was mid 100s. I don’t even know what 5% hit points mean. I don’t do ANYTHING to make myself wanted. 
---
I’m the most basic gamer in fallout. I play events, lend a hand, scrap a lot. I don’t have great armor or great weapons. The highest level weapon is have is a melee weapon and it’s the war drum with 134 damage. I don’t EVER engage in combat with players, I don’t attack people’s camp, I don’t troll people. 
---
Flag aluminum in your inventory. Then every scrappable item you see in game containing alum, will show a small hourglass. You can use it to farm/find any mats.
---
Easiest way to flag them is to go into your inventory "junk" tab and select "component mode" on an item containing aluminum, then flag it. You'll find tons of it in every location you go to.
---
Oh source please? What else did they say they were hotfixing?
---
Not only trust, but when the game could crash at any time, I'm not giving anything to anybody.
---
The game is great in theory, however launch went quite badly, issues were left unpatched for weeks on end, lack of content, etc.
---
I absolutely loved the beta and stayed up to 3am even with work the following day at 9, but by the end of the beta I was already level 30. Full release felt underwhelming and many quests were broken. The stash limit was also 300 so I literally spent half my time micro-managing my inventories and scrapping weapons and armor I wanted to keep.
---
It was great to play a fallout with friends for a while, but the game released so badly with such little content, that I've been put off. Once I reached level 50 (within a couple of weeks) I got bored since there wasn't too much else to do.
---
I'll go back one day, just not today.
---
You’ll be in love with it, like many players were through the game despite the flaws. A lot of the negativity around the game is because it f*king sucked for a while- it really was tough to stay invested. 
---
Now’s a better time than ever to pick it up though. The issues are minimal, and there is planned development. I started a new character recently, and am playing it nice and slow. Exploring and farming at my camp are how I’m spending a lot of my time. 
---
Just nuked Hemlock for the violet flux. Not sure how much longer I'll be on this server. GT is UnicornQueen971 
---
Honestly they already gone down that road and at this point they need balance so that they can balance end game content.
---
How do you balance an end game boss fight when you have one build that does 10k damage while everything else does 1k?
---
....
---
OK, you hooked me, I'll take em. But please, is tomorrow evening OK? I am in Ireland, and it's 8:20pm here now. I need to get off the computer (wife-aggro). Will make a new post tomorrow (1 karma per trade) and will PM you - that OK?
---
Keep them for me!
---
(Unless you get 2 caps per, then sell them ASAP!!!)
---
Yeah pvp isnt getting removed from adventure. 
---
Server hop when u see other players. 
---
You are the one opting out  and ruining peoples fun therefor you must use the tools youbwere given to achieve the effect you want. Server hop when you see other players to no engage in pvp combat. 
---
Its simple really.
---
Speak for yourself. Me, I'll be happily tending my tato farm until those nasty supermutants halfway across the commonwealth steal my family heirloom locket and I have to beg some dude from a cryogenic chamber to go get it back for me.
---
Energy weapons break way too fast. They’re probably put on the same timer as other weapons, say 1000 rounds, but because each shot only does a little damage, you end up spitting 1000 shots in seconds and end up with a broken gun before you could scratch the queen. 
---
The worst breakage I’ve encountered after latest patch was almost three guns, one bloodied 50 cal, one bloodied gatling plasma and a bloodied explosive gatling (nearly broken), and got a stalker’s revolver for loot. 
---
A lot of his ideas are cool but would require a massive overhaul of the game which is just never going to happen. I was just trying to think of something a little easier to implement. 
---
And now it seems they've REALLY turned the tables. The roadmap is such a huge step in the right direction.
---
I have a 3 star vanguard sentinel +1 luck combat left leg but im not sure whats that worth
---
The thing is, I'm not a melee player.  I run sneak rifleman 90% of the time.  So every bloodied melee player in the game is out performing my DPS.  And it doesn't affect me in the least.  Asking for their play style and enjoyment of the game to be reduced just so I can feel more capable just seems like a weak ass thing to do.
---
I quit and started again and it was gone. Though then there was a glowing ghoul, which I killed. But then some other asshole appeared and entered the building and all the enemies I’d killed immediately respawned at much higher levels. And I died. 4 times. I hated this asylum. I have a side quest to deposit technical documents but they’ll never be fucking delivered. FUCK THAT!
---
A bug I've seen multiple times.
---
Pffft
---
He'd probably still only drop a nocturnal rolling pin.
---
Plastering a smile on your face and forbidding any criticism is no way to compel change for a better product.
---
The Fallout sub can be argued as 100% toxic toward 76. Filthy can be argued as cult-like in their praise-bubble. Through the highs and lows I think this sub does a pretty good job of making our voices heard, in both praise and critique.
---
Shit on us all you want. You're welcome for the positive changes we've compelled from Bethesda.
---
Always leave spare plans and other helpful bits at 76 when I have them 
---
Then don't be such a whiny bitch.
---
Hey, you just give me the heads up if that happens. Me and Preston are tight AF.
---
I can also drop you my fertiliser.
---
Nothing is ever going to be perfect. 
---
batteries included + power user and  when a fusion core gets low turn it into an ultracite fusion core for maximum power core efficiency.
---
The shed near prime has workbenches.
---
So they have the bags that not legitimate have some flashy neon or something? If not, that is legitimate and Bethesda are just assholes.
---
Or a god roll but lvl 25. That’s happened to me yesterday. I lost my mind
---
explosive railway rifle would be nice too (does it already exist?)
---
10 caps
---
I launched my first nuke almost on accident. I was two or three levels deep into Site Charlie before realizing I was on the nuke quest. Just me, my Grognak axe, and a ton of Healing Salves against a million robots and those laser turrets in the freaking ceiling. NOT FUN when you're melee.
---
I was only one room away from launch. But two Assaultrons caught me in a bad corner and killed me. I was about to cry from frustration when the Mysterious Savior, whom I have literally never seen before, got me back up.
---
Nuked Whitesprings and took a bunch of pictures in my swimsuit and sunglasses, posing on the obs tower nearby 😎
---
if you have chameleon ..if someone in pvp uses vats against u..can they see u?
---
Who started a thread bitching about a garbage weapon not performing and calling for other people's stuff to be reduced to make them feel better?
---
It definitely wasn't me.
---
I definitely like both subs.  This one has better suggestion threads - casuals has better stories, photos, and memes.
---
https://youtu.be/c9Xlaq6Yk44 This video shows a guy placing foundations using a potted plant. I personally haven't tried it, but it looks like it could be done. 
---
r/Market76
---
Did the same. I think everyone does the first time :)
---
Yeah Idk how I feel about that, I'll keep doing what I've been doing. It seems that workshops would have no point if there wasn't PVP so makes sense.
---
I'm not bitching bro......
---
I'm having a logical discussion. You're the one who started having an emotional meltdown. Don't melt snowflake.
---
naw i think they should make it free to play because that’s all it worth. especially if they’re going to make skins $20 that you can only use on certain objects. would be cool if you could buy a skin that translated to all armors or all weapons. but na. micro transaction city kid.
---
OMG glad I’m not alone 😂
---
I'll give you my 5000, you give me 15 caps.
---
Those turrets with melee are a disaster 😭
---
One quarter cap
---
I use a non-legendary 308. If I can find a legitimate two shot 308 I will use that. Sneak gets me 3.3x damage plus the other modifiers from all the rifle perks. I can kill a high level scorchbeast in about ten shots, less with an initial crit. Mirekurk queens take about 10-15 shots. 
---
Almost everything else I can one shot. Including wendigos and Deathclaws. 
---
However, the build is not OP. If I get seen...danger then my sneak modifiers fall off. Wendigos/Deathclaws take maybe three shots at that point. 
---
Some super mutants seem to have high armor ratings and can take up to three shots.
---
I carry a backup Two-Shot Level 20 Combat Rifle. It has better DPS if something is right up on me. I hope to replace it with a legitimate two shot Handmade. 
---
I don’t really need armor and I don’t really die all that much. I have died more from falling off cliffs than from mobs. 
---
I can clear Watoga, Harpers Ferry, and most other places by one shotting everything. Whitespring sucks at times. If other players are there then I can perch and just wait for them to pull mobs. I usually use the TS combat rifle because it does less damage and I can just tag instead of one shotting them. Even glowing ones are one shotted if I remain hidden. 
---
how do u do this? im on ps4
---
I think I can craft the bracers. I'll check after work to verify.
---
I didn't realize that I was talking to someone who struggles with tone and reading comprehension.  Good luck out there.  Bro.
---
Maybe you somehow unlocked coding for pet commands 
---
r/whooosh
---
Oh doh. I apologise. I just got it. Mea culpa.
---
I dunno... some of them are dangerously in Barney Fife territory.  But then again, Don Knotts *was* from West Virginia, so unintentional accuracy?
---
Are you positive? I’ve been using and AA Gatling laser, and it’s kinda been my main for awhile now. Never compared it to a regular Gatling laser.
---
If it’s just like a regular I’ll look for another until it’s fixed.
---
So, are you sure you’re sure about that?
---
Oh trust me my reading comprehension is very good. I even picked up on your subtle undertone where you tried to imply that I was a whiny bitch.
---
Let's be real here bro......you started acting like a dick.
---
Thanks for responding! I’ll go ahead and assume if this idea is implemented I get to name a town., haha...ha...heh...okay I’m done. 
---
Did you say that Another Settlement needs our help? Well, mark it on our map!
---
oh, that's terrible. 
---
RNG go hard
---
I bought this product because I love fallout. Fallout 76 came out with a trailer, I said fuck yea I’m getting it. What I knew was that you can play with others. I had NO idea it was an open sever with random people. I THOUGHT it was like a co-op option where you could invite people to play with you. When I had read what pacifist was in the menu I thought it was dumb cause why would people still be able to kill me even though I’m on pacifist mode. Not fair at all. I didn’t read the details of the game I just wanted to get it. I discovered a lot playing this game realizing that it’s nothing like the previous but I still love it. Your stupid questions are irrelevant. I read your other comments as well. No matter what game it is, YOU, I’m talking about you and people in general will ALWAYS have a complain about something with ANY game. It’s a given. It’s bound to happen. This game has its problems and that is one of them. Bethesda is slowly fixing problems. This game isn’t even close to a year old so they are learning as they go as well. 
---
If you dont like it dont do it game not forcing you to do them you want advice then dont use fast travel you will see so diffrent and funny things loot junks try to find mods look how they make world detailed 
---
I'd support this if they added a cosmetic helmet slot
---
Is it clean?
---
Definately an xp/effort issue, but I'm always worried discussion will result in it being nerfed rather than other issues being balanced/buffed. I DO like WT, but it's an effort I dont always have time for, and admittedly sometimes I just dont feel it. Loot/effort however WT is much better if RNJesus favors you.
---
That is a piece I'm definitely interested in but I'll have to check what my current left leg is to see if I'd want to swap it out. I have one leg that negates fall damage so I have to keep that one on. It's still gonna be a few hours before I can check so I'll let you know later.
---
Right? Was dissapointed when I found mine.
---
Spin up an Alt, you can probably make it that far in the quest chain within a few hours.  Then have a friend help you transfer it between characters.
---
Alternatively, you can try to buy one from another play using /market76
---
Alternate 2, the Toy vendor in White Springs will randomly sell a Fireman's Helmet.  While its the same model, it is a slightly different color.  Also, I'm not certain if the Toy version provides protection against poison gas.
---
I can only find european cd keys, any good site you recommend?
---
Yawp. Lvl 25 Quad explosive handmade with +1 perception. Gave it away to some random noob 5 minutes after I found it lol
---
That’s really impressive 👍 I forgot sneak gives you good damage multiplying effects. With heavy or shotgun it’s great for crowd control, but if you can stay hidden and quietly pick them out one by one on your own pace, you probably hardly ever need a stimpak lol. 
---
Frick me! I'm in the same boat - been trying to find calibrated shocks mods now for more than 2 weeks. Hell, I don't have jet pack yet. I'm running medic mod for now.
---
Ok well you didn’t mention they were griefing in groups that’s definitely different. But honestly if you’re going after someone with a bounty you can’t be complaining about gettin griefed it’s just part of the game. 
---
If a group of 4 takes over your workshop and kills you that’s different, but then don’t seek revenge. Honestly not sure how the group dynamic plays a huge role but just don’t go after bounties if you’re not prepared to pvp. Most people know by now that’s a common tactic. 
---
Cmon man, let's be serious here....
---
....do you think it's time to retake the Castle?
---
Marsupial please, my PSN in c_bman08. 
---
And time travel apparently, since jet has been invented yet acccording to lore.
---
They dont dissapear u can drop bags or store in containers they will last until server resets i think if not they stay.
---
It just depends on personalities and play styles. When I see a lower level at Whitesprings, I'll train a bunch of ghouls to them and keep aggro while they tag them. I had a lot of help leveling so I don't mind helping out other people. But you might run into a really cranky guy who will kill you for being there.
---
Certainly, don't go to the Scorched Queen unless you can both keep yourself alive and contribute to the fight (or have someone who explicitly agrees to carry you). But any other nuke zone, go for it.
---
Great to know, thanks.  I have been hanging onto fusion cells.
---
Ahh you must be new to Bethesda
---
What do you think? Can we have this please mods? :)

Unfortunately cdkeys is the only key site I trust. Sucks that they only have EU codes. You can check allkeyshop but I'm pretty sure they also have only EU keys so it won't help. G2A is another possibility if they have a sale. Best of luck finding a good deal mate.
---
Do you grind for lead or lead ore?
---
Considering levels equals cap rewards, you are a juicy target. You should be taking every precaution possible. 
---
If reactive plates and electrically charged can force you into PVP or wanted status, dump them. It sucks because, as you say, it helps you micromanage enemies less.
---
I have yet to have someone grief my base. I have found people griefing others and I got to say, they straighten out pretty quickly after you kill them a couple times. I hate to say it, but offense is the best defense. I've even successfully stopped 1k bounty sentinel assassin's armor baiters by knowing how to kill them.
---
If you won't defend yourself, why should they stop? It's like being bullied on the playground. A swift kick to the nuts will make them think twice about antagonizing you in the future.
---
I wont argue that the implementation regarding pvp feels superficial. I just don't understand how they improve the game if you just go there, build extractors, then never come back. Give me extra resources gathering options at my own CAMP if workshops are never going to be interesting enough to actually visit anymore.
---
Alcohol bias is forever present. We have cigarette packs in game and can't smoke them.  My question is where's our 1950's nuclear steam punk vape pens?
---
I have every recipe in the game now, and I am on 2/76 for collecting recipes. I am not sure how to fix this :)
---
I know that I’m on pacifist mode because I’ve never taken myself off it. He was hitting me with a fucking barb wired  cane. I didn’t do shit to flag myself. It clearly happened to me. So it’s possible. How about you be better and not open your little mouth about shit you THINK you know when you clearly don’t. 
---
You know too much.
---
Platform?
---
On XB, so my buttons will be different.
---
Enter you inventory junk tab, find an item with "aluminum" listed as one of it's components. You'll have to check for the key used (RS I think on XB), but it should give you the option to change to "component view". Select that, then move the cursor over to the material you want to flag, you'll be given another option to flag it. It stays flagged until you go back in and remove it.
---
Sounds more complicated than it is.
---
We could do a direct assault into the courtyard.
---
You've lost me.  What crimes, what are you talking about?
---
It’s not, I feel like there should be some damage mitigation if they’re in a group of 4 and you’re solo cause that’s not really fair. I think the OP was just pointing out that if the person keeps seeking revenge and they don’t have the caps to cover their death, then they’re not really getting punished just being an annoyance.
---
I pointed out that if you don’t have the caps to cover your death you get a debuff of 50% damage for 3 hours. This makes it really easy to one shot most players so it’s not really that annoying but it could be if they did it 30 times in a row. But then OP started talking about how people grief in groups which is a totally different topic so I’m not really sure what his point is atm. 
---
What is the best mod for a sledgehammer?
---
Also does sneak work consistently in this game? A few times even when I’m chameleon and stayed absolutely still, super mutants and charred ghouls still charged toward me from 100 yards away and started attacking when they got closer. It’s as if I was the only one who can’t see myself lol. 
---
Thanks for being a great example of the kind of person so many people join that sub to avoid dealing with on a regular basis.
---
Not the same thing.
---
:|
---
Ran into a group killed the bounty got no caps. Then his buddies attacked us we killed them they kept seeking revenge eventually we just had to pop stealth boys disengage and block them. People doing this in groups is a way for them to sercumvent the pvp debuff.  Telling people not to go after bounties is stupid.  It isn't the pvp aspect it's the fact that people are cheating the system. They arent lossing caps because they already have none and there team members can freely attack anyone who goes after the member with a bounty.  Bounties as a whole are generally pointless and i have only gone after them if they are within walking distance because 90% fast travelling to them cost more then you will get.
---
Thank you SO much for this feedback! Especially the addiction wipe upon disconnection part, that’s clutch. 
---
I am curious though, in accordance to the 700+ Junkie Dragon damage, is he fully ranked in rifle perk cards to reach that damage or does he still have rifle +damage perks he could invest in?
---
Seriously... It isn't the 50s without chain smoking wise guys and gangsters. 
---
I'll confirm this, water and crops produce at a camp and fill in order based on how they were placed one at a time. Man one time i took over Berkley Springs West though and put down ten of those ground purifiers and they all filled up at the same time. 
---
I had 60 purified waters in like 20 minutes
---
speaking of Rose, I've been really disappointed by the quality of quest reward to difficulty of quest ratio. 
---
I typically get my ass kicked 6 different ways to Sunday running her fetch-it quests, only to earn some bullshit leather armor and stimpaks.
---
I hope the juice is worth the squeeze for the overarching quest completion.
---
I hope it's some string of text you can edit. I'd like to be able to label mine as I see fit
---
I hear you - seems like the devs prefer nerfs to actually balancing the game to risk/reward.  SBQ fights are the prime example - we're risking far too much ammo/resources/time/etc for little to no gain.  I still do them just because I like the idea of a boss fight, but its most certain not for the loot.  And given how the last patch broke the queen, I'm finally at the point I might not even bother showing up.
---
You mean articulate and objective? You're welcome. Anytime.
---
This is a very very very good suggestion. 
---
Sure thing, I'll hold onto them unless someone wants to buy at the 2 caps per price. :)
---
I'm down for fighting Lovecraftian monsters and to fight more bosses in general, but man for some reason this cracks me up. 
---
Like it's just: "Yo dude, see that Lovecraftian vine-monster-thing?"
---
"Yea."
---
"Lets nukes it"
---
Vaults should be high level raids, and a future update will have you prestige your level after every 50 lvls.
---
Lead. I have found 4 tin-can areas in the game which nobody else seems to be grinding. One is particularly good since it gives me a lot of steel as well. I can server hop these for an hour and get really nice resources, but....
---
....I'd rather be shooting muties in the face.
---
I seriously wish there was like a lvl 5 or 15 minigun. I was gonna craft/mod one and give some "lucky" newbie serious firepower and the lead to back it. Too bad they're like 35 min...
---
Cool. Thanks. Still yet more things to do!
---
Unfortunately yes. See here (https://imgur.com/a/xkXDe6i)
---
I did some testing with a regular Gatling laser and an AA one for a bug report here on Reddit a few weeks back. But no one seems to know it (or use lasers to notice) still.... SPREAD THE WORD!!!
---
  I prefer solo and am generally overencumbered, thus will slow most people down.   
---
 So my default is no.  Once in a while though...I will advise the requestor I am overencumbered and have to go slower.  
---
  Last time I did it, guy made for whitesprings.  
---
Yes, I gained some good XP, but getting tripleteamed by L50 SB ad their entourages was a PITA.  OTOH, finding my L25 self could kill a 68 diseased ghoul was an ego boost :)
---
  Have been griefed more than once, I check the requestors icon - If I'm not in combat, and the requestor is nowhere near my location, or I can't find their marker, no.
---
If I'm in the middle of (melee) combat, I dont have time to check, so its an auto-decline.
---
I've also played "mysterious stranger" - I've approached a location where there was already another player working through - I kept my distance and sniped citters...sometime calling out X number of critters were (approaching) from (direction).  
---
I rather enjoyed playing that role.
---
Watoga Vendor. Server hop maybe 2 times twice... you'll find one. 
---
I have been farming any/all forest events for the elusive "forest camo jumpsuit" for the last 40 LEVELS!  
---
Alas, my poor sniper build still has no joy. :\\  
---
you need to get the perk "Home Defense" its in agility after level 22, the more points you put into it the more that is unlocked, you will also need to get recipes from Free States vendor for the flame thrower and some other fun ones just remember   
---
C.A.M.P. plans are Red, Weapon and Armor plans are Blue, Recipies look lame, I hope this helps you.
---
Still haven't launched my first.
---
Think I'm gong to nuke Grafton, because that Mayor....
---
Remember to shave.
---
Free Internet hug for you friend!
---
I have issues too, Small ones says it produces 8 each hour, but it only stack 2 in each purifier, anyone knows why?
---
I find end game to be a hotly discussed topic in all my looter shooter games. For me at least it seems that 120-150h into a looter shooter is kind of my limit until new content drops.
---
I don't see it as a negative though since it allows me to play a few looter shooters in round robin style.
---
Probably not great for someone that only plays FO76 since the wait for new content can be off putting but for me the pace is great. I am back on my Warframe grind at the moment until I run out of content there and then the new FO76 drop should be available.
---
YES and I invite ALL of my friends and we romp the wasteland like a 12 person team. Its happened 3 times and it’s fun but I am curious as to why it’s happening.
---
I think we should come at them from both sides, like a pincer.
---
I haven't seen a single nuke since the last patch, heres hoping vending brings people back. 
---
Definitely not too crowded. Map is huge. 24 people per server. Are you building on a resource site? Or by a vendor? Certain areas are high traffic. If youre having issues getting your camp placed.... then move it? They're meant to be mobile not static. And low level turrets are fine. If they can't handle the spawns you're simply in too high level of an area. So again...just move. This isn't a game mechanic issue.
---
So what are you playing at the moment? I am just curious to find out what other Vault dwellers play in between content drops.
---
Well General if you think that'll work, we do it.
---
The problem would be less if it wasn't the daisy chain pack fights...
---
I kill the first guy, but then open myself to reprisals from the other 2 hiding in the corner, so generally it's a lose - lose, especially since they generally have like handful of caps on them I think the most I've gotten is 50'ish caps off a 200'ish player.   
---
(FYI, WhiteSprings is the worst for this, Ghouls have 1 - 3 caps on every 4th or 5th ghoul, so they never have to worry about the "zero caps" PVP issue). 
---
Players should also not be forced into ditching gear because of loopholes / exploits.
---
But that doesn't matter as the root of the issue is players shouldn't be forced to PVP, or watch my "Toys" be destroyed while in passive mode.  
---
I'll consider PVP if and when they actually resolve the multiple bugs and significant balance issues, but until then it's:  
---
-Watch my stuff get destroyed.  
---
-Kill one and then get jumped by 2 others. (Including other 300's).  
---
-Log out and accept the 50%-70% camp destruction
---
One of the perpetrators had some junk that he was wanting everyone to grab-I'm not sure if he was referring to actual items or his body. 
---
this, yeah. Watoga train sells these nearly every time I'm there.
---
Thanks, will do!
---
If you're interested in learning more, here is the very [first Easter Egg in gaming history](https://m.ranker.com/list/first-video-game-easter-egg-atari-2600-adventure/melissa-brinks).
---
Thank you so much!
---
what platform?  
---
If they target you in VATS before you crouch, it seems yes they will hold the target.    
---
Personally running around in Raider PA exclusively, and have "crafting" armor under (weightless +INT/Luck gear) so it could worth with a Stealthboy, but does nothing vs melee characters.
---
As am I. I enjoy it. But it's really weird. I want to trade with random. See what they have to offer. But I also want to keep my private lobby to my friend and I. 
---
Xbone
---
No they are annoying, useful at annoying people.
---
Btw THANK YOU for all the weeks of codes and work you did 💖
---
I didn’t say not to go after bounties smh, I said if you’re not prepared to pvp then don’t go after bounties. It’s common knowledge that people work in teams at this point. Once they attack you once, then you’re on an even playing field and both of you can do damage. You’re getting mad about going after a bounty and then getting engaged in PvP? It makes no sense. I get the caps part of it but I honestly think the Dubuff system works well, could they improve on it yes but maybe just don’t engage until then if you don’t like to pvp. Because they shouldn’t be able to kill you with that debuff unless your build sucks. 
---
The griefing part of it I agree with, they shouldn’t be able to seek revenge 30 tomes in a row hopefully that gets fixed.
---
Oh shoot, I remember Swinging on Star from the BETA. I forgot about that.
---
Totally news worthy. If the wall ever gets built, we won't have to worry about these immigrants busting through the Appalachia and opening up criminal empires.
---
(please do not associate/confuse my satire with a literal political stance)
---
JEEZ. I'd like that much steel and lead. 
---
I seem to have a 50% chance to run into a glowing giant mosquito at the bos big base, always unkillable and immune to damage.
---
There is a lesson there OP......don't follow the Sheep use your own judgement....Most of us are loving the game with the exception of people who have been banned or have been playing 24/7 since release and have no new in game to excite them. The game will continue to grow and get better...ENJOY IT
---
Lol, that is the true predator lurking in the shadows. Rngesus coming to take back what was his.
---
I really miss NPC characters, I wonder why they removed them altogether. Just seeing three BOS soldiers walking down the street was nice. 
---
Glowing Mass, Hardened Mass, High-radiation Fluids (and a few other nuked zone items) are "public" loot. Public loot is lootable by anyone (even if they didn't tag the enemy), but can only be looted by *one* person (i.e.: not instanced for each person, like most other loot).
---

thank you sir

Thanks!!!

It's just nice there's similar shops on the different consoles! I do have a PS4, and I'm trying to get a couple friends into Fallout 76. On the day I get a PS4 version installed, I'm coming to you for gear!
---
This idea is great, it sounds workable, and it plays into the theme of rebuilding Appalachia really well. I'm concerned it might not be implemented because it would require reworking the map slightly, but I don't think that would be a big deal. I would for sure snag a slot and it would make building so much fun
---
oooooooohhh!! 
---
thank you! i had no idea. that’s pretty cool

Good legacy pull there!

I am not far from a few crossroads, location chosen for the near by traffic, doesn't it defeat the purpose of trying to be a merchant if I have to hide all the time?  
---
I'd love some RollPlaying Raiders, like the "food guy", but it's only griefers.  
---
Micromanaging the map is not unreasonable, it's another hassle that seems like we should not be burdened with, but it might help..  
---
   
---
But......  
---
Almost every encounter so far they've been "neutral" on approach and only become wanted after starting to wreck the "Outpost"..
---
Thanks!!
---
So like, if you were going to sell people mods they can’t build themselves, how would that work if they need the requisite perk to use it?
---
You obviously flagged yourself for PvP, otherwise players cannot kill you. This idea that someone can kill you through slap damage is a myth; not *once* has anyone been able to provide video proof of it happening, so unless someone can pony up evidence this is actually a thing, reports of players killing non-PvP flagged players somehow are up there with Bigfoot sightings and alien abductions in terms of credibility.
---
You either opened yourself up for PvP by claiming a workshop or by becoming wanted, or you're lying. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.
---
Well i have a number of roleplay situations. I will also challenge your conclusions. 
---
Players like the friendly pulls. "Hey my kingdom is in peril we need a hero are you that hero? Come with me"
---
That gets about 65% of players to come along and do some quests for me and my buddies. The problem is our first quest leads into another and we need pvp to engage as enemies and increase the drama of the storylines we created. 
---
So i need to be able to flip to hostile via the pvp  functions so i can change costumes and become the "bad guy" in the quest. (I dumb down my dmg output based on whoevers doing my quest.. I usually let them win.. I actually lose alot of caps giving quests out)
---
Now that being said. Yes 90% of players get scared when i do the greaser bit and try to pull them into our zany world. But i am very aggressive/tunnel snakes when i do it. If we looked at pure pvp. Id say about 25% or more of each server is pvp active. Based on how frequently i can find a fun mutual fight. Ontop of that there are a number of players who havent reached the level to be pvp active qnd may be interested in it later. 
---
Id go so far as to say 35% of players or more are "chill" about pvp. They will or would partake. And even if they dont want to pvp right now and get killed its no big deal to them.
---
Yes i hate the pve community on reddit lol. Such shit talking about people like me. "Oh you must be sad in real life, only lpsers and basement dwellers pvp"
---
Thats mean. You guys are mean
---
no problem
---
Give you a cap, bitten in half and soaked in the blood of my enemies. What say you?
---
surgical trays in the AVR Medical Center in Charleston was my source for aluminium at around that level. 
---
I cannot find any even outfits!! I've only ever seen a hunters long coat a few times in game on other players and I have one myself. I had no idea the jumpsuit might be glitched in.
---
If you’re on PS4 I have a X-01 torso with jetpack mod already installed 2k
---
Some of the reason FO76 is getting a lot of criticism is due to the fact that it's kind of sitting on the shoulders of giants like FO4, FONV, Skyrim, etc. Not to say it doesn't have a bucket load of stability and gameplay issues.
---
Like I always say, it's not a bad game.
---
But it's not a good game either.
---
It's an average game, but average can easily be enjoyable.
---
I went with vanguard armor myself (max health tank build) paired with max sneak i can get decent numbers and rarely die to much of anything. 
---
Once you get a few decent legendary armors you can equal or beat out some of the PA builds without too mucb trouble.
---
With full vanguard its almost impossible to get one hit even if someone is using a super sledge in PA. Plus you get to sprint around much more easily which is great for out maneuvering all these bloodied melee builds that are popular. 
---
You are just fucking amazing aren't you I already have you added remember I'm the steel guy😂
---
There are plenty of places to put your camp that are not popular places. If you're on a resource collector site, that will obviously be more popular. Near high grinding areas, near vendors, near workshops, near water, etc. Those will all be popular. I used to have that problem until I found a little spot in the woods in the NW. My turrets even very well, by themselves,  handle enemies (scorched, robots, a few molerats, mutants don't really come down the street or take pot shots at my place yet). And the enemies don't seem to bother me as much as other places. It's just that you have to sacrifice being near everything, though I use the Vault to FT to get closer to things more economically.
---
Thanks...   
---
And having "guards" is totally lore friendly, but in actuality, who wants to sit around for 4 hours while someone else does trades? ;). 
---
I'd love some RollPlaying Raiders to be honest, like the "Food guy" who demands food or inflicts death and destruction...    
---
But it's only the griefers...
---
Sweet well there ya go
---
I'd like a vendor you can setup in your camp (let's say right outside the door) that you can setup to sell plans/gear/food. I've got so many plans I just want to sell for a quarter of their vendor price, so that others can have them, and without finding a random lowbie player and activate trade just to set all the prices to 0. 
---
That or you wave, drop the items, then point to them on the ground menacingly.
---
I too hope they stick with the game and continue to improve.  The early game is great!  Stepping out of the Vault is allot of fun, and the first few hours are the most well thought out.  The few bugs you experience are usually quite minimal impact on your enjoyment early on.  
---
It's late game that things fall apart for our beloved West Virginia.  The main quest concludes with spawning and killing a queen schorchbeast, which is severely bugged and is more than a little likely to either : Fly off the map, or stop taking damage, or not drop any loot.  That's a pretty large 'ooof', and just the tip of the iceberg with loot issues, and late game bugs.  
---
There is allot going on in the game that Bethesda has never dealt with before, the early game is fantastic, and Bethesda appears to be taking action to try and fix the late game issues...so I am cutting them some slack on late game meta play...it will get there eventually.   
---
Yeah FO76 is an odd beast for me.
---
Some people think MMO, some think multi-player RPG and I like to think of it as a looter shooter since my play style in looter shooters is to complete the quests and then just farm materials and legendary gear until I have what I want. 
---
I then engage in a few hours PvP if the looter shooter has it and it is well designed using my farmed gear. PvP in FO76 isn't functional for me yet so I will only engage in that come March 2019.
---
So for me with a looter shooter lens on FO76 it works great.
---
Alright I'll take it just let go go sell some stuff to hit 2k I went broke yesterday so gimme a bit
---
Ok no problem
---
Like I said it's not the pvp part it's the fact that the opposing side has nothing to loss. I enjoy pvp sometimes. Workshops are fun and taking out the random bounty greifers is enjoyable but on a risk/reward stand point people dont stand to gain anything by going after a bounty and in some instances can loss caps themselves.  I get the risk of going after a bounty means you're setting your self up to be in a pvp situation but I believe that is the people setting up the ambushes dont have the caps to pay out if they are killed they shouldn't get any for killing. A rework of the bounty system as a whole would be nice maybe have it so caps can go into the negative if you have a bounty or something so a guy cant have a 2k bounty and only 10 caps on him. 
---
I have. Admittedly I have a lot of the variants including the picture discs, the box sets, and the Wolfenstein ones. It's one of the few props that has the verisimilitude where it functions as it does in the game.
---
I've been slowly uploading my collection on the Bethesda forums.
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/211314/a-very-fallout-record-collection
---
How about Bethesda sucks on a lemon for charging me 5,760 caps for excavator calibrated shocks,  then tells me I have to have 5 pure flux for it 
---
After reading some reviews, I decided to give Witcher 3 a try and have been really enjoying it.
---
It's legal, check u/jchamlin comment he posted an imgur proof from Bethesda. 
---
I agree with you, didn’t mean to sound condescending just sometimes it’s annoying when a PvE player complains about PvP when they engage it. I can see that’s not the case and hopefully Bethesda fixes this soon because negative caps should be a thing on this scenario.
---
Up vote to the top
---
Except most people just think to themselves that whoever did this is probably a deadbeat who is all alone. I doubt anyone actually confronts when they could just server swap.
---
Poke around the alley outside of the AVR medical center and look for the body of a young girl in a ratty dress. It'll start you on the Order of Mysteries quests; those got me from level 15 to 25 where I picked up Rose's quests again. Only problem is  &gt;!getting the historical sword, which requires you to get into a room in Whitesprings. Get an upper-level friend or stock up on stealthboys and stimpacks!&lt; 
---
Not to add anymore burn to the grind but I have some steel as well
---
Atleast some truth there...  
---
And sorry if your talking from personal experience.
---
Since the rumored bans due to inventory (non-legendary or QASmoke room stuff) I've slowed down my intake, especially since "Black-Tuesday's" weight capping...  
---
Maybe that, or the fact I've already had a phone call initiated by Bethesda over my bug report submissions has kept me from being targeted..
---
Heard it's been around twice. I know I missed the first one in the first month I hope the second wasn't recent.
---
Do you accept pre-war money?
---
Sent request 
---
Haha, or if you bought the tricentennial edition, +$20 real dollars, and then have to also use materials to apply the paintjob.
---
TV D
---
Dinner and surgical trays
---
Same, i hope the opportunity to buy it is soon to come.
---
Is there a timer after tagging an enemy to still get XP?
---
You're good. I know there are so many post complaining about just about everything under the sun. Over all I enjoy the game. I just wish that some of the things that the greifer exploit would get looked at. Over all I havent run into many but I know they are out there and I want the player base to grow not get discouraged by people exploiting poorly thought out game features lol
---
&gt; But if thats the case why are some plans not always available, if another player cant buy the plan before I got there? (which a lot of people tend to still believe).
---
I've never seen the "Set in Stone" plans gone from my listings unless I personally bought them.  Sturdy and Heavy Leather armor plans at the Responders vendors, especially in Flatwoods, would at least have one or two parts missing if it were shared, given how many new (level 5-25 players) I see running around.  Heavy Leather is a very nice setup and very easy to deck out with nice mods as it's cheap to craft/scrap.
---
I think the reason why some things are not there all the time isn't because other players buy them, but because those items are still Random, and the RNG populates those extras.
---
Are you on pc? I would like to kit my mothman xo-1 pa
---
Nope. When it dies, you get xp. Not sure what effect it would have if you leave the area?
---
&gt;And guy which one of your friends didnt drop off his junk beforehand?
---
what? im not in the video and i dont know anyone on that video if that is what you are implying .. and yes 88 stealth boys are a dead given since you dont get flag in the script to catch dupers for 100s of items ... ..
---
&gt;I farm stealth boys by server hoping vendors. It's actually pretty easy, so you should stop your witch hunt bullshit already
---
and i dupe 100s of items and im not banned .. dont wana be that guy but you could easely dupe items in the 100s and not get cought since the trigger is over 100k items lol
---
I am a FO1&amp;2 'veteran' in the sense that I bought and played FO1&amp;2 when it came out in the late 90's.
---
I was a massive turn based RPG fan back then and played actual old school D&amp;D with friends weekly and yes based on that FO76 is a big departure. On the flip side I am also a big looter shooter fan of late and to me FO76 is just a looter shooter in the Fallout universe and I can't be happier. 
---
FO5 will be the next Fallout for the die hard FO1&amp;2 fans, but honestly it seems even FO4 wasn't great in their eyes so who knows. Maybe the Fallout in space game will make them happy again.
---
How did you get the foundations down like a quarter of a floor? I tried this with one of my builds with no luck. 
---
The Pitt was always in Pittsburgh in fallout cannon 
---
I think the cult of the mothman got infiltrated by the interloper.
---
 The Mr Handy, very fast, degrades fairly quickly. Did a bunch of Mr Gutsys abd that brought it down from 49 to 35 with still some over repair left.
---
 The combat Knives, fast, degrade much slower and you barely notice it. I don't have any hard numbers, I've only had it for a day or so.
---
Cause the Story Missions pretty much tell you to, and it's got a nice river nearby.

Unyielding/bloodied/sentinal stacking is redicoulous and needs to be toned down. 
---
I do hope that we can create our own NPC for trading. And make the server fixed for everyone. How can we rebuild appalachia if what we are building resets evrytime. Imagine if you can rebuild an entire town with all the NPC that would be better. Plus factions. Player should be classified according to factions.
---
In PvP, farming stealth boys is common and having upwards to 100 is not suspicious. They are easy to legitimately acquire within these numbers is easy. Per server, you can usually hop venders and acquire at least 10. The enclave bunker alone you can get 3 regular and 3 mark III stealth boys. I understand what you're saying, but 100 of any item by your terms is therefore suspicious. Is my 150 ballistic fiber suspicious? Or my 100 stimpacks? This is an unnecessary allegation of duping. So: STFU with your witchhunting bullshit
---
Technically some of the lore suggests that the real mothman (pre bombs) survived and is a hive mind with the other mothmen you see in the wilds.
---
Theres also a bit of hive mind lore with the strangler vines. 
---
And then theres the obvious scorched hive mind.
---
What ive gathered so far is that the scorched wanna control everything. The strangler wants to control everything and the mothmen are neutral with the possibility of going against the scorched if for no other reason than their own survival.
---
I'm sad to say these INI tweaks are still relevant. Sure the game has an ingame DOF slider, but this only removes static DOF. It still uses Dynamic depth of field. Which i can not find anywhere within the game, Unless i'm a blind little shit.   
---
Furthermore it uses the horrid Godrays from fallout 4. use the following to remove it.  
---
bVolumetricLightingEnable= 0  
---
iVolumetricLightingTextureQuality= 0   
---
I vote separating PVP and PVE, it's two different types of players entirely. If adventure mode can't be 100% PVP free then make a wilderness zone where PVP is allowed to appease that crowd. I'll gladly play PVP separately from PVE but as long as I have to choose I'll be leaving servers and blocking players to avoid the bs.
---
You know plenty about the way dupers work. You also have a really peculiar handle. See the way that this implication/accusation thing works?
---
There were/are plenty of ways to obtain stealth boys that extend beyond cheating little guy.
---
These are big camps by players level 40+ 
---
Not 2 foundation first camp attempts.
---
Unfortunately that update is the furthest out.
---
Literally read the fucking subreddit. The game tricks you into a false sense of fun that is quickly depleted and leaves you with nothing to pursue, acieve, or aspire towards. Sorry, just sick of these posts
---
I don’t use chameleon. I do know that at time DANGEr and CAUTION get bugged. It gets stuck on either one. However, it doesn’t effect being found or modifier damage. Modifier damage from my experience is only dropped when in DANGER and Line of sight. 
---
At times it seems like it is bugged with being easily detectable while moving. It seems to be hit or miss with trying to sneak right upon something. Sometimes they can’t see me when I am right in front if them. Other times I am detected from pretty far out. 
---
I usually test it bu seeing how close I can get until it changes to Caution and backing up until it goes back to Hidden. 
---
Most of the time it doesn’t matter either way. I can hit them from pretty far out. I can hit them if they are visible no matter the distance without VAts. With vats I can still hit them from pretty far out. 
---
I usually tag the leader with vats with a crit and then follow up the other mobs while they are looking around and I am still Hidden or as they are rushing the direction of shots fired while in caution. 
---
One of the reasons Whitesprings sucks is that sneak can be bugged and they will detect me inside buildings. I have a hard time tagging mobs inside buildings without being detected right away. Once detected my damage can go to shite. 
---
This sub, their Twitter, official forums. 
---
Wouldn’t it just work like it does now?  Only thing that really changes is how you got the mod, not how you apply it.  
---
watoga sells the mod, no one sells the plan.
---
Same you do in most looter shooter games I would say. Play 120-150h, do all the quests, grind for all the gear you are interested in and then hopefully some PvP or team dungeon raid events. 
---
Then move on to another looter shooter until this one has new content. Rinse repeat. For best results I like rotating between The Division (1 &amp; soon 2), Warframe, Destiny 2, Anthem (soonish, waiting for a few bug fixes), ESO, Borderlands 2 &amp; Monster Hunter World.
---
If we nuke 3 fissures sites, it could release one of each.... MothraMan, Goddeathclaw, and Queen Miredorah!

---
You dupe, and then you accuse random people on reddit of duping? You are a true champion.
---
You bring up great issues, but until it is fixed you don't have much choice other than holding off on these things. I have energy weapons I would like to use but cannot because of the durability issue. So I am holding off on using them.
---
I am extremely careful when I play this game. When I take a workshop, I check who is nearby and crouch down so they cannot find me on the map. I have premade safe rooms I build to ensure I do not die instantly upon fast travel. I also use the chameleon mutation so people cannot see me either. Hell, I even crouch walk around my camp if I suspect griefers are around.
---
You likely put your camp in a location with high foot traffic. This invites all kinds of people, good and bad. My camp is far south where few venture. I get the occasional weary wanderer looking for a short rest stop.
---
The point I want to make is, don't make yourself an easy target. Check the map when joining a server to get a feel for what people are up to. Multiple workshops taken by a high level person? They are likely looking for PVP. Someone with a large bounty? Must be griefing or baiting people; jump server. Standing around with almost no HP? Hell even I have taken the 50 cap bounty just to take what they were holding. This is advice from someone who often looks for people like yourself to take advantage of. I always go for high level workshops and shoot low HP people who use a bloodied build. 
---
They don't. They require skill level to *create*. The person  you are replying to clearly has never picked up a mod off a corpse or bought one from a vendor to apply to a weapon. 
---
.......i am an idiot...... 
---
thanks mate! &lt;3 
---
Are you saltyspitoon? 
---
I don't use the jet pack most of the time, I like the Motion-Assist Servos for the +2 strength most of the time.
---
Motion Assist + calibrated shocks gives great carry weight bonus.
---
I am running 1 X-01 leg with the shocks, and then 1 T-60 leg with shocks. Until I get 2nd shocks I will not upgrade that leg.
---
I’ve posted here a few times and I’m banned. Not a duplicator but received the same notification. They’ve already confirmed that I didn’t have any of the items in question as others have so they are looking deeper why it was triggered. 
---
I’ve been honest with them fully since data doesn’t lie. I gave them my mule character account which is overweight and doesn’t have anywhere near 100k of anything total. 
---
I’m waiting to hear back now but at least part of it has been cleared up.
---
I've been thinking about how in a PVE only mode workshops won't work because you can't contest them. Maybe a solution is making general areas areas round workshops to be wilderness zones and the workshops are the risk vs reward that lures players in. Runescape works this was however I hate being less efficient because I prefer less risk.
---
I've thought for a long time that a drop down menu for naming PA would be a decent solution. Give us the names like "T45", X-01" but also names like the mods we can put on them. 
---
"Tactical Power Armor"
---
"Optimized Power Armor"
---
Etc. 
---
Where do you find a glowing one out of whitespring ?
---
Shoot there's a random encounter spawn?? I'm camped on my low level there where the concrete thing is so I can get concrete, I didn't know that there's a random encounter spawn near it
---
Wow that was really helpful thank you 
---
I wasnt sayin you were in the video dont you got some dupin to do buddy go on n git 
---
Not necessarily, it just depends on how far Bethesda is willing to take it.  
---
Final Fantasy XIV came out in a horrific state.  Square-Enix ate crow, apologized for its current state, made the game "free 2 play" for people who bought the 1.0 version while they rebuilt the game from the ground up.  
---
New systems and ideas were tested and inserted into the original game, while players put it through their paces.  Some things worked, others were tossed, others were refined and improved.  Eventually, the game was pulled down in a massive World Event for a few months, while they prepared to launch the new 2.0 servers.
---
FFXIV is now one of the most successful modern MMOs and one of the only titles to keep its subscription model.
---
If Bethesda were willing to commit to a similar path, many of his ideas could be implemented.  But I highly doubt Zenimax will give them the time and resources needed for a complete refit of the entire game.  
---
A strong majority of times I've been contested maybe 80% of the time it's been to take the workshop and log off or somthing else toxic and annoying.
---
I've seen him once near the Monongah Overlook, and once south of the Big Maw in the Mire. He's a tough fight, but much slower than a Wendigo.
---
Don't feel a particular need to see him again.
---
Took a good bit of farming, and another good bit of trading :)

Thank you I’ll look at it

welcome to the world of the internet over exaggerating every little thing on the planet to the point that those who haven't tried it already hate it but don't even know why.

check the two images i put up, didnt want to spoil whats there
---
Thank you too y’all are great I’ll check the ya place out
---
wow, I did not know that, but now it makes perfect sense. 
---
Dude bro thanks I’ll look right I get home thanks 
---
I mean I camp there, but not **right** there. I’m a bit north, on the other side of the bridge.
---
I feel the same way about Charleston station never gonna get the bot while your camp is there
---
ugh no . i was just pointing it out ,, the dude was making it obvius that he duped lol
---
naw . you duped ,, its ok doe lol
---
It’s actually spawn exactly at location that you described 
---
Yes but I had to leave real quick to pick up my kid brb in 30 
---
People camp there and offer stuff to low level players 
---
Alright. I'll be on. Just send a message on PSN when you're on. 
---
Thanks, definitely worth investigating. 
---
Ok, thats what I thought. The mod menu shows the skill requirements and materials required even if it is a purchased mod (which is a little misleading), but if you look closely at the bottom, (on xbox) "A: craft" will change to ”A: attach mod" if its a mod, and presumably change color from greyed out.
---
They deffinetly don't feel valuable and feel lIke a waste of time collectin many. I recently got all workshops on an empty server, had to log off shortly after and the realization that they would only have been useful if I stayed on for another few hours kind of sucked.
---
Damn, looks like I'm moving!
---
Thanks, OP. Had you not posted this I wouldn't have known
---
&gt;Thank
---
You don't have to have me sit around for 4 hours buddy. Just find a way to ping me, be it here or discord. Don't mind keeping an eye out or hopping on your server if you know some griefers are coming. 
---
Not sure I get your point. The vaults are raid instances for groups to go in and clear for a shinny drop at the end. Why would there be any pvp in the vaults. Or you mean you want to be able to solo explore vaults rather than making them raids? 
---
Wood armor with sentinal or cav could help berserker builds. There are also weapons that allow for reduced damage. People should figure how to make their builds work, rather than how to nerf other builds.  As far as TSE nerf, two shot made instigating weapons useless, and explosive was just slightly over powered.
---
I picked the game up again recently and I’m having a blast. There are still some disconnect and minor bugs (ugh the teammate invisibility UGH) but I haven’t run into anything too awful. 
---
That roadmap has me pumped for the future of this game for the first time since launch. I sincerely hope they deliver. 
---
Thanks but they don’t respond?
---
I just take unowned ones and when they get contested I hop.
---
If all else fails claim a workshop that has an aluminum extractor sight and set it up. I'm on ps4 platform if you need help dm me.
---
No problem! 
---
Think most ppl who camp there don't know and for extracting concrete is a valid reason.
---
The encounter is e few meters next to the extractorside. There should spawn a corps, or nuke or satellite and so on.
---
Instances would be weird but deffinetly an idea!
---
You did not say "higher than", you said "really high" - There's a very distinct difference. I'd appreciate it if you didn't move the goal posts just so you sound like you were making a valid point when you weren't.   
---
You're also assuming the goals of the players and assigning one specific function to any given nukezone as if you can't farm flora from a whitesprings nuke in between respawns... when you can.  If memory serves, however, Yellowcake and Crimson are most common in Whitesprings while Violet, Crimson and Flourescent are plentiful from an SBQ nuke... That covers the most-used ammo types, so where would one be diverting their nuke from just to get flux?  
---
Opportunity cost is called convenience, chief. You can stop assuming everyone else's goals are the same as yours. I voiced a theory about why people act like getting Ultracite Ammo is time consuming or hard when it's not. Granted that is my opinion based on hours of utilizing the crating system, but stating whether or not it's "economically plausible" for a person to use Ultracite ammo because "they could drop nukes to farm legendaries instead" is a bogus argument; It's entirely up to them and how they wish to utilize their time and that's because it doesn't require MORE time to do, just a different application thereof... I.e. how CONVENIENT it is.
---
Shiiiiit that's awesome, how do you get it to proc?
---
Unfortunately not, I’m on PS4 :(
---
That's my personal take on it as well. 
---
When was blackbird back!? I have been checking daily since I missed it the first time.
---
The guy just wanted to destroy your base and have his buddy “clear” the bounty so other higher level bounty hunters won’t hunt them down
---
What you on? And if your on pc, you got names? 
---
"Antigreifer mechanics used by Griefers to grief" exactly how I feel. I barely even understand the shit that's happened to my in some situations. Hoping for future fixes.

I actually joined an event yesterday only to failed 20 seconds in despite having 7+ minutes left because the objective was to protect something that was apparently already very damaged.
---
Yep. 
---
Or how we paid full price for an unfinished game that went down to 30 in weeks. 
---
I didn't buy the game until Thanksgiving Weekend, I tend to wait until a couple of patches have dropped on Bethesda games, and I'm glad I waited cause it saved me some money on a game I love.
---
I have played every version of FO since FO1 in 1998, and still enjoy replaying them, slight variations in play style can change the game dramatically (ever side with Caesar or Mr. House in FONV?), I'm a bit of a Completionist.
---
The game has not been without it's issues &amp; Frustrations, but nothing has been totally game breaking, and patches are coming at a reasonable rate, with Bethesda seemingly listening to the players, to some degree.
---
What I don't understand with many commenter's is how anyone could run out of content in this game with only 100-150 hours played, I'm at over 500 hours and still have a few undiscovered locations, incomplete side quests, and quite a few Events I haven't done.
---
Granted I spend a lot of time Grinding for better gear, and have a few Events I have done numerous times, but there is so much to explore and do in this game, I feel like those players have completely missed the true Fallout Experience.
---
So if you've gotten bored with the game, try moving your CAMP, chasing events, and exploring some of those areas you have never been to.
---
Flatwoods Church has two inside, one behind vendor bot and one upstairs.
---
Yes, but his buddy also gets the caps for getting the bounty. And maybe they trade for junk, sharing the caps, like a 50-50 split. It's really ingenious, but not fun for me.
---
Realllllly well I don’t we’re that at but I would like too and Iam on ps4 if anyone want to come along to help
---
That's a whole lot of gunpowder.  Do you farm it from super mutants or craft it from waste acid?  Would love to hear your scrapping rout.
---
50 can easily take on 100.... dont be a wuss. 
---
^ This. I actually like many of his ideas (a few, not so much), but I think they'd be much better implemented as a separate game mode, so those who don't want the Ultimate Survival Experience can still play.  
---
Glad to see you enjoying it. You actually started playing at a pretty great time. Alot of fixes already happened and they just released a road map mentioning multiple free content additions over the next few months.
---
Bloodied makes bersrker weapons useless.
---
Bloodied and bersrker are identical except you can't wear any armor at all if you want to get the damage that bloodied gives. Berserker is a fun idea but why would I choose to be a glass cannon with no armor perks when I could run bloodied and get the same but benefit from 15 extra Special points as well?
---
Bloodied needs to be toned down in order to make other builds viable. Look at the trading markets..... nothing but bloodied...... bloodied...... bloodied.
---
All the complaints are justified, but when that's all you hear when you're visiting this sub, it gets old real fast.
---
Sir, won't you do me a favor and go ahead and turn around, place your hands behind your back, and intertwine your fingers.
---
You are being charged with being incoherently drunk in public and disorderly conduct. 
---
Think you have to scrap them to unlock,  I've never seen the plan or mod. I have seen silenced lever actions already supressed for sale though at harpers.  I can mod it for you for a small fee if you like? 
---
Or he just sells bullet for the bounty amount— the caps come from the wanted player’s own wallet
---
Utter Madness!!!  Completely Unsafe!!!  But still, take an up-vote...
---
Agreed. The fact that there's some beefy content on the way will curry them some favour.
---
....   
---
But the whole point of being a "Merchant" is finding both referrals (Reddit) and foot traffic, hiding the camp kind of defeats the purpose doesn't it?  
---
I am a high level player, and the vast majority of the people Claiming workshops (including me before the recent patches increased instability) do it for plans, XP, challenges and resources, not to force PVP..  
---
Mentioned in another comment, 9/10 times this occurs the person is "neutral"...  
---
It's generally "Packs" of people who work together and between kills drop group and murder each the other to clear bounties..  
---
Hell its the only smart way to do it, abusing the loopholes Bethesda unintentionally created.
---
I respect and understand the concept of PVP and how it "could" work in this Universe, people hunting down "whales" for easy riches, but it's so broken and exploitive it's not worth participating in unless you are specifically building out for it. 
---
Why does your suggestion, well intentioned or not, make me feel like your suggesting I'm asking for it? ;). 
---
Non-Bloodied build, not standing around and "looking to be abused", heck its happened recently with multiple people in my camp doing trades...  
---
I have 8K of it on a mule, and so much cloth that I've started to sell bulk of it.
---
I don't do anything special, except maybe farm West-Tek a bit more than is healthy. The gunpowder in particular comes from when I started playing, and just parking it on another char as I couldn't keep up with steel and lead.
---
I'm on PC. I can't remember the exact names because I went to the "recent" tab under social and blocked them both, so now they aren't showing up at all. But one name something like LunaUnderider, and the one who destroyed my camp was Bobbddtt... Something like that. I'm sorry I can't remember the exact names.
---
I don’t think it exists either 
---
Yeah, i know how it feels like. It seemed so distant in the past to have all these plans. Now i can reinvest every single cap i earn towards new plans. Still missing a bunch but if the demand comes, i can go ahead and purchase it. It’s been like this since the plans update
---
Exactly how I feel. Hoping they make them separate so I can enjoy either or.
---
Have you seen the roadmap? They mention vault 94 and 96 opening for vault raids but vault 63 has no mention so maybe that one will be more traditional? Also if you look at the image for Wastelanders Fall 2019 the right hand side looks like a vault door and it mentions a new main quest events and new factions. It might just be wishful thinking on my part but I get the feeling a proper Fallout vault experience is on the cards, here’s hoping anyway.
---
Link to road map for anyone who hasn’t seen it: https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019
---
Dude. Posting this multiple times a day is only gonna turn people away from your primitive religion. 
---
IMO,   
---
Unless there are game changes, the vault will be like the doing a nuke silo.  
---
you can do them solo or with a team.
---
But I'm not a dead beat or alone? Actually ally of people just watch as I destroy there bases
---
Oh shit I posted this more than once oof sorry just a little backed my bad 😅
---
Baked 
---
Ahhhhh 😭 why god 
---
You really hit the nail on the head. 100+ hours invested and you're gonna hit a content wall.
---
The people complaining about lack of content after 100s of hours need to give their heads a shake. Wtf did you expect? 
---
I think arrogant was more like it....
---
I saw the roadmap but it doesnt mention 63. Heres to hoping
---
Yeah the Witcher 3 was great. I still need to go back and complete the DLC for it.
---
It also has a great loot thing going with the gear sets.
---
I think I ended up with 2 or 3 full sets but kept using the Cat School set in the game.
---
https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Witcher_3_witcher_gear
---
Lots of fun collecting them.
---
Level up a bit more and get Super Duper.  30% chance each craft to make 2 veggie starches.  
---
Add in Green thumb to double your harvesting.  
---
You'll be swimming in Adhesive.
---
Okay you literally just havent read the updates then
---
Got discord? Me and a couple of mates hunt grieves if you want in 
---
I think they mean solo exploration, not raiding. Of course the pvp part might refer to something like the divisions dark zones or whatever they were called.
---
Then again could be like WoW where getting into the raid meant fighting your way past other guilds at the entrance. (Good times at the black temple!)
---
But it specifically says pvp unlike the nuke silo which is coop
---
You know that al equipment caps at 50, right? I mean I’m level 84, and I can take on people two or three times my level easily. 
---
A damage de-buff for an X amount of time
---
IMO, the end-game is similar to the end-game of other Behesda games: roll up a new character to play with a different build.  It's not like there's a lot of endgame in Skyrim.
---
Which, admittedly, means I usually move on partway through character #2 or #3.
---
If you have the gun plan you can scrap them for the mods that's what I did.
---
This game in a nutshell right here. 
---
They sometimes spawn inside Hawkes Refuge, Roboco Research Center, and Watoga Emergency Center.  
---
Nice! I only have one album framed in my game room: [link](https://img.discogs.com/yff0XFN-lGwX8EeUC7RQjIhRvzg=/fit-in/300x300/filters:strip_icc\(\):format\(jpeg\):mode_rgb\(\):quality\(40\)/discogs-images/R-7206992-1436169658-5013.jpeg.jpg)
---
So you hit level 100 in 20 hours?
---
Two level 100's? So not only do I lose my camp and all the resources and time put into it, but then I die and have to repair my armor and weapons... Plus he had marsupial and some other mutations. No way could I beat him alone. 
---
Slender Boi
---
those players are the WORST..i got dealt with so any times around the   golfclub..i kind of know to always stash stuff before venturing out over there..im actually getting pretty good at stashing my junk throught my play periods
---
What suggestion do you have to make berserker better, rather than nerfing bloodied?  
---
Exactly tons of fun screwing around with PVP sub lvl 80 and then after when your grinding for things and putting in hours for specific gear or supplies PVP becomes the most toxic annoyance ever. The worst part is half those encounters the PVP'er is toxic on top of the fact that you just lost time and enjoyment.
---
My apologies if I find being forced to work around exploits and loopholes is burdensome.. 
---
But regardless of what "flare" I choose to use Commenting on  the broken and exploitive PVP is reasonable I think...  
---
Watoga, complete "Mayor for a day" then just go bot bashing.. you can get some nice 3\* legendary items, Lead, aluminum, and steel plus your own little defense force against outsiders lol.
---
IMO there's two big sources of the complaints.
---
First, the game at release was "graded on a curve" because Bethesda.  We just expected more from them than other developers.
---
Second, there's those that wanted it to be New Vegas 2, and are still unhappy that Bethesda doesn't do that.
---
I’ve started keeping a few molotovs in my inventory purely for this purpose.
---
Well, 3 fluxes and a few other standard bits of crafting junk. But yeah, keep chugging along the main quest and you'll get 'em!
---
Yup! And those damn gutsy's are tougher than ever too! That 3 star legendary Gutsy drop me a bunch of fusion cells and a freakin wooden spoon. A total waste of ammo and ruined my lvl 50 Unyielding heavy combat armor and legs, now it gave me even more reason to hunt and grind for those darn ballistic fibers. All for a darn wooden spoon.
---
I've been on the grind for steel, and every time I get about 500 or 600, I always end up making about 1000 rounds of ammo. 
---
UM EXCUSE ME WHAT? This is incredible. I love you.
---
That was after I already beat everything. I'd say I was level 80 and then when we had done everything, my friends and I continued to grind enemies until we ended up leaving the game. I got to that level from doing nuke events in between because when the game first launched the enemies in nuke zones gave ridiculous amounts of XP so it was easy to level up. Of course in typical Reddit fashion I get downvoted and yelled at for telling the truth because people will defend something they like with their last dying breath from any form of criticism. 
---
Rude. Let "Lucky" sleep.
---
Ok would I be able to buy it for 1.3k and buy the rest next time I buy steel cuz I need the vendors to refresh if not I understand its hard to trust someone you just met 
---
Maybe it’s just because I play TF2 and deal with people trying to scam me out of Aussies and unusuals, but...a good rule of thumb for any trade, across any platform on any game, is that if the trade sounds too good to be true, that it **will** be too good to be true. I’m sure it sucks. r/TF2 has people warning others about spammers every now and then, and I’ve had friends lose stuff. Just, in the future, don’t do this sorta stuff. As great as 8k caps sounds, you’ll almost never find someone that’s being honest about doing that. 
---
What is he exploiting? Why don't you group up with him? There's nothing more inherently 'fair' and 'honest' about how you feel the game should be played versus how this person is playing, YOU JUST DON'T LIKE IT. You need to get over it, amigo, you're sounding super petty right now.
---
lol @ im reporting you and you will be banned..why do they all say this??? also..im done with the random trading for ppl passing me by..the other day someone was requesting my BOS fatigues..i dont have a mic..and that was not easy to get..but i could tell they were kind of mad..um no rare outfits are mine..if u want something like a clown suit or maybe a strait jacket thats fine dont ask me for my BOS fatigues
---
Yea that’s fine I can sell it to you for that
---
Same here. I haven't heard anyone or spoken to anyone despite my mic being on and working in an XBox party. I can see when another player is trying to talk to me. I've tried every setting to see if it was on my end. I just accepted it doesn't work. It would be nice if it worked, but I still enjoy the hell out of the game.
---
I was camping at the lighthouse on the rocks near the picnic table section. The lighthouse offers free water with the water pump and The Path to Enlightenment event gives tons of Radtoad eggs which make Rodtoad omelette's. The legs also have decent value and when cooked  give decent HP.
---
But now I have a new idea. :) 
---
I'm just having a hard time finding the T series PA parts, nobody seems willing to sell them. I'm just proud right now that I can make jetpacks, shocks, and optimized bracers for all the T series!
---
source? because the only mention of PvP is about the new mode coming on the 26th (survival) we have absolutely 0 info outside of 93/94 will be raids
---
I feel like the Free States survival bunkers were a creative compromise - a way to populate the world with "Mini-Vaults" that could have similar stories attached to them.
---
its different when you actually pay for the game and not have it in a bundle...let us know your feelings in two months
---
Yeay! Name'in an shame'ib

Both of your link titles are inaccurate. 
---
It wasn't a 200 dollar misrepresentation of a bag. It was a misrepresentation of a bag in a 200 dollar game bundle. 
---
Nor was the bottle case ever advertised as glass. Not once. People who have never purchased anything but captain Morgan's, just assumed it was. 
---
I'm comin
---
It's coming! Looking forward to PVP on survival mode.
---
Right, but what I want to know is why should I buy a mod someone else made that I can only use if I have the perk that allows me to make that mod myself? I mean, they could have a plan I don’t have, but other than that it kind of limits the market a bit for selling mods if they can only be installed by people with the same perks. I suppose it could also save time on resource farming, but that’s about the only benefit I could see.
---
Would you be against sharing some of these locations with me? I have a spot I farm the ore for lead and steel together but then I have to server hop to farm acid and it's a pain
---
Log off next time then. I'm level 218 and can definately be killed by level 40-50 players...level has no benefit after 50. If someone starts griefing you and you don't want to fight back, log off the server before they can destroy too much.
---
I don't have discord, but thank you for the offer. 
---
Ok I’m in artisan corner
---
Exactly. They’re like I have that too and it doesn’t do that. Umm yea it does. Took me forever to trade and buy the robot and combat and all shit I have for this ugly ass set lol. I told them I’m gonna report the chat for harassment lmao 
---
Wa wa wa, the dude found a better more efficient way to play and you don't like it. If BGS agrees with you they'll change it and you can feel justified, but until then stop complaining, they guy isn't cheating or duping or getting into any area he's not supposed to be in, he's using in-game systems as designed to gain more efficiently play the game as he sees fit. No whether or not he SHOULD be doing that is an ethical question, one which you have an obvious stance on (which I would agree with to a point, the dude shouldn't have killed you and if he's afk doing this then he's kind of a douche), but there's nothing inherently unfair and dishonest about what he's doing, YOU JUST DON'T LIKE IT. Time to move on, amigo, you're sounding more and more petty as you complain.
---
Sick of these posts? Stop coming to this sub maybe?
---
Why you feel it's your internet job to inform people who enjoy the game that they are wrong is beyond me. 
---
They aren't, no. However, it does ruin a "popular" farming location. Now, I don't think it's on Bethesda so make it so no one can build here, but it's also totally acceptable for someone to not like where you base is and wreck it. Fair is fair, both ways, as far as I can see. 
---
I think berserker is fine. It's on par with all of the other legendaries. I've played for a week now without adrenal reaction and a bloodied build feels equal to berserker, I feel like I often need to take cover or risk dying. Add in adrenal reaction and bloodeid is insane.
---
Get all legendaries on an equal field by eliminating bloodied) adrenal reaction stacking....... encourage variety in builds........and soften up enemies slightly.
---
Also I meant stim packs not atoms idk why it auto corrected lol
---
Excuse my ignorance, but what’s so special about the 22nd? I try to follow the lore as closely as I can, but I don’t remember anything special happening the day before the bombs dropped. 
---
I JUST Wiiiiiiiish YOU COULD...customiiiiize...your...own vendoooor.. PROTECTRON with yourrrr...choice...OF WORDS 
---
Opening a cargobot that you shoot down doesn't give you the wanted status; only the ones that are summoned from relay towers.
---
Very interesting, since you don’t use chameleon effect, your only sneak mechanism is distance/crouching, is that correct? Does it give you the multiplying effect when fighting the scorchbeast queen? I.E. you stay crouched and far from other players so the damage of each of your shots gets the sneak multiplier. During SBQ fights I often noticed some people were using suppressed sniper rifles, I was thinking ‘good luck with that’. But if they get the sneak benefits like you do, they were probably contributing serious damages to the queen. 
---
I’ve seen certain legendary armors that have ‘harder to detect while sneaking’ as a feature, do those work? 
---
Bit weird to license it just for BETA though? Unless I'm missing something here
---
Exactly, i miss quite a few myself as well. Ive got the T45 plans all set, but i need the helmet for t51b, and torso, left arm and left leg for t60. Treasure maps and watoga quests rarely give those plans, but chances are so low. It’s very frustrating. Been looking for them for a long time, and i think as two major power armor modders in our respective platforms, we need to let Bethesda know about this. Dear u/ladydevann would you be kind enough to share our concerns with the team? We highly appreciate that. We would love some more certainty about where and how to get power armor piece plans. 
---
I just figured that out. My husband and I share the account, he's helping me learn how things work. I don't do pvp, I do the quests and events, explore and do pve.
---
I mean...rules of the wasteland. 
---
I’d do 1000 caps
---
Only on the F76 sub will you find people lusting after lootboxes
---
I've had it happen several times while defending Bog Town and the RR Mega Stop, and saw one at Prime the other night. If you want to find one, capturing a workshop on the east side of the map is probably your best bet.
---
I got a level 1 Instigating hunting Rifle yesterday, and I'm over 140, I think I will give it to one of my Alts to see if he can kill a level 100+ player when he gets to level 5.
---
Any bleach is brain bleach if you drink enough

It’s even funnier cause I only use this armor when I’m harassed or my teammates. This is literally the second time I’ve used this armor 
---
Its called installed the game...not « turned it on »
---
Yep, I'm going Cat as well, and just upgraded to the 2nd level of the set (Enhanced?).
---
Went to take care of a Witcher contract (Here Comes the Groom) on Spikeroog, where a woman's betrothed is snatched by an Ekhidna. Start the fight with the Ekhidna, and it has the white boss-health bar at the top of the screen, and I killed the thing with 2 fast strikes.
---
I might be a little OP at the moment. :) 
---
There's a red one I've gotten multiple times in game but I've never seen the green one from the atom store. I could be wrong though 
---
You just look so... Delicious... I mean come on! 330 caps for taking you down! It's difficult for me to resist. Imagine what the teams are thinking. You would likely have to kill three of them for every one of your deaths just to break even. Being that high a level is a huge disadvantage.
---
are you on pc? I have like 3k I cant bring myself to just drop so I can give it to you if you want.
---
Dead Money creeped me the fuck out
---
Melee the beyotch. I only break two weapons that way...:-D
---
That's why I wanted to buy so much. Sick of interrupting my limited play hours for ammo farming. I just want a week or so uninterrupted.
---
Would be nice.

The easiest way I find to use any extractor it to select the extractor in build mode and run around looksing for the outline of where I can build it.

I got it wrong in the title--it's 10/23 that I meant, the day the bombs dropped.

---
For the longest time my camp was just North of the Overseer's Camp.  There is a large flat rock formation on the west side of the river.  I was there until I was level 50something.
---
One of my friends has his just South of the Overseer's Camp, along the river.  He hits up the Gym there in Flatwoods constantly for Lead, just hops out of his Camp, steps into the Gym.
---
I mean, just cause you are a high level person doesn't mean you _have_ to set up camp in the Savage Divide or Cranberry Bog.  The Forest makes this real easy to have a nice camp that doesn't get targeted by high level enemies.
---
Always there aren't you 😂
---
I craft a lot of stuff lol
---
Sure? The game is sort of publicly regarded as a trainwreck anyways so I don't think anyone would be extra suprised yet another feature was scrapped.
---
If you’re on XB1 I’ve got some good medic guns you can have 
---
Oh gotcha
---
maybe there was an issue or something and the license got pulled? hard to say. Like i said before, its just what I thought, nothing to back it up.
---
I hit up West-Tek every day or two, what’s this secret area?
---
Sea level
---
: D
---
I thought so too but no. Survival is PVP only and adventure will be unchanged. Most people in this thread just don't want to be griefed by people using the PVP Mechanic.
---
I have to go pickup my nephew but thank you I will be sure to repay you 
---
It's only onested muscles after Bethesda nerfed it.
---
you think pvp = griefing. You are the problem.
---
I have Instigating with swing speed...if interested what ya offering 
---
They aren't going to comment on specific plans for future content other than what they released in the roadmap last week.
---
Yeah here's to hoping they get that one right.
---
Dang well thank ya
---
Maybe they shouldn't have released an unfinished game, eh? Blaming a sub is an entertaining solution you people have come up with.
---
Wilderness zones like runescape might work, although the map isn't designed with a PVP zone in mind.
---

---
For fun?
---
What perks do you use with berserker?
---
This is a really good video, and I think hits on most of the crucial flaws of the game, as well as - and this is rare - actually offering some solutions.
---
That being said, I think the last thing Fallout 76 needs is to turn up the difficulty and becomes some kind of hardcore survival game. That would be terrible and I'd hate it even more than the current grindy mess that it is. So I'm gonna have to completely disagree with MATN's vision for the game. But otherwise, a very well made and thought out video.
---
Have a picture? How many stars? What's other perks on it?
---
I can do trade or caps
---
Just relog, don’t make life (or indeed a game) complicated...
---
I like the game too, but when I do run into glitches they’re super frustrating compared to regular Fallout games. Especially with crashes/freezing because you lose all the resources you just spent killing stuff in say, a nuke zone, forever. 
---
And bingo. This is why my camp is here. Plus the forest looks nice. And I leave everything unlocked so people can use my shower and workbenches. 
---
I've been playing, enjoying pvp and most recently getting griefed 70% of the time and 30% it's actually someone that wants to PVP. 
---
Hey OP how long have you been working for Bethesda?
---
Thank you, I will do that.
---
I am outclassed!!! 
---
Wowee :)
---
It's possible the new player doesn't fully understand how it works and 800 was how much it would cost by default If he didn't know how to change price
---
They're gonna be ugly regardless of location.
---
Just as I could do even easier since I have a second account I can trade op gear and my money to. But I wouldn't never stoop so low to "abuse" the mechanics like that.
---
That was my largest session. No more, too much pain in the back. :)
---
Cobalt flux is from silt beans and firecracker berries from what I’ve seen so far there are some by the white springs station

&gt;Plastering a smile on your face and forbidding any criticism is no way to compel change for a better product.
---
Well, it’s a good thing that’s not the point of /r/fo76FilthyCasuals.
---
Sic Brag about killing the queen!!! 
---
Last two times I've tried we have not killed her .... so many people with bad weapons coming down to try.  So much wasted Ammo ... sad panda gonna be sad panda 
---
The permanence, player interaction, and crafting systems are all really good ideas. But I definitely don't think the game needs to go more into the survival aspects - it's already enough of a grind to keep weapons repaired and ammo crafted. Hardcore survival would be a huge turn-off for me, and I think a lot of other casual players as well.
---
&gt;...no way to compel change for a better product.
---
Man I get it, and if the PVP system worked better if be down for it...    
---
But it's currently weighted against higher levels, both in how damage is factored and the Risk/Reward system. My damage is scaled down, while yours is not, etc etc...
---
Add in the unbalanced stacked Legendaries and build combos, and the fact you can server hop to avoid repercussions... 
---
I want PVP to work, in a balanced way...  
---
Protection rackets would just as profitable if not more so than murdering someone for the caps in their pockets..  
---
Charging "Tolls" to farm WhiteSprings (or when the Whales leave fat and happy) could be tons of fun and profitable...   
---
But "burning down" someone's house makes no sense outside the psychotic murder happy lunatics...
---
It's different for everyone I experience enough  griefing myself as well as my squad of 3 teamate separately that it's seriously soured our outlook on other players in the world.
---
I had one destroying my ammo factory... very annoying for an hour
---
You monster my people are dead!!! Why you show me this 😭😭😭
---
I used to play a game where you joined a pvp session and it marked a zone for pvp for those that joined and activated multiple 'capture the flag' locations.  PVE players could do their thing in the same area and be totally unaffected by the pvp'ers.  It also had instances for pvp on smaller maps for those that wanted that, usually established teams wanting to take on one another.  Just saying there are a lot of creative options other than having separate servers, though that is also an option.
---
Like I said in my original post I've been using bloodied. Just picked up a viable berserker weapon last night and goofed around with it.
---
I don't want to get into a min/max discussion......as I've stated I think berserker has potential.
---
No matter how much we put into a berserker build it will never compare to a bloodied build.
---
I wish. Lol
---
3 stars...don’t think I ever saw 4 star mole miner lol...plus 1 strength is other perk

Fort Defiance has a ridiculous amount of aluminum. I walked out with ~250 aluminum scraps on my last straight jacket run, just from all of the medical trays.

Shout out to Dagg (sorry, I forgot to write down your full name) who guarded me and my friend for a while through a mine and a few places, basically following us lvl 10 players at lvl 150 and even checking out our little houses and giving me plans to make it nicer. Couldn't spam the heart emote enough, you were the nicest! (Even if you probably won't see this, you were cute, made my day)

I wouldn't be on this thread if I hadn't been grifed multiple times while playing 200+ hours with my gf and I.  I think alot of people are here out of frustration.
---
Yeah, I just finished making a farm for tatos, corn and mutfruit to make adhesive. Haven't had a chance to make more than one batch so far.
---
Same experience.  Mothman kept showing at my camp but I saw a Flatwoods there last night as well.  I've seen Flatwoods more than I've seen Grahm.
---
That's good to know. I thought I had to buy it. Thanks!
---
Any diseases u get can be cured in the sulfur fountain in the white gazebo right by the tennis court in whitesprings. For free. Game changer for ya 8)
---
Yeah, it was pretty stupid not to ask for half of the caps upfront. 
---
What your feeling is that so many people talked trash you were thinking it was going to be a bigger mess then it was. 
---
Running around following someone for 10 minutes wacking them until they log or respond kind of falls under griefing (can't block them if they are crouching...). 
---
    
---
Following someone around a couple different servers repeating the same behavior is griefing, and frankly feels like stalking...
---
Exploiting loopholes to force PVP, from the random group invite from someone who's claimed a workshop to force enable PVP, to glitching mods, mutations or gear to force PVP is griefing...  
---
Running around as a Lvl 20, 50, 100, etc attacking level 5 - 10'ish sure seems like griefing.. 
---
It is a random encounter found mine by that old civil war fort in the toxic valley 
---
They throw you a bone: what not to like?
---
So stash your junk strip naked and hit that bastard in the head with a hammer. This is your home! No more excuses.  YOU DIE WITH HONOR DEFENDING YOUR HOME!
---
Also there would be almost no time lost. Repair all structures takes all of 5 seconds to use. And 50/50 chance they'd get a kick out of the sport of you trying and might give you some goods.
---
It's like the devs based PvP on experiences without any legendary items. If we had no legendaries PvP would be great. Hahaha now I want to organize an arena where everyone has to wear non legendaries. One set of fights with no pa, one with PA ... This could be fun
---
you nailed so many thoughts I've had. 
---
A griefer can discourage more players from playing than players can discourage Griefers from griefing. 
---
I haven’t fought the SBQ yet. I have stayed away for that reason. I don’t use power armor and I don’t want to make the fight harder for other players. I was waiting until I find a legendary rifle that may do more significant damage for that single fight. I don’t know that the build works for SBQ so I have just avoided it. If the modifiers still work then it should do a lot of damage. During regular SB fights I refill my crit meter with the scorch spawns. Then I crit shoot the SB. I can take 20-25% of the health of a SB with a sneak crit shot depending on the level of the SB. 
---
I can’t tell you that it is a good build for farming SBQ. It may be a good build for killing the adds and crit shooting the SBQ when they proc. 
---
I think we're all on this thread (most of us anyway) because we've had problems with people of lower than average intelligence that think that ruining another person's game experience is fun.  Hopefully the Devs are paying attention as well.  
---
Lol its the internet get over yourself. I have a right to not like things hence the discussion forum style. This exact post is posted 4 times a week at least, if they just read the sub theyd be informed. But reddit police is here weeewoooweeewooo
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/auqj9s/a_list_of_all_the_currently_bugged_challenges_in/
---
Yeah but that’s only 1 ultracite scrap and two bones which isn’t all that tough to get 
---
If this were r/fo76FilthyCasuals I'd offer to do it for free if you're on PC, but since this is the salty subreddit making friends here seems kinda sketchy.
---
//yes, that's a hint. Check out my flair on my comments in that sub and add me as a friend if you're interested.
---
I will try to capture one at WS, the Ghouls around the Hotel rooms &amp; Shops frequently drop through the world if you kill them on the stairs outside.
---
Is this solid or speculative?
---
Id enjoy reading what is viable with berserker in a follow up post.
---
I've encountered it at the Charleston train station a few times. Usually when I try to find for be the traveling robot vendor.
---
As a member of the Brotherhood Of Steel, I admit to being a Power Armor freak, so finding an individual with such a wide array of knowledge on everything PA brought tears of joy to me! It's been an honor buying from you Lord, you've helped me out when I needed it and I know you'd do the same for others. Keep up the good work. Steel be With You!
---
my end game is to build. I find a new spot and build around the land. it's fantastic fun.
---
I've seen him a few times in a few places. So far I've seen him between flatwoods and point pleasant, near the soft serve place and at Charleston. 
---
\^\^ this
---
I see you didn't get the sarcasm....
---
I want the dark wood floor to go on sale. Lol those blue and yellow floors hurt my face
---
Energy weapons are so cool but in FO76 they are practically useless.  Not enough dmg and break way too quickly. 
---
My anti armor 50 cal and auto grenade launcher w/heavy barrel are my go to SBQ weapons.  For critters roaming on the ground I may flip to All Rise or my Hunters Dragon.  If I’m really in the shit my 2 shot Gauss w/ultracite ammo comes in handy to bail me out. 
---
I'm deffinetly the saltiest of my crew but yeah I know we're all hoping for an update that makes these situations less demoralizing.
---
I refuse to trade with random people. They always want my AAE lever action.  Like yes I'm going to just give you my only good weapon I have?
---
Wait you can tame things now? Alright I might be coming back soon
---
Love the open concept, and the nuka cola bar!
---
I agree, it would be great to have more time to prepare, and be able to see the SBQ rise in a glorious fashion.
---
Ok thanks for the tip didn't know that
---
AGREE 100%. Honestly, that why I've stopped bothering with them. I run through hella .45 ammo with my TSE lever action which has to be repaired immediately afterwards just all for crap loot. Not worth the effort.
---
As much as I would love a remastered fallout 3, I'd be down for a Pitt DLC for 76
---
If you have deep pocketed on your regular armor it doesn’t carry over in PA. So, it’s normal to drop max weight if you have deep pocketed armor. Calibrated shocks can help.
---
Excavator gets a special set bonus that’s +100 carry weight. T-51 does not have that bonus.
---
Hope that helps.
---
An arena would be great and is a pretty basic idea so I don't know why that doesn't already exist when we have hunter vs hunted. :p
---
Was gonna say this thing is definitely gonna have to come to life at some point. It's set up too much.
---
You have been able to for a while now....
---
It says specifically "Fallout 76 getting new pvp mode: vaults" we dont know if it will only be 93/94 thats just the two theyre releasing atm
---
just r/woosh ‘d myself 
---
You can't figure that out on your own?
---
This is a multi-player survival game with an always-online presence. This means that you will always have griefers, exploiters, etc. If you cannot accept that you cannot control other's actions (justifiably or not,) an "offline mode" might be a solution that Bethesda could offer, which might meet your needs better?
---
You probably have some armor that has a carryweight bonus. When are wearing power armor it overrides your other armors stats. 
---
&gt;It's the first post apocalyptic survival game I've played, where it actually feels like surviving an apocalypse.
---
Heh...I see someone's not yet tried FO4's Frost mod.
---
"my redundant post is superior to your redundant post"
---
yawn, go put your energy into something positive
---
I get it dude, I'm a straight up A-hole, but even I reach a point where I want to be left alone to play with my friends in peace.  
---
Why you feel its your job to police comments is beyond me. See how easy that is?
---
I'm going to organize my own arena. And it's going to be bigger and better than any PvP currently in game.
---
Um ok great I've been gone bc of oh if I bugs and issues 
---
Same and then I go to repair all my weapons and suddenly I’m out of aluminum and adhesive bc all the TSE’s need it 
---
If got a friend, have them make an alt and help push them through the quest is your best bet
---
Thank you, the door on the nuka cola machine is the only thing locked but it's empty. Just waiting til we can stock it or at least put some on the counter. 
---
No I spend my time figuring out how to nerf other builds.
---
Very interesting! I'm open to anything that doesn't force me and my gf into a PVP situation basically.
---
That's the part I dislike. A mobile base, a home front to defend myself as I enroach on new territory, a familiar location in a hostile environment. With all the amenities I need to function.
---
Your idea punishes people who want to live only in their CAMPs, because they have inferior workbenches, even worse build budget and far less creative freedom.
---
If I want my home to stay in one place, I just won't move it.
---
As for RAIDs, I feel like that makes it a little too difficult for players playing as Raiders. Permanent bounties, PVP even in your base? You'd be one-shot by every high level player immediately. That discourages any role play since it's impossible to thrive or get to a position of dominance in the Wasteland, though the Raiderised decor sounds cool.
---
Your idea is just, in my opinion, flawed. Not bad, but it needs work.
---
I would have thought you spent your time trying to prove people wrong on the internet.
---
Bloodied &gt; Berserker.........prove me wrong.
---
I was thinking about building one out of a ring of 2 high foundations. I look forward to a post with your arena!
---
Who’s a good boi? Who’s a good boi?
---
It's just under one year. 316 days. 
---
After 122 levels of grinding, I finally got a TSE rifle.  Some level 200 wants to trade with me and wants my rifle... of course I declined. He then decided to call me every name in the book and tried to grief me lol
---
No, thats projection.
---
&gt;I've had my Alt's Camps Destroyed a total of 9 times now in 2 days.
---
Yeah, CAMP PvP needs to be addressed. Being able to just waltz up on somebody's site and wreck their shit with minimal repercussions for me feels bad and not very rewarding. They should offer a better reward for attacking PvP-enabled CAMPs ***and*** give players a means to make their CAMPs immune to attack from other players if they do not wish to PvP. The current system is kinda bleh.
---
&gt;I know I know, the Community will say "Don't use the mod"
---
Don't use the mod. People whacking you are jerks, but it's maybe a little bit also your fault to open yourself up to that kind of griefing *knowing* that using the mod can cost you. It's like, if you leave your car door unlocked you can't really complain about someone stealing your shit.
---
&gt;Got glitched into PvP and lost **days of work** farming Junk and Fluxes while in Passive Mode more than once
---
Wait, why don't you just stash your junk like a normal person?
---
&gt;all of my "Mules" who are more than 5k overweight
---
Ah, that's why. Also, Jesus Christ, *why are you hoarding this junk?!?* Make something. Craft shit. That's what junk is for.
---
&gt;Unstable Isotope and Electrically charged can and will "Proc" when attacked, while in passive, from Slap damage.
---
Can you provide video evidence of that happening? Because if you can prove that players can kill through slap damage, make that proof widely available, and publicize exactly how to kill players this way, I guarantee it will force Bethesda to address the issue sooner rather than later.
---
&gt;Players B - D from the Passive Group, no longer having "Player A" in the group, somehow become valid targets for "Revenge" even though "Player A" left the group at least 10 seconds before starting the Offensive.
---
Again, if you can recreate that scenario and provide video proof (should be easy enough), this will go a long way towards fixing the issue. One thing to note, though, is that a lot of the "exploit" complaints about 76's PvP aren't actual exploits but rather misunderstandings of how PvP works in this game, which is understandable because PvP in 76 is clunky, unintuitive, and overall just a poor implementation of a bad idea.
---
&gt;That was until one of them, with over 40,000 pounds of Junk I've collected since the B.E.T.A.
---
WHY ARE YOU HOARDING ALL THIS JUNK
---
&gt;Spending 7 Real Life hours scrambling to recover what I could
---
HOW DO YOU HAVE SO MUCH TIME
---
100% and I'm generally with friends but I would also like to dabble in A-holeism from time to time. Enjoy.
---
Seen it once. My friend blew it up before I got a chance to take a screen shot. He had no idea it was a random event.
---
What would be the purpose of rejoining the same server?  Not trying to be rude, just genuinely don't know.  I know it's useful for duping and muling, but what legitimate purpose is there?  I assume loot instanced to you disappear from the server when you do.
---
Ok. Thanks again!
---
blahahaha i cant believe they even ask for that
---
Exactly. Seems there’s some salty people here downvoting lmao. But seriously. If I don’t offer it walk away doesn’t make sense. And if you lose the fight you start don’t cry. I’ve been spanked many  many times here. I pick my wounds and move along lol
---
I’ve gotten some prime attachments to guns, so that’s an improvement I guess. 
---
I had the same. It worked when taking the picture after created my new character, but later in the game it disappeared again. It's rather anniying, spending atoms on something that doesn't work...
---
Same here
---
Damn, too bad they are wrong, you should message them back so that they'd implement it properly.
---
I'm going to have to sit around and mull over how I want to build this. It'll have to be pretty big if I want to have more than just melee fights. Hmm I should think about this while leveling up my next toon.
---
Then you thought wrong twice.
---
I also have had random people trade and request a bunch of aid items and plans so I set a price the the demand I give it all for free lol
---
Agreed, wendigos spawn all the time for me, besides the one at Whitsprings golf club. 
---
A shame. Well, hope you get many customers anyway. Best of luck mate.
---
I have a friend who could use that
---
they all love the forest
---
So tell me your berserker build that would make me choose berserker over bloodied.
---
Omg. I played EQ since beta until like 2008 and never knew about that. lol.
---
I do have fond memories of charming the wolf in West Freeport with my Druid, giving it full level 50 buffs, then zoning to reset it to wander around with level 50 buffs.
---
I guess both of our usernames are fitting at the moment!
---
Thanks for the heads up.
---
Me thinks Bethesda is doing this spring sale in order to entice people into spending all their saved atoms before they come out with the new power armors.  
---
We are done here 
---
Jenkem is around in the here and now dude. 
---
Something tells me itll still be around in 80 years
---
You actually believe an insufferable little twat like Myron would admit to finding a recipe anyway?
---
Put your CAMP next to a junk pile.  I did that a month ago, and now I have more mats than I know what to do with.
---
If I wasnt sick I'd jump on. 
---
Agreed. At least they went with temp bans. You leave something tempting wide open due to bugs and then punish those that indulge. It’s entrapment in my view
---
yeah im done with that..unless ur low-level im just gonna give you the hello emote and run away waving..something normal like ammo is fine but thats about it...i usually just give ppl passing me by like 5 healing salves, couple disease cures, and mentats..but im not initiating trades anyjmore
---
I find pretty much everything I want gets dropped by a quest or an event.
---
FYI, he’s the “Eyed” Piper.
---
There’s also a Mr. Handy that has a pack of Vicious Mongrels following him. I don’t get the reference. 
---
Try nukacrypt. Good luck!
---
We were done from the beginning you twit.
---
I had the "swan" behemoth dissapear but she just teleported back to his sleeping position in the pond, still dead with accessible loot. Maybe your crab teleported back to wherever it spawns?
---
Good one, but this just depresses me. Guess the answer is never. Someone tag that Bethesda chick in his thread.
---
This game is good, but it lacks a point (story) imo. Comparing this with Fallout 4, I love Fallout 4 so much better, it is the best have I've ever played. If Bethesda adds a story, and potentially some Human NPC's and removes some stuff like ranking system with weapons, thisll be an epic game. 
---
Cheers for the heads up. 
---
My favorite part is how you added a TV to your bathroom for entertainment. Ahaha  
---
For real though, nice house!!

---
It hasn't been solved yet, from what I've seen. For reference, though, here are the eight Bravo code pieces for this week:
---
* A-9
---
* C-4
---
* H-6
---
* M-9
---
* O-4
---
* P-4
---
* R-7
---
* Y-7
---
We'll need the keyword (or part of it, at least) to figure out the solution.
---
LOL wait until you figure out that having your hunger drop into red proc Adrenal again but only if it drops into hunger red not thirst and you cant already be in red.... #HangryBuild
---
My gf uses controller on pc for everything she seems fine. I use controller on pc for melee only I prefer it to keyboard and keyboard only when ranging.
---
I use contoller when I'm lazy because there's less keys to remeber what they do lol.
---
Yeah I will make like supply packs and leave them in places around vault 76. Some basic aid food water a gun some ammo and pocket leather armor. Most people that try to trade with me I believe just want to see what gear I have to decide if they want to try and pull me into pvp. I wish that we could set some gear to not show up in trade or have what is equipped not show up
---
tis the mothman.
---
he has cometh
---
he has been in hibernation
---
he shall be wise
---
Bloodied weapons seems to be the meta now. Essentially you wear unyielding armor and choose perks like Radicool, nerd rage and serendipity.
---
Yeah that is what I suspected. Scrapped a bunch of them but still no suppressor. Back to farming screws, thanks. 
---
you found a timelord! find the tardis! 
---
With my first nuke I got to the terminal at the very end and the terminal bugged out and I was just stuck looking at it with no text, completely blank! I re logged only to find out I had to run through the whole thing solo AGAIN only this time I had no ammo and the quest markers were bugged and weren't telling me what do do. I got there in the end though lol.
---
It's called 《context》, and given it, you know what they meant 
---
Took a while but I found one north of white springs hotel inside a building resort room thing. 
---
We should have a **choice** to pvp or not - IT IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS to give us the option for passive mode and still allow other players to kill you. I get that if I take over a workshop or attack someone that should take me out of Passive mode up until a certain time and then I can select that option again. But If I choose passive that should be it unless I do something to remove passive. Having a idiot follow me across the entirety of the map just slashing me with their Vampire Knife while I shove stimpak after stimpak while trying to find time to hit the options button and try to quit game or leave server before I die .. is some insane crap. I mean some of these guys are hitting so hard I am in shock at how much damage they are doing in what little time I have to try and get away or log of .. And Why the heck do I have to log off just to avoid a confrontation that I did not sign up for? 
---
P.S. If I don't want to trade with you, that is my right .. but hey please keep attacking me and acting like a child because I don't feel like stopping to show you what I have and have no desire to trade anything that I have anyways . /Sigh
---
Pc is push to talk. If I remember right the capslock key activates push to talk. Go into you setting to find/change tbe key.
---
[deleted]
---
I haven't had adrenal since the patch but I bet it would be nice with a berserker build when you find yourself in trouble. 
---
20% health Berserker is a glass cannon compared to 20% health Unyielding armor Bloodied.
---
Thank you! There's also a disco ball in there. It might be small bathroom but it's got some personality. 
---
r/thathappened
---
Its fucking weird! I have to close out the game to get it to come back. It makes a few loud clicks before it happens too.
---
I forgot to say but j need at least 4 people to do this. 
---
Good way to trade moron 
---
OOO. Gotcha! Never launched one yet!
---
We would lose. 
---
Yeah I was in power armor, and I was fast traveling from Grafton Steel to Harper's Ferry. It happened fast traveling to Grafton Steel too, that's a good place to kill super mutants.
---
COMMUNITY GUIDELINES to your right: "9.No Witchhunting. Do not ask users to go after other players in game. Do not accuse players of cheating, use Bethesda's official support here. Do not name in shame in general."
---
Rub some dirt in your emotional boo-boo, file it under "lessons learned" and drive on, former Vault-dweller.
---
I think it has something to do with either being in a party (Xbox) or team (game) 
---
This is a joke, right?  
---
(if not, holy shit, great easter egg)
---
Deadite ghoul reskin for the win
---
I really love BOS and I admire their way of living. I surely enjoyed our opinion exchanges as well. Thank you kind Sir, its been an honor to serve you, and remember that lord is always here for your power armor salvation! Ad  Victoriam!
---
As someone who obviously kills other players a lot, is the meta different for PVP action? Do players usually have higher or lower armor than, say, upper level super mutants? Is there a PVE enemy that is similar is damage output or armor? 
---
Damn! Even on different consoles it fucking up...party foul!
---
I have been playing since the first day of BETA and got to that quest on my second session. I killed 9/10 without noticing the quest, and have been trying finish it since 
---
My favourite is when you complete 90% of a quest and then get disconnected and have to start from scratch again 😭
---
&gt;The verb *pique* means to make someone angry or annoyed. But when something *piques* your interest or curiosity, here the verb *pique* just means to arouse, stimulate, or excite.
---
You're too stupid to trade. Get back in your hole.
---
LOL angry much?
---
You know I had not thought about them not scaling. I had this image of kind of doing a Ninja thing 😂. 
---
Its bad but all you can do if yours is the first stop is to block them after they start wrecking.  Still helps over time, at least you won't see these same guys again on other servers in the future.
---
I’ve see a “veterinarian” Mr Handy who has a troop of Cats following him by Deathclaw Island 
---
Everyone will want to trade with u now 
---
I will make sure to spread the salvation to those Brothers in need of service. Soon I'll stop on by for free Excavator shocks for a friend. 
---
I don’t have any other missions...
---
I just did the same mission at lvl 41 - sneaking my way from relay to relay. As I approached the caverns I had four beasties on my tail looking for me..... I am sure they could hear my constant muttering of "please dont see me, please dont see me" on the wind as my overladen arse approached the entrance to the caverns.
---
Into the caverns, and I got stricken with the Blight (the disease that speeds up hunger) - by the time I got into the final chamber I was starving having eaten through all my food stores (I didnt have a disease cure on me). Eating glowing fungus by the bucket load trying to have enough action points. The final battle was me blasting the beast with anything I had left - having consumed all my shotgun shells and .45 ammo
---
It was an awesome ride, and I thought the fun was over until I had to sneak back to Fort Defiance (and those four beasties were outside still hunting for me). I felt real sorry when I saw all four of them sonic blasted a radstag that they happened upon as they looked for me
---
I appreciate it guys lol, just wish I had looked it up before I ran through silo bravo. At least I hadn't put my keycard in yet
---
See the roadmap they presented recently?  They have no intention on abandoning this game, don't listen to the haters.
---
If you tame an animal or creature and later log out of the server, when you log back in does it disappear? 
---
Damn! That sucks so much!
---
You need to max rank the perks of Animal Friend and Wasteland Whisperer
---
Adrenal reaction is it’s own thing. There is no “stacking”. It works with every weapon. Please don’t suggest nerfs to Bethesda either, hasn’t worked out well in the past. 
---
Cool story bro
---
Those who arrive, survive. 
---
Would love to play with you add me highlyunknown14 
---
Possibly.  I've saved up over 1400 Atoms for one of those skins, and may end purchasing another or two.
---
Lmao this is making me get back on starting tonight 
---
As long as it doesn’t die it’s all good! 
---
I'm afraid this is the harm done by the over exaggeration of YouTubers and game "journalists" that only focused on the bad, because they were riding the band wagon.
---
Now, sadly potential players like yourself are missing out on a lot of fun.
---
“Hello Fren, you want some scritches? Here you go littlOOHHHMYGERDMYARM!”
---
Come over to r/fo76FilthyCasuals. Someone on there is trying to get a town started in Helvetia.
---
Did you take a workshop during that session? That will flag you for pvp. Otherwise its only slap damage that people can deal to you until you attack them back.
---
Aaaand here I am late to realize that the date on the pip boy (which was my reference point) never changes, which I didn't notice before.  Sorry.
---
This is sales at its finest 
---
still not working for me on pc
---
I mean, I understand why this is still a problem, but you should have been expecting it. A 2-shot and a bunch of energy weapons? 
---
For comparison I haven’t yet broken a 50cal or Gatling gun on any queen fight (unless it was near-broken already).
---
If your point is that energy guns need durability buffs, I kind of approve although they need to balance Gatling Plasma DPS somehow
---
Ok, I got this up to 76 upvotes,  nobody touch it!!
---
Someone posted a datamined scrapping analysis awhile back.  The lever action suppressor was “very rare.”
---
I don’t know if this is sarcastic or not... but if it is: I don’t know how to price things. I’ve never been good at it and if you wanted something I’d probably end up giving it to you for free anyways. So if you want to come get some free shit? Then find by me. Come and I’ll give you whatever you want.
---
What’s his gt? Let em know CommunistRaptor will pop by with a few plans 
---
Besides this, the "sale" is currently a whopping *2* items...
---
I Have a lot of plans , Found one I did not have, it did not have "known" next to it but as soon as I purchased it .. the top left corner said I bought a "Known" Plan .. I was like WTF ? sure as shit I go into my pip boy and I somehow knew the plan I bought .. is this something that's going on ?
---
Having lived in both WV and near Oak Ridge, it fits perfectly.  TN is WV without coal.  Lorewise, I wonder if they ever revealed the Secret City in the Fallout Universe. 
---
I also love the idea because I just want to come across a ruined Sunsphere full of Pompadour Wigs. 
---
Cool but unlikely this will ever take place.
---
I don't think you accurately understand Filthy Casuals. The rule against complaining doesn't exist because FC players don't see anything wrong with the game or any way to improve it. It exists because complaining can quickly become toxic online and ruin the social and in-game experience of \~simply enjoying a game with others without analyzing the living shit out of it\~.
---
'Better product' is not something a lot of gamers care about. They're not trying to optimize everything in life when it comes to entertainment. That's about you and your own priorities when it comes to gaming, and you're unfairly applying that subjective view to others (which is funny since you describe yourself as objective below).
---
FC  is also not a 'praise bubble'. Praise isn't what it's about. You seem stuck in a mentality where the only important ingredients for a gaming experience involve praise/criticism/change. But that's not what gaming is about to many FC players. It's about FUN. So generally the posts on FC are just people sharing the fun they're having with the game-- cool images, their camp builds, stories of encounters, silly bugs, etc.
---
Final point: There's a difference between inability/unwillingness to see problems, and unwillingness to let problems define your experience and stop you from having fun. FC players are generally the latter, not the 'cult-like' former you suggest.
---
But the price listing was $ 59, as well as a collector’s edition. That makes a DLC somewhat unlikely to me?
---
I'd be surprised if they sell for 1400.
---
They know people will splurge on them like they did the Blackbird. 
---
Played since day 1, have never been able to apply mods to a weapon unless skill matches build requirement..
---
It was a joke about salesmen lol. Should of put the /s I guess. My bad 
---
Aww thank you for the thought!
---
Bloodied and adrenal reaction are practically the exact same perk.....imagine if there was an instigating mutation that stacked with instigating.
---
Bloodied is the only legendary effect that double dips.
---
r/FO76FilthyCasuals is definitely a great place to take this story, less haters hating on you for enjoying something!
---
Alright, sounds like a plan! Anytime, I’m up now for the free special
---
As have I. If you have the mod in your inventory (See: bought from vendor) skill is irrelevant. 
---
I'd expect them to add more and more up until the release of the March DLC.
---
Wasn’t there a runescape scam that worked like this?
---
I want a classic armored vault jumpsuit.
---
Yeah it's fucking sad people who enjoy this game need to have a separate sub because of people like you. It's sometimes getting ridiculous how angry people actually are here and on r/fallout but also on tons of other subs related to gaming when you even mention you like this game.
---
Yes critism is fine, so we have this sub for that.
---
If the critism was forbidden on this sub, now that would be bad. But why do you even care about some separate sub where people who truly enjoy this game just post images, talk about stuff. I don't get it why that makes you angry.
---
I love the idea, but it would require that you ALWAYS have the every single team mate (and always the same teammates) logged in and on a team. I also imagine that there would be all kinds of complications if something happened where one person lost server connection and left the world - even momentarily.
---
It’s a golden idea in theory, but I don’t see how it could work logistically. 
---
Also looking to buy an x01 jet pack on Xbox one, 
---
what the going rate for one? I’ll pay good caps.
---
Pay attention to the diamond and the double diamond markers for quests. I found that in the moment it can be confusing going for the right marker unless I pay attention. This is for item retrieval. 
---
I think it's a random vendor mod. I saw some mods at Watoga Station for it yesterday and have seen it in the production area vendor at the Enclave as well. If I happen to come across one I'll let you know.
---
They appear headed in right direction. their release plan seems solid to make things better and not screw too much up. 
---
This reads like a late 2000's creepypasta. And not one of the good ones.
---
who doesnt love free stuff? :)
---
I got you the first time, but I have still not been able to attach mods *unless* I had my skill loaded for it.
---
Bloodied does not double dip, it’s a legendary effect. Adrenal reaction is a mutation that effects every weapon. Also, I’ve never seen a bloodied weapon do 10k like you were whining about. I run that build and I barely get my power fist up to 1k. 
---
Using the concrete/foundation ramp that's towards the bottom of the floor section. It allows the next foundations to be placed half way between levels.
---
Getting on
---
I don't think so. At least not yet. 
---
Near harpers ferry, like its connected to the town but outskirts
---
Check which quests drop weapons and don't do them until level 50 or they will be lower level
---
Hell, I am not even talking about people duping. The only reward for PvP is grabbing their loot.  Loot left in paper bags that you are expected to pick up. Bethesda used an easy button solution,  like they do in every other situation,  and created a wake of collateral damage. I am starting to think they are the least competent AAA game company. Everything they do is buggy, fucked up, and half-assed.  If they don't fix FO 76 to something that actually "just works", I am done with the company and all their future games. Like Bethesda will be dead to me at best. I will become a  Bethesda troll at worst. 
---
It’s a random encounter. I saw it a few weeks back at a lookout point all the way at the bottom of the map. 
---
The combat shotgun with all perks makes short work of them without too much ammo. But they give underwhelming rewards, the only real reason to fight them is for a slim chance at ultracite/prime plans
---
Turns out I'm an idiot!  I've never noticed the wood extractor in the workshop menu before!  Thanks all!
---
we live in a Society

**BOTTOM TEXT**
---
Me either obviously :)
---
I saw that,it was a nice little easter egg. My game was having a weird bug at the time, though, so the animations lagged while the game ran just fine, so the little parade just kinda teleported forward every two seconds. And... A Scorch Beast was following it? Or it was a bugged Scorch Beast that didn't attack me and was just flying overhead.
---
"Pics or it didn't happen", isn't that the correct response here?
---
Video would be even better, of course....
---
I think that was me
---
You too 😁
---
I believe it, I scraped many dozen to unlock it.
---
I'd like to see it become crossplay compatible. I'd imagine the easiest crossplay to get going would be PC with Xbox and PC with PS4, but finishing up to Ps4 and Xbox crossplay would probably be more difficult. Currently only fortnite and rocket league support that and it's in beta. Would be cool to not have to ignore 2/3s of all market posts because it's the wrong system 
---
What about speed demon and squad maneuvers? I don’t see you complaining about those. Or speed demon and faster reload speed legendary? You’re just complaining to complain dude. 
---
Ivan Drago agrees.
---
You can crank them a bit, my tomahawks are looking a bit over 200 with about 15% health Adrenal Reaction and Nerd rage, but that requires a low health build. Otherwise it's just stuff like Adrenaline and Bloody Mess buffing them- they don't even scale with strength.
---
And given that their range is, 12, and you can't even use them in VATS for headshots.... yeah. Early game they're decent. Late game... eh. Roleplay only, and not very fun roleplay :-/
---
I now want to create a video about this, wonder if they have a bad flute of pure imagination....
---
EDIT: You could actually try it, that might be something too!
---
The counter is I move my camp to the next plot and all is magically repaired
---
Yeah the start was difficult for me but towards the end I had to adjust the difficulty higher because the challenge was gone. Lucky the game allows you to adjust difficulty during the playthrough.
---
Not rare bro common drop at a location I believe 
---
“Because I’m lazy” Me too! Thank you
---
We can kill Ashur before he creates his blasphemy spawn
---
Lets remove all legendary effects while we are at it
---
Some players, depending upon their level , need those mobs to spawn. Everyone can't park missile turrets at Whitesprings and crash nuke parties.
---
Lets remove mutations , weapons &amp; armor also

Maintenance Log 
---
Week of 10/11/77
---
- Shutdown AM-11 'Lotus' following spa incidents.
---
- Install AM-12 'Vera' as replacement. 
---
Also, you'll notice in the spa section one of the rooms is shut down with lights off. I would assume that's where the incident took place. They put a lot of love into this game. 
---
and with that I am now selling them.
---
That would be *really* nice. My friends have it on PC and I have it on PS4. 
---
Do you know where the location is?
---
/u/Ladydevann anything you can share about this? 
---
I'm not complaining. I'm pointing out that after my week without adrenal reaction bloodied is not only still viable but that it is on the same playing field as other legendary effects.
---
Bloodied w/Adrenal is easy mode. Before I could stroll into Whitesprings without power armor and it was a cake walk. Now I can still do it but I sometimes need to jump up on the roof out back to regroup.
---
Then there is no need to cry if everyone is running around in that nasty ass looking underwear 😁
---
No but it is not rare tho if that’s what you wanted to know 
---
Then you don't have the mod in your inventory. The skillcheck is for *creating* the mod, not attaching it. 
---
Been there, done that. It was how we got into the presidential suite before we all got marsupial and jet packs. 
---
Ok, thank you for the info.
---
Map is too small and not enough good areas to allow 6 players to lock up one area with 6 camps worth of turrets, etc.
---
Go claim a workshop.
---
Ok well bethesda support has officaly stated the marine combat helmet is not an exploit item [https://www.reddit.com/user/jchamlin](https://www.reddit.com/user/jchamlin) posted it [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/arsrqg/marine\_armor\_helmets\_oh\_censored/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/arsrqg/marine_armor_helmets_oh_censored/) image [https://i.imgur.com/Ln20atE.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Ln20atE.jpg)
---
3 posts back to back?
---
Tell me again though how I'm crying.... LOL.
---
I'm an idiot I forgot about that perk 
---
They are 4 in total
---
Its useless to argue, someone is always unhappy in online games
---
You can purchase from the white springs vendor in the toy dept. Might have to server hop. 
---
So you’re suggesting the nerf because you don’t want other people to run the build? I’m pretty sure that me being lvl192 with late game gear should have a pretty easy time in whitesprings. Not only that, but I still get overwhelmed by hoards and the SBQ is not an easy fight. Your argument is invalid my guy. 
---
You think me discussing a slight nerf to your game genie build is unsettling, wait until you find out that the adrenal glitch was a test run for exactly what I'm talking about.
---
Lol....git gudder.
---
I'm Level 148 and have never seen it.  I want to though!
---
I PvP and I can't target crouched players with or without a chameleon/stealth boy effect. If I can target them before they crouch it holds, but I don't see it holding if I'm late on hitting Q. 
---
I think your best bet at this point is to move your mules to a new location. If you're being targeted this often, it's likely because they know your CAMP locations. Some other users (u/revertox) also have their camp in a reliable location and I know exactly where to travel to without having to travel through the social menu. And much like you, I do see the same players pretty often, so it's not crazy that you end up in the same server as your griefer "at random."
---
You can do it. 
---
Just need a jet pack and marsupial ;)
---
I think the whole set looks like modified t51b
---
 I kill em' for food. I would kill them with no drop at all, as its just great fun.
---
Is this your first online game? I know new nerfs are coming . They are gonna nerf every meta that people find.
---
Git who now? 
---
Not sure what is meant by tagging. Can you explain for a beginner? Thanks
---
You can do it without the jetpack if you build a set of stairs positioned properly sprint and jump with marsupial. 
---
Slow down there big boy I'm level 170. I'm no spring chicken either.
---
I'm suggesting that for end game raid content they need balance and more variety. They can't design a raid that is too easy for players with Bloodied weapons but impossible for everyone without Bloodied. 
---
These types of games need balance, unfortunately I this isn't Fallout 4.
---
I like what you are thinking. I would like to maybe throw my 2 cents in here if you don’t mind. Instead of A stone, why not just make it A mod that looks like A box and is stored in the mods tab. What if when you deconstruct A legendary item you get the legendary perks as their own mod kits, A one time use. Example, lets say you get A legendary explosive pipe revolver. Nice legendary, garbage gun. So you scrap the gun and get the usual mats, bit also that legendary explosive perk. Now you have 1 chance to put that explosive perk on any compatible weapon. If it fails the mod breaks. That way none can mass produce legendary weapons.
---
It’s a hole that lets you get into the walls and ceiling of the bunker. 
---
Weird someone downvoted your comment. What’s going on on Reddit today?!? 
---
What do you normally charge for excavator calibrated shocks
---
DLC for what? Didn't they say all Fallout 76 content was free? So is this DLC for Fallout 4? Or 3?
---
Next nerf is probably that armor effects dont stack anymore 
---
Smalls cap at 2 and larges at 5 but mine don’t even make that 
---
Actually I was hoping more for a cap based system. Like the casino cave in Legend of Zelda 
---
I think the plans are at the enclave bunker (Whitesprings). You gotta do the enclave quests to get into it though.
---
&gt;!Nothing special up there except for a note written by the nearby corpse!&lt; 
---
Yes i enjoyed the first hour as well.
---
Right on, I'll have to try that.
---
Yes for sure. That was what I was thinking about, with the deconstruction part. Perhaps I never made that part clear as I only talked about the other one.
---
Still kind of pissed I missed that one. Bought the camo set a day before it came out.
---
Another random spawn there (aside from the Charleston traveling vendor) is a responder eyebolt that is speaking in Morse code. It’s translated to text in the captions. 
---
no my collection!
---
Brb with serum 
---
This man is a gentleman and a scholar. All around, he is professional and an expert at what he does. He is not doing this to haggle with others or sit upon a big pile of caps, but to help those who are need of a custom power armor in a wasteland where mods/plans are hard to come by. 
---
He has my highest recommendation.
---
Yeah thats fine
---
That's some Call of Duty level hostage shit right there.
---
Hmmm alright I’ll have to try that with my tse combat later 
---
It's pretty rare. The first time I tried to fight. Second time I just left it alone and repaired after the event ran out.
---
Mmmmm Curry beef.
---
I'm noticing a trend where anybody camping anywhere close to a random encounter, spawn location or rare vendor is instantly a bad guy despite likely not knowing about these encounters. 
---
Soon you won't be "allowed" to camp anywhere on the map at this rate. Can't wait to see "heroic" groups of players wiping out CAMPs near the Overseer's CAMP and getting endless upvotes.
---
&gt;EDIT/ It may be worth a discussion to add in some workbenches closer to Prime.
---
I'd also consider upping weapon durability slightly? Maybe even 20-25%%. With the Scorchbeast Queen as it is I have 3-4 weapons break over the course of the fight. The costs for 5X cards to increase durability is really demanding for what you get, too. My Gatling Plasma breaks after a single reload from 100% durability, and my Gatling Laser crumbles (I have no idea how some people use it the entire fight). Weapon durability is a game mechanic but too many weapons just fall apart over the fight with the queen.
---
Now imagine 6-10 people all battling the queen and their weapons constantly breaking and it leads to some extreme frustration.
---
I can only hope they deliver it, but I've put this game aside until this stuff is out and I'm hesitant to be excited for it when there were so many easy 'Coming in a future patch' things we haven't seen in 6 of them. 
---
nah, they just need to make it so wood armor can drop as a 3 star. Wood armor is awesome for stealth builds
---
Radioactive Cancer Fungus new band name called it!
---
Name checks out
---
A weapon/armor with several mods should however still only give you one "mod back".
---
So it's a luck of the draw which mod you get, and even IF you get any.
---
I wanna know as well. I've noticed multiple posts down voted to hell. 
---
The 76 dev team isnt a real team, so all these, "Wouldn't it be easy if and why not this simple solution of" really does not pertain to people who don't game period. Dead ass taking these guys half a year to even get by simple bug problems. Haven't played since patch 4. Still randomly reading this forum and I cant believe the game still hasn't had a content update.
---
Fucking Magicarp's Splash is more effective than FO76's dev team. 
---
hahahahaha
---
Does anyone provide PA modding services like this for PC players?
---
All 3 star enemies have a *chance* to drop 3 star items. They can be 1-3 stars
---
Maybe just build in a delay timer the person chooses. 3 minutes, 5, 10
---
but did you do it playing "Pure Imagination" cause... it like changes everything.... and I can't confirm but there might be a mole rat with Todd Howards face on it... wait .... that's my Instagram....
---
Considering most armor (and most players) has more damage resistance than energy resistance.....buffing energy could cause an imbalance.
---
I thought there might by loot. That's very disappointing to hear. 
---
What if you could choose between them which one you want? Would that be to op?
---
You suggested a nerf, which will probably happen regardless of your feelings. Nothing needs to be nerfed. There needs to be buffs to certain weapons and fixes to the damage glitches. Bethesda will figure the raids out however they see fit. Also, you were complaining. You’ve been complaining. And resorting to calling me “big boy” as a demeanor shows that you’re probably not mature enough to be sharing your half-wit opinions online in hopes you’re going to get respectable feedback. 
---
Yes, it took a few tries for me!  Luckily I have Bird Bones and Marsupial so it wasn't too terrible, though Marsupial can be more of a hindrance at times... (jumping into the tree branches, over-shooting the platforms)  &gt;!At the top there is a note that relates to the corpse at the base of the tower along with a small bit of loot, gave me a good laugh. (Edit: The small bit of loot was 2 Stimpaks and a couple other average items you might find in a regular box, nothing exciting)!&lt;
---
I was trying to do it without either of those, so I just gave up and never came back. 
---
The time scale might be off for this game, but for most online games the timescale people are wanting is well within most multiplayer games like this time frame. Just because bethesda is piss poor at handling online games doesn't mean we should just accept it.
---
That is why they are getting absolutely slammed by reviews and people are leaving the game in droves. I expect most people are only hanging around now until someone makes private servers for it and then pretty much everyone will move over to private servers. I know I will.
---
For any mods, i do 500 caps if you supply the materials. Otherwise, I have limited stocks and i try hard to keep an inventory of some common mod crafting materials like fluxes, aluminum, adhesive etc. as much as i can while keeping enough stash space for my weapons and armors. For two excavator calibrated shocks, my list price is 2K with legs supplied, or 2.5K with legs that i can craft. I have 20+ intelligence and pieces I create are usually have very high durability and 200% max repair.
---
Fair enough 
---
Try unblocking from the recent players list.
---
Wow, that is a genuinely beautiful home. I wasn't expecting that. Very good work!
---
Honestly I can’t seem to beat her at all. No matter how much ammo and firepower I have I still can’t. We can barely take a quarter of her health. It’s happen to me twice now with different people 
---
I spent over an hour on it before finally finishing it back on beta. 
---
He's just a bot taking his doggos out for walkies. That's it.
---
It would surely be the best option. But as you said, perhaps a bit OP? Heck, maybe even this whole suggestion is a tad OP?
---
if you had 5 only 1 would be producing...the others would just be storage. Yes 1 of each is best for production rate. Sry for the late reply!
---
Nude and fisticuffs FTW
---
I love the mental picture going on here
---
I love PVP, so pardon me if this gets long-winded.
---
Yes, I definitely think there are two different meta to the game right now for PVP and PVE. (This is all build dependent of course.) I have one character (of 3) that actually carries two sets of weapons. For instance, instigating is quite good for most PVE while it blows in PvP.
---
The other main difference is that, for some reason, the devs offset the player and enemy stats. So, most enemies bigger than a mongrel have more hitpoints than a player would. A player will never have over 500 hitpoints (I'm not sure what the max is possible, so I'm just throwing it out there) but it's quite common to find enemies with a lot more.
---
For instance, my characters have anywhere from 195 - 295 hit points (all of them over lvl 50). A level 30 mole miner has 325 hp, a level 22 gutsy has 280, a level 16 super mutant has 300. If you look at max level mobs you're talking up to the 1000+ range. Granted, players can equip much higher resistances than enemies, but all of this changes the meta.
---
As for comparable enemies, no enemy hits like a player does. There are a multitude of high tier weapons both legendary and not that blow away the hardest-hit I have ever taken from a PVE mob.
---
When it comes to armor, it really depends on how you are equipped and how you build, but I have run into players that are comparable to a low-level scorched or mole rat mother all the way up to something like a level 90 deathclaw or scorchbeast. Add on to that the fact that players use stimpacks and chems and it gets hard to compare.
---
The biggest and most exhilarating difference between PVP and PVE in this game is that in PvP you actually have to use your brain to defeat your enemy. I've outsmarted quite a few players that were way stronger than me or had much better guns; I've yet to be outsmarted by a mole miner.
---
Im in 😁
---
Well if theres only A chance succes rate to apply the perk being able to get all perks off A weapon or armor piece might not be as OP
---
Even if you got all 3 perks off something all 3 might fail and break
---
Thanks! Smooth transaction 
---
TALON COMPANAAAAAAAY
---
I get alot of offers from xbox people I'll send em your way if I find one
---
&gt;Not for what other people think it should be. 
---
A polished triple A game that was sold for 60$ at launch?
---
No it was more like Tiny Tim’s “Tiptoe through the tulips” as I tried to hop on the beams and not fall out of the world. Sure, most of the time you’ll land on the bottom floor, but sometimes you can miss...
---
Seriously underrated DLC.  The ghost people were definitely some folks I always avoided engaging as much as possible, mainly due to their mannerisms.
---
The queen's highest resistance is to energy damage. You're using energy weapons. Luck of the draw only procs once per trigger pull, so with heavy weapons if you lay on the trigger non-stop you'll only proc once per 1000 shots on the gatling laser. Meanwhile, every hit degrades your weapon by the same amount. If I had to guess, you're taking all the degradation available but dropping all the chance to mitigate degradation using a weapon class that does the least damage (and thus requires the most shots).
---
F those guys. 
---
Another one asked this question too, if there is I’d like to meet with them as well. We’ve got the PS4 guy here, and there is the mighty XB1 guy, we’re missing the PC for sure. 
---
Found one
---
Sometimes there’s a bobble head.  I got the agility one and it was very fitting
---
I never once complained.
---
I suggested that bloodied + adrenal should not be able to be stacked and I've spent the rest of my time defending myself from a bunch of one shot wonders who are afraid they're going to lose their magical weapons.
---
No it has NOT been up twice.  It was up once and for a day only.
---
I would like an excuse to use some laser weapons. They're just... Useless, and I want to use energy weapons, but I dislike how slow Plasma is.
---
Plus laser weapons look really cool. But the damage is ridiculous. It's weaponised light capable of disintegrating you, it's not a lighter, dangit!
---
After seeing all these feedbacks I feel very lucky to have built such great connections with people from all over the world, and you are no different. My sincere thanks!
---
Oh ok sick
---
yea been there done that. not that much going on in the locations in this game. oh wow another empty building with scorch cuccs and junk. so entertaining. 
---
Good points. I just like the idea of creating something a little bigger lol
---
Maybe change the roofs to something a little more solid with less gaping holes. 
---
IMO you need some people with bloodied builds and TSE guns to kill the queen.
---
True. It probably wouldn't be easily implemented 
---
Again, since played day 1 and am an avid FO fan.. I am not fresh out of the gate kid who does not know how to manage their inventory -something that boggles my mind every time I see people complaining about stash limits and over encumberance; drop that 10k steel and rubber guys or bulk it for a profit!
---
I double checked that I had the mod in my inventory. I double checked I had the right weapon. I double checked I had my shoes on the right feet and that they were tied with bunny ears. It just doesn't work for some people; this has been a bug people have brought up but it never gets much attention because everyone keeps assuming everyone else doesn't know the game as well as they do..
---
There really isn't any "end game" unless you count broken PVP, and a constant repeat of go collect steel, lead, and gunpowder so you can make more ammo to dump into the bullet sponge enemies.
---
I also enjoy the element of a “potential griefer” approaching, very thrilling, is friendly or no, hmm. Like, think about GTA online bad sports lobbies. I never did enough bad to go into one, so never experienced it, but I can imagine those lobbies are a fucking riot. I would not like a bad sport lobby system in Fallout, because the occasional griefer does keep things interesting. Flipside is that you can end up on the receiving end and victimized sometimes, just hop lobbies if it gets bad, or get user names for later revenge.
---
I’ve seen it two or 3 times in the mire, I’ve seen it about as much as I’ve seen the moth man, and I have killed both of them never, anyway wander in the mire  for about an hour and you should see it
---
I had considered that, but the top floor is a Bedroom/Bar in itself and that's the only roof I currently have that allows me to walk around up there. 
---
Well yeah, most of the people still playing are loving the game, because the vast majority of players already left. It is why you end up on empty servers with only 1 or 2 other people for the whole server.
---
I’ve literally read you stating “bloodied is stronger than berserkers” more times than I can count. Then you started name calling (not defending) and you’re still complaining about the “one shots”. I’m done with this conversation dude, can’t argue with the stubborn. 
---
"false sense of fun" lol wut?
---
Saw that too, on the road east of the water park 
---
No sweetroll for a brute to tease you about after its stolen from you? Happy birthday
---
Thanks for the input. Aside from the "assassin" prefix, is there anything else to keep an eye out for? I still feel like I don't totally understand how damage is calculated in this game, relative to damage resistance. Like for PVE, armor piercing is the ultimate prefix (maybe two shot, but I'd imagine that applies to both metas). Does that sill carry weight for PVP? I've obviously never even had a single PVP moment haha. Sorry for all the questions.
---
Thanks for that, most useful info.
---
I mean like, use the roofs that look like ramps on the sides and flat ones on the top of those.
---
You mean, forcing players into deciding if they want to specialize in physical defense or energy, or of they want decent protection from both? Ummm, you do realize that would actually balance the game and add diversity in builds right?
---
Agreed. I kill them just for revenge now, as they kicked my ass when I was under level 50...
---
If you've got $1, you can try out Anthem on PC for 10 hours. Thirteen bucks or so past that can get you a month. It's PVE and pretty fun.  
---
I wouldn't pay full price for it though. The graphics are great, but there's only so much else to the game. I'd honestly put it in the $30-40 range for content. I hope future updates bring more to it.  
---
If you enjoy grinding exp, World of Tanks/Warships may be another two to try out. Takes a minute to learn the games, but they can also be fun. Both free to play, btw.
---
&gt;Don't use the mod. People whacking you are jerks, but it's maybe a  little bit also your fault to open yourself up to that kind of griefing *knowing*  that using the mod can cost you. It's like, if you leave your car door  unlocked you can't really complain about someone stealing your shit.  
---
For Months it was not an issue, last few weeks it seems the worst have come out (or the average people are bored and are finding outlets)  
---
&gt;Ah, that's why. Also, Jesus Christ, *why are you hoarding this junk?!?* Make something. Craft shit. That's what junk is for.
---
Spent months building up so I could craft without then having to spend hours, or days collecting resources, and frequently made PA, or fully upgraded existing armor / PA for new players I ran into...
---
Have "Stockpiles" of materials let me do this at a moments notice without breaking a sweat, different playstyle, but I enjoyed it.
---
The "Black Tuesday" weight nerf put a crimp in my style, but working on finding away around it, aka Perks + Weight reduction gear.
---
&gt;Can you provide video evidence of that happening? Because if you can  prove that players can kill through slap damage, make that proof widely  available, and publicize exactly how to kill players this way, I  guarantee it will force Bethesda to address the issue sooner rather than  later.
---
I don't Stream/Twitch, but honestly take the mutations (If you're on PC I will give them to you) and then let someone with a melee weapon wack on you... You'll see almost instantly after a few swings.
---
It's been documented and reported, the people who know about it and enjoy abusing it frequently cry foul and shout down those commenting / complaining about it.
---
&gt;Again, if you can recreate that scenario and provide video proof (should  be easy enough), this will go a long way towards fixing the issue. One  thing to note, though, is that a lot of the "exploit" complaints about  76's PvP aren't actual exploits but rather misunderstandings of how PvP  works in this game, which is understandable because PvP in 76 is clunky,  unintuitive, and overall just a poor implementation of a bad idea.
---
Again don't stream, besides the fact I don't want to, it would be nearly impossible while running (3) accounts off one PC I'm maxing out my PC's ability.
---
Replicating it is tricky, but if someone wanted to, or the Dev's, the situation is not hard to replicate, just likely tricky on the timing.
---
Both times it's happened have been on already laggy servers (aka Legendaries looted take a minute or more to populate in your inventory)
---
&gt;WHY ARE YOU HOARDING ALL THIS JUNK
---
I had built a network of like minded people, or customers I cut good deals to, who would frequently drop off Legendaries, extra PA, and surplus junk for me to use in helping new players or those down on their luck.
---
From time to time, every day or few, I'd spend a bit of time hunting down either low level players, or "Newer" mid to high levels (You all have run into those 100's who don't really have a clue)...
---
It's allot of fun to make someone's day, replacing their non-Legendary weapons (Happens even at high levels) with non-OP Legendary versions.
---
&gt;HOW DO YOU HAVE SO MUCH TIME
---
Currently off work for a few reasons, most relevant atm recovering from 1st to 3rd degree burns over both arms, hands and chest.
---
Playing '76 was literally physical therapy from the End of November until this past Month when I was cleared by the Burn clinic, preventing the damage skin from turning into shoe leather, and was enough of a distraction I was able to more or less avoid using the prescribed opiate based painkillers and use OTC instead.
---
I mean heck yeah, lasers are the shit
---
&gt;Nor was the bottle case ever advertised as glass. Not once. People who have never purchased anything but captain Morgan's, just assumed it was. 
---
That is incorrect, even Oxhorn, one of the biggest fallout youtubers out there was hugely disappointed by that cheap plastic 3d printed bottle.
---
There's a junk tab.  What more do you want?
---
I still want my idea, which I think is best.  Filters.  When you construct a container in your CAMP, much like you how you can apply a lock on a door/resource extractor/water purifier/etc, you can apply a filter on the container.  It can be a list of filters like:
---
Weapons
---
Armor
---
Food
---
Chems
---
Ammo
---
Junk
---
etc. etc..
---
Once you are out of the construction view when you click on the container, it shows you only the filtered items that are also in your STASH.  Contains same limit, same base, just a filter for us to make it easier to find stuff.  I'd put a ammo box somewhere set to ammo, a cooler for my chems, etc
---
Should be easy for them to implement.
---
I have actually given up on this event entirely. Such a shame. Could really be an awesome fight. 
---
You are incorrect. I have had several mods purchased off of a vendor that required the skill merely to apply the mod. Missile launcher mods especially come to mind. I held on to a targeting computer mod for many levels until I could max out my Gunsmith card rank.
---
Also, you saying “you mad” or “git gudder” to people shows your age. Go to bed kid, it’s past your bedtime. 
---
We’re on Xbox but thanks for the offer. 
---
Instead of a salvaged asaultron head, I want a salvaged Colonel Gutsy Gun. Whatever that automatic is he shoots shreds me. 
---
If you break down a handmade and it doesnt unlock any mods does that mean you have them all? Last one i broke down didn't give any mods but I'm pretty sure i don't have 42 unlocked.
---
Super ugly mismatched armor?  So what, put on an outfit.
---
I like to drop plans and recipes in the overseer's camp stash. 
---
I will buy those rolling pin! 
---
It's not hard to believe, hell even go watch MATN play through of the game, he literally did every single quest in the game and was only level like 65 by the time he completed every single quest, including side quests.
---
So I don't think it is that hard to believe someone did all the main and side quests that quickly.
---
You are likely correct, as another pointed out, but I still think mentioning again the PvP problems is worth the time / headache.
---
I have 1 but I'm on PC unfortunately
---
They only sit at your camp for now, not as exciting as you might be hoping
---
Sorry to burst your bubble, but you need the skill to _attach_ the mod, too.
---
You can't block them if they remain crouched the whole time, it's not on the content menu when interacting with them in 1st/3rd person, and they don't show up on the map, especially the non-wanted Teammates hiding in the wings waiting for you to make the mistake of responding.
---
Quick question any reason to keep non-level-50 legandaries for that vendor that is coming with the new content? Hitting capacity a bit, may have to do a culling.
---
The black diamond ,I used for a very long time
---
From what I have read of other games, Sony is still not playing nice.
---
&gt;I really hope they stick with this game, let it grow and improve other the years.  
---
I want to know where people seem to get the idea that some mouthy neckbeards crying online will make a AAA company "give up" on a game they would have spent several years and probably millions of dollars making. Especially when its clear that there is a huge number of people that play the game, even the ones crying about it are still playing it
---
Yes. A Fallout YouTuber. Not an liquor YouTuber.
---
If you've purchased any special edition liquors, or frequently buy more expensive spirits, it came as no surprise that it was not a custom glass bottle. 
---
Again it was never advertised as a custom glass bottle. 
---
At it's price point I fully expected a case or a shell. 
---
Near Point Pleasant can't hurt. Nice scenery, access to low level players who can gawk at your church.
---
Either that or someplace in the Mire, a real creepy zone
---
No he knew the prices because 1 bullet is more than a cap and he gave him 1200 so that’s well over 800 he was just being greedy...
---
Thanks I'll look into doing that next time I'm on! 
---
Next time bring some substance to the conversation.
---
Bloodied is way OP......change my mind.
---
Pretty much this.  I hunt high levels exclusively and a 330 is an easy payday.  There's some good solutions here about having a fast travel panic room, crouching when fast travelling, stashing your junk, etc.  Do that and you'll avoid 90% of people like me.  I will say that the legendary character respec would solve the high level problem and give you that well-needed buff as well 
---
There are all sorts of issues with hostile flagging. If one of your team members is wanted and you or anyone on their team does damage to that team member, all of you are flagged as hostile to them and you will be unable to fast travel until you all re-log.
---
You could probably use this information to your advantage and make their grief come at a cost. Still a minor one, but possibly the best you can do
---
Nice!!!!!
---
If they allow you to actually see the armor when inspecting the chassis it would solve the whole problem
---
Yes they did make a comment about it. The BGS account commented on this sub after the V-Day inside the vault they said:
---
&gt;We are working on a larger comprehensive balance patch that includes fixes to durability and utility of Energy Weapons. We expect this patch to be available in March, but will be able to provide specific timing a little later.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aqlcu2/inside\_the\_vault\_february\_14\_2019/eggzcy9](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aqlcu2/inside_the_vault_february_14_2019/eggzcy9)
---
to which I said:
---
&gt;What's the rationale for saving the balance changes for 1 big update? I'm concerned that a balance update will come out, overtune somethings while nerfing others, then it taking a while for another balance patch to drop. Why not isolate the impacts of the balance changes with smaller hotfixes to see if what comes out is actually desired.
---
And no reply. These big balance patches never work in games like this and it just becomes something else that's OP for the next 2 months. Really hope they adjust...
---
Nice!!!!’ Posted in the wrong bit, only been on here a few days lol 
---
Any hope for Ultracite calibrated shocks?
---
I'm xbox. I'm off for the night but tomorrow evening I can transfer you guys like 1000 or a bit more to replace what u lost 
---
Is that there scorchbeast cavern there? It killed me twice during that mission, barely it was close. Then I said f it upon my 3rd try, popped a stealth boy, and snuck behind it to activate objective, and logged off as I became detected. There were two scorchbeasts flying outside entrance too, pretty hostile area
---
I've had this game for a week and haven't experienced any issues whatsoever. Maybe a bit of lag at times but it's been smooth overall for me. 
---
I wonder why they removed radios, I had one in my CAMP, back in BETA, and then it disappeared.
---
Same with those songs. Appalachia Radio had heaps of songs, but now it feels more repetitive than Radio New Vegas.
---
A 5*star Gary, from that one vault in DC
---
Which item was it that was removed from the game in patch 6? I've not been able to figure it out and I have not seen any posts that actually identify the item.
---
That’s glass cavern you’re talking about. Lucky hole mine is what I’m taking about. It’s got a weird sleeping monster hidden in it
---
Finally got them from technical data turn in quest. They are indeed and outfit and cannot have armor on top. They also change size if you wear underarmour with them. 
---
Lol but you want me to link you to the jetpack guy?
---
Oh definitely, calibrated shocks, optimized bracers, reactive plates, you name it, here let me show you what i can do:
---

Electrically charged and isotape can trigger pvp! Only if u r not in Pacifist mode. 
---
OP has it off. His fault for not keeping it on if he doesn't want to pvp.
---
I know this because I do it, and I play a fuck ton of pvp. (Not griefing) straight up pvp.
---
Sometimes, if someone steals my junk when I die by farming. The first thing I do is melee to check if they have those mutations, and if they do and they are not in Pacifist mode, I will kill them for my junk.
---
I know pacifist mode doesn't trigger pvp, because other players try to do it to me, and if I want to prevent, i just turn pacifist mode on. 
---
*Eyy, another year! * It's your **4th Cakeday** excusememr! ^(hug)
---
It’s I retesting being in the Pittsburgh area and all the slightly related things. Like the Ohio river. I think the game map has a Interstate 59 instead of Interstate 79. I hadn’t double checked on where or how route 65 runs through WV though it was cool to see that connection. Morgantown is only about an hour from Pittsburgh. Which makes me wonder how far Point Pleasant and Charleston actually are from Morgantown. Can’t imagine they are walking or running distance from one another. 
---
All this attention and it still exists... sigh. Banfunsda is not keeping up with the curve here!
---
Bethesda, Bethesda never changes. And they are never wrong. "It just works!"
---
Awesome. I’m at work now, but I will try to check materials when I get home to see if I have enough to make them. 
---
Seems to be stealthed, still looking...
---
If you've watched much of Oxhorn you would know he actually IS a liquor aficionado, and cigars as well. So your point about him not being a liqour youtuber is incorrect, he literally has a liverstream called "scotch &amp; smokerings" where he drinks and smokes cigars. 
---
Not sure about drop in fps but the 1-2 second freezes have been there since day 1 for me and a mate. Sometimes after a patch/update they go away and reappear with the next patch/update.
---
Remember if you actually manage to kill it, Maybe it will regenerate into an NPC!
---
It is very playable at up to 24 characters per server.
---
I'm not bashing, just pointing out architecture limitations to a fully immersive, glitch free experience. 
---
Crtical hit enhancing perk cards, Eagle eyes mutation, rifle damage/armor pen perk cards, a rifle with crit damage increase etc.
---
If you could that would be epic, thank you 
---
Maybe we need an “I am confused” stickied thread. Cause there is a post almost every day on this topic. You joined late and skipped over all the bugs that got fixed. Good for you confused person 
---
Do you have ig I dont know how to link it in reddit
---
thank you for being the loud cover that does zero damage so that the 2 sneak/crit/vats people that show up can kill it with 150 headshots.
---
Ha...that happened to me yesterday. Though I'm only level 30,  a level 16 waved and was milling around while I was at a work bench at the overseer's camp. (Which I was there crafting weapons to give away) So next thing I know, I'm being shot at. Again, I was crafting so was overweight when I was trying to just take off and not engage. Then I said screw it...I'll kick your ass...well I ran out of bullets with my good gun, then for some odd reason...all my gun dmg levels went down to shit. Don't know if I ate the wrong thing, caught a disease or he did something. But he killed me, then once I respawned I thought WTH, I'll take revenge (which is not how I play) and when I respawned...he was nowhere to be seen. I found him a bit later. Fast traveled to his location...but he took off again. Oh well, I'm a peaceful dude and don't like PVP....so guess that was a lesson for me.
---
See here's the difference between your comment and the OP's post. 
---
The OP's early impressions of the game as a player just starting now is interesting to look at vs launch impressions. 
---
Even if it's not very detailed. Seeing the balance of "I just started, I love it" vs "I just started, I'm bored" compared to closer to launch is still interesting. 
---
Your comment? Added nothing. 
---
"Lolz, cazual. Just WaIt. Idiot. Go read all the posts that have given me an opinion to blindly follow. Idiot." 
---
And yes. You have the right to dislike something. That, however, does not automatically make your opinion on why that's the case interesting, of value, wanted, or constructive. 
---
You may notice other redditors in this comment section, pointed out issues still in the game, or some of it's flaws. In a constructive manner. 
---
Yours had zero redeemable qualities. It was not a discussion comment. It was a "You're wrong, you just don't know it yet" comment. 
---
Ok stupid question time, what’s ig? Lol
---
He could have been using a bloodied weapon with unyielding armor. 
---
Lol your good but instagram
---
keep in mind these low levels might be just alts for experienced players with may 250 levels on their main..when higher levels want to act funny around me im like nah not a good idea
---
Doesn't Ashur's kid hold the key to curing the Trog contagion?
---
Or the bonus of lower health more damage resist 
---
It can be killed with Critical VATS hits. When it dies, the dog turns into a regular sized corpse, somewhere. occasionally walking the mansion side of the lake road, a whole pack will spawn like that.
---
Hey do you have the pew plan 
---
Well I could amplify what problems I and other people had with the game, but that might dampen your enjoyment and why would anyone want that?
---
I'm glad you're enjoying the game and I hope you continue to!
---
That seems so obvious now lol. I don’t unfortunately. Do you know their gamer tag? Mine’s pandageddon666 .
---
Pop som crit chem, bobblehead and food. Just to be sure hehe.
---
Iam trying to find those so like I can make it a little bit more creepy
---
That could explain his immense damage output but the complete damage block from my combat rifle is really weird. While I have all the rifleman perks maxed. +tank killer max points.
---
It was rather disappointing as I expected me to shred him to bits.
---
Maybe include the idea for tower-defense style events centered on the towns. I'd hit that.
---
As I constantly air strike any camp outside the backdoor of whitesprings I am certain I have to be on a couple of those lists for revenge. Lol
---
well that´s what happen when you dont play a true fallout game since its based on mad max with supermutants , deathclaws , ferals and political factions trying to take power on what is left in the world.
---
as a post apocalyptic game this one does a pretty good job at not doing it.
---
he could be mutated, he could have an AA gun that would rip through you like butter. Or even, however unlikely be rocking Serendipity (open at lv5) Born Survivor (open at Lv3), and maybe some unyeilding gear and mutations like Adrenal Reaction, Scaly skin, and others might come into play. 
---
Then still how was he able to completely block my damage. I mentioned in a previous comment that I have all rifleman perks maxed + max tank killer. 
---
Really weird to see a way lower level counter it so easy.
---
In the past month and a half the game has gotten fixed.
---
I quit in early January and came back last week and is definitely much more stable.
---
I dunno if they tweaked the legendary tables too but I am getting way better drops now than I was.
---
i had someone tell me "your weak lol. enjoy ban hammer" after the first time I took a workshop from someone. (Typically I take unclaimed spots but he had Poseidon Power Plant and I play with some other Enclave fans and my role requires me to deal with nuclear sites like the plants and silos.) He tried to fight us a few times and eventually quit and sent the message.
---
I'm also suspicious he put a hit out on me because  very shortly afterward I had another guy just wreck me and a friend who had helped me defent the plant. We gave up the workshop and then he followed us around to the other ones we had. I just had to log off after a while.
---
&gt;or fully upgraded existing armor / PA for new players I ran into...
---
&gt;It's allot of fun to make someone's day, replacing their non-Legendary weapons (Happens even at high levels) with non-OP Legendary versions.
---
Okay, that sounds like you're a legitimately good person. I hope you continue to heal well. Godspeed!
---
Giokiwi
---
What exactly is an AA gun?
---
Lower health higher damage resist armor 
---
Warframe is a really good game one that you can play for hours the microtransactions are fair 
---
The game is very fast paced I suggest you give it a shot
---
And unlike Fallout 76 this game ACTULLY WORKS
---
There was a huge circlejerk on hating this game. Lots of it came from r/fallout and lots of it came from that “Fallout 76 is a lie” video where the guy took everything out of context and purposely used the worst clips.
---
I did a full analysis on how he purposely fucked up and if you want I’ll find it but yeah.
---
Game is pretty good.
---
If I learned one thing spending half the game in Whitesprings, I know that's probably gonna get shot down.
---
What the fuck are you on about? Literally dozens of online multiplayer games handle all that data, for more players per server/instance/shard, without the kind of chronic latency/stability issues we see in 76. And they, too, do it cross-platform.
---
That would be great, but a little redundant because you can change your appearance anytime via the pipboy. 
---
"Excavator with Motivator Torso and Calibrated Shocks" = "Stretchy Pants".
---
But only if you attack its weak point.
---

---
little late but \*where\* do you get the copies on pc if youre an xbox player? are they through email or are they in the microsoft store?
---
he just did. [www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jye0qxKOF4Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jye0qxKOF4Y)
---
It’s fine it was on his lower lvl character I gave him most of mine shortly after I was just ranting the bs of people on the game
---
It has a gas mask but the mask isn’t functional....???
---
Rats.. I wanted to go to Narnia though.
---
I had to downvote to return it to 76. Sorry original commentator, it had to be maintained your karma gain is capped lols
---
Really? I know you can change it from the menu but can you tell me how to do it from the pip boy?
---
Considering it is only 10 lbs you probably have more strength outside of your PA than you do when inside. When you are inside your PA you lose all of your normal armor bonuses until you leave the PA and PA only gives you additional strength up to 10 or 12 I can't remember. So PA offers a strength bonus to low strength players but is just basically armor for those with high strength. 
---
Nah, but you can buy it at Whitesprings, I think. It's not too expensive.
---
Thanks, won't claim to be good, but do enjoy that bit quite a bit.
---
any way to avoid? havnt killed the queen in a while.
---
Really well I don’t really have caps though hmm my bank you though 
---

---
Ultracite is x-01?
---
Main Menu probably then. It'd be cool to have an interactive mirror but I don't see it happening tbh. 
---
Try it with a new character. Achievements in beta didn’t carry over. So I started a new character and got them. Not sure if this also applies to challenges but worth a shot
---
maybe, it’s good to suggest tho
---
A melee and a sniper are a great team for silos.
---
Ha okiedoke. Yeah luckily I've only ran into a few not so nice players. The game seems to echo life quite closely.
