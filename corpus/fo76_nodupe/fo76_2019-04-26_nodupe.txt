No.
---
---
---
Thanks, I appreciate the information.
---
More like did he event get wanted?
---
&gt;when I make a mistake. 
---

---
So, all the time then (j/k). Melee have excess stims too. Almost all end game characters do (maybe not revenant builds that are trigger happy about self rezzing for extra damage.. i.e. intentionally dying). 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
\&gt;  no understanding of sight lines and aren't listening to the sounds of  the enemies then yeah, you are gonna have a bad time of it. 
---
Not at all, cause heavy dakka / tesla builds just kill everything and not worry about enemy sounds. 
---
That said, melee is still significantly easier/less risky than ranged. Not always faster at clearing mobs, but significantly easier to gear up for and takes risk and damage.
---
Like don't be harshing on the idea of participation trophys, man.
---
It's just annoying because it was my first atomic shop item and I like wearing it and every time I put it on its glitched
---
I have no idea, but why not find a player to offload the excess ammo on? Since it doesn't affect your playstyle, you'll be helping someone out and opening up space in your stash while simultaneously making sure nothing bad happens. If you keep 1000 ammo of each you don't plan on using unless you get a good weapon for it, you'll be fine.
---
Yep!
---
Like the others said.
---
Murder isn't a thing anymore. 
---
Soon buildings can't be damaged either.
---
I was just about to post about this I found one during some event in Harper's ferry
---
Thanks!
---
&gt;Fighting a diseased enemy in melee, 
---
And actually beneficial if you can run the plague walker mutation. Honestly most diseases have trivial negative effects that can basically be ignored. Oh take more rad damage or limb damage... Yeahh... Don't care.
---
Don’t know why I’m showing offline. I’m here.
---
Thanks!  
---
Sentinel has the same issue, I'll add the note when back at my desk, and if you stumble upon the comment let me know!
---
Shotgun/heavy weapon and melee is  a iffy build combo, because they both require str perks. You're either going to go half way with both, or spend way to much time swapping cards out. 
---
You can do a epic melee build+ rifle for backup way easier.
---
I was so happy to read this, the backpacks seem really cool and I was going to be disappointed if I couldn’t wear one under PA

Strange. What’s your gt. I’ll send an invite.
---
No the only person I know banned for ammo was duping ultracite ammo and tried to say he wasn't but no way to get that much flux in the amount of time he did
---
I played STALKER for the first time a couple years ago, rock solid and fucking amazing game.
---
Probably multiple teams.
---
Bethesda makes better games. You can't just single out 76 as an example, while listing several of theirs. Ubisoft has released awful games, and is generally shit.
---
I started a new toon last time they did this and got it to level 17 in a couple of hours. The double stacked bonus is no joke.
---
They did but I think it would be a cheaper way to save food than have a fridge.
---
You don't need sentinel gear at all. Troubleshooter armor is actually significantly easier to get, but also not required. 
---
Most end game players (100-150+) could solo the sheepsquatch, if they're not pure glass cannon build AND decide to retain their radiation during the fight.
---
Also, got any 5.56? I'll but it if Xbox
---
Also another thing I forgot: legendary auto grenade launchers don't show prefixes in the name. It always just shows up as "Auto Grenade Launcher" with a legendary star. That's not too bad now that we can sort names, but that means in trading or at a vendor you can't tell what effect it has without taking the time to examine it, which is not possible when trading with a player.
---
Unless you play on survival, that can't happen. Even if it could, most players are *just like you* and don't want to PvP.
---
Choose carefully, although i think most people here are fine. Are you on Xbox?
---
It would I find jars everywhere. Only cost a jar and maybe vegetable starch that would be cool.
---
Yes
---
Yeah that guy's a fool. Full troubleshooter's set is quite readily obtainable by everyone, but still not necessary to solo (nor necessary to solo) the sheepsquatch.
---
Im not sure you get my point. All im saying is he shld make a generic tldr of his view and copy paste it to counter misconceptions about his ban. Then thrs no need for even your 4 day defense argument. 
---
And you shldnt be throwing insults around, it makes you less credible and also less likely for someone to be convinced. 
---
I thought you were mistaken because you said "once again", and that was the first time you told me to look at your post history. 
---
I have been followed his postings too since im curious on how it ends. I know what he has been facing, that's why i suggested what i suggested. 
---
Although i do not believe both him and bethesda side just yet. Thrs tons of uncertainty. Much info lies with bethesda which is not available to us, but bethesda has a reputation for messups. So it could be that it is bethesda that made a mistake based on their reputation. Personally i am inclined to believe bethesda messed up. But this would be irrational, since thr is no sure way to know because of the mentioned uncertainties. This applies for those supporting bethesda wholeheartedly too.
---
Yep, trying to do it solo is basically asking to fail. What's better is when the game decides to spawn an Annihilator Sentry Bot MkII on the road and it melts the Brahmin.

I agree, I run a bloodied super sledge build. I just run through the silo and one hit everything, takes aout 20 min then i am finished and I used maby 2-4 Stimpacks

Even though I've only looked at that area like once or twice, I agree.

dont. explosive weapons dont damage frendly targets.

Ahhhh - of course. That is likely it. the other options would assume that you knew to look for someone. They didn't know I was coming. If I was giving off a purple glow however...

I kind of wondered that I'll give it a try thank you.
---
You don’t remain “invisible” to ingame creatures when you move, your stealth(“sneak”) skill is just higher than their perception. Players will literally just see you if you move, it’s pretty much all visual for players, and you become visible if you move.
---
This right here is the best advice.
---
How fitting, then, that yesterday I had started wearing my Space Suit and Tinfoil Hat... o\_0   
---
*\*cue X-Files theme\**
---
Would indeed be nifty if we got Zetans! I mean, it'd only make sense on account of the Alien Blaster already being in game.
---
I mean, that's assuming the Flatwoods Monster ***isn't*** some form of Zetan. A scout, for example, whereas the Zetans we're familiar with 200+ years later, are more the scientists that come later. (Though in hind-sight --no probe-pun intended-- this wouldn't really track for Fallout given Mothership Zeta had all sorts of abductees from various time periods in human civilization. A fun thought, either way! heh)
---
Just re-inventoried my stash and I lost a lot of plans. 22 to be exact including a shielded BOS plan. A bunch of ammo, 7 fusion cores, and stims.
---
Have an upvote.  You helped me get a daily.
---
I have more than enough just from selling unwanted grenades and chems.
---
Sadly the only one available is the tactical helm
---
Dang I was all hyped up.
---
Thanks. I feel naked now :)
---
Yea that would be nice an actual Safe Zone. 
---
A group did that to me and i was out of caps by the seconed spawn so i kept spawning. And asked about why they were doing it. All i got was basically they had nothing better to do. I know its bad but i tell people like that to go play Apex or CoD cause they be wreckin the game.
---
I feel ya. Marine armor is one of my fav and without the helmet it just feels incomplete.
---
But, Bethesda has replied to several emails that it wasn't meant to be obtainable in game. (Not sure if they mean at all or yet).
---
If you notice, all pics have it with damage resistance just like fo4 but no mask in 76 does... That's a sign it wasn't meant to be out yet... Not adjusted.
---
They allowed PC players to keep the ones they got from the dev room but removed the stats from it so it's just cosmetic now.... Not sure if that's permanent or just until it's released in game.
---
I've been watching everyday since release hoping to see it added but no luck yet.
---
Uranium Fever and just clearing Blackwater Mine. The vendor is close enough to make the walk overencumbered fairly quick.
---
Are these supposed to be rare.?  
---
I killed a level 50 today, wasn’t that difficult.  With a group we took down a higher level one.
---
+karma
---
Chems are good as far as weight vs caps.
---
Uranium Fever is great, Westek. Most good farm spots
---
Had it on a Western Revolver, was pretty funny.

---
They sometime appear in vendors. Players sell them occasionally .
---
Usually a drop.
---
I'm fairly certain that durability is per hit based, which includes per pellet since each hit counts seperately for shotguns. TS and explosive weapons tend to hit more targets. 
---
Did you test vs a wall or actual enemies? . . ah SM actual enemies. SM's are less likely to cluster up, but yes I believe you'll lose durability more this way.
---
Luck of the Draw is a godsend for semiauto weapon durability and multi hit durability, but terrible for benchmarking. 
---
\&gt; shotgun deals roughly twice the damage per shot compared to the other 2 guns and that justifies that it should degrade faster 
---
Amongst other perks with it. . . like lower weight with shotty perks and enforcer stagger. I feel like shotties are more or less balanced. Pistols (especially energy variety) seem to need some love.
---
I'd settle for better legendary drops.
---
I think he intentionally loaded as many mods as he could to make it crash? I agree 💯 STALKER is amazing stuff
---
I agree
---
Should be a mission. Take a picture with the new camera, and enter the info into a terminal in the bunker. Could be like the "wasteland survival guide" mission from fallout 3.
---
Ah
---
💯
---
I honestly just run through the silo and only fight the last section, unless I feel like blowing stuff up for fun.
---
No! Do not Pokemon Go me.
---
If you still need one let me know! May have a spare in my stash. I'm on PC too.
---
Its definitely a Zetan examining its corpse closely basically confirms it
---
There’s other more traditional Zetans in the game files that are currently unused and those are what the game considers ‘aliens’, so we’ll almost definitely be seeing them eventually
---
Serums or being a good pvper
---
Hey I’m down man! I might be able to find something to trade you.
---
I don’t think they exist outside of the legendary loot pool. Don’t think I’ve ever seen a regular one.
---
By that argument there was already suffieciently existing capability to not bother with junk ever at all.  One could invest solely in damage mitigation perks and unarmed focus to the point that you could complete the game without ever needing to repair anything since you wear no armor and have only fists and stealth.  Your assertion is alarmist because it knowingly distorts the reality of even what you have admitted by implying that junk is now something no one needs regardless of playstlye etc (since melee players with perfect roll gear and no need or want for a camp are an extremely small number of players and new players instantly fail the criteria of not having perfect roll gear and therefore at least need junk for mods).  I'd argue that number is likely the same as unarmored pugilists that have no need for a camp.
---
Saying no one needs junk is alarmist and absurd.  You didn't say this could allow people to make a build that would allow them to not need junk for repairs.  You said no one needs junk (implying that if people play a build that needs ammo or want to change their camp etc as their chosen priorities, then they have no need of junk anymore).  That you refuse to admit that your claims were clearly misrepresented while saying even more ridiculous statements (you already never have to build an armor or weapons bench, they are all over the place) makes it feel less and less like you really have played much of the game despite your claim otherwise.

It's not the Sheepsquatch gauntlet but I think it's something like "the bear ?" I heard from somewhere, forgot what the last part was. Maybe glove or jaw glove. Looks cool but it's not here yet, probably comes with the pioneer scouts update cause you know, they're pioneer scouts. Ultimate badasses.

You get these radiant-style quests to retrieve items from dungeons from notes you find on random encounters. Every single one is crap, I don’t know who put them in the game, if it was an actual level-appropriate legendary item it might be worthwhile, but they’re generic and often low level junk.
---
Take the holo marked w a diamond.
---
I thought he was gonna shit on it loads and have a laugh, but wow its a serious one. I always thought the drill was a pile of crap
---
It's a quest item. You cannot buy it, sell it, trade it, or drop it.
---
That's what I expected too! I'm now convinced that Captainoob could single-handedly wipe out West Tek with a pocket knife.
---
I really think they need to make it where when doing a 1:1 trade if the other party doesn’t put up the trade they can’t take your stuff. If you both offer up the trade properly then you can confirm and it auto swaps items
---
I have plague rider on my ultracite and excavator. Both look identical except for their stats.
---
I think it's a good idea - the excavator always looked too clumsy ( though very handy ).
---
Um, no. 
---
You're not going to be clearing content naked with your fists, I'm sorry. You still have to play the game. 
---
You're pushing the goalposts into the realm of the absurd to support your point here. I don't think there is any reason to continue with this argument honestly.
---
Correct.  And since my only other option is to talk, I don't communicate at all in FO76 except for the very rare emote.
---
I'd tell you, but then I'd have to kill you
---
They can always do what Fallout Shelter does. Every seven days you log (doesn't have to be consecutive) you get a lunchbox. Though in this case I guess atoms work
---
Train stations should be safe zones. Nothing worse than being killed while trying to sell your stuff.
---
Here, have my downvote, I love Ubisoft and love AC in particular but you can’t compare multiple Ubisoft to one Bethesda, take Skyrim or fo3,fo4 or foNV, every single one of those games has higher ratings, won more awards and is generally better then pretty much every AC game

My friend bought 2 from athe Whitesprings Train Station vendor and it said “Broken ProSnap Deluxe Camera” they tried to repair or modify it but it says “upgrades none available” I seen this for myself

it’s a random world event that triggers a new quest in the game
---
When talking about "Classical" music remember that the compositions are in the public domain, but not the performances nor the recordings.

Still the classical radio should also get some love.

Maybe they could sell new radios in the Atom Shop? Or radio packs
---
I think you just inspired my wife with a new goal for herself. =)

Damn world is full! 🤦

Probably but we will have the ability to mark our camps on map for others to come, i hope they consider them as a way to teleport to them, too.
---
Sneaky One Shot Builds are the only thing that you will ''not'' see in Survival Mode, if you get what i mean by that.
---
I'll be away the entire time RIP me
---
That's a different item. You cannot buy the "camera" that's required for the quest and atom challenges. You have to grab it off the tourist's body.

Eh idk..full afk systems put a bad taste in my mouth. Hopefully you'd at least have to press a button to reel in the fish

Still the title might be somewhat misleading because running the silo is part of launching a nuke

It's just a cosmetic that increases carry weight. It's not going to make drops function any differently.
---
Well my friend was able to sell one of the cameras to another friend for 62 caps and the second friend showed me they couldn’t modify nor repair it...
---
Take your tinfoil hat dweller keep abusing of chems and stay away from radiation ...
---
Stay at C.A.M.P and rest ... lol
---
At least we have the ability to jump server if the spot is taken now :)
---
The reward was the older fallout games
---
I hope you are at least level 50 before you complete this quest.  This quest gives, to me, one of the best weapons in the game and it is leveled based on when you complete the quest.   If you are completing too early then you are going to get a weaker version than the max.  (I don't remember if the max is level 45 or level 50)
---
And did it start the Bucket List quest?
---
I used to have my camp there, very quiet place, i loved it.
---
Nope In fact we are hunting for the tourist body right now but it isn’t spawning anywhere
---
Players
---
This destroys so many transactions due to no comms half the time. Please introduce the inspect button.
---
I could see where you came from there but I think it's a bear jaw weapon whereas the new clubs and quills were Sheepsquatch items
---
I've bought a number of serums from jchamlin and can wholeheartedly recommend him.   He's a good guy.
---
Like I said, that is a different camera. The one you need is a quest item. It CANNOT be bought from a vendor or traded between players.
---
❌* STILL HERE * ❌
---
I basically answered that question by saying how I got it. Duh. It’s not a drop it’s a plan. Put two and two together
---
 Well I use Combat Knives but a good Pocket Knife could work. ;)
---
&gt; Yeah I think the ESO model is nice...can make the call on whether to log in religiously or just pick up a few bonuses when you'd regularly log in.
---
[GW2 model](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Login_rewards) is even better imho. Login rewards doesn't depend on which day you log in, but on how many days *you* logged in, fully ignoring days where you didn't. If I log in tomorrow or in a week, I'll get the exact same reward. And after logging in 28 days in total I'll get the "monthly" big reward, no matter if it took me a month or a year to have those 28 days.
---
The condition damage scaling tables suggest that shotguns should be losing condition slower than the 50cal or handmade, so the pellet theory is plausible. 
---
There's no direct effect from legendary abilities on condition loss in the ESM, but if the pellet count matters, a TS handmade should lose condition much faster than an AA handmade, because the extra projectile from TS is handled in the same way.
---
I'm close to lvl 100 and have only ever used power armor for nuke zones and jumping off of cliffs.

Xbox..too bad because I would so go with you. I hate hearing about things like this happening but I thought they said that camps were protected just like we are. Hmmm.

I don't think the blackbird came back at all. A few of the Christmas skins and stuff went but some are still in the shop

When vendors are capped, fully upgrade reactor sites. 100 caps per reactor + 20 to clear out workshop area. Also, 2 of the 3 often have technical data(40 caps minus travel expenses).

Getting stuck in a crafting bench can be fixed by fast travelling. At least that's the case on PC.

Haha, at that point it's not a cylinder anymore, it's a drum magazine!

No, you are the one who keeps moving them by blatantly ignoring your own initial comments and claiming entirely new concerns about game economy and what is possible (as opposed to your initial claims that junk was now rendered irrelevant without any commentary about if one ignores camps, mods, ammo and plays only melee thus indicating that commentary to be true for everyone).
---
I am actually certain you could complete the game as a monk style character (I never said it would be easy, I said possible).  Even nuke zones would be workable with a hazmat suit (and they are easily acquired so no need to repair them, just get multiple).  That being said, if you wish to complete every quest in the game you will still have to build a camp once at least (and build a weapon and armor once).  Though that is true for everyone that bothers to do the quests since they are quest goals at the begining of the game.  Seriously, look into the mitigation perks and no armor with fists isn't as unreasonable as you presume.
---
"I'm scared to play because I'm worried Bethesda will delete my TSE"
---
Not even close, my man.
---
Is it like a random encounter?
---
+1 I deal with this regularly.
---
Any of you guys find this interesting? I certainly did.
---
It seems to be per hit based since durability didn't went down when hitting a wall, that would also explain why in this case shotguns seem to deteriorate faster since apparently each pellet is counting as a ''hit'' so if shotguns are firing multiple pellets per shot then maybe each one of those pellets that actually hit a target is reducing the gun durability and that might not be intended. 
---
Maybe someone could test using a normal harpoon gun and one using flechette mod to see if that has any effect on how fast it degrades, but it might also be coded differently for shotguns since the base weapon fires pellets and it doesn't obtains them via a mod.
---
Find anything?
---
never hurts to ask ;)

One of my mules is sitting on a growing pile of nearly 2500 pounds of 2/3* legendaries.

i was able to see custom name for a split second on laggy server, but then it changes for real name
---
Well, for what it's worth, it's not far from Whitespring (another level 20-ish area), and Whitespring is almost always overrun by high level ghouls.  Then again, there really aren't any quests that require you to sneak past the ghouls.
---
Known glitch
---
Haha I had to do a double take while reading that, would’ve liked to hear that story instead
---
Indeed
---
Thanks my dude.
---
Deserves infinite upvotes
---
Easier to test vs workshop walls then? I believe it is possible to (unofficially) team up with someone that claims a workshop. If you're worried about getting wanted, they can leave the server and the workshop items are still around and destructable but unclaimed... so shouldn't have any wanted.
---
Explosive weapons (including both legendaries and missile/grenade launchers ) hitting multiple targets should degrade more vs hitting single targets if we assume it is per hit.
---
Right but couldn’t you just pay a classical pianist to play some music for a one time fee?
---
Weird, right?
---
You’re one of the good ones! Spread the good vibes on Xbox and I’ll do the same over in the Playsteland.

Well I for one didn't know Lowkey was coming back, so thanks for that.

Ohhh good idea.

Go play some Ubisoft trash then.
---
Anyone else getting stuck, unable to move while indoors?  It usually starts for me with seeming lag when I try to move forward, progresses into I can't move directly forward but can start moving again if I also move sideways, and ends up that I can't move at all.  I'll make running animations and can jump but no horizontal movement. (PC)

What system?

Just did the event starting at Southern Belle Motel to Delano Grange and I for THREE sheepsquatches. Those Brahmin had no chance of surviving.

Wondering if there may be a future things about it

No idea. Not much I would guess. Legendary items are much better.

I just sold it for 1k

Nothing its a quest reward.

Absolutely

Nice. He may have nothing better so good for you man.

You're right.

Chameleon is "blend with the environment when sneaking and not moving."
---
Reading from a 2 star chameleon with the description. 
---
So thins is something like "shadowed" or possibly shrouded, but not limited to darkness or standing still.
---
Thanks, must've been a glitch on the item I got, the quest marker went away once I server hopped...
---
Was kind of hoping there was a part two that would make that level 1 leather armor much better. That's pretty lame. Ah well.

Relocating only 1 point each level

Exactly what I said in the last little bit of my post, lol.

I see where you're coming from but I disagree. Bethesda wasn't forcing us to play the game, We played it because we enjoy and have fun with the game. I've also played since beta and been screwed many many times but I still have fun with it. That's like buying a burger eating 90% of it and saying "it's not that good, Restaurant give me a free dessert". Come on man

In my experience these guys are terrible at fighting so they go around destroying camps in adventure mode instead of going to survival and getting their shit pushed in. 
---
I had two of them wrecking my camp, came back and tried to fight thinking I could get the jump on them only to do slap damage. Ended up in a bunch of 1v2 matches that I ended up winning a bunch of. They were absolutely terrible. 
---
Related note, Bethesda really needs to count destroying another players camp as a first attack.

Three dots -&gt; add flair -&gt; select cult of the Mothman. We shall worship the glorious Möth and, hopefully, we will transcend.

That's how player trading works.

Can i get a scaly skin will be on at 10pm PST if possible ign: f91gundam
---
Looks like Cranberry Bog. I'll have to look for him.
---
That would be cool. Maybe some sort of thing like it in the “Wastelanders” DLC stuff?
---
Good, skins in the cash shop is *a good thing*
---
You can get a recipe for a throwing weapon! Sheepsquatch shard

If you have Pacifist mode turned on, this literally cannot happen. So your friend obviously shot back, yes?
---
How does weapon condition decay gets calculated anyway? Is it per hit based? or maybe it gets reduced by X% amount after hitting a target? does damage per shot/magazine size or weapon modifications have any effect on how fast it decays?
---
I don't have a Two-Shot shotgun but I can try testing with a normal one to see if the explosive bullets somehow are affecting it.
---
Nice find btw, it's good to know that at least shotguns ''should'' be deteriorating slower than the other 2.
---
Both
---
Also known as, perhaps fast traveling will be part of the game again! /s
---
If you're on a team, whoever becomes your enemy is now enemies with all your teammates automatically. Since he took OP/OP's teammate workshop, OP/his teammate are now immediately enemies with this guy, and he can kill them without them fighting back. Has happened to me a lot cause I have teammates who like to PVP and fight other players
---
Or legendary......lol
---
Gotta keep the vault dwellers away from the phat loot.
---
I can dump some springs and screws.    Selling is so hit or miss.   Easier to bulk it and sell to the vendors
---
Upvoted for Captainoob. Deserves more exposure.
---
Would be cool, but makes no sense. Radiation gravitates towards water. You’d be fishing for the most Fd up thing you ever saw. Deep ocean fishing? Probably legit. But fishing in West Virginia seems like dipping your willy into a beehive.
---
 Its about 189 caps at the Train Station in Watoga. I have bought, and sold it there several times. ;)
---
I was but gave up after it was not released when they said it would be. 
---
I ended up giving 30+ legendary weapons and 20+ pieces of armor to random players in the worlds I visited. I made sure they were level appropriate and waived hello and dropped the loot, gave a thumbs up and moved on. Received lots of &lt;3 from people and was happy to help. 
---
I figure, I really do not need the caps or the stuff so why not just help out. If I want something I am sure I can find it in the game eventually.
---
Yeah, tested that out when I had the event to myself. They did not take any splash damage. Also didn't get hurt from grenades. Now a Yao Guai, 10 Bloatflies, 10 Mosquitos and a Sheepsquatch can completely destroy the poor level 35 cows within seconds.
---
Nothing still from Bethesda about a full respec.
---
Broken Prosnap Camera is an old junk item, possibly from fo4, if memory serves.
---
I feel like Bethesda could implement some sort of  way to make it work out, but I do agree that it doesn’t make much literal sense haha
---
imdb lists the cast, I literally can't spoil anything for you unless you're making assumptions without seeing it. To be clear, your assumption is ambiguously incorrect. Hope you enjoy!
---
I just hopped on and confirm that I have a spare "modern couches" plan. I'll stay on for a bit if you're able to log on soon too. You can have it for free, but if you have any spare ammo for heavy guns, I'd be happy to take whatever you can spare. Thanks!
---
It’s not bad looking. Just a little mismatched colors and handles.
---
Usually it's minimal.
---
The only one that gets me are the diseases like Glowing Pustules and Rad Worms.  If you use Rads to keep your health down for Bloodied weapons, taking significantly more rad damage on each hit can screw you up at inopportune times.
---
It’s actually pretty weird how little water there is in game. Run to giant ass lake... lake completely empty... Run to river... river completely empty... run to the middle of nowhere... Oh hey look a stream, cool...
---
Nothing yet but ill let you know if i find
---
If you want a workshop, but you want total PVP immunity when you're not at the workshop, you shouldn't take any workshops. The whole thing is that anyone can take your workshop, and you can contest and fight for it. If you don't want to fight for it, then don't go over there. If you'd rather they not hunt you down, block them for session. Or just leave the server
---
Sometimes, everyone is nice and leaves each other alone.  Every now and then, you'll find players who make it a point to go after Workshop owners, *especially* if they are low-level.
---
There were just two Sheepsquatches when we completed the Free Range. 👍
---
Beta gang💪
---
Since they nerfed most crafting stuff, I now farm death claws.
---
I didn’t get shit and I played every beta except one
---
It's all pretty obvious...
---
Level 50 Sheepsquatch in the NE in the Forest... near my camp?? Crap lol
---
Don't think so. I just hit a stash that had a total of 295 in it.
---
Fishing lvl?
---
An anti-armor swing speed combat knife is godly
---
You shouldn't rely on any information from this sub reddit about ban issues sir. If you have moved received or created more then 100,000 items regardless of there rarity in the last 30 days you should be concerned.
---
Sorry I should’ve specified, the timing not the stashed itself.
---
I see them sold often for 1k to 1.5k.
---
Especially considering a burnt book weighs 1.0, a few sheets of paper should be .03 *maybe*, but 0 would be better.
---
How's it a bug if you were pressing too fast?
---
One of the hidden sheep squat game quests goes into the sunken church now, the Motel to the south of it with the bomb defused robot has a note on one of the patio tables
---
I got some knight sgt, how much you paying for those?
---
Yeah.  As much as I remain curious about The Outer Worlds, both it and Borderlands 3 are effectively dead to me because their developers decided I wasn't worthy of paying them.
---
It's especially souring with Borderlands 3 considering that Gearbox's entire existence is due in no small part to Valve.  So for Gearbox to be so cavalier about blasting Valve now, it reflects very poorly on Gearbox.
---
3.5k sound good?
---
Sure I'll add you
---
Cool, give me 5 min, I'm turning I  3 tech daya
---
Don't think this will happen because it makes players keep playing the way it is now
---
Oh ya?
---
I agree the quest string and numerous pieces of reading was quite the effort.
---
No need to be a douche,
---
Thank you for your sacrifice. I know better now because I stand on your shoulders
---
it would be handy at least if you could move points from cards
---
I'm definitely getting them from SBQ battles, but they don't seem to show up in the list of rewards.  I just spontaneously have them when I go to Inspect/Repair in a workbench.
---
Should probably look into doing something with them.  They likely take up weight.
---
Yeah, sucks when you’re not paying attention and lose a bunch.
---

---
The serum recipes are a big sink if you don’t have them already.
---
He knows the current rules, he's suggesting a change.
---
I think it would make more sense that the defender would only be flagged for PVP once they return to defend (and stay until PVP till the contest is resolved) as it is more in line with non workshop PVP initiation.
---
This is quite Interesting as recently scrapping some weapons I discovered that a shotgun of mine was suddenly gone from my inventory. 
---
Never went near it when scrapping ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
The fact that we've had Fo76 for more than 5 months and we still don't have this (and many others) basic functionalities makes me sad and mad
---
Thank you so much!
---
Yeah but if you can’t beat them join them. 75% of the market is duped you probably have a duped weapon or armor piece and don’t brag to me that you don’t and all your AAE or TSE weapons were drops
---
I hate it when I get a run on the same prefix.  Three SBQ battles back-to-back.  Three Mutant Slayer's crap.
---
Y'know, if the system is supposed to be random, then make it random.  The likelihood of getting a run of the same prefix should be very small.
---
we really need sub groups - notes should be - quest / lore / known blueprints / new blueprints / misc
---
Bagged one just north of Harpers Ferry at the bridge.
---
Just being able to sell ammo no one wants to vendors would be a plus. I sell all my ammo to a guy that runs a shop, but it’s rare when I want to hang onto mini nukes or missiles long enough to justify the carry weight til my next ammo drop.
---
I’m online now, give me a shout whenever you’re ready. It’s no rush
---
Yeah you get free dlc as a reward
---
I agree.  I had a screenshot with all possible locations and just started there.  Never hopped once.  Went to like 4 places before I found it.  I really think ppl are going to water park and just hopping from there multiple times. Then coming here to complain
---
So pissed off I was away for a month with work 😞
---
Shotgun is Str so it synergies with Melee.  Riffle is not.  Not sure I get what you are saying.  Can you like the melee and rifle build?
---
Well look there's isn't really much endgame content so the only things that makes people keep playing are getting better weapon/armor and getting the perfect build.
---
During the Cold Case quest, where you're searching for a kidnapped child, you're supposed to be able to repair the KidSecure ID at a tinkerer's bench. 
---
Even with the materials, you can't repair it. It's impossible to complete that objective. Thankfully it's an optional objective, but still really annoying. 
---
It tells you that you don't have the necessary materials to craft the repaired ID.
---
Mine came from a ghoul at white springs.
---
I agree. There's survival for a reason. I honestly think they should make Adventure strictly PvE, except for workshop take overs, in which case if you don't go defend it, you shouldn't be able to be killed just because you own it. PvP should only initiate if both of you are within the workshop area. I had the same thing happen to me, only I was at the Tinker Bench at Welch Station and got a mini nuke to the back. They should have considered there'd be players who don't want anything to do with PvP when they made the game.
---
Good point. Added the resource piece to under the Stash Your Shit header. GLHF out there.
---
I think it would be better if they didn’t and I have no idea how that would be clear. if you buy a weapon skin why wouldn’t a silencer still show up. Or a stock?
---
I think there is a bug with shotgun durability decay, since apparently durability gets reduced only when you actually hit an enemy. Since shotguns fire 7(8?) pellets they might be deteriorating at an increased speed because they are ''hitting'' the enemy multiple times per shot. 
---
This would also affect weapons with the Two-Shot effect and other multi-shot weapons like the Harpoon Gun with the flechette mod, since the additional projectiles would be handled in the same way as the shotgun pellets and thus have an increased effect on how fast the weapon breaks.
---
Gatling guns are the best
---
Just BOOM BOOM BOOM the day away
---
Wait so you want your gun to look like a base weapon when you put a shop skin on it?
---
Yeah I scored 22 beer bottles from this location. It sucks that items are now "instanced" so you cant farm another 22 until a few hours. Anyone have a second location?
---
Yea sorry my bad. Still fo3, fo4 and both ES releases, Skyrim more so then oblivion are generally the better game then anything Ubisoft have put out
---
Fantastic!
---
❌* STILL HERE *❌
---
Does lucky actually affect how often you get good plans???
---
I tried it earlier too and forgot to report on it.  Same result - it did not work.  I guess the challenge is literally impossible to complete unless Bethesda does a hotfix or something.
---
A runescape like trade menu with confirmation screen would be ideal.

I live very close to Freddy’s BBQ. Sometimes, I pretend that I am Freddy. I’m not sure if I want a level 80 beast roamin’ near my ( a level 60) property.

Why not be able to sell ammo to vendors? Maybe you have to bulk it like anything else? Even if it's super cheap to sell
---
Do you welcome visitors to your camp? It sounds rather impressive.

I would love to check it out sometime

I really like the backpack with the Star that just screams USA and it reminds me of the allied star used in WW2. It also looks really good I really really hope it made the cut because if not I'd pay for it instead.

B o b b y pi n s ... they sell and are virtually weightless now

Whoops, just put myself online sorry about that
---
Just realized back online.
---
Yes, same for me, pretty annoying
---
No problem!
---
Off topic, but I think we maybe need to start distinguishing between imposter and real sheepsquatch now that the real one is active and in events.
---
Correct.
---
It would be suuuuuper easy to get around any filter. All they'd need is a simple line to spell/draw pretty much anything..
---
Nope
---

---
I will link it in this post but they changed it to gamerdvr.com And my clip hasn't uploaded yet 😖
---
I totally agree. His weapon spotlights are great for learning how to optimize a weapon.
---
Is this a new daily?
---
No. But the output 100 power. It’s a generator that generates electricity and runs off fusion cores. Although, you don’t need to refuel it. Thank god.
---
Same here, it's been frustrating to watch them focus on things like additions to the Atom shop, pointless nerfs and other nonsense all while a KEY function of any online game remains unaddressed.
---
Yep. It's core, basic functionality of it being an online game.
---
There is a new event called Free Range where you fight the sheepsquatch. When I fought the sheepsquatch through the Free Range event, I found it at Southern Belle Motel.
---
I’m expecting that if you emote around the prospector you will lose the legendaries in your inventory and be teleported into a fissure.
---
You’re a gentleman and a scholar
---
Oh, I don’t disagree. I was just mentioning what i would vendor. Even selling to other players there’s stuff that isn’t in demand.
---
 [u/valseek](https://www.reddit.com/u/valseek) are multi-projectile weapons intended to trigger the gun condition loss multiple times? Is the shotgun weapon category durability already taking this into account? What about Two-Shot weapons or other effects that increase the amount of projectiles that you fire with a single shot, are those intended to have an increased effect on weapon condition decay?
---
My friend and I randomly encountered a sheepsquatch out in cranberry bog. No event or any kind of thing tied to it
---
I am one of the very few people using a medic shotgun build, instead of a TSE build. I doubt my gun was duped, even though I agree with your sentiment.
---
Y tho? I'd rather they add contents like vaults and dungeons.
---
Cash registers at white springs/train stations. Or just dropping them at train stations or the artisans corner.
---
If you're on PC, I'd pay for 40mm grenades if you're dumping any.
---
Mole miners are the most fearless predator in the wasteland.
---
Level 80 Noxious Sheepsquatch? *Fucking beat it to death*
---
That is interesting idea
---
The blue suitcase leaning up against the seats inside Watoga train station seems to be a popular one.
---
Ok!
---
What did he drop? Meat? Ballistic fiber sheep fur?
---
Yup its simple fix but probably wont be done unless we keep pushing these issues to the top of reddit.
---
You should be able to get somebody to make one for you in the batcave
---
Very true, but some of us are almost always overloaded, especially out of PA! :)
---
Some games like Guildwars 2 do it so that you get a reward each time you log in that progresses to a better reward.  If you skip days, it doesn't reset you, it just keeps progress where it as already, in kind of a frozen state.  So you get something from logging in (and might play since you are already logged in) but doesn't cause any stress in that if you forget to log in or just can't you will lose your build-up rewards.  And it eventually gets to a really nice reward at the end of the track and resets back to the first small reward.
---
Check in your quests to see if It's highlighted. If not there, then likely someone picked up your stuff.
---
If you were on PS4 I could've helped you. Crafting 40 of them for the survival challenge but only got 30 now. I know it's not much but it's something. Would've excepted Mr fuzzy tokens.
---
Sorry, looks like I don't have that one.
---
I have a TSE Prime LMG and TSE Prime Gatling Plasma. Both shred through anything, it's disgustingly glorious. Both my babys have plenty of ammo, so they roar all night long.
---
Sounds like you shouldn't group with your low level friend while trying to hold a workshop. Good old common sense...
---
I held that guy from 12:30 to 4:00 one day trying to get as many people as I could. I think i made like 50 new friends lol
---
Where the hecj is the real one then?
---
It's a levelled item so sometimes people who have done the quest prior to level 50 want the max version.
---
IMA BE BIG TIMIN IN MY BODEGA BOY!
---
Is the base damage actually that good or are you running perks
---
The nuka cola outfit that has a fake jet pack on it.
---
While Bethesda hasn’t officially said mods are ok. They have inferred that QoL mods are ok. That is all subject to change at a moments notice though.
---
Ahh, gotcha. Didnt see the new even as its my nephews birthday this week so I havnt been able to play much in preparation for that.  
---
Thanks guys. I wont watch juiceheads videos anymore. His videos more recently have been overly critical in my opinion. And it kinda bothers me how unpredictable he is with his support/non support of this game.
---
Yup bit me too. Lost a Gatling and 1 excavator arm and a leg. Not cool BSG.
---
I demand to jingle jangle jingle once again.
---
Don't suppose you have a lvl 50 explosive shotgun or automatic rifle do you? 😬
---
That protection was suppose to be implemented this last update. Right?
---
This....
---
Ummm how do you activate the event
---
I still have my Explosive Splitter Gatling Plasma, so I would guess it's take something serious to be rid of it.
---
LOL Did you find a bag of goodies on your small cabins bed last night? There was a camp last night (on pc) right there in that spot. It was all tightly locked up, a cute little cabin. They didnt lock their windows and had a weapons work bench right up to the window. So I just opened the window and stepped right in, used the ammenites and then left a bag of minor loot as thanks on the bed. 
---
Also, yes I had to leave that spot like a month ago, too many people camp around there. I am still kind of close but rarely have an issue in my curtrent spot. ( I leave my place all unlocked.)
---
I think I read it would be in patch 9 which comes out on May 7th. Keep our fingers crossed.
---
Upload the clip to onedrive
---
Far from useless in silos. You can walk right through with a decent sneak loadout (minus the turrets). Highly recommend trying that out.
---
To be fair, RDR2 has as well, they just havn't added significantly different content.
---
If you do a search, you will find 400 other people who asked the same exact question.
---
I figured that was the casual clothing you can mod. They're just a bunch of anarchist and militia.
---
The conductors are just a way to basically get the power lines to a connector without them hanging everywhere. But you will need the power hooked up to a power pylon and have the pylon near your lights
---
No, but a good 3*bloodied shotgun! And more!
---
I have a  two theories  on why this happens. I think it might have something to do with cache date on the xbox. Soft reset your system by holding the power button for 10 seconds and see if that helps, it sometimes works for me. My other thoery is that there is a limit to how many total cap you can have in your total caps that can be from cap stashes. Try spending like 10k of your caps on plans and see if that helps. Usually when I am near the max caps of 25k the stashes Wil not spawn even after a week but when I spend 10k or so the next day all the stashes will respawn.
---
So basically no
---
Ok thanks!
---
Right,  I didn't care necessarily about building the workshop and had no intention of contesting it if someone tried to take it.  But they didn't try to take it, they just used it to attack me when my guard was down at home. 
---
I have no problem getting good attacked at a workshop, but people are using it to unlock pvp for people who clearly aren't expecting it or agent expecting it at home.
---
It is a lot better since December.
---
I think it sucks that usually 'early access/beta' buyers get a pretty big discount but in this case paid many times as much (4x+ for early buyers).  
---
They absolutely should issue a thank you to early access buyers with atoms, something that doesn't really cost them much.  We ended up penalized for our devotion.
---
There are actual fish tho
---
What's the endgame now?
---
4 star legendary Todd Howard
---
Is this witch hunting?
---
Sounds like the dream. I'm sold
---
Yeah I traveled t each one as well and no luck finding any of these.
---
I'm actually kind of surprised they force that on us.
---
If I  see a new lvl 2 at the Vault, I always like to drop my extra stuff in the Cache in the Overseer's Camp to help the new player out.
---
"Alpha testers."  The Beta didn't come until release.
---
We don't need to increase caps limit.
---
But we need to buy tradable stuffs for 25k caps (like a paint) (on a 175% buying price base).
---
Once you buy it, you can resell it accordingly to the charisma/hard bargain rules to a bot.
---
This would be more interesting.
---
Named brahmin? Did I run past a sheepsquatch? Glowing toads wreked one as I ran through.
---
Any bloodied rifles?
---
Yee... Hah... Can't wait now that PA is part of the equation. I hope they have backpack skins available that will blend with my wetsuit.
---
Depends on the prefix effect. Explosive is a secondary effect and therefore only appears on 2* or 3* guns. 
---
If it's a lower tier prefix effect like Hunter's or Exterminator's then you'd probably get one pretty cheaply. 
---
If it's something like Bloodied and Anti-Armor you'll probably not touch it for it Caps.
---
I ran into two in the Bog within 10 minutes of each other around one of those pink forests on the southernmost side.  Had to fight him and two scorchbeasts at the same time at one point.   Both weren’t hard to kill, fill em up with lead and bob and weave a bit.  Was fun but their drops left something to be desired.
---
Come down and look ;)
---
They gave us Collector's Editions some atoms and canvas-gate....delayed forever.
---
Have any instigating weapons sledges or rifles? I’ll buy
---
Sorry didnt see the reply. I'll only be home at 1130pm EST but will be on then if you need the help. I think I also have a lvl30 torso for t51 with a jetpack I found that you can have as well
---
Sheepsquatch is usually at the end. There's 2 or 3 attacks on the brahmin along the way.
---
At the end of today's inside the vault they said 
---
"Join us again next week for another Inside the Vault, where we will be sharing a look at additional Patch 9 features and content, like Player Vending, C.A.M.P. décor, and more!"
---
Youre the best ign arfarf93

Excepting Prime Automatic of course.

I'd rather have the ability to tame a robot for c.a.m.p. use first.
---
Can’t off for the night
---
What?
---
We're open every other day so come on down on Saturday
---
Perks + food. It's damage is two time lower than my bloodied super sledge
---
Refueling the generator.
---
Yeah and they started giving people Atoms in the difference to make up for the price drop. Then they changed their tune shortly after and stated that they dont give atoms just because it goes on sale or bc you bought it at 60
---
Nice dude! They're allowing little buggers
---
Thanks I run bloodied sledge as well, good to know it’s not worth grinding for. Looks cool though
---
No, it's a new event.
---
__I'm actually kind of surprised they force that on us.__
---
Oh right there is rsdio in the game...
---
the WHAT
---
Pretty strong fella, don't let him get close to you - can do some serious melee damage.
---
Took me several minutes of non-stop shooting from looted Assault rifle to drop this bad boy.
---
Yes! I want a "grief me if you're roll playing" banner please.
---
Instigating Lever Action :)
---
its all i use. gatling guns are great, ammo is plentiful and it wrecks mobs
---
Forgive me for pointing this out, but we *just* stopped raging over the repair kits, and people are already raging over the mere *idea* of the backpack having atom shop components, despite no evidence it will do so. I rather suspect that anything they were to give would not gain them much good will, but more outcry of "Why don't we have X instead of Y."
---
You know, like the fellow at the bottom who claims that free games have no value.
---
Coming!
---
Sorry its called Coal Dust, it's a new excavator paint in atomic shop
---
Hhmmm...ok. And do you have any kind of estimate for what "cheap" would be. Lol
---
He's a one shot, least on pvp guy. The sheepsquatch is weaker than a mirlurk queen it seems, kind of disappointed.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e\_NPpa0-BHc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_NPpa0-BHc)
---
oh my God im getting it now
---
By walking around the approximate locations I gave. It just isn't guaranteed to be in all locations at once. Seems to be tied to one location until it is completed, then it goes into a cooldown, and then pops up at another location. Really, the best way to find it is to simply server hop at the BBQ Shack. You don't even have to move for the quest to show up. Just spawn in, and, if it's not there, hop to another server.
---
Just out of curiosity, what we're all those rare and best weapons you got?
---
I wish I had known the Belle Motel one was the hard one, I found it randomly, tried to solo it unsuspecting, and got WRECKED lmao.
---
Did the Fred BBQ one and it was fine though, four other folks showed up and it was easy peasy. We had 2 spawn, I don't know what level they were though.
---
Yea there are even perk cards for doing more damage to camp structures. I don't go around destroying camps, i admire them maybe grab a drink, drop my stuff off maybe even have a nap. If there a way to leave gifts for the owners in a way they could see. I'm still pretty new to the game.
---
Have you considered trying IronManDies ?

https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9stq0k/how_to_uncap_frame_rate_144hz/
---
You may not need to cap, I'm usually 100-140fps @ 1440p 144hz w/ 9700k and a 2080 Ti. If you do want to hard cap, grab Rivatuner Statics Server; easiest and most reliable way to cap FPS imo. You can also use it in conjunction with MSI Afterburner to display temps, usages, and speeds related to the cpu and gpu.

I mean it wasn’t in the game yesterday. At all. Someone would’ve noticed the event pop up if it was. So it wasn’t not finding it, because it was impossible for us to find it until today. But I get what you’re saying.
---
Thank you again!!!
---
Ah, I meant to say surprised they didn't. My apologies.
---
Crap. I have a Gatling a a couple of armor pieces missing. I thought it was the random! Delete bug, but maybe it's this. I scrap like 40 guns every time I hit West Tek. This was a legendary weapon so it should not have shown up to scrap at a crafting station.
---
Who knows. Everything about the Enclave seems to indicate that a TON of stuff was cut from the game before launch.   
---
The whole Enclave plotline seems like it was meant to be a real main quest for the game, and EVERYTHING about Whitesprings screams Player Hub for a game with more then just 25 people per server. I mean that shopping level alone makes it look like Fallout 76's version of Stormwind
---
As silly as it sounds, I got Ark evolved because it had a cool ass greenhouse feature. 
---
I immediately became my tribe's gardener and beekeeper. 
---
I wish we could do this in fallout. I know it's wishful thinking, but I would spend days making different flower arrangments.
---
Like 4 two shot explosive guns (1 dropped 3 bought), 3 bloodied unarmed weapons (2 dropped one bought), and a bloodied shotgun (bought). Along with mr. Fuzzy's head and hunters coat or whatever it's called
---
oh i though you're talking about shepherd crook. Burning barbed Sheepsquatch staff is has 40 less damage than my bloodied SS. And this is without legendary effects. I hope legendary vendor will help us to make these things legendary
---
You mean “they *didn’t* force that on us?
---
What armor are they? Combat, metal, such?
---
That would be awesome....
---
Lol damn you murked that sheepsquatch  I haven't encountered any solo, but I did the event like 2 hrs ago and man was that tough.
---
I like how I got downvoted for asking about the endgame lmao
---
Happy cake day!
---
I live near there too. I fear for my life now. May have to move even.
---
And they could add fish that you could cook
---
Thats what i did when i saw this post
---
Yes they are but it's the first time I seen one are they really rare to spot? I'm lvl 32
---
You mean you want to be able to achieve things by directing your will and taking action toward it instead of repeating the same thing over and over again until a random number generator decides it's time?
---
Yeah caps is fine. The only thing I’m looking for right now is unyielding/cavaliers armor
---
Yup. Contesting a workshop should enable PVP *AT THE WORKSHOP*. Not for them to chase you down anywhere in the world; that’s not the intent of having PVP around workshops. They’re supposed to be a resource to fight over, not a tool to gank people.
---
Same there was 2 in the bog.
---
that's my next route, oh also check the church in flatwoods, might find the responders police uniform there. if not, depending on what you're playing on i can give you mine
---
Best I ever had too 😆
---
Yeah i don't have that lol
---
How much caps you want for it?
---
Meh.
---
I mean killing things in one shot is meh
---
Ima comin!!!! &lt;3
---
I got it 2 weeks ago on ps4. Been loving it, havent had many bugs or disconnects though this might be because I am going slow and not into the higher areas yet.
---
I got wrecked solo at Southern Belle too, don't worry. And I believe the levels at Big Fred's are the same as the motel for the Sheepsquatch, but it seems like the additional enemies that spawn at Big Fred's are just much easier for me.
---
Damn that’s scary! Lol
---
Do you know how to do this without a third party tool? I used to be able to get it working with borderless windowed mode + some change in the .ini but I can't find it through any googling.
---
I've got a 2080ti and 9900k but I'm at 1080p so my FPS goes past 144 up to 160 something at times, and obviously far past that at any menu.
---
With mole rat armor DLC at an absurd price ;)
---
Leaving things out of the patch notes has really destroyed my ability to trust Bethesda with this game. For any issue that I encounter I have no idea if it was a purposeful change or a bug.
---
I've been doing the same. Currently farming caps for the legs for my excavator armor.
---
Lol no just power
---
One of them is a right arm that’s BOS combat armor. The other is a robot left arm.
---
I suspect the game remembers your preference on repeatable quests displayed on the HUD. I ignore most workshop quests; it shows in the pip boy but not the hud.
---
Such a brilliant idea. I’m down!
---
How'd you get your power fist to 500 damage? I have Max rank of iron fist and mine only goes up to 255
---
Unfortunately I do not. RTSS has been my go to with frame rate capping.
---
I just got this today, I only have Cranberry Moonshine to go. It is super lame doing the same quest over and over again just to effectively roll a dice.
---
Ah, curious if either were metal. Been looking for more sent/assassin metal pieces
---
Bobby Pins trade one for one with caps ..... it's always been alternate currency with me (except when it weighed a tonne for those two times).
---
Yeah, I only had one spawn, but it was just me, him, not enough grenades and no living brahmin, lmao. At least I got a couple random legendaries off of it, but of course the game crashed so IDK what the hell they were after I grabbed em, I'll figure it out later, lol.
---
Personally, I'd say give it another shot. I can't really speak much on the endgame part of it, but it has gotten better, although admittedly there are still several rather infuriating bugs and glitches. Also, it is not P2W. Repair kits would be hard to use in the midst of pvp. They are simply there to help people keep from going to workbenches every hour or two
---
Just did this. It actually doesn’t feel as sketchy now lol thanks bro
---
Yeah metal is a super un appreciated armor.
---
Yep...... and plentiful.
---
Most of the people who play video games enough to get to insane levels like 200+ are very sad people who don’t have much of a life and want to see the world burn.  I nuked site prime and we were fighting the queen when a high level player came by and started killing people instead of fighting the queen. I lost like 500 caps and all my scraps from the silo, I DONT EVEN KNOW HOW HE WAS KILLING US IT WAS NOT A SURVIVAL SERVER.
---
They are already adding a legendary player system in a later patch with special perks, and the like.
---
I think it’s more like a PSA
---
What platform are you on
---
Yeah, there's a vendor nearby IronManDies that you can go to and it has ThorBeheadsThanos.
---
Really is, especially since I have one piece and want more lol
---
Weird, I’ve done this twice and had 3-stars!! That’s unlucky!
---
50
---
Pretty sure there's an electrified mod for the club.
---
One has a star next to it.
---
Supposedly will be fixed in patch 9
---
PA with a heavy weapon build is a blast. You feel like a tank. With the DR you can sit there and take a beating burning through everything with an explosive mini gun. 
---
Just plan to spend hours crafting ammo lol.
---
Live no clue, dead, several in the gloss cavern by where the sbq spawns
---
Every single one has been a one star for me. There's maybe been one two star. 
---
They just hate me and don't want me to succeed, those damned Squatches! 
---
I did have a three star bloodbug last run though lol
---
That's fair, thanks for the genuine response, I've just been replaying 4 over and over and 76 doesn't have that kick 4 does for me
---
I want it to look like whatever I paid for it to look like, I don't want mods interfering with the style I chose.
---
I'm at 1100 hours now, played every minute of the beta, felt completely ripped off when I paid over 100 CAD for the tricentennial preorder and then watched it drop to pennies on the dollar right after launch. I would love some free atoms or better yet, a custom paint job for all power armour and an outfit to show we stayed the course. It would cost BGS nothing and really make my day at least.
---
Thank you!
---
This guy. He has a basic grip on reality.
---
You rare soul, you don’t belong here.
---
Happened to me a lot yesterday too. Very annoying.
---
Good job! I've only fought two. Really rare haha
---
The scumbags at epic got BL3 WTF I didn't know this untill I read your post. I'm a console player and I was recently educated as to why epic sucks and how they steal info/ thier launcher blows along with all the other crap they pull.
---
It pisses me off that epic keeps screwing over the pc guys. Especially after talking with a bunch of them on the Outerlands reddit. They are a really good people I expected to get a bunch of hate because I didn't know why epic was so bad and wanted to know what was going on. Instead they clearly explained it to me. Good people on pc's
---
We got 2 3 star legendary sheephoes at the event just a few min ago
---
I found a non even one https://youtu.be/GcEnjm-OZgI
---
in the mire, one can spawn at tanagra town and 3 can spawn at the treehouse village
---
Occasionally pop up between federal disposal field workshop and closest farm South fighting supermutant.
---
You are terrible. Do it to a level 40+ player. Unless you're chicken ;)
---
In my experience if I don't get to play for a day after my run it takes longer for them to reset - that being said if I do my run every other day they all mostly spawn in and have more caps. I usually make about 3-4k per run.
---
Nocturnal wood leg. Lol
---
Its worse. I deleted it
---
Maybe once I hit level 40 lol

3 more legendary fails. i'll keep recording. happy for reference.

Sure do! Although it’s not very impressive tbh - I’m a casual player at best. (Especially when compared to bored, L265s - haha.)
---
SanSeven12 on PS4 if you ever want to check out my very humble digs and share a Hello emote sometime!
---
To be honest, I read the title and came in thinking it was going to be sarcasm, maybe I am getting jaded with this sub.
---
Personally I can't wait to spot one myself but at the same time I am way too low a level for that sort of a fight.
---
Appreciate the honesty lmao
---
No it's sharing an experience with a shit bag to help others avoid feeding the troll.
---
💰 🐷
---
Totally agree on all your points.
---
The funny thing is I wasn’t even that mad...more confused. Like, “you’re 200 levels higher than me, and just wrecking my shit...just because?”
---
Never has the “???” emote been more spot on.
---
See, 76 is my first FO game. So when everyone compares it to the rest of them and trashes it or something, I don't have that base to reference. So some of the things that bother some people don't phase me at all. Lol
---
I'm getting random CTDs upon successfully picking any lock (could be the first lock I pick or the 12th), has been this way for over a month. Someone else posted about this, but then deleted the thread, no idea why: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b1rz9l/annoying_bug_with_newest_update/. Are we the only ones? :P
---
Any chance you are still there?
---
People who complain about it obviously haven't IronManDies.
---
I would kill for a mothman outfit.
---
Yup still here!
---
Crazy the different motivations we have when out in the Wasteland, right? That sounds so frustrating. 
---
Keep fighting the good fight! 
---
(And fuck those guys.)
---
I lived on the twin lakes for months, but your right, lately it seems to be the hot spot for camps.
---
❌* STILL HERE*❌

awesome
---
Gatling owners gasp in unison. I'll take whatever 5mm rounds you don't want.....
---
Source?
---
1400 caps across the board instead of 200 each. Just makes it quicker. But go ahead, complain about Bethesda "killing their game".
---
Nope, Cap Stash is universal now.  
---
1,400 caps shared across all Vendors.
---
He's extremely knowledgeable about many builds and weapons, and cranky, and hilarious - love his vids!
---
Sure I get that, although it can still look like what you bought and have mods reflect that style. Like the wooden inlay paint for the lever action still has mods apply and doesn’t just make them non existent... but for some reason the wiffle bat doesn’t. That’s misleading af if u ask me there’s nothing in the description that would say it covers up mods.
---
It was in one of the update Roadmaps. Pretty sure it was for the summer update
---
A 20 year old game has a better trading interface than FO76...  Now that's pretty pathetic.
---
That's crazy, I recommend NV and 4 I feel like they both have much more to bring to the table
---
Just east of whitesprings station. Follow the tracks south to a drive that goes up to a cabin. Just a little past the cabin you will find a lake. Beheamoth lives in that lake.
---
How did you not notice the train station vendor had 1400 caps instead of 200?
---
My first camp was at the top of the mountain in the Ash  Heap that is now used for the fake Cryptid event l.o.l.   ..... loved that spot.  There is no going back ... l.o.l.
---
My thought too. I came back and had the same reaction. Just why? What do you get from this? I killed them a few times, got called a faggot, server hopped then rebuilt my camp to avoid the repair costs and made some improvements.
---
All said and done it was an 8/10 encounter.
---
Man, I didn’t realize how huge the dude was...
---
Im pretty sure it will come back for a limited time again next year.
---
I do a big farming loop around the map hitting 67 Caps stashes along the way
---
This was something Id had prepared awhile ago. I just kept forgetting to upload it. But thanks for the share.
---
Yeah, I feel like I run into something like this. Like it’s not just a 20 hour cool down, it’s also a “2 hours active playtime in between” timer as well.
---
Holy fuck I would love to see my state make its way into a game
---
Lol yea for real. Mans was using a stealth boy too smh
---
Have you read the note since repairing the camera? I don't remember what exactly kicked off the quest for me but I remember I had to reread the note after fixing the camera.
---
Playing within the boundaries of the game, using a perk card specifically for damaging player structures. Perfectly fine. Not terrible just for trying to go on a raid lmao
---
Start blowing up the bases they’ll move pretty quick
---
So absurd. They’re playing a different game than we are.
---
It’s a psa not a witch hunt, he’s sharing a experience he had with a player, not advocating anything about said player
---
I got off class a little early, I’ll be on for the next couple hours, if you can make it.
---
My TSE handmade breaks super fast compared to other weapons, including my shotguns which is why I don't use it as my beater weapon which is a gatling and lasts forever when repaired to 200%.
---
I’ll be on for the next couple hours.
---
I've got a hidden mountain hospice kind of build now .... comfy getaway from the apocalypse.... leave it wide open for anyone to use .... when the player vending machines finally come, I'm planning to sell high end stuff really cheap for anyone who actually finds the place.
---
Tried to add Alex_Duos, says username does not exist. Let me know your username, and add me when you are online next.
---
What I’m the name of Atom?! That fuckers huge!
---
I hope this never happens. This game is so dull, I've made a game of stalking people and ferreting out their camps, and then destroying them.
---
Fun With Flags
---
Accepted your friend request and joining your world now.
---
Yes. I did several times as stated in the post.
---
Yea definitely. I suppose they’ve gotten to the point where they don’t need to farm queens and stuff so they only way to find fun in the game is to kill other players (somehow in adventure) I think that just says beth needs to add more endgame content for people who have done it all.
---
Yeah I played one the other day and all I got was IronManDies.
---
Yep, there would be dick flags everywhere
---
For me the “endgame” is finding great spots to set up camp. Thinking bigger, the game is ever changing and constantly evolving. 
---
Just based on your jump to level 100 and how early you played gives me the impression you just sped through everything lol so you might not think there’s any difference for that reason alone
---
I second that request. What the hell happened to the preview pictures in the Atom Shop, Bethesda? I would like to know if this is a fully black skin;  it looks more like bronze with maybe some dust on top. I would buy the first but not the second one.
---
It doesn't drop.  It's an Atom Shop paint you apply yourself and cannot drop or trade.
---
Added you and jumping to you now.
---
Yup, then I play for a few hours and check the status of the one on the bunker which is near the start of my run - if that's refreshed I'm good to go.
---
Weight reduction perks have never worked in a stash box
---
You live very close to the spot I do. Very peaceful and quiet there. Or was. I was there when Twin Lakes was 'the spot'. I enjoyed absolute peace and quiet for months that had a unique perk of being a great location to farm nuclear key cards. Now, it's getting popular. But no worries. I knew this day would come and I have another hidden spot no one ever goes to...with a great view!
---
Good luck finding a new home, my friend!
---
\+karma
---
You sir are a legend and a swanky dresser.
---
+karma thanks!
---
Haha thanks man no problem!
---
When you loot bodies you pick up the extras.
---
Thank you I’m aware of that but they do work on your character and they are not reducing its weight .
---
I bought an instigating dragon for around 1.2k caps a few weeks ago. Idk if that's helps. Im not big on trading. Sorry bud.
---
If you're on Xbox, feel free to join me! GT is McTrustyPants
---
Most of the users here are still upset Bethesda didn't listen about utility items in the Atomic Shop. That *reeeeally* rubbed a lot of people the wrong way. That's probably the biggest thing *right now.* (But has been largely hushed for the moment of the Sheepsquatch has come.)
---
Another thing is this dlc has been mostly easy events or QoL. Higher level folks flock to things like Encryptid and the Sheepsquatch because everything else is so easy. That's the main thing that's frustrating a lot of people I think. 
---
But most of the criticism is constructive or just player ideas.  I'd ignore all the other comments like "offline for maintenance? How about offline for good!" They want nothing to do with being constructive and only want attention.
---
Next they'll try to come for our guns
---
Really really real. Like really super real.
---
Yeah um on ps4 but thanks anyway
---
Thats very true BlackWidowDies
---
Yes i know but when logged out i had 50 harpoons and when i logged back in i suddenly had 100
---
I think of events in a game like Destiny 2 where there's all kinds of shit going on And you're running around dropping headshots and blowing shit up.......
---
And then there is Fallout 76.........12 people walking through the woods with cows/robots for 10 minutes and then a 1* boss pops out and gets killed in 15 seconds.
---
My reward after wasting 10 minutes of my life........plans to build a Shepard's Crook. Not a Handmade, not a Deathclaw........a fucking walking cane that does 125 damage.
---
Man, everyone keeps saying that. I don’t even know it! My mobile client doesn’t show anything. Thanks?
---
Sure. Friend request sent. Just find me when you get on later tonight. IGN: jchamlin
---
So real
---
Ok, I might be able to get in game in an hour or so.
---
You have a blue cake next to your /u
---
Also, F the BoS.
---
It’s x2 xp weekend get out there and grind!
---
As an Xbox player who is part of a group that *actively* looks for lower levels to help.... I disagree with that assumption of Xbox players. 
---
I’m glad you have good players on your console too. Be safe out there.
---
Most of the people left here are money pigs man, you’ll always get downvoted for pointing out the obvious truth.
---
Non-legendary stuff and a cool mask that you can't wear a hat with so it ends up looking dumb.
---
Heck yeah, dude!
---
1. Everything freezes, it happens when the counter reaches 1 and lasts probably 10 seconds max but the game might be still loading in the background as by the time the screen gets to the standard load screen 3-5 seconds later or so into it im already loaded in the server...(every load screen in game works as normal as well)
---
2. No more than a second max im going to guess but happens constantly and consistently from my 1-2 days of play time
---
3. I dont have enough experience with this to give further info as i havent been noticing it too much (i.e. if its a general issue or certain weapons or how often it occurs etc)
---
You messed up
---
Obligatory r/uselessredcircle to help you out.
---
I would actually like to see Camoflouged Camp items like with gillie netting so you can hide your Camp better in Survival Mode.
---
As low as the seller will let it go for.
---
But how am I supposed to conform to my idiosyncrstic group?
---
:(
---
4 hours and went from 305-311. ill surpass my banned account in no time. quest for the biggest number continues!
---
My understanding of why you're able to loot more than you fired is that it revolves around the flechette mod. Since each projectile has a chance to spawn a harpoon in the target's inventory, you could potentially harvest more than you fired when using the flechette mod. 
---
Also interesting, members of your team can harvest them too. For some time when leveling I ran a prime crossbow. Teammates initially remarked upon the oddity of finding Ultracite Crossbow bolts on dead ghouls.
---
When you sell something, this case may be different, just back out and then go back to the vendor and you should be able to buy it back. 
---
I thought we couldn't sell or drop it.
---
My guess is you can go back to your tinker bench and craft another, probably just need another broken camera.
---
I guess I'm just not clear on what witch hunting on a sub means.
---
See i understand why people get mad over the repair kits, but if their cheap enough it doesnt add a gameplay advantage. But being 50 atoms a pop its not very worth it. Its cheap but needs to be closer to 10-15 atoms a pop.
---
Stop spoiling! Imagine if I could snap my fingers like tony and die
---
Yeah I stopped the first wet of robots but as you get deeper and try to access the mainframe they send more hostile bots
---
Like all the posts about vendors and caps, the OP doesn't understand how vendors and caps work. At least you didn't complain about server jumping 20 times.
---
Oregon trail was better.
---
Are you playing on PC?
---
Ugh I wish they'd stop giving us bland looking colors for the excavator power armor. I've only got the garrahan paint job and at the time didn't have enough for the raider so I missed out on that one. And the chrome was also meh.
---
Dude. Really?
---
Thank you for an actual answer.
---
Now try workshop PvP.
---
thank you, kind wastelander!
---
Really what? Do you expect me to ThorBeheadsThanos?
---
[https://youtu.be/cuUMbH1dF3E](https://youtu.be/cuUMbH1dF3E)
---
Thats the problem, i need the broken camera that came from the tourist but she doesnt have it anymore
---
It's actually AlexDuos.  I sent you an invite around an hour ago  so it should be there
---
Ps4
---
That's insane. But like i said when i logged out i had 50 harpoons and when i logged in afterwards i suddenly had 100
---
Chrome looked white in some lighting
---
Exactly why I didn't buy it. Come on Bethesda, show the excavator more love!!!
---
I had a three star sheepsquatch show up. Got a ghoul-slayer, limp damaging, faster movement speed while aiming 50 cal.
---
You are absolutely right thank you. 😃
---
This has been a thing for awhile, not from 8.5, this happened to me bc i found the ID and crafted it without knowing what it was for and by the time i got into that quest i couldnt complete it just as you stated...
---
North of the thorn one will occasionally spawn fighting yaio guai but you gave to be careful you don't cross the border to the savage devide
---
Yeah got to be a bug, I suppose you can create a 2nd character and get the camera from that one until they fix it .. I noticed that as well the body was empty .. any chance you can go back to the vendor ?
---
I think any random encounter location can do it but they are random encounters. Plus with sheepsquatch actually spawning in those locations as well that’s one more encounter you can get instead now. Basically server hop search rinse repeat is the best you can do
---
Glad I could help.
---
I got mutant slayer wood armor
---
Iirc someone already datamined backpack designs and posted 'em here. Gonna check the game archives to find out, hope that mothman one's there -))
---
I hate the cap limit because so many people use mule counts so they don't necessarily worry about it, but me? None of my friends play this any more so I have no way to mule. I am just stuck at 25k caps and I don't ever see the guns I want to buy. (AAE handmade/LA on XB1)
---
The Secret Service would like to have a word with you
---
[https://youtu.be/mbh8JVn4aoE](https://youtu.be/mbh8JVn4aoE)
---
I found something a few days ago in a destroyed trailer. They appear to be drawings of ufo’s. I tried to look up info on them and came up empty handed. [UFO drawings ](https://imgur.com/gallery/0Z08NEG)
---
It’s a herding cane with a bell on it
---
I wasn't into them until I picked up a bloodied explosive gatling gun, THAT is pretty damn cool indeed!
---
Yes of course
---
I only eat raw when my bar is empty. And bodies.
---
You make a good point. That’s why I’ve been so leary of trading, so I only do caps. If they ask for trades I’ll just scroll by. Someone has a 3* Bloodied SS that I REALLY want, but they want trade. As much as I want it, I won’t bother. 🤷‍♀️  I’ll eventually either get it in game or someone will sell one.
---
I want this, but not until they make the white springs golf club a no build area. Until then, orbital strikes on all turret camps I see. Its the only time I turn off pacifist mode.
---
Ive already peft the world but i went back anyway and i couldnt see it
---
I'll just sent them a ticket and see if they can help
---
Degenerates like you belong on a cross
---
Maybe try going to one of the spots on the list and see if taking a picture will start it?
---
I wish I could scrap your wood armor.....I need wood to make my Shepard's Crook. It's pretty awesome...it does the same amount of damage as a Board.
---
High level too. More caps. They try and use the workshop spawn bug to repeatedly murder you and harvest your caps. Always thought PVE should not have PVP elements unless you purposely duel someone. Let PVP server be the place to murder people and wreck CAMPS.
---
Yes it does persist even after logging back in unfortunately
---
I killed 4 of them tonight...during the event, with a few other people. To me, it’s about the same as a Deathclaw. I love the Sheepsquatch!!
---
The more shotgun shells there are the better
---
Oh so I couldn't help you. I was think you could join me with new character, take camera and give me with trade then rejoin with your main character for take back your camera from me. I hope some ps4 player can help you..
---
I feel like I've read about this bug before, but am not 100% on that.
---
I would like to see this, but also faction wide bonuses for the server for how many workshops are held.
---
Playing on xbox. Belching Betty crashes my game everytime. I heard and I'm hoping it's an on again, off again bug. I want my excavator power armor damit. I got that sweet bone raider skin I wanna slap on that puppy.
---
SO REAL OMFG
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Creekside\_sundew\_grove](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Creekside_sundew_grove)
---
keep server hopping here, I've had megasloth, sheepsquatch, snally's all show up there fighting scorched or mutants.
---
They need something to make workshops worth to hold and contest. Right now, they are meh for the effort unless you have 8 hours to play in your session.
---
Id like to see faction bonuses server wide based on how many workshops are held. Gives a reason to want to hold workshops. 
---
Not really griefing as long as it is the intended way to PvP within the workshop... Not anywhere on the map.
---
I wax poetic about the early days at Whitespring. Crazy spawn rate, legendaries galore. Oh the good old days
---
Correction. Calvin of undisclosed mental faculties conspired with a natural gas company that employs assassins to build a horny anthropomorphic sheep/cryptid/robot and sell the family residence at prime market prices out from under his sister. 
---
Nope. Not any clearer.

It’s double xp on both modes til the 29th I believe
---
Occam's razor
---
Mine does that here and there. I’m wearing it now and it’s fine. Tomorrow it’ll probably be glitched again 🤷‍♀️
---
Rewards available for 500 atoms
---
No.  If it was true I would have been banned months ago making ammo for my minigun and .50 cal.
---
Gotta find it, you should build a assaultron for help (:
---
A full melee build requires every single slot in a 15 str stack.  Maxed 2h/1h/unarmed+ martial artist/Incisor/Barbarian (pick 2, or mix lower levels of cards). 
---
If you want a 2h primary build, you want all 3 slugger cards maxed, martial artist maxed (that swing speed bonus is CRITICAL on those slow weapons). That's 12. Fighting anything at all with armor? Incisor+a 2h weapon with a puncturing affect pretty much ignores 90% of it.  That's 15. Running a bloodied build, Barbarian can help keep you alive.  That's also 15. Pick your poison. 
---
Running a unarmed build, i'd probably ditch martial artist in favor of incisor and barbarian. 
---
 I personally run 3x slugger cards maxed+ martial artist+ incisor and rely on Dodgy+Serendipity to keep me alive, when I'm running a melee build. (I run a bloodied build with unyielding armor, and adrenal reaction, because if you're going to go glass canon, go full glass canon). 
---
A full shotgun build requires 12 points in str. 3x shotgun cards+scattershot. It's easy to toss the first rank of the melee cards in here for saving ammo on trash mobs when clearing out mixed zones. But again, you're not running a 2h as your primary in this case.  
---
Without perk card swapping, and if you have to swap perk cards mid-combat for your build to work...it's not a workable build, in my mind. Want to be fighting the queen, and have to go into your loadout and swap out cards every time she lands?  
---
I mean, you could fiddle around with 1/2 ranks in  shotgun and melee cards until you get a "kinda doesn't suck" build, but if you're running a weapon as your main, I personally want it to do as much damage as possible. 
---
You can, however, have a maxed out melee build WITH a very strong rifle backup with no problems.   
---
I run 9 perception, have all 3 rifleman cards. It's not a full rifle build, but it's perfect for a backup of my melee/putting crits into the queen/etc.  My Bloodied handmade wrecks face, one shots most non-legendary mobs with sneak damage. 
---
You could, fairly easily, knock that back further if you didn't want 9 perception and still do DECENT rifle damage with a fully kitted out melee main.  I wouldn't go lower than 4-5, for quality of life reasons (being able to have butchers bounty+green thumb on harvesting trips, plus being able to see way points).
---
yeah, I am, but I think i dropped them in mass before i posted. i'll go visit biv today, if i get it again, i'll let you know
---
This has been happening with all sorts of enemies recently, even base level ones like ghouls. I'll kill two then turn around to kill another and when I turn back, the first two corpses are gone.
---
I'm torn on this, logically we have the facilities to produce home canning, yet at the same time there are already a few means of producing canned goods in the game.
---
Same thing happened to me, but from a random one. It kept giving me the same one over and over again.
---
I’m fine with camp invulnerability as long as they add a bigger area around whitespring golf resort to stop people from AFK farming all the ghouls.
---
Every time someone’s got a turret base setup there I grab my Fatman and nuke it into oblivion
---
How much for the 1* ultracite laser and the 3* railway rifle?
---
There may be a cap ability in the nvidia control panel. Been awhile since I've been in there.
---
Yeah same, idk if it's in my head but I feel like it really helps
---
Your offers buddy
---
If I could also hop on this semantics train: it's literally as much an mmo as GTA Online.
---
Nice to see that all of you people telling us to leave for calling the game a scam are starting to come around.
---
I need it too but that's because my Fluffy quest bugged out and there's no way for me to complete it :(
---
I rarely take any hits there as ranged. Maybe use a single diluted stimpack per run if I'm not paying attention? I guess theres ammo to consider but that's really hasn't been an issue for me for a long time.
---
Are you talking about specific events here? Because I’ve found legendary drops to be the same and even had some great RNG luck the last couple days. But if it’s specific events I may be missing the point.
---
Wasnt me lol. My workshop is on my second floor with no windows.
---
Manbearpig, so cereal.
---
I paid 9000 caps for it, I have it because I'm hoping htey fix it some day =)
---
Also how do I repeat the burrows mission?
---
Daily rewards is the main thing that keeps me playing ESO
---
Thats a really good idea
---
When I was in beta I spent almost all my points on strenght because the 400 weight, then it took me lvl up a lot of lvls for rebuild my player
---
A lot of them did get banned, but hte damage has been done. Many of those caps found their way into the economy, and it's difficult for bethesda to track mass trades of caps.
---
Coward and scum, an award winning combination.
---
Well I’m glad this information exist I’ll try next time. Thank you kind reddit user
---
They didnt add the sheepsquatch because the arc isn't finished. Think for a second before screeching.
---
And read patch notes.
---
I might be one of your neighbors....if it’s to the South of  “The Vantage” at the aluminum deposit. I visit the Behemoth daily. Named him Shrek
---
Glowing mass weight isn't too bad with thru-hiker, but yeah, still not great. I mule it often even with that perk. Though, at least with glowing mass you can keep it on your character. Can't do that with hardened since it's technically junk.
---
No. I am saying that the development team sucks at creating fun events and that they need to go back to what the previous development team did with Fallout 4 and make farming legendaries fun again.
---
I think it’s really more of a preference. Neither developer makes games like the other. Love both companies but if I had to choose I’d side with ubisoft. Been supporting them as #1 since the first assassins creed game. I have put way more hours into Bethesda games, played all fallouts since then3rd and oblivion I played through probably 6 times. I just like ubi a little bit more
---
I had 3 level 200+ destroy my camp a while back. I was in it and heard a mini gun. I started downstairs to find my front door and wall blown off. I stood my ground and got some good hits in on him (I was between levels 50-60 at the time), but then one of his buddies came up behind me and killed me. Cowards. By the time I spawned back in my camp was leveled. They literally destroyed everything!  I was so mad!  And my camp was across from Pleasant Valley Station, tucked in the woods by the water at the time.
---
To be fair, I helped the player by destroying his camp. After the deed was done, he quickly fortified his camp to be better than it ever was before.
---
Nope.
---
What do you mean the "arc" isn't finished? The entire quest line was "Go here" "Find blacksheeps corpse"  I didn't even read any of the terminal entry's. You try reading something when there's 90 other people wanting to do the exact same thing. I could not have been more uninterested in who ever those people were.
---
I admit I got a little nervous when I saw "feature canceled" and thought oh damn, what did I miss?
---
What else is on the Railway?
---
The weather's getting nicer, so expect more campers.
---
Someone commented this and I looked, thought it was just some fine print haha
---
But I want everyone to see how awesome the TSE shotgun that I bought on eBay is.
---
750 for the laser
---
I did but where's the dead guy I need to find?
---
Have the devs fixed the game?  No, they have not.
---
How is a cap pool Bethesda trying to kill their game?
---
Yes im only getting like 380 on super mutants when last time it was bonus it was more like almost 500 exp per kill
---
People pay for them ??? LOL this game is fucked now a days
---
Lol I would never buy one but somebody wanted it
---
Maybe i slept and used inspiration.
---
The Trash can next to the jewelry store in the whitesprings is where I leave mine.
---
I honestly thought this game was going to be more like Elder Scrolls Online in the Fallout universe. THAT would have had me hooked daily for months. This game has its moments but it doesn’t really have a niche. It’s closer to Rust in a Fallout setting but without great Bethesda story telling or hardcore Rust mechanics.
---
So you legitimately hogged a terminal long enough to read everything?
---
Ok 😂
---
&gt; Ballistic fiber sheep fur
---
yup
---
There's 3 locations for the event.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bhd09e/detailed_info_on_the_new_event_free_range_spoilers/
---
I have a beautiful spot on the water above Fort Defiance, underneath the monorail level changer. Its a perfect spot for water, a little farm, the view of my favorite landmark, and I get to watch the scortch beast pummel the fort every now and then. Please stop finding my special spot &gt;D
---
Go into the data tab in your pipboy, find the quest (in misc?) and you can hide it.
---
Ballistic fiber kemp
---
Do u know the password?
---
This sounds fair to me. I was at every beta I could be at and stuck around but all the players who got it because the price dropped and they wanted a new cheap online game to play wouldn’t be thrilled with this at all. Bethesda has already gotten so much backlash that if they exclude players, in the end it wouldn’t go very well for anyone.
---
I was built just within render distance of him
---
ok cool let me know what they say, I will be interested. Seems retarded
---
Smells like fanboy here 😖
---
He's after the views let's be real people
---
I am indeed a fan of 76.
---
There is logic there and I find that distressing.
---
I think you'll find that he clearly stated he was NOT a crook.
---
There is strength in weakness, friend.
---
Would be nice if they specified somehow what they could be used on, I'm kind of holding out hope that Beth will patch it as usable by any set eventually.  I think there was even something specific to PA mods in this last patch that should have done exactly that.
---
His fans won't like this
---
So many other weapons drop as legendaries and have plans to craft them, in fact most, thats the whole idea of the system.  He wants to know if there are legendary versions of the staff that he can then mod with the things he learns crafting and scrapping the staff... once again like the majority of weapons in the game.  
---
I have not seen a legendary drop yet, but I have my fingers crossed.
---
❌ STILL HERE, COME JOIN ❌
---
So obnoxious. I guess I was just fortunate/naive not to have this happen until now.
---
Welp, I’m with you in solidarity, Wastelander. 
---
All of these positive comments make me want to start a gang - of dogooders.
---
Like, we could come to the aid of people getting trolled/griefed. 
---
We could like...respond to their troubles.
---
I know, we’ll call ourselves The Responders!
---
Yeah I just picked it up electrified Shepard’s crook or staff 😂 So you’re saying a bunch of nothin
---
Intense battle with a enemy you 1 shot or max 2 shot ? LOL
---
Calvin made the robot with mating protocol to attract the real sheepsquatch. The reason was probably out of his own interest as well as someone hiring him. Calvin didn't deliver so the hirer sent wolf to kill him and retrive the robot but got killed in the process. The robot is now loose and in fact successfully attracts the sheepsquatch we see now.
---
The motivation of the people who funded Calvin wasn't very clear.
---
I found a Mr. Shepherd earlier in the south along the end of the world. Says something is after is flock. I don't know what I expected to see, but it wasn't that fat, hairy bitch running at me.
---
I fought mine at beckwith farm
---
Not enough to know why the quote works as a reply to what I said since it wasn't an opinion.
---
Yeah I just picked it up electrified Shepard’s crook or staff 😂 I just said what it was and how I got it. No need for all the extra explanation.
---
And most of all, thank YOU sir! This one got me one, clicking off three Challenges in one go. Phew!  
---
Now I just have to find a Flatwoods Monster and an Alien. Oy!
---
Maybe someone can explain to me the draw to play a game where there are no interactive characters. I just don't get it
---
Additionally there was a WV PA skin that wasn't popular. Plus they have been removing items from the atom shop. Nuka Girl and Wildman tags come to mind. And there was a limited time camo bundle that amomg some regular items was a desert style camo PA skin.
---
Same here. Had it 2 days and poof! Gone! Was actually using it when I died. Respawn and no All Rise.
---
Found him along the end of the world fence in the south with a Mr. Sheppard  randon encounter.
---
My dad built a really cool treehouse in the Mire. It's actually really frustrating. Every time I visit his place gets cooler. I try to copy some of his ideas, then it just gets better.
---
Ah, man.
---
I hate missing stuff in games and event, not sure if I can start playing again.
---
Thanks for the info
---
&gt;If you enter a chassis with one already in your inventory, it duplicates the new chassis and your original is lost.
---
Holy shit really? I did this all the time when I was trying to find a specific set before renaming was a thing.
---
The camp invulnerability got delayed it is supposed to be coming next patch on may 7th I believe.
---
Ugh that sucks. I hope you can figure it out.
---
You can find it next to the Mothman museum. Where the eggs are.
---
Hello. I could craft a whole heavy leather armor set for you. With studded mod and whatever secondary mod you want.   I'm at work right now and won't be online for another 4 hours.
---
Here's how it should work:
---
When a contester contests a workshop, a warning comes up saying 
---
"You have decided to contest this workshop. Continuing will trigger defense event for the workshop's owner. Would you like to continue?" 
---
If continued, another message pops up on owner's screen (anywhere)
---
"A survivor is contesting your workshop. Would you like to transport to your workshop to defend it?"
---
If continued, the owner gets free fast travel to the workshop and the pvp is activated. If no, the owner relinquishes the workshop without pvp activates.
---
Workshop pvp is only restricted in green circle. Whoever stepsoutaide once entering immmediately forfeits the workshop.
---
Saw a random (?) Lv 80 sheepsquatch roaming the hills next to my camp just a bit ago, the Mire ain't safe no more boys
---
I had a few in The Burroughs do that. 
---
One fell through the floor, one disappeared and then a few moments later it was invisible but you could hear it and see the black dust/smoke from its footsteps coming toward me (it was relocating quickly like they sometimes do) and I was actually able to loot it as it walked by...presumably on it's way to it's spawn point. 
---
A third one I saw where it originally spawned from the floor when I entered the room and after killing it a few steps away from that point it disappeared and then reappeared at it's spawn point but the loot interface wouldn't activate.
---
This game is a real bugfest!
---
How dare people enjoy games
---
I bet they’ll sell you some load outs for 500 atoms each...
---
That guy, plus Super Spesh from Wolfenstein.
---
*Convoluted, complicated, yet fairly convincing monologue*
---
"All leading back to one conclusion... Fuckin' Space Aliens man!!!"
---
No you have to hit the same enemy. And can’t miss it has to be consecutive
---
How dare people defend and praise Bugtesda after all shit they do. You are the reason this game never will get fixed. Because they can do what they want and mess up
---
And still people praise them!
---
Ok, yes I went back and looked over the patch notes and it is not there. Bummer
---
I have it on one of my characters. I'll check the one I'm currently on but I fear it's on my 22. Correction, I read it and don't have an extra but I think I have the resources to make you one. Just need to find out which character has the ability.
---
We need them to think this is everyone's attitude and we're gonna get whatever we want.
---
500 would not be a big deal if chasing them for free.
---
I ran into a lvl 80 Legendary (they may not spawn as non-Legendary?) at one of the Random Encounter sites where I was hoping to come across something I could tame, sadly as level 121 I come up a bit short for taming a lvl 80 lol
---
I fully agree that it doesn't do as much damage as it probably should. I was only in crappy Excavator and even then it didn't do much damage to me... I don't think I had stopped to swap in Lone Wanderer either. A level 24 Assaultron's laser does more damage heh
---
But it did take quite awhile for me to get its health down, so I suppose the fact it didn't do as much damage as I was expecting is a good thing. Honestly though, at my level, I'd ***welcome*** something that would genuinely make me shit my pants coming across and send me running! At least it'd keep me on my toes, since the Deathclaws are sadly an underwhelming encounter in 76; no longer the fearsome creature of FO3 and NV.
---
Beyond that I am happy with it finally coming out :) Though, the "Sheepsquatch Skull" loot item would've been nice to have not been a Bovine skull :( lol
---
Top of the world. In the (dead)vendor area by the raider power armor
---
There’s a PSA right now that if you wait for him to spawn in before rushing to attack he’ll turn into a 3 star. Can’t confirm but it’s worth trying!
---
I don't feel like you should be rewarded for preordering a game, you should be taught a lesson (like FO76 did, with its release)
---
Yeah, I was disappointed when they announced the delay I've had my camp leveled a few times.
---
Camp invulnerability can't come sooner.
---
Be careful though because if you have locks on anything and someone lockpicks it that will make them 'hostile' to you and your turrets and give them Carte Blanche to destroy your camp.
---
I've had my camp destroyed about 10 times now since starting the game 2 weeks ago. It's always by players above level 100 as well. Have no idea why they attack my base either.
---
I'll give this a shot!
---
Yours dropped [Kemp's](https://kemps.com/)?! I'm not only jealous, but now a bit homesick T\_T haha
---
well you didnt really earn those items, so...
---
Next to the Mothman museum where the eggs are.
---
I set my camp up with a lovely fishing spot off my back deck in hopes of this one day being added
---
Where are you approx? I'm encumbered and it'll take me a while to get there.
---
I would also like to know what the benefits are besides looks
---
Southernmost part of the map. If you know where the Federal Disposal Field HZ-21 workshop is, go east until you just pass “dents and son construction”. Go a bit more east into the mountains. Iwas at the top of the mountains there when I came across it.
---
there should be 1 for free and then some amount of atoms each to add more slots up to five...
---
Honestly, bow would be the most immersive weapon for a post apocalyptic world. We just need them with proper mods and balanced/viable stats. If they add bow, I definitely will change build to make it my main.
---
what causes this bug? i just bought the game and now im worried i might lose any gear i grind for
---
I hope something like this is added. It would make it much easier and safe.
---
When I trade items for another item I usually have us both set the same price for our items so even if they do take the item without me getting the item I was trading for, I still get caps. If they don't agree to that then I just don't trade. Only once was someone mad and they tried destroying my camp.
---
Meat, the Mysterious Fur, a Sheepsquatch Skull, Large Sheepsquatch Horns, the obligatory Legendary weapon of random sorts, and odds-and-ends junk which I didn't bother to make much note of.
---
Given I saw a guy stroll into one of the events with a staff that had the Skull and Horns on the end (probably qualifies as a 2H "Hammer"), and the fact that the Skull and Horns are exempt from the Scrap All option (require manual scrapping), I can only assume that they are a requirement to craft that. Or that it's a Mod to the Shepherds Crook, in which case, still requires them to create.
---
Hope to see you there next week!
---
The known thing is not necessary, considering the known tag on plans and recipes, you just need a blueprints area imho. But I think they should move notes to data, instead of picking up scraps of paper that are apparently infinite in this one ex-american state, just have digital scanned versions saved on the pipboy of them, makes more sense realistically speaking, plus saves that precious precious space in your ¿pockets? I suppose.
---
Every post apocalyptic hell-scape deserves a man punching the ground and screaming, bad death or just at the maniacs that blew it up.
---
Thanks for this, I completely forgot I can force v-sync through the nVidia control panel!
---
That was a 1min clip I died once the sentry bpt helped me out i giess bc i came back and he was 1/4 health gone, but prior to that and ran back to him and sprayed him up  im not a lvl 200
---
Sir this is a video game
---
Somehow I don't see wood as resisting fire. (fire is energy damage)
---
Nope for me.
---
What the point to have more caps for?
---
Buying tse with 100k caps?
---
Yes, much less stable with patch 8 and 8.5 on PC here
---
Not others, me. 
---
From day-0 my character was a non-PA build, but since 50 I've spent pretty much the entire game stomping around in excavator due to carry weight and radiation resistance.
---
This would have helped even the gap on carry weight, and who knows maybe they'd release a hazmat lining later on. 
---
Instead it's just more time in the power armor because I've dozens of fusion cores and it's simply the better option.
---
I have the Sheepsquatch Staff. It's plan drops from the event. Rank 4 Makeshift Warrior to craft.
---
I'll take an anarchy symbol flag/sign/nuke.
---
So what i'm just expected to know where everything is?
---
I dont think there is a benefit
---
they grinded for the caps and bought it right? that means they earned it as far as im concerned. it's bethesda's fault for releasing a game with a bunch of easily exploitable glitches. wouldnt be worried about being banned either for buying one either otherwise i'd imagine theyd release every instance of the duped items and not just 1 of each.
---
How do you get the dense mod for combat armor ?
---
Unowned armor?  Are you dropping the armor? Or are you deploying it?
---
Just a collectors piece I would say, I keep my level 15 PA for my alt characters .. once you get past 25, you unlikely ever going to use it again. Level 15's are good to give to alt characters or other players. Someone gave one of my alt's a level 15, it was very much appreciated ..
---
Please give me the location of the Sheepsquatch so I can open him like a loot chest for hours for TES weapons.
---
Yeah, it kinda sucks that you have to be a lower level to get those to spawn.
---
The story isn't finished, it's ongoing. Maybe you should *read*. How do you play a Fallout and skip all story and lore?? Go back to fortnite.
---
I think its also the fact that most of the heavy hitter youtubers have given up producing content for the game, and investigating this stuff when it releases. 76 just isn't getting them views. I mean look at the wiki's, there a joke.
---
For example: Im googling around for awesome cave base locations, and there's maybe 3 people who have actively looked and posted results on youtube. I think its like 3-4 build-able caves found so far... but no one knows for sure, because not enough people care enough to hunt them down and make content about it. 
---
Like there is literally nothing we don't know about any other fallout game. Every inch of FoNV has a wiki page written about it, with origins referenced from previous titles. This one... its kinda like living in a time before online game guides! There's very little info! 
---
I think people have pretty much decided its pointless to make content a out if it won't garner views. Thats how poor public perception of the game is right now, and it makes me sad. There's a game in here somewhere, but there's a lot of bullshit (imposed by the game studio big wigs and marketing team) that's keeping people from seeing what's truly great in it. Its scandal after scandal, and people are fed up. I'm fed up. There's too much scandal in real life, why play a game that's got it too? Its too complicated, lets just all go play Call of Gears of Halo Theft Auto IX. People sick of all the little quirks you have to know to play the game.
---
Wish the bonus carry-weight didn't work in power armor.  This and a lead/hazmat lining under-clothing would basically make armored a reasonable endgame alternative to PA.
---
 There's no such thing. There is the BoS Mod for Combat Armor which works on Light Sturdy and Heavy Combat Armor, all of which have their own plans.
---
Try to read a story when you have a bunch of dipshits stomping around I'd pay 100 dollars just to get the map to myself. So if it's on going what's the point? My question is how are people spawning the Sheepsquatch?
---
i see.  I use the mod that allows percard swap.  So what you think isnt a good way works for me.
---
I got it and accepted it. You can join me any time and purchase your serums.
---
I can only see the numbers, so the calculation is guesswork. Each category of weapons has a "condition damage scale factor" table, which appears to use weapon damage as the input, generally lower input -&gt; higher value, but with weird bits. The numbers only make much sense if this scale factor is then multiplied by the weapon damage.
---
Played for a couple of hours with my bloodied shotgun character earlier, and I think I killed everything in the Ash Heap and Pleasant Valley without making much of a dent in the condition. I don't run Explosive though, so maybe something weird about how explosive works with multiple projectiles.
---
I chould care less about the story for this game to be honest I just want to play this game like a loot shooter.
---
when it arrives me and shia wanna see a pic of it with your fallout props !!
---
You can't read when other players are around you? You have more problems than finding Sheepsquatch. Anyway, the event Free Range in the savage divide or mire. Also a random encounter.
---
I accidently put an item in a key code locked safe earlier today and apparently those items just go into the abyss, so I guess I learned that today
---
pssssh we look forward to more journals !!!  journals &gt; holotapes
---
Disgusting. Go play BL2. Oh wait, it has a great story. Looter Shooter doesn't equal no story.
---
I got an Instigating one star from a ghoul at White Springs and an Assassins 3 star from a ghoul in a nuke zone (can't recall where)
---
i just received it. 1 acid 2 leather 1 mysterious quill 2 steel.
---
it does 149 dam. 3 poison? range 12. weight .25
---
i dont know what affects it yet.
---
it does count as craft grenades
---
Beta bois where you at?
---
it occupies a grenade slot
---
I'm not sure, but I suspect it does.
---
Still there ?
---
Me, I have them all.  25 caps if you supply the flux, otherwise 460 caps (it's what I sell them for at the robot vendors)
---
Oh my god. More complaining. You own a public resource, it's a battle for resources, defend yourself or die. Nothing wrong with that. It's literally a game about surviving the wastes. You think you can avoid every conflict?
---
I had a tse handmade drop then a couple of days later, a TSE pipe pistol. I never had anything TSE drop before then. I nodded the pipe pistol to automatic and have a blast destroying low level mutants and ghouls.
---
Adding you chinogarcia818
---
Pretty sure this is a repost
---
you can throw them and re pick them up
---
Having troubles getting legendaries from them? Probably because you tagged them too early, while glowing green and non-legendary.
---
they arc
---
Is anyone else getting mobs dying on entry to a dungeon/zone? I usually do a lot of clears at the civic center and the medical building in Watoga. They let out their death cry and that’s it. Every mob in zone is dead and un-lootable; they have died right in front of me on multiple occasions. If it’s a known issue and I missed it I apologize.
---
Real AF
---
See you soon!
---
Wait, they are selling babies in the atom shop? *shakes "ooohhhh bethesda" fist*
---
I actually I take that back. Technically 4 was my first, I played a 2 week trial of it in anticipation for the 76 beta. Lol. I just wanted a feel for the controls and the basics. Lol. But I watched my friend play a lot of 4 and it looks like a blast
---
I'm not refuting, changing, or otherwise denying my initial claims, that all still stand. You're ignoring the existence of playstyles that would take advantage of the addition of repair kits that have long been abused in games that offer similar pay for replacement methods.   
---
There really is no point in continuing this conversation, you have a hard bias against my argument, I get it, have a great life.
---
And happy cake day -))
---
Yep, til the post is edited otherwise.
---
Thanks took me like 5 server hops since I missed out on one at the sb queen.
---
i found the shard. its a poisoned throwing knife. decent damage. no perks effect it, it counts as a grenade but explosive doesnt effect it. maybe range sneak does
---
I’m wondering if we will ever encounter a herd of them....that would be interesting...
---
It's not about the workshop, You can have it.
---
It's the trigger pvp mode, then hunt the owner half way across the map to kill them and take their junk 20 minutes after activating dispute mode. 
---
Dying in defense of a workshop is one thing, dying because you own a workshop on the far end of the map that got overrun by mongrels an hour ago and someone wanted to kill you and take your stuff in not OK
---
+karma thanks you are the best!
---
YES. Game freezes or freezes the crashes to desktop. Not as much as what you are seeing, but mine seem to be related to using your pip boy to use aid items.
---
Everyone complains about everything everywhere lol
---
Hey wait now.  Let's not rule out micrometeorites as the true source of human testicles.  I didn't read the article, but pretty sure that is where this is going.
---
You’re offline, can’t join
---
I could live with that.
---
Was your camp way up the mountain next to a raider outpost jutting off the cliffside over nothing? If so, I’ve definitely seen your camp before.
---
Yeah, size of the deathclaw + horns, looks badass!
---
the shards damage is affected by adrenal reaction. nothing else it seems. sneak seems to do more damage but it doesnt register. snuck 75% of 62 ghoul and regular 50% of 42 ghoul.
---
Noice
---
Awesome! Can you send me your gamertag so I can purchase some from you tomorrow or this weekend?
---
The workbenches are the 1 specific place that PvP is a game mechanic in Adventure. That won't go away - otherwise there is no way for anyone to contest or claim a workbench that someone else might own (and no... server hopping until you find a server that has that workbench not owned is not a viable answer. It would only result in more lag and strain on the already tenuous servers). 
---
You honestly can farm more of the mats in less time by looting junk. If you don't want to take the chance that you may get killed by someone with a more PvP oriented build or better gear or stronger weapons or some combination thereof than just avoid workbenches. It states at the time of claiming that PvP may be initiated if another player contests it. That means at ANY time another player decides to contest it...
---
you can also re pick up a shard after hitting an enemy with it.
---
Was it Twin Lakes? I used to have mine there too.
---
Yea be careful.
---
Unless they have changed it, the owner is at a complete disadvantage, they are automatically in “pvp” mode where as the attacker is not, and free to one shot the owner while they can do no damage in response. I don’t mind having to defend it, but allow the owner an equal opportunity to kill the attacker.
---
Mine was working with the upgraded lens, 'q' button if i recall correctly
---
I came across two random spawns tonight.  Random because there were no other players around, and both times it was in combat with scorched and scorched beasts.  Both were 1 star and dropped junk loot.  Bones, quills, fur etc.  One dropped a 1 star Trapper limb.  My question about them is, are the random spawns like I found naturally enemies with scorched beasts?  One of the spawns was in the Cranberry Bog just a little south of Camp Venture near the fissure site, so it could be coincidence.
---
Maybe add this to Survival. 
---
Than that PvP could have more of a Team aspect. 
---
With the griefing thing, you are who you are, you play how You play. 
---
This would give All factions a chance to shine. From Original FalloutFactions to Player Founded Factions.
---
Give a new view and way to Commute with other players and play the game. 
---
People wanted a way to have a player hub right so why not with you faction right?!
---
I can't as I'm on PC, but when I got mine I server hopped at Wavy Willards and it was on a car right inside the parking lot.
---
Did you finish the quest and read the plan and add the 105mm lens? It should then be your VATS key when in your viewfinder
---
Think you have to mod the camera at the tinker workbench .
---
I wasted so much time trying to find a tourist that when I finally did I wanted to help as many people as I could get it. Finding one was a huge pain.
---
You don’t have to be lower level, I finished this when I was around level 80. If a lower level goes to whitesprings they will spawn the golfer ghouls. I hate to say it buts it’s all about your luck on a server.
---
Which pond is yours? Cause I am also on a popular pond...
---
I've got a one star anti-armor and it's pretty much the only gun I use, it's just that good
---
You can miss. But actually hitting another target resets it, or so I’ve heard (I’ve tested missing, haven’t tested hitting something else).
---
Mine's just southwest of Site Alpha. Where's yours?
---
Weird you don't have that weekly cause I still got it no way I'm going find the alien to take a pic of. Honestly 3 reasons I see Bethesda not fixing broken challenges is on consoles to apply the fix would probably be a patch and patches on consoles cost time for approval by Sony/Microsoft and money, they probably got small team maintaining this game so time crunch and maybe lazy and lastly like MegaBz been saying they want to avoid giving us free atoms so when cool stuff come on the atom shop we are more likely to spend $ on atoms then use free earned ones.
---
And as far as the owning but having it have been overrun type situation... A good idea on Bethesda's part would be a "relinquish control" command tied to workbenches. If you claim it and no longer want it then you should be able to ditch it. They could avoid abuse of this feature by making it usable at any time there is no defense event or when it is not being contested by another player. That would prevent server hopping and also help prevent the player hunting.
---
I won't go to Survival mode for this reason alone. What is fun about this?  Besides, I don't want to lose caps to someone who has nothing better to do that camp spawn points.
---
Give me the mats and ill sell em for 50c per
---
150 Atoms coming your way mr. loyal! :D
---
Maybe a better reward for spending 700 playing the game
---
I know but the story in fallout 76 has everyone dead. I just found him by the way he didn't drop any good items but a fly dropped a TS laser pistol but it was only level 25 Why did he take 200 rounds to kill?
---
You’re a disgrace to the mothman flair. We trusted you bröther, but you have let us down.
---
I have not run into this. Anytime (rarely anymore) that I have claimed one and another player tried to contest it they have been marked hostile to me and I could kill them. Possibly a glitch (and video/examples def should be reported to them to look into if so)...
---
My main issue has been getting them to spawn. Lately I've only been getting Deathclaws that scale to just above half your level, meaning you can only pacify.
---
I did manage to tame a megasloth at the bridge by the treetops today.
---
Total let down he was part of some big quest but they just have him as some sort of event.
---
Try again. Sorry.
---
I don't think you understand.
---
If you own a workshop and someone "contests it" this puts you into pvp mode with the attacker, wherever you are in the world.
---
If they walk out of the zone, or fast travel away, the claim fails, and the workshop returns to the owner. The attacker leaves pvp mode.
---
The owner stays in pvp mode until they DIE. 
---
The attacker can then approach you, anytime, anywhere, and kill you, you can't kill them, they have passive damage protection, the owner doesn't until the attacker attacks them. The attacker always has the first shot dealing full damage.
---
Your options to leave pvp mode are leave the server, or commit suicide and get your stuff back before the attacker gets to you.
---
Let us have pets Bethesda
---
Can confirm that the mod gives a 4x zoom.
---
Considering you seem to be shitposting, I would say your mind is made up.
---
Here's what I would do if 'ditching' was allowed. As soon as someone tries to take over my workshop, I would immediately ditch it, go to the workshop, see if he's joined in a party, if not, try to take over, and kill the invader. If the invader guy is smart, he would do the same and we will keep ditching over and over and pvp will not happen ever. There's no way to trigger pvp in fallout 76
---
Pretty sure the cap limit is there exactly so beth doesnt have to waste energy balancing economy (fine in my book). This way no matter how inflated, the most expensive craps would still be 25k. Or they can also implement barter trading so people can trade resources, which is probably a MUCH better fix than dealing with cap.
---
I would like  Carnivore ,  Chameleon ,  Electrically Charged,  Marsupial,  Plague Walker,  Scaly Skin,  Twisted Muscles, and if you have it Unstable Isotope, please. IGN:   
---
 Kobold4  
---
In game now, and for several more hours.
---
I have a zealots ** with faster fire rate and it puts out a lot of damage and really cleans up scorched. I'd be giddy if I had that drop for me. What lvl?
---
Like I said that sounds like a bug. Def should be reported with video/screens etc. I dont find benches profitable anymore so I dont bother with them but if it is occurring then that aspect would be a glitch
---
How about just mail us our canvas bags already?
---
You mean the one I bought on r/Market76
---
You're not spawning them yourself, ergo "a lower level to get those to spawn." 
---
I'm level 117, and still need 2 golfers.
---
There is talk of private servers that would be like that.
---
i just found toothed crook
---
...you still have to go into your menu and swap out cards, last I checked with that mod. It's just slightly faster. 
---
But yeah, if you're running something like that, standard build guides won't help you anyway.
---
They have been this way since launch.
---
Are you next to whitesprings?
---
Has never happened to me...  played most days of week, and since beta.
---
This is why it should only be usable when there is no defense event or player contesting it.
---
Just go stealth and find someplace to die. Attacker is the one in disadvantage since he's already used up his caps to contest your workshop.
---
doesn't matter what anyone meant.
---
everyone wanted repair kits.
---
bethesda obliged.
---
I think you can find the paint plans at Geafton Steal Yard i believe. Im not sure but if you look it up in youtube you should find out. Just trying to help
---
The attacker is hostile during the even to contest claims, but the attacker loses hostile status after the event fails, the owner doesn't and can be killed by the attacker any point after until they die.
---
I have never had it happen and I used to claim multiple wbs. Not saying it is not happening. Just that it hasnt happened in my experience
---
I also have the staff on both of my accounts
---
In truth, Metro 2033 was more correct about post apocalyptic currency.  Ammo would be the currency of choice.
---
I moved down by the behemoth because one of the updates made my spot unbuildable.  Was just NE of whitesprings train station by the yao gi cave and tick pond.  Sorry!
---
I'd love this as an emote and a photomode pose.
---
That's what I said. Two options, neither of which should be necessary solutions to this problem that should not exist.
---
Another post to add to my growing list of "random made up shit people said on reddit"
---
 Thank you. I will quest on. ;)

---
I'm intrigued.  What are these "friends" you speak of?  Please tell me more!
---
yes it is for running up on enemies mainly either shotgun builds or melee
---
Sadly, not the only feature from that game I want to see on FO76. A version of the market would be nice too, perhaps set up at the WS and managed by the bots there or in the bunker and managed by MODUS.
---
The sheepsquatch event really isn't that hard, especially since high levels are flocking to it atm, it's so much easier than the Imposter Sheepsquatch by a landslide
---
That is until it’s made a 500 Atom purchase
---
Well maybe it is intended. Maybe bethesda actually wants you to return to your workshop and try to defend it. Not just go like okay you can have it
---
Sure xx Dinkles xx
---
Ps4... check the subject line.
---
I know it’s. 2 days late. Instead of searching there for the BoS Plans, check Grafton Steel. Specifically the shelf to the right of the Power Armor Station that’s in the nearby building. 
---
Sometimes it’s robot, sometimes it’s Marine. 3 times RNG has blessed me. BoS Chest Plans + 2x Arms Plans.
---
Just enjoy it while it lasts
---
I find a lot of enemies teleport back to where they spawned in when they die.
---
Like, a legendary gulper hanging from a tree in gulper lagoon, lured it down shot it to death, then it disappeared, went looking around and it was back up in it's tree, dead, floating, but still lootable. Since then I always retrace where enemies came from when they disappear, and about 60% of the time find them where they spawned in. whether the other 40% disappeared altogether or I can't find where they came from / went, I dunno.
---
1. I don’t know whether it’s intended or not but radiation/legendary effect related benefits like bloodied are lost on respawn screen.its fine after respawn, but as the respawn does not take them into account game considers you as overencumbered forcing you to spawn at nearest location or vault 76
---
2. I’m talking about red tactical headlamp labeled as mothman headlamp. I think paint is fine
---
3. No this is new, they no longer die, they fixed it, but they can’t be milked. So ridiculous.
---
Well, here is what I figured out. It seems to only spawn for low-level players of the appropriate level of the quest. I watched white springs and when I saw low-level players there, I just did the normal Ghoul farming rounds, and there would be 3-4 of the level 9 unruly golfers mixed in. 
---
It only took me a couple of days after I noticed that, to complete it. There are often low levels being escorted by higher level players and at the camps out there.
---
What is your problem?
---
I killed one in my neighborhood today after herding some Brahmin.
---
Golf game 3-tap swing meter when you cast. Good casts pull from better loot tables.
---
Why don't you just not be overencumbered?
---
I just did a test run with a normal non-legendary shotgun repaired to 200%, using the same mods and the same perk card setup. It took 248 shots to break, more than twice that of the legendary one. Also the condition bar is a bit higher compared to the legendary one. 
---
My only guess is that the mini explosions from the explosive effect are causing it to degrade faster when it hits an enemy. Also there was a noticeable decrease in how often I would stagger and cripple enemy limbs, even tho I was using enforcer. Maybe since the mini explosions are hitting multiple body parts at the same time they are also decreasing the weapon durability faster, idk really.
---
Why go to scorched earth while overencumbered?
---
Some games are not fun to watch while someone is playing it. Fallout games are in the this category. So don't expect much views.
---
Do you mean sprinting not just running?
---
Bloodied build. Once I die, health regens and makes me over encumbered, sending me to vault 76.
---
Can confirm not true
---
Not true. Just tried it.
---
Also, scorched earth is supposed to auto spawn you in the area.
---
Santa's had bugger all luck finding them, and it's loe enough priority to skip getting the recipe and adding them that way,
---
If you don't want it, don't claim it. If you don't want to deal with the consequences of owning it, server jump after taking it or don't take it in the first place.
---
Lower the shadow distances from in the INI file.
---
The attacker doesn't even want the workshop in these cases. They want to kill YOU. In the event that inspired me to put this topic back up, they spent like 1 second in the workshop claiming it, then sprinted to my camp to kill me.  The workshop defense started and ended before the first line of text scrolled off the screen.
---
I could not have teleported to my workshop if I wanted to before it was over.
---
You expect something Bethesda says to be 100% accurate?
---
Nope. Learned that the hard way when some random jerk launched an orbital strike beacon on my camp and blew it up despite me being 100 levels lower and minding my own business.
---
I dont see it resisting melee (melee is woodcutting axes and chainsaws)
---
You can get a mod (Better Inventory) that lets you filter aid (food or crafted food) and then the spoil order is fine.
---
I've gotten an Electrified Sheepsquatch Club
---
I'm with you.
---
If you are a bloodied build you should have rads to keep your health for regenerating to much I keep my health around 60-80 the rest of my bar is rads
---

Oh yeah PS4
---
yes just sprinting but  say i am running up to a super mutant and he is hosing me with his minigun i will take less damage while i am sprinting up to him to hit him with my melee
---
It's double exp weekend that's going on now
---
Awwww I'm on PC
---
its double xp weekeend
---
Unyielding armor and nerd rage
---
How much you want
---
Doh I thought it was Easter weekend. My bad!
---
Evwrytime I see you post this Im going to upvote it!
---
PC master race...
---
It'll supposedly be out with patch 9 on May 7th. It seems to be happening a lot lately. I've lost two camps since Sunday so I have a ghetto camp in the Mire with just the necessities out til that patch.
---
This. This is why I love Reddit. Have an upvote.
---
Haha thanks man! Trying to help as many people as possible
---
Workshops should not be more dangerous to own in adventure mode than they are in survival.
---
carry less crap
---
You do the mothmans work.
---
It was really dark at night originally. People complained... it went to what it is now like a month after launch. I’m sad, I loved it before.
---
The real one can be found very easy. Go to the BBQ shack by pleasant valley ts. It will start an event called "Free Range". At the end if the event there is a guaranteed squatch spawn (boss spawn). If the event doesn't trigger on fast travel. Server hop.
---
Option 2. Looks like the squatch is on the spawn table for some locations that regularly spawn muties as a random event.
---
Stop hoarding shit
---
As is mine, but I still have to mitigate the rads taken during the event with radaway, or diluted rad away.
---
Take a peek at the Fallout 76 category...
---
If you use group xp and cranberry relish with sleep xp, you’re in for a treat. Whitesprings turns into the original white springs when it’s not nuked. I was getting roughly 600 per charred kill.
---
I use to live on that second one. Radtoads would spawn there every time I traveled to and from, and super mutants every third. Build accordingly. I managed to cram three floors into the space (the trees make it hard to do so), so I had a platform to kill the muties on the ridge above me.
---
Enclave back back but not one with the BoS logo?
---
That makes my character who’s role playing as a BOS sentinel sad.
---
My camp is a bunker and everything.
---
If they lockpick your door, they become wanted and can blow up anything they want because it’s involuntary pvp. Your best bet is don’t use doors.
---
do you own a workshop?
---
nope nothing. got a camp and nothing else on here.
---
So... you live in /r/fallout?
---
You could just not care that you die and don’t take junk with you then it doesn’t matter and you’ll respawn at the event my carry weight is around 400 lbs and I only carry around 300lbs of weapons armor and ammo/aid
---
400 lbs is 181.6 kg
---
Yes and that's why I suggested go stealth and move to other places. They'll never find you if you do that. Just die someplace safe and collect your junk. Bit of a hassle but the attacker will have lost up to 100 caps. Could be a problem if they teamed up and one of them's close to you but never had that happen so I can't tell if that's actually a problem
---
Use the keypad doors maybe
---
when?
---
He just wants to shitpost and go back to r/fallout and spank his hateboner.
---
Had it happen a couple of times. But not like some here are describing. I had maybe 3 this week not drop legendaries and that's assuming they didn't spawn in super late.
---
I leveled up like 12x on survival... was kind of annoying tbh lol I'm starting a new character tomorrow
---
Holy shit...
---
I just ran through whitesprings after someone nuked it the legendary drops where double for me
---
Well, with new content appearing regularly, probably drawing back some of the fence sitters. I noticed that the media coverage for 76 is finally starting to chill a little, barring a few traditional outliers.
---
This.  I was killed the other day when bulking junk atc train station... won't be doing that gain
---
If you need T-51 shocks in happy to craft them for the materials. Ign is thorofasgard.
---
Whoopsies is radant. Unsure about jelly fingers but I want to say that's from the bog.
---
Ironically.
---
They even made a fun phone game, fallout shelter
---
You did nothing wrong. Wasteland is not the place for cowards and weaks. Only strongest Vault Dweller can rebuild a better America!
---
Don't forget the currently cut but in game files "President" stuff. Considering it's not out and has not been announced, I suspect it'll come out eventually, and I suspect it'll be enclave themed up the wazoo.
---
Being killed isnt the issue, junk isnt really the concern. It's the amount of caps to fast travel all over the damn map when there is spawn points all over the place. This was a big before and it was patched, now seemingly (like many others) its back.
---
And I used scorched earth as an example, since it normally auto spawns you back into the fight.
---
Theres also another random encounter that has dead brahmin and a possum
---
I had two spawn in, a 1 star and 3 star. Was a lot of people there, and it was delightfully hectic as hell. Think we had all of half a cow left at the end.
---
Added
---
I've been trying to up vote every time I see you doing this too
---
I'm still not sure if its brown or black
---
Can you post pics?
---
Combat Armor with fall damage reduction?  Combat Knives with swing speed?
---
It's part of the game.
---
Owning a workshop opens you to pvp regardless of shooting back.
---
Part of owning a workshop is defending it. Both from pve events and pvp attacks. 
---
No exploits used. No bugs (unless they don't intend it to extend to bases but with turret bases a thing, I would assume it does).
---
I lost nothing of value when this happened to me.
---
I was at my camp, knew it was coming, made preparations, and tried to fight.
---
Lost horribly because passive mode no damage to the attacker... Oh yeah, forgot that. Got gunned down by a high capacity bloodied handmade. 
---
My problems are my problems. I could have left, should have, didn't by choice.
---
\---
---
The problem is that this exists, and nothing in the game prepares you for it. It is ridiculous that it has existed as an exploit since the game launched and has not been addressed. Survival mode workshops are safer than adventure mode workshops. That is complete nonsense.
---
I would prefer getting drills honestly. I just find armors every damn time
---
Oh you're no fun at all ಠ_ಠ 
---
Here, take my downvote
---
With that said, in patch 9 with the vendors update, they are removing the ability to destroy bases if you are not hostile towards the other player.... Unless you own a workshop
---
If the rumors are true about the explosive effect multiplying per pellet, then 248-&gt;105 wouldn't be unreasonable on the true damage output. I haven't seen any evidence either way on explosive shotguns though. The ESM doesn't cover much of the algorithm, and I don't have an explosive shotgun to test.
---
The 50cal vs handmade numbers are bugging me anyway. Should be closer to 3x the lifespan rather than 6x, unless the 50cal's condition bar is twice the size.
---
Just a tip, the zoom button is mapped to the VATS button. But if you've remapped VATS, the menu prompt won't update accordingly - like it still says Q for me on PC after I remapped VATS to something else.
---
This happened to someone I traded with too.
---
By this point I had fully lost the workshop to her.
---
Working fine
---
Make a PB&amp;J sandwich without a condom?
---
Remember kids, always use protection
---
I never go back to my camp after hunting down wanted players. I always wait for at least half hour as I don’t want them following me and destroying it
---
I understand your frustration. I'm just saying there's an effective counter to that exploit. How workshop takeover works is a bit weird indeed.
---
I appreciate that!
---
And I very much appreciate what you're doing for people.  You rock dude
---
A single piece of armor for invisibility VS an Entire set of armor needed to make a mutation work. 
---
The single piece wins out purely cause you can actually use better legendary effects
---
&gt;I have Drum mags on both the Handmade's so they hold 85 rounds for fire power, and a Perforating mag on the Combat rifle for maximum armor penetration with it holding 80 rounds (85 with Stinging, but with less armor penetration).
---
Um... my CR doesn't hold 80 nor 85 rounds... more like 25 or 30 maybe...?
---
But the mutation you can be standing. Meaning sentinel can be active.
---
Just happened to us too? In freaking Adventure Mode!? Wtf? Dude go over to Survival that’s what it’s for? And he’s not even wanted? What the heck?
---
Went to the NAR repair yard for a distant thunder quest. Horde of scorched, mole miners and the sheepsquatch!!
---
Soooooooooo sick of that song. Actually, I'm sick of them all. Need a radio mod.
---
Thanks man!
---
Cap limit is fine. We just need some use for them. Make it so that legendary vendor require you to pay caps every time you roll
---
It's all good.  Enjoy that double xp!
---
The game sucked at launch, It's way better now though, we'll see if that opinion changes at the end of the year.
---
Also, for somebody who doesn't like this game or whatever you spend a lot of time here.
---
Nah I'm up near Black Bear Lodge. Found a nice spot where I can extract Lead and Junk.
---
Is there a mod that does it without having to enter the perk card menu?  That's the biggest pain.
---
Woopsies from mirelurk spawnlings was it? Talking about those little mirelurks queen keeps laying. Jelly fingers from stingwings
---
Biy the eggs in bulk so u can still get the bunny rabbit mask ? Is that what ur saying?
---
Yes. Just killed him creeping around my Camp at Whitespring.
---
I never said i dont like the game. One of my favorite games. Just so fed up with bugtesdas shit
---
i think its time for you to put the game down and move on!!!!, why are you so salty, if they something good BGS needs to know it, just like we let them know when they fuck up or did you not see the 1000000000 million post about the repair kits. 
---
bye felicia!!!!!!!!!
---
Drugs from bunker can be useful. Dont know if thats the only place they can be found though
---
You just missed her on my server.... killed her maybe 10 min ago
---
Next time server hop and don't bother with it. Live to see another day. If PVP is about to go down I bail, later! 😊👍
---
My experience is the same. The chance of a lower level entering that area of WS first appears to be absurdly low.  Getting the kills before someone else does even lower.
---
 This is a design flaw IMHO and once the thousands of other flaws on the list are fixed, they should adjust this one.
---
Like 200 feet West of Firebase Hancock.
---
You’re familiar with Perk Loadout Manager then?
---
I’m not even sure it’s possible to do that, and from what I remember, the maker of PLM deliberately keeps it the way he’s made it to keep it from being *Too* advantageous. As it is it only takes like a second to swap perks. 3 key presses about as fast as you can hit them.
---
you participated in hunter/hunted?
---
Both of them are garbages.
---
I assume you mean the mutation serums.  I'm almost certain they can only bought in the bunker.  MODUS also sells the recipes to make them, not sure if SBQ still drops them.
---
No , drugs - psycho , grape? Buffout resipes
---
Good points. I'll try it after Patch 9.
---
Oh, OK, didn't realize they were there.  Exactly the response I was looking for, thanks, I'll check it out.
---
Strange to see that we don't play the same game, yet you are here on this sub. This is actually how upscaling works, and OP har probably done it in a group with high levels.
---
If you can honestly say that you haven't seen green glowing legendaries gaining stars over a short time, then i can honestly say you haven't played much.
---
I have 950h ingame and not sure if i seen em drop. Atleast i bought em from bunker , med vendor i think
---
Any junk piles? When i get higher level i want to explore that area. I have been playing since beta but have been remaking characters a lot. Cant wait to actually play past level 30 lol (only 17 atm).
---
You can. They just cant follow you around outside your camp.
---
Ha 
---
Ahaha
---
Hahahahaha 
---
I don't have any locks so I should be ok. I have had too many little bitty buttholes harass..one got mad because they couldn't hurt me after they were welcomed into my camp so they popped one of my balloons (what a badass btw ) and it made them wanted then I logged off and left them with it. After I did that I thought about it and I could of killed them and got the reward but it was too late after that..lol.
---
Gotta so whatcha gotta do my dude
---
I just use good doggy and carry my 35 cans of dog food with me. Lol!
---
Happened to me a lot, I could only respawn to the closest location of my death location
---
I just got it. It's about as dark as grey can get without being black.
---
Tanagra Town pretty reliably has one. Also, there is a crater "arena"  north of Fort Defiance and south of the Raider menagerie that random spawns a mob vs mob battle. It often has a megasloth vs Super mutant fight. 
---
Ok. Ok, I admit it. I pick off the muties and leave the sloth alone. I can't kill something so cute....
---
That occasionally happens to me.  Exit out of Fallout 76 and reload it.
---
Do you have the mutation that shocks when being hit?
---
Right after I get a damn dog!  No Dogmeat is my biggest grin with this game. 
---
Who's a good boy? Yes, you are.
---
Getting the most out of that though requires Weightless/Sent/Assassin gear, which if you can get, is going to be very pricey. Even just weightless/Sent is expensive. You’d still be better off with 4 Assassin pieces and a Chameleon piece, since not being seen is your main form of defense anyway, and staggering will knock you out of Sentinel anyway. 
---
If you got the extra funds for a God set of armor, The mutation is superior, but for a normal person, well, it’s just easier to go the armor route and just be careful.
---
when I had my camp on the one of the green at whitespring I had a group of three 200+ roll up and just start chucking those enclave ICBM grenades at my camp, we went back and forth killing each other, they lost more because when it all started I had 200 caps. When it ended I had closer to 2k and they left me. 
---
Tore my whole place down but I got em good.
---
So real, that if it kills you in game, it kills you in real life! And vice versa.
---
Who’s tryna OD on Bufftats with me?
---
Scaly Skin serum delivered. Thank you for your purchase. Enjoy!
---
The only reason I don't ditch everything else in favor of the .50 Cal is just because Stabilized requires PA to work, if it worked with normal armor I would just go heavy guns all the time. Idk how long it lasted before the durability buff but it's absurd how long that gun lasts now before needing repair, specially considering that I don't slot gunsmith or luck of the draw when using it.
---
It's not a terminal option, you need access code &gt;!from the butler-bot in the other room, near the piano.!&lt;
---
Wendigo has been found quest starts outside the Southern bell motel
---
Just got the plan for the Quill dart. Kind of not worth it compared to the throwing knife but it’s cool. 
---
Any stats on those weapons? Wondering how cool the club looks
---
Not everyone is on PC.
---
Yeah who needs power armor when you've got powered intestines.
---
I will definitely exit. Reload? maybe
---
it just works
---
Yeah, devs made this in Rust, penises everywhere since then.
---
Thank you for the recommendation BustedChain!
---
Good job..I avoid the pvp. I only killed one player. I wasn't very high level but I went and dropped off some purified water for a new player and left. The player followed me back to my camp, it was close by, and got mad cause the door was locked lvl 3 so they started shooting up my camp and then I realized hey I can stop this so I shot him and he died. Then he came back so I did it again. I looked on the map and he was just down the road so I killed him again due to his being wanted. He left after that. All the other times I just log off.
---
How does your game look so good???
---
Thank You!
---
How do you learn the plan for these so called radshields if you don't mind me askin ?
---
This is why antibiotic resistant germs.
---
&gt; Oh you're no fun at all 
---
Yeah, well, you know, that’s just, like, your opinion, man.
---
i wouldnt mind that, but i hadt to pay close to 75 caps to spawn and then get me to were I was. just crazy.
---
If he has a hotkey, he's on PC.
---
It's part of one of the free states quests, it's been so long and I can't remember but I'm sure google will be able to answer.
---
Fair enough, but console players might a similar function for this aswell
---
Happened to me with a behemoth as well
---
Looks like you are at the Main Menu. I tried to send you a team invite, but you must be AFK. Just find me on the server anytime and you can purchase your serums. I carry a stock of them with me as I play so I can trade on the fly.
---
It is bethesda game, everything is possible....
---
Exactly right! The Wasteland favors the bold!
---
But this is Reddit, so you get a down vote for bad grammar... 😜
---
Exploiting it somehow..
---
Unfortunately, avoidance is really the best way.
---
Even if fighting back got me caps and catharsis it still cost me tons of junk and hours of time, my camp is far too complicated to do the ole 'move 5 feet and all is repaired' move. So anytime my camp is destroyed I have to either repair or start over.
---
Patch 9 couldn't come faster :/
---
They really never unbanned your main? I guess they're is no hope
---
Well they're console players, should help them by giving them an automatic toggle, just like auto aim, except, auto eat.
---
I've had this game since launch and I've seen some crazy shit while playing it. 
---
Never once have I seen a no star change to a 3 star or a 1 star turn into a 2 star.
---
Killing countless Legendarys to get more than a one star item isn't fishing?
---
Agreed
---
I got plans for a burning barbed sheepsquatch staff
---
Yes you are correct, lol. They could easily make a quest were walk from White Springs to Harper's Ferry over-encumbered and get the extra weight badge (plan), Fight 5 Hermet Crabs and get the Armor plating badge (plan), Freeze 5 differnt animals with the Cryolater and earn the refrigerator badge (plan), etc. I'm hoping this is how they roll it out and not do some randomly generated task and get a completely randomly generate reward.
---
I prefer him to an actual Jahovah's Witness.
---
Not having to crouch is a benefit. On a full set the armor itself not having weight also saves about 30 pounds of carry weight, which is not too shabby. The mutation behaves a little differently. Things go all black and white when it prices. If you can get a set of good 3* it’s absolutely viable. 
---
I have a full set of weightless/AP refresh heavy/sturdy combat armor on my sneaky rifleman. Chest is 3* with junk weight. Rest is 2*. Just testing it. Took less than     two days and about 16k caps finding the set on PC market. Will try to find 3*s in time.
---
My camp is near Groves Family Cabin in the far NW near Aaronholt Farm. The Free Range event was triggered when I spawned into my camp. A bunch of us joined the event and there was a Sheepsquatch when we finally herded the Brahmin to the farm.
---
Inert flux also becomes a beverage! No HP but it restores water, haha
---
The fuck are you smoking?
---
First of all that's not how enemy scaling works, stuff doesn't spawn at one level and then spontaneously change to a higher or lower level when someone else shows up.  Unless you're triggering brand new spawns anything already present will be at the level they spawned at when the last person passed through.
---
Second, that's not how legendary spawns work.  When a legendary enemy spawns they're just your standard vanilla enemy.  Then they get the green legendary mutation aura and get assigned the legendary loot pool and change name to match.  After that they're done.  There's no secondary mutations or additional stars suddenly popping up.
---
Goes down smooth.
---
Yeah it's really annoying, especially with the fissure sites since the Scorchbeasts will always find me even though I'm crouched with chameleon armor
---
Agreed.  It's absurdly bright.  People afraid of the dark need to go back to hello kitties island adventure.
---
I will do that then :)
---
Seems a bit overly entitled.
---
Still having an issue with Mire dailies not activating for me. Going to various parts of the mire by walking or fast travelling does nothing. Going to where the dailies start does nothing. Been going since at least that patch that mucked tons of peoples dailies. Since then Everywhere activates except the Mire. Although some days Savage Divide does not, but its only a few times. And I have to manually talk to the police chief in watoga to start his, no telling me to visit him. If I could at least manually start the Mire ones, I could tolerate, but weeks now with nothing.
---
yeah samething I said great now I have to fight ah SB, to my surprise I spawn and so did 3 SB. lol
---
How about everytime I spawn in to play it says "i need required ammo" but I have a full clip and bullets in my inventory... anyone else?
---
what do you think P2W is. to get ppl to use/buy atoms.
---
Sure :) I'll be on tomorrow
---
a piper following me around in nothing but leather armor would be nice too. it gets lonely in the apocolypse.
---
Bro what the hell
---
Would you eat a half-cooked hamburger?
---
nice, but damn you are fat as hell bro, you need to do a diet and some exercise, I can help you with your training with caps or trades. lol
---
If he didn't have bounty from it and you lost caps, you did something wrong.
---
Oh... 😅
---
Free Range is also in the NW Forest and has one Sheepsquatch.
---
Don't even touch the radio in any way
---
Good to know, thanks. Is that just the random encounter?  Also is there a map key for random events?
---
I loved how you have to look up on internet to solve like every quest in World of warcraft, then there were some crybabies like this and boom, World of warcraft is now like diablo for kids.
---
Nope no defensive mutations
---
Ah you proved me wrong😂
---
After seeing the mirelurk queen explode with relative ease... man, I feel like I'm playing the game wrong at times. Heh.
---
I'm glad they unlocked Sheepsquatch without announcement. It seemed more exciting that people were just able to unexpectedly run across it.
---
Yup this sucks i also seem to be getting legendaries that turn back to normal enemies when they die or some legendaries just dont spawn anything on their bodies, sometimes it takes a lil bit to spawn the item on some bodies but ive waited like 5 minutes before and no item popped up then the body just houdinis
---
It all depends on what magazine or food, theres a little timer icon that I believe is on minutes. Some buffs like bobble heads will say when you activate it.
---
I love captainoobs videos don't meme it lol.
---
Also yeh stealth nerfs happen but what can we do complain that they are doing something when only they know if they did or not.
---
They can just say huh we didn't do shit and we have to accept it until bgs announces it we can't bitch about it and flood the community with this type of post. And the drill is mint go the fuckn Stanley good ol Aussie drill 😎
---
Is that from the new event?
---
How much lower do you recommend?
---
I have no friends
---
He got bounty, but he left before me and my friend could honestly react. I was way more focused on getting the junk I was trying to sell at the trader. Besides he killed 2 other dudes outside of white springs that weren't with us, so it couldn't have just been us with the issue
---
Evidence to the contrary  [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/416300047](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/416300047)  Just watch it for 10 seconds..  
---
Starts with 0 stars, then one then three. This is very normal behavior on PC.
---
I'm afraid nobody knows, but honestly don't worry about it, it's extremely rare and ultimately nearly every item is replaceable, especially when you're just starting out
---
What system and what do you want?  Im low level (54) but would like a few expensive camp plans if youre after cosmetics or bos gear.
---
The statue just wants to be fabulous, whenever i activate mine i lowkey hope for the purple squares
---
Idk, I was in the mood to stream tonight and streaming the new update sounded fun.
---
Great, my name in-game is the same as Reddit so give me an add
---
What level? And how much does it weigh? I'm not running a bloodied build so that doesn't help me much, but I'm all for swapping if it reduces weight in my stash.
---
Get pics!
---
That’s why. I based there and got raided almost daily
---
WHAT?!They're not in the Atom Shop?God damnit Bethesda ,what are you doing.You add shitty power armor paint jobs , but for once you don't actually add something useful...
---
Same
---
I really dont know what the value is for all the items and legendary's i come across.
---
Is there a website or something that has a list of the items and the average price of wich it sells ingame to other players to get an insight on this?
---
Yea I’ve seen a few shotguns with this, I assumed it was just a specific stock mod that makes it camo. Didn’t even know it was a shop skin
---
None whatsoever. I don't expect to ever get it back so I'm moving past it. I've already missed all the atom store stuff I wouldve wanted in the past 2 months. so the new account is the only account I guess.
---
I don't know how some of the absolute meaningless bullshit on this sub gets so many upvotes, but playing a fucking MMO with your friends is still broke as fuck and any time someone mentions it, it gets not attention. 
---
FIX IT. Let me invite a fucking RL friend to my friends list, and have them show up. Make it so when they are online, they show as online. This is shit that was perfected in 1995. Diablo mother fucking 1 had this down. Come on. It's not an MMO without reliable multiplayer. I should have to rely on Twitch or some other program to know when my friends are playing. 
---
FUCKING FIX IT.
---
THIS! It's been bugging me for quite some time, i ended up making a playlist on spotify to listen to instead
---
What platform are you on? I use this outfit on PC from time to time and it glitches sometimes (just as you described), but mostly everything is fine.
---
I got a 3 star mutant combat right arm with sentinel and radiation resist on my first event.
---
What they should do is place some guaranteed spawns that bloom around each Heart of the Swamp event.
---
Find a guild, join it, then you have buddies to help you out when people attack you or your workshop.
---
I have an extra white russian recipe if you're on PS4. I need a lead champagne bellini and tick blood margarita if you have it. It's funny white russian is actually the one I've gotten the most duplicates of... that's RNG for ya.
---
Jeez that’s sad It seems to only happen with the Appalachia radio not the others so I just live with it and listen to classical (so I can tell myself that I am an intellectual)
---
I just had this encounter, right outside my camp!
---
crapy 10mm submachine. 
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/ivTSPmc](https://imgur.com/a/ivTSPmc)
---
Well what color is coal
---
If I could send you an invite, I would. We'd be friends, if BGS would let us. 
---
It's BGS fault you have no friends. Get a guitar, make a deep meaningful song about it. Make it hit #1. Get laid a lot, make tons of money, make friends with all the connections your new found fame gets you.
---
But most importantly of all, bring it to BGS' attention that the multiplayer functionality of their multiplayer game is broke AF.
---
Whoops. I forgot.
---
End game/high tier mats should be easy to farm and last for ever. 
---
How fucking stupid of me.
---
I'll sell you one on PS4 if you're still looking. Would also trade for a lead champagne bellini or tick blood margarita.
---
I just sort my aid items by spoil and scroll to the bottom of my list, a bit tedious but it works for me
---
That might have been mine! Was it Morgantown Station? If so, you're welcome :)
---
Wonder if that was mine haha
---
i’ve never seen that one, looks really cool. loving all of the new random encounters they’ve added to the game, hope they keep it up with the new stuff because i’m always excited to find new stuff that no one’s mentioned before
---
Have you only been getting Tipsy Taste Test since you've had almost all the recipes? I always used to get wasted on (which never gave duplicates) but now that I only have two left to get I've gotten tipsy taste test 6 days in a row, which almost always give me a duplicate.
---
3000 is fine.
---
Did some testing tonight, and can say it's that they're being used up, not just disappearing. Three VATS clicks drains the fusion core enough to cause the marker to move on the fuel gauge. That is not even in combat, attacking, or moving. This seems much higher than it used to be!
---
Not needing them for range (esp stealth sniper build) is irrelevant. There's lots of ways to not require stimpacks, but your statement of requiring lots of them them for melee is explicitly false.
---
\&gt; Maybe use a single diluted stimpack per run if I'm not paying attention?  
---
I also added a couple other statements too: Because if you're playing stealth you're explicitly playing slower than someone sprinting in through the silo and honestly melee requires significantly less attention hence the 'easier' part. 
---
That being said, its not necessarily more fun, which is the most important part for a player. YMMV there. I've got stealth ranged builds too-- they're just not my silo runners. . . where I literally sprint through the silo.
---
I clipped this behavior for you, starts with 0 and gaining up to 3 over time [https://clips.twitch.tv/UnusualProudWolverineVoHiYo](https://clips.twitch.tv/UnusualProudWolverineVoHiYo)
---
Nope. Again, you don’t understand my point. If you’re just going to keep telling me that I don’t know that fun is subjective (duh), then you might as well save your breath. You’re just not getting it. Nor do you have to. It’s funny that you keep downvoting me though... maybe that will make you feel better. Bye now.
---
I dont care about the votes. Since English isn't my main language.
---
Possibly. At some point my controller died, so for a good 60 seconds my gatlin plasma was firing straight into the sky while i went into panic mode trying to hook up charger lol
---
Been there too trying to find the BoS plans. 
---
Mostly gone and server hopped on the prison as it's location is bit easier to get to. But also tried to Grafton Steel. To me that is slower with the number of Super Mutants that come at you. Yes I can kill them in one shot, but there is so many of them.
---
Will give the Steel another chance as the prison is not giving it's secrets to me. 
---
On A side note have also tried few other locations and server hopped. Seems I have bad luck on the plans, but on other hand I usually run into legendary mobs just about anywhere and get tons of 1\* wood armor pieces.
---
I KILLED THE FUCKING SHEEPSQUATCH
---
I think the limits in Fallout 76 was due to design choices.   Many MMO have housing as instanced which drastically reduces resources required.   They only need to render them and track them within that and only when people visit them.   However in Fallout 76, they made housing available anywhere.  So it has to track everything for everyone at all times (Or at least when people get within eye-sight of the location).
---
I think what they should do is impose a bit more restrictions on players homes.  Like "Town" locations where players can build houses on plot areas like the settlements in Fallout 4.   Sure more restrictive but I think it should free up more freedom to do stuff like you mentioned above.
---
They can still spawn in waves of mobs to attack these towns inside the instance if they want. (Like in fallout 4)
---
Nope. But the stations are the best place to leave things, so good on ya.
---
I got it at the Mire one, it was a reward for completing the event
---
My sister has a lead Champaign. She got it yesterday. I think she kept it. I can get that to you tomorrow when she’s on.
---
I have problems where it won't let me respawn, so I'm stuck looking at my corpse until I leave the server
---
I don't even see gunfu equipped in your build? Lol
---
That's a client/server lagged correction issue. Server side, the enemies were already dead/cleared by another player, but the client loads a fresh default state first, then updates to what the server says happened.
---
Its not really a bug. You probably entered when the enemies were on respawn cooldown / spawnblocked.
---
When you attempt to claim a workshop a warning pops up telling you it opens you to pvp and you have to agree in order to claim. If you don't want to pvp either don't claim workshops or leave server straight after you've done the challenge. They were playing the game within it's rules so there's no grounds for complaint.
---
meat makes mutton chop, 10% melee damage, 15% food.
---
Yeah
---
Yep I have had same bug was running sewers for shit the other day and it kept making me respawn only at cliffwatch and my base is right up the hill from it sucks to be forced to spend caps to travel when you shouldn't
---
Yeah it sucks.
---
Now that it's a bitch
---
Hopefully this is something they will fix. Hopefully pocketed peices will also transfer their bonus as well.
---
Hey all, haven't played 76 in months after my initial binge.
---
I'm planning to start a new toon focusing on laser/plasma weapons. Has there been any significant fixes/buffs to energy weapons, and if so, are they now fun to use and viable?
---
Loves to do it when the imposter sheepsquatch or SBQ is about to die
---
This means you can do backpack + excavator PA :O big carry weigh buffs
---
This is new for.me too, also found even some legendary sheepsquatch while looking for a single megasloth that never show up lol
---
I think it is just one of the trees without the leaves
---
It should have it, I haven’t played in months but The build usually revolves around gunfu
---
For food/drinks who spoil by condition, other like chems/consumables/alcho dirnks/etc. alphabetical order would be ok.
---
Took 20 minutes. Rng can be a harsh mistress
---
does the same thing on xbox ...sometimes ...sometimes it doesnt
---
Damn now I need a drill
---
Eagle Eyes, Electrically Charged, Herbivore, Marsupial, Speed Demon, &amp; Unstable Isotope.
---
Electrically Charged, Grounded, Marsupial, Speed Demon, Twisted Muscles, &amp; Unstable Isotope.
---
"...a stone's throw away..." 
---
I see what you did there. Well played.
---
It makes no sense to keep you in pvp mode for the duration of the stay on that server. Thats why i server hop after succesfull missions. not worth getting shot by a random. I enjoy the plans you get tho.
---
From my experience 1-2 hours
---
I find I can do the SBQ approx 50% of the time with no problems. I have a Ryzen also. In fact just finished a real intense one and it ran no problems. Other times it will do as you say.
---
I'm not sure if it the game or the servers or my internet or etc etc.
---
I'm thinking it may be just luck finding a compatible server that is running well atm.
---
Right!! I mean logically it would make waaay more sense for underarmor to work that way than a backpack would.
---
Remember : ONLY COSMETICS
---
Awesome, thanks. Just make sure it's the bellini specifically, I have the regular lead champagne. Thanks either way!
---
I had a survival server earlier do an SBQ and not a single player kill afterwards or around the nuked zone/watoga
---
They're in the medical wing
---
Oh that actually makes some sense I think it’s more common when I kite an enemy
---
That's normal, afaik. Also gives 5% disease resistance iirc
---
Let's hope they fix some of the missing underarmor linings too. I can't find the last two for casual armor.
---
You guys probably don't remember leaving your PC afk, turned to corner, behind vendor, crouched, increasing your sneak skill.
---
Or jumping every second to get double jump.
---
Oh those beauty days of morrovind.
---
That would give you so many experience on double week. Nice
---
Yeah, that's what it seems like, it spews the glowy stuff like all the other plants, but it's the first time I saw one with skeletons in the trunk.
---
Holy shit it's an actual thing? I thought it was fake...
---
I have him on me currently. 
---
PSN: Markooshy
---
That’s obvious, and yet..
---
i need this on my life!!!!!!
---
But it's not the server , I'm not getting disconnected or crashed to the main menu.I'm straight up getting the "Fallout76 has stopped working" and I crash to desktop.
---
Sadly, time difference is too massive.. :( We're simply not meant to meet, it seems. But still thank you for the offer!
---
Thank you
---
Get good
---
/u/aten_ra add it to the pile. lets get fallout fixed.
---
There'd be riots if you couldn't. We PA users already don't get legendary armor.
---
I saw a vid yesterday that Helena has one to sell (vender bot in the jewelry store opposite the Whitespring creating area). Worth a look there probably.
---
Yeah, cause playing a stealth sniper is a totally viable build with a shotgun or a gatling. 
---
THANK YOU CAPTAIN, YOU SOLVED THE RANGE ISSUES OF THIS GAME. 
---
-_-"
---
Roaming...lol
---
Yes. I think it has something to do with being looted by other players before.  
---
It is that way when I play with freinds seperate without being in a group.
---
Since the drink recipe that requires it (obtained in a daily from Biv) I guess everyone is after it. I assume you mean the creek next to Dyer Chemicals ... every time I go there I find Strangler blooms  ... and also Gulpers!
---
Thank for the feedback, how has the armor gone for you so far?
---
Bruv imma be happy if I will be able to buy backpacks with real money.Less grind and boredom.
---
Whenever I'm online for more than a couple minutes, this happens to me. I have to restart the game if I want to change servers when I've been on for so long as well.
---
I believe it's an issue related to my ports not being forwarded, which is unfortunately not something I can remedy with any ease.
---
I find it funny how Beth thought that these workshops were going to be so hot, but they're really just a hot mess.
---
I have only been hunted down once, and I think that was mostly because I claimed munitions factory(I don't mess around there much). So I've been lucky there. But I have been killed while defending my workshop from mobs many times(I wouldn't think that it possible to contest a workshop while mobs are attacking but I guess I'm wrong)
---
My solution is to claim a workshop and move on right away, only coming back for the reclaim event. I think the rewards are the same and I don't have to wait around for x number of waves. But there is a problem. Its seems that whenever I get 5+ workshops owned, the server thinks something is wrong and shuts down for maintenance. Could be coincidence I guess. Anyone else notice this?
---
I need to do this quest
---
Once you move, drop a bomb on the area for shits and giggles.
---
Oh yeah, man I wish I'd had some Berry Mentats.
---
Had same issue since I stumbled on the acid resource in the pond and popped an extractor in it. Since then it has become increasingly hard to get on a server! 
---
Also, saw on a vid that there is a HUGE "no go zone" between CAMPs. About the size of another camp build zone. So often it turns out to be someone on the next pond stopping me from placing my CAMP, couldn't even see them from my spot so went for a look around. I don't see why that zone needs to be so big!
---
Oh where is this!?
---
I was trying to do it at level 50 with only hazmat suit and freshly made hunting rifle. It is very hard without dying. But if you are level 15 there would be robots around your level = way lower damage.
---
That takes Blooms? I thought it took pods, yeesh.
---
I've seen them around the mire at more than just Dyer. I'm not sure how to make them spawn though.
---
yeah it can be confusing when it doesn't say which PA the mod fits, a universal mod would be nice
---
Agreed, only tricky part is being a melee build since he hits pretty hard. But it's not super fast and I've been using The Fixer more recently anyway
---
I went there and quite literally walked into the Sheepsquach...not sure if I should thank you or not...
---
Come join! Still here
---
HELL YEAH. I RUN A SHOTGUN BUILD.
---
I interact with people every-time I play, IDK what you're on about. Just because there is no humanoid NPC's? Is your view on RPG's so linear you can't accept the "nobody survived the wasteland and it has only now been populated by opening vaults" ?
---
Goddammit
---
yeah we do have the BoS paints for the T-60 PA but a lot of players are not BoS and prefer to use other stronger power armors like the enclave X-01 suit
---
It would be cool if all the beta accounts had a different color name in game or a Star next to it showing others we’ve been thru it all.
---
Yeah. I'm currently running a shotgun build and find it ridiculous to find any shotguns better than my own. It's such a pain. Especially since you don't do any damage to high level enemies.
---
Orbital striked one 1.5 hours ago. Best 430 caps I ever spent.
---
Name is the same as here. Let me know when you can be on. I'm in CDT.
---
Oh wow really? They must have changed this then it’s been a ritual of mine for every blast zone since Beta and it certainly [used to work](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a1dql8/psa__radx_stacks_with_its_diluted_version_giving/depth=1) .
---
I’ve just seen on the FO76 Wiki that this was changed in Fallout 76 patch 1.0.5.10 which was on January 29th, so I’ve been wasting diluted rad-x since then lol
---
thats good for those that just wear armor but for us players that wear power armor we can't show who they support
---
On consoles sneak is way to go, because if you sneak, enemy can't vats you until he hit you. So if you are moving, he will never hit you with fkin gamepad.
---
Happens to me too. It's a Ryzen issue
---
Theres a bunch of plans for camp in the white springs resort that dont drop. Elegant couches, and more pristine furniture. They're a bit pricey but I've been spending most of my caps just trying to complete all camp plans from there
---
From what I gather, the Fire Breathers didn't seem have power armor at their disposal but were trying to acquire it. They were going after the Excavator armor in particular. It'd make sense from a lore perspective if the Fire Breathers skin was specific to the Excavator.
---
Gutsy question! You're a shark!
---
Daily log in rewards are you doing the daily challenges. They’re just not quite free. Time is money
---
10/10 would invite in for a cup of tea.
---
You'll be both sheading caps needlessly
---
Overal I see no problem with this.
---
Sneak really don't work, atleast escape artist don't.
---
Watoga is confirmed to have robots that can't be legendary now.
---
I did Queen 3 times and used over 10k 5mm ammo.
---
Drills, chainsaws, mr. gustys hand and riper were good since beta when 200% repaired.
---
Ave, true to Caesar.
---
I would "circle the wagons" with the trailers and put turrets on top.
---
Finish it off with a campfire in the middle for some ambience.
---
A fairly quick way to level up is to find a server where no one is claiming workshops, then go around and claim around 6-10 of them. You get a good little chunk of XP for claiming, defending or retaking. 
---
So, all you need to do from that point is just fast travel from one to the other, defending/retaking them. With that number of workshops you should almost always have one if not more workshop events active to keep repeating for XP. Also is a decent way to farm certain plans since they are a common reward from workshop events.
---
What would the mats be for all of them besides empath and herbivore?
---
The 53 people downvoted you, so more people downvoted you than you think play the game lol
---
Also when you set bounty on survival, you pay 200 caps and guy lose nothing on death.
---
When i was losing 400caps per death i was so happy to get bounty.
---
More events like this please. Decent challenge and new enough to get everyone there so it almost felt like fauschnat
---
Then people would demand normal armor works under PA too.
---
While I'd enjoy that, it'd make PA almost strictly better than normal armor. (Which it probably would be """realistically""")
---
As it is, though, PA is almost strictly worse. Modding PA can partly bridge the gap, but it only really brings it up to the level of assorted 1*s, if that, in most cases.
---
Legendary Power Armor would be super sweet, though I can't really think of a way of implementing it that doesn't just make it nearly strictly better over normal armor.
---
You sure that wasn't a dream?
---
Trade/barter screen would fix this.  And being able to see the other 2 mods on legendary items
---
You got my respect. I can't imagine i'd have to farm all those plans, do enclave general quest,.... again. Have fun!
---
Its ok. I pieced it together just to test the chameleon mutation. Having Ap refresh on all pieces makes it worth it. I think. And it was easy to find. I only play PvE though and any max level armor is sufficient in PvE. I made a full leather set before this one. Didnt notice any real difference from the combat set I had before that one :-)
---
As it's works standing up, the mutation procs *all the time*. I like this.
---
I read somewhere that chameleon pieces on armor stack, making you less and less visible for each piece. I dunno if this is correct. If it is I would like to know how the mutation compares to having one or several armor pieces.
---
I massacred super mutants for six hours straight yesterday. This is so sweet!!
---
I got mine instantly at Bolton Greens. Literally heard about the camera and where it could spawn and went there. Got it no problem, that might be your best bet.
---
I know! I just went from level 3-9 in like 20 mins from the first 3 quests and a couple glowing bloated ghouls
---
The Handmade Rifle is one of the few guns I use actually, which means it's always the ammo I have the least. However I just craft it as I need.
---
Thank you everyone for the responses.
---
Glowing ghouls give mad XP.
---
-work shop disclaimer... I learned this the hard way
---
I played Survival to get Sole Survivor, my expereince was
---
* Not all stations are spwan camped (R&amp;G certainly wasn't)
---
* Red Rockets (Stash boxes) certainly are not
---
* I only fast travelled directly to events and to my CAMP
---
* I died twice, both times at the Mama Dulces Event to players just looking to kill other players
---
So I took part in 22 Events, and that was my experience.
---
Tonight, I'm going to try Survival for the Action hero with my main (My Alt did Sole Survivor) who is not suited to Survival at all.
---
Went up 3 levels yesterday
---
I'm on now (or was, taking a quick break). Add me and I'll come and deliver the serums (assuming you're still on).
---
Anyone having this, re-log. 
---
Wasn't able to do it as well and that fixed it.
---
Normal armor should not work. But under armor should, afterall it is called "Under armor", so it should go under normal and Power armor.
---
Yeah, I tend to do the same. Leave a goodie back of quality food and chems. XD
---
I had that once, it was fixed by logging out and restarting game. Annoying, I know.
---
I'm in CDT, on and off most of the day for trades, and mainly play evenings / nights.
---
&gt;“Prepared for a nuclear or possibly even biological attack from China, the U.S. President and the Enclave retreat to remote sections around the globe and make contingency plans for continuing the war” 
---
I wonder if P.A.M. had something to do with the warnings.
---
Still waiting for the responder paint job that was data mined.....
---
Double Exp is great! I went from level 91 to level 110 today and I only spent about 5 hours in game. It's great how quick it is.
---
It can drop. I don't own that paint but I've picked up a Camo Stock Pump Action from the ground in Blackwater Mine
---
I may have that wrong then...  but whatever it takes we get them from the Gulper creek by Dyer and they glow yellow and are on creepers around the base of trees.
---
I did over 100 runs since beta. I had egghead, chameleon and  Herbivore serum recipes. Month or two ago there was patch, that should make her drop better things. Only thing that change was, you maybe get plan of some mod for T-series PA instead of 90% Plan:ultracite  Explosive Vents, But bethesda also deleted serum recipes from her loot table.
---
If you want serum recipe you have to buy one at enclave.
---
You can get some of these doing Fertile Soil. 
---
Had Stimpacks and Psycho so far from it.
---
when u start the event look for a destoryied robot and loot the free Shepards Crook, u use this to make the brahrim move to their destination (they move in the right direction usually)
---
once u reach the destination the REAL Sheepsquatch shows up this is between 1-2 of them pending player lvls and how many are doing the event
---
the more brahrims that's alive at the end the better ur rewards
---
when u start the event look for a destroyed robot and loot the free Shepard's Crook, u use this to make the brahrim move to their destination (they move in the right direction usually))d for one of the weapons and the mysterious quills might be needed for the other weapon
---
Saw it today too. I have not seen it before, and have no idea what it is.
---
Sheepsquatch is in game. Killed 3 of them within the last hour. It was discovered on april 25th too.
---
There are youtube videos &amp; its in a event called Free Range.
---
You are welcome :)
---
3 times it spawned at the Mothman statue. Our whole group got it there. Seperate.
---
Tbf fair I'm level 70 and I'm kind of low right now, because I've found my first 50 cal machine gun, oh its fun
---
So the respawn timer had piqued my curiosity, and it would appear it is as I suspected that it's not as simple as a 24 hour thing. Check this guy's post out: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ah49zq/how_item_respawns_actually_work/#thing_t1_eebbjo2
---
I haven't tried this out for myself yet, but considering I almost never pick stuff up if I don't need it, it would explain why I don't see respawns of stuff I *do* pick up for a week or more.
---
I got floating scorched in Helvetia today.
---
Pictures please!
---
Plz delete this... we don't want them to fix it.  It's free ammo, don't question it
---
Yes, now they are complaining about 800 Stash limit.
---
When?
---
It’s a call back to fallout 4. Nothing more than a Easter egg.
---
Cheers got a guy who had it for me cheers anyway 😎
---
Probably just for Cosmetics/Roleplaying.
---
LOL.   Back then, I had the most awful experience playing every: Fought 3 SB at once at level 41.
---
20 minutes later I won!   Most of the time I could only take 1 to 2 pot shots before entire screen is flashing all colors.   Could not see trees, rocks, nothing.   So had to hide inside a building for a moment, jump out and take a few more pot shots.
---
Dude just do the event a couple times and you'll get them. I got the club plan on my second run. There's no point in wasting your caps or legendaries for them.
---
I’m honestly fine with caps as I really don’t worry about em to much and legendaries are just farmable to me not very worried
---
I was thinking same thing.  Even if its the Rifle with like 25 weight... 
---
 I got a 2 strength and still manage to carry rifle + 1 melee with 30-35 lbs free to pick up crap.
---
Crap being legendaries and junk.     I really dont expect to get good legendaries
---
We kind of did this. When it first appeared everyone fired at it, then everyone drew their cameras and took it's picture while it was regening and then we killed it. (One 3\* at Southern Bell, 8 players in the lvl 175-300 range, just having fought the queen. Many got 3\* loot.)
---
at least ones worth picking up Lol, but seriously sad on the inside.
---
I thought they said PA was terrible in PvP
---
That's just what level they are
---
It is generally stable now.   It is the game it should have been at release.
---
Hey there, notice a small bug with my weapons, automatic pipe rifles are being boosted by rifleman and not commando,
---
My alt made 7 levels tonight.  Highly appreciated.
---
You don't need TSE to one shot. Personally I find them boring compared to other rolls.
---
Thanks!! I figured. I was hoping if I server hopped enough I wouldn’t have to use a bunch of ammo (I have shit weapons atm).
---
Mmmmaybe. I mean we did get a spontaneous Sheepsquatch now, so we MIGHT get aliens too.
---
I would definitely like if it wasn't another broken challenge but something with purpose. \^\^
---
Everytime I see "RDR2", I think of R2D2
---
I'm waiting for the legendary vendor and turned myself into this mess. I know I need help but the only one who can do it is that damn mole miner.
---
Just keep farming the new event. Or buy it off someone.
---
Hmm, good question, id say probably
---
A vault-tek shirt with Vault 76 on it would have been nice.   Like they lived inside the vault and just got released.
---
Going back to this post, seeing that the Plague Rider skin seems to be available for every Power Armor variant, it must be that the rest of them will be too. Definitely saving up for that War Rider or Pale Rider skin!
---
The crashed aliens in FO4 were there BEFORE the DLC was ever even sold.
---
If you went there before Mothership Zeta was released, there was only an alien blaster at their crashed ship with the corpses.
---
After MZ it was the trigger point for the DLC to begin.
---
Aliens are lore regardless of what some morons in the bethesda forums say.
---
Depends what the reward would be. Fallout shelter has daily rewards that gives you a lunchbox on the 7th day. One could easily use the time and date cheat on thier phone to collect but not in this case.
---
I'm on.
---
That may have been part of our problem.
---
I think it is a personal experience. Some days it seems overwhelmingly bad ( performance wise ). Other times it really clicks and it's great.
---
The good times are great and the not so good are dispiriting.
---
I'm a bit addicted so I keep at it. I would  recommend  but with caveats.
---
Right now, I especially miss the near infinite acid Helvetia gifted the world.
---
Yea with the right build every weapon is good.
---
Thanks
---
You have to take it and throw it into Fissure Prime.
---
You bet!
---
This did sound damn real, like "irl i eat dog food only, leave me alone"
---
Go play rust. Can't see a thing at night.
---
Tbh as much of a pain as it is, I'd just level up more. Good thing it's double XP at the moment.
---
Its the same with any store.  I bought a small bouncy castle inflatible for 80 bucks at a certain wholesale club.  2 days later it was 30 bucks.  I think they had no-return policy on certain items, like DVDs and inflatibles.  I was not sure.  Anyway, I just chalked it up to bad timing.  
---
When I bought $800 camera at a popular electronics store, then it dropped to $450 on black friday.  I definitely returned the original camera and bought the one on black friday.  Exact same model, but they would not do price reduction.  I even had the brand new one in my hand, so I could validate I had one of the limited sales items.  I know they only offer so many of the items during black friday.   I asked them if I could keep the used one and showed them the receipt and the used camera as well. (I had the used one with me, box and all).   I just wanted them to be able to get the better price and still let them sell the new camera as new. 
---
But they would not.  I had to return the used one (1 week old) and buy the new one.   Felt bad.   Why waste a good camera.  Yes I know it can be resolved as refurbished, but still...
---
PC? I can make you one
---
You own the game. Just play it or don’t, for Pete’s sake. 
---
People that ask this- these are the people who watch YouTube clickbait negativity videos and beg to be told how to think.
---
He makes every weapon look like a God tier
---
Yeah, I’m just being impatient as this is my second character build. Did not plan my perk cards properly! Thank goodness for double XP
---
That sounds like it was fun. Was it fun?
---
I knew about the eggs, but it still was not enough incentive to get me to start playing again.
---
Yeah, why isn’t this game realistic? Come on Beth!
---
Perk, what are you trying to ask me?
---
Wild Appalachia is basically what should've been version 1.0. Sticking with it has been a very rewarding experience for me, personally. Now I just can't wait for player vending and backpacks.
---
I’ll take a couple of serums if you’re still selling?
---
Max out Makeshift Warrior.
---
It's to avoid copyright claims lol
---
I'd definitely buy an matriarch Deathclaw gauntlet skin
---
my next character's name will be 3 Star Legendary Fence
---
Would be surprised if that was the case
---
Final Fallout Fantasy Online
---
Almost every weapon
---
The Power Armor stats are quite not logical.
---
All stats from regular armor does not transfer (this is logical somehow: the inner exoskeleton stats takes priority over what is inside) but... drugs actually transfer!! How does this works I would ask...? ;)
---
\+In lore terms PA should offer enormous Strengh  (but this will not be balanced)
---
I have found if I wait about 2 minutes a bloody blob will appear and that will be the one that disappeared.
---
Good info
---
Just a little Easter egg cosmetic thing. Can be used for role playing too (for example I play 76 with my hubby, so we may as well be married and wear them in game too).
---
Less armor, cheaper plans/common mods. So I think. I want to know if any other armors have set boosts like the excavator. Im trying to get a full set of wood armour to shroud it.
---
Gonna have to become a Confederate I guess.
---
Your ignoring your initial claims do not extend to just a playstyle but knowingly conflate the concept that repair kits negate all need for junk for anyone.  I have no bias against your argument, you simply seem unwilling to admit that your initial comment misrepresents any of your following claims (which are indeed not the same as your initial one).  You seem to believe we disagree on something we don't, as I only have distaste at your choice to make ridiculous claims (again, your initial claim and not the very different later ones about game economy and melee only builds with no interest in a camp and already perfect roll gear not needing junk).  You can be concerned and express yourself without alarmism, urging caution doesn't require blatant overstating of things as you did in your first comment (and I am well aware by now you will refuse to accept that you clearly did such despite more than just my comment pointing out how obviously exaggerated the comment was, but your accepting that fact isn't needed for it to be true).
---
If you run full mitigation then armor is already fairly optional (you have the same level of mitigation that most people not in power armor already do) and melee weapon repairs are practically negated with just one 3 level perk (even moreso if you run full makeshift).  If you ignore all the things you claim are luxuries (ammo actually isn't since it is a consideration for most players tbh), then the game already has virtually no value for junk already (as you yourself are pointing out, and if you claim its hard to get the scrap for your nominal repairs I feel that is a very different discussion since I run a rifle build without the luck perks for repairs and never have any issue with materials for the repairs I do every few days or so, nor do I struggle for ammo unless I am messing around with my LMG for the hell of it).
---
By all means make people aware of your concerns, just don't make it sound like its more than it is (and please go reread your initial comment without considering the rest of our discussion before you again insist you didn't make it seem like much more than you have further explained here).
---
The division 2 has some very good tattoos for arms and legs.
---
I’ve had a Super Mutant drop 2 legendaries but 8!?!?!?
---
I have started buying excavator power armour modification plans and mutation serum recipes.
---
Should keep me busy for a while at 18k for a single mutation serum.
---
Assassin's wood left leg
---
I'll be on later today.
---
Lol ok man, I'm on xbox so let me know I can be your legendary vendor lol
---
Well yes, but actualy no. Problem is, there are legendary armors that have legendary effect which is not affected by armor piercing things, so if you have 5/5 sentinel armor, boom you get only 25% of damage while standing + you can make another 40% from assasin effect. 
---
Power armor have only defence that can be pierced (not counting emergenci protocols)
---
This already exists. Daily/Weekly atoms reward continued play.
---
A good point, although I am unsure how they would reward players, Atoms is the obvious choice, maybe an Atom for every hour played since launch, and incremental Atom payouts over time, say every 50hrs.  
---
I have been playing since launch, and yes I have played other games from time to time, but I always come back to Fallout, because I'm a loyal fan, yes it has issues, but I can't fix them, so I just play-on and enjoy.
---
Media latches onto anything negative. BGS didn't do themselves any favors by leaving the basic repair kits in the Shop. Easy pickings for media.
---
Notice how barely anyone's mentioning kits anymore in the hot posts...two days after it happened? Hail Sheepsquatch!
---
I thought normal armor was already a far superior option to PA because of legendary effects?
---
I had floating Liberators 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
BETA didn't run for long enough or start early enough to be of real use.
---
same here, for most of the time the last weeks i have been around whitespring because i cant' fasttravel.  been carrying around 1400 at certain moments
---
Even two would of shocked me, but eight!?! 
---
Did you die twice or possibly have 15 luck? 
---
This was on my second character who I decided to invest that many special points into luck. Heard it helps with loot.
---
Seems too honestly I've gotten nearly all my decent gear from drops on her.
---
Did you take a video clip of it happening?
---
Yeah, after 500hours i found first lootable fallen ventibot.
---
It was damn good fun.
---
I saw this when the area was nuked 2, maybe 3 weeks ago? Pretty neat looking.
---
I would love some skins for the dcg maybe different types like chameleon, albino, or matriarch.
---
Got 3 scorched megasloths per one scorchbeast queen fight and i was the one who landed last shot, here goes my atoms &lt;3
---
Get your MUFON gear ready
---
Hey, I’m on PC and I also own and use the mothman camera paint and so far I have never experienced this bug. As of now I have had it for the past 24 hours and have logged on and off quite a bit and it has never reverted and I have never had to reapply it.
---
Oh haha gotcha. I'd help if I wasn't on Xbox.
---
I started purchasing mutation recipes and chem recipes also the more expensive power armor plans, all these items come up as available on the various trading subreddits, but caps is not something that seems to be accepted there, everything's trade only (apart from bullets and stims) so I figured I might as well spend them in game on stuff since I cant really put them to use else where. It's when player vending starts that I can see it becoming a worse issue as soon enough I wont have any plans in game left at vendors to purchase.
---
I did just last night. I died at a 3* yao goi, went back and killed him, and got two. 
---
It also happened a handful of time with robots spawning after a nuke zone in the golf club house, about two months ago. They just died easy, dropping two at once. 8s crazy lol
---
That ammo you saw is just bug, u didn't have tagged her, sometimes it happens even if you hit her.
---
I'm sold. Going to give this a run.
---
👍
---
So is the extractor paint more blue and red? I'm hecking colour blind and for some reasons it renders as shiney AF so this new one is more....Black right?
---
I am pretty sure they spawn during the "heart of forest" event (not 100% sure about the name, i don't play in english)
---
The game is already too much easy.
---
If we can use backpack with power armor it's for balance/gameplay reasons. Not for realistic/logical reasons. Its a video game not a simulation.
---
This! It would be awesome to open up a replica of Ricky's used s#*t with player vending coming up.
---
If you don't have caps, go now and do survival challenge, there is two shot .50cal as reward this week. It is not super strong, and you will need tons of ammo (which you can craft 180per pack), but it will take SBQ down.
---
If you have caps to buy things, i would suggest ballistic gatling, laser gatling or plasma gatling. After patch those laser weapons are strong, idk which one is top tho. 
---
Also avoid miniguns, i have TSE one, and it eat ammo like deathclaw newbies. With really low damage per bullet. (still have better dps than explosive handmade, rifles suxs....)
---
Wherres this at on the map?
---
Looks awesome! Love the snug hobo chic vibe. :)
---
I’ve had 12 luck for my entire playthrough (150 hours) and have yet to see an enemy with more than 1 legendary.
---
Just go to Sutton Station and walk towards Charleston on the train tracks
---
...you mean **baah!**dass? 
---
(☞   ͡° ͜ ʖ ͡ °)☞
---
Yup it is a lonely life hanging out on the roof in a nuke zone cos you are too squishy to take too much pounding from the glowing bloateds...
---
I had 1 walking upside down on the bottom of a platform
---
"Between Sutton and Charleston"
---
Sellung only as set or individual parts as well?
---
But they are never really cleared  the enemies just respawn when a new person enters or am I missing the point?
---
If you sell, or scrap items fast (by spamming the buttons to do it faster) it may select a random item in your inventory but still have the name for what would be next on the list. 
---
I make Civil War Hats to sell to a vendor, and after selling 10-15 fast I've noticed sometimes it sells a random piece of armour if it can. It won't sell ATOM store items though as they cannot be sold so to solve this for legendary's I put a Paint Job on them.
---
If you put it on your strength drops; once you take it off you lose 60% of your junk.
---
A+ reading comprehension
---
SB yeeaaaarghing like 10min non stop without landing.. And 400 weight stash limit, or doing a bunker and when you are about to launch a nuke you get disconnected... Good times..  Then i havent talked about all the ppl saying 'i am done with this game' when it got released.  I just kept playing and havent stopped since..
---
This is essentially a big report. How can you two be this dumb?
---
I saw it 2/3 weeks ago when the last kill megasloth in the bog was in challenges while hopping between there and the thorn
---
You can’t have weightless and assassin on the same piece
---
Is this on PC? I tried to slap a guy to death for going afk at a vendor today and I couldn't get the slap damage to work.
---
My guess is 4-5k
---
They should add a hotkey to play the game for you.
---
What kind of shotgun is it?
---
Same thing happened to me and I made this post https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b7yb3z/i_just_killed_a_3_legendary_mirelurk_king_and_it/
---
I got killed by it twice and got 3 legendaries. I should have died more times, haha.
---
So this is confirmed now? Hm I'm pretty sure I tried replicating this without success though. Maybe there is so.ething else to it.
---
GETTING the calibrated legs in the first place is hard.
---
Do you only get the mods from the event?
---
Happy to craft them for just the mats on PC
---
Might be missing the point. In skyrim when you visited a cave (or any location for that matter) you would venture through and find either a boss and a chest, once you left it was considered cleared on your main map. After a few in game days you could revisit the same location and re-venture through it once more still fighting the boss and items in the chest. I proposed it as way for players to sit back and see which locations they haven't visited just yet but have discovered.
---
Bethesda is so great!
---
I have made so many caps using this method it's ridiculous.
---
Thanks. I guess we’ll just have to wait until it happens then.
---
I made another comment about the 3 legendary mirelurk. 
---
So I was running my unyielding build at the time so I would have had pretty high luck. I have a feeling it's not related though.
---
Tbh a level 31 shouldn't even be there.
---
Yes plz!
---
500-1000 caps.
---
Surprised more people haven't complained about it. My guess is that it was 100% intended to be X-01 only, but they decided they could justify increasing the cost from 1000 Atoms (like Raider Excavator) to 1400 by having it "apply" to all without any added work.
---
The "BETA" was only a beta in name, lol. Anyone who says otherwise is disillusioned
---
Broken cameras are all over the place
---
He's responded to the whole controversy.
---
I used to be hateful too. I grew up. People change.
---
Dumb question #1: Where can I find the molotov plans? 
---
Dumb question #2: Do I need a perk card to craft them?
---
Oh my... wow! I have officially subscribed to this guy now!
---
As far as I'm aware you there's a minimum percentage of damage required. At level 31 it's highly unlikely you made a dent.
---
I lost a torso and leg part of my PA two days ago after the harpers ferry Modus event.
---
I did the event an after it was done i want to fast travel back to my camp and i could'nt because of the weight.
---
I did not scrap it or looked into the inventory during the whole event.
---
Vanishing stuff seems a more and more common thing lately.
---
PC : Kranth
---
I dont get to play much as I'm working a lot at the moment.
---
No stay away, don't come back. We are doing fine without the ppl that quit. 
---
Better actually.
---
Bye
---
i try like said uper : go to ammo factory repair vertibot landing pad and make a photo it works !
---
Yep, it's so you don't lose carry capacity by putting on power armor. Some of the posts in here are making me lose hope for humanity
---
Selling a bunch of stolen hot plates (closest I can get to bbqs) and chems at 12 caps a gram... firms
---
Jump through these locations, no need to server hop.

You turn it off before or someone just picked up your loot. 
---
You should still be able to activate it in the pip-boy
---
well that sucks, 99.9 percent of this community is amazingly friendly but man the ones that decide to grief have a lot of tools at their disposal and can put you off for the whole game session. I always just server hop right away, fighting back usually costs me more in the long run. to be good at pvp you have to spec for it which means ditching all the fun and neat quality of life perks. I like power armor, which sucks for pvp, I like my laser gat, which sucks for pvp, I like to leave super duper and my crafting perks equipped so I dont forget to change them when I run into camp after a run. all of which dooms me against anyone with a clue of how to pvp. so when forced I just server hop away.
---
Have a few of them. Even the science scribe is common. The one don't have a lot of is field scribe.
---
not compared to the overall population the bulk of the players are nice as heck.
---
Yea I have two field scribe and one bomber but I tried to sell it and everybody said it wasn’t worth much anymore
---
Can I pay in hash coins? Or you can take Corey or Trevor  for the day just dont forget to feed them
---
There are three spawn spots - easy, medium and hard. Are you sure you weren’t in the easy one?
---
I watch at least one Clown Daddy video a day.
---
RageChronicles is ok if you're into hardcore PvP. His voice can be a tad grating at first. Hardcore New York accent. "YA HEARD?!" But that's a bit unfair. He can't help where he's from. 
---
Rifle Gaming is great. 
---
Oxhorn has a great series on the Order of Mysteries. (Side note: I also adore hos "Who shot first?" video.)
---
JuiceHead is...good. Anything involving the game going FtP or P2W, he latches onto and refuses to let go. He's like most media outlets that does that for anything negative. Negativity gets views. Look no further than cable news channels for evidence of that, and smaller media outlets, like YouTube channels are *no different.* He fell for the Burrows hype just like a lotta people did, leading to self-made disappointment...like a lotta people did. But, he's got a lot of great videos too. His trailer analysis and Sheepsquatch lead-up videos were really good. 
---
T Ronix has a couple nice PvP videos and some decent PvP tips.
---
Yes it does looks good on a male character
---
What’s the difference between photo mode and the camera anyway?
---
You should be able to create them, you don’t need any plans and they aren’t locked behind any perks.
---
The only two I've run are the Beckwith Farm and the one in the Mire. Neither of those are the easy spot. The only 3* one I saw was at Beckwith.
---
Damn I miss trevor, that twiggy alien f#$k giraffe... hash coins would be a way better currency than caps 😂
---
I dont get why people are offended at camps being at white spring. 
---
1. if someone is already hunting there and killed them already youre going to have to server hop anyway. 
---
2. I actually enjoy having players there so I can repair real fast sometimes. ( I cannot move off of my junk extractor or I might be there myself. )
---
Can't earn atoms with the photo mode on a camera mission.
---
No i mean 5mm gatling by that ballistic :) Also check  [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bgu6va/massive_test_of_tse_heavy_ts_explosive_weapons/)
---
Man that would be so good. I had a mod on FO4 that allowed you to strip legendary mods from weapons and store/apply to new weapons. The mod had different settings, (easy = strip anything and apply anything without restrictions and hard = require certain mods/resources etc to be able to do it)... They really should do SOMETHING about this. I played in a nuked Whitespring last night with a group for near 2 hours, I got 1 3\* legendary which was not even very good, and a ton of 1\*'s that were seriously rubbish (vendor or drop on the floor bad)...
---
I’ve never really used Armor so I can’t say much but non PA is currently way stronger than PA but you need good legendaries to make it work
---
Been farmed like crazy. I remember when it went for 2k.
---
I remember when it went for 8k
---
The blog posts are from *years* ago. Go watch his video where he explains all this.
---
Missed out on that. Sold a couple back then but not for 8k
---
Exa PA - most carry weight
---
X-01 PA - most energy rezistance
---
T-51 PA - most ballistic rezistance
---
Armor - most legendary effect (sentinel reduce damage by 75% for example)
---
If you are not doing nuke zones, you better have some sentinel armor with deep pocket mods.
---
If you are doing nuke zones take power armor. 
---
It is simple as that.
---
Oof, but other than that nothing?
---
How to spawn a 3* sheep?
---
I never had any till recently it felt like a week ago when they went for 4K
---
Someone found the watoga change in the code
---
Does he coun't for weekly challenge tho?
---
I mean, I wouldn't know.
---
I don't have it.
---
BoS Heavy Combat is the best there is. Mine is around 325 325 3 at the moment.
---
  With Dense on the Torso and Strengthened on the Limbs I am almost immune to explosives. I have to be careful in my X0-1 as its not, and I forget. ;)
---
Yes but not for " alien "
---
Yep. I had both my power armor legs vanish while wearing them.
---
Fantastic , I too spent hours building in fallout 4 ... about to get 76. Been kinda nervous about it as I’ve loved and lived fallout 4 since 2015. 
---
So you think it’s worth it ?
---
I emptied 2 full magazines of my quad-action shotgun (64 rounds) while she was on the floor. I'm pretty sure I hit her.
---
That could very well be the case.
---
I saw someone whacking the Brahmin instead of selecting the “herd” option. I made a L50 one but now I’m afraid I might accidentally slaughter them,,,
---
It did give me 1.5 lvl? :D
---
i don't have plans for the bos armors yet i will have to keep an eye, thanks
---
same thing has happened to my lvl 60 friend
---
Oh that’s nice
---
Thanks mate, good information
---
I believe a certain mod adds it
---
I found one of these fighting the  imposter sheep
---
8 bullets in the chamber, still only need to reload the 2 shells. It's also got exploding bullets. The burst damage is fucking insane
---
Found one in the wendigo cave a few days ago
---
yeah it seems that way, all the legendaries i seem to get are 1\* wood which is not a lot of use
---
Regular armor has a higher ceiling, but power armor is easier.
---
A set of god roll set Unyeilding/Str+/(item type) Weight Redux would be the highest cap, but its nigh impossible to achieve unless you have infinite trade resources. If you can even manage to find such a ridiculous roll for trade.
---
Power Armor is significantly easier. Shocks for legs, Motion Assist for Torso. Excavator if you're really hard on for carry cap. That's it, all available at vendorbots for around 6-7k
---
I get it that normal armor wont fit in the PA. But underarmor shouldn't be a problem imo.  I haven't seen anyone step in their PA naked.
---
Uninstalling the game solved this problem for me.
---
Now, if only there was any motivation to do so ....
---
I've got a three star instigating with faster reload and additional limb damage that works pretty well.
---
Killed SB for 1200 xp  and hunting glowing ones around 500 xp. Launching nukes is a must for this weekend. 
---
Changed server/map 3 times in a row while in White springs and found all 3 maps(White springs) was nuked.
---
i use T-60 for the BoS paint job can't say i have come across sentinal effect armor i will keep an eye out for it thanks
---
Got a furious explosive 10mm pistol or any other legendary pistols?
---
Ah yeah fair enough man. I create my own motivation. I set goals for myself and try to achieve them. Since I don’t play fallout 76 for long periods of time it’s easy for me to find some goals and get them done
---
my T-60 has calibrated shocks for the weight and jetpack for jumping, i will start getting the mods for my excavator PA just so it's there if i need it, thanks
---
We had an issue where we got the brahmin to the farm, the squatch spawned And as we were focusing on him, some mobs spawned and killed 2 out of 3 of the brahmin, still completed the event though. so just be weary of that for future runs on this event (it was our first one aswell)
---
I've been thinking of moving again and using an existing structure to build in. 
---
There's a lot of detail there, surprised you didn't hit the build cap, I can only build the basics plus a few decorative bits before I max out.
---
Ho yeah, I have plenty of motivation to play the game and I'm quite never bored, but leveling ahead of 80 is kinda useless. It's quite slow to get to level 50, admitted, but I have always between 10 and 20 level-point not used.
---
I'm level 106, spe-heavy/explosives, put a few points in unarmed because it's overpowered, and I have almost all craft-related feats already, as well as pharma-pharma, dodgy etc.
---
I don't have strange in numbers because I play alone, but aside from that I don't think there are perks I need...
---
Yeah I've had it happen when opening up the pip boy.   
---
Last crash for me was fast travel.
---
I need that staff in my life
---
you still selling this ??
---
Yeah without a doubt leveling past 80 is kinda pointless because there really is nothing to continue to work for. I created 3 characters already that are past 50 and leveling up to 50 is a struggle which is fun in its own way. I have currently like the build I have but frankly the play style is getting old since I’m a semi auto bloodied build with high luck so I mostly one shot everything by crouching and using vats lol. It was nice and quick to get quick levels but now it’s just more annoying than fun. So I want try to farm up a bloodied explosive shotgun and go a shotgun/melee build for shits and giggles lmao
---
would work but not with the current in game machenics.
---
I'm pretty sure they did this to sell XP boost in atom shop for real money.
---
I love how cosy that feels, I always struggle with space for workbenches and my patience is thin on micro movement, great job, some of us have that same itch no matter how good we make our camps, keep t up.
---
I suppose knowing what platform helps out a little
---
Platform is Xbox
---
server is stable for me.
---
I still get one shot at workshops from time to time and unless your geared for it pvp still sucks. (it might be better for pvp oriented folks but as a loot pinata I have to say pvp still sucks.) 
---
the community is overall super friendly and generally either want to help or just ignore you and go about their business at worst.
---
griefing and camp smashing still happens sometimes but its very rare and seem to peak in the evening when all the kiddies get home from school.
---
currently I'm trying to change my build to be less of a loot pinata. probably unsuccessfully and with the ability to shift attributes I will be "progressing" for weeks and maybe months to come in altering my build even though I am level 180 something. so I guess I am making my own endgame content? I still feel like there's always more to do than I have time for.
---
the TSE nerf made my build obselete and I quit out of frustration for awhile. I am not a pvper and my fun sniper build with lots of QOL perks and power armor was suddenly unable to perform because of pvp balance issues. 
---
changing over from rifle to heavy guns specifically for laser gatling not because of stats but just because its fun as crap to shoot. 
---
I assume i will continue to level up and tweak my build for ages to come. 
---
last but not least I don't let my friends tell me what to think. I also don't tell my friends what to think. 
---
The game is in a good place for me personally I like it just fine, I have more issues with the players who sometimes inhabit it than I do with anything bethesda has done during and after release.
---
Ahh! Knew I was forgotting something. Sorry!
---
That's one ugly mutha f****
---
No problem
---
OMG I JUST FOUND THIS LAST NIGHT! It made me laugh so fuckin hard
---
I used to have a camp in the middle of the lake. Until one day I fast traveled there and upon arrival, half a dozen scorched spawned inside my building and three scorchbeasts spawned above it.
---
I killed the scorched, then swam to Thunder Mountain to kite the SBs away from my camp then killed them too.
---
I'd gone quite a while with no attacks there of any sort, but a triple SB attack convinced me to move on.
---
PS if you want a camp in the middle of the lake, place your CAMP on the boat that is floating in the lake, from there you can place a foundation underwater and then a ladder from that should just poke above the water for you to build off of.
---
If it rains on your ass you should put the poor animal into a stable !
---
You really need to change your diet mate. You need to eat fresh organic meat. Get the cannibal perk. Eat your dying comrades while they are still moist and warm.
---
Unpopular opinion but I don't think backpacks should work with PA. I mean if you have 1 str and use excavator with 2 shocks, your carry weight increases by 250 already!
---
Very much so
---
For you, it will be.
---
Check your mods. You can dial back some of the mods and get better durability. I've not used my shotguns for a while, but dont remeber it being like you describe.
---
Speaking of which, if you are upset about durability allow me to sing you the song of my people, the Flamer and Cryolator.
---
hmm I could try an uninstall / reinstall, pretty sure they're saved in my character files though.
---
There is a big list if you Google. I am with him now if your are on Xbox as it took me two days of server hopping to find it.
---
IGN: RebelsAdvocate
---
Scrapped in the neighborhood of 300 combat armors. The only bos that comes up is the helmet. It's deceiving. Makes you think you got a different one. Don't think you can get them by scrapping.
---
Actually I agree with you, but other PA's not excavator should increase carry weight too. Not by 100 lbs but at least 20 or 50.
---
sure they forgot to email you,
---
look at the patch notes before bitcing about something you can here clearly find out, did you not see all the post about the patch notes, new stuff ppl find.
---
the time it took you to right this pointless post is more than the time it would had taken you too look here (reddit) for what your looking for. 
---
your post is more me me me me cry me a river (they didnt tell me) but they did lol, everyone did. open your eyes and read.
---
None completely protect from rad damage.
---
Closest thing we have is a rad suit but can't be worn under a power armor.
---
100 lbs is 45.4 kg
---
They're not despawning most of the time. They're teleporting back to where they spawned. 
---
You can test this out in the brotherhood (i think?) base in the old mental asylum. About 50/ of the time, if you walk in the front door and turn right at the hallway, there's a legendary ghoul. Kill him, watch him disappear. 
---
Walk further down the hallway and in a room on the left will be the corpse, containing the loot you seek. I've reproduced this bug at this location (and elsewhere but this one is the most consistent) at least a dozen times.
---
Equip Animal Friend 3, find a lone creature spawn, profit.
---
It’s very much the same just with a lot less building objects and some restrictions. Perfectly acceptable though and I still have fun building
---
Sludge lung still not counting towards the diseases challenge on xbox
---
I have to move my camp every few days or I’ll login and it’ll say, can’t find world, and then all my shit will be gone
---
yeah it is lore breaking when the PA gets nurfed like that
---
Please don't stab customers while they shop.
---
Luck, and settings on High! It definitively doesn't look this good when I travel around the Wasteland.
---
Seen one with the sheepsqwanch was all nope there
---
I have seen it before
---
It seems like if you stare at it for a minute the legendary pops up in its list
---
Thanks I was always looking for it in German and I found everything, but no list. But I do in english now. And thanks for the offer, but I play on PlayStation
---
waist off a nuke if you ask me, I have nuked 4 different times and the burrows have been bust.
---
Damn!
---
Wait, do they have content in the holotape games? Like a little questline in the games?
---
I found my first lootable vertibot in B.E.T.A. and I haven't been able to loot a single one since.  
---
:-(
---
I'm at level 217 with over 40 levels banked, no desire to play another character. This XP weekend isn't really beneficial to me (except the daily level up challenge), but still it leaves a sour taste in my mouth knowing just how badly they've nerfed XP gains across the board since release.
---
It does
---
Yeah always finding my guns empty
---
The Grognak and The Ruby Ruins is a full on D and D style game man! You pick your team at the start and then walk around fighting monsters turn by turn.
---
It saves your progress as well so you dont have to do the whole storyline in one go!
---
Wow, that's cool :o
---
I was getting random legendarys for a couple days. From non legendary mobs.
---
Way back in the wild days before the first Watoga nerfs, I had a protectron drop 3 pieces. Was with a friend and they also got 3
---
Yeah man soo much fun! I've got 5 of the 8 holotape games atm. Cant wait to get the other 3!
---
Good news everyone, it's a suppository!
---
How do you get them? From the comics?
---
If you leave them alone during their spawn they add stars.
---
If you stagger them out of their spawning animation they instantly attack, but if you leave them long enough they gain full 3 stars. But getting 10 people to not shoot instantly is hard.
---
I tested that hypothesis on my own. It did t work.either it's untrue or my luck is awful lol
---
Exca mods are at Camden Park, Grafton (not the station), or the Responders guy in WS.
---
That shit doesn't happen on PS4 bro. Like ever ever.
---
I've had this happen in the burrows and with ghouls/glowing ones at white springs. I can't loot the bodies at whitesprings but I usually can elsewhere. Had an ISS either despawn almost immediately or get knocked through the ground, that one I was actually upset about... but so far it's the only 3 star I've lost (that I'm aware of).
---
Nifty! What platform?
---
They have always existed, but failed to load in their texture, being invisible, you would walk through them and they would spray spores into the air. They are now fixed, not "new"
---
Thank You very much my good sir.
---
Yea, the game is made for 1-50 level only. There is no end game content at all after that and that is the major problem. Bethesda thought that leveling character is enough and no need to think further away.
---
I have seen it work, didn't record, damn.
---
I'll have to try and get a recording tomorrow. It's not all the time, but sometimes.
---
Looks like I missed you. Come and find me next time you are on.
---
Yeah man there's a perk card that makes a sound when you are close to one. That's how I found most of mine
---
Run towards them and kill or run away and don't die. You need to make sure to activate the sprint
---
I'm level 85 and I have yet to find more than a 1-star weapon or armor. :/
---
I must be doing something wrong.
---
Is it a nerf if its a different game?
---
All good friend, glad you could get your camera. :)
---
Here! Here! On the cow skull LoL Now that is just laziness on their part!
---
what do you mean by not the station in grafton isn't that the only vendor there
---
Wait, we can stuff a backpack in under our power armour? Haha, I thought it was going to be an incentive to get people out of PA.
---
Excavator carry weight master race just got even more entertaining.
---
Nice bait
---
Well fusion cores was  endless source of energy by lore. So you could use one for PA one for gatling laser and u would be good.
---
Say it again brother I think he's broken. 
---
##SAY IT AGAIN
---
Yup. I’m a less is more CAMPer too.
---
The orange spores have always happened in the bog trees. I think the pillar was bugged and not visible until recently.
---
Great stuff. I'm not bad at exterior design, but I can never get that perfect "cozy vibe" that you've got going.
---
Looks awesome
---
Yeah for 2000 caps. Not worth it. I just went bother with it.
---
Energy weapons are defintly much better than originally.  TwoshotExplosive Laser Rifles with the splitter beam get buffs from both rifleman/commando and shotgun perkcards so you can really buff em up.
---
It sounds like we dont have a very good timezone overlap because when you get out of work its 2:00 am for me. Whats the very earliest you can be on today? Im on ET.
---
How much you got? 
---
;-)
---
Seriously, I don't know what it's worth. Will consider any reasonable offer. I'm carrying close to 800 lbs right now. Need to offload some stuff.
---
They disappoint me
---
Its a rendering issue that's been happening since a couple patch's ago, the recent patch made it much more worse and frequent. Tried talking to the folks over at support couple days ago but the last agent i spoke to was kind of an arse, anyways at least i know me and my friends are not the only one having this issue, hopefully this gets fixed or looked into soon. 
---
EDIT: Thought i'd tag you two here to take a look at the post and comments. [/u/Valseek](https://reddit.com/u/Valseek)  [/u/Ladydevann](https://reddit.com/u/Ladydevann)
---
Probably lined up right after the .45 revolver legendary drops.
---
I always needed mods in order to get the interiors right in Fo4.
---
I don’t even try to make a nice permanent settlement in Fo76.
---
it's a different game but the same universe and the same power armor. if not a break then they are really stretching the the lore, i think the loading screens in fallout 4 said that power armor was designed to offer complete protection from radiation
---
If they released under-armor now, how would any PA user felt about it not being useable in PA?
---
Honestly not much bro, considering its free. I think the cost in mats +time invested would be what Ide consider the value. I was actually about the start the challange myself but if you'd sell at a fair price Ide consider buying just to save me the hassle.
---
Fusion Core Drain? A recent post  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bhit9m/so\_were\_eating\_these\_now/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bhit9m/so_were_eating_these_now/)  may explain why cores are draining so fast - they're spoiling.
---
Harold??? Is that you?!?!
---
Find 3 dog get him to dj. That would be awesome 😁
---
What type u after as I have 1
---
Cries in legendary rolling pins, walking canes and boards.
---
Nah dude this happened to me exactly when I was xp farming, then they called a strike on my base at white springs (I’m down the hill out front, not in the back, my turrets are purely for stray mole rats and rad stags) and killed each other before I could do anything and they did it multiple times. I sent a ticket for harassment and blocked them but still it’s double XP this weekend which means some douche on his lvl 35 alt is going to kill me with his legacy lasers for no reason and farm hundreds off me while I’m defenseless basically...and if I do kill him he loses 35c (even if he initiated it) on top of that he can just get a 5c bounty and keep it all. That’s messed up, PvP needs to be scaled by instigation.
---
Initiators should be charged more caps no matter what when they fight someone in pacifist. That’s messed up bc we are literally saying we don’t want any PVP engagement at all, yet we higher levels end up losing 1,000 caps in the blink of an eye in these situations it’s not really fair. 
---
It’s already bad enough I can’t go to white springs without 3 other ppl there with explosives, but I don’t build for PVP, that’s never been my cup of tea for these types of games, I’m just a lowly trader trying to level up for a respec. I don’t need to get murdered for no reason.
---
It's the tradeoff for having the lowest damage/energy resistances.  
---
Also other PA also give you 10 STR .
---
Because I totally want to catchy blinky the three-eyed fish by thunder mountain powerplant
---
Seems people are tiring of Survival and the specific types of challenges it presents?
---
It's a suppresses hardened pump explosive. Reduce targets damage output by 20% for 3 seconds doing 163 damage without any perk cards
---
actually i would really like that, i think maybe giving beta players some kind of minor cosmetic thing like all color universal paints, and let other player  buy for atoms but beta players get it free
---
I'm fairly certain that's just the thing that's supposed to spray those orange spore clouds, it just rarely properly shows up for whatever reason.
---
hell yeah, back when two  guys with tse's would kill the scorch beast ez
---
The loading screens would have you believe that marine armor is second only to power armor, I don't think that's the case.
---
Hmm, I’ve gotten a couple decent pieces from nuking it
---
I actually think he might be a little bit bigger. Or am I just dumb struck in awe by the amount of attacks he pulled off on me within a short span of time lol
---
Carry weight is ... not optimal. It'll be good for more casual pve.
---
What PA will benefit from on the backpack isnt carrying weight, but the ability to add those mods in new slots.
---
BTW the PA legendary is actually easy ... legendary mods that are limb pinned and make you make a serious choice. Of course, arms need better mods period. Only useful for melee.
---
When you farm the paint plans up end up with quite a few bomber jackets....ive scrapped some...still have a few. People still want them, just not worth much
---
Lol your reward is still being alive after playing that much of a shit game.
---
I'm really hoping that there's a storyline coming up where members of the enclave from the DC area or anywhere else show up to see what the heck's been going on. That would be a very interesting way of introducing npcs to the game. Having really evil bastard's from the former government showing up to check up on the Appalachian operation
---
Yeah you must be, I've got 10-15 3 stars from just the past couple days on my toon because I just ran out of stash space for them... Though tbh I've been focus farming xp/legendaries because I'm rebuilding my rifle toon.
---
1. Go to westek, clear the place, log to main menu, do it again. 
---
2. Continue for 3 hours a night for 3-4 nights. 
---
3. Realize you don't have that much stash space to save all the garbage 2/3 stars for the legendary vendor, start throwing out the heavy 2 stars. 
---
4. Run out of stash space again, repeat throwing out trash 2 stars until none remain. 
---
5. Start storing 3 stars on your toon while stubbornly avoid getting rid of any of them. 
---
??? 
---
Legendary vendor profit (I hope. I'm gonna be pissed if the legendary vendor is dumb after I've gone through all this trouble.)
---
blackbird dudes where you at!!
---
There's a LOT of pre-existing structures in the game you're able to CAMP at and imo given the build limitations, you can generally only build a large structure or place a lot of decorations. If you find an existing location you like, you have more room for both.
---
really power armors should be about armor boosts and the under armors and backpacks shouldn't work at all on them - I mean lets face it you can easily wear power armor 100% of the time and never run out of fusion cores its not like they are rare 
---
what they should do is give power armors a slot of there own and let them get a bonus that has a lower weight total but still gives them some advantages - then they should optimize armors so that each type really pushes a specialist build and gives advantages to those builds 
---
Example - Marine / trapper / scout / robot armors will get special mods that allow them to be anti rad armor where as leather / metal / combat armors should have more mod types added to them to allow us to really customize them
---
I was gonna say exactly that period every time I get to just about 25KI buy one of those badboys. I only have I think 1 or 2 left that I actually want to have a so that will be an issue all have to deal with then I suppose haha
---
If you already got them then they seam to stop dropping as well.
---
What perk is letting him attack the mire queen and scorch beast without them detecting him and attacking back?
---
It’s kind of hard to do that if you don’t know when it happened or If you haven’t opened your inventory or used the weapon in the last few minutes, at least on Xbox because you can only clip the last five minutes.
---
Yup. Killed a level 50 legendary just tonight with a buddy of mine. Took us about 20-25 minutes because we were both level 27 and had crap for guns. But they are real in the game. We were in the bottom left town of the map south-west of the big land excavator when he popped up. He was beating the crap out of the mole miners there and we just sat in the houses there and popped shots. Will try to get a pic up tomorrow as I've already turned my xbox off and headed to bed. But when I seen it, I couldn't believe my eyes!
---
honestly I would love that idea but with a bit of a change to it - have a lore section that auto saves anything we learn and shows how many parts of the lore we have 
---
Example 3/5 survivor stories - this would let people know that there is more lore to find and also let us ignore notes and items we have already read because it would just be (known) already
---
I finally got them yesterday. I had zero luck in Grafton so I got a tip that they spawn inside the Penitentiary right in that open cell with the work benches. After about an hour of server hopping they finally popped up. I happen to see the BOS chest on one pass so I'm pretty the full set spawns there.
---
I got it the day it went live, I think.
---
Yeah, for kill challenges, you need last hit. Good luck!
---
Sounds like a better system then we got now either way. (low bar to start with ig)
---
From an alternate view point maybe they haven't broken the lores. It could just be an evolutionary argument. FO4 is set ~200years after the bombs as opposed to FO76 being just 25years. Surely this can be deemed as a viable reason for weaker things such as PA being weaker, fusion cores not being the unlimited source of power and Deathclaws not being the ultimate apex predators become after that 200years has passed. Basing it on real life life in 2019 is not the same as 1819 because of said evolution.
---
There is a vender in a building in Grafton as well in a building.
---
Nice work!
---
He was joking/trolling
---
So where do you find this...wife, you say? Preferably this kind and compassionate.
---
I lost a Gatling gun too, as well as 2 power armour pieces. According to some people it’s been happening for months and bethesda hasn’t acknowledged it.. I suggest you actually submit a report to bethesda on their website or they may not even pay any mind to it until it becomes an even bigger problem and more people lose their stuff.
---
Its a placeholder for a just in case scenario.
---
More like no steps forward and 3 steps back..
---
Why don't you just try and play for a while and see what you think?
---
You need to deal the last hit and some people say that is not even enough.
---
I killed two queens since the latest patch and i brought a light machine gun  with me to have more chances at the last hit. 
---
Obviously that didn't work. 
---
I still recommed to bring your fastest fire rate weapon and try your luck when her health is really low.
---
I just wish block for this sessions works. Sometimes I just want to lone wander and bang friends find me and well... its not a cool thing. lol
---
Go survival now is 2x xp week and survival is another 20% xp bonus?  So you only have to go around and kill everything.
---
Looks good.
---
I sometimes wonder how these people get on solo launching a nuke 😕
---
I would rather suggest just follow the game and do stuff as you find them (Explore). Rushing for levels will make you miss out on the feel of the game.
---
Yeah, that's weird, they should at least stack, or not be able to pick them up if you already own them
---
Yeah, I am pretty sure it does. It also spawns at Grafton Steel, it's literally the same pool of stuff in my experience.
---
I have just killed one near Camp Venture, 3 stars. Didnt hit me once due to high sneak. Dropped a 1 star sword. Really? It took me some 20 head shots.
---
A day or two ago some legendary dropped me 2 items, can't recall having seen that before. But 8? Geez Rick.
---
Bonus. I get to take you out because you own a workshop. Great idea, keep up the good work.
---
I can never get a group to do it
---
This happens when your over encumbered
---
Make me an offer. I don't know what you consider fair.
---
One tedious but efficient way is to equip your camera and slowly scan the area where it died. When you see "assaultron" in the top right, it means it is in your view.
---
Fishing? Really? America must be rebuilt. Fight, build and procreate!
---
It's still a 3 star legendary, and a very nice gun. Worth the quest if you like heavy weapons.
---
Wastelad is a standalone game eheh.
---
If only there was an app to play them on our phones.
---
A duper gifted me a TSE handmade last December. After the nerf I sold it to a vendor, it was that worthless compared to the bloodied sledgehammer he also gave me.
---
FWIW. I have an explosive Zealot's handmade sitting in my stash just in case.
---
This will sound random but maybe Beckley and Welch in the Ash Heap? Beckley can spawn a legendary in Sal's Grinders, there's a power armor suit in the street for a core if needed, then a few robobrains, and mole miners in Welch. But at level 25 you probably already know about the usual places you can go to farm XP.
---
Lol i had the same 3* star in the burrows in the same spot do this to me i waited for almost 5 mins coz sometimes it takes a while to pop up and it was a 3* but  nada for me
---
Forget refrigerators, spoild meat is the new meta.
---
Duping is not gone
---
You can make it work, but it's a very specific build. The only real variety is your gun of choice. It also a bitch to run cause you need a friend or a second account to run Empath for you/your main. Empath is necessary, you don't get your Damage Reduction percent high enough otherwise.
---
Besides Empath, you gotta run MedX (so no psycho). For this, Chem Fiend is recommended. Not necessary, but helpful for longer fights.
---
You also need Dodgy, which means you need a fair whack of agility because your survivability is limited by your AP total.
---
Lastly you need Emergency Protocols. Obviously you have to be on low HP for this, which is what makes Empath so vital (and thus why this build is not viable for the average player). As a plus, you get to abused Bloodied weapons!
---
From there, just general DR boosts. Using t51/Ultracite, Scaly Skin, Grounded (if you don't use Energy Guns ofc). Nerd Rage is a huge pick here. We're already protocol-ing so it's free DR and damage.
---
I might be forgetting something, but that's the gist of it. My friend has two accounts and rolled with this. He reported highly of the build. If you can pull it off, people don't seem to expect power armor to actually do shit in pvp.
---
An Organic Solution. Go by Ella Ames Bunker in the Mire to start it. If you see the Heart of the Swamp event active, go there. You should be able to see the undiscovered marker on your compass if you don't already have the POI.
---
Thankx Homie! For the info!
---
Don't take it that bad. He will get what he deserves. Remember, Karma is a beach.
---
I’m saying in general for everything lol
---
I’ve been able to find my loot without the quest, and I haven’t seen it in my pipboy
---
That's one of the 3 I havent got yet! Having them as apps would be could but it's pretty awesome taking a break in my CAMP playing some holotape games
---
yes i have neen using the camera...but after it blows up it could.be amywhere..i just spent half n hour looking  but had no luck. i wont be buying any more cards till they fix it..or do you think its intentional that it now turns invisible? either way im not wasting caps and not being able to find the 3 star
---
Plans absolutely spawn there but for some reason they suddenly stopped for me after the last patch. Not sure if that's a coincidence.
---
Ah, guess I'll start bringing my minigun then :D
---
Thanks.
---
I only take shops with a sniper. Otherwise its a waste of time and caps.
---
Thanks, will need that. This is near impossible with a lot of people shooting it..
---
iv started it by myself when my friends werent available..usually you get enough randoms to show up
---
Sorry here too, I didn’t see your reply last night either. Will you be on at all today?
---
Fair point, and agreed.
---
Oh, ok. Tell them to message me on Reddit. Just start a chat with me.
---
Can it be upgraded like the other underarmors?
---
I personally think having them as rare is fine. Radshields are supposedly better than Rad-X. They offer 300 Rads resistance, though I've yet to be in a situation that Rad-X wasn't adequate but Radshield was. Usually if Rad-X doesn't work, it's PA/Hazmat suit level radiation and my Radshield doesn't do jack. Even so, the higher quality makes them more valuable, so materials are rarer.
---
What I would like to see is a way to make them spawn outside of An Organic Solution quest. You get the ingredients to make a fertilizer in the quest, but can never do it again afterwards. Make it a daily quest, and spread the stuff around, so that players have to travel the map to find the ingredients for the fertilizer. Maybe some of the farms around Appalachia can serve as radiant spawn locations? And would it be that hard to add in a few more deathclaw nests to the world?
---
Better of crafting and scrapping to learn the mods rather than searching for mods at vendors and spawn locations. Could try the market and see if anyone will mod your weapon for you.
---
Check out that link I posted above about the spawn rates. The guy has some really good insights about how it actually works.
---
Never enough.
---
Escape artist plus sneak perks.
---
Horns, quills, a skull, (that looked like a regular cow skull) and some meat.
---
Ounce of Prevention
---
Probably not, this game doesn’t really seem lore friendly at all. I’m no expert on fallout lore though.
---
Where on the map is this location? I wanna check it out
---
Yes, same info as others.  Smaller building area, limited options, ect.
---
But you get to meet people.  That is also a downside; you meet griefers who love to blow up camps.  Shortly in the next few months, there will be patch that prevents this though.
---
I was thinking about doing exactly that, but I haven't recieved a mod from scrapping weapons or armor in so long I can't remember. And I am a serious hoarder/scrapper. You notice a difference in your plan/mod recieved rate from scrapping?
---
Add Plan: Poisoned Sheepsquatch Staff
---
What's the name of the new event?
---
any idea how to change the stock back to the default wood one? the stock on both my legendary pumps turned tactical. I figure it's because of the bugged camouflage pack a month ago.
---
I guess you'd have to apply the tactical paint and then revert back to the default one, but I have no paints...
---
Because we took the vaccine? Lol
---
As a power armour user I Completly agree with that one! As nice as the backpacks look we have way to much weight as it is compared to a non power armour user
---
It's part of the main quest...
---
Yep, so long as you're not going against radiation, which is what the more challenging situations involve.
---
No amount of radiation resistance from armor can compare to power armor or hazmat due to a hidden buff they both have.
---
Don't use the shotgun for all your hits, it's been said a shotty doesn't register correctly. Make sure to hit her with another gun too.
---
You have to scrap and craft them. You'll get lots of useful mods in 10-12 scraps, which might set you back 80 screws.
---
If you've been playing from the start you should already have gotten some of the freebies they've given away.
---
You have better luck than me.
---
If the vaccine was truly effective, why wasn't anybody else still alive?
---
Did you miss the part where my major issue is the abusing takedowns? His shitty "response" video doesn't say a word about his abuse of reports.
---
My imaginary wife Sierra Petrovita have a beautiful camp right on the water next to the Nuka Plant.
---
PS4? I can make you burning barbed staff
---
Well thanks for the info, and it sure it's annoying as hell
---
I find super mutants are the best non boss enemy for loot and xp, so anywhere that spawns them. Huntersville, west tec and theres a prison that spawns low levels and power armor in the yard but I forget the name...
---
His response video doesn't mention his abuse of the report function at all. He just admits to being a homophobe in iy.
---
If you're on xbox I have the plans for sale. Handmade and gauss rifle
---
Because they didn’t take it, the overseer finished the project and that’s how we were able to take it.
---
They will with this fridge they are trying to add to the atom shop. If you want those mats to spoil like you said you should be against the fridge too.
---
500c. At the end of the day its still a free gun, or else Ide assume your post would have been flooded with offers. TBH, I'm not a heavy weapons user, just have a problem hoarding shit Ide probably never use lol.
---
There is always will be people who gonna spend thousands of $ for that kind of items, they are the reason why p2w exist in the first place. If "poor" ones and idealists don't buy them it only makes this items more appeal to that kind of persons.
---
I mentioned below that I do still have the challenge. One of the mods was outdated and cloning my daily challenges into my weekly menu. Once I updated I was fine.
---
Your point about the console update is a good one I hadn't thought of and is another good reason not to put out quick hotfixes. 
---
I disagree with the concept of trying to limit free atoms to make more money. It's a possibility but the typical online store in games with very little direct competition focuses more on player volume and retention than boosting sales among current players. The games that give out compensation and constant premium rewards for free tend to trend at the top of lists for quite a long time, more so on mobile but Steam is close to the same. Maybe Zenimax hasn't figured that out yet, but I doubt it.
---
Again, I chalk most of the recent issues up to rookie mistakes and negligence. This is Beth's first game that has constant updates and a constant stream of content being released.
---
There’s also a burning barbed variant. Also badass
---
Looks like a great and cozy tiny house! 
---
Thinking about moving as well, but picking a right spot seems hard. Currently in the Savage Divide and I love how it's pretty much in the middle of everywhere I need to go. I'm scared when moving I lose this advantage and have super mutants or something spawning near my camp everytime I log in. 
---
(it's like renting a new place and not knowing if your neighbours are loud douchebags ;)) 
---
BTW, does the rug glitch still work for plants/ crops? Otherwise I won't even move. Want my plants inside of the CAMP.
---
There was a vaccine ?
---
i'll give it a try with westek but you just described my process for whitespring, ft defiance, arktos and a couple other places. all 1 stars. mostly shitty low-stat armor with the occasional instigating deathclaw gauntlet (which btw is my best weapon. 1 shots all lvl68 ghouls.)
---
It is when I was low level in whitesprings a friend helped me clear out golf club and as I was going back to the resort I accidentally attacked a bot but beachside of all the good loot that I could leave behind I still came back but eventually gave up on the loot but was still over encumbered from Legendarys with only a sliver of health from too many rads so I think I died 50+ times trying to get away I ended up dropping all those new found riches that day
---
You get the vaccine (from the Responders) early on in the main questline. It's the quest that sends you to the hospital in Charleston. The game is set up, and the expectation is, for players to easily follow the main questline until you join the Fire Breathers. The main quest keeps you in the Forest until after you have the vaccine. Enemies are relatively low level, and with the exception of the Scorchbeast that shows up at the airdrop event at the airport (which doesn't attack), you never see one in the Forest. So, canonically, the Vault Dwellers would never have a chance to be infected before receiving the vaccine.
---
ROFL, that why they dosnvoted anyone who points out it can be soloed? Downvoting and claiming "it can't be rolled noob".
---
My problem is that I’ve got a load of broken stuff and I can’t seem to find enough adhesive to fix it up, so super mutants are a no go for me yet
---
i dont wear power armor..with.my unyielding i have 390 carry weight..have had up to 440 carry weight with nerd rage and a whiskey.
---
I'm really happy about Bethesda bringing up new things in every update but what is also needed is fixing up these little but many scattered around bugs in the game.
---
You won't be able to anyways due to them not being able to be dropped. They arr made so once you buy them they can't leave your stash/inventory.
---
Lol oh. Well. Coo.
---
My group is always accepting more people. There's 6 of us right now. We play ps4
---
happens to me too on ps4
---
Like Tanaas said, for some reason it does that sometimes on PC, and other times it works fine. There's no rhyme or reason to it, but I have noticed that fast traveling away then back sometimes fixes it.
---
Unfortunately they have no value because selling them will cut into your daily 1400. They only hold value if you can't clear vendors on your own.
---
lately only place i can respawn is vault 76..quite annoying
---
The Eastern Regional Penitentiary SE of Grafton, it has dumbbells in the courtyard and can traps and can get a lot of lead and steel from them.
---
Thanks. How much?
---
I fond it stops working randomly. Cant figure why. I lose it while never leaving my armor.
---
By god, what sorcery is this? I have scoured the gof 76 map
---
What's your GT?  I want to visit your camp.  :D
---
Yep i know, but what if i meet scorchbeast before this ?
---
What I would do - potentially not the best option but it is how I deal with level / gear wall at 25 ish. 
---
go back to vault 76 and go directly to the moonshiner shack - kill those ticks for blood and bloodsacks (antiseptic) 
---
along the way collect wood and pick every blue flower you can find to the lumberyard. 
---
kill all the ticks there and get more blood / bags and wood 
---
work your way to the super visors camp from there collecting wood and flowers along the way. scrap and store.
---
go to the river and collect blood leaf blood leaf and soot flower may cheap healing salve thats very usefull because you can spam it and make it super easy. 
---
if you have the stim pack recipe make stim packs from the blood and antiseptic and make healing salve from the plants. if you cant make stim packs hold on to the blood for awhile till you do it will not spoil. 
---
server hop and rinse repeat till you have lots of healing salve - go back to where you couldnt advance and spam the S\*\*t out of the healing salve. with enough of the healing salve you can heal your way through most obstacles.
---
with the new loot mechanics server hopping may no longer be viable for the plants but the mobs respawn. 
---
you can also make a base and get some xp from that using a ton of the collected wood. make stuff scrap it remake scrap it then go get more wood etc. 
---
steel makes throwing knives for some xp, scrap them , make more rinse repeat. 
---
in other words do some easy cheap farming for a bit and build up heals - consider heal salve and stimpacks as an extension of your health pool. with enough of them you can be extremely tanky. 
---
after working flat woods work your way back up to morgan town and do the same type thing there. 
---
once you have some heals and you have burnt of some resources with free experience points you can push forward in the story arc and get leveling. 25 ish is a bit of a hump to grind through for me. your not equpped well enough to do well in ash heap and the xp is hard to get in the forect so its a sort of awkward spot in the process. after the story takes you past that point things seem to progress along about the same level of medium difficulty. managable but challenging enough to be interesting.
---
&gt; How are you over encumbered if you are only carrying one gun...
---
It's a rifle build obviously.
---
Adhesive is quite common man. Just go search all the cupboards, workbenches and lockers in the starter places that you can easily handle. A little time consuming, but you'll get a bunch. Or I can hook you up later today if you're on xbox?
---
My carry weight is 410 and I dont use pa
---
Yeah I’ll take it
---
Lol. Yeah dude. Yours is duped. Mine is duped. 99.999% of the TSEs in the market are dupes. A tse handmade used to sell for 500 caps on xbox lfg. The game was absolutely flooded with them.
---
...needs to **show** some love!
---
Ftfy.
---
Isn’t it still a pretty busted game?
---
That's the one ha
---
yeh sometimes when i die i cant spawn anywhere but vault 76 and im  not eve overencumbered..i was told.its a bug with my wwr armor
---
Yeah I’ll buy it
---
Yup, I'm at that point right now. Level 60. I often find myself staring at my pip-boy thinking what can I do next? A quick round at whitesprings, selling some stuff and doing some events or helping some players out keeps me busy for a few hours but I'm pretty sure I will get bored with it in a month or so. Just grinding for that unique weapon or all mutations won't keep me satisfied for ages as I'm not having too much problems killing pretty much anything. But isn't that the case with any game really?
---
😂
---
Predator? Terminator? Make your mind up...
---
That’s what I’m doing now)) Seems bad luck for me, very few adhesive. I’m in PS4, but thanks anyway)
---
Didn't know it has can chimes though... may go and farm it again myself ha!
---
Nuclear Winter?!
---
Jcupcake
---
Is that right , so destroying other camps will be patched. That’s good
---
my legendary one apparently got painted tactical against my will so there's that
---
I miss the old TSE. I just fuck shit up with the ak. I been scared get on cause of disappearing gear.
---
Yeah I use a few turrets which eat up the space, might reduce the number I have. I'm currently set up on the lead node north of Huntersville, but i've been looking at The Devil's Backbone. I'm not sure if the game will let me set up there since it's a marked location. Basically I want a nice view, somewhere not too obvious but paradoxically somewhere close to a road for potential trading opportunities.
---
nice..help.when your armor pieces have +1 strength..also if i had deep pocketed on all pieces i would.be up there..but i have 1 biocommesh and a sleek  ..ultra light etc
---
You didn't do enough damage that is what happened. If you want to be at the fight be there to kill adds or try and get enough damage to loot the queen. I know a few groups including mine that can take her down in 2-5 minutes and most people dont get loot because they show up late or dont do enough damage.
---
For those wondering this is closer to investigator's cabin, just down the road. Had my camp there a few months ago, emnity encounters all the time. 11/10 would recommend.
---
Bummer ha! Google a place where honey beasts spawn, they drop like 5 at a time. Sure there's a shack somewhere that spawns like 3 of them.
---
Yeah, 2 in the broken entrance to the courtyard and inside there’s a few more, and lots of super-mutants so I scrap weapons there and lead on the dumbbells in middle of the courtyard.
---
I barely even get that far. Almost every time I capture a workshop, launch a nuke, or activate a group event my game crashes... 
---
It’s pretty much 9/10 times and it takes away a huge part of the game for me.
---
Take mentats to boost intelligence to increase your odds of learning mods when scrapping.
---
Awesome! I've been farming top of the world for them. Good to know I have another place because it's getting old. Thanks man.
---
Likely will be in coming weeks so you might not have very long more to wait.
---
looks normal all the toxic valley is covered in light gray ash
---
Dont fight near events. If you gotta fight near an event, join it, hide, go to pipboy, in data find the event, and press the reject button.
---
Well i cant think of any other reason because that wasn't a visual glitch.. those were snow textures.
---
What's that chat UI? Looks neat
---
Its nice for couples who play together and want to role play. But beyond selling it for an ok amount of caps it doesn't do anything.
---
I've kinda scoped out the entire map and if it's immediately in a spot with an icon, you can't build but if your marker is "near" but not on, then you'd be surprised how close to an area you can build outside the major cities. The small points of interest have a very small area excluded generally.
---
It happened to me that sometimes if you shoot a mob to early before it die from another player/npc you don't get anything, you have to keep shooting at it time to time. I guess after some seconds or minutes the game lose your last hit register.
---
 Happened a lot to me at Fort Defiance with the Event to kill SB.
---
When i logged in again the plants had lost their white coating so its not the normal ash.
---
Those might not be all the locations. I stumbled upon the herder bot and his named brahmin in the heart of the Cranberry Bog last night as I was trying to spawn a megasloth for the challenge, and not having done Free Range before, I thought, 'wait a minute, haven't I read about this new event?', and sure, a 3* lvl 80 sheepsquatch started to attack them! I took it down, saved most of the brahmin.
---
Funny about it: I never got the event started notification, but there was a rewards notification after the sheepsquatch went down, unnamed though, but I got caps, ammo and mats. I don't think I got one of those plans, but I'd have to check again to be sure.
---
This was halfway between Drop Site G3 and Superior Sunset Farm, a common random encounter spawn point. Random encounters don't have &lt;event completed&gt; notifications, though, so it was like the game couldn't decide if it was the one or the other. ;-)
---
Again good &amp; bad.
---
If they do this while still allowing Turret camps behind the whitesprings golf house, it will be horrid doing anything there.
---
Damn I just recently threw out a bunch to make room for a legendary... But if you'd like I'll start collecting them again and let you know when I have a bunch?
---
I vote they introduce set specific mods for PA that would give people reason to use them. Poor raider and t45 get nearly no attention. They're only good for leveling new toons from levels 15-35 as it stands.
---
thats bullshit you shouldnt be able to use them with PA
---
PC :)
---
Yeah, I have no room in my perks for weight reduction, so it has to go in the stash - where it weighs 1.4 lbs
---
yeah, if you find a bloodied explosive shotgun warn me :3
---
I wouldn't be surprised if it was just a glitch. Had my game go randomly white before.
---
I guess I really need to brave and finally get 76 . They’ve supported it non stop since release
---
I’ll message you
---
That's why the main quest is so streamlined to keep you in the Forest until after you get it. It's Bethesda trying to prevent you meeting a Scorchbeast until after you have the vaccine. There's no canon explanation as to why you don't get the plague if you don't have the vaccine. From a story perspective, the game assumes you got the Responders' vaccine before leaving the Forest, because that is the expectation/intent. From a game/programming perspective, you can't get the plague because there are no in-game mechanics to support it.
---
It does drop like that. I git one too.
---
Will do haha
---
You want a gatling laser or gatling plasma.
---
Did you know there's one fever blossom on the entire map? Crazy stuff huh
---
Yes and it was glorious
---
All my instances of pvp in survival have been because I've gone after it. So rarely see people just wonderimg around. Personally I like the mode as is. I think having the ability to disable weapon and armour prefixs could make it more interesting and level it out.
---
Didn’t they recently decrease how fast you can level up though? I’m not sure praising them for bringing you back to normal leveling speed is really necessary
---
Only 2 deep pocket and radicool a serious perk
---
Craft and scrap is your best option. 
---
I know that for the Gauss it's mainly NV scope mods that are available via the Enclave vendor, though surprisingly I found a Large Capacitor mod in the wild.
---
oh yeh..im always runnin radicool
---

My issue is quite a big one and I really think I'm going to just stop playing Fallout forever because of it. As an example Today I spent 2k caps on a the Assualtron recall circuit thingy with a vender, made the card and then started the Encrypted event only to have the Sheepsquatch never show up. Well he did, but just not anywhere near the event area. The game acted like he was there, but he clearly wasn't. So we failed that event in epic fashion! This wouldn't be a big issue except that everytime I play in any event in fallout76 I seem to get screwed almost 90% of the time. Put it to you this way, I'm almost a lvl 130 and all I do is walk around the map. I've never done any of the main quest missions, never launched a nuke and it's because of all the issues I've faced playing this game. Let me tell you there's nothing like being shown how crappy you are as a lvl 12 by having a lvl 50 Scorchbeast follow you across the map killing you every step of the way often times before the game can even respond that you just respawned...Good times! I wasn't even allowed to have Power Armor until I was a lvl 50 because I had accidentally picked up the Veil of Secrets as a lvl 5 and it registered as armor that was too high level and therefore I couldn't enter the Powerarmor, but it's a quest item that hadn't been completed yet so I couldn't get rid of it. In total I've only been able to successfully loot a Scorchbeast Queen that I killed or help kill three maybe four times of the 30+ times I've done it. I've also had Legendary enemies drop things like only steel scrap, a crappy ass drill...Ohhhh isn't that cool and my favorite is the spinning wheel of loading just to load nothing! I also get conveniently disconnected a lot right at the moment we beat the big boss. Now to be clear, I have a very good internet connection and a very good modem. Often times my connection is the host in xbox matchmaking services. I also don't have any of these disconnection issues with any other game or streaming services I use. I don't know what to do anymore. Bethseda can you help me understand why this game sucks so bad?
---
ESP with the lasted change that only the top 3 players show up base on kills and not longest time alive.  Makes it easier to stay off the radar for sure.
---
I beg to differ : there is a lot of content and it's totally possible to DO things, but doing them level 80 or 500 brings no difference. 
---
Level 50 you don't have yet all perks you might need (unless you've been incredibly lucky with perks packs), hence my reference to 80. 
---
I still haven't fully visited the map (I hate caves), I'm faaaaaaar from having all plans, don't even get me started on mr futzy's mask, and I have probably not listened to all of the overseer's holotapes.
---
There's a lot of content. There's just no point in leveling.
---
well it was a fine system for a single player game that the lore came from npc's but with a focus on notes and holos they need to rethink how info is stored
---
Yeah but there is no reason why the tips of the flora would be white, that is not their normal texture
---
Not bait. Actually happened. Gotta get my power trip somehow, since this game doesn't know how to create it.
---
Break 500 with back pack is the goal
---
Hey! I remember you! You glitched into my friends house and lounged on his couch for a good while :o
---
where are we gonna get the backpack from?
---
There's a vendorbot responder in the middle of town
---
I would say Bethesda has done an ok job fitting into the lore, though I've found a couple things that bother me. Like why does Nukashine use Nuka Cola Quantum? It was just released the day the bombs dropped. So why is it an ingredient in a pre-war moonshine recipe? A moonshine that, based on the terminal entries, was well established before the bombs fell, meaning they were making a lot of it. Using an ingredient that they shouldn't have had access to.
---
If you can’t find it, wait. Eventually it will turn into a metal pile (robot meatpile) where it was killed and you’ll be able to loot it. I did that last night and the three other players that stuck around were able to loot it too.
---
Have a toon just charisma based for buying stuff and you can't get the price under 17500 for mutation serums
---
That is a fantastic picture
---
Been around since BETA. Except day 1 when it uninstalled itself lol
---
I'm probably gonna hold off on moving until player vending drops, see how that works, then decide. I like the spot i'm in at the moment but i'd like to live somewhere that feels part of the map not some awkward box sticking out like a sore thumb. Kinda hoping Bethesda are gonna add more building options to the CAMP, it's too limited at the moment. All I really want is the ramshackle wooden walls and exterior fences from 4 to be added back in.
---
Its either an encounter or event. OP is an encounter.
---
Dont know yet
---
I'm an old micro armor guy, so my unit scale.migjt be off with my remarks.  The first thing that comes to mind is identify what kinds of battles that you want to fight...close? Ranged? Ambush?  Choke points? Box canyon?  The FO terrain has it all.
---
I’ve heard that the bos and enclave being in the appalachia breaks the lore as well, but that could be wrong. I’m really not too sure.
---
Both.
---
I would think over all the intend is to provide a challenge to the gameplay. Even if it is a simple easy irritating one.
---
Would be too easy to roam threw in PA rad free all the time in a unlimited Gatling laser 🤔
---
removing damage from players unless you are wanted or they are in pvp with you. npc can still atack it though
---
Watoga has towers that are really cool since you can hop from one to the other and there are many ways to get up on them
---
I leveled 1-50 in 2 hours of actual game play last night. It would have been 1 hour if people hadn't been screwing around lol. I had no armor and a level 1 pipe rifle with about 1,000 rounds of .38. Thank you double XP!
---
[Blackwater mine doesn't look normal....](https://youtu.be/cN6HS5pdx08) too. 
---
From your photos it looks normal to me tho.
---
PA is much worse in a lot of ways, such as effects and pvp. this just make since, its not like you couldnt have a backpack on the back of your pa, they just are using this as a compromise
---
OP confuses his problems with Bethesdas actions with community being dead and nonexistent. Its not possible to mix them up and remain right.
---
The truth is that since the release of survival mode the largest flaw of this game - standing on crossroad between catering to Coop people and catering to PvP people - has been solved.
---
It currently is an extremely interesting PvP environment, but if you dont play it in 4 person team you're locked out of the funniest thing it can provide. Its also an excellent exploration game with superb environmental storytelling.
---
Its also being modified and improved on a regular basis. This is not how dead games look like.
---
And don't get me wrong - I disagree with the existence of repair kits and I refuse to purchase them. I dont like utility items being available in shop either. I share the slippery slope concerns, but man these repair kits fortunately are pretty shitty and their improved version drops only ingame. Honestly as a bad thing being implemented this is the least bad route for it. Also, they said if they receive any nonimaginative confirmation that repair kits are in fact used as tactical advantage not QoL improvements they gonna remove it. I intend to raise my voice against them if these concerns will be proven valid and if they dont keep up their word.
---
A single piece isn't op it is when you have a full set, the you take 15% less damage stacked 5 times means it ignores 85% of incoming damage as long as you aren't moving. The trick is to wedge yourself in a place you can't be moved or staggered. That is what breaks it, the ability to make it so they can't knock you out of sentinels damage reduction.
---
the purveyor better talk like the resident evil 4 merchant or im gonna be slightly disappointed
---
Go to the parking lot at the water park top of the map. May need to sever hop a few times but he will show up by the car that faces the park entrance.
---
Where I found him after 5 hops.
---
1-2 spawn at the end of the Free Range event other wise they are also random spawns, I don't know if there are any static spawns for them, so far I only bumped into one randomly in the mire during a the messenger event
---
I guess it makes the same sense as trying to eat radiated meat?
---
Yeah if I try to collect all of them I can spend my caps quicker. I already got a few from queen drops and another few from other players, the ones I don't have aren't very useful for my play style (like empathy, herbivore etc) so I haven't felt the need to get them all. Maybe I will when there is absolutely nothing else to do.
---
Grahm has a lot of plans that only spawn on him, from Camp Plans to weapon plans
---
It's ash, and the plants are just showing a sun effect. The reason it wasn't there the next time, is that it was a different time of day.
---
Spend enough time in TV, and you'll see it more.
---
Were talking about survival, the gun breaking mid fight isn't the issue, it's being able to repair everything without uncrouching, meaning you never show up on the map when you are on the leaderboard.
---
Is the inaccury of the gattling plasma not an issue when fighting scorchbeasts (in the air)?
---
I have enemies I didn't die against drop two legendaries on occasion in my 700+ hours, but never more than that. Never noticed anything like your case with mobs I repeatedly died from. Gets me thinking what if the Behemoth that killed me three times last night had been legendary?
---
Teamed up with your friend? Maybe they engaged him.
---
It isn't a 100% chance, I know this for a fact because my main runs a combat shotgun with max enforcer.
---
VATS headshot 100% miss on super mutant head while sneaking, could be a hitbox issue.
---
  
---
Camera and photomode or emote will catapult players
---
Missing stats UI on weapons and armor after certain conditions such as workbench inspection
---
They totally have fish too. I saw some while under water before. Of course you phase through them/non interactive, but there’s a piece of it there already.
---
This actually sounds like a thrilling time to me. Better than the same boring event.
---
Reread the patch notes they announced the repair kit. They specify a fridge for your camp you can buy with atoms. Not talking about the backpacks at all.
---
text chat mod on nexusmods. the game is wonderful when you can chat with others in game
---
From my experience all ballistic weapons are better than laser weapons but probably the ultracite laser.
---
how long before it turns to a metal pile..i hung around.for a good half hour..
---
Dataminers found they were being added in on next DLC with the nuclear winter.
---
I almost think because of the restrictions in size placed on us in FO76, it forces you to get a bit more creative and resourceful; this post being a great example of utilising the environment.
---
Dataminers figurdd out the zetans will be added in same time as nuclear winter launches
---
I was [here](https://imgur.com/a/gq36P38) for a while, nice place with lead and water. Best of all was the waterfall.
---
It’s called “Free Range”
---
Ladydevann has said multiple times to keep reporting bugs on this subreddit fkr them to see.
---
You have to complete then quest, then you get the plan for a zoom lense.
---
Once all the other robots  do. It may be affected by the number of people hanging around.
---
ok..
---
😂😂😂
---
I mean, in the itv they said that there is a fridge mod for the backpack? And at no point have they said they are 100% releasing a fridge to the atom shop
---
Pretty damn nice! I'm sweating just looking at it!!!!!1
---
The event has spawned in the forest twice for me. It's waaaay easier to protect the cows in the forest vs the mire.
---
Greg's mine supply comes to mind with its canyon, high ground, and buildings.
---
Gotta be sprinting. That Sprinting
---
melee attack is really powerful once you master it.
---
I am well aware of the PVP aspect of workshop claiming.  I am also aware that in order for PVP to be initiated, one ought to own the workshop and have it be attacked, be attacked by another and still attack back, or have a claim staked against it.  I had LOST the workshop, and had died MULTIPLE times to this person, and after deciding to stop attempting to take the workshop back or “Seek Revenge”, I simply chose to “Respawn” at my own CAMP.  This person came to my CAMP at that point, began destroying it, and consistently, across MULTIPLE deaths and RESPAWNS (not *Seek* *Revenge*) they attacked without me attacking back.
---
I have been playing since the B.E.T.A.  I am aware of how these things are supposed to work.  Do not condescend to me, please.
---
I just fought this fucker in the Mire. Bastard is even bigger when it ain’t hunched over lol
---
Free Range.
---
When I got the quest and went to the cave, there was not a wendigo outside.
---
  Into the cave, killed the (mirelucks and mireluck kings) inside, then found the Wendigo @ the waterfall.  After killing it, I was awarded the caps, etc, and the quest went away. 
---
   Finished the play session, logged off.
---
  When I logged in for the next play session, the same quest in the same location was back on the active quest list.  Since I was nearby, did it again.
---
Same result.
---
(BTW Killing a wendigo while wearing a a clown outfit anywhere other than the marked location does not count for the quest.)
---
Qucktraveling away and back usually speeds up turning it into a pile. Works for me every time it goes invis.
---
Looks so cozy) nice work!
---
This is good stuff but I have looted way more that 180 items elsewhere in the world and still no respawn. No idea if his theory is 100% accurate but it's definitely worth testing. The one mystery that someone has yet to solve is that Thompson SMG hardened receiver. Does the plan or even the receiver itself even exist.
---
I'm getting a lot of bright green and purple neon textures lately, even after the initial load in they don't disappear for several minutes.
---
Initially, my photos WERE there.  Several updates ago, the pictures vanished and none of the "new" pictures save.  I've tried getting help from Bethesda, but photos are WAY down on their list of important.
---
I started my first character upon day 1, got it to level 25, and stopped playing for a bit because I felt like they still had work to be done with general glitches. 
---
I started a new character when the game went on sale, and my friend got the game 🤠 it is a lot more enjoyable and challenging than the early days, and it’s even more fun if you have a bro/broette with you.
---
The crook rings the bell on swing too. Great for annoying people, not that I would ever do that in game.
---
Super duper helps a ton when you craft them for scrapping. Just be sure to Scrap them one at a time in the craft menu rather than scrapping all of them at once in your inventory.
---
 Also the level 1 version gives you the same mods the level 50's do.  So much cheaper to craft the lowest level possible.
---
 Weapons are pretty easy to get mods for when crafting/scrapping for mods. It was the armor I had trouble with.
---
Are you also aware of the hypocrisy of that last statement?
---
Initially, my photos were in My Games/Fallout 76/Photos.  Several updates ago, the pictures vanished and none of the "new" pictures save.  Last save was 22 Feb, 2019. I've tried getting help from Bethesda, but photos are WAY down on their list of important.
---
Thank you! This happened to me yesterday. I died 5 times before I realized what the other person was doing.
---
which is why this double exp event is both a blessing and a curse. I just bought this game and no doubt I will be 50 already by the end of the weekend.
---
I’m being hypocritical how?  You assuming I didn’t know how Workshops worked is incredibly condescending.
---
You missed out that the game still has huge stutter / hitching / freezing problems during combat. The game can freeze for 0.5 to a few seconds when firing or swining a melee weapon.
---
My dude, it looks nowhere near brown. That picture shows exactly what it looks like, the blackish smokey color of coal.
---
 I don’t know which species is worse. You don’t see them f\*\*\*ing each other over for a goddamn percentage.
---
I did it at thirty and got a level 45, not sure if that's typical will take a few more answers to know
---
Also players getting stuck inside player made structures when using fast travel to their base.
---
I didn't see you mention if you were in pacifist mode or not so that might be your issue.
---
Double xp weekend? Well, que pay to win micro trans next.
---
Would be even cooler if we could plug it into the computer at our camp, or at least play them sitting down lol
---
It is a smokey black color with chrome looking strips of metal at certain parts.
---
This has given me an idea. You could easily do this over voice chat. Might try it out and see what people think..
---
I'll find someone who wants a good heavy weapon and let them have it. Thanks for the offer though. 
---
I'd rather give it to someone for free who will use it.
---
Found the tourist at the cemetery in toxic valley within fifteen minutes of searching, didn’t server hop at all and just visited the northern speculated locations. Got super lucky
---
me too! I'm into botany irl so this would be a dream lol
---
You can respawn at the closest known location of your death, at your camp and I thought v76.
---
They're a random spawn encounter. I see them a lot at the hwy 65 sign, and at the spot N of munitions factory.
---
Yea but voice chat is only when your standing near by. But still cool try it out
---
The only changes to workshops have been to make it easier to contest. I think they want it this way. 
---
Just wait until you see a team doing this. One guy visibly contesting your workshop, one guy in stealth mode right behind you who's been following you for 10 minutes.
---
I'd play "survival" if they get rid of the leader board and that stupid noise and message when somebody kills somebody else.
---
 Sucks too because I wanted a real survival based version of this game but I don't get it with the arcade crap they released. 
---
 The way they designed at their PVP survival server is nothing more than a death match.
---
 Makes absolutely no sense in the fallout world that we all came out of the same vault and start killing each other over and over again.  It is completely lore and immersion breaking. 
---
 Why they couldn't have just made a adventure mode with unrestricted PVP is confusing to me.
---
I cant believe they havent done a hotfix for all the new bugs. This one sucks I just started to do the event and was looking forward to it this weekend.
---
I’ve gotten some of my best items at white springs . The rock band event is good but it’s spawn time is shit
---
Ahhh I forgot proximity chat. It wouldn’t work because of that. Alternatively could start a party or discord and do the same thing? I’m gonna have a think about more ways this could be done.
---
I agree with you completely on the lore part but I've just given up on trying to change anything and just accept what ever bethesda shoves down our throats
---
Except for the Armor Plated backpacks, I don't think any backpacks will give buffs to stats other than carry weight.
---
Nope. I did the same test for West Tek, doing 50 runs, and it was the same. Yes, there is *almost* always a 3* Legendary Super Mutant, but they drop the same 1* crap.
---
I wish I hadn't deleted the note in which I wrote all the information, but I had one of those "no one will care about this shit anyway" moments.
---
One does not simply walk to Fissure Prime
---
It says in the menu it’s part of the casual underarmour.  Should mean it follow its stats and upgrades for that series
---
Is 2x xp in both survival and adventure
---
this is the method I used, worked great!  thanks for this, wish I had known it was this simple sooner
---
The free range event. It spawns in one of three (maybe four) spots. By the southern belle motel, Fred’s bbq shack, or the very north west of the map iirc
---
How much Atom for this beauty? Not in home right now...
---
Shhh
---
Guess I put my foot in my mouth with that one huh? I'm in the works of sorting out a heavy weapons build for my next project, just haven't started it yet. Have a melee build &amp; just finished my VATS build, next was either heavy weapons or energy build. Not trying to get something for free but between vendoring &amp; trying to play the game without getting bored there seems to be little time for new ideas. It would be helpful if I could just buy the weapon off someone selling it to save me time, lmk if you'd reconsider. Thanks.
---
Love mine too, the mini is highly effective against boss and crowd mobs.
---
Lol you gotta whack em in the butt, only way to keep those Brahmin movin’! 
---
Gotta admit I was doing it to those Brahmin and the robots at the Fasnacht parade as well
---
You can insert them into the computer in your CAMP. The one you use to adjust light settings and what not! 
---
I got mine set up with a sweet view of the mega red rocket workshop!
---
I believe a while back it was added in that players are required to be able to do a set amount of minimal damage. This was design to deter low level players trying to sneak in on the action for easy point, which in return boost the SBQ health even higher making it harder and harder for the rest of the high level end game player.
---
My alt character was able to par take until I did the enclave quest line and was up around lv49 before I was able to get loot and exp
---
Nuke herpes fery, or grafton. If you can respawn those super muties with relog, you may have egouth 3\* ones there.
---
Or you know, just farm SBQ. You will have 200caps per run atleast if not good legendary.
---
Nice! Love hearing these stories, the 76 community really can be awesome.
---
No forkin’ way, gotta do that later and load up Nuka Tapper lol
---
Rock band event?
---
Ye but survival have another bonus.
---
Yes you can upgrade it if you have the plans
---
I’m a melee build but use Gattling plasma for SBQ. Just wait for her to land as you usually would as a melee build. Esp if you have twisted muscles like me.
---
Do it man it's awesome! I'm on level 7 of nuka tapper. Man it gets hard after that haha
---
&gt;&amp; our power armour
---
pa is not that  viable in pvp
---
and carfull theres an imortal (you dont lose hp) esp/aimbot with damage stacking hacking flying around. cought a few people using it .  dont know if that guy was hacking but be carful
---
VATS is auto-aim on all platforms.
---
Anyways, there could be an item capable of being placed on the favorite wheel for console too, no?
---
More content, more stability, tweaks here and there, PvP oriented gamemode where math is somewhat different and you can kill godrolled enemies by craftable weapons.
---
I second this. I have 3 characters 50 and above and I like to hit max level before even starting the story (max level rewards) The last 2 I would do a penitentiary/Grafton/Morgantown airport circuit. Penitentiary and Grafton have a lot of supermutants. Additionally the penitentiary and Grafton have 2 events each and the airport has 1 for event xp. Then sell collected weapons (Or break them down to learn mods) at the Grafton train station. Although I will say it has been difficult to get any events to start at the penitentiary.
---
Killed the scorchbeast queen the other day and got 5 rounds of .45 ammo. Nothing else
---
[I will eat them for you.](https://youtu.be/MvjbOZOuTCg)
---
I had someone invulnerable like this last night on Xbox.
---
That’s it, I know what I’m doin later. Gonna make it my mission to find all those Holotape Games
---
The thing is 3* legendary mobs are more common in West Tek than they are in Whitesprings.
---
Even if it's a low chance a 3* legendary mob can drop 3* items.
---
Whitesprings diseased ghouls will always only drop 1* items, and when you add to that the rarity of 3* legendary mobs in whitesprings you'll reach the same conclusion as i did.
---
We know?
---
I love how we apparently need a new thread asking this same question every couple of pages...
---
iirc you are suppose to wait for them to regenerate health before killing them, it makes them drop a legendary after that
---
Personally I think it’s a waste of design and atoms.  How many ppl run threw the game in just their underarmour for show? Lol
---
Idk but you can look it up and tell me, that would be great
---
Wow it’s almost like that’s the exact description for wastelanders! (Besides you know, the wastelanders....)
---
Me?
---
I just got a buddy to start playing yesterday and we had nothing but issues with the social menu. At first we couldn't see each others proper status (online vs menu) after two rounds of logging in and out we could see each other, then for some reason he couldn't teleport to me (option was missing) so we just walked from place to place. Then his social menu started having sync problems. Honestly I was embarrassed for the game that he had issues with such a basic part of a social game.
---
You don't fight the SBQ in the air.
---
Let me know if you find em man! I'm still looking for Automatron, Red Menace and Wastelad
---
If you can make them and sell them cheaper than buying from a vendor then yeah
---
This happened to me the other day. I started up the plant and ran off. While I was working on perfecting my camp (cuz that’s what I spend 50% of my time doing), some fun snuck up behind be and began a montage of killing me. He even invited me to a party and tried to insult me but got super frustrated when the only response I had for him was ‘Thank You!’
---
You said you died a few times?
---
Someone else mentioned they died twice and received three legendary items.
---
That sounds to me like a glitch, each time you die and return it's respawning the legendary item for him as if you were encountering the enemy for the first time.
---
Perhaps with each death it's going to add another random item to the enemy until you kill it. With the proper set up and a lot of deaths maybe you could farm a single legendary bad guy for lots of gear.
---
I can only reach one conclussion: both places are crap. And every other place is crap. Truth is, the loot tables were rigged from the start.
---
Although I wouldn’t be able to fit this into my camp design, I still think this would be really awesome!
---
It's XP gains like we used to get back in the beginning before they nerfed it.  It's a nice little throwback though, not gonna lie.
---
Did this yesterday, I rate it a 3/10 bc my cows all died :(
---
PC players got Fallout 1 , 2 and Tactics ...Zilch for console players.
---
Camp venture. It’s like an old civil war fort going up a rocky hillside to a helipad.
---
West Tek also takes more ammo to clear, and more Stims. Super Mutants are way tougher than ghouls that you can practically one shot.
---
I saw a photo of a weighted sheepsquatch staff as well
---
But if you didn’t tag it it will not appear...
---
It might always drop at max level, but if I were you, I wouldn't risk it dropping at a lower level. And you can easily control that: just do everything but the final straw with your survival character, and then just reload your main char into survival at your camp to finish up (e.g. scrap one last melee weapon).
---
If your camp is at an only slightly remote location, the risk involved is minimal.
---
For anyone on PS4 that nonetheless doesn't feel like doing the challenge but wants the weapon (or last week's The Guarantee) for collecting purposes, I have both for sale, max level, 2000 caps each.
---
I don't know if there will be a fridge mod for the backpacks, all they've said is you can get your first backpack in game.
---
I'm not talking about backpacks though, I'm talking about what they said in ITV when they announced the repair kits. They said specifically, "we are also looking to add a fridge to your camp to slow spoilage, a way to convert ammo, and a way to send stuff to your stash from anywhere in the atom shop."
---
I would say the names of them to stop people from potentially being cheated out of caps but don't know about reddits witch hunt rules.
---
If you see a person or two with a name that starts with V heading toward your workshop on adventure mode, just log off unless you want to clip them to send in a report.
---
I killed about 20 scorch beasts yesterday (they spawn on my base) and 6 corpses disappeared before I could loot them. A bunch of the scorch bodies also disappeared but I didn't keep track of those.
---
Duh your supposed to wear the vciva war dress and the imposter sheep squatch head only way you can complete it
---
Once again you are being pedantic. My meaning was garbage gear with garbage effects aside from sentinel gear. I'm not going to go google exactly what the name of the shitty gear is aside from wood, trappers or robotic, I believe are the two garbage types that everyone sells. 
---
My point was that you can easily find sentinel armor in the vendors if you don't care about the other effects or what type of armor it is on.
---
Yeah, if you have the mats its 100c, either than that 500 per
---
I have to agree. WS was great for leveling up, but not so good for getting legendary items. I've been lucky enough to grab some 3 star weapons and they have all come from legendaries in events (Wendigo at Dane's, Surface to Air) but just as many from random encounters with legendaries as I was out exploring the map. Fast travel less, explore more.
---
Good to know, the guys I play with were asking about this last night.  Thanks for the info.
---
I done this once so far, got the recipe for the Meat Pie and the Plan for the Shephard's Crook
---
I know. But that should not be the case.
---
800, and time-limited.
---
You get the "platform login error" and maybe 4:7:2000?
---
I've been pestered with that error since about halfway of previous patch. Nothing on my network setup has changed. I am behind ISP NAT anyway.
---
If while ingame, I check the friend list, it usually goes totally blank. It will work little later again. But I never can change char or server, without full restart, because my login seems to expire. 
---
Sometimes, like right after patch, if I check the atom shop for too long, like 2 mins, my login expires, and I have to restart the game to play at all.
---
Wow, that actually looks like what I was hoping for. Deal!
---
Super Mutants are indeed tougher but it's still just 1 shot 1 kill.
---
I'm using instigating hunting rifle / instigating lever action (lvl 35). The hunting rifle performs a bit better due to perforating magazines but if i let my HP go down to ~30 for adrenal reaction, the lever action starts to one shot mutants too.
---
Its been this way since launch, if they didn't want it to work that way they would have changed it when they took out the ability to contest at the workbench.
---
Pretty sure it's a feature, not a bug.
---
This is exactly what I'm looking for Sevan, where is the treehouse?
---
&gt;its not like you couldnt have a backpack on the back of your pa
---
Probably the best point I've seen regarding this. They just don't want to deal with animating that lol
---
I think he means the event at Dane's
---
This is very funny and disturbing :D
---
but I already have 15 strength /s
---
You playing on PC? I'd be happy to help you level and shit
---
Yup. This guy posted his gamertag last night and when I joined the queen wasn't even in the nuke zone and she wouldn't land. We got her down pretty low but time was running out. All of a sudden at 40 or so seconds she touches down and I could hear my Xbox huffing and puffin after everyone stumbled over each other to get hits in. Right as the timer hits 10 seconds she flys up and bogeys on outta there. Failed the event and wasted  a shameful amount of ammo on account of my aim being terrible and also playing the game at 6 frames per second. Sometimes it be that way.
---
If you drop an orbital strike and leave the server the strike still occurs and you don't get the caps. :D however, the 450 caps is worth it.
---
That's an amazing camp!
---
yah i get that
---
If they ever add fishing it will be like BotW where you just swim and pick up fish lol

You just said unrestricted pvp in survival was lore breaking, then asked for it in adventure. If the pvp mechanics in adventure were like survival, players would do what players do, and kill each other over and over. 
---
Why? Did you miss the millions of posts before survival came out about people grieving and killing? A huge portion of players don’t want to deal with it.
---
No. It's not.
---
anyone playing from launch is playing another game
---
That sounds about right, yeah. I've had it since BETA.
---
Half the time when i check my friends list it goes blank, then when i reopen it shortly after it says desynced and prompts me to contact customer support. After a couple minutes it comes back.
---
2 minutes sounds right. If i take too long running the ghoul house while i relog to grind it, i have to reboot the game as well.
---
I guess... it's... sort of comforting... that I'm not alone in this? I guess?
---
Yes, this is the only type of quest I've had since I got Radant lager I think
---
Cool, thank for the info!
---
Where on earth did you even hear this?
---
Not everyone runs a bloodied build, though. 
---
All I'm saying is that Legendary loot, as a whole, is pretty bad. Doesn't matter where you go.
---
I have good weapons, and all of them I got from trading. I did't have much to sell, so I started buying inferior weapons and slowly climbed up from there. But in more than 200 levels between my two characters, not a single good weapon has ever dropped for me from a Legendary creature. That's when you know there's something wrong.
---
Puntastic!
---
Would be interesting if it was just a basic model of a Watchtower with connecting / snap parts so you can build walkways off from the watchtower.
---
Champion, thank you!

Doing the Encryptid event in the ash heap

The imposter sheepsquatch fight at the end of the lying Lowe quest
---
How do you think I felt, I'm a melee only build lol, I don't even carry a gun, it was so damn hard and my 204 dmg Grognak Axe it was a nightmare because the melee range on that weapon is pathetic so I was wiffing all my hits
---
Mind sharing it's location. 400 hrs and still haven't found one.
---
I need to find another spot. A cool spot that is. I wish we could place it up on those skyway ring things.
---
SERIOUSLY!!
---
Did you find him at that brahmin farm run by the mr handy? That's where he ambushed me
---
I'm not running bloodied. I'm using Instigating weapons but i do have the adrenal reaction mutation. There's no reason to not use it. 
---
I got all of my stuff by farming myself, never traded for anything.
---
This seems logical and likely
---
You could kneel down and drop it in front of someone you want to team up with then send them an invite.
---
The ring would just sort of sweeten the deal.
---
I'm L68 now - and still have 2 or 3 golfers to go.
---
  I think it is -  in part - for the mysteries quest segment that sends you to WS.  
---
  The acquired weapon does 21 dmg -  which is not effective against most of the things in WS, but would work on the unruly golfers, and satisfy one of the 6 critter kills required to complete that mysteries quest segment.
---
That’s very kind , I’m on Xbox though
---
Don't give them ideas 😣
---
Meh, would rather it did. I haven't played in months simply because I have nowhere to put my stuff, I'm really over encumbered and for this game to be even half fun, I'd rather not have to do hourly scrap runs to fix all my stuff.
---
Unless you have a really strong legendary, you have to shoot too much and your shit just breaks all the time.
---
No idea what mats I’d need so couldn’t tell you that one. I would want 2 serums I think.
---
I would like to see CAMP minigames with leaderboards for your CAMP and server wide. Also CAMP minigames that are a "PvP" or darts and pool.
---
Ah, I see, I read wrong.
---
Well, maybe that's the reason why you have a lvl 35 Instigating Hunting Rifle, man.
---
I have several available for immediate delivery, modded &amp; repaired to 200% for 500 caps
---
GT= Medieval Paul
---
I have the outfit and head if you wanna buy it.
---
&gt;Bethesda needs to see this
---
Why?
---
thank you so much, yes I've noticed that.. no one activates the dam pylons..
---
Not likely, they didn't even reward the loyal paying customers for the deluxe editions with exclusive stuff, and you think they would add exclusive stuff just for people who've played it?
---
yeh the latest patch messed things up..try using an emote with ylur camera out..lol teleported.me.across the map
---
imgur.com/gallery/HmMvUhb
---
Unacceptable!
---
All I wanted to was put my plushies in my bed. I feel you.
---
good.idea
---
Mmm I love the game, but also loved building in fo4. Be warned there are A LOT more restrictions, not just a “few” and it can get a bit frustrating. 
---
There are also issues with camps/blueprints falling into a mode where it just says they are “floating” and it prevents you from placing it back down.
---
I personally believe it’s the area of the game that currently needs the most TLC from Bethesda
---
I once found one at the Watoga train station. I think it’s either random or you just stumble upon the place someone not interested with the camera sold it to.
---
So what was the max level for you (i'm assuming a greater than lv 50 char)?  Did it spawn at 50?
---
Are there no Marvel games then?
---
Buy it at Whitesprings from a vendor. Don’t remember which one. The ghouls there are dropping them as well.
---
Scrolling through inventory items isn't playing the game dude. Do you like doing your taxes too?
---
He's really fun, and very useful for looking up how to maximize damage from various weapons.
---
I knew I wasn’t the only one! There’s another patch in two weeks so hopefully that helps us out.
---
Thank you, I have the Bad news Billy one, so it is not a priority right now,
---
I just wanted to know to try it myself, if I should spend some caps I would do that
---
for an explosive pump rifle
---
I've only seen 2 so far .... I was...around Summerville....cleared the main gate on the SE side - hung a left to bypass the rest of the town and go over the mountain...and there was a pair of them.
---
Just placing a comment as I would also like to find a broken Pro Camera Delux. I dropped mine - lost mine - whatever and it ain't got in my inventory or stash.
---
I have caps, some rare clothes, a 2 Star radium rifle and a t-60 Elder paint.
---
I do...which is why I was asking. I want to have the heavy weapons alternative especially for the enemies I can't reach easily with melee. Getting an alternative weapon that works in the exact same situation as my current one doesnt really make that much sense to me.
---
Mostly bounding boxes and collision boxes but sometimes you'll get lucky and manage to find a loophole
---
Just some harder enemies I think. People in end game are looking for challenging stuff to do right now. I think that was the only real issue with it.
---
I enjoyed it as well but was underwhelmed with the "boss". The whole area felt kinda small so I'm hoping they open up more passages and stuff as time goes on.
---
The level 35 one is the lever action rifle. Deals the same amount of damage as a lvl 50 hunting rifle.
---
(mostly kept it just to do some testing if perforating mags really work)
---
My instigating hunting rifle is lvl 50.
---
I do have quite a bit of 3* treasures in my stash too, just waiting for player vending since i'm not patient enough to trade my stuff on reddit.
---
The main point of the post is to inform people that West Tek has a higher chance of dropping something good that whitesprings.
---
I think that would be a bit much. Excavator already gets me to 536, 561 with rads and radicool and 601 with the extra carry weight perk. Then the weight reduction cards. +10 from 5 deep pocketed pieces of armour is 650 and then there’s the backpack. I just want more stash space.
---
I think people wanted more on the brotherhood of steel story that was set up at the beginning but they didn’t build on that.
---
Risky to join a team with someone you don't know,  some guys set traps like this where they have a friend which they are engaged in PvP with and join team and kill you without penalty.  
---
Most players are cool though and helpful, even if you die by a griefer it doesn't matter you don't lose much anyway.
---
Had something weird on Xbox this morning, different to your experience but odd never the less, the event failed as the SBQ health bar didn’t want to move despite a bunch of us pouring thousands of rounds into her but when the event failed she didn’t fly off but stayed, so being a determined lot we just kept going despite little health coming off her bar and about another 15-20 mins after the event failed we killed her and got the loot. I’ve never seen that happen before
---
I saw a fresh grave 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
---
Good bot
---
If you loved building in Fallout 4, particularly with mods, Fallout 76 is going to be a likely dissapointment. There is a huge amount of restrictions, a rather limited set of building options (unless you have a shitload of caps to shell out for plans), and most of the basic wall sets look rather plain/samey.
---
Oh, and both creatures and people can just break your shit. The build limit is also pretty grating if you like building bigger stuff.
---
I hope this is a quarterly event.  Had a great time last night, and forgot how much XP bloated ghouls used to give!
---
Only if you have 9 or less strength. If you have 10 or more, power armour has no effect on strength.
---
I have it as well on PC. I have 4 sets so you can have one.
---
I don't even use PA in nuke zones, I just rock my prototype hazmat suit. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ Yeah, the lack of DR/ER is a thing, but PA ruins my stealth which in turn ruins my whole build; the only real downside is that it still counts against the Chameleon mutation. Which makes no bloody sense and might be a bug. Oh well.
---
Sinks, refrigerators, and cabinets would be great! The new red stove was a step in the right direction.
---
I would like to see a decent looking toilet and some type of shower as well.  I see those spiffy stainless steel toilets all over the place in game.  The shower model is in game as well.
---
Why would they sell for less before there were a lot of them?
---
Wouldn't mind the 7600 hour challenge knocked down to 760 with something nice as a reward.
---
Then idk whats goin on with this mofo for me. i had 4 ws yesterday, got attacked at two of them, and while my turrets attacked back, up until i decided to have some fun and attack back, i took no damage. Then again my roommate has been playing adventure mode as well, and its been taking normal damage from him when he gets attacked in open world, not slap damage. Maybe its just more features
---
This is very true, I'm trying to take a different outlook on griefers 
---
This shit would happen in the real world it's just how you react and learn I guess :) 
---
I do want that kind of Rust feeling though of just all out chaos
---
I’m accepting the fact you have to aim lower build wise and really use the resources of the land. After all bigger isn’t necessarily better , looks like you can make a nice home in fallout 76
---
Well, as for me, the best option to farm legendary is actually wandering everywhere.
---
Because of mainstream legendary farm spot. I actually believe that the roll will better when you actually go alone on wasteland.
---
Within 1 week (actually not gameplay time) i have found 1 aae minigun, 1 instigating with 40% grognak axe. 5 pieces of multi-type armor 3 star that worth trading.
---
P.s: 3 star super mutant drop the best.
---
I can hit 600 in excavator then use weight reduction perks to make it even easier to cart shit around. Having 440 is pretty good for someone not in power armour but it’s not as good as with excavator.
---
I don't know about Cpn. Americas shield....... I would like to see just a shield though. It would add another dimension to fights, especially pvp. 
---
\-riot shields
---
\-trash can lids
---
\-etc.
---
It has slightly better chance at spawning a 3* Legendary that will drop the same shit they drop in White Spring, that is correct.
---
There will be a quest line where you obtain the backpack from. You’ll need to join a faction called the Pioneer Scouts.
---
Call him out
---
Not this time tho,
---
Double exp event is great for that very reason. More and more players understand the real problems of the end game faster.
---
Unless the backpack gives a whopping 150 or more weight, power armour would still win. Excavator anyway. And installing mods like refrigeration lowers the carry weight bonus.
---
Nice those are some really nice drops :)
---
Why would I want to get to the shit parts faster i want to enjoy the game and move on to the next one
---
Its a bit let down because inside just like whitespring 2.0.
---
I expected to fight more enemies type inside there. Not just ghoul and gutsy.
---
Overall the map was well-designed and i lost myself many time in there.
---
Wish to have a system that guide you inside a map like old fo4 local maps.
---
I’ve gotten several off crowned charred ghouls
---
I have the TS auto plasma and am shocked at how much worse it is then my TS lever action or even a modded up normal hand made. Energy weapons in general are still nerfed.
---
There’s refrigeration. There will probably be others.
---
I agree....i find the best stuff when im just wandering the mire or bog, and doing events.   I farm whitesprings when someone else nukes it, but for flux etc. To make ammo.....all the 1*s i usually just sell off to the vendor.
---
I have traded for a few weapons, but ive also found some really good stuff. I dont think ever at WS tho
---
I scrapped 3 shepherds hooks so far. I need to fav one of those hooks sometime if i can remember.
---
How did he kill you? Dont you have to accept pvp to be killed?
---
I have almost all the mods unlocked for both guns so if you want I can mod them for you. But you would have to wait until tomorrow evening.  I'm at work today and have stuff to do tomorrow morning into the afternoon.
---
Damn thata unfortunate and rather disappointing

There are some i cant make but name them and ill see if i can
---
Dude, i can't help you if you want to be upset about everything. 
---
If you meet 3* legendary mobs you have a small chance of getting a 3* item.
---
If you don't meet 3* legendary mobs you have no chance of getting a 3* item.
---
Sure the chance may be low but it's there. 
---
Anyway, keep on moaning and complaining.
---
But a backpack wouldn't make you stronger without power armor either, it would only increase the potential volume you could carry.
---
No, that was fixed awhile back.
---
I have noticed that sometimes if you hit r they will appear in that inventory but not the quick view.
---
If that's the way you feel about it, I'd still say not to buy the game at full price. You can probably find it at some % off somewhere, but at the moment I really cannot recommend this game at a full 60 dollars.
---
That said, there is fun to be had, but I strongly recommend playing this game with friends rather than solo. It's a lot more fun that way, and a lot less frustrating when you run into stupid issues. And you *will* run into stupid issues, because that's this game's forté since release.
---
Yeah..its fun. Moooooooo
---
its better than excavator when u use 5 pieces of wwr..i jump in pa and weight 1100  out of pa i weigh 360..because of all my weapons lol..yeh im a hoarder
---
What!!!!!, F this, the game is trash, even though I have over 450 lvls and 900 hours this is the last straw, I QUIT!!!  :)
---
Don't worry my friend, that should be changed in a future update once we can place inventory items in our camp.
---
ok.sounds good
---
ya, the "old style" trade menu from FO 4 where buy/sell transactions were simultanious would be much better than the one at a time system FO76 uses.
---
I usually only find on 3\* legendary in the whole of Whitesprings even when it's nuked. The thing about this location is that people go there a lot and the ghouls keep re-spawning. This gives you more chances at the 3\* enemies/enemies. When Whitesprings is hopping I still really like going there.
---
With all that being said I have a several random locations I actively farm that are not West tek or Whitesprings.  I have better luck and less competition from other players in these spots.
---
Not respawning. Going to where their ragdoll physics would take their body. If you are using explosives then good luck. Had it happen multiple times. Sometimes the bodies, or meat piles, do just fall through the ground. But I'm finding that kind of rare now. Once in like 50 legendary kills. But that's my experience.
---
You won’t be able to kill it alone but chances are you’ll get at least one high level joining you, so you just need to tag it.
---
Some people have brought up a few of the limitations regarding settlements in fo4 vs fo76, but I would also like to point out something awesome that fo76 has over fo4. You can build your settlement almost anywhere that isn't an already established location. I spend tons of time just exploring looking for new locations that would be a good place to call home.
---
Yeah, that was kind of odd. Their hype and marketing around the content is pretty bad. It’s never actually honest. I was gonna go back because I thought I maybe missed a terminal somewhere. I found something that made it sound like the facility was actually used to supply water to the Whitespring bunker. But that was it. I enjoyed what it was, but I understand being disappointed if you were hyped for a super difficult dungeon
---
I killed two myself yesterday. One on either side of the road just south of Bog Town.
---
The first, I encountered the robot escorting Brahmin. The sheepsquatch spawned in after a few minutes.
---
The second I saw another sheepsquatch across the road surrounded by albino radstags. 
---
Both were 1 star legendaries with a crapton of health. Not difficult otherwise.
---
The reason I asked is because the chrome paint that was just in the store looked white
---
When you die you can’t respawn to your camp? I’ll have to see if that’s a bug.
---
I play by ps4
---
pls take the plunge and never listen to others as much again ; )
---
Ive had this happen to me too....didnt look like TV to me either. It happend to me in the mire....it was a large square of snow. I almost posted a pic, but figured its a glitch from some future release.  It was on the plants and everywhere
---
 Fred’s bbq shack, just server hop, I usually find it 1/4 times.  I think i did it like 9 times last night in about 2 hours.
---
All i did is wandered to all the old location to find out the missing pieces like key, plan, holo/note...
---
Not upset or complaining at all. I don't need Legendaries, I already have the best one could have. 
---
I'm just explaining to you how things work. But hey, keep your head in the sand if you want. *shrug*
---
There have been a bunch of folks who did the challenges at lower levels and got the max level weapons. You should be good to go!
---
And now I just had to deal with 2 people in adventure mode using the 1% health invulnerability glitch to farm caps off people in workshops.
---
They use the exploit where they can cancel the actual taking of the workshop but can still sit there in the workshop area and when workshop owner shows up shoot them and they never die once they reach 1% health.
---
Real fun mechanic, you are basically FORCED now due to glitching/cheating to take workshops ONLY on your lowbie so they won't find you while server hopping and use the cheating to farm you for caps.
---
And again on start up first time today, infinite loading screen. *grrrr*
---
There are multiple copies of at least 2 different "clues" and you have to pick up the one with the diamond before it credits you.
---
One on the body, another in the safe.  
---
At least one piece of paper to read, and IIRC, there's at least one holotape.
---
No credit for that until you listen to it.
---
That looks very homey! I love the idea.
---
This has happened to me when I have a lot of people hiding in the shed scaling her way too high. I use TSE and there were a couple of people with at least explosive weapons and we were hardly doing anything.
---
On Xbox, I can't remember the last SBQ nuke I have seen on one of my servers.
---
No, because the plan for placing inventory items is to have display cases for them. That way they're something guests can see, but not steal/mess with.
---
Only take them with a lowbie, now with 1% glitching you literally cannot win.
---
The armour also gives off a telltale beep when it procs (the mutation doesn't, just for the record).
---
I was in the same team as him.If he attacked his friend , it counts as the whole team , meaning that sadly I couldn't decline :/
---
A gauntlet nopa killed a pa player in adventure world when a free range event ended. I moon walked right back away from there. Adventure world is for helping each other, i think. Keep that pvp trash in survival world
---
Does that even exist?
---
Doesn't help how many people you have when a lot of them are 1% glitching now or will be.
---
Oh. That's a really dick move.
---
I don't see how that is great, they just made sure I will play the game less. No way am I sticking around grinding the same monster over and over in this buggy game.
---
Doesn't exist
---
Sorry to say it does not exist.
---
Yeah really. I wasted so many stimpaks during Encryptid because of this, to the point where I was forced to remove the Medic Pump from my power armor.
---
From what I have seen and heard I believe so
---
I guess they are referring to when they nerfed XP from certain enemies.
---
There's a scam going around that if you join the trader's team, that person has a buddy (not on said team) initiate pvp with his friend, making you hostile as well. Messed up stuff.
---
Ahh 😥
---
No, i didn’t wish for skyrim shield 2.0 in wasteland. Dont suggesting thing like repair kits to this games.
---
I carry two nearly identical TSE combat shotguns around for this very reason.
---
That happened to me. I no longer go on people’s teams if I’m trading (unless I know them and trust them) because of that.
---
Proof?
---
Luckily I haven't had that happen to me. I dont really have any problems on junk except aluminum but that's an easy fix. I might think differently on joining peoples team for a junk trade.
---
I think workshop mechanics should be redone. 
---
If someone wants to challenge your ownership to a workshop, they have to travel there and "claim" it. The owner has something like 2 minutes to respond. If the owner does not respond, they lose forfeit the workshop. If the owner does rdecide to respond, they have to travel to the contested workshop and "claim" to initiate PvP (maybe the owner an extra 30 seconds to claim once he arrives to the workshop). 
---
While in PvP, the workshop boundaries are displayed, and who ever dies first or flees the boundary loses.
---
You say this, but I've seen it many times. Someone will get into power armor in front of me and the game strips them naked as it plays the entry animation.
---
I had a 3 star legendary Deathclaw phase through the ground as it died. Pretty sure the bastard flipped me off as it was going through...
---
Looks really good and such a creative use of space. I also totally get the wanting to move itch. I've had my camp in the same spot since the beta (coal deposit) and haven't found a good replacement location as yet
---
Just do it. If you're on Xbox we can grind together whenever.
---
GT: GrayMold9
---
Sorry about your experience. If you're on ps4, I'll give you some supplies. Ill brown baggie it so there's no worries.
---
That would be awsome. Sadly it's damn hard to do any kind of watch tower right now unless you make your whole camp a tower or something, mainly because of how stairs snap. Closest we managed was this : 
---
[https://imgur.com/dwjKJko](https://imgur.com/dwjKJko)
---
I didnt trust any stim assist like life saving or automatic stim when low health.
---
If you want. Mysterious Helper way much better.
---
I thought this would be a quitting post!
---
I got an 1\* anti armor grognak as a drop from a legendary blaoted one in the WS nuke zone.
---
I keep getting the Moo Moos killed lol
---
If you don't want that game ends faster then skip this double exp weekend and do something else :)
---
Either a male or female tourist can spawn.
---
I turned down the game music and listen to a 40's &amp; 50's mix on Spotify while I play because I got tired of listening to the same 6 songs over and over and over and over and over and over.
---
You  may wanna try uninstalling and reinstalling the game.
---
&gt; I don't think any backpacks will give buffs to stats other than carry weight.
---
Go drop his TSE
---
I think the issue with item for item is the fact that every Bethesda Fallout game has had duplication/infinite caps bugs involving the trade menu and item for item trading. They probably simplified the menu to prevent them from happening.
---
Thanks! Was checking down by The Thorn, found everything but the Megasloth.. 2 server hops here and challenge completed!
---
Not a game developer but I'd assume this to mean a collision box would be the invisible part of a rendered object that stops movement or projectiles from crossing it? If so, something like a train car where I saw a camp post at today would have them, yet a camp can be made around such an object?
---
Well, i only farm at whitespring when my caps pool from vendor is not yet depleted.
---
Never see an effective pricey weapon there.
---
Locations with map markers and other CAMPs have a radius around their center points that block new CAMP placement. The center point isn't always the center of the location, and the radius doesn't always cover the entirety of the larger locations. Nor is the radius a fixed size for markered locations. There's really not much rhyme or reason to it that I can find. Placing individual pieces is also pretty hit or miss. Some objects will let you clip a piece through them, many (rocks, trees, and plants, though certainly not all of them) disappear when you intersect a CAMP piece with them, and others don't move at all. To make it more exciting, the collision boxes don't always match with the visual edges of the objects, so it's an adventure every time.
---
Half tempted to! Lol. He should have told me the second he dropped it. I would've hopped on and help find it
---
You can buy mutation recipes for much, much cheaper off players on reddit, just so you know
---
 I think the issue with item for item is the fact that every Bethesda  Fallout game has had duplication/infinite caps bugs involving the trade  menu and item for item trading. They probably simplified the menu to  prevent those bugs from happening. I'd worry that if the "fixed" and implemented a new one, no amount of internal testing could find all potential bugs and we'd be back into the dupe economy.
---
...I mean at some point you've just got to play the game though, right? All these "suggestions" to make the game do this, make the game do that, what's the fun if everything is so easy?
---
Well with repair kits I am dropping the game, they lied about cosmetics only in atom shop.
---
Deleting the game and removing the launcher.
---
Exactly the problem I'm having.  We're almost ready for Patch 9 and dead enemies are still popping out of existence as soon as they hit the ground.  Legendary Wendigo dies and leaves no trace; 80 Lvl Scorchbeast falls from the sky and vanishes; I open up on a group of 5 or 6 Supermutants and three of them disappear as soon at they start taking damage.  Man, new crap in the Atom Shop doesn't make up for the continuing game glitches.
---
They do have ones with increased damage resistance I read.
---
Yeah that totally makes sense. By the time I got back, all the damage had been done. 
---
I’m not interested in pvp at all currently, which is another reason I was so surprised by what happened. 
---
Oh well. He’ll be sorry when Appalachia Brewing Projects refuses to serve him for the rest of his life!
---
I tried all of the dead/static alien locations. I tried the FW monster before and after it died. I tried the sheepsquatch. I even tried the interloper in the Lucky Hole mine.
---
I'm out of ideas.
---
Piggybacking off this: Does anybody know if Shadowed Combat plans were eaten by this bug too? I haven't seen or even heard of one since it started.
---
I'll say, as someone who tried but couldn't learn to love Fallout 4, i love 76. Wall of text incoming!
---
The building is more limited, but I feel like that level of simplicity has made building more approachable in 76. I absolutely despised settlements in 4. Everything. I hated building, farming, the management. But CAMP building in 76 is my favorite thing to do. I've made well over 100 CAMPs, not all my own, and I love it. There are a few extra vanity options I wish they had, but that's just... well. Vanity.
---
As for combat, I find it familiar and fun. It feels more like F3 combat than F4, and I don't know why.
---
The story doesn't hold your hand and lead you around. It can be difficult at times, if you don't pay attention, to get the full story, but because of this I haven't skimmed or skipped over any of the environmental story telling like I did in 4. 
---
I don't necessarily miss human NPCs. I have always and will always live ^(non feral)Ghouls and I do wish there were some in game. Late at night, when people aren't on, I do wish I had someone/something to interact with. I usually go see Wallace the Robot in Harper's ferry when that happens.
---
Overall, especially at launch, the game has had some issues. I have not experienced the worst of them or had as many as some of the users on reddit, but I'm not so blind as to say it's had 0 issues. I crashed during SBQ last night for the 5th time since game launch. The game needs some work, but I don't regret preordering it or paying full price^(kinda...bestbuy had a gc deal). I def got my money's worth out of it, and while I have spent a little bit on atoms, the majority of what I've gotten ive earned in game, so that's definitely paid for itself too.
---
TL:DR this game is like a solid 7.5/10. Could be an 8 if it had Ghouls.
---
Ballistic commandos seemed to have been beaten a bit with the nerf stick lately so the only real advatage they have is in anti armor. The plasma will hit harder but the laser shoots far quicker, uses less vats and is easier to keep in ammo so I'd go with that. I have both but the plasma is definitely more high maintenance.
---
Lets play some time!
---
Found laying on a car right in front of the white spring front doors
---
Once in a great while i'll have a flatwoods monster spawn at my camp in the cranberry bog
---
I dunno. As a level 233 i tried to do a quick levelup at West-tek for a challenge yesterday and out of about 10 hops only 3 times i had muties inside. One of those times they were level 10-16 so for me the value of this event is questionable. Half of xp i got was from mutants that are outside. I mean XP gain is great but enemies are kinda hard to find so total xp\\hour gain feels around the same. Prolly great for leveling up alts through quests tho.
---
Ha yeah, I was just quoting Clerks. Most interactions I’ve had have been super positive (including the end of this one with the two others helping me rebuild!)
---
Two characters, both different genders, can spawn at the spots they usually spawn in. I’m guessing that the spots most of the people find him in are usually just Ansel-only spots, since I’m sure they’re a few that only the certain gender can spawn.
---
Superficially, BOS would be lore breaking if you have not played 76 for the lore. However, finding the lore for the 76 explains pretty well how the BOS ended up in Appalachia. Essentially, they used satellite communication between military installations to recruit.
---
As for enclave, anywhere there is Federal Government there could be enclave.
---
Yeah doesn’t work. Found and killed 2..
---
&gt;Except for the **Armor Plated backpacks**
---
If you have bloody mess, it can make really small body parts that can be tough to find. 
---
Sometimes roaming around the area (kill time for about 5 min or so) When you return, there is meatpile.
---
That I do
---
You're explaining how things work when you didn't even farm your own items? You would think that someone who's farming legendaries knows more about where to get those legendaries than someone who simply traded for them.
---
I'm done replying to you... You refuse to understand that 1% is greater than 0% and yet I'm the one with the head in the sand.
---
Only semi-persistent bugs I encounter are bodies disappearing before they're lootable, but I know that's a server issue as much as a game issue.
---
I really hope laser weapons get a buff they feel so underpowered but I think they’re  some of the coolest looking weapons especially the plasma.
---
Hmz, never saw it. Or havent seen it much.
---
When going into pa myself my armor, especially headgear, is sticking out the helmet xD
---
I've broken the trader bond of a AFK player by initiating a trade request.
---
No problem. Just an fyi but all the survival challenge weapons have been dropping at max level.
---
Maybe the alien in van lowe?
---
I... believe this would be a *Flock* of Sheep...squatch :D
---
But yea that WOULD be interesting. Not all that impossible either. I remember in FO:NV they would group up and you'd find them sometimes in up to 3 Deathclaws, but I don't remember if that was the case in FO3 and FO4 or not, as it's those games that we have to base any speculation on since I don't know if Bethesda *internally* recognizes any differing mechanics of NV :\\ Granted, we **did** get ammo crafting, but I feel like if they really welcomed the game into the franchise that we'd have seen the Ranger armor in FO4 (but I'd hope they would leave out the talking stealth suit... lmao)
---
At any rate, fingers crossed for running into a herd of them in the future (I admit, "herd" sounds more menacing lol), as we DO come across a trio of Scorchbeast on rare occasions... Just yesterday I encountered three of them on the East side of the Golf Course (just S of the Bunker's back entrance), and in the past I've had them spawn near Treetops. 
---
Somewhat unrelatedly, I my lvl 80 Sheep *did* spawn in a group of 4 or 5 Albino Radstags who encircled it and started attacking, which they promptly got laid out by one fell swoop of the foot-stomp AOE; they all toppled in unison. :P
---
It's kill or be killed. I was upset about it too, but now I want to be better at it. You don't get anymore fallout than that. How many NPCs with little to no storyline did you kill, just to loot them? Right?
---
Also equip two pieces of 50% fall reduction armor to avoid unfortunate accidents.
---
I wear under armor in my PA. I have the treated marine wetsuit.
---
I think it’s pretty cool how fo76 works with armor:  
---
Beginning game belongs to non-PA, 
---
Mid to late game belongs to PA,
---
End game goes back to non-PA
---
Nah fuck that guy. I have level 3 of it and he rarely shows up and half the time when he does show up he behaves like OP describes I hear the stims sound I see my HP go up but still kneed.
---
BAAAAAAHahahahahah! Lol. "Let's get im' in the balls". Tearing shit up with a drill faster than some bloodied builds with a bloodied weapon. :) Next up: Dominating PVP with wood armor and bare fists...hahaha
---
Thanks a lot!
---
I'll post some later!
---
Yup. Still glitched for me as well. Its now been about 5 months.
---
I’ll check
---
Deal
---
I play a bloodied heavy weapons build and sprint through it as well. I don't do stealth. Not worth the time to move that slow. My silo runs never take longer than 15 mins. When I did melee I just found it to be a pain in the butt to hit some of the turrets, and they always got off hits on me before I could hit them back. With ranged everything is dead before it can get off a shot on me, and to me it just feels flat out faster to quickly shoot stuff.  I haven't tried a dedicated full melee build in Fallout 76 though. Maybe that's less of an issue with certain perks. I was able to easily one shot everything with my melee build, but depending how spread out targets where, it was far quicker to kill them at ranged. That said, I'm a pretty good twitch FPS player, so a non VATS ranged "run and gun" build definitely plays to my strengths. I'll also tap Q to quickly identify targets (it auto centers your camera on the target as well, so you can just rclick and fire - instantly dead enemy for very little AP cost). Not that I really need it with targeting HUD highlighting everything, but it's nice to be lazy in that way.
---
Well I can at times but the last few days not just one spot
---
I see, I just play 76 for the gameplay and don’t focus too much on the lore at all. Since it’s all terminals and holotapes after a while I started getting annoyed and just stopped paying attention to it and watch videos on 76 lore instead. Haven’t remembered it all though. 
---
LMAO I GOT DOWNVOTED ON MY LAST REPLY WHAT A JOKE.
---
Did it for the first time yesterday..all I been hearing how small it was..but to my surprise ..it was massive!!! I was on a team and we both liked it..got lost numerous times..I won't spoil it much but honestly had a skyrim feel to it
---
Hover over the robot and eventually an option for triangle should come up saying trade
---
They gave the camera quest before the camera.
---
Maybe they game the camera before the alien
---
Maybe the alien is in Area...erm...Vault 51 ;)
---
Seem to remember haveing that happened and the triangle button was used to trade when that happens
---
I always do that one. Just wish the wendigo was 50+, and the lvl 50-70 noobs would stop coming in and banging on every instrument.
---
Yea i do Spotify too. Just wish i didn't have to
---
And it's not even a reasonable time either.  BL3 won't appear on Steam for an entire *year*.  Only Epic and, inexplicably, the barely functional Microsoft Store.
---
Not to get too off-topic, but the reason why PC gamers are up-in-arms about this is that Epic maintains this aloof "We're doing it in the name of competition" rhetoric.  No, this isn't competition.  This would be like Wal-Mart going up to Nintendo and saying "We'll give you a lot of money if you stop selling the Switch at Target."  What Epic is doing is akin to a vanity project.
---
If there's a silver lining, I guess it's that Tales from the Borderlands was so good, I can't imagine Gearbox doing their own franchise better, so it spares me the inevitable disappointment.
---
At least he raise you up when knockdown.
---
We are all supposed to come out of the same vault together there's no way I stole sweet rolls from each and every one of you.
---
 The whole object of this game was to rebuild America not come out of the vault and ffa kill everybody over and over again that's just stupid.
---
Honestly I wish it was easier to get legendary varies of these weapons.
---
(Already got god roll melee weapons, so when I was one of the first to find the sheepsquatch... was little disappointed.)
---
Sound advice.  Thank you very much.  I succumbed to anger in this instance, sadly.
---
I'll buy the handmade off u lol
---
thanks i didn't know that
---
Hush!!! You are telling them my secret to leveling and junk hoarding!!
---
But seriously it’s a great way to level and get cosmetic plans for your camp. I get stimpacks too.
---
legendaries don't drop a legendary 100% of the time, its how they intended. it says so in the game help menu, legendaries have a CHANCE to drop a legendary. i sucks but thats how it is unfortunately
---
Are any of these weapons viable? Compared to All Rise, for example (I didn't find anything better yet)?
---
Can crook/staff/club be repaired to 200%?
---
I agree, I enjoy this event - relatively short with a corresponding reward at the end. As a note, the other post about this event said there were at least 3 types of this event, with them having a different level spawns, and the  highest level one in the more can spawn 2 legendary sheepsquatch. That should at least increase the odds of getting a 3\*.
---
thanks i going to go look for him now
---
That thing isn’t limited, is it?!
---
About 5 times yesterday I defeated legendaries and they disappeared I was furious
---
Hi. Are you still selling mutations?
---
Solution; if you enter a owned workshop without pacifist turned on you should turned hostile immediately. And no contesting for the workshop at the same time defend workshop (PvE) is running, that is just so cheap.
---
Others have reported that doesn’t work either
---
I grinded it out every day with 6 Vendors (yeah no WS bunker for me yet) and dropped 6k. I don't see how anyone could earn it more than I did. What, randomly finding it by luck of the draw is "earning it"?
---
Understand, just saying. I admire the work, creativity and generosity of other players camp. Some are almost works of art. Also really appreciate those who place water stations and benches where others can use
---
Lmao
---
Dude. That Drill is totally Legendary!!!!!
---
lol..yes i actually.fell thru the map.once...a few times iv been ported 1000.feet in the air lol
---
I have the orange pip-boy and wear the Union uniform (backpack makes carrying all that junk more realistic). Orange and navy always work! I like the color. Sorry, no pic.
---
"I did 50 runs at West Tek (...)" doesn't tell you anything?
---
There's no reason to be salty. We are all friends here.
---
There was a bug where main quests would disappear. Last week, a quest called Keys to the Past disappeared. You have to complete this quest to advance further in the main story, so that sucked.
---
It was fixed with the latest patch though, at least for me.
---
My game still freezes sometimes in loading screens. It does it a lot less than it used to, but that's still an annoying bug.
---
Hopping a lot ATM for some plans, i'll add a few of those to my routine. Thanks :)
---
Got it. Thank you!
---
Would explain why we have so many days to complete it :)
---
it does have a full circle feel to it but from the sound of it you need some pretty rare legendaries to beat PA
---
Ultracite with explosive rounds
---
I totally get that, but I'm sure you can make massive efficiencies by rethinking what you carry and looking into perks.
---
It might not be many people's idea of fun, but really part of the game is intelligent inventory management
---
Yeah, first thing I tried was to put the plush animals on the bunk bed.
---
I mean, I understand why this is (so the character doesn't clip through them when they actually use the bed), but the flexibility would be nice.
---
One thing you could do, if you have the space, is to squeeze a cabinet or small table like the one behind your bed between the wall and the bed.  Maybe flip it around to hide the drawers.  And put the plushies on top of that.
---
No, it's 45. Weapon and armor levels come in increments of 10, so for loot that is on the 5-track (15, 25, 35, 45) it doesn't spawn higher than at lvl 45. Only loot on the 0-track does spawn at lvl 50.
---
Start by the pool in Whitesprings and clear out the buildings full of ghouls with a friend. It's a lot of experience and they drop tons of chems.
---
Explosive rounds? Didn’t even know that was a thing lol.
---
It's not lore breaking, it's just that half the vault were apparently Raiders.
---
I choose to believe that the Survival server is an alternate universe, where instead of being a control vault, Vault 76 had its inhabitants carefully selected to contain people who were psychologically prone to psychopathic tendencies induced by stressful situations. Once leaving the vault it would show Vault-Tec what the worst case scenarios might be years down the road as other vaults opened.
---
Yeah I would had done the same after the 2 or 3 dead lol
---
I want a survival mode but I don't want the dings and Bells of this arcade style whatever they gave us.
---
 No leader boards no messages every time somebody gets killed.
---
There would need to be a strict and heavy bounty system for it to work.  That would ensure it's not kill on sight to every single player you meet. But there would be the occasion where a person who wants to take that risk versus reward which is what the game was originally designed around.
---
Right now I don't want to play survival because it's a free-for-all gear vs gear mode.
---
I also don't want to play adventure because it's kind of boring. There is absolutely no fear of anything on that mode.
---
Armors also have "Increase carry weight" option + awesome Legendary effects \*3, meanwhile PA has very poor(few) choices.  
---
It's not right to compare the +10 STR it gives because most PA users already have 15 STR for the perks.  
---
\+200 carry weight is only for Excavator and only if you use Calibrated Shock mods which has the lowest resistances, again not right for every other PA set.
---
This..mid level like a 35 u can get for 2k
---
Roger that, thanks for the clarification!
---
The outfit is roughly worth like 1-3k caps depending on the seller, it’s not too bad. The imposter day 1 was going for an absurd 12k lol
---
Save may ass a few times that's for sure!!!!! Bes5 glitch in game. I'm gone miss it once it's fixed
---
I enjoyed The Burrows as an environment.  The atmosphere is eerie and the passages are just enough of a maze to make getting lost easy.  The ghouls down there are also strong enough and in enough numbers that there is a compelling reason to team up rather than just run solo.
---
I feel it was grossly mislabeled as a 'Dungeon' though.  I couldn't find any starter quest to lead me to the sewer.  There seems to be just the one, extremely linear, quest inside.  Fundamentally that makes it no different really than any of the map points you encounter that trigger "Investigate X"
---
To me "Dungeon" implied something more and I don't think that 'more' was satisfied by the inclusion of the more-difficult robots at the end or the bits of lore scattered throughout.
---
Its normally 1 sheepsquatch btw, i did the event about 32 times yesterday and only had 2 4 times
---
lol..yeh a quick.getaway for sure
---
We should be allowed to name and shame
---
Holy wall of text batman
---
I agree that the design of the tunnels and wandering around that really lived in feel.  I kinda like the fact that I get lost and turned around sometimes.  The only thing I would like is more random spawns for other creatures to wander down into those sewers and make some legendary.  Imagine how cool and scary it would be in those tunnels if you really were being chased by things that could actuallly take you out.
---
Doing the Encryptid event.
---
I have several of these (and the fedoras, and the mascot heads, and the imposter heads), but still have yet to receive the Imposter Sheepsquatch outfit.
---
pre war most stuff was running on fusion core's thats why there are so many generators knocking about the world. the ones we use for PA shouldn't burn so fast that was another nurf after launch
---
Saw similar a weird plant, (not this), a few weeks ago, when I had a base at Arktos Pharma. It was a closed flower on a skeleton, I had a pic, but deleted yesterday to make room for yesterday's Sheepclaw, (was one of the first to find it).
---
Assume it's something for a later event.
---
When you cant like the post because it has 76 likes
---
Workshops arnt even that viable either. You can easily farm up whatever resource through other methods faster. The only real reason would be to farm plans but cant think of anything else benificial (except for ammo plant but that might as well be renamed thunderdome).
---
Also, play the game and stay off Reddit :-)
---
If we think that Fallout 76 is a C-class game then burrows isn't bad. It would have been nice in the year of 2008. No it doesn't bring anything new to game. Its just another shoot fishes to bowl place.
---
Yeah lol
---
Summon the Mothman at the lighthouse event and commune with him for another 5% for an hour.
---
&gt; those losers who were so in love with the overseer that they couldn’t wait to go out and find the nearest proxy they could 
---
You mean the people who commandeered pre-war nukes and constantly blow up a golf clubs with them?
---
The same people who are now keeping your ass from becoming a scorched?
---
Those people?
---
Also be like Area 51 think that’s a hint
---
Is is supposed to show up as an actual Event?  I noticed clusters of players standing around nothing in the Mire the other day.  Maybe I was just missing it.
---
The Sheepsquatch itself is awesome and a much-needed addition to the enemy roster (a miniboss-type enemy with a lot of HP, that isn't a Scorchbeast or Mirelurk Queen).
---
If your sitting at low hp Serendipity would complement that nice. Free 45% to ignore dmg.
---
Have you tried taking a picture of another Vault Dweller? Plot twist: We're the Aliens! :-o
---
Stay off my lawn.
---
I've never done this event before, wew.
---
I would really like some cabinets as well. I noticed there were also some nice little wall shelves in the house at the new Delano(?) farm that you herd the cows to and I think those would be really nice for when camp decorating comes.
---
Everything that is not a "Scorched" is qualifiably a 'natural enemy' to anything-Scorched, beit humans or a Scorchbeast \[SB or SBQueen\], but can in turn be converted into a Scorched variant if hit by the SB's Sonic Attack. I've seen Scorched Deathclaws, Mirelurks *(every type; kings, queens, even hatchlings)*, Yao-Guai, Rad Roach, Stingwing... generally I come across them in the Mire near where SB have been known to spawn. In a nuked zone though, I've seen all manner of things from Scorched Mongrol Dogs and even Mole Men that have been Scorched
---
Now, whether there is some additional mechanic at play when it comes to the Sonic Attack and getting converted, I don't know. Because yesterday, just before I ran into a trio of SB (random encounter) on the Eastern side of Whitespring Golf Course, I had came in from the South-West near that Fissure. There was a SB fighting a lvl 61 Albino Deathclaw, but I didn't know it at the time, only seeing the SB and so I took that out. 
---
Anyways my point: Before engaging I know the SB had launched some Sonic Attacks, and after I killed it I then came across the Deathclaw a few moments later with only 1/2 its health left; however, it was *not* turned into a Scorched. Yet, I've seen lesser creatures get converted into a Scorched-variant right before my eyes, so it's possible that SB's level (I think it was 65) and the attacked's level or DR play a role in determining how susceptible they are to being infected/turned into a Scorched.
---
^(\[lol Times "Scorch" has been mentioned in this reply:  10;) *^(19)* ^(if you count SB!\])
---
The Burrows are meh to me. 
---
Unless i missed part of it there wasn't much reason to go there other then hey look new place. It's maze like but once you get your bearings you can get through it pretty quickly and found myself set on a path that goes everywhere and kills everything. There is some decent loot like screws and springs but It's only really good for the concentration of ghouls
---
Outside of a nukezone.
---
I'd also add that, although I don't go through stimpacks, the only thing that matters to me is speed and not having to farm them. I always have excess and routinely transfer a few hundred to my mule per week or vendor them, so I'd say I'm fine in that regard. As an example - I'd much rather blow 1 diluted stimpack while I run through the mainframe core room, shooting the cores that need destroyed with my TSE .50 Cal and ignoring the mobs. I can do that portion of the silo in literally 30 seconds that way. I only care about efficiency and DPS.
---
Definitely seconding the sinks! Even if it's just more dirty water!
---
536? how?  
---
You only get +210 from the set (100 excav set, 100 cal.socks, +2str).
---
I've been putting my camp right behind the club. All it has is a gas generator and 2 sets of 2 concrete foundations with the words "Fuck Turret Camps" in neon letters. That way I never connect to a server that has them.
---
the technology does not get any better if anything it should get weaker as time goes on so the PA we had in fallout 4 would be 200 years old by the time that game started and would offer less protection from radiation not more and fusion cores were much stronger in fallout 4. a fusion core that's only 25 years old should not be weaker than a fusion core thats 200 years old
---
I had this happen to me and a friend on PC last night.
---
Literally unplaceable.
---
I agree, the environment is great. It's big,  very well done and full of stories.
---
People who claim they finished everything in 5 minutes just followed the markers without ready or taking care of the lore (which is great too).
---
But, all in all, bethesda needs to adjust what they call "dungeon", because, I  (and probably most of us) expect unique encounters and challenges in such place.
---
So you give it a bad rating due to your own incompetence ? Nice logic
---
Going to be power leveling alts from 1-60 all weekend. Hope to get all 7 of them there. Fingers crossed!
---
I found my first one traveling the road from Watoga north to the Mire, to the south of Abandoned Bog Town.  Others have said it can appear in between West-Tek and the Investigators Cabin - there's a small viewpoint and bathroom there where a number of other high-level battles spawn too like Deathclaw vs. Super Mutants, Sloth versus Wolves, etc.  I suspect anywhere that particular setup can happen, you may randomly find a Sheepsquatch.
---
What part are you having trouble with? I've done it both as a group and solo and it wasn't too bad - and you only need to save one cow and the quest will complete. 
---
I noticed that the waves are consistent - at least in my experience - it's always wolves / bugs / 1 yao guai / 1-2 sheep squatch- one in the front and one behind the house + more bugs.
---
I encountered two of them in the mire a bit north of Harpers ferry at a farm but I don’t remember a mr handy
---
This is why I picked up a TSE lever for backup to melee  But I was power hitting this thing and barely making a dent. With my super sledge. That's about 400+ damage. 😂
---
Ummm...that’s brilliant!
---
No such thing (yet?). You can check the Grafton vendor for all available mod plans, what's not listed is not in the game.
---
Erik Dellums used to go to Cons dressed as 3 Dog and look for people in Fallout cosplay.
---
Lol, actually I have, as part of the larger take pictures challenge.. that didn’t work, obvs.
---
This something you know as a fact? Wouldn't they be any different than placing plants down? All camp items aren't lootable.
---
If your looking for a kickass cave. The fissure right above Red Rocket Mega Stop, north of it is a cliff side with a cave with two entrances. Thought it was the coolest thing except for the Irradiated bats screaming near by.
---
If they are wearing life saving armor and have Mysterious Stranger, then you see the inability for them to completely die.
---
His voice forver imprinted in my mind.
---
Ideas:  toy aliens?  Or the empaled alien in Van Lowes  Taxidermy?
---
Lol so buy the repair kits. 
---
Sorry just a controversial button I wanted to push real quick. That is pretty annoying though I agree something needs to be fixed
---
Also works with pvp
---
If someone wants to contest your workshop, it costs caps. The caps cost goes up each time they contest. There HAS to be a way for another player to take the workshop if they want, otherwise you'd have to server hop all night to try to find one with open workshops. Removing pvp from them entirely will never happen.
---
You can craft a Fusion Generator for very little materials. It takes 2 seconds and you have all the power you could ever need. You get these plans for free if you do the "Powering Up" event 3 times. Or, you can buy it for a few hundred caps from a vendor.
---
The only thing that's unfair is that it puts you in pvp with that player no matter where you are on the map. That should be changed.
---
Do you have weapon artisan?
---
Same here. Played every single beta except the first day because of that whole install for a whole day uninstall and reinstall thing that happened.
---
sadly we all know Bethesda and their love for random-generated RNG
---
The taxidermy one doesn't work. 
---
I feel dumb now for not trying the alien toy...
---
It’s there you just gotta search for it. Happened to me and his body was like 50 feet away from where he died on my screen
---
Wait, only a Synth could see those..
---
Can you put the plushie on a mat and drag both up there like you would do when placing plants indoors?
---
I'm a bit late on the reply here but I've been running into the sheepsquatch in random encounters this week
---
Then find and eat it you shall! I server hopped at the Overgrown Sundew glade or whatever at the very bottom of the cranberry bog and found several 1-2 star level 80 sheepsquatch - I found one at the top of the mire at the random spawn location which was similar to the free range event with the cows - there were 3 cows and a living cowboy robot! There was no actual event but a Sheepsquatch did spawn and I killed him to defend the cows! 
---
We also had a sheepsquatch actually attack our Workshop! 
---
Good luck on your quest for Mutton Chops!
---
I still remember the first time I met a scorchbeast, it was like two days ago, I was following the highway to Whitesprings and unknowingly ran directly into a scorched beast while I was like level 18 or something, I managed to get away but I was seriously caught of guard.... heres hoping I don’t run into a sheepsquatch any time soon lol
---
Scaling is capped. That information was data mined.  Also, she doesn’t take explosive damage, so explosive weapons add no damage.
---
Yea its just luck on who you play with, odds are you play with other players who doesn't want to hassle and just play the game, then you rarely get someone who literally just wants to troll and this trash of a pvp system is extremely exploitable.
---
But vault dwellers would also have 200 years to have developed them to be more efficient
---
There's a bug in power armor. When you fast travel, the perks stop to work until you remove and add them again. Stuff like gunsmith or stabilized.
---
You mean the gunsmith perk? (Guns break 40% slower on perk lvl 4) I do. Without it, as it would seem, I can make 12 shots and loose 50% weapon condition? This is silly
---
It comes with one of the mods for it
---
Nice I have to try that
---
There not even two shots any more. Its 20% additional damage for TS and for E it's 25% additional. Still powerful but it doesn't feel "Legendary"
---
Sometimes I explore the same place for the 100th time and still find a new place; one time I was exploring the nuka bottling plant for the 20th time and found a ladder to the roof that I’d never found before; it was weird
---
Accidents happen
---
I don’t use power armor yet
---
Weapon artisan lvl 3 repairs your weapon to 200% condition, might help a little bit
---
Before a few patches explosive bullets would be a thing for many other energy weapons , they don’t drop anymore , but they benefit greatly from a high rate of fire and explosive related perks
---
I stopped bothering with workshops since last night. Nothing like getting one shotted while putting up defenses then accused of using mods in game and a few threats later the dude is saying my personal info out loud. Yay fallout and getting doxed because i simply popped a nuka quantum.
---
This happened to me in a camp I built by Helvetia. I accidentally built my shop was right on top of a random event location and different things would spawn right inside my shop. From supply drops to the bots stuck in a loop, and it was great. Lots of enemy spawns so I was constantly repairing parts, but the friendly spawns made it worth it.
---
It gives you an extra 36 shots lol
---
How do you have 400 damage on a super sledge?
---
It’s an older guy with the Cappy shirt on, I found him leaning dead on a car in the parking lot of the water park, to start the quest you need to grab the bucket list and read it
---
So much this.. +1
---
Hm, I should try and get it. Is it an intelligence perk? Thanks for the advice, but I still think weapons break too fast
---
I never see Serendipity proc when in PA. Not sure if it works, but I'd agree if it does, definitely worth it.
---
I removed every mod (it's all standard) and 2 of the 3 wooden stocks are still camouflaged...
---
have they changed the texture for all pumps or is this a bug?
---
Never experienced this and my Main spends have their time in PA
---
Oh the sheepsquatch murdered them. I was just kinda joking tho
---
Yes it’s a lvl40 requirement intelligence card. It does help a lot. I’m a melee build and it’s not bad also when you equip white knight as well
---
Happened to me a few times. Especially noticeable with stabilized.
---
"You are missing the point. With these kits you never need to collect or risk losing junk, ever.
---
It provides a way to circumvent the biggest chore in the game, collecting junk. 
---
It totally removes the primary penalty of death in pvp, dropping junk. 
---
It totally removes reward for engaging the risk of fighting an opponent in pvp for the victor.
---
This changes the game in ways you haven't even considered yet"
---
Yeah, the point still stands. You don't NEED to, but you can if you WANT to.
---
If you have enough money and don't want to spend time to collect junk you 100% can avoid it now.
---
You are not going to change my mind by continuing to try to argue that I am somehow twisting the reality of the situation here. So please just save your finger the pain of typing another giant wall of text
---
Didn’t realize that people wouldn’t understand I’m joking
---
Lol. You mean assn/sent with all the DR perks (makes you effectively immortal unless staggered) and VATS, the in game aim bot?
---
I have a set of 3 star life saving armour I might try this out see if it's legit
---
I got really excited when i repaired mine to 150% as well! Normal repair still not working sadly.
---
Nice someone said 1 spawned for him at the Thorn last time we had the challenge, but I know this spot is a sure thing. I got it with about 10 server hops.
---
may want to use a /s then lol
---
White knight lvl 3 - armor breaks 60% slowly and is cheaper to repair. Agility perk
---
Alternate solution could be allowing workshop owners a "defend" option that allows them to initiate PvP with unwanted trespassers. This would basically give workshop owners the same ability to initiate PvP as attackers have and put them on a more even footing.
---
I still haven't even done the final event, because it's never available. Sounds like I'm not missing much.
---
They increase your strength by up to 5, so they sort of already do for some of us.
---
There should be a broken prosnap camera on the tourists corpse, you can fix it at the tinkerers workbench
---
it used to be a good event  but not.anymore
---
Best DPS = Bloodied 50 cal. If you don’t want to play Bloodied, the Anti Armor would be my second. If you are looking for economic choices and low ammunition weight, go with a Gatling Gun in Bloodied or Anti Armor. Throw a speedy receiver on those to up the fire rate. If you want to burn through ammo like it’s going out of style, find a faster fire rate minigun and put an accelerated barrel on it.
---
Killed 3 yesterday and all worked as normal and killed them but seen the glitch you mentioned as it happened once in a great while, I hope they fix it and currently no way to fix it on the players end.
---
With the right build they can actually rip things up
---
https://youtu.be/H12cF0blVMc
---
Oh yeah i forgot about that uniform. Awesome dude, no worries thanks for sharing your opinion anyway :)
---
Smh Bethesda
---
Looks great! I tried building at that train car a few weeks ago but couldn’t make my vision a reality and gave up, moved across the street from Uncanny Caverns and built around a pre-existing Raider market looking structure. 
---
I have a very similar build style as yours, always shooting for realistic, lore friendly camps that utilize existing structures, smaller in size, decor packed in tight and cozy.
---
I don't run gunsmith and I never have any problem with durability.
---
Same, I don't know why they chose this route and continue to try to install things that are less MMORPGish and more arcade/battle royaleish.
---
A large amount of the features that people are asking for are MMORPG basics. I would think that whomever is watching over at the studio would pick up on that but I get a feeling they are not really PC or mmo style gamers from all the interactions I have seen
---
Oh I was talking about the stock camo . Idk then
---
Gotta be honest, that's how it always looks for me.
---
If you can pay for an advantage its p2w
---
It happens with the pump action shotgun
---
*waves in blackbird power armor paint*
---
You must survive somehow. I found my way.... :D
---
Idk about the pump but I use a combat shotgun and go through quite a bit of ammo before I need to repair
---
I painted my pump shotty with tactical and it switched to camo after a relog. I think it was a glitch with the recent camo pack in the Atom Shop.
---
AND, more importantly it doesn't take you out of pvp mode when the "takeover" is finished.
---
The attacker can hunt you down anywhere and walk up and one shot you, even hours after "contesting" your workshop.
---
You have to die to lose hostile status towards them, but at the same time, they are not hostile to you, meaning you can't hurt them at all (scratch damage is negligible), but they can deal full damage to you on the first shot whenever they want.
---
Which emote do you use? Can it be any?
---
Sure you can pay real money for it if you choose but the winning aspect is very very slight, all you’re doing is repairing a weapon. Considering it’s only 50 atoms too, this really isn’t a big deal
---
Also one of models, t-51b i think, had something to change your pee in purtified water by lore. It is not ingame tho.
---
Its against ToS to purchase virtual goods in this manner, I believe.
---
quit complaining nearly everyone's described the hiccups you have, including me on console
---
I think the location is great, but the way Bethesda talked about it led to the disappointment. It sounded like something different while in reality it is just a new underground location 
---
I also do wish there was a bit more story to the people who lived there. Hopefully in the future we learn more about what went on for them
---
It's also illegal if it's against any TOS
---
It doesn't matter if you win, or not. If you can pay for an advantage that is p2w, ez
---
Or your peepers. Remember those tag an enemy. Also, power armor is worthless in PvP
---
1st try. I owe you 20 atoms, kind sir😊
---
I had a legendary Super Mutant drop nothing, done .38 rounds and a pipe rifle. I started walking away then decided to go back and check him one more time, because WTF? This time he had a 3* auto-stim combat leg. Glad I hung around and double checked.
---
Were you solo?
---
And I will tell you exactly what people expected. A subterranean challenge for 2+ level 50+ characters.
---
It isn't a challenge unless you are under level and under geared.
---
The event is ur best bet. I have seen a couple in random locations but I checked again and they weren't there
---
I will be dumping some Ultracite PA component plans tonight if any are on your list
---
They wouldn't even go into downed though unless that is what you are talking about, they were bloodied so their 25%-ish HP would instantly drop to 1% from my dps, but then they would never actually get downed. They were literally invulnerable.
---
Not small, short. It is a nice environment but it is largely devoid of content outside of junk.
---
Same thing here, but like 90% enemy. Those moments where you're just building and a supply drop lands next to you definitely make it worth it though.
---
I agree. Time to get over it
---
RIP Bethesda. You deserve it.
---
I disagree and believe it’s not a big deal to be honest
---
Incorrect, TOS are not laws. You can be banned for breaking them, but not arrested or prosecuted, unless there's some law you're also breaking.
---
Quit complaining? If that were me I'd be pissed. I don't see how anyone could find that acceptable in a game.
---
I dont think its illegal from a legal standpoint. But you can get termintated. The punishments are pretty clearly layed out.
---
I disagree and believe its quite a big deal to be honest
---
I’d take one that was half the height of existing towers. It’d get tedious running up all those stairs over and over. I mostly want trailers.
---
I swear I remember some law against it a while ago
---
My favorite that I've taken so far! https://i.imgur.com/fhbOyb1_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=medium
---
*then don't play it, they won't fix it till a lot later*
---
:)
---
For me, I like to keep it basic.
---
Marsupial for the jump height, Healing Factor for the increased healing process, and Speed Demon for the increased run speed and reload speed.
---
I don't consider scrolling through inventory to be playing the game. It's neither fun nor challenging. May as well add paperwork to the game then.
---
I definitely have a habbit of killing more than I should in the collision course event.... I know it's a low level event, but if there's not much else going on it's a fun one to run around punching things in.
---
It would be kind of over powered if you were completely hidden all the time
---
Twisted muscles, electrically charged, plague walker, unstable isotope, healing factor, marsupial, speed demon. I also have adrenal reaction, but it's still bugged and not working right
---
We paid $60.00 to be beta testers without any knowledge of it.
---
Looking forward to a nice West-Tek run haha
---
Exactly this.
---
It's a scumbag move, and one reason I have ceased supporting this shit tier developer.
---
Now that's a dumb answer. You pay a fair amount of money for something and it's broken you have a right to be upset and complain.
---
Denied not enough cram and coffee
---
think.its any..i just wave goodbye lol
---
Grossly mislabelled indeed. Should have said "new explorable area"
---
That'd be tantamount to letting companies write their own laws. It's definitely not illegal to violate TOS, unless that violation is also breaking an existing law.
---
Thx..this second time everyone was scattered all over the place ...so I had no clue where to look
---
Imagine this scenario:  
---
Two players A and B,each with a lever rifle with durability for 25 shots, meet each other and open fire.
---
Both fire wildly,both rifles break.
---
Player A repairs his rifle with an instant repair kit on the go, player B has to look for a workbench somewhere and is without weapon.
---
Player A continues fire while B has to attempt to flee while chased by A.
---
That's the basic scenario most people have in mind when you doubt there's any advantage.
---
I like the Burrows too.  It's a great place to swing through for exactly the reasons you pointed out. A hell of a lot of people were expecting a traditional "dungeon crawl" with a complete and engaging storyline, full of legendary 3\* enemies and an endgame type boss and were disappointed and rightly so, with what it really was. Bethesda brought all the backlash on themselves because of the way they built it for marketing. I personally was glad for all the critical posts because I was able to adjust my expectations and just play through it casually.  Taken for what it really is, it's a fun little underground area to explore and get resources from.  Harpers was always a pretty good nuke place for resources anyway, the Burrows just added to that.
---
It was encrypted and you did not have the skill to hack into it.
---
Sort of off topic but is there anything you can do with all the teddy bears you can find? There are so many of them and they look awesome. I would love to make a collection.
---
I think you like to forget Bethesda's games (and nv) aren't exactly stable 
---
fallout 3 took 2 minutes to load and netbook even longer 
---
*and don't get me started on skyrim* 
---
Sorry for getting pissy, but Bethesda doesn't have the best reputation on stability.
---
Thanks bro happy hunting
---
I run that armor and perk against the sheepsquatch imposter and am Bloodied. I don’t go down either. I get whacked, my health drops, but I keep plugging
---
I have a feeling Bethesda is low on cash reserves and growing desperate. 
---
How the mighty are fallen...RIP Player One.
---
There have been random reports in the past about things not resetting properly if you're using the perks that allows for extra searching such as Can Do! and Phrama Farma. If you're using Cap Collector that may be causing the same bug.
---
Then...why continue to support them
---
Is the ad breaking the law by using copyrighted material?
---
I can't play the game anymore without marsupial
---
Non nuked whitesprings is crap, I agree. Nuked Whitesprings is a different story. If you can consistently clear it every 10 minutes, you can get a lot of 2-3 star legendary ghouls there. It has the added benefit of  being able to farm mass / fluids and every type of flux besides violet, which you get tons of from SBQ nuke, assuming you place it correctly. 
---
Nowadays, I don't really go looking for legendaries specifically. We get the legendary vendor pretty soon, and I have nearly 1000 2 and 3 star legendaries saved up on mules to turn in to him. Assuming I can reroll a single legendary property, I should have all the gear I will ever want. 
---
The chances of getting a GG legendary in general are just so insanely low. Finding a single BE, B25, or BSS weapon is insanely hard, and bloodied is one of the more common 1 star legendaries. Hell, Assassin's / Unyielding armor is pretty common but getting a 3 star and having it be cavalier or sentinel is rare as hell. In general, legendary farming sucks ass. Your chances are so incredibly slim, no matter what you do. 90% of the GG legendaries in the market (TSEs, BEs, QEs, etc.) are left over dupes.
---
Adrenal Reaction has no negatives tho?
---
I'm 98% sure "Plan: Kitchen Cabinets" are a thing, as I'm quite certain I learned that a week or so ago. Yet, as I don't spent much time at my camp (on the opposite side of the map from where I play), I haven't really bothered to even look at what it is that I learned! &lt;\_&gt; 
---
I think I might've bought it from the vendor in Whitespring who sells all the decoration plans, the last store on the left (if you're coming in from the front door), just after the Crafting Stations store ("Survivalist" shop with the Free States Protectron vendor). The vendor is a butler protectron, which he's the only vendor in that shop, but you know you're in the right place because that's the one that sells all the fancy "Whitesprings" themed decoration plans.
---
If you're on PC and if the Friends List is feeling like it wants to function, we could team up and I could place down whatever it is I have, then you'd at least be able to have it until you're able to find/buy the plan.   
---
Just let me know in a reply here, a day and time (***with*** your timezone) to meet up and we'll go from there *(my IGN is my name here, but* ***no*** *underscore)*.
---
I know Bethesda recently changed how "Stored" build objects work, was something in a change log that I thought implied if you store something you aren't capable of building yourself, you can't place it... but we could definitely try that out first.   
---
Team up, I place it, you 'Store' it, exit Build mode, I leave team, you enter build and try to place it.   
---
If you can then awesome and give me a \*thumbs up\* emote! *(I leave voice chat off for bandwidth)*  
---
If not then give me a \*thumbs down\* emote, I'll re-join team and place one or two more for you, and good to go! *(put the "spare" in a shed or something?)*
---
I **do** know that having objects placed down that you can't build... will remain there. I had a friend place down a Tinker, Chem and PA Station for my alt just after I made her, and those things are all still there! (Granted, I eventually learned the plans for them, but it was weeks later...)
---
Yeah it’s a pain but it could be worse lol
---
Yup.
---
...craft 40 rounds of explosive ammo.
---
I.e. missiles, 40mm, mininukes
---
Marsupial and speed demon are essential for me. I have a few others I like but those two would be the first I'd go to replace if I lost them.
---
Probably, yes. It'd be up to a judge to decide for sure.
---
Another tip... do all of the above and take over a workshop with vertibot pad (preferably in survival). Spawn and kill vertibots over and over and over at the cost of 6 aluminum and 8 steel. I would not use the Ammo factory as it gets a lot of pvp action if you do this in survival. I went from 1-50 with no armor and a level 1 pipe rifle with 1,000 rds of .38 in 2 hours. It could have been an hour had we not screwed around so much finding unique ways to blow the vertibot up. I also only slept and someone shared inspirational. With all the rest of the buffs above it would have been faster.
---
p.s. It's a lot of aluminum...
---
In that scenario I would simply switch to another weapon but I get what you’re saying and I do agree in those situations it could hold the other player back. I just don’t think it should be a reason to slander Bethesda like EA when they had loot boxes for Battlefront 2
---
Well we may be able to add those effects when the legendary vendor comes out
---
That would just be poor planning on both players part. People carry backup weapons. What if player A tried to use a repair kit and player B just quick swaps to their All Rise and bashes A to death. Is B cheating? No. The repair kit outrage doesn’t make sense in actual in game scenarios. Those that actually play the game would know that
---
Marsupial is the best, because it fundamentally changes how you play the game and makes traveling a joy.  The other ones I'd recommend for melee are Adrenal Reaction, Twisted Muscles, and Talons (if you do Unarmed).  Those are the four I run with.  Of these, Adrenal Reaction is applicable to pretty much anyone, not just Bloodied builds.
---
I haven’t tried it recently but I might tonight. 
---
I actually had a problem where the game and the Bethesda launcher would delete themselves and needed up having to download and reinstall the game multiple times. 
---
Sometimes when it rains it pours, ya know?
---
FrenchingFry :D
---
Full 14 points into strength. Repaired to 200%. I run radicool about 25% rads to keep decent health. My underarmor is +2 strength as well. And I have a couple armor pieces that are +1 strength and unyeilding. My instigating sledge will get up to 600 when super low on health. So.....over 1k damage if I get a first hit on an enemy. 
---
Full health it's about 350ish with no rads. I really wanna try a bloodied melee to see how crazy it gets.
---
Well that's an exploit for sure then, didn't know that. Gonna test that tonight with a friend and make a bug report to BGS if that's the case.
---
I'm gonna be honest though - I took a lot of workshops before they got nerfed, and no one ever messed with me. Maybe that was due to me being high level, but honestly no one seemed to want them. A few times I had people pvp me, and it was a fun diversion, but that usually only happened at the munitions factory.
---
It's actually silver paint, which is generally on the whiter end of the shiney greys. The minigun has a chrome skin that is darker.
---
Pretty sure some of their tos violations outlined would be illegal to commit. I think its a violation to participate in hate speech and the like.
---
Does it currently work? I’m super interested in it
---
Oh, I know. I got it randomly when I first started and I saved up for it so if I ever lost it again I could make it. plus I made it for every one of my friends!  
---
The first time I accidentally suppressed it I was noooooooooooooooo. lol
---
Has this been documented?
---
Dont use the cars in white sorings unless its a last resort to criple charred ghouls because the corpses can and will go flying
---
This is why u have hot keys and can switch to another  weapon on the go right away if one breaks big deal ,this is not pay to win even sayin it is ,is a huge joke it's just ease of convenience to not have to fast travel to a work bench
---
I heard that they may be making WS a no camp zone for that reason!
---
I'm having trouble controlling.........THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!!!!!
---
Disagree all you like.
---
You're still factually wrong.
---
Hm, interesting. Then it must be a glitch that I experiwnced then.
---
 The only reason I brought up explosive is because I am assuming that they would also be AA, TS, Bloodied, or furious. I was solo so I didn't know the exact weapons others had.
---
Really, 50 atoms? Thats cheap. I can run around for 1 hour and get atleast 100 atoms from challenges if i hunt them down
---
There's multiple mods for PC *and* consoles for building a settlement anywhere. Just sayin'.
---
I try to keep one low level gun on me when wandering just in case I team up with someone. But with a low strength build, it costs me precious weight.
---
Most Bethesda games don't reach this level of instability though. At least not this late in its lifetime. Besides, I'd rather them complain constantly than not at all, otherwise nothing would ever have gotten fixed in the first place.
---
Yes but Bethesda would have to sue them and it costs $$ they probably want to keep.
---
Jesus christ. I wish the game had a respect system instead of having to get to level 100 Just to reperk my character...
---
Yeah, it can be tedious if your not into it. For me, I read every little note and holotape except terminals because I hate swapping perk cards.
---
Now can we boycott?
---
/s
---
What??? This is great news! Got 2 from SBQ the other day. They are reserved for my Grognak's. Thanks for sharing this.
---
Tinkers Workbench&gt;&gt;
---
That's completely reasonable question though.  Does it still happen if you start a new character?  If it does, then it's likely not the high-level character itself that has the problem.
---
Does Speed Demon really drain food and water 50% when moving? I assume the Class Freak Perk brings this down. I am already having enough issue with my meters draining like crazy!
---
Yeah, I can understand that 
---
Sorry for being a prick
---
I work in IT....it is a cursed field for that exact reason.  Do you run any mods?
---
I came to fallout 4 late but apparently 4 was the same way, at first you had very limited options for building, hopefully they add more items.
---
I hope so as well, that's alot of wasted ammo.
---
Adrenal has a 50 hp cut and only works at low health.
---
It also helps if you wait until it turns to meat/scrap pile and then it will come visible/lootable.
---
Yes, that's my point...duping guns isn't illegal, even though it violates the TOS. Hate speech is illegal (in most places in the US), and also violates the TOS.
---

I would like to be able to place the Mr Fuzzy Toys, you find around Applachia in my CAMP.
---
Atleast you got a legendary i did my free one and got the imposter suit. Just the suit.
---
Right?  I realize that it's mostly semantics but my expectations as a player would have been far less had it just been labeled something less involved.
---
As annoying as that is... 4 people wasting their time for a tiny bit of pvp action when their is a full on pvp mode available to them is just hilarious. I'd just block, server hop, and laugh.
---
It took me crafting over 70 40mm grenades for it to register.
---
looking at the pic I thought for a short time you already took a bite from that core before noticing it's just the rotation
---
The fanboys attacking right away when someone is describing problems they have ingame. There is just too much of em defending bugtesda
---
Legendary yogi is south of alpha, if you follow the creek up to the point it joins with the creek that goes under the suspension bridge, son of fluffy spawns like every ten minutes, always legendary. Had to put a bunch of turrets on the corner of my house to deal with him, he shows up every time I fast travel.
---
Where do you go to get there? I play Fallout 76 everyday but I haven’t bothered to go searching for it haha
---
I come across your camp a lot! I love walking the tracks (I'm weird). It's a great camp.
---
There was some debate if explosive actually negated AA. Never saw actual conclusive proof. I have a friend who swears by a plasma flamer for the queen. Never had one, but he said it melts her. Would be curious if anyone else has tried one.
---
Just tried this myself with a three star super mutant in Harpers, removed my armour and died several times to him but he still only dropped one legendary.
---
The only thing workshops are good for is fusion cores anyway. Otherwise.. there are far better ways to get every available material.
---
All true and helpful, but don't lose precious playtime by hunting down some of those **now**. I always save up Leader bobbleheads for occasions like this, but the most important part is to get to clubbing supermutants' heads and charred ghouls as soon as possible, and for as long as your time permits.
---
Collecting EXP right now at 205% (from double EXP plus well rested) beats hunting down magazines, food, and bobbleheads for two hours and ONLY THEN starting to reap at 225%, hands down.
---
That looks great! Hope I run into you sometime in the world haha
---
It's an inventory management game, and you want your inventory managed for you...
---
How do you commute/commune? with Mothman?
---
Not for ps4! A struggle somebody from the master race would never understand. Or maybe there is, but I never saw it.
---
Not a problem! I was actually a bit apprehensive because I was almost sure that it wouldn't work because of the issue that's been in game forever but when it did I was way too excited haha
---
What is 1% glitching?
---
Just treat it as any fallout game initially. Do the main quest, explore interesting locations, do side quests as they come up. You don’t really need to focus on farming anything just yet. Maybe take over a few workshops to get rewarded some building plans and check out camp building. There’s so much to do initially that you’ll stay busy just messing around for many hours.
---
You sir know this game. I have played this game 950h and not once had a weapon break or armor. If ppl are too lazy to get mats for repairs then they should quit imo
---
just gonna downvote your post since you seem to attack people who enjoy the game

Harpers ferry is usually a good spot, general steak house always has a few.

Very nice pic. What were you doing?
---
Very nice pic. The lighting is awesome.
---
U think i care ?  I cant stand ppl defending bugs and stuff that should be fixed
---
Love it!
---
It's crazy I can get up to 30+ strength I think? I dont love the unyeilding as much as my full bolstering set. But it's helpful for Nuke zones.
---
Random player with a Tse: see’s a 3 star enemy
---
Also random player with a tse: “Omae wa mou shinderiu” unloads full clip into the 3* and blows it all the way across the map so not even he can loot it.
---
That's curious how the repairs kits must pass through a different filter than Weapon Artisan does.

Where scorchbeasts fly, on a mountain high.
---
i put my stash box at the foot of the bed, and put the plushies there, not a perfect solution, but better than nothing.
---
You can make adhesive with corn, tato, mutfruit and purified water. Make starch with that under utility at a cooking station. Then scrap the starch for two adhesives for each starch. Set up a little farm at your camp and a couple of small water purifiers. Then come back to camp periodically to harvest and make adhesive. You will have plenty if you do that.
---
Follow the basic storyline quests at first.
---
Be sure to check the overseer's stash boxes and other containers like Cash registers and suitcases (especially at train stations), as higher level players tend to drop stuff in there.
---
I think the double XP is enough for me
---
I don't think you care a lot about the game considering you spam emotes in half of your post history and bash Bethesda 24/7
---
If you're a melee build, twisted muscles and talons (if unarmed) would be the next picks after Marsupial.  I also run adrenal reaction, healing factor, and speed demon for my melee build.
---
I got 2 on one occasion and 3 another time.   Forget the atom shop,  THIS is the way to go!
---
Yeah I think the problem with thorn is trying to find the random event spot lol.
---
Are they named? There’s been a bug w named items disappearing
---
can you expand on it? PC or console? when did you notice they were gone? what were you doing prior to it?
---
also, if you're on PC, what's your fps?
---
if you take off the PA pieces you can even see your vault jumpsuit under the frame..
---
This same thing happened to me last night with a 3 star...
---
Based on feedback in the comments, it sounds like the original spawn location will be my go-to if it does occur again. I wonder if the community managers are aware?
---
Anyone nuke a Sasquatch yet?
---
I believe it was... could be wrong though, hopefully someone can confirm one way or the other
---
I have the opposite, last time I logged in, I had two extra copies of my T-60 PA.
---
I did care until i understod they will never fix it when fanboys defend it no matter what , now have a nice weekend sir
---
I pushed about but I was apprehensive at 1st because I just assumed it would do it to 100% but lo and behold there it is. Maybe it's with the perk itself the code behind it?
---
I'm really glad you have recorded this. Thanks
---
Anyone nuke the sheepsquatch yet?
---
I made one in the random monorail sections still on the track.  An epic stairway to get up to them but nothing could touch me.
---
You started it!
---
*that makes zero sense, you're complaining about something that won't be fixed yet you keep playing it*
---
actualy no matter your str itll boost your str to 9 (or was it 11?)
---
so for an everyday guy with 1 str it DOES give you alot of str
---
After he lands at the completion of the event, just walk up to him and use your action button. The hover text literally says COMMUNE
---
This only works with the Wise Mothman at the lighthouse event. The other Mothmen are more into killing you and less into blessing you with their wisdom.
---
At least he drops useful things when he dies. Jehovah's just make a lot of blood.
---
How long is the cool down for the mission?  Anyone know?
---
What are you keeping the horns for?
---
I done the same thing to the train cart at whitesprings since BETA! It’s a good use and saves a bit of space for camp storage.
---
Yeah. I put my Tesla rifle in my stash to save weight, and then regretted it once I joined an event and didn't have any reliable tagging weapon. Oops.
---
Yeah, like the cranberry relish is easy to make and lasts a while. If you can quickly buy a leadership bobblehead or the magazine, that might be worth it. Equipping Inspirational is a no brainer too. But if you do everything above, you end up wasting a lot of time where you could be earning exp.
---
isnt the legendary vendor going to introduce legendary PA?
---
Two reasons to craft the club and to keep track of how many of these freaks I kill
---
I’m about 720 hrs in. I’ve had weapons break and armor, but I’ve learned to adapt. I now run white knight all the time. Since I’m melee I have the perk card that decreases breakdown of melee weapons by a lot (I forget the name). With those, I don’t worry about armor and have at least two melee weapons in case something bad happens, which like you said, usually doesn’t. The repair kit outrage is so dumb. And that’s proven even without bringing up they ONLY repair to 100%, real players know you should be repairing to 200% anyway.
---
I just assume it will spawn in the area but hey doesn't really matter as long as we have a spot no point wasting time on it, they both random .. just happy to be able to complete the challenge. I spent hours trying to find the damn thing the first time round, now it takes me around 20 mins for 2 characters.
---
Do you have the item that makes them move?
---
Yeah, I usually carry two sets: Excavator and Ultracite. Now I dont have to constantly place the wrong one down! Haha
---
I don't think there are any cabinets that attach to the wall itself is what i mean - i am pretty sure I have the existing Cabinets plan - I have most of the plans with the exception of like weapons plans. 
---
But sadly I am on Xbox but thank you so much for the offer!
---
It doesn't count the actually crafted number (i.e., affected by the ammo crafting perk card and super duper), just the base amount you'd craft without any perks.
---
As far as I know, official info about this has not been released yet. I am guessing the Nuclear Winter content will include this.
---
We don't know that yet.
---
The crook? Yes but they travel up to a certain point, move off of the road and then just sit grazing

OK. Message me your PS name and we can hook up.

Nuclear Winter?

I'll be curious to see how these will work with armor that already has a backpack, notably Trapper armor.
---
Could not be more accurate in your statements 👍

NICE!!!! I wondered what, if any effect stats had on this. Good lookin out! Thank You!

Nice place
---
RABBLE RABBLE!
---
There is a random event spawn on the path that they take. Sometimes the random event spawn, like a large tent, will mess them up and bug them out. This is what I have noticed.
---
My guess is the event is too tedious for most of us, I check how many players show up and if only a few,  I don't go .. it's too bad, it's a fun event .. but the failure rate is high and the burn rate on resources like stimpacks can be high for a failed event probably doesn't sit well with most people unfortunately.
---
Have Super Duper maxed out. Did not even think about the LvL being independent of the mods. Pro Tip! Thank You!
---
Intelligence also boosts item durability when crafting ... a handy tool, being smart.
---
Im online now bro, psn: RIVA5150
---
Thanks for posting this!
---
I was really hoping for just black, but might invest in this one.
---
Exactly this. I can physically sneak without the perks for sneak attached, so are these perks even worth investing in?
---
Check out the [roadmap](https://beth.games/2VfuajF).
---
My rule is - if it's a 2 or 3 star, I make sure everyone gets a hit. Otherwise, you better be fast on the trigger if you want loot / exp. Time is money. It's not about showing off, it's about playing efficiently. Honestly, this is a Bethesda problem. Being in the area when something dies should give you exp / loot. A level 1 doing 1 damage with a pipe rifle to a lvl 95 deathclaw is not contributing anything meaningful, yet he / she gets full loot and exp. The way the tagging system works now just sucks for everyone.
---
Do you read the road maps or inside the vault or anything?
---
YES add all the NV songs please
---
Ah yes it's probably interesting for such build.  
---
But, I do have a strengh build and I loose strengh in PA, and this doesnt feels right actually...
---
Where is it on the map?
---
2SE Tesla is a legacy Weapon, no longer on the drop list. good luck finding one.
---
Not sure this will work, but create a 2nd character if you have room, start the quest, transfer camera via a friend. I am sure it is a bug, so we may have to do a work around until then.
---
It's tough to get all of the bio-luminescent fluid by yourself, though. If you travel with a team it's easy to slay all of the fireflies and radtoads for the 50 fluid you need to complete the event.
---
It just doesn't seem worth my time.
---
I'll tell you why it's blown out of proportion.  I'm swimming in the darn things just by virtue of killing the Scorchbeast Queen.  The premium ones, no less.
---
If you consider it pay-to-win, you are operating under the absolute most literal definition of it.  But hey, people do love casting everything in the most simplistic black-versus-white, us-versus-them terms these days.
---
I believe that one of our Bethesda posters have said that the backpack will be hidden but still useable, like will be the case with power armor.
---
I've lucked upon a few legendary Gauss rifles; still carry a nocturnal 3star as my primary sniped weapon. Unfortunately, it doesn't have a suppressor like my 3star instigating. It does have the stinging magazine though, and a better barrel and butt stock than my instigating. That's the main reason I'm trying to get these mods - I have good mods on shit legendaries, amd good legendaries but no mods O_o
---
Nah just vanilla. 
---
It’s probably something wrong with the install. Whatever happened previously with the game getting deleted probably has something to do with it. 
---
For some reason after it deleted itself, every time I would install it, it would install in multiple places and it was wrecking havoc on my anti-virus and firewall. I ended up deleting everything, reinstalling, then deleting the extra installs before starting up the game. 
---
Took me a few days to figure out what was going on and how to get it working.
---
Platform?  In Game Name?  Social Security Number?
---
I didn’t either, until I started using shotguns.  All other weapons I’ve been just dandy without gunsmith, with the 200% repair, and it was reasonable.  I’ve got an explosive shotgun (not tse) and it’s insane how fast it degrades WITH gunsmith 4 (redoing my spec this weekend to drop first aid 3 and get gunsmith 5).  Perhaps the 7? Pellets the shotgun shoots each count as a shot, so it’s 7x the durability loss.  That would seem about right for the breaking.  Will give the luck repair perk a try and see if it alleviates this.
---
I must confess. It was me that stole your corn.
---
So full life saving armor + mysterious stranger and you can't go below 1% HP? Weird. Definitley a glitch.
---
The snow mods in Fo4 were really sweet. I see a lot of great nexus stuff from Fo4 in Fo76, even if only subtly...
---
I really wanted it to kick my ass, have level-scaling enemies, and for me to die multiple times. 
---
But I just fought more one-shot ghouls.

This
---
For Energy Weapon ammo, you will need to craft 4 batchs of 2mm Gauss Ammo, rather than the 2 batches that the Ammo 2 Perk would suggest
---
I had enough fertilizer and adhesive already, then I just cleared out mole miners at Emmett Mountain and a random supermutant place to collect 20 weapons of both melee and ranged, went to my camp, reloaded into survival, scrapped and crafted away, done. ;-)
---
Yes, those losers letting a machine hiding in a pre-war bunker tell them what to do. Keep your comforts from the old world. I'll live free and take what I want.
---
Wipes tears with legendary wood shin armor
---
Since everyone's been doing tech data for the paints the price has tanked on the Bomber Jacket - still one of my fave outfits tho.
---
TIL...the above...lol... thanks!!
---
I would cry without speed demon and marsupial..I knew I needed the serum recipes immediately
---
No what is bullshit is that someone dressed in pajamas has a massive advantage over a walking tank in PVP
---
You just made my day.
---
Don’t worry, Ann is the tourist that I found too. It seems there are at least two of them out there.
---
https://youtu.be/hZY5DBmgC_A
---
What abt the cryo pod in the tnt bunker w the alien blaster fusion mag plan? Maybe it’s frozen or something. If that doesn’t work maybe try the pictures of the aliens at the place where the tin foil hat spawns if those don’t work idk
---
Thanks for the info, do you know which effect doesnt role on it anymore?
---
Chassis "Sets strength to level 11 if the stat is below 11."  ([Nukapedia](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Power_armor_(Fallout_76)#Chassis)) so for most of melee builds this has totally 0 effect :(
---
Curious;  is there a range on empath?  Does the 2nd acct need to be in view, or just logged in and grouped?  I guess you’d roll with herd mentality on this as well for the +2 across the board.
---
It would be a civil issue - not a criminal one.
---
It's kind of funny - I was wandering through the Mire the other day and noticing some interesting locations for CAMPs before coming across a Mr. Messenger event.  Doing that event, we passed right through a number of those locations.  It's probably not a good idea to build where Mr. Messenger might pass.  I can only imagine players annihilating your CAMP when it blocks that stupid robot. 😋
---
So deny all power armor because excavator?
---
I know one spawns over at Creekside in Cranberry Bog. My friend and I are 2 for 2 in them spawning there. Lol
---
blame it on the PA restricting your movement?
---
idk.
---
If you enjoy lores and exploring, I found it to be more enjoyable by yourself than with friends. It can be hard to pay attention reading terminals and listening to holotape during voice chat and what not cause theres so much to take in. Don't get me wrong I love hanging out with friends on online games but it gets distracting. Me and my wife sometimes like to head different direction to just explore and see what we can discover our own, just the environment itself tells stories
---
Yeah I like modding weapons..giving aid..teaching new people how to cook food..to the newbies
---
how are you doing that
---
I built my staff at 150% but I’m sure it can be repaired to 200%. I’ve got the burning barbed sheepsquatch staff and it’s slightly less powerful than my Lv 50 All Rise if I remember correctly. But it was such a small difference that I prefer the staff just for the ascetics of a flaming skull.
---
Good point! It’s leaning against a parked car in the parking lot out front. He’s wearing a bright green shirt. From my understanding, the dead guy spawns at some places and a dead woman spawns at others. Not sure what she looks like, but if you fast travel to wavy Willard’s, it’s a straight line to the car he’s against and it’s on the right.
---
Checking now. Got 6 mins left..
---
Xbox one. It's OK now though. I barely just got out of thier alive. I appreciate your offer to help though thanks
---
Did his on Survival last XP weekend and went from level 28 to level 68.
---
As people have already said, explore, do quests, build and read everything. The quest arc will naturally lead you around the map but teaming up with a higher level player and getting a free tour around the stations is always good. 
---
If you don’t want pvp at low level, make sure you’re in pacifist mode (in settings), also give mind to taking workshops initiates pvp and you can be attacked by other players even if you aren’t at the workshop you’ve taken. 
---
Most importantly, play your game your way and have fun.
---
Hmm.  Don't know how I feel about that.  Why did one of my best torso pieces have to be Trapper?! 😂
---
Haven’t seen this one mentioned anywhere else, must be a more rare drop
---
I don't understand this, as under armor isn't usable in power armor.
---
Is the imposter assualtron head any good as a weapon?
---
Playing in a group really is fun. Enjoy!
---
A/S/L/Bacon Pics
---
You have a very good point here. 6 months should be plenty of time to iron stuff like this out. Now I can understand one popping up from time to time, but constantly like this...it's such a shame
---
My son and I were doing the BOS event at Fort Defiance a few days ago to get him some levels. Same thing happened to him. He tagged 3 different scorchbeasts (one shot) and then I would take them down. No loot or XP for him.
---
Also fast traveling will cost caps and it can be expensive in the beginning. If you have friends on the same server, you can fast travel to them for free. Also if you are in a team, you can fast travel to team mates and their camp for free too (and your own camp is also a free fast travel)
---
You're very welcome.
---
Look at the status menu
---
How long until they start selling cards for events like Encrypted in the Atom shop?
---
Getting bored hunting for legendaries now that we've dialed down the spawn rate?...........just buy a card in the Atom shop and get a spin at the wheel!!!!
---
Use bursts instead. It will keep the walking under control.
---
What's your strength at?
---
I run two accounts simultaneously, so I'll tag with my alt and kill with my main. Got a main on each account that can solo anything in the game.
---
It's pretty much the Messenger event, but with more interesting loot.  I've done it a couple of times and I like it!
---
Thank you Bethesda! for a high level player, this has been great for me to respec some perks for my new TSE shotgun, though I do still wish it were easier to respec. I'll just have to play a lot this weekend.
---
Did that to me once too
---
I feel you bro. Been on the grind for em
---
I’ve also been playing since beta and I’ve only had two griefers. It’s slightly annoying and they are generally trying to goad you into attacking them so they can get a few caps and junk in the PvP. Plus they are jerks. 
---
You can generally just sign out before much damage is done but it is annoying in an eye roll sort of way. Clicking on your camp builder lets you select “repair all” and as long as you have the materials it is all fixed instantly. 
---
Is it strange that I worry I might value my camp less when it can’t be attacked by other players? Feeling protective and slightly nervous about it is something entirely new about my home in FO76 vs FO4.
---
Exactly in the next patch.
---

---
Safe zones... seriously? That belongs in adventure mode with the Care Bears. Spawn camping isn't a thing if you keep your gun away and haul a\*\* when you zone in. If anything the reverse is true... people are taking advantage of spawn immunity which is forcing the fight away from the stations.
---
Will :)
---
Yeah, that sounds like a nightmare. I hope ot gets to working for you though!
---
Whish i was able to grind this since i only can play it for a limited time every week, but guess what i got a really bad Cold al thats probely not happening :'),
---
Sorry for bad english not a native
---
mmh, I have mixed feeling on this.
---
Sure Bethesda has its part, but we can still mitigate the effects.   
---
However I am mostly talking about legendary NPCs. I cam across people who didnt care at all, lately.
---
I have played a lot of online rpg/mmo, and I ve seen a lot of different tag system, I am not sure if there is one 100% good:
---
\-First hit = Tag
---
\-First direct hit (no AoE) = tag
---
\-Most damage on target = Tag  
---
\-Everyone get the tag
---
\-...
---
My mutations are marsupial, speed demon, grounded, scaly skin, healing factor, adrenal reaction and carnivore.
---
Dont really need adrenal or carnivore but they do have their uses. Could live without them but not the others.
---
Why are you yelling?
---
I love it! Looks very cosy and unlike the larger camps it looks lived in(as much as a digital camp can).
---
Agreed. People are actually taking advantage of spawn immunity. If you die after zoning in... it's your fault.
---
Well, that wheel could be useful for food if we could place a catchall for food actually. That's not a bad idea.
---
Idk then the space station is supposed to open up in a later update it’s probably in there
---
You can also commute with Mothman if you find him at a bus stop
---
whether he'll actually ride the bus with you and not attack you is yet to be determined tho
---
It is definitely 
---
(I don't like PA anyway, but it's still required for nuke zones so...)
---
Just found the event on a new server, worked.
---
The challenges have just reset and it’s still there!!
---
Yeah thats why I don't build there.
---
Kinda wish we could trade the cancer bats for aliens flying around in UFO's or something. Maybe even change out the main baddies/storyline every six months or so. We've nuked the fissure how many times now? All thats left should be irradiated glass.
---
yeah, but I mean it doesn't work as intended as long as I'm in combat and stationary I should be invisible but my friends always say they can still see me. or in PvP I Still get shot down while trying to hide (supposed to be invisible)
---
Basically yeah, but things like a boxcar can have a camp around it and maybe inside it a bit
---
Class freak does bring it down a bit. In all honesty though it's not too bad with class freak maxed out. Only time I've gone into red with water is if I'm building a camp, and that is purely because I just get so caught up in it I forget to eat/drink.
---
But it's worth it for the speed boost you get.
---
Yeah double XP is amazing. I got 14 lvls in 3 ish hours questing. I am just trying to get my 2nd toon to 50.
---
I need an albino claw in my life! The chameleon would be neat if it could still change colors.
---
He totally changed my play style and his videos definitely taught me how to optimize my character build. Whenever I get a chance to create another character I'm definitely going to reference his videos.
---
Bethesda probably doesnt want to alienate people that are always in PA. (and they are many)
---
I am sure they made the choice so everybody gets benefit the extra storage.
---
Lol i wouldn't mind that
---
Platform? That’s not a bad deal because I’ve always just sold mine. Until now. 😂
---
A later dlc in the winter
---
I've had this happen a lot more since the last update too. Most recent was in Whitesprings Golf Course. Went on 2nd run through to make sure I hadn't missed anything and ended up finding the corpse at the spawn point for it.  I was puzzled as heck by it.
---
I would definitely shell out some atoms for a Bloodstained Deathclaw Gauntlet. One of my friends believes that the skull gauntlet in the new trailer may be a skin for the gauntlets as well.
---
That's what I guessed. So collect em and hold em.
---
Ps4. I was killing super mutants this time. Last time i was just chylling at whitesprings and they were gone. I noticed both times because my weight dropped
---
Yea it drains it faster. If you're trying to keep your well fed/hydrated bonuses, youll have a tough time doing so with speed demon. Class freak helps alot in that case but for only like 2-3 mutations, doesnt seem too viable to keep on IMO. What I'd suggest as a means to keep things going, is to get herbivore mutation and take corn soup and/or gourd soup with purified water. They both weigh .5 pounds and with herbivore you get 20% food and 15% water.
---
I just looked at the actual Gameflip site- it's laughable. Vast majority of the Fallout stuff is actual game downloads, and the only consumables i saw were stimpacks and some ammo- all at prices that would get a 10-year olds ass beat half to death for using his moms credit card on.
---
Nobody with any sense whatsoever is doing this shit.
---
Yeah i painted them
---
Thanks again. My red eyed death machine is finally nearing completion.
---
No, inventory management is a small portion of the game, and that is really more weight management anyways.
---
If you were traveling a lot, would you not have snack items readily available, or would you put them all at the bottom of your pack? And if you did have snack items available would you limit yourself to only one type of item?
---
Explosive on Energy Weapons (Gauss? Unknown)
---
With a name like that, I think some sort of betrayal was inevitable.
---
That is really neat but reminds me more of the cultist vibe\~ I really wish we could have things like that in our camps!
---
Thanks, appreciate it
---
You should be able to see the time in the effects section on your pip-boy!
---
You have to have your gun out for the chameleon mutation to work, thats all i know that might cause problems
---
When were we told this would be part of the winter dlc?
---
THANK YOU. Also, if you are that person with the super sledge one hit, please stay the fuck out of my line of fire, (at least make the attempt)...
---
Calm down. It's a video game. People do this because they can.
---
I would love to get a Legendary Sheepsquatch Staff - it already does 720 damage for me so I would love to see it with like the Bloody effect!
---
Someone's friend is another's enemy. Sometimes people play games with PVP to just shoot people, even if it's in a PVE/PVP hybrid mode. Hatetank warned you of this future with his or her gamertag alone...
---
Also cranberry juice. It's only a 2% boost but stacks with the food bonus and only takes diseased berries and water to make.
---
I honestly want to know if I did something wrong, hence the post.
---
Bullies pick on the weak. You sound weak.
---
I can't wait to get the mods for it omg!! Mine already does 720 damage just by itself.
---
You can join Bartie_1967 if you are on GMT.  .We have a small group of friends. What's your level ? I'm 73
---
The issue that people have is that BGS is breaking their promise of the Atom Shop being cosmetic only. There are multiple quotes directly from Pete Hines stating this. With repair kits, they have effectively "moved the goal posts". Or, to quote Darth Vader talking to Lando - "I am ALTERING the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further". It was more about making a statement that we are NOT OK with pay to win in any shape or form, and we are NOT OK with them breaking their promise. This was especially insulting to those of us who have stuck around for all this time, through all the controversy, who have defended the game. 
---
I don't think repair kits matter as far as gameplay balance and fairness goes, but this needs to stop NOW.
---
Where do you kick off the camera quest?
---
That itch is one of the reasons i have multiple characters...that way, you can keep each of your masterpieces intact, indefinitely if you want.
---
Also, AWESOME build! Very nice work!
---
I didn't know him, that's the thing. That's why I am asking about the situation.
---
So you were in a workshop which flags you for pvp and got killed by another player...
---
Working as intended.
---
CUS IM EXCITED!
---
Well, when I say betrayal, I meant unprompted assault.
---
Fair enough, I should change my name to "I don't care what you are doing, have a good time and leave me be"
---
Aye, maybe I am
---
God i hope so...the turret camps behind the clubhouse are the ONLY camps i destroy, but will do so without hesitation every single time!
---
How do you get the Woopsies?
---
Yes I hate that thing, I didn't purchase this plush but actually I see this happen  With different items and it sucks, that's whats happens for example with shelves as well, if you build one you can't place any item in the middle levels but you can just on top leaving the decoration always empty..
---
Spent over an hour in a WS blast zone (i have more rad away then i know what to do with) farming the ingredients to make flux as well as legendaries, found a  two shot Combat Rifle, none explosive and a Furious Combat Rifle and a bunch of crap. I was running a TSE Gatling Gun which does damage but is not one shotting anything but cars. When i groups i would tag everything and run around for a bit letting everyone get their shots in before i mowed down the rest and for legendaries i would try to call/emote to players to come or lead the legendary around a bit. 
---
Like the clubhouse a bunch of people stood by the front door so I would run in shoot and run out leading them outside to waiting players. at one point some other guys came in the back and just start melee one hitting everything to death.
---
I just feel like the enemy density should be 50% higher. Some spaces feel too empty.
---
Oh shit, duh. He was probably just mad at me for getting the factory up before he did then. Thanks, that makes sense now.
---
I'm sure you did not. Do you have any idea how many idiots I encounter on a daily basis playing various video games? Geez man... people who won't participate, who won't communicate, who purposely try to make the matches or games harder for you and everyone else, people who leach off of you for experience or just troll the entire time.. generally speaking, people are trash. You will have to go through about 1,000 people to find 1 decent human being. Such is life in 2019.
---
Happened to me last night. Even with scorched and super mutants
---
I am always forced to spawn at the nearest location? It's never made me only spawn at 76 :( that sounds really frustrating
---
&gt;i
---
I guess it is time to save up for the speed demon recipe!
---
best part of building in FO76 compared to FO4....other people actually get to SEE your masterpieces!
---
I farm Uranium Fever multiple times a day and I've never once had a random group of people where someone would 1-shot the legendary spawns. Most of the time it's 3-6 people in a circle around the forman hiting it with low powered weapons.
---
It ends up looking quite like this actually.

Reflection of the White House? 🤣
---
I'll vote for you as long as we get our Raider kickback in "tech".
---
I've noticed too, sometimes I'd hit them twice and deal no damage
---
With vanguard and heal factor i have more defence out of armor then in, only for prolonged stuff its better on my stims since vanguard lowers as hp lowers
---
I'm on Xbox, GT= Medieval Paul
---
I get on around 5pm CST, message me on XBL if you want one so I know what you're after (I have 15 characters)
---
I am shook and now I want it!
---
This makes sense. I thought I was seeing thing, but I swear to God the first Sheepsquatch I came across was a LvL 62 when I started fighting him. He was a LvL 8p when I killed him. No increase in stars, but that's fucking sweet if it's a thing!
---
I am on XB1 and I haven't experienced this yet. My camera still has my lil mothman stickers on!
---
It's an issue with the terminology Bethesda has used within their games conflicting with how that terminology is used in Online RPGs. 
---
Any indoor location with enemies and a vague "Boss" has been called a dungeon in BGS games since at least Oblivion. Even if it's just a cave with some Bandits and no special loot. 
---
Unfortunately, in Online RPGs a "Dungeon" usually means a very specific thing, which the burrows is not.
---
This is also true.... Learn to always be the bigger asshole when provoked by an asshole and you'll win every time.
---
Need to find the male or female tourist, and search their body. Lots of posts with locations on this sub.
---
Yeah, I've been noticing it quite a bit lately.  Most of the time I even get the sound of the hit connecting but no damage is done.
---
You can find them, unlock them after capturing/ defending workshops and you can buy them at vendors
---
Does this work for all legendaries?!
---
41-42
---
The plans are purchased from vendors (most can be learnt in Whitesprings) and from roaming vendors OR can be found doing quests, capturing settlements, events and randomly finding them. :)
---
Wait is this for adventure as well? Or just survival?
---
and add legendary status to it from the upcoming vendor.
---
BOS Combat armor piece for piece is better than anything else out there.
---
Best "mixed" set is BOS Chest with Studded Leather Arms and Legs.
---
Marine Armor might look the best, Lord knows I want it to be the best (stat-wise), but it isn't. Not by a long shot.
---
What Marine Armor does have going for it is the weight and built-in rad resistance. Ultra Light (mod) Weightless (legendary) Marine Armor weighs 0.
---
Full set of Buttressed Marine Amor: 193/146/90
---
Full set of BOS Combat Armor: 226/266
---
Mixed set: 219/394
---
Over repairing any set will increase the DR until the overrepair breaks, but it is essentially the same across the board.
---
\--------
---
Big problem with both Marine and Trapper armor is the 1/2 step (35&amp;45). If you look at it like level 35 is better than 30, etc. then the level 35 marine is better than lvl 30 combat. If you switch your perspective to lvl 35 is worse than lvl 40 then you start to see where the armor is lacking. Since there is no level 55 armor ingame, The highest level marine armor falls short of everything else because every other armor set can hit level 50 with better stats. If they were only going to have two tiers of it; it should have been level 40 and level 50 so the stats can catch up a bit.
---
Photography is not involved.  You have to find or acquire the plans in-game.  The most common ways to do this are either purchasing the plans from vendors or gaining the plans as quest rewards.  Claiming workshops and defending workshops almost always give plans for your CAMP.
---
I'm sure you could get banned for using a service like this for buying/selling, but find it highly doubtful that Bethesda would ever be able to catch anyone doing it.
---
It violates the TOS, but is **not**, in any way illegal.
---
Or...he just wanted the workshop.
---
Or he just wanted to kill you.
---
Or he just wanted to do it for fun.
---
Or...
---
There seems to be a remnant if the invincibility bug back in the program. If your damage output is op versus the enemy, the first hit doesn’t register. It’s exceedingly frustrating in a mob.
---
Don't post gamertags, not allowed on this sub
---
Really? Thats amazing did you really randomly come across it?
---
With loading screen this long I can do both!
---
Collect and scrap as much junk as you can at first. Set up a basic camp somewhere near the places you want to begin exploring, so you can return home and stash all of your junk quite often. Don't worry about building up your camp too much at first, since you'll probably want to move it as you discover new areas.
---
I went through the game code and made a post about that issue here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bh885p/why\_the\_kill\_an\_alien\_challenge\_works\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bh885p/why_the_kill_an_alien_challenge_works_with/)
---
tl;dr: That one challenge is looking for an NPC tagged with AlienRace when it should (as the rest) be looking for ActorTypeAlien. It's a typo that results in it being impossible.
---
But what if I don't want a staple in my W key?
---
None of them... play like a man I feel people who use mutations at all times suck at the game and need help..  it's just not in good nature to use them for pvp actually..
---
God I miss Dogmeat
---
Pity, I’m on PC. I’m definitely going to keep those drills for scrapping now though.
---
Is the a list for where to find the mountable heads plans? Thanks in advance
---
I've seen speculation that a dlc will allow us to get into the presidential room in the enclave bunker by becoming president.
---
 It's speculated that well have to bounce around the map and vote at the voting booths littered around the map.
---
This could be part of it.
---
Again, pure speculation.
---
Could be a leftover file from f04 like the dog helmets showing up at vendors too.
---
No... This was the case before Trump. 
---
I'd say a reflection of generations just of parents raising a load soft chicken shit Nancy's that aren't shit in real life, so they use the internet to troll people as to feel better about themselves. 
---
If they did it in real life, they'd get their asses kicked so they do this shit online behind closed doors.
---
Man that would give me life.
---
Blasphemy, praise the Interloper my brethren!

Good meme but in big events I tap them usually by meleeing them with my gun and then waving to let other people know
---
Oh that spray-able chloroform meme?
---
Because it's not the actual item you're placing in your CAMP. You need an object to place like a Floor Decor item which *looks like* the item in your inventory, but doesn't function as it. So you can show off what you have, but the actual item is safely stored in your STASH. The downside is that it would function just like another Floor Decor item, which means you can't put it on top of a bed, for instance. It would also mean that if someone destroys it, you just have to repair the display case, not your expensive-to-repair X-01 Power Armor, as an example.
---
And yes, if you go through the various posts Bethesda folks have made on their site &amp; here, they keep talking about "display cases" and not placing the actual objects.
---
I had this as well in the top of the mire!
---
No, you either buy plans from vendors and then use it to learn how to make. Or receive plans from quests/events. Specific vendors sell specific plans, go to whitespring. There you have all the 7 different vendor types and you should be able to buy whatever specific plan you're looking for.
---
But the common event/quest of taking over/protecting workshops rewards alot of the basic plans
---
I can try to hop on before I go to work. So maybe around 1-2pm pst. Are we psn friends yet?
---
Probably will be added later, maybe the station door will open
---
Yeah I'll be tagging you guys in the comments under their post about it, don't worry.
---
Same with booze for the alcohol addicted
---
Well, we got that shit now.... Hatetank is screwed.
---
can you be sure whether they disappeared after a quick travel or not? or were you just standing there one second and the next they were gone?
---
do you remember messing around on your pipboy prior to it? or maybe your stash, or a vendor?
---
I have a vampire's pump action shotgun and a lot of shotgunner perks, in events   i reallocate the shotgun perks to melee and I try to cripple the legendaries by targeting limbs in VATS with the shotty... The vampire means I get health perks for shooting, but I'm not so OP that I one-shot the baddies, and crippling them makes it easier for lower levels to get in a hit.
---
Yesterday I was doing the real sheepsquatch event over by harper's ferry, and a player with a explosive handmade just made mincemeat of Mr 3 Star Skwatchy in like a second, (it actually was impressive,)  and then plowed into Bessie Brahmin and blew her to pieces as well, causing the event to fail.  I was able to loot squatch because I'd tagged it once or twice, but didn't get any plans.  So if any of you are planning on playing that event, watch your field of fire or play with a less OP weapon and just grind it a little bit more.
---
LOL having to go into their inventory selecting inspect then repairing the weapon then coming out of inventory on the most glitchy game ever made and if u cant kill them in that long space of time then you are ultimately poor at the game and should go play minecraft..
---
She was a 3* Legendary drop and I was blessed by the RNG gods ;)
---
What mods does the gun have because they could be effecting it's overall health. Slap a forceful stock on there if you haven't already.
---
This has been happening to me daily for a while now. At first it was just in vats but now it happens outside of vats as well where I am hitting enemies multiple times but they take no damage. Happens with small enemies as well as ghouls etc - the only things I don't seem to have an issue are large enemies like yao guais / sheepsquatch
---
Far from busted! I too was reluctant to get the game due to the media negativity but I did in January and now it's the game I love more than any before.  The genius, hilarity and attention to detail far outweighs the few bugs. And they're constantly updating with fixes and new content. It's a vast and surprising new fallout world and you can explore it with friends (and even make new ones)!
---
Weird that the game but two people from different regions/countries into the same server
---
Are you on PC? If so I have some Plans and Junk for you :)
---
Unfortunately I don’t remember, I got mad at it and scrapped it)
---
I've had it happen a lot since 8.5 and with any size enemies up to charred ferals as of last night. One of them at the golf club took four dead-center hits before one registered.
---
He's not hiding, he's integrated.
---
You can find the plans in random locations, purchase them from vendors, quest rewards or taking workshops.
---
GAVIN?!?!?!
---
Lol, I don’t think everyone does it although I’ve definitely played with a few people who farm ghouls at white springs using explosive guns or grenades and then complain when they can’t find the body of a legendary lol. Like just use a melee weapon so you don’t send the body flying.
---
On xbox I'll give u one for free
---
can you use it with power armor?
---
I got 2 recipes that I didn't know from it as well. I think it's new.
---
Happens to me all the time, usually I have to wait 10 minutes for it to turn into a scrap pile
---
Yea, clearly the problem are the players who one shot everything when Bethesda made this game so easy that you need to undress naked and drop weapons on the ground to make it even casually challenging.
---
You can enter via either of two manholes in Harpers Ferry.
---
Spawns at sparse sundew grove area. Bottom center of maps. Far west edge of cranberry bog
---
Honestly i couldn't tell ya, in the moment i was pissed and just went and made them again lol. Im sure it will happen again ill record it.
---
Sure but to “accidentally” leave general changes or obvious nerfs out of the patch notes over and over again is a stretch. This is a AAA company. Most games I play have pages and pages of patch notes covering everything from correcting spelling errors to refiguring damage formulas. Bethesda says “we changed some stuff, and added some things” and calls it a day.
---
According to the newest Inside the Vault, yes.
---
[https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4aSpwjqqwDZqD3JD6ecTT/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-pioneer-scouts-and-backpacks-april-25-2019](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4aSpwjqqwDZqD3JD6ecTT/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-pioneer-scouts-and-backpacks-april-25-2019)
---
My friend had this happen with his Excavator as well
---
Odd I've never seen that mentioned in any posts. At least the display case part. I figured it would work like any floor decor items. As you said. And would be repaired like any other camp item. I was also thinking it would only apply to junk items not armor. Toys, coffee tins, Mason jars....that sort of thing.
---
Wow, I didn’t know that. Thanks for the tip
---
It is a AAA company, that's exactly why it happend over and over. They change the stuff then write down what they changed, human memory isn't perfect
---
My double XP weekend is actually a quadruple XP weekend, because my partner and I can't complete a mission at the same time and have to do most things twice. I haven't played since December, and wouldn't mind except I can't rustle up enough ammo to keep doing the same quests over and over again. 
---
Other than that, have been pleasantly surprised with how much more fun FO76 has been this go around. And I leveled up like 5 times yesterday. \^.\^
---
Huh steak house is actually a good idea. Thanks for that one.
---
All I'm looking for are thosw mythical BoS Arm plans, thanks anyway though.
---
Yeah. I just recently moved to a new location in preparation of player vending trying to work out CAMP glitches before it's live. 
---
I'm also looking forward to some of the potential options for things that supposedly may be released with pioneer scouts.
---
Do you have pictures of the backpacks that made it to the game?
---
It's a predator terminator
---
Not sure where it is but from the name it could be MODUS' mainframe?
---
But what if I'm here reading posts?
---
JE SU S
---
Why is it preferable in survival? Do you get more xp there?
---
One of the many advantages to survival
---
Take a nap in your room before leaving the vault - being well-rested gives you an XP boost for a while, which is nice to have starting out.
---
Also to add to your points, you can find the four generator plans from repairing the three power plants on the map, thunder mountain, Poseidon, or monongah. You’ll get them in a random order. There are also free plans scattered across the map in specific locations. Those plans are either static (like the nuka cola quantum power armor paint for example) or cycle between specific loot pools (like marine armor in harpers ferry). When you pick one of those up they won’t respawn for about 24 hrs. If you don’t pick them up and server hop, you can change which plan from that loot pool is there. Here’s the best guide I’ve found on this topic: https://youtu.be/diJLAwFAaUA
---
In events like WS Nuke zone, I use a low damage high ROF weapon to just Tag everything as long as others are playing nice too.
---
I swap my cards to make myself a TANK, and run around Kiting everything for my team since I'm one of the few 200+ level players in my group.
---
But... When I encounter some A$$hat trying to One hit everything and steal everyone else's spawns, I swap cards &amp; weapons and run around blocking them and One shotting all the Legendary enemies before they can get a hit, (trying to send a message).
---
Listen here you little shit...
---
Nothing will separate me from my Assassin board or Furious Rolling Pin because with the power of Gordon Ramsey, anything is possible so jot that down...
---
Yes because I’m assuming the bonus applies on top of double do. That said, I didn’t test it.
---
Here's an AWESOME example!
---
https://clutch.win/posts/aspeeed-fallout-76-xbox-duuddeee-diiiieeeeee/
---
It’s not cool til he swings the hammer
---
I'm from the UK so I would assume we have European servers :)
---
yes
---
I have used both. I currently run the mutation with weightless armor.
---
They definitely are not the same. But I think it is more from the side benefits of having your armor weigh nothing or next to nothing.
---
Armor weight affects noise (sneak) and sprinting AP cost. If you are not moving AT all, the Legendary effect will keep you invisible (obviously). The second you take one step, turn, twich, or fidget; you start to make "noise" even if the invisible effect doesnt break. Monsters can and do home in on noise when sight doesnt work. Mole Rats and Ants are a perfect example, they will track you even if you are stealthed from the noise you are making.
---
Switching to weightless armor changes things. Less noise = less tracking. In broad daylight I can sneak up to a Super Mutant and dry hump them from behind and not break caution. At night, said ants and mole rats cannot track me while in Sneak. Daytime is about 50/50 depending on how much I move around. It is quite the feeling though to sneak up on a mole rat and stab that sumbitch over and over and never lose Sneak.
---
I do not. I haven't found and reinstalled the programs I need to extract and view Bethesda's texture files.
---
From the file names, I know there is about a dozen different colors with Nuka/Quantum and Vault-Tek variants of each.
---
Oh right lol. Well hopefully it'll come.in handy to know for future reference. Check the health bar when modding. Most the desirable mods will shrink it. A forceful stock will near enough double it.
---
If I'm solo, I 1-shot the hell out of everything. As soon as someone else, *sigh*, shows up, I leave stealth, pop a diluted radaway and pull out the handmade.
---
Thanks, I’ll be sure to check it
---
I was getting them a lot, so I started scrapping a few and learned the Piercing &amp; Barbed Bit mods pretty quickly.
---
Well I found the bridge but saw no bad bear in the area, I'll go check again later.
---
But thanks :)
---
I try to be nice and not one shot everything but then you have those butt munchers who try to beat you to everything so then I just one shot everything including legendaries. But if I come across someone who isn't like that I have my trusty drill with it's invisible 3 stars that I use to not kill everything.
---
Yup, I've had the drill disappear and a "real" legendary show up in its place if I leave the body and come back a few minutes later.  
---
Always loot west-tec on the way *out* now.
---
Yeah it's a dick move when people one shot legendaries - especially when there's other people around. My team and I always carry smaller weapons like my combat knife to poke things and try to wait until everyone gets a hit before killing things but there always seems to be that one random that comes and just blows it away :/ 
---
happened to us at one violent night - we were all making sure everyone got hits on the ghouls and everything was going pretty smooth - the wendigo came - i barely saw it before the random one shot it :/ so rude
---
Wow really nice
---
But did you try an actual wire instead of wifi?
---
try swapping out for Molotov Cocktails.
---
Can blanket an area, they don't do a crazy amount of damage.
---
For me, I usually do a quick melee attack to get my hit in, then kite the enemy around so everybody gets a shot in. Then I blow it away myself so that everybody saves ammo.
---
Even when you’re using a TSE, you can use it in a way that doesn’t make you a dick.
---
please do. this has happened to several users but nobody knows how to replicate it.
---
it'd be great if we had video proof or just footage to analyze, really.
---
Captainoob getting a lot of love today, he's great at making me look shit with every weapon.
---
Nothing is stopping you from playing on Survival in the manner you want. The leaderboards just give the murderhobos something to chase after and other players to avoid. I was in a similar mindset to you when I heard it wasn't going to require new characters, thinking "well it'll just be a death match free for all." I decided to give it a try anyways and have made 2 Survival exclusive characters since it's release. It definitely adds an edge because you never know if someone is just going to murder you on sight, but I've also seen that if you put in an effort to communicate and show you're not a murderhobo that there are other like-minded players on Survival as well.
---
Also important to note that as long as you make sure to deposit your junk into your stash and travel with a minimal amount of aid items that death is incredibly inconsequential now that caps loss on death has been reduced to 25% of your level. Or you can be like some of the folks I've killed and reward people with stacks of 30+ stimpaks should you choose to risk it.
---
Yeah for real, I've seen it happen to quite a few people too.
---
This too. Some yahoo in PA always has to be between the mob and everyone else.
---
Thats pretty cool i must say
---
Not cool, B!
---
People build them all the time. Just place your camp inside a tree to get extra building height.
---
Guy 1: *Has cross hairs on vault dweller*
---
VD: *pulls out camera and waves and teleports behind guy 1* 
---
VD: "Nothing personal kid"
---
Guy 1: "NANI!"
---
Just an example
---
A new accuracy skill was added. lolol  
---
Nah but this has been a problem for me since launch, I'll get the sound effect of hitting them but it'll just flat out do no damage, has gotten me killed numerous times. Wish they would fix it because man it sucks missing 5 swings and just getting destroyed.
---
Oh no, not my camp! If suddenly the vault door creeks open one day and a bunch of aliens emerge I’ll quite literally shit my self out of terror
---
what if you put it on a rug, and then put the rug up there?
---
Life saving armor doesn't work like that. You get downed and then after a second might get back up
---
Okay thank you for letting me know! I really like the concept pictures they posted and I hope some of my favorites made it! I'm really wanting the squarish red/white nuka cola backpack. That sounds really exciting tho!
---
I was just using it as an example
---
I like scaly skin.  Free armor, just less ap.  I don't use vats so I don't really mind it at all.
---
I take it you're not into CAMP building then?
---
I have often thought that people who play this game and don't enjoy building can't really have much end game to speak of.
---
For myself... I literally spend 70% of my time working on CAMPs and the end game is sourcing plans, materials and completing challenges to buy decorations from the Atom Shop. This keeps me busy for hours on end.
---
If you don't like doing this, I personally see little point in playing this full-time between updates.
---
Last night was worst for me in a few weeks. Kind of a pain as my character thrives on the run in &amp; punch the daylights out of everything. The sprint seems to give a slight boost to melee, but damned near guarantees the first hit won't connect.
---
seems fitting
---
I really didn't understand the part where it was a "High level repeatable dungeon" when its just another location
---
I'll find what I need over the weekend and extract it. Most people data mining that stuff are posting on their own webpages/social media and it very rarely gets linked here unless a YouTuber here picks it up.
---
Well you can always go and play fallout1,2,3,new vegas and 4 if you want those. Why are you still here?
---
Where did you get the info that all Brahmin have to survive for better rewards?
---
Yep. Had it happen in nuke zone last night. Hammer going right through glowing ones, when the all rise is my usual go-to in these swarms. Had to revert to shot gun.
---
I didn’t get the event but a legendary sheepsqautch appeared outside Robo Co. Got some neat stuff off of it.
---
Yes please!!! My friends and I were just talking about this yesterday. I wish they had some monsters swimming around in deeper water too. You can see bodies of mutated dolphins laying around, I wish I could find a live one.
---
Third person view seems to have really wonky hit detection for melee.
---
I don't notice it in first person at all.
---
The only time I one-shot anything is random trash mobs, like gutsies and protectrons during Encryptid.  If I see a legendary, I either stand up and give it a non-sneak attack tap or swap to my backup knife if it's something like a lvl 42 ghoul that I might accidentally kill even with a regular shot in the leg.
---
If no one else is around, then it's fair game.  If I'm even just at Whitepsring or the Burrows and someone else is nearby, I'll do a "come over here" emote.  It's simple sharing that I learned to do in pre-school.  I don't understand why it's so difficult for some.
---
You never died before loading in have you. Sometime you just cannot spawn there and that all there is unless you run and sneak.
---
When you do SBQ it dosent tell you that you have it thats it dude🔥
---
What really breaks this event in my opinion is how little time there is between activating the recall terminal and Sassi Boi showing up. Unlike a nuke launch, there is no countdown to give people a chance to prepare, gear up and travel to the location. And when the first people do slowly start to arrive (ignoring the pylons and immediately attacking the invincible bot), the event is almost over. Great concept!
---
If you are shooting or moving it turns off
---
It's ways been that way, and the amount is based on your total camp budget.
---
It was good advice. I'm just a coward :)
---
I have done the event 4 times, twice no legendary :'(
---
He's done it with a couple of different knives I believe
---
Nope. Was there last night.
---
then again I'm on PS4
---
There is one, but I have never been able to successfully attach it to the wall. It just clips through the floor.
---
Why do people keep refering to dropping the item i dont need a paper bag on the floor. I want a repair kit on my shelf. How do expect to put a teddy bear up there? Drop it the in a bag on the shelf..... Like Really this isnt Fo4 Or 3.
---
yeh its broken alright
---
Ahh okay, I was confused where they came from :) thanks!
---
lol yep
---
It is to prevent you from going over weight when putting power armor on. It isn't a competition.
---
Shhhh, can't you just let us be furious over our own assumptions? This is reddit, dammit!
---
Life.... finds a way.
---
I saw it in someone elses thread last night, but tbqh I can’t find which thread it was- but I’m fairly certain it’s true, because on the runs I’ve done where 3 Brahmin survive I’ve gotten plans for the Sheepsquatch weapons and its mods, but when only 1 survives I consistently just get recipes.
---
With today’s weird camera challenge I think something’s happening
---
"Buy a bunch of repair kits and carry them with you."  
---
\-Bethesda as they laugh at your weapon breaking
---
I’m actually really excited about this quest line and these backpacks
---
Nice bonus, found the witch with her hat and costume plans while running the event. Already have them so if anyone wants to make an offer they are up for grabs. Also have several mutton meat pie recipes I'll sell cheap or throw in with the costume purchase. Costume and hat are a set, don't want to sell apart.
---
Pro tip. If you are high enough level to kill the first squach before it does the legendary rehealth I am starting to think you get a second spawn of a legendary. Granted 1st won't, or hasn't dropped legendary items but it's a nice way to load up on horns and ballistic fiber.
---
I’ve seen a site with the best stuff for like 15$ . If you grind away 200 hours for the best gun 15$ seems worth it
---
They can just show up at any random spawn location
---
Maybe they’re adding it today - what’s up with the new camera daily challenge?
---
Yeah, I found that one with the help of reddit.  The church still isn't named for some reason.  Very easy to never find if you don't wander around in the middle of nowhere like I sometimes do.
---
It's a shame what happened to Calvin's buddy Ray.  (I think that's what his name is.)
---
More than agree. It maybe contained situation where You not expect anyone and 3* leggie may one shot You as well, so better be quick about it. I understand that doing that when You see other players maybe vicious and I try to avoid it. Maybe nuked areas should be shared on xp and loot among all raiding players.
---
Alien vs Predator? But... aren't they both aliens? And they are definitely both predators...
---
There is definitely something going on with melee hits since the last patch. Hopefully they get it sorted out.

The BBQ Shack, mid Savage Divide, SE of Top of the World.

I’ve noticed that my vats rifle shots are missing a LOT. Like the old bug where you fire 5 shots at 95% and they all miss until you re enter vats
---
You bet☺
---
In fallout you aren't traveling a lot planning your day as you go. You are surviving, shoving every decent bit of food in your bag for safe keeping.
---
I just can't get over the sound it makes and the visual I see every time somebody kills somebody else.  I honestly don't care that T-bag killed D-bag just to have D-bag kill T-bag 10 seconds later.  Stop telling me over and over. Its more than annoying to me.
---
Also the fact that there's any kind of leader board at all makes me feel like I have to deposit a quarter somewhere every time I want to play.
---
 Then there's the people who spent more time on the market reddit than actually playing the game. Now they're so twinked out they are almost unkillable.
---
They have finished every quest and have gotten every item they need to do the only thing left for them to do... kill other people.
---
  Anyway that's just a lot of complaining about things that are out of my control.
---
You cannot make a perfect game mode for everybody I guess. It just sucks that I'm stuck in the middle of not wanting to play either mode.
---
They already made it so you could Fast Travel while encumbered, just equip the camera, and wave goodbye, Hehehe.
---
Use logic, What could it be?
---
It's just like the impostor.. no one did the pylons for the few days... people just shot at everything they see and then look at what they should do
---
I’d laugh if this wouldn’t be the truth
---
I haven't been able to log in yet, what's the challenge for today?
---
I don't know what people were hoping for, but I go there once a day as part of my legendary hunting enjoyment.  Lots of opportunity.
---
I guess so lol
---
Vote Cthulhu! Why settle for a lesser evil?
---
Legies on mmorpg or bosses have rather more life and a bit lower damage overoll so killing them takes more time and more peoples can tag along, not to mention spawn is proportional to amount of players in area so You dont have to wait to long for new one to pop in same place.
---
But fo76 its not standard mmorpg is it? 😛😛
---
These problems being so common is the exact reason we should complain.  The game is broken.
---
Sounds to me they're still trying... You took it as them telling you to start over. They just want to rule out if it's character or item specific. You don't have to abandon your old character or continue the new one. They just want to know if the issue is common between your characters on the same PC.
---
I don't know about all of them but generally if you kill or hit them too early they will sometimes not become legendary or not get a star. I've seen this happen with events like uranium fever where if you hit the management guys too early they will just be crowned.
---
Like wise if you kill a two to 3 star legendary before they fully heal they will drop a 1 star.
---
There will be the ability to display items in camp. I forget when it comes out
---
I was just being cheeky.  I'd never turn down more carry weight.
---
Every time I take more than two I blue-screen...every.single.time.
---
Look above your post for video evidence.
---
SMH, first bethesda made super mutants false advertise. NOW THIS??! uninstalling!
---
Right lmao, but all these lovely people have given you the best options.   
---
Which is Weapon Artisan, will help you a lot.  👍
---
Yes, or just avoid workshops or play Fallout 4 if you don't want player interaction in a PVP area.
---
berry mentats + 5 int
---
Yeah i also heard aliens mostly come out at night...mostly.
---
Bethesda's marketing method is one of their biggest weaknesses, IMO. They tend to overhype stuff in an attempt to get more purchases or plays and it leads to disappointment from a lot of people.
---
While they have increased the stash, it's still very easy to horde/max out your stash if you're used to previous fallouts. Ammo has weight, and you can't sell to vendors, I recommend only keeping ammo for guns you use. Power cores weigh a LOT, so unless you plan on going a Power Armor build, don't save every one. They also come with different charges, so not worth saving low charged ones unless you are going full PA,early. Chems are the best to pick up and sell in the beginning, very high sell value/wt. Same with outfits, pick up all to sell. Pick up the pharma farma perk card early (1 rank is enough), it gives you the option to "search' chem/first aid boxes for extra chems (a new button appears below the box, you have to manually push the button to search it) and helps tremendous in the beginning to get extra chems to sell.
---
Pick up all weapons/armor to scrap, you learn mods in FO76 by scrapping. Don't waste materials in the beginning to repair - you get new armor/weapons frequently enough. I recommend either going a melee build or a sneak build for your first character - they're lower resource which helps while you're still learning the game. Power Armor, even just the frame, is very strong early, you can find random spawns, but definitely not needed. Take over workshops at least 1 or 2 times, they reward you with camp building plans. If you want better generators, do the "powering up" events, completing them gives you generator plans. The earliest area for this event is the Poseidon Power Plant near the Charleston Train Station (you'll get their eventually if you follow the main quest). The event itself can become confusing bc inside the plant is a maze, and the event is timed, just a heads up.
---
Don't believe me try running uranium fever and let the legendaries finish spawning you will see it. It happens for me all the time on PC.
---
So instead of being rewarded for having a perk we get nothing. Thanks Bethesda.
---
It's just in the game code. It's pretty much the same as the Weekly requirement except it uses the proper  ActorTypeAlien  flag and actually has checks for the camera and lens; which is a new feature and unique to that challenge.
---
Strangely, it has no requirement for wearing the hat, so it's either not finished or the person making these dailies needs to not be the person making the dailies. [http://prntscr.com/nh9yck](http://prntscr.com/nh9yck)

Hol up

Myself (almost lvl 200) and two others in the +/- 200 range managed to keep one cow alive.  Those bastards are tough as nails, even with three strong players armed with various explosive legendary guns.

As TheHoboSeer I appreciate and approve of your base!
---
I've run this 26 times now and I'd believe it's like Fasnacht's masks where as more brahmin die, you're less likely to get a weapon/mod plan. The only time I haven't is when brahmin died.
---
You should try events in Survival mode, 4 players kicked 9 players(including self) out of the Uranium Fever and murdered us if we tried to enter.
---
I have a ton of Teddys saved for this, lol. I swear I’m going to log into my sons account and FILL HIS CAMP. #mom
---
It's the spelled-out acronym for MODUS. I took a picture of the big-ass mainframe, and that completed the challenge.
---
Not sure this is entirely the case. I experience it too and i only have 3 str and zero melee perks
---
no actual aimboting and being imortal with doggy and using infinit ap (i just teste it out the hacks and they work)
---
Place something through the bunk bed or on if you can then put him on just a thought sorry if it doesnt work
---
what shotgun/build are you using?
---
Me to, I’ve already stacked 20 in the last couple days lol
---
Don’t remember the exact text but it’s about taking a picture of some sort of computer equipment that I’ve never come across.
---
I'm sure Bethesda has a well thought out, working and visually pleasing contingency plan for cases like this... right? RIGHT?!
---
Hate speech is legal everywhere in the US.
---
Intentionally duping items in a video game is also most likely illegal under the federal computer misuse act.
---
There's a new event at Freddie's/Fred's BBQ shack  or whatever it's called that spawns a legendary Sheepsquatch at the end as well
---
Hitting them doesn’t hurt them or herd them to my knowledge, it is fun though :)
---
Or.. just say there's been a mass pilgrimage and add in npcs. Pleasseee
---
Simple trying gets the job done. I ignored all that and spent 10 minutes remembering how to get in the actual mainframe room. Good job
---
What's sad about this is that it confirms that the only real objective of this game is to farm legendaries and that Bethesda with every update seems to nerf spawn rates in the world even further. Now we are stuck with farming legendaries at events that aren't challenging and you need to worry about some asshat with a TSE shotgun, that he bought from a duper, killing the legendary before you get a shot on it.
---
My TSE with perk cards one shots almost everything 50 and under when I use vats, so whenever I see one I usually just hop fire for half the damage
---
You would still keep food readily available, if you have ever done long hikes or camping, that would be your life in the fallout world, you would have a system for it. A favorites item that represents all your food would be the quick snack area of your pack.
---
This is great. Thanks for sharing it. 
---
Would be even more awesome if I weren't partly colorblind. :-(
---
I’m hoping I can fill a bathtub with prewar money
---
I burned through 80 in that event! Removed the Medic Pump and will never use it again, lost so much,  and we failed the event :-(
---
Did you have the names of the backpacks too?
---
Shame as on Xbox , thx though :)
---
They look awesome, yeah! I love the half-rotten skull face they have.
---
Yep exactly same symptoms. 
---
If I've played like 10 mins or longer, and if I exit to main menu, it will give the errors and I can't do anything. If I try to directly join someones server while being already in another, it exists to main screen and then it displays "loading..." forever, because it's not really loading anything, it just cant display the proper errors either.
---
I can get that infinite "searching for world" if the login expires while in main menu, like when looking at the atom shop. Normally since I play for awhile,  then eventually exit a server to switch a char, I get the errors.
---
Odd how it started with me, little after the previous patch. Not right after, and certainly not right from the beginning.
---
I dont remember the exact location but i think up by dolly sods and the carson family bunker. I could be wrong.
---
+1Karma
---
Carnivore is super helpful too- get plenty of glowing meat fighting glowing enemies (Uranium Fever is a glowing meat goldmine). A friend got herbivore instead but complains that it disrupts his play because he has to farm veggies much more (eats so much melon), so he redid all his mutations to swap over to carnivore.
---
I agree to an extent, If its just non legendary bots in the encryptid event then sorry bro, we're not failing this thing just so you can get the steel and fusion cells. Same for SBQ fight. Legendaries I try to tag and move on for a few, but if they become a problem and no one else is hitting them then I gotta do what I gotta do.
---
Just started playing 76 and my partner and I teamed up and built a camp together. Then some level 58 fucker came in and tried to get us to attack him and followed us around our shit for way too long. Even dropped something for my partner and goaded him to pick it up. Annoying man. We were levels 2 and 3 why come mess with us? Then we worried he was gonna destroy our camp but it didn’t come to that thankfully.
---
Nice one. As soon I get the digital copy which I will next few days .. got to now haven’t I
---
He's done around 80 weapons for fo76 now. I was just making a joke.
---
Awesome to hear!
---
I know there's a metal one for the wall - but nice wooden ones or something would be nice and less industrial
---
Nice I think it's time to jump in then
---
My melee switches to a low level sawed-off shotgun in these events and farming locations if anyone is present. Spray the crowd, step back and let others get their hits in.
---
If I am alone, I am one-shotting the lot. No point in being eaten alive by the mob. If you come on the scene in the middle of a big melee- I will switch if I see you. But it is chaos in that mob. I may not see you till its clear.
---
Pretty sure you get it from sheepsqauch event to i dont do the quenn and got a few
---
Is it quite low to the ground with a small platform that has a half wall and a chair? Because I might have found it haha
---
You're doing the lord's work man! I appreciate it!

You're welcome. I don't know what time zone you're in (I'm EDT), but if you like to play with other people, you're welcome to join me and the folks I play with, though we'd probably need to party chat on more than one team at certain points as we have more than 4 rolling through at many points. I'm lvl 71 rn and everyone else is above that (unless they join on lower level alts). But we are pretty casual and laugh and joke a lot, and sometimes just wander and go wherever the breeze takes us, or to some specific quest a teammate wants to complete (so that may not be your style). However, we do like to do different events, whitesprings, nuke zones, SBQ, West tek, the asylum, Encryptid, sheepsquatch, etc. I can share lvl 2 inspirational for additional XP if I don't need to share something else for whatever we're doing. I'm also known to pass out cranberry relish or cobbler for additional XP (if the darn cranberries respawn for me more than every third day smh).
---
PSN - chakra_bender 
---
If you friend request me, send a note reminding me who you are.
---
I second this. I always give a stack to a low level trying to farm exp at whitesprings. Tell them to hang back and toss a molotov in to each group from a safe location.
---
Seen several 3*
---
Lewisburg and it’s rooftop planters are pretty neat. Also, the valley galleria is really cool.
---
Everybody's focused on the Squatch? They've never seen one before so you can't really brahmin!
---
(Okay, that pun doesn't work at all, but I'm bored).
---
Just fought a 3*
---
You literally just admitted to downloading and using a third party hack?
---
any other option would lead to people hogging and kill stealing.
---
Yes, will be able to easily sustain this. I can make about 7,000 caps per day over 5 characters and able to switch them to my main with my wife's console.
---
I just started a couple of weeks ago after intentionally waiting for them to fix all the major bugs. I've thoroughly enjoyed it so far. It feels like a Fallout game to me, just with other people around. It was the same when I played ESO a year after release.
---
Did he actually shoot you? Because it is common for people to get your attention when giving you something to shoot at the ground/bag. There are so many stories of higher lvl players trying to be helpful and drop aid items and ammo etc and shooting at the bag on the ground to bring attention to it and new players don’t understand and run away lol. 
---
When I had somebody attack my camp they shot a bunch of mini-nukes and leveled half my camp very quickly. There was no mistaking it.
---
I used to do that with a lower level melee till someone pointed it out. Now I step back and use a sawed-off instead.
---
mention it, they may not realize.
---
They're not named internally yet. All of them are just called "Backpack" with their internal names "Clothes_Backpack_Normal_Green" or whatever for various colors. The mods are named as listed in that image.
---
I’ll be sure to send you a request when I get a little more time off work;) it may take a while. Thanks. My time zone is gmt +3
---
Totally hear you! I will say that overgeared players are still killable for the most part, playing smart and knowing counters (stagger/crits for sentinel armor) can give you a huge edge over the kinds of players you're talking about because honestly most of them sprint around high off TSE shotgun spam.
---
You're right that a game mode will never be perfect for everyone, but that's why I dropped you the comment because I was definitely skeptical at first but now I never play Adventure mode. If you're on Xbox and ever want to team up in Survival, my GT is raidenbckbckfwd.
---
Where was it?
---
Wait, it takes at least an hour to drain the caps from one character's pool, how much do you play?
---
Pretty sure this is going to be part of the "Wasteland President" series. Those voting terminals we see all over the place? I think it will allow us to vote for a president and the president will get access to the Enclave presidental bunker as well as the Presidental suite in the Whitesprings.
---
So good hearing such positive feedback , that’s exactly what I’ve done .. waited . I need to get this and I will now . Thanks
---
maybe a first timer that expected mecha-squatch levels of health and difficulty?
---
Thanks for the detailed response. I've got a friend that wants to get a new game and we're between this and world war z and so feedback from people playing is actually really helpful (most of the reviews about fo76 are really biased in either direction and don't take new content into account). Not trying to tell anyone what to think just looking for some opinions from current players... 
---
(Few people on here just gave me grief without an honest response, thanks for actually giving an honest answer)
---
\+25% of the full damage, and +1 pellet. Main problem is that the spread is something like 2.5x larger.
---
I found the event for the first time this morning and there were two of them, both one star and both lvl 80.  Tough bastards, too.
---
Had this issue yesterday consistently. 3 separate legendary 3*, zero drops. Waited a few, went back and still nothing. Twice with sheep recall event and once at AWOL.
---
That looks awesome.
---
When you get footage tweet it at Bethesda, I'm sure they would retweet it.
---
One in cranberry bog. One following cow herding quest that started at southern belle motel. Killed 5 now. No weapons drops for me yet😐
---
Yeah, unlike a nuke drop, there's certainly not enough time to: 
---
* Finish what you're doing
---
* Travel to your camp or a nearby stash to drop junk and pickup any gear you might want
---
* Travel to the event
---
K makes sense, the performance is what most worries me so thanks for the input.
---
How do I enter?
---
yap and bathesda cant for the sake of fixing the game actually detect it ...
---
I read the robot voice in the voice of the DMV unimpressed robots lol
---
Coupl or people replying with this and it's good to hear, will most likely jump in!
---
It's like I can finally think straight!
---
This is insanely annoying, especially with concentrated fire. Nothing like being bum rushed by a mob of ghouls as a bloodied build and firing off 5 shots before you realize that you need to exit VATS and try again.
---
I enjoy defending workshops, and sit on the munitions a lot because of it. 
---
PA is about the worst choice you can make. It's **loud**, has a giant hit box, and makes you super squishy to AP and VATS crits.
---
thought it was coincidental, but after reading countless threads, Bethesda messed something up big time.
---
Last time I tried on survival, I was 45 and an 88/100 team thought it was a better idea to get a few caps and aid from me instead of finish the event. 
---
The cows died before I did and I already killed one of them so I knew I had a chance if I shot back. Mindless Ghouls -1\*
---
A body will spawn at a tourist location. I found mine at the giant teapot over by Charleston but the body can spawn at numerous locations such as Wavy Willard's, Phillipi Battlefield Cemetery, Miner's Monument, Colonel Kelly Monument. The spawn is not always there so you will probably need to server hop to find one. Best bet is to just pick a location and hop instead of fast traveling everywhere and wasting caps. It took me quite a few hops before the corpse spawned.
---
You soo baaahd.  I was going to ram a "me so horny" pun in there, too, butt I felt a little sheepish about it.  You catch what I'm squatchin'?
---
They said that the backpack that you equip will be hidden but still functional.
---
The people are still realy nice and Bethesda added a Survival (PvP) mode. They also added some new quest to the game like the one of the Sheepsquatch and they will add much more soon. I would deffinitly recommend you to play the game!
---
Same here, stood there waited and waited while battles happened around me, felt like a zen master, but not even a drill.
---
Oof you're telling me. I had over 200 stimpaks and after one Encryptid I'd lost almost all of them thanks to how poorly we were doing. I also stripped all my PA of medic pumps after THAT nonsense.
---
No they didn’t actually shoot us. You could very well be right! Just had a different vibe than when the other person helped me on my own.
---
Here are a few I picked up:
---
1. Scrap all your junk whenever possible at a workbench.
---
2. Pickup all the guns you find early on and break them down (you learn how to craft mods this way)
---
3. Prioritize perks that allow crafting and reduce weight of junk, chems, and weapons
---
4. When you build, do not put windows/valuable stuff on the ground floor, your foundation should be above ground to avoid critter damage
---
Sure, NP. Glad I could help out. I have gotten 3,850 ultracite shells so far with the GP you gave me.  Ran out of lead, but that's easier for me to collect than gunpowder.
---
I appreciate the comment, but how does that help me? PA is squishy to AP? I don't have issues with AP, honestly.
---
850 sounds nice until you realize a Max lvl scorched gives 250 on its own
---
Well you fail it if they die, so keep all alive. At the very least you get more rewards making it to the SS before they all die, and rewards at the end for successful completion and not a lame ass failure.
---
To elaborate, you can do the quest on the same plant multiple times until you have unlocked all four generator plans.  You do not have to do each of the different power plant repair quests.
---
Makes me want to buy a headset, justs so I can say alright dude alright, you're Conan, we get it FFS. LoL
---
Did you shoot her total five times with your lever action? I found out sometimes i only get the ammo back, nothing else
---
Just had this happen to me some guy with a one hit melee build just robbed me of some 3* loot smh
---
Depends on what event you are talking about.   The mole miners at uranium fever are  really weak for anyone far north of level 50.  With a non-legendary level 50 weapon, it's extremely easy to take them out fast without even trying.
---
I had a bit of a break myself, from mid-February to two days ago. Coming back, it still felt the same, but jussttt a bit more polished. Like, beyond the new content, the best "quality of life" improvement to me was that vendor caps are now pooled, so you can earn your daily 1,400 from any one vendor. Like, it is oddly nice to not have to worry about the daily "chore" of the 30-minute vendor loop just to sell excess gear and items. I haven't had any especially negative interactions beyond the first week of the beta, so I may have just been lucky in that regard. 
---
For the Sheepsquatch quest itself - There is a poster available for 'free' purchase in the atomic store. You can place this in your camp and look at it to get the quest line started. Otherwise, just pop over to the Lewisburg Station, and you can find some posters there.
---
Probably a ton of challenges that give atom you haven't finished yet
---
i don’t think you know what hacking is man
---
I reviewed my runs and a couple runs I saw done on YouTube, it looks like if only a single Brahmin survives you're most likely- if not guaranteed- to only get the Mutton Meat Pie recipe and possibly a Shepherd's Crook plan, whereas 3 Brahmin surviving almost guarantees a mod plan.
---
It's good if you're basically in melee range, but the hipfire spread on 2-shot is insane.  A [2-shot coach gun](https://imgur.com/hoiW4fY) has an accuracy of 0.  A [2-shot pump action](https://imgur.com/JJg0P1D) isn't much better with 7.
---
Anti-armor is a much better choice, as is bloodied if you've got the proper armor to run around with less than 20% health.
---
Thank you, maybe the sheepsquatch can't drop weapons like a legendary scorched. And can the event be found everytime at this hotel?
---
Exactly, thanks for clarifying! And I believe Poseidon is the easier one to do repeatedly iirc.
---
Yes, but each mole rat gives 66.
---
The Flatwoods monster counts asan alien
---
The new event free range which happened in the mire. I did the same event in the forest yesterday and that sheep was only 1* so I think they’re levelled based on what location the event spawns
---
Never had nearly the number of issues people have seemed to have. I can't remember the last time I had more than a brief little slow down or momentary freeze.
---
I'm on console though
---
I posted a pic in the market reddit. Look under my posts and there's a photo!
---
I think so, the event (Free Range) popped up for me early in the AM (I get up at around 5 AM and play for about an hour. )  I happened to be near Harper's Ferry taking pictures with the camera and I saw an area on my compass that indicated a Farm I'd never explored, which is odd because I've been everywhere.  When I got there, the event was rolling and more and more people showed up as it went along.   It was before I'd even seen reddit posts about the real sheepsquatch... also, the event is also geared around protecting the Brahmin and that may have been missed as people showed up and tried to get a shot or two in...
---
its a literal hack my dude
---
Then do use it?
---
Love this idea
---
Yeah. Time difference might make it difficult to be online at the same time, but you never know.
---
Good advice thank you!
---
I tend to horde more powder than I use and since I can’t bulk and sell it, it tends to fill up my stash so I may drop more on you in the future.
---
He must have high strength... 15 max pts, plus the radicool he mentioned +5 more. That alone is 100lbs carry weight, plus 200 from calibrated shocks, thats 300, plus 40 from strong back perk. Thats 340lbs on top of whatever your base carry weight is. Add herd mentality +2 more strength when playing in team, thats 10lb more. Some whisky and party perk, +4 more strength, so 20 morr lbs... some chems etc etc
---
Thanks for the replies so far. Hoping to hear from others on XB1 about this. We need a larger sample size. I am 100% sure that the Mothman skin does not "stick" onto the camera permanently. I am curious if it's related to last weeks bug from Patch 8 that prevented weapon and armor mods from being applied? It's the same exact steps and interface to apply skins.
---
Ok thank you :)
---
Not for this challenge
---
pffft i have seen better photoshops from my dog
---
I've encountered a level 80 2star at the Overgrown Sundew Grove at the bottom of Cranberry bog - random encounter.
---
Even if his pocket knife falls short, his words will certainly bring them to their knees
---
The minimap shows you where players are, already.
---
It's also easy enough to mod the game if you're familiar with scripting because it still uses the creation engine.
---
My boy
---
Yeah the success rate so far has been this with me; one group who didn't know what they were doing/expected the highest level player there (me) to take the pylons and fight it. Me and a friend initiated it and nobody turned up. We tried it but just ran out of time as it's a bit tricky to fight it, contend with the extra enemies and the drain of the pylons. One extra similarly levelled person could have made all the difference.
---
1. You don’t play the game. you actually just made a new account to post this since your old one had evidence against you. see 5 karma. 2nd most of the jacks you listed are features. all players are always visible on map unless they’re sneaking. 3.The overlay looks awful and is obviously photoshopped. You clearly don’t have good english or you are 5 years old and butt hurt because you don’t like the game.
---
Yeah, he is bad in Photoshopping!
---
Thanks! I’m hoping to log back in next weekend. I was only ~level 30 so I will probably start over completely. That’s good about the vendors, the grind to just sell gear was annoying.
---
How did you not have knowledge of it ....
---
You could have opted into the beta.... And made a decision based on how buggy the game was at that stage .....
---
Or waited and read the 873464 reviews that discussed the bugs issue.....
---
It was pretty easy to get an idea of where the game was at, even prior to launch....

---
I just run about with my Anti-Armor Double-Barrel Shotgun crippling the legs on all the mobs (blessed be Rank 3 Enforcer) then leading other vault dwellers to any legendary enemies I find.
---
I use my SS, but won’t use the heavy hit so that others can get a tag on it. If I use heavy hit I’ll bring it down quick and I try not to do that in group events. I used to just heavy hit until it was dead until someone mentioned it to me and I felt bad because I didn’t even realize it. So if you see someone doing it, bring it to their attention.
---
hahahaha r/FalloutFilthyCasuals
---
At least Fallout 76 is a PVP focused game. It would suck if the game was about managing your gear and other survival based aspects and they tried to sell something like this to players. /s
---
Maybe the OP's system or connection is the issue?
---
How that is on BGS is beyond me 
---
The PC Master race is notorious for "It can't be my system....I just did x, y, z to it and it can run *insert other game here* just fine on the highest settings/ I put x amount of dollars into it"
---
I despise the "recent" list. When i get invited by a random person, to group up, i have to scroll excessively to find the invite to accept it.
---
Here you go

---
Most every tire is steel belted radial, so it might actually be a half decent armor against melee attacks and light pistol rounds like .38.
---
Luckily I have mine set to 30 minutes
---
That’s some odd gatekeeping.
---
I've gotten the same type of rewards with 1 brahmin and all 3 brahmin surviving. I've gotten a 1star weapon/armor from each one, no loot change.
---
Pffft. Online games often have persistent bugs for long periods ... Or other bugs get introduced.
---
This is hardly specific to BGS
---
The main draw is to "show off" stuff you've got, so they've been talking weapon racks, power armor display (like from Fallout 4), and just general decoration in your CAMP. Folks are also asking for mannequins to show of player armor, but I don't know if that'll make it in.
---
I see, so their is a cap on how low it will go. Same thing when selling. I believe cap is 500 caps per serum. Some other guy mentioned having 30 charisma vs me at 15 and we both sell at 500 to vendor.
---
Hey I'm exactly the same, can't live without em haha
---
When it comes to protecting the Brahmin, I’ll one shot all I like. Tired of seeing poor Daisy keel over from y’all mobbing the Sheepsquatch
---
Pa is pretty weak without the right build. And I can’t help ya with that but I can tell you the key to pvp is being sneaky, as long as you’re not detected you can’t be vats’d on. I’d recommend some sort of rifle, explosive if you can. Also I’d recommend training up your lower level and specialize into a rifle build.
---
OK, I'm not a lawyer, so thanks for clarifying I guess. My overall point is still valid though, that a violation of TOS is not necessarily a violation of the law.
---
he’s hilarious and informative. Many weapons he tested aren’t three-star-explosive $&amp;@, but are items not that hard to find, he shows you how to get the most out of them.
---
Fair enough. I keep having to farm them because I use my power armor.
---
I was running around places for a few days and then settled on server jumping all morning and he finally showed up at the water park!
---
You want to access your friends inventory? You will need their login, because you can't.
---
I don’t think you can as that’s the stash
---
You cant see his stuff sry :/
---
I don't have any of these problems.....
---
So it's not broken?
---
The Drifter outfit is also pretty wasteland-chic, and it's backpack free.
---
I would double check, i know that there different limitations even between xbox and ps4, but i’ve found multiple “craft/build anywhere” mods on xbox, you definitely need to find a good one, but theyre out there.
---
What the actual bs is this? I have mysterious savior max and it maybe proc few times but not all the times in a row.......... Wish you could get unyielding with life saving together to test it out.
---
Aye I have a quad explosive pump for myself but the two shot is level 15. Thought I could help someone out by dropping it for them if the damage is actually 25% more. Probably something they could use so I’ll keep it for now, thanks.
---
Exactly. I mean if under armors were released NOW instead of release, how every PA user would feel that they will be excluded from this part of content?
---
Do you have any weapons/armor for trade?
---
I like your enthusiasm!
---
Chameleon stacks why doesn't life saving?
---
You cannot. If you build in a friend's camp you are using your own materials and cannot access their stored items
---
Nice! I wasn’t able to get any proof of mine disappearing. I’m not too worried about it though I don’t even care if I get the weapon back I just want bgs to fix this so I can play the game again, and a permanent fix not some shitty patch that breaks again the next update afterwards.
---
I have a 2 shot gauss, other than that, no
---
I mean ... It's pretty on par with any dungeon from other BGS games.... It's pretty much exactly what I was expecting
---
Thank you very much for your reply. If it's around same DMG as All Rise, then I agree with you - totally wort switching, because looks awesomore =)
---
I did get a mod from having 2 survive, so it’s definitely RNG based on how many survive.
---
To each their own I guess
---
I feel ya man. I must have server hopped 30+ times at Point Pleasant without any luck. Figured it would be easiest to keep trying the same spot. Got frustrated and fast traveled to the Cemetery and there it was.
---
Most TOS issues are not violations of law, it's just the ones where you misuse a computer or engage in some type of fraud/harassment.
---
Even then the cost/time to litigate is so prohibitive, [let alone a PR nightmare](https://www.engadget.com/2017/11/27/epic-battle-royale-cheating-lawsuit/),  that most companies just go with the ban option.
---
Wait...bunk beds monkaS
---
You mean skipping merrily along the cobblestone road everywhere? That was fun in some weird way.
---
What if I told you that you could use your camera and wave goodbye to the map borders.
---
Marsupial, Speed Demon, Carnivore for most builds. Adrenal Reaction for low-life builds. Eagle Eyes For Crit Vats builds. Twisted Muscles for Melee builds.
---
PS4
---
Yeah who knows. I was just looking forward to having some misc items to make my camp look more "used" and lived in.
---
Brahmin effected by friendly fire? I couldn't tell if I was hurting them with my gun or not the one time I did the event yesterday.
---
I see all good then
---
Cool, I'll take it, but we are square on the shocks as far as I'm concerned.  You don't owe me any extra.  I usually have enough stored up, but I went through so much ammo because we have nuked fissure prime around 9 times this week and had one with 2 Queens at once in it and I burned through 13,000 + rounds of ammo.
---
I still haven’t found it
---
Does this really work!? Can you walk around out of the border?
---
Every armor is squishy when hit with the right weapon.  I really don't see how power armor is any worse in PVP compared to most armors in the game. 
---
Don't  start with the   sentinel and cavalier assassins crap.  Those are two armors out of many, armors which 90 percent of PVP players you encounter don't have a full set of. 
---
Is power armor worse than a full set of non-legendary level 50 combat armor? This is the part where someone talks about Dense mod.
---
Okay. News flash: dense mod doesn't grow on trees.   I am level 250 and I only just now found Dense mod plans and it was for robot armor.  The dense mod is armor specific.  If you have a great set of legendary combat armor but your dense mod plans are for raider armor, then you are shit out of luck. 
---
Power armor is loud?  I've never been in a situation where anyone could hear power armor over the sounds of grenades and gunfire.
---
Amen
---
lmao
---
I havent played the sheepsquatch patch yet, but I think I just found what I want to spend my atoms on, that thing is so freaking adorable!
---
I tried. Ime it puts you in a loading screen and places you back inside the borders.
---
My friend attempted this and ended up on a endless loading screen.
---
You mean pretty much every online game with loot ever made?
---
Do the perks improve the spread any?
---
oh I have a sick one for ya. theres two carts under a power line tower in the mire with an underground home you can build up above and keep the bottom level. it's like sw of the dam. when I get home from work I'll try to remember to send a location
---
you should have a headset anyway to talk to people, you are playing a multiplayer game
---
You’re a bigger target, less able to sneak and it is significantly louder if you are trying to sneak up on someone. I play with a headset as I’m always in a party and I can always hear people around me. More so when they are in PA
---
In beta a lot of talk was wanting to claim one of the radio towers in game that you could tune in to on the pipbot.
---
If you are willing to put the walkways and stairs outside, you can make a tower nearly identical to the lookout towers (aside from the stairs and walkways being outside)
---
Juicehead? 
---
Is that you? 
---
With that kind of wild speculation based on zero facts and the existence of contradictory evidence.... I assume so
---
I just moved my camp here yesterday! Walked all the way from Grafton down the tracks looking for an open train.
---
Thanks for the suggestion. I think I might have one of those in my stash...not sure if I sold it or not.
---
The first clip looks like the ant was in the process of becoming a legendary but you killed it prior to the completion. When you come around the corner you can see that typical legendary transformation start but I'm guessing because you killed it before it finished it never fully became one long enough to actually spawn in a item. I will say as I did see you using explosives a lot, so you do have a chance to actually blast away the legendary item. As what I have been seeing happen a lot is the item spawns outside the world somewhere and then teleports into the enemies inventory. This can lead to a few things. The first is the item spawns in the world and your explosions blow it away and thus it never enters the inventory. The second is like you loot the item on the ground or in the area prior to it going into the enemies inventory. The third option is the item spawns in and stays where it is at. Thus making you have to do a scavenger hunt to find it. The fourth option is the item spawns in and it goes to the inventory which we all wish would be the only thing to happen.
---
I found him in the mire randomly.
---
IMO you’re better off naked with the chameleon mutation than in PA
---
If you forgot where you were, yeah, you can start over, but it's not really necessary. :) It can be overwhelming to check out all of the build talk on here, and think you're doing it all wrong, but honestly, 76 (and the modern Fallout games) have always been flexible enough to beat with even a suboptimal build, at least for me. 
---
I'd also recommend trying to sneak back in this weekend, if you can - It is Double XP.
---
Are you standing or crouched? If you are standing anyone can see you on the radar as either a yellow dot(your gun is put away) or red dot (your gun is out on survival) doesn't matter if your cloaked as people will be able to pinpoint where you are. If you don't want to be seen, crouch in a bush
---
This is fantastic mate, thanks for all the work you have put in to make it. I will be using it often.
---
I carry around a tesla rifle all the time. It doesn't do much dmg and tags multiple mobs at once. I always switch to that when other players are around.
---
I've noticed in VATS that a enemy can be right in front of you and it will show a 0% chance of hitting him. Now that you mention it, it's been happening more often.
---
So it must be a melee bug. It’s very annoying
---
It would be more of a roleplaying experience to say something like "You are leaving West Virginia and you feel compeled to stick to your roots and not give up and walk away" or something smarter than that but basically the same.
---
What? Is this true? Have i been wasting 5 perk points for all this time?
---
What's your offer or trade?
---
If you're referring to dodgy, you can spam halloween candy to keep your AP up through hits. If you tried out hacks for yourself and they work, I'd put in a ticket to BGS.
---
I have a patched three piece suit that I keep in my stash for formal wear challenges.  Tweed at Bespoke Tailors in the Whitespring Hotel sells various formal wear if you need something in a hurry.
---
Also, a police uniform works for responder gear challenges (one can be found in Monongah Police Station or the second floor of a blown up building on the west end of Harper's Ferry, near the chem bench.  Just watch out for the scale trap at the foot of the stairs.)  I believe Pastor's Vestments also work, but can't confirm it.
---
Hate to break it to both of you but it most certainly will not be free placement of junk items, you’ll be able to put junk in display cases or on shelves but that’s it
---
I had an Alpha Deathclaw disappear on me while I was looking at his loot window, but before I could grab anything.
---
The next day I was sneaking past a SB fissure near (not at, but near) where I had killed that deathclaw and found a dead Alpha Deathclaw that I could loot. No way of knowing if it could've been the same one or not. This was a separate IRL day, been logged off for the night in between.
---
Hey, I've got a glitch I found that might interest you. Use the blue vault tec bed (I think it's the only one that works) in the tables section look for the thing that looks like a stool, it's in between a bedside cabinet and a dresser. Place your plush on the stool and then move the stool inside the bed. The stool will not be visible as it is the perfect height. Let me know if you need help. 
---
https://gamerdvr.com/gamer/destroyerjack/screenshot/11972212
---
Yea but I saw somewhere that these aren't the final borders... there is more but prob wont be for awhile but one day... that's why they are those fences and not a giant rock you cant get up and over
---
So i would like to ask for clarity here. This is situation that happened to me:
---
Claimed workshop.
---
Defended WS once against PVE.
---
The defend quest popped again, an hour later, but i ignored it.
---
I am in my camp, my head gets exploded by random dude.
---
While i am dead trying to figure wtf happened, it asked if i wanted retribution, i clicked yes because the dude was 10 levels lower than me.
---
Respawn, attack him, (He should have all limbs crippled due shotgun perks) but he drops me as soon as he turns around.
---
While dead, at my camp, something about the workshop defend quest says i failed.
---
Got annoyed and logged off.
---
\*\*all of this was in adventure mode. NOT survival\*\*
---
Shouldnt have this guy been vulnerable to PVP as soon i clicked on 'seek revenge'???
---
When attacked at your camp or somewhere other than your claimed workshop, if you lose it to PVP does it tell you, you have failed???
---
I guess I just want to understand this glitch. I still like taking workshops for the easy XP, fusion cores, and well placed fast travel points, as needed.
---
Hell, a canyon at the edge of the map, a rock wall... something.
---
At least have it *at the edge of the map*, and not an in-game km away from it.
---
I server hopped at Fred's BBQ and it started on my second try.
---
I’m hoping they include bathtubs as a “display case”. But I know about that
---
What about those pinball machines we find in the burrow?
---
&gt;the person making these dailies needs to not be the person making the dailies
---
Cinsidering the amount of screw ups the last few weeks, this is what I would go with
---
It’s seriously not worth the 2000 cap cost for a 45/55 chance of completing it because people fuck around
---
I haven't updated the list in awhile. When I do, I will post an update message. But I do know that all the currently available mounted head plans as quest rewards, so once per character. Most can be obtained through the four side-quests obtained through the taxidermy shop.
---
Its a large tree in some shallow water with a ramp system that goes all the way up into the upper branches with a few platforms along the way and at the top is an open air treehouse.
---
 I moved because i put my c.a.m.p. at the top and the water was to far down to put a purifier  and there was usually a couple fog crawlers to deal with every time i went home.
---
Ohhhh. Well, that makes sense. But... a giant dynamite blast that destroys a rock wall would be a cooler way to do things.
---
Then do Free Range, much more fun and free
---
&gt; Time is money. It's not about showing off, it's about playing efficiently.
---
This right here. Like you said, I'll gladly let everyone tag a legendary before I kill it, but everything else is getting oneshot. The faster I finish this event, the faster I get to the next one.  Waiting for someone to meander over and lazily plink away with a pipe rifle at a horde of ghouls is actively costing me caps, XP, scrap, ammo and loot.
---
is he not? I triggered the event and when sheepsquatch showed up it was only me and a melee deathclaw build and the cows died just to the sheeps AOE near instantly failing the event for us. 
---
He's at least 3-5 times the HP of a Glowing/Scorched Crown Gulper since i'd just been crippling those earlier and he died before being crippled.
---
This really bummed me out once people started to realize free range = sheepsquatch. It would spawn only to die in 10 seconds from god tier weapons. My first 3 times running the event with like 4 people it was nice actually having to battle the thing for a few minutes.
---
This is the absolute worst way to start a quest. Good luck man.
---
Sorry, was just an obsevation.
---
Some of the things I use successfully are; 
---
Keep a supply of berry mentats to out stealthers, they work through walls, so are better than the PA helmet mod. 
---
Stock up on cryogenic and pumpkin grenades. Cryo grenades effect action points, and stop regeneration. Pumpkin grenades give rads, and a short +dmg taken debuff, they're good vs sentinal armor and low health builds.
---
Berry mentats let you see where players are in short/mid range, so you can toss a grenade at them before sprinting at them for melee. I've killed a lot of people when they panic as the grenade lands in front of them. Their first reaction is to jump up and run away, which breaks stealth and sentinal.
---
yeah just did a post on reddit and i guess no one gives a shit about the game anymore lol
---
A tip - keep a tesla rifle on your for this purpose. You can shoot the player and it will bounce off of them and onto the mobs. Tesla Coils on power armor also do wonders.
---
Where do you see this? I'm on Xbox and the challenges for today aren't that
---
Nice map...how mobile friendly is it?
---
By finding a body at a random event location near tourist spots.
---
Bethesda really needs to find better ways to implement the new questlines they add. It's horribly immersion breaking when I have to go online to find out how to start the quest.
---
Yeah I like it, it's better than whitesprings, the ghouls are consistently higher level and I usually get several legendaries from a run.
---
I've seen that but it's also missing even when I have 95-100% when I'm right on top of creatures.
---
i have about 1,200 caps on 1 character and 520 on another and unfortunately i dont have any 2 star legendaries to offer
---
The post subject sounds like an awesome movie title
---
Oh I’m in power armor 90% of the time, I’m a HW build so yeah, it’s required. But I don’t use jet packs in combat, I rarely use VATS (typically only for radants and other short shit), I am not melee so I don’t power attack, and I don’t sprint in combat. So my general core usage is just the baseline drain, which is pretty low. VATS/power attacks/jet packs burn cores really fast.
---
Have no buds. Some of these recipes I don't even know where  to get. I didn't realize there were so many exp buffs available. Thank you for the list.
---
Nowhere near the false sheepsquatch toughness. If a player was expecting that, they could easily pop in the first time blazing away with the best they have.
---
Would you equip a low level weapon and de-power your perks to do the false one? I sure as hell would not.
---
If you’re PS4 I can make you one.
---
Ty.
---
They do but I believe it's one roll after the other. If you have life saving legendary and mysterious stranger, you roll life saving 50%, if it fails then you roll stranger 50%. It also has a long timer so you can't use it indefinitely.
---
My point was if someone is using it they get downed, then get up again. Some people drop to 1% hp and never get downed and are unkillable. Either to a glitch, hacks, whatever the case.
---
\&gt;  and are a bit paranoid of getting rid of stuff they MAY 
---
\&gt; need/want later on. 
---
And this is why so many of us roam around over-encumbered :)
---
Was the first thing I tried with the camera gltich. I just get an error message, a loading screen, and it puts me back to the nearest FT point from where I started.
---
although i dont know how much faith i have in you as a xbox peasant
---
Yes it’s noted with an event icon. I’m not sure if it does a notification like with Encryptid or Scorched Earth
---
I see. So it would be hard to pinpoint which of the 20 concept art backpacks from the article who made it into the game. Thanks anyway
---
Diseased?
---
not xbox by choice, xbox by being poor
---
Wasn’t really a joke but didn’t require the asshole reply you got
---
Fucking agree
---
Seriously this is my most wanted feature. I want to make a nice cosy tower like in firewatch.
---
Leaving server, had a few takers
---
The treasure maps don't work well on Mobile (and sometimes desktop), one of the things I'm going to play with sometime.
---
Otherwise, I'll use it on one of my mobile devices while I'm playing sometimes, so seems to work decently for me
---
the fact that players never had that option in the past they are not missing out by it not being in fallout 76, where as fusion cores are PA were both in fallout 4 and are now weaker in fallout 76, thats something the players are going to notice. when 76 first launched fusion core drain was in line with that of fallout 4 but was nurfed along with the robobrains at dyer chemical no longer dropping fusion cores to make harder to get them.
---
Need another one for 2+ level 100+ characters
---
Thank you! And I will! When we entire entrance, stage, ring, and seating is all taken care of I will do that! Thanks for that tip!
---
I think, no matter, what they put in, the game, people will, still use a bunch of commas.
---
So that link of the guy always getting revived by the mysterious savior above is basically glitch/hack?
---
The fight card is full, but I'll happily take your PSN as a backup if someone doesn't show!
---
He admits to *formerly* being a homophobe. He admits talking to people changed his mind.
---
From datamining I believe there are 3 loot tiers (depending on how many Brahmin survive). Keep more alive and get better stuff (plans, repair kits, etc.)
---
Could have been a kid who’s still trying to figure out social interactions with strangers, it’s hard to say!
---
I did the event for the first time this morning with two other players.  We had two lvl 80 sheepsquatch and maybe a dozen glowing bloodbugs.  All three of us were in the lvl 200 range with high end guns, and I had all I could handle even with 23 Per, 25 AG, Gun Fu and an AA/E handmade.  A sheepsquatch and at least 3-4 glowing bloodbugs were ganged up on Earl and despite my best efforts I couldn't save him.  If I could risk myself, run in and give him a stimpak, I surely would have.  The other two players were making an awful lot of noise, chunks of bloodbugs were flying everywhere, so it seemed like they were pretty busy, too.
---
Seems cool so far.
---
As far as I know it's permanent, no timer on it or anything, but I've been wrong before
---
What are all the plans that the free range event drops??
---
Sorry man but we aren't even in the same stratosphere
---
and btw, i hope you have made a correction for the "time" before the next week challenges : 4294949284 days...
---
Why was he playing as you while he has his own character? Given all the recent issues on losing weapons and armor pieces I wouldn’t let others play my account...
---
At the very least needs a couple of weeks off.
---
Level 81? I'm seriously checking all sheepsquatch related posts I can find because every one I've seen in game was a Legendary Level 80 one star (and the three I killed all gave out one-star melee weapons)...another post has people claiming to have killed them up to 3 stars, but every description/screenshot I've seen so far has been of a Legendary level 80. I'm genuinely curious if there's any real variation in them.
---
I have the survivalist outfit, it looks amazing to me. The mask is separate and looks too goofy for my taste, the hat has a giant poofball on top. I rock the Hunter's hat flaps up with the outfit instead.
---
Well yea not fake sheepsquatch but mine was insanely tough. 
---
I used a +Limb Damage Executioners Western Revolver with Concentrated Fire Perk to see how much limb damage he took from it and oof. 
---
When something gets hit by a mod'd Deathclaw gauntlet and it's HP doesn't drop it's p tough in my book, maybe mine was just super tough
---
It was a hell of a lot tougher than a level 90 Yao
---
&gt;Would you equip a low level weapon and de-power your perks to do the false one? I sure as hell would not.
---
I've only done the event once and it failed because literally as soon as it spawned it one hit all 3 cows, that's why i'm asking
---
I just got it from the event location in the forest
---
do camp griefers get lit up by turrets? my camp is in whitespring so I never know if it’s griefers or scorchbeasts that leveled my camp
---
It's pretty common to find at the Pleasant Valley Station, on a concrete pad to the left of where you fast travel in, or at Live Chic in the Whitespring Hotel.  The explorer's outfit is decent too.
---
There is very little about survival mode that makes me want to log in and play though.  I tried it for a little while but it's just not my cup of tea. Far too many things I don't like about it that outweigh the few things I do like about it.
---
 For now I'm stuck on adventure mode. It may be overly safe and boring but at least it doesn't make me feel like I'm playing an arcade game.
---
Tbf there's no difference between two level 60-70 and two level 500
---
Congrats on the kid! The parent life rocks.
---
Anyway, I would say it is worth picking up again, but only you will know for sure by trying it again.
---
I always choose the option to find another world, and I've never had my camp disappear.
---
And what level is your character? How many hrs have you played? Am I to understand you don't mind spending 60.00 on a game where you have to help the dev's fix the game? You don't mind playing 5hrs and have to repeat 1+hrs to get back what u lost?
---
They exist for PS4, but are quite buggy.
---
Not wasted... Unequip and equip the perk card back. Also, it's not happening all the time.
---
2 modes Adventure and Survival. Adventure if someone shoots you, you can choose to ignore and will not receive damage unless you return fire. Survival = deathmatch!
---
That being said, don't be afraid of high level players (Adventure mode mostly). They typically see new low lvls and toss them freebies (gear, supplies etc). They will walk up to you and drop paper bags of loot on floor, sometimes they will shoot at it to get your attention, which tends to spook some new comers.
---
*looks over map*
---
Ehhh, this is nice I guess...
---
*discovers Treasure Map feature*
---
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!
---
Not since they added spawn immunity and I’m in survival 90% of the time I spawn in and run without a weapon out.
---
Yes and weird thing also some protections with tracks instead of feet. This all happened in harpers ferry after the burrows came out.
---
It's an improvement over a plain version.  I'm sure someone will love it.
---
Lmaoooo chill!!!! 😂
---
Just put clothes over I guess :/
---
120 I think 250 hours on the game 
---
Also I was being pissy earlier so I apologize
---
Oh god as if the perk system isn't annoying already
---
it is pretty good, solo or in a group. It is bad with 30 people crammed in there like opening day.
---
Should have been instanced.
---
Yeah, all I can tell is that the Atom shop has Black, Green, Medic, NukaCola, and Quantum skins.
---
From the texture files included, it looks like there's only one in game so far, so I don't think there is anything to extract yet. I presume they're still being modeled as of the last update.
---
I didnt feel like writing mountains... haha or endless water
---
Yeah I think a few have popped up about the video. I think the guy from parks and rec is in the video too.
---
That's Nice, it's honestly so chill how most of the community seems to be, I'm honestly hella hyped I wanted to pick it up at release but my wallet too me to wait a little. I'm hyped to dive in and hopefully meet some fellow survivors
---
They drop often enough. I was able to get three plans yesterday from doing it twice. Just my .02$
---
me - Baronik is my IGN, we can share it - first you'll make me the pickture and then we switch.
---
we find the fusion cores in the ruins of the old world not in the vaults, most of the vaults were test vaults and were designed to fail within a few years, the only people who could improve the fusion core design are the institute from fallout 4 but that would not explain how they ended up all over the wastleland. the cores we pull out of the fusion generators around the world are powering pre-war buildings and machines
---
I saw one on the small vendor next to the crafting area in WS for 29 caps. Don't know if it's a spawn or just chance, it's under the junk tab as usual.
---
Some recipes for food and some plans for sheepsquatch related Melee/Throwing weapons.
---
you aren't remotely objective. you're a critic, so right off the bat you have to understand everything you say is objective and its fucking delusional to claim otherwise as you spew hundreds of hours of hot air. Learn what words mean.
---
Possibly, he had mysterious savior proc 3 times and people report that card procs about 20% of the time. Seems unlikely that he would get picked up 3 times in a row.
---
The life saving armor legendary states in description it can only proc once per every minute and when it does the savior does not appear.
---
I can't be 💯 sure mysterious stranger has a timer but I figure it does have same timer as the mod.
---
At any rate looks super sketchy.
---
Low level weapons have short durability bars. So they break faster between repairs. If you're not using PA yet, you must be really low level. Shotguns, as mentioned above, also aren't very durable to begin with...
---
What I mean is it isn't allowed to be taken out of your character or stash, so you won't be able to put it in your camp.
---
Yea mine wasnt at a "event"... it was at one of the random spawn points... anything can be there
---
whatever makes you money I guess
---
Lol. I enjoyed the effort though.
---
I neglected to include. My computer and my sons are built by me. Exactly the same. He doesn't have these problems. When we play together. I have almost no prob's. He has none.
---
Good point! I have 15mb connection. He has 100mb...
---
Server I was on someone triggered it right after an SBQ fight. Some poor sucker manned a pylon and got offed...dropping all his stable flux from the queen. I stood there over the bag for the remainder of the event hoping no one without the "Retrieve your Loot" icon would notice it, but the guy must have disconnected because no one came back to claim it.
---
They will sometimes get you to tag along so you can level up with some quick xp. Take you somewhere full of enemies. Even if enemy is to powerful and your bullets don't do much, all you need to gain xp is to shoot them at least once. Then the higher lvl can wipe the floor with them.
---
And doesn't mention a thing about the main issue with his abuse of the report system.
---
Haven't tested it, but this was my first thought for top bunk placement too.
---
I see people suggest this all the time and it always baffles me. The Fusion Generator is purchasable from the Enclave vendor, the Power Plant event is unnecessary
---
Especially with this new Sheepsquatch lege. It's supposed to be dangerous as lvl 80 boss Lege, but people are killing them under 5 seconds in groups.
---
Couple of times barely had time tag them myself as I was safeguarding the moo moo's, as that is what the event is about.
---
Also, almost failed one event as everyone had tunnel vision with the 3\* lege boss and no one but me was trying to keep the moo moo's alive.
---
No! But good point. Try it tonight...
---
While being Level 65, my weapons fucking suck; think there is a wider conspiracy to keep legendary weapons from my character. I am of the 15-shot variety when it comes to high level creatures, so don't need to worry about me.  So yeah, what OP said in the title.
---
Awesome 👍
---
Just keep doing it and eventually you’ll get it, I’m in the same boat
---
Hey, will we be able to wear backpacks under hazmat suits as well as PA?
---
Sure. But I was speaking more to what they already have built in code-wise so it's easier to implement. I don't recall any instances in the game where you have a UI interaction similar to that. So they'd have to create that from scratch. But I agree, a 3-tap would probably work well and not be too hard to create.
---
So the horned shepherds crook is common? just makin sure so I dont use something worth like 200k
---
&gt;  Don't know how I feel about that. 
---
Ditto. On the one hand, I don't have to worry about it clashing with my Fire Breather *~~a e s t h e t i c~~* outfit... But on the other hand, I was kinda looking forward to finally having some way to customise it.
---
If you could add random encounters to this map too, I would be using it all the time.
---
But otherwise, great work. And the treasure map feature is also gonna be useful.
---
I see it as a normal human with a 5 or so strength it would be a massive boost. But "today's" human that has mutated to allow twice and more the strength of even the strongest pre-war human, it is not a boost for many. Since they were designed before the war, they are a massive boost to strength.
---
I make Union Hats, bundle glass, oil, and acid. I spend about an hour playing, and then an hour cycling characters to get caps. Then I purge them all into one account via my wife's PS4 by selling the same .308 bullet back and forth.
---
That plush is what finally made me purchase atoms. I put him close to my Brahmin so she can have a pal.
---
Was trying to take a photo of a sheepsquatch last night. It hit me and knocked my character from Beckley to the farm on the map below it. Died from fall dmg
---
So the dailies are different for each platform? On Xbox this isn't a challenge
---
This is why I don't shoot at the bag, because it can be misunderstood as provocation. I'm level 108 and if I see anyone at a low level in the starting area &amp; I've some spare stuff, I'll turn up, drop a bunch of ammo, plans etc, do a wave and thumbs up, then head off. If they grab it, they grab it. If they don't, they don't. It's not like that stuff can be sold at vendors anyway.
---
I'll also drop stuff that can't be sold in containers at train stations, usually one near the crafting station or bot - they're always worth checking, a fair few players use them as they seem to last longer than bags.
---
I just got it, but I’ll help you get it.
---
So .if you shoot a Tesla ,all the other players have a tag on the enemy? Is that what you mean ?
---
I think you marked all the vendors green, which is very nice. But does the crashed air plane have a vendor?
---
What's worse is people with explosive weapons that aoe the cows into the dirt
---
I'll come join if that's ok - IGN: Demorgoth
---
what's your ign?
---
I would have bought the Nuka girl suit but I didn't want the metal neck ring when you don't have the helmet. It was a very popular mod in Fallout 4 and there's even a mod for it on PC. Strange that they didn't change it.
---
Commuting with my friendly neighborhood wise mothman sounds like a dream come true 😍
---
Map is 4x larger than previous.
---
Useable area... about the same.
---
but muh bluuuudud ixplusiv so strung i shud shuw iviriune huw cul i m
---
I couldn't kill them and I tried. 😂
---
looks normal to me ... are you sure the last update didnt FIX your game instead of breaking it?
---
Not entirely. Two of us in gas masks, leaded armor, and underarmor both with rad-sponge do very well in the nuke zones. Even one with shared rad-sponge level1 keeps up OK. About like having excavator armor and no rad sponge. And with ghoulish, health is never an issue.
---
I wish there was a solo option that worked at about this level though.
---
It got crazy quick, didn't it?  First time i logged on after that patch, I saw the event pop and joined, not knowing what to expect.  Got there, didn't know what the hell I was doing, died multiple time, bots and ghouls everywhere.   Eventually got the pylon thing.  We failed, but it was GLORIOUS!
---
LOL
---
God, yes.  THIS!  Please.  All you melee mofos who think it’s cute to block the doorway to the clubhouse and one hit every ghoul that comes out AFTER I LAUNCHED THE FUCKING NUKE.  Sorry.  I get pissed off when this happens.  Use a weaker weapon.  Drop some of your cards.  Get a hit or two then move on.  Leave some for the rest of us.  I have a bad ass ghoul slayer gatty that along with my cards allows me to kill glowing ghouls in 2 or 3 hits.  I hit switch to something different to give others a chance when we are all grinding for legendary items.  Please, kids.  Show a little courtesy.
---
Sit next to him on the train.
---
No I used a super sledge, Tesla rifle, ski sword, pipe revolver, and an smg. I dealt roughly 25% of the damage to it
---
I've seen some people moaning about how they are useless when you can just go back to camp but I've made good use of them twice already.
---
A multilevel environment.
---
I think it's fine, not hating on it.  Haven't tried it nuked yet either which might be cool.  The endgame was a little underwhelming however (one assaultron?)
---
I want my 3* backpack!
---
Lol thank you!
---
Lol the mutants handmade?
---
Yes that’s what I sometimes do too.
---
The story did seem a bit jumpy, I thought the actual location was really cool, and the one time I ran through it I nabbed atleast three 3* enemies, I feel like they kinda rushed the history of the place though which is a bummer
---
Yep haha
---
Nothing is worth that much, whole damn economy is messed up, but that is besides the point. I got the regular crook, a club, and a pie recipe. I can't confirm for you if it is super rare and will arbitrarily be super valuable, again just sharing that plans dropped often yesterday.
---
You on ps4?
---
I am starting to think TSE weapons need to be removed as its killing the game i will walk over do oh every thing is dead. I will go kill SBQ oh wait she is all ready dead 3 seconds in.
---
Not to raise expectations but I think the Arktos Pharma dungeon is much more in line with that original idea
---
I absolutely agree those are the laziest folks who do that
---
I'm totally willing to add them, will need to find a list somewhere.
---
Was debating adding a Camera location layer as well
---
yeah what level and how many stars
---
That is brilliant
---
Everything you describe sounds like a connection problem to me. Is there anything you can do to improve that, like a wire instead of WiFi?
---
Fun idea, worth exploring at least
---
Same as reddit
---
Hmm? If it's character. Why wouldn't the 3 diagnostic reports from ms,bethesda,dx show anything? They ask for them every time I ask for help. I have to generate them or search for them in the system... Sorry if I'm pissy. But I have never had soo much trouble with a single game. I've never had to work so hard just to play, when it wasn't my fault.
---
It’s so easy to share with others in this game, just pull out your non explosive shotty or tesla and shoot at the ghoul crowed, you’re guaranteed to the loots in most of the ghouls. It’s actually less work than trying to kill them all by oneself. Did exactly this last night and picked up a three star FE 10mm sub machinegun from one of the random ghouls I hit. It was like 8 people outside WS clubhouse, everyone did the same using a tesla or pump, I’m sure they landed some loots as well since people were thumbing up frequently.
---
Would have required them to split up the backpack from the original outfit and then make it hide that part of it specifically when you put on the backpack, probably more work than it's worth.
---
Im at the shrine if you can find it
---
I agree with that. Not everyone is going to care about what our overseer wants to accomplish though.
---
lmao..
---
Actually i’ve been paying attention to that as well and as far as I can tell the explosions do not damage the Brahmin. I dont think any players can hurt them.
---
Two places I've seen them is the random encounter location next to the power station just north of Watoga (once - seemed tied to the herder event), and the rest stop between Ripper Alley and Huntersville where the monster brawls take place. Every time I went through there yesterday, a sheepsquatch broke up the party and killed both sides in the brawl.
---
Max level 2 stars, I believe + vats hit chance
---
It's not for legendaries.
---
You guys STILL only do the event to loot the legendary enemy?
---
Jesus christ.
---
That's hilarious. Locking onto the squirrel instead of the player got them killed.
---
The Enclave doesn't sell all of the generators, so if you want all of them, this is the way to do it.   And there are definite benefits to having the smaller generators as options, especially if you enjoy workshops.
---
Plus, it is easier for a low-level character to do the Poseidon repair quest multiple times than to do the quest string necessary to get into the Enclave bunker.  For a lot of people, regardless of level, it is also a lot faster to just server-hop Poseidon than to deal with Enclave quests.
---
I’v had a 3* just early. They spawn randomly. Also this weekend is well worthed to farm the event only for XP itself
---
I'm guessing they worked from the base of the Creation Club backpacks available in Fo4, so I'd assume that most of the paints/colors are the same.  I don't remember a Quantum paint in 4.  I really hope they aimed for better than a C grade with the backpack system and don't just regurgitate the Creation Club version with a couple extra colors and styles.  I don't mean to sound negative, only that this could potentially be a huge win for them at a time that they could really use a home run to appease the disgruntled masses.  I think the player base is really expecting a lot from Ever Upwards and the legendary vendor, so I hope they crossed all their t's and dotted their i's.
---
It can cause crashes so be careful
---
It happens to enough people that it's posted about at least twice a week, and comments say "yeah same" so... sorry, Mr. Exception.
---
Thx..I'm buying a lot of items today..I love handmades I will let u kno
---
Yeah true a core in a generator has a continuous life cycle until it's taken out by us for PA etc and then begins degenerating. My first post was just an opinion that I'd formed to be able to disregard some of 76s failings regarding lores that have been warped or twisted by the latest installment
---
 "Ultimately, ultimately who gives a fuck anyway." Frank Zappa ;)
---
(1) Actual BETA testing was a shit show. I personally know 7 people who cancelled their pre-order based on that experience alone. Not only was it 98% unplayable, it was only online for specific hours of the day for the most part.  
---
(2) The base/core game is far from even playable at a reliable rate. People are now playing in fear of losing progress/weapons/armor/etc.. because of bugs that they specifically said they aren't going to do anything about returning that progress/the items.  
---
I could literally sit here and list millions of problems, but others have already done that on the sub-reddit for me.
---
Awesome, cheers!
---
I have to take a photo of player whit dress but whit 200mm lens
---
Am on PS4.  If you're not offended by stupid humor or foul language, you're welcome to join us and we'll set you up with some decent low level gear and help out with missions and whatnot.  PSN Neojinnx.
---
There are a few missions you should wait until level 50 to do that give unique quest rewards.  If you do them earlier, they will not be max level.
---
Yeah, I totally forget how to get into the mainframe room and it is driving me mad! I've been running around for 15 minutes!
---
No, it's just for you. If a dude in power armor is in front of you blocking your shots so you can't tag, shoot him with a tesla rifle and the shot will arc off of him to nearby enemies, which allows you to tag them.
---
coming to you, wait for me please :)
---
Oh shit, that's a good rhythm you have going. How do you sustain the materials, then?
---
Still here
---
This is amazing - great job!
---
I dont believe they are
---
Toss the teammate in for area damage?
---
If you finish the quest you would know that's how you get lenses...
---
The reason here is that there's nothing you can do to speed up the event, and it doesn't hurt anything to take a long time and be inefficient.
---
Thank you got the tip..... I love this community...
---
Everytime i see other players at events my first thought is 'alrite lets see if theyre one of those players'. I usually take off some damage perks or switch to a weaker weapon if i have one to just tag so we all get a piece of the pie, but some players have no ediquette or just dont give af, at which point neither do I
---
Yikes thats rough. It can definitely be challenging. Was this the Mire version of the event?
---
Agreed and updoot.    
---
When I hear "Dungeon", I'm expecting a few things:   
---
Like you say, a quest to get there.  This would have been a great time to pop up a radio station that when you listen to it, it gives you the quest. An SOS signal that when you listen to it, directs you where to go.
---
Because I'm spoiled by today's other MMO's, I'm expecting an instanced dungeon. When i step in, I shouldn't see dead things and be able to walk beginning to end seeing nothing but meat piles and a dead robot (my first experience).
---
And finally, a challenge.  My 2h Power Armor character is only level 66, has no mods on my lvl 50 excavator armor.  I use a lvl 50 suppressor supersledge. (can you tell I don't farm legendaries?)  When I went in my second time, I got the fresh experience.  I didn't even have to use a stimpack until the final boss.  Fight-wise it was boring.  Dungeon bosses should have neat mechanics or different traps.
---
Thanks, I appreciate your reply!
---
I know this post will be down-voted by the very active FC members I'm talking about, the ones who basically have extremist views. But I think it was still worth writing. Hopefully the more reasonable-minded people can steer the group in the right direction-- I had a conversation (not even a debate really) with someone the other day who had opposing views on monetization, and it was a good conversation we were both thankful for at the end of the day. So FC is capable of that kind of thing.
---
And it needs to happen more often. Being completely ignored or written off isn't good, nor is patting each other on the back and creating an echo chamber. :-p
---
Well, you kind of need Bloodied weapons for a Bloodied build, no?
---
To achieve crazy damage numbers though, you need Unyielding armor which buffs your SPECIAL.  The increase in Strength is what gets you damage in the thousands.  Right now, Power Armor can't do that.
---
It's probably lag. My first hint that my modem's about to freeze again is when I stop disappearing.
---
I wanted mine on my radio on my second floor workshop. GG Bugthesda gonna go play forknife
---
look at the trading pages around the internet, plenty of rare items suddenly up for trade and people saying duping is the reason. I've spoken to a few players on different platforms who have told me there are dupe glitches that have existed form the start which were never patched. TSE lasers are everywhere all of a sudden, multiple fire rate rifles with the same roll too, that doesn't just happen out of nowhere. Another big pointer would be the accounts suspended for duping were told the suspension would be lifted when duping is patched and as far as i know, those players are still suspended.
---
Hmm that could actually work. I've been racking my brain on what could they change to show progression. Seems difficult since you don't want to change anything for those that haven't completed. But making minor changes within a building sounds plausible. It doesn't even need to be instanced. Just have 2 options at point of entry. Have server side load different interior based on player progression.
---
Yeah, I think I used the wrong word with disappointing . Makes a lot of sense describing how it would have to be done, thank you.
---
Thats what I figured. I’m hearing/seeing that only one surviving means you can only really get the Crook plans and the mutton pie recipe.
---
Have you read the one at the frat house about the mannequin?  That one is hilarious!
---
We expected things as they were advertised. A high-level endgame dungeon that requires you to play with people to clear it or it is too hard. But what we got is a worse whitesprings golf club (because ghouls are not grouped together as much, making clearing slower) where you can go through with All Rise and excavator power armor without any investment in melee perks and have no trouble solo (yes, i did that, it seriously was not a challenge)
---
Why couldnt they make it a real challenge ? Why not have the player discover the shacks and remains of the city, press a button or valve that starts a loud mechanism and draws literal hordes of ghouls towards you that will swarm you to death if you are solo. What we got at best is 4 ghouls crawling out of walls if you turn a valve. I expected the tunnels to be flooded with enemies, to be populated. God damn West Tek has more enemies in it than the burrows and honestly is far better since you can farm ammo and caps while you are at it since Mutants just drop that.
---
I'm not sure I've ever listened to Zappa, should give him a try. xD
---
Talking about event rewards not the Sheepsquatch’s loot drops
---
Lost my Junkies explosive shotgun, had that thing through the nerf and from level 50-190. 95% of my kills went on that gun that just vanished, along with my excavator armour leg and arm last week. 
---
Changing all my stats around again to bloodied as I have 7 bloodied legendaries. Now if I loose my weapons I have a little back up.
---
Could you imagine a low level following a high level into the fort, and the high level goes into a lavishly restored asylum full of friends and resources, and the low level goes in and finds only ghouls and death.
---
Pleasant valley cabins has a book that deals extra damage against “the Flatwoods alien” seems like it’s already out there somewhere
---
Do you have a workshop?
---
It's a almost a *physical effort* to not hear a pause when I read shit written like this.  It reminds me of that Thoughts of Dog Twitter.  
---
That's not a good thing.
---
Pretty much, yeah. I also have a problem where I hold on to too many different types of weapons and things like that. I'm sure that my perk card loadout is terrible for efficient playing/levelling but I was rather hoping the 2019 updates would help me out with more storage space and what not.
---
But even if my stash was much bigger, I'd love to have an easy-to-use list I can check for stuff that I own so I can quickly decide wether or not I'll hang on to it or (bulk and) sell it.
---
3rd queen and yet again no challenge even with a lmg( is there even something faster?).
---
I'm starting to think this is not obtainable.
---
Isn’t that the Flatwoods Monster though? Or is this new?
---
I've killed the SBQ solo and so has a friend, and it didn't count. I think the SBQ one is bugged. Anyone have a screenshot to prove otherwise?
---
Which new event?
---
For you, no.
---
God damn, well written argument and point of view again. Are you an attorney?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3cu8sDa90Y
---
Lost junkies explosive shotgun and 2 excavator pieces since 8.0. Both had name changes.
---
Depends on what bored you to begin with.  If you were bored because of disconnects and glitches and not enough events, those are better.  If you were bored because you were expecting a strongly character driven story like the single player games, it's not any better.
---
Considering that we have something like 12 million years to complete the challenge, I feel confident that our species will meet intelligent life within that time frame.  All Bethesda needs to do is add it to the game for our distant ancestors to collect a few atoms.
---
I'd rather have paint for the Gauss rifle
---
Good boy!
---
Oh man, when I get home I will post some of the pictures I've taken.  I was hovering in midair outside the boundary of the map for a while until I finally fast traveled away.  Got some great pictures.
---
I would love to have the dinner bell camp from NV
---
I’ve already added it to my will, as a pre-requisite for the kids to get their trust funds
---
There was a post made yesterday that attempted to track all the plans that drop from the event. [Here’s that post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bhd09e/detailed_info_on_the_new_event_free_range_spoilers/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)
---
One of the comments also mentioned a poisoned sheepsquatch staff but it’s not in the list, may have not gotten updated or the comment was incorrect, I don’t know.
---
And no, you can't walk around much.  Any direction you try to go gives you the *You can't go that way* message.
---
All good, at least you tried it out to see for yourself. Though Survival is still in Beta so who knows how much will or won't change in the coming months. Also really curious what the new Nuclear Winter and Wastelanders content will bring as well.
---
Hope there's something in there that is more inline with what you're looking for!
---
Thanks for the backup there Juice. Ive seen someone else say that but I cant find their thread to support it
---
Wait. What train?
---
and what unique rewards would that be..iv done the sheepsquatch at least 4 to 5 times a day since it started..iv got all the rewards it drops..i have enough outfits assaultron plans jet packs etc..alternatively i can play all day farming all the places that 3 star legendaries may spawn and not find a single one. at least with sheepsquatch i definitely get a 3 star and maybe 1 or 2 3 star robots
---
Public events, ok that's fair enough, I agree... 
---
A Nuke Zone that I created, welcome to the wild west boy. I don't feel like having fifteen glowing ones attacking me all at once, so if I can min max the shit out of them, I'm going to. If I see a legendary and someone has been near me, I will try to get the legendary to mutate, and then walk it over to said person, but other than that, screw off on that front :/ Also, legendary Yao guai, piss off on not one shotting those freaking things.
---
I am level 130 and have Wes-Tek on regular rotation and have never seen that many legendary super mutants there.. One is the most I have ever seen...
---
I think the main problem is that when controversy does happen, this sub does a poor job of containing it.  Stoked by the YouTube "celebrities," we get a lot of nomadic posters that come out of the woodwork *just* to complain.  For that sort of thing, you really need a mega-thread.  Instead we allow everyone to share their precious hot-take.
---
I have a bloodied light machine gun that shreds as well as well as a couple others I rarely use. The rest are explosive weapons. I use the machine gun for scorch beasts and players, and the sledge for everything else.
---
Unfortunately all the unyielding armor I've found has been under 50, but I will definitely keep a closer eye on getting that armor!
---
Are you saying that you haven't learned the plan already? Personally, I would always learn a plan, even if rare, and whether or not I think I will use it. I figure that being able to endlessly craft something is more valuable than a one off sale. I would only ever dispose of already known plans. That's just me though.
---
I wore a patched 3 piece suit the other day and it didn't count.  I could swear it did before, but it didn't this last time.
---
I think the sheepsquach is one of the best done creatures in the game. It looks crazy. The battle mechanics of it are unique. Its tanky without being just a giant sponge. I really enjoyed both times I fought it last night.
---
Plans and outfits. Those are the unique rewards.
---
It's not made to be a legendary gear farm. Stop acting disappointed that it isn't an effective one.
---
Everyone here saying they lost stuff. I've NEVER had an issue with stuff disapearing. Be careful not to fall into an echo chamber here. You likley accedentally dropped it /scrapped it / sold it /put it in a containe, etc.
---
200 hours, this has never happened to me. Discord Server 40+ never happened to any of my users.
---
&gt; It's not about showing off, it's about playing efficiently
---
This, thanks for clarifying.
---
One more thing to add to the grind, cleaning dirty dishes.
---
I mean realistically the level 500s should have better gear from playing the game longer. Obviously, the 60-70s could still use the same gear the 500s do, but it's way less likely for them to organically have great gear unless they buy it or are gifted it from higher leveled players.
---

There’s a perk that improves the accuracy of shotguns, it’s under perception and is called skeet shooter.

It’s like he’s trying really hard to pass the AP exam by using commas in sentences. That or it’s MODUS with all of the meaningless pauses
---
LOL no!  It started at the BBQ shack and finished up at Beckwith farm.  The trip there was a breeze, but the end fight was like "nobody fucks with the jesus".  A pile of radtoads followed by bloodbugs, then two sheepsquatch and more bloodbugs.  I actually kinda liked it, because I was literally pushed to the limit of what I could do with the best possible rifle and build (open for debate) and could not cheese through this event.  Even taking all three pylons during Encryptid seems easy by comparison.

I read on another thread recently that crafting and selling hats is a good money maker (not sure what type or where you get the plans), super low crafting cost though apparently. I've got a water purifier set up just outside Watonga train station, I usually just farm that
---
If you are on XBox I'll repair it to 200% for you.  I can do the same to armor, which adds a nice buff to resistance values too.
---
Are you on console? A hard reset might do the trick
---
ill be on tonight, not for like 8-9 hours.
---
Fully agree.  We needed an enemy like this.  Another option to fill the Scorchbeast miniboss role.
---
im lucky to have a good team of 4.. one or 2 of us take the pylons and kill robots the other 2 kill the sheep.2 on the sheep have bloodied sneak melee buildd..usually take the sheep out in 2 minutes...with meathook that do 6k with sneak attack damage it doesnt take long at all
---
I dont think survival has the x2 exp boost.
---
Wish you were on XB1 so I could hook you up with some plans and starter stuff but I am sure someone on PS4 can help you and the community overall is pretty nice and I know lots of high levels come to Flatwoods (one of the starting areas) and drop things for newbies frequently! 
---
Best tips are to take your time with quests and leave no stone unturned! There's always some neat little things to find in the wasteland. Lots of easter eggs and the like hiding around every corner.
---
When making foods - I always try to make soups as they count as food and water - corn / pumpkins / razorgrain are good for this and you can find it easily in the Forest area! 
---
Everything is doable solo - I even launched my first nuke solo - but that said it's much easier if you can find some friends and team up for some things and this weekend is a great weekend to start because it's a double XP weekend! 
---
I hope you have fun in the Wasteland!
---
I understand your point about nomadic posters, but I'm not in favour of megathreads in most situations. I find they become difficult to navigate and ugly to read.
---
Plus I am ultimately in favour of everyone having an opinion and sharing it-- what you describe as 'their precious hot-take'. I don't think it's fair or good to trivialize individual opinion in a world that leans so heavily on group-think and echo chambers.
---
Yes! The Nuclear Winter has me intrigued.  Definitely looking forward to things to come. 
---
 I just hope that player vendors and the legendary vendor comes sooner than later so I can unload some of my clutter.  One of the main reasons I can't play on the survival right now is I have nowhere to store the stuff in my inventory.  I would crash the server if I died in survival with the amount of aid I carry around.
---
 I just plain have nowhere to store it right now.
---
I can't sell it all because of the vendor cap and I just can't bring myself to drop stuff on the ground anymore.
---
well of course its about tribalism and its no surprise it comes to something like being excommunicated...  but fo76 is pretty guilty of trying to suppress criticisms and promote the game in some pretty bizarre and cringe-inducing ways as well.. 
---
in any case, thanks for the write-up its cathartic to air your grievances, but its no surprise your post is being downvoted on fo76, if i were to put on my tinfoil hat, i'd probably assume FC and fo76 are working together toward perception management related to the fallout around fallout 76
---
Hell, the BoS Solider / Knight suit is literally designed to be worn under power armor. The inside of power armor does NOT look comfortable. It's a lot of hard metal edges and little, if any, padding. The under armor provides that, along with a little extra defense if you have linings.
---
&gt;I tap them usually by meleeing them with my gun and then waving to let other people know
---
Thanks for sharing this, I'll be doing the same from now on
---
thx very much for the help and guidance on another challenge!
---
*sorry*
---
lol for some reason the beginning kind of reminds me of a certain Tool song from back in the day. 
---
Thanks for the link!
---
On my way to you now.
---
No but they sold it to us at full price before marking it half priced 2 weeks later.
---
I got a weighted shepsquatch staff
---
In that case I've not noticed a difference either. I got the Sheepsquatch Staff + Mutton Pie or whatever with one Brahmin remaining. Another had all three brahmin survive and only got the mutton pie /shrug 
---
Pretty sure it's random
---
I could not damage them with the shredder on my minigun, which is nice.
---
I never understand these posts. You have the game. You can read all of the newsletters about what's new. Just crank it back up and play and see if it's worth it to you. No one can judge whether it's worth it to you. At worst, you've lost a few hours playing the game.
---
My bad. Xbox pleb here. I just figured the same mods were available for PS4. I could never get used to having my thumbs that close together when playing games..
---
like i said..i have all the plans and outfits..and im pretty sure it is meant to be a legendary gear farm
---
Keep an eye out for teddy bears out in the wild.  They are almost always posed for a scene, some of which are absolutely *hilarious*.
---
Ha, for a few days.  Still that way more often than not.
---
Definitely immune to friendly fire.  My explosive ammo wasn't harming them.  Unsure about exploding cars/gas cans/propane tanks though.
---
Ahh yeah the Divide one is pretty challenging too... I hear it’s supposed to be the ‘medium’ difficulty but really I think the Divide/Mire versions of the event are just as hard.
---
Tell me about my team and I just use low damage weapons so that everyone near by can tag the enemies
---
You picked a good weekend to come aboard, it's double XP until Monday. Early on don't waste too many resources crafting or repairing gear... Basically just do the tutorial that shows you how, but after that just try to replace your stuff with things you get from dead enemies. This will help you save your resources until you start getting legendary gear which is worth it to repair. Collect and scrap all the guns you find, this is how you learn mods. Remember to scrap your junk before you stash it, this will save on weight. Don't let the hunger and thirst stress you out, the game will give you all the food and water you need. Although it won't seem like it at first VATS is extremely good and useful. When you come across a workshop try and take it, you can use it to gather resources but its more for the xp and goodies you get for taking them at the low levels. If a high level offers trade they probably want to give you stuff for free, but please don't request their cool weapons or gear, it's annoying lol. It'll help to have an idea of what kind of build you want and select perks that will play to that end. Read the terminals and listen to the holotapes.
---
Most of all, just have fun!
---
yeah they have been selective with which parts of the lore they put in the game, if they had called the fusion cores version 1 something like that to make them different to the cores from fallout 4 that would have been one way of making them weaker, the game does sort of feel rushed and i think that's why we don't have human NPC's in the game yet and will get them around the end of the year
---
Serums are the best for me- with level 3 Hard Bargain they sell for 500caps each to the vendors. If you don't have time to get flux yourself - on XB1 at least most people sell the serums from anywhere between 100-300 caps so you could just buy them from players and vendor sell them for 500 :)
---
They nerfed the prices on craftable clothing like hats etc. selling found cloths is still my favorite option. Weight to caps ratio is decent.
---
even a regular level 50 one shreds mobs health fairly quick.. stats on it just makes it that much better
---
Yea people suck
---
Do you need me to call you a wahmbulance?
---
Tales from the West Virginia Hills 4
---
“+15% Dmg. Vs. the Flatwoods alien”
---
And there is a large purple, glowing alien on the cover
---
I cannot for the life of me get these to spawn. I did the quest, got a few during the quest, and since then I have never seen them, and I've checked often. I think I'm cursed. I can find  Strangler Pods occasionally, but never Bloom.
---
yea da real sheepsquatch
---
How recent? If not mistaken most recent patch they increased material cost and reduced selling price of several items to avoid this scenario.
---
Yeah that tags as the flat wood monster when you take a picture.. it counts towards the 9, but not as the ‘alien’.
---
I've never had any real problems with fo76, I guess because it feels less like a community to me and more like a true forum. Sometimes there's broad consensus, but often it's just a lot of people voicing their concerns or desires. In that way I don't get the same sense of agenda or tribalism that I get from some FC members.
---
They nerfed the hat deal, you now need 3 cloth and 1 leather I think but only sells for 13 caps or a little more depending on your charisma. I guess selling water isn't a bad idea, I have seen people with 10-15 water pumps or a bunch of purifiers, this actually might be a better deal if you can spend time at your camp .. might not be ideal for Op.
---
Geezus Chris. Are your others just spread with 1 point?
---
Hopefully I can hop on before the weekend is over, my Internet trash but is getting there either Tonight or Tomorrow I'll be reclaiming the wasteland
---
i'm having the same problems (PS4 as well), in the end i had to turn the game off it was getting unplayable
---
Dunno if I’d go that far, I think it’s just general ignorance. Event’s only been around for a day, and though I’m annoyed at the amount of losses, I don’t really blame anybody for focusing on the cool brand new enemy and forgetting about the cows.
---
Kill enemies and sell their guns. You can adventure and make caps
---
If you own the game, why not just play fora few and form your own opinion? We're not going to be able to tell you if it will be enjoyable for you since what is enjoyable is relative. My endgame is farming for rare outfits and plans- for others it could be killing the queen 10 times a day.
---
200 damage is pretty good.  You might want to look for a legendary version to give you some more punch. Try to get perks that benefit rifle and flat damage.
---
Agreed from a combat perspective if the lvl 60-70 players focused on weapon and damage perks, but likely most players used some levels for non-combat perks too. But more broadly speaking, by 100 you should pretty much have everything to configure yourself fully for a hard fight from perks to legendary equipment.
---
That squirrel vats killed meee lmaaooo
---
If you look the videos that make the most money aren't negative videos
---
Oh no.  It's entirely possible I'm mistaking the patched suit for a dirty tan suit.  They look very similar.  I hope I didn't screw up anyone's atom challenges with faulty advice.
---
Not a game for trolls.
---
ESAD
---
But none of the item drops were :(
---
You've clearly got something you need to get out there...
---
But I completely agree, I may have accidentally scrapped or dropped it, hundreds of items cycle through my inventory every play session. The issue is that *that* shouldn't happen, it's by poor design that it is so easy to destroy or lose your favourite items.
---
PS. Food spoil rate absolutely did change, Beth acknowledged it and changed it in the most recent patch.
---
aww, that sucks, thanks either way
---
Yes they do, it’s literally where I bought mine and my boyfriend bought his lmao.
---
 &gt;you aren't remotely objective
---
&gt;everything you say is objective
---
&gt;Learn what words mean
---
is this a typo or am I confused?
---
I just got the page to load and it looks solid. You definitely need to be looking or trading for a legendary version of what you have.
---
I agree time is money. Im not waiting unless its a Legendary enemy. When youre on a team you share loot whether you tag the enemy or not. Should be the same thing in events. Whoever is part of the event, team or no team should share the loot. Theres been times where im using vats and gunfu to swap between enemies on kill, and end up one shotting a legendary without even realizing it until i loot the bodies. 
---
Certain events that you know will have a legendary at a certain point, not much excuse for killing it before other players can tag it. But in nuked Whitespring when im sitting outside the door to the clubhouse getting rushed by 30 ghouls at once.....im gonna be one shotting them. I will try to skip the legendaries if there are other players close, but im not gonna die and miss out myself. 
---
Events should share loot between all players in the event. Nuke zones, maybe share loot between all players within 100 feet or so. Then there are no hard feelings.
---
Why not?
---
Depends on what you want to do really - I'm a bloody build as well and the only time I used power armor is for the queen since I cannot use my deathclaw gauntlet in power armor- so I just use my Bloody Grognak's axe.  I'm too squishy to just wear the Hazmat suit + Deathclaw - I don't like respawning due to ads over and over on the queen. 
---
So outside of the queen I don't even carry my power armor with me. 
---
Also Riomaki was correct - unyielding is a beautiful thing. I def recommend trying to gather a set.
---
Being with friends is super helpful. Especially with server dc
---
Never have grouped once in my over 200+ levels. 
---
Have participated in events with others, SBQ etc, but never teamed up.
---

---
I’m no expert on a pipe build, but this is what I’d do at quick glance.
---
Having a group isnt necessary but its more fun with friends
---
I agree. I frequently feel like although my guns damage is relatively high, very little is actually making it to players.
---
Any idea where I can get a legendary pipe revolver from? I've spent a lot of time at Whitespring farming legendaries, but have never come across a pipe weapon. Is it just luck of the draw or are certain weapon types more likely to drop at certain locations?
---
Its kind of ironic, cause you'd assume walking around in a human tank would heavily boost STR, but putting on my PA I lose some where around 10 STR points from my Unyielding.   
---
While its ideal to get level 45/50 armor, you can still see major SPECIAL boosts with the lower level armor as well.
---
Find a handmade rifle and a good combat knife.
---
Something similar happened to me, these really high level people helped me complete the sheepsquatch event and gave me and my friend a couple really good weapons
---
Can we just agree to call it the "Grognaxe" from now on?
---
If they make more events like this, I'm all for it.  I had a blast feeling underpowered/overwhelmed for a change.  After Earl died, I had a little voice in my head say "git gud bruh".  I've been at work ever since, thinking about how to do better next time and posting on reddit, while I should be focusing on font and layout choices.
---
What’s the event called?
---
Fallout 76 end game enemies are big bullet sponges. You won't get anywhere without using mutations and stacking all the damage multipliers that you can. I'd highly discourage you from trying to use multiple classes of weapons - there just aren't enough perk card slots to support this. 
---
A good option for a new solo player is to get a hard hitting instigating weapon. You could use an instigating Lever Action or Hunting Rifle and rely on stealth. You could also get an instigating Grognak Axe or Super Sledge - either will one shot bloated glowing ghouls and possibly Super Mutants at max level. None of that will do meaningful damage to the Queen though. If you want to do meaningful damage to the SBQ, you need to go with a bloodied build. Melee or ranged, up to you. I find ranged with power armor to be far safer, and after all, dead dps = no dps.
---
I did a writeup on a pretty good bloodied heavy weapons build here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bgaoyi/end\_game\_pve\_build\_guide\_bloodied\_heavy\_weapons/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bgaoyi/end_game_pve_build_guide_bloodied_heavy_weapons/) 
---
IMO this is the way to go, but you could also go with a bloodied handmade rifle or combat shotgun build. Any of those is viable. A bloodied super sledge would work equally well (in fact, you can swap between a bloodied super sledge melee build and the build above by simply swapping out heavy weapons perks for melee 2hand perks).
---
Ah I know the one you mean, this is where I settled in the end

---
Careful with those though, can't tell you how many times I've become wanted because I accidentally hit a person a bunch or destroy a turret
---
I wouldn't say your build is rubbish. A little one trick pony I guess. 
---
I would say get rid of all those pistol perks. You have 9 points sunk into a relatively weak bonus and those points could be used for stealth perks or shifted over into Strength for more shotgun damage.
---
WHaaat? How did I go from 3+ score to -1 score?
---
Am I not allowed to have my own feelings and thoughts?
---
Must I reflect only "Whats Trending" in happy projections??
---
Should I not respond to others???
---
Prima Donna's?
---
...
---
That's a great idea, and very well done.
---
I was able to solo all of the content - including launching a nuke - however I have since found a good group of people to play with and it's much easier to deal with the wasteland. We all have our specialties and it makes getting gear easier as well. We trading gear / weapons / ammo around to make sure everyone has what they need for their builds. 
---
So groups while convenient and for some, more fun - they are not necessary ultimately.
---
Wow, that's a lot of mutations. Is that something I need to invest in? I've reached the part in the game where you learn about them (no spoilers) but the only mutations I've gained (and lost) are random ones from exposure.
---
Both modes this time
---
Your best bet is the trade subs tbh
---
Other than public event stuff I was able to solo the story line.
---
They nerfed the civil war top hat which used to be great for selling. What I’ve been crafting and selling tons of is the marine tactical helmet. It takes 1 glass, one plastic, and 3 rubber to craft one helmet. I’ve got low charisma and hard bargain and they sell for about 27-30 caps each dependent on mentats. I can server hop grafton once or twice and have over 150 rubber, farm watoga high school once for over 100 plastic, then craft them. With super duper I usually have like 100 of these in a few minutes which is like two days of max vendor caps. They’ll probably nerf this soon so use it while you can
---
Free range
---
 The Marine Gimp Mask, I forget the real name, is just a few bits of rubber and cloth I think. Any way it sells for 35 caps or so and is everywhere. ;)
---
That is a good observation. I think people like it better when he's using a weapon that's easy to get compared to the god roll 3 star weapons (but those sure are fun).
---
i sell marine tactical helmets for 27 caps a piece (With hard bargain 3)  you can get the plans at Drop Site C2 other plans spawn there as well so just sever hop till you get the right one ( It's in the Cranberry Bog to the northeast of Watoga), it costs 1 glass, 1 plastic and 5 rubber or 3 rubber with level 2 armorer.
---
True, but that is what i think is great about the idea. It is the players choice to take on the quest. Will you follow through with Vault 76's goals of rebuilding or will you decide that its not worth saving? Given time they could even add faction battles and stuff.
---
I’ve been having it as well. It I would t classify it as unplayable. For me it’s mostly colors and I’ve noticed buildings loading much slower.
---
Posiden has a Veribot pad and aluminum.
---
We need that borderless mod from fallout 4.
---
200 damage is pretty good. What specifically is not working for you?
---
I'm no expert at all. But if you want rifleman, I would lose the gunslinger and instead invest in some sneak related perks. Also find a lever action rifle, even non-legendary at first. Maybe you can also invest in the shotgun stagger perk under agility.
---
I ended up south of the border last night. I just couldn't do anything once I was there
---
It’s what I do
---
It does; didn't test if the additional 20% bonus applied tho
---
Is it just look of the draw on finding a handmade rifle or are there certain locations I should focus on? Presumably, I'd need to find a few to scrap in order to learn the mods needed to max damage output. As for the combat knife, is that a viable option for the up close and personal? Could I run Whitespring with a good combat knife?
---
It worked for me, I was south of the border and it was totally unintentional
---
I don't know about wool, but he certainly has some nice Nocturnal Wood Left Arm.
---
 You can solo the game fairly easily. Its fun with other people as well so ... whatever is good. ;)
---
It probably comes form the same mindset of not giving away tricks and strategy on this reddit. There is a way to respawn Whitesprings golf club, once you clear it, in one minute. Yet, there is no guide on how to do that on here. No one on youtube is making a video on how to do it. Yet I randomly joined a group of players with mics and saw how it is done.
---
My point is, people are competitive plus selfish and don't want others to get an advantage.
---
You're worried about *TSEs*? My child, just wait until you see players with better legendaries.
---
I would be pissed. I am still pissed about it even though it was at release.
---
For real. My strength is only 17. My only concern with the lower level armor would be damage resistance, because I'd like the most possible
---
I run a combination of unyielding and bolstering sentinal armor. Between that, Blocker in STR, and Serendipity in LCK, I can usually tank most things, even at 52 health (19%)
---
It took me a while, and it's very expensive, but the QOL improvements make it worth it.
---
I’ll be joining you in a bit
---
This. TSEs are garbage. Literally half the dps of a 1 star bloodied weapon. I keep a TSE on me... purely for blowing up mainframe cores when doing a Silo run. That's it lol.
---
When you say time is money.. How are you making money on this game?
---
This would have been so much better
---
I mostly play without a group.  You can eventually solo most things with a good build, armor, and weapons.  There are perks like Lone Wanderer that benefit solo players too.
---
But one good reason to group up is to maintain a connection to the same world, so if you get disconnected or crash, you can rejoin via your friend.
---
I don't think so! I'm only level 25 so still pretty new. Hahah. I'll have to keep an eye out for that one!
---
On the food. Oh really because I saw the exact same complaint post after the patch asking if the food spoil rate got worse. It didn't. Clearly you just said they made it better. And I don't know about you but I always get a pop-up if I'm about to scrap a favorited item...
---
Really? I thought I had seen it as for adventure mode only, that's cool tho. I'd assume the 20% boost is there too then.
---
everything was loading slower for me and when night came the screen became almost pitch black without my flashlight even in places like whitesprings (inside) which is supposed to be well lit, i will try again later
---
Laughs in speed/melee build
---
I would rather see that on my doorstep than a couple pimply Mormon teens that can't take no for an answer.  The response is the same.  Hide and pretend I'm not home.
---
Oh yeah i agree. I admit I’m a bit frustrated trying to grind this event because of its level of difficulty and emphasis on cooperation (especially since I dont have any friends who play, so I’m forced to rely on randoms), but at the same time it actually feels pretty unique and genuinely fun, and I want to keep trying.
---
I've gone back to my camp to craft the camera, but wont be leaving the server just yet.
---
It wouldnt even have to be that big of a difference really. They could leave the interior alone, post a few interior guards around put a vendor and a couple random scribes and stuff in there. Kinda like GNR in fallout 3.
---
[deleted]
---
In WS golf clubhouse, you usually get a pretty steady stream of ghouls coming at you, so it’s a nice “will it repeat” testing area. I was using a Vampire DCG, so I usually get confirmation of a hit by both my health bar and enemies’ bar ticking at least a little on every hit.
---
What it *feels* like is as if my claw was about 5 to 6 inches shorter. So ones that would be just barely in range don’t connect despite any sound effects. Even getting just slightly closer it seemed like drastically better hit rate.
---
Shrug... I know that’s nit the actual thing going on, but it is definitely the impression, so I guess for now I’ll play that way...
---
Wow I’m glad that I asked!  Thanks everyone for the feedback!!!
---
It's not that it's not working per say, just that I don't see any other higher level player running around with a pipe revolver like me and feel that I'm missing something. The only issue is, that if I lose the gunslinger perks, I lose the 200 damage as the pipe revolver rifle is boosted by both the rifleman and gunslinger perks, I'd have to see what the reduction is by removing them. I guess the sneak perks could make up for the difference when hidden and then shotgun for up close and personal.
---
Yeah, mutations are good end game for QOL, DR or damage
---
You on PC?  IGN shankwell
---
Would love some proper support to save the cattle.
---
One of the dlc on the roadmap they released said exactly that. True choice and consequence. So they do have something in works it seems, but very little information is known at this point.
---
&gt;[Double XP Weekend Two](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7wimxCcc8NURG9Em2bV7Ds/fallout-76-upcoming-double-xp-weekends)**:**

&gt;  
---
&gt;\* **Modes:** Adventure and Survival Beta  
---
&gt;**\* Start:** 12:00 p.m. EDT (16:00 UTC) on Thursday, April 25  
---
&gt;**\* End:** 6:00 a.m. EDT (10:00 UTC) on Monday, April 29
---
But here's the thing, this is your idea of best organization. I want chems on top because I use chems.
---
Not too shabby
---
I think Chtulhu is kinda busy in R'lyeh.
---
Maybe a Transformer too?
---
i think they said in the patch notes that there is only 1 lens in the game at the minute and they will add more later
---
Oh definitely, but it can be worth it still. I mean these characters are already pretty glassy, at least mine is, but with the dodging perks etc I'd rather have a bit more damage out than protection personally. 
---
That said, I have a few 1* Unyielding I don't have equipped as my available non-Unyielding 3* are overall better. Grinding to complete my outfit.
---
Well, if you're Bloodied, it's less about DR and more about flat damage reduction. Things like Sentinel/Cavalier armor, Lone Wanderer, and damage mitigation perks like Serendipity and Dodgy.
---
As many high level enemies have armor piercing capabilities, DR ends up mattering less than you'd think.
---
 Not with that build. A Combat Knife, the most fun weapon I have found, needs Strength and Intelligence perks to work well.
---
 Mine are ridiculous but I have 15 Strength and Twisted Muscles for another 25% Melee damage and will have eaten Glowing Steak for another 10% Melee.
---
 You see your problem for this kind of build. You are far too weak.
---
Thanks, and I kinda feel that, but the pistol perks do boost the pipe revolver rifle that I'm using to five me the 200 damage. Someone else has also suggested similar to you in relation to stealth perks and adding strength for shotgun. When I'm next on I'll have a look at the difference in damage output without the pistol perks and if the stealth perks would negate this.
---
Also, Encryptid was mostly a shitshow for about a week before word spread.  Give it some time and randoms will (mostly) wise up.
---
&gt;  you're ~~Conan~~ Grognak, we get it
---
FTFY :P
---
And see, this is a real problem, because this is an online game that's supposed to be about partying up with people and having fun, yet instead, because of how the tagging mechanic works, I don't want others around because:
---
A: If I'm nice and let them tag, I'm slowing down my farming by a huge amount, to where I'm taking 4-5x longer.
---
B: If I'm a jerk and just kill everything, I'm an asshole, but as a bloodied build running around with 19% HP, I don't want to sit there tanking stuff while some random dude misses 5 shots in a row with his hunting rifle.
---
There's something inherently wrong with a multiplayer game when the BEST outcome I can hope for is that I get a server to myself with on one else on it.
---
I had heard he was bored, and wasn’t doing anything..
---
r/okbuddyretard
---
Winner(!)
---
LOL.  They'll have a brand new flower hat to wear at their first day of VTU.
---
Haha I did believe you, but thanks!
---
Still there?
---
it means you can't go that way yet, the map could be getting bigger
---
Yeah, because that exists.
---
You can buy the Handmade plans. Or server hop until pick the one up at Berkley springs. The one on the roof shack on the shelf. 
---
I run with a unyielding armor, bloodied, sneak build and have a bloodied combat knife. I do Whitesprings every day, sometimes more. Kill them before they wake up. Amazing what you pick up, no need for nukes. I use the Captainoob sneak perk build.
---
Man spend hours hopping haven't seen any BOS plan yet :| howlong did it take for you? Starting to wonder if they even spawn at all lol
---
Here I thought it was just me. Supersledge power swings (not regular swings) weren't landing for me last night.
---
Ahh ok, I hadn't realised they'd nerfed it

But will I be able to threw a grenade a fish?
---
 I have never managed to hurt anything with the stupid cannon. I did try once after taking a Quad away from an angry cricket but I could not get it to hurt anything and sold it to Wallace. ;)
---
Ah idk about that, fair enough.
---
You do now, but you can't favourite all your gear unless you waste most of the space on the favourite wheel. Also if you drop stuff that doesn't warn you. It's definitely half implemented.
---
I see what you did there.  Close enough.
---
Thank you I’ll be sending invite
---
Glad I could help! Hopefully, you won't have to server hop too much to get it. Not sure why they didn't just make it a static spawn at multiple location like the Order of Mysteries quest. Ah well it is what it is. Happy hunting.
---
"Defend the brah! men!"
---
Level up fast to.. do what though?
---
Why not go on the market subs?
---
Yeah on the server.
---
Thanks but I use pacifist when I’m using the Tesla rifle and never had a problem.
---
Marine tactical helmet. 1 glass, 1 plastic, 3 rubber
---
You mean Liberty Prime?
---
People were whining about seeing too many hats at vendors so it got nerfed .. I shouldn't of been as it was by design ..  I still sell hats just to annoy those individuals. What they should of done instead is just stack multiple items .. but of course they didn't do that either ..
---
&gt; all players are always visible on map unless they’re sneaking. 
---
&gt;You don’t play the game
---
in survival players dont apear on the map . the minimap shows where players are and the esp hack tells me the distance.
---
It's just an expression. In this case I'm refering to caps, legendaries, scrap, flux, or anything else that I'm trying to acquire in the game. I have never made and never intend to make a dime playing Fallout 76. Doing so is against the ToS.
---
Thanks for the information. I do have a bloodied sledgehammer with 40% faster swing that I used for a while when farming Whitespring, it did okay but I'm always too worried about being low health and my understanding is that that's kinda necessary for the bloodied build. I'll definitely give your writeup a read and see how I can add that.
---
I've never been a fan of the heavy weapons, but if I could find a way to adopt a rifle / melee build instead of a shotgun build, I'd be as equally happy.
---
Yeah it can be frustrating - like how you cannot build atom shop items in their camp - even if you both own the atom shop item.
---
Oh I never knew that what a perk, under what Special is it?
---
Ran into this issue several times during the uranium fever event. I think it also helps to get on your mic and let them know.
---
And this is why i always keep a Tesla Rifle with me... Actually everyone should keep one nearby.
---
Oof. I wasn’t experiencing anything that bad. Good luck
---
https://youtu.be/8gtbSfGqL3k
---
I searched google for this achiev and saw this thread;
---
PLEASE do upvote it !
---
+karma awesome thank you for posting
---
That's a nice weapon. Let me know if you ever want to sell it.
---
I run a Bloody/Explosive Shotgun build. I use exclusively PA.  In a situation where you’d be melee, you’d want to run non PA Unyielding build as strength gives you a huge damage buff.  Shotguns/range weapons don’t receive buffs from legendary armor unless you’re running a crit build, which I’m not.  DM me for my build if you like.   I two shot Mire queens and Scorchbeasts, beast build, very tanky.
---
yeah you too
---
Thanks, looks like I'm heading to Berkley Springs when I get back on :)
---
You don’t flight Cthulhu. You fight his minions, and even then, you lose despite your training and/or technology.
---
No problem. 😊
---
[Here is mine](https://imgur.com/a/AVWtSiX)
---
Not a transformer but..
---
I’d be game for liberty prime. Your own walking talking iRobot 40 ft tall. THAT would make SBQ, worth fighting for and getting involved with.
---
Those huge head statutes could be strewn all over the map could be the components that you assemble and power up. To make it interesting, make it use once only per SBQ, AND Recurring so that anyone interested could play.
---
He could use his own weapons or you could fabricate his own all rise. Personally I’d like to see a huge crusader dual wield sword..
---
How do you get your free one?
---
You on PC?
---
I'm referring to invincibility from wearing 2 pieces. It's impossible to become invincible to fall damage.
---
I thought his minions were mindless.. so you’re in effect, fighting the boss.
---
and to make it worse most use hacks
---
All the non capacity mods give a carry penalty.
---
Happens in 3 places, I think.
---
Thanks, maybe I'll check out the trade subs, I have a number of 3* legendaries that I've keep so who knows, maybe I'll get lucky.
---
Soooo we have to activate the pylons...?
---
It's a setting in the menu, not a perk.
---
go to the settings ingame and one of them will be to turn on Pacifist.  Makes it so you cant damage other players.
---
Well researched!
---
I used an explosive handmade that should have been able to one-shot all the brahmin at once with maxed out Adenaline perk.  It does no damage even with an accidental direct hit.  I'm sure this was intentional, as there's a lot of AoE options in the game, including grenades, launchers, flamers, tesla rifles, etc.  Making it impossible to do based on your build choice seems deeply unfair, so I'm glad they made the brahmin immune to friendly fire.  It's kinda like rolling up a wizard in your weekly DnD group, getting a fireball spell, using it for the first time when your DM allows friendly fire and have the rest of the table look at you [with this face](https://media1.tenor.com/images/cadc6e4a1c2b8b73bf64176716295ddb/tenor.gif) the first time you use it.
---
Sorry no, I'm on PS4
---
My first was three * all the rest were one.
---
It appears one star legendaries' star is being overwritten by the diseased symbol.
---
love your camp! the wiring irks my OCD tho.
---
This. I have a two-shot Handmade, and I can usually just spray at head level and get several one-shot headshots. It's about effiency.  
---
But I also don't bitch about not getting to tag a mob; since most of the time, it's a shit legendary anyways.
---
You sound incredibly confident about this but you are super wrong. Two pieces of acrobat gear absolutely negate all fall damage.
---
And here is mine! https://imgur.com/sn4es9m.jpg
---
Did you watch the video? Or any others showing how to do it? The armor pieces stack so you can negate fall damage if you’re wearing 2
---
I assumed as much, I haven't followed all of the references to see what each one holds as an effect yet.
---
Everything is currently labeled as junk in the files because of the ones from the dev room
---
Lol I thought whoopsies was gonna make me shit my pants or something
---
Shame, could have given you a good freebie.
---
And even if so, it's insanely stupid to NOT protect them.  Do your freaking job for the mission.
---
Oh shit, you're right. I didn't watch the video.
---
It is absolutely happening, and it totally sucks.
---
Yes, I was unaware.
---
Ok, then, Where is it ? 
---
Which entrance did you take ?
---
I took the service entrance and that did not work...
---
I’ve seen Anne twice at the mothman statue
---
That's what I wined up doing at the behest of someone else's information. And it worked just fine thank you. Your information is also very correct.
---
loot pause. It is most notable with the extra loot perks where you search again. It varies from immediate to as long as 5 minutes. You get nothing, walk away. 5 minutes later you get the *schwiiiing!* that says you got more loot.
---
I'm on PC , but thanks anyway.It's the intention that matters :D
---
Luckily , I managed to sell some weapons and buy the stuff I needed to build my camp , so the damage , allthough considerable (14k caps stolen) , didn't mess up my things that badly.
---
PS4 I'm afraid otherwise you'd be first to know if I ever needed to sell it.
---
You know what they aren't apparently immune from?  VATS targeting.  I'm fairly certain I kept accidentally targeting them in VATS last night, which is annoying as crap.
---
I don't know why this is getting downvoted. Even if it's not the culprit it's still a valuable PSA.
---
There is no way the brotherhood is sending a scouting party out. They are not gonna leave the bunker if they don't have to for quite some time over in Cali
---
Haha

I'm one of those noobs. What's the proper way to do it?
---
You Bought All Generator Plans At The Enclave?

Thanks for the offer anyway, this community never fails to be the best.

Are you on Xbox?
---
the small shelves, placed back to back, make a nice counter. The right rugs on top makes it look like it has a countertop
---
MODUS!! Of course!
---
So the surprising catch in the game will be a 2 eyed fish, because everything you catch is normally 3 eyed?
---
As a small item I do for new characters, don’t max out perk cards til level 20.  You get free packs pretty steady early on and may can max some good skills for free, leaving you the chance to get some good utility perks.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
Go there and do some character planning, something I wish I knew on my first character.  I’m at 5 now... (which is the max!)
---
The search luck perks, like pharma farma, mean you click another button on the container for bonus loot.  Pharma farma is incredibly good.
---
~700 hours in and I still learn new little things about the game.
---
35, Army Vet, and I 💯
---
I've seen ads selling Destiny 2 shit too.
---
The fucking wild thing is you'll see youtubers sponsored by these sites, throwing up a short advertisement in their videos. Like wtf..
---
Diagnostic reports usually contain data about your system, not your character or in-game information. And a lot of the issues that you mentioned point toward a hardware issue or something related to your setup. 
---
If you only have one character, then they would need you to create a new one, to compare with the one you encounter the issue with. If you encounter the same issues with the new character then the issue is still something specific to the system. If you don't, then they've narrowed it down to something specific about your character and can proceed from there.
---
They're probably going to keep asking you to run diagnostics, that's just how they can gain insight on your system. There's just no way around it.
---
They're doing what they can, but until they can figure out **what** is wrong, they can't just fix it.
---
add me on PSN and I'd be happy to make you one!
---
I don't have any just curious why only 1 star specifically?
---
Sure 1:30 pst works for me. I havent added you yet but I can when I get home.
---
Normal armor not working was always a balance thing because then you could get special legendary effects + PA mods.
---
This is an exception because they didn’t want to or had trouble making backpacks for PA.
---
Is that the going rate for it? I got it but won’t use it.
---
My suggestions, without worrying about getting god roll legendary weapons first.
---
 I would focus on one class of gun, if you want rifles, drop the shotgun for semi-auto combat/handmade rifles for up close encounters, that share the same perk set as your primary. You'll pull higher DPS, as any rifle related perks will affect them as well. This also gives you 1 point you can pull out of STR for LCK or AGI.
---
Drop concentrated fire to 1, 3*'s only gives a 4% additional dmg boost. You can use the 2 pts in PER for better QOL LCK perks.
---
Stealth perks give the highest front end dmg, and are pretty powerful, which is why they're so popular, but aren't necessary for PvE. It depends on how you want to play, but might be more useful than the gunslingers.
---
I've seen some pipe builds, but they seem more of a novelty, and focised around one specific legendary gun, than a viable end game build. With a basic modded Lever Action or Sniper, you can still get at least 150+ dmg.
---
What's it cost you to start up the game you already bought to find out?
---
Smh
---
And he wouldn't mind the company!  *hic*
---
If it's me and a low level in Uranium fever, I refuse to die so they can get more points.  
---
With the amount of enemies in that event, If I'm not killing efficiently, they're smashing the extractors or killing me.    
---
I can't wait for the pipe pistol damage to kill em, as it costs me durability to tank those hits.  
---
If the person was there alone, would they be more successful without me?  
---
I ALWAYS make a point of finding the legendaries and leading them to the other people, let them get some hits in, then smash them down.  
---
If someones poaching all the legendaries, thats lame.     
---
If they're making it so you can achieve victory, whole other story.
---
I had been doing that but I end up over weigh and takes forever to walk from western to WS train station.
---
the closest I think you can come to that is the "mark for search" feature for specific crafting components.  At least it will highlight stuff you know you need.
---
\&gt;  I'm sure that my perk card loadout is terrible for efficient playing/levelling 
---
What level you are you?  I know once you get to about 45, leveling happens much faster, b/c you are dealing with much higher XP enemies.
---
I've got a lot of weapons as well - havent explored the whole map, so hesitate to dump them not knowing how effective they are against (enemy)
---
I know exists, but I havent run across yet.
---
Those containers act as your stash box just look different
---
You’ve been able to milk Brahmin since the Nukashine patch but the name errors are interesting. I wonder if they are the named Brahmin for the new event that just didn’t get assigned properly.
---
FO4 boosts strength to 11 no matter what. I don’t think it does this in 76.
---
They just act like stash boxes. I don’t have an actually “stash” box at my camp, just various containers that are all under the stash tab.
---
All containers you put in your CAMP are connected to your stash.
---
Yeah, Ive seen lots of people talking trash about high levels not being able to one shot ghouls with their melee in a nuked whitespring. But I'm literally running around with an electrified Mr hand saw scratching the ghouls and have about 10 of them following me while another play slaps them with his combat knife or one guy had a rolling pin. Although I'd rather be partied because my saw always always always Knicks a player and even on Pacifist mode it for some reason flags me for PvP then I get murdered by the players. Oi vey.
---
I think the larger issue with that, is that most of us long time Fallout players, are used to playing 400+ hours solo already. It takes some adjusting, and you never know the quality of the players joining you.
---
Any container you put in your camp will be a stash box. There's no regular container items. If however you built your camp near an existing world container you could use it as an unsecured stash, but you better remember to empty it before logging out!
---
I keep wanting to do that but I end up deleting them with scrapping
---
And be aware you will take massive radiation when you go into the drop site, so be prepared.
---
Oh so I can’t put a suitcase in my camp like what we find out in the wasteland?
---
&gt;Ok, then, Where is it ?  
---
&gt;Which entrance did you take ?  
---
&gt;I took the service entrance and that did not work...
---
 
---
Ok, then, Where is it ?
---
ANY new normal armor sets or pieces would leave us left out. Underarmor is for normal armor. Not every piece of gear has to be useful to everybody.
---
It's basically a 5% damage increase per hit, up to 50%.
---
People tell me it's around 5% per hit
---
Thats a good idea but my plush bunny needs to be with my princess bed 
---
I just have it next to it though :/
---
Mindless? No. The minds of the Old Ones and their minions are unknowable. So alien to human experience that the mere consideration of their existence and workings breaks the fragile human mind. An ant has more insight as to the whims of a human whose house it inhabits than a human has insight into the designs of the Old Ones and their constructs. At best we might understand the motivations of the human cultists who worship Cthulhu, but even their madness requires careful study and psychoanalysis to comprehend.   
---
Fiction aside, the Cthulhu Mythos has several contributors, and each author's interpretation of cosmic horror varies enough to make it very tough for anything to be canonical. They can be mindless if that serves your telling.
---
But excavator has crap defenses (compared to other PA anyway) and PA has other draw backs. The sole reason backpacks work is because they wanted PA to use them to but for some reason didn’t want to or had trouble implementing PA packs.
---
Nah. You could go to a railroad station and leave it there in bags and containers though
---
OK
---
So you have to enter through the bunker entrance.
---
Then you have to go to the first modus computer which is in a big blue room.
---
Get close enough....
---
And it's gone !
---
Any container you place at your camp is basically a different skinned stash box, so no you can't.
---
I couldn’t agree more. Unfortunately, it’s the society we live in now. You can’t go anywhere without hearing or seeing something. I loved the old gaming where you figured things out as they came at you. Sure, there were walkthroughs, if you really wanted or needed to use them. I just ignore the stuff because it’s not going to change. 🤷‍♀️
---
I think I have some vanguard stuff - L45/50 - not sure if its the robot type though.
---
I should be on after midnight EST tonight.  
---
psn aj ninetyeight
---
I hear you and yes some data mining can be too much. I personally just avoid those posts when I don't want to know.   
---
However,  I do not know the extent of what these people were talking about, but a lot of the information about the scout quests was released by Bethesda yesterday here - [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4aSpwjqqwDZqD3JD6ecTT/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-pioneer-scouts-and-backpacks-april-25-2019](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4aSpwjqqwDZqD3JD6ecTT/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-pioneer-scouts-and-backpacks-april-25-2019)
---
Hmm then I retract my statement, was pretty sure I was able to damage the Brahman
---
Unfortunately no, PS4
---
I went in the bunker entrance that you have to use the first time you start the enclave quest line. You go past where your ID photo is taken to where you first properly meet MODUS, there's a MODUS terminal and through the big glass window is the mainframe my photo included both.
---
You will for sure be approached by a high level player shortly after leaving the vault. They will drop a paper bag for you and either shoot it or teabag it. Pick it up, there’s useful items in it that’ll make starting out a little easier.
---
I’m simple, I’m a bloodied melee and if there are others in the area farming or in an event, I use my fists. Punch to da nose and then move away. Stick and jab and then back off. Unless I see they’re dying then I’ll get between the hurt players and the mobs.
---
If a molerat or ghoul dies in your camp, you could temporarily use it for storage. :-)
---
5% per hit, for up to ten hits. It re-sets if you miss or re-load. So if you have less than ten rounds, you won't get a full advantage on your weapon.
---
Yep my super sledge is doing that too, drives me nuts
---
Yes sir. 
---
Yes sir.
---
There meat bags full
---
Thanks for the info.
---
I have no idea, honestly. Just testing the waters here.
---
Need more pictures!
---
If you still haven't found one in 4 hours I can make you one for just the flux when I get off work  :)
---
Maybe it's just because I didn't like it in Fallout 4, but I'm perfectly fine with how the game quickly dispenses with the whole "Let's rebuild America!" motif and replaces it with the more cynical premise of trying to contain a plague no one anticipated.
---
I’d love if they would give us the ability to upgrade the turrets we currently have. It’s crazy how the turrets in AMS headquarters can shred my PA but a handful of mutants can crash my base full of heavy lasers.
---
The game hasn’t changed. It’s still, fundamentally, the same game. It’s been tweaked and improved, but the mechanics, plot and graphics are all still the same. If you didn’t like it then, why would you like it now?
---
best resource for Treasure Maps I've seen!
---
Good work overall, thanks for sharing
---
Yeah I try to plug my ears so I don't hear it, but I feel like there was kind of an unwritten decorum until recently in nerd culture that you would actively try to not spoil things for other fans. I guess times are changing... Makes me feel old
---
Thanks too all for your answers :)
---
Early game playing solo is easier because having teammates steal your xp (Kills arent shared unless damaged by all team members) and generally rushing/Not doing what you want to do.
---
"Endgame" tho is a lot more fun with friends
---
Yeah. To be fair people generally DO protect them, I just think most folks genuinely dont realize that defending the brahmin doesnt stop mattering once Sheepsquatch appears.
---
People say 5% up to 30%, or 5% up to 50%. Some say a miss resets the escalation. Others say that only hitting another creature resets it. Accurate first-hand testing and/or data-mined proof seems to be lacking. 
---
I have a furious handmade, and I've tried to test, but without controlled PvP testing, it's nearly impossible to tell in PvE. The 5% increments are just too small to make sense of it. It does something, but darned if I can tell exactly what.
---
Ah.I see. Told you I'm not an expert. 🙂 Well, if it's working. I wouldn't worry about what others are running around with. Do what works for you.
---
I could be wrong, but I don't think the pipe revolver rifle comes with legendary effects though, does it? Seeing what legendaries you can get for your weapon can be fun.
---
Maybe you can play around with some other types of rifles and agility perks and see what you get. I have a hybrid rifle / melee build. So I only have one point in each rifleman card. With one point in bloody mess and whatever other things in my build, I can get 98-110 dmg on my lever action (I have an anti armor and a troubleshooters). And slightly less on my two shot handmade. I would think with your maxed rifleman and a different weapon, you could do much better than I have. I'll wait for an expert to weigh in though. You probably would enjoy the grind a bit more if you had a chance for a legendary weapon.
---
lol yeah they are really rare. It took me a few days of trying, but then again I'd only hop for maybe an hour or two at a time before I gave up for the day. The ironic thing is that I was actually only really looking for deep pocketed leather limbs at the time (which I eventually found randomly after I gave up). So maybe try faking the universe out and be like "Boy, I hope it's more Lead Line Trapper armor plans" and see if that works hehe.
---
Its to 9 in 76 then.
---
I got 1 str on my pistol build and get boosted up to 9
---
So it works like the freefall legs from fallout 4?
---
A stimpak isn't a get out of jail free card.  If you're taking a ton of damage, you have the option to use the stim to create a retreat, but if you're still getting smashed it's not going to mitigate massive damage without being perked up properly.  I hate the saying "git gud", but maybe don't wade into a pile of enemies assuming an auto-stim armor piece is going to save you.  My sniper guy can kill most anything in the game with a headshot, but I'm not going to do well charging into a pack of glowing ghouls.
---
The only time I'm watching my health bar like a hawk is during the Encryptid event.  To make the event fun and easier for everyone, I'll grab as many pylons as I can after swapping out perks to equip two ranks of Chem Fiend (endurance), three ranks of First Aid (intelligence) and Field Surgeon in Charisma.  Between all three perks I might use 5-6 stims for the duration of the event, even while getting health-sapped constantly with triple pylon pain.  I also use three ranks of refractor (perception) for +30 energy resist, but I don't actually know if it helps.  I grab the pylons, run to the shack, jump on top of it, get a couple hits on the Impostor and eliminate trash mobs while watching my health.  If I die while maintaining all pylons, the event becomes pure chaos for a while, so I do my best not to.  I don't try to shoot the Impostor too much, because getting her aggro suuuucks and there's usually plenty of able-bodied participants that have no problem laying down good DPS.
---
That someone would be ignorant enough to downvote this is part of what makes me angry.
---
Welcome to PC gaming.
---
I play Final Fantasy XI (an MMO) still and the moment the servers come back online, everyone knows every single new or changed thing added to the game. About five minutes after that, all new items are plugged into a spreadsheet to determine if they are even worth getting.
---
I was really careful at first, too.  Then I accidentally shot Earl in the face while spazzing on a pile of Bloodbugs and thankfully he was fine.
---
I like to lay land mines all over the public event areas and snipe from the roof tops. #pvp
---
Start the jukebox (and only, the jukebox) and just let it play. The longer the event runs, the more chance you have at a 1-3* ghoul spawning in for a crowned one. I only play the instruments if  the timer is already under 5 minutes.
---
If I'm solo, I start it playing, crouch on top of the partial wall directly across from the jukebox, and shoot ghouls as they run towards it. If you're melee, you can just crouch on top of it and do the same.
---
Thats true, but Encyptid still tends to be a shit show from time to time. Also I know I should be more patient- and I’m trying to be- but also I reeeeally want the Sheepsquatch staff
---
This doesn't seem to be registering for me. One of the trading like terminals ?
---
Good to know, hopefully we can get proof on this via legendary vault trader by putting Furious on a low lvl gun then but hope it doesn't count misses.
---
I could not target them.  It's possible that it was a bug related to not being a "part of the event" even though you "joined event".  Kinda like that one random guy with the white name over his toon at SBQ.  It happens every so often.
---
Thanks, I'm not sure why I'm currently fixated on adding a shotgun, I think it's just I used one early game and up close the pump action shotgun had a higher capacity in close quarters that the pipe revolver rifle but with similar fire rates. You're probably right that I should go with a semi-auto combat, but I've never been able to get the initial ballistic damage to be anything about 90ish but I guess a higher DPS would offset this. Maybe I'm too focused on the initial damage numbers rather than the actual output damage once perks and everything else is taken into account.
---
I also didn't realise that the concentrated fire 3* perk only gave me an additional 4% damage boost so will definitely change that for the 2 extra perks straight up. 
---
I do have an anti-armor hunting rifle but I always find the fire rate to be a little to slow, especially in closer quarters.
---
Lol
---
You have posted every hour for days , dont think your going to find these items
---
This could also work with morgantown airport and the enclave bunker. Great idea.
---
A missed opportunity.  Best of luck to you, though!
---
Tenacity is an important thing, without it I definitely won't find them.
---
I've read several posts indicating most will level your camp without hesitation if you're at whitespring.
---
Argument is your turrets will target all the ghouls, thus leaving very little for those there to fight the ghouls for xp, materials and legendaries.
---
Don't read spoilers if you don't want spoilers.
---
I’ve been wondering if it was the weapon I was using or just me, but I’ve had some difficulty with this as well. Couple this with Vats 0%ing far too often within range and it’s getting more difficult to do melee. 
---
My thinking is that it’s Bethesda’s way of balancing melee vs. guns
---

guess this is photoshopped to
---
Recommend using a Tesla Rifle to tag all them greenies ✌🏼
---
A skill-based minigame would be a nice change of pace, that's for sure.
---
Hey you could always visit Cancún
---
It's the same game you played before, on slightly better servers.
---
It's very cool.  I'm hoping for legendary drops so I can use it on my melee character.  I'm largely ok with difficult to find items, as it keeps me coming back with a goal and purpose day after day.  Persistence always pays off eventually, and the reward is so much sweeter when it's really rare.
---
Maybe it's that good old Fasnacht parade logic at work again!
---
Get a full unyielding with bloodied weapon
---
The mods themselves are labeled as junk? Would make sense, not much looks ready other than stats and atomic shop placeholders. The texture they're using looks reused from somewhere as well, I can't put my finger on it though.
---
I like how the items are labeled "DONTPLACE" in all caps. I'm betting there's a story behind that.
---
Nvm, Xbox
---
Found the guy who intentionally handicaps himself and blames others for not doing the same.
---
Because maybe cool things have been added
---
Isn't it the flatwoods monster?
---
Complete the questline with the taxidermy
---
Well you don’t need to ask us that, just check the Bethesda.net.
---
No worries at all, as I say, I'm no expert either and looking for any help I can get and it's nice to hear that 200 damage is decent :)
---
I don't know if the pipe revolver comes in legendary format so might have to do some additional research on this. If it doesn't I guess I'll have to look at changing it up as people seem to be in agreement that it's not a bad build, just not an end game build and that's where I'm getting too.
---
Nope :( that’s one of the 9 as well
---
It has been a while, but I don't think so as the Silo won't let you in till you are a General.
---
I just got mine from a Census Violence event I believe
---
Ya can't repeat it. Once it's done, it's done.
---
the number of times I have died with full health......
---
I also don't have much time to play - what I did was save up about 18k caps and bought a serum recipe from the science vendors in the enclave bunker. They're relatively cheap to craft, the only really rare thing you need is flux. 
---
It's perfect for a day where I only have about 10 minutes to log on for whatever reason, or only have an hour or two and would like to spend minimal time devoted to caps. Craft three and sell for 450 each to hit close to the daily max. 
---
Also max out super duper perk if you haven't - that's useful for anything you'll be crafting and selling.
---
Go to a high level super mutant spawn and farm it, collect everything, religiously, repeat, walk to vendor.
---
While doing a Nuke Zone yesterday, I did come across a Scorched Mongrel wearing the Dog Armor.
---
Was it someone by the name of Katsumi Wave?
---
Taking pictures of any MODUS terminal didn't work for me - I had to go to Robotics (it is near the Service entrance), and take a picture of the big blue object in the middle of a room, flanked by sentry bots.
---
Been playing since Jan - probably 95% solo.  
---
the other 5% is teaming up with a few people I know IRL, or when I dont have a particular goal for the play session,  I may find a lower lower level player and follow wherever they want to explore - give them a hand if needed, help them navigate new areas, answer questions about critters, weapons, places, etc.
---
But to the question - So far, have not done anything that absoluely required a team.  There are a few things/events where other people around help, but you likely wont need to ask - they'll just show up. (for example: after you launch a nuke, or the fachnacht parade)
---
just FYI, 45 pipe revolver hasn't, as yet, been fixed to where it drops legendary variants. Your best bet that's closest to your current play style, sadly, is a good legendary .38 pipe rifle.
---

---
If you want to play around with them, I can make you a starter handmade and starter lever action. I only recently got the plans and am saving up screws to start scrapping a bunch for more mods  -- I only have a few (so no suppressor yet). Someone else I know (or someone here) might be able to mod it up though. I'm not sure. I'll have to ask around.
---
Hmu if you want. Just add a little note so I know who you are.
---
PSN - chakra_bender
---
I don't think you can get past the hand-print scanner on the elevator to get into the silo. Being in a group doesn't bypass that hand scanner.
---
Group/Team weapons: Tesla Rifle, Syringer, Flamer,Cryolator,Molotovs,Paddle Ball.
---
Random side question, does using perks like Wasteland Whisperer count as a tag on a kill?
---
The white spring vendor. And the factory over by posiden.
---
On my fourth build I finally tried a non-pa, unyielding bloodied PF build. Insanely fun. Die all the time in SBQ events, but the crazy amount of damage is a blast.
---
its not for every one none of my irl friends like it
---
U can shoot something once with the  weapon with the furious prefix and check the damage difference between pre and post shot when you look at the item in the pipboy
---
People downvote because they refuse to believe in user error. While i do believe a bug exists, i don't believe all cases are caused by it. 
---
I can't tell you how many times my buddy gets frustrated saying something isn't working, stupid game and it's bugs only to have her shoot me some screenshots and walk her through process step by step and find out it's user error. 
---
It's no doubt this game is riddled with bugs, which makes it easy to mistakenly attribute some user error to bugs.
---
I'd honestly day forget the pipe revolver. 
---
For my sniper I use a hunting rifle for long range sneak hits to soften them up (because it has crazy long range) then a lever action for midrange (better fire rate) 
---
What you really need are some legendaries my friend. An instigating hunting rifle from sneak (and using the bonus sneak damage perks) will instantly wipe just about anything before it even has a chance to react.
---
I would love it if the factory could be a workshop for producing Nuka Colas! But then there’s the issue of each one giving a cap when you drink it...
---
once more, louder for those at the back...
---
workshops are a choice. And that choice is "I am now willing to engage in PvP for higher rewards than I would get otherwise".
---
If you take a workshop, then jump servers to avoid PvP… it's YOU that is exploiting the system.
---
Don't want to engage in PvP? Then take the slow steady route of farming junk. Want to do it faster by taking a workshop? With that comes higher risk.
---
Something else to consider, is the lack of armor piercing options for the pipe rifle, which is where most of the dmg to SB's and mutants comes from.
---
A base hunting rifle with a perforating mag, will do about 40% dmg per hit more than the pipe revolver, at half the cost in perks. A secondary hardened handmade with a perforating mag is comparable in dmg to the pipe revolver, with a 3x bigger mag, better sighting options, and faster fire rate.
---
Thank you very much, never knew this was a setting
---
Before patch 8 it all had info in the files. Now it's all labeled as deprecated
---
Looks great for being a small space. My favorite camps are usually built on pre-existing structures like broken houses, or my personal favorite is the monorails  with cars suspended still.
---
I was testing in between 2 accounts accounts in PvP. It stopped increasing damage at about 10 hits, and my health-damage went up by more like 65%, but I was wearing armor, and we all know the more damage you do the more armor you pierce, so the “paper damaged” increase is probably more like 50%. 
---
I also deliberately missed a couple shots into the ground. The counter did not reset/damage stayed at its current level. I did NOT test actually hitting a different target.
---
predinator?
---
He gets really lucky with that sometimes. One of his videos had 5 legendarys just outside.
---
It doesn’t per my testing in patch 6. I hit the ground a couple times, damage boost did not reset.
---
yeah, it is. and i think you forgot to add in the players on the map.
---
No you can’t going to a silo if you’re not an officer and every silo is the exact same
---
Yup. Only good on low damage/high ROF weapons. Furious sniper rifles... lol :P
---
Yes, I think Census Violence can give that mod plan, but keep your expectations low. You can do scores of events without getting a particular plan.
---
Thanks, but it's really not.  I just scrolled through "new" one day a week or so ago and made note of a few threads.  I've posted it several times since then in threads like this.  I could probably update that with two dozen newer ones on the same topic.  
---
Posting it doesn't seem to make a dent in the amount of people making new threads to ask the same question, though.  The mods oughtta make a weekly sticky with "Current State of the Game" or something.
---
Some people may also have mutations / armor that are increasing their strength + damage
---
You will need to complete the enclave quest chain yourself up to launching a nuke, you will otherwise not be able to enter any silo.
---
Silo runs are usually best done solo if you have the gear. Less spawns and far less laggy quest updates. Turning off turrets in a team if you're less equipped is a solid idea.
---
There are no discernible differences from what I've seen.
---
But if everyone uses that mentality, then nobody would do the event. Maybe if you would've went, more players would've went too.
---
Honestly, it's very little cost to repair as opposed to destroyed settlements in 4, aside from the rad shower.  Steel, wood, concrete, etc is literally everywhere.
---
True but first got to get my hands on furious gun first lol.
---
Meh. I'd be down for a FalloutPLus,  similar to ESO plus.
---
I see no issue with it.
---
Sent. I appreciate it!
---
*Note to self: Include Nuka Colas along with Quantums in player vending machine*
---
Having a notebook would work :) like you keep a list of what stuff you have in a notebook ECT.
---
Thank you.
---
Yes, as in walking in certain places the terrain will change colors and a cple times building straight won’t load in and there’s just empty nothingness.
---
No that wasn't their Xbox live name
---
The Sheepsquatch loves to not drop legendaries.
---
I would like at least a 50 photo increase - I really have to decide what I want pictures of now because I only have 3-4 spaces left and I've had to delete so many. Sure we can take screen shots of them but you don't get those as a loading screen anymore if you delete them. I remember the first day the game came out - I took so many pictures and ran into the limit and I was like... oh :( So I don't even have pics from my reclamation day anymore because I ended up having to remove them for new memories.
---
Ok.  All excellent points.  I've used cry o but not the pumpkin, will have to see about those.
---
Lol true
---
PErsonally think there should be tiers just two PLus and supporter.  
---
Plus is 10 dollars a month, supporter is 20.  
---
plus gives 500 atoms a week, supporter 750.  
---
plus gives 1 free item under 600 a month. Supporter allows you to sellect that item instead of it being random?  
---
Plus gives some symbol next to name (can be disabled in options) supporter gives a fancier one (can also be disabled.)
---
I know for a fact the game can bug and “grab” something else when scrapping or moving things rapidly. I was transferring junk to a paper bag to have an alt pick it up and I saw something “else” flash by on the screen. For the record i was in the junk tab of the inventory screen. I switch through the other tabs and lo and behold, there’s a couple hundred rounds of ammo in the bag now as well. There’s no “normal” way that could have happened- it’s the same speed bug that was causing people to lose items into Mama Dolce’s or the Lighthouse during the moth man event.
---
I'll let my lvl 160 that never uses PA know about that :P  
---
But yeah if it's a low lvl item and has low durability that might be the issue.  One cool tip is you can max your int and craft items with better durability, though at the end of the day you will want legendary items and for those iirc it's luck that governs durability (high luck increases found item durability).    
---
If any of the above is wrong, lemme know :)
---
Yea unyielding jacks up the strength even more, also make sure you’re not running any mutations that take strength away like eagle eye. Also get a strengthen or protective under armor for even more strength.
---
Marine tactical helmet, as had been said, but the best place to farm the plans is in the traincar just E of the NRA railyard. Marine armor plans, and the wetsuit/helmet all spawn inside it on a crate.
---
It's easy to get confused over the difference between hard quitting the game app and landing on the Home screen. You can end up on the home screen with the game is still running. The only way to actually close the app is to use the Quit menu option. The game's status should change from "Resume" to "Launch". If the game's status remains "Resume", then the game did not quit. You can't quit the game from within the game, you must quit it via Home Button=&gt;Options=&gt;Quit ... It's the only way. The reason it's not working for some might be that they think they've quit the game, but they haven't. 
---
Quitting always worked for me for to see the newest egg. Since we're now past the eggs promotion, this is more for FYI for any future daily Atom Store freebies like the eggs.
---
Does the weapon damage actually increase once you repair past 100% for the axe?
---
You have to be an Enclave officer to get in.  The handprint scanner won't work unless you are.  All three silos are basically the same.  Having Rank 3 Picklock and Hacker will let you bypass the reactor (although depending on how good/lucky you are at hacking, it's not always faster).
---
There is a shortcut you can open between the supply room and the area where you need to fix the Mainframe Cores. You may consider opening that to make it easier to return if someone dies.
---
It's a good idea to bring more than one Nuclear Keycard, just in case you fumble the launch code.  The number is accepted or declined when you enter the last digit, so make sure you double-check it before then!
---
Whoever inserts the Nuclear Keycard drives the whole launch process unless they flub the code.  You can't slide your card and have your friend specify a target. 
---
Some players like to poach missile silos. As the final defense winds down, make your way to the card slider so you can use it thr first moment you can.
---
Yeah, it's awesome for getting help on events or for getting heads up on when events are about to happen on other servers.
---
A perk in intelligence allows you to repair weapons to double durabilty which increases damage
---
lmao my dude its a literal video but its ok if you dont belive it heres another one for you. now with infinite ap. this used with doggy makes you imortal
---
https://youtu.be/0PG49ZU2xmI
---
Ugh .. that kind of puts a taint on my point. Yes, it was mostly this. I didn't read this till now. Maybe I should change the title to we have a Bethesda problem haha
---
If I'm not in PA, I'm naked with chameleon! Well, wearing the bathing suit...
---
Have you tried taking a photo of the remnants located at Black Mountain Ordnance yet?
---
Cool. Yeah I have done both but never saw it on the bodies when looting or when you see the rewards after completing the quest
---
Cuz it’s easier to find and cheaper :)
---
Well KatsumiWave is the one who attacked me. He killed me three times before I could reject the Reclaim workshop quest and message him. He then proceeded to go on about free enterprise and about how Survival mode doesn't pay well.
---
Yep, didn’t work either.
---
no problem I will probably be on later tonight - around 8 pm EST or so.
---
Thats good to know.
---
This is true, I can always hear PA coming...
---
Upvoting because I agree everyone who reads his content comes away with a slightly different interpretation. I think it aligns with a specific reading bias 
---
Thank you for a thoughtful discussion and my suggestion is validated. 
---
Bring us Cthulhu and his/her minions! Lolz
---
I figured this was done on purpose to stop you from moving it a ton. But idk.
---
I hate this community
---
I'm already at the opposite end, with my calibrated shocks (on my non excavator) I become overencumbered when getting out of my PA. Having even more carry via backpacks wouldn't change this for me.
---
I'd happily buy'em all from you if you're on PS4 :P
---
That's awesome :) thanks for clarifying.
---
How do i go about to get such an underarmour?
---
That’s ok, we’re not too fond of you either.
---
As a novice programmer, I agree
---
I am.
---
I usually vendor all of mine except for Quantums.
---
Sadly I have none at the moment lol
---
ppl already tried the toy alien and the one in the back of a truck, nada
---
Had a guy on xbox one shooting everything in uranium fever with a combat knife. I dont understand how he was but either way I was hoping to power level in the event. Sent the dude a message saying dude let us get some hits in before you kill them and his response was. "I one hit sooo." Plus he was in a PA so he would just completely block doors into the room that enemies were pouring through. Didn't even let people get hits on the legendaries.
---
Can you show me on a picture where this is?
---
What platform are you on? I can make you one for free if Xbox. If not most people can sell the protective one. It’s from a plan learned. The marine wetsuit, BOS offers, Knight, and Soldier are just a few. All outfits cover them if you don’t like the look.
---
Yeah, I recall seeing those, I just assumed that was for testing and they've moved to the curve table for the weight enhancements. Junk is a good descriptor for depreciated.
---
The "5% up to 50%" claim is the most consistent with what I've seen myself.  It certainly has a cap, because I've never seen it get anywhere close to double damage, and it's pretty hard to see improvement in subsequent hits.
---
I guess I have to wonder, is the Gatling Plasma just so good that even a non-legendary should be standard equipment for a heavy user tackling big baddies?
---
Gotta get all those poopy 1* weapons and armor lol
---
I would like to officially request Bethesda sell the Sheepsquatch plushie IRL.
---
Happened to a group Saturday morning right after I logged in . They couldn't reduce her health and she flew over to the Flooded Train Yard and hovered there.  They all gave up and went on after the Event timed out. 1-1/2 hours later, my group decided to nuke prime and after launch we all went to site.  A couple of the guys started asking why there was a Queen already there before nuke strike. We never broke server so it had to be the same glitched Queen from earlier.  Nuke hit and we had 2 Queens.  We killed them both with 15 minutes left and both gave rewards. Seen 2 Queens from overlapping nukes, but nothing like this.
---
Feel free to msg me when you have some, my PSN is the same as my user here.
---
I'm with you on this, a TSE handmade is not going to "blow away" anything  1 shot anymore unless it's so low level as to be irrelevant anyway.
---
When I'm at major events, SBQ, imposter, AWOL. I'm one of the few high levels to actually be doing damage to the main boss. There just isn't time to swap back and forth to low level weapons. Nor should I have to pay in hits/stimpacks for someone unable to even contribute to the fight. If I see a 3* deathclaw running around I'll turn and pop it, but mainly I HAVE to keep focused on the boss
---
Okay thanks, im on pc though:)
---
I know right. Bethesda should build a giant wall.
---
Np man
---
I do a podcast for Fallout 76 and when we record we use the area chat - so, it's kind of like if someone stumbles across us they also find the show. I really really wish Bethesda would allow the radio towers to be claimable and usable. That would be the best!
---
I've complained about this before, and have been told several times that it is: 
---
1. A scaling system based upon your level. (False, I get this on level 10 characters, and level 125 characters.)
---
2. A multiplier based upon how long you were in your old camp location. (False. Camp moving costs are designed to get *cheaper* the longer you are in one location, not more expensive. Developers have backed this up.)
---
3. A 'tax' added based upon your overall camp budget. (False. This multiplier happens when my camp budget is full OR empty.)
---
It's been this way since release, I've complained about it and submitted bug reports, never been fixed. Dunno why.
---
That’s obviously a bug. When it happened to me I got a bunch of harpoons back but no other ammo or loot, as if I shot a dead corpse.
---
Is it possible you could scale the icons with zoom? 
---
It's near unusable when zoomed out you cant actually see the map.
---
If they acted like the fusion core generator, I don't think it would be a problem at all. 8 nukas/h isn't that much...
---
This. I like to give them all a nice whack from All Rise, usually leaves about 1/4 of their health so others can get a shot in. Really good for low levels so they can wipe them out without using all their ammo while still getting their chance for xp and gear.
---
Right.  You'll only notice it on fast weapons and/or enemies with lots of HP.
---
Seems that way
---
LOL. I was pleased to see the new PA skins were coming and saved my Atoms. I bought Plague Rider yesterday.
---
 Some of us like data mining the game for just this kind of thing. It would have been not fun to try to accumulate that many Atoms in a hurry and i will not buy them. ;)
---
Not sure if Trump joke, or serious.
---
If serious... Not a wall... but a more sensible physical barrier than a low wire fence. And make it match the visible map... It's a bummer to head off on an adventure and discover that nothing is there
---
Yup, plenty do. Some cheaper than others. Some will even craft for free if provided supplies. All depends how soon you need them and if you're willing to wait around and invest the time to find that bargain.
---
That being said, i have on me carnivore, eagle eyes, scaly skin, speed demon,marsupial, twisted muscles. 350caps a piece sound good? Or like i said, if not in rush, see if someone else has them.
---
People are losing items?
---
Asshole
---
Yep happened to two experienced buddies. Same situation it randomly threw a weapon in the bag and they were always in the junk tab.
---
...if you're doing a melee build, you should be running a full set of unyielding legendary armor for extra damage. 
---
You can get a bunch of 1* pretty cheap.
---
I found it at the water park second try and keep seeing it.
---
I actually have an anti-armor hunting rifle which ignores 50% of the targets armor with a perforating mag. I just always got frustrated by the slow reload speed. I guess I'm too focused on the numbers on display for damage which isn't the actual output that a weapon is necessarily giving. I think the consensus is to ditch the pipe revolver and go with a handmade which I'm starting to think I will look into.
---
No, you wont be able to activate the elevator.
---
You need to be a general in the army, and this involves finishing the enclave quest where you need to kill 10 legendaries or scorched beasts.
---
I sell bulk mats, I have a copper and steel node at my camp with a lead deposit not to far off so I have many options to sell. That or sell guns from drops
---
A little of both. What would you design to keep players out that spans the perimeter of the map?
---
Yea definitely, in his vid you can see skills and configuration do matter, while most youtubers just blast everything with explosive weapon and ‘look i can one shot them with this but you can’t’
---
I’m one of those asshats in PA with tse shotguns.  The most fun for me in this game is to cripple glowing ones in a nuke zone for other people to finish off.  There are a lot of people that play this game that don’t know about tse guns, or reddit, or the legendary dilemmas.    Several times I’ve been like some deranged pied piper leading three or four people around, me jumping around and jet packing, laying out ghouls for them to bludgeon.  On chat they’re like “what fucking gun is that” oohing and aawing and laughing uncontrollably as I revel in the ultra violence.   That’s the juice for me, a sea of glowing ghouls with their legs all mangled, writhing around helplessly, and 3 level 25s bludgeoning them to death with terrible melee weapons.   I like to think the ghouls look over to me between board strikes and ask, “why dude.....why?”
---
All those PEBKAC bugs
---
I too have had a HUGE uptick of griefers in adventure the past week.
---
I would love this also! At least on the PS4 if I delete any photos from the photo gallery in the game they are still saved in the screen shots folder on the PlayStation hard drive. While the deleted photos will no longer appear as loading screens, at least I still have access to them to share.
---
I think the best thing a group is good for, is having someone to help you store shit on alts lol. I group now and then with people requesting help, and my brother, but most of the time I'm doing my own thing even when I'm in a group.
---
I'm having the same problems, and it seems to be worse on slow connections (currently on work travel, using my PS4 in hotel WiFi)
---
This is very helpful. Thank you!
---
Yup, hard part is proving it. Some bugs are easy to replicate while others not so much. Which makes it difficult for dev team to track down what the cause may be (if any)...
---
Thanks, I have an anti-armor hunting rifle so I might look at getting some additional sneak damage perks and then look into a secondary weapon. Lots of people are saying a handmade rifle but what's the reload speed like on the lever action? Is it any good for close range stuff (i.e. being mobbed by ghouls in Whitesprings).
---
I also use WiFi because of university set up and I think that plays a role for sure.
---
It's not our fault the game has bad design and there is no area tagging like in other games of its type.
---
I'm not going to carry around weak weapons when I barely have any space left.
---
As someone who’s spent two days not finding one yet, that would be greatly appreciated.
---
Like I said... canyons, cliffwalls, quicksand, acid baths, mudslides... or... hell, keep the "nope, can't go any further" as it is, *but make it the edge of the damn map*. 
---
This is more about my disappointment at finding out the whole map isn't explorable, than it is about the actual barrier.
---
It sure does, I notice that on my cable connection too, but textures does load faster when I'm at home.
---
Go visit Biv daily for more brewing recipes. For the mounted heads, do the Lying Lowe quest and associated side quests.
---
Do you have any source for that?
---
The other problem with legendaries in an SBQ fight is that you'll probably never find the body after. It'll either despawn or blend into the tall grass so well you never see it. When I see the legendaries during the fight, I tag it a few times, try to alert other people... but you can only wait so long.
---
I’ll get on about 6pm CST
---
I can make you a Marsupial serum if you have a Crimson Flux. Sadly everything I do needs them and never have one left over! My PSN ID is the same here.
---
Lol I was kidding but.. yes. Maybe a “How to form your own opinion” sticky as well
---
Heh, yeah, guess that’s true. I know I certainly felt triumphant when I finally got the Hunter’s Long Coat.

Really?! a starter handmade and lever action would be cool to play around with. I won't be on tonight as the wife has the PS4, but I'll send you a request tomorrow and we'll hopefully meet up. My PSN is Hereistrev.
---
Yeah and sorry about double xp weekend I’m blasting fucking everything haha
---
My personal experience and YT videos, like for example Captainoob when he's showcasing weapons.
---
Turn on pacifist mode and use the tesla rifle. Just shoot the guy blocking you. They'll still act as a conduit and hit the other ghouls in the area.
---
I completely agree, and this is still my single biggest complaint with the game. I was genuinely surprised back during the Beta when I started playing on a Team and realized we *didn't* share XP - so many other games do it, and it's such an *obvious* mechanic, that I'd just assumed it'd be the same way here, too. And this has been a common issue and request since launch... I can't understand why they haven't done anything about it.
---
 I am old and I have no problem with data mining the game. Its not new you know. Don't look if you don't want to see!
---
I would be interested in buying a couple of these off of you. I am looking for Scaly Skin, Speed Demon, and Twisted Muscles. I will be on later tonight if you are around. Is your PSN ID the same as here?
---
Glass respawns daily at Whitesprings, sometimes twice a day if you server hop enough. Whitesprings compound (especially the golf course) has TONS of glass. I mean just stupid amounts of glass. Also napkins and newspapers, so lots of cloth to pick up there. Golf balls provide plenty of plastic, hairbrushes, toothbrushes, and cue balls off the ghoul kills, cue balls off the pool tables, provide enough plastic to bundle.  
---
Then I server hop Flatwoods and murder all 9 Brahmin in that area. There is fox hide adjacent from the weapons bench (other side of the wall), two radstags that hang up, two dead static brahamin that usually give meat and hide. A bit back up the road is a radstag, dead static that gives hide and meat too.  
---
So 7-9 cows x 24 worlds (1 hour work, sometimes some cows are dead) = (x7) 168 cows. 168 hides x 4 leather per hide = 672 leather. Union Hats require 2 leather per hat, so that's 336 hats (x10 caps per hat = 3,360 caps) THEN you usually get 2-4 brahmin meat's per kill, so lets figure low and say 168 cows x 2 meat per cow = 336 ribeye steaks. Can get 11 caps (charisma maxed) per ribeye steak so 336x11=3,696 just in ribeye steaks.  
---
If I REALLY want to turn up the juice, I can make about 14,000 caps in like 4 hours. If I REALLY buckle down and push hard.
---
How about you can keep walking, but eventually 15 orbital strikes hit you at the same time after 10 seconds out of bounds?
---
Thanks! :)
---
And btw. Are nukes broken? Saw no nukes since a week
---
Ah, lame
---
Remember how that caused people to accidentally scrap their pipboy and lost all the pipboy menus as a result? Whatever happened with that, was that eventually fixed?
---
I have had this issue since a few patches ago. Yesterday no matter what server I was in the Giant Teapot would not load in, everything inside would tho. I could walk right past where the walls should have been to the boilers. Also get the problem a lot inside of buildings with furniture not loading, or at WS with cars not loading in and having floating junk all over.
---
Dyer Chemical has about 4 nuka vending machines.
---
Red Rocket Mega Stop has 5 nuka vending machines.
---
Also spawn at Welch up the hill from the train station by the row of houses.
---
Lvl 193 (plus a lvl 150-something alt) and still haven't found that damn thing.  I'm not mad.  It'll happen eventually.  The game's only 6 months old.  Took me three years to have nothing left to do in Dungeons and Dragons Online.
---
What was your ticket regarding?
---
Which is a shame since I got a pretty good 3* Tesla Rifle from that, but it's Level 40
---
Here's hoping you can raise the level with the new vendor
---
I've been playing since sunday and I have seen like a dozen + nukes so far, on ps4.
---
golf clap my good sir
---
They're so afraid of players "abusing the system" by having a low level get carried through content. There are so many better ways to do that though, if they really want to. For example, in Path of Exile if you have a high level joining a low level, the low level gets an exp penalty unless the high level player "downscales" their stats. That makes the content of the lower level still be somewhat of a challenge for the high level, and they can both enjoy playing together regardless of difficulty. 
---
Also, if they really don't want players to abuse the system, then they need to remove the more egregious power leveling methods, like the vertibird repair / killing. They have to know about that - it's been there since launch, yet they've done nothing about it.
---
I’ve seen one up in a Deathclaw spawn, a little East of the Top of the World.

---
My 100% PA Bloody/Explosive Shotgun build. I solo solos without issue.  I can tank Sheep Squatch Pylons with minimal effort and the SBQ dies quickly.  Only thing I won’t do is nuke zone farming as it’s too tedious in Bloody.  I’ll switch out Nerd Rage/Dodgy for other perks and run a different gun for nuke zone farming.  I Use XO 1 PA with Emergency Protocol attached.
---
PSA Explosive pellets for shotguns keep the spread tight, shotguns can reach out and touch mid to long range mobs with explosive effects.
---
Awh, maybe some day. They need to fix this as well as not being able to places items on all shelves.
---
*Bethesda
---
Join the club... I've had some open for a couple months. All i ever get is a generic update everytime they release a patch. Something along the lines of "We just did maintenance which can sometimes address some issues, please check  to see that your problem still exists"...
---
game said it was multiplayer right on the box. sorry
---
Missed out on a 3-star today to someone with a deathclaw gauntlet.
---
I used hunting rifles for a long time, but the lever action, hands down, outperforms it, even without AP mag options.
---
If you're on XB, and want to try any out, I can craft modded versions for free.
---
Mind if I message you as well?  Think I had 100/10 nuka and quantum taking up space.... I’m not sure why...
---
I was about to say the same thing
---
Fast Travel to Miner's Monument and there's one on the opposite side of the road just a bit to the North.
---
Not on PC, I saw one yesterday.
---
yawn
---
I told a guy to screw off and play survival and he literally told me it was because he wasn’t good enough...pacifist should just mean 100% no PVP under any circumstances how frickin hard is that
---
up to 50%?  I read here before it was only up to 30% at 5% per hit.  please do correct me if that's wrong.  I would live to have it be higher
---
If it's client side how does that work when say, you've cleared defiance and have BoS in there but your teammate hasn't?  
---
Your teammate is fighting ghouls you can't see?  You are talking to BoS npc's your teammate can't see?
---
Haven’t been checking that one, will add it to tonight’s run.
---
Gracias!
---
^
---
Do backpacks take up the chest piece slot or are they separate?
---
&gt;They don't seem to care
---
Do you want them to throw a parade in your honor or name a school after you or some shit?
---
Maybe try a different attitude..
---
if they do that, It'd be nice if they did it for Hazmat Suits as well.
---
Quick sell a bunch of bulk items to a vendor by mashing the sell button.  You will see your stack of 10 Bulk Cloth pops up as a sale of 7 then there is 3 left and then a sale of 3, etc etc through your items.  You'd think if you select a stack with 10 items it would sell it as 10 but its like it is individually transferring each one over in the background.
---
I get on mic and tell them shit like "I think it's past your bedtime, you seem grumpy little one"
---
Alien in the TNT dome? Anyone try that?
---
Yup, same as here. However I've been told by some they can't find me. I'll have to look into my privacy settings at some point. Anyway, shoot me a message with your psn when you're online and i should be able add you and hop on.
---
\* laughs in 4k bloodied \*
---
I agree with you 100% on this. There have been times I have wanted things from the Atom Shop, but I will not spend $15 on a skin.   
---
But sadly I do not think they will ever decrease it as I see people all the time who have everything, so they have people spending the money. I just try my best to bank up atoms from the daily and weekly challenges. And even then I often just buy items that are limited time only. As most of the stuff I wanted that wasn't limited time has gone on sale - sometimes upwards of 70% off.
---
How about after about a km of walking through a *completely* desolate wasteland... you get annihilated by a wandering BoS patrol?
---
I’d be happy to sell you all the ones I pick up whenever I see you on. I’ll add you.
---
The atom prices themselves aren't for regular players, they're for whales. They already started lowered most  the atom shop prices. Think that's about as close to them reducing cost as we get for something that we can farm in-game
---
I am saying canning carrots, corn, mutfruit, and stuff like that. It would be non-perishable at that point. That is what I am saying. I want the ability to can my food so i don't food items anymore.
---
Sure! I'll be online today at 10PM UTC-3, if you want to trade.
---
Yes! Stuff like this is exactly what I'm talking about, so odd
---
Very helpful, thank you!!
---
Same, I now only buy stuff if it's temporary, leaving or on sale. If the price of atoms was cheap I would honestly buy everything in the store.
---
You should watch some of those "Many a True Nerd" playthroughs on youtube if you haven't already. He's very entertaining and he was running a pipe pistol build for a good long while (he may have switched primarily to shot guns though at some point). He often shows his perks, and he was heavily invested in those that help land repeated criticals. He was doing some really impressive damage with his revolver. Your Special points are somewhat similar to his although he had more in Luck (hence, the repeating criticals). But I agree with those who are suggesting that if you want a lot more damage, buy yourself a legendary weapon, and go bloodied if you're looking for crazy damage (not really my thing but I see the appeal).
---
Speed Demon. I dread the day I lose it when trying to get rid of rad poisoning.
---
where do you find the plan for the bunk bed?
---
Just picked one off a ghoul in the burrows, so they are dropping on enemies. Did you find one ..?
---
&gt;I have never made and never intend to make a dime playing Fallout 76. Doing so is against the ToS.
---
Sad that you'd even feel you had to include that disclaimer!
---
Got mine on a workbench at the top of the world.
---
Whales?
---
I've only seen one flatwoods monster in 140 levels so I haven't started this. Any good spots to find it?
---
Violating the ToS in and of itself isn't illegal but violating it in a manner that causes harm to the company financially, profits from their intellectual property rights, or does direct harm to their products is considered breach of contract and actionable in civil court in the US and Canada (and other courts in parts of the EU). So you're not criminally liable until the company takes legal action, then you can be charged.
---
Duping weapons and showing people how to is a violation of the ToS and in other games, I'm sure you've seen the articles, showing people how to exploit bugs is actionable.
---
Selling in-game products online is both harmful to potential profits (should Zenimax/Bethesda want to do it themselves) and infringement on their IP since you're making a profit on content/media that specifically belongs to them and is non-transferable.
---
tl;dr: Unless you're breaching data servers or using malicious code, no it's not a jailable offense but charges can be filed against you under breach of contract laws and IP laws for selling things that are not yours.
---
Try and go look at that stor that u need to finde to start the firs Sheepsquach quest in there there is an alien prop art try this it might work
---
 Twisted Muscles gives you +25% Melee damage and a Glowing Steak grants 10%. 
---
 So that's 35% you are missing. ;)
---
It's all PC gamers fault.
---
 Not really on slow weapons. The fast ones benefit mightily though.
---
much better with vats.
---
it's the main weakness of the mod imo. too VATS reliant.
---
otherwise, the auto is amazing because its damage penalty is smaller compared to other rifles' auto mods.
---
I would be buying much much more as well.  
---
There were a few limited time items I missed at the when the game first started that I wish I had picked up, but I didn't have enough atoms at the time. Oh well, maybe they will come back again someday.   
---
They need to have a sale one week of all limited time items come back.
---
Love the story and tactic, OP! Hahaha. Though he may have not been carrying any, I hope you took all his junk as well. I am on XB1 too and got griefed at a workshop in Adventure Mode. Wrote a thread all about why Workshops in AM should be extinct: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bf23bc/adventure\_mode\_workshop\_griefing\_is\_problem\_so/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bf23bc/adventure_mode_workshop_griefing_is_problem_so/)
---
Like the OP, I just want to quest and not mess with a-holes manipulating their character just to measure d\*ck sizes. I am hardcore PvP on other games, been playing at pro-level since 2013 &amp; ripping FPS since Doom, Marathon, Quake, Unreal and probably run a good majority of these dudes into the ground on a level playing field  (not while I am in AM making Corn Soup). F76 biggest appeal is questing in co-op. 
---
All aspects of PvP  should be appropriately segregated into Survival Mode. Thankfully, it looks like it's headed that way.
---
I could see the Inside the Vault right now, "Big changes coming to Workshops in Adventure Mode."
---
I believe it I have a habit of sticking guns into the body I'm searching then having to backtrack the last 20 kills to find my sniper rifle when I go to use it &gt;.&lt;   
---
It's only due to luck that when I first did it to anything important I looked over the container by accident and saw my a legendary bit of gear with the same stats as I had what a coincidence and why is it in a container I swear I searched already 0.o  then worked out that I must have put it there and from that I worked out that I tend to send items across while trying to short cut the exit screen from the full inventory it must pick up anything before the prompt is up as a "send that item across" command
---
40% attack speed effect?
---
Perfect. I will craft them tonight then. Maybe I'll scrap a few for some additional mods. I'll keep an eye out for you this weekend.
---
No. Wrong. Completely and utterly wrong. Y'all stay out of WesTek. Don't waste your time. Really.
---
I am usually there, you can ask me. I will tell you how much it sucks and that you should not come.
---
No, i just sent them a support ticket and I'll wait until they respond
---
Oh yeah. Use that for sure. With Tank Killer you get something like 75-80% armor penetration. 
---
Most wont be able to handle a sneak shit from that. 
---
As for Whitespring, you shouldn't ever get mobbed. What you do as a rifleman is run to the left of the building from the fast travel point and jump up on the flowerbed. Then you walk up to the back of the building and there will be a large broken window right by the kitchen. Just stand there and shoot. They won't be able to get you at all and all the sound will draw almost every one of them right to that spot. Like shooting fish in a barrel. Even better- switch to a long handle weapon like the pole hook or super sledge and you wont waste any ammo.
---
I have barely played F76 since the beta, and just started again, how did i get and keep mutations?
---
The enclave officer hat and uniform count
---
Jesus, vitriol much?  Yes they have a contingency plan for it.  Your question should be will it work?
---
Agree 200 dmg is good - you likely have the same problem I do - (with some melee weapons) - high damage but low speed often = dead player.
---
I am melee/sniper.  I've been in PA since L50 (b/c  I'm overencumbered)
---
I alternate between a (non-legendary) cultist dagger and blade of bastet as my goto melees.   Much lower damage than the supersledge, but speed perks + bloody mess make them much more efficient at taking out enemies, especially in a group.
---
Out of armor, I really like the death tambo and the deathclaw gauntlet.
---
have perks for 10% damage on both auto and bolt, ignore armor, and anti-tank
---
For sniping, a marksmans hardened sniper (308) 
---
For the SB and pretty much anything else - executioners combat rifle.
---
The buying isn't illegal (ToS violation yes). The selling is actionable in court since they're selling another companies IP without permission.
---
All's fair in love and AWOL.
---
Yup, had that happen last night. A wonderful eye-straining neon green and bright pink. I thought I went colour blind until the other textures and building finally loaded.
---
Rich kids/people that spend a lot of cash on microtransactions in video games. They are mostly good for the majority of the revenue made by selling microtransactions.
---
I haven't heard or read any updates to fix. I still can't complete the quest.
---
You can be murdered if you have a workshop taken from you so be sure to turn it off if claiming shops. I've forgot to a few times and wondered why I wasnt getting anywhere.
---
I am a dad and this is a perfectly acceptable joke
---
Wasteland justice as far as I'm concerned.
---
As an aside, the other day, I forgot to drop off my junk and died during the SBQ event.  Not sure off-hand what I lost (clearly I didn't think it was important), but when I respawned, I actually  witnessed another player take my bag.
---
It struck me as interesting that I really had no recourse for this without getting a bounty on my own head.
---
I server hopped at Firebase Hancock - run north till you’re level with Lost Home - that’s a spawn point, found him (and loads of others including the sheepie) there.
---
People who have large amounts of disposable income and try to have as many cosmetics as possible. They're called whales because they're rare but that's the kind of player cosmetic shops try to attract. So they're hunting whales
---
Ah.
---
Others have reported this doesn’t work but will go try it now..
---
Makes me want to start carrying around Salt to place in loot bags.
---
I mean, it would be nice
---
This isn't a challenge on ps4 either. Strange. So the op must be on pc.
---
Just have them fill out and ID-10:T form and it will all be fine.
---
Just buy repair kits.
---
OH WAIT THAT'S THE PROBLEM THEY SCREWED THE SYSTEM TO HELL AND THEN INSTEAD OF FIXING IT ARE TRYING TO SELL US A FIX FOR REAL MONEY ON A FUCKING DRIP-FEED.
---
You get one lease the 105mm. There isn’t any other steps after taking the 7 photos.
---
Lol you're my hero
---
Yeah for SBQ especially, I just turn from the boss and instantly shred anything I see. This is also to keep Adrenaline up, since it's a 60% dps boost and I'm often one of the only people doing meaningful damage. I see a big hulking thing in the distance, I turn towards it and it's turned to bloody chunks before I can say "oh that was a 3 star". Then it's back to the boss.
---

---
This is my rifle build, I’ve been very happy with it.  Was annihilating scorch beasts with an instigating dragon gun/furious lever until a game bug ate the dragon gun.
---
Starched genes are such a must Bc of mutations imho.  I’m not sure about the 3 perk cards for other luck items, still mulling it over as I try combos out, but I currently like what I posted Bc grim reaper sprint never seems to proc.
---
I see you are on PS4.  I believe I got a second instigating handmade last night if you’d like it.  Is your user name here same as ps4?  If so I’ll message you.  Real snipers scoff at pistols ;). This build also can roll over to automatic rifles, except I’m not made of lead and steel.
---
Okay, but wouldn't they make more money if everyone of their players would spend money rather than, probably, 5% of the player base.
---
Has anyone found a solution or read any acknowledgement regarding this? You'd think with a quest being so relatively new, that they'd prioritize it to be fixed.
---
It now weighs 100 lbs XD because eof dev room exploiters
---
The odd thing is if I go and pick up one of the junk items then everything will all drop to the ground at one time! It’s like the server realizes nothing is there holding it up as soon as you do it. It’s kind of funny but also very annoying.
---
Thanks for the advice and offer, I'm on PS4 so can't take you up on it, but I've had a similar offer from another player so I'm looking forward to giving the lever action a go to see how it fairs for me.
---
Yesterday was the first time I actually pressed the "purchase atoms" button, I really wanted a new floor to decorate my camp. The moment I saw the price I sticked with my shitty floor until I have the sufficient atoms from challenges...
---
What's a TSE?
---
Generally, I think the amount of Atoms you receive from a real money purchase should be about 50% more than what it presently is.
---
That's hilarious, I never tried to pick up the junk for fear it would crash my game!! Gonna try later now lol
---
How are you counting bobblehead and other items? 
---
Bolton Greens can spawn 5 bobbleheads?
---
 You get em' randomly from rads. You can buy serums from the Enclave, expensive, or even the recipes, very expensive. Players sell them all the time for quite reasonable amounts which is your best bet to get what you want. 
---
 You can equip 2 levels of Starched Genes which will prevent Radaway from flushing your Mutations.
---
 You can get 3 levels of Class Freak which removes the down side to your Mutation.
---
Most things are mostly 1*.
---
Thank you sir for correcting me, i'll go back to whitesprings the grass is greener over there anyway.
---
Everyone here has the attitude.
---
Could there be another tnt dome key secretly released in the game? If so it might be related some how
---
Yea try it! If you see it floating in the air then go pick one of them up. Everything will fall to the ground. You can still collect what falls to the ground also.
---
Well, with DR/ER being what it is, it's honestly hard to tell.  Easier to say what it isn't rather than exactly what it is, unless you can datamine it.
---
I've never heard the term bupkis before lol
---
Five death laws chasing you xD
---
I just hope the armour one makes my PA last longer than 0.5s against certain people in Survival LOL!
---
Damn okay cheers pal, that'll come in handy
---
I rembrr someone goo piled the SBQ and she ended up inside the fissure.
---
Ever seen digital lemmings?
---
Yeah just saw my 3rd just past kmax transmissions. They may be link to certain spawn areas like the witches outfit and vender bot
---
Yeah i agree. Just drop is shite. Even AOL have gurantee 3* legendary. Those have what, 15% to drop 3* item?  Which will have trash stats.
---
So yeah at release it would be good boss. Now it is just fun thing to do, but not worth.
---
ok that makes sense
---
Yeah I realized that this event cannot be done solo.
---
That's a brilliant solution for unreleased content.
---
Psychologists have been working on this since the early 2000's. Not saying you're wrong but I think they would have already altered the formula. The biggest piece of the playerbase won't spend anything at all no matter what so they want to stab those whales. The whales spend that kinda money to show off and support their favorite game, they'll buy at almost any amount
---
welp i guess no one gives a shit about the game ... and that people are abusing hacks ..
---
Which would result in civil penalties, not criminal. I wonder how widespread it would need to be, for Bethesda to pursue lawsuits to stop it?
---
Last I heard, the world-wide canvas shortage was still ravaging the world.  Canvas is scare and frequently fought over, trading for high amounts of adhesive and screws.
---
No mate, you’re the one with the attitude. Look at your OP and tell me why anyone should want to help you..
---
 Is nice but changes nothing. A Medium Speed weapon gets just a few points. Fast weapons do much better and Very Fast weapons benefit a lot.
---
Nope. Have had that with empty camps because I had placed them to far from resources for instance.
---
It'll probably just grant you an extra 50 DR/ER so you'll have a few extra ms to watch the parts fly off.
---
Maybe..
---
Just go get mutated in the wavy Willard toxic water
---
I got electrically charged and chameleon just server hopping three times
---
People need to realize that the vast majority of legendary enemies in this game aren't 3\*. Expecting one you see by itself as a super rare encounter to be anything but 1\* most of the time is kinda strange.   
---
"I've killed five super mutants and they've all been 1\*. WTF" would sound crazy, right? same logic.
---
Had the same things happen, one in the shops yesterday and another at the train station the day before.  The guy at the Train station I went on mic and called him a jackass and told him to quit sucking at life so hard and he stopped shooting me.  The guy in the shops kept hitting me with a shovel over and over and when I pulled out my gun he switched to a dragon.   Knowing the reload speed, and that I dropped all my junk already, I took my chances.  I waited till he took a shot, I returned fire a couple shots, and then I led him on a goose chase around Whitesprings.  When I heard it go off I'd spin around and take a couple shots then start running again.  I was under weight + speed demon + sprinting.  He followed for a while but never got a shot in on me.  Eventually I logged.
---
I haven't seen them but am always looking for good youtube content and more things fallout are always welcome. I think it's time to start saving those caps for a legendary and retiring the faithful ol' pipe revolver.
---
Radars like that are pretty common in mmorpgs, and it's here to stay. 
---
On the bright side suck hacks are usually behind some kind of paywall so not everyone is going to be willing to 1. pay for the game, 2. pay for some silly hack.
---
Yeah they can provide some extra oomph but it won't be such a major advantage. More often than not cheaters are just players that are too bad at the game to play fairy and even with radar hacks they'll still suck at this game.
---
What platform are you on?
---
What’s toe GT? We should play!
---
&gt;most of us long time Fallout players, are used to playing 400+ hours solo 
---
Exactly this. I'm at roughly 700 hours, (correct, I have no life), 90% of that has been solo. If I'm at an event I try to be as generous as possible, I'll even dump most 1* &amp;2* legendaries for the other folks to grab, but I don't want to be the sole person in harms way either. I very rarely even do mobs at WS anymore, I stick with the higher level events that'll generally have more folks able to harm the boss besides me...
---
you see someone hitting high base numbers like that they are more often than not running a type of bloodied build..  
---
unyeilding armor (stats up to +3 the lower your health)  
---
nerd rage/radicool/dodgy/serendipty are most used cards.
---
bloodied weapon (but any weapon will get boosted, just bloodied prefix gets insane)  
---
adrenal reaction/twisted muscles  
---
then get health to 20% usually by irradiating yourself to that point, dmg goes up near 1000 base, then if also using a sneak build as well getting 2.5 to 3.5 x damage to sneak attacks you start pushing 3-4k damage a hit.
---
Not necessary at all, I've been playing solo since I bought it. But if any of my friends had bought the game I'd surely play with'em
---
AimJunkies thanks you for your commercial.
---
PC
---
I just disconnected from a server before loading in lol. I'm on xbox btw.
---
Ah, it's a shame it's like that :/
---
&gt; some guy with a one hit melee build just robbed me of some 3* loot 
---
I'm seriously curious,  how did you get robbed of it? What type of event and what was the situation?
---
&gt; “How to form your own opinion” 
---
Not sure that's legal, pal.
---
Yup. So far I haven’t lost anything I noticed/care about that way, although I’m *pretty* sure I lost a Blade of Bastet that way. It just turned up missing one day, but it wasn’t something I used much so I’m not sure when it vanished. No big loss, I’ve got 3 characters now, but I’m pretty conscientious, I can’t think of another way it could have vanished.
---
Heh.
---
I don't think it would be retrievable.  Even if you could loot it in the split second before you die, you're still at the mercy of the loot window load time cooperating.
---
Maybe its because everyone is playing right now?
---
NICE!! Thank you for the time and effort!
---
If the sites are located in countries the can take action, Zenimax would probably take action right away. Those sites don't usually exist because Blizzard has been taking them down for over a decade.
---
There was an actual memo sent out waaaaay back (Like Lich King iirc) in the day to even the beta testers to report all sites selling gold and items directly to the legal team's email. It came shortly after Blizzard and Sony (on behalf of Everquest) took down one of the larger sites based in the US.
---
-Instigating 10Mm sub with explosive damage and reduced weight so it weighs so little
---
-also back in December my melee friend gave me his mutants explosive Gatling plasma with reload speed
---
-my other melee friend gave me his troubleshooters 50 cal with explosives damage and I think damage resist while reloading
---
It's not so bad, they let you earn them in game at a pretty decent rate. Personally I don't buy atoms. Maybe when the road map is finished. I've gotten over something like 8k atoms doing dailies since release
---
2 queens must have been very cool to see
---
Someone else might have been there already?
---
How about Fat Man turrets?
---
That's my thought, just wondering if anyone else is having trouble.
---
I know the feeling of wanting to move your base but loving it too much to do so. I am so torn about my camp. I built it at a lower level, so my budget has grown but I can't place anything else yet. I need water for alcohol and the pump sucks. I love the look and location of my camp and am having a hard time finding another spot I like just as much as this one. Oh and is it a nukashine spawn spot, so I get visitors now and then.
---
Yeah maybe so.  I server hop a few times on the off-chance I'll get lucky with another BOS mod.  But just not seeing anything over last few days.
---
True, I'm one of those people who wants everything and I just can't afford it.
---
It started with just one bag.  Juuuust out of reach from the edge.
---
By the time I left, lootless.  There were just so, SO many floating paper bags.
---
Yes i understand you point.
---
But if they imply the decorating to camps we should able to. Not trading or dropping would still technically in the stash. 
---
With the decorations, would wepons and armor take up build space or stash space?
---
I am on PS4 yes, my PSN is the same as here, if you have a spare instigating handmade that would be amazing, I do have various legendaries in my stash in exchange, but none are suitied to a rifle build (as far as I'm aware, but could be sold on for caps). You're free to have a look and take one in exchange. I'm not on tonight, but should be on tomorrow. If you send me a message I'll be sure to add you.
---
Im not really getting how you can find yourself living with that amount of health? Im using perk cards that inject me with a stim when i reach 40% health and ive been under the impression that that card is one of my strongest
---
Doooood.
---
Ok
---
several disconnects. yesterday too. it's definitely more unstable right now.
---
Ooooh steal, robbing peoples placed junk in their camps?
---
I am.  I am taking a break from so much disconnect actually.
---
Sounds good to me. My gamertag is sleepy4792. I have stabilized flux is that the correct stuff?
---
Bummer
---
No, I got the Fusion Generator there, as I said in my original comment.
---
Sweet rig!  How many MBs is your internal memory?
---
my dude this shit has an aimbot that can hit you with 100% and has more range than vats .. this can hit you at 200 range witch is over the rendering distance of the game.
---
Long shot, but Anyone tried the mounted alien head at that place we did the sheepsquatch quest line? Or the one someone found in a dumpster?
---
Cant speak for anyone else but I'm still waiting...email I got for confirmation said 6-8 months
---
Likely the same people who were complaining about "trade stealing" exploits. 
---
To be fair, 76's UI isn't great, so it's not entirely their fault.
---
So when are you gonna make that thread to tell everyone how to respawn the golf club?
---
&gt;Some yahoo in PA always has to be between the mob and everyone else
---
That is, by definition,  a melee build. They have to go in close. 
---
Myself, I prefer a shotgunner build with a side of melee and a rifle garnish. I too generally get up close, but with the changes to adventure mode I don't really worry who is in my LOF. Sure, it breaks immersion a bit but given the way events are, there seems to be little choice. I'm not going to hurt them regardless.  I've never really had anyone upset by me hitting them as they dont even get slap damage anymore.
---
Just tried the mounted head, didn’t work
---
Wasteland Karma. It can be a bitch.
---
Yeah, I've caught myself almost selling items to Vendors or transferring to containers a number of times before.  The system isn't losing the items, people are screwing up.
---
What time EST?
---
Two Shot Explosive
---
Instigating, faster wing speed 90% reduced weight Rolling pin!
---
That is a known bug. It can't be picked up, and it randomly appears beneath your feet when you spawn.
---
GAAAVVIIIIN? HAVE YOU SEEN MY FRIEND GAVIN?
---
Dang rolling pins
---
Same here, frustrating as a VATS stealth sniper.
---
How long could it possibly take to make some damn bags?!
---
&gt;If a dude in power armor is in front of you blocking your shots so you can't tag,
---
Or just lob a molotov cocktail or other low end AOE item.
---
A level 20 explosive pipe pistol with one other negligible effect.  I got it on my melee/heavy guns character.  That, and an explosive quick firing dragon (also on my melee character) are the only two explosive weapons I've ever gotten.
---
I like doing most events with other people, but I only do a quick run through WS if no one else is there. I don't even bother if there are already people camped at the golf club.
---
I take off all my armor and run around them screaming into my mic as annoyingly as I can. Then I follow them around them map doing it until they block me or log off.
---
dodgy and serendipty trigger under 40% health so mobs miss alot.. but in a sense if you have ever been a gamer and heard the term "Glass Cannon" that/this is the fallout version of a glass cannon.. you can 1 shot pretty much any mob on the map, and take good chunks off the big mobs. but something actually looks at you and connects.. your dead..
---
I’ve actually done the Forest version solo a few times. Never managed to keep more than two Brahmin alive, but it’s doable.
---
I'd love for them to also make it stop auto-using the stims of you're radiated enough that your hp is low enough for it to trigger even if you haven't actually been damaged
---
that's funny.. I just ran into a level 50 legendary one myself when I logged in at Lucky Hole Mine..he was kicking my butt til I dropped down at the base of a cliff and he didn't seem to know where to go..then I just pecked away at him from a distance. Not very honorable I guess but I took it.
---
..got a nice recon Gauss rifle for my trouble
---
There was a post yesterday from a user who got an email from Bethesda that seemed to allude to final address confirmation.  It may be happening soon.
---
Explain what these methods are
---
I would like a FP Fallout game... map the size of the original 2 Fallout games, and locations as far apart as they are in that game, too.
---
I stopped joining the event because I used all my stimpacks on failed attempts. It's too damn hard. I've done SBQ twice, and killed her twice, and barely had to use any stims. I've done Encryptid like 4 or 5 times, only got the kill once, and used about 100 stimpacks in the process.
---
True enough.. I have to farm for molotovs tho (damn you beer bottles!), but I have like 20K fusion cells.
---
Lol ait cool. If you've got the time, what specialstats are necessary for this build?
---
I'm not sure if it's the case here but when I've forgotten about the stupid camera emote glitch and teleport from it I usually have to reload the game. Eventually it will become unplayable, with interior structures completely lacking walls or floors.
---
I was level 92 when I found it, took me about 2 weeks of server hopping but I finally got it like two days ago. And yeah for sure, it’ll turn up
---
You also have a high chance to crash your game too lol.
---
How is that the worst drop you got?
---
Whole argument was about Beth stating its high end dungeon with at least 2 peoples participating to manage it through. Obviously that was players expectation. When everyone manage to finish it in few minutes run You can imagine the dissapointment.
---
As a stand alone extra bit of a map its perfectly fine and very well designed. Love the atmosphere there.
---
There's 360° of room for a melee player to interact with a mob. They just choose to put their ginormous, PA hit-box buttocks in the 5° I need.
---
I only take pictures of bugged content or funny examples of ragdoll physics - posing next to frozen enemies, flying Yao Guai, and Scorchbeasts laying on their back spread eagle
---
probably using duped weapons.
---
I expected much more enemies than what was given. The 2nd day when I went down there alone there seemed to be a ton of enemies, but days after there's only small pockets of about 5 ghouls in every other room I go through. Curious to know if the spawn rates were nerfed after people started nuking it.
---
The area itself looks great and I'm sure there's more they could do with it, like events and what not. But a dungeon it sure isn't.
---
missed the power armor at site X9
---
Rad-x/Radaway into diluted with Chemist and Super Duper is half of my daily selling.
---
Can I ask what your character's luck SPECIAL is? I have a theory that the Luck Stat affects the RNG for determining both spawning of legendary critters and their accompanying drops... (trying to confirm, if anyone has datamining type info on this, I'm super curious to see the results).
---
Same issue, I think it's just server lag/desync since I actually hear the sound of the hit connecting as opposed to just swinging at the air.
---
16 MothBois, plan on upgrading it soon, though.
---
Not on until later tonight..I’ll let you know.
---
I restarted my xbox and reconnected to my wifi, it's working much better now.

---
You have my upvote. I sincerely hope this post gets enough upvotes and comments to get the attention of someone who can make this happen
---
Lolol yep that's me
---
This angle seems to work.  A few "poor boys didn't get enough hugs from their mamas today" seems to annoy the younger players enough to make it worth it.
---
Sorry. I'm on now. Invite me to a group.
---
Got my confirmation email early Jan, said 4 - 6 months for delivery. So in theory, May's when I start expecting to receive a follow up email telling me there's been a delay, or issues sending it overseas, and if I could move to one of 3 particular US states to personally sign for it's delivery then I can expect it before 2025.
---
Ok, that was a (small) joke.
---
But, hopefully it'll be some point in the next couple of months. Maybe there will be a bonus, exclusive cosmetic, or even physical gift (hey I'd like a funko pop scorchbeast) included, and we'll have something in our grubby little mitts.
---
That's the one I used, from the spawn/fast travel point you can scope the steps to see if it's there.
---
(May have to wait for the addon content to spawn in)
---
People were expecting vault raid material from an underground “dungeon” story

That's hilarious.  Go forth and salt their graves!

One of the people u/recession in this post responded to one of my  comments today and said the data miners determined that the Zetans were going to be added with one of the upcoming DLC's
---
Ok thanks. So I got only crap servers on ps4 😂
---
I teleported to a workshop via event in adventure mode just recently and spawned next to the owner who for some reason could kill me immediately. I never initiated PvP or even moved yet after spawning in. I did have a workshop I owned attacked by someone else like 30-60mins earlier who eventually left and PvP event ended. No one was contesting my workshop at the time so I dunno. ;o If they were grouped then it permaflagged me against someone else I never met across the map outside of my workshop.
---
TBH this only happens at WS and I'm basically like get the f*** away from me ur like that annoying kid from the block no one wants to play with..im only level 70 and I keep hearing from my friends that once I hit level 100 I will be a target..I'm like I don't care I will not engage in pvp nor let anyone bother me
---
I’m fairly comfortable describing this game as single-player with optional multiplayer components.
---
&gt; They just choose to put their ginormous, PA hit-box buttocks in the 5° I need.
---
Lamo. I have that exact picture in mind now. Yeas, for WS clubhouse, I get why that'd be an issue that's partly why I dont even bother with WS anymore or if I do I take the road circuit of the bungalows.  
---
I used to just cut the legs out from under the ghouls and let everyone clean up but it always seems there'll be THAT guy who starts lobbing plasma grenades or mini-nukes, so it just isn't worth the hassle
---
Farming the asylum for straight jackets/chems/legendaries nets the daily vendor cap in 1 run if you're lucky. Straight jackets sells for 48 caps with 4 charisma/3* hard bargain/sweet roll.
---
&gt;unyeilding armor (stats up to +3 the lower your health)  
---
&gt;nerd rage/radicool/dodgy/serendipty are most used cards.  
---
&gt;bloodied weapon (but any weapon will get boosted, just bloodied prefix gets insane)adrenal reaction/twisted muscles  
---
&gt;then get health to 20% usually by irradiating yourself to that point, dmg goes up near 1000 base, then if also using a sneak build as well getting 2.5 to 3.5 x damage to sneak attacks you start pushing 3-4k damage a hit.
---
this is pretty much all of it.. you pick your weapon/style get unyeilding gear (more stars the better/ +stat needed for weapon).. bloodied or instigating version of the weapon.
---
I remember the first time I found out legendary robots explode.  It's a lesson everyone has to learn the hard way.
---
Strange I did this recently on my second character  it feels like such an accomplishment when you scan it at the mining place and complete that quest.
---
Ok so a few things greivers will do.
---
1. They will constantly follow you around shooting and hitting you to try to get you to shoot or hit back.
---
2. They will have a low level character try to team with you so they can know the location of your base, then they communicate with their greiver friends and they will raid your base ( destroy it) and try to get you to attack them to get even.
---
3. They will camp on or by workshops and as soon as someone takes it over they will kill you.
---
4. Some greivers will scout the map for potential mule transfers, ( a high level character with a low level) and try to steal a loot drop, ie brown bag, and goad you into attacking them.
---
Thanks, will try!
---
The Wanted Electrically Charged exploit certainly needs to go. I do not know any others aside from that.
---
I don't suspect anything will be done about contesting a workshop and fast traveling to the owner. It is likely too complicated to fix. I see suggestions about making it so you cannot be harmed unless inside the workshop boundaries, but I can see all sorts of problems arising from that. Step in, shoot, run out, be invincible.
---
There is also the ability to destroy someone's CAMP without a penalty while engaged in combat with them. There will be abuse of mechanics no matter what you do. If CAMPS were invincible, you'd just have people building turret bases outside of their favorite workshops for added defenses. I think the main issue is that camps and workshops are programmed exactly the same.
---
Thanks, will try my luck 👍🏻
---
I miss picking up dismembered heads and shooting hoops with them.
---
Well, since your post was removed, I'd like to know how you think they can remove PvP from workshops in adventure mode. Please enlighten me, because as i see it now, there's no plausible way to, and frankly I hope they don't. (Even though I also hate pvp and griefing)
---
Upon seeing this place I was like:
---
* Two enterances with a linear path for a while.
---
* Nukable, and loot pool is better when nuked. No rads inside when nuked, so the first powerfarming location where you are not forced into PA or hazmat.
---
* Refreshes when players enter a location
---
* Because of two entrances, easily defensible
---
* On survival, you get good loot
---
* On survival, you get yourself wanted and lure people inside, killing them upon entrance, but still having them refresh your mobs
---
* Full of containers that give additional stuff when searched, all related perks should be shared within team for maximum farm, canned coffee here I fucking come
---
* Possible to have two teams, one guarding entrance, one running through and luring mobs to entrances, so that defenders can also get their chance at RNG
---
* The best possible spot for mixed PvP + PvE experience
---
* The best location in game
---
People seem to lack imagination, IMO. This place is great, but you need to start paying attention to appreciate it.
---
# 2 has happened to me countless times.
---
Having an apology gift for the wait would be nice but Bethesda definitely isn’t going to go out of their way to do that
---
Drop power patcher, PA already lasts forever. Just swap it on for repairs.
---
Portable power isn't useful unless you like hauling around several power armor frames at once. A frame weighs only 10lbs regardless of what the individual PA pieces weigh.
---
Heavy weapon damage perks do not affect it, but stabilized DOES work for accuracy and +45% armor penetration.
---
I personally would drop or only use 1* power user. Fusion cores are easy to come by and you could put 2 more points into STR for 2 1* shotgun damage cards. Grenadier is fantastic for the AGL and M79; low level trash mobs disappear very quickly with the bigger radius.
---
Here is my personal build, certainly nothing meta, but does very well for me using an AGL, instigating M79, a TS 50 cal, and an AA 50 cal: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f374e3a&amp;d=sq2s32sr2s01e52ep1c71cr0ip2ic4a72lu2l71id0pq1pa0s21sw1e40e10ib4ls2lt1&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=2389cef
---
While never breaking eye contact either
---
Good to know. I have a bloodied stashed away. Time to dust it off.
---
Thx bruh..ppl love trying to get me to engage pvp and I laugh at them..with my build they will get one shot..I simply ignore them all the time
---
Tse level one pipe revolver
---
&gt;maybe a first timer that expected mecha-squatch levels of health and difficulty?
---
I know I stumbled into the event yesterday while hunting for a mega sloth and I expected the real squatch to be tougher than the imposter,  but it's not, by a long shot!
---
Fuckin WHAT‽ why was this not put in a god damned loading screen‽
---
Yeah me too, even after talking to them via game chat
---
I literally didn't say anything that would warrant the rude reaction I'm getting. God forbid I want to try playing again.
---
PS4 name same as above?
---
They're not implicitly labeled as such and I only see them referenced in a debug terminal but there very well could be things not referenced that I haven't seen. Would be nice to see them if that's the case though.
---
Yes the last 2 patches made this. There are spots where the terrain goes up in the air like a mountain. And with the latest patch you have a radius around you in which everything is loaded,otherwise you se the bare land with bright colors.
---
The atom shop versions are clean, whereas the ingame versions are dirty.

👏 Well bully for you old (crotchety) man.  That’s a little hard to do when you scroll through your feed and people are throwing things out there left and right, or as this gentleman stated, he walked into an area and heard people talking through his mic. We didn’t say, “Everyone stop doing it,” we made a comment between two players.  People like you are a joke. Bye Bye now 👋
---
So basically everyone else is wrong and you’re right?
---
Ive learned the hard way, but now i chose not to team, especially when trading, because at that point they know you have caps.

The nice thing about the code is that if you plan on launching more than one nuke over the course of the week, you’ll never have to type in the code again if you return to the same silo. 
---
I always launch from Charlie. Fast travel cost to Fissure Site Prime, Whitesprings, and the Burrows are all generally cheapest from Charlie.
---
I actually found an instigating pump action with 50% crit damage, as a shotgun/crit build the gun as absolutely perfect for oneshotting without sending the body flying. What the need to do is make event rules the same as team rules so that tapping isn't necessary to get loot if everyone is in the same event. XP should work the same too. As things progress we'll actually start needing support roles that rarely need to do damage, and XP should be given for being a part of the engagement regardless. This tapping thing is crazy.
---
So much this. I’ve made some decent looking counter top area with some table placement, but would love that little bit more for detailing.
---
Furious BO rifle with 25% faster fire rate

Woooooooooah!
---
I'm not sure you're following. This has nothing to do with the scenarios you're imagining in the first paragraph.
---
If I have auto-stim armor on, and I somehow get pegged down (Encryptid is a great place). I'll be kneeling ... and my autostim will fire ... my health will go to 100 ... but you can't get back up. The timer still counts down and you still die ... with 100% health. Sure someone ELSE can stim me and that's great - but I'm already at 100% health - just can't act.

Like the other guy said, 105mm dude

Scammed?
---
Exactly what happened and how did it happen?
---
In the storyline you’ll encounter a group focused solely on fighting the main enemy and it’s plague in the game, and learn a few tactics on how to fight the plague-carriers, or Scorchbeasts. Those tactics at a low level have saved my character more times than I can count (somehow I ran into them a lot). I’d recommend doing the same until you have a lot of decent gear to take them head on.
---
However it hasn’t saved me from an encounter running away from both Super Mutants and Scorchbeasts. Those tactics never really taught you how to deal with a Super Mutant who chases you throughout the conflict and ends up brutally smashing you to death with a sledgehammer like it’s a Rainbow Six Siege casual match.
---
My very first TSE drop was a level 15 sub machine gun.
---
Kinda does, depends on how you pronounce Brahmin.  Still gets a thumbs up for the attempt.
---
Okay
---
If you're on PC I can gift one max lvl 1star bloodied laser pistol.
---
Tell your friend to trade with reputable people.
---
I never accept the team invite from the low level player, but I am usually standing in my camp when they try. Then in comes 3 lvl 200+ players in full PA.  I immediately log off now at any chance of someone coming to my camp -- which is sad. I was so much more welcoming and friendly before all the camp attacks.  Now I'm paranoid.
---
I'm reminded the hard way waaay too many times lol
---
Have you tried buying anything? Might fix it, might not. There's a really cheap 20 atom player icon on sale in the store right now. Perfect for testing that.
---
Thank you for the tips. I will look these over. Stabilized for sure, that will be very helpful.
---
Well, its all the people who cant hack it in survival that are the problem
---
Pc ?
---
Hahaha very true
---
And lots of super mutants looking for a human treat.
---
OP has never implied TSE are the best legendaries. The TSE reference is not about DMG, but about the fact that the explosions send the body flying. So not only does the person kill everyone else's chance at a legendary drop, but then they cant loot the body either so it also hurt them.
---
no it was a bloodied 250 dmg res 15% faster firerate for a vangarud sent piece
---
It may have better range or accuracy than vats but:
---
1. It's still affected by obstacles, so unless both you and your target are in the open that 200 range isn't that useful. Your bullets will still hit obstacles.
---
2. Usually aim bots have a pre-set target, such as the middle of the head hitbox. If for example you can only see 1/3 of the head that aimbot is useless since it can't see that pre-set point and it will think that the target is fully under cover. 
---
3. You don't get to take advantage of vats perks/vats crits
---
4. Aim bots are usually one of the easiest features to detect and ban. Bethesda simply needs a script to keep track of accuracy, if you have 100% accuracy with your last 10000 shots = you're most likely a fishy person. People can also record such events. 
---
The radar will stay, aimbots not so much.
---
That is awesome!
---
It’s from the “Domestic Tables” plan, not sure where that’s sold

Aw darn. Got my hopes up.

Unfortunately, there is nothing you can do. I know a guy that is a walking GOD because he scammed a lot of people and he gave nothing back. He built the best sets and weapons out of nothing but naive traders.
---
I haven't gotten that info added for all locations, but the possible spawn counts is a mix of data mining and the Prima guide.
---
Apparently bloodied. Although I wouldn't really feel safe running a bloodied build, I just suck way too much to pull that off.
---
That’s what I wish this was, but heavy doubt.
---
Heil to Maxson. Ad Victorium!
---
It's time to do some science then
---
It's the "greaser" version, the ones you get in-game are just "greasy".
---
&gt; What the heck did people expect? 
---
"\[...\] [a challenge for 2+ level 50+ Vault Dwellers, but truly brave (and well geared) souls may be able to tackle it alone](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1QMBfEfLfsdy3ho9eYMoQ0/inside-the-vault-the-burrows-and-camera-preview). "
---
We expected what was advertised. I guess by the most generous reading we could say they didn't specify *which* two or more *specific* level 50+ Vault Dwellers would be challenged by it, but I wasn't one of them, nor was I brave or well geared.
---
&gt;t's still affected by obstacles, so unless both you and your target are in the open that 200 range isn't that useful. Your bullets will still hit obstacles.
---
its not shots go trough walls.

&gt;Usually aim bots have a pre-set target, such as the middle of the head hitbox. If for example you can only see 1/3 of the head that aimbot is useless since it can't see that pre-set point and it will think that the target is fully under cover.

you can use stacking damage and boost your damage to 300000000 it oneshots you 
---
&gt;Aim bots are usually one of the easiest features to detect and ban. Bethesda simply needs a script to keep track of accuracy, if you have 100% accuracy with your last 10000 shots = you're most likely a fishy person. People can also record such events.
---
they are not bethesdas anti cheat system dosent detect it..
---
btw i can set to imortal and i dont die.
---
They are all 15+ except endurance, which is at 5 in my build.
---
Still have a bunch of those to add. Was important for me early in, but now that I have full max level sets (other than Raider) haven't been as motivated to do the rest
---
Despite it being a group event, unless you’re ACTUALLY grouped up, you’re just playing solo with other solo players. As such, if one of them kills it and you don’t get a tag, you have no loot. If you do tag it and don’t do enough damage, you have no loot. If you miss your shot (literally) and the next guy kills it, you have no loot.
---
The only way to guarantee that you get loot from that mob is to hit it and hit it hard. And if you do so and the next guy didn’t get his tag, at least you still got your loot. Better safe than sorry =\
---
How about “nuke turrets that do the same amount of damage as a nuke in game”
---
Can I ask why I got downvoted here? Did I do something wrong? Does it negatively impact the other players if I'm there at lvl 31? I'm just genuinely curious :)
---
they lost there items because most of the player base are  casua and they droped the items. this games player base is to dumb.
---
I have a two shot +10% while aiming +15% reload speed grenade launcher that i was excited to use. Until i realized how fast it breaks.
---
I can't use the gunsmith perk with demolition on at the same time(not enough points) so even with 200% durability it breaks after about 30 shots i think.
---
I always find them at top of the world. Shoot down all the vertibots, and the cargobot will circle you. 
---
Won't be on for a while, or I'd help.
---
was playing w/something for abit, but something I can look into again
---
he has the info not me but from what i know he was trading on market for a vansent chest piece through i assume pms he was trading he gave the laser then the other guy diped off the game
---
My issue is I don’t seem to have a weapon strong enough to down the damn thing.
---
christ
---
Those sound like a great start! Ill have to check my cap situation.... unless you want and explosive railway rifle haha
---
I may have some bloodied knuckles I could give you. I dont really remember if I dropped them or not, but I'll be home in about an hour if you want them.
---
That's why you use a middleman.
---
Haha. I meant Predator, I only just noticed I put "Terminator" in the title 😋
---
Okay. Ready to go. Sorry for previous.... I farm acid all day at work so I'm not responsive during those times.
---
 Go fuck yourself puppy! I'm a happy old man with so many pitiful children to pick on. ;)
---
I found lots of stuff w screws in the penitentiary
---
It got nerfed to be +25% dmg, not double. Bloodied, Furious, and AA are all better.
---
https://m.imgur.com/a/3ZhkLJl
---
I thought it just was me!
---
Anything below 75% HP Bloodied is better than TS.
---
This is pretty common. For whatever reason if I'm zipping through junk to scrap (doing each piece by piece since "scrap all" is a bad idea when holding bulked stuff) the bottom item on my Apparel list will pop into focus. No thanks, I'd rather not scrap my shielded vault suit or that straightjacket, TYVM.
---
They frequent Watoga also, that's where I got mine. Aim for the rotors.
---
Sheepsquatch: *Hey man I know you’ve been looking for me but I wanna join the mothman cult*
---
 BoS Heavy Combat. ;)
---
Pip boy is not scrappable now.
---
I fully support this. Its a real idea that can actually improve your experience, without changing game play
---
Here's what I would do:
---
 [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f842bb5&amp;d=s22l71s72a04eu0pq1eh2ib4sw2lt2pe2sd2so2sp2pc2as2cu0cr0ip2ir2&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=cfb28e3](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f842bb5&amp;d=s22l71s72a04eu0pq1eh2ib4sw2lt2pe2sd2so2sp2pc2as2cu0cr0ip2ir2&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=cfb28e3) 
---
Note that this assumes a bloodied auto grenade launcher and bloodied combat shotgun. If not going that route you could drop nerd rage.
---
nty its not that i am asking for items its more of a what to do type of thing i deffintly apprecate ( im bad at spelling lmao) the thought though
---
To be fair though - the worst thing a Bloodied build can face is a Mr. Gutsy.  I will admit that when I do AWOL Armaments, I don't try to be democratic with the mob because I'm going to die if I don't kill them quickly.  There are usually plenty to go around anyway. 
---
But when it comes to the Legendary, you share it.
---
Having played this game both with and without the Perk Loadout Manager mod on PC; the QOL change is absolutely just go to the perk sheet and press a button to switch between my crafting perks and my combat perks.
---
Sugar Grove has tons of clipboards, fans, and hot plates.
---
Yea tracking it isn’t the issue as they give you a marker for them.  What’s the best way to hit the rotors?
---
I really like BOS w deep pockets. :)
---
true
---
I've actually had a dude rage out on me for contesting a workshop, and killing him. Like barged in out open party, cursing a bluestreak. Yeah we all laughed at jim, but damn 
---
Pacifist or no, you open yourself to pvp when you claim a workshop.
---
Same with bounties. Don't rage out on other players because you opened the door to pvp
---
It's not just "action"... on Adventure mode, they still get/take the full CAPS value when they kill you. I lost almost 2000 caps getting gang-pwned by a team of 3 or 4 guys at Thunder Mountain. Couldn't respawn elsewhere, couldn't ignore, die, respawn in WS area, die, rinse repeat. I actually saw a post where some "RP Raider" was advocating this as "the best way to make caps in the game". sigh. They never even took the workshop. (the upside is, despite losing the caps and some stabilized flux, I was still able to farm my 10 fusion cores for the night)
---
Pipe guns are usually priced pretty decently.  Good luck!
---
Um i think in that position they went out with a bang
---
Did you already have a camera?
---
I found the same guy but on top of the roof over the gas pumps. Already have the camera, so just assumed it only appears once.
---
Scoped aiming or concentrated fire perk.
---
I’d give up a bit of graphics for something like that on a solid engine.
---
That site is accurate to game data. I'm surprised the Sub hasn't blown up over all the Atomic Shop stuff that works since that's a P2W tactic when using some of the over reaching definitions people have used here.
---
Heavy Combat Armor with the BoS modification.  And Dense on the torso (good luck finding that).
---
You cant do much other than report them if they traded on the market subreddit.
---
TSE is more fun than Bloodied.  You don't have to worry about a Rad Rat killing you and having to race back to pick up your junk.
---
I'll give that a try and keep you up-to-date. Thank you
---
That's why I always press "take all" and toss what I don't need afterwards.
---
Heavy combat armor modded with "Brotherhood of Steel" material offers the highest resistances.
---
Only if you're a wizard
---
alright thanks man
---
Good job! It's very satisfying, and so helpful for travelling around when you get encumbered. All those screws and black titanium was worth it.
---
Or just tag it and wait for the Watoga Bot Posse to finishit off. All you have to do then is find the thing when it crashes.
---
Well, he also said TS, so he meant a weapon that's really good. Even if what you said were true, *any* Explosive legendary will do that, so his specification of TS would be redundant.
---
Yes it does
---
It's always been happening, but I feel like it's been worse lately. I used to go through ~30 enemies and have the bug happen once.
---
Last night, while defending my baby Brahmin, I went through one squad of Super Mutants and one squad of wolves. A third of them didn't respond to my first hit. Really annoying when the event basically centers around killing everything as fast as possible.
---
Prickett's Fort on the desk of the entrance buiding. You can also loot it from ghouls, maybe other enemies too
---
How do I get it then?
---
u got the wrong TSEs lol
---
Harry naturally increases in weight as he gets older. Hope this helps
---
Yup. Got a 3* rolling pin as well. Can't remember the stats offhand,  I  think it was Berserkers though, I'd have to log in to check.  I have been saving it for the Legendary Vendor for a reroll chance.
---
The offer for the free bloodied knuckles is still up if you or your friend wants em. I've got no use for it, being a two handed build.
---
I have to adnit, I was surprised that the previous post was deleted.  I didn't see anything questionable about it, and if the mods can't take a little constructive criticism, they should be mods.
---
I'm not sure what the motivation is behind posting this
---
That’s not enough!
---
Leather versions can be easily deep pocketed for more carry weight
---
You automatically win.
---
This would make such a huge difference without changing anything about the gameplay
---
That is so messed up....idk how u could even prevent it though
---
he said no thanks again though
---
Brilliant job well done
---
Thank you for clarification i was worried he didnt
---
The one you couldn't use at all before by the giant tree in the mire? Can't recall offhand but I just did it in one of my last YT videos looking for the nuka Quantum armor plan. Not much in there anyway though except for some Bos underarmor plan or something.
---
Carebears, this is the apocalypse I’m not here to help you survive
---
Oh Nice thanks
---
Try  748250.
---
Yeah, I don't watch a ton of that kind of stuff but he's good. Only problem is his consecutive play session are simply numbered 1-whatever, and the title doesn't always reveal what he's going to get up to. Anyways, he kept trying to find a better pistol than his pipe one, and never did.
---
Bloodied? with auto, all the right perks and low life w/adrenaline, it could do almost 500 DMG per shot at 75 fire rate. its a beast. I dont think there is a gun with more DPS in the game. maybe gauss debatable.
---
no, buying a non-duplicated item is earning it
---
Good to know that we really don't know.  I guess.
---
yea I purposely use weaker guns with other players. I watched a guy clear out the entire burrows just walking ahead and one shotting everything. Oh and mfs need to stop jumping in at whitesprings, people keep jumping in on my grind and stealing my kills.  Wait till its clear to do your thing for Christ sake.
---
I did a few tests on robots in Watoga and it seems like a server sync problem. If you run up to an enemy and swing it almost always fails to connect. But if you sneak up and sit there for a little while it will land. I only tested it for about 10 mins so more testing is needed. Watoga is probably the best place to test this because robots won't agro. Their location is probably where you see them according to the server unlike mobs that agro.
---
Good to know, I'm glad that its visible now. Makes sense as to why I've seen spores spewing out of seemingly thin air before.
---
Well to be fair to them, I can understand some of their points, though I didn't agree with the overall justification or how they branded the post.
---
Anyway, I still appreciate the responses and I will perhaps one day Chally here again. For now I must wander back to the wastes of the Commonwealth to find my long lost brahmin brethren... xD
---
ok ill check it out tonight, thanks!
---
Know a guy like this, honestly I'm pretty certain that someone  chopped his dick off and he been compensating since. As you may have guessed I don't play fallout with him anymore.
---
100 % agree!
---
Psn unikron08. What armor set and mods did u want? Deep pockets or lead or dense or whatever. Please let me know so I know what to make. Also I can make weapons for You too. Rifelman you say? Handmade with all mods? Hunting rifle? Shotgun? And what level did u want for the items?  If u got mats for them, service is free. But it's more convenient to just pay caps. 1k deposit for armor set and 500 caps for weapons. Even better deal, when u have out level the items, return to me and I'll craft the next level 50% discount. For being loyal customer. Think of it as leasing armor and weapons to help while u level up. What do you think?
---
not bloodied. I would love to find one though.
---
You're argument makes absolutely no sense and at this point you're just being a dick. You have no idea if your gun is duped or not if you're buying it from someone. It being duped is entirely inconsequential if I paid a fair price for the item. I worked my ass off for those caps. It saddens me people like you exist.
---
Oops, I should have specified. Xbox One
---
Try Morgan town at level 10+
---
It's kind of punishing for someone under level 10, also maybe level up a bit in Flatwoods like you mentioned. Don't forget to upgrade your weapons and armor a bit at level 10 too.
---
HOA fees outlasting the end of the world.
---
Cleanliness Bonus +1 Charisma
---
One part letting the mod know that it was just a light-hearted joke after we debated back and forth a bit (I can't do that directly because, well, they muted me lol). 
---
But also, one part to poke at them for what I view as an overreaction to said joke. ;-)
---
They have addressed it and said they're working on it for consoles.
---
Thankfully in video games, I'm a hoarder. I had almost everything I needed once I got there (minus the two extra Black Titanium scrap I needed).
---
No they just want to give you a treat even if it is your own limbs
---
Yep I think it's Yellowcake Flux for Electrically Charged - if you don't have it I do and I can still make it either way!
---
Add me. Psn - brm138 whenever I can I’ll be a “silent body guard” when things get tricky. Game is really fun until you complete all the quests and then you have to make your own fun
---
I’m glad I’m not the only one who screamed. I thought he was a deathclaw at first and then very quickly was thrown for a loop. Terrifying.
---
Bru I dropped my chest Piece (100 something  defense) wear I so sad about it
---
Did you meet him off of here or was he a random?
---
No it’s Woolley8
---
No worries, I’ll happily jump on &amp; drop you a few things that may help. I can’t remember that far back lol but have you got a PA frame yet?
---
That is probably the single most ignorant response I have ever met. Also, one of the most ironic.
---
Hope you have fun with this totally broken game. They can't even fix majority on those problems, because they happen on the client side.  Hope next fallout game is made by different company with different engine that suits for multiplayer gaming.
---
I hate that so much.
---
Think i have a flux!? Ill have to look. Ive never gotten to much endgame stuff i beat the queen once on my other broken character but i made a new one that level 47 right now my other was 68
---
Yes, it does.
---
Yes, it's actually somewhat inconvenient because you'll sometimes find yourself over-encumbered at the most inopportune times.
---
I almost spit out my coffee reading that.
---
True.
---
Wall mounted turrets would be great, but just like any other turrets they  still need their aggression turned up a bit.  I still get rad and mole rats chewing on the foundation of my CAMP that I have to run out and kill manually because the turrets don't see them.
---
Not yet, no. Is there a quest to get one or do I just find one out in the world?
---
Rando
---
I get the opposite. 100% chance to hit in VATS, 4 or 5 shots with no impact. Have to exit and re-enter VATS to get a hit.
---
not realy. most here dont play the game and they dont even give a shit about the game. ..
---
I'm just saying I can't verify not that it's unknown or that he's wrong/lying. I'd never step on someone's toes like that.
---
If you can find the post and he can give a citation in the form of a form of a FormID or picture that would be super.
---
My plasma flamer weighs like 8 lbs and is an easy way to tag groups. Meanwhile my Gauss weighs more than my gatling laser and I don’t even have Bear Arms or whatever. 
---
I’m tempted to pick a new build that can weight reduce my main weapons.
---
8 lbs is 3.63 kg
---
Thats where the main issue with this idea is really. You would basically instance into 2 seperate interiors most likely. Your teamate in one with the normal interior with enemies and you in a completely different interior with BoS. Or help your teamate run through the questline so he can instance in the same interior with you.
---
Thanks, I didn't even know about upgrading my weapons, I thought they just came as is.
---
if stats youre meaning special points depends on weapon you wanna spec towards.. melee strength.. rifle, percption.. pistol agility.. then need to get specials for perk cards listed above.. then get luck high enough to equip starched genes and classfreak.. for extra damage luck could go higher to add in bloody mess.   
---
if going unarmed build: powerfist, mole miner gauntlet, deathclaw gauntlet, get talons mutation as well.   
---
this helps trying to decide  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)   
---
and here  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f3148fa&amp;d=pe2eu0s41ss2sn1se2sm1sg2ce0cu2ir2i44a71aj2ar1a04a12la2l71lu2lt1&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=28hc](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f3148fa&amp;d=pe2eu0s41ss2sn1se2sm1sg2ce0cu2ir2i44a71aj2ar1a04a12la2l71lu2lt1&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=28hc)  i did a quick plan for a bloodied build, there are plenty of different quality of life changes, add in marsupial or speed demon if ya wanted, stay away from anything that would -str, could do grounded or healing factor as well but should give you an idea of what it would look like and this is set for 2 handed (all rise) weapon build.. although you could drop one point from each slugger and add in 3 star iron fist so you could run 2 handed and unarmed for weapon choices..
---
If you're on in a few hours and you haven't had anyone help you out yet - I can try to make you some low level stuff to help you out and get you started when I'm off work. Farming some low level mobs is a good idea and it's a double XP weekend so that should help. 
---
I know sometimes the enemies are scaled up to higher levels so sometimes you might want to server hop to try to get more level appropriate enemies.
---
It doesn't even seem like anybody's business except OP's. I don't think it contributes anything to the sub.
---
I know how they could.
---
Since the entire point of the game is that we are supposed to be vault 76 rebuilding Appalachia not murderhobos who kill each other over acid. 
---
It's why I never lock any of my shit who cares take it you probably need it more than me.  
---
It's why you can show up to a defend a workshop event without taking it over, it's clear they went back and forth on workshops/pvp since they originally intended them to be the only C.A.M.P. until they got it working right.
---
Sincere lol
---
I’ll take a pic of you in that chair if you want!
---
Game has a really extensive crafting system you should check out the wiki
---
Out in the world, you can’t use armour until level 15 but the basic frames give you a boost.  I got my 1st @ Morgantown train yard in an army train car.
---
This is my preferred way to die in PvP.
---
"cup of Nuka Cola"
---
Bam fixed our problem.
---
Might break Cola Nut though...
---
All of the factions. Raiders, responders, BoS, enclave, etc.
---
Tell me if I'm wrong.
---
When I'm in a queen battle, my plinking the flying queen with my rifle does virtually no damage, so I usually focus on the adds. I do my best to one-shot or kill the adds quickly whether with my bloody axe or headshots.
---
The exceptions are if a Mirelurk Queen shows up...She ain't a one-shot for me by far. The Deathclaws and Yao Guai can often take multiple hits, but I try to knock 'em down fast. 
---
I do this because I believe I'm protecting the heavy gunners to keep focus on the queen.
---
Am I doing something wrong in this scenario?
---
I understand that *if I'm in a crowd of other players* and wade into Whitespring or Uranium Fever wiping out the legendaries before anybody else gets a shot in, I'm being a bit of a tool.
---
It just makes sense. If Bethesda were to make workshops "PvE only" griefers would just take all the workshops in a server and sit on them. That's way shittier than giving EVERYONE the chance at it.
---
I had a similar thing happen at my camp.  It was just sitting on the ground and I couldn't pick it up, although it wasn't tagged as stealing for me.
---
I WANT BROADSIDER TURRETS.
---
Definitely not the best way to make caps in the game. If I really wanted to I could max out all 5 characters on caps in a day.
---
It was on his character. I let him borrow my lmg and he let me borrow his tse combat shotty. My plan was to buy an aae combat shotty, give him his back and get my lmg back. Now I have two shotty's and no lmg
---
I have found one person that has the exact same lmg. Just hope he's willing to sell it
---
The sooner this is implemented the more confident I’ll feel about playing again
---
All three of my Grogs are humming along nicely at 150% condition + the damage increase and I am now determining to what level I can reduce Makeshift Warrior so the deterioration works out about the same and how many points that can free up for other perks or movement to another special tree.
---
Unless I am using it wrong the broadside is utter crap that does less than age per hit than my .38
---
Can’t do much I think. Put out a bounty. I think that if it’s explosive, that always show up
---
I think the whole backstory for 76 is great. And honestly the emptiness really does feel like wandering the barren expanses of fallout 3.
---
Thank you, I didn't know about the scaling either. I'm definitely gonna get the Hell out of Morgantown until I'm ready. Maybe set up a camp and try to figure out this crafting system. I'll make sure I'm on later too. GT: MisturGigglez
---
It's the other way too, you see so many downvotes on other posts from those saying it can only be user error and not a bug.
---
Try not fast traveling a lot and explosre a bunch. If you rush the story you be too low level for most enemies later on in the story
---
Rip, idk what all you can do except report him
---
Instigating is sorely underrated if you mostly farm solo. It's not good for boss dps (sbq and iss) but it's #1 for running in and clearing out a room, I've got an instigating dragon and hunting rifle that I'm using on my rifle toon atm. I also have a lvl 35 bloodied lever rifle ... I was so damn excited when it dropped then I saw it was lvl 35 :c .. still my best weapon for dps tho.
---
Handmade? .50 Cal? Combat shotty? 1 star bloodied is far better on all of those.
---
You can’t do anything to him sadly nor would he get into trouble since it isn’t breaking g rules to do a bad trade
---
Right there with you, dude
---
You still selling domestic tables and balloons?
---
Likely loading into the same server, but some items don’t spawn as a matter of rarity or have been removed to encourage more explorative RNG
---
I died at least 7 times, I was actually getting pretty angry at this super mutant. He just was dealing so much damage without my PA I couldn't get more than 3 or 4 shots off on him.
---
Now mind you this character isn't one of the insane AAE or BE weapon users. She had two FE weapons but recently I've been on a Vampies binge, collecting and trading all things vampires. I bought a max lvl VE assualt rifle and thought it'd  do decent damage. It does, but not this this guy for some reason? I honest thought for a second they did something to legendary monster in the last patch.
---
Only thing that worked after those 7 encumbered deaths, running back to a station and hopping in a my Classification Frustration (execvator PA). Loading up a full clip on my TSE minigun and unloading 500 rounds of pure explosive justice.
---
Makes me wonder though with everyone saying they've had at least two drop, if there is a hidden mechanic?
---
Looking up YouTube videos was a big help for me
---
Beware the Bowler and the Bowler Hat. Identical items for reasons unknown. The last time I checked, the Bowler counts, the Bowler Hat does not.
---
hmm.  On top of a bigrig...sniping.  Supressed?
---
As a melee character (not the one in question), I tend to be rather focused on attack (and survive), especially in a high level mob, with or without a legendary. 
---
Because of that focus, I may not even notice other players   until (usually, the mob) is dead.  Loot quickly, pop a radaway/stimpack, and prepare for respawn.  Its during that prep I look around...oh! theres other players here now.
---
(to that end, sorry if you didn't get a tag.  I wasn't intentionally hogging, I don't want to die, and I didn't know you were there anyway)
---
 Against gutsys/handies, I've learned to swing at the appendages, not the body - they go down faster that way - so I'm looking down, not out - so again, I likely won't see you approach.
---
Point is, if you were on top of something, player may not have even known you were there, especially if your rifle is supressed.  Unsupressed, could have been a mutant or scorched randomly firing, as they afoten seem to do.
---
I can appreciate they humor of leaving salt 
---
(and I understand the loot bag mechanic)
---
but I also thing it was presumptuous to think the player was intentionally trying to keep you from getting loot.
---
I didn't even know you could fast travel, so I'll try to stay away from it for now to make sure I don't miss things that could help
---
Good idea gives me something to use the stash of Molotov cocktails on... With a hallway as a choke point. A firing line, Now if only things would go the way I plan.....
---
Did he seem like a nice guy up until he screwed you? Usually I try to get a feel for the character of traders before the trade.
---
It's Yiddish for nothin'
---
Apparently, lots of reports
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/apgrv5/items_are_disappearing_from/
---
I hope they give us another chance to confirm. My address is changing soon and I need to update that.
---
Will do. Any channel suggestions?
---
Thank you! PM me your username and I'll add you as soon as I get home! You can also have a drink on the house at the bar on the first floor after we're done taking pics!
---
Yeah. I am Bloodied Melee, but when the backpack comes out, I can move some points to rifle and maintain my carry capacity. The unicorn is the Bloodied Explosive.
---
Yea also scrap extra weapons they give mods like if you scrap a 10mm you have more mods to put on 10mm
---
Haha that’s why I spray everything with my Gatling to get a tag on it
---
Hey it worked! All that for a shielded plan lol
---
Scientists of the wasteland, ASSEMBLE!!
---
If you really want to min/max your melee dps, unyielding armor is the way to go, but it's very glass cannon. PA excels for ranged bloodied builds, specifically heavy weapons, which can be the best ranged dps in the game while also being very safe.
---
That would be cool.
---
Wouldn’t it be great if Bethesda rolled out a Roller Coaster CAMP like system? It’d be soo much more real than RCTycoon and even planet coaster (although that guy is pretty impressive) 
---
One can dream..
---
i bought a bloodied explosive instead way better then my tses and i dont even use bloodied build the closest to that is running in with my bloodied super sledge when low
---
Good point
---
We’d be so lucky, I’m holding onto some gear for that reason but keep any legendaries of a weapon you fancy using incase you can’t add new effects
---
ESO fallout &amp; elder scrolls guides, channel5 gaming has a few videos too
---
I traded my handmade because it wasn't as powerful as a lever..and sorry man I didn't mean to come off as a smart ***
---
I was in a white springs nuke zone today and picked up at least 3 1-star legendaries from non-legendary ghouls.
---
It is lol
---
Do you have plans for the union uniform/hat?
---
So because you leave things unlocked, everyone would leave things unlocked in a workshop if it were incontestable? C'mon now.
---
Two sides to every story.
---
Perhaps I was, indeed, too salty.
---
The brotherhood in Cali reached out to military personel in Appalachia, who's to say there arent other small cells that could form a scouting party. They only lost contact with Appalachia because a commsat went down. I also used the brotherhood as just an example but i think it could work in some way.
---
Taking over workshops is good way to get some quick levels in the beginning as well as materials, aid, plans. caps, etc. I also was awarded several legendary armors from doing quick, easy events like Fertile Soil in Flatwoods. Don’t be ashamed to accept help from higher level players either. Most of us received help the same way and we are now paying it forward.
---
I’d settle for being able to find a damn camera.  It’s like a Easter egg hunt. That or the people don’t load in my servers
---
I believe that your camp stays loaded even with no player nearby so there’s no need to stay there while you wait for purified water or a resource extractor.
---
Shows up in my camp periodically since launch, usually after my camp cannot be placed and I have to jump servers. I have seen them laying around in other places also and they aren't always tagged as "steal"
---
I miss being able to pickup and place random items like nuka-cola bottle collections on a shelf. And finding plans for all the stuff you wanna build takes time and patience. Still fun to build a camp tho.
---
I ike to drop a "Free Watoga" flyer in the bags myself.
---
It was not giving me any options at all when I died, no "respawn here" or "ignore" or "seek revenge". It just respawned me automatically at the Workshop. Didn't get any options at all until I cleared the (fairly large) workshop boundary before dying again. (Thunder Mountain)
---
I do not apologies
---
Big rip
---
Really seems like it may be hit or miss, the thing that had me quite hype was the fact there were legendaries of multiple different stars
---
I've got a 1 star bloodied. I have a feeling I'd just kill myself if I made a build and used it tho lol.
---
Have you figured this out? These aren't working for me. What happens after the quest disappears? What is the next step?
---
I've not encountered one yet, can you cripple its legs like the deathclaw and make them a non-issue?
---
I haven't made a full on stealth sniper build with the lever yet, but I'd like to. They seem very good - less dps but much higher burst.
---
Glassed Caverns regularly resets after so long, looting Tagardy at the end has a random chance of 1-2 BOS Armor Pieces
---
They kind of do come "as is", the upgrading part is slightly more complicated.
---
I meant upgrade to a better weapon at level 10. Most weapons have leveled versions in level increments of 5 (15,25,35,45) or 10's (10,20,30,40,50) level wise. So if you have a level 5 gun or the Machete you got at level 1, you will outgrow those. You can graft your own weapons and armor at the appropriate work bench. 
---
Your weapons and armor can also be upgraded in the sense that you can mod them using work benches, for example, you can add scopes to guns, or a suppressor to silence the gunshot. there are also other mod categories for weapons, barrel, receiver, stock and so forth. Same for armor.
---
Go to a weapon and armorworkbench in flatwoods and go to the "craft" section. You will they see what kinds of weapons and armor types you can currently craft, as well as what kinds of mods you currently know. 
---
Be sure to watch the condition of your weapons and don't let them break. Return to the appropriate work bench to repair them.
---
Lastly crafting most things beyond basic weapons and armor requires a plan, same for mods. You'll learn plans for some weapon and armor mods by scrapping the same type or weapon or armor. These is a random process. You can also find plans as you adventure. 
---
So those weapon and armor you pick up but don't need? You can scrap them for parts and might learn a plan in the process.
---
Good luck.
---
This has been suggested and asked for repeatedly for months and nothing's happened, I doubt there are plans to implement this, they must have their reasons.
---
Because the max you get from water purfiers is 5 or 3, if you want to make a profit, you going to have to empty them, but you right, they produce no matter if you there or not.
---
Medic legendary effect.
---
Crit spam perk build.
---
I play medic for my group of friends, but haven't really run into a fight that it's been truly needed.
---
Maybe these new raids might change that and really up the difficulty.
---
I don't understand why all the maps are missing the most important piece of information. Where is the closest place I can go to scrap stuff?
---
Oh I'm sorry I didn't realize you wanted me to literally do Beths job for them. 
---
Well why don't you write up a bulletpointed list of all the reasons you dont' think it'd work, I'll round up a focus group and some devs and we can hammer this out after my lunch break is over.
---
What's my commission.

But wait he ended it with the whole “I’m quitting and it matters” thing so
---
This would have been awesome if you were level 15-30. I'm lvl.205 and still waiting for my first TSE.  Got some SSE's along the way, but no TSE
---
Yeah, but at least people will know about him. And hopefully not trade with him. What an asshole
---
On PC, I don't have that as a daily challenge.
---
with all of the perks along with tormentor bloody mess covert ops..it's unbelievable ..I had to get a second lever TSE..I also own bloodied furious AA levers..love them all
---
Yeah, but not everyone runs a hoarder build. I get to 340 with my shocks bonus. That's PLENTY for the way I play, when carrying my load out, i am 160 lbs. The backpack and the pocket bonuses would really be gravy and helpful.
---
Game has so much potential. I look forward to what else they add in the future :)
---
 LOL. A little insurance is what you want. It will destroy the tension though.
---
 I like it like it is myself. Mistakes are always possible and that is good. ;)
---
Enclave bunker has a ton of desk fans. Maybe over a dozen
---
My IGN is Molybzen, and thanks! I’ll definitely do all that. But I forgot that I’m in Europe, I don’t if I’ll be ready when you’ll be back since I’m about to go to sleep.
---
Yep, my shotgun turrets should have dispatched the most basic enemy, but they've just sat there, completely dumb!
---
Ok here's the bullet point, because I only need one.
---
- you're relying on the goodwill of players to make incontestable workshops an even playing field.
---
Thank you so much! I'm sure this will be a huge help as I get into the swing of things
---
Or even just not having equipped or favorited stuff show up at all on vendor or scrapping screens would probably work. 
---
Here's to hoping that something is done to fix the issue soon...
---
Slick! Love that chair
---
MOAR!!!
---
Yes I do have stabilized yellowcake flux.
---
I have the camera now, i found the guy in the water park, my friends found in Whitespring.
---
How ya been? Freaked anyone else out? Lol
---
No worries, whenever you're available, shoot me a PM and we'll meet!
---
Most vendors have static plans now, some plans are missing, some are still rng but only a few. This was there way of making sure we get access to all the plans instead of server hopping. They raised prices to justify it but still managed to screw it up.
---
Same thing in Mutant
---
;)
---
They said they improved energy weapons’ durability. Today I pulled out my tse laser to give it a try. In the past it would break before I could kill a few super mutants, today I killed about thirty scorched before it broke. Better than before yes, useful for anything more than casual pew pew in the backyard? Hell no, it’s not a weapon for the wasteland.
---
Sounds fantastic!
---
With these perks you'll have more healing than you'll know what to do with: Chemist, First Aid, Field Surgeon, Team Medic, and Traveling Pharmacy. Super Duper also helps.
---
Just farm ticks for a while and make a bunch of stimpacks and diluted stimpacks. It sounds harder than it is, server hopping a couple times yields quite a bit. Chemist makes it so you produce twice the usual amount and Super Duper can double that. First Aid and Field Surgeon make diluted stims very effective and allow you to top everyone off whenever you want, and Traveling Pharmacy will allow you to carry hundreds at a time.
---
I messed around with both Friendly Fire and medic weapons and found them both very situational and this was way more effective.
---
Haha trying to. But atm me and my buddies are trying out this vendor market thing. We will be on tonight if you wanna come check it out. I'll post it again when we are rdy
---
In his defense, the line between “news” and “spoilers” is rather vague nowadays. 
---
All I’ve seen is Atom Shop dataminers. It’d be tough to spoil a power armor skin without seeing the actual images
---
I had something like this happen to me with my roof. I have a 3x2 roof and I noticed that the roof in the middle was poking out on the one side, but all the others were fine. I rotated the piece and everything was fixed
---
How the hell do you one shot? Jesus Christ I’m lvl 130 and scorched take 1-2 hits and those flying assholes take about 8. How is everyone so OP in this game?
---
Keep to the top left side of the map until you level up. Gets harder on the right, especially bottom right 😊
---
Fuck this downvote boy.
---
I've sold my hazmat suit 4 times now and had to go get a new one.
---
Sold my All Rise and managed to get it back from the vendor after fast traveling back.
---
So yeah inventory locks would be a plus.
---
Lab coat and medical goggles/welding helmet with road goggles
---
Oh dude definitely.
---
You...
---
You understand that Bethesda would change the game right?
---
The entire point of this conversation and thread?
---
I honestly cant get onto a server where it hasn't already been triggered. So I haven't even had the chance to try...
---
I suggest that everyone carry a tesla rifle if possible. Not even for damage, dont worry about perks. Just make sure you have passive mode on
---
That's epic
---
I'm not sure why you would need junk weight reduction perks for survival.
---
Also, you do not want to use Dodgy or scaly skin if you are going to be sprinting. Scaly skin reduced total AP and dodgy takes away even more whenever you take damage. You won't be getting much use out of cavaliers as you won't be able to sprint as much as you think you will be. 
---
Anyone can just shoot you, drain your AP, then kill you through cavaliers when you stop sprinting.
---
It increases everything, except endurance.
---
Heres some updoots
---
Yeah sounds good. Could you upgrade the heavy leather armor with whatever mod increases the basic defense. If you could craft level 30 armor, that would be great. If that doesnt exist just go with the next lowest level.
---
For weapons, I have a lever action rifle, and if you could upgrade it to be the best receiver that would be great.
---
Yes and I literally asked "How". You're retort was "I know how" followed by some irrelevant bs about not locking things so everyone could take it. So what you're saying now is you have no idea how.
---
Same, just last night I had to go through the Xbox live menu to join a friend because the in game social menu said everyone was offline including people I could see in the map.
---
Yo delete this ish lmao. It’s the only evidence on here
---
VERY nice!  Thanks for all the hard work!
---
I've updated the dictionary sir.
---
I use the Perk Loadout Manager and it can be a bit op once you get used to using it. If you have max Strength and Agility you can freely swap into almost any weapon meta (minus the armor) except shotguns in seconds
---
* I can use heavy guns against a SBQ or SB and swap to a melee build in the time it takes it to start and finish its landing animation. Max damage in the air, max damage in melee range.
---
* I can walk around with all my weight, looting, and pick/hack perks on swap and then swap to a combat build in under 2 seconds. I get the best of both worlds when looting places like Wes-Tek by being unencumbered when walking and fully buffed and Whiteknighted as soon as I see/hear a super mutant.
---
* If you can get 3 seconds of cover on Survival you can swap build types extremely fast. Tab-&gt;Q-&gt;3-&gt;Esc. There, I just went from my sniper build to my heavy weapons build before you made it half way to me.
---
So yeah, since there is a mod doing, I think everyone should get it so everyone is on equal ground. If the suggestion of making passive perks permanent abilities became or 2 perk trees, one for combat and one for passive, I think that would also remove the need to constantly need to swap perks and the need for loadout.
---
Im getting on now
---
I really hope it's just for the area immediately around the golf club. Whitesprings is too nice a location to just lock it all off.
---
I've been thinking the same thing, would really love this!
---
It absolutely would have, but I was in my upper 100’s and specced to heavy weapons when it dropped. I held on to it for about 50 more levels thinking I would save it for another character. I eventually needed the stash space and put it in the ice cooler at the Whitespring.
---
Do keep in mind though that taking a workshop automatically flags you for PvP.  Store your junk/scrap often to avoid losing it if you die.
---
I’m only 125 and ~200 hours in, and my biggest hurdles are perk load outs and a bit better respec system
---
I love this photo!
---
they pretty much lied to us, and now they expect us to be okay with this? what happened to bethesda of old?
---
Anti-Armor, Swing Speed + 1Strength Level 15 Combat knife
---
*\*pulls all salt out of STASH\**
---
This is why I love my suppressor automatic Tesla during horde events. 
---
Makes sure I tag everything myself while intentionally not one shotting anything.
---
&gt;I am starting to think TSE weapons need to be removed as its killing the game i will walk over do oh every thing is dead. I will go kill SBQ oh wait she is all ready dead 3 seconds in.
---
If the SBQ is dead that quick it's not from TSE weapons! I think you may be thinking of bloodied melee weapons, those are the ones with &gt;1k damage per hit. Even with that,  I e never seen the SBQ taken down so quickly that everyone couldn't get a tag in. 
---
My TSE combat shotgun with all the assorted SG perks, arguably the most damaging of ranged weapons,  still takes dozens of hits to kill her.
---
Yup. It's a pain and was noted in the player built [bug roundup](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bbp7wy/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_patch_8/) and showed up in patch 8 I think. But still upvoting for visibility because annoys the heck out of me too.
---
Learn to read. If a weapon is explosive it will always show.
---
Ahhhhh I’ve only been to Camden park a couple of times . I need to revisit
---
That hurts
---
Nigel Thornberry is getting sh*t done, smashing!
---
Take my upvote for someone downvoting you
---
Or like maybe offer a polite response that’s like not pandering and rude?
---
Look out for horde events if you just storm in and kill the boss then loot him you'll get some decent three star legendary gear. The horde events in the forest, toxic valley and ash heap will have stuff that you can use at your level or just above.
---
No Im saying this game is ass
---
What’s your gt?
---
NP.
---
If you don't melee, it's not necessarily something that would even cross your mind.
---
Thanks! Perfect transaction.
---
He mouthed off to me in game a few days ago and was rude. Karma sucks. Couldnt have happened to a nicer guy.
---
I thought the same thing. I ended up putting mine on my coffee table "watching tv". Totally wanted them on my bed though.
---
I'm normally quite helpful
---
&gt;There is a way to respawn Whitesprings golf club, once you clear it, in one minute. Yet, there is no guide on how to do that on here. No one on youtube is making a video on how to do it. 
---
It's not about selfishness,  it's about not wanting Beth shutting down this "trick". Which will happen if they feel it's being exploited..so thanks?
---
Ah, dookie. Clearly I didn’t know that a someone just kindly explained it to me. Glad to see you kept that charm from the other night. Ur consistent if anything
---
Just keep exploring and fighting as best you can. It gets easier as you level up + it’s important to learn things. Don’t rush it. Enjoy it
---
Try a brothel
---
Remain, I'm pretty certain. They would have said otherwise.
---
My apologies then.  Sorry it’s a messy bitch sitch!
---
Rug glitch the windmills, that’s amazing. Use that technique quite often but never considered that. Well done, camp looks great!
---
Only with dbags like yourself. Im one of the more helpful people in the community.
---
Haha nice
---
I deleted the thread because you were ultimately Right about that. 
---
However I had an unrelated problem with the atomic shop and I can confirm if it’s worth it to you and it’s understandable- they will fix what you are asking for as at least a one time thing.
---
MisturGigglez
---
I'm level 36, and I've lost count of the number of times I've forgotten to change out Hard Bargain for my other Charisma perk cards.
---
I'd love to be able to quickly switch out perk cards. Or have some of the non-combat cards moved to a passive perk deck.
---
Would you also mind making me a level 30 hunting rifle with mods?
---
You started cussing me out bc I opened a trade with 50 seconds left on a SBQ wipe. It was u who mouthed off big guy
---
For now I've just been renaming everything with a ! at the front of the name so it stays at the top of the list. Helps to prevent accidents from sell spamming.
---
You're welcome. A lot of other people in these comments deserve thanks more than me, too. I gave up farming it the other day, and they're keeping it going essentially 😂
---
Lots of great suggestions so far. I haven't seen events suggested yet though.  Doing events as often as possible will net you XP, caps and (depending on the event) resources, aid and sometimes weapons/armor or plans/recipies.
---
Some events may be too much to handle solo, but look for the ones you can complete and run them as often as you can until you 'outgrow' them level-wise.
---
Sometimes they trigger by proximity as well, so be sure to wander by the ones you find that work well for you on a daily basis. Keep an eye on the map as well for them. Often you'll find that other players will be doing them which makes them easier to complete. 
---
I'm on PC so I can't offer any direct help. Lots of folks out there that like helping new players though. Best of luck!
---
Loooooooool
---
Yes but they oddly just stand still and don’t move when it happens.
---
Oh no. I don't have mods for lever rifle. I haven't scrapped enough of those. I've scrapped plenty of handmades though. 
---
I think there is level 30 leather. Studded is highest def mod. What about secondary mod? Pockets? I'll be on in a bit. Just feeding kids lunch.
---

There were 3 minutes left and a SBQ fight is not the place to be trading. Either shoot or dont show up.
---
Tapewyrm0, shoot me an invite when you’re on &amp; I’ll drop you a few things.
---
I can do the hunting rifle. You want suppressor? Reflex sight or recon? Long scope?
---
You sir are doing Gods work.
---
Missing: South Mountain Lookout (west of the monorail elevator)
---
Ok. For the secondary mod could I do pocketed? Dont worry about the lever action. Can you just make me a level 30 hunting rifle with the best mods you can give it?
---
Totally agree.  Breaking down ones you've combined, and the ability to trade them with other players (like the very thing they're styled after) would be a massive improvement as well.
---
"Mow your lawn!"
---
"We don't allow that type of tree in front yards!"

"Repaint your house, it looks like a dump!"
---
Stupid HOA.
---
I have noticed this too, and I use level 5 gunsmith, does it not work just because I'm in power armor? I mean that's beyond stupid
---
That's a good idea! You can definitely level up while working on your camp and I can try to give you some extra camp plans that I have to help you out and maybe an outfit if you like that sort of thing! 
---
Do you know if you like melee weapons or guns more? I can make you a bit of both if you prefer :)
---
Feel free to shoot me a message on Xbox as well so I can help you when I get on - my GT is the same as on here!
---
I have 1550 caps, so hopefully that is enough to cover everything. Ill supply the resources I can
---
Just do the brotherhood storyline to get that armor and save your mats for the XO1.
---
Very kind of you
---
Also, his Gt should have clued you in. Guess he did a buckjob on you.
---
I would suggest storing your junk often regardless but yes good point. Again though, most players will run up and help you if they see a player being overrun by a large mob. Out of the dozens of times I took over a workshop, I was only attacked maybe 3 times. I would just hop to another server if that happens. It’s not worth fighting or being on a server with people that want to pick fights on Adventure Mode.
---
Alright Thanks
---
Awesome - can you go ahead an shoot me a message on xbox (GT is the same as on here) and i can make that for you when I get home :)
---
25 caps with flux
---
Yea not too sure about the cav with guns. Was this a melee build once? You’re running explosive guns so a good idea would be to demolition expert.
---
If there was a fail video of my time in 76, a solid 50% would be of dying to robot explosions.  
---
&lt;wait....wait......  well I guess they don’t explode anymore.....BOOM&gt;
---
The other 50% would be grenades that are really exploding boomerangs.
---
Probably the biggest QoL change that could be added.
---
Sweet, thank you. I'll write it down. I'll be on and off throughout this evening
---
Is this an extension of the miscellaneous quest I saw come up today simply saying 'Investigate Watoga'? Or am I just a n00b
---
If you took pictures previously I would imagine the very small amount of pictures you took filled the album you need to delete some.

The one i did was in the mire. I was lvl 54.

---
I never said I'm quitting, and I don't know what 'it matters' is supposed to mean, lol.
---
I'm not quitting. I've played over 200 hours so far and it's time for a break. I was hoping Nuclear Winter was a hardmode to freshen up the challenge, but the latest teaser didn't really suggest that, so chances are good I won't see the challenge I need until mods come around.
---
Taking a breather is more accurate. Don't try to turn an innocent comment into more than it is. ;-)
---
Totally agreed, wish turret campers hadn't spoiled it!
---
They fixed this in patch 7 and broke it again in patch 8. I've been trying to put this info in all the patch threads out there, hopefully they fix it again.
---
Make sure you try to ski down the double brown diamond
---
Based on what we know it won't happen like that.   Legendary versions of squatch weapons might drop later tho.
---
Okay thankyou for the feedback :) I’ll get rid of dogdy and not use scaly skin.
---
No suppressor. Can we do the best receiver you have in damage, long scope, improved ammo cap, and the stock that makes it look cool?
---
We need it really bad :/ You would think that's what the favorites would do you know?
---
Congrats!  I haven’t completed that quest yet, I bought the plans for the power armor bench instead.  Im having trouble with finding black titanium, and then I kept running into high level enemies on the way to the basement to build the excavator armor.  One important trick everyone needs to know, jump servers until no enemies exist  or just low level enemies exist where you need to go.
---
This is a build in progress I have a character im leveling this weekend for double xp. Is demo expert really worth it anymore with its nerf and all? I haven’t seen much of an increase in damage on my main when I equip the perk.
---
Any help at all is great! I never expected such an outpouring of support on here. I'll send a message for sure. In most fallouts I prefer guns because I usually go for high intelligence/luck/charisma builds
---

Give it a minute, or it will put you back where you were.
---
I've also found it's very easy to vendor an item you don't mean to, as seen here: https://imgur.com/85jfN8N
---
I had selected the short gatling gun to sell. But when the confirmation box popped up, it didn't properly lock the background menu from hover over interaction. So when I hovered over other things, they could be sold, even though the confirmation box was initialized by clicking on the original item.
---
Instead of selling the gatling gun, I ended up selling the hardened combat sniper rifle. This has happened to me previously, thought it'd be good to record it. I don't know if this is an official known bug or not.
---
It has been suggested before. I personally think you should be able to do everything from any menu (almost any, not from crafting) 
---
In your stash menu? Ok move that, drop this, lock that, favorite this, mark that for sale, mark this for breaking down, etc...
---
I've already explained why but will again. I can't message the mods cause they muted me over the joke, so I wrote my response on the forums.
---
It's not meant to contribute to the sub, and as stated, I expected it to be both received by the mod in question, and deleted in a timely manner. I'm quite surprised that the thread still exists. :o
---
What? 
---
I said pay me
---
Who taught you how to read? 
---
since you've agreed all you have to do is make Workshop loot instanced like cargo drops used to be before they nerfed that to encourage PVP/Survival Mode.
---
I have a camp just down the road. Camden park is my favorite place to loot! Tons of plastic, enough enemies to either scrap or trade their weapons, lots of crafting mats, a PA suit, and random plans.
---
I was thinking the other day they should take all the 76, 760 challenges and just keep adding a zero to both reward and requirement and keep that going like a Preston’s Garvey questline
---
 Yup. That would be nice.
---
😯😭☹😫😓
---
1 min left on a clear sbq wipe and a trade offer triggered u and You threw a tantrum. But “dookieinyourhat” thinks I’m the dbag

Nailed it!

That sounds good to me - I like to run with a lot of luck myself. Int definitely has a lot of great perks to in this game. I will see what I can make you when I get on.

---
Thanks, I'll look at added it when I get home tonight
---
Keep revising history. Youre probably a Democrat. They do that a lot.
---
No worries at all.
---
Mine have been stuck too, but only because they aren’t giving atoms away with easy challenges anymore.  I guess they want compensation via atom purchasing with real money for all the updates they have created and will create.  Which makes sense I guess.  But if something really cool comes to the shop I may have to spend real money.  I’m on the fence about that.
---
message me to send a friend invite.
---
Bunker and WS general are my go-to spots when I run low.
---
What is the purpose of technical data?
---
For those who play Rust or are aware - I can’t help but feel that the Rust weekly store pricing tiers would greatly benefit the Atom store. 
---
I could see myself being way more generous on buying Atoms if the prices to get them were reduced by at least 40%
---
I found one at the giant teapot. The tourist was sprawled over the picnic table by the playground. Good Luck!

My group uses far fewer stimpacks when my medic is in play

If you want the best chair with all the new features, buy the electrical one. I hear it can even warm your head.   
---
And your desk might have termites, watch out for those.
---
Sorry you got scammed bro. Attention to detail in the future. Have a nice day.
---
The problem is high level players who forget that the game isn't just for high level players
---
Like other people stated, they are all STASH boxes. However, if you build your CAMP in an area with suitcases already there you can use those as temporary storage. If you log out all that stuff will stay on that server and you can't get it back unless you have a friend there and rejoin.
---
I understood you, my reply was supposed to be a weakly humorous remark about the sometimes unproductive process of investigation and intent vs result, not that I thought you were being dismissive towards anyone, nor was I trying to be towards you.  I'll try to clear up any confusion I caused here a bit: 
---
You posted yesterday: Why the "Kill an Alien" challenge works with Flatwoods Monster and the "Take a Picture" weekly does not (Proofs Included).
---
One of the respondents was u/recession.  I replied under one of his comments that I thought maybe the Zetans would be released yesterday since the real Sheepsquatch had been also.
---
He responded today with the statement that the data miners had determined the Zetans were being released with the Nuclear Winter DLC coming out later.
---
I was reading;  Ok Beth, where's the Alien? today and passed this along under one of your comments and viola! here we are.  You should be able to see all this by following the thread of your post yesterday.
---
Truth is, I'm not into data mining nor am I trying to investigate for information as regards this challenge not functioning, as you are.  I suggest you contact u/recession for explanation as to his comment about the Zetans.
---
Sorry for any confusion and I hope you publish any knowledge gleaned.  I will certainly read it.
---
There are certain things in life you just can't let others borrow!
---
This might be doable on a game that doesn't use a single player engine moulded into a multiplayer one (impressive in its own right).
---
Don't get your hopes up.
---
Did you happen to find the key up there on the coaster?
---
He should have favorited the weapon. They added another option window to make sure you want to take the action now. So that that doesn't happen so much.
---
What is it that makes power armour bad? Shouldn't good power armor have the best base DR in the game? I'm level 20, Should I avoid power armour or are you only talking about it being bad for PVP at the highest level?..
---
I know the struggle of moving points here and there after switching builds lol.  It’s worth it if that’s all you’re running as in explosive guns, but nerd rage is always better.
---
I definitely need to go back there. I don’t spend much time in ash heap, I’m camped near the twin lakes so it’s over the other side of the map for me
---
How about the PVP requiring that both people actually be in the workshop?  And upon death the owner has lost the workshop and the challenger now owns it?  And PVP ends when the workshop has changed hands?  And if the challenger drops his claim before taking it over completely, PVP is then cancelled?
---
How about those reasonable changes?
---
I agree.  They need to drop a little.  I’ve been on the fence about spending more real money.  It seems the challenges have gotten tougher and the atoms Aren’t coming in the way they used to.  So I’ve had to let a lot of sales slip by.
---
Yes was talking about this the other day. Would be such a quality of life improvement! 👍👍👍
---
That would beat the shit out of server stability, but, ok.
---
This is lovely! I’ve been doing the same thing with my build- slowly adding decorations and detail to creative a ‘lived in’ and cosy home vibe  :)
---
Because all the "Participation Medal" kids are the demographic now which is ridiculously sad.  Whoa is me! I can have my stuff destroyed in a POST APOCALYPTIC WASTELAND GAME! Change it or I wont play! Whaaaa whaaaaa whaaaa Im offended, everything isnt exactly how I want it! Whaaaa change it! Change it! Change it! 
---
Id LOVE to see what would happen if these overly sensitive pansies play something from before the internet like Transylvania! I CANT LAND ON THE THING AND THAT GUY KEEPS DOING THE THING THAT KILLS ME! 
---
😂 FO76 was fun when it came out...now its just a cash grab piece of shit (and Ive been a Big Beth fan since THE Fallout...and its only been downhill since 2 [New Vegas was a glimpse of hope but they botched that too])
---
Oh, cool. It makes the skull on the staff look bloody.
---
&gt; If you want a workshop, but you want total PVP immunity when you're not at the workshop, you shouldn't take any workshops
---
I hope you understand how stupid this statement sounds.
---
I am going online now for a little bit. My PSN ID is atherrie.
---
That facial expression though!
---
It would have to be something very special in order for me to buy the Atoms.
---
...what? I've been skipping all of these formal wear dailies/weeklies for months, thinking that it's some rare specific outfit like in fallout new vegas. You can literally just wear a fucking bathrobe?
---
It's not stupid. If you don't want to deal with PVP, don't take workshops. Duh
---
Can do, I believe it takes stabilized yellow flux. I am on the Xbox.
---
Yeah all we need is an “ABC” type special load out, each character gets 3 load outs and you change en as needed, like warframe.
---
got gud. lol nah
---
a lot of instigating or bloodied definitely pack a huge punch combos with drugs and perks make shit heavy
---
"If you want a workshop" ..... "you shouldn't take any workshops"
---
Obviously if OP wants a workshop, not taking a workshop is a stupid suggestion.
---
That could be a step in the right direction. It would mean original holder could still "troll" by holding onto it and not letting anyone use it, and theres not much you could do to stop them. However if they actually wanted the resources they'd have to come fight for them. So somewhat plausible, but they could still grief the server by just taking everything and going about their business, never going back.
---
It’s an acronym for MODUS. You can complete the challenge by taking a picture of the big server in the Enclave bunker.
---
always has been worth playing
---
Yeah took me a moment but figured that out, but thanks :)
---
Being allowed to swap perk cards in combat seems like a design flaw.
---
Grafton Steel has a bunch in the lockers throughout the complex
---
And obviously you can't read, cause OP wants PVP immunity, which isn't a thing at all when you take workshops. You can want to take a workshop all you want, but if you also want to be protected from PVP, then you shouldn't take workshops. Period. Doesn't take a genius to understand that. 🙄
---
The theory about holding onto legendaries with desired type and effect were on a good hunch, but Patch 8 changed a lot of things. For example, I had to cut out all data before patch 8 as Watoga city drops as the robots there can no longer become legendaries. 
---
The second difficulty comes from holding onto too many items which then skews the chances (I am still getting a bit more items based on kept ones, but also got less from those I actually wanted). 
---
Third, I believe they changed the 3\* dropping 3\* chances from 40% down to 20% or there is a global \~5.3% 3\* drop chance, which is then ratiod based on luck. For example, luck 10 will give 26.5% chance for a 3\* enemy but then 5.3%/26.5% = 20% for it to drop a 3\* item.
---
The fourth problem is that all enemies can practically drop anything from a pool of 200 items, thus if one wants a specific item type, i.e., 10 variants of handmades, you'd have to farm 2000 legendaries with no loot-bias and possibly 700-900 items with loot biasing. Also not to mention when you get a lvl 35 instead of a lvl 45 because of those lvl 42 Feral Ghouls...
---
I love it only complaint is it needs a buff it should be as strong as at least fog crawlers
---
@bethesda PLEASE hear us and add the 3 lines on trade windows showing the 3 effects of a Weapon/Armor!!!
---
No, there’s a key?
---
I normally go for the sheepsquatch imposter outfit / ritual bindings outfit for my gauntlet but I think you're looking for a little bit of sophisticated psycho so I would suggest perhaps one of the golf outfits or some of the slacks+tshirt/sweater outfits for the Friendly Businessman during the day / killer by night kind of look? Slightly larger eyes on your character + a more grinning mouth (you can upturn the corners of your mouth in character creation) is unsettling as well.
---
Got yeah, and thanks. The name was misspelled so I didn't notice he had commented. I'll try to track down the source so I can see what info I'm missing and refine my process ;)
---
You can keep down voting me all you want (might want to learn WHY to down vote a post) but it doesn't take a genius to see that the OP is SUGGESTING a CHANGE in the way it works.  Coming in here saying "derr hurr don't take workshops cuz that's the way it works" provides absolutely nothing to the conversation.
---
Yeah supposedly theyre different difficulties depending on where it happens, Forest is Easy, Savage Divide is Medium and Mire is Hard. I can definitely confirm Forest is easy mode because that’s the only one of the three I’ve been able to solo.
---
You willing to take PRs?
---
I just use the T-60.   Parts can be found in the wild.
---
That sucks but pets shouldn't be off limits lol they're apart of ur camp
---
Not sure what you mean. I didn’t mean you couldn’t take a workshop if both people weren’t there, just that pvp wouldn’t start. If someone has a workshop, someone else initiates a takeover and the owner doesn’t come to defend it, they just lose it - and then pvp is over.
---
Nicely done!
---
I really hope so as well! I love everything about it\~ And it looks amazing with the ritual / sheepsquatch outfits!
---
The tourist spawns on of the tables at the Giant Teapot in case anyone wants to know the exact location.
---
There's a movie about this.
---
Yikes! I don’t think many of the one-hit-kill players are aware of this. I just started playing a week ago so I haven’t participated in any events yet, but if I had then I would have been blasting through the entire place doing one-hit-kills like crazy, completely unaware that it was ruining drops for everyone else! I’m used to playing the old Fallout where it’s just me, so I would have thought everyone was able to access every drop whether they did the killing or not. So, thanks for saying something! Now I know to keep some low-level weapons on hand. 
---
Anyone who has a headset should mention this to other players so us Fo76 noobs can learn important things like this.
---
Wait is this why no one accepted my team invite when I just wanted to get to the nuke zone? I was low-level at the time.
---
John wick?
---
Awesome, thanks.
---
Yeah. I don't want to give everything away, but if you check the other set of cars on the coaster you should find a  key that leads you to a location with raider PA. As your almost level 25, that may prove to be useful to you.
---
That's why always check if any lurkers are around.
---
Never change dookie. I'm sure we'll cross again, til then. Pce
---
Yes. Time to go John Wick on them.
---
I would play more if we didnt have a half assed respec system.
---
IIRC, a long time ago, pets used to respawn when you relocated your CAMP.  Kind of wish that was still an option.
---
Can you link a source of what was found? It's not that I doubt it, the aliens and their weapons aren't referenced to spawn anywhere and I want to see what data I passed over.
---
I'm willing to contribute if I can!
---
What are you on
---
&gt; shooting everything... combat knife
---
Hahaha, God I wish I could. I tried logging out before he got to it. I heard the last breath escape him as I left...
---
You can get a lot from the Charleston herald as well as the building attached to it - you want to pick up all type-writers, desk fans, hot plates and globes if there are any! You can also do Sugar Grove and the other little radio shaped icons in that area (sorry I forgot the names of the radio arrays.)
---
Really?  I thought it was tougher than the Fog Crawler.
---
What platform?
---
Imma keep downvoting you cause you keep saying stupid stuff. OP's suggestion is a dumb one, they're not gonna just make you "safe" from PVP when you have a workshop and aren't at the workshop. That's dumb, and not how it works. The game tells you that you're going to be in PVP when you take a workshop. If you take a workshop, and complain later cause someone showed up to take it/contest it and you die, well then tough. Deal with it. You literally signed up to PVP when you took the workshop.
---
If you don't want to PVP, play in adventure and stay in pacifist mode, and don't take workshops or do anything that would enter you into PVP. It's literally that simple. Anyways. 🙄
---
Ah. Ok, my bad. I do like that idea. The only issue I can see is a reasonable "agreeable" time limit. Attackers will cry it takes too long, and defenders will cry not long enough. Lol
---
All the ones I've seen are 3*
---
Absolutely. It's pretty time consuming trying to find them.
---
It does. The last discussion I had on this we agreed that swapping perk cards should have the same restrictions as Fast Travel. That was the mod can't be used as a borderline cheat. I'd never use it in PvP but the option is there.
---
Well in health maybe but damage not so much my friend can tank it easily and while i get he was in PA he has more problems with death claws and crawlers
---
I figured you were high level when you got it.  I hope someone found it before the server reset. I got a level 40 SSE harpoon once and found a level 41 to give it to.
---
yes hopefully when we get the passive camp changes that will include our tames
---
I'd probably sack off ironclad, adamantium skeleton and white Knight. Any maintenance perks can be swapped in as and when you need to use them.
---
Your build seems very fluffy, as in it suits the commando role play but are you aiming to min max? Because splitting between melee, rifles and vats/ stealth is stretching how efficient you are are at each one individually.
---
I wish they were off limits to - or at least essential so that they would just get "knocked down" like in FO4 and you could stimpack them. Sadly lost my Deathclaw to some anglers because someone spawned near my camp and they showed up the other day. No luck finding a new one yet.
---
Ya Pull away, been awhile since I've worked w/that, usually a solo contributor
---
Sent you a dam about the TSE combat shotgun
---
There is already a time limit - the time it takes the flag to go down and back up. The point is that there’s no way to give up a workshop, so griefers can attack again and again. If the shop became owned by them (or unowned) they would only get one kill. If the owner wanted it back, he’d have to contest it.
---
I think people need to stop spamming buttons like braindead chimps.
---
I've literally never dropped or sold or scrapped an item I didn't want to.
---
 There are no plans for an X0-1 Jet Pack. You have to get the mod from the Enclave and its not cheap. The mod does drop from the SBQ event ... randomly, I'm told.
---
I got it last night for killing a Flatwoods Monster. I had the alien and Flatwoods Monster left and they both had checks when I killed it. Supposed to be impossible though so is it a glitch?
---
Camps getting an immunity to damage from non-hostile players in Adventure mode is a change that is going to be implemented in a future update.
---
The spawn at the top right of the map has yielded the best results. It's a 2 for 1 random most of the time.
---
Very true. Though I think considering loading times and whatnot, maybe a little longer. They really just need to give us a damn way to relinquish workshops.
---
People grew tired of combat rifles on fo4, also drum mags
---
Well mate u are doing something wrong, i get it to 120. Plus 2,5x sneak plus bloody mess plus tank killer. I can one shot 3 star legendary necrofages and 2 star warlords. Easy to get, craft, mod and build up, it's the perfect weapon to start a sneak build.
---
Bloodied builds are not too hard to manage. Just be a little more aware of health and radiation.
---
I get radiated to 60%. Then watch out for radsponge which can mess things up. Life saving and autostim perks help you manage things.  
---
Make it easier with a set of 2x bolstering and 3x unyielding armor. Extra protection, extra SPECIAL boosts all add up.
---
In the end, your health fluctuates between 40% and dead, with varying but massive damage in that range. I added ghoulish in nuke runs, and hardly use any stimpacks. Just diluted radaway to keep pushing the rads back down. Radresist and radicool would be great, but I can't find room in the cards for them.
---
Yep! That's where I got my first child!
---
I am lvl 76 atm, with no mutations, if u had mutations i think the dmg can get to 5k easily
---
Again read up on the proper use of a downvote/upvote.  Ahh who am I kidding, you are one of those who refuse to see anything outside of their narrow minded viewpoint.  Have fun with that when you become an adult.
---
I’ve had him spawn outside between RobCo and Generals steakhouse
---
Same. I seem to be the cowgirl.
---
Drum mags are bae. Sucks they don't have the stinging or penetrating prefix.
---
Already am an adult, just hate dumb people who refuse to grasp how workshops and PVP work. Obviously, you're one of them. Good luck with all that denial
---
You make a good point, they could have a closer cell now that this is what they are doing
---
People want to complete things as quickly as possible to move on and do the next thing. Who kills stuff slow on purpose?
---
still, more ammo, and AAE ones dont need those prefixes
---
If you’re available real quick I am on and can buy the laser
---
I think it’s a combination of “Oh someone else will get it” and “Why should I have to use my stimpacks?”
---
So laziness and selfishness.
---
I don't mind knowing skins are coming up, but quest content is another thing altogether
---
I have yet to do it. Thanks for the advice.  I will make sure I grab a pylon the help with the event when I get to it.
---
Because someone else will do it for them.
---
I run a bloodied build, and I started doing these at full health, in PA, just so it doesn't fail.
---
Thats lame
---
With the infinite loading screen you can do it forever!
---
Been PC gaming since the days of the 300 baud modem. No welcome needed.
---
Level 25 too
---
I feel a bit underwhelmed at only finding decent 3 star stuff I want to keep once every 20 levels... but geez.. I think  you've just got bad luck if you've really had nothing decent drop for you. Maybe it's your play style though. I find the best stuff wandering roads and not fast travelling. Also, if a server seems like it's dry or enemies are disappearing after getting killed I hop for a better one. I like to keep the bobblehead detection perk on because I find that if a server has a lot of bobbleheads at known spawns then it seems to have a lot of legendary spawns too.
---
Yes this omg
---
On the direct right of whitesprings on the map there is an erea (mine) with a lot of moleminers,kill them all and take the minersuite scrap of them,you can scrap it to b-titanium
---
This is genius and I'm making it my personal policy from now on. Wanna grief? Then I'm going to pacifist grief! Lol
---
&gt; who refuse to grasp how workshops and PVP work
---
Again OP is making a suggestion to CHANGE how it works.  You DO realize that there have ALREADY been changes to how PVP works in Adventure mode since the game launched right?
---
So to sit and continue to spout how it works now, and that it wont be changed, is just about as narrow minded as one can get.
---
There are a large number of people that do not like how Workshops currently work in Adventure mode.  Bethesda went as far to make an ENTIRELY separate PVP mode to try and resolve some of the issues people have with PvP in Adventure mode.
---
If you seriously think that further adjustments are completely out the window then you are the one in denial.
---
well people need to get rid of that mentality if they want to actually complete the event. It's not like the keycard is cheap or anything
---
good luck when you do
---
Join my world mate
---
Mines a tse. It used to have a drum before I switched it when I made it a non auto rifle. 
---
Its just so second nature for me to hit the reload button after every enemy. I didnt need that much ammo, and people who watch me play were raging because I was reloading with like 90% of the drum left.
---
yea they may think someone else will do it for them but in my experience we fail because everyone thinks that
---
Nice job editing ALL your posts to make yourself sound nicer, asshole.
---
No, TSE is +20% for TS and +25% for E per the Devs patch notes. That's 145% of normal damage 100% of the time.
---
Bloodied does more damage the lower your health, with a max 150% damage output. 
---
So a TSE is certainly not trash. I have a TSE Combat rifle, Bloodied Lever Action, and a TSE Lever Action. Both lever actions do nearly the same damage at optimized situations.
---
You can after the event though
---
Yes please, I've got a solo build and a team build. It takes me wayyyy to long to switch and then I have to double check and make sure I didn't forget anything.
---
A day and a half worth of vendoring is actually pretty cheap tbh.
---
True
---
When you’re the attention focus of the squatch, don’t forget to spam stimpacks. That’s more important than firing on it.
---
Placed my camp right outside the mire farm. 10 extra turrets helps.
---
Imposter squatch event needs to be about 50% of the current cost.
---
The location is the pond just east of Dabney Homestead (within sight), which has gravel, phosphate and junk! It's a sweet spot, since no one ever claims that workshop. The only problem is that when the workshop gets attacked by creatures, sometimes they ignore the workshop and run right up the hill to my camp!
---
Mire is easy. And short. The savage divide is too long
---
Literally no reason to not implement this as long as you give it the same restrictions as fast travel.
---
Should be a simple change and would greatly improve the game for pretty much everyone who plays it.
---
I really have no idea why Bethesda hasn't even commented on our repeated requests for this. You decided to let us be able to swap out our cards at will... why do we have to do this one by one? I have gotten fast at doing it, but it is still extremely sub-optimal.
---
The game let's you swap perk cards in combat, why not the mod?
---
2k caps and a nuke for a success is pretty cheap but to fail an event feels expensive to me
---
I found one that was tougher than anything else by far.  Melee - it took me about 10 times as many hits as a SBQ.  It was a Noxious, level in the 80's.
---
its just my point of view, never said yours was invalid. I wasn't trying to shit on you
---
So when you die, you still are activating the pylons until you officially bleed out right?  
---
It seems like a team of two could handle this pretty well.  One takes the brunt of it and dies, keeping the pylon active for 30 extra seconds.  The other revives them using quack surgeon or something to minimize cost.
---
Or am I overlooking something in that strategy?
---
I would quit the game if there was not a mod on PC for exactly this.
---
TSE is as about good as it gets. It WAS as good as it gets before it was nerfed.
---
They're so amazingly buggy to place, literally half the hours out into this was glitching the windmills.
---
The legs tend to get placed into the ground quite far, but once on the rug, you can't place them somewhere flat because the legs intersect.
---
Finally made a blueprint once I had it working!
---
Health wise is great it's damage isn't
---
I hate TSE rifles because i really like actually hitting what im aming at
---
Thank you, we certainly appreciate it!
---
That could work but I play solo and I don't know who's in a team when I join so most end up looking like chickens running around with their heads cut off expecting others to take the pylons while they just punch the air
---
So if you buy something and it's fake, you no longer earned the money to buy that thing because it was fake? Think about it. Ok, I didn't really earn it because it would be a lot more if there weren't so many of them due to supposed duping? I guess.
---
AA, endurance, swing speed (I believe it was) lead pipe.
---
Whatever it is, it’s always melee rolls.  Seems I can make atypical ranged weapons work, but not melee.
---
Those danm Brahmin die so easily though.  
---
Cool event, but this part is garbage, at least give us a way to heal them somehow.
---
I can’t fast travel I’m overencumbered
---
Lol yeah sure buddy, try another one..
---
Best was I'm an unarmed non-PA player. I normally wear a suit and carry a cane when not in combat. I found the guy in Wes-Tek and ran ahead of him killing Super Mutants in my underwear with a cane while screaming the whole time.
---
I had farmed out 2 legendaries before I realized he had left the server.
---
Yeah. It does to me as well. But its not world ending either imo
---
I’ll one shot whatever I want not my fault my build is stronger than yours
---
Hmmmmm will try to find another one then
---
When I ads its pretty accurate tbh. But vats Ime is horribly inaccurate
---
In wich platform do you play?
---
Xb1
---
You playing too much Fortnite if you want wall mounted cannons. \*In case you don't know new trap released less then 3 weeks ago is a trap that shoots 3 cannonballs.
---
Well I'm asking about stuff like pvp and end game content which I won't be able to gauge in an afternoon. I also have a friend who wants to buy a new game (between this and world war z). All of the reviews, and even old Reddit posts, on this are really biased and don't take content updates into account. 
---
I figured asking a group of people who are still playing it/have seen the changes will make sure that the person I'm playing with spends money on a game that isn't improving. 
---
Also, I'd rather just start playing with this friend instead of progressing to a higher level without them. 
---
There are plenty of other reasons I can state - like through posts on other games like this I've actually found some cool people to play with- but based on your response it doesn't seem like youd be genuinely interested in more reasons...
---
But the explosive does an additional 20% and bloodied does 150% max. Instigating does double if enemy is full health so that's only the first shot right?
---
So it would be Five shots Bloodied is 200 100 100 100 100 = 600 damage output. 
---
TSE would be 145 145 145 145 145 = 725 Damage output.
---
With furious I have no idea, but to imply TSE is useless...come on.
---
Well, I mean it seems like a flaw in the game. (not the mod) The most effective way to play a game shouldn't be opening the perk card menu in a firefight to swap cards—that's clunky and weird I feel.
---
WRONG
---
Do they not work on the bottom bed either?
---
You'll have to deal with a douchey camp placement on occasion, but it's better than having griefers show up and level your entire camp for no reason other than "lol i'm bored".
---
Still hard to read. When are we getting a plain text version in the game for people who cannot read those things?
---
Why not have players enter on opposite side for new revamped locations so new players can't go in but we can see it all spruced up and hopefully have personal rooms.
---
Can it play Crysis?
---
I’m kind of on the fence on this one. I can see it from both sides. I’ve lost a total of 6 pets, including 2 mega sloths. The tame/pacify system needs a re-work for sure. 
---
I don’t 100% blame the players that killed my Sloth, because the sloth is hostile to players that could just be casually walking by. Now if the player is a jerk and is seeking to grief your pet, fine, but we don’t know the difference. If the Sloth wasn’t hostile to random players, I think there would be a much less chance that he would be killed by them. 
---
Having said that, I’ve had the same camp base since I was Level 35. I’m now level 286 I think. My camp is in a low level area off a main thoroughfare, so I’m kind of asking for trouble by having a Mega Sloth in the first place. 
---
But my camp was built to be a “permanent” structure and I like it, and remodel it often but the basic structure is really immobile.
---
yes you just summed up my point in your last sentence. I don't feel comfortable trading for a cheated item, just like I wouldn't feel comfortable trading for a hacked pokemon in the pokemon games. Feels wrong.
---
I can run Snake at like 10 FPS. Makes things easier, honestly.
---
Trade completed. Thank you for the purchases!
---
Mag capacity is a little underwhelming. I got a quad combat rifle though and with perforating mag it holds 80 rounds and is awesome... but pretty much exactly as awesome as my AA handmade with drum. It's REALLY awesome though with a powerful auto rec, quick mag and VATS, because reduced VATS cost and really fast reload and 80 rounds. It's like a lawnmower for SB's. Also have a two shot (with 33% higher hit chance and 15% crit meter) and a furious combat rifle that I use regularly. I wish I'd get a ghoul slayers with extra limb damage though, I'd really like to try that combo out.
---
You have answer to your issue right in your own post...
---
In sure it will be a new back slot
---
I have texture streaming issues on PS4 Pro. Mostly limited to the time immediately after loading/fast travelling. 
---
Can also occur if I'm sprinting through areas.
---
I appreciate the feedback.
---
 So I'm not too keen on min/maxing, rather I get an idea for a playstyle (this one being a sneaky spec ops type commando) and I roll with it.
---
I get that I could commit more strongly to say pure stealth, pure vats etc, but I'm going for general survivability and versatility within the constraints of a "stealth Commando". I don't want to be a glass cannon for sure.
---
I agree that white knight could be sacked, and probably adamantium skeleton. The latter is mostly to help counter explosive effects from other players. Say I were to get rid of them, where would you suggest allocating those points?
---
Wow, ok. Please don't vote.
---
Thank you for the purchase. Enjoy!
---
What is voal dust?
---
Yes same here. Wonder why bethesda cant keep a fix for more than one patch.
---
The metagame is full of irrational bandwagon-chasing nonsense.
---
Actually- surprisingly enough, there IS a way to do that, but there’s a catch, and I’m not 100% sure how it works.
---
So when I was soloing the Forest version of the event, at the part where the Sheepsquatch spawned, the Brahmin scattered as they often do. At one point one of them was being attacked, and the Stingwing that was pursuing it ended up accidentally herding it back into its corral before I killed it.
---
Once the Brahmin got back into its corral- and I was still fighting Ol Sheepy- I noticed that its health bar slowly started to regenerate.
---
This leads me to believe that you CAN heal the Brahmin, but in order to do so, someone has to herd them back into their corral with the shepherds crook while everyone else distracts the various enemies.
---
Does anyone know how to bypass the security at Fort defiance
---
loooool Any excuse 
---
See you around
---
Hey I can help you out, but won’t be on for about 3 hours... if you still need help let me know.
---
Obviously with legendary effects they become so much better but by base stats, combat does more damage and weighs significantly less :o only benefit to Handmades I see is the drum mag
---
Some high level players can be absolute scum
---
FTFY
---
Most of us are pretty helpful don't knock all high levels
---
PC master race. I’m a bit jelly. I play on the 1980’s VCR known as Xbox One First Gen. FML.
---
The trick is using unyielding build with nerd rage and born survivor. If you have around 5 END and at least lvl 30 unyielding gear, you're practically unkillable. I heard medic pumps in PA are pretty good if you want to use a different perk card as well.
---
I have Luck of the Draw and Artisan equipped for experiment, I haven't repaired my heavy weapons for a reeeeally long time now and they are still above 100%
---
The only reason I don't is because i'm a bloody build and I normally have about 48 health - but we normally have one of my powered armored friends grab all the pylons and I provide them with stimpacks.
---
I killed two Scorchbeast Queeens today and got 6 :)
---
Excellent work
---
I can only speculate since I was just joining them. But here is how I think they were doing it.  
---
There were 6 of us about. The leader guy on the mic would instruct everyone to go to the nearest house facing the club house (by the tennis court). We would all wait there a minute and then they would respawn and we go run to the front door. We never had to actually go inside the door, all 25 (if I remember the correct number) would march out the door for us to kill. The leader with the mic said something like, "who wants to go next". This bit makes me think that they were friends listed and one guy exits and joins back up. I didn't have a mic to ask them the specifics. It was clear though that all of us had to be OUT of the club house and over by that house I speak of for them to respawn.
---
I wish we could somehow attach a perk card setup to our outfits. Like my Marine Wet suit activates my stealth build. My Excavator activates my Melee build. My spacesuit activates my energy build. My Bernie Sanders outfit activates Whitesprings robots to take over the map in a socialist militarized state.
---
see that's fine to me, you at least have someone who will take the pylons
---
Polygon is garbage and they don't even play the games they review here is some proof
---
Polygon TSE lmao https://imgur.com/a/KgW174P
---
kinda like the ability profile system in Mass Effect: Andromeda
---
Thanks for the offer. If I get the needed mats together, I may take you up on that.
---
In other words, you are keeping this trick to your self so that you can level faster than everyone else. This fits what I say is "selfish".
---
I really loved my little non-legendary combat rifle - it's how I shot down my first cargobot &lt;3
---
Are you on console?
---
That's super shitty. Some can indeed be scum. Most, however, I bet aren't (Level 110ish here). I hope you'll see that many are quite nice and helpful eventually. It sounds like you just are having a streak of bad luck, so I understand your trepidation.
---
5 pieces unyielding gear, serendipity, nerd rage, level 1 born survivor. Many people will radiate themselves down to about 40-50% health.
---
SBQ is a different story, those adds are just annoying, please kill them as fast as possible, my heavy gunner appreciates you.
---
It was a 110+ player.
---
Excavator or bust.
---
Lol, ok.
---
I saw this the other day and a high level just closed the doors
---
Purified water for 4 caps, nice try but I'm not your sucker.
---
Oh, wow, thanks for the link to that treasure map wiki, I'd have probably never bothered to look for that kind of thing on my own and god knows I can't be bothered to actually look at them and work them out. Just the nukashine riddle made me pause and reevaluate how much I actually want to continue with 76, if treasure maps had ever been a progression barrier... 😏
---
They're jot, but what they are is obscenely numbering my inventory at this point. I'm pretty sure I actually legit have at least one of all of them, and as many as 4 copies of several. Hmm. I may actually go start a topic about what to do with them besides just redeem them myself, by myself. That's boring.
---
Only thing I’d say is maximizing your damage means squeezing in 5/5 demo expert for your explosive weapon. Cut out some Gunsmith and Batteries included maybe?
---
That's what the unyielding (I think is what the legendary effect is called) build is for. +15 bonus endurance and every other stat when low health on top of other buffs like nerd rage. It's highly gear dependant but if you want to run around at 25% health it's the only way to go.
---
Awesome!  Still have no idea why bethesda hasn't made the map in game searchable for known locations.  I forget most of the time if I haven't been to an area in awhile.
---
Here's a post that starts off talking about how high levels help others.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bhqm0o/new_player_feeling_overwhelmed_and_in_over_my/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Don't be scared of us we like to help
---
Yeah I am with you - there's nothing for frustrating than failing because no pylons. Although we did have a bug the other day - where we couldn't activate one of them? Every single person on my team tried to take it and we couldn't? It made the sound like it was active and it wasn't so we ended up failing because it wouldn't activate :/
---
I did the mire at night for my first one and was unfamiliar with the  area. Lots of shit lying around tripping me up and blocking my shots. Plus mire dark.
---
Glad to put my services to use.
---
My comment still stands. But assholes can be all levels, from 1 to 250+.  It just takes a low level with some orbital strikes to do good damage. They can certainly get them at any level in one way or another.
---
My hoop serves as a roof access jump point. So it's very useful however I'd still love to play hoops, billiards even board/card games.
---
I am really sorry they trashed your camp instead of helping you but try not to generalize everyone! There are a ton of really helpful people out there - don't give up after one bad experience. If you need help it's a good idea to check here to see if someone on your platform can help - helps to look and see if they have good karma too\~
---
How does one acquire such a staff?
---
I can and will murderer all basic mobs, but legendary foes get one pop and a callout in area about it's location. After all, in the end everyone wants loot. I also note that the verbal callout not only gets people tog et their shot in, but seems to discourage "lol 1 shot" people from just nuking it. I've seen a few bloodied melee builds swap to a dinky pistol for their shot and then get on with their oneshotting.
---
I understand that the engine is stretched thin as it is, but they have already implemented player instancing into the open world so there might be some hope.
---
Maybe? I'd just let it do it's thing. I think the total game download size is 100-120gb. Not sure why it did it in 2 downloads??
---
I’m aware of that, not particularly a fan of their work but it seems like they reached out to some players for this write up. Hey... any positive light for FO76 is a good thing
---
My first megasloth was a level 60 and passive, and still was murdered.
---
&gt; they have already implemented player instancing
---
Since when? where?
---
Yeah guys don’t play the game
---
Just play it and find out. There's a dozen posts just like yours every day on this subreddit. What makes a good game is subjective. Just play it and find out.
---
I disagree on the orbital strikes and the dmg overall I have full assassins sentinel and all the perks that make me take next to no dmg. You have to really know what your doing and be built to kill me and I’m just lv 130😂
---
I can agree seems all this game has gotten is hate since launch
---
Sorry I fell asleep last night and didn’t see your message, sure man I’m down. Might not have the bullets you need but I’m sure I can find something you’d want to trade for it. I’m on now if you wanna PM me!
---
All players can be scum! I hate the fact that higher level players are seen so badly.
---
Would I of been allowed online without it being up to date though? It felt like the game just deleted itself and when I turned it back on it started reinstalling from the disc being instead? :/
---
Strange...
---
Anyone I've played with on ps4 always has the same challenges. So I though it was exactly the same for everyone. Today I have Swarm of Suiters with formal wear, lead champagne craft with formal wear, level up, take picture of MODUS, and take a picture of the bandit throne in the burrows.
---
My first char was a sniper, my second is a Big Weapons, and Bear Arms makes my carry capacity stupid (in a good way). As a sniper, more than three weapons would be back breaking, but I am literally storing all my junk big guns on my other guy because of hos light they are.
---
You rule! Username?
---
Thats not a bad idea either. They already use laser grids to block areas off.
---
And noone will. The amount of improved repair kits I get from SBQ is just ridiculous ;)
---
“macheagle” as mentioned above ;-)
---
Or alternately drop (by pressing R) while fat fingering through menus... I know I've guilty of this more than once :(
---
Maybe?  Everyone is sketched out about stuff.  Walked up to a shop with signs and everything and 5 people popped up with weapons hitting me
---
I’ll add you!
---
Hahaha. Use their tactic against them, I like it.
---
That is one cringey video "you didn't see it go through because I did it so fast" lol nah bro, we all saw it and you shouldn't quit your day job. If this was the case you'd see nothing but ammunition go missing.
---
Yeah possibly I carry a bunch of fusion cores cuz I always wear power armor. 30 most times. Do you what magazine lowers the rate I go through condition bar? I remember seeing one once. Maybe guns n bullets idk
---
I'm pretty sure you cannot play without being up to date. I will say it's very odd it's downloading twice? When I updated the last patch it took way longer than it should've. I wonder if it has to do with the last patch....
---
If you want to break free from the meta, you'll get more bang for your buck using a vats build. Let me break it down for you.
---
Concentrated fire for easy weak point targeting increases damage by an estimated 2x.
---
Using a silencer with covert operative and mister sandman perk increases damage by a confirmed 3.5x at night or 2.5x during day.
---
Stack an automatic tweaked receiver, eagle eyes mutation, blight soup, better criticals perk, and the critical legendary effect and suddenly your handmade deals an additional 150 damage during critical hits. That is damage which ignores all forms of damage reduction (looking at you sentinel/assassin's gear).
---
Don't get me wrong, if you want to call of duty it, stack as much damage bonus as you can. Just make sure you get stagger chance perks for the chance to actually kill those pesky sentinel set users.
---
I was just messing around at the whitesprings shooting cars and then took a photo right as this one exploded
---
If only they worked on enemies. Had a bunch of ghouls follow me to the 4th floor in that building lol.
---
I was expecting something other than a reskinned behemoth
---
I'd rather have character name displayed except on friends list. But either way, i support. Im in the same boat. Had i known, i would of chose better
---
Very nice!
---
Makes me a little nostalgic.  I used to live in Charleston in a tall old converted hotel downtown.  Weren't as many Super Mutants back then, but the place was ridden with colorful characters all the same.
---
That is amazing!
---
The cap stashes got reworked so that the caps are client side and alot of the random junk you can pick up in the world is client side. I know those are small things but and nothing compared to what im suggesting but it is there.
---
That is fun but I don’t really come across many bugs like this
---
I love it
---
That's not really instancing, though
---
If you do this don’t be shocked be getting griefed.
---
Glitch has been in since day 1, first time it happened I got so mad but yea its probably wont be fixed unless we push this post to the top.
---
If you put items in a regular container they’ll remain until the server shuts down or someone takes them
---
The photos with nuke explosions are great, also is that tricentennial paint?
---
The hero we didn't even know we needed.
---
Xb1?
---
Yuuuup.
---
I’m sorry I usually have my mic working haha! Not sure why it wasn’t even detected this time. Need to restart probably. Best of luck my friend!
---
Does not unfortunately
---
good old fashioned brotherly love. Make sure you go easy on him when you sockmace him in his sleep
---
Thanks so much dude, good luck in the Wasteland!
---
DPS on the handmade is higher though isn’t it?
---
The factor that isn't measured in a viewable stat, but can probably be demonstrated in a video, is the shootability of the platforms, by which I mean angle and amount of recoil. The combat rifle kicks more, and on a weird diagonal line.  (up and to the right)   
---
If you aren't using VATS, that makes it easier to get follow-up hits with the handmade.  find a shootable texture in game (a wall or tree) and compare where the follow-up shots go after first impact.   
---
That and generally more magazine options is usually why an otherwise similar handmade is better than the combat rifle. On the other hand, I usually have all the combat rifle mods pretty fast, whereas getting them for the Handmade is way more slog intensive due to item rarity for scrapping.
---
Make your way up to the 3rd floor and trip the breaker. You can actually see the power wire go through the opening in the 2nd floor. Follow that. However flipping the breaker is only the start. Reply if you want a spoiler but maybe you can knock it out before hand. I'm about to try it myself on my currrent play through (after I get tge camera)
---
The influx of griefers this week really makes me just want to take a break from the game. I keep on ending up on the save servers with people I had blocked previously to avoid griefing but I think the double xp weekend is calling them out of the woodwork.
---
Just saw a few of them, thank you for the heads up! I'm going to jump in this weekend and check it out!
---
PS4, but thanks)
---
Meh, I know what you’re saying friend, but I look upon TSE’s the same as the guys who drive million dollar sports cars. 
---
I don’t have one, don’t know anyone who owns one, would like to own one, but would probably get bored with one and sell it so I can buy a decent 4WD so I could go fishing in all kinds of cool remote places.
---
Nope, they have the same fire rate, combat does 6 more damage so combat has highest dps.
---
I just want 10 friends who can fast travel to me at any given moment and retaliate and we just office space a guy back to his home on griefland whore island.
---
Idk why high level players have a bad reputation since most, like already stated try and help the lower levels all the time. I’d have to disagree from my own opinion with 500 plus hours in game and level 180 + I’m constantly getting level 50s and under trying to bait me into PVP esp when I’m at vendors or just crossing paths. Or even better when trying to move stuff from main to alt and I’m in my alt’s lil cabin with doors locked and a level 30 opens it and try’s to steal the bags on the floor and initiate pvp and to go on and shot walls etc.. yes,  it’s a lot easier to kill the lower level players but instances like this make higher levels want to not help. Just my two cents and in game situations that I have.
---
Good point.
---
Just checked my support history. Yeah it said "Your request has been validated and you’re approved to receive your new canvas bag once it has been manufactured. Please allow 4-6 months for manufacturing and delivery."
---
That was on December 11th for me though so it's like JUST been 4 months since then.
---
Then on January 19th I got this update, "Once the canvas bag replacements are manufactured and ready for distribution, you will receive another confirmation email."
---
Not interested in just googling this week's codes?
---
I believe each collector only has a 5 max capacity, so you have to keep retrieving to actually get your max production out of them.
---
Is that a thing?  Again this is my first time doing this.
---
most multipart quests start from square one if you leave the server.
---
Oh yeah, definitely a thing. Tells you each silo's code.
---
It is. I don't know if I am allowed to actually advertise the site that I use on here, but it is definitely a thing. Look into it! It'll save you a ton of time!
---
I got a double capacity handmade. Never reload.
---
I’m probably lower level than you
---
I’m still new and have been doing everything by myself. Luckily I’ve stocked up on stims &amp; ammo so even if the battle takes long i get it done lol. Would love some company. I’m level 22
---
Add me if you’d like
---
gt: v0rdul
---
Version 1.14 yeah? Thats the one installing the now. Once it finally downloads i'll try the game again and after some time of playing turn off the console then back on to see if it uninstalls again.
---
You CAN change your account name, by contacting customer support.   
---
(they had me submit a few choices).   
---
In my case, it was because I had used what is essentially my IRL name/email as my bethesda account name.  Turnaround was actually pretty quick. I'd love to have both names, since the lack of NPC interaction makes our "character names" essentially useless except as a Vault-Tec ID screenshot...
---
As a Hoosier native, where basketball hoops are present at almost every house, just having it outside makes it feel a bit more at home. I'd love to play a game of pig though.
---
Honestly I doubt I'm going to start this event again unless I get a team from here that knows what they're doing.
---
That's a really weird bug
---
Could always just message me the site😂
---
I recently found a AAE combat rifle (at a vendor) and used it for awhile and it's nice. I do have a TSE handmade that I swear by but the combat seems a little more smooth in action along with the increase ammo capability. But, my handmade vs combat, I choose the handmade for stopping power.
---
Is that o a zero?
---
I usually check about every 30 min. Depending on how bad I need the resource that I’m extracting. If I’m hurting bad for it. I’ll take a workshop and check both about every 30 min between doing events and such. If it’s an ore extractor, those tend to fill more quickly than other deposits. Junk deposits seem to give the most and randomized. Junk extractors I’ll check about every 45 min.
---
It depends on who you are with. Many times I see 7+ heavy gunners (I am a bloody melee unarmed) without one gun army and she rarely lands. So there are thousands of rounds sprayed/wasted while she is in flight.  In the good ol' days everyone was a shotgunner and at least one person was running enforcer.  Crippling/staggering to keep her on the ground would make the fight 75% faster in my experience. This ultimately means less ammo expenditure for you.
---
Gun condition is helped by gunsmith, I think.
---
Shot a rotor out. It slows it down, keep picking off the rotors until all four are blown. It’ll lower and stay in place. Shotgun them. Saves ammo and makes it easier instead of chasing. I used the mini gun to knock out the rotors
---
Its kinda different, depending on the gatherer. Lead gets over 15 before it caps.
---
I agree, but this is one of those requests I see literally every day on this sub.  That's not necessary.
---
It's the main quest to give you scorched immunity. It still shows I need to get the blood but I can't.
---
Literally all I did was ask for help and instead get my camp destroyed.  Why players like that don’t just go play survival I don’t understand.
---
I just want wall mounted laser turrets like the ones outside the relay towers.
---
I would definitely add in escape artist so you can disappear
---
Thank you for the items and all the info.
---
Check the other related reddit posts. Someone found that Bethesda are now aware of the problem
---
Added.
---
I got lucky, someone nuked it so there were loads of people down there..
---
In most games you can use this excuse. But not this one. Random items get highlighted when you sell or scrap things sometimes. There’s no fix for it, but sometimes it gets really bad and can be set back to normal by closing and opening the menu.
---
Dissappear? Wait until you start seeing the dead ghouls reanimate and walk through the collision into the walls.
---
First time it happened I was sneaking around and just saw it from the corner of my eye... It was unsettling to say the least but very... immersive I guess? :P
---
ah right the one you have to press g or something (on pc) on the corpse to get the blood. no idea. never heard of it not working of you crash in the middle of it. can you sill get the ghoul and mole rat blood? (i think those were the other 2)
---
Just like the challenges that haven’t worked since release, adding this feature would work against their business goals. I agree with you and I expect both are very low on their priority lists, if at all.
---
I'd really love a detailed map like this of resources you can plop your camp on to collect. The only one I have is grainy and low rez and uses hard to distinguish color dots
---
You don’t need to fast travel back or go find another suit. Vendor lists aren’t updated until you close and open the menu. You could’ve bought all those hazmats back.
---
Wow I had no idea, thanks for this info! Will they accept wanting to change it simply because I'd like to or will I need a valid reason?
---
Curious if an orbital strike or grenade would do anything to them. Would be one way to possibly clear mobs off them if/when things get hairy and dead moo moos is a probability.
---
It might not be that their adverse to it, they probably just don't know.
---
It does for scrapping.
---
Again.... How were you not aware that you were a unwittingly beta tester?
---
Did you and your 7 friends play the beta and think "This will all be fixed next week?"
---
The buggy state of the game was an absolute surprise to no one who took part in the beta. So how did you not think it was going to be a process of bug elimination and testing?
---
They fucked up the last patch. It’s on pc as well, and there’s quite a few people getting crashes on top.
---
Dude, youd probably end up spending 10k plus.
---
Of all the game crashing bugs there are, I'm glad these one's have never gotten fixed, and hope they never will.
---
Yeah you need to press a button to "search" or whatever to get it. The option won't pop up again even though I don't have the sample anymore. 
---
Yes I have gathered the other samples just fine.
---
I've heard that breakdance is making a comeback :P
---
You can cripple death claws?!?!? How did I not know this? Guessing with VATS?
---
Problem was I had no idea where or when I sold it. So yeah.
---
what?
---
wrong.  i know for a fact, acid collectors max is 10.
---
Perk loadout manager is started with 3 slots, and it wasn't enough. Now it has 12 slots, but i think 8-9 is a good number
---
The moment when the batteries die on you.
---
A good perk for a medic build get the quack surgeon perk in charisma I believe it means you use alcohol to revive others.
---
Sadly there is no healing syringe mod for the syringer but using endangerol gives the enemy a 25% damage resist decrease for 2 minutes.
---
well they need to pay attention to the quest step when getting in the event
---
I’ve seen that glitch as well it’s quite unsettling. Another one is a radrat that is dead and has its tail moving while part of its body is glitched through the storage area where you can find food items at in The Burrows.
---
Oh, that's good to know, thank you.
---
need specific answers please.  not opinions.  thanx.
---
OP can I ask what hardware you are running? You're clips are perfectly smooth without any trace of hitching at all. I consistently get 90+ frames but my game is a hitchy, jerking mess most of the time. Also, sorry for your bad luck.
---
Calling BS. I've never seen a pet above level 30. I want this to be true so I can tame one but any proof?
---
In no way was that player right for doing that , yes that’s Def not cool and I agree completely they should go to survival but this is the game , but like stated it’s players of all levels bud, I make two trips a day to drop off all my ammo and known recipes and plans and stims and purified water at Flatwoods lol. And while I Don’t answer random team invites I do send back a message asking if I could help with something... I just don’t like ppl knowing where my camp is, well I’m on Xbox and level 180 and if you ever need a hand my gt is cjpisi
---
Die hard
---
Fucking genious
---
Pharma Farma also helps a ton. I've never crafted regular stimpaks and I'm swimming in dilutes. I'm not a healer build but I easily go through 60-80 stimpacks in a couple of hours just because I don't bother to manage them anymore and use them as much as someone reloads their gun.
---
No there isn't.
---
Oh you mean posted here? Where there is a disproportionate number of players airing complaints?
---
This sub doesn't represent the player base accurately.....
---
But when players have issues where do you think they are going to go? To Reddit. So the number of complaints and issues posted in this sub are almost definitely not an accurate representation.
---
People take to the internet to complain. Not to praise. No one writes businesses thank you letters, but plenty of people write angry letters.
---
short of needing to go back and get a syringe or something (if it gave you an item at the start) I dont have a clue.
---
Does it have a marker on the map for the wolf? If I remember rightly, you could use any wolf, but better to try everything.
---
Really well done, thank you for sharing!
---
Probably because nobody cares.
---
Dude, I know it sounds nuts, but it was real. I wish I'd taken a picture or something. I honestly was naive enough to think he wasn't going to die.
---
Yeah I just made some tweaks to the build, added escape artist. Not sure how I forgot that! Thanks for the reminder
---
Curiosity killed the... rat? :P
---
OMG I love this!!! Lmao
---
"I come to make things bleeeed not to reeeed"
---
I like it.... I may adopt this...
---
Can confirm, picked this up today, on the barrel in the church in Harper’s.
---
Oof I’ve had to backtrack before, looking for something I really didn’t want to lose. Not fun.
---
lol
---
I’m 69 and still finding new places! I purposely held of on certain areas to search down the road so I can keep the game fresh and new for as long as possible. I’ve barely tapped into the bottom left of the map.
---
k
---
Okay, there are several things wrong with your calculations.
---
Bloodied does +1% dmg for every 1% HP lost, so max +99%.
---
Why is your Bloodied doing 100% dmg after the first shot? It should always be doing 199%, or maybe 175% since you realistically won't be at 1% HP, and most Bloodied users usually sit around 25%.
---
And why are you giving TS Explosive but not the rest? For this comparison, let's leave Explosive out of it to keep it simple, because it'll just add +20% dmg in the end to all of them anyway.
---
So let's compare:  
---
Bloodied: 175% dmg every shot  
---
TS: 125% dmg every shot  
---
Furious: maxes out at +30%, so technically higher than TS but I actually agree that TS is still better because it's more consistent.  
---
Instigating: +100% first shot only, so better than TS until the 5th shot, when TS passes it.
---
AA: +19% dmg every shot, so worse than TS until a better receiver is modded on, long explanation why. Ask me if you want me to go in-depth as to why.
---
Keep in mind that this also isn't considering the fact that VATS TS is completely useless and TS breaks faster, but that's up to everyone how much they value that.
---
I use my .45 on my lever. Way more efficient use of ammo. When I want to throw a bunch of lead down range I use the handmade. If I were to use combat and lever I would always be low on .45. Using .45 and 5.56 allows me no almost never craft ammo.
---
T51 All day. Not the greatest for radiation protection but has the best ballistic and energy
---
Found the plan for marine chest today, on the barrel, in the church, in Harper’s. It’s labelled pocketed, but you learn deep pocketed.
---
Only problem I ever have is the one rogue cow likes to travel up the mountain before the farm lol. But other then that sexy quest ;)
---
BE hehe ;)

Cause nobody uses just an E. If it's explosive and someone is using it, it pretty always is two shot or something similar if it applies right like a quad explosive Double Barrel. Literally nobody uses just an explosive weapon unless it's all they have.
---
I found one outside Watoga - no idea they were already live in the game! Engaged it, back-pedalled, fell down a hole in the bog and died to a self inflicted TSE shot to the face.
---
Yea I don’t bother with team invites either.
---
Good idea! I will go that route too
---
I made a post about this in here the other day and it was Raider flair attractant. Apparently Bethesda has screwed with Survival and they'd rather harass the holy hell out of everyone in Adventure than stay over there. Frankly, I hope the devs focus on fixing that and just kill PvP in Adventure entirely. 
---
Raider flair kids get really super offended when you suggest that, though, and suggest back that you should quit the game because it isn't for you. Charming group of players.
---
I’ve seen different answers. I’m no expert but maybe people think it has a better dps, so that why they ravage about it? My subjective feeling having used both is that it does. I can’t back that up though. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a7b4i4/non_legendary_combat_rifle_vs_handmade_rifle/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
Ahhh Fisto! makes his appearance in Appalachia!
---
You know what...  That's a good question.
---
No, the highest end and most expensive legendaries are BE, FE, and AAE. I rarely see people using TSEs anymore unless they're completely clueless about nerfs.
---
It's also impossible to have just Explosive... obviously you're going to see a prefix perk added onto it.
---
This! This vendor bot has the Plans for combat shotgun!
---
Do what i do; load into a server and spam every single person that isn't already on a team with requests. About 1 out of 6-8 on average will accept.
---
Because everyone ignores the endurance tree. 
---
I made an unarmed tank to see how it is. I can tank two pylons and the Sheepsquanch reliably. It certainly makes the event go wicked fast. Everyone else I see just crumples after one hit.
---
My main deal is simplifying the perk cards. Make the passive cards, say like ammosmith, just a passive trait that works instead of having to interchange them out. Just annoys me really
---
I don't think it gives you an item like that and I've tried killing the wolves in the marked spot and any wolf I can find. I guess I am just screwed.
---
I'll do what I damn well please.
---
There are still some of us left :)
---
The TSE butchery knocked me down a peg but my AAE still gets the job done.
---
Regular ammo though, fuck crafting ultracite shells for a 0.065% chance of getting something decent to drop.
---
The regular shells that the Mole miners craft for me cripple just fine.
---
People are bored, theres nothing to do in the game anymore. Ive been lvl 120 since less than a month after launch. Even griefing  got boring months ago. I just dont play anymore. I have yet to touch the game this year and i dont plan on it for a while. Frankly if people turned off pacifist and engaged in pvp the community wouldnt be dying off but nobody wants to do that. I expect the game will be dead by next year
---
They redid the vendors recently! Most vendors have set plans now and you only have to hop for the rarest of plans. Lemme see if I can find an updated link for you my guy
---
Do you get the plushie by killing the sheep squatch
---
Mothman shrine at point pleasant. West side of map.
---
I try to get someone with a ranged weapon and marsupial to activate all three then run and jump on top of the cabin so the Sheepsquatch is always vulnerable. Do people always listen? No. But I try, lmfao. We all usually waste our time because people are clueless.
---
I use T-60 with calibrated shocks and an X01 jet pack torso and helmet. The T60 is way cheaper to repair if you're using it a lot and the cal shocks are way easier to find or make.
---
Noobs.
---
Fuckin’ a right. I need a way to swap out perk cards on the fly.
---
Didn't realize that this was a problem for some people. I usually just pass them up.
---
Have you tried Fraternity Row for them? Pretty sure they were all over the place there.
---
You're barely scratching the surface of what mutations and perks can do. Bloodied builds aren't for being resilient, they're for putting out max damage. You can hit well over 2k melee damage easily.
---
Also, as a Bloodied build, I'll say you're definitely not unkillable. The only way to come close is with Sentinel's/Cavalier's.
---
This would be the second biggest for me.
---
I mostly perk'd into 2h melee, and I play with friends most of the time.
---
I cannot hit an enemy first or I am the only one of  the four of us that will get xp.  So either I wait and finish the mobs off or we all pull out weak ass weapons so that we can all tag.  Its a really lame experience, but otherwise Ill hog all the xp and playing together gets lame.  It was even worse when my buddy had the exploding shotgun when it was OP.
---
Please make group xp shared.... check for proximity if ya must.

All kinds of rads at Emmett Mountain Disposal Site and a rad shower if needed

That's way too high HP. If you don't go low enough HP to reach +3 SPECIAL, you aren't maximizing Unyielding. And why use Nerd Rage at that HP?
---
This. We can name our characters, but those names don't show up; just our games tags. I don't want all my guys to be named BOOBOOINYOMOUTH, I want to have their individual names shown.
---
This, there is only 5% dicks, the rest are helpful, has nothing to do with their level.
---
It increases all but END. With the right perks and mutations, you can hit easily over 2k melee damage.
---
I got tired of using handmades because its kinda overused. I try to different weapons but damn its hard to find something even similar to a handmade in accuracy or damage besides a Fixer
---
I can confirm that combat does slightly more damage per bullet and has the same fire rate as the handmade :/
---
It shouldn't in general. You don't go into a fire fight as an explosives expert, and suddenly change to a sniper halfway through. The only real solution is to allow presets for different combat situation, like I put on glowsight and a couple others for Nuke Zones, carry weight and accuracy for general PvE, and a different loadout entirely for pvp
---
Yeah i know. That took a few retakes and wondered wether or not i should post it. Lol
---
TS is definitely not the best prefix effect anymore.
---
Sell it
---
Huh that's stupid.
---
Its what happens when you shoot a voal (mutated vole) with an energy weapon
---
I think the handmade just looks cooler. The combat rifle looks like a less cool BAR. I like the combat rifle for semi auto fire though.
---
Does Ansel have a different holotape?
---
even at 10 endurance I feel like my health gets shredded, that's even with the Grounded mutation and power armor boosting my energy resistance
---
so far I've killed 6, all 1 star guns, no armor though.
---
Server hop over and over and over to Modus for the mod. That's how I got two.
---
I hope they just make the WS no build zone bigger, I don't see why it doesn't start at the gate/fence, it always seemed like an oversight to me.
---
That's what i think it is, combat rifle is slightly better but the handmade looks cool af.
---
I usually grab one or two and try to jump up there and plink away but with no stimpaks I can't do that for now
---
The effects are multiplicative, so it's 1.2(1.25) = 150% dmg for TSE, not 145%.
---
You're way off about Bloodied as well. It caps off at +99% at 1% HP, not +50%. So it's 199% dmg.
---
On top of that, why are you comparing TSE to Bloodied without Explosive? That isn't fair, you should be comparing TSE and BE. As mentioned, TSE is 150% while BE would be 240%. This also isn't considering the fact that TS VATS is useless and TS breaks easier.
---
It's a pretty big gap.
---
I go around dropping cool 1* legendaries like instigating lovers and bloodied handmade rifles for folks just about to hit 45. Or cool explosive lvl 25 or 35 weapons for folks around that.  I'm such an asshole. Takes all the fun away from them.  Just remember that for every one who tears you down there's at least one who would like to build you up.
---
Yeah only one here but a buddy of mine got a 3-star medic lever action from one so i was excited
---
Team build would be easier if shared perks worked on all non hostile players in a certain range.
---
Why are you getting downvoted?
---
Yep, sound of the hit, sneak attack notification but no damage.

Is it possible to steal some dross from Camden for this purpose?

we have npc's we don't have human npc's and personally I don't believe we need them - lets face it 95% of npc's are just place holders we don't need raiders and other human pc's cause we have super mutants / scorched / mole miners filling that gap really any humanoid npc can fill in that whole niche we can keep human players as the only humans in games while adding in detailed npc's 
---
Take rose and grahm both are interesting both are npc's they don't detract from being non human they wouldn't be better if they were - I mean simply put we don't need some mass exodus of human npc's roaming about when we have so many things to choose from - why not a group of intelligent ghouls? we already know they exists in game and we know peaceful super mutants do why not use those? Or some half scorched that have yet to fully turn I mean there is so many places to take the story without throwing vanilla all over it with basic humans
---
Agree. I want to like the Combat Rifle more but even though the stats are very close the Handmade is, IMO, much more shootable. AP usage in VATS also seem to favor the Handmade. 
---
Now give us an R91 Infiltrator and I’d be in nirvana
---
Uh, what? They're right.
---
Bloodied is +1% dmg for every 1% HP lost, so it caps at +99% damage. TS is only +25% dmg.
---
Add on the fact that TS VATS is useless and TS breaks easier, and it's a big gap.
---
Yeah you don't even need a Bloodied build to see that BE &gt; TSE. Any HP below 75% makes Bloodied &gt; TS.
---
I joined while playing STO to hold me over til something better came. Use imgur or similar
---
Here's my build, It's very open so you could apply a lot of other guns into it (IE I run commando, heavy gunner medic, bloodied shotgun, sneak crits, PA melee, you name it.) It's main strength is sneak crits tho. I love using vanguard's armor when I do assault and sneak. I use X-01 PA for heavy gunner (I mix around some perks in Intelligence) and melee (Radicool takes it to another level!) 
---
My favorite for the sneak crits is an instigating lever action/hunting rifle. They fuck shit up like nothing! The fixer is insane too.

What is, this END? That was done to prevent HP from rising at low health, making it OP, since END affects HP.

Lol the camera has been out for like 3 days. If we found it that quick, why didn't they?

No. I would want too

It would turn itself off and on. The gear says "except endurance" right on it.

I find quite a few at Red Rocket Megastop. There are Nuka Cola machines all over and they are usually stocked. Also the one by the pool at Whitesprings always seems to be well stocked, and then additional ones are usually in the locked closet in the snack shack right next to it.
---
If you don't mind sharing .. how?
---
They much have changed the stats at some point. Im pretty sure that Handmade was better at launch as it was in fallout 4. Even wiki shows handmade as the better one. Confused.. Have to do some crafting see for myself tomorrow.
---
Use em both, depending upon ammo and condition situation. Heck, I keep an auto pipe rifle in the rotation for when I accumulate a thousand rounds of .38
---
This.
---
Or go to Welsh train station, along the cliffside between the station and town there are a lot of black titanium, also a lot of moleminers.
---
Bet he ate it too.
---
Want to do the trade later tonight? I don’t have any plasma cores rn but i have 102 5mm rounds
---
That's still stupid, then why not use AAE or FE?
---
And Bloodied builds aren't that weak... A BE weapon does 240% dmg while TSE does 150%.
---
I think there should be a cooldown, 15 minutes or maybe even an hour.
---
I kind of wish there was a way to place radioactive barrels at your CAMP, for when you need to get your Rads back. :)

Note on stupid mutants, caps. Maybe not constantly but I always end up lining my pocket a bit with stupid mutant money. Boards also for wood if needed.
---
Your probably safer on that rollercoaster there than you are irl
---
Or just shoot the limb enough.
---
Try a shotgun with the enforcer perks, 1-2 shots per limb and they are stuck, absolutely wrecks limbs, also works on SB, they land and just look at you like they're thinking "what the fuck did I ever do to you".

---
its already showing.
---
I like how you call them stupid mutants, also I forgot they dropped caps. Whoops
---
what's your setup that you're getting that? Looking at crafting a new combat rifle vs new handmade rifle on the workbench, I see 65 for the handmade rifle and 58 for the combat rifle. Do the guns you're comparing have the exact same mods (and legendaries?).
---
I also see 33 fire rate for the combat rifle and 40 for the handmade. 
---
I'm gonna need a source for your info.
---
Move points from strength to perception and agility. Then later be prepared to shift some luck to starched genes and class freak. Once you have marsupial and speed demon.....games becomes mire enjoyable.
---
Once your auto rifles do enough damage, you will have more confidence to reduce the iron clad and fireproof towards more perception agility luck. Especially after you obtain better armor, which you can mod to improve fireproofing and stealth.
---
He's got something mixed up. New handmade vs new combat rifle at the workbench, handmade does 65 damage with a fire rate of 40. Combat rifle does 58 damage with a fire rate of 33.
---
\^ It takes into account that it's shooting twice. So, if base damage is 20, it'll show 40 on the stats. :)
---
Well dang. Good to know. I've always done it wrong. Thanks for explaining.
---
Having them survive probably doesn't affect the quality of the drops, but it definitely affects the quantity.  Just like with Fasnacht the worse your performance there's a chance to lose drops, I've had runs where we lost two brahmin and didn't end up getting any weapon or mod plans, just the mutton recipe which I'm guessing is rewarded by default.
---
I have to admit, even with Enforcer 3, I don't ever seem to instantly cripple the limbs like I can with everything else in the game.
---
If you're talking about the new sheepsquatch event I go in there and I one shot the sheepsquatch purposely because any time I've sat there and tried to use guns and wait for other people to get shots in on them the cows end up dying because the people aren't very good so I run up and I one shot the two or three of them I don't care if you get loot eye care if I complete the mission what good would it do me to wait for you to shoot it so that you get loot on it if we're going to fail the mission and I'm going to lose out on loot
---
I’d say multiply by two because I recently got a two shot black powder pistol and I know the base damage of a black powder pistol is high. The damage for the TS was 165 but I have a regular black powder pistol with a slightly lower base damage of 160 so I’d say you multiply it
---
They were handing out 2500 atoms as compensation to those who bought the game before the Black Friday sales, provided you submitted a complaint to them. Probably a little late to try and claim that now though?
---
You're missing something alright. Those can't possibly have the same mods. Newly crafted basic model handmade vs combat rifle at the workbench for me:
---
Handmade:
---
Dmg-65
---
RoF-40
---
Weight-11.2
---
Combat Rifle:
---
Dmg-58
---
RoF-33
---
Weight-9.8
---
The only category it wins in on my screen is weight 1.5lbs less.
---
Mmm. Come on. The first pet I had I took a ton of pictures of. I'm not as naive as you're pretending to be.
---
When I do West Tek runs, I stockpile their weapons to vendor. Excluding sledge hammer Mini gun and missile launchers. Too heavy.
---
But those are thing that they did change from server side to client side, and that is what they would have to do to load you into a different interior. The server says this door goes to this room and if they change it on the client side you would load into an alternate room that is only accessible after meeting certain criteria. Destiny is a prime example of how it could work.
---
How much you looking to maje would be the question. I use 5.56, shell, and .45
---
If you still need up send me a message Ill be glad to
---
I’m think it gives a 25% boost to base damage at least that’s what I remember it saying when they nerfed it
---
Not so much anymore. They removed mission recipes from the SBQ loot pool, so there no way to get them other than Modus at this point. Last time I saw one for sale on the market it was 16k, which is only 1.5k less than the vendor.
---
I saw a guy get banned for duping once and the mod said "see ya later duper mutant" :)
---
Cool down would be fine, but if I didn’t have to mess with the perk menu for different types of crafting, crafting wouldn’t take 15 minutes.
---
I have never seen one either. But now i have the marsupial mutation which is awesome
---
Yea.. Exactly the same differences as in wiki
---
Physics are working as intended.
---
Lol I did!!! Most things I googled brought me to Reddit, y'all are great.
---
Did I offend a fanboi?  Oh no!
---
On pc and ign?
---
I've begun experiencing significantly more griefers on xbox ever since update with adventure/ survival mode.
---
I've been having this problem with vats melee, I usually don't use vats for melee but during the sheepsquatch event I've been hitting it to quickly zoom around the wolf and bloodbug spawns and I'd be literally in somethings face spamming and not a single hit would connect so I'd just exit vats and punch them myself.
---
No. It’s considered a dick move by people but it’s not against any rules.
---
I either stockpile or scrap my weapons. If they’re bad legendaries (For example an assassins cultist blade at level 10 with 21 damage) I’d sell that but if it was a normal hunting rifle I’d scrap it for the mods. I’m sad because I hardly find combat rifles and I want the mods but buying them puts me off.
---
I received a temp ban for it, yeah.
---
That’s crafty and really cool
---
no but excessive harassment can be
---
they are made to be destriyed and can be rebuilt very easily 
---
if that's what gives you kicks then go for it
---
the thing i find funny is that as a level 34 melee/no PA character, i will always rush to get pylons if i have the stimpaks/healing to spare. i'll activate one and then just go into sneak and try to stay out of los of all the adds. if someone else gets the pylons then i'll try to get a few measly hits in just so i can get the xp and rewards from the corpse. my big thing is that i'm at least trying to HELP everyone else do the damn event
---
For group healing nothing can compare to a medic’s shotgun on a vats crit build. Add in the team medic perk card for emergency heals and then you can choose any other perks you desire. In a pinch you can get by with just the team medic perk card but that requires you to farm/buy stimpaks. Additionally, the last time I tested it the medic legendary effect has slightly higher range than the team medic perk card effect.
---
Idk, I had a great time in it last night thanks to the leader board. 
---
My teammate and I were taking over workshops and we noticed the top 2 guys suddenly fasttraveled nearby our latest capture (Red Rocket Mega Stop). We crushed them like 6 times which left us in the top spot- and suddenly when the Defend Workshop quests started, a few more came at us to join the fray. 
---
It was a solid 40 minutes of fun pvp thanks to people seeing who was doing the killing and migrating there.
---
So using a two shot mirv fatman is frowned upon? Rubbish I say lol jk burn the witches and their level 250 cool guy xp exploits with the duplicated stuffs.
---
Primarily here to say: **thank you!**
---
I've had many situations where a Legendary gets blasted before I have even a chance to tag it, so I've lost out on its loot. Just yesterday it happened on the even with the Sheepsquatch. Thankfully, there were 2, so I managed to at least get a legendary off the second. Also thankfully, they were just 1 star, so not high chance (in my experience) of getting higher than a 1 star item.
---
What I ***really*** hate though, is when I've sufficiently tagged something, like a Scorchbeast or a Legendary... and *still* don't get to loot it, likely due to my connection's latency :\\ 
---
Back when we could encounter legendary bots in Watoga, I would always check the map to see if anyone was nearby (as usually we've gone the quest and don't have to sneak), and then wave them over... even if they had no clue what was going on. Just the good-human thing to do :D
---
Can confirm. Spent over 7hrs server hopping for a new deathclaw. I've given up now, there's just nothing convenient about the taming/pet system.
---
&gt;When youre on a team you share loot whether you tag the enemy or not. 
---
Not always. That works. Then they break it. Then it works again. Then it breaks again. It's not guaranteed unless you get a tag in. I've been on a team numerous times and couldn't loot anything from a body a teammate killed right beside me that I didn't shoot at.
---
Yea IGN Spectre197
---
Thanks all, I wasn’t sure if the second shot did the full damage of the first bullet, but it sounds like it does a percentage and is accounted for in the damage
---
I don't blame you for the doubt. I just don't think about it. I couldn't convince any of my buddies to play, so nobody would have known why i was so excited about a stupid sloth.
---
Yea, gotta have that endurance up and some stimpaks. You can do it that way with the person not dying. It's very useful lol.
---
This is what I’ve settled on at present.

---
I’ve made some quality-of-life sacrifices and a little bit of health in order to maximize stealth and damage. 
---
With some decent level 50 armor my rating is something like this.
---
380DAM/450ENG/55RAD
---
I work mostly in VATS and a semi automatic rifle. So this is more of a medium range designated rifleman build with a very strong reliance on stealth. Not trying to be an in-your-face knife wielder, not trying to stay at extreme range like a sniper.
---
The biggest weakness of this build is having to go into Nuke zones in a hazmat suit since I don’t use power armor. Getting swarmed by glowing ones can put you in a pickle really fast. But if you keep a minimum safe distance in order to work it works very well for me. 
---
I should also point out that I have the following mutations: speed demon, eagle eyes, bird bones, marsupial. 
---
With armor mods my carry weight is around 220 which as long as you’re not hoarding much seems to work just fine. My base load out with weapon, armor, and a knife is 128 pounds
---
I think all the cards in this building took me until level 60 to put together as a plan. Once I hit level 80 I had enough swaps that I was able to really make an improvement on quality-of-life with things like repairs crafting and cooking.
---
This is by far the most fun build I’ve had in the game. I feel like I get to experience a little bit of everything rather than just sniping from a distance or Hulk smashing everything point-blank
---
The mod is relatively cheap from the enclave vendor. But it’s incredibly rare. You may server hop for weeks before you find one.  Players who found it will probably charge 4-10k depending on platform.
---
Harassment would be following someone around calling them slurs if some type
---
Name? I'll be on in 5-10 minutes
---
I'm interested in the ** Fire Ax and Grognak axe. What sorts of things are you looking for?
---
Price?
---
Good point! I didn't think of that and it is very important to go back and empty the machines otherwise you are wasting time when they are full.
---
Yea. I run level 5 gunsmith. I think it makes a huge difference in durability duration
---
I think that might have changed in the past month or so, because that also used to be my go-to spot, but within the past couple of weeks I've server hopped for 7hrs and a deathclaw hasn't spawned there.
---
I haven’t harassed them over the mic at all. Only destroying the base. Did you get banned for ONLY destroying the base?
---
Oh feck, the fixer does more base damage than the normal combat rifle...
---
Glad you had a good time!
---
I have a lot all the the mutation but it will be nice to have a jetpack for my X-01 but its so rare its like 1% out something
---
if I don't have much in the way of healing I'll grab a pylon then camp out in the building shooting out of the door or window every so often to try to deal with the bots and get my reward at the end
---
Well honestly I don't have any AAE or FE heavy guns, despite ffarming legendaries a ridiculous amount of time.  But I do have Bloodied.  Bloodied means running around low on health and I don't have a full set of Bolstering 3 star armor.  And I like to wear Power Armor for the heavy gun specific perks.
---
I got two of them, instead of one. Perhaps I received yours?
---
It's the same lol get outa here
---
I'm not sure what's reasonable so make an offer
---
Yeah it's really rare. Always when i visit the bunker i check what mods they sell. Maybe i'll find it some day.
---
ign same as reddit.
---
Yes. But then found other subs and now mostly gta stuff
---
The TSE lever breaks quick, I carry it and a bloodied lever on me and only use the TSE for harder enemies.  It was shock for me too, but it can’t be a main weapon.
---
Okay good to know. I haven’t said anything in game chat so I think I’m good. 
---
She’s getting all her friends to mass report us too which seems like abuse of the report system
---
Is it just that explosive is harsher on weapon condition?
---
Anything that doesn't fit the build. Like an anti armor war drum and a bloodied one.
---
So where'd you tame this unicorn?
---
400 caps
---
Ok sure 
---
tommy_n1ghtmare
---
You're a griefer. Not my style but if you're bored you're bored.
---
You're being a jerk, but that's not considered harassment. Harassment would be, for example, following this user across servers and destroying her CAMP every time she rebuilt it.  It would also be hurling slurs while you destroy it.
---
I was, very sorry, I was comparing using the fixer, which does more damage than the normal combat rifle.
---
I wish you luck
---
Yup. I was doing the Grafton Steel workshop, clearing out the muties and id say 10% of the time my hits didnt do damage. It was extremely frustrating.
---
My camp is at White Springs, too, but situated on the green, near the little bridge with the yellow bike parked on it. Nowhere near a single ghoul, no turrets and every amenity open for players to use, including an unlocked industrial water purifier. I've only had a couple of people attack my camp. If you're not one of those annoying players that sets up behind the club house, most folks will leave your stuff alone.
---
(I just like having a home someplace pretty.)
---
Does not work. Own on both ps4 and pc and the stuff you buy in the atom shop is separate too.
---
This has been suggested about a billion times but it's still not in the game so upvoting.
---
Why should we even bother having to switch between perks? Why not just make some of them passive? That just makes total sense, since most perks behave exactly like passives anyways, 
---
For example happy camper, home defense, hard bargain etc. Only work in specific situations anyway.
---
I should never have to switch on happy camper if I could just always have it on passively so it can activate automatically at camps.
---
Love your expression!
---
I use gunsmith 5 and always put on the forceful stock ( I think... the one that vastly improves durability). The stock with 200% durability and perks means I don’t repair for hours
---
I have a pc account and a PSN fallout account, no you can’t swap characters between systems. If I could I’d be on my PC char who still has an awesome PVP base
---
Thanks but i don't actually need it i'm just gonna sell it
---
Because some players just have to be dicks... I see it all the time in the event "Uranium fever" many times I am the only one doing it and then a lvl 200+ shows up with 2 minutes left and they know I am there or there might be a few of us there and they will one shot the legendary without giving any of us a chance to tag it first. DICK MOVE! These are the punks I would love to have in front of me in real life so they can learn a real lesson about life...
---
Ye it's similar to the robots in the fasnacht parade. Don't bee line for the big boss get a few shots in but check for small mobs around
---
Anyone know how to stop the blue lightening effects after then event?
---
At the top right part of the map. I actually just found a level 20 there. The first time made me think it was the norm to find them that high and passive.
---
Well, anything below 75% HP Bloodied is better than TS, and anything below 50% HP Bloodied is better than TSE, so you don't have to go super low. There's also the fact that you can get BE for an even bigger bonus.
---
There's also the market subs where you can find 1* Bloodied super cheap.
---
And why would you depend on Bolstering armor, let alone *3 star*? Those 2 extra effects will do nothing in the way of DR, so that's unnecessary. The perks and mutations are what makes Bloodied builds great.
---
Thanks. Been trying to find the body forever
---
People go where the rewards are, if you incentivise trolling people will troll. 
---
If they increased the rewards of... say... owning a workshop, people would just claim the workshop as intended. Reduce the amount of caps gained from adventure mode pvp (maybe even to 0, go to survival if you want to pvp) and make owning a workshop better (more resource generation, better defense rewards etc...)
---
Also, same restrictions as Fast Travel sounds good.  No combat switching.  The hunger/thirst restriction seems irrelevant though in this case.
---
That looks surprisingly much like my first PC I had... oh, man how long ago was it... 30 years ago maybe? It was clunky, big and heavy, but it could run Wasteland and Civilization, and well... those are still my fav games (Wasteland evolving into Fallout that is).
---
How many?
---
I think it is the two shot, but the lever is extra effected.   My TSE pump doesn’t break that fast.  Other two shot(non explosive)weapons break faster then their regular versions.
---
Do you play ps4, xbox1, or pc?
---
Interesting, thanks for the info
---
Don't buy one of these fad gaming chairs. They are straight trash. Go to a real office store, a steelcase or herman miller dealer and see what they have. Especially if you are playing for hours at a time. Depending on your budget you will have some nice options.
---
Last thing I could think of at all is rather than just relogging to hop servers completely close the game out.
---
Yes.
---
1
---
Make an offer
---
Lllloooooooooooosssserrrr!
---
Well, she is in their right to report you, so do their friends if they see what you did as an offense. It's up to the devs to decide what to do, if it ever comes to that.
---
trEAT your ghoul right!
---
Kind of plain, but I agree the free states could use a paint job, maybe a more current digital camo (experimental camo)
---
Many thanks for the confirmation!  I really would like to see it fixed, or at least a comment on the topic.  Is this a licensing issue for purchased Atoms and the Xbox/Playstation Stores?  I'd like to hear from the community managers if possible.  /u/Ladydevann /u/Valseek
---
Rename it “not for sale” lol
---
If anything, having other players that were not part of the situation "mass" report you is harassment and against ToS. 
---
Destroying camps is part of the game, BGS made it that way. Playing the game the way it was intended is not bannable
---
Take over a workshop with a vertibot pad and kill it over and over. It costs 6 aluminum and 8 steel for each bot that yielded 700+ xp per kill.
---
I'll admit, a Fog Crawler does hit like a truck and gallops surprisingly fast.  Perhaps its defining feature is that it continues to attack you with headbutt even when you've crippled the rest of it. 
---
But that extra HP is what the Sheepsquach needed.  It has ample time to use its variety of attacks against the player.  You can fell a Deathclaw or Fog Crawler with a hit or two in melee.  A Sheepsquach will only take a fraction of damage from the same setup, which gives it times to counterattack and make you resort to more of a hit-and-run strategy.
---
Xbox? Damn, I could have helped you repair that puppy to 200% and slapped a mod or two on it.
---
You're probably aware but the full excavator gives you 100 extra carry weight and improves mining yield. Just you into a pack mule.
---
Transylvania? As an old lady who played actual board games for literal decades prior to the internet, you seem overly upset and sensitive over how other people want to play this game, which was sold as co-op or solo.
---
And if you're one of the handful of people to attack my camp, you do realize that it's literally a one button push to rebuild everything, right? Like, a bit of wood (I normally have over 300 stashed), some copper (always have over 150 stashed), etc. It cracks me up when players attack my camp because it's such a useless effort on your part.
---
This is why I don’t buy or sell anything I do need to let go of my inner dragon and stop hoarding so much ammo
---
Oh my God I didn't know you could repair that thing. Thanks ❤️❤️
---
There is already an easy programming solution for that though, just don't have bonus endurance count towards your percent of health or only have the bonus endurance apply modularly when you drop low enough the bonus would bring you to the right percentage.
---
What a waste of time lol
---
A friend of mine had an issue where no melee attacks would connect at all. He had to delete his Fallout 76 ini settings and it helped. I have no idea what caused it, but in game, he could be standing pixel to pixel with an enemy and he'd still miss at point blank.
---
Thx 
---
Ballistic is an understatement. Nuclear is the word. I was selling a 3* quad AR for 400caps. The buyer joins and seen my TSE and BE Gatling guns. I had to say they are not for sale 3 times then they left without buying what they came to buy. Like wtf.
---
Other players don't see what you name items
---
Many thanks for weighing in.  I really would prefer to be able to carry my progress with me, especially since I'm a (filthy) casual.  That said, my filthy-casualness is largely due to me playing around with the C.A.M.P. building instead of grinding for gear, but to me it's still progress.
---
I really don't mind paying twice or three times for the game if I feel like hopping from one console to another.  I don't think I'd be OK with my atomic shop unlocks not carrying over though, especially since they're part of the look of my camp/gear.  It would be even more of an impact if I had paid cash for the atoms.
---
My case was fairly simple, not sure what the "standard" is for allowing the change. I just submitted a ticket, they replied asking for a few choices, gave me the simplest one and that was it.
---
Sweet! Looks like I may be switching to a vats build instead of this. I appreciate it guys so much!!
---
Anytime
---
Did you check your inventory it o to gives you plans and sometimes it doesn’t show you what you get from doing quests
---
It would be a welcome qol change. I also had a kid go crazy on me when i didn't want to sell the outfit i was wearing and my equipped weapon
---
&gt;Combat and passive perk trees, vs perk load-outs (paraphrasing).
---
I think it could be cool to have both! And like you say, as long as everyone has this ability, I don't see a problem. It'd add an extra dimension of strategy to combat.
---
Now on top of it all, if we could just nerf pvp invulnerability, and make camps invulnerable in pacifist mode.... I might personally give each dev a hug.
---
Yes to this^^
---
It just came out yesterday.  Players have to get used to what's going on.  New events can be overwhelming.
---
Yes please times 1000.  Cmon Bethesda, Fallout fans were NEVER looking for pvp.
---
It's not that it's difficult, but it's extra work, whereas I have 20K fusion cells just sitting around. It's something I have to go out of my way to do, whereas I just have extra ammo for the tesla rifle laying there. It's not difficult, just inefficient.
---
I did it a few times before realizing I needed the Shepard's Crook with me and equip for the actual herding, some people might not know that part yet. Not defending the cows just means they suck. And only want rewards for doing nothing, but that happens with almost every event as it is. Not much you can do about it unfortunately.
---
And just like that, all your credibility vanished.
---
I know but even it's AOE did nothing to me and i was out of PA. Do the spines have poison because if so i couldn't even notice it. Believe i love everything about it since the moment it was theorized to appear when the map released i was hyped and they have so far delivered i just want it  to hit like a truck.
---
better have some repair kits on hand.
---
haha...coff..sorry..
---
Rad rat lol. I sit at 19% HP and face tank the queen. If you run a proper bloodied build, you don't die. #1 myth about bloodied is that it's dangerous or difficult to play.
---
I was pleased to see the haters write a positive article
---
Same thing happened to me it’s just a glitch, can you spawn at vault still? Cause after words it’s fine
---
Stop carrying valuable junk and get better armor, dude.
---
Yeah, TSE shotguns basically melt like paper if you're not careful/have max repair. At least in my experience, I eventually gave mine away because I was tired of it breaking mid battle.
---
Idk maybe I’m just observant but literally as soon as the event started I looked at the destroyed robot and found out what to do. After having never done it. Yeah that is true
---
Power armor, 19% HP at all times with rads taking up 81% of your bar, Emergency Protocols. You get all the DR of power armor plus an additional 50% on top of that, and nerd rage. You sit between 10-19% HP and occasionally use a diluted stim, but things die so fast it's not very often.
---
The biggest gripe amongst all my friends for sure
---
Or just not have it increase Endurance, which is fine. It makes sense really. You should get a bonus to max health but only when low health?
---
I mean tbh it’s a fairly simple event. Loot the robot to find out what to do. Even though I feel like there should be a quest marker pointing to it.
---
Excavator armor is the best I have.
---
Let’s say pc has a sale on atoms, and Xbox and ps4 do not, they’d be separate but even know it would be a good idea it just lets people keep paying for they’re game so they can make it better
---
True. But for 2k, I can get new plans, 4000 rounds of ammo, or 10 1* wooden armor pieces (not just 1 from the event)
---
Or, I can get another white fedora.
---
I’ve been checking for this every server since the BETA and got the jetpack once but never calibrated shocks. :(
---
Yeah I can respawn at 76. Thanks for the reply.
---
what are the stats for it?
---
Nah, you are a dick, not harassing people. Now if you were yelling slurs and shit, that's harassment. 
---
I'm kidding about the dick thing. I just don't like griefers. I'm sure you are a good person in real life. 😉
---
Thank You. Tried Uranium Fever for the 1st time with a couple of friends and this lvl 190 just ran around an killed everything, didn't get hardly any shots in and none of the legendaries dropped for me because of that  When I'm in public events, I get a shot in an wait for others to help kill everything, especially when legendaries are in the picture.
---
It also can be stopped by restarting the game or leaving said server, but can be a hell of a big problem during an even when the boss is low health and you can’t loot them because you had to go through 2 loading screens instead of one
---
Yesssssss! Switching out individual perk cards is so Damn tedious and time consuming ive lost my patience with it.
---
Okay, yeah, BS. That's where I find all my pets. I've never once seen anything tameable over 30 there. I thought maybe you used a spot in the bog I wasn't aware of.
---
do we know if it has stats?
---
Since beta as well, but I’ve gotten 3 shocks, 2 jet packs, and I think 3 stealthboys. But my camp is 1 Cap from whitesprings, I stop in every time I load into a server.
---
Me and my fiance would be willing to help! Psn is Primoridalpear,we are hopping on now :)
---
Saw a scorched doing the helicopter in a shopping cart too.
---
Primordialpear*
---
any idea where i can find plans for serrated combat knife mod?
---
It's not a bug, it's a feature!
---
I'll try it out when I get on. My buddy has the rescipe.
---
I swear. Like I said, don't blame your doubt.
---
i swear i spend most of my time swapping perk cards. it’s really cumbersome. it’s to the point that i’ll just walk by lockpick opportunities.
---
I tested against another player and watched health loss. I went from 11 damage a hit (furious automatic pipe rifle) to 18 by shot 10. A bit more than 50% health damage, but because more true damage equals more armor piercing, I’m assuming it’s about 50% true damage increases.
---
I would guess it's the two shot modifier that speeds the breakdown.
---
My question would be, how reliably can you stay in stealth on the SBQ? Without stealth, .50 Cal will out dps anything with ease over time, and I destroy everything extremely fast with a .50 cal.
---
Whats your name on it
---
Well, Gunsmith 5 should exactly double durability, as it halves durability loss. Luck of the Draw is roughly +10% per point durability boost after that, so Gunsmith 5 is better than Gunsmith 4 + LotD 1.
---
For a lever I'd recommend the precise stock. Big condition buff and decent hipfire accuracy. Also don't use your best gun against the weaker stuff.
---
50 shots for 200% condition sounds crazy low though. I don't use TSEs so they might be a lot worse for whatever reason. Possibly condition loss per projectile.
---
Sevi2010
---
Pick modes that add durability. The stock is a huge way to boost the max durability.
---
i usually burn through about 20-30 stims each time i go to that event, some times i will hold 2 pylons, then its mad hopping and running while spamming stims and watching health so i dont die.. for some odd reason i enjoy that.. sorry for your bad experiences with that but fights ive been in especially last week or so of it seems people are fighting over the pylons. one goes free i see three or four others running for it as i go for it.   
---
only once i avoided pylons because my character i was on at the time had like 2 stims on her as it was 3rd run that day, last night i was on a lvl 25 and managed to grab a pylon with about 60 seconds left in the fight and we got the kill at about the 8 second mark.   
---
if ya on ps4 come join me ive only hit about 3 or 4 losses in all the events ive been involved in so luck and people i run with have given us alot more wins than losses. also, i see ya said out of stims, if needed i can help there as well got a mule with about 300 of em on it. got a couple friends that run bloodied builds so they usually dont use stims and will pass em off to me since i usually end up hittin them with a stim when they get knocked down.   
---
biggest issue we have seen with the event is the imposters body vanishing within a second or two of death and no one getting a chance to loot her, my buddy has missed three that ive witnessed vanishing on him.
---
I wish theyd just up the special points to 76 instead of 50. This would allow us to keep those cards like green thumb, hacker, lock pick, slotted instead of having to constantly switch out. Even if it was one extra point every 5 levels past 50, every 10 levels past 100 and no hidden benefits to strength or perception etc. Just simply to use a few more cards.
---
No. And all these people saying it is okay she reported you are dead wrong. You did nothing wrong.
---
I've tried everything. I'm just stuck.
---
Good call! Thanks!
---
This is awesome!
---
Dude, no. They have no right or reason to report him for playing the game. Base destruction is allowed, some perks even support it.
---
There's one of those at my CAMP fast travel point just about every time I jump there. I try to pick it up everytime too
---
Did you follow them across servers?
---
The reason why you can only respawn at Vault 76 is because the game believes you are over-encumbered. The problem is that when you die, the carry bonus associated with increased Strength, like with Radicool or Unyielding armor, stops applying, so you end up in this weird state.
---
Like I said, they have the right to report him if they want. That's why the feature is there. After that, if it ever reaches the devs, they will make a decision.
---
I just did it at Poseidon and only got 244 exp for the kill. Am I doing something wrong?
---
I've waited for this comment!
---
Scouts life 10 gives "-30% item condition loss" (and for some reason shows a sideways awesome tales 6 as its model)
---
I guess I've been lucky in that so far I haven't run into anyone who wants to grief me. For the most part players either ignore me or throw me a "Hello" emote. I've yet to be attacked, but I think that's because it takes the most evil kind of person to pick on a little level seven scrub who's obviously just starting their adventure.
---
Build in the Tocic Valley. I had a CAMP on an acid extraction point just south-west of the golf club that had silly amounts of radiation barrels
---
Yeah but End only gives you 5 hp each. So max Unyielding it's 15 END x 5 hp equals 75 hp if you apply it as a flat bonus. If you apply it by percentage and just have it give you 25% of the hp 15 END would give you it's 18.75 extra health, hardly over powered For sacrificing 75% of your health.
---
Let's assume the worst and you only have a 1 in END which would give you the least returns that's 255 hp you would need to be at 63.75 hp for Unyielding to activate, which means you're sacrificing 191.25 hp for any stat buffs no matter how many pieces of the effect you have and it's only when you have all five pieces that it would mitigate that by 18.75 extra hp, you'd still be down 172.5 hp. 
---
And all that math isn't even accounting for rounding the numbers up or down or the bigger sacrifices for diminishing returns a 15 endurance build would have.
---
Looking at the ESM, what's most likely is that each projectile deals 62.5% of the base damage. Hard to prove though.
---
Damage is great. But, if your gun is breaking after a fee shots. There's no point in running that mod. The longer your gun is available the more DPS you will do. I also tend to have a backup non-TSE as well.
---
I kinda feel like perk builds should only be allowed to be changed upon leveling up or something similar, just to make card choices/etc more important.
---
I love interesting stories like these. Thank you for sharing.
---
Don't be an ass. A VAST majority of people who play this game probably don't follow every little bit of released information the second its dropped
---
Want in. GT?
---
EnasTheos
---
The corn soup made me spit coffee haha
---
I had a guy wreck my camp because I wouldn’t sell him a map
---
A MAP
---
WTF
---
Everyone is going to threaten to report you for harrasment or threaten to hack you. Never believe them unless it happens, most people will not even file a report.
---
Yes, this 1000 times over. Having to swap out cards and scroll way over to find them again gets old.
---
I'll buy your 15 cores. People sell em for like 25-30 a piece recently.
---
No, there are hundreds, if not thousands of people that know how this works but not one of them wants to get banned from Beth for "exploiting" nor do they want it nerfed, like the XP did on glowing ghouls. I know because I've played the game from the beginning and I actually talk to people and interact with them in game same as everyone else who knows this...I'll happily tell someone IN GAME, how to do it. 
---
You're pretty damn judgemental for someone who doesn't know me a bit!
---
Even if not, 3 stars at level 40 are not inherently terrible. My level 40 TSE shotgun is still much better than the level 50 alternatives I have found, and that's before perks and whatnot. Strikes me as a good place to farm for goodies for the future vendor or if you're not worried about min/max.
---
Base reflects the perks you have equipped. Except adrenaline, which stacks on kill.
---
Tbh anything cause it’s useless to me, I’m just trying to make anything tbh. How much you willing to spend?
---
I wouldnt sell a guy shotgun shells after he spawned in causing ghouls to spawn and kill me which he grabbed my junk bag since I was camp building. He then destroyed all my important stuff for a 50 cap bounty. Can't wait for pacifist camp to work.
---
And another question - how good is Concentrated Fire? For the queen fight, I'd assume I'll want Glow sight, but I could drop a few points of the various riflemen perks in favor of it if it's worth it.
---
I don't agree with them doing that, I'm just explaining why they did it.
---
I’m surprised Bethesda allows mods like this on PC. Seems like it puts people who have this mod at a distinct advantage over those who don’t. Strange
---
And now there is a mode *just for you,* where not only is buggering other people socially acceptable, it's *expected*. So have fun, miscreant! The door the apocalyptic roleplaying is the the right at the entrance :)
---
Sure my guy. I’m not gonna be on till much later though cause of work. Unless you wanna do it tomorrow in the morning
---
Molotovs work too, I believe. They don’t send bodies flying, but it helps to tag them all easier.
---
yeah, SBQ is a bit different since some adds can actually one shot players with very big dps on queen (bloody build for example who run very low hp)
---
I feel it's the only case, for now, where it's a good idea to kill mobs them asap
---
Maybe he wanted someone to help him lose his bounty. albeit 260 is high.
---
I deliberately set up above the cows with a Ex Scatter Gatling Plasma and just shoot down into the cattle after I tag the boss to nuke the adds. That or toss an Orbital Strike grenade, the radius is enough to kill most of the bugs.
---
It's a false report and waste of time, honestly.
---
I found the Lemonade vendor the last time I did scorched earth. It spawns near Watoga and sells the lemonade plan.  If you walk directly out of the Watoga train station from next to the merchant robot walk straight out past the train and look for a small lemonade stand with balloons attached to it. There's a little military outpost not too far from it and there is also a farm filled with mirelurks further out. Good luck.
---
is adds new for mobs?
---
Probably a waste of time, yes.
---
I tried this for 10 mins after downloading and setting up 3 perk loadouts and holy crap it's like playing a different game. All the micromanaging I had to do when I wanted to switch from unarmed to heavy weapons or when I had to equip lockpicking,scrapper,weapon artisan,super duper,etc is gone.
---
No more 1+ minutes changing cards and making sure that everything is correctly in place, no more scrolling to all those useless cards you get from the perk card packs that you will never use. This should be added into the base game asap so console users can also spend more time enjoying the game instead of staring at the perk card menu.
---
lol all g, I'm sure I've been guilty of worse
---
You just need to find a quadruple ammo pipe pistol, equip an auto receiver and drum mag, and just never stop firing.
---

It's coal dust when a guy who is half blind and has nerve damage in his hands tries to type and isn't paying close attention.

Hmm, thanks for the info.
---
Omw
---
I wasn't being an ass. I just made a comment assholes.
---
Now I am being an ass.
---
Asshole.
---
Just kinda seems like the work of someone stressed out/over-worked rather than someone just doing a sloppy job.
---
I was running up to a 1 star ghoul to kill it and some guy with a (supposedly) bloodied explosive shotgun one shot it as i was running up to it. He ended up following me around killing everything i was trying to kill. Why dont people like this go play survival if they want to be peens?
---
Ironically, you are terrible at it when you put in effort. Stick to that winning natural personality.
---
If you still help I'm down PSN Skizzunky
---
It would be nice to have an option to hide items. That way people couldn't bother you about it
---
Whatever asshat
---
yeah average "fast" down for SBQ is around 5 mn, which is good enough: everyone around can tag her.
---
On a side note, I don't put TSE and Bloody weapon on the same stage:
---
A TSE weapon is just strong by itself, where a bloody weapon requires far more work on the build  and the risk is high because one hit can kill you : you basically fight with 50 hp max to be effective (but you are very effective ;) )
---
Technically you never did need junk and could have completed the game without it anyway (just discard broken gear and use what is at hand, I had a friend who did complete the entire campaign that way).
---
Something being possible under the extremely specific cirsumstances you give isn't the same as it "you never needing to collect or risk losing junk, ever" since "you" is indicating anyone reading without regard for their playstyle or goals in the game (such as this doesn't change any need for junk used in your camp etc).
---
You seem to believe I disagree with your assessment, when I only disagree with your presentation of it as universal.
---
Thanks I have super duper maxed and just bought my first recipe. Looking to save up again to get another one which is why I created this post. Ill see what it sells for at the vendors.
---
'This will be fixed next week?' I didn't know Fallout was released a week ago, news to me. Thanks bud!  
---
You're bending words to try to make your claims plausible, and that's obvious.
---
The game is still in beta state, if you fail to see that, you probably are pickle smooching Todd Howard too much.
---
what
---
If you still need it I've got it PSN Skizzunky
---
whitespring is not exactly a public event per say.
---
Same man
---
Was any actual money involved?   
---
If yes, you're an idiot, dont do that   
---
If no, it's a game, just keep playing and shut up.
---
You think people would catch onto this, but Bethesda never says a damn thing if they have no intent to do something, and they've never responded to this issue (even though someone's already made a plug-in that does this for you)
---
It's probably not profitable in some crazy psychological way or some tit on the top thinks this affects gameplay negatively.
---
If people pay the 2k caps to activate it...
---
Honey *Haus,* you uncultured degenarate!
---
If I have time I go through west tek when I log in. My camp isn’t very far from there. I found a second cap stash inside.  Just need to remember to equips cap collector before I go.
---
Lol who’s role playing I just get off on fucking people up and taking their shit
---
Follow the quest line. It will eventually lead you where you need to be. If you haven't done it yet, don't read on the internet, try to uncover yourself, IMO.
---
Devil's advocate: low players only aren't scum because they don't have the resources to be a pain in the ass
---
When scorched a pet's level raises, but this is tempory and it reverts when you server hop/log off! He'll still be scorched but the level boost will be gone.
---
ok then just askin for help man relax
---
Really!!?? Did not know that thanx man
---
Is that the item I can buy from a vendor?
---
About 11pm est
---
It's a permanent event, you can buy a card at vendors for about 2000 caps. (I forget what it's called exactly but it's under miscellaneous.) Then use that to make an assaultron recall keycard at a tinker's bench. Then go to the terminal at pylon ambush site and select the bottom option. If it says aborted you need to hop worlds, each world's terminal resets 3 hours after being used.
---
I play strictly in pvp...it has to be done or one gets no benifit.
---
Another question if I may what are good places to farm other then the golf course? I’m currently helping a new guy and doubt he wants to take it slow like I did
---
plus why would you tell me this now unless its you who stole the item i dont see why you would care man
---
Haha thanks, I love the questing. Feel lost without it!
---
There's a mod for that. I use it, check Nexus.
---
Bloodied swing speed cane with 90% reduced weight.
---
I did almost all of it myself and I really enjoyed it, I just didn’t know what to do once I got to the pylon sight. I’m good now though, thanks.
---
Yep. Give the owner maybe 2 minutes to get back and defend it. If not you lose the workshop. I also agree that you should have to be in the worshop zone to contest. None of that team bs.
---
I’m on my way
---
They specifically said that they are working on truly instanced dungeons for the summer with the vault raids. Once they get those instanced internal cells working perfectly, I could see this as a natural future step in that direction. Even potentially opening the doors (literally and figuratively) for making vault 76 into an instanced sanctuary player hub once you have completed the initial vault experience, returning to the vault takes you to the hub instead.

Don't worry about her loot, it was a 1\* nocturnal wood leg anyways.

If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Sounds good :)
---
How much?
---
Station vendors , I see it a lot at Sutton station. Check all the forest area vendors
---
Yeah more than likely, always offered him the 1* leather what ever dropped for me.
---
Try farming the treasure maps. I was able to get a hatchet mod that way
---
Exact location?
---

---

---
Favorited items should just not be displayed in scrapping, vendoring, or trading lists at all. A user should need to manually unfavorite an item before it can be scrapped, vendored, traded, or dropped.
---
Nice
---
I gave up waiting for the angry mob to figure it out, now I just pick up all the pylons I can get and sit on the roof with a cryolator sniping the imposter. Gives the crowd what they want, a vulnerable target who moves in slow motion, only need 3 or 4 stims because it drops so fast.
---
How much would you be willing to sell it for?
---
FIXED FINALLY !!!!
---
Idk man make an offer
---
Started yet?
---
Is 800 caps enough?
---
No... I’ve spent the last 30 minutes getting a frickin keycard out of a tree...... but I got it!
---
Message me with your GT when you launch, I'll come help
---
I upvoted you because I agree overall with what you're saying.
---
However. 
---
There is nothing at all challenging about the Burrows. I never think about teaming up to take them on. Its just ghouls. A suit of excavator armor, the worst PA there is, and you're basically invincible.
---
No, but anything renamed for sure should not show in the sale list even with its default name
---
Alright
---
Its not a hack its the games bullshit pvp hitreg. Teamamte and I tried to mag dump our TSE weapons at someone only to get one hit in return
---
I would like in GT BigBangTheory73
---
K, GT EnasTheos
---
I did and to trade on fo76
---
Well, that and they literally said it would be very challenging, designed for a team of 2+, and only the most well geared *might* be able to solo it.
---
I’m the next 28 days or so either that or they’re doing one per new patch, just have to wait. I think War is next though
