How  lol? I'm agreeing  with all of the true criticism. I never insulted anyone but like I said if the shoe fits. You can stop posting on the 76 reddit if you despise the game. 
---
---
---
I'm talking future though, hopefully it'll be balanced, if not oh well, it's like call of duty hardcore with the one shots
---
It's the Pied Piper easter egg lol
---
THAT'S where the Ultracite set came from!  I had no idea.  In another quest or somesuch, I did get a set of Raider power armor that I know I didn't pick up unless someone else had dropped it in a box and I just grabbed it near the Glassed Cavern.  So suddenly I have two additional sets of PA.
---

---
It got weirder.  As I was checking out this armor at my base, the server disconnected me.  When I logged back in, it was in the PA frame, AND still in my inventory.  So now I have two sets of rather broken-down Ultracite PA.  I'd love to use it, and I fixed the legs, torso, and helmet of one set at very dear cost, but I need to use the Excavator because I have something like 60lb of phantom weight at all times. 
---
(Some weird things were going on with that server in general.  When I shifted my CAMP to improve my mountaintop spawn, it doubled all my stored base components.  Do particular servers do things like this?  I'm really confused by both events.) 
---
You need to put on your veil and go through the secret door. When you first walk in through the front door, go left and you’ll find the door in the next room. 
---
It boils down too two options. Either never trade with anyone, ever, in an online game with no NPC's. I say never because even when it's completely fixed the duped items will still be around. Or just buy the stuff you want from other players and live your life
---
Go outside the manor to the street. You will see three nuclear Polawski shelter pods. Enter one. It will transport you down to the secret base and you will find it. 
---
Or you can go inside the manor and play the piano on the first floor in the living room. It will open a secret cupboard that will lead u down stairs which u can access the secret base. 
---
I find the first option easier. 
---
Wear the mask you found and go to the front lobby of the mansion. If you enter from the front door turn left and go near the foldable wall. 
---
I didn't think of that. Could be though 
---
That would have definitely been better.
---
Cool thanks for the help
---
M E G A T O N
---
Huh, I may have to install eso again. The pvp back when it first came out was horrid as well.
---
I'd fine if your ability to lockpick/hack would be tied to the level of the stats like you said.
---
5 Perception/int = lvl 1 lockpick/hacking
---
10 = lvl2
---
15 = lv3
---
Whatt there's a stimpak plan?
---
I'm a little curious on how fast the Overseer is moving compared to the rest of us.

Where is death law island and how am I just nw hearing about it after nearly 100 lvls

Helen. A rough and tough in-your-face kind of gal. She was raised poorly and was always sort of a brat. She was ten when it happened, pouring herself a bowl of Sugar Bombs. She ran in, strolled out, and picked up a double barrel and headed into town. She fought a giant winged rat and countless numbers of ghouls. Helen died 52 long years later, by an unfortunate encounter with raiders. Her old frail self couldn’t hold up after all the fist fights and rad storms over the years. Her story doesn’t end. She still lives on in the commonwealth where a man who lost his wife and son is rebuilding the world with only his bare hands. He leads an army of people who share the same story Helen did. Her backstory continues in the commonwealth where this man fell in love with the double barrel and found had the name Helen engraved on the stock. This shotgun has survived over 200 years of wear and tear, being repaired and restored over the years. 
---
Then go somewhere else you unbelievable douche!
---
Yeah something like that, just seems redundant to have to move perks around all the time.
---
The story she told my friend and me was Goldilocks! We listened to the whole thing, and then she just collapsed and died.
---
Think about it
---
Not a bad idea. I crafted a few level 15 handmades the other day and gave them to low levels with 300 rounds
---
Until they randomly stop liking you, especially those foul mouthed eyebots that always want to start shit.
---
I have 1 strength and wear normal around and 
---
My 3 Star ski sword get me out of trouble whenever I’m detected and surrounded by glowing ones or charred ghouls
---
I don't use melee but for the rifle, you could get marsupial and just jump then shoot the ground. Inside a building, if you gun bash it staggers the enemy long enough that you can back up and shoot 
---
I agree. But I want the sprint button to cancel reload action as well. I hate that I can't run away because I'm too busy reloading.
---
If you really need that int for crafting you could always boost yourself: mentats, x-cell, modded underarmor for 1-2 int
---
Its a small island west of the dirt track workshop. Very nearby it actually.
---
You can get power armor literally 5 minutes into Fallout 4.
---
So did you expect power armor to be exclusive for high level players only in F76? 
---
LOL

A portion of water weigths 0.75 lbs(a 20lbs dumbell weights 20 ingame units=&gt; the game uses lbs)/0.34kg. You are supposed to drink 2-3 liters a day=&gt; ca 6-9 portions. 
---
The time scale in the game is 20:1 (if I'm not mistaken)=&gt; 1 hour and 12 minutes=1 ingame day=&gt;3-4 portions of water per 1/2 real hour would be normal under normal conditions *but* you ingame are constantly running(base movement is running),sprinting, you are fighting, your immune system is working harder then ever and you probably carry 150-250 lbs of equipment with you etc. (Your char is also active for 24 hours of a ingame day)=&gt; you probably sweat *a lot*(and use tons of calories)=&gt; you need to drink (and eat) noticably more

I went to 76 yesterday and a bunch of recipes and plans saw the first low level I could find and just gave them to them. I found doing good will greetings to new people makes me feel good and I get to pawn off stuff I no longer need.

Huh, where do you get the blue prints?

oh, really? pretty much every gun gets an accuracy boost with a sight, even the minigun. i wonder if thats actually broken or not

You can make a mansion.

Nope, i just finished playing today with my buddies, no server problems

Pretty sure those golfer ghouls only spawn at a really low level. 9 I think? 
---
Just enequip them when you're not using them, and reequip when you need them. Don't be casul.

Honestly they could kill him fairly quickly, I had a level 26 take a third of my health off in two shots, while I was in pa at 44.
---
I asked this question because I made my first P2P transaction (outside of close friends) they had multiple 3 star explosive 2shot handmades ... so I figured it may have been duped, I wasn’t 100% familiar with the process and if there was some catch to it like would have disappear upon restart ... Thanks all for the friendly informative feedback !!
---
Pretty sure you could bypass the "buy an Xbox" part and just create a gamertag on [xbox.com](https://xbox.com) and message him from there.
---
Ignore the reality mate, you obtained legal, its ok, someone else obtained by duping, its ok too, it is not OK to be a dick with your TSE it is the only thing I say in this post.

I only downvoted you because you say you downvoted me. (?)

I am on PC! I really just want the Blade back. I would appreciate it so much! Let me know if there's anything I can give you, I'm going to farm a bunch of scrap and ammo this weekend. I'm around level 40ish.

Haha! I was thinking the same thing the first time!
---
Here's another https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ I  dare you to click that link!!!
---
If I remember it was for the canvas bad debacle and to my knowledge they fixed it
---
Not that you want to hear it but reinstall the game? 
---
U're simplifying the issue, duping literally ruins the endgame. In every other MMOs, duping usually results in a perma-ban wave.
---
Inside the vault said that lever-action reload is being fixed next patch 
---
Why do they use all the ammo
---
It was also for their refund policy 
---
It’s better to go 2H and pick up a melee weapon that has good legendary effects such as faster swing speed which honestly 1H weapons do marginally better. A good pickup that would set you up for a long time is the All rise unique super sledge that you get from Watoga upon the completion of the mission “Mayor for a day”.
---
Just be mindful that you are level 50 at the time you pick up the mission or else the weapon will scale to a weaker level.
---
And to talk about one handed weapons, as I briefly mentioned the only thing they have going for them are they’re usually fast to swing such as a knife but unfortunately you’re sacrificing power for speed whereas a super sledge with the added swing speed perk Martial Artist is much more devastating per hit. 
---
With this said there are interesting one handed weapons, I got myself a knife that swings 40% faster which is pretty cool I guess but it’s more of a novelty.
---
TLDR:  2H melee&gt; 1H melee
---
And one of my favorites https://youtu.be/UjCdB5p2v0Y
---
The same thing that usually happens to these sorts of lawsuits. Nothing, at least as far as I can tell.
---
Yeah you can disable any of the notifications that pop up on screen. You'll still receive a message, you just won't get a notification telling you about it.
---
Unpatched bug since release... supposed to only be able to prime up 5 shots max but as soon as you equip the weapon the firing chamber is stocked with literally all your ammo and shoots it all in one shot
---
The good lad here is helping everyone in any way he can.

As a parent of a young child, I'll keep the scorchbeast screams over this.

If you scrap a frame with gear on it....the gear just  transports to your inventory. 
---
That paragraph looks like it was written by a minor  
---
I don't even pick locks any more unless it's an area I've never been to. If it's a lvl 3 I'll do it maybe 25% of the time but more often than not its just an inconvenience to swap out the perk cards lol.
---
I know that probably sounds like I'm a dbag but I'm level 98 and the odds of there being something in there that is really worthwhile are like 3720 to 1...

You may not want to admit that. Retaliatory downvoting usually isn't looked at favorably upon. I only downvoted you because you were being hypocritical and then brought up your downvotes (your edit).

&gt;EDIT: I am surprised by the number of thumbs down in this subreddit, as far as I can see duppers don't fucking like to mess up. 
---
Oh if only you weren’t on PS4... i really want one. :(
---
I'd say no. The workshops aren't very good anymore except the ammo factory. Especially with the server stability issues.
---
Btw, Grafton Steel Bug is the name of my Black Metal Beatles cover band.
---
The 450+ Karma and comments seem to say otherwise
---
Roll around with a group of friends and start pvp. Or have your buddy gain a big bounty and have him sit in your base and wait for people to come to you
---
I had Cinderella, and got juice and sugar bombs. Lol
---
I was living large back when it was producing 20 scrap an hour verses 10 ore. Luckily I was able to pick up enough plans before I got nerfed.
---
Huh I guess I've learned a Lil something 
---
Small nuke requires small name. Behold Miniton
---
I have a level 5 one. 
---
Then wasteland doctor would be a thing. I rember fo4 had one with guards.
---
u can go..make sure u store ur junk in the stash box tho
---
iirc it only bugs out the first time you fire it and works as normal subsequently.  Stash your ammo to test it.
---
Also squirrels, horribly mutated as they may be.
---
Oh its awesome. I bought the game at its "relaunch"
---
Warning: If you have a full time job its hard to keep up &amp; stay relevant in PvP. The game gets some pretty big PvP changes every 3 to 6 months or so by design. So it forces you to go back into pve, grind ALOT.  
---
Thats a waste of water
---
This seems like a pretty good idea unless some other option turns up.
---
Haha thanks! I wondered if anyone would catch that. Moana was my son's favorite movie for an ungodly amount of time. I can't count how many times I watched it.
---
Is there any other perks that anyone can recommend to get the most of out the jetpack such as reduce the AP drain etc.
---
Does the Marathon Runner perk work with using the jetpack?
---
My camp is just south west of Whitespring next to the 🐍 on the map. But it's there for all to use/enjoy. There are instruments, purifiers, all benches, enough plants to make 4 adhesive periodically and just enough turrets to discourage some creatures. If I'm on (Xb1 Lissasis)  I'll even sell you aid supplies .. can't wait for player vending .. have fun and let's be careful out there .. 
---
Ha nice, and yeah I figured after the resource nerf a while back it wouldn't be a great way to get steel but figured I'd give it a go. Bugged anyway :/
---
It COULD be much better if they reworked the perk system so that there is the concept of "combat" and "non-combat" perks. Combat perks would work similarly to how all perks do now, limited by card cost against your SPECIAL stats, and non-combat perks would still need to be acquired through level-ups or card packs, but are always active once acquired.
---
If it gave the power of all that ammo it would be close to a one hit kill on the scorchbeast queen but after testing different ammo amounts I can conclude that it only strikes with the power of a single charge 
---
I think that levelling up requires the same experience from 50-100 then after 100 requires a higher amount they stays the same.
---
It doesn’t go up (like say in Pokémon go where levelling up is exponentially higher each time above a certain level)
---
I was in a rush to write sorry i didn't put proper punctuation.
---
This happened to me when I started playing on Christmas Day.  I was a bit weird out at first because I'm just wary.  So, I decided to follow him and he was an lvl54.  Boy am I glad I decided to not remake the wheel. He also showed me to the camp and even waited while my curiosity took over and took in the view of our surroundings and the controls.  He was so patient he did all this without a mic.  He got me to lvl5 real quick and gave me guns and a leather pocketed full gear. I was happy with that because it would have taken me forever to get all the materials to upgrade.  The gun I received lasted to lvl15, before it was just to low to use anymore.  As we were trading a lvl92 came by and he traded with us but overpaid us on purpose to help out. Basically, it helped out a lot. 
---
Yep blood pack is the hardest ingredient iirc for it
---
When people have a multi story base with turrets that can shoot the enemies on the top floor i think thats a dick move. Ive had peoples bases with the bottom floor turrets that help me when i run back outside so im alright with that.
---
I usually set my base up over the water to get some unlocked purifiers for anyone to take and 4 turrets. Ill run back to my camp if im being swarmed. Being over the water doesnt get many spawns near it so youre not essentially stealing kills off people
---
If they’re killed by another mob or an exploding vehicle they’ll often keep beeping. It happened 3-4 times for me. 
---
2-2000 is Whitesprings clubhouse.
---
Then make an alt and do it again.
---
So what i warned everyone about like as soon as it was announced 
---
I don't have a TSE.  I don't dupe.   I don't have a bloodied melee, and I don't use my only explosive legendary.
---
I still oneshot mole miners.  And no, I'm not going to wait for other players to "tag" them first.  I also fair perfectly well in groups of TSE users.  I get plenty of "tags" and kills.  Mostly because I actually pay attention and engage enemies the moment they show up instead of dawdling around waiting for an opportunity to plink something and leech off of better players.
---
No what im saying is from the law firm I would expect better..
---
Played 2 hours last night, crashed 4 times. Worse experience I’ve ever had with this entire game. 
---
&gt; don't do things that annoy me
---
Don't play multiplayer games. Better yet, just don't cry when someone outplays you.
---
He's a novelty at first but then you quickly realize he's useless.
---
My guess is the lawsuit got dropped because they didn’t have enough money or ground to stand on because what’s stated in their return policy. 
---
Maybe put up a pic first??
---
They kept beeping when I killed it but there are times it stops.
---
My bad I’ll do that it’s my first time selling from reddit
---
The enclave rose one should be like the civil war event. You can chose a side and battle over control. The server should be temporarily effected like rose is now modus terminal or modus now owns top of the world 
---
Na they be like ima do a line of coke of yo ass haha
---
Yo you looking to trade one of those explosive pipes for 1.5k? My build is built around that and I just moved like... mmmm about 20 yards NE of a fissure😥
---
You on xbox? I'll make it worth your while of you give em to me
---
No.
---
This is an online RPG. You are not the only person playing. Making it so "nothing respawns" would be a terrible experience for everyone except the one guy who cleared the area before you got there. 
---
Enemies should spawn regularly. They just shouldn't as numerous or as high level at the golf club. 
---
Make Whitespring a mid tier zone, and give people the incentive to go somewhere else for their end game content.
---
There's numerous caves and other interiors we barely go into. Populate them with badass enemies. Maybe a daily quest similar to the squatters one, sending you into different locations with a boss that drops some great loot.
---
Give us some content. Not just "Hey, we're going to make the enemies despawn now."
---
 that only works after you've become an initiate iirc
---
There’s so much of that, especially with gnomes and teddy bears. 
---
I think it's pretty much what any reasonable person, or person who has seen this attempted in the past, would have concluded. Most of the people who want to watch the game fail were probably all over it, but these lawsuits hardly ever go anywhere. If anything, they restrict the companies ability to communicate about things without getting legal involved in the community management process.
---
I agree.  I’m also curious if some of it is account based, not character. On one I’m farming plastic for shells and the other, plastic for bulking to grind up to 15 to buy my own level locked plans. There’s never a full place I hit with both. 
---
I met Bean the other day, he was a bro and helped me claim the muntitions factory. 
---
I’m level 56, PSN is sirrus86 
---
May have lol u r encouraging dupers smh
---
If there’s an officer nearby that’s it sometimes too, directional sounds don’t always work. 
---
It only became a thing after it was nuked a few times.  I went there in BETA before it was ever nuked and it was a fun place for lowbies.  Once folks discovered the high spawn rate, and it was nukable, it went to crap as happy farm land for legendaries.  
---
Meh, it’s a no win now.  If you take away the ability to nuke it, you’ll piss off the higher level players.  If you leave it as-is, it’s almost unplayable for the folks it was intended for.
---
Like I said, I understand wanting to not PvP and respect that, but I consider stealing my dropped loot theft, and that's not being "peaceful".
---
I think tagging in order to be able to loot junk is a smart idea.
---
So, what some of us have been suggesting, where if you have say 3 str, you'd be able to equip 3pts of combat perks (damage/whisper/speed chems, etc, basically stuff that actively affects combat) and 3 points of utility perks (strong back/pack rat, traveling pharmacy, things that don't actively affect combat, but still give you bonuses to doing some things)
---
;) that was the first thing i tried
---
I have a Fallout 4 character with almost 60 of them. Luck builds are a hell of a thing. In FO76 I have only gotten a few. I ate one hoping for a secret achievement. Sadly I just have one less pie.
---
Just like normal and in the compass
---
My first time at white springs was being chased by 40 ghouls and dying 
---
How do you know he's not on ps4?
---
I see. Thats good to know. I'm always the one sharing it but I'll have to let my team know 
---
Rocket 69, it's a two seater.
---
It was a horrible idea to begin with they fixed the canvas bag and the refunds imo should not be giving out because they already downloaded the game 
---
LOL waaaaaaaaaah
---
And then there's me who drops stuff for newbs and the fuckers just try and attack me or demand more or attempt to destroy my base with their pipe pistols 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Oh yeah there a bunch of youtube videos about it yet no update videos i was hoping i would get someone who actually contacted them in this thread considering they posted on reddit they were doing the lawsuit
---
At the very least I would appreciate the scorched not spawning inside the turret...
---
Hey! Yeah I would love to take you up on that!
---
I can try to find what plans i have for big guns or even just give you the caps for one. I get home at 10 Central, and my name ingame is the same here, Jay013
---
Guess there is a limit to you Jake! Hahahaha
---
A lot of people don't seem to understand the problem here.  I went through the building thoroughly, and I only found 3 holotapes.  2 are log recordings from the director.  The third is called "ATLAS Director's Password".  There is also an ATLAS Utility Key.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
None of these server to unlock the terminal in the control room on the top floor called "Army Data Analysis Terminal".  It "Requires Key" and cannot be hacked.  Activating it says "Password Required".  I have explored almost all of the map at this point and haven't found this password anywhere, although it could conceivably be in a really obscure location like the TNT Dome keys.
---
This is still the top result when trying to search for this password, so it would be great if anyone could confirm actually finding it or being able to access that terminal.
---
Is it legendary?
---
I am waiting for the nuka dark lawsuit
---
I feel very sad that no one has said this to you. I'm sure we can arrange something.
---
Yes just be careful b/c it will choose mods over bulked items to scrap
---
Expecting people to stop doing this is like telling a shit sandwich to stop smelling so bad. 
---
mate, I don't even care about votes positives or negatives, it is ok, you don't share my ideology that's great I clap you for having a different point of view. I am not here to compete with you about likes my friend sadly I won't give you that pleasure. hf. downvote whatever you want you are free.
---
I have 40 of each pm me
---
No that’s not really what I impress.  It’s basically more of bad etiquette.  It’s more of a “I can but should i”
---
If I don’t like the etiquette I can hop servers and that’s ok.  It’s just getting more and more frequent that I go to kill ghouls in person and someone is shooting missles automatically through the windows at ghouls that I roused.  
---
Like you even need to wonder?
---
Yes, but you can actually get low level TSEs and BSS's. If you were to make a twink you wouldn't want Weight Reduction armor, though, which is what most people consider a god roll on armor. You would definitely prefer Assassin's, which everyone thinks is bad
---
If you still need help and are on pc i can give you a hand and show you my base. I use advanced power connectors in many ways to power my base.
---
Yup, "gimme me one a them pepsi-cokes."
---
If you're wrecking afk camper bases perhaps a video for the memories? 
---
Inquiring minds want to know...
---
Oh sweet summer child...
---
Yeah how many shit sandwiches have you asked to stop smelling like shit? And why are you personifying shit sandwiches? Or making them even?
---
You want all the Rifleman perks at rank 3, Demolition Expert rank 5, Bloody Mess rank 3 to start. If you want even more boosted damage at low HP, then rank up Need Rage to 3 and get the Adrenal Reaction mutation (more damage the lower your HP). For a bit more of situational damage, put some points into Revenant. It'll boost damage for 2 minutes whenever someone revives you.  With all of that on, I've hit for 4332 with my TSE Prime Gauss Rifle.
---
The mothman that appears at the end of the lighthouse event also gives +5% for an hour after you interact with it.
---
Yes, please do these tests and post the results to YouTube!
---
It's because she's got chainsaw hands and d-cups full of justice.
---
Where are the preset load outs. One for nukes in white springs, one for the queen, one for crafting, etc.. I love being able to switch out perks but it can be a pain. There’s been many times I’ve dropped the nuke fast traveled to my base to repair my guns and forget to unselect crafting perks. 
---
Wait what? We have a chat? since when?
---
You do know you can buy it from a vendor in Whitsprings, right?
---
Hidden achievement unlocked, one less pie
---
Yep, at this point I only pick and hack the doors in the silos when I'm running queens.
---
From their blog it looks like they are investigating every company under the sun
---
You mean "if it is *lock-picked*" right?
---
That's wierd.. it bugged out over and over the first time I used it and now it does as you say lol ... I had stashed my ammo and it was chewing whatever I took out in single shots with no ability to charge up but now after being offline and doing the exact same thing it seems to work fine lol cool!!
---
It's not outplaying, it's griefing. Sounds like you need the wiki to figure out the difference.
---
You need to get a priest then, cause your shit needs cleansing. 
---
I can give you a explosive pipe pistol if you want
---
You don’t know my life
---
Pretty sure sure mj is already in "maintain mode" and extra content wont ever see the light of day, outside of their shitty, overpriced ATOM store 
---
Hate to bear the bad news, but that’s readily available in Whitesprings at vendor pricing, so you’re not likely to get any bites. 
---
If you don't have any TSE why are you even in this post? mate you want to create conflict or what?
---
Add me @ soggyest 
---
The school buses just say, "West Virginia School District" instead of like. A county name or some other local designation. 
---
"Swing away."
---
That would also be nice.
---
Yep! Added it in the first post. It's now also got the location for Beta silo after a tip further down.
---
I did server hop after the one I got, but I'd even server hopped before that and it still wouldn't trigger any for the longest time. I'll try it again and hop more frequently. As far as I know though my friend didn't server hop so I'm still not sure how he got so many to trigger so quickly.
---
Bloodied is better with vats, two shot is better without vats, armor pen is weaker than both but has not condition/downside to it.
---
I'm curious as to what type of bread is used to make such a sandwich. I only have wheat in the house.
---
damn, on PS4, unfortunately.

Just drink toxic water instead you can spam collect it and spam drink it

If anyone is going to make a refund policy “air tight”, it’s Bethesda.

Can’t have anyone trying to refund those micro-transactions!

Make sure you have some of the scrap you want to unmark on you, go into Junk view on PIP boy inventory and switch to Component view (C on PC) and then you can tag and untag individual component types for search.

Do you have a perk equipped that prevents you from getting radiation from food/drink?
---
I see
---
Hell, I love to chaperone field trips with little ones. Let them get some hits in, I do the killing. Everyone takes pictures and brings home souvenirs. Fun for all. 
---
Nice!
---
I guess I could use my Jetpack to get away
---
Yep. I came across a base on a putting green. Single foundation base. Shitty wooden 4x4 cabin with all benches, surrounded by turrets. I just wanted to check it out anyway. Door locked with two level 80ish players inside. I looked through the shutters to see what was inside, and they closed them on me. Mighty neighbourly.
---
Just go to the team menu and leave team it brings them back 
---
I have one of these, too, but my buddy informed me that he can hear everything I say even when I'm "muted". Have you had that experience?
---
Yes. Put the item in your invy. Open you pip boy and fo to you junk. Select over that junk. At the bottom of the screen it tells you what to press to "view components" or something like that. Click it. Go to the item you don't want to search and click it. Magnifying glass should disappear
---
that is a great idea on the Decon shower, thank you. The process definitely took a hit on my Rad Away stockpile. What's funny is that I used to have tons of it and sold it off because "I'll never use all this". (Smacks forehead)
---
I think they just come along with having Home Defense 3, which is under Agility for some weird reason.
---
If I see lowbies at WSR I will help them. I don't care what level they are. Experience is in the game

Found it  :)
---
I’m selling it for a lower price than that because I accidentally bought it
---
What’s considered bad etiquette? Like stealing your junk? 
---
Thanks, do you know if you can do this on PS4 too?
---
Yea, but the more people whine about it means that higher the priority of it being fixed when Bethesda works on the next patch.
---
Corn, tato, and mutfruit is all you need. Set up a farm and you'll never need adhesive again. 
---
You guys are asking for a lot 😂
---
"Make Whitespring a mid tier zone, and give people the incentive to go somewhere else for their end game content."
---
Basically this.
---
But until there's no new content, people should not be encouraged to run in circles just killing enemies and complaining when they can't farm because other people are playing too.
---
And yes, making the ghouls respawn very rarely would pretty much clear that place of all this, and hopefully they'd find better things to do than run from ghoul 1 to ghoul 12,486.
---
Oh that saddens me  :(  it would be the greatest "DENIED!" in the game.
---
The conversation loop I thought was a reference to Oblivion's piss-poor random conversations. I found it, it made me laugh real good, and it's those little things I love in this game.
---
It's been better since the maintenance (xbox) but it seems now the forever gear pops up more when a team member joins on world, vice versa.
---
I’m on PS4 but keep me posted on results!
---
Seriously the number of posters that say "how can we stop dupers!?" whilst admitting to buying duped items is getting ridiculous. The way you stop dupers is stop buying their shit. If you're going to take some moral high ground about it at least have the decency to not encourage it.
---
Check the market sub. I've seen plenty of sellers on ps4 as well 
---
Wait. How ?

Vendors never change inventory. It seems every vendor in the game have the same inventory always, and never changes. They might have their own individual inventory, but the same vendor ALWAYS sells the same plans for me.
---
 I'm almost 400 hours in, and haven't bought a new plan in 2 weeks because of this. I have nothing to spend my caps on, because the vendors inventory never offer anything new. And i'm still missing a lot of plans, so that is not why. All I want is to buy some plans for my T60, but the only plan ever sold for that one is the motion assist servos, which I already got 40+ of, from events. 
---
I can only hope this is a bug, which is why I'm reporting it here. 
---
Are you like an idiot or something?
---
Did it reach the storage cap? I am not sure off the top of my head but I think those extractors have a maximum storage of 40 or 80 steel so you have to make sure to keep collecting it or it will stop producing. 
---
They're very common in the region immediately surrounding Watoga. Thus all the treestumps all over the place and the beaver dams in the rivers there. 
---
Black metal beetles band XD
---
That's in Whitesprings bunker right? I thought about just doing that, as I just gained access but haven't done that part of the quest yet. But I've heard 1) they're pricey and 2) other PS4 users have reported issues with them not working. Still I may just have to grind the caps and roll the dice with that if the "cheap" method doesn't work.
---
Who's to say that Coke did exist before 2044 when Nuka was invented? There's enough wiggle room there. 
---
It's just a different button but the option is there
---
Only one way to find out which is best, right? 
---
OP is about to get a job offer from Bethesda...   
---
"You understands our design philosophy so perfectly, we need you on our team"
---
^This
---
Yo that shot must have done a lot of damage though haha
---
Scorchedbeasts also seem to have a lot of explosive resistance, which doesn't get weakened by armor pen(padded/dense chestpiece mods add the some effect to you char).
---
I’ve used most of my doubles as backup cards maybe a lvl 2 instead of 3. Makes for better builds. 
---
Listen man, I got flamed out of my own SBQ run after doing the bunker solo, because I shouldn’t be there at my level (60 is too low?) and wouldn’t pull my weight. Don’t expect anything but salt to this kind of post, because to that kind of player it’s just another whiner and more reason to be pissy. 
---
Also some times the quick view is empty but there is actually stuff in the extractor. Go to the transfer screen and you'll see 
---
I’m certain they’re already aware of it and are working on it already. Some bugs can’t just get fixed overnight unfortunately 
---
You can see the button layout in the pictures of the link I sent
---
I start at National isolated radio station south to westek then on to huntersville. 
---
I'll take a few and pay a fair price :) I'm on PC though.
---
Grind areas like Whitesprings and get the XP from the ghouls. Do events in higher end areas. 
---
Then, once you're about level 50 or so, look into launching a nuke and once you get that down, whitesprings is the goto area for power leveling.
---
I would give up all my weapons and armor to fix the economy and the flood of duped items. They wouldn't do that but honestly, long term would benefit.
---
Have you not played any other multiplayer game ever
---
That's the last part of the silo run. When the little bar in your quest scroll finished, it would be time to launch. 
---
What about using TSE weapons to take out annoying Scorchbeasts or even the SBQ?
---
Uhm, you need to equip chemist and super duper. It's all I'm saying.
---
Owning preserved pies is the real status symbol in this game. High levels and epic gear are just distractions from the ultimate goal.
---
You lucky bastard.
---
But it will cause server instability /s
---
Wish it worked like that but pretty sure it only counts for 1 shot as in 1 ammo power for all the ammo consumed .. it caught me early on with the first one I picked up wanted to test it used it on an assaultron of all things and got my butt handed to me when it took all my ammo for a tiny sliver of damage and I was momentarily defenseless lol
---
Try hitting transfer. Sometimes the extractors hide some or all the mats they have in them until you do transfer. For some reason it doesn't show when you just walk up to or it takes a while for it to show. 
---
I did that run yesterday. So unless there was a hotfix or something it should still work. 
---
It crashed twice last night during nukes. First while launching a nuke last night. Got glitches into the location selecter. Good thing for the recent players tab. And the second time I was mid queen battle. I usually play in a group but was solo last night randomly invited a guy to a team. So at least that crash wasn’t as nerve wracking. 
---
I would agree and expected to see more than we have with consideration of what they wanted this game to be. There doesn't seem to be any engagement between the devs and the community outside the week "inside the vault" posts which mostly repeat previous weeks posts or make short vague statements about the future.
---
This could've been a billion dollar a year game but instead it feels "orphaned" though I know it's not.
---
Thanks. What happens if one of the 5 robots dies that you’re protecting?
---
I've made the mistake of thinking VATS and power armor would work well together. It turns out, draining your action points also drains fusion cores. So much for my VATS build wrecking the Queen bitch.
---
Anglers, definitely. Sometimes in Toxic Valley, usually southern Mire. Take Darbney Honestead, every defense I’ve had has been Anglers and they all drop 5-8 adhesive on kill. 
---
Event farming keeps things moderately interesting for me.
---
I've collected hundreds and I've never even seen a ranged weapon with the explosive effect. It's entirely possible that I had one and sold it without knowing (by failing to inspect the weapon thoroughly).
---
For future reference, quests are a terrible source of xp. You definitely should be exploring and killing stuff more often. Try finding new locations and experience the wasteland 
---
That we know of. We have a basic picture, but not every tiny detail. Maybe there are survivors that found a place to hide from the scorched. We haven't found them because to hide from the scorched you have to disappear completely. My personal belief. Just leaves a tiny but of hope in the game
---
So maybe a bloodied vats reduced crit build is better for the queen?
---
You just go to the designated terminal and build a new one 
---
hit me up if you need help with anything. currently 62, but I can craft a lot of armor and weapons.. recently got to the last quest, so looking for things to do! ha!
---
Shhhhhhh
---
I don't think the reward is worth the effort and materials.
---
Not many people do actually. It kind of doesn't make sense. I scrapped mine as well before learning this and haven't found one since. 
---
it's for a church honey, NEXT
---
I captured it the other day and noticed something similar. For the first 20 minutes or so everything was fine, then nothing in the extractors - until I hit the “transfer” button.  It was in the extractor, but not visible outside the transfer menu. 
---
Thanks! That's the one I have waypointed. 
---
Thanks! looks like it really is just trial and error.
---
I've also found that building more stuff in your camp seems to affect the location too, but I was able to get it pretty close to where I want it.
---
Built my camp on the top of Seneca Rocks, so if you're not careful it'll spawn you over the cliff and you'll fall all the way down.
---
A great idea. It would also be cool - but I'm not expecting it - if reloads had "phases" that you could complete mid-reload and resume when you switch back, so you can accomplish partial reloads when you switch weapons and then complete them when you switch back.
---
For instance: Let's say you're reloading a hunting rifle. That takes several steps:
---
1) Removing the magazine
---
2) Inserting a new magazine
---
3) Pulling the level to chamber a round
---
Let's say you completed step 1, then switched your weapon. When you switch back to the rifle, it's "mid reload" and continues where you left off, meaning you insert the new magazine next.
---
I've seen this in other FPS games, though I'm struggling to remember where...
---
That does work, however it only gives me 30 points of radiation. I'll use it for now though. Thanks for the suggestion!
---

Fallout 4 on PS4, yes. I'll try to take a picture for proof.

Nope. For me they say "Protec-" and then they are dead due to my Instigating Super Sledge.

---
I found the satellite in a nuke zone and thought that the nuke somehow brought it down lol.
---
Now you know! Revisit that same spot and it could be any number of other interesting things. 
---
Except there aren't better things to do. That's why everyone goes to Whitespring.
---
Your solution to people complaining about not being able to farm is to make it so no one can.
---
The only thing you're encouraging people to do with your "solution" is for them to play another game.

Just completed "Little Cat's" evaluation. Result and pic HERE: https://twitter.com/HoaWasteland/status/1081346493032783872?s=19
---
Nope it's still bugged... can be fired properly after getting through the ammo glitch with help. It does not register its actual damage... watching 90% of a diseased grafton monsters health get damaged and then it all comes back and only a tiny amount of health is gone....
---
Aside from the other advice there are legendary affects that reduce item weight. I have one for weapons another for ammo. They do stack with your perks. For me many ammo types show up as zero. They aren't truly weightless. If I dump a few thousand .38 rounds I will gain a pound or two of carry capacity.
---
I get radiation from food and other consumables. [Toxic Water](https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Toxic+Water) gives me the 30 points of radiation specified.
---
When you collect toxic goo do you get it from the large green vats or somewhere else?
---
If you like the exploring aspects of other fallout games, enjoy scrounging, and event based stuff that’s random, I think it would be for you. 
---
that 'law firm' posts to a blog and is basically a group of ambulance chasers

Pick a build and go with it. I'm lvl 118 and have another 29 levels of respec before my build is finished 🙁
---
Isnt he on the hatetrain for this game tho?
---
Exactly.  Stealing your loot is, at least tangentially,  pvp.  And this "passive aggressive pvp" where I get you killed and steal your loot, or just steal your loot cause it is there, is currently a failing.
---
As a random aside, I remember way back in Everquest I played race war PvP.  (Elves vs humans vs "shorties" vs trolls/ogres/dark elves.)  They were constantly adjusting what could be taken from a player killed player.   When I ended my eq time, you could only loot currency.

Where is DC island!?
---
Taking aggro and running away from the group, being rude in voice chat.  Honestly it's got to be pretty bad because I am very friendly to most players and regularly gift stimpacks and ballistic fiber.
---
There already is a respec option.
---
I was in the same boat just yesterday. I didn’t realise I had to assign perks also 🤦🏻‍♀️
---
Yeah sure, psn? 
---
I’m not expecting anything. I’d rather trade with people for their treasures like a red white and blue blooded American. 
---
Cranberry is awesome.
---
There is one related to a quest that is level 1. I traded it to an alt to let them have access to that sweet sweet 1000 rad resist right from the get go.
---
Nuka Dark wasn't a Bethesda thing, this is why people need to do their research and why the youtube retards need to stop trying to sell view on emotion instead of on facts.
---
Silver Screen Bottling Co purchased rights to produce Nuka Dark from Bethesda.  Silver Screen Bottling Co is the party wholely responsible for the Nuka Dark fiasco.  Trying to sue Bethesda for the Nuka Dark bullshit, would be like some one trying to sue Disney for the Battlefront 2 lootbox fiasco.  Yes Disney owns Star Wars, but they didn't produce the product in question, a different company did, and that company purchased the rights to do so.
---
Tbh the fastest queen kill I've seen till now was made with a bloodied +40% swing speed deathclaw gantlet with a nerdrage/addrenal build..."only" 4k dmg per swing but the queen has no special resistances against it, I think the queen was dead after 6-8 hits(it lands more often than normal sbs). For guns: in most cases TSE, you won't need vats with that kind of dps.
---
I ended up selling most of them but have the pipe pistol left
---
ign: marco810
---
That’s when I’d step in and fill the higher level, being a higher myself, full of bullet holes, and while they’re down on the ground, pull out a pistol and do a headshot up close
---
Ir maybe just all we need Is one perk card for lockpick and one hacker with a value of one on each , and just increase the dificulty of the 2nd and 3rd rank terminals and boxes, that should compensate something.
---
Did you notice nuked flora in the area?

You like my dingy hallway? I like my dingy hallway

I'll take it thank you. Gamertag is AngryBlackGamer

I never got a set from the quest, had to kill the queen 20 times to get the plans to build my own so it can collect dust in my stash box
---
So they're not far from the Sites. I'm gonna go Charlie silo hunting tonight. No spoilers! Lol
---
with a team maybe you could at that lvl but honestly you wait until lvl 50 plus have solid gear and supplies ready
---
Biggest mistake ever.
---
That's true. I run a melee build and we always kill it no problem.
---
Do the Monster Mash event at Watoga High School, it triggers by entering the building.  One of the quicker ways to find xp pre level 50.
---
Play the missions with an unarmed build to 50, then grind levels. Post 50, the story was easy mode because my weapons.
---
R2 R2 L1 R2 LEFT DOWN RIGHT UP LEFT DOWN RIGHT UP.
---
yeah they can be up to 3k caps with hard bargain 3 on. sometimes it’s a better option, especially if u don’t want perks like herbivore or empath. 
---
Oh were talking about a different game?
---
They won't fix it. It's not broken. Toxic goo is there for high rad builds. It's an intended part of the game.
---
I use 2 handed in nuke zones but outside power armor I switch to unarmed and slot in weight reduction in place of the other six perk points. I got pretty lucky finding an instigating boxing glove. it weighs nothing and is so fast. So I like un armed because you can max it out by level 7 and is less perk intensive 
---
Wow, 45 sounds wrong. I've finished at 19 and got a level 15 set out of it. I also finished in the high 20s and got a level 25 set that I never used, because I had already put together a set of T45.
---
I am looking forward to player vending, but marking people's camp location would be dangerous due to griefers. Part of the reason i chose my location was because its out of the way and you can die easily before getting to it by land.
---
An alternative would be purchasable plots near well traveled areas such as train stations.  A form of Bazaar, like the workshops players could pay caps to set up a shop in that area alongside other players. Automated vending machines with player set prices, space allocation tied to stash to prevent storage abuse. 
---
Much like the workshops, when the player leaves the server so does the shop. Shops have their own budgets so you can build something nice and get creative.
---
If they do not do that, My camp budget is almost maxed and it would be painful to allocate budget for the vending machines. To which i hope they increase budgets across the board. Otherwise only players that are willing to dedicate their bases to being a shop will truly benefit from such. 
---
Huh? End game people are using no armor low health damage builds..
---
Yes this is why i know this game is a fucking joke that i rgret spending money and 100+ hours.
---
Only time someone talked to me was at the top of the world with Rosie. I listened to him argue with his wife for a couple of minutes while I was invisible. After they stopped and he was looking around I popped up and said hello. His response was “Fuck that, I’m not talking to no random bitches” and then fast traveled away. I was perplexed. Why have your mic on but don’t want to talk to people? 
---
Do nuke launches affect interior cells?
---
Is that the problem with the ghoulfers? I've been there every time and am forever stuck at 9/10 of those jerks.
---
there's a lvl 1 version with 1000 rad resist on top of the Poseidon plant
---
&gt;  If you think you can enjoy 200+hours in a game for 60$ your mistaken.
---
I paid less than 60 bucks for Skyrim, Fallouts 3 and New Vegas, Diablos 2 and 3, both L4Ds, several Pokemon games...Hell, I paid 5 bucks for Plants vs Zombies 1 and I have over 100 hours in that thanks to being bored on planes. 
---
You're wrong. Stop digging.
---
Considering that dupers don't need your items and don't need your caps... I'd say the only reason you were able to get that item at all is out if the kindness of their heart.
---
is camp budget keep increasing after level 100? this look way more stuff than mine and im at budget limit.
---
These things and Assaultrons give me the creeps from my early level fallout 4 days. Good luck! 
---
Thats an intelligence perk, alternately you can use the Wile E. Coyote luck perk
---
Dude, you're in here accusing people who are better than you of cheating, and demanding that they play as badly as you do.  It's you that's creating conflict.
---
Did some of those people cheat?  Yep.  Probably a fair amount of them.  Your bar of "one shotting mole miners" is hilariously low though.  There are many builds that can do it without a duped explosive legendary.  There's probably builds that can do it without any legendary at all.
---
If you can't get a hit in before an enemy is dead, that's your fault.  TSE doesn't make a player acquire a target and shoot it faster.  These players are straight up playing better than you, it's just emphasized by the fact that you are only getting that one chance to outplay them.
---
I don't think bringing one person in stopped us from doing anything. We killed 3 scorch beasts and the queen that night.  
---
I just wanna point out the fact that in the trailer, that person placed 2 middle turrets and they cost next to nothing. Feels bad.
---
In your other post, what do you mean by garage? Do you mean in the main building, or the damaged shack with all the cages?
---
I'll send him over to Bethesda because ive never had simular problems with any other game
---
There is on in the shed on top of Poseidon NPP
---
NemoTouchedDaBut on ps4 add me im lvl 113
---
I put out all 6 or 7 of mine several times just by setting then down, not dropping them. Takes 30 seconds or less to set them all up, and someone else can screenshot them in 1.5 mins easy. Not sure why 2 mins total wouldn't be enough time to take a simple screenshot....
---
duping only dcs people in the vicinity. servers are just bad.
---
lol he gave me a hard time...sit behind the barrier, he fires off his rockets and then gets disabled for a few seconds; when he is in timeout, take shots at him, hide, and repeat.
---
what are you talking about dude. lol like he said, just place it instead of dropping it. you can have all your suits out at the same time
---
Have you discovered the Silos as an intrepid adventurer, or through a questline? Only the latter option yields a nuke.
---
Putting in the functionality opens it up to a mod allowing you to import pictures unfortunately, which could lead to some very questionable photos
---
Oh, okay. Thanks for the info. He's pretty cool so I'm just interested in seeing him again.
---
I'll be home in three and a half. I'll message you on here when I am if that's alright, otherwise just keep an eye out for an invite
---
Plentiful mods too. 
---
This was the first complimentary post I've seen on this Sun reddit for a while. Lol
---
(I am not hating on anyone just thought it was funny 😃)
---
Sure
---
I was level 53 when I went in solo.   There were multiple level 50 robots in there, it was not trivial.  I had a really good gauss sniper rifle and gatling gun that helped me get through it.  The robots respawn, so you have to have lots of ammo
---
Would be too similar to scaly skin (+50dr and er but -50(or 12 with classfreak) ap
---
Then do that, no on is stopping you
---
I mean, if the event actually worked like it was supposed to it wouldn't be a problem, but since the event fails 9/10 times because you failed to fix the turrent (even though you did actually fix it) it's kind of a big issue.

Gamertag?

It's worthless. Says you've won $100,000. However, there's no one to redeem the prize from.
---
Uhh, the nuka girl rocketsuit says it's only up for one more day...wasn't that a permanent thing before?
---
Still working on it for me, LVL 46-47 here
---
I encountered it a while back when I was exploring.
---
So if the seller was a duper then he was a kind duper ?! So always say thank you 🙏🏻 
---
Cool, will 1,500 caps do? My ign is Rlauntz53 but I won't be on until closer to 6:00 PM (Pacific Time) tonight.

Sry don't run around with Fatman's.
---
He's definitely a scare, for sure.
---
Im over encumbered trying to hike back to my base but if you tele to me and set a stash down it's all yours, otherwise it may take a bit
---
I love it when people drop cool stuff! Had some people do that for me when I was low level and now I return the favor.
---
There should be a "here, this stuff I dropped is for you and I'm not expecting anything in return so please stop thinking I'll attack you just because I'm higher level then you" emote. Every time I try to drop a stack of diluted stims and plans for level 10ish peeps it's a chore to get them to not freak out, even with heart emotes.
---
Agreed! I love him, and the quirks of all the Vendorbots.
---
If OP is an asshole then that makes you plain out evil. Why do you have to be like this, he accomplished something that sure, most people have done but it's still a pain in the ass and it's great that he was able to accomplish it. Just take a step back and realize your toxicity. 
---
That's just a 1 day sale - its 33% off today only.  But I hear its bugged previously, removes your underarmor.
---
Questionable photos, but a cool feature
---
LOL really though! :)
---
I'm doing this right now.
---
Make the trip to harpers ferry and watoga for the vendors.
---
Its sketchy but worth it.
---
Well it makes sense to do it because power armors are so fucking easy to come by. Any sizable building that requires more than 5 minutes to clear has got a set hiding somewhere. But sure, hang on to 5 sets you’ll never need or use when storage is such a tight problem as it is. Have a blast. 
---
That's the hellmouth. Going to need something stronger like John Constantine.

I wish I could craft that poor robot a cage to stand in

Oh wow. Wonder if there are even more variants then. I still think I'd find glowing red eyes in a forest at nighttime more frightening than green or yellow.

If you username is your gamertag it says you are offline
---
Well I've been farming a lot. Sadly the pistol drop rate from legendaries is atrocious. I've also been farming plans to make my camp even better. I still haven't found those damn flamingos.
---
I've also been experimenting on how to gather resources efficiently and quickly. I've been passing most of that info on to new folks I see as well as pass out plans I have learned. 
---
I actually today just farmed a Hunter's Long Coat. By chance the bot had two. I'm giving the other away in a thread on this subreddit. Basically I'm enjoying the community. Trading ideas and methods with other folks I meet.

Never, mutations are 150% shit, don't bother with them unless you are ready to blow 100k+ caps on serums.
---
The hunters long coat looks awful in 4K lol. Looks like you’re getting ready to defend Stalingrad in your hobo coat. 
---
I noticed this the other day but it was a mod I didn't care for so I let it happen. Do you if there is a way to have it sub in though? 
---
i don't think they should be free. there needs to be pros AND cons.. not just pros
---
I find it hilarious that I'm the opposite I prefer the mire at night. Becomes a bitch to see during daytime some times especially if there's fog.
---
I mostly want this so it doesn't remove everything else I have equipped.
---
I hate ppl who lock their homes. Like, what are you hiding, a meth lab?
---
This game was made with people like us in mind. Wasteland wanderers basically just sightseeing and picking spots on the map that look interesting. 
---
A few weeks back I was just going through servers trying to find a unique experience worth talking about. Like my friends who had someone follow them for 30 mins and only making a hissing noise every 5 mins. Or that guy that saw two people running around butt naked with vault boy masks on assaulting everything with melee weapons. 
---
I skipped a couple servers and a few hours went by until I decided to become the experience. I went on my phone and opened up a few tabs of prayers to recite on the battlefield, put on the pastors vestments, and equipped my binoculars because they kinda looked like a bible from afar. 
---
I wandered around and pretended to be trying to convert ghouls and cure them through prayer. 
---
I somehow ended up in white springs and a group of players overheard me trying to cure the ghouls. I heard them going 
---
“what the hell?”  
---
“What is that?” 
---
“Was that you?” “No.”
---
They finally spotted me and asked me “sir, are you okay?” 
---
I said “by the grace of god I am now.” 
---
I told them, “you can do anything with the power of god..” and started running into a giant mob of level 40 ghouls way out of my level range. 
---
They started shouting “sir! Come back! You’re gonna die!” 
---
I shouted “worry not for god is with me!” 
---
I surprisingly made it through the ghouls but just as I ran to heal a scorch beast popped over the mountain and I just managed to shout “demon!” Before getting killed. 
---
Long story short, I grouped up with the kids and became their healer. Baptized both of them by the dry lake north of city hall and had a blast. 
---
Or, you know, let us trade them.
---
Lime alot of topics surrounding fo76 it was bs and just kiddos screaming on their soapboxes of social media.
---
How can I steal from their stashbox though?
---
Lvl 46
---
This happens with perk packs too
---
I think if it dies from not exploding the SMB keeps beeping. But if it slodes' then no beep, just rads. Rads for all!
---
It's not full disease immunity. The Veil protects against the same environmental diseases that a gas mask does, but without the Perception penalty.
---
you still dont get any loot for enemies your turrets kill. so they are only after the xp?
---
Literally the opposite is true 
---
Every duper needs to be permabanned, along with permabans for every person they traded with, it's the only way to sort out the economy at this point.
---
That's true but at night I just cant see anything. Anglers and scorched just pop up out of no where lol
---
Lol. I'm sure imugr didn't exactly upload the highest quality image. I probably should have taken my time to adjust the settings. I was just excited about the contest idea.
---
No problems here, I've been using better inventory, component parts, and the 'noot noot' mods with no problems.
---
The one individual that juice head claimed said they weren't using cheat engine while banned may have been using reshade (which can allow wall hacks pretty easily) or the 'lock pick bar' mod, which isn't a mod but a strait up cheat (much like the 'hacking helper' thing)
---
I have debuggers, and cheat engine installed, its only when you have them running/use them while playing you'll most likely get your account flagged..
---
Yup, this is a great perk
---
I was on the last mob of a day! Disconnect
---
Could you link a picture of the shop items? I'm currently not at home rn and can't check 
---
Depends if it's client or server side. If the server goes offline, everyone does. If your internet messes up or you glitch, just you. You don't go back to the same world unless you have a friend there and you join them.
---
And my axe!
---
I think it's bugged it wont let me add. ill restart game after I get to base
---

---
No worries, 
---
There's issue with Dolby atmos, i dont pressume the game fully supports it.  if you have it on on your xbox sometimes audio gets wonky. unfortunately i'm unable to check it further as i only have one xbox at the moment.
---
in addition to that, if you die and try to pick up your junk and then die again in the middle of picking it up it will be lost penamently -tested 
---
I'm in the same boat as your friend.
---
Very few problems. But i know my network setup is unique
---
I have mine near there where the railroad tracks go over the road. I get a lot of visitors and I'm a bored high level so I will fast travel there when I see visitors and make them stuff.
---
Yeah this law firm seemed like a lie to
---
It's pretty much come to if I see high level players around the area I'm trying to go, I'll just change servers until I find one that's free of them.
---
I wish I could use unarmed, but I am always in PA. 
---
You might want to post this to /r/falloutsettlements 
---
They will love it
---
I assume he doesn't have a higher chance to spawn depending on the area of the map, but my C.A.M.P. is located a little behind Whitespring as well. I still wanna get the chance to kill him just to say I did.
---
you might be dumb lol
---
I think the recent hotfix may have changed the visibility of “world” items, it seems ver different now.  Probably to discourage hopping.
---
Also, keep in mind they have no name, they come as, "Targeting HUD", or "Optimized Servos" for example, it doesnt say Excavator Optimized Servos
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
what perk are you talking about? 
---
https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-12-21-fallout-76-map-level-zones-5076
---
There is a map in this article that will show you the zones in which higher levels will spawn death mobs for you and your companions. Only thing BGS can do is change the level cap for areas. But then that leaves higher levels in the bottom right corner of the map, lol.
---
I got one 
---
Class freak
---
+30% damage to animals I do believe
---
Even better, imagine if we finally break out and the game is entirely bug free because it was glitches in the simulation all along.
---
No, I wasn't in a nuke zone, I was near the slocum joe's east of the overseer's camp.
---
As a high-level character that ain't afraid of nothing I got killed handily by a legendary stingwing due to it's DOT (Damage Over Time). Although, it was bugged and was invincible, I should have run away / gone to a different server but I really wanted to kill it.
---
I waltzed in they're at level 12 and held my own against the high level ghouls.
---
Got alot of looks that's for sure. 
---
Jumping on things is rediculous in this game and i don't even have marsupial.
---
No, they are bound to the player who owns them.
---
  Although I've heard if someone is dumb enough to put their PA on a workbench you can steal whatever is on the chassis.
---

Why the hell am I downvoted. I understand you can put them out for 2 minutes. This guys suits are on display. The person taking the screenshots isnt the person who the suits belong to. What is wrong with you guys? They are clearly dropped to display. Or the guy making the post asked the owner.
---
Definitely not true at all. You can farm them up for free or buy the serums for around 500 each, meaning if you bought all of them it would be about 9500. Almost every mutation is amazing with class freak, some,having no negative effects at all.
---
I guess he's just a cool creature. Mine was only a level 38 though.
---
Resources, it's the wheelbarrow with poo in it
---
Excavator is actually *weaker* than raider of the same lvl(except for rr and cw)
---
Hungry, thirsty, sick, danger, downed, team up, trade - all of these have emotes plus an overhead indicator that can be seen at a distance. What else do you need to communicate to a total stranger?
---
I don't care what they do to it so long as it's optional. They need to remove slap damage and player base damage while pacifist mode is on, that's all I really ask from the system. 
---
For 2 minutes. Period. Then they recall.
---
Farmiming Whitesprings Golf Club did it for me. 
---
Nice. Can I be your son? 
---
I found my TSE The Dragon, it's rare but it can happen. 
---
I had mine here two camps ago. Great spot to attract low levels and show off how cool camps can look after gathering tons of plans. 
---
Well yea, When you're playing the game you're not controlling a real life person.
---
I have this one picture where I'm not really getting "mauled", but rather stalked on... I was level 26, just crafted all the parts to my Excavator armor right inside Garrahan Mining HQ and finished the quest, and as I'm kneeling down in my picture I see a Liberator just slowly crawling around behind me, staring directly at the camera. I snapped the photo and took it out immediately after with my Guitar Sword lmao
---
With exactly zero wires.
---
Almost any Power Armour is superior to a full set of Assassin's. The only exception might be Assassin's with the dense mod. There may be a meta shift if the Armour Piercing Legendary effect becomes more valuable, but until then Power Armour is king. 
---
I have a full set of BoS Assassin's Combat Armour and have specced into maxing out of Damage Resistance without Power Armour. Power Armour is still superior in practice. The Assassin effect may be bugged.  
---
Now watch there be a nuke in the atomic shop that functions as a powerplant
---
sometimes you get into the same server tho. I've server hopped multiple times and ended up in the same server. i know cuz I'd drop a specific item in a hidden location, and sometimes the item will still be there after a hop
---
Only way that you are buying serums for 500 each is because they have been duped to hell and back.
---
Okee doke. Thanks for replying. Been wondering this for a while. (thumbs up)
---
You need 3 razorgrain on hand.
---
Thanks for this. This will be very helpful
---
By the main building, with the armor workbench. Not the one with the cages
---
The Chinese are coming.
---
Not 1400?
---
Some of these are gonna need lore checking (Are there even alpha mirelurk kings? Thought the hierarchy stopped at the queen) but I agree with the sentiment.
---
Where do I get some?
---
Yeah several are just buggy its a lot harder to duper now so less people are duping
---
Guy I know accidentally set up his first camp there.  He’s never moved it.  Last time he checked death claws had moved in.  They didn’t appreciate uninvited guests and killed him.
---
Get a teammate and respawn on them through the social tab
---
Oh, ok. Thx
---
It’s the best way to destroy someone else’s camp. 
---
I hear that music in HP all the time 
---
Can you respawn at the vault? Probably a pain, but could end the cycle.
---
What are the floors in the main space? They look nicer than te defaults, or am i just seeing things? 
---
This seems to be true unfortunately lol
---
You can only have one food or beverage effect at a time. 
---
I have a 3* blade you can have
---
Which ones do you need?
---
Learn to read mate.   
---
You're making a fool of yourself.
---
OMG yes. There are so many black powder options I think it opens a whole new category of weapons to drop/quest for.
---
That does not change the fact that I am right. Also I can craft literally every serum in game so I sell them for that much without having to dupe.
---
I killed everything in the cave got the last key off the wendingo, left the cave and no key, all the keys are gone and game wants to send me back to bowling Green.  It was very hard died like 10 times.  They need to fix this issue!
---
I think it's more that a company is generally privy to the process of their licensed products to outside vendors. Meaning more than likely Zenimax, BGS or whichever daughter company is handling the licensing to the cola, has final say if it will ship out in said state. As it would hurt their name, in this case BGS, than the company who it was licensed too.
---
This would put blame technically on both parties, though more so on the company who had the final say {Can't say since we do not have access to their confidential agreement nor do we work for either company.
---
I say it is fair to place blame on BGS though even more blame on the manufacturer... though for BGS not anywhere to the degree they've been getting, unless they did in fact have the final say. Though more so it is due to BGS and their string of failures so far, in the eyes of the media and a large portion of fans {not all}.
---
A lot of stuff needs to get changed to cost 0.
---
Anything related to crafting should, but there should be an added perk relating to weapon decay that does cost points.
---
I’m close to 400 hours. I have played enough fallout to become a villain. My friends and I raid other players and demand caps lest their bases be destroyed.
---
Don't you know Bethesda is not actually a game studio and a bottling and programmers there are who made the rum and the bottle's.
---
Ok
---
Can confirm shielded marine from cranberry bog census violence. Stats 9/9/9 str-2 perc-1 end-2. Thanks to this post I now have shielded for bos, enclave, and marine. Thank you!!!
---
I just gave away a ton of chems and all my extra plans and recipes. I have been trying to unload this lvl 10 weapon all day if you are on PC
---
Watoga?
---
I need help same thing have digital and it’s installed but it won’t show up
---
Wait. You xbox? Lol
---
I’ll pay 25,000 caps if you can convert it to pc.
---
I move my camp near resources to craft bullets. 
---
I have an iPhone. It will not load imgur. Ever. It never works.
---
It’s especially frustrating because whenever I bring it up, people are always “did you try x, y, or z?” Yes. I tried all of a through z. Everything the internet has to offer. Everything people have suggested that *doesn’t* show up in Google. Some of those solutions apparently randomly work for some people, who then think it should logically work for everyone. They don’t. Nothing works.
---
I can’t afford a new phone, and always get iPhones handed down to me, or I’d just walk away from these pieces of junk. Laugh all you want, but god I miss my Blackberry.
---
You and me both 
---
Mine’s* I assume
---
Makes me wonder how many people are actually playing
---
This is some wholesome excellence 
---
That's ok :)
---
YEP that is my all time fav 😂
---
Take the mod out and drop it?
---
Never
---
Dupers should be banned and duped weapons should be deleted if possible. I'm pretty sure someone has sold me duped items at this point and I personally wouldn't mind if the potentially duped items disappeared from my inventory along with everyone else's. If possible, find a duped item and 'delete all.' Find out who has multiple copies of it and ban them, severity of ban should be based on how extreme the amount is because someone may have bought three of the same item and not realized that items stacked are dupes. At this point, your ban would end up banning 99% of the playerbase who still play the game.
---
TSE weapons are rare, I have a couple I've found out of thousands of legendaries. Everyone having tons of TSE weapons just devalues legitimate ones and makes the shoot n' loot aspect of the game insignificant. So in short, I agree.
---
Im guessing your not pc forgot to mention that
---
Thank you
---
1.) I don’t have PC but I want to share anyway
---
2.) if I win I’ll gladly give it to someone else ❤️
---
My best moment was when I just started and I tuned my radio to the Appalachia radio and Country Roads was on oh boy was it amazing.  Jump forward a bit This level 87 james RAIN  OF FIRE was introduced to me by my friend and Whitespring resort was nuked and we went there, I was in my hazmat suit and we killed those Bloated ghouls and gained a bunch of xp.. I got my first mutation too that made me jump high ( not sure how to spell it) also RAIN had this charisma perk that made me jump even high so we managed to get to the top of the main whitespring building and like Batman look down at the robots and the ghouls
---
That just seems kind of crappy thought doesn’t it?
---
have you uh, not been paying attention to literally anything to do with bethesda lately?
---
Billings homestead. The one that’s a workshop. There’s a lot by the actual workshop. 
---
I am assume he is stuck in an event loop. Since he died in fissure prime he was likely doing Scorched earth and during events, a lot of the time you just re spawn in a random location.
---
If this is the case he sadly has to log.
---
that name
---
Find the folder in documents/my games and take the pictures out to store on your pc.  Then take a bunch more.
---
Thanks
---
Which you’d otherwise do what with? 
---
I wonder if that's why you run down the road and suddenly there is enemies all around you.
---
Ok, thanks
---
Go to another server? Sometimes that junk you earned is just gone. It's all replacable.
---
Never, and right next to the overseers camp. 
---
Drink
---
They kind of got you two ways.
---
Its not broken and no refunds on digital.
---
Unless you live in a country with better consumer rights you're sol.
---
I’ve tried server hopping vendors, but it only resets their inventory once ever 5-6 hops. Am I doing something wrong?
---
Make sure you have enough space on your harddrive - this helps in other games surpisingly.
---
Hard reset of your console - well yeah literally every post you will find
---
Found myself crashing my game when i press too many things on my controller at the same time when there's server lag lol
---
Forward ports, and make sure no downloading is going in the background during our session. otherwise yeah things happen D: 
---
Thanks I’ll keep an eye out for that
---
My squad uses our camps as mobile artillery platforms. Each one has 4 arty units setup on it. We'll plop our camps down around our target. Usually a public shop or some one else's camp. Wait for them to show up then start shooting at them. When the rest of their team shows up we drop the steel rain on them. Its hours of endless entertainment.
---
It takes up quite a bit of the budget jsyk.
---
The Stalker
---
I play a kind of creepy hunter dude just trying to make his way in the wasteland. 
---
I have the surgical mask+welding goggles+cowboy hat and I’m usually sporting that Padded Blue Jacket. 
---
I sneak around with a taped up hunting rifle affixed with a bayonet. I’m usually out exploring with my binoculars. I’m not a great fighter and I only ever carry a few weapons on me but when I can help I do but I keep my distance. Sometimes I’ll help players being attacked by monsters from afar and simply watch them take off into the sunset once they’re no longer in danger. 
---
To be fair though, you're not usually looking at it.
---
Different depending on what you need, but houses and office buildings are generally the best.
---
Basic but Gorge usually gets me a ton of wood, especially if I claim it straight away and leave it whilst I do missions. Good for junk too, I get quite a few gears/springs etc.
---
Also interested if anyone finds
---
I surely hope not.
---
I played Archeage and you could make custom images to put on flags, sails, pictures. 
---
So.Much.Gay.Porn.
---
Read that back and it reads like filth
---
Is it not possible to just upgrade those after at a workbench?
---
What a hectic spot for a camp.  
---
I may have to roleplay this and shoot on sight. I will farm a good double barrel shotgun just to make it more legit. 😁
---
What traders? Watoga, Harper’s ferry, and that BOS robot trader right above watoga are the best. 
---
Chad (Camden Park vendor) seems to keep Excavator mods in stock. Look in his inventory for anything that scraps to Black Titanium - that's for Excavator.
---
Can you show your proof and documents for how you've come to this understanding?
---
Only asking because you asked people countering your claims to show them. 
---
Even if your correct (i very much doubt it myself) Bethesda own the Fallout franchise, its in there best interests to protect the product and make sure customers are treated correctly. If they don't want all the negative press and what not maybe they should have thought about that and done there due diligence before trusting some random company with there name.
---
That said most of this so called journalism is basically 1 man websites thinking there opinion means something more than it actually does tbh
---
Yeah, I read your post. There's a lot of things I'd love to see changed about the game, but those are some cool things that I wouldn't mind seeing added in the future. Gave it an upvote.
---
I play in third-person...
---
I got mine off Ghram the wandering super mutant trader.
---
What like Fallout 4? Fallout 4 was fucking good too. I only bought into 76 because of how much I was enjoying the fuck out of Fallout 4.
---
I’m out deep in the wastes doing the Fathers work..
---
I updated my op with directions.
---
Sounds good just shoot me a msg if im not responding 
---
Finally got the battery down and ur right they semi fixed it when the fusion core drops it let's u exit the frame
---
Serious question, which scenario seems more odd to you.
---
1.a person in fallout 76 community being interested in what others are doing in the fallout 76 game
---
2. Someone acting indignant that someone posted a fallout 76 experience in a fallout 76 community. 
---
Because Reddit is filled with Lord of the Flies idiots who reflexively downvote anything with a zero, without reading. It only take one person to trigger a chain reaction of morons.
---
Nice.
---
I've had this bug before, you can't respawn anywhere *but* where you died. This persists a complete restart of the game. 
---
You are probably just holding it wrong, have you tried holding it differently?
---
I feel you. I'm level 20 and had about 10 level 60+ scorched attack the workshop I claimed yesterday. I ended up just going offline after wasting a few stimpacs
---
I’ve read this five times and I still can’t quite grasp what it is you’re trying to say 
---
So I picked a lock and it turned out to be someone's stuff...now I'm wanted. I read that the only way to fix this is to be killed but no one is killing me. I know it's silly but I hate to have that wanted label on me cause I don't want other players to think I'm a dick who runs around robbing people. Not my style. 😊 Is there anyway to fix this?
---
I always prefer being able to, but having the button that turns user created content off.
---
End games = nuke zones. Nuke zones = no normal armor. Whether it be Whitespring farming or Queen.
---
Yes, I'm aware sometimes people game the Queen radius, but typically not always. 
---
Oh, is it even worth it?
---
The ones ive seen had full health.
---
Honestly this game half the time when I load it crashes within 2 minutes and I tried it the other day. It’s pathetic that they’ve actually realised with the way that I asked my final question they deleted/removed my ticket because if they answered it then they’d be basically left with no choice but to refund me. 
---
I’ve already spoken to a lawyer who I’ve got a meeting with on Monday regarding this as well. I’ve also spoken to a news paper copy which is a National one as their HQ is close to me and Ive been keeping in touch with them regarding this as well. They have a lot of people complaining to them for a story to go live. They’re actually very interested in pursuing this as well and this might be the last nail in the coffin for that to happen. 
---
You are calling people dicks for oneshotting mole miners before you can get a hit in.  TSE is only the current manifestation of that.  It will keep happening after TSE is nerfed.  And after they nerf the next most popular thing.  And the next most popular thing after that.
---
The solution is for you to Git Gud.
---
I was thinking about kinky stuff.. but...
---
Our base is set a bit high off the ground with TWO terrets. not 20. Its meant to be a safe place where the ghouls can't get to you. Great for leveling characters. Ironically we try and share the ghouls with others there unless the have a TSE shotgun and are just insta killing everything. Then we nuke THEIR base.
---
Unless they have changed it. Last time I check you couldn't. The weapons like Voice of set and Blade of Baset are, but I'm pretty use you can't make a level 40 Perfect storm into a level 50 at a work bench. Though I could be wrong, they may have changed it.
---
Why cloth? And how do you farm it ? 
---
I got a question.
---
Do mobs open unlocked doors?
---
I lock my door because I thought it prevented Ghouls from coming in and wrecking house.  I used to have a garage door with switch but changed layout to all steel bunker.
---
I did the same thing today. Log in , low lvl dude that has his base there, tagging everything and making sure it's all low lvl mobs that spawn.
---
There are hardly any places to farm for stuff at higher levels as it is and now you have to deal with people like this too. I did not level entire persons base, just the turrents.  For a massive bounty gg shit game design there.
---
Did you download the tricentennial pack. It’s a separate DL
---
Oh look the record player is broken again. You're preaching to a brick wall. Dupers don't care what anyone says or does.
---
I'll go you get threw those sailors my gauss rifle does the trick 
---
Don't do any missions, level by grinding and events. Do the missions once level 50. 
---
If you want easy mode, go melee. 
---
No, no. I do this too. Those dicks get what they deserve. It's bad enough people already play this game on easy mode with the amount of TSE everything, they do shit like this.
---
There are not enough mini nukes in fallout to unload apoun those ass hats a rain of nuclear fire, the likes of which they've never seen before. &gt;:(
---
 He said they like the engine because it’s easy for them AND THE MODDER, also because of the tool their using, if you want a new eninge you will need to replace the developing tool as well, and also more time to train the stuff to use their tool, they were only under 200 staff back then and not only they need to develope a massive open world game but also repair their engine, make new tool and learn how to use the new tool, that's an overwhelming amount of works for so few people, they recently increase their numbers, so it might change, New Vegas was also slow and buggy but it's consider one of best game of all time for many people included me, the question is not why they  let modders clean up their messes, but why modders are willing to clean up their messes, to me it's because their game offer the kind of experinece you won't get from anywhere else.
---
Not imo as killing the brahmin breaks it and fertilizer isn't really super valuable. As decoration? Definitely.
---
Congrats, you've informed a very small percentage of the playerbase. If a small amount of internet points and comments determined that then there's almost nothing on reddit you could call "old news". Lots of people look to karma and comments for validation, it's okay.
---
Adding you!
---
Cola Cars!
---
Tried building. Failed horribly. Cried a lot.
---
Keycards don’t expire, nuke code pieces do, the ones you get from officers
---
Just remember a lawyer will do whatever you want if you pay them.
---
Still, you're fight is with microsoft as you bought it from them though. Bethesda will close your ticket again as theyre not who you bought from.
---
Nah I'm totally muted. I usually forget to unmute after eating a packet of crisps or something. Then wonder why people aren't responding to me. I just have an adapter in the bottom of the pad that controls my headphones, with a mute mic button. There is some trickery going on trying to mute yourself through the party menu though. 
---
You will need a lot more steel than you think.  Dont drop that huge stack and pick up a bucket or two while you're out.
---
Also do the Mayor for a Day quest ASAP in Watoga.  2 vendors and a good source of general supplies and some legendary farming.  I keep my camp nearby to keep fast travel costs down.  (It's as opposite of the vault as you can reasonably get so I can get across the map for free.)
---
how old are you kid¿?
---
Can't you use the fertilizer for explosives?
---
For whatever reason I can’t get enough of this game. I enjoy it more than I did fallout 4 by far. 
---
Added to original post.
---
I can’t remember the last time I saw a mob at Whitespring that was under level 40.  I think that was back in BETA.  The surrounding roads maybe but not on the resort grounds.  Not anymore.
---
The benefits from mutations far outweigh the 6 point perk cost. There is literally NOTHING you can get that will improve your character more than mutations. 
---
Yeah well I know when my wife and I are playing together. The same chest or body yields us 2 different loots
---
I’ve just stumbled across this YouTuber
---
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh2f--CbNgCxBIbasazpdiw
---
I have followed a few of his guides and they are pretty good.
---
Thanks for the work on this! Impossible to find info on this game.
---
Also agree that the perk is worded terribly. If its you or your aim that is getting the buff, why is the gun the subject of the sentence?
---
Should it not read “increases your range and accuracy while aiming down the sights” or
---
something to that effect?
---
The thing is I submitted a refund claim to Microsoft who said I had to speak to Bethesda as they couldn’t complete the refund. I have rights under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 so thats actually what my lawyer is pressing with as Bethesda are in violation of it as they’ve denied a refund but have failed to meet any of the other requirements in line with the Act.
---
Neither was ESO 2 montha after launch
---
They just seem to really be fucking up lately in all manner of ways. 4 was definitely fun as a game to piddle around in, although it did the fallout franchise a bit of a disservice with it's terrible story and dialogue. But maybe it just seemed that way coming from New Vegas which was Obsidian. 
---
Big Nuke?
---
Even during the slowest news day in the world no real national news outlet would run the story "man denied refund for videogame." If you think they're serious and they are an actual national newspaper I have a big green bridge across the forest to sell.
---
You also may not be getting all the ore. Do you use excavator PA when mining? It gives you a bonus chance for extra ores. You should be walking out with more than 200. By time you're done you should have over 2k of lead once your perks are maxed. The real grind will be acid.
---
Nope. It's been requested from people, though. Not sure why they don't have them. 
---
Yeah unfortunately, I don't remember the exact amount. I found out the hard way by lining up the perfect shot for my first nuke drop. Instead of having my first for a loading screen I have the second nuke I dropped as one. 
---
Actually the licensure isn’t an issue at all. It just has to go through a legitimate distillery. Anyone can commission an alcohol to be produced. I have experience in that business.
---
Acid and cloth are used to make gunpowder at a chemistry station.
---
You can get a lot of cloth by crqcking safes and scrapping the pre war money in them.
---
Dropping the Nuke
---
I don’t know what the issue is, I don’t have any useful attempts to offer. But I only have an iPhone (I have an Xbox also, that’s it. No computer, no tablet, etc) imgur works fine for me. I don’t know if it’s something in the settings or if it’s a production model thing. You said you get hand-me-down iPhones, I have an 8 I think... like I said don’t know why and can’t offer help, but it works for me. 
---
Last time I checked, T60 is super cheap to repair. I remember being happy to save all those springs.
---
I think there's something like that under the defense tab
---
&gt; is, he decided to have a bit of creativity and welcome people into the game. He set up his C.A.M.P right through the bridg
---
I actually have non-damaged Hazmat Suits of level 1 (silo), level 10 (plant), level 15 (?) and level 50 (silo).
---
 
---
Sweet thanks man 
---
The damages could be changing if you are getting any buffs like adrenaline or something along those lines that happened to me once got super confused why my weapon was doing almost double damage when equipped.
---
I see people all the time into there without power armor they die like 3 times but the queen dies instantly it seems. I don't like that Im not gonna do that in queen zones but still. 
---
You've obviously tried loading the site in desktop mode then.
---
Hmmm, blank screen you say? Have you perhaps forgotten your device must be powered on in order to see images?
---
&gt;terrible story and dialogue
---
oh you're one of those canned ham talking-point-shitting trolls
---
I have never seen anyone bitch about low levels at Whitesprings. Ever. Low levels are great - just more ghouls spawn to farm. It feels like you’re setting up a non-existent outrage straw man to make yourself a “call out hero”.
---
The SBQ down in the south east corner is another matter entirely.
---
Lbs not kg you commie basterds
---
Love everything, except the part about Grahm, leave him out of it.
---
If you blueprint it you can place it down at your new camp as it is set up now, but if you dont blueprint it and you just move you'll still have all the parts in the stored tab and you can just place it all down again.
---
BTW if you are on PC we could team up and get you what you need.
---
It can be useful, as it will draw agro. But I'd only use it at the lower end. 
---
Xbox tho
---
Take off ALL perks. Place on ONLY the weapon perk + demolition expert. That will be your normal damage with said weapon outside any other perk.
---
If you can’t carry an extra person or two with your DPS in a queen fight your build sucks, period. 
---
You can go to each farm and find multiple bags of fertilizer, flatwoods has quite a bit too. It depends on if you want to passively gain small amounts or actively grab a bunch in a few minutes. The budget cost for me was a turret's worth so for me, it's not worth it.
---
You also have to decide what wire to cut when you find the undetonated nuke. It's alot of fun from the looks of it. I would love to cut the wrong wire or the right one. 
---
This is the kinda stuff that makes fo76 so appealing to me, ppl don’t have to just treat it like a normal game there’s hundreds of different ways to play and interact
---
I have an xbox tho, any way I can export them onto my external hardrive?
---
yep
---
Clever ... close to water, and most workbenches already exist.
---
Can host a welcome party for new players, and gather easy Wanted bonuses from new players who accidentally damage something not realizing what is CAMP and what is not.
---
It is a good way. I don't understand why people keep saying this. Do people not realize you can leave and come back??? Like go do whatever else you were going to do and you will have a pile when you come back to defend. 
---
They always end up giving you back more caps than you spend to take them over unless you get disconnected before the second defense. Slap a couple generators down, turn the extractors on and lock them, defend once and leave. Takes about 5 minutes and now you also have a free fast travel point.
---
I rarely move once I found a spot I enjoy. I like waterfalls with lakes,  so I'm currently stationed southwest of Alpha Silo. I did find a true waterfall in the Mire, with what looks like ample flat ground to build on, but the area is always so dark.  I may try moving there someday, but considering the time I spent building my current house, I probably won't try it for a while. 
---
It's a quarter of a defense wall. If that is the one you're thinking of.
---
When I started the game I was sure one of the bots around Vault 76 said Bell, and that is my character's name. Would be pretty awesome of they did something like that even though it is just minor detail.
---
r/ignorantimgur
---
Seriously they’re like mole people
---
Gt?
---
Thats when you roleplay as the BoS and "liberate" their weapons.
---
I only need two turrents for my base largest thing to attack me was a mirlurk 
---
Wow more impressive than anything is your ability to love two characters in this game
---
I get too invested in 1 to start a second
---
XBox or ps4
---
I've only got \~1600, but they're free if you want them.
---
gt: wrdinsd - hopping on now, will be on and off all night/weekend (single parent, so afk and on/off sporadically)
---
They are saying he did only drop them temp to show them off I don't understand how u can't read man.
---
I mean, I’ve never taken it out of the box. Is that necessary first?
---
It already did 
---
I know but for me thats where the game is a follow on from f4. So for me its totally relatable but in a entirely different setting. That is of course my opinion.
---
Ive now visited Vegas, Appalachia (Obvs), Washington, Alaska, and Boston in the fallout world. It all feels similar and natural. Its probably why I really enjoy F76 more then others as I literally put in over 10000 hrs across the series. I honestly am not bothered by certain features of the game cause Im so used to it.
---
Good or bad thing? Depends. Im enjoying F76 immensly. Sorry others arent, but again its an opinion.
---
Awesome.  Thanks man.
---
lol, I'd like to meet the lawyer who actually took that meeting, must be the saddest and most useless one in the world xD
---
Head to that BOS trader just north of Watoga and Harper’s Ferry. Both good too.  Be patient. I wasted a week looking for heavy leather leg plans and now I see them everywhere. I’ve also had good luck at pleasant valley station. 
---
https://game-maps.com/Fallout-76/Vendors-Fallout-76.asp
---
But you have to build the excavator armor to get the plans for  the power armor station right?
---
Mostly a gimmick using multiple bugs. I'd rather they just fix rad scaling like it was in FO4. Otherwise lead lining, rad resist legendary, rad shield, etc. are all worthless at the moment.
---
That’s exactly my point. 
---
Drink them rather than using them for dilluted stims. 
---
Though chemist turns stim+2pa into 4 dilluted uses, and rad builds suffer from no shortage of drinking in rad zones (high rad fluids, raw flux, inert flux)
---
Don't Fence Me In, when out exploring random areas!
---
To 600 ya but I remember them saying they were going to increase it even more
---
A good trick for melee users to kill turrets is use vats. Even if you don't normally you're character will jump up to them to land the hit. So I would just stand right below them hit vats and have a decent percent of a hit. One thing to be cautious of is one time a friend of mine got stuck in the ceiling of sugar Grove doing that strategy.
---
Gotta factor in grenadier, too, which changes the size of the explosive splash and therefore how many body parts will independently take an explosive hit worth of damage per shot landed.
---
I don't think that is the case, there's not any perks that change wepon damage based on if you have something equipped either i think.
---
It was funny.  It also kind of parodies the attitudes of people who just say “I don’t believe this because I don’t like it!!” etc.
---
It was an inspired one liner.  Props to you. 
---
This. Especially when they have an obligation to fix the shitshow of a game they made and tricked people into buying
---
Wish I could but it would overall be a loss for me because I would have to buy a pc, then I would have to buy fallout, then I would have to buy the plan
---
Did you ever happen to find this out of curiosity? Been looking as well. 
---
With having your own cute Brahmin pet? Hell yes!
---
Junk it all and thank god for bulking 
---
I feel like nuke zones should def not be as rad intensive I get it but still like allow a gas mask to do alot of the work it is a fantasy game.
---
You can turn the turrets off in each section
---
This just saved me over 100 carry weight in my stash box. Thanks!
---
It's a bug. Had the same thing happen the other day. Saw a friend on and went to chat with him in discord; turns out he hasn't played in a while..
---
Yes, closer to 1400
---
Oh yeah I entirely forgot you can do that, thanks! 
---
STOP USING DRUGS!
---
Love fallout always have always will. They dropped the ball on the damn specials system in this one though.
---
Not sure why its been done the way it is, the card perk packs make me wonder if they were at one time planning on selling them on the Atom store though....why else are we opening packs in a fallout game?? This isn't Fifa, the wall chart type of special planner from fo4 worked well and would have been much better or at least some variation off it.
---
It needs a rework, maybe not the content of the cards as such but the way they deliver it to us / our characters.
---
Active and passive card slots could help and being able to save card load outs would be awesome. Lot of QOL cards that the majority use by switching in and out when needed when by rights what diff would it make if they were classed as passives and didn't take up card slots or failing that give us load outs so we can switch them on the fly quickly and conveniently.
---
Like your ideas about some of the cards and I'm defo with you on the fact that it needs changing a bit once they've fixed the duping and other major things.
---
I need to do a stream or video dresses in the Red Dress (which is actually in game) and a tinfoil hat.
---
What platform? If it’s PS4 then add me Vulcanthropy and I’ll help you
---
Same here
---
I find one randomly on a vendor and bought it because I'd never seen one to that point. 
---
The first handy you see in 76 also says your name! 
---
damn, that sucks. is there no way to at least reduce the range at which it starts scaling? cuz this man was nowhere near me lol
---
I just found out the other day that even if you delete pics in Fo76, they still stay on your drive.  So you haven't lost anything and you could delete the in-game album to make room.
---
This. 
---
In all honesty I think the wanted system needs some serious tweaking. Maybe make it so if you're wanted and you kill someone attacking you and you kill them you don't earn caps but the bounty goes up instead.
---
As well perhaps disable the locations of players so you can't tell who is tracking you down. Though that might be a bit excessive.
---
Yeah I mean Fallout4 rad system it worked fine. You could match PA and Hazmat if you put the work in (stacking items, chems, etc) It's just literally broken in this game.
---
Same as username. I won’t be on till tmrw UK time but would gladly sell it to you
---
Go to the weird looking overgrown groves and harvest the pitcher plants. They give goo which beaks down to 4 adhesives per goo
---
And silver screen is known to usually turn out high quality licensed drinks so it's not like bethesda chose a crap company
---
dammit, now I'm going to have to compete for my scorchy.
---
This is actually a developed real life scientific theory about existence, as well as a millennia spanning, cross-cultural belief system that we are in a dream, that we are in an approximation of reality, that there is a more “real” version of existence.
---
yeah, same. its just annoying coz the loading times are pretty long for me
---
Some non-PA Builds can archieve the same Resist numbers (if not higher) than someone in PA while the PA mods are not even comparable with the legendary armor traits... maybe should do some actual math here and be fair with other playstyles..
---
I actually saw that guy this morning by the Whitesprings Station! He literally bought everything from the Vendor there and put it in his stash.
---
I always forget to swap from hard bargain to lone wanderer about the same. By the time I remember to swap back, I am ready to go sell at a different vendor. I hate it. Same with I always forget to swap into the ammunition perk until I am down to my last 10 to 20 lead or plastic. 
---
I have the tricentennial edition and still not working got it installed and everything 
---
Sorry I'm on PC, thank you though! Updated post
---
That is Grahm. He and Chally the Moo-Moo are awesome. He occasionally has good stuff for sale.
---
Idk, seemed pretty nonchalant walking up and killing it before it could even do anything; wouldn't call a fight like that satisfying. Melee is pretty darn overpowered right now although it is cool to see the deathclaw dig up from the ground like that.
---
Only when I'm trying to get that robot merchant near Charlestown
---
Occam trumps Bostrom.
---
Run the golf course a couple times a day and make sure to loot all the golf outfits as they sell for 25 caps a pop.  
---
Get a hazmat suit.  If you see a nuke zone go to it and follow a player there and tag everything, you will level like crazy. 
---
Don’t hold onto stuff you think you may use, just drop/sell it.  
---
Check the vendors for rare plans and mods every time you visit one which should be 7 times a day. 
---
Oh that power armor station tho 
---
Which platform is that btw?
---
 I guess its the same for all of them though would be strange if it was different for each i guess, although at this point nothing Bethesda are doing surprises me lol
---
I keep going through mine and deleting the crappy ones so only up to about 15 at the moment, been collecting the frames though and was planning on a photo trip at some point as its a nice feature. Shame its been limited for whatever reason like that :(
---
The Harper's ferry vendor can carry excavator mods and he has the largest inventory of mods so there's a good chance he'll have them. Fully modded out some excavator armor through him.
---
Every single one of these is lore breaking but the moth man one
---
I used to have a drivelink device for the 360 to transfer files to my PC, idk if one exists on the xbone, but if you can think of it, China makes it.
---
I can on xb1
---
Don't forget now you can have a perk maxed then still get more of the same perk cards. I am that way with several perks I am maxed. 
---
PC
---
I wish I was this creative. I’ve tried. 
---
Whenever the mood strikes! Currently I've found a lovely unmarked lake in the southern Savage Divide, replete with bloodleaf and the occasional stag.
---
I usually just pop-up wherever I find a neat-looking spot. I use tents on simple foundations, so all I need is a small amount of space and I'm good. 
---
They aren't called "Mothers little helpers" for nothing.
---
The other day I was in WSR and I was like "holy shit a mutant!" Then saw Chally
---
I’m pretty sure I have a few k of them, trade for some .556?
---
It seems to me the higher level you get, the bigger your area is to build, and the higher your budget goes. Could be wrong though, His house was pretty empty, and theres a lot of open space in his whole area.
---
I can on ps4
---
I want to have one that’s a melee and pistol to go with my rifles and shotgun main. 
---
Low level play is *energetic* without legendary weapons. With my main on crafted weapons it’s farming. On the low level it’s survival. 
---
You still there? 
---
Be careful!
---
Some dude posted earlier that he'd been scammed because someone asked to borrow his TSE shotty then tried to sell it back to him for 50k (yeah he was silly enough to trust this random person he'd just met in the wasteland and let him have it for whatever reason).
---
Hopefully your luckier :)
---
i managed to find my two-shot exploding shotgun, and have no interest in duping it.
---
i normally switch between that and my grognak axe.
---
i don't mind using melee if other people want to tag mobs, but at the same time, if i'm getting within melee range, i'm going to be the one taking the damage, so tag your mobs quickly. i don't want to be kiting around for a minute because you can't hit them.
---
Is he still there? I’ve grown curious and wanna see what all he sells
---
I got too used to the whole "it's an event, we're all on the same team" thing (is that a thing? It feels like it's a thing) and was too freely spamming my Tesla rifle around random players in Harper's Ferry, thinking I'm being nice by not one-shotting everything... Let's SHARE the XP And loot, my random stranger buds!  
---
Whoops. Did a little damage to a level 118 guy (I was L99 or so at the time). I pause... I lower my weapon. He pauses, then spams me with the explosive combat shotty.  :(   
---
Ouch.   
---
Ok, fair enough, maybe my bad. I go to retrieve my bag, he hasn't looted it, I think we're good... NOPE.   
---
Spams me with his boomstick again... Frag me once, shame on me...   
---
So I re-spawn AGAIN, on the east side of the river, watch him kite some Mutants into his (below bridge level, sneaky) camp turrets, and then engage with MY favorite new toy from about 340 yards from within the dark of the Trees...   
---
It's a silly gun really. A shiny, over-repaired, genuine, non-duped, randomly dropped **Two Shot Explosive DRAGON** with max rifleman, max tank killer and a "conservative" 4 ranks of demolition expert.  The screen says I do 2140 per shot. I believe the screen... No further overtures we're made. I don't believe he even could tell where the shot came from. I really should turn on that pacifist mode. ;)
---
Thank you for the heads up my friend!
---
+karma
---
How much stuff do you need transferred? 
---
I’m 57 and still no class freak card :(
---
You can copy as may pngs (from anywhere, not even in-game) into the folder and it'll show them.
---
Right about what? Serums are 3k+ unless you are a cheating/duping piece of shit cheater.
---
How much we talking I'll go farm mats and make you some 5.56
---
So perfect
---
Instead of 0 points, let us set up a favorites for perks, so all we have to do is select fave 1 for main whatever you are, fave 2 to swap out for situational cards or different play style, and have like maybe a max of 4 or even do the wheel like on the faves menu. At least then we wouldn't have to go from attribute to attribute to swap out. 
---
He got out of his nuka cola suit, and I put down my american suit, so he 3-upped me and threw down the rest of his suits.
---
They're lying to you, plain and simple.
---
Bethesda will tell you to talk to who you bought it from. And that retailer has a no return policy that you agreed to.
---
Anyways, giver man. Its your money in the end.
---
Before I stopped playing at lvl 60 something I donated all my stimpacks, radaways, and ammo to a couple of lower lvls. Despite my boredom of the game I really hope I was able to help someone enjoy the game slightly more than I was. I doubt I'll be returning though
---
I dont get why they'd add a horizontal but not a vertical half wall. Rip
---
Cool, so if something is pretty bad that enough people agree on something it automatically turns into \~\~canned ham talking-point-shitting trolls\~\~. And I wasn't even trolling, I even went as far as to say I didn't think Fallout 4 was even a terrible game. Nor did I even criticize you for liking it. I was just saying Bethesda is far from perfect and I wouldn't trust them to not fuck something up. I feel like that's a pretty fair opinion. 
---
How did you change the pipboy light?
---
Defo need a way to report bugs in game!
---
Kinda weird that Bethesda didn't bother putting that in the game to be honest and does make me wonder why :/
---
I now know what I'm saving my first nuke launch for.
---
But he simply placed them he didn't drop them I imagine?
---
All my mats and meds from one character to another haha 😅
---
Thanks, tried that but it CTD on me anyway.  Had to rebuild half my base up manually (including the decon arch) then use the repair all to fix up the rest.  Turns out if your house uses up most of your budget or is rather densely detailed, the game crashes on you if you try to move / place / repair all of it at the same time.
---
Not gonna lie my pic would be a shot of the guy’s CAMP that had “Eat My Ass” in neon letters.
---
Whoa, thanks man. I didn't know that even with all the perks unarmored didn't stack up to Power Armor. That doesn't make much sense in a game balance perspective, but I guess from a story point of view it definitely makes sense that power armor is way better than without
---
Yep
---
Coolio
---
Bean is the bunk mate you always wanted in Vault 76.
---
I agree with OP totally. I understand complaining that lowbies make the SBQ harder and to not want them there, but to not want them at Whitespring?! That’s absurd. 
---
For one, it’s kind of the perfect spot for lowbies to get their feet wet with nuke zones because of the robots and the fact that you can retreat easily. Especially if people dont want them at other nuke zones. 
---
And even disregarding nukes completely, people only say they don’t want lowbies there because of the high incidence of legendaries. So, what, should every farmable place be unacceptable for lowbies to be in? What if next week we find out that Flatwoods has become a great place to farm legendaries suddenly?  Should lowbies not be allowed there? Maybe we should just not allow new people join ever and the whole map can be reserved for people only above -insert arbitrary number.- 
---
To be honest, those lowbies who are fighting through Whitespring are the people you want in the game. I remember my first time being mobbed by level 50 and 60 ghouls there. I told myself I was never going to explore around there ever again. It was way too hard and I kept dying. Those people at Whitespring are actively trying to improve their character and level up. Maybe they started later than other people and are now playing catch up. Today’s lowbie is tomorrow’s ally . But it isn’t hurting anyone. I would even argue that it makes it easier to farm legendaries, as they cause enemies to respawn and well, the more people there, the more likely there’s going to be sweet paper bags full of abandoned legendaries just laying around for anyone to go through. 
---
This has to do with a real life argument over toilet paper orientation.
---
Try logging in and out of the server, both of you. 
---
No, I'm a ps4 fanboy through and through. 
---
Not that i have anything against XB, the OG Xbox was a powerhouse.

I made my choice based solely on exclusives! 
---
Me and my friends found a swastika with a sign that said no nwords allowed.  So we posed and took a pic with it 
---
All I find are meat piles at the compass locations, this place is a miners hell hole a laggy mess and I'm ignoring it from now on.
---
Best way is to open the Photo in Fallout 76, hit the menu button and then just screenshot it over and over again. 
---
I can help with that, bluejelly101
---
Yeah. He's cool, but not as cool as sharing a laugh with your kid. 
---
My dad was a gamer back in the 80s, and we used to laugh and laugh at Pitfall (mostly him dying in game). 
---
My dad left this world several years ago but your share reminded me of a good time. So thanks.
---
Xbox. 
---
Added you
---
I can't believe ppl swap out hacking and lock pick. 
---
Early game i just left them on. Late game they're useless
---
Serums can be crafted. I bought the last three I needed for 750 each. The seller crafted them right infront of me.
---
I didn't realize he was this popular!
---
1. Two Handed Melee Weapon of Choice
---
2. Bloodied: +DMG at -Health or Executioner's: +50% DMG when enemy is at 40% Health
---
3. Power Swing DMG +40%
---
4. 40% Less DMG During Power Swing
---
If a bunch of dumbasses say a thing that isn't true, that doesn't magically make it true by repetition. Nobody has offered a significant critique of the "story and dialogue" rather than just making that claim and then hooting and throwing shit when challenged.
---
It’s painful really. 
---
Yeah, that would work, but Bethesda will certainly not put in that much money to build another world and release it as free DLC.
---
The simulation isn't taking place in WV, but in china, so that would be a hughe endeavour for Beth, maybe even Fallout 5 or its Spin-Off title material.
---
I’d probably join that little... Enclave 
---
Had the 25th here.
---
Nothing for Uncanny Caverns spawning a Night Kid?
---
If the event was recently done by someone else it has a cooldown before it can trigger again. You'll need to wait (idk how long) or swap servers. 
---

---
Do you have Disc? So we can voice to pic a place and for when I switch
---
I bought that lol!
---
I'm not duping and I charge 500 because I can just craft them all and they are cheap to make so that statement is incorrect.
---
Do you still have it?
---
I was terrified the whole time I tried soloing a nuke launch once. Didn't want to get ready to fire only to have it crash or disconnect. Actually made playing more stressful.
---
This isn't the bazaar, so I'm gonna give some advice. Yellow cake can come from Raydohedron, which is ALL around a nuked golf club. You could make two or three just from making a circle around the building
---
So all pictures are saved to my xbone drive?
---
the only mods that come close to what legendary rolls give are SOME of the chest piece mods like Emergency Protocolls (cant stand up though with Assassins, Sentinels etc because of how limited it is)
---
what else can we do... fly for 5 seconds? nice..
---
I'd cosign this.  My tree house in Fo4 Sanctuary is the bee's pj's and I love it.  Unfortunately, it's not nearly as cool as the Treetop Village.
---
If you've completed the whole quest line you have the title of "Mother of Mysteries" so they always call you mother 
---
I also had to go to Whitespring as part of the Order of Mysteries quest to grab a sword.  Level 22. Take a hike, grumps! 
---
I doubt everyone explored every corner of the map or even seen the Flatwoods monster for example. The pinnacle of everyone's gameplay is Whitesprings. No Whitesprings = running around other places. Hopefully more places.
---
And yes, if that's the real endgame and players really can't find anything else, they're better off playing other games where they at least don't have to run around the same area for a low chance to get some reward. Oh yay I got a two shot gatling gun! Now I can kill these ghouls even aster and maybe I'll get two shot explosive gatling gun! After I get that maybe I can get two shot explosive blackpowder plasma  bloodied VATS ehanced gatling gun to my run even shorter!
---
Do people even read notes and terminals in this game?
---
Lol
---
Turrets are the mortal enemy of melee players... especially when they shoot those incendiary rounds.  One of the reasons that the Deliverer pistol in Fallout 4 was so useful - moderate damage and low AP cost made it perfect for taking out turrets with VATS.
---
BryndenRivers#0628
---
Or turn make them attack the bots to clear the area.
---
I'd look for them first on your xbox before you go deleting.  I realized they ALL saved because even pics that I messed up and deleted later on were still on the ps4 drive.
---
Do you still have the cryolator plan?
---
Watching that youtube video filled me with unbridled giggles, thank you.
---
Bethesda announced that the cool down for events was increased to 1 hr and 15 minutes (previous cool down timer was 45 mins). This was in the last December patch notes. 
---
So assuming you complete it you will need to wait that long before it spawns again. 
---
Dont save stuff for later levels unless its a really good legendary. Youll find more guns later on. 
---
Scrap the spare weapons and armor you find instead of ignoring them. If in an area with alot of enemies, kill then all then go back and loot them and waddle your overencumbered self to a workbench
---
Carry a few grilled radstag or ribeye steaks. Carry weight boosters. 
---
Also, dont keep lockpick/hacking/crafting perks active just because you use them sometimes. Swap em when you need them. 
---
I did say excavator armor in the first post.
---
Aaand I said 500, not 200.
---
Aaaaaand I did say I didn't put on chemist and don't have super duper.
---
Aaaaaaaand a number of ores were bugged on the wall, so, I did my best.
---
Thanks for the info though.
---
Yeah I agree
---
I am aware of the real life argument. I am also aware of players in Fallout 4 complaining about it being "wrong" (with the argument as a basis) and lots of memes about it that eventually made the mod that flipped them a thing. I'm sure it was a little of both that had the studio make it a thing.
---
What platform is this an issue on? Nobody on Xbox cares about the level, but they also don't like to share. Just curious
---
Not OP but thanks for the info 
---
Damn you're probably banned already. Don't log out or that's it
---
Anyone who wants to can add me.  I'm currently at level 29, my PSN is czirok
---
2 shot or no?
---
Xbox or ps4?
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
I have a tse Gatling what’s your offer 
---
Inbox me
---
It's always a world safe. Inner cells are hit or miss, though it happens. The last 6 or 7 times I've been to Watoga High School, the wall safe was locked but completely empty. 
---
Yeah see when the game was in BETA I had the long duster coat and cowboy hat, I was carrying around a pipe/club or some sort of melee weapon I don't remember now..and I was just open mic and I was running around beating on ghouls and mutants, screaming STOP RESISTING STOP RESISTING!  fun times :)
---
1500 caps?
---
We leave gobs of .38 rounds in mailboxes, 1k at a time lol
---
White spring should be off limits to Nukes.
---
Failing that, Nuke Zones should be their own server.
---
No 2 shot but you didn't say TSE, my b. Should hit up a discord for one, they get sold a lot
---
i've never seen one land. Just spam attack from above...
---
Thank you,if you comment I can give karma also
---
It doesn’t matter I was just wondering
---
Ah! I know this camp! I met him just after Christmas when I had just started. Spent a bunch of time checking out his build, it's a lovely complex. :)
---
Bloody hell.
---
"Reading" is not endgame content.
---
Just stop. Please. 
---
T-60 Hydraulic Left Arm, and Motion-Assisted Torso...  going to experiment a bit to see if it has anything to do with modded pieces or just random.
---
I am not finished yet, but I knew I was destined for greatness.
---
If you have NVIDIA GeForce experience and a decent PC, GeForce experience for some reason sets your resolution automatically to 2715x1527 in my case for example, good ol’ auto NVIDIA optimisation... just go into the settings for the game in GeForce experience and manually change it.
---
Do the serums or the ingredients expire in your inventory?
---
Yeah and can they be compressed into one perk card? It’s so much more tedious to switch 3 in and out. 
---
I'm definitely copying you 😁
---
&gt; Do nuke launches affect interior cells?
---
Tbh TSE's would cost a lot more. This is just a Junkie's
---
I got mine from Harpers Ferry. Did a lot of server hopping. The last one I Got when I wasn't server hopping and just randomly went to check it out one day.
---
I pretty much never lock pick unless it requires rank 0. The rewards are never that good and I would rather just skip it then spending time to swap in multiple ranks of lockpick and then swap them back out. 
---
Sorry if I spoiled that one for you then lol figured it would explain it though :)
---
Rip
---
Are they installed on the same drive if you have an SSD?  You gotta craft the tricentennial items also.

I found #5 ash heap near Charleston trainyard

Oh damn turns out it's a Light Machine Gun, sorry. Would you want one of those?

1500 caps

I just dropped off 17 lbs of plans and recipes in the overseers camp.
---
Or...you could just go to a server where the workshop isn't taken you f-ing prick!
---
I saw a guy who had literally one foundation, a stair, then a bunch of foundations (probably 5x5 or something similar) of turrets, physically lagged my game, it was horrible, I can post a link if someone wants to see it. (I don't want to do it if no one wants to see it!)
---
Well there’s 2 others I’ve found but one is unuseable and the other only makes it heavier (heavy barrel says it increases damage and range, increases range just like long barrel but doesn’t increase damage)
---
There is truth to that in pretty much every situation.  Enemies really can't focus on more than one player at a time.  One Colonel Gutsy is a handful for me if it sees me first and trains all of its shots on me.
---
There’s another in the basement of one of the grand houses on the river to the southwest of whitespring. That’s how I started the quest. 
---
Seriously. A rapidly mutated creature of this size would need to land often if it wasn't gliding.
---
And seeing as they are pretty much recycled dragons from Skyrim, why not have them perch on large objects like the dragons did? It'd provide more chances for them to land AND make for a more dynamic battle. 
---
Copy away!  It's a lovely spot.  The mirelurks are especially fond of it!
---
These are all really nice ideas hope someone in Beth saves this for reference 
---
You're spot on!  Those are the dark wood floors from the Atom Store.
---
I’m loving this quest. Favorite one thus far. 
---
Gotta say if its PC, xbox or psn
---
Oh, cool!  I love feedback.
---
Awesome, I'll check after work!
---
A friend and I will be doing "I am become death" and we are planning on summoning the queen twice if we can. Not exactly sure when but my tag is thatredbeanie
---
Have you seen Finding Nemo? Your comment has made me imagine you as the stingray teacher when they have the field trip. 😆 Singing a song as you show people around!
---
Thanks. So I'm starting to farm them to sell, I should craft them ASAP.
---
I don't see how this could be an error. Textures don't just magically turn into images of text.
---
Neither expire. You need pure flux though, the ingredients for which (raw flux), can inspire.
---
Yes
---
1 - I is a pvp zone - do not be there if you don't want to pvp
---
2 - I did not even want it.  I was just irked he taunted me so I taught him lesson.

Charleston FD has a corpse in the garage by the fire trucks.
---
Tygart Water Treatment also has one outside near the fence.
---
AVR medical also has a corpse outside by the trash.
---
So for one, TSE weapons are not OP. They are good yes, but melee STILL outclasses them with ease. Next, in your second paragraph you said there is absolutely no way to defend against explosives. However, there is explosive resistant mods for armor, and also chems/magazines that reduce explosive damage taken. I've also killed plenty of people with tse and been killed by tse. Not everything is always a one shot. 
---
Lastly, I do agree that pvp should be rebalance and changed for the new mode.
---
It would be good if when someone enters a workshop area they are automatically flagged for pvp. They have 10 seconds to leave or choose to disable pvp which means they can't claim the workshop for a period of time. And they have to leave and renter the area if they want to claim it. That would allow a defender to actually defend the workshop from an attacker rather than be taken by surprise when they just claim it and open fire from a position of virtual invulnerability. It would also allow people to come to the workshop as a friendly and help defend it from mobs and complete the event if they choose to, without then turning around and claiming it and getting the first shot having complete control of the situation.
---
If it is still going on Im in. My gt is my username.
---
Had the ammo factory. Had a sound bug had to reload. A couple high levels showed up. They had mics so I offered to give all my workshops to them. To bad they started contesting first. Just hopped servers.
---
If I can't keep my fish lamp when we exit the simulation, ima riot. RIOT!
---
No no. 200 ore not scrap
---
I want my minute and 48 seconds back.
---
I like doing that with the sentry bot 
---
That is fair. If the game can handle it. 
---
From the other side: PvPers dont know if you are willing to pvp at a workshop or camp. 
---
Funny enough someone just came to my buddys camp and wrecked us and destroyed my buddys whole base. Few minutes ago. Costed us a whole 50 wood, 30 rubber, 12 steel and 14 screws and 5 or less of a bunch of junkto repair. Dude wagered a 400+ Cap bounty. Thats fair. Point is base damage is more fun when you take it less serious. The base smasher has slightly more to lose. Its a balanced better than most things in this game. You can even get around paying the building cost all together by storing then placing, but it takes a bit of time.
---
Slap damage is full of problems too. 
---
Didn't you literally just say Bethesda is good because a whole lot of people like Elder Scrolls? Not that I disagree, but you can't say that and then call me out on using similar logic. 
---
I hate mole people! All that grunting
---
I was still carrying my already read recipes, terrified I would somehow unlearn them if I got rid of them. My upper level buddy set me straight as he spent several minutes cleaning up my cluttered inventory lol.  
---
A recommendation: 15 perception for rifleman perks, tank destroyer, and concentrated fire. 11 Agility for the sneaking and AP, 5 intel for the gunsmith, and other utility cards, 4 charisma for maxed out lone wanderer (and swapping in and out hard bargain), and distribute the rest however. Ensure you have enough luck for starched genes and class freak and bloody mess.
---
Where is this?
---
Cranberry bod right behind the vendor station. I put it there since that is my main vendor station and if anyone launches a nuke on prime it isn’t that fire to get too.
---
What a horrible thought!
---
I always wonder when I see a level 2 player or something at top of the world or some other weird place. Like how is it even possible? Did they just run straight there from the vault and not do anything? I just hit 40 this week and am just now starting to explore anything really East of the divide.
---
I'm on right now on PC
---
Strange...
---
I know I'm a set of T-45 short and it isn't in either inventory so not sure what happened there then
---
I think we're on to something.
---
Maybe the best solution is to ban TSE guns from PVP servers? I have no real intentions on playing PVP as this has never been a PVP game for me. I dont want to see the guns I have worked and traded for suddenly get nerfed to the point that they cant kill a radroach in a solo session. I agree the PVP aspect needs balanced but a full on nerf of the power houses is not the answer as it would ruin the solo and squad non-PVP aspect of the game. 
---
Counter offer?
---
Forewarning in my experience its very lack luster. Been there 5 or 6 times and only half the time was there even one deathclaw. I was hoping for a big island full of them. The guy who took me there said he seen 3 at once so your milage may vary  
---
Oh haha sorry im only level 12
---
5k caps ?
---
A couple of people mentioned the ripper and power drill gaining damage from it
---
No rationalization is going to change the fact that you brag about being a douchebag.
---
It sounds like weird sex noises from people who are drowning
---
Finally we have reached consensus, brother
---
Prime real estate when player vendors come to fruition. 
---
You can have one food and one beverage active.  They are separate items.
---
Todd bless you, heathen.
---
I don't think a rebalance for this is even really necessary because no one intentionally walks around with non-combat perks murdering stuff. 
---
Those aren't pillows.
---
This sounds a little off to me. I timed the final launch prep at 7 minutes and you can’t speed that up. I don’t see how you can do the other three sections and the beginning in 3 minutes.
---
I found the scaling to be pretty inconsistent
---
Today i got to the Top Of The World and at the 2nd floor it was full of level 10-15 (i'm level 22) Scorched i cleared the area and went down, but then not even 2 minutes later i went back because i remembered that i wanted to take a picture and all of a sudden it was filled with level 50-60 Scorched, there was no other player (higher or lower level) anywhere near me on the map
---
Sell diluted, max Makeshit and Gunsmith out, vendors are my friends
---
This is like reading one of those replies to questions on Amazon products where people simply answer "I don't know".
---
I love them. They have cool lore, great loot, and they spawn in predictable areas.
---
Sentinel armor. If you're serious about pvp you have a set of it preferably with Assassins.  The only chance you have to die is on stagger or if caught in movement.  
---
Ok i have done more testing and found out that without any perks this still happens...kinda.
---
So this happens both in and out of PA as well, BUT in diferent ways. See, in PA, the TS gatling has lower listed damage when not equiped, but higher when equiped (132 vs 221). But! If i am not in PA, it is lower when equipped, but higher when not equiped (221 VS  331).
---
Meanwhile, while the explosive one shows lower damage while equipped vs when unequiped (160 vs 266), it shows higher damage while equipped vs when not equipped (399 vs 266).
---
Those numbers are with my perk loadout, however the exact same thing happens when i have none equiped.
---
What is even stranger is that the TS gatling only shows a lower damage when unequiped if i ever at any point equip the explo gatling, never if i equip something else (that i know of) though for all the other situations it happens regardless.
---
This is extremely weird, and i've tested this with any amount of various damage perks which i have access to and the same always happens reliably.
---
This happens to me too, three times tonight already. Does anyone know why?
---
haha that’s awesome, i met .bean like 3 weeks ago and set them up with a fusion generator. they’ve been working on that camp for a long time! this is awesome
---
Did it take three tries to complete the whole thing?
---
I think they said they would start by raising it to 600lbs to ensure it wouldn’t mess up the game.  That said, given the amount of server drops lately, they might be reluctant to raise it again.  Of course, the server drops could be tied to other things like duping.
---
Nah, it's completely random. Pretty easy to farm if you know where to go. 
---
I get it. I’m about ready to snap my disc in half. If I didn’t feel even more like I’d be throwing $60 away by doing it, I would. 
---
That’s low , like very Low 
---
Lol at your description.  You swing your weapon 4 times and kill him before he attacks you.
---
I’d take like 3000 lowest 
---
Jokes on you, you gotta purchase the fixes through the atomic shop. 
---
I usually leave on 1-2 pts and in the rare instance I run into a lvl 3, swap in a card. 
---
Now kiss.
---
Completing Fallout 4's Nuka World DLC added this as a way of continuing the story after uniting the raider clans.
---
I don't think it's bugged, but it's not great either. I would have to spam the use key to get it to register too. Not too hard on the kb/m though.
---
Your life still has an impact after death.  Your legacy makes you immortal.
---
Super useful to know that! Thanks a bunch mate.

HATE TODD HOWARD

I have had this exact situation happen to me at Spruce Knob workshop. Totally agree that this sort of event should NEVER happen, unless (maybe) a full 4 man squad is present. Even then would still be gross.
---
How is Chally the Moo-moo?
---
When will these PVP servers be coming out? Sorry, I haven't been keeping up with the hype lately.
---
I’ve done it a couple times, no issues for me... PC
---
Still i feel it's randomness may be influenced, just a wierd coincidence probably 
---
Haha, gather round everyone. Let's name the zones, let's name the zones. The zones of the wasteland!!!
---
I can give you hand on PC if you want. Have Discord as well. Lemme know. PM if you want Discord name.
---
It's literally not registering me hitting the buttons it wants nor when I run over where it wants.  I've *stood* on top of the spots it wants and it will just sit there and tell me to go back. 
---
I just switched servers and it said I had literally 0 quests at all for about 45 seconds before 8 switched yet again and now I'm trying again
---
its down for me ps4
---
Wasn't a brag.  I stated a fact and gave advice to prevent it from others.  Reading through your post history though reveals a bullheaded offensive attitude, so given there can be no reasoning with you I shall not bother.  
---
My CAMP is set up over a junk extractor near there, and I go spawn one in every time I log in. I've never seen any more than the one that spawns from the nest. It's level 21 every time.
---
Hmm. Just got the 5 minute countdown on the server \[PC\] I was on and left 90 seconds early.  
---
So no maintenance, or only on that server - or, meh - whatever.  
---
Thank you for replying though.  
---
I would love to have this option again, I want my character to be mine in every way 
---
I saw a mutie running down the road today, and saw what I thought was Chally behind him. It wasn't until he started shooting that I realized it wasn't Grahm and the "brahmin" was actually two more Super Mutants. :-( I put them down but man it was hairy for a minute!
---
I'd like to get to know you better...
---
I'm online now
---
It's their roundabout way of level locking lockpick. They don't have a system to prevent you upgrading a card if you're not a high enough level, but they can prevent you getting it if it's a higher level card. 
---
I have 8 Luck and the weapon repair perk works all the time for me. I basically have not had to repair anything since I've had the perk, with the exception of stuff that was really poor when I found it.
---
Also have lvl 4 Gunsmith going though, so maybe that's how it breaks even.
---
Oh, ok. How do you know they expire? I have 8 or so in my inventory right now.
---
Servers having connectivity issues 
---
I love it, but on a real note what stops the power armor from recalling itself?
---
Don't think so man. I feel like I have a pretty good understanding as I farmed very specific mutation builds and probably spent close to 10-12 hours doing it.
---
I saw a video a few days ago with a great spot. If I find the video I’ll post a link here!

Gratz on being a cheating piece of shit cunt n00b whore.

[You can fix that, works the same way as in Vegas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpKQHpMGMNQ)
---
There a yellow slicker hat. 
---
When the codes reset the pieces just disappear
---
There is also an option of making the PVP servers a sort of battle royale. Maybe make it so the characters level and what not can go up but the items that can be used must be found during that session. Could create some interesting battles in areas that are known for producing legendary enemies. 
---
Either way my vote is not to start nerfing things for the sake of the PVP servers as it would crush the core component of the Fallout franchise which is solo story driven gameplay. Yes the story here is locked away in holotapes and computer files, can be share with friends, and has PVP aspects at launch but it is still a player versus AI game. 
---
Yeah. I hate it but I'm going to just shrug and move 2 points of INT to Luck, which will have both stats at 8. That way when I'm actively playing, I'll run Gunsmith 5 and Power User 3. Hopefully I'll not need to slot more than 8 points of cards when crafting offline, for INT. Then on LUCK I'll run Bloody Mess 3, Starched Genes 2, and Class Freak 3. But at any time I simply don't want to run Class Freak (i.e. when I'm not crafting) then I can use some of my alternate cards I have like Luck of the Draw or Tormentor or whatever.
---
Maybe they should think about fixing PvP before they worry about PvP events.
---
I think if you lower the spawn rate a bit and increase it for other locations. Best would be if the nuke zones had similar spawns regardless of where they nuked. So nuke zone for fissure prime, nuke zone for fissure 1, nuke zone fissure 2, nuke zone the forest, nuke zone the Mire, and so on. I think though it is a technical limitation so it won't be a quick fix.
---
Maybe once the vaults open up higher level playera will start going there instead?
---
the one skin i was waiting for, YAS, now i just need a matching heavy weapons skin...
---
Yeah this was some bullshit.
---
Thank you. Maybe more replies will give a clearer picture to what is going on.
---
Happened to me too. It vanished. Ugh 
---
Eh. PvP is good enough right now. But I don’t see enough of true PvP. When both sides want to fight for something 
---
Well ill try to keep looking into it since im trying to farm myself
---
I don’t have a terminal, so I can’t control them beyond just on or off, but a couple of times when I’ve taken over the Gorge Junkyard I’ve built a sort of punishment shack with the electric chair in the middle and six of the speakers (each of a different type) around the perimeter of the room. It’s got an ominous sound to it all together like that, I love it.
---
I found one of those today and thought it was a UFO. I was very disappointed

Skyrim music goes great over just about anything.

She was doin good, just moosying along. Think she lost some weight since I saw her last
---
This is one case where a comma makes a world of difference.
---
It's definitely unusual, but I kinda like the randomness. Not being able to pick what you get. It's not something you usually see and mirrors RL a bit more than is typical. 
---
As for cards from the Atom Store.. you might be right there, but I'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt there. They have used cards before in Fallout Shelter, so perhaps that's where the inspiration came from that.  Hopefully. Maybe.  
---
So this mission is bugged and the quest marker never appears where you need to go. Go back to the entrance. Down the first flight of stairs, take your immediate right. Second door on your left will have 4 terminals. 3 are broken, the last one in the back corner works. You'll need to go through all the menus and the insert the blank tape to download the information. 
---
Make sure you pick up a blank tape and go through the terminal next to the blanks first.
---
I had this issue too. Load the Siphon holotape in one of the terminals in sugar grove control room, that should work properly, now unload the siphon holotape and try to load it into that research terminal again. It should work, at least it did for me.
---
I encountered Mr Handy and named Mr Veterinarian with 3 cats following him

Far harbor?

They are saying later this month but no fine details as to what it all entailes. Speculation, as seen here, is that there will be separate servers but I do not believe anyone knows for certain. That is, unless there is info released that I have not seen. 
---
What got you that you need high ground. I know a place with lots of water and have never seen anything but a couple critters that don't attack

Not having this feature is preventing me from starting another character. Doesn't even need to be an app, simply having an in-game shared stash between my characters would be enough. Elder Scrolls Online has it, so why can't Fallout 76?

Check out the area around the monorail elevator.  There's water and junk deposits, all with views overlooking the asylum.
---
Shit me too! I went there to retrieve a sword. I think I’m like level 22 or 23. I just couldn’t handle all the ghouls in the area. I think they were above level 50. I wonder if higher level players were the reason why they were so high, but it’s put me off going back for a while. That’s one of the places I really want to explore too.
---
As suggested elsewhere in this thread, there should just be two separate categories of perks. Something like passive and combat. You have two  sets of perks for each category, so you'd need enough special to get whatever card, but you don't constantly have to unequip and reequip it. 
---
Peopel dont deal with random encounter as much because everyone fast travels. Lol

How much flux and what type. I just farmed a nuke zone and got a bunch
---
I’m ok right on Xbox seems fine

On PC here, no sign of a shutdown.

Its not cheating to learn the recipes and then sell at a reasonable price. That was all unnecessary and you have been reported. Notice how all you git was downvotes.

Bethesda hasn't put a date on it yet but from their [inside the vault](https://bethesda.net/en/article/5te3GDsV1eOM2YOKoyWoI6/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-1-2019) post it might be coming out sometime mid-late January. Maybe.
---
Reason I asked is it took me three tires for the same bag you are dealing with. Then the same thing happened to a buddy of mine. 
---
Right. I have a second character only used to farm handmade plans for buddies and to hold items I hope to sell but never will as they aren't TSE but I digress...
---
Even a separate menu at the start screen to move/view inventory would work. 
---
They really need to reduce the drop chance on these. My main is sitting around with 60 of them.

I mean they've mentioned a new PvP mode in an upcoming update so it seems their opinion May differ.
---
Don’t hold your breath; we don’t even have access to all the building pieces from Fallout 4. Not nearly. 
---
Are those saved?
---
You have to spend level ups till yuh meet the requirements.
---
Or make people want to use them. Probably should do both
---
I have around 100, maybe closer to 200.
---
My suggestion would be an upgrade system per 10 Requisitions. You can combine up to 50 to get max tier items, like 3 star legendaries. The more you combine, the better consumables or amounts of consumables will be added. Also per combining, the higher tier Requisition will spawn tougher enemies that swarm the drop zone, like 3 waves you must kill before the supply drop opens, like the Kovac Muldoon supply drops. Maybe even add them as an upgrade too. I won't get anything good really from all of my Requisitions, so basically useless at my level. With my idea, they become valuable,  like a currency. Combine this with OP's idea, and remove bounties from this type of event.
---
Oh yea sorry xbox
---
Yeah I had the same thing happen to my spare PA. You shouldn’t be able to insert non quests items into it but obviously that isn’t the case 
---
thanks i’d appreciate that 
---
How many points do you have saved up? You can't "bank" points to use on higher level perks. Let's say you unlocked a perk at level 50, and at level 50 you had 3 points. You would have to use the first 2 points before it showed that new perk
---
I've been there once.   Only found a level 21 legendary deathclaw (I'm only level 32). 
---
Sorry :(
---
Ive only found 2 TS weapons so far. Im grinding my ass off to get the explosive effects. I seriously hate the dickheads just abusing it. 
---
It probably works the same with those speakers as it does for the colored lights. Simply hook up a terminal to a power source, then connect a wire from the terminal to the light you want to modify. Make your changes. The settings for that light will save until changed. Connecting it to a power source will use the settings you put on that light, even if that light isn't connected to a terminal. Simply edit each and every light individually or in sets.
---
I know people have managed to make songs or short tunes with those speakers, but I have no earthly idea how.
---
They have been up for a few days. Check nukacrypt
---
Literally just got done picking up my handmade plans on my 2nd character 2 days ago. Alot of people say Harper's Ferry at lvl 15 is the place to be. I tried HF  MANY times and it didn't show. Watoga train station ended up being where I found it. I don't believe they are very common occurrence even there, but I guess it depends on how long you would be willing to hop to find more copies for your buddies. Hope this helps.
---
I have a couple in an unlit corner where my grand piano and jukebox is.  Very nice ambiance.
---
I’m down, what’s it gonna entail though?
---
Mostly every week. Mostly like others, when the mood strikes. Also I love building camps, super love it! When I’m wondering the wasteland, I’m always on the look out for a killer spot.
---
Usually I have some stipulations when building depending on my creative side:
---
- relatively good view
---
- remote from players and the idea they may build there
---
- relatively safe from high level attacks (sometimes I try to make high level work but I get tired of it)
---
- incorporation if newer plans, or props I hadn’t used yet
---
- minimal defense (beating a dead horse meme)
---
- minimal wires (super ugly and damn those conduits are miserable to put together)
---
I don’t mind the the circular boundary we have to build in but I would like to say:
---
- Largest trees need to be removed also
---
- Defense % needs to be lowered (dead horse)
---
- 1/2 size walls and ability to set them halfway in the foundations (same for roofs)
---
- More roof options
---
- some scalable items (the god awfully large fountain, concrete statues...)
---
- a bit of larger budget (dead horse)
---
- usefulness of shelves and such (dead horse)
---
Looks like a nice payday
---
That kind of sounds like a roaming crash course event. But awesome
---
Wreck him. Easy caps
---
It won't make it faster for photo mode still 2 buttons. Just hit M/esc the hit T
---
np but thx
---
So that's how you get a wendigo to wear the clown costume!
---
You can't set up your camp at all on the island. I tried every single inch of it. Also, only one deathclaw spawns when you walk over the one nest.
---
Have to place your camp across the river unless something has changed.
---
have only level one 
---
Thanks!
---
The game does try to reconnect you to the last server
---
Yeah, so many people are quick to bad mouth Bethesda, but at least it seems they are paying attention.
---
They've fixed or attempted to fix several things the community was quite unsatisfied with. 
---
The heavy gun heal no damage bug. 
---
Tried to fix duping. 
---
Power armour stuck fix.
---
Lower atomic shop prices. 
---
Some communication.
---
I mean theyve got some ways to go, but at least it seems they are paying attention.
---
Well, considering you are on PC, just learn to macro until they come to their senses and allow proper keybinding.
---
4 pure yellow cake or 40 raw and 2 pure cobalt or 20 raw 
---
What did you do to unlock the Vim and Silver Shroud posters?
---
It's questionable, but there was a problem with a player not able to tag back and just dying. Watched a 1v3 and the solo guy in power armor couldn't hurt one of the guys in a group that was jumping around with marsupial so he just gave up.
---
They might have fixed this, it has been a while.
---
You look so short though ;)
---
You're right. I copy pasted it from another post i was going to write and forgot to delete that part. Sry. Edited the post.
---
Level 237. He must have that bounty for a reason. I don’t have TSE stuff, so I wouldn’t stand much of a chance against him
---
I’ve got a 8 raw cobalt, 52 raw yellowcake, 2 raw violet, 78 raw fluorescent 
---
I would suggest just looking through more closely then. It should be there 
---
Did he whisper to you to “say your prayers and eat your vitamins, brother” ?
---
I've had one glitch on me at Flatwoods - couldnt kill it and it move from the spot he was at, just sat there occasionally did that.  Got a nice close up pic.  
---
There is also no reason, Fallout lore-wise, for the local legends to be actually real. 
---
And lets not forget the posts on this sub of the "[gitched texture](https://i.redd.it/i7uvl7tyjny11.jpg)".  It only appears in one place.  It's not a bug.  A bugged out texture would not look like that, and it would be repeated wherever that texture was used.
---
Yeah, what do they think textures are?
---
I would shit all over an app that just did that.
---
And i can't really think of much they could add to make it worth my time let alone the time to make a quality mobile app.
---
Maybe even disable the use of legendary weapons to instigate a mostly even playing field. Heck, throw in two more supply drops for more carnage. Each with timers of course, to prevent taking quickly and extend the event.
---
Everyone past level 50 is the same. A bounty that high just means he destroyed a base. The best part of a bounty if everyone is automatically hostile towards him so you'll do full damage on your first shot. Crouching in some bushes or somewhere and picking him off quick is super easy.
---
Yes single servers can go down on their own
---
Downvotes mean nothing, I'm still right and you are still wrong.
---
I just want to ask...isn't two shot damn near useless on shotguns? I was under the impression that two shot added 1 more projectile. In the case of shotguns it only added a single pellet. Am I wrong?
---
And I made mine based on my in-laws who play none of the games I play now. Best to you!
---
If you ask there’s plenty of people in the community who will set you up with basics. 
---
That would be abused.
---
That why everyone disagrees with you and agree with me as shown by the votes 
---
Aww come on. They spent all that effort coming up with Goat Legs, the least you can do is keep it active.
---
poat a Picture pf your hard work mate hours of playing.
---
I do that a lot, but not today - so ot wasn't me
---
I think what you’re looking for is the Yellow Slicker hat—it is sold by a vendor at the whitespring, I believe. More specifically, I am pretty sure it is at Live Chic (the clothing store with the pink assaultron), or perhaps sold by tweed, the other clothing merchant. 
---
Yeah this is awesome also
---
It also seems like their head hit box is a mile wide. 
---
Anyone build in the cave in the north? 
---
Ps4
---
My old house was on a little pond just off a cliff to the east of the Relay Tower at the southeast corner of the map. It's a great spot with a gorgeous view of the Bog and Watoga. It's safe. I rarely had enemies spawn and they werr rarely worse than Scorched or wolves. I did have a Mothman spawn one time. 
---
Aw, come on. Impatience gets the best of us all at times. Someone saved me from this mistake in a similar post. I think that's OP's intent. 
---
Lol - I was thinking the same thing when I looked at todays challenges
---
Thats weird, I got it from the west tek vats and it worked fine. I  get around 80 rads in PA, and 125 or so out of it
---
Yah that ain’t even close to the same thing.
---
Personally I would like to see them try other options first before they do any nerfs. In PVP they are going to be the meta, and it will be very difficult to use anything else. Hopefully they a solution.
---
I know they were plans, and I think I bought them from a vendor.  Can't remember which one though.
---
I have only that one card  
---
I think I need two to rank up
---
I'm a little confused, the term for defecating here is used in a positive context right? Lol
---
I've been running on one fusion core for three days. It's crazy- for the last two weeks I've been paper bagging them by the dozens to make room in my stash and now I can't find any to save my life. 
---
Like the only reason I'm going right now is I finally finished the SB cave mission and I stripped the fusion core outta the power armor you get from that. 
---
Does it come with a quest line to become the Mayor of Flavor town?
---
Thanks! 
---
I was cosplaying as a mirelurk hatchling!
---
Thank you for the tip
---
How I can send a pic if you want 
---
how much you want for the yellow cake?
---
Make me an offer
---
We shall cleanse this wasteland of the factions of the old world to bring the wisdom of the Mothman to the people. Praise be, brother.
---
what is the base damage?
---
Thank you, appreciate you adding your thoughts 
---
200 caps for 40 of the yellow cake?
---
Yeah but not all the time. It occurs randomly for me
---
Class freak is a must tbh. The negatives of mutations are really up there.
---
Luck of the draw is garbage. It doesnt work between 100% and 200% if your weapon is repaired to 200%. So you really only would get 50% (at most, and it’s not that high) extra durability.
---
Like 700 with prime 600 without , that’s with just exploding perks 
---
Plasma grenades, my friend. Plasma grenades. 
---
How so? Kind of annoying I've never seen a enemy my own level. I'm around level 30 an killing level 5-10s almost always.
---
nope. servers don't register the debuff fast enough. sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.
---
The problem is how many of the enemies would be ignored and left for newbies to run into.
---
Ooh, which one?
---
I have seen a few of these since last night. They run up a bounty over 1000, but i watched multiple players with Tse weapons unable to damage them. So be warned that they are in some type of god mode. I'm not sure if it's a new thing or not.
---
Boom boom!
---
Looks pretty cool! Love it
---
Belching Betty really was a turning point for me in the game. Actually finished a decent core mission and visibly ramped up both the difficulty and the level of loot/gear I was getting. The pure desolation and loneliness in the Ash Heap also really hit me. 
---
Looks like I just missed you.

Okay Ill take it can you join my game? D1PD1P

He had military access before being turned into a Wendigo.  Then after losing his mind and becoming a Wendigo, he was free to roam the fort (and anywhere else for that matter), since he was never relieved of the military status.
---
Melee has to be at melee range. Tse wins 9/10. 
---
Right - this server option would only open up for level 50+ players - so that should be avoided.
---
K
---
Okay deal can you join my game D1PD1P
---

Inb4 you have to buy the server stability pack from the Atom Shop
---
I'm an idiot! Thank you!
---
At whitesprings 
---
Oh yea they’re not but I thought you were talking the posing part
---
What are '' TSE Weapons''?
---
Sorry I am new to the game. 
---
Nothing to fear from that situation as they cannot shoot you first for full damage; you have to damage them and then they can hit back to aggro you to finally do full damage against you.
---
To me once you go wanted you should be able to hit anybody for full damage as the person wanted, it’s basically just a nerfed mode with too many down sides to be fun unless you like to be chased by ppl that can 1shot you but that you cannot hit back in kind without jumping thru passive mode hoops first.
---
But I get that they do that to stop the ability for any player to just go killing the whole server and go on a troll spree ruining early players experience.  But wish they had the balls to do that, think there would always be someone to kill the wanted person and keep them in check as remember they can’t see where you are anyway.  
---
The way I was seeing it - it would allow all areas to be level-scaled similarly to the eastern portion of the map - essentially giving high level players more endgame areas to explore at a suitable difficulty rather than just restricting it to that one portion of the map.
---
Two shot explosive
---
Where is this? I would love to do something similar!
---
As for lower levels, I have no issue until they get stupid. T'other day me at 32 a 7 got all up in my face, wouldn't go away. I finally walked past him to the work bench and the bugger started shooting me. I was out of armour and took a shot back then died, my life line was low to start with. It took about 10 min to find him, he went to Vault 76, where I opened up on him with my auto combat shotgun. It was so funny, he was on his knees begging for help with just a touch left on his life bar, I walked over to him and put a shot in the back of his head, took his loot and left. Don't get me wrong, I'm all about helping but some just wanna shoot everything up.
---
I'd join instances with my level 100 buddy and be level 50 before making it to the overseers camp.
---
World of Warcraft had separate servers for pvp and it became an esport. 
---
It just depends if they make it *fun*.
---
I dont typically grief, but I enjoy pvp when it pops up.
---
Damn, I had my eye on the lake reynolds area. good to know though.
---
I don't think you'd want the round if they bought it anyway, and if you do... Then you may not be far from becoming one yourself.
---
Lol - you have OCD too huh?  XD
---
&gt; So for one, TSE weapons are not OP. They are good yes, but melee STILL outclasses them with ease.
---
Are you profiting off RMT or something? Yes TSE is OP. Two explosive bullets will kill anyone and the game conveniently includes an aimbot.
---
I get it, grogbro. I mourned for Black Isle, but then I let it go and moved on.
---
Wait, are those challenges in game? I've been sending Bethesda actual nudes...
---
Todd was so encouraging over text.
---
A bored end gamer going on a spree. Grab a TSE weapon or some plasma nades and go grab the bounty.
---
Especially since they are probably destroying peoples bases so they deserve the justice buddy.
---
my bad I only need 30, so how bout 250?
---
I have an iPhone. I use Bacon Reader to browse reddit on my phone.
---
Guarantee someone will nuke it. 
---
my bad im in a new world now
---
Yeah that’s fine. I won’t be on till tomorrow though
---
If you're on PC I can spot you some bullets.
---
Did they lie anything about when they're going to give us Private Servers? 
---
I've lost a power armor arm to that thing before. But its not the worst thing I've lost to an event bug.  I've wasted god knows how much ammo, stimpaks, and radaway fighting the scorchbeast queen only to have it fly south and off the map, or to have us run out of time because a bunch of low-level/low-DPS are in the AO pumping up her health pool but not contributing to the fight.
---
Imgur is cancer for mobile. I hate it. 
---
Good. 
---
There’s always a post about this about some item a player had unfortunately lost.  
---
Read ahead and just mind other people’s misfortunes, there’s plenty to line the halls of weeping.
---
All are good snacks
---
Yeah, that would be power leveling where you are tagging enemies for your level 100 to kill. An didn't they nerf high level enemy xp?
---
Todd and his toadies say a LOT of things
---
Would lowering server count from 24 to 20 free enough server resources to have unique string id to items?
---
That all sounds well and good but if it's going to be a true PVP mode meaning you won't have the option of getting close to them to initiate. Then melee is going to be at a range disadvantage. I've also seen some TSE guns specifically shotguns having a [listed damage](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76bazaar/comments/acpkts/xb1_h_tse_3_pump_shotgun_w_xo1_jet_pack_and_other/) of 400+. Sure you might survive the first shot if you're lucky, but your lying to me if you tell me that one taps aren't going to be the majority. 
---
I mean I've had 50 cal machine guns and Gauss rifles from them so I tend to use them up 
---
Go melee. I one hit most guys in the golf club with a 1 hander.
---
Nothing gets outside to those bases.
---
Are you referring to having dedicated servers where the enemies start at higher levels?
---
forgot it's level 40 hope your alright with that
---
Just because they think it's fine doesn't make it so.Specially now with everyone running around now with duped 1 shot weapons.Ya...its juuust fine.
---
Yup, number one reason individual letter signs are so expensive to acquire.
---
Yep I've read about and encountered people who cannot be damaged. Apparently stacking assassins armor, lone wanderer, and a few other things makes you godly. 
---
*Takes deep breath* 
---
“THERES......”
---
(Actually I have no idea, I haven’t played 76 yet 😆)
---
I know I'm saying that's how I wanted it to he put in the game. 
---
Yeah dedicated game world instance basically - with the level scaling that is applied to the eastern portions applied to the rest of the map.

Are you triggered we thought it was funny at the time
---
East of Bastion Park, look for the power pylons.
---
Genuinely not sure why you're being downvoted. Nuking Whitespring shouldnt be possible, it's the entrance to both the Enclave bunker and the actual marketplace in the resort. If it's nuked, you can't enter without going out of your way to throw on your hazmat or power armor, as well as having to spawn somewhere and walk to the resort itself. 
---
Now, if inside of the resort was a fast travel point, i'd drop this stance entirely.
---
I see no one being "toxic" there.
---
You know absolutely nothing about what you're talking about

When you level up choose a perk and hit R1 on PS4 a few times or whatever on PC or Xbox to go to the Luck cards and choose the card.
---
Experience earned is also affected slightly by intelligence
---
I need to get a capable melee weapon first, as of right now, my current best is an axe that does 150 perked out in PA. Does extra limb damage, still a 2 shot or better. 
---
desk fans too for screws. toy blocks and some paint also have lead.
---
on that note, in the junk screen in the pip boy, there's a button to "view component", which will just show you the base materials your junk contains. You can tag items for search there, and it's much easier / more reliable than doing it from the crafting screens.
---
What lawsuit they never said it was going to be a glass bottle and I got mine and it is not bad 
---
Oof. He mad.
---
Take the E off TSE Bethesda, problem solved and everybody can go back to Melee4lyfe! 
---
Someone calling others a "whore" without provocation?
---
I know, and its extremely disappointing.. I hope it all makes it in. I just dont like how were all basically limited to around about the same structures. Not enough varying pieces. Plenty of crap to put down, but nothing to fill it with. And not enough budget to build a big enough house to properly utilize all the crap. 
---
TSE should be nerfed and hard.
---
Two-shot is about +80% damage, which dwarfs all the situational prefixes like Ghoul-slayer at 30% and absolutely humiliates all the unconditional increases like mutant's (10% if you're mutated) or anti-armor (which works out to 0-25% more damage).
---
Explosive says it should add 15 explosive damage, but instead it adds ~200 damage to a rifle and ~600 damage to a shotgun. That's not even consistent with the number of bullets / pellets and not even considering explosive related perks. In practice the explosion actually deals even more damage than the paper doll number suggests.
---
I thought you were trolling baha
---
Not the person you were responding to.
---
You're still wrong. Player made serums have always been far cheaper.
---
Pre duping they sold for 1-2k tops, not 100k+ for all of them like you did
---
Running sentinel armor?. If they have the whole set isn't it 90% reduced damage from players. So you would need alot more fire power to knock em.
---
more importantly, you're probably more of a detriment than the level 5 is if you can't pick up even the tiniest amount of slack.
---
That's so fun!
---
That was a good read. I run a serum shop on xbox and sell for 300-500 depending on the market rates. Gave me a chuckle how ignorant he is.
---
You can provide free cow shit as well.
---
It’s a rare defense. Honestly, I’d just leave the server if you’re not above level 50
---
I don't know. We'll have to wait and see.
---
Thanks for the headsup.
---
Are you using a charging tesla rifle? I was crashing all the time and finally figured out the gun mod causes crashes. I went from crashing 2 or 3 times an hour to maybe once every couple of hours.
---
West of the dirt track and vault 76. Small island in the river.
---
Right?
---
Don't look up Surinam Toads, whatever you do.
---
And that's exactly it.  It's in the game so watch out.  Humans are far more tricky than NPC's.  It's the Wasteland not Disneyland.
---
Where r u
---
Nicer experience than I had with a 100+ player at said camp...
---
Stopped by at level 14 to repair some weapons and a 106 level started shooting me in the back as I was crafting... 😟
---
I was able to get out of there pretty quickly, thankfully... 😳 
---
If you have diseases, you should notice that things coming into your melee aura getting a green tinge to them.  It doesn't do a ton of damage much like the other reactive mutations, but it should tick 1% every few seconds if you don't knock them down.
---
I'm all in for this! I'd also like to see a system where you could scrap legendaries. Maybe you could learn that specific mod for that specific gun? Want to add two shot to another handmade? Scrap a two shot handmade and now you could. This would beat selling these items to vendors for a quarter or less of what the value says in weapon description. 
---
Errr wow had more than 24 ppl on their servers.....
---
Triggered?  As in flailing at the keyboard keyboard and pissed off.  No
---
But I definitely wouldn’t have laughed.  It’s kinda sorta really fukd up and in very poor taste if it’s even a joke to begin with.
---
I feel your pain - I broke a dragon, ran out of ammo for my hunting rifle and was down to around 100 .45 ammo on my pipe revolver, but I finally managed to launch by the skin of my teeth.
---
A photomode hotkey would be good
---
I never got stuck in power armor before, but after the most recent patch I did. So I guess that isn't fixed.
---
Dropping it. But of course anyone can pick it up then.
---
Oh this lawfirm sueing Bethesda seems to take up anything the community complains about so i figured they would try sueing Bethesda over the bottle to since it seemed to piss the community off more
---
I remember my first encounter.  I was around level 30-35, at my base in the Savage Divide just south of Top of the World, and decided to search for a river or water source nearby so I could make some juice.  The sun is nearly gone at this point and it gets difficult to see.  I turn on my pipboy nightlight but it doesn't help much.  After a few minutes of walking East from my base (I was convinced there was a riverbed nearby), I hear this weird... Sound.  It sounded like a kind of... Buzzing hiss?  For lack of a better term.  I turn around and see these beady red eyes watching me roughly 30-50ft away.  I had heard of them but intentionally ignored reading details, and decided to try my hand.  I hop in my power armor and take a shot with my combat shotgun, and instantly shit myself as it makes a weird zipping sound a pops right in front of me.  
---
From there it continued to teleport around, and occasionally attacking me with some kind of sonic waves while I whittle down it's health.  Thank goodness I had headphones on; I was only able to beat it by following the sound of it's teleporting.
---
You have lucky break equipped and the icon means that it activated.
---
It means you have the perk card "lucky break" equipped, and it proc-ed.
---
Which means someone shot you and it repaired your armor slightly.
---
PC version
---
When selecting respown point, there is a 50% chance game will freeze and then crash.
---
I found this happens when the targeting point (the cross) still move with mouse after selected an area.
---
Pick up more than 5 weapons with star will slow down the game significantly. sometimes it just crashes.
---
Small chance to crash after fast travel.
---
I'm not using a potato PC. It's i9 with 64 gb mem. Full ssd

That's what pushes me up to one shots.

One spawns at the theme park I assume?

Instanced pvp implies multiple servers' players "meeting" on a pvp server for pvp stuffs.  
---
Yep their servers had tons of ppl on them, but that is a non issue. They also had more players, the game has been out longer, you could loot things, you kill stuff, you do quests. None of this has anything to do with my arguement, though it is all true.

They're running around in power armor, the ones i've seen taking no damage.
---
You know, honestly I forget about chems. 
---
Good looking out! Thanks for the tip!
---
Destiny and Destiny 2 are pretty goddamn fun games 
---
Does he have a certain path??
---
His negativity started a basic argument where he called out a guy for cheating. The so called cheater was bragging about getting all serums for 500 each an then selling them for that price.
---
Black Berry ewww. Used to love them 10 years ago.. Do yourself a flavor and drop the Iphone, then purchase a more dependable phone that's not from a self serving company. Any flip phone would be better....lmao ;)
---
Wow...100 caps, hope he's on Xbox :)
---
Oook that's new Gal then i have no idea what they are doing. Nothing would surprise me though.
---
But why nerf it for the main game? FO4 had the same thing with explosive shotguns and they could be used as a quick room clearing device for people who had one. I understand these weapons are duped like mad but what happened when mod support came to all platforms on FO4? Everyone downloaded a mod to make whatever legendary they wanted, even TSE. It's a power house but it's supposed to be. Granted it gets old when you are trying to split mobs with team mates like in uranium fever and some blueberry is in there 1shotting everything but that's how it goes. Some people aren't as courteous as other. When I notice that happening I'll stand in front of the guy with said weapon with pacifist on. 
---
People don't like it? That just makes me want to do it. 
---
Plot twist: OP is the duper himself and wants to seek his goods 😉
---
Do you know how much flake Bethesda would get if they made PVP a battle royale? Honestly I don't know where they will take the PVP but I'm going to guess it will be like Ark and Rust. 
---
Says it failed to load :(
---
Me and a stranger meet. We each gives an emote. Then I say something on mic. They freeze like if trying to find their mic-on-button, then they usually respond.
---
Speak first. Most people responds with voice if you initiate it.
---
lol. To keep things amiable I have been getting a hankering to play Fo4 lately. First time was on Ps4, this time will be on a PC so I get to play with mods this time. Looking forward to it. BUT NOT THE STORY GUY
---
leave your team i did that and it fixed itself
---
Sounds like he passed on his good favor. 
---
There are exploits in all of the games with this engine, it is so much that they can be considered part of the game. 
---
If you don't like it just don't buy them unless you know they aren't duped.
---
Reported you for witchunting
---
Let's kill him
---
Thank you for asking I've felt too dumb to ask 
---
Is that the witch costume? I can't seem to find the plan for it anywhere. 
---
I just did the same thing :( 
---
Dude insisted he had the patterns for the serums. I believe him, innocent until proven dooper
---
You or a team mate have the lucky break perk card active and it activated fully repairibg your armor

Does it usually spawn three? I fought them for awhile but it took me forever kill just get one and I didn't have the patience for the other two.
---
Happen to me last night! Even let the ghouls health regain happen. Was pretty bummed. 
---
2-shot ultracite laser?  Prime 10mm SMG  receiver plan?  got a few odds and ends but it depends what youre looking for
---
Never played 2 as I got tired of having to revamp every weapon I grinded for at the launch of the first. I remember when the big expansion came out and made my 100+ hours of grinding useless. Before that yea I love Destiny lol. I'd like to see the transfer system implemented in this game though. That was ingenious. 
---
That's awesome, more people should do this :) 
---
Ib4l
---
What if i told you this man was doing this to get extra meds for his sick kid? Would you think differently?
---
Just saying, but it is hurting the game. If you look at it like that.
---
In the sense that instead of the game world being where it should be probs 12-18 months down the track it's only been 2months since release.
---
I'd offer someone 500 caps for limbs and 500 caps for chest if they would trade. I've been hoping for a while now. Haven't found them
---
Plot twist: The stash the guy found belonged to OP.
---
I'm not saying he is or isn't. Just the effect his negativity caused. Anyway, the argument was interesting imo.
---
Oh dam sorry about that should probably read rules properly before posting edited post removed his name hope that clears things up
---
That was fixed in one of the last patches.
---
Tea time event always spawns them if you're interested in seeing one alive. 
---
You can also do it on a 1x2 foundation. Essentially two foundations next to eachother. Fitting everything inside like all the benches and even a sleeping bag, PA station and the trumpet and a small stash box. 
---
"They have better gear than I do so they must have duped it" Thats exactly what you sound like.
---
Found the duper
---
I too have had the icon pop up without the perk equipped. I believe it's a bug and maybe you get a free proc, maybe not.
---
I'm still waiting for my Nuka Cola flair...
---
Based on Schrodinger's experiments, our lack of a pause screen means you may already have the health bar you want.
---
Pause screen? In an online game?
---
The quest markers wouldn’t disappear for me but I just went along the course as I thought I was supposed to and sure enough finished the quest. 
---
Lvl 14 kicks ass of the 50s that attack him
---
Aren't those kind of battle royale though? I mean Rust the servers reset each month. So maybe that needs done. I didnt necessarily mean battle royale like fortnite or anything but along the lines of Rust where you start with nothing and have to find it all again. 
---
LOL. Butchered. 
---
You need to watch the button depress. If it didn't register the previous button, it won't to anything at the next one. Remember to hit the ending button for each challenge. Never start early. Wait for the timer to allow you to start.
---
Supposedly they only show up if you level 15-20, so you either need to buy them or create another character to get them. Check youtube, there are a few videos on this.
---
Judging by the friendly rocket fire mole people hate mole people as well
---
The first time I went to WS I was level 30ish. There were high levels all over so I was murdered by high level hordes. A nice high level helped me get inside and we had a great time with some others ... until someone shot a robot. Well then it was chaos - but when everyone else ran to the bunker for shelter, I hadn't done the mission so couldn't get in and just had to take my murderizing
---
What a great night. 
---
I have never once been able to spawn one of those ghoulfers. I wish I'd gone earlier. 
---
It was a death animation. The player was then executed (to keep others from reviving him). You could not have survived while having a limb blown off.
---
The Eyed Piper!
---
South of monorail elevator has a spot with a great view and water. It's about halfway up the very tall mountain over there. 
---
The spot im at has some lead veins too but I've been there awhile and am ready to move... Water, view and lead are nice but it doesn't have any crops or special things and the only enemies I ever got were low lvl radrats and wolves... I'd rather have an event spawn to get grahm and the easter egg wandering things 
---
I will give you two balls of lint, a half drunk bottle of mellow yello with some backwash, and a brass ring.
---
Yeah I am just trying to state something here haha
---
Apparently it’s multiple items not just the tesla rifle. 
---
Yep, pretty good read.
---
If they go that route they better fix the accidental 3 points of splash damage my shotgun pellet does to someone's water purifier while I help defend their workshop. Been wanted 4 times and all for this reason. Maybe drop all carried items if wanted is 500 plus.
---
I've noticed this a few times that a group of creatures dies for no reason.
---
Earliest was today where 4 brahmins spontaneously dies. It have happened in the past with other creatures as well, such as ghouls, scorched and foxes.
---
There where no enemies, traps or such that killed them. It could be a gravirt bug that kileld them but I don't really know.
---
RAIDERS RISE UP
---
Idk I did it on the first try on both my characters with no problem... I use a gamepad on the pc
---
Agreed. It sucks seeing this game devolve to that. I use mine that I bought when queen runs and bunker runs are understaffed. But I run a nice vats/rifleman build qnd the crits do serious damage. Never had damage issues before my o.p weapon. 
---
Who are all these people? Ran into one person like this in 200+ hours. I know tons of people have these weapons, but literally the only time I've been attacked is at a workshop.
---
Yeah, no surprise lol.
---
Yeah we have been trying hard to get Beth to do something about it.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aaedli/want_to_know_why_the_servers_are_unstable_bethesda/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
Good chance they have something planned for it in the comming patches. I am sure it would be hell to try and find a way to undo alot of the damage the exploits have done.
---
What is your argument?
---
Bethesda said pvp mode,not instanced servers.
---
The suits are seemingly tiered at each level tier. I've seen level 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 40. All of either damaged or regular type.
---
Seems like the Alien Blaster mission regularly has level 5 suits available in the chamber at the end. I'd grab a few on your main and keep them for potential new characters for early Nuke EXP farming.
---
Squirrels are dicks irl though
---
It's the internet, It is not that serious.
---
yeah i read it was supposed to be 15-40? Was that debunked?
---
Yeah, search this sub for the map. He only covers the entire state, so it narrows down from "literally anywhere" to "several roads that cover the entire map"
---
Maybe the cats are hostile because they escaped the cat house, that place is scary.
---
Has anyone found the free suit of PA behind the converted ammo workshop? There's a fun story to go with it.
---
You never seen someone using one in a nuke zone after 200 hrs? you dont have to lie now
---
then you're lucky
---
Bethesda needs to hire you
---
Love photomode. Super bummed that console users can only take 50 photos
---
Ok, the real question here is: where do I get the shiny chrome X-01 paint job? Or is that what it would look like if I took off the "prototype" paint? Beth being Beth, I'm afraid of removing the Proto paint and being stuck with rusted crap I can't change back.
---
And none of them spawn jack shit when nuked. I have personally nuked Charleston and Harper's Ferry in addition to prime and Whitesprings and both were disappointments. Next time, I'm going to nuke wallyworld or whatever it's called. The designers should have put the different fluxes in radically different parts of the map. Granted you can only really get a decent supply of violet at prime, and you can only really get a decent supply of yellow at Whitesprings, but it's just so very lazy. Why couldn't they have put more thought into what was obviously going to become a focal part of game play?
---
Thats exactly when that weapon should be used. I like the challenge. 
---
They should've just let you equip any level if you have a max level card. Needing to re-earn a card you already have maxed to get a lower level is just asinine. It also clutters the hell out of the card menu. 
---
If I was a rich woman I would gild you for this response. You are such a good sport. Have a bunch of upvotes instead.
---
I put my plans in the trashcan at railway stations. It feels good to put that ivory grip plan in the trash WHERE IT BELONGS 
---
I think they need an emote that says, "Only wanted because a shotgun pellet hit your water purifier". 
---
I like that back-peddle. Again, if you're on your way out, you're not going to be investing in atoms, the bread and butter of what will keep this game going, so in the eyes of future dev investments you're of no consequence. 
---
The few whales that have landed on fo76 are still pouring in their real dollars for the emote/sticker/sims-like decorations/ photomode non-sense, I even see myself using atoms for p/a skins, knowing full well they are manufacturing scarcity with the limited time only deals*. 
---
New players that wander into the wasteland won't last very long in the current environment, watched dozens guys not make it to lvl20 can call it quits due to server stability and players workshop hunting them. 
---
The wipe will have to be followed by either a promotion or "free to play" re-introduction. This is a discussion that warrants its own post honestly, I appreciate your input on the matter.
---
Stop duping .
---
Hey, you should state what platform you are on :)
---
Removed IGN because of witchunting rule 
---
I dunno, whenever it's cleared I server hop to the next one. It respawns every time someone logs into it from what I understand, don't know what the spawn timer would be otherwise. 15-30 mins sounds like a regular spawn timer
---
I ran into this exact bullshit for the first time the other night and I salute your response. 
---
I have never duped. I bought all these treasure maps over the last week on the trade reddit
---
At this point I'm thinking of just not using them which sucks but it's taking up space for a real build.
---
I have the speed boost mutation so my poor toon goes from zero to dehydrated in 15 minutes, luckily I am addicted to events and the sweet sweet free purified water and ammo I will never use
---
I think there is a no-nuke zone near the Vault and this might be just inside it.
---
Mini survival camps rock. I've got a 2x1 with 3 generators, 4 missile turrets and all necessary workbenches. Puzzling it all together is one of my favorite things in this game!
---
After dropping my ammo to fix the bug I really love the weapon. I've dropped like 6 legendary ones thinking they were permanently broken. 
---
Though I was playing fo4 and holy shit the fo4 one charges quickly. In 76 it's not feasible to wait around for it to charge. 
---
FYI charging it then holstering it doesn't stop the flashing light. It's like pocketing a disco ball 
---
Afaik they can onlt spoil in your inventory. The plants can be destroyed though, and will need repair.
---
Really any song from New Vegas is great in any Fallout. It’s just a shame that I can’t get fully immersed with any music playing. 
---
The problem is too far gone in my opinion. The economy is already tilted because of duping. Builds dont matter anymore when any lvl50 can use any TSE weapon and become a God. 
---
But still. The game is somehow still addictive. Multiplayer with friends is an absolute blast for me. So we suffer through lol. 
---
My husband and I play on totally open area chat all the time and I often forget others can hear us until they respond....usually by laughing.  We also never shut up ...
---
That really helped, thank you! I think I found my location. 
---
And y would I dupe treasure maps lol
---
I had a Motorola ages ago with an actual keyboard that slid out when you held the phone sideways, so it was wide as the phone was tall, full keyboard, real buttons. Was able to use an Android ssh client to connect to systems I managed as easily as from my PC using PuTTY or similar, from anywhere, and type with actual tactile buttons when you don't have the option of just making constant typos and not caring. God I miss that phone.
---
Is there going to be any function added to have Combat Music toggled?
---
The musical score/ symphony is so good and relaxing- I can literally do nothing but spend ammo across the wastleand and thats it sometimes. Similar to Elder Scrolls (I have modded your fallout games of past to include E.g. oblivion soundtracks :))
---
But then the combat music comes on and just wrecks my chi, you know?
---
As a player who refuses to use mods online currently, Bethesda can you please add this? :)
---
My argument is:  it will not be dead on arrival as long as it is *fun* . 
---
PvP mode means separate servers for pvp events, methinks.  I could be wrong. If not that would mean joining a queue, joining the, say, CTF battle, then when it is over being plopped back into the server you came from.
---
No thanks on the hunter/ hunted. I prefer pvp with a goal. (X amount of kills, ctf, zone) 
---
 The pvp I've done so far consisted of someone shooting me then we battle for a few then disappear into the wasteland.  It is fun, but hurts my cap stash every time bc I am not great at it.
---
Still new to the game, what's the best way to server hop?
---
hey i liked choose your own adventure books as a kid, but video games can be more than that....  buddy.
---
You get a full set of Ultracite power armor for doing Belly of The Beast quest. Maybe you did it and didn’t see it gave you PA.
---
If u take floor piece it should go over it deleting the tree. Then scrap or store the floor piece and the tree should be gone 
---
but yeah, not quite a bulldozer 
---
Yeah
---
I have to disagree - bring lower level players to farm when you know higher levels will spawn due to nukes, waters down the experience for them.  Stop spoon-feeding them and let them experience the real horrors!
---
You people complain about dupers but low level tagging for XP is almost as bad - in a way, it is still a form of cheating.
---
Not sure about all the other parts but crippling the combat inhibitor causes them to attack everything, friendly or not.
---
Yes. It ends up back in your inventory.
---
I think the only game I've gotten close to this many hours is either fo2 or 7d2d and that is like 3000 tops. 
---
You can still try the event at the prison, it's supposedly slow, but some guy said he got it at level 53
---
Just log out and back in.
---
Likely just hit the daily cap reset time. I'm guessing the inventory also changes. Had mine reset on me once 
---
Drop. They become free to good home.
---
It's 30 mins normal respawn. Rhey respawn when a new player enters that cell(others being in the cell can cause them not to respawn with that new person). You can have someone log out, join back on you, and run into the clubhouse to spawn it.
---

Thnx

The Glowing Sea. He'll use it as a ...cloak, or a.. a shield!
---
I like to move when I can, I prefer locations with a great view. I found a nice spot near the lumber yard in the forest with a small pond, but decided to move. I might go back there again though. Otherwise I like to be along the river.
---
I swear, I must be the stupidest person on the planet... I’m on PC
---
Lol ok man.
---
To be clear if its fun and not rewarding you're on board.
---
Hey, that happened to me!  My nuke and two minutes worth of farming.
---
I still love this game regardless of these assholes on there. My buddies and I still have a blast. I love to help others and occasionally I will go PvP. 
---
I also found this hatch last night and wondered if missiles actually launched out of it. Nice work!
---
We really need an option to join mic-only servers.
---
Oh i meant the agi perk.
---
Chems will do it too actually.
---
Without perks, 200 ore makes 500 scrap
---
Junk mail in 2102
---
Just to clarify, Power Armour is currently better for PVP. However, it really doesn't matter in PVE because your DR is more than adequate as long as you're wearing something. 
---
I think the majority of people are nice because the game is not full of 12 year olds and morons like the C.O.D playerbase.
---
Theres a FB marketplace for duped weapons... Anyone on there should get banned or at least punished. 
---
Well think of it like this: those of us who love this game will be here in the coming months with the updates and new content. These duping kids will eventually fizzle out and move on lol
---
I think somebody else just loaded into the area and reset the inventory. I've often gone through the vendor's stock and then put on hard bargain and never had anything change
---
Now you're just confusing me some. Do you think I hate story driven games or something? Because I don't, in fact I love the Witcher games, although I still haven't played the first one yet. 
---
Ah, ok - I’d hate to see somebody not knowing there was a seventh cap supply like I did. Didn’t know there was the BoS vendor until I was around lvl 130 :p
---
Duper dude unloads thousand of lb's onto other characters/mules across dozens of players, dispersing their goods. As stated by bethesda they don't have the tools to identify what was duped, and have already been under fire for banning the wrong people.
---
Np man who ever made that website is a god send for campers.
---
That's what I do a lot, or to anyone who just wanders by my camp at harpers ferry.
---
Mine loaded just fine. Now when I tried to play a gif on there...WTF. The gif from the link takes for fucking ever to load, no matter the size of the file. Every other gif on the page will load in two seconds no matter what. 
---
This x 1000.  Also a "no mic" emote, and the ability to point to the damn bag on the ground.  
---
You.  
---
Yes, you.  Yep.  There.  At my feet.
---
I'm trying to give you a buffed machine gun!
---
At #3 on your map, I found a responder corpse which had a note activating a miscellaneous quest to recover a pipe revolver at a location. 
---
YES, thank you!
---
It ain't you. Don't worry, this is well-known and already reported and I believe this was confirmed as something that'd been passed along to the devs.
---
Arks PVP is server specific as well (if I got what you meant) granted Ark servers are bigger then 24 players. Factions could act as tribes in the game to incentivize group play. Really it comes down to if they make it worth playing and depending on how you feel about the game, it's already not worth it.  
---
Yeah buddy... its not good for the games future. Alot of the community is standing by to see how they handle it.
---
Idk what drive u talking about and I checked everything can’t craft not in shop nothing
---
That's possible - I swear that I didn't see it in my inventory before then though, and it had been over a week of playing since I finished Belly of the Beast lol.
---
Master Hacking is lvl 38 and Master Lockpicking is lvl 40
---
Belly of the beast adds that to your inventory. Many, many people missed it when it happens lucky you didn't scrap it like others did by mistake.
---
If I see low level characters I know wtf is going on and I just watch because it’s hilarious to see them go in and run out being chased by 30 ghouls, after that I hop down and slam my two shot shotgun at the ghouls and wipe out their race while poping down that heart emoji 
---
You can't store it, but you can get some resources back by scrapping everything.
---
Found one in the Forest by Flatwoods too.
---
Do the plants store for 'replanting' if I want to relocate the camp?
---
It's all gone once you are. Pretty much is a waste to use anything past what it gives you for free
---
Since it's such a popular power levelling spot, you might have hopped servers to one where someone just cleared it out, though when you popped in it should have respawned.
---
Yup
---
....doesn't realize he needs to USE the blueprints to learn the items....  is he really literally carrying around every plan he's ever found and not realizing he can't actually build those things....????
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
No. I just think people criticizing Fallout 4 are missing the point.  
---
You are the protagonist with a lot of freedom. 
---
none of the "quests" are compulsory  
---
Shit, I'm playing a Skyrim playthrough right now with a Khajit vampire that "isn't the Dragonborn".  
---
Jump off the rails. See where it takes you.
---
Bug happens a lot if something in the trade gets messed up. It shows neither of you have it. Relogging refreshes everything 
---
Whatcha doin' Georgie?
---
We all float down here!
---
You seem like I've bothered you, I didn't intend to.  
---
Yes, pretty much that. The reward is bragging rights in pvp for a lot of games, which is enough in many cases.
---
Okay - pretty clear this is just a reward that I missed then. :)
---
Yes, well usually, like if you nuke Charlestown, the inside of the DMV is full of green glowing
---
No thanks, I’m good. 
---
Considering all the higher levels only got to the position from farming there themselves 
---
&gt;If you're on pc you could just set up a key to lower the spotify volume. 
---
Wouldn't it be nice if that was possible. But modern games, and also Fallout 4 and Fallout 76, have started interrupting global keyboard shortcuts and media keys. Really annoying.
---
Sorry juts seeing this, once I am in game I never look at reddit, but will add you when I go back in tomorrow
---
Well it was a bust...not sure why but only turned 2 of the ghouls into glowing, I think it was becasue another player was already inside the building when I launched, so will try again soon to make sure
---
Someone made a post where they did that, I dont remember what the outcome was, all I remember was he said it was a waste of effort. Its on this sub somewhere.
---
Because we would walk five hundred miles and we would walk five hundred more just to be the vault dwellers who walked a thousand miles to fall down at the vault door.
---
Sorry but...no. TSE is already a plague. We don't need any more people able to craft op weapons.
---
Why wait?
---
Probably more plausible than what I assumed.
---
You miss Fallout 4? I miss fallout 1 and 2 after I saw fallout 3. And I still miss fallout 1 and 2 after fallout 76. The atmosphere, the music, the one and only right fallout feeling. I was super hyped after seeing the trailer with the buried power armor and how it got crafted again. Just to find out that you find it fully working on hundred spots. That feeling in fallout 1 on the other side... Finding some cool guys in even cooler armor with big guns... 
---
Thanks, I'll try searching a bit deeper.
---
Yeah. Sounds more likely. Harper’s Ferry. 
---
The stuff you built stays on the server but it’s unlikely you will manage to get on that server again.
---
You can't spend early perk points on higher level perk cards so theres absolutely no point in waiting. I'd imagine you have to open every pack separately 
---
Why would this be?
---
Just a minor thing, but I was looking at redoing one of my builds, and seeing if this would make it so there isn't a chance of wasting a card on level up while power leveling.
---
Character names don't matter. Since people already can, have, and will continue to shout obscenities in voice, have stupid account names, and spell out anatomically improbable suggestions with letters on their CAMPs, there should be no barrier whatsoever to letting us actually display our character names.
---
Leaving aside the weird creepy enforced lack of privacy in my account name being visible to everyone everywhere at all times.....
---
a simple solution would be to have it display, in perhaps a slightly different color, just below the account name; if   
---
map clutter is a concern for whatever reason, at LEAST have it show as part of the floating nametag when someone is on your screen, between account name and healthbar.
---
Character names are kind of a staple in online games for a reason; people are attached to them, just as they are any other part of their character customization, and it's weird to even have to explain this.
---
You’re very right. Even if Beth fixes the duping epidemic, everyone is still going to have their TSE weapons. It’s a bit extreme but the only way to really fix the problem is to erase the explosive legendary effect and add it back in at some point.
---

Thx. Is their a decent water source nearby?

It doesn't change anything now, anyway. Players can just instantly swap cards

Tbh i dont know. Maybe each server goes down after some time to reset?
---
&gt;Did you know: Although the Suriname toad's skin is covered in small wart-like projections, it still has a slippery texture.

Oh no

The best outfits come from the vendor bot responder event (Charleston station is where it’s near)
---
The next best outfits come from technical data (turn in at camp venture for a chance at the outfits)
---
Back to inventory. Just be sure to never ever Drop it from inventory. 
---
Yup it happens. I’ve gotten two from one ghoul before and 5 plasma cores from one corpse as well
---
huh. and here i am being bored and literally building a base on top of a main storyline objective so I can play as a raider and have people pay my toll to get in and use it.
---
I run the Breach and Clear event pretty regularly too, for ores of all kinds

You rock. That's what I thought would happen, just making sure.

Has it? Odd, hasn't for me. I run in borderless window mode.

I just sent you a message on Xbox, gt is zombie, lvl 120

It's pretty accurate.

just jump up to the window and press e on the chair through the window. the chair still works.

Thanks saved me a bunch of time farming :)

That’s really helpful, I shot it thinking they wouldn’t shoot anymore and now I’m dead

You have like 60 seconds before it recalls if you place it.

Haha actually haven't done any yet.  Just find a ton and never use it.  Too bad it's not plastic.  Now that I could use!

I found 1 yesterday on a table on the porch of the houses east of the golf course. There's like 3 separate buildings there
---
Got one cheap. It’s....not great
---
Great ideas. It would also be cool to have a boss spawn from nuking Big Maw, the giant hole in the Mire. I dunno, maybe a giant megasloth boss or a boss-fight version of that Heart of the Mire event (the Strangler Heart, but on steroids) would be cool.
---
If you have weight reduction perks or effects, your stash will still read it's original weight. 
---
Hey! I didn't level up til around 30. Perks packs open first. Saw the post of dude saying he tried it and it didn't matter much but I feel like it did me a few favors and I am STILL attempting to get the right park cards at level 150. Those pack cards being opened are up to the game gods. 
---
If I could upvote 1 million times I would

Rather than looking at solely food and water, which is attainable almost anywhere, i'd suggest seeking out an interactive fo76 map and deciding if you want to place your base on a resource node that you can harvest while online.
---
That was actually a real debate back in the day. "What the hell *is* she saying?" They sold a ton of records to people trying to figure it out for themselves.
---
It generally does what you'd think it does.
---
Cripple one leg, an NPC will limp along.  Cripple the other, and that NPC isn't going anywhere.  Cripple the arms, they likely can't attack.  Cripple the head, they can't even aim.
---
As someone that often has to decide whether I want to be over encumbered or deal more damage I’m against the style you suggest here. I’m all for very similar to what you would suggest I’m against being able to equip both damaging perks and utility weight reduction perks. I’m all for all crafting perks that only effect crafting being able to be in your utility perk slots and lockpicking and hacking. 
---
Seems about right.
---
I'm at the point I don't even use my explosive weapons, it's boring and generally dickish in most events you would want to use it in. Hell 2/3 of my characters only have legendary armor and no weapons {Due to not finding them} :/ lol.
---
I got 3 fusion cores for 3 ghouls from the one hoarde.
---
Only happened once.
---
I run Pistols which I'm told are hugely under powered in the meta, and I can spam enough crits to easily one or two shot most enemies, and take down scorch beasts without even getting in my PA. The only relevant legendary weapon I have found is a double capacity revolver. Nothing in this game is that hard that TSE weapons are required.
---
Don't wait.  The card packs give you leveled cards (i.e. you won't get more high level ones by opening your early packs at level 50), and by opening them as early as possible you maximize the chance that they'll contain something you wanted to take anyway and thus open up more flexibility in your build.
---
maybe she leveled up at the last minute and got full health
---
I like the reaction I got when I took an alt account I was leveling and walked (only died 2 times!) to Watago station and hung around there and the Watago vendor for a bit.  Was level 3 in Watago.  I could not help leveling up to 3, with the places I discovered on the way.
---
If you're going for food an water only then probably along the river west side of map right above sunshine meadows. Set up a camp with a farm an use sunshine workshops farm an package factory. 
---
The time this happened to me it was some guy with a power fist. 
---
Advanced receivers that change ammo type are broken. Someone must have meant to apply a new multiplier across the board, and typoed it, or something. Note:
---
Pipe Gun, .38 ammo default: the .45 receiver is a DOWNGRADE. It requires Level 3 of the Gunsmith Perk, makes the gun less durable, has no other advantages over the .38 receviers for using less common ammo - and does less damage.
---
Hunting Rifle, .308 ammo default: the .50 cal receiver is a downgrade, same story.
---
In both cases, FO4 obviously had the higher-caliber receiver, requiring skill and materials, as the highest-damage receiver. I haven't discovered the mods to check anything else (what else can change caliber?), but it's clearly an oops.
---
Side note: you need to be a minimum of level 13 to apply a .45 receiver to a pipe gun. I'm not sure anyone's using pipe guns at level 13. But that's a far bigger issue; overall progression / availability does not flow well at all.
---
Correct! You'll need to wait a bit longer as I'm currently dining as well :) but rest assured I'll post it soon... today for sure.
---
-1 for clickbait title. 
---
/s
---
its cause it was all of those things and not some seedy clickbait with half suggestive poses and yeah screw it I'm not explaining stupid 
---
Huh, It happened a while ago, if I remember correctly he had a civil war uniform on, as well as a black powder pistol and a holotape that talks about the civil war fort
---
I read that in the tone of “*Light the fuses bitches!*” like the first boss in Borderlands 2
---
lvl 230 best gear in the game atm, i am not complaining about myself dumbass. learn to read, tired of this stupid answers.
---
That would make sense for the weight, what about it changing from legendary to a non legendary?
---
Where do you spawn, Thunder Mt Sub Station?
---
I like those random spawns/events.
---
 I think crippling affects your character the most, you’ll end up with a broken arm or leg or a concussion etc. and you’ll only heal it by using a atom or getting some sleep. Adamant I skeleton helps prevent that
---
As for crippling enemies, in some cases if you shoot a fusion core the enemy in PA they will hop out the power armor, although I haven’t encountered that in 76.
---
 If you shoot robots or ghouls legs you’d cripple them and they crawl on the floor etc. 
---
Good idea! I didn’t think about resource deposits. They could be really useful for ammo production.
---
I think this can be simply solved by just letting us have “set” load outs so it’s just one button press. My crafting loadout, my hacking/lockpicking loadout, heavy Guns power armor loadout, melee loadout, etc. just one press to take off all my current cards, one press to equip all the cards in one particular loadout. 
---
I can't argue with that
---
Hello sir,
---
I would gladly talk about whatever you like as you carry my weak ass through some quests.
---
Sincerely,
---
Me
---
I personally go with - hey you know this isn't plugged in right
---
no I see the wire its on
---
weird its not on for me
---
no I see it moving
---
really because its saying its offline and unlocked for me you might need to relog
---
aww crap (logs off) 
---
moral of the story - this is my camp site.....
---
Thanks :)
---
In over 1k hours in fallout 4 I have NEVER gotten one pie. I assume it'll be the same for me here :/ ... is it so wrong to want some delicious, preserved pie instead of all this rad infused Cram!
---
No, just split the universe and let the rest of us start new characters in a dupe free wasteland.
---
Note that this requires that they actually **fix** the exploit, which hasn't happened yet.
---
You ever get any pms? 
---
Nice work! Would be really cool with new end game content along with some updates on rewards and some pre work to set it up.
---
Also it might be good if scaling bosses that are tough did not allow characters with tio low level to participate. Boosting lower levels is great and all but carrying 5 lvl 10 hiding in the building by the Queen doing zero for dmg or support is not that fun in the long run. Not saying they should not be there IF they can, I am saying they should not be able to be there and Making the Queen scale up. 
---
My 2 caps. Great post 
---
Wouldn't that be a luck debuff?
---
I just find it funny how you say you like pvp with a goal and yet you're ok with a pvp mode with no rewards attached.
---
Most ppls goal in a loot based game is to obtain loot.
---
Also referencing what wow did years after having open pvp on servers with hundreds of ppl is a weird thing to start on. 
---
Its like me saying call of duty has a good pvp system years ago so i can expect fo76 to mirror that.
---
It'll be available soon. Just 400 atoms for each color, or 1200 for all 6.
---
Source: Lowered expectations.

Tbh I think the damage is done with tse flooding the market. I do agree with punishing the people that are duping but people that buy the duped items are not to blame. Some of the people that buy most of these weapons don't know any better. Me and all my friends have a good few of the tse weapons and we love playing the game with them I'm 350+ hours into the game and I still find it enjoyable with all the tse. My friends made the suggestion of removing the explosive perk but I said that would be a stupid move as it would piss off a lot of people that did grind for the tse or exploding gun. what Bethesda should do is adapt to the current situation, with coming updates and dlc. Who's not to day that the new vaults opening are going to bring in new mutations of enemies that explosive weapons are redundant against them and we will need to 're adjust to the coming updates. 
---
Actually the other comment I think might be a better option. Just scrap one bulk into individuals, that way you don't accidently forget to pick it back up or put it back in the stash.
---
Whoa which objective?? I want to do that!
---
Plans for legendary mods 
---
Yep!  You can find some good conversations on it.  I have my camp near a Junk site with an extractor on it, which gives a bit of everything.
---
Just tried again. Only one box yielded an extra stimpak, and some didn't even give me the "search" option (yes, the perk is equipped). The missing search option happens quite a lot to me, actually.
---
Cheers to that. My late uncle used to play DOOM on PlayStation with my cousin and I parked on each leg. Wouldn't trade those memories for anything. 
---
I only get annoyed when lowbies tag high level ghouls and try to force you to kill them by bringing them over to you, its super scummy and i've logged out before just to know the ghouls ate that idiot alive.
---
When you get the actual reward at the end of the mission it comes up in the list as Power Armour Chassis so it is easily overlooked :P
---
In that case it def glitched because I’m 36 and dont even have my level 3’s for both
---
Eso should totally count, since that's basically exactly what it is
---
Very cool!
---
A kid with his toy revolver and a western novel for entertainment in a vault for 25 years. Out of the vault came a man with a strong sense of justice, strong religious belief, and a deadly aim. Finding his childhood church taken over by devil-looking roots adorned with human remains, the gunman have made it his life goal to hunt down the cult of mothman.
---
I've gotten like 16 now since I made the account. Usually a highly upvoted post will get one. Get a lot of people that send cats and bluewaffle and stuff as well.
---
yeah you can spawn there. usually the substation will also have gulpers and sometimes legendaries.
---
I'd take a screenshot but I'd have to restart the game to do it
---
 Nice
---
Lame ass way of playing foo
---
I was thinking the 1-time use mods, not so much plans. The idea was that they would be rare.
---
I wonder if that's the problem I just encountered. I had taken over workshop, me at level 16, and it dude in power armor level 51 is walking through. I would start talking to him, tell him he's free to take whatever he wants, and that a defense event was about to happen.  I saw the speaker above his head turn on multiple times and I told him I couldn't hear him but it seems every time I talked he was trying to reply but I never heard anything.
---
Remember when games had meaningful manuals? Pepperidge Farms remembers!
---
Under intelligence.
---
Just stole the good mans karma
---
In an online game it's never acceptable to trivialize everything. If the developer won't nerf outliers like this then the only way to make challenging content is to power creep out of it. What that would mean is TSE weapons would become the entry point, the rest of the game would be completely irrelevant and whatever new sauce they introduce would be even more over the top.
---
Even better, use the excavator pa and go to lucky hole mine, can easily get like 300 lead ore which is over 500 lead in one single easy run.
---
Just had the same thing happen to me in the mire, no scorchbeast to be found. Sounded almost like Liberty Prime's footsteps in Fallout 3 and very obvious screen shaking
---
There's a difference between going there for a quest, and those that go there to play tag for XP.
---
OP has already stated in the past he brings new players to go play tag with whack-a-ghoul...  that's just totally stupid.  Why not allow them to explore at their own pace instead of power leveling/farming?  Its people like the OP I have real issues with, not the low levels who happen to show up by chance.  I feel these people do more harm than good, there's plenty of time to farm in the endgame, but so much to explore while you're at lower levels.
---
Don't rush it - there's absolutely no reason to!
---
Sweet, I’ll be on tomorrow night as well around 8pm central, I’ll add ya
---
I'll have to check that out, I like crevesse dam spawns, never get tired of that place.
---
Oh i only had the base game. No dlc. Lol. 
---
Well yeah you don't announce the ban in advance.
---
&gt; already been under fire for banning the wrong people
---
No, the only bans handed out so far were ultimately for the use of things like cheatengine.
---
Youre right damage is done and its just another frustration on the long list. Either way, im not giving up on the game as I highly enjoy it regardless of the TSE problem. 
---
I'll give you 1500 caps for the shocks, I also have the plan for small letters.
---
Nope
---
Just spent an hour server hopping with my level 40 alt trying to get the plans. I can't conclusively say whether what OP says is true or not. I'd have to may another alt to confirm and I don't want to at the moment. Will try again later.
---
I found an easier way to explain how to get to the tent/train area, just walk out from the substation directly onto the street and continue forward and you'll see a train cart just nearby.
---
I found my own bloodied explosive shotgun and I wasn't a dick with it. Yeah I'll smack you and try to get you to PvP me, but that's your choice and I'm not gonna take your junk. I never go to camps and fuck people over with it. 
---
The problem is bad parenting and inability to join a non PvP world, not the weapons themselves or dupers IMO. I don't dupe because it would kill all the fun of the game for me but honestly, but I can't blame people for doing it. Bethesda is responsible for that. There's no consequence for duping and ruining the game for everyone else so of course people will do it.
---
There's gotta be another feature where if you grief enough camps people will get a mission pop up to kill you or something, and make the griefer unable to fast travel. Idk if that would work but something along those lines
---
My apologies, you're right. I never bothered to count down the time between placement and first warning.
---
Camps are pretty buggy when you go to move them. There is probably one tiny piece that isnt registering as being attached. The only fix is to delete that "stored" blueprint, which will break it down into each individual component, so you gotta start over.
---
That thing is really Heavy. Takes up like 19 space...
---
Fun to use though :P
---
I have found it at whitesprings at the black powder vendor or on top of the widow maker on a peak at Camden park. 
---
But that's meaaannnn. You should play the game how I want to play and spend all of your time making sure that everyone else has fun at the expense of your own fun!
---
I'm all for modding Bethesda games, but in its current state I'm afraid to mod 76. I don't want to have to write an essay to Beth telling them I only want to correct things they neglected to fix.
---
Resource deposits can only store 20 resources at a time. Its really not worth it. I would suggest placing it between whitesprings, harpers ferry, watoga and the raider station down south. That way you can fast travel to your camp and have cheap fast travel to each of the vendors.
---
It's probably a rare drop. Ferals are known to drop ammo and cores can be considered ammo. Thus by logic it would be possible. 
---
It is actually a wonderful mod. I can clearly hear the SB's at a distance, and up close its not nearly so annoyingly deafening. I also giggle quietly when I hear a few of them going off in the distance.
---
Great link!!
---
What level was it
---
i set this up one day spent about an hour or so and wasted about 300 rounds killing the 3 groups of goules that came in + the caps to get there.... 15 minutes later server crashed never seen one round from the machine... well fuck never again
---
Are you bulking your junk? Also check your steel, I had thousands of steels that was taking over 100 weight in my box. 
---
That's not at all what they were saying. You're making it overly dramatic because you know it's selfish to want everyone else to play how you think they should play. 
---
Yeah, that place is especially busy this week because of the guaranteed beer hat
---
16 times the detail, people!! 
---
Bad rant with god awful logic. 
---
I will never buy anything listed on one of these exploitative one day sales. This mechanic has no fucking place in a non free to play game. 
---
I got stuck on this one too and had to Google it. The mission marker points to the wrong terminal, you need to go to another terminal first.
---
Wow
---
Are we insane for not wanting to see it for the 5,642nd time...?
---
At whitesprings when I went there as a level 30 it was a level 30, I went to Camden park pretty early but I remember it was around +25
---
(This kind of confusion is why they should take the time to give chassis their own icon, or to in some way name them so that we can tell them apart)
---
Whoever thought a yellow hud in a game environment filled with yellow, orange and brown was a good idea, should be fired.
---
Still nothing for Excavator tho...
---
Ok well I think that is a total play style hash too. Yes I agree TSE weapons, especially the shotguns, are OP and I have one but that doesnt mean I run around using it all the time. Most of the time I am using a 2shot or a bloodied explosive I found. I do this because I know the gun is OP and I want some challenge to it. I save the shotgun for the queen or for when I am solo and get into a situation I didnt plan out well. Just because some people run around firing TSE guns at everything doesnt mean it should ruin it for those who dont. 
---
I get it, they are OP and it has pretty much ruined the market since you cant sell instigating or furious stuff anymore but I have been seeing more and more posts with people after 3* weapons that do not include explosive. I think the flame will burn out when someone has that OP gun for a while. It just gets boring. 
---
The point is that why is the game even allowing my ammo to be transferred in that scenario? Only reason I am spamming the button is because it should only ever allow me to deposit the event materials. 
---
Duping is not a playstyle. Or at least it shouldn't be
---
Laughs in level 50 liberators outside vault 76
---
Lever isn't level locked. I got one at like 70.
---
Xbox unfortunately but thanks for the offer!
---
Why is this a bad rant? Did I miss something?
---
50k caps
---
&gt; No, just split the universe and let the rest of us start new characters in a dupe free wasteland.
---
Easy there Lord Rahl :p
---
Yes because those emot display every single thing you could possibly want to say. You're just being an ass at this point.
---
Sounds like you need a hybrid melee/shotgunner build. And not that this is a bad build, but if you're going to dedicate perk cards to either combat, and they both rely a bit on Strength, and they are both close range, you'll want to choose a main and a sub combat style. Like for instance "I mainly use melee, but if I need to cripple a SB or deal with hordes I use my Shotgun then switch back." Though, of the combat style a Melee AND Shotgun hybrid build is probably the easiest to do as you don't necessarily need all of the Strength shotgun perks as long as you have Enforcer from Agility.
---
Borderless didn't change anything (other than making it faster to alt-tab). Odd that it works four you, been this way for quite a while for me, thought it was normal. Been trying multiple workarounds too, and multiple music players (mediamonkey, groove, winamp), but can't get them to react to any global shortcut or media key as long as I'm in certain games. Fallout 4, Fallout 76 and Assassins Creed Odyssey is at least a few of the games I remember I've had trouble with.
---
The keys work if I bring up the Steam overlay (whenever I use Steam). So sometimes thats the workaround I use, if I get really desperate for better music variation.
---
What do you mean bad rant?
---
Okay thanks
---
I want more reeeeeee
---
&gt; wild-ass guess
---
Yes I am well aware that the whole thing is just that.  A guess.
---
Just as every time NASA/ESA lands somewhere, get ready for a stunning collection of rocks.
---
No problem you may have to served hop for it to spear at whitesprings. 
---
they can easily be made with enough materials
---
We got fairly lucky with the keycards and found them before we got to the computer, my friend decided to try it without going to the computer first and he said it was working by the time I got done with the biometric scanner and swiped the card he was waiting. (1min 45+) We ran into the second part and he waited at one end while I started the reactor shutdown we restart it with two minutes left on the clock meeting in the middle, (1min) both sprint to the long hallway for the second section and work quickly on breaking the mainframes. We finish the two rooms quickly and then get to the third room where you have to replace the boards, (2min) only I took them out and had all the steel and circuits to replace them at the tinker bench, (1min) I run back and replace them and the last bit is just like you said finishing the final room in three minutes, we honestly felt like that part took longer than 3 minutes but if you timed it then it's 3.
---
A few notes on the run for some reason there were no turrets except in the starting room (thought it was weird as well and we assumed someone failed the run before us), we both had TSE I had a gauss rifle and he had a shotgun, I one hit the big sentry bot and was able to one hit the colonial gutsys and assultron dominators as well. Mutations on my end are speed demon, marsupial, bird bones, twisted, and talons. I used one stimpack and he used 3, 2 were on me after I shot the ground by accident and we both know the layout like the back of our hand. Jumping down the stairwell at the end of the two hallways saves a few seconds also. All in all about 8:45 to clear the four parts and the other minute fifteen to run the hallways. 
---
Getting to 34 without any help from SPECIAL is a feat! If you like melee and shotgun then Strength is for you. Put some points in, see what you like and what you don't. There are 3 shotgun perks, you can sink 1 point in each for +30 but you need 2 more in each for another plus 30 so if you are worried then try one perk in each. After level 50 you will have more perks than you need and you can trade around SPECIAL points so it is really hard to make too much of a mistake.
---
I would start with one point in each of the shotgun perks and the sluggers. So I would probably max out strength and fill those in if you are pretty sure about melee and shotgun. Endurance can help QOL bu slowing your hunger but not totally required. Intelligence for weapon and armor building and longevity. 
---
I have a TSE Handmade that can 1-2 shot most non-legendary mobs, a full set of X-1 that's only missing the shocks to be fully modded out and I am not even CLOSE to running out of things to do.  I wander around half aimless exploring and finding cool new stories everywhere 
---
I have all the power armors (I like to collect things) so if I happen to find a mod for one of them I need to go into my stash and start throwing all of them down all over the place trying to find the one I need. It is a real mess.
---
I would definitely use the different models a lot more if they were labeled properly. Could have the jetpack on the X01, Stealth boy on the T60, use excavator for big hauls and use them for different situations but because it is such a pain to find them they end up just sitting there not doing anything.
---
Woodwolf if you are on Xbox would you make me one please
---
From the vendor? I did like 100 server jumps at 30, and always check ever since and haven’t seen them. I did the prison event dozens of times too. 
---
Also choose a melee weapon preference? 1h, 2h, fist weapon? And power armor or nah?
---
I know what you mean, I launch a nuke and overlap a previous nuke at whitesprings, no problems, but when I am scrapping weapons at a crafting station I get disconnected, I have been disconnected at a crafting station more times then any other
---
I meant tschudy my bad
---
That's fair, too...but maybe they need to look at why it's so popular a Nuke site, and tweak other areas to make them more popular. 
---
Lower spawn rates at White Springs. Increase them in more remote areas, to encourage nuking further out. Dont rob the fun...just relocate it.
---
I've had my CAMP here for a while and never had someone parked in my spot, but now thanks to you guys I get a "someone's in your CAMP space!" notification on every other server. Thanks a lot!! :P
---
Disconnects and CTD during the "Scorched Earth" events needs to be prioritized to be fixed as soon as possible.
---
I fought the Scorchbeast Queen 3 times today with a group of people. 2/3 times, we all crashed to desktop or disconnected. 
---
It's highly infuriating pouring thousands of rounds of ammo into an enemy, and get absolutely nothing to show for it.
---
Since we all crashed or disconnected at the same time, the problem cannot lie with us, and must be server side.  
---
???
---
I got a preserve pie once, my friend ate it.
---
I would recommend melee till you get a nice firearm to respec around. Otherwise commando vat crit build or commando sneak builds are strong    
---
Everyone with a TSE isn't a duper. Everyone that one-shots things isn't a duper. Nobody is responsible for making sure that you're having fun. If someone bothers you with their playstyle move on. 
---
What a steal 
---
I've actually never encountered a game that didn't let me use my custom bound keys. 
---
It might be the way you're binding them, program vs right to the keyboard etc. 
---
That's be nice. It also stinks as is if your build doesn't otherwise need perception.
---
True.
---
They have preferred vehicles where I work, that they drop tree nuts on. The love the sounds of nuts in truck beds, for some reason. And on windshields. Nuts on windshields are their favorite. 
---
Oh so you're one of the microstransaction supporting religious zealots. That explains everything.
---
JUNK:
---
Even if you don't see an immediate need, you should turn on search highlight for these scrap items and collect as much as you can, because you will need lots of them later.
---
* adhesive: need for any weapons/armor crafting and especially repair basically.
---
* screws: same as adhesive, they quickly will become the bottleneck
---
* ballistic fiber: for repairing armor
---
* oil: need for weapons and especially grenades.
---
* aluminum: used in many things
---
* springs: particular for power armor
---
* lead: if you are making ammo, you will use a lot.
---
* nuclear material: needed for lots of gunsights and other random crafting. less common but can be smelted from uranium or found in mole miner loot
---
* probably some other important thing I'm forgetting
---
You may not need to tag these because they are more obvious, but you'll be going through a lot of these:
---
* steel: Likely used more than anything. Needed for craft items and CAMP, and ammo will chew through it fast.
---
* plastic: used for bulking which is mostly handy for keeping inventory tidier. (Aluminum and Lead will both drop weight though when bulked, but most things do not). If you aren't making shotgun ammo, it's easy to find plenty.
---
* wood: keep a healthy amount on hand, you'll go through it fast when building CAMPs, and you need some amount at all times or you won't be able to cook. You can get scrap wood from most logs on the ground or any type of wood pile. You'll also get a bunch (and steel) from scrapping weapons.
---
WEIGHT / INVENTORY
---
* You probably won't regret investing in basically any weight-bonus perk card early on. 
---
* Mole-rats, radstags, and brahmin all give meats which can be cooked to give temp STR or carry weight bonuses. Good to keep a few steaks on your person incase you need to lug some extra loot. Booze items will also give you +1 STR but don't last very long.
---
* It's usually better to scrap extra guns than to try and sell them. You'll quickly pile them up because vendors won't have enough caps, and the weight hit is bad on all weapons. Plus, scrapping an item gives you a chance to learn mods for that item, and that's how you have to learn most of them.
---
* watch your inventory like a hawk. stupid things like bobby pins and gunpowder can easily pile up to ridiculous amounts of weight. It's also easy to have way too many food and aid items. I personally like to have 10 RadAway and 20 Stimpacks and that's probably too many. On the other hand, it really sucks to run out of them. If you are struggling, dump *everything* in your stash (if there's room) and then pull out only the bare minimum of what you need. This can drop a really astonishing amount of weight, especially at lower levels.
---
PVP
---
* If you shoot someone else's workshop (even by accident) it will give you a wanted bounty, and people will come after you. You can get around this by enabling pacifist mode.
---
* On that note, if another player attacks you, they will only to do minimal damage until you attack them back, and then you both do full damage. So don't retaliate if higher level players provoke you, or it's an easy kill for them. Some players can do so much damage they might kill you anyway though.
---
CAMPs

* if there is an ore deposit, you can often plant your camp there and set up an extractor to mine that material. Junk deposits are great cause you get a good balance of things, including screws.
---
* From the camp menu, you can lock doors, collectors, and purifiers so people must pick the lock if they want to come in/take them. This will give them a wanted bounty and also make any of your defense turrets hostile. That said, pilfering isn't a huge problem and it's nice to let others use your craft tables and stuff if they want.
---
MISC
---
* When leveling, you choose the SPECIAL point and then a card. The card does not have to match the Attribute you added a point too. Also if you haven't chosen both, you can back out and pick a different attribute if you find a better card. You can also hit back from the Level up screen if you just want to look at your current build and not spend the points yet.
---
* Pay attention to your SPECIAL points and make sure they match how many card points you have deployed. It will show if you have extra points, but *only if you have more cards you can add*. So if you don't have extra cards it may not be obvious you have spare points.
---
* Vault76 and your CAMP are free fast travel points. You can save a lot by leap-frogging. Any owned workshops are free as well, so they are sometimes good to claim even if you won't be spending time there.
---
* Treasure maps return loot based on your current level, so if you find them, it's better to hang on until you hit level 50 to dig the treasure. If you find multiple maps for the same place, you can mine it again for each extra map.
---
* Look at the event timer if you join an existing event (i.e. one that you yourself did not trigger) It's not uncommon for there to be way less time on the clock than you can possibly do the event goals in.
---
* Avoid buying item mods from a vendor if you aren't going to immediately apply them. If you run out of other junk, they will auto-scrap if a craft item needs that material. Pay attention to the detail screens on what it says you are using. It's better to leave them in the stash, but it can still happen there when building CAMP items.
---
* keep track somehow of what plans you've learned, because vendors will sell you plans you already know, and there's way to tell from the vendor screen.
---
Um. I think that's it.
---
If you are PC i can make you a couple.
---
Why?
---
I completely disagree. There are a multitude of smaller quests (like scavenger's notes) that could form interesting end game content but they don't even work.
---
If you've played the game slowly like I have, waited until the last minute to try the nuking out and visited every single place on the map then there really isn't much of an end game. Especially because random events are very predictable. 
---
There is no 'right' way.  
---
I've found that a 2hd melee/rifle ranged is best for solo.    
---
I do have a char that is a 2hd/shotgun but is lower level. Don't upgrade the Shotgun, Expert Shotgun perks right away b/c they eat up a  lot of points at 9 maxed out. You can supplement with Skeet Shooter. One level in Pack Rat (for junk runs), the one that has 2 levels and reduces armor weight, Bandolier for reduced ammo weight, First Aid at least level 2. Lone Wanderer maxed.  
---
You can do others but it depends on how you're playing. You can take Lead Belly and Cannibal and only have to worry about Water. I have a build I can suggest if you wish.
---
I've clearly got a lot more crafting to do. Any tips would be welcome. 
---
But the game is boring.
---
No endgame at all.
---
Why waste your time playing something that no longer offers content?
---
The workshop nerfs didn't do it any favors either.  I'm pretty positive it's faster to just farm the materials up killing mobs for steel and gunpowder and then dipping over to Lucky Hole or a gym for the lead.
---
Wonder what spawns if you nuke it?
---
Ill come destroy you with melee if it makes you feel better
---
This looks cool. What's it about?
---
Love this
---
I have ended up using lower level cards rather than the max level, so there is some utility to that. Im not saying I like it, but just pointing out that getting duplicates of maxed cards arent always useless 
---
Immediately. There is no benefit to waiting and you could get a card/cards you want. They are random and two of my characters got mostly cards I wanted early on so it saved me points. 
---
I never said it was fine. Just mentioning they are indeed planning new PvP modes
---
Why you stashing them? Drop that shit on the ground and set it on fire lol
---
Yes... That would be mo betta. Lol

Server?
---
The sound reminds md of my mother in law
---
Any screenshots, or DVR?
---
What can I say...
---
Except you're welcome
---
We are talking about two different things. I dont care what people kill or dont kill with their TSE.
---
I do care when they duplicate their weapons, because it ruins the economy. Its not because I dont have fun, its because they are literally ruining an essential part of the game. (Well, its already ruined) 
---
I dont know why you are defending them, its the same economy for all the playerbase. 
---
Yes! Finally! Definitely going to start playing again once that’s out.
---
I haven't had an issue with storage since the increase, and have fun playing my way, so thanks, I will continue to do it.
---
Uh, we're all fine here. How are you?
---
Hell yes, I’m dying to flip off the next person who’s standing there pumping rounds into me trying to get me to engage. Just standing there giving them the ‘bitch please’ glare just don’t cut it. 
---
No.  Just for fun we built it like an hour in a half ago. 
---
Their lore is pretty neat, I just feel like it is a little bit too derivative of the ghost people from Dead Money.
---
A Fallout 76 wedding now thats definitely different.
---
can confirm at level 180 i see it at welch
---
80k
---
What a cool idea. Let us all know how it goes and if it's a success. Some screenshots of strugglers would also be a giggle.
---
You're not worried about it being nuked around that area?
---
850k
---
No, of course not...duh
---
Ugh. I’ve checked so many vendors it’s the only part of the game I don’t like right now. 
---
They said the next patch is coming this month but haven't gave a exact date. Rip to people who have 20 bullets in a lever action rifle

Just got one from a scorched, but it was carrying a laser gatling so it made sense.
---
For lead, nithing beats Lucky Hole Mine wearing Excavator apower Armor.  Then, steel seems to be the rarest thing.
---
What time are you doing this too. Can't do it now but really want to!
---
I can't imagine it being much worse than one-shotting most mobs, two-shotting level 90 deathclaws, and the only hard part of killing scorchbeasts or the SBQ is waiting for them to land.

The Enclave is what remains of America's pre-war government and military. Our mission in Appalachia is to create a secure and prosperous state in the image of pre-war America by diplomacy and military action when warranted. There's a Disc invite on the flyer if you'd like to know more.
---
Id need to know more. If you're saying the legendary effects no longer work then it could be a number of things (would need to know what legendary effects it had) but if the weapon is now considered non-legendary with no effects or ***s then I'm not sure why that would have happened.
---
You don't use glow sight?
---
Haha for sure! Eh not really. If it is it is can always rebuild. Plus its a well known area so thought it be easiest for ppl to find.
---
Best part is half the quests you get from doing this are broken.
---
The scavenger's hunt quest asked me to find a pipe pistol in the wendigo cave which was a "quest item" and did nothing.
---
Then I found a suitcase giving me a very special "note". The note tells me that we need to distribute armor to save "the great state".
---
It cuts off and doesn't mention which armor, and the suitcase only contained a glass jar.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/Yd2u08W](https://imgur.com/a/Yd2u08W)
---
When I picked up the note it actually did a fancy animation which I don't recall happening previously.
---
Right now! :)
---
I'll be there!
---
Do the uranium fever event. You'll get 3 legendary enemies in total each time.

Babies crying about shit also ruins the sub.

But well prob do it again soon.

Every day is October 23.

The fact that everyone is gone when you wake up and you do not have any actual memory of what has happened.

---
We don't have squirrels in my country (not even in the zoo). I am sad now cos what you describe sounds so cute. 
---
1. You can choose to upgrade a SPECIAL stat and choose a card in another one.
---
2. Do not spread your perk cards out too far. Main char is level 65 and is all messed up.
---
3. Don't upgrade ANY perks until you're at minimum level 10; better yet wait until 15.
---
4. Pipe weapons aren't good after 20 or 25. Even the legendary drops aren't good compared to what I've seen.
---
5. Don't hoard everything! At first yes; you can get a lot of stuffed saved up and save time. 
---
6. Focus on one melee (pref 2hd) and one ranged weapon.
---
7. Lone Wanderer is best taken asap. Action Girl/Boy compliments it well. Incisor ignores armor. Every build should have it.
---
8. Quest rewards regarding gear are leveled. If you complete one at level 26 and get a pistol that does 30 damage plus an effect but wait until level 50 to turn it in, it will be much better.
---
9. You can SMAP the "Collect" water button on any river. You can wear a Rad Suit (Posdeidon Energy outside top of building) or pop Radaway if you have a ton of it. You can store up a lot of Boiled water and save up Purified water for a boost.
---
10. Initially, sell most of your chems and weapons you're not using for a decent caps boost.

you only need a max of 5.

I don't get it. Whatever. If people don't like others being their fuck em.

I just ran into some lower level characters getting swarmed at Harper's Ferry by Super Mutants. I cut my way through them with my trusty Grognak's axe, stopping to block a bit occasionally so they could get some plinks in for the loot. After clearing it out, I dropped the more or less plans I had on me and moved on. They seemed to appreciate it.
---
I did run into one mutant who rendered sideways so I couldn't hit him with the Axe. That was weird.
---
Hopefully you had some power connectors duped in the process so you can now power your mansion you can build. Or start scrapping to a buildable limit again!
---
One MILLION!

Kk! :)

The second. It was 3* with 40% faster swing, 90% reduced rate, and I forget 3rd. Now its non legendary but was still favorited and had same mods on it..

Alot of muitlplayer games can learn from Destiny
---
Where is lewistown
---
Why doesn't he just kill the new poeple
---
Put the points into the Nukes and Dragons builder.    
---
Then from there, each stat will only show what perks you can get by points and level.
---
No

What’s better?

Once you're breaking 2k, come back with a new video!

Please elaborate 
---
one of the transponders for the BoS quest that leads to the glass cavern. north-west of watoga on a bridge. i have it blocked off so that the only way in is a) pay my toll and I let you in or b) you break in and take a bounty, which then lets me shoot you and loot you.
---
its honestly one of the worst things ive ever done. I'll try to link pics if i remember to later when I get on.
---
Have you got a 2k gun? What is it?
---
I found that one myself. I believe I cut the red wire, which was wrong. But it's always the red wire 😋. Thats ok, Im sure I wouldn't have had the room in my inventory to carry it. 😄

Max out the Hunting Rifle early on and get a ton of .308 ammo from Super Mutants. Make a friend with a high level player. Get a full set of PA or a Radiation Suit from the top of Poseidon main building. You can jump upon a plant hedge and then onto a wall where enemies can't get  you. When they bring out the horde, carefully snipe as many as you can. Lots of XP and since each enemy is a separate loot box,  you can get some good stuff quick.
---
I have the same issue. I haven't found a fix for it either. =PS4
---
The Skeleton and Witch costume are part of the spawn list for the highway marker by Crevasse Dam, want to say 65 but don't quote me on that. You are looking for the dead trick or treater.
---
Several guns can get there.  Melee as well... synergizing perks isn't as obvious with some weapons as it is with others.  My main ranged weapon jacks up over 2.2k with a full perk focus on it.
---
It's all about perks and legendary effects. People have weapons that do upwards of 2k on the regular...   
---
Some can get it as high as 8k. I'm sure someone has managed to break it and go even higher still. 
---
you need to go to section c. have a nice daaaaay

On xbox we are forming a town of sort close to fissure site prime 4 people have already joined I joined yesterday as the farmer I make a TON of food and water for everyone come join us if you want. Level doesn't matter if you can live down there you good enough the mayor's name is MrDiamond2
---
What’s the build on it?
---
Lmao imagine thinking that's hate speech
---
No doubt lol
---
That's the Prototype Hazmat, right? It also has a cool bright yellow look unlike any other Hazmat suit. 
---
I would love to see that!
---
Wait are you telling me that sometimes you actually get the pie?
---
Random spawns mostly
---
Yeah, I'm not sure why that would happen. My only suggestion which you may have already done would be to log out. If nothing else else works maybe attempt to trade with a friend an see they are able to see legendary effects.
---
I never saw a handmade. Got it from the prison on my 4th or 5th try. Now everyone is doing that event so it never comes up for me.  But the lever I got at grafton train station.

I don't care about challenges or achievements.

When they started putting them in games, I simply played and when they pop up....it's nice surprise. Maybe b/c BGS has some lonely, horny virgin graphic designers who really need to get laid but then wouldn't make half naked characters.

I agree wholeheartedly, and i have qute a few times killed players who have murdered low levels because of this. Gets annoying. 
---
I won't take the time to build and then link the build, but there are plenty of great discussions on it in this subreddit, just search pipe rifle perks.
---
Yep. You have to have the map or the mound isn't interactive. 
---
My level 45 TSE Gauss Rifle is around 1100 with no chem/food/buffs, explosive perks, or prime capacitors. Just straight rifleman/vats/Crit build.

You can do it on a 1x1 with just a foundation and a small staircase then a platform on top.

No.

Too bad all the legendary bots drop crap loot for me 😜. I don’t need another 1* leather leg piece lol

Not all are useless, but the extras of the crafting or of cards that can only have 1 perk level just make it more difficult to get through the cards.

Handmade on the other hand only shows up at Watoga Train Station and Harper’s Ferry between the levels 15-19. I can confirm this as I have a level 16 alt parked in Watoga and as of current course sold just over 100 sets of Handmade plans. You can get one about every 3rd or 4th Server hop. They are around 800c list with no CHR perks.

I don't have the computer, but based on its specs you would probably have to go down to medium or low settings to get good performance. As for the game, I'd rate it a 6 - good potential and fun all around but some of the issues really get in the way of enjoyment
---
Have faith

no worries, just shoot an invite :D

Acquire a combat shotgun and upgrade the agility perk Enforcer to 3. You can cripple the scorchbeasts and they will land. For maximum effect, add drum mag or buy a quad combat shotgun. Upgrade it to automatic. 
---
I haven't once defended dupers. Once again you're exaggerating to try to make a point. The OP is complaining about TSE users. That's literally the point of this whole thread.

I do this all the time with my dragon and my lever action. I use the dragon as the opening shot and then switch to my lever, which cancels the reload on the dragon.

Level doesn’t mean anything. I built a three-story decked out mansion as a level 15.
---
Tonight was the first time I'd encountered any players being dicks in game. Of course it was at Whitesprings. I was about level 35 and it was actually the first time I'd been there, but of course a group of 3 level 100+ players followed me around, one-shotting everything with their TSE's and giving the thumbs down/X emote?

How do you change the HUD? I've been looking all over google and the only things that come up is pip boy color swap, nothing for the main HUD.

Hey man, I just sent you a friend request on 76

Now that’s an idea. Sounds perfect for what I’m looking at on standard cancer bats, how well do they handle SBQ?

Thank you this is all I needed
---
Always store your most valuable junk, you can join while encumbered, I have been doing that since the beta. Now I always make sure if I am at white springs, before I log off, I go to the train station, so I never respawn at white springs.
---
Same thing happened to me, I didn't know what was going on, so I jumped out of on PA to try put my hazmat suit on and died, some douche found my bag before I managed to get bag and took all my junk. Why is this even a thing, he didn't shoot me so why does he get to steal my junk .. anyway lesson learned.

It's not even breaking a thousand, so no.

I just gave away all my extra plans yesterday. But I can craft it for only the cost of mats. Thats totally up to you though
---
Say you have a two shot explosive Black Powder Rifle. That rifle gets dmg boosts from the rifleman perks AND explosive master (or whatever) perks. Not sure if it gets up to 3000, but I assume that's how!
---
Still yellow indeed!
---
The bear in the picture totally ripped my face off. 
---
Still happening? Level 82 and ready to go in 20 minutes. 
---
My apologies but you misunderstood me. When I said taking in a low level character, I did not mean a different person. I mean my own character, an alt. I have three characters one level 134, one level 120 and one at level 29. The level 120 was power levelled and built for melee. The level 134 has been around since the beta and the 19 is a strictly vats oriented build that I started on last week. Two of those three characters encountered issues with higher level players who said on mic that I had no right to be there. 
---
It was someone's comment on a different post that prompted me to make this one, as he was one of the people of which I am speaking.
---
We met an invincible rad roach once it was terrifying. Nothing would stop it. We ran into a room and closed the door and that little fucker opened the door and came at us lol. Good times.

90k and higher by exploiting bobbleheads.
---
You can definitely hit about 2400 with a TSE shotgun with the perks and popping some meds legit though.
---
So the endgame is something you can do before hitting the end of the game, got it.
---
You stack things like bobble heads, perks ect. I was doing 4k with a bloodied explosive gatling. Melee has more options to stack damage with str boosts

Cool, add me and just come over whenever you see me online, haha
---
That’s not „on the flipside“, it’s the whole point :)
---
Shotgun or a black powder rifle or the dragon
---
I'll give you 500. Send me a PM if you're down. 
---
Cool, thanks
---
I have got plenty of 1* wooden legs too 😜. Usually don’t even lick them up. 
---
What
---
Does dense armor help against the explosive effect?
---
This is where I found mine
---
Anything above 50 is techinally 50 so 50+.
---
Average i would say 150 to 300 area.
---
Ah ok - that's understandable if an experienced player wants to bring an alt there.  I've heard people showing their friends (low levels) around Whitesprings showing them to tag stuff and what not.  You can hear them if they have area chat.
---
Pics or didn't happen
---
This is really useful thanks!
---
Thanks bud!
---
I have my camp next to one.   
---
Ive seen the bomb twice, but also had a tank, power armors, random bodies, safes, and once 2 deathclaws. alos a ton of other things. 
---
I've practiced and perfected blowing into the mic to mimic the sound of a scorchbeast flying overhead.
---
So much fun in groups.
---
I was playing the other day with a new player who was pretty low-leveled, like 10-15. I'm at level 68. 
---
We were stomping around, trying to level him up and do a couple of his quests. I mentioned that I needed to step out of my powerarmor because I was down to two cores and we were doing lots of running. 
---
Dude turns around and without a word dumps 35 fusion cores at my feet. :o
---
Like... dude you had over 60% of your carry capacity taken up by fusion cores for the last few hours at least.. And he swears they weren't from duping. I was afraid to ask how he got so many, but gladly traded him 1000 rds of 308 and 1500 fusion cells for them. 
---
Each time you level up you can pick a card. Keep picking gunsmith and it'll give you the option to merge them and level up the card. 
---
After 5 levels of this you'll have level 5 gunsmith. 
---
Level 50 is the soft cap, it's where gear stops scaling and you can't upgrade your SPECIAL anymore (but you can start respeccing)
---
I'd consider that high level, it's where you start really fine-tuning your build and getting legendaries and participating in nuke zones more often.
---
After 50 you can do pretty much any content, by 80-90 I would assume they have a pretty fleshed out setup and can do just about anything.
---
That's what I needed.  Thank you.
---
Camps there should be annihilated with holy nuclear fire. All of them. It's everyone's duty.
---
It's pity it costs so little to repair everything.
---
I'd introduce some sort of tax for placing a camp in Whitesprings. Like, 100x repair cost.
---
Get Hacker 3 and you’ll be able to turn off the turrets in each room. I play solo and launch nukes all the time. The eight players recommended is just for the scorchbeast fight.
---
Ah thanks. Makes a lot of sense when you put consumables into the mix.
---
rookies put fences around their crops. Pros remove the interior floorboards in their house and plant crops there.
---
Crazy. I just bought the same plan not 30 minutes ago and it cost me 260~
---
No perm cards that lower vendor prices or anything.
---
Editing the .ini won’t get me banned or anything?
---
There was only 1 that I remember and that was in fallout 4 that don't make it a place in every game 
---
I’m afraid the technology just isn’t there. It’s actually caused by the same thing that causes the lever action rifle reload glitch
---
Nuke zones need a remake as right now they're pretty boring unless in a power armor.
---
Though it does seem like enemies do less damage in the zone then they normally do. It's just boring to be in a 0 def suit, while your friend in a power armor isnt effected by anything fucking thing around.

Issue: during the event defend monongah power plant, scorched spawned underground making it impossible to kill them.
---
I used MarketFO76 and traded for some caps. Thank you though for offering ! 
---
YOU’RE WELCOMEEEEEEE!
---
It literally means that it’s a bad rant 
---
You don't get any stronger after 50 so I'd say there.
---
I have a set of everything and where the t51b. That said with the power patcher perk 40 levels ago I have never had to repair and still above 75% on any piece. I do the 51b primarily for looks and ease of plans for upgrades.
---
It only pissed if the minority of fans 
---
"you see that bears game last week? hell of a game!"
---
I was wondering what he didn't like about it, you knob
---
Maybe if you took a break from smoking weed all the time, you'd have an opportunity to read the damn terminals ~~and interact with the NPCs~~ you pothead 
---
I think I missed something ... he crafted a short lever action rifle that does 149 damage. How did it get to 812? Just mods?
---
I am a percussionist
---
You should rock a blue shirt with dark pants.  Evil Dead style.
---
Shop smart. Shop S-Mart.

Should be integrated into the game but this is a huge time saver. Shortcut for when at base, shortcut for when out fighting, shortcut for hacking/picking/trading.

jesus.. may i ask what build you are using? 
---
There are no mods for the dragon but the black powder rifle has a bayonet
---
You are 100% correct. 
---
Open and close the map a few times and your camp and 76 will show up
---
Their prices are very high and most likely are not selling how many want. So this is a good thing that instead of doubling down they are bringing the prices down.
---
I can't wait to try SBQ with you, it'll be fun on a bun!
---
Lets start a band

Go to r/UnionMerchant76

We also do giveaways

Doesn't Animal Friend work on scorchbeasts?
---
Hell yeah!  Now I need to go hunting for cosmetic parts!
---
Yep but lawyers will cling to that minority and news outlets will make it seem like it everyone 
---
yup same issue. wil try and restart game, switch server a few times, see if it resolves itself. or maybe try and go back and take ALL the keycards there? seems silly but maybe it needs the exact correct one?
---
Why would you feel for people who bought it prior?
---
I don't get this whole thing of "I bought something and now later on it's cheaper....how is that fair?" 
---
Almost everything you buy, ever, is cheaper later on.

On xbox we are forming a town of sort close to fissure site prime 4 people have already joined I joined yesterday as the farmer I make a TON of food and water for everyone come join us if you want. Level doesn't, matter if you can live down there you good enough the mayor's name is MrDiamond01. we are all randoms btw I know none of them. We range from lvl 30 to in the 100s and it doesn't matter if you have a mic or not. There are a couple aluminium deposits here too 
---
What platform?
---
And these were ripping bloated mobs like butter, it was fun to watch!
---
Ignore the diamond. The mob is around there somewhere. Sometimes it's just gone but that's only once in a while. The diamond is a damn liar. 
---
I cant remember if it was just a bbq really or a drive in but I did see something similar to the fallout 4 one without the screen or diner area.
---
Whose the mayor 
---
Doing God’s work my son..

Can any perk that does not have combat or survival effects automatically be passive? Because that's essentially what happens now - if I go back to my camp to craft I switch in all my crafting related perks (e.g. Science, Ammo Smith, Chemist, Super Duper, etc.). When I leave CAMP I swap back in all my combat perks. When I have to pick a lock or hack a terminal I swap in exactly the needed number of perks then immediately swap back in all my combat perks. If I forget to swap something in / back in I just experience some frustration. There is nothing fun about swapping cards in this way. The fun part about swapping cards is when you change your spec e.g. I was specced for big guns and now I'm going to respec for melee. The latter is good and fun. The former (swapping for crafting, lock picking, and hacking) is entirely a chore.
---
I understand it's good that they bringing the prices down, just reinforcing that the prices were stupidly price in the first place
---
Cranberry Bog. There’s a junk pile near the power station (with the Deathclaw). It’s just north of Watoga and fairly close to Silo Charlie. Some trees but not a lot.
---
MrDiamond01
---
If you park close to Lakeside cabins, southeast of mutant camp, you can basically choose from 4 different faction vendors and they are all walking distance. About 5 minutes unencumbered.
---
Well sweet Jesus everybody the noob in me is coming right out. I’ll tell ya what I hate and that’s always being low on Radaway. Maybe one of these TSE’s is what I need. How can I obtain and/or mod one of these bad boys?
---
Doom comes to mind for me lol
---
Build budget increases with level, right?
---
Just repair all structures at your c.a.m.p widget.  The one you place down.
---
Are you short on scrap?  I'f you are on PC I'll make a scrap  donation. 
---
odd build, love it
---
Before hitting the gear level cap (lv 50) I thought anyone 5 levels above me was a high level. But now I'm past that I only think people over level 70 are high level. Only because by the time you hit lv 70 you should have some alright gear.
---
I'm the farmer I have a aluminum deposit running with 3 water purifier pumps and a crapload of razor grain and corn with a brahman
---
DOOM comes to mind for me lol

A true child of Atom.
---
I can only wish I had a TSE weapon, but I do have weapons that 1 shot those mole miners. As a lvl 187 if I come across a TSE abuser who's trying to be greedy I'll make it a point to deprive him of as much as I can. Most the time after 1 shotting the legendary before they can it gets the point through. 
---
That waterfall sounds amazing. And the dark protects against enemies without night vision or a great sense of smell.
---
It's not that it's "cheaper" now it's that that's what the price should have been at launch (or cheaper). It's good that they are bringing the price down don't get me wrong.
---
Sure, here is what I am building into now.  You can also stack various psycho and whiskey.  I also currently have 18 mutations (all of them except carnivore) and will likely be spending tomorrow farming the unwanted ones out to improve my strength by another few points.
---
In a group is where this really starts to shine with some of the group based perks and mutations.
---
grats! Love this set.

I like to craft fireplace trees and build instruments in front of them to take pictures.

Yeah, only 8 Luck as well so pretty surprised. Just a habit from past games to try my luck every time I see one, there are 2 in Watoga I know of
---
Why bother posting this if you're not going to include the build? Or the buffs that were active when the screenshot was taken. I mean, if you're at 3% health and fuss stack of 5-star Adrenaline plus chems, it's a little early to celebrate.
---
Dude I did the same I had all the atoms available 2 days ago but nothing good was on the store so I bought new floors and plants then this comes up and I needed it 
---
Im doing another one if youre interested
---
build will be far from optimized at 50

I've seen them go back to dropping on q certain vehicle, after changing to a new one and getting irritated because, I guess, the nut impact sounded different.

They're cute, furry little jerks.

This is a Bethesda Russian troll bot.  "This is all a simulation!  How could you possibly think we didn't fix the lever action rifle animation or any of the other bugs that have been in the game since FO4.  Just wait...there is so much more better tasting sauce to come.  Just make sure to buy from the Atom store!"

Honestly, I might virtual cable myself the original Doom sound track to share with the masses when I go for the SBQ.

Sounds like a trap to me!

He didn’t downvote me, and I didn’t downvote him.  So I’m guessing your triggered since those downvotes probably came from you.
---
Happened to me today (though only 30 minutes worth cause I stored junk) from a fail involving my own explosives.
---
Luckily someone still on the server showed in recent and I actually got it back.
---
Don't think anyone can deny their prices are too high. But they seem to be looking at it, i was happy to grab the 3 tux set for 800.
---
I just don’t cater to idiots. Like someone who doesn’t know what “end game” means 
---
Itd be great if there was even just a camp or even workbench mode. You don't need any of the crafting perks when you aren't crafting so setting up a loadout that triggers when crafting would be great. I use the perk loadout mod which is convenient but I still forget to switch sometimes
---
It seems like low damage until you see that the chainsaw hits many times per second.  On a laggy server the damage is pretty low because it's not properly tracking all the hits for some reason, but on a good server you are hitting so fast, especially when adrenaline kicks in, that you are just moving through them and they fall away dead before you even realize they were there.
---
Dumb.  Downvote this garbage shitpost please 
---
Mind sharing your secret 
---
During a Whitespring nuke i killed 15+ of the green blobs. There were at least 3 legendary enemies between them i noticed. Wanted to first kill them all, then loot them.
---
Bad idea.
---
Was greated by the awesome "Disconnected" popup shortly after everything was dead. :(
---
Sitting on the desk just before the launch room, in the arms of a teddy bear.. Is usually a hardend rifle. Or a variation of the hunting rifle 
---
It makes it really hard for me to take pictures with them too. 
---
ahh nice so somewhat glass cannon build.though i feel like if you swap out serendipity with adrenaline put 4 instead of 1 it would really shine but thats just my opinion  
---
If it won’t register than you may not have done a part of the course right.
---
Oh 100%. I think thats actually a decent price. But for one Rocketsuit that was in Fallout 4??

They should have had a 0 cap tux / dress at the Whitesprings bar vendor for New Years Eve

I always kill ghe wildlife. Often leave their hide because all i need is the food.

I wish the perk system was like FO4. It gave you perks you earn instead of a random card shuffle. I like when the perks were permanent and not switchable. Also, it gave me motivation to eventually get every FO4 perk.
---
So you never left the vault

Welcome mats.

Shotgun? Rifle? Pistol? Heavy? Need to be more specific

It's all situational. But as a general rule, Two-Shot Explosive anything is the way to go. They are grotesquely overpowered.

Uhhhh where is this located?!

My character’s inventory and pip-boy are seemingly invisible and completely inaccessible as of this morning...
---
Had been saving Treasure Maps since level 1 due to the level-based rewards, this morning I got stuck on the Early Warnings quest glitch (4/5 Upgraded Motors, even with all 5 in my inventory, then 0/5 with no quest materials available after relogging), tried to fix it for an hour or so, then decided I’d go open up my treasure piles since I couldn’t progress further in the story (was planning on using all my maps once I had all the main story/faction quests completed, so close enough).
---
I had 19 maps for “Cranberry Bog #2”, the one near the Ranger Lookout Tower under a bridge. I spammed the E key on the mound of dirt, and ran (jogged, technically) to the nearby Bootlegger’s Shack to scrap all the weapons/armor I had gotten, since I was overencumbered and couldn’t fast travel to my camp.
---
I disconnected from the server while scrapping, and when I relogged my character was butt naked, with no pip-boy (“pip-boy is unavailable” whenever I tried opening my inventory). Strangely enough, the game let me sprint and jump as if I wasn’t overencumbered anymore, but I could still see the Overencumbered icon/debuff under my AP bar. I also couldn’t fast travel due to being overencumbered. If I punch something I get my gun back with zero ammo, if I get hit by enemies I get some armor pieces back (never underarmor though). As soon as I log out and back in (or disconnect) my inventory becomes invisible again.
---
I found out later that other people here on reddit have had similar issues opening more than 10 treasure maps in quick succession and getting disconnected. My friend tried to trade me because he said he had heard it was a possible fix for this “treasure map spamming” bug. Two weird things happened:
---
1. On his screen I was apparently completely invisible, even though he could still see the button prompts to invite me to a trade/team.
---
2. He opened trade with me, things seemed fine (my inventory was still blank), but when I opened the trade invitation from him we both instantly got the “server not responding” error and both disconnected at the same time.
---
After a little extra digging it seems other people with this bug have the same issue with disconnecting other nearby players, so I’ve decided to just retire my character as of today and log in only once a day to see if the problem has fixed itself or not. Hopefully by tomorrow or the next maintenance patch my character will be fine, but if not I’d rather not play overencumbered, starving, dehydrated, armorless, ammoless, unable to open my inventory, and disconnecting any innocent player who happens to walk by me and decide to trade with the weird invisible/naked guy (not sure how I look for others besides my friend’s description).
---
Also please fix the Early Warnings upgrades motors quest step. Someone else posted that issue in the comments here, so I didn’t go into detail about it, but it really sucks not being able to finish the story on my main character. Doesn’t suck as bad as not being able to play him at all due to a missing pip-boy, but still.
---
Right up there with these 18 dollar power armor paints. :(
---
Hopefully it means we could see further drops.
---
Probably because if you check out this thread here [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aao6ae/how\_to\_make\_the\_chainsawripper\_high\_damage\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aao6ae/how_to_make_the_chainsawripper_high_damage_and/)
---
You will see that even at 30ish damage per tick it tears through mobs.  I can clear the non-glowing 60 ghouls out of whitesprings with no issue on a 30ish damage one.  at 20-30% health with just the build above (which I did link when asked, I was super stoked and forgot) minus nerd rage or psycho/whiskey it was hitting at that damage, many ticks per second.  Also wasn't using double blade for the doubled ticks or bow blade for armor pen.  Considering its a non legendary, level 20, broken weapon that is tearing through mobs, it's cause for celebration.  You know, for those of us who think the TSE meta is boring and all.
---
Nice gun! Pipe legends aren't uncommon, but nobody's seen a hunting rifle legend yet.

My fiance has a Bolt Action Pipe Rifle with medic's effect and explosive bullets. It's not to bad of a weapon actually

I have the mods, I was just testing out various things and it's not as glass cannon as you might think honestly.  I have only been having issues on laggy servers where my hits aren't registering correctly or when someone pops in and respawns entire groups around me.

You need to steal a nuclear keycard from a cargobot.

Trombone! I was really excited to see wind instrument plans then immediately disappointed that it was only tuba. Tuba? Really? I mean trumpet or flute or saxophone but the tuba? Don’t get me wrong, I love tuba (I dabbled on one back in college) but there are better brass or even woodwinds to encompass “wind instruments”!

So I'm confused.

So you reported someone on zero evidence?

Dude it’s just a game don’t take it so personal. I too will shoot at random people and try to get pvp going. It’s just me having fun. No need to get all emotional
---
I get I have been extremely lucky with my TSE weapon drops, but I do grind this game like fucking crazy, so I feel like I've earned it (me and the friend group did like three weeks of whitesprings 24/7). Just because someone has a TSE doesn't mean it's duped, and I'm really sick of seeing posts about it here that kinda equate owning a TSE to being complicit with dupers, or [just straight up calling you one](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/acfdwx/just_a_quick_reminder_tse_users/). Like, I get it, it's frustrating and the TSE shit needs a rework or nerf or something, but at the same time calling someone an exploit abuser just because they have a powerful weapon they grinded for...c'mon... 
---
Even cat stopping you from playing that crap xD
---
That's a bit ridiculous when the other player has no way of fighting back.
---
Can I also have one? :)
---
except Bethesda
---
Yep I’m forever leaving goodie bags of weapons &amp; armor I no longer need or duplicate plans in the Flatwood church ... because when I first started a level 80 gave me a bunch of stims and radaway I figure we need to keep the Wateland good karma going

You're right about the hats, but no black prospector's hat spawned for me. I did get two black cowboy hats though so that's cool.

Intelligence doesn't even give more XP in this game. It's basically useless aside from crafting and it's not even that important for that. You can just pop a Mentats for added Int or Rad-x to suppress the mutation temporarily while you do your crafting.
---
The guys in red you want dead
---
The guys in white you want all right
---
I'm inclined to agree.  I'd like to either see atoms for events or a steady release of event-related in-game obtainable gear.
---
Hard to justify 95% of the new content being behind a paywall.  Only new items I can think of they've added have been the blanket couch and chair.
---
Call me crazy, but going through someone's post history in hopes he posted something earlier which may or may not be relevant and up to date any more is not what I normally would do. If you post numbers, provide context. If you don't, you get a post like mine being all snarky.
---
And TSE meta is not going anywhere by virtue of being both ranged and AoE. So that's kind of a moot point anyway.
---
This. I want to be able to install some QoL menu mods that I've seen but I'm way too scared to because of what they've demonstrated their opinion is on said modding. Idk how you go from having modders fix your game to flat out banning them for existing in one release, but Bethesda have done just that.
---
Am I missing something?  I have never been able to loot monster that my turrets killed without my help.
---
Yes. When? 
---
Now
---
"a new PVP mode" and you assuming PVP disabled/enabled servers are a long stretch of speculation. 
---
Where'd you get the plan? I been hopping through Camden, Welch and Lewisberg and no luck. Or is it just that rare? 
---
You fail to see the irony in your post...
---
It will require Ultracite ammo which requires Flux to craft.
---
It has a 30% damage to scorched bonus and generally has the best stats of all the receivers.
---
The damage is usually the same as hardened. 
---
/shrug whatever you say boss, have a great night anyways!
---
There was another in Far Harbour, so it must have been some sort of franchise: 
---
Sure you can fight back. Turn pvp on....If you really don’t want to lose the caps or risk getting farm destroyed switch servers. Problem solved
---
Its funny that you had to check where the nuke was landing. 😆
---
Gotta be careful doing this(on xbox anyway idk about others) when I was around lvl 20 I had full sets of t45 and t51 armors and because they use too much weight in my stash I devised a plan to cut that down. Put those pieces on a frame and store them. Seemed like a good idea and as for most of you it was. But alas the nature of fo76 kicks in and after waiting to have them recalled I tried to place them to make sure that it worked correctly and I can put them in my stash and not worry. Sadly I couldn't place them and before I knew it I had 2 more frames in the inventory. The original 2 still not able to be placed and then 2 empty frames. After reloading i only had the 2 empty ones.
---
Tldr i lost 2 full sets of t45 and t51 doing this so be careful.
---
How the hell is it possible to have 480 carry weight without power armour? I’ve put over 500 hours into the game already with a full melee build and and can’t help think this is bullshit
---
Grafton, watoga, Phoenix, seem to be the go to vendors. Got them unlocked and playing thru on my new guy with low expectations!

It might have been Karen &gt;.&gt; she finally figured out it was me who switched her TP 
---
and thank you! 
---
Same problem. I posted it in a separate comment branch but will copy-paste here since we have the exact same issue:
---
OMG, SERIOUSLY?!?!?!
---
i feel a bit silly now.
---
I see. I knew about the whole flux stuff, but was kind of hoping it had a better bump over hardened. At this point, even being able to bump it like 10pts would have been worth it, but I dont always have piles of flux laying around xD
---
Can some one please point me to a source where "a new PVP mode" is confirmed as PVP servers?
---
Their hostile so that the wasteland whisperer perk effects them. Otherwise we wouldnt have pet cats.
---
Appreciated for the response. I also made my own group for deaf gamers from social network and will inform them about your comment. Thank you very much!
---
I don’t feel the intention was for people to swap out like we are. I think they thought “Oh, someone’s going to want to be a thief in the group and pick all the locks” and that people would just have the perk equipped all the time.  I’m sure they expected some swapping, but I really feel that the amount of swapping people do is far more than what was expected. 
---
As such, for there to be passives, they would likely have to rework the whole system from the ground up (which may be fine for some people) - shoot the final product might not even allow for swapping at all, making us choose a build for each of our characters.  At a minimum, I’d imagine that they would reduce how many points we have per attribute.  
---
I think it could be nice to have loadouts - I like having the non-combatant and camp/workshops based cards for when I’m holding a workshop down.  I won’t need to eat very often and I get a bunch of neat bonuses while I’m there.

So it’s one of those “be careful what you wish for” since what might want is to just use your combat cards, but what you mgiht

Charisma doesn't and Luck just effects durability of an item you pick up.
---
Runs hot and cold for me.  Sometimes I walk Watoga and find 4 Legendaries but often-times I find none.  
---
I did see a 2-star mutant overlord at the flooded trainyard today.  Going to start poking my head in there when doing my legendary circuit.
---
flutist here ! 🎵
---
Power armor has a set base strength of 11 and you lose any bonuses your non power armor pieces would normally confer.
---
So if you have more than 11 strength your capacity will go down. 
---
That raises too many disturbing questions. 
---
11500 caps later for the letters plan 😁
---
I believe Luck affects the condition of your loot i.e. how good shape it is. With a Luck of 10, I occasionally loot things that are at 100% condition, or maybe over-repaired up to like 120 or so.
---
No, no, no, that's the CAKE. Different game, older reference.
---
Watoga is my bulking spot so I already Have that unlocked as soon as I hit 15. 
---
The candy terminal gives you a pretty good list. The only rewards it isn’t very detailed on are the high price awards.
---
I just started playing a little while back and a higher level player was at the first overseer camp and dropped a bag of stuff in front of me and I totally thought it was some kind of trap and ran away from him. Now I feel bad. 
---
So that's why the Rocketsuit was there in the "new" items. I already had it so I was wondering what was going on there. I wonder if that new dress they made available is a permanent item but the discount is limited-time only.
---
Recon scope needs 2 science and 1 gunsmith I think.  Got nailed on it because I only had the perk 3 gunsmith and the math doesn't work with 4 intelligence.
---
Theoretically I can get it to work if I grab another rank 1 card though.  Not sure what the other recon scopes take for the more advanced guns.
---
Is there any good spot other than the very upper left of the map for cranberries? It's so far away from everything else I'm doing I never bother going there since I first stumbled upon it.
---
I have pvp and I tried going at him with my shotgun, but based on his full suit of power armor and the gun he was using (something that you can only get on a higher lvl than me) I couldn't even dent him. 
---
He would have had to lose track of me when I fast traveled out. But no, he was wanting to harass me for some reason and tried to find me, despite being blocked.  If you're blocked, shouldn't that be the memo to go away?
---
Exactly
---
Dude I've got like 840 .38 right now and I've never duped a thing, and that's AFTER deliberately shooting 1200 of em through pipe pistols just to waste em. 
---
.38 is insanely common.
---
Sounds like someone talking from their crinkle
---
Makes sense though. If you add Welch, you included all the major highish level areas on the map.
---
It depends on the weapon. I use shotguns so it's actually more efficient to use Ultracite ammo (same crafting requirements plus 1 fluorescent Flux.)
---
So for regular crafting of shotgun shells with ammo smith I get 21 shells. With Ultracite I get 43. So for the extra cost of 1 Flux I'm actually getting 22 more shells per craft. 
---
about as far as it takes for someone to get mad at the internet ;-)
---
I've read all the terminals, do I read them again? What's my motivation?
---
&gt;Charisma doesn't and Luck just effects durability of an item you pick up.
---
I’ll get that later tonight!
---
That sounds like a seven year old Micheal Scott 
---
Like I said idc what they do with pvp as long as I can opt out. Right now I can't and that needs tweaking. Pacifist mode definitely needs to make your camp immune to pvp or free to repair, one of the two. 
---
Fallout is a loot based game ?
---
Since when. 
---
Diablo is a loot based game. Borderlands....lootbasee game.
---
Fallout never has ever one time been a "loot based game"
---
You can tell because of their lack of hyping the loot system . No "16 trillion gun combinations" kind of thing. 
---
I agree that it’s just a game, switch servers and block and all that Jazz. But being bullied with no way to properly fight back gets tedious. Like if a full grown man went into a middle school and started throwing punches. Yeah they can fight back but they won’t do much to make him stop, he’s bigger and stronger. 
---
OP: it’s just dicks being dicks, don’t worry about it. 
---
If it helps to the discussion I think it would be possible to open them up separately by opening one closing the pip boy and then going back to the level up screen and it would prompt you with another one. Not sure if this is remotely what you were asking about but it's a thought. 
---
At this point I'd just keep going until 50 so you can say you did.
---
Seriously.  It's pretty cool you've gotten this far that handicapped.  
---
30% damage buff to Scorched, and is equivalent to Hardened receiver, so if your gun has a hardened receiver option, it's better to go with that unless that gun is your dedicated SBQ gun. There are other times when this is not the case though, for example there is no Gatling Gun Hardened Receiver, so putting a Prime receiver on it gives you a nice damage buff. The cost of the ammo is really high though, so I wouldn't recommend having it as your main. 
---
You would be INCREDIBLY surprised at how much you can build when you have no turrets. They take up an asinine amount of the budget.
---

---
I tend to craft weapons and give out water and ammo to lower levels. we have enough asshole in the world, Appalachia doesn't need to reflect that.
---
I'd like to go back to rocking my 2 shot, non explosive combat rifle, but was hesitant because the grind to find .45 ammo is rough enough, couldnt imagine it gets better trying to always craft the ultracite .44 rounds for it I believe
---
Shit i know i wrote this but what is the consensus on Dodgy. does it work.?
---
Well, guess what I'm looking for information on.
---
The thing I find annoying is the X-01 mods. Only one vendor has them and you can server hop all day and never find what you're looking for.
---
If you deploy them as if you're going to enter it? No. If you DROP it? Absolutely.
---
That site is awesome! Thanks for sharing. :)
---
I'd just like to be able to get the plans! 
---
You must be running scrounger!
---
Yeah guys like that usually have some 2 shot explosive weapon. (Which is probably duped). Those weapons are extreme powerful and can basically 1 shot kill anything. I hate when clowns use it for pvp it takes the fun out of it. 
---
And I think the block only blocks voice chat. As far as I know anyway
---
Will you be open tomorrow?
---
Water purifiers are glitched? 
---
My water farm operates beautifully.
---
Screenshot or video sent in to Bethesda is a nice side-dish to that plate of whup-ass you served up.
---
Losing stuff they'll just dupe again sucks but those accounts also need to go.
---
It would be funny if Bethesda was quietly tracking the duping leading up to the next patch and put them all in diapers for a month and emptied their inventory and stash. Banning being another but less amusing option.
---
Angry babies all over the map would be funny.
---
I love my Two Shot/50% Limg Damage pump. 
---
Care to run another one tommorow? I have one keycards left and I've been wanting to farm queens I can get more by the time you get on also.

I meant there is constantly a stored purifier. Xant use it or scrap it. I'm not the only one

My buddie recently got a bloodied mr handy buzzsaw blade and with the full unyielding cheese build and nerd rage he was at 200 dmg a tick

Really? I may just take you up on that, might be fun.
---
To be fair, you're supposed to be conflicted about them *because* of the tradeoffs. Which means they're working exactly as designed.
---
I have a small single level efficiency loft, with some fences on the roof (to hide behind, and so I don't fall off. Why didn't they include F4s railings!). I stopped down from a two story, and dropped a few turrets since the neighborhood seems bad and that maxed my budget. I'm level 106 or so. 
---
Maybe you have to redeploy every once in a while?
---
Yeah... You nailed it. The true grinders know whats up. I hope Beth can find a fair solution. Im sure the dupe exploit will be fixed soon anyways. We're gonna look back on this someday and laugh. 
---
I would report that. Absolutely nothing funny or acceptable about that whatsoever.

The base PA strength is overridden if you have a naturally higher than 11 Strength.

But the Garb of Mysteries can't be worn "with  your armor" as quoted from the poster above. Even just one or two pieces of legendary armor with decent stats/effects handily outclasses the single point of perception and ~40 damage resistances the Garb gives. 
---
Molotovs, don't use any other grenades
---
Lmao. Watched this about a million times with my granddaughter over the past year.
---
I would also like to know you better
---
I’m going so slow, that hopefully that’s a while in my future. 
---
Took me about 6 hours of straight hoping to find it. It's THAT rare
---
I don't think they can due to the functioning of AI and loot.  It's possible I'm mistaken, but I think "run away from the player" behavior doesn't work unless the creature is "hostile", hence all the critters defaulting to "hostile".
---
I think something similar is going on with the spawning of loot on creatures.
---
Luck determines the what you find and the condition of items.  Luck Perk cards can increase the quantity of items (i.e. Scrounger for extra ammo, Pharma Farma for Chems, etc.).
---
Charisma doesn't help with rewards at all.  It helps you with better prices and with team play.
---
Oh. That. 
---
I thought they weren't working properly but my farm pumps out water no issues.
---
I have a vampire grognak axe that shows up in my inventory as just a grognak axe. Idk. 
---
mine are character-dependent, though personally the savage divide is extremely my shit and i have to physically stop myself from just building there on every character. once my camp is down, it's usually down for good.
---
i have a raider-type unarmed character who bunkers down in the savage divide in a [nice little cabin built over a river](https://imgur.com/a/E6sZtLi).
---
i also have a blue collar tinker-type gunslinger character who's set up shop in [a garage in ash heap across the road from a red rocket.](https://imgur.com/a/xynsTKX)
---
my third character is a survivalist sniper-type who's settled on top of a pre-existing location (a little hunting stand + gun range i found between the forest &amp; the savage divide). [it's not finished yet](https://imgur.com/a/0pwfW2G).
---
There isn't a lot of strategy for SBQ. Just do damage until dead. Buff damage with food/bobbleheads/etc.
---
Orbital strikes do well when she's landed. Don't waste a lot of ammo when she's flying, her DR is much higher in that state. 
---
Or, you know, an actual server browser. So that we can re-join the same server after we got disconnected. Or hop to a different one. Or favourite one of them and make it home, and try to build a community. The server browser in games has been a thing for literally decades. 
---
Not really.  It was like that in 4 too.  That's why I never cared for PA but it's (almost) a requirement in 76.
---
Ok so for the queen don't go to the area if you don't have the ability to do meaningful damage to the queen, why? Every person that joins the quest gives her a health/DR buff and if you're not gonna dump ammo into her (or you know..fists/sledgehammers/melee of your choosing) you're not helping anyone. Don't use Plasma grenades on her when she's getting low, it can make her corpse turn into goop and that can result in people not being able to pick up loot from her. Other than that having Cryo Grenades/MIRV grenades are really good for when she lands, Cryo nades will slow down her animations and make her stay on the ground for longer and give melees more time to dish out damage. MIRV grenades just do a ton of damage, worth the investment for lobbing at her when you can. Keep an eye on your weapon condition during the fight, you can easily go through weapons during it so bring a backup if you need it (Also there's a weapons repair bench in the little shack that you exit at the end of the glassed mine that you can use but you'll have to run to it and back if they placed the nuke correctly). If you put down a Camp with a weapon repair bench in a safe place that's closer to the queen that's actually really good, helps people with this problem. Don't walk too close to people with TSE weapons, even if they have pacifist mode on (which they should during SBQ) if you walk in front of them while they're shooting and it hits you and you're close enough, you'll kill them with the proximity. 
---
Whitesprings is just kind of a hodge podge, generally you wanna roam with the group that's walking around the area and make sure you tag things, if someone starts one shotting stuff, well...maybe ask them not to so people can tag and if that doesn't work you can always just chill at one place and hope they keep rotating. Having someone join on you can make ghouls spawn, so keep that in mind if you wanna just sit outside the golf club and stack up legendary spawns. 
---
Hanvnt dropped yet if you want to join now
---
I completely agree. 
---
The good kind of clickbait lol
---
Bethesda really needs to fix their game.
---
Lol I tried doing this Christmas Eve and all 3 if those assholes I tried to help straight up ignored me.
---
1. Any way to identify chassis parts are welcome. Right now, the only way to identify the chassis I want is one has a shop skin on it, so the atom icon appears next to it.
---
2. Not sure I wanna sit &amp; watch TV inside a game.
---
3. Definitely like custom playlists, but not sure how feasible that'd be on a public server.
---
4. I would like to spawn inside my camp rather than 100 ft away from it.
---
5. OMG YES
---
6. No brainer on this one. Straight up glitch.
---
I highly recommend finding a junk pile, it's good stuff.
---
I mean, it was either there or the Bog. I just wanted to tell him why there and Whitesprings get nuked 
---
From what I saw in the loading screens, blocking is supposed to make it so they can't see you on the map. By the time I had made it home, he was wanted. I couldn't see anyone on the map when I've been wanted in the past. So I wonder what's going on here.
---
Yep, got plans for the right arm and torso from opening about 80 treasure maps I had saved up from lvl 1-120, seems like ridiculously low drop rate.
---
Shame its the shit one and not that dope green shark themed hotrod paint
---
Just use Mentats (for added intelligence) or Rad-x (to temporarily suppress the mutation) when you're crafting and you won't even notice the loss. Intelligence was kind of poorly utilized in this game because it affects very little now.
---
Is afk farming "playing"?
---
Wat is op?
---
Looks great! I like building around pylons as well. Such a cute camp setup!
---
Think that was the joke
---
The custom stations should work the same way as custom radio in gta in my opinion. Or maybe some sort of pack you create and share for people to hear. idk.
---
every item? I was having the same issue with legendary weapons.
---
I've been overencumbered since Day 1. Some of the most interesting things i've sone have involved getting sidetracked while hiking from point A to point B. 
---
I'm surprised they haven't brought out those yet 
---
Explain. Don't leave leave discussions as open ended insinuated insults, we both know you're more mature than that. Whales are present in every platform, whether we want it or not, so if I can hitch a ride on some free dlc because other players want to play dress-up and have a sims-like decor that's fine.
---
Ignoring the lunchboxes-mutations* angle, everything presented has been cosmetic from the atom shop. 
---
I want the playerbase to stay alive, to do so we need to attract a wider base/demographic than the anti social fallout community.
---
Having a "free weekend" or even a free to play model is not out of the question. I spent the cash for the tri-centenial, and would still be okay if they made it free to play down the road. 
---
Wow this comment has updates?! What happened to this sub?
---
I have a lvl 76 and im never bothered. But god forbid i go to my lvl 17 and try and go somewhere without some asshat thinking im an easy target (i am but 99% of the time i go back to camp to drop all my scrap after searching a building so im a useless kill) i have met even low level people who are just trying to hunt down weaker ones. I get its pvp but sometimes i just wanna wander and loot and only look over my shoulders for deathclaws. Not some dude with an exploding sniper up on a cliff
---
Out of curiosity what do you do for your for circuit what do you recommend?

Wait, can you actually domesticate animals now?

 *affects your rewards from Group Quests*
---
[http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_perks](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout_76_perks)
---
It effects rewards, dont know if it effects the "quantity" tho.
---
in gta, theres a folder in the root directory where you put mp3s. then it creates a radio station with them... oh shit as I was typing this I disconnected from server. Damn I had 3 workshops.
---
That’s because I understand irony and what it means, and you don’t.  
---
You get a full alphabet of neon letters aswell as all the numbers and a few symbols
---
I'm looking for the psycho recipe
---
I understand completely, I think it's crazy that that's the Meta at this point is buy a Tse from someone at any level and you are on pat with the best. I have had 4 explosives 2 of which were Tse I gave two away, sold one and bought my most recent prized possession from a non duper, he sold a Tse gauss rifle to me for 1k caps and a plan. It didn't fit his build. I personally love my bloodied assultron blade, vampires grognak, and my furious Gatlin gun. They don't mean shit in pvp. It's either I don't use my Tse gauss or nothing at all. 
---
A couple good spots for that:
---
-The cafeteria in Watoga High is full of plastic cutlery
---
-A garbage can in White Springs on the back side of the golf house has a bunch if you knock if over
---
nocturnal wood leg forever!!  
---
btw you have any plans to make any big guns?
---
But the carry weight is so low.
---
Are we sure this applies to all platforms? I maxed out my building budget around level 25; I'm currently 42 and still can't build more... 
---
Yep, I've seen this as well. Picked up some food off the table and ate it, and learned the recipe. I'm not sure if that works for all foods though, needs testing. Good thinking!
---
If it doesn't work, there's several locations with 2-3 recipe spawns, which with some server hopping produces good results. Sludge Fen is especially nice - you have typically 2 enemies at most, and usually 3 recipes right next to each other. That's where I usually end up getting Sweet Tato Stew from.
---
Also, depending on level and status, maybe look into Healing Factor mutation, it's crazy good. I was farming mutations on my older char in early 30s, and I'd be irradiating myself to near-dead, showering it off, which leaves me at very low health, and then having next dose of rads heal me via Ghoulish perk. Well, after I got Healing Factor along the way, my white health bar pretty much followed the red rads bar as they were showered off. It was CRAZY fast. Many orders of magnitude better than Tato Stew.
---
I found an actual piece of raider power armor, no plans yet though. 
---
No. Don't encourage server hopping. 
---
Server hoppers are douche bags. 
---
You know how many times I've been playing on a server for a few hours, make my way to a vendor, specifically Harper's ferry and Watoga, to unload some shit. Check the vendor. Grab some sellable from stash....
---
Oh look some jerk off server hoppers just cleaned him out. 
---
It’s 76, it’s going to crash anyway
---
Google brought me here, thanks for the write up. This answers a lot of questions.
---
&gt; That said, the production values for CAMPs are a hidden “1” for both food and water.
---
So this is 1 every 5 minutes or 12/hour? That matches the small purifier production rate (normal is 24, industrial is 60). So even if I put an industrial at my base, it will only fill as fast as a small? So all additional purifiers do is add storage so you don't have to check as often? That's what this all seems to mean if I'm reading it correctly. I suspected something like this was going on, but knowing there's a camp value production rate of 1 helps understand what's going on.
---
Thanks for sharing that and now i wonder what it effects about it.
---
/facepalm
---
The technical data on the ground is a bug unrelated to the area. It just happens sometimes when world hopping. 
---
Remember when the Fatman waa the most powererful weapon available in a Fallout game?
---
Pepperidge farms remembers
---
I'm okay for now. I'm honestly out of ammo and need to repair stuff after doing two whitesprings nukes today. Wasn't my plan personally but it is what it is. If you are down tommorow I'll send you a friend request. 
---
It's perfectly okay though. I mean fucking a man, we got to experience the human experience with modern medicine's, technology, plumbing, automobiles, interwebs, etc. I'm glad to have been here during this time period. Something tells me though that this all happens again, time will come to an end and then start over again. How else can one explain deja vu? We've been here before many many times. But where's the fun of life if we knew this? Anyways I'm burnt lmao, smoked some good buds and my brain felt like expressing. Take it easy out there.
---
Yep we play pretty much everyday lol
---
they really need sub reasons to have a skill for balance 
---
like gunsmith for example - not only does it let me craft but it lets me use my weapons longer 
---
if they added things like - scrapper chance to find random scrap in the field more often tier 2 (space bar effect) clicking on a chest has a chance to find parts for a scrap grenade a free grenade you find 
---
also some items should really be in a 0 cost category like ammo crafting perks chemist lockpick as its not hard to swap to them just tedious 
---
All i want to know is War Rider Power Armor paint, and Silver Shroud costume. And when they'll release as i want them badly lul
---
If you see calibrated shocks, buy them. No matter what. Even if you have 2 already. It's a good way to make extra caps from selling on the market forums too. I've seen them go for 3.5k caps and they usually only cost about 750.
---
Sure, add me, same IGN as the account name.
---
Ahhahahah for its effort it should still be but 76 feels different about it lol.
---
Mind you rocket launchers tickle while my TSE shotgun wipes everything in a path.

---
Are y'all Russian or Irish? I'm so confused...
---
Though tesla was bugges atm and perks aren't working properly love the tesla good for clearing trash indeed
---
I don't mind low levels there.  How do you think I leveled up both my characters?  lol
---
Yeah, I found out not long ago that weights give you lead.  Been picking them up since.  Haven't visited silos yet as I'm still exploring the rest of the map and finishing off the lower quest lines.
---
That was not very limited time....
---

When you use the plans is the electric chair hooked up to a battery?  Can you connect to a generator?

The reason why I ask is because I ran across an electric chair in an Asylum and picked up the battery before trying to sit in it.  I wonder if you sit in one hooked to a battery if you get shocked?

RIP your entire education.
---
Well, I mean, $21 is pretty ridiculous, but it's not twice the base game's price.
---
I have heard that the quality of weapons and armor is tied to luck.  
---
I think the *types* of rewards are tied to the type of creature being encountered, their level, and possibly their location. 
---
There are some perks and bobbleheads that can increase how many caps you get. I'm not sure what stat they are tied to. 
---
Charisma can help you get more caps when you sell things. 
---
YES. You get it.

I could be wrong

It's sold for around €10-11 here. So sadly it is

Depends when and how many times super duper procs. It could actually be up to 16 if you got insanely lucky and hit it three times in a row, which is unlikely, I know.
---
5 suits of PA? This guy lives overencumbered

For sure not civil war and don't think it's the witch
---
You rock!
---
I use a shotgun for this purpose. For SBQ I just use melee.
---
I'd buy that one for sure!
---
Vendor inventory is specific to a player and not shared. It's a minor bug that it appears empty to you, close the window and retrade him a few times to fix it.
---
usually faster for me to just hit them with a couple shotgun shells
---
Definitely “Join session that I just crashed from” makes sense
---
My thoughts are the same though I wonder more about arm mods on PA. If one arm had a bracer can a rusty knuckles mod be added also.
---
Excavator Armor?
---
The whitesprings trading post is actually just alot of robots on the bottom floor of the whitesprings resort all you have to do is go into the whitesprings resort and you'll come across a long hallway that has shops on both sides with different bots selling different items

Hmm, he was probably teamed up with his buddy. His buddy who wasn’t wanted, located you on the map and relayed the info to him.

Tesla is gtg in standard form.  The charging barrel  mod will crash your game if you fire it while in PA.

If the camp, how did you figure out that you could build there? Every interesting place where I have tried to build has been off limits. 
---
Diapers for a week then ban hammer.
---
Fair enough, if I were on PC I'd let you build them for me, but I'm xbox lol
---
I'm more concerned now with the minimum INT needed to craft everything in the game currently. I have decided to lower my INT to 8. With Class Freak and Egghead and Marsupial, I think I will still have an INT bonus, as you said. I just hope INT 8 isnt too small for crafting absolutely everything.
---
There's a collection point on the same deck as the workshop, down the far end
---
I just want the carry weight to work properly...lol
---
Oh, the beetlejuicing sub is when someone comments on a post somehow related to their username, almost as if the post had "summoned" them. 
---
You are SO cool, holy shit.
---
Ty. I’ll grab those if I see them. 
---
That I dont know... I just know sometimes my mats are available and after I look in my stash they are all in menu after that on my tables.
---
So is it their game now? We have to abide by their rules, wants and needs? Utter entitlement.
---
Around the camper or something? I can’t seem to find it anywhere
---
So from my linked video am I doing something wrong?
---
&gt;you're spoiling the experience!
---
Everyone plays their games differently so there is no right or wrong way to play a game, provided your actions don't negatively impact others' play.
---
No doubt.
---
I have them. Anything you're willing to trade for them?
---
Not sure which you're talking about but if it's the one on the hallway then you gotta go all the way through the vault and learn the story about the University training vault. 
---
Yeah weight is my biggest issue in game by far
---
Are you sure it was the intro music and not "The One They Fear"?  "The One They Fear" is the theme that plays when you fight dragons in Skyrim and it uses the first half of the intro theme but with more bass.  I've had a few people play that and it makes the fight a bit more interesting.  Someone once played "Despacito" there too...everyone there turned their weapons on him/her...they died quick.
---
Same thing happened to me today. Group going around doing it on xbox today 
---
Never heard of it or seen it
---
Close to one end, facing outwards, there's a large slanted hatch, like the ones you steal fertilizer from in those greenhouses near Flatwoods IIRC.
---
Same 
---
I see now
---
Makes Sense
---
Platform?
---
You can't post pics here, but just post it to r/fo76bazaar and pretend to sell it there.
---
Beautiful loved it 10/10 would read ending again.
---
Precisely that - you want to farm, do it but showing your friends to play the game the way you do is like teaching a kid to drive a car with your bad habits.
---
I checked again and I keep finding regular ones, not the black version. It appears that there are 2 spawns. One is on a table at the left row houses, another is on the floor at the 3 houses east of the row houses.
---
Don't really have any good legendaries or anything. Caps? Ign is Klabb 
---
Well, in my opinion the extra weight bonus isn’t worth the lack in damage protection in comparison to the other sets. I’m currently using T-60 with calibrated shocks, so I still have a decent carry weight, just not enough to go scavenging and be able to fast travel without using chems. It’s manageable, but irritating. Haha, I think that phrase kinda sums up the game in general though 
---
Warning The Charging Tesla Rifle Will Crash Your Game!
---
1. What platform are you playing on?
---
&gt;PC
---
2) ParaPup
---
3) [**https://youtu.be/OhCWwVDo\_K0**](https://youtu.be/OhCWwVDo_K0) Link to the example of a charged shot.
---
4) I think I finally worked it out,  
---
The cause of the crash may be from the "Charging Tesla Rifle" specifically when the charging is happening.  
---
This causes the player's bones to go into a null or Vector.Zero and I'd strong believe when a monster is attacking me this is causing massive errors and crashing the game that way.
---
5) 11844535
---
🤣
---
Oh snap!
---
If you learn where to avoid you’ll be fine. Just take your time walking around and if they start chasing you lead them to the robots. I’ve been going there since level 5
---
I got it on like my third day of hoping lol jeeze my luck
---
Maybe they could add in a wandering merchant you could buy cats for your camp from? Like the wandering merchant who would sell you a dog for your settlement in FO4. 
---
For starters, what platform are you on?
---
And also, Drive in movies are sort of a classic Kitschy Americana thing, so I'm surprised there isn't really anything going on there in 76. I was just asking really, they make cool settlements.
---
It’s a joke lol 
---
I don’t think he was trying to imply that being a girl is embarrassing, just that a high-pitched scream isn’t very manly
---
The world is like a ride in an amusement park, and when you choose to go on it you think it's real because that's how powerful our minds are. The ride goes up and down, around and around, it has thrills and chills, and it's very brightly colored, and it's very loud, and it's fun for a while. Many people have been on the ride a long time, and they begin to wonder, "Hey, is this real, or is this just a ride?" And other people have remembered, and they come back to us and say, "Hey, don't worry; don't be afraid, ever, because this is just a ride." And we … kill those people. "Shut him up! I've got a lot invested in this ride, shut him up! Look at my furrows of worry, look at my big bank account, and my family. This has to be real." It's just a ride. But we always kill the good guys who try and tell us that, you ever notice that? And let the demons run amok … But it doesn't matter, because it's just a ride. And we can change it any time we want. It's only a choice. No effort, no work, no job, no savings of money. Just a simple choice, right now, between fear and love. The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your doors, buy guns, close yourself off. The eyes of love instead see all of us as one. Here's what we can do to change the world, right now, to a better ride. Take all that money we spend on weapons and defenses each year and instead spend it feeding and clothing and educating the poor of the world, which it would pay for many times over, not one human being excluded, and we could explore space, together, both inner and outer, forever, in peace.

---
Oh yeah haha, PC. 
---
yeah i know exactly what you mean, can not craft anything until looked in stash to see the loading content circles disappear. This "feature" disappeared for me before Bethesda went to Xmas Holidays. Maybe patched, maybe less server load, dunno, at least its working as intended (PC here)
---
When you go to build the Tesla rifle it’s under heavy so I’m pretty sure it needs heavy gunner. 
---
I'll take a pair you still on?
---
Its mainly for people who make shops and have the supply of caps 
---
Level 15
---
Bug. I've done 90% of the damage on a mob before, and had my friend hit it once and get the xp and loot while I didn't. 
---
I was level five the first time I went there. I was with my level 24 friend who had been there in real life. So he gave me a tour helped get some xp and stuff from the shops. Then we went to the tennis court and went in the long building. That’s where I faught my first windego at level 5
---
Thank you very much
---
I did this every time I wandered/spawned into a nuke zone, while I couldn't contribute much to damage, I was always ready with a stimpack and I could keep some of the adds off.
---
this is kind of depressing
---
Thank you very much btw
---
Hehehehe saw this the other day and realised that's a fucking year of playing and I've almost clocked out 300 hours
---
I blocked the player and left eventually. It was more confusion than anything. Was trying to figure out if it was a bug on losing caps or an exploit. After 3 times I was convinced it was the latter. 
---
Around 400 hours I started helping randoms do tasks or help people on my friends list who had to re-roll due to bugs. Other than that I would just kill ghouls at WSR for a chance at Legendary loots, or seek Wanted players on the map. Been about it for me til the first major update we are waiting on.
---
Yes. 
---
If I get a chance to trade between my characters, I’ll make a bunch of stews and have my alt binge on them. If that fails, I’ll check out Sludge Fen!
---
I’d like Healing Factor, but I draw a line for RNG stuff in games. All too often I’m just spamming one sequence over and over trying to get something the game just doesn’t want to give me. I’m lucky enough to have gotten Talons and Speed Demon, I think I’ll Serum the rest.
---
Hate to break it to you but it is.
---
Do you think ppl repeatedly drop nukes and kill the queen for story reasons?
---
Was entertained, Karma given.
---
They forgot to add them lmao
---
Bugged
---
I have the perk where I can repair power armor to 200% of its normal durability. Been using the excavator armor and have gottan into some major-pitched battles with various nasties. Have barely needed to repair it. 
---
On a similar note, having 2 levels of the perk that causes weapons to self-repair on occasion is really helpful. 
---
I know him
---
Also to add, I’ve been killed without even fighting back, instantaneously
---
You still up for it?
---
That's cool he runs the town
---
The only griefing I've ever experienced so far was when I nuked whitesprings and a party took the area over and was killing anyone else that went in.  
---
 What's funny is I only had to kill one once to grab the ridiculous amount of junk they dropped, then I hopped servers.
---
It's an open world, characters can go wherever they want.   Don't like it?  Server hop.
---
I carry level 1 hazmat suits in case I see low levels in the area. ‘Trust me, you’ll want this one day’
---
That's the best idea, I remember being terrified and not wanting to do the quests there as a lowlife because you get swarmed so damn fast. Lowering the spawn rate would make it easier by both making it a little less "I'll die for sure" and less appealing to nuke.
---
Yes sir
---
I hate scum bags. Sorry it happened to u. To bad u didnt save a recording
---
I hope they the add them though I haven't seen anywhere that they will be tho
---
Etiquette is the only bases you are encouraged to destroy are ones on that golf course.
---
I am ignorant please don’t abuse me for my question. 
---
Could this be a mod?
---
No problem bro 
---
I think you're right 
---
Fyi whitespring station NE of the actual resort shares its cap pool with the vendors inside.
---
Also the vendor gear inside is set and doesn't change so going in repeatedly isn't that useful besides finding stuff ppl sold to the vendors
---
Two shit explod
---
Does it work on all pa?
---
Yeah, it wasn't even a run of the mill supermutant or something, it was a Wendigo. So it took a few shots to get it that low.
---
There are some quests that i had to relog to see the marker on the map
---
How full is your stash?
---
Do you have tonnes of weightless items in there?
---
Are you overweight?
---
Not at all.  I've got like 3k+ right now after previously dumping 3k for weight reasons.  If you don't use them actively (I don't, they suck for damage) they pile up after a few hours of killing.
---
Yeah, the RNG on that is absolutely brutal. But this whole game is RNG. The loot, there's a huge difference between Two Shot Explosive and everything else. Even perks, some of my chars got amazing ones every 5 levels, while my current char got the worst crap possible - at lvl 40 I still haven't used a single card that I didn't manually pick. Even buying serums is still RNG, gotta server hop a lot to get the vendor to sell you one. So, comparatively speaking, fishing for mutations isn't out of line from the rest of the game. The key is not to get greedy. I'm looking for Talons serum myself though, because I'm sitting at 5 good ones, and the odds of picking up something devastating are uncomfortably high.
---
I’m currently saving up. I have a feeling it is either nuclear material or some mini-nukes.
---
I feel excluded in your deduction being 305
---
Ease of plans? T51b are some of the most difficult plans to find barring Utracite from the queen.
---
Misleading when alts are a thing.
---
I can twink out my alt easily
---
You'll spend a bit of your free time getting yet more screws, springs and such.  It never, ever, ends!  The scrapping, junk collecting...
---
Thanks for the legs - you made my day :)
---
I got a feeling we'll get other sealed suits before they ever allow normalarmor in nuke zones
---
Looks really cool.  I love how you integrated the stairs into the house and landscape.  
---
One question, why did you run the electrical along the floor instead of the wall or ceiling?  Is it because you would need a longer run and the budget is near the max?  
---
Mine is just a basic shack at the moment.  I really do need to start working on something like this.
---
In the offline games I seem to play through them and then outfit or build a really nice retirement home for my character near the end, once I have a ton of CAPS, etc. saved up.  I did this in Skyrim, all of the other Fallouts, etc.  I guess I like to think that my character then lives out the rest of his days in comfort...
---
I still think that they should add a map where you can homestead.  It would be nice to have good neighbors to play a game of Blast Radius...  .grin.
---
I helped low-level player couple of times in Whitesprings, but let's be honest: you can farm XP almost anywhere when you're below level 50, but up from there Whitesprings is basically your only choice and low-level ghouls are effectively reducing your XP/min and legendaries/min output. 
---
How 
---
Tehehehehe. Bro. I'm telling my guy that one
---
I don’t have a TSE gun, but if I see someone with a bounty, I try to go fight them.
---
Yup. Ppl split hairs over the numbers when in reality the hidden rad res is key.
---
Also ppl ignore chems.
---
Did you know in x01 any rad resistant chems are obsolete as it can't go lower than 2 rad per second
---
Thank you for the advice. You rock
---
Damn youtubers.
---
What’s even a bigger joke is that when you’ve put in all of those hours and complete the challenge you a grand total of like 40 atoms.
---
Did you know if you play with friends and run rad sponge your don’t have to worry about Rads?..just level one card?
---
I am Zuul
---
I was so grateful when I found the plans to make stimppacks and healing salves. At least now I can make as many as I have the mats for. 
---
Bloodied builds easily do it.
---
Iirc bloodied is up to 80% boost. Nerd rage is another 25% and i forget what adrenal reaction adds
---
YES 
---
Now that is a good read
---
Tab-T-2-pick a lock-Tab-T-1, every bloody time. 
---
I don't understand how people play it on consoles without Perk Loadout Manager mod. I expect Bethesda would eventually make them cost zero or make them passive. It just makes no sense to constantly swap them.
---
There is no official mod support yet &amp; the current non-official mods can't been seen by anyone other than the person running the mod since there's no way for that non-official information to be sent to the server &amp; then sent to all other players
---
If you considered fallout 76 your full time job and did it for 8 hours a day, Monday to Friday, it would take you 3.65 years to complete this challenge.
---
Fucking insane 
---
I have varied experiences.  I usually play for 5-6 hours, on PS4, with no issue, then it'll crash a few times n a row.
---
Turn it back on and find out....
---
Nah it's just like a computer freezing and restarting. You're fine, it's the game that isn't. 
---
Well it's 316 days so yeah that's just fucking stupid
---
I've been waiting for your validation so long u/Encontra. I'll have a sweet sigh of relief upon my death knowing you knew how fucking cool I was. 
---
Sadly most ppl have problems sticking with the boring endgame grind.
---
My group of 4 is just me now.  I made an alt after farming for 50+ hours on nukes and whitespring.
---
I do know though.
---
Get the marsupial mutation, you can jump away higher and than shoot, that will help with avoiding blowing yourself up.
---
Try under one of the electric pylons East of Morgantown. I have a solo wild cat spawn in my base quite often, I seem to have a random critter spawn right where my house is. I get Young Radstags, Toads, Cats, Chicken and Squirrels. I think that's it.
---
What did you do to get banned?
---
Well I'll see you on the other side when I get this trophy by December 20th. sleep shall be rationed accordingly food shall become Jon essential and water will be stored fractionally
---
Yeah end game is only fun with friends...
---
Thats great timing
---
What if there already attacked to both legs 
---
Np. There are some neat plans in there but a load screen is a load screen lol.
---
Most plans are cosmetic. Furnitures etc.
---
Tips for how to stalk someone back to their base? 😈
---
I loved the Goblin Slayer ending!
---
Here’s a pic [photo ](https://imgur.com/a/0sMDF5a) 
---
I've heard people say if the camp budget is full they have no tame option? Is this true or should I fill my camp to the brim first before hunting?
---
Except in the mines lol, you dont take fall damage from that though?
---
Are you the keymaster?
---
Haha yeah that’s my plan just sprint back to the sentry bot with 10 level 50 ghouls chasing me and let him finish them off while I watch them die all smug. 
---
Very unlikely its another player but server disconnects are very common.
---
I'll buy the legs if they're level 50.  I currently have one with kinetic servo and one with optimized servo could trade.
---
I know this.  But a pacifist, which is the closest thing to opting out of PvP, cannot fully opt out, which is my point.
---
A regular player can complete the handshake by attacking back, and can defend himself (balance issues aside), and it's assumed that they're open to that idea because they have pacifist off.  A pacifist's only option, besides waiting to die or for their attacker to get bored, is to relocate or server hop or block users.
---
I don't misunderstand how the system works.  The system, in general, is just not competitive, as it should be for PvP, it's griefy.  Which was the point of my post.
---
I msged my mate who sesh joined me on cod 2 F off 
---
He was using an sg12 strobe light :/ 
---
Regular .44 caliber revolver 
---
Revolver
---
Try running a .38 receiver on the combat rifle. While the mods can only be found on vendors, the damage output of the rifle is only lowered by  around 10% or 15%. This gives you almost triple the dps compared to the pipe rifle with the only downside being 2x weight and exclusion from the pipe gun Intellect perk. Maybe that is why .38 is so precious to me lol.
---
The bean we need but don’t deserve 
---
Hopping on now, do you have the flux I can provide everything else plus some caps 
---
Yes there level 50 but I'm good on x01 legs I just have the planned learned and sell the legs 
---
How is it not there?
---
I think its a dumb spot lol
---
The nuclear reward gives you a random 1 star legendary. 
---
Absolute waste of time and candy.
---
Clearly you wanted -someone's- validation, because nobody writes arrogant bullshit like that unless they're deeply insecure.
---
Whooosh
---
I did that but then tried to shoot the Gouls so I could get xp and loot. I used a shotgun and shit the sentrybot. ‘Twas a sad day
---
I have no regrets buying it earlier. I’ve gotten a lot of mileage out of it and it beats my old tattered dress. 
---
Now I’d only they’d take the swimmer’s cap off and show my hair...
---
if you want to find a normal trading post follow the rails
---
Doesn't sound like a mate if he reported you lol 
---
Happened to me also people have figured out how to make you become wanted and then procede to kill you for bounty.....
---
Welcome to FO76
---
I have sat multiple times with 5+ players farming the golf course, it turned into an endless spawning ground for 15+ minutes, but when the one shot crew shows up I've always gotten kicked I dont know if it's a glitch, my internet(10mbps average, started the game about 2mbps and no issues), or the game, but it happens every time without fail.
---
A cool idea would have a liberty prime power armor set you can wear that makes you look like him and has random patriotic dialogue. 
---
Hybrid builds are trash. They are sub par in everything and great at nothing. 
---
I hope not
---
You clearly have no concept of what arrogance even is kid. My statement is true and assholishly stated because I tried being nice being you sensitive cunts didn't like that either. 
---
Yah, I've had some people explain this too me as if I don't get it or it changes what I'm trying to say.  Iono.
---
I just want the overall experience to be good for everyone, and I don't think this system is the best way to achieve that.  Being "slapped" endlessly by a PvP player I can't attack back (unless I turn pacifist off, and I'm not interested in PvP, especially considering balance issues), and having to heal or leave, isn't my idea of a good time.
---
I got auto banned I've been banned twice b4 
---
he didnt even see the msg
---
&gt; double blade for the doubled ticks
---
Wait wha? That’s a thing? The dual bar mod causes it to tick twice as much? As in, it doubles the damage?
---
Wow, that's not too bad. And it wasn't even a bloody or two shot, or explosive. I can only imagine if it was. Going to try get one now lol
---
Yikes.
---
Easiest solution - get rid of all legendaries effects on guns and armor when you PvP 
---
No disrespect to you OP, and I do agree I would love that as well, but that being said what happened to the retired post list, there was supposed to be a master list of frequently posted suggestions to make room for others, yet it seems like every day I see something like this or the infamous ability to rename power armor chassis
---
How much?
---
no, I actually tried. I'm level 64 and I went to the Bog and got a Scorchbeast to land so I could try, it doesn't work.
---
all i see are people with two shot explosive handmades
---
Dammit, was willing to shell out the caps and weapons for that, the fire rate with speedy and martial artist coupled with furious is my dream non explosive Gatling gun.
---
This is the best reddit post I’ve read today. Haha
---
Welllll shit. I'm on PS4. Sorry friend, hope you get those plans. For what it's worth, I got them by doing events at the Prison. Hope you can get it there too!
---
I don't have enough, but there is a SBQ on my world if you need to gather some.
---
Are you on ps4 or xbox? Xbox does not auto scan messages, it has to be manually reported for action to be potentially taken. I'm sure pc doesn't even a comm ban system. 
---
Just here to point out the irony that these folks have quite the country club attitude
---
Ah some other time then, dont really have time to play at the moment.
---
Participated in successfully kinky SBQ 3 times in the last week.
---
Depends on what you’re specced into.  Heavy weapons, shotguns, rifles, melee?
---
Typically different players fill various roles in the effort.  Distance weapons while in the air, then everyone goes to town when she lands.  
---
Sometimes a few players may have super OP weapons and blast her out of the sky in minutes.  So it helps to have a ranged weapon to tag her for loot.  
---
Currently I’m running a .50 cal, a handmade w/ drum mag, All Rise sledge, and Grognaks axe.  Sometimes I’ll mix in a suppressed gauss rifle or a Tesla rifle.
---
Personal experience, Gatling plasma/laser &amp; miniguns break stupid fast for me.  Like, lucky to empty one mag fast.
---
I also stay away from using explosives.  There is (was?) a bug where explosives increased SBQ health.  Making her unkillable.  Also, the area is a clusterf*** of people.  
---
Quality content.
---
Its turning off to save itself from doing damage.
---
That is not common
---
I should go to bed.
---
None kept, but i can grab you the gatling energy weapons or track some down in return.
---
How much?  I have Adrenal Mutation Serum if you're interested. 
---
I’m telling mother
---
Ya, imagine if someone didn't know what endgame means and started a thread telling people the endgame is reading terminals. he'd probably delete the thread in embarrassment...
---
Here’s the thing though, even if it’s true, the duper’s wouldn’t care. All you did was waste a couple minutes of their time.
---
Did read again, still 10/10
---
Yes 
---
It works on PS4, I got it from a workshop event...
---
Absolutely nailed it dude!
---
Step your game up
---
I'd love to buy the station, but I gotta save up in case the Blackbird paint comes back.
---
Same. Losing the caps means nothing, having greifers running their exploits who can potentially ruin others playtime... that is what’s infuriating. Thanks for the kind words 
---
Yeah I hear that, and a certain amount is ok, it’s just that mutations via rads are excessively so. Plus I had a rather unfortunate incident where I got speed demon, got excited, and ran on autopilot right back through the decon arches...yeah. Pure random luck gave it back to me, and I’m right where you are, fearing a truly crap mutation.
---
I look at it this way. Serums are merely a cap grind. I prefer a slower yet more guaranteed grind. And I can take the server hopping for the right serum. What I can’t is taking rads and seeing freaking Empath showing up yet again.
---
The game really needs this, it just slows down the gunplay. If I wanna switch weapons due to an empty clip, let me instead of forcing me into a 2 second reload animation. It also blocks you from using any hotbar item, so you can't stimpack yourself if you are stuck in a reload animation...
---
Oh jeez, THIS camp, haha. Happened upon it at lvl 6ish, assumed it was bethesda showing how the overseer upgraded/possibilities for your own camp. I took some things, killed the brahmin. It wasn't until I tried to go into the interior that I was alerted by the game that this all belonged to a player. Got myself a ten cap bounty, PKed in like 15 minutes of gameplay lol. It made me reconsider where I'm placing my own camp. If .BEAN wants revenge, I'm kittocatsu. :D
---
Rank 3 white knight so I don't spend more time farming to repair my armour than using it
---
That’s why I think those posts are tedious and Annoying 
---
The plans have the correct name now
---
That’s definitely one
---
oh no worries! I don't really need them anyway
---
badass!!!!
---
How is this helpful to the question?
---
No the PS4 servers are stupidly unstable
---
Well yeah but if you are going for best time on Queen then what's the point. I get it. It's meta. I can two shot them with my gauss but that's not what I was asking. It also helps to have other stuff help with the queen, mirelurk and scorched don't mix, same with deathclaws. 
---
Stashbox paedophillia. 
---
1. get a tesla gun or molov and tag all ghouls in the door and let the turets do the job
---
2. run in and simply close the rear door of the golfclub...
---
3. pic up the 3 wokrshop destroyer card and demolish his base. after 2-3 atempt he will move it.
---
Like maybe the guy playing the guitar in the newest mad max while we drive into fury road aka blast zone?    Witness me!!!!
---
My first foray into the FO universe was FO3 followed by NV, then followed by several years of replaying both.  Both are better than FO4, but its still better than 76.  It would be fun to try FO1 somehow.  In respect to the Elder Scrolls series, my first was Oblivion, and many people say Morrowind was superior.  
---
I’ve been seeing a lot of wood armor dropping lately
---
Getting these things to land is a pain, I play a melee tank/healer build for my team and I feel so useless fighting Scorchbitches. I do carry a ranged weapon just for these occasions, as I read that you need to do a little damage to make them land.
---
But they just hover and spam sonic shit at me while I do very little damage until all my armour is busted and I have to run.
---
I've read all the tips and tried going to clearer/wider areas etc, I guess I just have bad luck.
---
I just run from them now, or log out, I don't even bother trying to wait it out anymore.
---
Here come the piss bottles
---
You can sell them to vendors if you want but I believe Bethesda has mentioned that player buy and sell will be coming in a future update so I hope it comes sooner than later as I have a number of them I wouldn't mind giving to other people for cheap.
---
Warning to all the people who download: Make sure you have the mod installed but also make sure nobody knows you're using it just as a precaution!
---
Sneak + Handmade TSE made it super easy.  This is the 2nd time I've done it and it's a blast, literally.
---
Nice down vote cunt. I at least respect your opinion enough to let it be. You're the typical weak little cunt that has to hit the down button whenever you disagree. That's not when you should downvote, that's reserved for when the opinion is irrelevant or off topic. 
---
I thought it was hilarious change from all the seriousness
---
Can imagine a tse quad hunting rifle 
---
Okeydokes. Thanks again!
---
Do you remember which workshop you were at
---
It happens to me quite often in a nuked whitesprings, I think theres just to much going on  at once  for the ps4 to handle
---
works on t45, t51, t60, and x01
---
doesn't work on on excavator, and probably doesn't work for the ultracite or raider
---
They are just about the stupidest animal that exists... they break into trash cans and get stuck in there, run out in from of cars, etc. one winter we had a sweet owl that was hanging around my back yard, come spring no more red squirrels.....tons of owl pellets in my backyard though. 
---
I just want someone to walk into my camp and suddenly hear dueling banjos. "Yeah come on in and use my work bench purty lips." 
---
I used the military cap, veil, and Patrolman glasses. Very chic.
---
I hate to agree. I have a feeling this was left out for this reason. 
---
Go pasificst!
---
My guess is the same dimwit that runs our local DMV.  All joking aside, I thought it was funny.
---
Still not fixed. Wish I’d knew about this before I wasted points on the perk card
---
My friends just turned lv 15 and i made them full raider power armor sets so i could bring them to nuke zones.
---
I don't know, but I have found them around the map before with things other than what would be considered dropped loot from a death but no player nearby on the map.
---
I don't know.
---
They disappear after they've been looted. Do not try to add something to them if you cleared out a bag someone dropped for you. It will disappear along with the contents you added, from my experience. 
---
Another anecdote: my husband and I found someone's camp and were trying to give them bobbleheads we weren't using. They logged out and it took our bags with their camp. Not sure if it ever came back with their next login or anything.
---
I love that mask! I've only seen my husband in that mask and one other person.
---
Protip: if you run across the courtyard, directly across from the DMV door there's a half buried bus that leads to an entrance that puts you almost right on top of the quest destination without having to go through (as many) Mutants.
---
with combination of bird bones and equips that reduce fall damage reduced it to almost nothing unless your falling from a very high building, very high cliff, ect
---
10million atoms (On sale)
---
Explosive flamers actually arnt bad. You should be able to fetch some caps if you arnt going to use it
---
but why? it's not fun, it doesn't make the game harder, just more annoying. there is 0 benefit from a gameplay perspective to have stuff like lock picking and hacking need to be essentially toggled on and off when needed. 
---
you do not seem to have the mutation serums as items in the aid category, there seems to be an option to add an item to the list, but when i try to post that item i get a generic error code.
---
*Crying in low budget camp*
---
Maybe radioactive birds. Idk, could be cool lol
---
Stops low levers from writing penis and balls on their house like I did 
---
Sweet, a goblin slayer reference! 
---
&gt; “Are there ghouls?”
---
Hahahahaha.
---
Are tou on ps4? I have am ill give em to ya
---
This is old but I got a Kristen Bell vibe from her. Just started doing her quests yesterday and had to see if someone else thought this.
---
It's not fun, it's tedious. It's also super duper great when the game crashes and forces you to start over. 
---
It'd be more "fun" if, you know, it wasn't a glitchy quest and a lack of crashes.
---
For some reason the the vendors at Harpers Ferry and Watoga station are no longer selling the barn building set plan..... I just got mine by claiming a workshop about an hour ago ! 
---
If hes not may i get them?
---
I would pay up to 7.5k for this if you were on ps4
---
Thanks but I’m pc
---
Also, what about bobble head and collectible display stands? Would be really awesome
---
I maxed Lead Belly as soon as I could. I felt like when I first started the game I couldn't find anything to eat that didn't give me rads and seeing red on my health bar bugs me for some reason. Now i don't worry about it. 
---
Ghoulish with shared  radsponge combo. Always full health and rad free in blast zones.
---
Dude! Thanks! Upvote for you! Lol already made a post there.
---
Just a heads up, Friendly Fire might not be as effective as you hope. I leveled it up to two stars. The healing was pretty minor, so it was tedious and used up LOTS of fuel.  
---
Another great one
---
Damn, would've been nice to know when I found almost a full set of level 40 when I was level 15. Will pass the info onto others. 
---
Honestly cannibal just to switch to when I'm hungry and there is no camp fire ghouls super mutants and mole men are everywhere
---
Can you still fly with bird bones?
---
This happens more times than you think and not just at workshops happened to me 4 times so far in my games on 2 dif chars. So frustrating when they dont land.
---
Same with the dumpster plan. 
---
I like wood armor as a backup to my power armor, it's fairly light and protects you when you're out of PA doing your thing and not expecting to get hit.
---
The atom shot has at least one... so ya. 
---
No prob man sorry
---
Lul
---
Yeah he is on pc so its yours. Had I known people were wanting them I would have saved the other three I had. I actually just picked this one up when I seen this post. Add me PSN Raulsegovia357
---
do you happen to know any random spawns for mothman? I would assume wander around cranberry bog since its the highest level area.
---
Im 8/10, level 90 and LIVE at whitesprings. That quest is stupid. 
---
Add me 
---
I need to spend more time in the ash heap.  Any recommendations to start?
---
I feel bad for everyone who encounters these types of exploits. When it happens to me it’s irritating but I know I’ll still log in the next day and brush it aside but who knows if the next person will? We have a great community of players across all platforms who wish to bring other players up and help out but with this blatant glitching and grieffing we could loose great people whom won’t look past these things and just leave indefinitely :(
---
Well there was the limited blackbird paintjob back then. I think the atom shop has the hotrod ones today.
---
That Escalated quickly.
---
Your website seems to be down.
---
I only know of the ones in the atom shop, i have the patriot on mine
---
&gt; Piss drawers
---
FTFY
---
Pretty sure you can just take off the prototype bumblebee look it comes with to a "standard" one that looks more normal. Other than that, every atom shop power armor skin (except the festive t51b) has an x-01 variant
---
PC, sorry
---
Bloody mess is pretty much a must its a straight 15% boost in damage. Plus who does not want to have things explode in a blood mess.
---
&gt;mama mothman
---
You mean mothra?
---
You are not wrong. Whitespring is still in the newbie part of the map. Thats why the mob level is capped a like 68, and you never see a level 90 ghoul there. 
---
You want to dump some shotgun shells and 5.56 in my stash box? Because I’ve never heard of anyone drowning in those. If you use your guns regularly you run out of those no matter how much ammosmithing or super dupering you do. .308 is for low level players with hunting rifles and is the most commonly dropped ammo.
---
It is West Virginia 
---
Go to whitesprings, tag things (shoot them) as other players kill them. 
---
Yeah, me too. But this happens to me when I’m walking around, even just in my camp. Some guy comes in and blows me away in one shot with an explosive shotgun. It’s a little irritating that grieving exists in this game 
---
I’ll take shotty and 5.56 if you have it. 
---
Www.caps.city is working as far as I can tell. 
---
However: I’m working on fixing the DNS settings to allow caps.city without the www 
---
Don't let a few low IQ inbreds ruin your game.  For those that might be able to read (doubt it) here's how to not be a douche in Whitesprings:
---
1. Don't put your @#$@#$ base behind the clubhouse.  I will literally stand by the back door for hours closing it so you can't farm, while drinking your organic, decaf, double soy, latte. (Here's looking at your Civif)  I personally hope this disallow building in this area.
---
2. Don't use a legendary 3\* exploding anything on the green slime guys.  If you do, then you take away someone else chance to collect gear.  Instead use a crappy melee or hell a pistol and tag the mobs.   This insures you get to loot and gives others a chance to as well.  I regularly run around with a crappy combat rifle, tag a group of mobs and drag them to other players so they can get a chance to loot.  It's called not being a dick.  Give it a try.
---
By and large the current FO76 community is relatively decent.  
---
Think you just have to hold the action button its e on pc
---
They should just make enemies level area based, the farther you go from vault 76 the higher level enemies get.
---
I hate the fact that my level 18 friend has to deal with level 40+ enemies when he doing rose's quest just because i'm with him.
---
Not sure on console whatever interact or loot button is
---
I went there earlier today to look for some plans, I’m  level 22. I get the holotape quest while I’m there and decide I might as well knock it out while I’m there. Get all the ones inside and go to find the ones outside when I run into some pretty high level players standing outside the cabin. Well they must have been coming up with a game plan to go into the cabin cause I wonder past them going in and IMMEDIATELY  haul ass back out being chased by a hoard of wendigos and level 60 charred ghouls . I run into the bus in shock of what just happened while they swarmed the high level players and I get pop shots in when I can. They eventually cleaned house and I went to collect my holotape in peace. So if you’re reading this, thank you for saving this noobs life. 
---
Looks like the 3rd star was giving you a stroke on that last line.
---
For mods?
---
So basically just damage them and then let other players finish them up?
---
Great find!! I will add mutation serums and remove the ability to add. Originally I wanted to have people be able to add items I didn’t have listed, however, this freedom seems to breed disorganized chaos. :D
---
HI there, Kodemar, from the Charleston Herald. 
---
How do you respond to the allegations that your "Enclave" was secretly running the United States before the bombs fell and are ultimately responsible for the mess the world is today?
---
Actually no, there's just a fuckton of .38, I pick up all ammo because I'm stupid, and I don't use pipe weapons.
---
Tug sausage intensely
---
Could be worse.
---
Absolutely agree
---
Ad Victoriam brother... Ad Victoriam.  I do the exact same thing, with much of the same response.  :)
---
That was it, thank you. New to this, haha.
---
Hold X on PS4 to exit Power Armor
---
I don't think anyone has a problem with lowbies in Whitespring.
---
It's lowbies with turret camps farming high level ghouls that people have an issue with. Rightly so.
---
In white springs theres a garden with a bus next to it at one of the entrances and to the right is an alley way with cars and a building to the left. Usually there are high level ghouls towards the back of the parking space so i would tag them from a distance and run to the garden so the robots kill them for you, but be careful cause just tapping a robot with your weapons will aggro them all.
---
“As somebody who had ridden a missile I can tell you it’s pretty cool”
---
When I navigate to https://www.caps.city/users/svitakboy/items/new I get a "We're sorry, but something went wrong" message." That was happening for all pages earlier.
---
Maybe ghoulish and radsponge is better but I use the perk (not sure of the name) that gets rid of rads during the day
---
Well said. We share the same stance, I can brush these things off (was getting close to max caps) but I can see how someone who is having a bad day and want to escape, only to be treated in such a way can be put off. I’ll continue to block if I have to, only because of the amazing community that has helped me and my wife along the way
---
Sure if you're on PC my handle is apsyse.
---
A real wasteland Steve Irwin, aren't you?
---
Sounds to me like you’re just a wanted man. Across 12 star systems, no less. 
---
Right. 
---
I think I got mine claiming or defending Tyler Country Fairgrounds. 
---
Mods are not supported and there's a chance you can be auto-banned by their cheat detectors looking for third party programs.
---
It’s just so that you can see how many house you’ve played. Just like what Steam does. 
---
I was in Whitesprings last night buying a Nuka Cola Grape when a nuke was launched, stepping outside the door and accidentally got the "Ground Zero" achievement.  My body was left in a pile of glowing ash. Lol
---
Yeah can someone please provide these? I’m on PS4. I bought them from graham, even read them!!!! But I guess the game glitches out and I can’t build it. Spent like 900 caps for it too ;(
---
Two shot and quad can't be on the same weapon, no two prefixes can 
---
Sorry, what's wrong with full melee?
---
I used Bowler Hat for a while and recently changed to Witch Hat
---
It's not easy being green... Dames with shotguns be bamboozling...
---
Join on me
---
You lose caps when you die to pvp, generally roughly around your level's worth
---
Was this on X-Box? Might of been me. I got a team request and couple trade requests. Then I server hopped looking for a nuked White Springs.
---
there’s a place southwest of flatwoods called New Gad, not a great place for XP but there’s a key for a safe there, and once you open the safe there’s usually pretty interesting/good loot inside. found a laser pistol, syringer, laser rifle. oh there’s also a pump shotgun in one of the houses and plenty of ammo/junk around. 
---
You did it! You beat the game!
---
If you use shotty or 5.56 and fight level 70 supermutants and scorched, you run out of ammo. The tinkerer bench is not just a cool fun thing put in the game just for giggles, it’s literally there so you don’t run out of ammo. Also, you are by no means the delegator or expert of the right and wrong ways to play the game.
---
Sorry, I was pushing an update and it must’ve broken things temporarily. 
---
Just restarted the dyno. 
---
Tested and working again. :D
---
Thanks for the update.  Saves me time trying to figure it out.
---
Yeah I got the bear tonight but now I want to hurt myself because of all the angry sounds he makes....non-stop I might add.  How the @$#$@# do I release him or kill him even?
---
I always forget about that feature. Never had a vita so it wasn't on my radar often to begin with, but still sounds cool.
---
I approve. Reminds me of scoring of time. Maybe we could have certain song buffs too!
---
What system are you on? I have yet to experience this issue. Maybe there is a corrupted item in your inventory. I’ve had to drop duplicate apparel and head  gear (not dupes, I carry extra to give out to wandering players) because it glitches my character.  
---
I had this issue in my latest CAMP for some reason. At the first CAMP I just had to walk up to the Water Purifier and take the water as  you do with claiming anything from a container. With the second CAMP, after I took the first lot of water it looked like there was none being produced for ages until I clicked on 'Transfer' (as you do with Power Armour and Stash Boxes). The water was in there and I had to transfer it. After that it has worked normally the original way. Some kind of bug. 
---
I took a picture, but it won’t let me post it? I’m sorry... I’m not sure that it’s a hallway, per say. There’s a lighted sign above the door that says Maintenance and a box next to it that has a circular red light and, I assume, an unlit circular green light. I believe it says Overide underneath the lights. 
---
Yes, power armor mods, specifically Calibrated Shocks.
---
Thanks for posting this. I need as much feedback as possible!! :D 
---
I know the meaning of the sub but this actually what I do. 
---
I've also taken to crafting some level 1 brotherhood recon rifles and tossing them some .308 to get them started and pointing them towards the start of the BoS questline if they feel so inclined. :)
---
Only if they cap melee damage as well. I think it would be fair to have it capped at what a 2 shot non explosive shotgun is capped at, dont you think?
---
I think calling it a "fundamental design concept" is giving it a bit too much credit.  PvP was crammed into an obviously PvE game.  It's basically the Fallout 4 experience with most NPCs removed and other players present.  Questing and exploring and looting, PvE, is the fundamental design concept, PvP is just there, and it isn't smoothly melded with the PvE exerience.
---
Opting out completely, and becoming invincible to PvP, may be experience-breaking for PvP players, but they are seeking an entirely different experience that PvE players want *no part of*.  It interrupts what they're trying to do with something they aren't interested in and aren't geared/specced to deal with.
---
Those experiences just don't mesh well together, and the game's fundamental design clearly favors PvE.  Yet PvP is actually given some priority over PvE, since there is no way to fully opt out.  The best way to handle this would be to give PvE and PvP players separate servers.  PvE and PvP players could enjoy their respective experiences without disappointing or frustrating each other.
---
I'm surpried PvP players in general aren't more vocal about getting separate servers.  They want to fight other players, surely they all aren't interested in just ganking everyone and harassing pacifists.  Unless that just is what most of them want.  In which case... I kinda don't see any need to cater to them over PvE players.
---
Just learn to play a real steel guitar and practice with your mic open. :D
---
I'm on the ps4. How would I check for something corrupted?
---
Yeah, the quest is called "Moleminers, Mutants, and Mininukes"
---
Why my peepee become hard?
---
He needs some serious help
---
Fallout 76's has the opposite effect on me. When I hit a perk pack level, I find that I'm less likely to be excited and level up right away. I'd rather just pick my perk and move on, but now I've got to wait through all the card animations.
---
It's an honor and a privilege.
---
I have my camp right on the river there and the turrets don't reach the building. How close was he?
---
Mannequins for clothing display
---
Even without engaging in PvP? I thought that would be counted as murder, making him wanted, and it never happened. 
---
Just get a TSE handmade and all the Rifleman perks + explosive mastery perks and you got yourself an unkillable God (except suicide by shooting your own feet, shooting something too close, or being brain dead. The company responsible for making the handmade is not responsible for your mistakes with the gun.)
---
Hmm this doesn't sound right. You are giving technically to locals that haven't had proper training. Sounds like you are betraying the BOS. KOS!!
---
thanks nice of that guy and thats nice of u to post it in reddit :D
---
FYI the hotrod paint is now in store for 1400 atoms for 1 day only, also there is a hotrod power station too for 700 atoms
---
There's some issue right now with unreasonably high slap damage, and I'm not sure exactly what is behind that.
---
There’s a terminal inside the school that explains that Watoga High was starting a new art program, and had secured a Robobrain containing the brain of Vincent May-Lilly, a celebrated Appalachian artist, as the instructor. 
---
Which makes it all the more disappointing that the robot doesn’t even seem to have dialogue. 
---
And I thought my nearly 1500 hours (53ish days) on bf1 was insane
---
I've actually got 6 of the perk that makes food and water fill your meters more. I could, in theory, switch between 1, 2, or 3 star variants. 
---
I don't, but I could.
---
Sh\*t, that hit me unexpected
---
Run Ironclad if you arn't going to use power armor, it's really strong. Blostering if you got Bloodied weapons otherwise Vanguards. Stealth or vat crit builds are effective (or both). Hard to beat Handmade, Combat pretty good as well, don't bother with Hunting rifle.  Gauss kinda forces you to go heavy gun build.
---
It happens around December 14th. 
---
Character is still not working. 
---
They meant it when they said I had to play a different character...really blows. 
---
Your right about official mod support but if someone is using mods there is nothing stopping them from taking a screen shot or video...this however was taken from a x1 video clip
---
It may be just that the one shotting is hard on your system? If they use explosive shot especially. Idk, the game has so many bugs and glitches it would be hard to pinpoint. As far as kicking off the server, no it shouldn’t be possible, but I’ve read a post (can’t give and don’t remember source) from a guy saying that his character kicks the whole server when he’s near another player. I don’t think that’s what you’re experiencing, but maybe something similar? 
---
And btw, if they’re explosive users, get in their face and make their bullets blow up on you. It should hurt them more than it hurts you 
---
iirc, technically the best are pipe rifles due to using both pistol and rifleman perks...but that's a glitch and might be fixed (doubtful at this rate...) 
---
Otherwise, Gauss has the highest damage. 
---
Currently, I run Gauss (once I get mods for it), handmade, and a shotgun plus a melee weapon. 
---
Armor depends, remember when you're in PA you don't get any fx from your armor. You could go super glass cannon and stay around 20 hp and get the buff from armor. I'm not a huge fan of that. 
---
[This](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5f114ff&amp;d=pl2pp2pk2pd2p02e60lv2lr2lk2lt2l30l71ao0as2an2ar2a72s70a00ic0sa0sd0sb0so0sp0s12&amp;w=&amp;n=Sniper%20MKII) is my MKII build. Some things are still being adjusted such as gunsmith. 
---
Yah this sucks. It just happened to me an I really hope they fix it soon
---
No It's the witch costume
---
My mom passed away unexpectedly a couple weeks ago. I engulfed myself in FO76. I met .bean somewhere along the road. He gave me a few items and we started running down the road. No destination, no communication just running. We went on a 2 hour journey. Brought me to his camp and was chill as I looked around and used the shop. I needed it. I didn’t have a way to tell the fellow thanks. So . Bean if your reading this, I appreciate it. If you’d like to continue the journey I’m here. Iamthehexa 
---
In fallout 76?
---
I will never be that good, but it is nice to be compared.
---
Had this happen to a mate not long ago in a silo.
---
It freaked me right the hell out as i thought they fixed this. So this thing from Legion (icecream man) comes running at ya its pretty freaky...
---
Melee is your friend.
---
PS4 and this has been happening to me for weeks. Especially bad tonight. People keep wanting to blame it on the unique device on here but if so many of us are having issues there is probably more to it.
---
Med x and psycho are always on my hot wheel
---
Kinda late but if u still remember the location you mind telling me?
---
Yes, you were able to "fly" with it. You could reduce the fall so much that you just...didn't fall.
---
These comments got me dead 
---
Yeah he got drunk mid-thought. Maybe the radiation from the ghouls got him.
---
thanks for this notice i would of missed the hotrod ones! I dont know why they dont put clearer messages about new skins on the front page...
---
You have the option of repainting it "Standard", which looks like chrome. But, I don't think you can switch it back once you've chosen it.
---
Agreed. I can't store anything in my stash cause of it. I have to store in quick intervals of 1 or 2 and today it got worse by crashing me during a trade.
---
1. It could have gone into your inventory
---
2. You could have dropped it instead of placing it and some wandering vault dweller may have nicked it
---
3. Voodoo
---
Check your inventory. PA will return to it after a certain amount of time with no one in it.
---
Just shows even in the apocalypse the DMV will still make you jump through hoops
---
Go to windago cave
---
Server hopping shouldn't be a thing, but with current design it will always be a thing. So if it's a thing, then rather make it easier.
---
It's not just yours
---
Also I noticed that the description in Atom store only said "It will give your weapon unique look and maintain all mod effect". I swear that it used to say "unique sound" as well
---
I would even accept the normal death tambo jingle tbh but now it doesn't have any sound whatsoever
---
I just don't pick locks or hack anymore, not worth the trouble switching perks and playing a "mini-game" to get 3 caps, 5 pre-war money and a leather right arm
---
I'm getting more crashes than disconnects at the moment (on Xbox).
---
Mute the in-game music, download the score, make a chi playlist, play it back on different speakers while you’re playing. 
---
It’s not a perfect solution, but it gets the job done. 
---
Copy the game folder to wherever you want the install to be. Mine is C/games. When you click install for the first time, point it to that directory. It will verify files and you're good to go. No new downloads needed. 
---
You may want to copy the documents folder as well. Either way, should be good to go.
---
This is just head in the sand denial. You do you, but the points and rationalization you've got are just wrong.
---
Maybe you just like farming locations in the name of "profitability", but as I and others have pointed out... You're hamstringing your own play.
---
the worst is the one that spawns a human npc...and immediately explodes their head. 
---
We really need a shitpost flair.
---
Check your inventory, pa gets stored after 60 seconds
---
Not feeling the dark blue color.  A hot rod should be red with flames.  Pass..
---
agreed, where do we get this paint job?
---
First time i have heard this request. If it helps level 50 is max level you don't get stronger. The difference between my level 116 and a level 50 is just more perks to choose from.
---
Awesome! Now I can upload all my ~~garbage~~ treasures for sale. 
---
I got those and motion assist servos like right away, lucky I guess. See if I can find the flux before they get scrapped like all my x01 mods
---
Adding serums right now! :) 
---
&gt;  Gauss kinda forces you to go heavy gun build.
---
Why? Gauss isn't a heavy gun, it's flagged as a rifle. It's advisable to take battery w/e to lighten the ammo though.
---
Griefing is not "doing things that others don't like".  You don't own those bodies any more than anyone else. If someone wants to turn them all into ash piles, they're free to try.
---
Second, maybe if you spent less time looting ***during a combat wave***, you wouldn't miss out on so many kills. Try more AOE, I hear it works great. Molotovs are cheap and go a long way.
---
Nah I'll be civilized and hold it in
---
I was killed repeatedly because I couldn’t escape the area. Torn up with no supplies or any way to recover.
---
Locking me out didn’t help. Thanks a lot.
---
Past 50 your levels don't really mean much - you will be able to use all the gear in the game and you will have as many SPECIAL points as you are allowed. The only difference is you will be able to get more perk cards to replace the ones you're currently using, and you will be able to respec if you want to improve your build or try a different one. At that point, the only thing making the game easier is overpowered legendary gear
---
And behold it appears - thank you 
---
Most likely 2 or 3
---
Always thought it was hg havent messed with tho
---
Too bad they can't be tamed.
---
You: Fallout 76 is fake - a simulation.
---
Me: You are fake
---
You: ~butt hurt`I know what irony is!
---
Me:...
---
I won’t just that one time 
---
I like the military cap but the black prospectors hat is a close second
---
She’s a robot sorry bud 
---
You use it with the correct code for a nuke site to launch a nuke at a location of your choice.
---
The server crashes don't help. I get near the last checkpoint and the server crashes -- and I have to start from checkpoint 1. I'm on my 4th attempt now.
---
I have both and never accidentally flew!.... I need to try this!
---
This is wholly opinion. I have 2 hyrbid characters and they work very well, especially in solo play. The point is to optimize your character not to dump everything into a 1 trick pony.
---
The game will automatically scrap mods if their breakdown components are needed for crafting.
---
I just got one
---
I don't understand why it's an issue tbh. It's not like anyone is losing out, if I hit a mob - I get full XP, if a lower level player tags it, they get XP - it's not like i'm getting anything less by them being there, the XP isn't divided or calculated via damage, so who cares if another player hits something i'm fighting. 
---
If anything you're making it easier for me - just don't start running around me and trying to make me hit you accidently, or run into my nades to makee me go wanted and we're fine
---
I've been fairly problem-free inside of whitesprings. Though I've been having a lot of server problems in general the last half hour, constant lag and disconnects.
---
Nothing. These are prescripted instances so I doubt you'd get anything interesting enemy wise.
---
i make sure they run the basic training
---
Nope only junk buuuut if you repair things or craft stuff it can be used as steel. The community has been asking since day one to take mods off scrap.
---
Ps it will choose mods over bulk steel so be super careful.
---
I’ve seen it when server hopping in Charleston looking for the roaming vendor. Kinda funny
---
We got better power armor lmao prewar noobs - The Enclave
---
Serums added now! :) 
---
Enclave general?.
---
If so go grab your nuke code from.
---
https://nukacrypt.com
---
Then go launch the sucker!.
---
Damn Xbox here, thnx though. 
---
Tyvm
---
A quick jog though Nukesprings will get you a ton of raw yellowcake without even trying too hard. It's so much easier than having to craft the stable flux.
---
Atleast our goal isnt to eradicate the rest of america and listen to robots for commands all day
---
I was in there while it was a blast zone, a nice guy built a de-tox shower for everyone to use, but another guy saw me as a level 36, gave a thumbs down, and destroyed the radiation tower with his 50 cal lmg. proceeded to destroy me with it as well :/
---
Ah, but it was 1!
---
I can confirm that hat pacifist mode does not prevent damage to the whitespring bots, I always run with pacifist mode on and my explosive lever action will occasionally aggro the bots.
---
I think you're inventing straw men to attack. The only time I see open hostility to low level players is when they don't have pacifist mode enabled.
---
Nuked whitesprings is where I take low level friends to power level them. Give them molotovs and it's easy to jump them up 10-15 levels by the time the nuke receeds.
---
Ultimately tse handmade but not necessary, things die quick with even a random pipe rifle if you have the right build
---
It prevents me from damaging camps, Ive shot them plenty of times for no DMG. :/ 
---
This has been an enduring problem. But that's a good suggestion. I've had that issue before too. 
---
Also, the Rose quests sometimes come back to life if you tune to her station. 
---
Lmao we'll get our XO1 and Gatling Plasmas... Oh wait those broke when we even grabbed them...
---
I saw the plans for sale once and like an idiot I figured they would be offered again, NOPE!
---
Traveling Please &amp; Thru-Hiker
---
Chemist, Scrapper, &amp; Super Duper
---
How do you keep from dying?  Something will hit you eventually....
---
Or German porn! 
---
And that's how you'll get 1 player farming 20,000 screws from sugar grove across 1,000 servers. 
---
No idea what your doing but I do a couple quests per 8 hours and I level up once in 8 hours. 135 hours in and only level 34
---
Is there any enemies in the silo?
---
Fuuuuuuuck
---
Disagree with Watoga robot. It's a play on the old "Kick me" joke. Once Hornwright successfully lobbied for the automation bill, it's all the kids had left.
---
I worry this is one of those "Donny is a figment of Walter's imagination" type theories. 
---
There's an interesting thing in the Enclave Bunker (Military Wrong Terminal), a conversation between MODUS &amp; ZAX Raven Rock 5 months before the bombs. There's a best case time for analysing data, but ZAX does it slowly over Lincoln's biggest because it's "interesting" data. ZAX asks MODUS if utility is MODUS's only use for information, hinting at ZAX's drive towards presenting as President Eden from Fallout 3.
---
Parenthetically, for anybody from Bethesda reading this please hire Malcolm McDowell to give us quests from D.C. 
---
I have an instigating CR so it’s still legendary but obviously nothing OP. 
---
Still, it had become my go-to gun for mobs and I find so much 45’s :)
---
About 200 turrets and a never ending army of robots yup lol.
---
Easy to solo just make sure you feel geared enough and above level 50.
---
Yup. Ps4 here.
---
Not going to get in a back and forth with you where you keep spamming and being harassing. 
---
The one that rose gives you got me from level 40-60 super easily i can imagine for a low level player it would be super good 
---
BRO I GOTCHU FOR 8000 CAPS IT DOES 1200 DAMAGE PER HIT
---
What, the story line forces you to help the enclave. You have no choice since you are just a puppet.
---
I'm 45 at the moment, does it expire?
---
Are you still wanted during these times? They shouldn’t be able to one-shot if you’re not in combat, or not wanted.
---
Even deathclaws! 
---
Craft them from tinkers workahop, ammosmith and super duper never run out of ammo again just farm mats for about an hr and ur good
---
You can craft energy cells on the Tinker Bench for 4x Copper, 4x Plastic, and 8x Lead; makes 30.
---
Just rolled a crafter, named him Tesla, and the bot on the way out addressed me as Tesla :)
---
I saw this last night! I had just started a new character and ran through it.
---
Nah, Cazadores were an easy fight. Either you took them out quick or they took you out quick. Nice and simple.
---
You dont even need steel thats not bad, coppers gonna suck tho i never can find any well i do but not that i notice.
---
According to Bethesda your statement is not true.  [https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a\_id/44429/kw/mod](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44429/kw/mod)
---
Just purchased a plan from the brotherhood vendor at watoga. 
---
Everytime I see a turret platform behind the golf club, whether it's nuked or not, I destroy it. Every last turret, stash box, wall, and crafting bench. Then I'll have a teammate kill me. Often times we'll take turns who destroys it so the caps circulate amongst us.
---
There is zero reason to have the platform there and all it does is rob other players of loot and XP. Sure, I could stop at just the turrets, but I'll shell out another 60 caps for the sake of you knowing just how F'd off I was. I have never seen these platforms owned by someone under level 50, so I have no sympathy.
---
I spent a while making a dope tree fort/camp in the swamp, and then while exploring the local area found the in-game treetop village/fort place and was kinda bummed after that - puts mine to shame :D
---
I still think I did a great job, but damn, I want that wing bridge, and the circular platforms and the nice wooden railings...
---
The caps you lose in pvp is based on your level, so yeah, I wouldn't want to level up higher once I've had enough perk cards.
---
Nope, but I suspect there’s some glitching or exploiting aspect to it maybe, as I traded with one of the individuals earlier and the shotgun did above 1k damage. 
---
This was actually meant for you.  [https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a\_id/44429/kw/mod](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44429/kw/mod)
---
It was prolly me I did it at night 
---
I'll sell it. I'm on Xbox.
---
How did you get it to complete?
---
That’s an awful price
---
We need to start a cult of BEAN... Praise the BEAN! 
---
Why don't you have a seat over there at that stool please 
---
This is what I was referencing, along with those who have been banned recently for using texture mods.
---
Oh. Sorry. How about 500 caps
---
To be honest, we need a "passive" perk slot area. Give us like 12 points for it. We can use it for weight/food/drink/hacking/lockpicking/aquagirl/ect
---
8000 caps for a duped weapon lul
---
Wowwwwwwwwww take a pill it's a game life goes on be happy 
---
You don't need hardened mass for orbital strikes because they take raw flux. 
---
I have a 2shot explosive dragon. Whats your offer?
---
Hrm, that is weird. Unless maybe it is quad shot. Kindof wish these explosive weapons didn’t exist. They’re cool if you’re using them, but they’re not for any other player in the area 
---
Nope she’s a robot 
---
{Just like the pied piper....Led rats through the streets...}
---
Killing 3 star legendaries before other people have the chance to hit them
---
I don’t think this will be true. But I laughed.
---
Yes, but they're a bit finicky because certain structures can't be destroyed and effectively shield other structures. Foundations, stairs, and floors can't be destroyed.
---
This is also a good tactic to protect yourself. Instead of building roofing, but a stair case up and use flooring as a roof. Now your CAMP can only be destroyed when attacked directly from the side
---
I have a lot of stuff. T-51 set of power armor. A lot of good legendaries that you can take a look at. Ammo. But I’m short on caps, 350 is all I have. But everything else makes up for it. 
---
I deleted it.  I'm not convinced anyone was banned for using texture mods though.  Considering i use them and have my own mods on nexus.  It seems more likely that the cheater was using a cheat engine then got caught and continued to be dishonest on here, stating they got banned for normal mods.
---
This really depends if you are playing for story/lore or blowing through it for end game. Already know end is pretty boring &amp; is going to get repetitive fast.
---
I’m just a poor peaceful farmer, I don’t even like fighting people, I just get annoyed when these people come buy, destroy my camp and myself in under twenty seconds without me lifting a finger to fight. Which is odd because normally my experience with other players is absolutely lovely, most people I come across are rather nice
---
What’s your gamer tag and what time tomorrow should we trade?
---
It’s be true
---
And I'm trying to rp.
---
For the moment, i like to role play as:
---
François Raclette: cannibal cook.
---
Follower of Atom
---
Miner on strike
---
Space Marine (warhammer 40k)
---
There's a couple of perks that Jack up your defence too when low hp.
---
Unyielding can also increase all of your stats by 15 besides end.
---
Its pretty crazy
---
Vita was underrated it's a shame sony had to ignore it
---
Where are those on the map? Despite playing since beta I still have a large portion of the map undiscovered 
---
Thats our teory, we belive vault raids will be extremly hard. So you will need to pop booble head, use drugs, food and serums because for example empath reduce damage team members gets by 25%. I am not sure if it stack buy if yes, thats huge number if everyone pop that.
---
Serum are cheap to craft, they were expensive becouse noone could craft them and enclave is place of madnes.
---
When you run out, tag it for search in the craft menu. You will be able to learn pretty quickly what has copper in it
---
When I logged in the quest was complete and the holos no longer had diamonds next to them.
---
Same here! Most everyone is kind. The high levels usually are jerks. Even then, a lot of them are nice. I think the saying goes “you either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain”. Level 82, still would rather be nice lol. 
---
El jefe holmes. Just shoot me a message when your on
---
I depends on your build.
---
Batteries included? Reduces the weight of energy weapon ammo, like fusion cores
---
I hope you can run lol
---
Could also be possible, I would just not recommend using any mods until they are supported. They plan on supporting them eventually after the shitstorm passes
---
i feel so attacked right now
---
Lots of junk yields copper: lamps, vases, bulbs, and much more:
---
http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Copper_(Fallout_76)
---
All spaces?
---
Yeah between el and jefe and holmes
---
Tinker workshops? Mmm ... i dont really know where one is top of my head thats close to vault 76. Try the gorge junkyard i know there is a weapons amd power armor station there.
---
Clarinet 
---
I’ve just hit 80 like today, and I honestly don’t know how. I’ve made like next to no quest progression, but yeah I love just walking around, teaming up with random people and trading. I love being helpful and cool, since for the most part I’m playing with other fallout players 
---
It's still not a loot based game. 
---
That would make every game a loot based game. 
---
Just because you can farm for shit doesn't make it a loot based game.
---
one shares rad sponge 3, the other ghoulish 3.
---
enjoy being 100% invincible in a nuke zone wearing whatever you want. 
---
I lock my home because people leave the game wearing power armor in from of my work benches when I don't. I'll come back to top off weapon condition before a big fight and find the shell of a power armor frame sitting in front of a bench I need.
---
I'll be courteous when other players are. They aren't.
---
Technically, all duping groups are infinitely large, and thus, the same size.
---
Screenshot or it didn't happen
---
Oh my, fusion cells are trash, it drops from every robot, even those in flatwoods? Everyone got tones, becouse energy weapons are weakest and broken in few shots. Ye and if you loot in silos, there are robots with them everywhere.
---
Any luck? 
---
I searched the Grafton vendor for a while and same story. I have full BoS and ultralight limbs, but can’t seem to seed the ultralight chest.
---
Did Grafton carry?
---
Nah buddy with ya always.
---
Several of these can also appear just off the road from the Overseer’s camp to Flatwoods, just past the first pickup truck, on the right (north of the road).
---
I have a camp at that same exact location.
---
Come on here and trade ammo with someone.  I always need 5.56 and I always get rid of Microfusion Cells, either by giving to newbs or dropping.
---
Thanks for all the help
---
Cool. I’ll be on tomorrow morning
---
Correct. The Gauss rifle is, well, a rifle. But its ammo is classified as energy. So you grab Batteries included due to the weight of its ammo and use rifle perks to make it stronk.
---
Np man its what we are here for.
---
Yeah, did the Belly of the Beast quest this evening with my husband, right after someone nuked the fissure site right there, that was fun.
---
If u drop. Anyone can pick them up?
---
Yeah most of my levels came from exploring and killing things. Only recently have I focused on quests. And that’s the best part of fallout, the players! Feels so so rewarding to answer someone’s questions or give them extra junk or supplies. What platform are you on? I’m on PS4 if you want to play sometime. My PSN is my reddit username. 
---
They should make one that disconnects you every time you use it....
---
https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/000/091/TrollFace.jpg
---
Theres an unmarked cave in the north I ran across awhile back, it had two entrances with an abandoned  camp in it not instanced. East of the crosshairs o think.
---
it's OP in automatic mode. It shares perks with sniper rifle ( rifle man, not commando). So you don't have to invest extra perks to use a high damage rate auto weapon.
---
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlyQn0zsbeU) is an example.
---
and an additional 4 hours later (couldn't find a good USB, then Premiere wasnt working...)

#I give you [Killing a Scorchbeast in under a minute without a legendary weapon.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWxnG3s1wAs&amp;t=21s)

They still require farming....  I have done both many times, with only a clean version of the spacesuit to show for it.
---
i uh, i forgot these were a thing you could do something with.
---
i have 238.
---
Thanks. I'll try to figure out which areas give which silo codes, because this one only seems to drop silo A codes.
---
Aaah Queen kills are great as long as the server holds in there.
---
Yeah, me too. Appalachia has been an absolute treat to explore, I can’t remember the last time I loved a map so much. I’m on Xbox, at Sanctuary hiIIs if you ever make it there :) 
---
Sounds good
---
If people are actually made about this they should ask bethesda to make levels matter. There doesn't seem to be any scaling at all.
---
"beat game" so you can now solo queen? Becouse they are never ending. Your job ends, when they are gone! Dismist!
---
That’s it. In our team I share RAD sponge while everyone has ghoulish equipped. Two of us has different heavy PA builds but the chameleon sniper has a nice time all day too. 
---
Thanks for the responses, I'm loving the game still, just learning the quirks I guess
---
Can somebody PLEASE explaint o me why scorchbeasts are The most infuriating enemy in this damn game? First of all, they are able to hit me with their Sonic blast from all directions. Not just where their heads are pointed, but they fly away from me and blast me through their ass. Can the attacks be dodged? No. Because they are released up to ten times a second. And they are easily the hardest enemy to hit. Not only is their hitbox janky, at BEST, it only counts for their torso and head. I'm sorry?! Are their legs and wings not part of their damn body? Then there's the fact that they regenerate at least three to four times faster than any enemy. They don't even have to be legendaries. I'm level 94 and I avoid them at all costs simply because they are impossible to take down unless I have a full team. I get the fight is supposed to be difficult, believe me I do. But it shouldn't be FUCKING IMPOSSIBLE. 
---
30% rifleman, concentrate 3, sneak 2.3x, Bloodymess 3, Critical 3. 
---
Thx,👍
---
Completely fabricated lol 
---
I must always be getting the good groups running around Whitesprings and SBQ, never hear anything negative on area chat and normally at Whitesprings people are helping the lowbies. I had it last night @ WS, went from 87 to 95, there were a bunch of 20-40s and some 150+. Everyone was using low damage guns to make sure everyone could tag the enemies and the higher levels would absorb the damage. It's easier and more fun to help the lower levels than it is to piss on their parade, we're all (well mostly) here to have fun.
---
So can they. I died. Not going back there for a while
---
I'm not big on PVP, that may change after if I get bored doing quests. The most PVP I've done is respawning and harrassing some higher-level goons (I was level 23-ish and there were in there 80s) that took a workshop away from me. I lost alot of caps but it was worth it to not let them just take it and go about their business. I figured if they wanted to take something i was gonna make them stay there and defend it.
---
There's a glitch that allows unlimited special points.  That's how he can kill you when not engaged in pvp. 
---
I don't have a problem with people that CAMP fight the queen. It's destroyed pretty quickly and often instantly by any scorchbeast. People that do this will end up spending mats of turrets/defenses to maintain them and will eventually give up. A lot of that is harder to farm stuff, like oil and circuitry. It ends pretty quickly
---
I think it was the first week after BETA. Decided to try a diff spot other than Prime/Whitesprings.
---
Went for a Fissure. Absolutely nothing.
---
Could have sworn we were told that endgame nukes no matter where launched created a crazy high level boss area.
---
Once again another failure on their part for this game.
---
If its a case of "were trying to do this for years"
---
Even all these new additions will fade in a short amount of time. I think they made a mistake making it fully online.
---
An offline co-op with 6 player teams with a 2 player option for online would have worked great
---
3 single rifleman... That was my original build.  Thanks.
---
Is there a difference? 
---
There just pissed that the low levels wandering around can cause there god roll legendaries to drop at level 35 instead of 50
---
I'd have to agree, i'm fine unlocking things in-game (even though they have jacked the cost so high to incentivise cash purchase and discourage actually playing for them). 
---
But paying real cash for one new (and frankly low quality) texture is kinda shitty. 
---
BUY NOW, LIMITED TIME, YOU CAN'T GRIND THIS MANY CAPS IN 5 HOURS, SO BETTER COUGH UP BEFORE IT'S GONE!
---
HONESTLY, IT'S SO LIMITED - IT MIGHT BE A WHOLE WEEK BEFORE WE TRY AND TRICK YOU INTO BUYING IT AGAIN!
---
Nukes don't count towards bounty. You can see a friend's CAMP on the target sighting computer, but no one else's and I know I've nuked others' CAMPs. 
---
No, and in fact it turns out, there is no ultra-light option for Combat armor at all. I was beginning to suspect it was true, but then I found a post someone made using a utility to extract every plan in the game into a list. Ultra-light isnt an option for combat armor chests. It is for the limbs but not the chest. Its probably an oversight.
---
[Here is the thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a52bwy/fallout_76_plan_checklist_every_plan_in_the_game/)

Bad news, but at least now we know. Cheers!

Well that sounds fun.

Not his original idea. its been floated for a while with many different variations.

Beth wont do it though.

Most creatures that can't melee you will run away. You have to stay within melee range of one in order to keep the AI from running. Same thing happens with dogs, mole rats, rad scorpions, etc.

How were you possibly in combat for 2 hours? Was your base attacked? If not, why try for so long?

I've seen this. It freaks me out. I followed it for awhile to see if there was a quest involved but it just kept walking around in circles.
---
I get it, just found it amusing. Good on you showing him the ropes. 
---
those aren't good.  pavement/vendor material.  the laser is ok but it will break in one fight.
---
Can I buy one? 
---
I didnt realize I had an explosive 10mm on me because in my pip boy window it only showed one modifier. Same in the stash window. Only in the crafting menu did it show that it actually had 3 effects on it. Now I check everything very carefully. 
---
Don't do this. Usually when I let ghouls chase me, it's because I'm leading them to friends so they can get tags for loot. Lead loot/XP to others, not away from others. Even bodies that others haven't tagged in the nuke zone often give other players ionized meat, hardened mass, or high rad fluid. If you hide those bodies from them, they get absolutely nothing
---
I did One Violent Night with a level 28 (Im 130) They kept dying every two hits from level 60+ Diseased charred ferals, but they kept respawning, we got the event done and i dropped them the legendaries I got but didnt need.
---
Anyone saying "X level doesnt belong here" is just an intolerable baby.
---
When i roll a new character, based on my knowledge of the game now, look forward to a level 10 going wherever the fuck i so please
---
Good to know, thanks. 
---
I had this same issue on ps4 and just came here to report it. It's happened multiple times. i go to charge my tesla rifle and shooting an enemy who is also attacking me and the game crashes. Mine is legendary explosive if that makes a difference.
---
I don’t necessarily want any music removed, but I would greatly appreciate music from the past games playing way less often or moved to a different station. It’s to the point where I don’t ever have the radio on because I’m so tired of the recycled music from fo3-4 which is a shame because I really love all the new music.
---
Can confirm I'm having this same problem on xbone, especially with the stash. 
---
Wish I'd picked up Super Duper earlier in the game. There's nothing you craft that you don't want more of.
---
Tell your brother to not build a kill-stealing turret platform unless he wants to rebuild it 100 times
---
I have sean .BEAN too. What a legend. 
---
Lol...
---
I have no idea either. When I was just starting out and trying to get power armour, I'd take naps to get the 'well rested" xp buff but stopped after I got to level 15.
---
Hadn't considered that, thanks. I will have to experiment a bit. 
---
Everything should break. Hell launching a mini nuke at a random building should destroy it too. Quest objective be damned.
---

I bought an explosive harpoon gun from the vendor last night as well. I think a lot of people think that explosive is supposed to be what it reads on the first lone. For the harpoon gun, it was 30% damage to mireluks then explosive on the second line. 
---
Thank you for thinking like this, cheaper for me &lt;3

When has Bethesda ever treated you as a human being? When have they ever shown less than contempt for us? They lied, false advertised, sold us a broken mess and had the audacity to ask for more money. When do we get treated with any respect from Bethesda?
---
How long until you run out of apologetic excuses?
---
From what a friend had told me you need to cripple their wings to ground them. Otherwise this flying nonsense is rampant. 
---
Dope we not online rn but maybe Sunday! 
---
How does what i say make every game loot based?
---
I'm trying to see your logic besides outright denial.
---
The fact you think previous fallout games even matter hammers it home.
---
What is fo76 then? Why do ppl farm anything?  Why are ppl high level after they finish the story?
---
Prove to me it isn't because denial isn't a defence
---
I see what you are saying, but honestly these are the least aggressive I have ever seen. 
---
Yes I guess the animations could be annoying. But it's not like you can go and buy perk packs after they get hooked. 
---
If you have ever played any of the EA sports franchise modes you will know where I'm coming from.

I stopped playing the NHL HUT mode last year because of this. They even give you packs in other modes to try and get you back. Pissed me off.

---
Duuuude, explosive harpoon guns are awesome.  Put a flachette mod on it and have fun &lt;3

Use perks to target specific body parts and cripple the wings forces them to ground only combat. 
---
Same with XboxOne too.

Playing 76 on Xbox but thinking to buy the collection from GoG on Mac (just cents) since I don’t wanna install windows and the launcher just to retrieve this gift. 
---
Exactly! I always really like what i make, but i know i could really do some top quality shit if i were given the tools haha
---
What level was you and what's your set up, Mêlée or ranged?
---
This is super good to know, thank you!
---
Not a reliable method, but Grahm and chally sell the handmade plans for 590ish 
---
I know you're joking but the limit is 25k that you can have
---
There appears to be a major issue with the damage a legendary explosive shitgun, sorry shotgun, deals. It has a tendency to one shot kill everyone it it's path including  PvP. This is an issue when the user is a lowly level 17 going up against someone 50+.
---
Getting that damage issue fixed would be great.
---
It’s a perk card
---
Scrap an assualtron head, it will give you the plans and a 'scrap assualtron head', which is a needed component
---
You can explore all of the Forest safely no problem, then parts of Toxic Valley and Ash Heap. Not too much farther than Charleston though
---
Also all scorched crearures are eatable with it. Scorched megasloth is best meal ever!
---
This is a thing?
---
Damn, I need to check the game settings, I missed this in the menu's.
---
Having explored a little with PvP in this game, i've come to the conclusion that adding PvP to a game with such unbalanced ridiculous builds is kinda pointless.
---
You either one shot someone, or you get 1-shot, the PvP Assassin gear doesn't really do much.
---
So I messed about with it, had some fun and now it's just an annoyance if I accidentally tag someone. 
---
Glad to know there's an option to turn it off. Are there any downsides to this, as opposed to running the game as default?
---
The level is definitely the detriment 
---
Why was this one removed?
---
Protip- always "place" your power armor. NEVER "drop" it unless you're getting rid of it.
---

---
You can solo it at that level also.
---
Make different/harder builds. Don't do all side quests with 1 build.
---
Sure, Whats your ingame name?
---
Great job! Ignore the mods are cheating people, as always modding is how all Bethesda games get fixed.
---
Good ghouls? There might be one, but in the end, the only good ghouls are those who don't get out of their stinking holes.
---
Sweet I'll make sure to hit you up 
---
Level 1 - go forth and explore. Prepare to run away on occaision.
---
Maybe an apology, and explain what they were thinking when they did half of the shit they did. Walk us through what they are actually doing. What they are planning. Explain why the game is in the state it is.
---
That sounds awesome. Do the owls cry at night? We have little owls called Morporks and their cry sounds like someone calling "Mooore Poork!" It sounds beautiful and haunting.
---
I like the look of your camp, sorry that someone did that!
---
I like building community spaces too. My first character set up a live music stage near whitesprings station. Haven’t fully decided what to build with my current character but was thinking maybe a gallery of some kind.
---
Not sure if that’s really his/her buddy or just a MULE ac tbh
---
I mean, yeah, if he was new, it would kill the game for him.
---
More likely, it was just an alt being powerleveled.
---
no, but he told me to meet him here
---
I love how the developers and publisher are never satisfied with the money they receive for their product, put out a flawless running cash shop with absurd prices, limited time items and monetized holiday stuff. I also like how you turn a blind eye to attack your fellow consumer, you spineless fuck.
---
They sound a lot like parrots. I mean for playing like that. 
---
I'm all about being patient, but I'm pretty tired of overlooking bugs to play a game I enjoy. If bethesda doesn't like seeing these kinds of things getting upvotes, then they should do something about the stability. It's a game better with friends because playing solo destroys progress without them
---
Wasnt a mule. They didnt have copious amounts of gear and were actively questing.
---
There is a bug or feature (really don’t know) that if you logg-in with PA, your current core will be refilled to 100%. 
---
That in mind, it’s easy to relogg several times, every time just leaving your PA immediately and replace your core with another one. In that way, you can create a stack of dozens 100% cores just in minutes. All you need are cores from PAs. Easy way is to do this as Mama Dolce in Morgantown since there are several PA spawns around. So just farm the cores; relogg; replace core; farm new one; relogg...
---
I always take care to carry 5 with me and have a stack in the stash for emergency cases. 
---
Its not like they dont know what's wrong, they are probably working to fix it.
---
Hot.
---
^definitely this, I was pretty annoyed after spending 3 levels on this after the update that nerfed xp gains. The description for all night long is ambiguous as hell
---
Crafting req aren't necessarily higher, they are just different.  
---
Shotshells for example are super easy to make plenty of.  
---
It raises the base damage of some weapons as well as increasing the damage vs anything scorched and scorchbeasts (which is an important distinction, as zealot's does not do bonus dmg to the beasts.  I think hunter's does though)
---
Be careful though, some weapons, once modded to prime, cannot be made standard again.  
---
I just hope there's such thing as a prime fat man.  Haven't seen one yet.
---
Not from the information I was given. He was a new player.
---
of all the things you should be angry about...you’re angry about that...  
---
haha, my poor friend on discord received a full blown rant about this.. I was all excited to show off my build and then we found the tree village.. 
---
The next 10 mins was just me complaining about shit. 'OMG they have circular platforms, THEY ARE IN THE GAME, WHY DON'T I HAVE THIS!!!  Dude, I had to painstakingly place those blockly rectangular platforms all around the tree, and just down the road here it all fits nice and flush and looks dope as hell, man, WTF A WING BRIDGE, PLEASE TELL ME THERE ARE PLANS FOR THIS SHIT!
---
WHAT! NO PLANS!!
---
Great idea.
---
No matter the level, I hate people who stand in the doorway of the ghoulf club. Just stand back in the tennis court and tag the mobs if you're too low level to get hit by them. You don't need good guns to do this. You'll get XP and drops even if us higher levels end up killing it. If you are level 1 and can do this, I have no problem with it.
---
The fact that you managed to take them all down is impressive. I haven't even killed one scorchbeast yet. I came close knocking one down to under 50% health with the help of robots near Watoga only for the bastard to run off like a filthy coward. Other than that I've had to run or die.
---
Thanks!  I just went to Charleston for a quest, but it looks like I should probably go up to Grafton instead of hanging out down here since I'm level 10 too.
---
I like the CR a lot, but I find the recoil doesn’t compare to the handmade.
---
Yep. My 100s of hours in the game were invalidated because someone cant handle NOT exploiting.
---
The best VATS weapon!
---
I certainly hope they fix the auto melee weapons so that you don't need Weapon Artisan for them to even be viable. Along with other durability issues on weapons/armor.
---
Not gonn lie...kinda looks like a dick is behind you. 
---
Two people followed me around white springs shooting me (trying to get me to shoot back) yesterday. I just taunted them, thumbs down and ???. Finally I got a message accusing me of stealing from one of them and I wrote back that I don’t have the stash to be stealing. Then after falsely accusing me and trying to kill me they ask if they can pls have some springs and screws.
---
No. No you can’t.
---
My thing now is to take over a workshop someone else has already claimed, then fight when they show up to defend it. 
---
Worse case scenario is I die. I dump all my junk beforehand, so they don't get anything.
---
Usually though, what happens is they fast travel immediately and if you kill them you get a ton of junk. 
---
Plop a stash box down immediately after and store everything. Boom, free junk.
---
Yeah it's really unfortunate. I really enjoy the game but the lore inconsistencies really downgrade it for me. I would explain it away by saying the mutants migrated from the Capital Wasteland, but the Super Mutants in 76 are the same models as FO4 (The Institute strain), whereas Vault 87 mutants are yellowish.

You'll run out of space in your photo gallery before completing this. xD
---
I really want to like ESO. I feel like it'd work so much better as a singleplayer game. I hope Bethesda take notes from the combat system in ESO. Certain hotkeys for using special magic and combat moves is so cool. I've even bought ESO twice, but only played it a total of about 50 hours.
---
Yes.
---
As a Medic Build, have you looked into the Friendly Fire perk card under Charisma, it would work well with this flamer.
---
Someone else can close the door for you though. I guess that's a workaround.
---
Pretty sure crops are instanced. When I farm flux with friends we all pick the same flora.
---
[You could just spec into taming, don't be mean to green](https://i.imgur.com/1bG3WCc.jpg)
---
yes handmade plan at lvl 15 just either buy one for about 1000 from person or lvl a char to 15 real quick
---
Pros use half walls to build their walls into the ground. 
---
First off, you really do need to give them enough space to land. Fought my first one at the Berkeley Springs workshop and stayed on the rooftop for almost the entire fight. Big mistake.
---
Second, Scorchbeasts are not fun. I'm not sure why they were designed this way. Sometimes finding a spot for them to land isn't easy, especially if you're in a heavily forested area. Their main ranged attack is simply too damn visually overwhelming. I can never see what the hell is going on, and then they fly around in such an odd pattern that it's impossible to accurately aim. On top of it my framerate dips down, as always, and the noise is obnoxious. Whole thing comes together to be an unfun experience.
---
It's weird because I certainly don't remember Skyrim dragons being this bad.
---
What's the codes for the silos 
---
The trick to almost every maze.  Just follow the wall.  Pick either left or right and just trace thru.  Might not be the most efficient route but you can move quickly and find your way back out easily because that wall will connect to the otherside 
---
What level are the enemies?
---
They don’t have a whole lot of caps by that point though. Primo spot would have to be the road between whitesprings station and ws. 
---
Absolutely no events that require teamwork guarding places or alternating events. I'm not going to have my success rate be impeded by johnny no-mic who leave the whitesprings golf club for the first time in a week and has no clue what to do. All the events need to be soloable for a competent player with an effective build and strong gear
---
Can always jump server if someone tried
---
Just erase the photos. More space then 
---
Little late to the party but, where did you get it?
---
I don't understand the attraction to the handmade.  The ones I've seen only do 75-100 max.  Am I missing something?
---
Dont know what all the people are complaining. After all the horror stories, when I finally came to the quest, it took me 15minutes to complete it. Basically, you have to talk to 2 robots, use 2-3 terminal, find 1-2 items in the same building (marked on compass!) and to fight 2-3 horde-waves while waiting. You never have to leave the building and even when your game would crash, the quest takes 15-20minutes. What the heck is your issue with it? I served 20 years in the army, this is far away from real bureaucratic procedures.
---
Per??? That’s a lot
---
Personally with my high level I have a lot of the northwestern part of the map unexplored. So what i like to do is get ready get my PA set up since I am an Atom Cat, and since I went melee, Gunslinger with Melee being my strong suit. I pull out my silenced pipe revolver. I come across an old ice cream shop with low level super mutants (The highest they can spawn in the area max 25) so i sneakily Vats sneak my targets eventually ending in getting discovered and have a wild west vats shoot out with the super mutant boss. I explore fully any mutant that wants to bother me while i read gets the insta hit with my melee. I don't know it's how you play the game. I like that melee synergizes with pistols so you can have a weapon proficiency and AP increase.
---
I use friendly fire with the shish kabab.(spelling)
---
Awesome, Thanks. I was researching for the same info, but you were much more successful. Guess I’ll keep the deep pocketed unless they change the plans around.
---
Cheers!
---
Grafton and Morgantown areas are pretty ok at level 10. I feel there are some seriously hard enemies up above that area at the top of the map. I didnt venture there until about level 25. There's a bit of a lul between level 10 to 30 where you seem to grind in the safer areas and then everything gets much easier. 
---
But I'm doing a series on Wasteland Toilet Art Installations. :(
---
So, what I get from this, is that items in the Stash should weigh as much as it would AS IF you have the appropriate Perk(s) equipped. 
---
For example, I'll use the Bunker Buster missile launcher. Normally, this monster weighs \~44 lbs (?) or whatever weight system they use. With Bear Arms Perk at max, giving a 90% weight reduction to heavy weapons, Bunker Buster becomes a measly \~3.9 lbs. Therefore, if I have the Bear Arms Perk at max rank regardless if it is equipped as an active Perk or not, Bunker Buster will ALWAYS be \~3.9 lbs in my Stash. On the other hand, if I were to withdraw Bunker Buster from my Stash, it will weigh the normal \~44 lbs unless I have Bear Arms as one of my active and equipped Perks. 
---
I think this structure works best to help players store more weapons, armor, and materials they want to keep without having to make such drastic compromises. I would like to store as many weapons as possible, obviously to a reasonable degree, without needing to constantly dump and manage materials I could be using or armor I could be wearing or other weapons that I might want to use in the future or use as trading leverage. 
---
The compromise to this would be keeping building/crafting materials as their weight and this kind of update not being applied to the Pack Rat Perk. I personally think the materials are fine where they are at a 600 storage cap (though I would always appreciate a storage upgrade) and would make a perk such as Pack Rat ridiculously "stressful on servers" if Bethesda truly feels if their servers are not ready for such large player storage. Though I believe the servers are strong enough to accomodate for the amount of extra weapons.
---
Stealth sniper with mission impossible music.
---
Lol good one but mine was real. I was worried because they kept trying to trade with me. Worried about my inventory getting stolen.. Not saying it's true or false but I didn't want to become a victim.
---
oh big fucking deal. 
---
That's pretty much how it is though, the forest is 1-10, then you have toxic valley which is 10-25, then ash heap which is 25-35 then starting with savage divide they go scale to 99 but have minimum levels that you should be savage starts at 15(which i think is too low should be 25) the mire is a minimum of 30 and cranberry is minimum 35. 
---
But yeah, as soon as you hit the savage divide the game stops playing nice with level scaling and allows for max level based on highest player in the vicinity.
---
[My favorite.](https://imgur.com/4F5VQTz)
---
says more about you than this stupid incident if it even happened. invalidated. what fucking silly gibberish. get ahold of yourself. its not a contest. 
---
Great shot!
---
That is more or less how it goes, it just only has 2 grades. 1-20 and 15-whatever.
---
(the map on the build planning site alleges that the toxic valley has an in between setting, but thats kind of questionable in my experience. Though even if it does, radscorpions, mirelurks, and anglers kind of offset that with their own innate toughness,.
---
Her scaling only gets ridiculous when you have a crowd there. With overpowered two-shot explosive weapons you can definitely kill her in less than a minute with two people. I remember seeing a video here that was a supposed world record of 30 seconds or so
---
Um it is set of different paintjobs. Did you saw zhem all?
---
That's awesome!
---
Dude something happened with my game as well. Im doing about 40%  - 60% less damage from when I was playing solo last night. Last night im doing 286 on my grognaks axe, today 173. 286 on my quad explosive pump last night, today 182. And thats with all my weapons even my chainsaw. Another note is that I dont own any duped weapons so it cant be a punishment. Im super confused. Also im fully aware of all the in game changes and effects like perk sharing chems etc. All my guns are legitimately nerfed 
---
I saw a Mr. Handy veterinarian that was being followed by like 4 or 5 cats 
---
well they are good the exploding one is really good and ones to scrap for mods dont drop often so making your own and scrapping them is best way is why most people want it
---
I meant the Super Duper Mart
---
A few reasons:
---
1.  If your camp is beside the Charleston station, it blocks the rare vendor bot from spawning.
---
2.  They wanted to become wanted for fun.
---
3.  537 cats smell
---
4.  He's a dick.
---
Amazing how anyone could bare through this game to earn that much 
---
Never seen the handmade plan at a vendor to answer your main question, 
---
But its a near constant drop drom the patrol event at the penitentiary Almost as reliable as getting the generators from Poseidon's event.
---
Yeah it’s really sad how fast I burn through ammo because they barely scratch enemies. I’m tired of using a hunting rifle but it does almost 50 damage more than my laser
---
Different strokes for different folks, I guess. 
---
If you’re on a PS4, the last 15 minutes is always recorded.
---
4k is a fair price
---
I remember the 1st  I went there it was easy killing the Feral ghouls (I was level 10). I was passing through a little later in the week (I was level 15) there were a few level 20 enemies but the rest were at least level 50 and up to level 70. I ran so fast, died a few times...lol
---
I'm level 240 and I often use downgraded versions of the cards. Sometimes because I screwed up (nobody needs rad sponge lvl 3, or I re-specced endurance to only 1 point), but often times because you can get 50% of the full benefit from level 1. Only 1 point in rifleman, expert rifleman, and master rifleman costs you 3 points of perception and gives you 30% damage buff. For 9 points, you can max out those cards and get 60% damage buff. Those spare 6 points might be better spent on type of enemy damage buffs (exterminator, glow sight, etc), armor penetration, or play style damage buffs (sighted aiming perks, concentrated fire, etc).
---
An optimized build isn't about having everything maxed out, it's about spending the points tactfully. Leave the card system as is. It just works.
---
I am on PS4...I checked the last recording was a week ago. Maybe cause it all happened in less than 10 minutes?
---
Someone had an OP bloodied weapon build.
---
Or the three of them just had good weapons and builds.  Three people won't make her hard.
---
Since I got White Knight rank 3 I haven’t had to repair my armor even once and that was back in late-November. I’ve accumulated around 200 ballistic fiber because of it and the fact that I don’t have to go looking for it, I just pick it up when I come across it.
---
Take that with a grain of salt though. As deeper parts of Toxic and Ash do spawn over those amounts sometimes. And even the level 20 versions of some of the enemies that show up in those locales can be pretty beastly on a fresh player.
---
Exactly. 
---
Pack rat should still be fine to reduce building mats. Honestly my stash is like 90% building mats atm and none of them are over 500 but I can only fit a handful of outfits and grenades beyond them. 
---
It just would be nice to not have to choose between having materials to build things but have to carry everything on myself because the weight balloons in the stash
---
You don't understand the game's mechanics, are wrong, and should shut up
---
Theories are based on solid facts.  You're stating pure speculation as 
---
if you read it in the patch notes.
---
&gt; If your camp is beside the Charleston station, it blocks the rare vendor bot from spawning.
---
Rare vendor bot? As in, it sells rares or it's just a vendor bot that is rare?
---
That is witchhunting. And, some people have reasons for leveling a base.
---
Sure some grief. But I have went out of my way to level someones base for straight harassing me at my workshops. Like not even taking them, just breaking my fusion core processor because they dont want me to get cores.
---
I'm on PS4 and I've only got chat to work once. And I was a complete jerk. I was giving a level 3 a bunch of stuff and he was taking forever, since chat had never worked for me before I blurted out something like "dude just take the stuff already". He replied back that he didn't know how and I was like "Holy shit you can hear me!!" I felt so bad, I apologized profusely. And sadly it hasn't worked since.
---
Good to know that the excavator I dropped by mistake and lost, has a chance that someone picked it already. 
---
There's a Mr Handy that walks a bunch of dogs too. Usually see him in the ash heap.
---
Guess I got lucky with my free BOS set being hotter rod. 
---
Score one for me I guess. 
---
Just had my fourth crash in 2 hours tonight. Every one when accessing a store inventory or my stash. No, I don't have any duped items or use any glitches/exploits. 
---
I am guessing it was to try and upset me and that whoever it was though it was funny and wanted me to fight maybe. I am honestly not even angry about, I just don't understand why?.
---
Well if the camp is somewhere that interferes with gameplay, I get that. I agree cat's smell but Kat is short for my girlfriends name Katrina. 
---
Both actually.  He spawns in as an event by the pond next to the station rarely.
---
He sells rare costumes like the hunters long coat and clean space suit.
---
If you're a rifle build they're really nice for sustained damage. I use it as my medium range / sustained weapon for my sniper. 
---
Not sure if they're much better or any than the combat rifle though. 
---
You would make an amazing enclave soldier.
---
Hit the Share button and you should see the last 15 minutes of video.
---
It’s a continuous 15 minute loop, so the last 15 minutes of gameplay (or less of you only played 10 mins after starting up) is always there unless the game blocks it, but I don’t believe FO76 blocks.
---
Here’s Sony’s manual page on it:
---
https://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps4/share/videoclip.html
---
Good to know, thanks.
---
I will absolutely destroy your base if you build RIGHT next to a junk extractor (where my base usually is in particular) and you arent using it.
---
Its FREE JUNK and you don't need a plan. If you aren't going to use it, build somewhere else. That is literally the reason MOST people build next to resource deposits.
---
Don't build there and block people from using them unless you use it. Otherwise, it is a dick move.
---
I was saying the opposite. You can add overleveled pieces to a frame as a inventory item, not through the power armor station.
---
Jesus. Read the subreddit rules!
---
It doesn't matter what the guy does, both this subreddit and the site as a whole ban people for stuff like this.
---
They already do.  Honestly its not a problem if you go back to your CAMP once in a while.
---
To actually get into the silo?
---
You need to join the enclave, and get enough merits to reach the rank of general. 
---
Then you can actually enter nuke silos.
---
She scales.
---
She ALSO can just.... die.
---
Do you want to join the very first fallout band ever? Hit my up pc KEAZAR
---
Although I personally like the handmade, this question could be applied to any of the weapon plans.
---
It's 5.56 ammo right? I thought it was better than the plain ole assault rifle. I just like to have a weapon of each caliber with me or in my stash. 
---
52 max I believe.
---
Join pur band dude i play bass and someone here id percussion
---
Dude join us. Add me KEAZAR on pc

I hate butcher Pete, I stopped listening to DCR because of that shit

Fair enough. Posts been deleted.

This and ESO are completely different games. Can't compare them.

Cool, what do you think about it? Recommendation?

At the moment fuel are just too expensive. I rather saved my acid for gunpowder :(

I was using HDMI out to my widescreen. Had this problem from beta and for first month, found that if I go into Windows screen properties, there is an option where the display is your TV and the computer is the secondary output, switching their roles fixed it for me.

Any idea how much would it sell for PC? I usually just vendor bot these things lol

Do you like quests?
---
Do you like lore?
---
Do you like multiplayer?
---
If its yes to most of these. It is worth checking out.
---
Honestly, I've had more luck with my non explosive two shots on the SB and SBQs
---
Yes, you're not just buying a "game" your buying a constandly updating service !  So yeah as Todd sayd "we will keep updating and improving over time". Conclusion the game is only going to be better and better.
---

It was the nuke hotfix
---
I miss my Sidekick. It was the next best thing to your Motorola. I miss real buttons. I could type a mile a minute on that thing without having to retype the word that auto correct (autocowreck) thinks is wrong. An the good ol days when you actually needed to spell lol.
---
You got any extra ?
---
A level 5 explosive shotgun is ridiculously valued in the marketplace. You can trade that gun for your pick of 2-3 max level TSE weapons. People consider it valuable because it helps level alternate characters very quickly. 
---
Your RNG is awesome, you just don't see it
---
I mean... well... I paid for it...
---
I couldn’t resist either. Spent cold hard cash too. 
---
Stays in their camp.  
---
I missed their name when it started. I also have my capture set at 3 minutes. Obviously that's not enough time to back track and find it. I'm going to adjust it because these are exactly the kinds of vids I wanted when I set up my camp.
---
PS4
---
I'm not sure how to feel about the multiplayer part of it, maybe I just need to watch more content on it. I watch Oxhorn's videos on it, but in those he doesn't really do a lot of MP.
---
But its only usable if they themselves have the plans.
---
Had a friend make a fusion generator at my new characters base. Couldnt attach wires to it. Couldnt move it. Stored it, and tried to replace it. Wouldnt allow me.
---
Awe shite, i was gonna come join you if you were on pc and give you q goodie bag
---
It becomes part of their camp. It belongs to that person.
---
Happy cake day!
---
Should I be denied a cosmetic item because you paid for more of the game than I did? Why not put it in the atom shop?

Shame :( we were already friends
---
We hope.
---
Lol I've met some petty players like that 
---
What missions are you still doing at high level?
---
Because I bought it, as an exclusive thing that was advertised for more money.
---
I mean, there could be some legal repercussions and yet more backlash for something like that.
---
That's not how the game works
---
Not really. Exclusivity for more money is the exact reason some games are currently under fire for.
---
Good luck finding your band &lt;3 If (nd when) you cone to ps4 ill be waiting
---
Great Read.  Great RP.  10/10 
---
Still already been done. Can't reverse it now. Its exclusive to that version of the game, not as an added bonus or limited time exclusive.
---
I ended up laughing at the “Fallout God Vegas”... but then I was like, “well shoot, it’s true isn’t it!”

I don’t believe the block feature is the solution.

If I’m not mistake, block only hides you from their map, user list, and prevents communications, it doesn’t prevent them from seeing and attacking you or your C.A.M.P. if they encounter you or your C.A.M.P. on the server.

I love those string lights. I think I may have to buy them.

You can just press V inside the pipboy to get a white colour. No need to alter any filés

My Character: "I wish I knew how to read"
---
Makes perfect sense to me. 
---
41 Go for the nuke hot fix ? 
---
Yeah, that's why I'm asking the question. I started picking up every gun I could find and would slowly crawl back to a workbench to scrap everything lol. I would test this myself but I think I have all the mods for the weapons that I can craft. 
---
It works, not the best. But no need for a metric shit ton of ammo and heavy weapon. Can't heal everyone at once, selective healing that way. Along with if everyone is melee then flamer might be best due to attack everything and healing at the same time.
---
I say beat game as in "I've done all main quests" im but a low level 72 with the all rise hammer and brotherhood gear
---
Less hope more dream
---
Never crashed for me on PC with the charging barrel, just FYI.

CRYING IN LOW BUDGET
---
No, because Vamp and 2 shot are tier 1 effects.
---
Adrenaline foe sure 
---
I collect as many Nocturnal Wood Leg armors as I can per day.  Business is good!!
---
They also didn't include any of the melee finishers from F4, woulda made melee actually entertaining to use... 
---
Dude, for the most part people leave you alone. The only real way your teaming up with others is if your looking to. If you like playing solo I promise you 95% of the time you will be dolo.  But honestly teaming up with others makes the game a lot more enjoyable, wish more people were open to it.
---
So: caps.city works. However, Reddit insists on adding the "https://" prefix without the subdomain "www" while adding a link to a post. I spent some time on the phone with my Domain Name Service (who shall remain nameless) 
---
\*cough\*godaddy\*cough\* 
---
They say making [https://caps.city](https://caps.city) forward to https://www.caps.city will never happen, because "The subdomain (www) needs to be present in the url."
---
TLDR: 
---
We have to use [www.caps.city](https://www.caps.city) if we want to link on reddit -.-
---
I have my camp set up at New Gad. Great flat location, has water too. Only thing I didn't take into account was the super mutant camp. Every few minutes I have to kill the mutants that are shooting my house.
---
Tried to do the same thing,  I’ll get all my extra boiled water, plans , recipes and healing salves and I’ll I’ll go meet and greet new players or help them find good starting loot , every single time I get the asshole who thumbs me down  and then tries to attack me -level 70 in x-01!!!  I’m like WTF REALLY!! So I walk away and next thing I know I’m being shot at and grenaded by a mob of low level newbs  and the dipshit I tried to help is attacking me at level 2 as I’m walking away .its immensely annoying!!!
---
Dont forget to toss a few mini nukes or orbital strikes at the cunts with all the turrets at whitesprings killing all the ghouls.
---
This game is exactly how I've  imagined  for years a multiplayer Fallout game to be.
---
It's not the teaming up with others, it's the pvp, I'm not typically a fan of it in games like these. I'll have to give it a shot though, too much of an FO fanboy
---
I gotten about 80 hours into it before I got bored as a single player. I enjoyed most of that time (never enjoyed fighting scorchbeasts and other monotonous parts of the game). Fallouy 76 is more of a survival looter shooter game that has some lore and a cool world along with it. If you like that kind of stuff, then yeah, it's worth getting.
---
Please keep this updated!
---
I had a couple of mole rats that were 5 below me underground for a defend the base task and they never surfaced.
---
I had a mongrel dog below ground that showed up as a long stick floating through the air.  I think that he was carrying it around in his teeth...  A Frag Grenade blew him out of the grown into the air and then his body landed above ground.
---
So, yeah, there are definitely spawning glitches in the game.
---
I also have run across a new one.  when I take off my T-60 power armour and then put it back on, sometimes not all of the pieces will be reattached (i.e. one leg piece, etc.) and I have to manually put them back on.
---
Why do chainsaws
---
1. Do no more than two damage?
---
2. Spawn only at level twenty (not lower, or higher. Ever)?
---
3. Deal damage slowly? The ripper is very fast, and it's essentially the same thing.
---
4. Have a scope?
---
Platform:Xbox One
---
Gamertag: xXTH3xSICKN3SSX
---
its the entire lobby :/
---
cant even see friends on the map
---
Thank you, will have to do that.
---
Making things less effective by lowering spon rates or some other form of nerf will just make one side mad, and the other side happy. Simply "buffing" other places would drasticaly lower the number of nukes droped there keeping the farmers happy and improving the experiance for the newer players. Lastly this can be annoying and some people will disagrea simply on pricipal but if the place is nuked and you dont want it to be you can litteraly just jump to a differant server where its not. 
---
I added a level 1 guy and told him I'd help him out if he needed (I'm level 17) He messaged me and said thanks.
---
Next day he joined me... The level 1 was his second character. He was actually level 102. He started talking, told me he was Japanese and doesn't speak English very well, but likes talking. I said that's all good. He came to my camp, built me some industrial purifiers, a fusion generator, and dropped some plans for me. Then he left and I haven't seen him since.
---
No. I don’t believe it does, and if it does affect it, it’s negligible. I maxed out my budget and not gained anything by leveling. If you’re maxed out on your budget, experiment by deleting one turret and see how many decorative items you can place. It’s not your level, it’s what you choose to put down. I had zero turrets and built a 3 tiered 5x7 foundation concert hall, with an upstairs VIP section/inn and restaurant. Outside was a fusion generator and a walled off junk extractor. This is not an exaggeration. 
---
Is that just a regular bear? Like not a yao guai, just a bear?
---
What system you on, bby? 
---
Really the only way to stop them is for everyone to stop overpaying for goods and be more open with information.  As of now there appears to be an unspoken rule that if you get a rare recipe or plan to say nothing about how you obtained it.  That kind of secrecy only adds to the value of an item.  If everyone knew that simply going and getting an item off the found or from a quest was all it took, the items value would decrease.  In addition, no one can argue that TSE weapons are king, but they are far from rare.  Duping has turned a rare resources into nearly vendor trash.  I’m all for paying for items, but to pay 15k for a TSE anything when dupers have 30+ of them in their inventories is asinine.  The only way to truly stop duping and all methods is to devalue the items and thus cause the incentive to be lost.  300 TSE weapons aren’t very good when they are only 1k a piece and not accepted as trades.
---
Its too late. Was murdered per my request.
---
Yeah I hear you. But I tell you what, this online community is different from any other game I’ve played. It’s not like gta5 or rdr. Where people just shoot you the moment they see you. 
---
I have no turrets and all I have is a 2 storey house and my budget is almost full. 
---
I can second this I cashed out with 60k ish candy with friends and I got a few descent 1 stars totalled up to 12 1 stars
---
If the rollback is what causes the items to be duped, can't Bethesda just patch it so that the items they dropped before disconnecting are also affected by it(the rollback) and thus poofed out of existence?
---
That's really cool. What platform? I'd like to come see your camp. 
---
Pretty much. A level 60 character is as powerful as a level 500. At that point it all depends on gear. 
---
At lvl 13 I found a nice quite spot near Summersville for setting up my C.A.M.P. Despite it being a wide open area it wouldn't let me place my shack giving me the "item is floating" error. so I logged off to see if that helped at all. Logged back in again to be immediately attacked by a scorchbeast and a pack of high level ghouls.  
---
After the inevitable, I hung around as a corpse for a bit to see if it would bugger off. Damn thing just kept circling me like a vulture. So I respawned back at Vault 76 losing my burden of junk and made another C.A.M.P. someplace safer.  
---
Moral of the story? Fast travel to your existing C.A.M.P. when you hit your limit. Moving your C.A.M.P. someplace new just to dump your stuff when you are carrying too much is lazy and risky.
---
Oh okay. I just built the shotgun one. Didn't know the other machine gun one was explosive bullets. Still doesn't make sense that they have explosive bullets though. Why is that a thing now? 🤔
---
I'll show you 15000cap  
---
Please do.
---
Yeah. Locking off your base is a weird choice I’ll never understand. Even if you’re roleplaying, why choose the “selfish” trait for that character? Not only that, but his base is literally locking off content from other players. It’s a small thing, but finding that bunker was one of the coolest exploration moments I’ve had in the game. Robbing other players of that experience isn’t roleplaying selfish, it’s choosing in real life to be a selfish person. 
---
Who is this essay to? 
---
i give them to random people i meet. 
---
On a separate note.  Dupers are not only villains.  Bethesda has a lot of bullet sponge style enemies that are a huge drain on resources to fight.  I remember trying to kill a regular scorchbeast with non explosive weapons, it was awful and way too protracted for such a plentiful enemy.  Ammunition was always painfully low and resources were being wasted crafting and repairing severely overused weapons.  Like it or not the game is easier and somewhat more enjoyable with the easily available duped items we all seem to have and complain about.
---
Nice I love the Blair Witch Project
---
True that
---
24 asshole.
---
Thanks so much for this post, I’ve had my camp next to that substation for weekend and never discovered it! 
---
I got a scorched officer with a Bravo code by the way.

 Let this time launching of the bombs be our salvation..

Chicago Brotherhood did this. Difficult times require drastic solutions and Appalachia is in very difficult times
---
He may be slightly messed up in the head, but you gotta respect the hustle. Man pulled off some spec ops mission tracking you to your camp, gathering intel, then proceeded to get a nuclear keycard (not an easy feat in my experience), cleared out the shitstorm of a nuclear bunker, then straight up nuked a nuke. THEN he did the same thing AGAIN, and nuked a nuke that nuked a nuke. 
---
Honestly he was probably in the Marines
---
If you didn't get the memo, we're not doing "To the (x)" posts anymore. It's 2019. 
---
I have honestly hoped that the community could come to a consensus on a drop place.  I think there are always suitcases by train stations, and that’s usually where I drop my extra stuff.
---
I believe the first time I went to Whitespring was at level twenty something with my brother. We couldn't even get power armor yet. Hadn't done enough of the main quest line. It was great killing the feral ghoulfers. Lol
---
This needs to happen yesterday!
---
I was grinding white springs with a random level 5 i met at an event i cant remember, it was going great and they were level 7 at that point. A random level 160 showed up and started killing mobs to, thats fine we can all share. For some reason they seamed to think my team mate was also a goul, funny thing. That was the first time i had encountered anything like that. I was very confused but they left after i killed them a couple times. Some people just do stuff like that, maybe it makes them feel good about themselves, maybe they need to get their eyes checked, who knows.
---
I do this as well. 
---
Good point! I was reading someone question about god roll weapons and thought about this one.
---
Lot of possible reasons given, but it's probably because the guy was a dick. There are always people like that, in any game... or real life.
---
Get some bigger boys to beat him up.
---
Does it exceed normal building limitations with said furnishings and allow further upgrades?
---
The rollback, by definition, rolls the server back to a save (for them) before they dropped the items. The only way to prevent this is to disable all possible rollbacking.
---
I’m always checking suitcases at stations. Found some good stuff at white springs occasionally 
---
Why can't players communicate by text? I play at home and I don't want my girlfriend see me yelling at the mic. I want to talk to other players by texting.
---
What about the poop sock? 
---
Honestly you did a good thing but you only slowed them down a little. These lads will walk around with 1.2 tonnes worth of dupes from a single session.
---
The top photo was the score someone grabbed off a group of them after watching them for a little bit using invis. It does not take long to turn a few items into 1.2 tonnes worth. 
---
Its really up to Bethesda because i don't even know how they can undo eight weeks of damage with it. With each week more and more seem to be willing to  do it.
---
Just do your best watch the map and keep an eye on people sitting still for a long time. Never hurts to double check on them.
---
dumpsterception?
---
Yea lots of the 1* farms go in there
---
If I attached wires to it before I left, would all the stuff still work? (All the stuff that uses the electricity, I mean). Or would it just not supply any energy?
---
Yeah I realized the codes have bravo as well.
---
My running theory is that it goes through loot lists in alpabetized order. That may sound stupid, once I'm more sure I'll post my findings.
---
Dont quote me but this sounds like the 'PVP Factions' thing everyone is talking about.
---
Mine included
---
Still got him?
---
I do not recall it working for him when he tried either. But that part I can't really recall 100%
---
I think dying is part of the build. Take out as many baddies before you fall in combat. Invest in demolition perk and pickup last laugh in the luck tree for yummy XP when you do die.
---
I kind of agree and disagree at the same time. Some people just love melee weapons more than projectile weapons. But at the same time, Bethesda made them way OP and all projectiles are literally NERF toys with barely any damage, even with perks. The game is seriously unbalanced when it comes to damage. I understand why some people have switched to melee exclusively when they realized how all the guns are. Especially energy weapons. What a joke. I use an auto grenade launcher almost exclusively that I love. I just wish there was a "Hit the Deck" perk like in New Vegas. Sick of killing myself. Lol 😂🤣 😆
---
I thought containers were individualized. If you dropped something in one would another player be able to pick it up?
---
I made a fusion generator at a Bro's base and hooked up the wires before I left. It works for him. 
---
I've never seen any hostility towards low levels being in the nuke zone. I'd be surprised if I did and I'd defend the lower level if they were new players. What is wrong with people!? 
---
Don't know how to upload to youtube??
---
thats a bit silly
---
It's broken and I don't expect it to ever be fixed.
---
Jokes on him, I got the Tricentennial for cheaper than the base game, cause fire sale...
---
Happened to me today during the last step for the mayor of the day quest. Fucking lame. 
---
You can make ammunition with shit you find on the ground. Literal garbage. Play the game. 
---
There’s only one way you can lift the curse and rid yourself of your screaming ancestors. You must make your way to watoga and kill the scorch beast queen. The road will be long the road will be tough......nah jk just hop servers you should be fine
---
Only looting containers is.  Like for adhesives or typewriters or screws and so on.  If you place an item in a container though it is held for a time period.
---
😂
---
Good to know. I'll start dropping stuff at the train station then.
---
Do you know HOW MANY times that happened to me and my buddy when we first tried launching nukes? We tried so many times before we got all the way through to launch. Disconnected every single time for so long. Then when we did get it launched, and got to the Queen... disconnected. And now I get a nuke launched and head to WS or Fissure or wherever and I get disconnected a few times during the run. I just come on back in and hope the Queen is still alive
---
It's 2019, you don't have to use "salt" to express frustration or anger anymore. 
---
Reddit is so god damn gross. 
---
I posted about this not too long ago and the consensus was that the people setting up turrets outside the clubhouse at WS are assholes and we should always tear their base up. 
---
Anything in your stored items?
---
Yes, you can build and crap to learn mods. For example, build a bunch of leather chest pieces and scrap them to learn the studded and treated versions. 
---
Pick up guns and armor in the world and scrap them to learn their mods, but check their level first; you can pick up higher level items as you level up. 
---
Love how ever single one is naked but still wears a distinctive headgear/head of a different job
---
I hereby dub them, the „Village people 76“
---
Nah it is hooked to a battery but you cant connect it to anything
---
But doesn't it just makes for more fun?? I mean, the point of playing games is to have fun, so OBVIOUSLY they considered that when implementing this feature. ERGO, it MUST be more fun than the alternative!! 😬
---
Server hoping should not be a 'required' mechanism in this game in my opinion, Bethesda aren't dumb, so they must understand what is happening at Whitesprings but choose to ignore it. This leads me to believe they are sanctioning players farming XP and legendaries at this location and making real world money of of the game. It helps maintain a player base.
---
See, that's exactly what happened to me. Damage was low when I made the post. I left the game running and fast travelled somewhere and it went back to normal. After helping some people out I went back to my camp and it was low again from then on. Something is definitely up with it
---
Well you can but it comes down to efficiency.  For example in the heavy gun world, the Gatling gun is amazing.  It does a good deal of damage, has a high durability, and it’s ammo cost per return is very good.  Then take its cousin the mini gun.  Breaks fast, poor damage per shot, and bad ammo cost due to high expenditure.  That by itself creates a want for only one weapon type.  Same for assault rifles and combat rifles and shotgun.  They all have high returns for ammo.  While I do agree that it is coming off the ground to manufacture there are other things do be done in the game other than constantly farm and be worried about mats.  All that causes the current meta to favor high damage, high durability, low cost weapons.  And now we have duping TSE to fill that need.  It sucks but it was going to happen with that or something else cause of the need and it being an MMO now instead of single player.
---
Oh my god thank you. I had 33% of my budget in stored items!
---
LMAO some Secret service work right here, dedication 
---
Yeah, I always bring along a endangerol stringer to SBQ fights
---
So I have found out lol
---
Somebody won the lottery. Everyone elses life is invalidated.
---
Hopping servers does sound easy, but I like the first option better. I knew reading The Hobbit would pay off. Time to fight Smaug, The Scorchbeast Queen and recover what's mine; the ability to play without the screams of my ancestors haunting me everynight.
---
Sick. Thanks.
---
Np
---
Well heres hoping that Bethesda had something big planned to fix it once and for all.
---
The thing that worries me how do you exactly undo the damage done from thr past eight weeks?.
---
How do you undo it when people have alts running around with 1.2 literal tonnes of duped items each?.
---
Does it stack per player?
---
I guess that they could also fix it by making the stuff you leave on the ground or containers only lootable by you. It would be annoying having to trade every time we want to give other player a few stimpaks or a bottle of water but we would still be able to do it.
---
That I'm not sure about. It's usually to laggy or hectic to test it.
---
Or just increase the stash size. I'm tired of having to use weight perks because I want to collect armor sets and have a bunch of good weapons.
---
Literally 41 GB of rocket Science ;)
---
True xD
---
Yeah but I do now having at least one helps lol
---
Hey man let them buy what they want. Thats how those of us just grinding and saving what we earn in game. get the DLC for free. They wanna spend their money go right on ahead. It benefits the rest of us.
---
I don’t think you’re supposed to eat those...
---
Personally, I'm happy playing the game using my personal strategy, as an explorer.  Like you, I am just finding things as I go.  I don't get any enjoyment out of people just handing me things.
---
But, if someone wants to use a bug to make it easier to get through the game, that's fine by me.  Everyone plays the game a bit differently.  
---
I've learned long ago never to measure my enjoyment based on how others think or behave, especially in games.  Just enjoy the moment...
---
I’m a nomad I don’t really have a built up camp 
---
Its bug its not totally gone.. i had it last night too. I tried scan and repair and somehow tht fixed it.
---
This location was north of Flatwoods between the Flatwoods lookout and Relay Tower EM-B1-27. It was a great starter CAMP, but I've seen plenty of other houses all over the map. Just gotta keep your eyes open and explore everyone you come across.
---
Both I have slugger and riflemen perks so I can use my gauss rifle and my super sledge effectively 
---
Jesus. Lighten up.
---
shhhhhh!
---
Yup.
---
I was super low level and there was someone with me that boosted its level 
---
*Whoever
---
Using these types.
---
Note : it can go much higher as well.
---
He had way bigger expenses then you - should have relocated your camp two more times just for the laughs of him wasting resources 
---
I don’t think you could without causing it to simply shift.  Let’s say they get rid of all the TSE weapons, just a blanket removal legitimately obtained or not.  Heck let’s say the remove them all together.  Now problem solved the dupers have worthless stock and destroy them.  But that’s not gonna fix it, cause what about melee with instigating and 40% blah blah blah.  Now they are duping that and finding new ways to do it.  Best solution that would also cause the most blowback, stop making legendaries be random.  If you get an explosive gun it’s cause it comes from completing a quest and it’s fixed, no more worries, everyone is the same and that’s it.  Other than that, I don’t think the damage can be reversed.  The dupes are all the same item wise and only change when you add or subtract a mod, so there’s no easy fix.
---
If no one is getting banned then Bethesda is the problem.
---
Keeping exploits quite never works and goes beyond someone being overly optimistic to being plain ignorant.
---
All that will happen is people will do their "Hush hush" bullshit and people will still use the exploits and Bethesda will never fix them.
---
No. When you want to start getting every card and moving points around leveling is a pain if you're not hardcore grinding at Whitesrping.
---
Nobody is forcing you people to buy this stuff. Seriously. Just ignore it.
---
Hmmm no but seeing alot more of these post lately and i guess there is something to it.
---
That, .50 caliber balls, cannonballs, and mini nukes. 40mm grenades, and 2mm cartridges. All have a lot of weight to them. A bit more than I’d expect but that’s why I was always over encumbered. Once I learned this I dropped from nearly 210 to 120. No joke. 
---
Tan business suit with a cap on. eating radx  with my gas mask on.  Run and gun with my crap shotgun. Kept backpedaling and never died.  Ran away after I ran out of radx

No but I will now thanks.
---
The T-60 variation looks very r/vaporwaveaesthetics
---
Special points do not increase damage with projectile  weapons, so even if someone were to to have this not sure what this would change. The fact that they are taking so much damage in pacifist mode is what is confusing. 
---
I don't think so.
---
Yeah same but having a unique sound would be awesome 
---
Yes, but max level is under 50 so the use is pretty worthless. 
---
The Mothman Church is available for weddings and functions, for more information please enquire with one of our friendly high priests. We are open every day except for Tuesday evenings when we hold the senior's bingo night.
---
Pity they didn't throw out an invite to everyone, with the new tuxedos in  the atom store I would have dressed up and sat on the bench in attendance.
---
Same happened here. The invincibility glitch was never patched as far as I’m aware. Plus there’s always hacks. Or players may have broke the legendary mod(sentinels I think. 15% damage reduction when not moving) and absolutely abused it and stacked it. Taken chems. One trick I noticed was that the player has a perk card (if health drops below XX% a stimpak is used) them that stacked with the medic pump and all that shit just adds up. Medics guns. That all can add up. 
---
However this most likely wasn’t the case and was probably a glitch or hack. 
---
Its not a huge waterfall, pretty tiny actually, but the only real one I've found so far. Everything else has just been downhill streams and rapids. 
---
If by “tookover” you men some people were in your camp and maybe using your stuff then you were the one to initiate PvP and would have only done minimal damage until the fought back. Not sure otherwise.
---
I guess people just like the look of that Commie rifle 
---
The Bear Arms perk doesnt work on the Auto Gernade launcher :(
---
I don't know how it works. Just that it does.  Glitch on glitch.
---
Says you. I still use my own lv45 raider suit whenever I'm in a place where the jetpacks on my other suits will be useless.
---
i was thinking if i had enough bolstering gear with the 15% less damage while either still or sprinting i could reduce the damage enough
---
I can craft all jetpack suits on any armor. Explain to me why I'd pick raider?
---
Because it looks Mad Max af fam
---
Don’t mean to be a stick in the mud, but a lot of modern day games have this feature, yeah it’s really cool, but it’s pretty commonplace
---
Raider vendors only sell Treated and Resistant. I heard that Uranium Fever can drop Protected (if you have Treated and Resistant  learned) and Shielded (if you have Protected learned). I haven't mined the Levelled Lists yet to confirm. I have had no luck with drops either. Might go confirm it tomorrow if I still have no luck.

I did get Marine Protected from Surface to Air two days ago, and Marine Shielded from Census Violence today, so can confirm those two. And the source of that info is the same for Raider and Uranium Fever, so I probably should trust the source. Check the Reddit posts for underarmor and you can find that info.
---
You can’t do the store it glitch anymore. The only way to get the cooking stove or “cooking stove variant 4” is to buy the plan “Plan: Cooking Stove”. This is the exact name. There are other plans that are similar to it such as Plan: Kitchen Stove or Plan: Wood Stove. So make you check the name before you buy it.
---
Go where you want, do whatever you want.
---
Die.
---
Repeat.
---
I have the tri-centennial edition... I do even have the salute. 😂
---
Nice. I've been exploring and have found some interesting things. A scarecrow effigy on a cliffside. A Halloween seance with four skeletons spread out around a blanket where they died. I take pictures every time I stumble across things like that. 
---
Same here did,this a couple of hours ago with my buds.
---
Can't blame you, haven't even seen those paints myself yet. I did, however, buy the hotter rod paints from the atom shop today, my first time spending atoms no less, because of the r/vaporwaveaesthetics feel the T-60 variation has. 
---
I'll still busy out that raider armor in tight spaces though. 
---
The very first SB I killed solo landed high up in a tree and I never did get the loot lol

Playing on Xbox One

Time: just now and over the last week.
---
Event: I cannot launch my first nuke: (level 83 now) each time I nearly complete the mission I am disconnected from the server. 
---
I’m about done. I’m very sad as I was a huge fallout fan and have been carrying the torch against the hate for this game: but I’ve lost hours to this glitch. 
---
Nothing like that. I had claimed the munitions factory and then they tried to claim it. When I went in to defend, I was able to land a bunch of decent, center mass shots with a TSE that did zero damage. 
---
They were red to me, so we were definitely in pvp mode
---
God I hate the green pipboy light. I want the ability to make the light white 
---
Well of all the FPS games I've played, this is the first one in which I've noticed. And it was neat. 
---
How the hell do you do this
---
How!?
---
It really is. Sometimes it’s nice to slow down and appreciate what the devs made for you.
---
I've found an inactive dwemer automaton. It is now one of my favorite loading screens. 
---
Some other great examples of glitches you let hang around for far too long:
---
* EXP glitch using disarm traps was in the beta. It was reported, in the beta.
---
* The weight glitch which allowed people to walk around with inventories into the 20000 plus. This also was reported very early on.
---
* The stash glitch which has allowed dupers to store their 1000s of weapons and armor which cause instability to the game itself. I could have literally sent you a playlist of youtubers who shared this while you knew of the duplication glitch.
---
Saw the plan on cambell park vendor i was lvl 150.
---
we just had a guy at a WS nuke run who was getting smacked down by his mom or wife over his open mic
---
If they released modkit all of their bugs would have been patched by now. Hell we would have probably gotten a whole new addition to the map, better inventory management, maybe even 4k textures...
---
But i guess they're trying to integrate creation club first before supporting mods for FO76. 
---
It kinda sucks that ''unique'' items like All Rise, Perfect Storm, Daisycutter, etc are all outclassed by random 1\* legendaries. I really don't like the whole Diablo like RNG legendary system that got introduced in F4 and that it's even worse in F76 since legendaries can have 3(5?) stars.
---
Keep googling and looking around for help. Some redditors have done the math to explain how the 20% health build is just nasty right now. I watched a YouTuber with this build brag about how high their damage was but they kept dying throughout the video. Best of luck to you.
---
I love the CAMP aspect of this game and the individuality it brings to each play session. I only wish the budget was a little more, I’d love to be able to add a bit more decoration and personal touch into my little hidey hole.
---
Two shot EXPLOSIVE on a shotgun is OP
---
OverPowered
---
Unfortunately not many people will be interested in a gun that's not 
---
1) level 50
---
And
---
2) has no (good) legendary effects 
---
Thats a pretty awesome build.. i like those pipe wirings. Good job man
---
It is definitely not worth $60 yet, especially when you consider what you got with the last ones. I picked it up for $30 and am happy with that.
---
Build a foundation on uneven ground with a staircase going up. Now build flooring off the top of the staircase in the outline of you structure. Now snap walls under the flooring to the second floor making your first floor walls. Now snap half walls under the walls you just made. You have now built walls into the ground and sealed off your personal crop and water production area.
---
The new build system is like PEMDAS. You just gotta play with order of operations.
---
It could save a few seconds but I imagine you’d still have the brief disconnect time followed by long load into new world so how much time could this feature really save?
---
Just got an anti armor swing speed buzz blade, time to try this 🤙
---
I havent even seen a single plan for raider armor itself lol
---
It was a daily challenge today to take a picture of you character while wearing only a hat
---
Good they will learn the hard way be a dick in 76 and the server is quick to turn on you.
---
(Immediately locks front door)
---
LoL
---
Super Duper is a perk in the Luck category. It gives a 10/20/30% chance to craft double the base amount of something.
---
Note that this effects **every** crafting recipe, including weapons and armor. The only thing it does Not effect is bulking material, so no blatant duplicating. 
---
yeah the damage is crazy but dying is very common
---
Great Shot m8
---
I'm about 100, so for me anything over 150 is high.
---
Very true, lol..I pretty much figured that player was being an asshole. I thought maybe there was something I was missing. He had like 200 in red so I am hoping someone got him. Because my game crashed I will never know.
---
I agree 100%.  It causes too much emphasis on particular stats and takes away from the weapons being unique.  I personally think they should have done like 3 and New Vegas where a Unique weapon was simple a better version or reskin of an existing weapon.  That said I think if they implemented that now they would lose a lot of people to having items that they legitimately worked or traded for being lost.  Then again Blizzard did that and they still went strong.  Never got my warriors gun back or my Hunter’s one handed swords lol
---
I would, but that crashes my game. You know how Amazon Cloud Servers are.
---
Yep said this before hard to blame the exploiters when they allow them to remain active for eight weeks even right now as we speak still... for almost three weeks horray!.
---
The chameleon mutation, huh?
---
So you are just running around naked then. Creeps me out to think there is some invisible naked dude just in the corner while he is pooping....
---
Totally forgot about that, but it is gone now. Thanks for the reminder
---
Explosive, bloodied, limb damage .50 cal for 200 caps
---
Best day ever 
---
Yeah.... someone tag the Bethesda account because I dont know how to do that lol.
---
If you have turrets setup to shoot the ghouls at the golf club, you’re a tool and someone...maybe me...maybe not, is gonna smash your shit. 
---
Also, some people really seem to care about a rare vendor spawn
---
THANKS! I knew all the tricks of F04 but it's a bit trickier in this game
---
It’s RNG.  However if you see the + symbol after the name of a weapon then it has a higher chance of you learning a mod from it when scrapped.  That is until you’ve learned all the mods possible to learn through scrapping for that weapon.
---
Possibly assassin / sentinel armour. Igloo did a video testing it against a TSE shotgun and was taking zero damage ( as long as he had AP). At work on my phone or I'd link the video.
---
Had this happen today with a monstrosity base 40 ft away from where my beautiful mini settlement is. At least build on the extractor site 
---
Odds are it was a bunch of sentinel/assassin armor.  enough of that can give you 100% damage-reduction versus players if you aren't moving.
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
Are the plans you listed what you have or what you want?
---
The dad built it. It wasnt a company. As for what it uses idk. Maybe it's a 3d printer lol
---
God I wish we had this kinda stuff but IIRC Todd said something like “in fact you’ll never even see a server” at the e3 release.
---
I would love to host a private server that could allow mods and anybody who tried to join needed those mods installed.
---
Personally I don’t care about lower levels, I’ll leave them alone. My problem comes when they just follow me around and loot everything I kill and don’t do anything
---
Build mechanics as so different. A couple more I can tell you: floors, foundations, and stair cases don’t have health bars and cannot be destroyed. Build your roofing out of flooring instead of roofing and you’ll be impervious to aerial scorchbeast attacks, orbital strike grenades, and artillery. Wire things through your roof made of flooring by using the wire mesh, then use the replace button when storing to switch it back to solid wood. Also, the campfire under the lights section is the new “rug glitch” method. Place location restricted items on a corner of one and move the campfire wherever you want
---
Probably those damn youtubers again.
---
My game freezes about every fifth time I get out of PA, and sometimes when I JUMP 
---
We can do it using the poor man's way. If you have completed the Enclave missions then you get the salute pose in camera mode. So we can still salute for free, it just takes a couple of extra steps to do it the clunky way :P
---
Thank you very much!! I'd heard something about wire flooring. I'm building a new camp tomorrow and really appreciate the info
---
I don't have my camp interfering with gameplay, ect. It is far from high level enemies. Been there since day 2 of the Beta. Like I said, I can understand if it is interfering with gameplay but many people's aren't.
---
some bitch kept jumping in front of me at whitesprings earlier while i was killing ghouls, until he finally got tagged. then he one shotted me for 76 caps and took my loot. fucking griefers in this game. pisses me off.
---
Lucky you. When I first loaded up the game, some random dude was talking about some random ass stuff while I was creating my character and I said something like “yo, can you STOP talking or mute your mic, please?” And he was just like  “OH SHIT THERES VOICE CHAT?” Then proceeded to repeat the N-word numerous times for like 2 minutes straight.
---
Good gawd :0
---
Guessing they didn't want it because it said bloodied 50 cal. 
---
That T-60 variation is my favorite, very r/vaporwaveaesthetics
---
I haven't seen any games doing this? Usually when a GM, or a community outlet announces something, it's about some ingame event. Though to be fair they just said "Let's take some picture together", so I don't feel they shouldn't have posted it or anything.
---
Player-organised meetings though? Sure, those happen all the time.
---
That one is a 2 shot explosive legendary with Ultracite ammo. But I think Hardened also does the same damage increase without the additional scorched damage.
---
You are pretty much giving the tools to your enemy. The Responders didn't die off from just Scorched. They died off by losing half there roster from a basic enemy and then finished off by the Scotched. Take a guess what really killed Responders.
---
"I bought a duped gun and it disappeared! Screw you bethesda!" 🙄 no sympathy from me. 
---
Will add ^^
---
I don't think anybody playing cares much beyond xp farming and wetting themselves over legendary weapons. Bethesda definately don't care as they are a profit driven company obviously and they are working on new content to maintain sales, fixing old bugs doesn't make money, it just distracts software engineers from maintaining the revenue stream.
---
Nice offer, when I was a level 25 I would have loved it. The .50 Cal gun is great!!
---
I have x2 level 50 .50 Cal machine with legendary effects on PC that is up for free if anyone wants one too.
---
I picked up a couple of them (I am a heavy gun player and other people always drop the heavy guns first). I have a better .50 cal now so now I have 3 guns for no reason at all.
---
Haven't dropped or sold them to a vendor yet because it feels like a waste.
---
One is a Double .50 Cal (twice as much rounds capacity, not to be confused with a 2 shot)
---
And the other is a Mutants .50 Cal (10% more damage if you are mutated).
---
What's "garunteed" ?
---
Well I absolutely use the junk extractor at my camp. I have been using the same spot for camp since day 2 of the Beta, when I found it. Sure it took my awhile to get what I needed to build the extractor but I use it. I keep my camp unlocked for anyone to use things or take junk. I just don't get why people do it to those who aren't hurting gameplay. There are many spots with a junk extractor so if one day I can't get my spot, I will get another one. It isn't that big of a deal. 
---
I saw another post that suggested that junk in its most destroyed form should be weightless and I 100% agree, as I’m a builder too and my stash is mostly materials.
---
Mysterious saviour perk card will revive you sometimes. Good for soloing or this build in this case
---
I would like to have mutants one please
---
Nah, you need to turn on pacifist or stop bitchin and dish it.
---
Convenient that our troops are welcomed with opens arms into the Enclave.  Use all the tools available to accomplish the mission.  Nukes and X-01 come in handy.  Ad Victoriam!
---
The main cause of that hostility is one low level player is generally ruining the spot for anyone else at whitesprings. Five high level players farming legendaries? Well now half the mobs are dropping level 10 legendaries and they all have to server hop or just leave, so one person can spend an hour looking for holotapes. While there's still definitely no cause for hostility, its not entirely their own fault, its just very bad unintentional design.
---
 Whitesprings has one of the best spawn rates, with a large variety of shops and reinforcements if needed, the park can spawn pretty much whatever it feels like, deathclaws, bears, honeybeasts, etc. There's in the territory of 6ish legendaries in shooting distance of one spot, and with bethesda's level scaling, its almost by design, the ideal place for high level players to be. There's better legendary farming spots if you're alone and don't mind server hopping, but not many better exp spots. 
---
You can say all you want how the inside shouldn't effect the implied level of the outside, but no matter what level the outside quests are designed for, high levels will be trafficking in and out on a regular basis, which will spike up the levels of nearby spawnrates. 
---
tl;dr
---
Level scaling makes it a bad spot for low level players to (Safely) quest, and a bad spot for high level players to farm if any low  level players are trying to quest (Safely or not), because it only takes one person happening to walk by to ruin it for anyone not near their level range. 
---
I saw the hot rod skin in the atom store and I didn't like the look of the X01 skin but your picture makes it look way cooler (the colors look way better). Now I am wondering if I should get it....
---
The wendigo is easy 
---
No matter how many weeks the glitch exists, you don't have to use it. It's still cheating and the cheater is responsible. You can blame others, but it's pretty much like saying: "blame the gun manufactors, not me, they made the gun, I just shot him".
---
The sweetest tears
---
Done. What's your username?
---
Wish I remembered which wire I cut I found this at level 5. All I got for it was a bunch of scrap.
---
it was 1 v 4. i could have killed them all with my tse shotgun, but i'm there to farm ghouls. not participate in the 1 shot challenge
---
Hunter_57
---
I have only met one hostile person out of the like 50 or so people I have met, it’s really cool because we all kinda are struggling out in the wasteland and don’t have time for a petty squabble.
---
Oh and the level 100+’s don’t give a shit about us low levels so that’s another reason nobody is hostile.
---
Ha! I just posted the same thing!
---
Scorched Queen and maybe AWOL Armaments.
---
However, you have a high chance of multiple 2 or 3 stars in each Whitespring nuke and Uranium Fever event.
---
Random event?
---
There is an animation missing between the frozen state and the animated alive state, it's jarring but this game is a work in progress.
---
Still, turn on pacifist.
---
That last questions a little personal, don’t you think?
---
Friend Request send, let me know when you are online next.
---
Yeah you should report it with a video. On ps4, I had a similar issue where a SBQ would drop just a heart and brain and a piece of armor. Super mutants give off better loot lately.
---
how are people supposed to know if a guns duped? also, even if the gun is duped, still bethesda's fault. the buyer of a gun in this game shouldn't have to worry about if a gun is duped, but guess what, they do because "it just works"
---
There is no confirmed source that I am aware of. Its speculation due to the statements by Bethesda. 
---
Is it an temporary item? I only have 500 atoms at the moment.
---
I'm in game
---
Sadly I have experienced several veteran level players who do the same. It would seem out of boredom. It's sad as I would love to continue to keep my more expensive things out as the house doesn't quite feel like home unless it's complete. The other day one of my friends who is also a veteran and high level had his base destroyed by someone I actually had traded with off of the bazaar. I messaged him asking why he would do such a thing, and he said simply because my friends base "was placed where his was usually." And that my friend shouldn't have left it there. When I chased him down he either left the server or blocked me. How childish....why not just go into another server? SMH.
---
Does it change the thought at all if it’s an invisible naked woman?
---
How in the fuck does that affect you? This is whining for the sake of whining, chillax and play the game. 
---
Yeah AWOL armaments has a 3 star legendary at the end of the last wave everytime you do the event
---
.....I am embarrassed to say so but yes. Yes it does *blush*
---
Well that sucks cuz ima dude 
---
I wouldn't risk it, I've got 4 other mods for supersledge and I can't seem to put any of them on the all rise
---
Reading through all the entries in the terminals during the mistress of mysteries quest line, it says the actress' husband, boyfriend or whatever he was to her(did this line, like, the 3rd day after release. Can't remember.) invented it himself.  Since it seems to need all the ingredients of whatever in pumps out, it doesn't seem too advanced, either. 
---
I Saw that too. It's not fair. :(
---
it's up for 1 day only
---
*Jumps into a shower sobbing*
---
"Still not clean....."
---
i downvoted you, and the reason is that without two shot and explosive, the guns in this game are incredibly weak. like trying to take out a tank with a bb gun weak
---
I did it solo at level 50 with no issue. 
---
You can clear the silos at level 35. It's not too bad. PA tends to be the only thing you really need if you don't have alot of defense perks.
---
Will that work with the Brahmin pen?
---
It’s basically me living out clay aiken’s dream
---
Aw, I hope that it wil be added again amd that it isn't a one time only item. I don't support micro transactions, so I'm not going to buy atoms.
---
Trust me. that place is toxic as hell.
---
Hey man add me Kiwiryan 
---
Will do as soon as I can! 
---
check out your challenges list, a lot of them are really easy to do and reward 40-80 atoms, you might be able to get enough for the skin.
---
Exactly 😂
---
I’m a bit higher but happy to help and shot the shit
---
That sounds like a really comfy way to play! I never got a Vita since it couldn't play my classic PSP games, but that's still neat.
---
Same and I just used a normal baseball bat took me 30 mins to run thro it. Wasn’t very hard
---
Jericdarcy (psn gamertag), I usually play in the evenings, 9pm GMT. Drop me a team invite if you see me online, I'm level 18.
---
You can’t 
---
auto stim + vampires + spamming the stims maybe? i have a vampires explosive 10mm pistol and a couple shots and i'm at full health
---
Moth-man is a great friend, you just got to know him a little, give him a chance you know? How could you reject such a cute face? https://imgur.com/gallery/qrW9fJo
---
I don't think I have enough time to finish enough challenges to get 900 atoms within a day. I'm probably stil going to try. At least I have enough atoms if I fail :)
---
hmm, this is good info. thanks for the heads up

Did my first during at level 31. Wasn't too bad. Now at 159 the silos are a joke
---
are you the gatekeeper?
---
Never trust a faction, dear, that doesn’t let one wear a nice dress.
---
1. The cap limit is specific to the player not the whole server. Even if you server hopped that vendor you cleaned out would still have 0 caps. Caps dont reset based on server.
---
2. The vendor inventory is player specific as well but it does reset by server. Even then you will not see what Jimmy two shoes sees when he access the same vendor because that is based on each player.
---
3. What you are describing is a well known visual bug that has been told repeatedly since the beta and if you actually paid attention you would know this.
---
4. As of a few patches ago the only thing that is server specific are items that are not in a container like random junk and cap stashes. Vendors are considered stashes however their INVENTORY changes by server. Not the caps (see 1).
---
Very possible. But stacking many of those, the perk card, auto atom armor, Vampires, using stimpaks, sure its a technique. But after a while you run out. If you’re using a TSE against them especially. Those stims aren’t gonna last forever. Even super stims. Vampires has too slow healing to make *much* of a difference. 
---
Or hazmat.
---
Have a nice day....
---
Ever figure this out I'm having same problem 
---
Nah, gotta drop 3* ghouls that drop 1* blamco
---
Leather cap from atom shop 💖
---
I think if you check the recent tab, it will last players from your last server. You can join them without adding as friend. I think.
---
Or equip power armor, and do it whenever because virtually nothing is a threat to you while you are in power armor. 
---
Add me blazemarko99 bro 
---
straight gas homie
---
Level 91 and playing since launch, and only realised this last few days as there have been a few people warning the newbies about this.
---
Same with perk cards, have such a random mess of perks and skills. Now at least am grinding for some good legendaries and reorganize my skills to be more top heavy with strength and perception. 
---
I like to server hop at the Charleston station to try and spawn the rare responder vendor. Inevitably I will load in to find a camp in the pond across the way preventing the spawn location from functioning. 
---
After shredding the offending camp I am usually sitting at about a 500cap bounty. 
---
That’s when it gets fun. It becomes a race to hop on a server, trigger the spawn, kill the Grafton monster for quick caps and if I feel brave zip up to the fire house to check the weight room for lead before the hunters find me. 
---
Sometimes all I get is lower level players searching but their lack of perception makes stalking them cloaked easy and I can play confusing sound effects off my phone through the mic.
---
just fyi the player can attach wires to a generator they don't have a plan for. they just can't edit the item and if they store it they won't be able to re-place it. i know because someone placed a generator in my camp and i connected wires to my extractor and water purifier, but after trying to move it i was unable to place it, and ended up having to scrap it.
---
I had a guy sneak in, and sit on the toilet for 15 mins, dropped a paper bag with spoiled meat inside.
---
Wrong. In any online games that take exploiting slightly more seriously than this (which wouldn't be much), everyone that the duped items go to would have been banned long ago. This game is as forgiving as it is. You don't go buy shady merchandise and go "sorry, officer, I have no idea". Doesnt work in game. Doesnt work in real life either. 
---
The would make a quality r/talesfromappalachia post tbh
---
Yup it sells the Hunter's Long Coat, which I am giving one away in another thread, as well as rare clock plans.
---
I thought it was fabricated when you said you had a team medic with a flamer, but then you said they ran out of ammo in 30 seconds and you reeled me back in
---
*distant doomslaying and heavy metal ensues*
---
You get longer than a day, its to allow all time zones to grab it, I have noticed it's around longer and I have guessed that's why...
---
Sticking directly to the question &amp; embedded suggestion originally posed —  **Can the Hacker and Picklock Perks Cost "0" Points to Use?** 
---
Most of the comments here are about the Perks Packs &amp; Cards system generally. I'm not crazy about it either, but Bethesda isn't likely to change it outright.
---
The original post, though, only suggests a tiny tweak — not a change to the whole system — on two parallel aspects of the game which have clear antecedents in the prior Fallout canon. We've been picking those locks with our bobby pins and hacking those terminal puzzles for a long time. (I'm especially font of Kate for all the Fallout 4 locks she picked for me; I loved hearing her fuss and fume in that sexy Irish accent, but I digress .....) There's a minor element of control-manipulation skill involved in the lock-picking, and there's a minor mental challenge for the hacking, both of which we're well accustomed, from the prior games, to investing. We've done so frequently, as part of major quests and at random, and in exchange for a ranged system of rewards. And we're used to these pickable locks and hackable terminals being spread ubiquitously throughout the landscape. 
---
What we've **not** been obliged to do in those earlier Fallout games, however, is the utterly boring, utterly mechanical, *purely time-wasting* task of moving the damn cards from one row to another. 
---
If you aren't picking locks and hacking terminals, the number of chances the game has to give you that great random drop is going to take a very serious hit. You're basically giving up on a portion of the content. And that's okay, if that's what you intend to do. But Bethesda ought not push people in that direction. **Indeed, lockpicking and terminal hacking cut across all play styles, all the time.**
---
Short of re-jiggering the whole perks/cards system, setting the cost to zero — making them like the "joker cards" in the deck? I'm having Fallout N.V. flashbacks — would cut down the volume of my tedious, time-wasted card-shuffling. That's time I'd rather spend exploring or interacting with other players or killing stuff or building stuff. 
---
It's *only* effect on game balance would be to prevent a lot of surprise attacks while we've got our noses in our PipBoys flipping the danged cards back and forth to pick a lock or hack a terminal. 
---
In terms of eliminating a pain-in-the-\*ss problem for literally every player on a constant basis, this would only require some modest coding — it should be an easy fix.
---
And I can't think of any practical or thematic arguments *against* this proposal. 
---
I'd like to see some plinking targets maybe even a skeet shooter for your base 
---
Every time I close my eyes, I wake up feeling so horny.
---
Someone made a fusion generator in my camp and did not attach wires. I was able to move it and attach wires. I don't have the plan.
---
I got another answer saying they *couldn’t* attach wires, so I added a “possibility” part in the edit just in case. I haven’t tested it myself so I’m not sure which is correct atm (could be their/your case might have been before/after a patch that might have changed the result. I’ll try to test it tomorrow and fix the edit Incase anyone else has this same question. Thanks for the input!
---
ya need the concentrated fire perk to blow off limbs
---
I think you may be right that it's possible to blow off limbs, now that I think of it. I've seen more than a few Assaultrons and ghouls crawling around after having both legs crippled. However, I've yet to see an individual limb severed.
---
I'm not sure, but I think you can do the opposite at least. I made heavy leather, modded it and somehow it had the same resists as normal leather armor. I have some Assassin armor pieces one arm is heavy one isn't, so the damage resists are different unfortunately. It would be good if you could mod them to become heavy. But I guess I just have to farm to try and get all of the right pieces of the same set. Total RNG lottery. Getting the armor type, with the legendary effects, and in the heavy version.
---
Yeah I have that one it just never actually severs limbs like it did in Fallout 4, but I think I might have seen it happen in some PC gameplay so it could be a downgrade issue
---
I am level 71 in full heavy BoS combat armour, troubleshooter gauntlet.
---
I cannot do it. So much lasers.

"You cant fight in here this is the war room!"

I think I’ve got one, thinking it was for road leathers. 
---
no. mods don't work that way in this game. 
---
I have actually seen that with the robots too where I took a protections arm off, so it's even more confusing as to why I cant seem to replicate it with scorched or ghouls
---
I will take you up on that offer sir!
---
If you figure out how to get them, let me know. Heavy Leather is at the vendors and Heavy Robot seems to be on the same Levelled list as the Marine armor that drops at the 7 set plan spawn locations in Cranberry Bog.
---
the game is all in all pretty fun, but has drawbacks. but its extremely buggy, there are alot of exploits that people take advantage of which is causing server instability. the game is a major grind, and it takes a long time before you are able to "master" it. the pvp system is flawed, and there are from time to time, griefers. they will try to jump in front of you when you are killing an enemy. if your bullet/weapon strikes them, then they can turn and kill you and when they kill you, you will lose money (caps). the amount of money you lose will be equal to your level. also players will try other strategies to bait you into pvp, so they can kill you in one hit and take your caps. the mechanics of the FPS system are horrible, and the graphics are dated. all in all its fun if you like fallout, but its a very mediocre game, especially once you've explored the entire map. and all the quests literally suck and bore me to tears. if you like a sandbox game where you are killing enemies, farming for awesome weapons and armor, building bases, and ocassionally pvp'ing, then yes this game is for you. its just not a very good game when you get down to it. i rated it a 4 of 10 on metacritic and at times even i feel it was too generous. but one thing i will  say, i'm still playing it 3 months after release, so i do like the game to some degree, and i hope like hell that they make it better. because right now its kinda shitty in all honesty, but still somewhat redeeming enough to play. kind of reminds me of dying light more than fallout.

I was farming workshops in the ash heap when I got the actual wall building plan.

call that a miniton

?? Amazon cloud servers have nothing to do with your game crashing unless your remoting into a cloud server and playing fo76 from that. 
---
It’s a current glitch where they attack you and they die from attacking you. The server then thinks you killed them and gives you a bounty and they claim it. It’s a huge problem that’s going on
---
Ad Victoriam!
---
sounds like you dropped it and someone else picked it up. 
---
Bloodied weapon and Adrenal Reaction Mutation. For perks: Nerd Rage, Bloody Mess, Adrenaline, Revenant, and all 9 Points into the weapon type of your choice for 60% damage. Gear is mostly Unyielding for this build, though Life Saving can be good as well.
---
Check back in half hour, I’ll of posted a linked that will help you check if you’ve learned all the mods for something. 
---
Are you sure the arm is actually missing, though, or is the armor just stripped off it? I actually never pay much attention.
---
Will do! 
---
Was this in vats mode coz Ive noticed that if you hit vats then spam shoot theres a delay and it says 0% then turns to say 95% bit it still continues to do 0 dmg i have to leave vats then hit vats again and wait for it to register could be the same thing 
---
No this one actually had it come off, and it was awesome! But it only seems to happen to robots for some reason
---
Here's a [Legendary list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L5c8ZKCCf4OaNglGc516dl9AFxYWnMUDuhQbHjrlQkQ/htmlview#)

He means for the silo itself, not the nuke zone after.
---
i nuked whitesprings last night, PSN was "Failoutgayyy" or something similar
---
don't know if it was me or not, but i got some sweet screenshots to the right of where you were in your video lol. awesome stuff

Why is everything in the atom shop so expensive? It's insane. The Four-Poster Bed is 700 credits. It's literally a bed. Small camp items should cost like 50-200 credits max.
---
happy cake day, redditor
---
I havent seen any dismembered limbs.. But one detail you might have missed would be:
---
Cripple a deathclaws legs. Like really cripple em. Their bone breaks and sticks out thru their skin.
---
Pretty grim.
---
It was a joke on how unstable the servers are.
---
When you log in on your character, you can open Menu to see Daily and Weekly Challenges that reward Atoms.
---
Perfectly balanced...
---
Rose sounds a lot like Sally from mothership zeta
---
Sadly wouldn't work because with the Chemist Perk if you have plenty of Purified Water you could essentially gain Infinite Stimpacks. 
---
I'm no expert, but fist weapons with Iron Fist are amazing in my opinion. The Mole Minor Gauntlet, Deathclaw Gauntlet, and Powerfist are my go-to weapons. However, they are all incompatible with power armor. I'd suggest a shotgun and corresponding perks as well.
---
I don't care that there are low level players in the area, nor do I care if they want to tag mobs for exp. I *do* care when they see a high level player nearby and just carelessly run around aggroing things because they think it's the other persons job to kill it for them. We can kill things together, but if you aggro the entire golf club I'm leaving you to die. 
---
If things are so strong that you don't have any chance in killing them without help, you probably *shouldn't* be in that area. But if you're going to take that risk anyway, don't make it harder on the people already there. 
---
My love for my Gatt is from the fact is sounds cool, can have a big assed sharp but tacked on the front and my ammo weighs in at zero. I've used gattling since I picked up my first one.
---
First a gattling, then a +30% animals, then a +30% robots then a +30% animal explosive and now a TSE. My ammo, when I have 5k rounds is zero. Soooooo happy.
---
Just wish my 2SE had the accuracy of my 1SE. Sniping is much harder with the 2SE.
---
Oh yeah I remember that from Fallout 4! Pretty neat detail
---
You cannot remove mods, only overwrite them.
---
Mod to the harpoon gun that tethers it to a location for a period of time.
---
... because that's how incentives work 
---
Hotter rod paint job is brought in the atomic shop 1400 atoms
---
It's called a shotgun and the enforcer perk
---
Issue: Group looting
---
Console: Ps4
---
Can't even enjoy the few nuke zones I do go to, even if I kill/help take down X enemys. People somehow take the loot from the stuff I kill, my loot pool.
---
I need one or two
---
Yes I was referring to the reactor room, I started with a sneak, crit, sniper. So radiation resist was a must for me as I try not to use PA.
---
I wish they allowed more space for photos.  Or even synced the pictures to your Bethesda account for safe keeping (lol).
---
50 fills up too fast and I end up deleting memories to complete a challenge.  If they are pushing poses and photo frames on the atom store, then at least accommodate for more pics to make these things worth buying.
---
Ah, Was about to return my PipBoy to Vault Tec..  thanks
---
There is no point adding further end game while:
---
Duping remains rampant
---
Massive imbalance exists where a player can run a super powerful builds inn hours (power lvld + duped top gear).
---
Any content will be trivialised and rare drops will become common.
---
Why do ppl like you bitch and moan about how others play a damn video game? If ppl want to collect PA early then FUCK IT.. Is it taking food from your mouth or money from your pockets ? Just stfu and let ppl play how they want.. Godamn
---
Where do you check your challenges?
---
Maybe all the bits spawned with 0 durability, and once you got in they did the old explody thing that PA does when it breaks.
---
Id prefer they employ developers who can fix the exploits first.
---
I did it at level 45 with excavator armour using melee. Took me 3 attempts because I went in blind and figured it all out as I went through. The hardest part was the assaultrons lasers  and cloaks but i just ran around them swinging made it through. I finally got to the launch pad and inserted my keycard and entered the code thought to my self this is going to be awesome my first nuke then I went to fast travel near white spring to watch it go down and my game crashed so I missed everything lol.
---
I do white Knight with lucky break. Works great. 
---
No joke tho. A critical on each wing should bring it down. Forces all pellets on the wing and all have a great chance to cripple. 
---
Most queen battles I've had end with the queen fully crippled just standing there 
---
Epic.
---
They were gonna give us more space for photos but then they used it for an additional 200lbs of junk instead. xD
---
First in Whitespring I was level 21. I was solo and I began kill ghouls, trying to kill the ghoul-fisti (ghoulfers in english). They were from level 9 to level 16, great. Meanwhile a 224 level player joined the area next to me and suddenly appeared gangrenous ghouls (level 62). One-shot and half-life gone. I died in 10 sec.   
---
Luckily this player helped me to gain some exp. later, but ghoulfers didn't spawn again and I totalized 7/9 GG  
---
You can still get strength cards you have to first choose a different special because that one is maxed and then swap to the strength cards, the second part is that you likely are choosing to level up perception and then choosing a card from other stat, there are no bugs in any of those problems
---
"go away, bleeder!"
---
Shop at SUPER DUPER MART!
---
Any Super Mute who taunts me gets his kneecaps shot out and obliterated at point blank.
---
Could you teach me how to lock the door's C.A.M.P.? 
---
That's how it should be done
---
I feel like that's what they're doing when you get multiples. So you can have a little bit of everything if you feel like it that day, instead of 2 big cards in one category. It makes sense to me that that is exactly why they provide multiples that can be stacked to other level variations of the same card. 
---
Until level 50 you first pick what SPECIAL stat to put a point in and then which perk to add a point too. SPECIAL stats only allow you to allocate 15 points into them, you can buff these further with equipment and aid items, but the numbers you see in your SPECIAL menu have no bearing on how many perks you can equip. Only the number seen in the perk menu dictates how many perk cards you can allocate to each SPECIAL stat.
---
So if you want a STR perk card you first pick a SPECIAL stat to level, and then you can scroll to the other stat perk cards. I don't remember exactly what button it is, but if you look at the bottom of the screen there is a small menu that will tell you how to navigate through to the other SPECIAL stat perk cards.
---
And who are you to say what price should feel right? Do you know what kind of people do that?
---
Commies
---
Or the syringer, that gun is essentially useless in its current state, would be nice to give it some actual application to the game.
---
This game is like that fucked up amusement park in pinocchio. Everything is complete anarchy and going to shit but the kids inside seem to be enjoying themselves.
---
It's (the game) a work in progress. Eventually everything will balance itself out. With that being said TSE doesnt affect anyone else whn you play lone wanderer and use it solely for PVE. I'm not huge on pvp. So the TSE being overpowered thing is a rather moot point depending on how you use it. Of course when you have everyone and their brother griefing because they are bored, that changes things. With that being said. being a rad rage build, it isnt hard to knock out 20 hp. Be it explosive or regular damage. In my experience the only people whining about the mechanic are those that dont have the tse weapons. Thats like saying that a 10k deathclaw rad rage build isnt op. These are end game items for end game  builds. They do exactly what they are meant to do. 
---
Yh its annoying having all matching pieces exept for one arm piece. Oh well i gotta go hunting for it then. also you ever found any heavy armour plans i only seem to find the light version.
---
fuck that yo. Bethesda sold me a 10 dollar game for 60 bucks. they owe me 50 dollars worth of free DLC content. 
---
Yeah I got that. Regardless, server stability has nothing to do with a gun that crashes your game. And tbh, the amazon cloud servers are typically quite good. Lots of big time game companies use them as extra hosting servers at launch of their titles.
---
except your own explosives lol
---
I don’t even have a door on my camp. I like the idea that other players can come in and sleep and cook and stuff 
---
So part of your gameplay routine needs to be a focus on junk resource gathering. You can have a junk extractor at your camp if you build it near ajunk pile. That will let you pick up some whenever you're at your CAMP. There are also a bunch of workshops around the map with junk piles. You can claim more than one at a time and fast travel to them for free. It's also worth noting that the perk Power Patcher in Intelligence reduces the cost of PA repairs considerably, just like White Knight in Agility does for regular armor.
---
I always assumed the vendor decorations told you the faction. That’s why the Sutton station has raider decorations and Morgantown and Charleston have the responder signs outside. Are the other factions not similar?
---
How have you only got 3 subs and over 2000 views?!?!
---
What, you don't like explosive vents?
---
I fast travelled to my camp because I saw someone there on the map. I got there and he was in my portable toilet. He said to me, 
---
"Hey bro can you shut the door for me thanks dude."
---
Then we had a conversation  and he gave me heaps of Razorgrain.
---
Just remove them?
---
Or Raider Power Armor
---
Like the red medium sized containers? Feel like I see them everywhere in the ash heap. What're you using them for?
---
Portable fuel tanks are used for duping
---
Dont see how that's the game's fault, since it's one of the major features.
---
Ok so I didn't understand the card-system correctly, I thought you'd get a SPECIAL-Point for the card that you choose.
---
Thanks for the answer.
---
I've had them land on the ground when I was in treetop, and it's pretty congested there. I don't think there is any rhyme or reason. I also love how I can be attacked, through walls sometimes, even when it still says Hidden. Stop yelling at me you cheating flying turd.
---
FOR FUCK SAKE
---
I literally just bought the vault Tec paint with my atoms. 
---
#WHYYYYYYY?
---
Could I get updated link?
---
Just because you're not big on PvP doesn't mean others aren't. And the proliferation of TSE weapons has killed any chance of that being balanced at the moment. I have a TSE weapon on 3 of my 4 characters simply because I feel that I need one to stand any chance against another player on the current meta. TSE also renders melee builds obsolete. In PvP or PvE. On anything but SBQ, I can't reach a target on my melee character before a TSE weapon can kill it. That's not balanced by any means. Nor will it balance itself out in time.
---
Doesn't the explosive bait thing from Rose's quest also make the Scorchbeast land? I haven't tried it though.
---
Go into build mode. Look at the door. Craft lock. Close door. hth
---
In build mode change to the move items section and itll prompt you to lock whats highlighted. Doors and collectors can be locked
---
Perhaps but..... just the tip!
---
Once I was just playing and I saw over five people (they were all like 100-200) were at my base once I got there three more people went there I have pictures too it was so random and fun I don’t even know how all those people found my base since I’m at the devils spine or backbone it was really fun I really love this game 
---
Magnificent!
---
Maybe going for the challenge? I snapped a naughty nurse pic for mine.
---
I haven't moved my CAMP for a few weeks now, and I've had it set up in the mountains of the Savage Divide. I love the spot I picked out, great view of the Whitesprings area, a nice small lake, a camp nearby, and plenty of peace and quiet. Favorite biome is definitely the Mire though, it's just so cool and eerie.
---
handmade has the best recoil control in the game, and a tse handmade can do 200+ damage even without perks. fully  modded tse handmade has an 85 round clip, excellent recoil control and range. best gun in the game hands down
---
I came across him the other day! He gave me some plans and helped me quest for a little while, I'm glad he finally got some attention on Reddit 
---
Cheers to you, too.
---
Wow... I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and say English isn't your first language. Your sentence structure needs some work and your spelling is... well, let's just say good try!
---
Love it! Here's my favorite: [https://i.imgur.com/54DwbNK.png](https://i.imgur.com/54DwbNK.png) 
---
found it -- was such a low level one I felt bad for it.
---
That list says to me "I don't like PvP so this wil make it so people wont PvP."
---
Oooh that would be so cool id become a scorchbeast hunter and not have to run away in terror from its annoying sonic spam 
---
I solod the nuke tonight just to grief my friend for not being on lately. I snuck into his game, didn't invite him to team, went and solod the nuke, and dropped that fucker squade on his base. Messaged him on facebook right before I hit launch "Yo, merry christmas". If you think its hard now, you shoukd have been here when there were about 3 times as many turrets and no TSE's. 
---
I have unlocked doors, because I like the way they look.
---
People are free to come in, pick some crops, take eater, jam out, nap, etc... just shut the door behind you. I don’t know why, but that’s the one thing that bugs me. This may be post apocalyptic times, but my camp isn’t a barn. 😂
---
Atom shop stuff you can't..
---
The patch a few days ago was server side only. I get the same hiccups as before (PC, High settings, central-east Europe). I'd say you were lucky and connected to a nearby, low player count, non-duper server.
---
No offense, but what? You can easily play through this game without ever touching legendaries. Crafted weapons are totally viable throughout the entire game, even during SBQ. It's intended that you have at least 8+ members for that reason. Sure with meta legendaries and builds you can two man the queen, but that should be the case for all the time and effort it takes to farm for those perfect legendaries. 
---
If you need TSE weapons to feel strong you might need to tweak your build.
---
Battered clipboards - check Camp Maclintock, and  office buildings, military and government sites. 
---
As much as I have to admit that your dresses do fantastic things for my legs I can never seem to find shoes to match.
---
I thought it was only available to folks with pick lock three :/ 
---
Ritual bindings and all
---
I farm Charleston Landfill for water all the time. One industrial already in place, and there's room to tweak in a second. When you're done, make sure to not only scrap your new purifier, scrap the existing one. ALSO, you can scrap other material in the landfill using the build menu - wander around! Toilets, ovens, bathubs, chairs, some steel frames ...
---
That's based on your personal preference/ play style and experiences. As far as melee? That's why sentinel armor exists and damage mitigation perks. If I deal 100% of my damage to you and you mitigate 95% I'm not killing you anytime soon. Or cavalier for that matter. In case you want to aggro and Sprint to your opponent which is exactly what melee does. The game provides methods for balancing you just have to invest time and effort into the game to get it. Exactly like every single other well made massively online multiplayer based rpg
---
I think I have a spare nuka grenade plan, I'm on PC.

They also crashed my game as I was about to nail a 3\* legendary glowing death claw
---
That’s what I need them for 😬 Anyone know some locations beside sugar grove. Hornwright. Wv lumber. Radio array 
---
Have, sorry. I suppose it was a little on the vague side.
---
on PS4. actually about to take photos of the base right now
---
Happens a lot with ghouls when I grenade them(and sometimes with super mutants) and I play with PS4.
---
No problem, I think they have a reference to something like this in the tips that come up during loading screens, but not sure how clearly they actually put it. There is also a semi-vague help menu in-game with some details.
---
It can be difficult to find out all the little mechanics about this game. Most of the people who have knowledge about these things had to find out the hard-way themselves. 
---
1. hit lvl 50
---
2. get x01
---
3. get tesla rifle
---
4. solo that sit
---
5. hop server
---
6. profit
---
I ran away from them for a while, or exited PA, put on my stealth and escape artist perk and sneaked away. Now I can kill 2+ level 80s. Just need to use one or two stimpacks, tank them with T-51b PA, and whack them a few times with a super sledge or axe when they land. But making some of those baits is something I plan to do to try it out to maybe make it a little easier and less costly on the PA repairs and stimpacks.
---
I dont know if it helps, but its most likely that the entire server died. So even if there was an optiom to join previous server, it wouldnt exist any more. We all feel your pain. I too have been there, and it sucks molerat ass.
---
There is a perk which makes it cheaper to repair and it degrades slower. I only need to repair my power armor once a week or ever ly 2 days if I spend more than 9 hours plying each day on my days off.
---
Lol Good luck fixing it. I swiped all your data and plans while I was in there. You philistines would just shoot yourselves in the ass anyway.
---
In an intense situation I end up spamming the "=" key to use stimpaks but almost always end up dying because I am also reloading or doing something else that prevents me from healing. I know Fallout wasn't know for it's gun play but since it is now an online game with PvP, maybe Bethesda can make it less frustrating. 
---
I know. That is good to know.
---
if you have all mutations what's the net loss of strength?
---
I just have twisted muscles right now (affects unarmed!) and am tempted to leave it. But getting talons too.... mmmmmmm.... Plus the good ones for speed and jump. Downside is risk of empath and egghead and the birdy ones... I know class freak will help but with all those - strengths together will it mess me up?
---
Just one star in power patcher reduces springs cost in HALF. a must have perk card...
---
Need another for the sbq? I'm game. Launched and killed my first the other day 
---
I think you will find that most of these guys will be the alt accounts of higher level players 
---
Now I feel worse thinking the ten peeps there probably got a DC too. Bummers all around. Was fun while it lasted though. 
---
And if I was a rifleman being sprinted at with a guy in cavalier armor I will lose every single time. Because if you close the distance, I can't fire my tse without running the risk of offing myself. It sounds like you need to take a look at your build. 
---
Pick up every clipboard you see (also tag Springs in your pip-boy). They are in office-like places (Sugar Grove, those tower-apartments in Ash Heap).
---
Pick the White Knight (A) perk at lvl 39. I have it and Power Patcher 3 (I) which stack very nicely. Before, my Excavator PA broke roughly every 5-6 scorchbeast or about 100 high level mobs. In addition, if you equip Fix it Good 3 (I), you can repair the PA to 200% which increases its resistances as well. I'm through dozens and dozens of SB and thousands of mobs and my PA is still above 100%.
---
I might try a reinstall then, see if that makes a difference
---
There's a place they spawn outside of the machines. On top of the west tech building is a seat overlooking the horizon with a piece of pie next to it
---
Damn that sucks
---
Do you have any blueprints at all ? 
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Sounds like something a synth would say...
---
Lvl 17? I must be a loner. I leveled two characters past lvl 70 with no exp buffs, only playing solo.
---
The vendor system really needs a huge rework in my opinion. I'd like to be able to sell every thing to them for starters... And when I buy something please put those caps in their cap stash...
---
That'd genuinely be an interesting mechanic though, having increased quality to food like in Wurm Online, where higher quality food replenishes more and maybe has bonus effects on top of what it has? I.E Ribeye Steak 3\* = Double food, healing and strength bonus.
---
Fixing up water purifiers to work more efficiently - I.E Packaged more efficiently so they weight less, or bringing back the ice cold mechanic from FO4.
---
I'm working on making a fort out of all the Ultracite Explosive Vent plans I've gotten from the queen, at least when she doesn't bug out or the game crashes or just boots me to menu or someone one shots me before I can loot it and then it disappears in 10 seconds...

No,  fabricators existed before the great war.  Frederick rivers, personal Journal 6/27/77 " It was at the benefit dinner for the engineering institute... babbling on about my work on fabrication algorithms" Frederick studied fabrication at an engineering institute. I need a source or quote as to where fabrication came from and how it works generally.

Please stop trying to discredit my question to bethesda.

Press "inspect" at your three star item.

🤦🏻‍♂️

You should see an option to inspect an item in your inventory. On PS4 that is to click R3 or the right stick. Then it shows you all of the effects.

What is a dreamer automaton?

What?, like its some sort of surprise?

Bethesda Launched a game not ready to be launched to cash in on Xmas sales, they then continue to ignore there paying customers and give them the mushroom treatment (keeping customers in the dark and feeding them shit). 
---
Between releasing patches that make the game worse and then empty and vague "into the vaults" being the only form off communication you seriously don't understand why that would get upvotes?
---
People who buy a product deserve a working product or a product that does what it says it does on the tin, customers don't care "how long it takes to code" or "It the holiday season" especially when Bethesda clearly don't care about keeping there word to there customers about better communication and quicker fixes.
---
And don't get me started on the amount of times they "thank us for our patience", not once have they asked for it but its seems to be taken for granted and were just expected to sit around wondering whats going on with the product and when its going to actually be working.
---
Duping hasn't been fixed, missing items cant be replaced, the one end game activity is 50/50 if you crash and can get back into the server after 30-40 mins of setting it up, then all the crap with different editions of the game...canvas bag, Nuka Cola Rum....is a disgrace tbh.
---
What i find weird is that people like yourself are happy with that though, yeah lets just praise Bethesda on a good launch and wait to lap up whatever excuses they throw out after the next patch fails to fix the duping hey! Fuck it lets give them a pass and just go out and pre order there next few titles as well hey....
---
Normal pump shotgun and ultracite PA and I was lvl 50 something only problem is laser turrets for me and cornel gustys (if I recall their names)
---
Wires man, wires. They don't store correctly when you rebuild your camp. 
---
FO76 madlibs!
---
My fist weapon user is my main, I love it. But I also have a pistol/1hm  and a rifle/2hm character (s)
---
Same ill give it a test when i finish work. i really thought there would be lot of cool little details in 76 i enjoy the little things in games like i miss being able to pick pocket ppl and leave a frag behind or they had a coller you could put on deathclaws in fallout 3 and they would follow u for a while as a companion i really love the game but they could have done so much more.
---
Yeah I made a similar post a few days back, same issue. One user suggested that they may be using serendipity. Seemed beyond that to me but it’s good to see more people noticing this too
---
Dwemer automaton, from Skyrim.
---
No all good, are you after any plans at the moment sooner we can keep an eye out for you?
---
I thought that would come in the main quest. The Free states talked about building some sort of trap for Scorchbeasts to force them to land  was really disappointed when it just got forgotten.
---
May I ask what you feel is based on my personal play style and experiences? The fact that I feel TSE weapons (really, Explosive weapons) have pretty much defined the game and warped/skewed it in a way that you either use them or you're not competitive? I'm pretty sure that would be universally agreed upon.
---
If I'm procing Sentinel as a melee build, I'm probably not closing the distance in order to damage you... so... I'm useless. And I'm pretty sure Sentinel and Cavalier are multiplicitive and not additive buffs. Meaning the first reduces by 15% of the total damage, then the second by 15% of the remaining 85%, and so forth. Not 75% total.
---
Also, I'm not sure I'd call FO76 "well made", personally. It's a great game and I love it. But it needs a lot of work, especially in PvP and balance, two things BGS is completely new to (so it's understandable).
---
How do I fix this?
---
Also if the sonic attack is energy damage, which I think it might be, there are some great ways to boost energy resist, with things like Leather armor, perks and mutations.
---

Love these story's, I never forget the first time I got to Whitespring Golfclub, not knowing there were that many Ghouls.. You see and fighting only one, then within seconds a whole family of them wankers are running towards you. Never ran that fast in my life, doing hardcore parcour the shake em off

I am trying to add true lore to fallout wikia. please stop trying to discredit my question, that you have done no research on and have no merit to answer. all research has been done already. if you actually read my post you'ed see I did **extensive research.** I am trying to fill out cannon lore for the fallout community amd for modders so we can create more content for the game.

Oh awesome, where did you find it?

i like how the reddit and imgur communities both hold the same opinion of each other.

Oh my bad lmao

lol yeah, I often ignore foods passive effects but depending on the effect it could be pretty cool..

I'd love new foods with new packaging to look at

Where do u get this costume at?

"unstoppables posters" is the name of the plan. I think the responders vendors carry them

So when you initially level up, you can put a point into a special stat, (the first screen that appears on level up). You can then choose a card from ANY special tree, which seems to be what you're doing. So next level up, choose the special you want then select a perk card in that tree to avoid any complications.
---
but what's the spoiler info you're not giving out?
---
If Bethesda want our patience they should earn it, show some pride in there product and hold there hands up to having dropped the ball (numerous times) and be open and transparent about how its being fixed and some sort of time line (no, sometime early 2019 is just more vague BS) imo.
---
I'm a huge Fallout fan and was a Bethesda fan, however the way they are handling (or not if you like) this is destroying the goodwill towards them. Bethesda need to raise there game!
---
Atom store should be pulled off line as well imo, selling addons for a broken mess without fixing it is disgraceful and shows there priority's, even if it is all coded into the game etc as some people say suggest its irrelevant. If someone sells me something that doesn't work but then continues to sell it and extra's for it whilst ignoring my issues it kinda rubs me up the wrong way tbh.
---
Dunno, ask KLGChaos.
---
I have always disliked the way you choose a stat point, and then a card, without having full overview of current cards and points. You're kind of locked to that screen, or have to back out etc. It's not great. But basically you choose a point for whatever stat, then you can hit R1 to choose a card from another stat if that's what you want to do. It could have been done better.

Assassins creed 76?
---
You stated you felt you had to get explosive weapons because you felt that it was the only way to compete with the meta. Which infers that 1: you like pvp, and participate or would like to often, and if you do then you purchased a weapon or carry it because you have lost in pvp several times due to tse weapons. 2: one can assume that you aren't running a gun build as your main otherwise you would use the tse as your main weapons since you obtained them for the above reason as stated by yourself. Which leaves melee if you're trying to be competitive, which you have also alluded to the build being obsolete to tse. Which you would know from again personal experience. To which you stated you had 3 characters at least. 
---
And sentinel, and cavalier stack. As does unyielding. Hence why melee Rad Rage can do 10k damage per hit. The effect would be useless on all of the perks otherwise. I use rad Rage and can confirm. 
---
As to your last statement you are nit picking. It's my opinion. The game is a diamond in the rough and has some great foundation. It just needs a lot of work. 
---
Yes, per.
---
I'm on PS4 too and I crash (with error code) at least once an hour.
---
Only relief I've gotten was right after they said they fixed duping. It was amazing only lasted a day or two.. reinstalled fo4 and how I can run that game perfectly supersampled and yet 76 runs like hot garage
---
suggestion heard: nerfing spawns at all nuke site locations
---
If you haven't found the plans give me a shout and I'll build it for free
---
On a side note, the effects can only appear in their own categories. First effect is Prefix, second Major, last Minor. For example, "bullets explode for area damage", can only appear as a Major, never a Prefix. [Here's](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L5c8ZKCCf4OaNglGc516dl9AFxYWnMUDuhQbHjrlQkQ/edit#gid=1760290048) a link to a spreadsheet compiling all effects.
---
I don't think fabrication is fleshed out. I think vaults have rudimentary fabricators for clothing which means the tech goes back at least a decade. 
---
It's highly possible that Frederick Rivers could've been part of the team that invented the tech considering how nimble he was with it but there is no good evidence of that being so. 
---
Alternately, it would be cool to be able to share or equip x-amount of cards to your stash, depending on your charisma score.  Sorta like sharing perks with your group.
---
I imagine with the ability to swap perks, having your stash tied to that would be problematic and potentially cause issues of items disappearing if the stash goes over weight.  If the stash itself was able to "equip" perks, that would probably be more stable.  
---
Alternately, they could just give us another weight limit increase.  I don't know the first thing about coding, so I don't know how difficult it is.  Personally I'm impressed that I can pick up a weapon, lose the server and it's still in my inventory when I reconnect.
---
Wow thank you this is really helpful

For a sub witch? Maybe ham on rye breed?

My girlfriend and I came across some level 50/60 Scorched at level 9. We killed them relatively easy, is that normal? It felt very strange haha

---
we should be capable of picking any lock, but have the perk cards just make it way easier to do so.
---
Even easier then, build a 3 1x1 foundations and put your workbenches and stash on them and then blueprint them. Now whenever you can’t find a stash or workbench out in the world you can just plop the camp down wherever you’ll like. It doesn’t cost much to move you’re camp so depending on where you are and if you’re using travel agent it will wind up cheaper than using the free travel to go to your camp and paying to fast travel back to where you were exploring. It would be cool to have double durability and unbreakable as legendary effects. 
---
Yes, these kind of things are awesome. I remember when I first got FO4 and started playing. Got to red rocket, teamed up with dogmeat. The sounds from his paws hitting the floor inside the red rocket were so realistic I was in awe. Called my wife to check it out too and she was amazed as well.
---
They are disabled on this sub. You will have to get an external link like imgur to link them.
---
Thank you. Now I have to search a friend. Damn. 
---
After you get a Prime Plan for each weapon from her, she stops dropping Prime Plans, and only drops two Plans of Ultracite PA and one Legendary item. Then it's even more pointless.
---
Can you just spam images in 1  location for others?
---
Near as I've been able to tell this is FUD. Do you have any proof that mod users are being banned or is it just Cheat Engine users?
---
The real long coat was the friendships me made along the way. :)
---
See that’s the issue - damage output needs a major rework. You do way more damage when in a group. But when your playing solo you do a fraction of what you would in a group.

Jesus man! Blur its face just in-case, are you trying to cause a mass breach event?
---
Ah ok, thanks!
---
Actually the opposite. This list says "I hate 1 shotting literally everyone in pvp and would like it to be balanced". On top of changing/removing these effects certain armor effects would have to be changed and resistances so people aren't demigods in PA.
---
This post could also be called "why you should always lock the door to your real house" and use the same picture.
---
Exact same thing happened to me
---
You say it's well made but needs work... which is pretty much what I said. So... thanks for agreeing? I'm not nit-picking. The game needs work and has a ways to go before it's even considered balanced. 
---
And my Party Boy Melee build WAS my main. Got to level 100 before duped TSEs flooded the market. I also have a level 82 Rifleman with a TSE Handmade, a level 53 Heavy Gunner with a TSE .50 Cal, and a level 35 with a quad explosive Double Barrel waiting for him. I'm no stranger to TSE weapons and I certainly use them as main weapons. My opinions stated her are from my personal experience, sure, but that doesn't make them wrong or completely subjective observations. So I'm not sure what point you're disagreeing with me on.
---
I'm not arguing that they stack or not. I'm saying the way they stack is how most things stack: they're multiplicitive bonuses, not additive. I'm also fully aware that Unyielding stacks as it's a +3 stat boost and not a percentage based buff. Again, I'm not sure what you're trying to disagree with me here for.
---
Yeah just a link, but you can click "Change" to make it a little tidier.
---
Didn't realise how it worked properly in till at least level 15-20 ish either.
---
Its one of the most simplest things in mmo's / rpg's (leveling up and selecting a skill if you like) but for some reason Bethesda hired someone that tried to re invent the wheel, sure it looks flashy but its crap in a practical sense.
---
I mean why the hell we opening packs to get perks anyways, why cant we see our SPECIAL points  at the same time as picking the new card, what was wrong with the wall chart type of perk planner from fo4?
---
If perk card packs ever make there way to the Atom store Bethesda have lost a customer for good, i know there's nothing to suggest that's the way there going, but seeing perk cards in packs does make me wonder if they were going to try and get in on the "Fifa" packs hype
---
Also say there's no buildable mouth harp.
---
Vault Tec's best and brightest 
---
Evidence from Fallout Bible 6 on the geck
---
"As for clothing, the GECK contained codes that allowed the Vault to create more varieties of jumpsuits (and weatherproof gear) from their dispensers, which they could do anyway before the GECK."
---
So vaults had fabricators though they called them either extruders or dispensers but it "sounds" like the same tech
---
IT'S FUN TO STAY AT THE...... CEEEEE.A.M.P
---
But did your mod auto scrap during debug?
---
Low levels at SBQ issue... getting swarmed by low levels getting in the way of actually killing SBQ using legit earned gear is annoying...
---
And have you exited the game since you scrapped everything and re logged in and it’s still 15% ? 
---
And NSNG
---
The ones I can think of right now are:
---
TV, tub, toilet, bunk bed, desk, tool chest, vases, scarecrows
---
I don't know if they're lumped in with other plans or if they're on their own.
---
Pretty sure I've met this guy
---
PSA: you can still go do this right now, I just did.
---
Also, wearing a monocle does not disqualify you, so I'm assuming glasses of other types are probably OK as well.
---
I have a door, but I never close it. I like to think that people notice my door is always open for them.. 
---
They could add a dupe item button... at least the servers would become more stable if they did.
---
I wouldn't even bother tbh. Every time people see my locked doors, they shoot them to see what's up there, then realize they got wanted to see my private aesthetic bedroom. So now I just keep my stuff accesible for passerby folk.
---
&gt;  
---
In that case, I stand corrected. I have heard people complain they couldn't take on certain enemies that are a higher level then them and complaining that "the game is too hard".
---
What’s with the search for the roaming vendor? Is there bonus loot for sale?
---
Is there a specific vendor that has the coat most frequently?
---
Awww. That are great words. But I am just longing for the clothes lol. :D
---
Sorry for you loss, amigo. 
---
I just assumed I haven't found it yet, since it turns out a number of plans and drops are locked away behind sloppy bugs (shocker, eh?).
---
&gt; My camp isn't a barn.
---
I wanted to agree, but I forgot my two story home is using Barn kit stuff, so I suppose it is a barn. D:
---
Shh don’t tell em
---
I was told that that if you have a flare gun and flares in your inventory and get downed then you have the option of shooting the a flare to call for help. Never confirmed myself. 
---
Good idea, but for clarification, anytime the flare gun is fired, you want it to make a marker on the map? I think that would be really chaotic. Low level players would be shooting flares for level 24 ghouls, or others would be shooting flares to mark 1 star legendaries. The map would be saturated with way points. I like the idea of a waypoint system but maybe make it for just your party. But we are supposed to be getting a chat system, I believe. If that's the case, shooting a flare could add something in the chat like "PlayerAbc has signaled for help" or "PlayerXyz has marked a point of interest with a flare." You could click the message in chat and it would show the location on the map, and any message the player added like "Need help", "Boss is back", or "I am selling stuff", etc
---
Kind of. The ghouls spawning from other players will be considered ennemies and shot at by the turrets.
---
Haha. well best of luck. i hope you find it nice and easy now \^\^
---
Also, you can tag the  items you want  so when you look at junk it highlights it so you know it contains a part you currently need / are looking for. 
---
Do a couple of junk runs only looting the stuff you tag and your stock of springs, screws etc will build up quicker than you think as you don't waste time looting every other piece of crap around that no good to you.
---
Hope to see you in the next ban wave.
---
That’s the catch with a low hp build
---
Here is a link to another post that has a spreadsheet for the legendaries.

---
White Knight does not affect Power Armor repairs.
---
Melee builds are part of the game, Scorchbeasts should land without being shot in the wings. The fact that 50% of the time they land pretty much straight away suggests its just a bug that probably should have been fixed by now (been happening since launch).
---
If they expect my melee toon to waste weight allocation on carrying round guns then they should make them weigh 0 tbh!
---
Would much prefer they add a dragon rend mod for PA sets though to knock the damn things outa the sky!
---
It lets clumsy players like me fall off of things with 80 percent less damage.
---
I saw you guys! Rocked SBQx2! Good job to all that were there!
---
What's so good about it?
---
Please reread above as I edited what I had said. 
---
There was a redditor. I can't remember his name but, he posted in fo76 a few weeks ago stating he was being shot with full sentinel while standing still by three players. He only took 29 damage total. They accused him of cheating because of it. And while I don't know I believe they stack additive. It needs work as in server stability, glitch exploits damage buffs to non tse weapons. Such as automatic (again) and most of all energy weapons. Tse by itself isn't broken. It's the perks and mutations and character builds that make the weapons broken.  A regular handmade tse without rad Rage deals 4-600 damage per hit. That isn't enough damage to take out even a glowing one one hit. 
---
I'm simply stating based on my opinion a level 159 player who has respecced his build 3 times, that I disagree as far as tse weapons go. 
---
If you didn't know there is a chance spawn vendor ( which as far as i know is the only place the hunters long coat spawns ) at little shack next to a pond right across the tracks from the Charleston train station (located just above the ash heap area) to trigger the chance spawn easiest way is to run down the tracks and across the red bridge then turn around and walk back. its not always a vendor that spawns. sometimes it can be random mobs like super mutants or mole rats ect ect. \*there are some cool ones like the pied piper eye bot ect) the vendor will be a protection with a cow thing and 2 eye bots. 
---
hope that helps
---
Yeah, buddy, can ya just piss off? Pretty sure paying real money for this stuff is somewhat illegal, if not against the ToS or something. Plus, kinda makes it obvious that you’re a duper. Nobody wants you here. This isn’t eBay. 
---
Nice. I think building around some existing objects/clutter is definitely the way to go right now. Your camp ends up looking too unlived in and clinical otherwise. 
---
There is one. Open map and go to social, click on your name and there's an option to leave server. It will automatically leave the server and put you in a new one, don't have to go through main menu.
---
Aw yeah! Me too! 
---
I dont care what your opinion is.
---
Imagine you went through all the trouble and ammo of launching a nuke solo just to get disconnected as soon as you enter the blast zone. Has happened to me several times. Really wish we had that rejoinnlast server option. 
---

Someone vendored a 3 star combat shotgun at Watoga. It's not 2 shot or explosive, the three legendary effects are, +250 damage resist while reloading, damaged increased after each consecutive hit on same target &amp; VATS critical do +50% damage. It only does 191 damage but I was thrilled to see it for sale. I was already a shotgun build. Do you think this is a duped gun?
---
I will say though that duping making these god roll weapons easily accessible to anyone is an absolute huge problem. I wonder would you still feel the same had they not been duped? And were considerably rarer like they were meant to be?
---
The golf club is a great farming area. Place a camp nearby. Get some turrets. Lead the ghouls to the camp and pick em off.
---
About the coat? Besides it opinionally looking really good, it’s also extremely rare. 
---
You can always screenshot them.
---
Saw you said farming out unwanted mutations I want to get more mutations myself can you farm and get rid of certain ones or you just farm mutations screw up then rad away start over. 
---
    This is all new to me right now I have mar. And chameleon. Would like tm to help melee build and any others that can boost my build.

Once Beth includes it in a future update, yeah.

The key here is tse a lot of people hate them during nuke zone cause nobody else gets to do anything so they jump in front.

This happened to me too i dont really do many nukes for this reason, there really needs to he an option to connect to the same server you left and your spot should be reserved in that server for 5 mins after a dc

Tbh he's right I hate crashing when I leave the world.
---
How much to just fit each leg with calibrated  shocks? And what is your PS4 handle? Really interested in this.  And what about the materials?
---
I stood on one while a nuke was launching.  Sadly, it only made my character slide off.
---
A TSE Deals 4-600 damage per hit. And what does a non-TSE Handmade do for the same build? 40-60 a hit? 10x the damage for TSE? Seems balanced to me. One-shotting a gloeing one with a semi-auto weapon with any old build should never be a thing anyway, so using it as a metric is just a bad benchmark.
---
Na I was doing the hotter rod camo but wouldn't work

Yeah, it was funny watching him cross the rope as well.  Its a bit of a drop.
---
i believe there are some outfits out there that are pretty similar. if you played fallout 4 and know of an outfit from there that was like it. odds are it should exist in 76 somewhere.  
---
Maybe you should tag their community liaison. Or maybe put this on the Bethesda forums. Orrr enter a support ticket! Then go ahead and take some lessons on spelling.
---
Did you go to check if the bits that fell off the nuke were lootable bits of junk or did they just vanish and not actually hit the ground?
---
did some more giveaway.

Never had this experience tbh. I take lower lvl players here all the time, as i was brought here, and the only problems we have are with the back door CAMP asshats
---
I (lvl 76) had a situation where i was helping lvl 18-24 players kill a legendary creature, didn't properly check my health, and wound up dying as i killed it for them. I respawned to find all 3 of them looking at my junk bag left behind. Then it disappeared. They all 3 claimed it wasn't them. So I killed them all a few times. 10/10 would teach lesson again. 
---

"Going by what some on reddit have said" the earth is flat and the moon landing was staged :P
---
Don't be a TSE cheeselord.
---
I believe it may be a reflex. I don't know about you but when I see a Deathclaw wandering around I tend to not look if there is a camp nearby but shoot first. I killed a friend of mine multiple times because he opened a door behind me while not being in my team and I was clearing out some scorched. And of course you shoot before opening the map. It sure sucks loosing your pet but you can't blame someone for killing a Deathclaw wandering the area. You can't check if there is a camp nearby all the time and most players are better safe than sorry. Sure, some do this on purpose but most people I know shoot some big creature because usually it kills you if you don't kill it. But that's just my opinion on it.

A non tse handmade base without perks does 128 dmg at level 45. A non unique Gauss does around to to 300 per hit. The game is meant to put in work and make complex builds. Not just mindlessly play without thinking and creating linear variations that puts everyone on even ground. That would make zero sense.  
---
And how not? For those who have put in the time and effort to streamline their builds to be efficient. Try telling me if you are in a Nuke zone with 20 to 30 that you wouldn't prefer to be able to one shot on each hit. It's the same reason low level players complain about white spring because the hordes are high level and can quickly kill a player wandering by themselves. 
---
If high level players can't continue to improve and become stronger and compete with others then there is no incentive to continue playing unless you're in it simply for exploring or building. 
---
I wanna see the silo doors open and the rocket launch, can anyone link me a vid

Its not a glitch as such just really bad mechanics.

In a trade you can see there inventory, and of course request an item to trade. Thing is if your busy setting a price for something or browsing there inventory (lol why is that even a thing) they can request what ever they want in the trade and if you accept thinking your trading a stim pack or whatever they get whatever else they have requested.
---
Haven't tested it myself after 150 hours played haven't really felt the need to resort to buying / trading anything, so I could be off with that but that's my understanding of it. People asked for videos of "stealing" items from another player but am yet to see one that confirms its anything else but bad game design.

Agree to disagree. I had a rando give me a TSE Combat Shotgun the other day. I was indeed able to take down a scorch beast in about three shots.  I immediately stashed it and haven't used it since. Now it takes me at least 15 shots to kill a SB but I don't feel hindered in any way. In fact the opposite. TSE felt like giving it away. Also with the right perks my shotgun usually last two LONG play sessions before I have to repair. Plenty of time for me to get the repair mats doing just basic exploring.
---
There's something about this in New Vegas, Dead Money, I think.

Big Mountain made or developed them for the Hotel Owner (Sinclair?) before the War, but I can't remember the details.

There's more info on the Wiki, including Terminal Entries though.

I was on that thread. The poster was incoherent and borderline illiterate, but clearly mentioned Cheat Engine before rolling back to repeating "it was just a texture mod." Still no evidence ever presented.

If I'd been banned for using a normal mod I'd have documented the fuck out of that shit and publicised the hell out of it. This "mods get you banned" horseshit is just that.

By my experience, after a nuke, high levels spawn are triggered at the very least for the same amount of time a nuked zone takes to run off the fallout, doubling basically the farming period, just less legendaries around. My first time there I went for the sword and I was greeted too by 62+ luminescents, it was ton of fun sneaking around them and stealthy acquire the sword :)

They can be hostile though which again is just another bug, like the other guy said, can't really blame people for shooting first and asking questions afterwards when they see a deathclaw.

Id suggest moving you base somewhere obscure and not in a place that gets a lot of foot fall at the moment to keep your pet safe.
---
Yep, that's correct!
---
Cheers 😁

I was vendoring in Flatwoods today and a lvl 7 was collecting water at the river.  We gave each other waves and I asked if he needed anything.  After a minute or so, he got his mic on and asked a few basic questions, so I gave him my advice.  He was asking about weapon mods, so I told him you learn them by breaking down weapons, and that if you find plans or recipes, you have to go into notes and read them to learn it.  He mentioned that he hated the iron sights on the pipe guns and I laughed because it was so true.  I asked what kind of weapon build he was doing, and he said commando stuff.  I just so happened to get a lvl 10 2-shot 10mm smg from some event the other day, and I figured I should save it for whenever player vendoring happens.  I grabbed it out of my stash at the red rocket, modded it out with a hardened receiver, hip-fire and armor-piercing mods and gave it to him.  It was 44 damage on my rifleman build, so that thing will probably make hamburger out of whatever is unlucky enough to get in his way.  He was over the moon.
---
Players go into the shack with the weapons bench to hide from creatures. Guns like the Gatling Plasma break very easily and must be repaired.
---
If the weapons bench is covered in low level players hiding from the fight I will absolutely go get the attention of every mirelurk king and scorched to shoot into the shack to clear a path for contributing players to repair their weapons.
---
Well - I was minding my own business when the DFA warning triggered, and it was a fair amount of time before the damn thing actually launched from my backyard. Chances are, if I'm on during another Alpha launch, I might be able to hoof it over there before the ICBM actually spawns and takes off.
---
Why should a deathclaw gauntlet do the same damage for me specced into perception as someone who put the time and effort into building a melee class. That makes zero sense. No mmo ever was made to function that way. If you want that you should play call of duty.
---
How did you find their base after they server hopped? 
---
This won’t delete or change anything?
---
awesome thanks for sharing, finally found a chainsaw last night after always wanting one
---
It be funny if you can sit on the porta potty and when someone opens the door your characters acts surprised, angry, or Frustrated that you busted in on them
---
They didn't seem to make it to the ground - it looked like a "booster stage" dropoff kind of effect, but the debris looked like the same fake bits that hit the floor when a Power Armor piece is destroyed in FO4.
---
No free rides eh
---
From further reading I think the armor mod to try would be Dense and Padded for their sonic attacks. And also somebody said with +50 poison resist they spray they use only tickles. Luckily I have a piece with +25 so I can test with that also. So this is something I will be working on now.
---
Ah thanks, sorry didn’t no what you meant. 
---
We all wanna recreate that scene at the end of Dr. Strangelove.
---
https://youtu.be/snTaSJk0n_Y
---
Yeah I was hoping for a Dr.Strangelove moment, but I guess not.
---
Yeah, it’s very frustrating. All I can think is that Bethesda left the game with nowhere near a big enough team to give it the level of support it would need, as they said they would be diverting resources back to Starfield etc when FO76 was released. I’m actually ok with this being a new area for them, but they well knew the state they were releasing this game in and should’ve come loaded for bear. Anything else is contempt for the customer. 
---
FO76 has already lost a lot of its momentum due to the leisurely updates, and occasional hotfix, while issues continue to stack up at their door. Honestly, at this point I think it’ll be free to play within a few months, as it’ll take at least that long to get on top of everything and they’ll need a way to cajole the players back who only had so much patience. 
---
Has MTF epsilon-11 arrived yet?
---
That seems like a nice suggestion. Or maybe “Lv. 21 Tamed Deathclaw” Just something to make it obvious. 
---
Amazing timing, I just commented about that!
---
I had my camp set up just beside overseers with a big Yao Guai pet. He was aggressive and attacked a level 8 and 5 after they shot at him.. after this he was hostile for me and has now disappeared :(
---
Would like some clarification from Beth about the micro mechanics for having pets 
---
Commented for later *Please Stand By*
---
and make sure to wear a tinfoil power armour helmet, in case bethesda reads your thoughts to find out you are using a mod
---
I have heard of a bug like this but I didn't know about being able to switch lobby but as far as I know it can be done by switching to the weapon as soon as it breaks then it will stay equipped even when broken and changing weapon normally stops you from being able to swap back without repairing it.
---
I didn't know the gun was loaded and I'm so so sorry my friend.
---
Why are you talking about builds? We're comparing a TSE weapon and a regular weapon. Build has nothing to do with it. You were the one saying it doesn't even one-shot a glowing one like that's some sort of complaint.
---
Bottom line: Explosive weapons and low-health builds are far-and-away better than anything else and are skewing and warping both the PvE and PvP meta to the point where nothing else can hope to compete. They need to be nerfed.
---
Shame, would be cool if the booster stage stuff dropped something as well. Maybe something that could be converted for a PA mod (jet pack booster anyone?) or something for the mini nukes gun perhaps!
---
Cool vid either way!
---
Had this happen to my sledge one time too.
---
Oh boy! What flavour?
---
You good sir, yes you! Why are you not employed by Bethesda?! 
---
I've played so much but have not found a way yet so I'm assuming this is the same with the bungalows out front of Whitesprings?
---
Yeah that ended up fixing it 
---
Classic!
---
Thanks you so much dude :)
---
If you plan from the start of the you can easily have an optimized build by 55-60.  Using Nukes and Dragons planner I was able to build my dps  build that completed at 56.  Personally though for first time characters just take what you want you can always make another or respec.
---
It looking like a normal excited first time whitespring,which i already like,but the final twist? Brilliant.
---
... I need that military tent in FO4.
---
Absolutely!, I need to watch the whole film again.
---
I guess fallout 76 or todd didn't want to suffer a country censorship of gore. 
---
   
---
The scattered antennae along the apalachia force the beasts to land for a while. I've only seen him last night at an event. I did not know what they were for let's hope that later they can be used without the event 
---
They could display a clock at the vendor saying "next delivery in xx:xx" instead of a straight countdown timer.
---
Nice you should do it then post it to r/fo76creations
---
The rumors about the trade stealing have disappeared. It seems like it might be a couple people misclicking on the trade screen or people just plain lying.  Seems to be a lot of people making things up to ruin the game for people trying to enjoy it. I have heard people saying things about weapons disappearing from their inv, but no real proof of it.
---
Almost the same exact thing happened to me.  I just scraped the turrets and went about my day.
---
Better to beg forgiveness than ask permission.
---
Epic
---
that location also has a full giddyup spawn, its great 
---
That looks badass where did you find that paint job I love it
---
Because it would be in the same place as it was on the other server? Unless you mean "how did they follow them to other servers," in which case you can just go to your recent players list and click "join game," at least on Xbox.
---
yes but the gist is i wanna add actual facts going into the chapters like perks not working with PA stuff like that
---
Yes, I've had the same problem on PS4 a few weeks ago.
---
Atom shop
---
You can also wear glasses and a wedding ring with your hat and it still counts.
---
It's a bug caused by a laggy server. The game will right itself sooner or later.
---
Also, Lucky Break combined with Weapon Artisan and Gunsmith may help that Flamer last a few seconds longer.
---
For real? Thanks for the heads up
---
Is it a timed item and how many atoms?
---
What platform are you playing on? Might be able to help you out by just giving you a serum or two.
---
Limited for 1400
---
I like that when there are a bunch of people with PA everyone doesn't look identical. That paint job  is not my thing, but it's nice some people like it and everyone gets to look different.
---
Just what i alwaya wanted
---
Turrets hardly work properly anyway. Less than half the time they actually fire at whatever’s right in front of them. You’re better off not having them at all and replacing them with an entire furnished room instead. 
---
This is what I saved them for.... guessed it would come..
---
Now that my petclaw defended my house twice against scorched,i could totally go john wick for him. 
---
How long till its gone
---
Make sure you let us know when you’ve done this, would be cool to watch 🖖
---
Ah ok I thought you could only join friends servers
---
Less than a day if am not wrong
---
Thanks for the response! Let me make sure I am being 100% clear.
---
On XBOX: (not sure on other systems - I am curios though)
---
Person A is standing next to Person B.
---
Person A requests trade, person A then presses the right thumb joystick two times and sees persons B complete inventory as if person B has accepted the trade request.  This is if person B ignores person A at this point and does NOT accept the trade.  From what I can tell Person A cannot do much at this point, they can click on request items but since Person B has not accepted, nothing happens.  And eventually it will close.  But it seems like a good starting point for the possibility of stealing something.
---
This does not seem right.  Not saying that this is involved with what happened to my kid, but I noticed that when attempting to do things to his character to discover what I could do.  It could very well be a bug.  
---
I haven't said that. The op mentioned " Every time I need to fix " so reducing the repair frequency is reducing the need for hunting for springs that often.
---
Which is the same exact thing that happens in litteraly any multiplayer game ever. People do research and flock to the builds and weapons that are the most effective. So you could take that same argument and have a problem in every game you ever played with other people. Just because you dont like a certain build doesnt mean it needs changed. 
---
Aww going to miss out on a nice paint scheme unless someone who has it could paint mine for me
---
Let me rephrase. Sorry. It has no effect on Power Armor at all.
---
Shopped things cannot be given
---
Okay, once again, I'm not saying this just because I don't like/use TSE weapons and have some sort of grudge. I'm saying this because they're over-powered. 
---
You know what happens in every good MMO when something is clearly over-powered compared to literally EVERY other option in the game? It gets nerfed. Sometimes, the other options receive buffs as well. But with a gap in damage this big? A nerf definitely needs to happen.
---
I could drop my chassis for someone to take and paint it then they drop it so I reclaim it which might work
---
If you are going to get all the plushes there is a Mr Fuzzy and a Candy Fan Mr Fuzzy (in Watoga High School I think)
---
Not that I'm aware of, no.
---
No! When an atom shop item is dropped it disappears! 
---
Hi! It's me, Passive Mode!
---
How do you activate them?
---
Not a big deal imo, but still i would love for weapons not to brake
---
Well, this and Blackbird, now I have none left... :-)
---
Damn... I was about to ask that until I read your spoiler.
---
Oh thats a shame hopefully it returns at some point
---
Is...is this a sarcastic post?
---
If not, turn on pacifist.
---
Brotherhood officer suit plan spawns at drop site c2. 
---
Yes that was the original idea indeed. You got a point there, that would be rather annoying. Don't know if it should only be for the party, whenever i play in a party it is with friends and we rarely split up and we're using voice chat. Unless there are a lot of people teaming up with randoms and don't use voice chat then it can be useful.
---
Maybe they can show a little message on screen like: player x discovered something and then the color of the dot of the player who discovered it changes to red and everyone can fast travel to him (maybe for free)? Just like they do whenever a player is wanted.
---
But if they will add a chat system in the future they can implement it like you said. Probably a bit easier then my way :D. 
---
Or they could be creative and add more perks that allow builds to be viable tanks, and provoking builds. or support. It sounds like you more or less have an issue with the lack of viable options. Tse weapons are almost a necessity based simply on the endgame boss. If they nerfed it. Then I could a reason to Nerf the explosive weapons. But with how the mechanics work for her at this time with her health scaling based on amount of players in event. The damage from tse is absolutely necessary. If you have ever failed to kill a queen because of this and actually think about it. Then I'm sure you would agree
---
Able and willing. I have a stash full of plans I propose we just drop and both learn what ever we can from each other.
---
in the event you just touch the switch 
---
Nope. It happened to me yesterday +100 player acting like a lvl 15
---
I get it. He is roleplaying the idiot. Plot twist.
---
I know, right? So counter intuitive it almost feels intentional. If I don’t already know that plan or recipe, why not make reading it automatic? Why would I not want to learn it?!
---

---
Idk the current system is pretty realistic, you know... radiation cleared within an hour or two. Not like nukes have a long term effect or anything 
---
Not at all.
---
Yeah I keep pacifist on in nuke zones for this reason. I run around with a minigun so it's easier to just spray everything that moves
---
Now I kinda feel bad but also not sure if it was a pet or not. It was an diseased savage deathclaw in Whitespring, wandering around, screaming at me yet didn't do anything besides running away. Name also showed red. He gave exp when I killed him, as well as loot. Was this a pet or just the occasional bug that monsters don't do anything?
---
Yup, my experience as well. I dislike that folks just spout off random garbage without proof because they saw some article that a "gaming site" posted that is just ripping off social media garbage.
---
Won’t someone think of the children!
---
If you fought the queen with passive mode off you're the piece of shit and deserve what you got
---
You on pc? I'll help
---
Ofc
---
https://discord.gg/6hA2tjk
---
Invite some friends as well, so we can grow. 
---
from my experience you can only blast their heads off and that only works if they die within that hit, done it to plenty of deathclaws and yao guais
---
Cranberry bog down near Watoga. But it’s always littered with tons of scortched and dragons. Those are the only 2 o have found. 
---
I play melee ln nuke areas
---
Nuke areas are so chaotic, I just keep pacifist mode on permanently now because of it. I only take it off when I want to kill some idiot who is wanted and is trolling people.
---
I went into my first nuke zone at lvl 17 in shoddy raider PA, was tagging enemies with my little pew pew pew hunting rifle and I accidentally hit a lvl 120. He proceeded to super sledge the living fuck out of me. Kept pacifist mode on since then.
---
For the scorched Earth event everyone is technically in pacifist mode, you cant hurt other players while fighting SBQ, and I think it applies to all coop events. But otherwise, you can just turn it on. Especially at nuked Whitesprings.
---
&gt; I'd love some passive perk slots. I really hate wasting points on non-combat perks.
---
Then don't, and accept that a good fighter is not a good lockpicker.
---
The goal of perk cards is to be able to experiment with them so they gave us swapping. We are not meant to swap all the time. I don't. If swapping costed caps, as any respec does in any game, people would understand. 
---
So only Power Patcher 3 with its 60% reduction made my PA break \~25 times slower? I'd think PP 3 makes PA break 2.5x slower. WK glitches on login and adds another 10x slowness while the game equips the PA.
---
I feel like players should be limited to launching one nuke at a time.  I don't know if it's the amount of players congregating in one area coupled with a bunch of enemies, or the nuke effect itself that creates server distress, but it's clearly pushing their hardware to the limit.  The other day there was a triple nuke on site prime and it caused all kinds of problems.  Today there was a site prime and a whitesprings and the server was clearly not happy.  I didn't get kicked, but there was a lot of "server not responding".  I think a few players got sick of the delay and left, which may have eased the burden to where the server stabilized.
---
I don't understand why three people will nuke the same place.  Bragging rights?  It's not like you get three queens popping up or extra legendaries.  If you want to max out on legendary farming, wait until the blast fades, launch another and so on.
---
The past couple days have been nuke launch overload.  I even saw a blast site way up north at the munitions factory.
---
Giving you a thumbs up just for the effort
---
Dunno bro... Still. If I got legit hit I'd be pretty pissed. If I knew it was melee I'd probably let it go but with everyone so close together you gotta turn pacifist on 
---
A guy shot me in the Prjme on accident, I killed him and stole all his junk. Got 675 scrap and regret nothing.
---
This seems like one of those few games where people want to actually welcome new players and give them a good experience. Mostly anyway.
---
I've failed a queen within the time limiy once, on my first try. There were 6 of us, all mid 40s. And it took us 45 minutes to kill her.
---
You don't NEED explosive weapons to kill the queen. People did just fine before everyone ran around with Explosive weapons or Bloodied builds with full unyielding.
---
Thank &lt;3 you but I am on Ps4. Much appreciated. 
---
If u did that you re an ssshole and a toxic player
---
Was literally about to ask about this. I got the instrument plans and just thought I was missing one 
---
In uranium fever, I sprint past the radrats but I will kill each and every moleman. They just arent worth the effort
---
I appreciate the work, and want to congrat this guy but...
---
Doesnt this simply kills all kind of inmersion?
---
I mean: once you find this, in RPG terms, it makes no sense keeping with any kind of mission. Just talk to that guy, he tells you he followed the overseer holotapes and itsdone, and you settle in his c. A.m.p forever... Game over.
---
I know others might have different opinions, but if I found this in my playthrough I would ignore it as if it never existed. 
---
Still as said: thatssome awesome work.
---
Just my opinion. 
---
If it is somehow effecting your PA then it is indeed a glitch. Not a glitch I have seen mentioned before either.
---
You do when her health scales and there are 12 plus people with regular weapons in the event. She is easier to kill the fewer players there are...get as many people as you can to join in your server. Use regular weapons and base classes. I garantee you won't succeed.
---
It's not real. 
---
Now, I know that if when scrapping junk, if you press the keys (Or controls) to fast you can accidently scrap your current item that you are wielding. I've also heard a unusual amount of people claiming their weapons/armor have gone missing.  I've been trying to recreate the whole missing item thing on a alt character of mine by many different means and have yet to figure it out. Will post a update if I do find out what's causing it, if anything is causing it.
---
Between class freak and and how I always playing in a party I was still getting over 25-28 strength regularly last night.  I grabbed them all because I have found it's easier to have them all and then try to get rid of the ones I really don't want more easily than to have none and pray I get 1 out of 19 that I want.
---
"Base classes" 😂😂😂
---
Would be cool. It'd be nice if it came with a sizable atom bonus as well 
---
Asshole? Sure. Wouldn't say toxic though. It's part of the game bud. 
---
Like u were just showing them your shiny new chainsaw
---
You can have pets? How?
---
PC, I can buy the serums I want, especially since prices have dropped drastically the last couple weeks, but I tend to try and play things like a lot of folks I think are playing, which is solo and farming their own stuff so I try to find the most efficient ways to do those things with that in mind.
---
I'm sorry what?? Where?
---
Ive had the game since Christmas and i thank you for enlightening me. Saved me 63 carry weight
---
Its a camp, and I found out by going there and trying.
---
Part of the game if is intentional dude
---
I would agree, also make it so Weapon Artisan buffs ranged weapons as well.  All the other over repair perks buff their respective items (armor and PA when over repaired get increase DR/ER) but having weapon artisan only buff melee weapons doesn't seem right.
---
Well, this post got quite the traction. Thanks everyone for the upvotes, and (mostly) nice comments. Be sure to say hi to .BEAN if you ever see him on your maps! Safe travels.
---
Yeah it's a lot easier with the Mr Handy because it benefits from Slugger and other melee perks as well.  I have had a ripper over 200, downside is that it doesn't "tick" as many times per second as the chainsaw and the damage is still affected by how laggy the server is sadly.
---
You are quite correct heh!
---
Buffs are not multiplicative like that anyway. Chances are more likely a change in play style or increased damage output is causing you to take less hits and therefore repair less often.
---
Gary? Gaaryyy?
---
Maybe. Maybe not. If it wasnt part of the game, it wouldn't be a feature IN the game.
---
There are responses to folks in here that have my build and the thread a bunch of us were talking in earlier this week about how to make them rock for more in depth answers and how to find tune it to make it good, but the simple answer to make any chainsaw instantly usable is "Repair it with Weapon Artisan 3 as the extra durability directly increases it's damage."
---
I do all the looting and workshop claims but after couple of times with the incident you get bored and annoyed. But I salute you for the power patcher. It took the fix cost down from 33 to 9 springs. Plus the slower break of the PA. that’s the way to go. Thanks mate. 
---
Max out animal friend

System? Gamertag?

event : its a trap
---
 I have seen the same tower scattered throughout Apalachia. 
---
As far as I know pets do not give xp or loot
---
So is it only an event?
---
Dang. Not me. Sry
---
They can't do this in its current form. As soon as you unequip those cards your stash would go over its limit. I agree that they should mirror each somehow but I think it would require a light rework of how weights currently work.

Damn. Do you know where I could tp to find a high level player?

Well...how about an I'm sorry, and if you're on PS4, some lovely chems to make up for it?
---
Thank you bunches!

This is probably a good place, just a little early for most.

W-what
---
I agree with you, but I get that it's hard... I have shot Grahm at least once with my sniper, sometimes you just see something moving and shoot. 
---
i'll gladly trade some fusion cells + recipes for it, i'll be off work later today round 2pm its 6am for me atm 
---
Sure, you farm mutations by gathering toxic goo or toxic water and then drinking them until you are close to death.  Wait a few seconds and see if you got a mutation, if not, use a decon shower (Emmet's Disposal or Blackwater Mines) with Starched Genes 2 equipped to remove all rads.  Wait a few seconds after you are done in the sprayer in case it's laggy, remove Starched Genes 2, drink more toxic goo/water.  When you get a mutation make sure you server hop as there is a limit to how many mutations you can get on a timer per server.  When you load into the new server do it all again.  Only takes me about an hour to get 18 mutations (19 total but herbivore and carnivore cannot be had together).  Once you have ALL the mutations take JUST ONE Radaway, after removing Starched Genes 2, and see what mutation it took away.  If it's one you wanted to keep, drink toxic water/goo to farm it again, server hop and try again.  If it's one you wanted to get rid of, take another radaway and see what disappears.  Wash and repeat as needed.  Stripping off the mutations can take a lot longer than farming them all up but if you only need to get rid of 3-4 and can live with the rest it's the easiest method I have found outside just buying the serums.
---
When you hover over a workshop location on the map, it will display who has claimed the workshop (if anyone) as well as the raw resources there. That said, I made the same mistake before and it sucks. I hope you can get back to having fun soon. 
---
Yh i like it would be good for new players 
---
No worries brother, I have learned a lot about many cool things from people sharing their triumphs and tests here and just want to add to it, not detract from it.
---
Ah ok
---
I have benches on the roof next to my fusion generator!  You can get up via lion head next time
---
Well.. let’s be honest. Cheetos and a sedentary lifestyle did more to make you overweight than missles
---
I messaged a guy who killed me. I didn't saw it was claimed I just saw the ressources I could get. Should have been more careful but damn it's annoying, I wasn't even close to the damn thing
---
Nice, I'll make sure to check it out!
---
Not really a correction, it was colonial *era* music.
---
Odd that it's a British tune, since the reference is the *the Pied Piper of Hamelin*.
---
I am not 100% sure it's double ticks but I am sure that it greatly increases the damage ticks yes.  It's much more noticeable on a really stable and fast loading server as a laggy server doesn't register all your normal ticks much less the extra ones.  Still not sure if this or the armor pen one is best for all around or SQB hunting and plan to test them more.
---
Lmao "Someone has better stuff then me, DUPER!"
---
Ha, I don't know.  I'm not into streaming or anything.  Just wanted to get feedback on my camp.  My husband is actually one of those subscribers, so we can say two.
---
But I’m speaking from a point of experience 
---
Yes!  And the safe usually has a decent weapon in it.  I didn't use it (scrapped to learn mod), but it had a 45 lever rifle yesterday.
---
Yep, yesterday I had 13 blue screen crashes in the course of 4 hours of gameplay. ALL of them were either in my stash or at a vendor. Bethesda Support tells me to update my graphics drivers......yea, that's right, I should update my graphics drivers on my PS4.  
---
I just think it's funny that I've had more blue screens from FO76 in one day than I have from every other PS4 game combined since the system came out.
---
Nice how you built a stage! Gonna copty that if I may ;) ;)
---
It's like a paradise of junk!
---
Interesting thing is my permanent base overlooks a silo door.  Guy streams the game while visiting my base and I didn't know, now everyone has their base there.  This is why kids can't have nice things.  Lesson learned.
---
It is one of the worst fallout games.
---
I’m like 113 and wear a hazmat because I get bonuses with low dr and strength, plus a bonus with ironclad. Power armor actually hinders my build and the HUD annoys he fuck out of me.
---
Hazmat suiter forever 
---
Mole people are great they’re like jawas from star wars 
---
Add TheMeiserVader 
---
In fact there is a trophy for killing 20 players. Don’t see why not take advantage of the situation. Besides, by now you know about the pacifist mode and be careful next time. 
---
:) just found them today at Camden park. But seriously, your base is amazing and if you don’t mind, I’d like to structure my base very similar to yours. 
---
Well I have a surprise for you. The 5k one is a 1* legendary
---
I picked them all up from events and random spawns. Can't remember the details. I've never seen them for sale. If you ever see me I can make you a set with any mod. A small amount of steel and adhesive would be appreciated but other than that no charge.
---
The Watoga station and BOS vendor was where I was able to buy the metal, brick, and barn wall sets. Might take some server jumping. 
---
Or their Brahmin. 
---
Maybe true. It still takes me 2-3 minutes to shoot down a never landing spam-screeching SB during which armor degradation is minimal. 
---
If armor degradation is the function of the armor's DR then my PA being repaired above 100% and incoming screeching damage is attributed to only 1 armor piece per hit, that could also look like a 25x reduction.
---
You can get a bunch of stuff from any of the workshop events. Defending, retaking, and capturing the workshop all usually give a camp plan.
---
That's why I find groups of multiple mid level people and stalk them to find out if they're duping or doing other suspicious behavior. If they are I kill them and move my camp and launch artillery and there bade
---
Ok awesome!
---
I’ve done my fair share and I usually just get stuff like Modern Couches and stuff along those lines.
---
if they all had different weapons i wouldnt think duper but 4 exploding shotguns has dupe all over it
---
I’ve had pretty good success wit a turret and spotlight combo. Seems to increase the chance of targeting nearby creatures (except molerats, who can apparently dodge bullets)...
---
Lol to bad 
---
But the difference between 2 shot and just an explosive shotgun is small. Is it not?
---
Be you: Be working on modifying it on a power armor station.
---
Be your friend: Steal the armour.
---
Both: Profit.
---
Just run in and out of the Nuke Zone a few times, you can wear your legendary armor and not take any rad damage instead of using a poop hazmat suit lol
---
"it just works"
---
It's not their personal stash they use, it's a world container. 
---
From what I understand they have force a slight server rollback so that they have the items they want to dupe in the container. Then by forcing the server to do a rollback, it will put a (duplicated) set of items in their inventory.
---
What’s your player info so I can have you banned for using mods 
---
That looks like it's way over budget. How the fuck...?
---
Not sure if you can, have you tried removing the card? 
---
But yes, ofc the animal will walk around your camp when you tame it.
---
Thanks, I am messing around with it also now.  The fact that you bring up the other persons inventory without them even accepting the trade (at least on the xbox) concerns me..  That seems like a nice jumping off point to something further.
---
Can you confirm on other platforms (other than xbox) that you CANNOT bring up another persons inventory when you try to initiate a trade, and they ignore it?
---
No idea but I'm finna chuck an orbital strike grenade at it and see what happens.
---
If they could just go ahead and ban everyone with like 500+ Nuka Colas and 2+ duplicates of the exact same weapon (level, effects, etc.), or at the very least remove them that'd be great, yeah. Ever since this bs made it into the game, it's broken not only server stability but gameplay as well...
---
I was amongst the 0,1% first of players to reach level 100 on the PS4 (according to trophies) but took a break when the duping started occuring and some morons started spreading it through youtube instead of ticketing it. The servers went from a tad on the slow side with occassional issues to non-stop crashing when they weren't freezing or dropping you to 5 fps (again, on console at least).
---
As you just said, returning and seeing literally everyone run around with explosive weapons oneshotting everything (and everyone) is just not fun. Unless something happens to these items, the game might unfortunately lose a lot of players, potentially myself included. I've looked forward to the prospects of Fallout PvP for years, and waited patiently through the broken balance and no-damage bugs the game launched with, but even the prospect of a game mode where people can kill on sight now that everyone is running around with this kind of weaponry doesn't seem all that appealing anymore. Rather than tense engaging moments, that'd likely just be about who manages to oneshot the other person first.
---
Seeing as their actual tools seemingly limit them from tracking anything such as duping, I'd say a simple approach would be to either remove everyone who has x amount of y which would be (near) impossible to obtain through other means, such as three exact duplicates of a top tier weapon. Then again, based on the communication they likely rarely really read forums or reddit, so I sadly have my doubts about the game balance ever being fixed. Personally, I think I have more legally obtained goodies with me than the majority of players, but if they deemed the best solution to address this issue was to remove the duping properly and clear every character inventory, I honestly wouldn't mind.
---
Commenting so I can remember to dL this when I get home
---
Whelp, time to move. They can just keep it all...
---
lol just because they have exploading shotguns doesnt make them dupers xD
---
I found the blaster, but I didn't know there was a mission. Where can I initiate the mission?
---
Out of curiosity, how much was your bounty. I don't have a friend to collect it, but if it isn't horrid, I can take the hit. 
---
I got my powered doors from Grahm I feel like I’ve seen him have metal walls as well. The keypads are a little buggy though
---
Put items on the ground, not on foundation. Move your camp. It is now doubled.
---
Do it again, and again. You can have 150+ rocket turrets in your camp. They don't work at first because of no power, but when you log in and out, they work without any power at all.
---
For me there is no reason why the server performance is so shit. 
---
That‘s what it is. Utter shit.
---
Waiting for such simple things as loot tables, when there are more than 2 players and 2 dead enemies, sometimes for minutes, most of the times to no avail, or your own characters inventory, stats, mutations and so on ist straight up unacceptable. From any perspective. In any way. Unacceptable.
---
Don‘t get me wrong, i really like the game, but these already solved problems drive me nuts.
---
Maybe Bethesda should upgrade their server infrastructure from raspberry pis to something more decent.
---
\[PC\] 1.0.3.17
---
some parts of the game are darker than others. 
---
how to fix that?

I don't really like the way this one looks. The white on them ruins them

Thanks for the downvote 👌
---
Oh hey you linked to my post! :)
---
Currently trying to get the Responder Fireman Uniform and I stumbled on your post while searching for more info. Good to see that Ive been doing the right event quests.
---
I can confirm now that getting any outfit is really rare. I ve done like 30 responder events and got nothing so far.
---
But in my post someone mentions that he did the quest "Thirst things first", which is not an event quest, over and over to get the Fireman outfit. So I guess normal quests can have the outfits as rewards aswell.
---
Oh my. I have 5 X01 ultracite and excavator pa. Unlike some walking around with 1k
---
Same here, I was getting tired of being in excavator though so I decided to get a full set of -20% weapon weight. For a total of -100% weight of the weapons reduced, now I can play outside PA again. I highly recommend this armor. Makes a fully modded combat rifle weigh like 2lb. 
---
I usually receive authentication errors like [2:1:0] and similar. 
---
didnt downvote sorry though
---
Dear God...
---
I didn't expect the actual answer. Thank you, kind Redditor.
---
all 100+ rolling 4 deep with exploding shotguns if i were a betting man id say dupe but on the off hand I'm wrong my bad 
---
Bounty 1800 caps. Probably.
---
Please keep us updated.
---
"We're gonna build a wall, and the Ghouls are gonna pay for it!"
---
Yes, you can
---
Welcome, it's the same thing where people were ending up with hundreds of crops, etc. 
---
Surprisingly the game doesn't crash with the rocket turrets set up in cranberry bog farming scorchbeasts.
---
Last week I was soloing my first silo, I get through everything for launch prep, swipe my nuke card, pull up to the keypad, enter the first 7 digits.... 
---
Disconnected. 
---
the same bug occurs on xb1, theres no fix for it yet, sadly
---
I had over 10k hours in World of Warcraft but that was 8 years of it being almost the only game I played or leaving it on in a major city while I played other games.  No way my Xbox will survive that kind of play time on a single game.
---
What's worse is the damned thing won't fight and die.  I've got a couple of mutants that will show up from time to time and the bear just runs and hides.  
---
Appreciated

The first nuke I launched, much joy.
---
Musical instruments are people magnets in FO76. Every single time I've come across a camp that has them, we will impromptu jam. Every person that comes across my camp will impromptu jam. I love it so much
---
Nah, it will count as one hit. Only a ten cap bounty. It goes up by 10 caps for each separate hit.
---
Started on guitar, played bass for a few years in a band, played drums for a spell...put anything in front of me and I'll give it a go!
---
Where do you get those wall plans at?I been looking for them everywhere to complete my modern house look with my dark wood floor (atom shop purchase)
---
Yes, it will only weigh 10 pounds.
---
420, only wiped out the top 2 layers.
---
Cheating is cheating.
---
Because this person is a selfish asswipe, trying to mow down all the spawns for themselves and fuck everyone else that it lags out.
---
Destroy them on sight, even just for personal pleasure...
---
It wasn’t too bad! 40 caps. But I don’t know if that factors in killing him afterwards. I would assume not, as he turned off pacifist mode and tried to kill me. The destruction of the base came from the Daisycutter, so it was more or less done in one shot. 
---
You don’t have to change servers, go away from the area and enemy will respawn at Poseidon in a few minutes. Happened to me at least twice 
---
Exploding shotguns are so rare in game, when 2 friends have them, yes they're duped.....
---
Hmm I think ill have to do some testing then. Ive been under the impression it allows damage because I keep getting Wanted while in pacifist mode.  Always when I accidentally hit someones workshop while killing mobs in the area. 
---
I would love a modern couch! I always got dumpster plan, bear proof trash can. It's like they are trying to send me a message
---
They're pretty rubbish anyway...
---
Clothing to have some kind of buffs so you wear approiate clothing, so like a bomber jacket gives you +10% explosive damage and -50% self explosive damage. Or a dress with 50% selling price and +3 luck. Maybe even more spesific buffs like Cultist robes let you get water and food from cannibal and 50% les disease chance. It would be really cool and make clothing choice more appropriate. 
---
wow, so nice to see that we have so good players is the game, i always help out as well if i see a low level having trouble :)
---
Do you know if the 2k reward is a better value?
---
They probably didn't anticipate people farming Whitesprings as much as they do when they were making the game. They were probably expecting most people to spend nukes on fissures. 
---
Have you fought cave crickets, they are OP.
---
It is indeed armor. Ghouls will generally take way more damage than a Super Mutant, for instance. Just like we have damage resistances we can stack up, so does the enemies. They mostly make sense too - heavy armor, bigger, a thick hide - generally take more damage than smaller enemies with no armor. There are of course exceptions to this. While I kill a lvl 62 Ghoul in one shot, Radrats at lvl 25 can take 4-5 shots or so.
---
For the most sense you can assume how well armored an enemy is by looking at them and using some common sense. So to answer your question, weapons don't do less damage against higher level enemies because they are higher levels, but simply because the higher level ones have more armor/health typically, which is a lot more obvious with certain enemy species than others.
---
Damn. I've accidentally hit turrets and generators when helping people defend their workshops. It's annoying to become wanted for stuff like that.
---
COUNTRY ROAAAAAAAAAAADS
---
/slooooooowly backs out of the room....
---
I put locks on the door figuring enemies couldn't open them when I AFK inside, boy I was wrong. I just usually leave all the doors open anyways. 
---
give the people what they want!

I believe the skill that reduces explosive weight reduces missile weight.

If you're on Xbone go to looking for group and find someone selling

Just look at the stars, bought a few in watoga and whitesprings station.

Go to the map, up in the top left of the screen will.be a button to go to the menu. One of the options is challenges.

Last time my base got removed I mini nuked the guys camp 10/10 will repeat my war crimes
---
Some people just want to see the world burn

Probably how that will go, yeah
---
They're not rare at all. Tse are rare. I get exsplosive guns all the time now
---
Yep, its almost like the immediate unpopularity of this game deterred all the negative people away from buying the game so we are left with a more enjoyable community full of people like you and my mysterious friend
---
I have friended quite a few really awesome people in this game, the community and players I've met have gone out of their way to help. But nearly everyone I come accross has been nice and helped especially higher levels.  So much fun running around in a team of 4 at times.
---
Not as rare as you think I got 2 of them fro. Doing the uranium fever event 
---
Right. Tamed kitties and beavers would be awesome. Imagine how much wood you would get with tamed beavers.
---
You right.  👍
---
Ran into that recently, after my husband and I had just finished off some enemies. He just runs right up behind me, "CONGRATULATIONS!" Made me jump.
---
I got a certificate stating I won a Corvega car.

In fairness my deathclaw was an asshat who even attacked my own team mates, but it was liberators that finally killed him. RIP SeeSick'emSteve
---
Or wasteland whisperer for Dclaws and Snally's
---
I agree. It's annoying as hell.
---
Working as intended ;)
---
OK thanks.  So the never ending need for finding higher level weapons is more just due to them doing more damage than doing full damage to higher level mobs.  And looking for ways to negate their armor would be helpful as well.
---
You gay?
---
Max animal friend or wasteland whisperer, pacifying has a small chance of taming. 
---
Sorry it happens to you, dude. Learn from it and turn on pacifist mode in nuke zone next time
---
I have farmed that thing over and over, never much but shit armour drops, maybe need to increase by luck stats ....

I’m fairly sure only lead and aluminium is worth bulking but I’m not sure

How naive can you get. It's a damn PvP game.

Beavers dont run, and they're flagged Red.
---
So they wont run away. No big deal. Rather that, than have my turrets target them while they do run.
---
Your whining could be just as nasal. ;)
---
Right. And who doesn't like cat pics.
---
I don't believe they're for sale anymore but I might be wrong
---
It just works!
---
I just saw someone with this on. Enclave on the shoulders and gray legs from the knees down.
---
Good lord, I wandered in there alone during a nuke yesterday, and the glowing bloated were never ending. I didn't think I was ever going to kill them all. Went back in alone during a non nuke, 68 char's, hordes of withered &amp; diseased, three legendaries and a wendigo. And the damned cowboy hat was gone again. I had to go back twice in a non nuke server to get it, but at least there was three of us the last time. 
---
Fake
---
It was in heavy until they changed it few patches ago. Not sure what was the logic...
---
On the flip side, on one of my routiine XP farms of smashing Watiga bots, one dropped a 3 star hammer, thats rare, usually  hunters wooden left legs.
---
The level of detail in this game is amazing!

Bummer.

People dont dupe guns to sell to npc vendors. Atleast think about what you are saying.

Nah, they stink.

I'm sure the TSE combat shotgun / lever action I bought from a few players are both products of duping.
---
Couldn't care less.
---
They make for very nice bounty hunting weapons.

 Clearly. You don't kill any one or try to wrong someone, you just miss a shot 😞
---
I met some guy RPing as Micheal Vick of all people. He kept asking me were the dog pound was I pointed him to fissure site prime never heard from him again
---
That's great that you found it. I'm am incredibly humbled you like my base,and your more than welcome to base if off mine, just invite me to a team and come have a look :) btw nice sale for the pipe pistol 👌🏻😂
---
They low power and legendary ones break so quick...

Pie flavour!

Hahaha, talk about stupid, this guy didn't even get out of pre school yet i believe :)
---
Hey, and new fun game, let's set it up so it plays itself, thats fun, oohh.... wait... :D
---
What are these mods? IIRC the super sledge can only be modded with heating coil
---
I tend to follow the same tactic against them and don't have too much issues. If I'm out in the open, they will continously spam those shockwaves.
---
First thing I do is find something with a roof. Tent and bus works. As soon as I go in, they seem to stop using the shockwave attack because they have no line of sight. Then they start doing the strafing runs dropping lines of poison attacks. This is generally easy to ignore.
---
I will poke out to shoot them but they will try to use the shockwaves when they see you. When under cover, they will also land a few times.
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one who is compelled to strip down to only my undies and a festive hat to play instruments.

The vender randomly dies. I had my brother keep him busy to prevent him from walking into the water. He lived until I got my coat at least (that's when I killed him myself) I'm not sure if the water kills him but it seems like it to me.

What were those small little bobbleheads on the side of the enterance to your base? 
---
Todd be like: you played for 76 hours? WELL YOU ARE CLEARLY COMMITED!!!

Next challege: 760000 hours then 76 months

I do have infinite stimpacks thanks to chemist and super duper without this

What is fake?
---
They were the ones from the atomic shop, "lawn gnomes" I believe they were called, 400 atoms
---
Haha i bet money that it does not go free to play
---
There is no need for a cooldown, as it only prevents you from accidentally shooting other players, it does not make you immune to PvP damage.
---
haha yeah sure leave ur doors open so the griefing lvl 200 can come in and 1 tap you XD
---
It should. But that's not the discussion here 😅
---
The quest that pops up the first time you discover Harper's Ferry, the one that has you investigate the town and the area north of it, leads to several dead Free States researchers in the swamp, one of whom has a Prototype Haz-Mat Suit which is level 1 and gives 1000 Rad resistance.  Very useful for early exploration.
---
Yeah they suck. I wanting a high int crafter with energy and PA. Realized it too late so now I’m trying to kinda convert into a rifleman. Still might carry a plasma Gatling later for shits and giggles. Helped with a scorchbeast earlier 
---
It got bonuses from a bunch of perks like shotgun and explosive etc. I think if I remember correctly. I had been holding onto one or two to maybe build to use it, but then they nerfed it into uselessness I guess.
---
Do you happen to know if you would have been killed if you had stayed inside the hotel? I haven't been keen on wanting to find out. 
---
If on Xbox just look at their profile and see when they got certain achievements. These tools didn’t start getting achievements for 76 until 5 days ago, they’re new.
---
Yeah, this is really annoying, have the exact same problem in my hunte's long coat :/
---
beth, please fix this...
---
Isn’t there a futurama episode where bender or fry asks each other about killing all humans like that?
---
The fact that a guy brought that much scrap into a fight is the real crime.
---
It's not for ultracite ,is it?  Then,cool but no.
---
I think their has to be. I ran some simple java code to iteratively do the recursive math more easily. On a handmade rifle doing 99 damage per shot with an 85 round drum mag the total scaling damage came up to over 90 million damage. I've unloaded a full clip without killing something before. And yes it was alone so damage wasnt reset.
---
Total = 9.524832701571918E7
---
Heres the code if anyone wants to double check it.
---
public class Main { 
---
    
---
    public static void main(String[] args) {
---
        double num = 99;
---
    	double tot = 0;
---
        tot = bar(tot, num);
---
        System.out.println("Total = "+tot);
---
                      
---
    }
---
    public static double bar(double tot, double num) {
---
            for(int i = 0; i&lt;85; i++){
---
                System.out.println("( "+i+" )");
---
                if(i!=0){
---
                    double temp = (num*0.15)+num;
---
                    tot = tot + temp;
---
                    num = temp;
---
                    System.out.println("Tot = "+tot);
---
                    System.out.println("Num = "+num);
---
                    
---
                }
---
                else{
---
                    tot+=99;
---
                }                    
---
            	
---
            }
---
            return tot;
---
        }
---
}
---
With maxed sneak perks, bunch of AGI with unyielding and a suppressor they won't see you coming however it is best with non-auto guns if you don't want to get spot
---
First off, go to the ash heap region... 
---
What I meant is that turning on pacifist mode does not give an actual advantage (it would if it affected incoming damage), it is just a convenience feature. That is why it is not a problem that you can toggle it anytime.
---
On consoles, yes (or so I heard). On PC, no. You gotta friend them and they have to accept before you can join. 
---
Just picked one up last night. I love explosions so probably gonna craft a buncha rounds and lay waste to some nuke zone stuff just for fun
---
lmao i spawned into the server with this before it had all those turrets and it was pretty handy while Whitesprings was nuked, in the early levels i’d post up in front of this and shoot things once let the turrets kill it and reap the 500xp
---
&gt; , but even the prospect of a game mode where people can kill on sight now that everyone is running around with this kind of weaponry doesn't seem all that appealing anymore. Rather than tense engaging moments, that'd likely just be about who manages to oneshot the other person first.
---
Sure that happens a lot but i've had tons of PVP with neither of us using TSE, sure it's dumb that even full Melee builds does more damage with a TSE Shotgun but some guys just like to smack things no matter what is more OP
---
And the nuke.
---
Ok thank you very much that was helpful.
---
I did that on the Concordia rocket in Borderlands TPS - it carried me quite far before I clipped through it and died.
---
Pc
---
Belly of the Beast was extremely painful with people 100+ walking around Wotoga.
---
It wasn't the scorched that were 25+ my level that caused me pain, it was the mother f*****g lvl 60 cricket spawns that snapped my sanity. really, Beth, you had to add crickets to the mix?
---
I was lvl 25 and 2 lvl 30 cave crickets same and destroyed my fucking camp. So irritating.
---
Xbox live. Joined game and went to sneak mode until they went back to it. Joining games of non-friends is dependent on how they have there profile set.
---
The dupe on moving camp bug is back.

---
You're fine inside.
---
My camp is right next to a travel point people use to find one of the buried treasure sites. I leave it all open and accessible and quite often see people pass through.   On many occasions I’ve traveled back when I see a lower level player there to see if they need any weapon or armor upgrades.  Wish more people used microphones so we could better communicate.  
---
So they do.  Well... There goes 37 levels of progress and farming weapon plans.
---
Put on wrecking ball, go to town with a .50 cal and have your friend collect the bounty.
---
If you play a lot and install as well deinstall many Games, you should rebuild the Database on a regular Basis, every Ps4 Player SHOULD know this.
---
Yep, and it sounded stupid even back then. In some games, having seamless, hidden servers are a good thing. For example, EVE Online. The entire game is a literal galaxy of 5,000+ known space systems and another 4,500+ wormhole systems which migrate (open and close connections to each other and known space). All this is backed up by a server cluster, military-grade monster, which can dynamically reinforce specific nodes, which allows the game to have fights where 3,000+ players are in the same system shooting at each other, or Jita (main trade hub system chosen by players themselves) routinely having 1,800-2,400 players in it doing business. But you can't access individual servers, because it's not needed, server-hopping in EVE isn't a thing.
---
So Bethesda went with EVE-like user server access, without bothering to implement the proper backbone for it. 
---
Not with perks. Mine weigh 2.5 pounds each.
---
The one from the atom shop? Red one?
---
It's under lights.
---
I'm sorry you're getting downvoted so much... I'm sure most people here read this comment as childish, immature and probably slightly homophobic when there's a chance you were just looking for like-minded people to play the game with. Good luck to you, my friend!
---
Ahhh I understand the mechanics but I swear I had seen someone mention a cool down timer during BETA. must be wrong.
---
Nice that it's not.
---
I will say this, people get very cranky when you kill a bounty.
---
Yesterday some level 9 was swearing up a storm at me saying I stole all his shit because I capped a wanted player, who I assume was wanted for attacking the level 9.
---
What "shit" I stole I still don't know... The 5 cap bounty? 
---
We were commenting to one another how engaging, gathering intel, and ambushing these idiots gave the game another layer of fun. It was different knowing your enemy wasn’t just a mindless AI. 
---
When I come back home I'll give you a few location where you can farm Yao guai I have 250 springs in stock thanks to that ;) 
---
corrigieron algunos errores pero el juego sigue siendo el mismo, estamos esperando el nuevo contenido. 
---
Any chance you could also list it's locations? Now I need these bears in my life
---
I'll hunt you some pictures tomorrow
---
Shotguns and grenade launchers are my two go to weapons.
---
I assumed any under armor would go... Under... Any costume like that nuka girl outfit
---
Is that not the case? 
---
Only choice is to go destroy a few bases until your bounty is like 500+ then someone will come for you.
---
No i bought the plan from a vendor
---
My yao gui did the same. Like wtf did that corn do boy? Had a friend kill it
---
What does your special look like, I’m looking to see what the entire downside is with class freak 75% off 
---
This is still happening. I had about 9 t-60 mods, including calibrated shocks I hadn't installed yet. I made some EC 2mm ammo and repaired some armor, and now they are all gone.. this is my first time getting really frustrated with this game. It took several hours to find those mods I lost.

Morse Code.  Implement a cool morse code system that people build in their CAMPS to communicate around the area.  It would only work if you are at your base and others have it too.  This would not be immersion breaking and still allow for some rudimentary texting.
---
Dupers make the game semi enjoyable. You honestly like farming whitesprings and getting 1 star legendary trash? The same piece of trapper, combat armour, marine armour over n over n over n over. Id rather spend the caps and buy the dupes and actually enjoy the game vs the endless legendary grind the rng makes it. People who complain about dupers are ones who get killed by the weapons, that's it.
---
I ll add you guys next time i log in or you can add me the_dirtyhippy (lvl27)
---
See, in general, I agree. All I'm asking for is a little effort when making a post. It's like a guy going a post on Tom's Hardware, saying "I have a problem with X", and then posting a day later "I found a fix." And? If you're going to post, post the damn fix also, so that the next person going through this doesn't have to go through it. It's not rocket surgery. Same here. I got 169 damage on chainsaw! And? Context! Build, active buffs, etc. Because one step in the other direction is literally a post saying "Chainsaw", and we're expected to do what with it?
---
What games have you played? Angry Birds? People like you are why games are released in this quality.
---
Lasers *do* have recoil. Just very very low.
---
But you could use a big ass laser (like a stalaser) to push a starship that had a big mirror on its back to relativistic speeds.
---
It depends on why you're launching the nuke, sbq  and we are great for legendaries but if you're looking to farm flux other places are better..
---
Not like the entire franchise was built around the long term effects of nuclear weapons only to trivialize it in half a dozen ways :(
---
Nothing super complicated to be honest.  I tend to warp to the train station, check the vendor.  Walk from the station up to the Super Duper Mart, checking the alley, cafe, and bog area with Vats.  Check the vendor.  Walk to the power armor and the crashed vertibird to fish out a power core, go to the medical center and hit top floor legendary spawn (which sometimes is a crown but is still pretty consistent).  From there I will either fat walk to the trainstation again to break down junk or I will warp up to Harpers.  Walk the long way to the vendor, checking the church on the hill near the turrets.  Check the vendor.  Duck out around the vendor to hit the chemistry bench and the last group of mob spawns.
---
That's pretty much it.  Some days I get lucky and have several spawns, some I hardly have any.
---
Honestly, keep the character. You can respec or make an alt. Either way, if they do a rework you are ready.
---
I try to help out lowbies any chance I get. We’ve been messaged multiple times asking for help or advice after showing disarming friendliness towards lower lvl ppl. Many areas become obsolete for high lvl players to frequent, but don’t consider our absence a lack of caring. Drop one a message, you may be surprised.
---
Should scale to the individual like it does in ESO and WoW.  Than it wouldn’t really matter where you were. 
---
Yeah! It really is. I pretend to be like the predator and hunt players
---
The problem is that you shouldn't have games be buggy at release. Red Dead Redemtion 2, God of War, Spiderman, they were also AAA games and were all relatively sound at release. This bugginess is on the fault of Bethesda who should of delayed this game a year or two. If your having fun, good, but there's a reason people say "Another mans trash is another mans treasure"
---
Yea honestly fuck these guys and the ones that will crouch in one of the rooms that spawn ghouls so that they can kill them before you even get to them. I fast traveled there. They spawned for me. Asshole. 
---
Are you sure it was a fireplace? I thought the only fireplace plan I’ve ever seen was in the atom shop. I’ve seen like the wood stove but that’s under appliances.
---
Funniest shit ever. lol
---
You are totally oblivious to what is being talked about on this thread. You also have no clue beyond comprehension what two shots are in the game right now. Your comments are invalid and warrant no more response.
---
Yeah, I can swap out Science for Gunsmith for now.  Make some killer rifles in the interim.
---
I feel your pain, melee weapon drops suck in this game 90% of the time. Most high level enemies against my maxed out one armed combat still require an armor piercing or increased attack stats to even be killed. Even level 40 creatures take an absurd amount of swings to kill with a normal weapon. So regardless of how you lost it I'm sorry you now gotta change your playstyle to compensate for it. I used to rail against these posts and accuse OPs of faking controversy to fuck with Bethesda, but then i lost my own weapon in trade. It's a real punch in the gut
---
Would you be willing to msg me these locations ?
---
For me it just takes me back to main menu when I use the leave server button. 
---
Have not tested but I assume its not a legendary at all just a normal weapon armor or some ammo
---
The dmg output of some weapons does hurt the pvp experience big time. How the weapons affect pvp does definitely need to be addressed, however, it does sound like passive mode is what you need. It give you a chance to evaluate the actions of other’s without engaging, I usually switch servers and block if I encounter someone like you have.
---
Hmmm maybe i read it wrong. It was early. I coukda swore it said fire place. Thanks , i bet youre right and i misread it 
---
Any gun is good vs. ghouls. Or just frags. A MIRV will kill an entire group in one go.
---
Pretty much any weapon can own the ghouls, since you have access to glow sights and they are 100% glowing, while being very low hp/resist base mobs.
---
Hey I don't understand the point in diluting radaways and stimpacks why do you do this.
---
I have no clue.
---
This isn't 76bazar
---
Those can be found at random vendors around the wasteland more likely on the bottom half of the map. they’re the brick wall plans or brick something but that’s how the inside looks.
---
What a lovely singing voice you must have. 
---
Question: Am I the only who died when Rose instructed me to get friendly with an albino deathclaw? He slaughtered me with his claws. 
---
Right. Morons think the world revolves around them.
---
As long as you yell "watch out, he's coming right at me" its fair game.
---
No worries bro, if you have any other questions feel free to ask in the reddit or you can send me a DM, might take me a little bit to get to it but I will respond to every message as best I can.
---
People have already told you repeatedly how to avoid this problem.
---
You don't use passive in nuke zones? Good riddance to you and your junk. It's not everyone else's fault that you simply refuse to use a mechanic that's working perfectly as intended and can't handle a single death without going on some whiny tirade.
---
Park Ranger outfit
---
They were worse in Nuka World too, they did a huge amount of damage on top of being damage soakers.  Now they just soak damage.
---
You say it like it's a bad thing. And also like it's impossible to achieve this exact same thing currently. 
---
Look, the way this game is currently set up, you HAVE to server hop. For example, the other day, I'm in the Divide on a lowbie-alt. Level-appropriate for the Divide bracket, and a quest is sending me there, a lvl 25 quest (Order of Mysteries), so I'm right on the money. I walk into a camp and...it's full of lvl 60+ robots (Mr Gutsy Colonels). And those hit HARD. Really, really, really hard. Not even supermutants or Scorched Conquerors of the same level hit that hard. And they're heavily armoured. If I stay, it's a long fight and I'm going to spend a lot of resources going through them, if I don't die in the process. But it's not level-appropriate. So I server-hop, and bam, it's lvl 23 Mr Gutsy's, totally manageable. The game isn't *designed* to let you play it without server hopping.
---
Similarly, the game isn't *designed* to be played without server hopping, because non-container items are first-come-first-served. If someone already looted a location, you'll get nothing from it. If this is the norm, due to bad luck (you always follow 5 mins behind someone else), the game becomes unplayable because you're not getting enough resources. So if you walk into a location and it's stripped, you server hop, and hope you get a fresh server (which, usually, you do, you just rely on RNG right now). 
---
Compare that to EVE Online, where you can't server hop, because it's a persistent universe, a single shard with all users in it. Or Elder Scrolls Online, where you can "instance hop", but don't need to because the game world is scaled to each individual player (a lvl 24 sees a monster as lvl 24, and deals and receives lvl 24 damage to and from it, and a lvl 50 sees the same monster as lvl 50, with commensurate damage), and in-world items are player-instanced (if there's a loaf of bread on the table and I take it, for me it's gone, but you still see it there until you loot it, so nobody is loot-starved when scavenging). 
---
TL:DR - This game is built to server hop, but doesn't give the tools to do so efficiently, which is shoddy work. Just like the rest of the game. 
---
This is pretty cool man, I love your dedication to detail.
---
Your part of the problem then. World doesn’t revolve around you.
---
You get a nice view if you sit down to cook at a cooking fire, too...
---
What glitches does it even have?
---
I havent encountered into any, and well its quite fast and easy 
---
Well if you shit someone or a bot, I am sure they would shoot you instead. Sorry I had a good laugh. I hate phone keyboards sometimes. I phat phinger crap all the time. 
---
Aaaaand you're banned.
---
I dint refuse to use it dude, i forgot it and i was melee using. No tse everywhere 
---
Yes, Fallout 76 has no shortage of balance flaws, but the as far as the weaponry goes, it's one of the more balanced games out there - in theory at least. The gaps between each new weapon level tier isn't big enough to make a significant impact between a low or a high level players. Most of the efficiency, damage, armor penetration and other multipliers are essentially just tied to perks and weapon mods. If you find yourself a level 10 legendary with the right effects, it can easily outperform other legendaries that are level 50, if nothing else once mods are attached. It makes for a good consistent pace in progression, at least as far as weapons themselves go :P
---
As for armor penetration, there are perks for most if not all weapon classes that add armor penetration. Beyond that, there are legendary effects doing the same, as well as magazines with varying degrees of armor penetration. These all stack as well :)
---
Not my style to blast someone's base 🤓
---
Oh, jeez...the arch thing gave me such a flashback. I was farming mutations in Emmett Mountain Disposal (my go-to site) and there was another guy doing the same thing, and I didn't see him, so I slapped on Starched Genes and hopped in the shower, and didn't notice he was standing there, and I think he took his Genes off when I hit the button. Because he started shooting at me. I may have showered off some poor guy's mutations by accident...
---
Yeah, I was wondering why so many scorchbeast kept attacking my camp. now that i know that almost 40% of the time a scorchebeast spawns at location 2 (which i can see from my camp). it'll explain a lot.
---
You can not Still from other players on console. It did happen on PC but it was people using scripts and macros and those people got banned.
---
There is a glitch where Aid items can dis appear from Inventory in game crashes. I have had Corn soup and Purified water disappear after game crashes. That’s why I tend to keep extra Nuka Colas on me just in cause that happens.
---
You probably know this already, but one of the vendors in Whitesprings sells a ton of plans for fancy home furnishings.
---
Go on to the map and press left bumper. This will bring up a menu in which you can view challenges
---
I dont have WW and have had both of those.
---
It would be good if somebody fires a flare it would be like looking for a group or looking for help with something. Like when you get the alert that somebody has launched a nuke, there could also be an alert that somebody has fired a flare, so you can check the map to see the general area where the flare was fired.
---
Level 44 and have never used my haz suit. When do you need them? I just made it to wsr yesterday
---
Damn what a let down. Thanks tho!
---
I don't mind lower toons, I just had to go pacifist because I had a couple trying to tag groups of ghouls with frags and I got fragged instead. So then I would have to throw on PA to make sure I could survive both the lowbies and the ghoulies. 
---
I always lock my door, but I do have an armour bench (for scrapping if overencumbered) and a cooking station outside :p
---
OP thought this was the Market/76 :joy:
---
If anybody wants a Hunter Coat on Xbox I have 2 of them. I’m asking 1200 Caps a piece. Gt themisterphenix Message me and I will get on in a couple of hours.
---
I'm pretty sure it's those are the ones you can buy at Whitesprings resort, I have the Vanity 
---
it's the vendor with the camp plans, sells white spring busts all the time you can't miss him. Just takes a huge amount of Caps to clear out all the plans he has.
---
I do it for longevity of my supplies, mostly. I try to hover around 50 full stimpacks and radaways in my stash, I dilute (or not) based on that. If I'm running lower I'll dilute with Chemist (you get 4 diluted instead of 2), and with First Aid lvl2 the stimpacks do 30% more healing, so it works very well with stimpacks. Radaways I have less justification for, I just worry about running out.

Maybe the wanted player took his junk and stashed it before he died?
---
Wow thats genius I must say
---
I'm lvl100+.  Every time I do Uranium Fever I get a 2/3* legendary something, but  lvl&lt;30.  Useless except for a few extra caps at the vendor.  I so rarely actually interact with people that level because they, like me at that level, run screaming when I try to make a friendly approach to share something.  I always sell it's not worth the weight in my stash.  
---
Yeah it can be dissapointing.

Drunk mid thought. Will edit lol.

Flare gun = MHW Mechanic --&gt; as todd said once before, IT JUST WORKS  (Like the idea, would give me more things to do)

Ghoul flesh does not taste like bacon. Cannibals beware.

Wow really that is misleading, especially for players that are unfamiliar with the taming mechanic. Also I was wondering how much does a pet take up on the base budget specifically. I mean if you a lv 50+. I need to knmow since my c.a.m.p.  has been cut down so I have extra space (about the size of 2 mk2 turrets). Is this enough?
---
Sure because you've never had a person irl just strike up a random conversation with you out of the blue with no prior contact with said person. Not even a hi first. They just jump right into it.

Could be... I guess we'll never know.

Underarmour items are classed as costumes as they change your appearance, if I'm not mistaken

**READ THE LIMITATIONS OF THE MOD BEFORE COMPLAINING IT DOESN'T WORK**
---
Using the Scan and Repair in the Game Options tab option on the launcher has got quests back for me in the past.
---
The real end game is beating crashes and server disconnects. The real survival game is surviving the mental and emotional toil of launching a nuke on the queen only to disconnect when she is at 5% health or have her bug out entirely. People think the cost of repairs are high, but no amount of ballistic fiber can help repair the soul who contends with these things daily...
---
I used purple in FO4
---
I guess to many of us it’s not a PvP game... it’s a community of people trying to survive the wasteland. As in real life, the majority of the time it’s a collaborative effort where people come together to accomplish something greater... sure there are PvP elements here and there to add that extra danger element of anyone you meeting could be a crazy raider, but the majority of people are good people just trying to survive.
---
Imperfect and doesn’t help us console bound folk. Bethesda still needs to address this.
---
You are right, brother! 
---
I keep my door open with the “Welcome Home” neon sign lit up next to it.
---
Bethesda feels the diametrically opposite is true. They just announced they'll be adding always-on PvP mode to the game this year. 
---
Are you leaving out part of the story? Is it some kind of exploit, or did you do something to flag yourself for pvp?
---
They’re always at the hemlock groves workshop and take some extra time to kill. 
---
Heh, me neither (most of the time). Still its frustrating that bounties are apparently permanent. Like they should decay over time, so if you have a small bounty of say 10 or 20 caps, it should decay at a rate of 5 caps per 15 minutes or something. As it stands it seems to just go on and on. I was wanted the other day for an hour with a 10 cap bounty, and nobody cared enough to come try to kill me because the cost of fast travel alone would be more than the reward. Finally I went to watoga and chased people around punching them then standing there unarmed like "cmon kill me!". Finally someone figured it out and put me out of my misery...
---
Bethesda should just buy the rights to mods like these and incorporate.
---
Cool I am probably going to start to do the same now
---
I heard a large explosion, so I turned around looking for it, but saw nothing. Turned back around and jumped because there was a deathclaw corpse on my deck. No clue where it came from because nothing attacks my camp. At best a super mutant spawns at the base of the cliff and tries to shoot up at my camp but can't get a clear shot. 
---
Like everyone else has said, it is not possible to trade steal.  If something disappeared out of his inventory then he got rid of it.  It can also happen that after a trade the server "forgets" you have an item but upon relogging in it will be back.
---
I almost made a post very similar to this. If the duping problem is not fixed adequately and the stash limit it not increased substantially with the next patch, I'm probably out.
---
These are things that NEVER should have made it into the final game in the first place and if they did should have been dealt with IMMEDIATELY. I'm sorry, but i just feel like I'm on a sinking ship at this point...
---
There is go into map screen press l1 on PS4 don’t know about other consoles then down to settings then enable pacified mode 
---
Nope unfortunately not, I was walking around near, but not inside the munitions factory and I got killed by someone invisible. I sat there and waited in my corpse feeling absolutely humiliated and could hear them running around but not breaking stealth, sat the duration to make sure it wasn't a stealth boy.    
---
Been riddled with some unfortunate bugs today, so I'm just gonna log off for a bit.
---
Yea that's not rewarding to kill someone for 10 caps and we're here, all alone.. We could also pay a robot sherif or something you know
---
Better for the dupers in the long run too, as they probably have thousands of them and can keep selling them as they break. 
---
Yeah, so? Accidental actions still have consequences, and that player is not your mommy. It sucks that you lost your junk, but you're the one who messed up, and you paid the price for it. Don't do it again.
---
Sounds like you had a bounty. He wouldn't be able to do damage if you weren't hostile to each other in some way.
---
Great work, but the nitpicking asshole in me was triggered by your failure to list the encounters in order of highest-lowest
---
Thx for doing it tho 
---
Good for them in the short run, but the caveat is this requires duping to be fixed so that eventually they will run out and replacements need to be earned fairly.
---
That has a backpack?
---
There goes the neighborhood. Awesome shot!
---
The only thing I can think is that I was still flagged from my munitions factory? I don't really play this game to PvP but I'm familiar with the system as I've fought plenty of times.
---
Sure, I go hunting all the time in real life and behave just like in a post apocalyptic video game.
---
**How to identify a duper (or duped item purchaser) on Reddit:** They have *ever* criticized an anti-duping post.
---
It's really that simple.
---
There is a perk called Wrecking Ball that increases damage done to workshop items. I assume having this equipped would make your package smaller. If you invest in rank 3 I'm sure it would become non existent.
---
Lol feeling humiliated? You died in a video game
---
I sometimes find a level 5-10 over in the mire or bog and I am just amazed, I was like 30 before I even got to Watoga. Although I did have to take one out for trying to steal my acid from an extractor. I am a out and whenever I get workshops going I get 30 minutes to an hour before the game decides I need to visit the home screen. So I spend tons of junk that I keep to a minimum in my stash so now I have to build it back up. I don't know why I keep doing workshops. I never profit from them. 
---
Short run? They have millions of caps
---
I'm back on the game after a month too and so far I'm liking it. Not much changed but it's more stable and there's a way less loss of fps
---
The red dress is the same, I had to change to the Ratty skirt (new favourite) so my photo gallery was a little less NSFW
---
How do they have millions when they can only have 25000 at a time? 
---
Only way you could be flagged from a previous server is a bounty. If you attacked building items or turrets belonging to another players ammunition factory, then you would have a bounty that stays with you. 
---
Also, if you were to completely disable pvp you would never be allowed to use workshops as they are pvp areas. 
---
You did the right thing. 
---
What a salty individual.  Get help.
---
They did try to patch it when they fixed the nukes. It was fixed within the hour.
---
Isn't Whitesprings one of the most commonly nuked places due to the broken spawn rates?
---
"Level 5" 
---
"Proper Justice"
---
And someone swinging away at you with a machete for 2 minutes doing tiny damage is so immersive.
---
Right....
---
Could be the brotherhood field scribe outfit, i don't have a reference image to compare it to though
---
I agree.  That's exactly what a cheater would do.  They cheat the game, they get caught, they continue their lies on reddit.  A cheater is a cheater. 
---
 There's no doubt in my mind that mods are fine and won't lead to a ban.
---
PvP is disabled until level 5, the level 5 player has now tried to initiate PvP with you (as per game mechanics) and you have accepted and returned the favour.
---
No griefing here, move along
---
BoS combat armor mod increases the damage resistances. So it's very nice.

---
...and ancient demons start climbing out of the giant rifts created in the Earth's surface.
---
Fuck Scorchbeasts, I wanna see some Cloverfield level shit!
---
not for me at least xd
---
I would add a few other things.
---
Currently, having other players around is a 50/50 chance of a liability. For example, if you happen to die, they can rez you, OR they can take your scrap without getting flagged for PvP, and leave server. It's a coinflip who you get. If loot from player you didn't kill wasn't lootable to other players, this would help. Conversely, taking someone else's stuff should flag you for PvP, and lock you to a specific server until you lose the wanted status.
---
Similarly, certain enemies scale (Queen, spawns), so that if you're lvl 25 in Divide, grouping with a lvl 100 is not a good idea, because if enemies spawn for him, you'll be fighting lvl 68 enemies, and getting loot you can't use for 20 more levels. And if the enemies spawn for you, your lvl 100 companion will be bored killing lvl 18 enemies, and getting crap loot he doesn't want. So neither of you is happy half the time. Using Elder Scrolls Online as an example, that game scales everything to each player dynamically. You're lvl 24? Every enemy in the game is lvl 24, and hits and has HP as lvl 24. Same enemy, to a lvl 50 player, looks as lvl 50, and hits and has HP as a lvl 50. And drops level appropriate loot. Meaning you always fight enemies that are appropriate to your level, and always get loot you can use, and thus can group with anyone and go anywhere and enjoy co-op.
---
Second, there should be an incentive to group. Again, using Elder Scrolls Online as an example, when you group with 1 other person, you get an automatic 10% XP increase. If you also marry them (I know, I cringe at that too), it's an additional 10% XP. This game attempted to do this with the Charisma perk, but not everyone has that perk, or the room to slot it. Especially at lower levels. If Bethesda just made that perk PASSIVE and gave it out for free, that alone would have incentivized grouping immensely.
---
Damn, that’s seriously RAD🌝🌚
---
Same here... its comedy gold. 
---
Best part is if the door is open... it doesn't indicate a lock on the door.
---
I should use small letters for the ceiling of the john that says "f. trav?"
---
How would you acquire the mods and armor?
---
And how is it with rads?
---
Ditto. On console it says “leave world”
---
So what can i do?
---
Screw them. There's no correct way to play a game.
---
As for everything thing in life, we should just care less about what people say.. :)
---
Yeah. That's part of why I put my camp so close.
---
Thank you for reminding me that crawl out through the fallout never made the cut for this game so we can never pray those ICBMs keep us free.
---
You want Power Smith that opens up at level 41.
---
I like the lower lvls running around. Gathers up all the ghouls for me to mow down easier.
---
Much proud if your on Xbox I have a good community of friends that rock at this game, and I’m sure my wife would like to play with another female (don’t tell her I said that)
---
This is awesome, I’m still trying to get that “perfect” pose in front of a Nuke. 
---
10 spawn near blast radius
---
20 Get ya pose out
---
30 Spam the snapshot feature 
---
40 go to 10
---
The guys down at r/Fo76creations would love this too
---
Yes and since Bethesda didn't have the tools to track duped items I don't see that changing. 
---
My suggestion isn't about how to punish dupers but how to effectively remove duped items from the economy over time.
---
This isn't a perfect solution either, I acknowledge that. 
---
You could further evolve the idea such that this "effect" only applies to purchased or traded items but not ones you craft or earn yourself.
---
No, it’s called Power Smith, same as armorer perk but, for power armor.
---
I only have it for the arm pieces and haven't applied it yet. I think it might add a little rad resist but I can't remember. I'm actually trying to get the full set of plans. It also changes the paint scheme look of the armor which is nice also.
---
There needs to be a pose, not sure what to call it, where your char stands with both arms up in the air in a Y stance looking up. Maybe "salvation"?
---
Bathing in the glory of Atom. 
---
I think that stance would be ideal for pics like this. 
---
I give it a thumbs up, though. Sorry of my lack of enthusiasm, but I'm just getting used to seeing that specific pose in nearly every nuke pic. No other stance really works.
---
Love it! It gives me a Red Dead vibe with the red, yellow, orange colors and the black silhouette.

4 exploding shotguns means nothing. This is a multiplayer game with a few different trading platforms. Maybe they all like shotguns, saved caps, and bought them off other players. Being level 100+ also means they have a pretty good amount of play time in. Could the shotguns themselves been duped by someone else? Sure that's possible, but it's also 100% possible these 4 kids bought them off other players.
---
I see you also purchased the dumpster sludge carpet.
---
Love this spot. Watched many a nukes land here. An my base used to be right behind it on the lead node for a bit.
---
The rocketgirl suit is unfortunately a whole outfit, like the hazmat suit. You can't wear anything else with it. 
---
Wait, rebuild cache or database? Are these the same thing? Because i rebuilt my database a while back thinking it would help and it really didn't.
---
Congrats.  You're better off without toxic douchebags like that in your life.
---
If you have 6int though and perk points to spend, never hurts to “try” and see if it reduces material costs even further. But seeing as after lvl 50 the entire game is liners progression, there really isn’t a “wasting” of perk points...after lvl 50 it’s essentially just...collecting every perk card that exists.
---
He should have heeded the "employees only" sign above the door.

I prefer my atom cats T-60 tbh.
---
Ah maybe. I finally got that and it looked better in
---
A picture. I'll check later. Thanks man

Sounds like you need...[the Nut Bra!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VpdWOVsM0o)

Iam a level 130. I like to sneak into people's camps and drop loot for them. I roam around whitsprings helping who ever stops by. If you see a ritual mask spooky boi with a hunters long coat somehow got into your camp. Don't be afraid. I have treats for you.
---
I like taking Lakeside Cabins for the lead whenever I plan to play a couple hours. Most of the time I load in it's not owned but every now and then someone has it. I just look to see who owns it currently and if they're much higher level then okay maybe next server. But sadly for the person if they're about my level pr lower yeah I'm taking it by force. 
---
Just last night I got on and some poor level 8 (I'm currently level 26, second character) claimed it and was almost done fortifying the damn place with concrete walls. He forgot to lock the door... 
---
So in I go and obviously he's damn near helpless and I take the cabins. Dude was persistent though and glad he was. He came back 4 times and died 4 times. Completely returned my caps I  invested to the Cabins. 
---
Moral is: don't waste time building a fortress. Someone will just come in and wipe it out and now you're out all those resources. 
---
(Begins crafting antiseptic)
---
Compared to regular combat armor it’s roughly twice as strong defensively, I’ve been farming mine off the dead body of Elizabeth taggerdy in the glass cavern. But it resets just like any other loot so server hoping doesn’t work.
---
Bethesda needs a tough hand with cheaters like Blizzard.
---
you cheated ? permanent ban
---
you duplicated? 3 month ban
---
Did you take advantage of a bug? 6 month ban
---
I’m not sure on budget increasing, don’t know if that’s a myth or not. I’m lvl 115 or so so I can’t remember what the budget was when under 50
---
You have 5 turrets though, that’s far too many. No need for that amount. If possible, scrap everything and start again and watch your budget meter as you add items, you will quickly catch on what adds noteable space and what you can spam 
---
Know where the plans spawn?
---
Nice job and also be ready for like a dozen or more new boyfriend offers to pop up in your inbox because of this. 
---
It doesn’t add any radiation res it just has high ballistic and energy resistance compared to every other armor, marine armor is the only endgame balanced armor that adds radiation resistance
---
Agreed but again my suggestion is not what to do with the dupers but how to mitigate the problem of the duped items in the game.
---
I'd rather see a server wipe instead. Always seeing level 500+ and wondering if they got there legitimately.
---
im lv90 and best I've found is a lv 50 Molerat Gauntlet extra blade, 40% attack speed, 10% damage if mutated, and 15% less damage while blocking.
---
It's 300 damage per swing achieveed though bloody mess and 19 strength points and fist specialisation which is about 1000dps which is in line with most 'best' weapons nowdays. 
---
It's better than my Instigating Super Sledge as the attack speed along with Martial Artist makes this INSANE. Although Instigating Super Sledge would be number 1 for max burst (2x damage on max hp enemies)
---
I have had my own brahmin turn hostile just by walking up to it. The whole system is broken. I've also had other peoples base defenses shoot at me just by getting too close, but I didn't have plague walker active at the time and I had no bounty, so it just doesn't work properly.
---
Or good habits since bad driving is detrimental while XP tagging isn’t 
---
Why should players who get their gear legitimately be punished for dupers?
---
Yes please. While they're at it, can we get a tag for the passive bloatflies spawned by the Bloatfly Syringer? 
---
I would support a wipe as there isn't a lot of permanence to this game anyway. 
---
Willing to trade for eagle eye serum?
---
Been playing a lot of Battlefield 5 at the minute and the bolt action rifle shells all have this, such a cool feature. Last man standing, firing off headshots and hearing the shells bounce on the floor really adds to immersion! 
---
No it isn't, but it would make you reach the "pinnacle of the game" called Whitesprings later.

Have you tried Tetris?

I also cause earthquakes. I created ebola and aids. I enjoy watching people in their pitiful misery and their bizarre thoughts about just about everything.

Bethesda: *admin-only middle finger emote* no
---
“I play an online game that has the option to turn pvp on and off and someone destroyed my base, god I hate griefers” online game, pvp. No such thing as griefers, I hate how sensitive gamers have become. Go play a game that DOESNT have pvp so you can complain about griefing.
---
If youre on pc it doesnt do that for us console players.
---
I play energy pistols. They are just as viable. You just need to carry 4. 
---
I 100% support this.
---
I think OP meant you don't even take slap damage. If you set yourself to be unable to damage others then they shouldn't be able to damage you. 
---
I feel like there should be two levels. Full on pacifist with no damage either way and something in the middle where you can't initiate PvP by shooting a player or their stuff, but if someone else attacks you, then you can choose to engage or ignore. Basically you shoot back, which does slap damage, but engages full PvP for both parties. Then you can kill to your hearts content. 
---
I'd prefer to not accidentally trigger a bounty by accidentally shooting someone's base while defending it, but be able to defend myself while not having to navigate a stupid menu. 
---
I like the cheating ban, but duping, much less taking advantage of a bug... That's on Bethesda...
---
Ill never understand the mentality to punish players that utilize broken game mechanics/problems with software.
---
You want people to stop having infinite carry weight? Fix that bug.
---
Stop duping? Fix those bugs...
---
I dont think Synth were around 25 years after the great war
---
Turn on passive friend, it’ll help keep the bounty off
---
I didn't know about this. 
---
Oh my god just think I would have (possibly) finally found my freakin raider shielded lining plan. Shit.

Near my camp they began to fall braham of the sky xd. These zetan do not look where they throw their garbage.

I just purchased the Heavy Leather legs from the vendor inside of Grafton, not the train station.  My understanding is that he is the best vendor to purchase Armor plans from.

Khajiit has wares, if you don’t have coin! 
---
Haha oops 
---
What level are you?
---
Because it's still wrong and cheating to use a bug to your advantage, especially knowingly doing so.
---
what level are you
---
I'm Melee.  But I'll negotiate if you're low on caps.
---
I don't know it is just what I thought I remembered. It says it in game.

“Underwear.... my underwear never changes.”  However many outfits you find or buy, you are still wearing the same pair of tidy whities you put on that morning in the vault.

It will spawn eventually but based on my visits I think it is rarer. Every once in awhile there is a vampire too but I don't think he drops plans.

They should just remove white springs as a Nuke zone, and to hell with the complaining higher level players

Scorch Beasts will never be that metal.

im thinking more like dpsing the queen lol, what do there
---
It doesn’t appear on the main menu if that’s where you were. The option appears only in-game in the settings.
---
That is awesome for at lvl 34
---
I didn't think so either.  But when that one was behind me and seemed like it crept up on me was really really creepy.  And fallout has never creeped me out.
---
I always had mine set to light blue across all games. Not being able to do this is putting me through withdrawals.
---
'You have become addicted to changing your HUD color to light blue'
---
Things may have changed but in our group for the first queen fight thought that it would be a smart idea to spam orbital strikes, and mini nukes, while forgetting to **turn on pacifist mode.**  Boy did we have a bounty on our heads, failed the queen and had to kill more people than it was worth, in the end we had to drop team and killed each other to remove the wanted status. Still conscripted into pvp with them, down on stims, caps and ammo, we all just called it a night.
---
 This was over a month ago, 11/20\*(we were lvl70\~80), so the tse dupe venders weren't a thing yet, meaning most players were manageable.
---
That date will not be forgotten, and neither will **turning on pacifist** mode.
---
To add to Liberation- I think it would be really cool to introduce an anti-air mechanic. The enemy invaders are dropped by air and you have the chance to mow them down with fixed flak turrets before they land. If you coordinate with friends you can shoot down dropships to cause a spectacular explosion. Top it all off, send various American machines corrupted by Chinese tech- American tank that only has one functioning barrel, American Mr Gutsy that has malfunctioned significantly and has to be mounted on a brain-controlled Radstag, and ultimately a couple of Chinese-manufactured bad Liberty Primes. Call them Liberty Omegas or something, with glaring errors like overheating or discharging and you’ve got to support Liberty Prime in the smackdown. Turn up to the next level and implement a traitor mechanic- one player participating is at random chosen to be a Chinese sympathizer who can sabotage the defense efforts
---
Well that's interesting! I can only pacify deathclaws with wasteland whisperer. Haven't maxed out animal friend because bear &lt; deathclaw haha 
---
Shit you do damage. Mind if I ask what your load out is that’s allowing that much damage?
---
Glad I skimmed to the end before wasting my time reading the whole thing.
---
It's only morally wrong. Bugs can be exploited as long as they don't use 3rd party software to do so.
---
Get the starched genes and Class freak perks, then bird bones and marsupial mutations then you fly like a hero....if you don't mind eating and drinking more then speed freak also.. really flying now :-)
---
Yeah I want to know where every silo cover is, but I haven’t found any post or YouTube video with the locations yet. 
---
Im hoping they finish the pet system. They seem to have a framework but like I said, didnt finish it :x
---
With the max server population being what it is, a chat window is objectively the best method.  Would allow effective communication with the server such as "can i get some help in watoga?"  Or "ive got a shop set up in the forest with free purified water" , or "nuking prime in 5 minutes, get ready"
---
Obviously there will be toxic people (as with any online community)  and Bethesda will have to put in the tools to manage that, such as community standards, block features, a report system, and put together a department to handle complaints.
---
Its possible there could be gen 1 synth. The wiki has no time period 
---
Actually this will have the opposite effect.
---
Currently, too much duping would lead to market oversaturation. Each person needs 1 TSE shotgun, or maybe 2. Or 3 at most. Once they have it, they're not going to buy them any more. Thus, duping stops, there's no more market to sell. It's oversaturated. 
---
What you are suggesting would create continuous need for more duped items, as old TSE weapons get "used up". So the duping will continue to  be very profitable, and thus will continue.
---
And I'm reasonably sure Bethesda (or at least this specific studio doing things now) it's good enough to close *all* the dupes. They've been at it 2 months, and duping still exists, still going strong. 
---
Another way they could indirectly address it is simply via balancing, which is the best approach anyway. Currently TSEs are in a league of their own. Nothing else compares for most applications. Which renders 99% of other stuff pointless. Rebalancing the game so that every gun has a strong side and a weak side, and variety becomes spice of life, duping would become untenable. Dupers would have to maintain insanely large stock. Which is easily fixed, by limiting max carry capacity (where your character just dies immediately under the weight of 1,000 guns you have in your inventory).
---
Yeah this what I’ve been doing. The challenges part, not the nuking people. Although one of my self imposed challenges was to follow around and eat someone so maybe not exactly better but eh whatever. 
---
Amen
---
Any events I can do to get the legendary stuff?
---
The way I see it if you don't want to pvp you don't have to. But if people use shitting tactics to trick people into pvp, like  teaming up with them then shooting someone so the other person can kill them and steal their junk, I see that as griefing. It's forcing pvp on someone in a game that attempts to prevent unconsensual pvp. Either make the game open pvp or don't. Can't be bothered with BS metagaming and people exploiting stupid pvp flagging rules.
---
Don’t my friend your secret is safe with me
---
Didn't really get much of a chance was all over in about 3 seconds then the guy got on hands and and knees begging and I finished him off and nicked his caps 
---
Try making a vault outfit from the armor workbench and try to see if that works. If not, sorry to say but I think the costume is technically under armor 
---
They could have still done this if your doors were locked, they could just use the interments animation to glitch though the wall.  Tip for people that lock their base, don't stick interaction items to close to a window.
---
Lmfao I find people at workshop defenses to try and kill me.....its a tough task getting people to take the bounty sometimes.
---
Sounds like spring 'screen door' atom shop sale incoming.
---
Nope, if somebody placed their armour then it won't let you interact with it at all. 
---
Meanwhile, I'm killing all the ghouls and the wendingo's through the window by myself.....
---
I havent tested it personally. My statement based off of many sessions in blast zones and uranium fever events with no one ever getting a bounty. Though this could be because everyone turns on pacifist mode during the events, come to think of it, and not a feature of coop events. Lol
---
And there has always been speculation that in fallout 4 the mannequins were synths based on some of the strange poses, places and scenarios there were found in.
---
Keep your head high and keep on gaming regardless of what others say, you play your way and your way alone. Others? Well as my small cousins say, they can go jump in a jelly roll. Still trying to figure out what that means.
---
Just wait. New content will be here eventually 
---
If it's not in a pen, reflex will take the first shot, after that it's kill or be killed, so your friend will have to die.
---
They didn't know what they had. A girl who likes gaming is awesome to have as a girlfriend. Their loss. You keep sneaking around the wasteland baby girl. Play how you wanna play. 
---
okey, do u know what can i wear with this underarmor? \*name of skin :P
---
Yeah. The wiki says in the 2170s the institute couldnt rely on gen 1s anymore. 
---
Its a shitload of Mr.Gutsy, Protectron, Assaultron, a few Robobrains and one Sentry-bot near the end.
---
If you got hacking on level 3, you can reprogram the turrets to shot at everything that moves, making it easyer for you.
---
I hope sooner than later!
---
He logged off shortly after I killed him for second time so I think he was the one getting offended 
---
I haven't played 76 yet but fo4 had settlement build limits is that what the budget is referring to maybe. 
---
I was doing daily quest, was half way done with it, then I had to go pick up different kind of samples all over the map. When I fast traveled to Deathclaw island, game decided to froze and shut down. When I restarted game, the quest was gone. What a waste of time and money... (played on PC) 
---
I think my comment sounded a bit more hostile than I intended, but you’re pretty cool for helping out low levels, I know I’ve had a few level 100s help me. So good on you. :D
---
I've been there twice. Sneaky-sneaky. The buggers spawned in right behind me. If only I could still slam RadAway like it's Fallout 4. I've heard it's totally worth it, but next time I'm just going to stomp in in my power armour.
---
Ok, so then why should a player who spent hours grinding for caps to purchase a 3-star bloodied explosive faster-reloading shotgun with a prime receiver, be forced to go through the days-long process of hunting down another one because of dupers?  Even though some items may be duped, they still get legitimately acquired by people who purchased them from the dupers.
---
Big update this month i heard, but no proof. I heard we can open our own shops soon also
---
I have nuked a few peoples camps but the setting challenges is not a bad idea. Thank you!
---
I had the same reaction to the guy that put me out of my misery, literally followed him/her around for a while like I owed them my life haha
---
Fast traveling to Vault 76, sitting on the bench directly outside, sulking and waiting for my punishment. This did the trick
---
I have also heard such rumours but again with no hard evidence :( 
---
casual PS4 gamer here... didn't know this.
---
Thanks for the PSA!
---
Np 
---
That's what the finger guns emote is for.
---
Most of the toxic players have already gotten a refund for Fallout 76. Everyone I've come across is really nice.
---
Hmm. Perhaps I should try it out, thanks mate! 
---
fo76 internet girlfriend, I'm interested lol
---
Truly though, as long as you're having fun who cares what anyone else thinks of how you play or about a particular game. Those exes are 'shitplayers' compared to professional game players, but hopefully they still have fun.
---
What a hero. Well done on those 5 caps.
---
Bethesda ports dragon shout assets
---
Thanks so much :)
---
Was nice not being killed and having to respawn while in middle of something due to the fact someone wanted to be a dick.. so yes more immersive

---
So that's how I play. Sneak, explore, nice and slow. There's a ton of details you'll miss if you just plow through. 
---
You should be able to wear pretty much anything else over the top, just not that particular outfit. Same deal for the hazmat suit and tattered rags. 
---
If you wear armor but no "skins" over the top the underarmor and armor will show same as the vault suit.  
---
think i have to stop using those mutation serums :D
---
Thank you! I feel stupid I kept trying from the main menu. 
---
Trapper also has rads resist.
---
Not sure if you're joking, but in case you're not, yes lots of others died as well, rose is a bitch and trying to kill you.
---
lol :)
---
I don't play on PS4 but a bit of friendly advice: the shocks sell in the shop for 510 caps with 3 charisma and no other effects.  While the jetpack may be enough for one shock, you might want to offer up more in caps.
---
So the end game of the game, is not to have fun content to play, but to get bored and welcome new players into the game.
---
Your a fucking idiot.
---
Kinda embarrassing cause I could figure it out ...level 47. I got it now, thanks everyone.
---
With escape artist and other sneak perks: sneak shot the queen -&gt; go ooc -&gt; sneak shot the queen. 
---
Not really fun but I'd argue it is your best option for staying alive while fighting SBQ if using low HP build with unyielding armors.
---
Girl, if you're on XBOX hit me up (drop that GT in a pm) and I'll help you take on the nuke zones and kick so much ass! You can take all kinds of screenshots of yourself posing with the dead SBQ and a pile of ghouls/meat at whitesprings to send to those dicks.
---
Like you, I do not have the response time that makes me great at video games like my brother (he's really good) and boyfriend. I also run into the geometry a lot in all games. I rely heavily on VATS still, did constantly in FO4, and am trash with guns without VATS so I'm melee. The nice thing about these two guys is they've never trashed me or my skills in games.
---
When a game requires you to be creative instead of creating content for you. It’s a shit game
---
Awesome shot!  Much better than mine. http://imgur.com/gallery/85hEbdK
---
This is fucking lame get back to the kitchen 
---
They're planning some respecs in the future. Plenty have already voiced their concerns regarding outgoing energy damage. Currently there is no need for energy resist and I'd like to see that change. There should be a need to pick a compromise when choosing armor. 
---
Like radiation weapons do no damage to the most anyting but maybe they shouldn't be a damaged dealing weapon to begin with. Maybe they should be weapons that mutate already heavily radiated enemies. Turning ghouls into glowing ones for example. 
---
I seen something like this... Xbox?
---
deadly_pygmy
---
You talking about that underground tunnel that goes from that north eastern workshop (bog town?) To watoga?
---
It's how much stuff you can build before the game won't let you place any more items.
---
I finally just tamed a level 20 Giant Sloth last night! His name is Sebastian and he is a sweet boy!
---
Not sure what happened to my post but I tested this last night with the grounded serum. My energy resistance was ~380ish and the damage was the same as before taking the serum. So it isnt energy damage. I thought about radiation damage. Don't think it is this either. No matter how small of radiation you get, it still will either show up in your health bar, show a little radiation symbol under your AP bar (tested this in the AMS building. &lt;1 Rad shows symbol walk out of range and symbol disappears) or you get the geiger ticks. Also because it already has a radiation attack from its crop dusting. Another way I figure its not radiation because they can still destroy robots and I believe robots dont take rad damage. Not 100% on that but it'd make sense since they arent fleshy creatures like humans. It's already been ruled out that it isnt ballistic so that really only leaves explosive. It just might be a really weak version of the damage otherwise itd be cleaning house in under a minute with it's spamming crap. 
---
Sitting on a pretty stash of Xbox gift cards.

The blackbird. Will. Be. MINE.

Thanks for the advise! Tought i bought the first mod for 3xx caps.

I Just adjusted it.

Wait what! That i soo stupid.
---
So outside of VATS you can't accidentally shoot at someone or something just down the sights to cause a slap, but VATS will let you target someone unintentionally?
---
There is guided rockets?
---
But thanks
---
To add to this, each weapon type has an associated Perk card relating to crippling.  For Shotguns, it's Enforcer.  For Rifles, it's Tormentor, etc.
---
At its peak, Enforcer is like a 30% chance of crippling a limb.  Shotguns may not have the range of other weapons, even modded, but it basically means that anything that gets close enough can be effectively paralyzed.
---
Is hat game from 2014?
---
Camp budget (first use) is your “empty bucket” when you build anything within C.A.M.P (for example) this “bucket” will fill up accordingly. Once you’ve filled that “bucket” to the top, you can no longer add anything, however, removing/breaking down C.A.M.P items will bring the “bucket” level down, thus allowing you to add something else if and when needed.
---
Note: Storing C.A.M.P items within this mode will not reduce you budget (bucket) only destroying said item will free up space.
---
I hope I understood you currently and this helps
---
When my buddies and i first entered the blast zone at around lv25, there was a group of 4 high levels that would kill us every so often and knab the shit we farmed. They had followed us when we tried to make some distance between our groups. Got annoying real quick. 
---
Every time you create something at yur camp yur budget meter will go up. Walls,crops,turrets,work stations,decorations,generators,....etc. Once that meter fills totally up it wont let you build anymore. Scrapping the created items will make that meter go down again. If you store something you created it still adds on to the budget.  Storing lets you keep something you created without scrapping it altogether.  Beware though,turrets take A LOT of the budget.  
---
It was a 1 day only, like this, so it's gone I am afraid...
---
I know the pain.  I crashed to desktop a few seconds after killing her last night, and got no loot because of the spinventory bug.
---
KK &lt;3
---
XP tagging is fine but farming and cheesing as a low level is just another form of cheating.  Lame players be lame I guess.
---
You damn PC players are wonderful and helpful people and I'm so jealous of you as I'm console. :)
---
Yeah it's a bit annoying - I blew most of my budget on turrets initially so had to scrap most of them haha. I guess it's due to servers or something.
---
You did, ty for help.
---
It drives me nuts when posts like this get so many upvotes. I don't even like pvp, but I understand it's part of the game, and I'm not gonna demand people avoid playing part of the game that they paid for because *I* don't like it.
---
 All posts like this do, is ensure that I'll be a bastard online, all day today, might even go pet hunting now.
---
If you never plan to instigate PvP, chuck on pacifist mode in settings (or even turn it on/off as you please). Your shots won't hurt other players and you won't get wanted for it
---
You can also get to this from the Map screen in-game.  On PC, you hit Z while in the map, and Challenges is one of the options you can pick.
---
Lol same thing i did
---
Everything you build in your camp takes up space. Including the wires you use for power. When removing (scrapping) anything with wires attached, make sure you scrap the wires first other wise they take up invisible space. 
---
When you run out of "budget", you can't place anything else down, so make sure you place your necessities first. 
---
When you move your camp, everything goes into storage and/or is blueprinted. When you go to place your camp again, it will tell you if it can be set down in one piece, or if you need to store everything and set down new as a redesign. 
---
Do a search online for "FO76 camp mechanics" - there are several great sites out there with step-by-steps.
---
You can get the BOS upgrades by scrapping regular combat armor pieces.
---
Its not the modern...it was my first and I thought it would look cool....was way wrong.

so I haven’t maxed out animal whisperer yet, and I’m just curious; if you tame an animal, do they follow you? Or just stay in the spot where it was tamed?

I would like a mentoring type system. Even as a lowly level 30 player I like going to flatwoods and bodyguarding new players. I wish there was a way I could 'join' their quest but give them say 75% of the xp even if I'm the only one who kills an enemy.
---
This is my first online gaming experience and I gotta say the community here and in game is awesome.
---
IDK, if you one shot the legendaries you’re loot is usually shit IMO you need to let them regenerate. I use a Tesla Rifle or Molotov to tag everyone when there is a mob of players.
---
I hope it will increase over time.
---
Keep it up. I've had the game since november and am only level 48 and haven't killed a scorchbeast on my own, only with my buddies. I have a similar playstyle. Been enjoying the map. 
---
Congrats! And please don't date any more guys who make you feel this way!! A guy who respects you will never make you feel bad for doing what you love.
---
You need them in nuked areas, and in some super radioactives places like inside nuclear reactors.
---
I literally only found out that this is a thing earlier today.
---
You earn a ton of atoms on the way though. You're like the 30th person to address this is this sub
---
An unfinished Bethesda game happened
---
haha didnt realise you could lock them!
---
Fellow girl gamer here who honestly has the same play style as you. While I do try to play the main story, most of the time I like to explore and go my own pace. If you’re on PC, I’d love to join you~
---
Still relatively low level (30), found harper's ferry for the first time last night.... 
---
I literally fought 30-40 super mutants there. Idk what's up with that town, but they were still spawning as I tucked tail, and ran. Looked like a super mutant town to me. You have been warned, lol.
---
I also like to use light blue. I can confirm the addiction is worse then Jet withdraws. 
---
(Small Spoiler alert) When you unlock the plans for the xo1 armor via the enclave missions the base paint of the armor will be painted like that. You can change it to a normal silver color if you want but the standard xo1 armor you craft will have an enclave paint job
---
Lol maybe I have to lose and regain it again?
---
One of the daily challenges yesterday/this morning (not sure when they reset) was to take a photo while you're starkers apart from a hat. I took mine playing a tuba (my own one though!) 10 atoms for the shop! :) 
---
Nice that these guys made it a team event...! 
---
Okay, I’m glad I’m not the only one who has no interest in chems. Like I know they have cool effects but I’m not interested in it. I just sell them all lol.
---
Okay. Ty
---
Mutations are suppressed if you use rad-x. Did you use that?
---
So I don’t know if this is correct, but I saw somewhere around here once that buildable items cost less of your budget the higher level you are. You might have to scrap every item and then rebuild to see the difference. 
---
Can someone confirm or deny this?
---
Nice, you go girl :)
---
Soon you will be launching nukes :)
---
How about just make them immune to other players unless engaged in combat 
---
No I checked that and like I said other mutations were working 
---
The way looting works is wrong then, not melee itself.
---
I still can't find the Barn Building Set!
---
 I get that the reputation of bethesda is pretty shit now, but I wouldn't call it a rumor really.
---
"Like our December 11 update, we will have a big  update that will address many of the issues you’ve been providing  feedback on. Full patch notes will follow soon. 
---
We’re  also building an incredible list of future updates that we can’t wait  to share, including new quests, weekly in-game events, new Vaults  opening, a new PvP mode, Player Vending and much more. "

A cache is where temporary data is stored and readily available for use by the system. It should be safe to clean your cache on any device. Your database, well, your system and save files are going to be stored elsewhere and the PS4 would definitely warn you before you erase these. :\]
---
Rebuilding your database is necessary when important files that provide proper function have been corrupted. This means you wipe all the files, and redownload them, attempting to solve a corruption issue. Your cache on the otherhand, doesn't always clean itself the best. Sometimes temporary files that really aren't needed get stored and stuck in there. This eventually will create a jumble of files not necessarily knowing what they're supposed to be doing. Hence rebuilding your cache is beneficial. Think of it like cookies on the web. When you visit a site for the first time it will generally load slower than the second time you go to access it. This is because your computer/phone is actually downloading data from that website and having it "on deck" and ready to go for the next time you visit.
---
It's actually a lot more advanced than this. End result being: clean your cache every once in a blue moon.
---
Also, and I do not recommend this as any warranties will be void and you can permanently ruin your system, but I take mine apart every month and clean it out really well. Keeps the fan from kicking on so high, and really improves performance.
---
There is if you're insecure
---
Oh that'd be good for sure. 
---
So, it's almost like real life! (j/k)
---
If I die, I die. no big deal. I'm just interested to see what it looks like since I live ~15 minutes from it right now

You're not 'shit' but you may be a filthy casual...

[r/fo76FilthyCasuals](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/)
---
didn't down wote you since i sens a small joke here ? ;)
---
Yep, I think the mod is called targeting or something.  I have one, but I haven’t had a lot of luck with it with Scorchbeasts.  My one-two punch for SB is .50 cal or Gatling when it’s in the air, then melee on the ground with All Rise or Black Diamond.
---
Don't let other people bring you down. Everyone has their own game-style and there is nothing wrong with that. 
---
Congrats on your scorchbeast kill! 1 down, many more to come!
---
I have nothing stored.  No blueprints.  Nothing.
---
Budget says 0% stored, and I can't build a damn thing.  Just keeps saying budget exceeded.
---
I have a little facility tent outside of my house for cooking, napping and repairs. I also enjoy people coming by and using my stuff. I feel helpful lol plus my camp is in the middle of the road so everyone can see it. 
---
Glad you downed one scorchbeast and ditched the others
---
Taking a page out of the American police handbook I see!
---
The whole thing is a reference top to bottom. From the team composition to the wendigo replacing the hobgoblin, to the stabbing of the downed character. It's essentially that scene but the fallout version. 
---
(W)e need some serious help now.
---
That's a lot better than the crazy clown that's showed up at my camp twice now... He plays the drum for about an hour, then disappears...
---
I'm more upset about the pump organs they try to pass off as pianos.
---
I would think that most gamer guys, gay or straight, would simply be happy to have a BF/GF that shared an interest with them
---
I know that feeling.Three random guys just entered mine and they were waiting for me to say I have a nice c.a.m.p. after that they just left. I needed 30 minutes to undertstand the whole encounter. 
---
FYI there's a good one in glassed cavern.
---
Who you gonna call?
---
Ditto.... I went back a different time, and got chased by 40 glowing ones also. That place is hostile!
---
I wouldn’t call it cheating, I’d say they’re just using the games built in systems. Cheating is more like breaking the User agreement clauses which in this case they are not. 
---
Nah mate, that screenshot is gold.
---
I have nothing stored and budget still exceeded.  No blueprints.  Nothing.  Budget says 0% stored.  Anyone have this problem?
---
They patrol your camp and defend it, they also take up a part of the budget, bigger beast = more budget
---
You need a plan for the 50 cal receiver maybe? Or the mod itself?
---
My bf and his friends took a similar one with all 4 of them, it was fun trying to guess who was who since I couldn't see their names.
---
Shouldn't*
---
Always be happy, if someone is in the way of your happiness, screw them. 
---
My gf is exactly the opposite, she is not interested in gaming at all, she gave me the survival Guide (among other nerd stuff) and said, enoy your game properly my dear. I guess i have to marry her now
---
My first pet was a snally named Snotbutt (rip buddy) and I currently have an albino deathclaw.
---
I scrapped many rocket launchers and never got it. Maybe it's vendor exclusive?
---
Agreed, the .50 caliber is fun to use against scorchbeasts. Maybe not ammo-efficient but it sounds good.
---
Well that's weird, when my friend harvests his mutfruit i can't right after. 
---
By the by, L3 filters everything to what you can actually make, so you don't have to scroll through the lists. Pretty sure you know that, but....
---
Oh, it might only be for the pipe rifle.
---
Got to love the serums, enhance and positive effects and decrease the negative effects of the mutations. Enhance++!
---
Good on you. It's a game. If you're enjoying yourself you're playing it right. I hope to see you in the waste. 👍
---
Oh - and don't blink. Blink and you're dead.
---
I was pretty grumpy when I paid 840 caps to unlock 'wind instrument**s**' and all I got was a tuba. The 'acoustic instruments' plan unlocks 6!
---
BTW, I have a spare of both of these plans (and others) if anyone wants them, because of course I found them after I bought them.
---
Yeah, that's exactly why I asked.  They got me with Serendipity, so now I'm paranoid.
---
Try fallout 1 and 2. There some nice fanpatches that solves some bugs and also mods. For fallout 2 you should use the kilap mod. It expanses the game and does not destroy the original. 
---
Lucky! I would love to get a sloth but ive only seen two live ones my entire game, I'm in the high 70's
---
That's what I was thinking. I was unable to find the mod for it last night from a very small sample size. I also learned the 50 cal plan and deconstructed about 100 of then but only managed to learn heavy barrel. Are you able to revert other prime weapons back to their non-prime version? 
---
Glad you have got shot of those arseholes. That's a fine way to play and it's my playing style too. Congrats on the scorchbeast! 
---
Its not a PvP game though. Just because it has "optional" PvP doesnt make it so.
---
In my defense, he should not have looked so much like a bird mid flight. 
---
Found the salty ex-bf. 
---
Bethesda is actually ok with mods like this so all your doin is wasting your time friend 
---
It might just be a server hiccup. I sometimes get weird stuff like that where one of us doesn't get the fast travel option, or if I try to fast travel it will say "This person needs to be your friend or on your team." Usually a relog (or sometimes 2) fixes it. If not, my only other idea...  
---
Rarely, I've encountered a few NAT issues playing with people when two of them are on the same internet connection. Go into your PS4 network settings and see if your system is NAT 2 (I would assume his already is, but may as well check for the heck of it).  
---
Ok - call it cheesing then.  Legal cheating is what it really is.
---
That's what most of the complainers miss about fallout. It's not crash bandicoot.
---
I don't understand people who actually use Imgur as a social media. It was literally made for Reddit, to be a place to put pictures and link theme here. 
---
Rose put the 'laughter' in 'slaughter'
---
And there it is, Legal, meaning it’s not against any rules 
---
My lvl 21 deathclaw takes up exactly the same amount of space as 2 mk2 Machine gun turrets
---
Some men just want to plow the world.
---
Did it look like this monstrosity that my buddies came across?
---
https://youtu.be/D9BnIbqThCE
---
Yeah, just gently milk their brahmin.  While maintaining eye contact.
---
Accepted a random group ask the other day from two in their teens, me 75 ish. Legged the ghouls with enforcer and let them kill them. 
---
Uh...sneaking and exploring is the wrong way to play?
---
Wow.  I've played every single game with a stealth option wrong.  
---
Make a friend on the server before you launch a nuke. Then if you get disconnected, you can rejoin the same world through the friend you made. I also do this when I take a workshop. 
---
If I see a low level running around struggling to kill, I'll offer to team up and let them follow as well as making sure they have the opportunity to tag everything and we can share the legendary drops. The other day I helped some level 30 go up 8 levels to 38. It just maybe costs a couple more radaways or stims on my part whilst I'm getting hit more in ensuring they get their hits in, otherwise I'd be killing them a bit faster.
---
The weapons already exist. Use a ranged perk that has stagger/cripple effect. SB's appear to only land on clear flatish ground.
---
Thses posts telling people what should or shouldn't be, or how they should approach certain interactions, are really getting old. This is an online game, where people can play however they choose. If you don't like the way someone around you is behaving in game, switch servers, don't come to reddit to bitch about it.
---
You don't have to be mean. A simple 'no' would have sufficed. 
---
Yup - but just because its not against the rules doesn't mean you should encourage it either.
---
I’ve been using the Grafton station method for 2 days have seen the leg and arm plans loads of times but the chest plate plan hasn’t shown up in over 50 relogs can anyone confirm it shows up in this vendor ? 
---
I had the same thought as you when I saw this same question elsewhere on the sub
---
From what I got, there is a standard barrel mod you must buy/find to switch back.  Try searching this sub for the same question. There has been previous discussions and you may find the answer you need there 
---
And you are right about deconstructing and only getting heavy barrel. That’s the only kid you can discover  
---
As I understand it no, there is no standard receiver mod for the M2
---
I can’t remember, but I think I bought it at a vendor.  I got it for the next time I come across Mothman.  That ugly owl is going down. 
---
Your source? 
---
Sounds like a serious douche, good on ya for sticking up for yourself. If ya ever want a group to run with let me know, me and my friends could use a stealth ninja in the group
---
Bunker buster, you get from the quest, comes with it.  I use it on my demo expert on SB all the time.
---
I’m not encouraging it, but one shouldn’t give another crap for doing something that isn’t against the rules 
---
I can't imagine playing one of the 3D Fallouts and blitzing through it. Genuinely most of the appeal to me is finding all the hidden shit, even though it is a slow grind.
---
Good job, I'm a level 57 and have yet to kill one. Anytime I see one I hide and wait for it to go away or I log out and log back in. I hate those things almost as much as mole rats.
---
We’ve got everrrything, minus loose screws and springs, you can get everything Youuuu Neeeed!
---
That's a great shot.
---
&gt; Snotbutt
---
EW!
---
I think we can all agree that Beth is kinda incompetent in regards to their own game
---
Orbital strike it ;) 
---
More like the lack thereof. 
---
Thank you for your response. I will try to search again :)
---
Same here, I only saw 1 before, and he was glitched out in a nuke zone.  There's a random spawn point in the far northeast corner of the map.  You'll see a pond with a downed vertibird in the middle of it.  This is where he spawned for me.  I've been checking that spot for probably the past 2 weeks, he was the first thing I was able to tame.
---
Same; move when the mood strikes and mostly to the Savage Divide. Mostly for me, because I like to RP alot, I will move to places that make sense to me character. For a while, on my BOS ranger type, I was posted outside of Huntersville because I had to keep an eye on those muties. Stuff like that.
---
Yes it is a pvp game. The option exists to attack other players anywhere in the world, that makes the *entire* game pvp.
---
I don't even take part in pvp myself, but sometimes it's unavoidable, and expecting that to change is wishful thinking.
---
Don't listen to those shithead exes of yours. We're cutting out toxic people in 2019!!!!
---
Weird, the deathclaw just ran away from me until I “befriended” it. 
---
In my opinion, it's *very very very hard* to be shit at gaming. Everyone processes things differently and does them at different paces. 
---
Congrats on the SB kill. Finally killing one and knowing that you can effectively do so pretty much opens the entire map up to you, and changes the way you play. I stayed away from the eastern part of the map for so long because of it and I feel like the game opened up to me immensely once I was able to kill them. 
---
You play how you want; it's your money, your experience and your time. Hell, if you want to spend your time farming crops and building a nice farm CAMP and don't even play the quests, that's your choice, not anyone else's. How they acted like that and treated you like that just boggles my mind, and is probably indicative of other issues they have or had, but that's not our place to get into those topics and discussions.
---
Good for you for getting away from that toxicity. Someone much better and more understanding will come along I'm sure of it. I try to get my wife into it but her extent of gaming was the Sims lol. She enjoyed the PSVR when I let her try it, so I hope that we can maybe play that together and get a hobby going together.
---
See you out in the wasteland!
---
Seriously? You don't need to be partied and have someone or yourself leave game and re-enter? Just going on the boundary and going across and out and repeating a couple of times will glitch it to have no rads?
---
Is that rare? I left one on a corpse the other day... rip?
---
If it was set to 0 caps that means he manually set it to 0 caps. Since he changed it quickly, it was most likely an accident 
---
I had found a duper that was not taking any damage either, I went back for revenge a couple of times and landed a couple of good hits with my double shot explosive shotgun but he was just not dying while he could just 1 or 2 shot me with his.
---
I am afraid I don’t speak Wodka, sorry :(
---
Yeah pets have to spawn in a random encounter, and thank you for confirming a sloth can spawn at that spot that's the one ive been farming. Got my snally, radtoad and deathclaw all from that spot.
---
That's funny, I'm a melee build and have no issue with weight or killing scorchbeasts.
---
such smol bed
---
Hmm, I lost it then. 
---
try unequiping class freak and starched genes log out, then log back in again, i find this usually works when my mutations go all buggy
---
Add me RecKLEsS_InTeNT
---
Thanks! I relogged 3 times and that fixed it, in case anyone runs into this in future :)
---
I paid $60 for this game, think I earned it already.
---
Ok will do
---
Hahaha.
---
I don't have a fix, I'm just laughing at your misfortune.
---
Thats how player vending is. Every game is like that. ESO for example only has a few traders here and there worth visiting, most player traders are rubbish. Was like that in old school UO as well.
---
If only a would meet a gamer girl in my whole life...
---
This would be awesome, could even be temporary forcing you to die and when you respawn into the simulation we're all in, you go back to normal
---
Good on ya, is your ingame name baleia by any chance?
---
Budget does not increase by level. It increases or decreases depending on location. If you're in a big wide open field you'll have a larger budget. If you in a gorge or a cave, it will be smaller. 
---
For those that think I'm wrong, max your budget at 100% then move your camp. It wont say 100% stored. It will be more or less depending on where you moved meaning your budget decreased or increased based on location only. 
---
If you have the VATS perk that let's you target body parts just aim for their heads. They can take a few rounds to the body, but one headshot usually does them in. 
---
Where did you find that?
---
In a sense Fallout 76 is itself just a duped Fallout 4.
---
Perhaps right now they're taking it slow so that when vaults come out and we get far better weapons and armor - they might have it fully fixed by then, so that duping weapons that actually matter won't be possible.
---
It's like, sure the dupers can have their fun now, but it won't mean shit soon enough. It still shouldn't be happening, though.
---
However, this is Bethesda 2019. They probably aren't thinking like that.
---
Agreed - hopefully the next patch will resolve via the new PVP mode.
---
I'm here still waiting on a bloody excavator power armor paint job. Give us guys some love Bethesda :(
---
The Hot Rod power armor station is also there for 700 Atoms. Does anyone know if it includes both styles of station or just the large one?
---
Brother I agree whole heartedly. Farming for that WoW baggage space for days but well worth it. Also give up some new 2 do 
---
I'm level 40 and I still haven't killed a Scorchbeast, I just run and hide. Nice work.
---
Vault 76 opened in 2102 and the Institute isn't even founded until 2110:
---
 The Institute was born from the Commonwealth Institute of Technology, or CIT, a renowned university based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. [Robert House](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Robert_House) attended it in his youth.[\[1\]](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/The_Institute#cite_note-FB0-0) During the [Great War](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Great_War), a number of CIT personnel survived by taking refuge in the underground level of the campus. In [2110](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline#2110), the survivors and their descendants founded the Institute, an organization dedicated to furthering pre-War science. 
---
Hi there, I can shere my white knight perk card with you 😎
---
I play exactly the way you desribed, chems are the things I sell first to the vendors, I always sneak my way everywhere, successfull sneak infiltration is always more satisfying than running in, sneak melee is especially hard to pull and just the most awesome thing when you do it.
---
Don't listen to haters girl, keep up playing and having fun, because that is what matters!
---
And congrats to your first kill!
---
SCP meets Fallout 
---
Do you have the pharmacy perk equipped?
---
The Institute wasn’t founded until 2110. 
---
Vault 76 opened 2102. 
---
We still have several years before the Institute was even a thought. G1s don’t have an origin date but started in the early years. 
---
I've not been seeing that luckily but that's so shitty because the X-01 TSE handmade crew aren't exactly the white knights.
---
It's like this is a US college drama and they are the football team or something. Some people are just shitty.
---
So where was this found?
---
The blast was so strong , it pushed your spine out of your body 😱
---
I actually use a 2 door system the front door is unlocked the 2nd door is a metal door with a lock 
---
the first room has all the crafting benches a bed a instrument ect the back room though is a indoor garden and water purification area lets me be helpful to new people and I even have the metal screen door so they can see inside and get ideas but keeps my food supplies safe 
---
Yea, Grahm isn’t reliable at all. Even if you can find someone who is holding him. I still haven’t heard anyone seeing the plans on Grahm that was over level 20. 
---
And that price is without CHR perks. I think you can get the cost down to 594 with CHR perks, and even less if you have alcohol and grape mentats. 
---
I’m just saying for a level 16 alt it’s hard to get any  caps reducing perks. 
---
It seems pets seeing you as hostile turns the whole base against who ever is seeing the pet as hostile and pets are always hostile so.... Perfect defense system if you ask me
---
This post was boring as fuck. Why did someone give this gold? The thirst out here is unimaginable.
---
This hit me in the feels, I'm not a great fighter either but killing my first scorch beast was an awesome feeling,  also glad your ignoring your ex's opinions they sound like knobs
---
It's all about money. These "limited" time offers are psychological manipulation tactics to get the sheep(simple minded follower type people) to bust out that credit card. This very tactic is in all your f2p phone/tablet games. 
---
I'm a guy and I play Fallout exactly the way you do.
---
Whoa what what? Up voting for visibility because apparently folks taking advantage of this are down voting.
---
Your millage may vary, i'm sure there are other ways to do it you may want to look for more info.

I have "lag" glitches like that all the time, I can wear the "Eye of RA" quest necklace on my cowboy costume or Civil war dress etc when you are supposed to be only able to wear it with the matching Dress depending on the server.

Your house doesn't happen to have a siren on it, does it?

I think that’s where the people from Yahoo groups ended up

everyone on twitter thats who..... why I don't have a twitter account and have free time to play games lols

---
The armor i made was yellow and black...
---
I'm sorry I thought you were being sarcastic.
---
Thanks for this, I noticed this happening to me a lot when doing simple things like accessing my stash.
---
Someone explained that it is just another clue about how much they copied from FO4. The Radrats were added in Nuka World, which is an area where the player needs to be a high level. Therefor, they made even the simple rats in that area high health to balance it out against the high levelled players. Copy that to this game, but place them in areas where the player isn't overpowered and you run into balancing issues
---
"your"
---
That's great! I'm kinda jelly now since I'm level 37 and server hop whenever I get attacked by one, whenever I don't I just waste a bunch of ammo and stims and eventually die so yeah; hate these things' guts :D
---
generally people who randomly call people shit players are pretty terrible and are afraid the other person will realize it - I mean think of the smack talk level in games 90% noobs then veterans just shoot you in the face and walk off after taking your springs
---
No it's on a rock face, you can drop in or go through side. Going to find it today.
---
They are the *worst* neighbors. I mean, really. I can never have a decent block party with those goons around.
---
Bunch of great people just playing the game and helping out.
---
Level 34 and killed a scorchbeast? Sounds like you're doing pretty good to me... *****Illegitimi non carborundum*
---
Yup just made another piece and i get the prototype paint and the silver... Spoiler....
---
You could.  I kind of like leaving it for the next guy. 
---
Just last night I was up farming acid at one of the workshops.  When I was done I left turrets and extractors as a nice surprise for anyone who wandered past. 
---
But I'm also constantly trying to find ways to dump all my junk. My trunk is full of junk
---
I play literally the exact same way lol. I'm only level 25 and I couldn't imagine killing a scorched beast 😲
---
Don't need to make chest pieces to learn chest mods. Arms can teach mods for the whole set and are cheaper to make. 
---
You just described my exact play style lol
---
Hopefully you got at least one shot in.
---
You should be able to just build the generator, and one power pole and hook it up. Then they can hook wires from that pole to whatever they need, as long as they don't move camps or store the generator.
---
Guy here, I play exactly as you describe.  Some people are just shit. Enjoy your time in 76.
---
enjoy the game is the reason to play a game so if your enjoying it you can't really be bad at it 
---
now you might not be great at some mechanics in the game (I'm bad at dodging thus power armor) you just keep enjoying it then I call it a win
---
also they should just been happy to have someone thy could sit and play the game with and relax with instead of who is better 
---
I've seen this. However they are just mannequins placed in an odd place. Who knows why, maybe a bored robot or something. But they are not synths, nor are synths around at that point.

I totally agree the amount of two shot explosive weapons players have is insane I had to get one just so the PvP is more even I really use it any other time unless I really have to I paid 1000 caps for it and I'm 70% sure it was duped ill happily let the devs take it away or ill drop it if they take all duped guns away from people I think they need to make it so explosive and 2 shot can't be on the same weapon or take explosive out all together?
---
X-01 armor comes out yellow black but you can strip it back to silver.
---
Hey how about you answer the question instead of being a douche 
---
Could not agree more. Make it a quest reward or series of quest rewards. 
---
I feel this game needs more things for us to earn. I would love it if several of our QOL wishes were implemented as some sort of quest based reward. Would like more to work towards to. 
---
Bethesda doesn't give a fuck. Don't expect any major overhaul of this game. They are gonna squeeze every dollar they can from the atom store and then bail. 
---
Original ps4 or pro? Thats insane. 
---
I don't give them crap either - it's the high level players encouraging this behavior that I find appalling.  Maybe its just misguided and they're trying to help them out - but helping others cheese a game is akin to passing around exam cheat sheets.
---
I would have thought that was common knowledge by now lol. Some people have to say something... just anything lmao.
---
You have the option to fly a helicopter in battlefield, that doesn't make it a flight simulator
---
Every time I try to get closer I just get too close and die :( lol
---
Only did away shots so far. 
---
Just saying you are shit at gaming is a dick move. Instead those guys should have explained certain things like game mechanics, how you can improve your peronal playstyle (i guess you are a stealth player, with the right build and equip, this playstyle is very powerful) and be more cheerful when it comes to playing together. Beeing permantly told you suck only encouraging you to drop the game and gaming all together. Everyone can improve with a little bit of help, beeing it with help of friends, tutorials or just learning by doing. Get some friends who doesn´t take everything serious and avoid asshole like you mentioned. 
---
Sorry about the downvotes; I’m glad someone went there. 
---
should shot up as friendly till you attack the camp 
---
I'm sure they got you covered with purchasable expansions from the atomic shop for 600 atoms each. /s
---
Though I do agree it could be interesting and fun, if they get it right.
---
Some guys are assholes that think gaming should be a male exclusive hobby. Don't worry though, there's plenty of chill folk out there that would love to have a gaming girlfriend. 
---
One of my requirements for getting married was to find a woman who enjoys video games at least nearly as much as I do. I got lucky and found a great one that loves gaming twelve years ago. We just exhausted FO76 playing it co-op the entire way through. 
---
Go find a guy *with a brain* that loves gaming, he'll love the fact that you do it and you'll spend a happy life together fucking shit up digitally. 
---
There is going to be a big patch this month. A start on the pipeline. 
---
Great! Glad it wasn't a NAT issue because those can be a pain. I guess it's like the good old "turn it off and turn it back on" troubleshooting, lol. Can't see your teammate? Relog. Can't fast travel? Relog. Can't see their quests? Relog. Relog doesn't work? Keep relogging, haha
---
Don't, you have to run up and "make friends" with it for the mission. Whether you survive that interaction or not depends on you level and dmg resistance.
---
Three weeks level 34 that's a yikes
---
I play the EXACT. SAME. WAY. Only level 32, just now exploring Charleston, still rocking level 15 weapons and armor.  No rush.
---
Lol seriously. I see a lot of people saying what kind of build their character is and I'm just over here like... I'm a scavenger? 
---
Jerks killed my Mirelurk Hunter and it never respawned :(
---
...brotha Ben
---
I wish, it wasn’t quite that bad. That would have been so satisfying to mini nuke. 
---
The mod "Better Inventory" will give you a breakdown by each tab, it helps to figure out where your weight problems are. 
---
Nice necro, this was 2 months ago, lmao.
---
That was like finding a piece of poop in my coffee, and I don't have any more left to brew a fresh pot.
---
😢
---
That's exactly how I play these games. They were asses. Enjoy it however you want to enjoy it and take every victory you can get.
---
Side note: I'm almost level 40 and I haven't killed a scorchbeast yet lmao. I have to go to Wendigo Cave for a quest but I've been delaying it because I'm so scared of the Wendigos.
---
I'm guessing the perk that increases damage every hit and also one that gives high crit. 
---
I'm going back to the drawing board after seeing this. 
---
Yeah and grinding gold for more bank slots hehe. I was a tailor and made my own bags and gave bags to low levels. It was nice that it would also say "Made by Character Name" so you would remember the people who made stuff and gave it to you. Somebody did that with me when I started playing so I returned the favor. After years and forgetting the persons name, and they probably forgot me, at least I could remember who it was that helped me in my first hours of the game.
---
I got the heavy leather armor and its great as a hand out to new people its basically as much armor as a full set of lvl 5 standard leathers you can actually make several items like tire irons and combat knifes pretty easy as well and not only help people out but also get those crafting rewards for atoms so help others help yourself 
---
Oh, shit.  OP's about to go John Wick some fools today...
---
Does it count as an exploit like that?
---
Maybe if that camp owner gets reported. That just doesn’t seem right. 
---
as brotherhood I just assumed you would shoot them for mutations
---
Ha, I play the exact same way. Always forget to use my chems, always collecting everything not bolted down, always exploring and almost always in sneak. Rock on and congrats.
---
I'm going to get downvoted but I find this pretty cringeworthy. Looking for validation on a gaming forum by strangers because you have exs who are assholes is very weird.
---
It's cool. You shoot my Jeff, you are same good as dead and now you lost your junk. Sadly tho, junk loses it value after level 70 or so. 
---
I had a tailor at one point. Had 2 spam bags 2 get lvls then ill trade them for free 2 lvl 1's 
---
I was looking it up and your comment made me upset 
---
I cri
---
Why do you even bother to comment here? Based on your comment history, you bought the game and think it's shit. Which is fair you are entitled to your opinion.
---
But why the hell ruin everyone else's good time???
---
Please find something else to do. Thanks.
---
Orrrrrr even better, find a perfect vantage point overlooking that one asshole that murdered you when you just got done fighting a scorch beast... So you watch while he's walking around, then you see him stop, and open up on him with a hail of grenades and gunfire and murder him back.
---
Could be the Tricentennial paint, I’ve heard it has a very similar look to Enclave style. I don’t have it and haven’t seen it, so I couldn’t say for sure, but I’ve seen other posts about “Enclave X-01” that turned out to be the Tricentennial. 
---
What platform and is your character single?
---
This guy gets it
---
I am level 135 and one shot any enemy aside from scorchbeast and queen. I have done most of the quest and the only endgame is farming nuke zones, which is terribly boring. I already have the best weapons in the game and the game doesnt offer anything further of value.
---
Ps4, perhaps?
---
Mine is at devil's backbone too, it's not a bad camp location while questing and hitting up vendors
---
I'll bet both those ex-boyfriends are dupers. ;-)
---
Seriously, though, good on you. You're better off without either of those chuckleheads.
---
probably saw the tricentennial paint job
---
New desktop background.
---
if you need heavy armor pieces the hunting/armor salesman at the whitespring sells a random heavy combat armor item 99% of the time.
---
server hop a couple times and you got a full set
---
This guy was a level 16. Best part is they get a bounty for shooting a pet. Killed the cunt 5 or 6 times before he left the server.
---
I play the game like this aswell!  
---
Hey, i recently finished that mission. Don't be scared of the wendigos (it's gonna be ok), but that place is scary. If you want some help with it (and play on PC) i'll happily help. 
---
such a wholesome sub
---
Some of the game terms fully describes me - junk collector, pack rat - but the limits on what you can keep has taught me how to throw things away.  Oh the horrors!
---
Here's another

---
No, that would be actual flight... I don't really see the association here
---
Explain how one gets into my building within minutes of me sitting down.   It wasnt there before!
---
After getting blue-screened five mins after launching a nuke I am all for an option to rejoin last server. It’s the least they can do with how unstable it is.
---
"Are there ghouls?" he asked, are there ghouls. Jeez, are there ghouls.
---
I have as a girl an odd style too. Im not the sniper kind of player but more the I'm just gonna smash and die alot kind of gal. But melee build is actually a great thing in fallout 76 as I go quickly through those bullets anyway. Playing games is about having a great time. I rather have an odd style than be one of those dudes who is level 124 and constantly complains how he hates this game
---
Nah. Anything in its underwear, we don’t toy with. If they’re that crazy, they’re crazy enough to eat my booty through my power armor. 
---
Selling?
---
I so need power doors
---
Are you charging anything for it?
---
Just have a look through the comments I've left in this thread. I've copy/pasted it to about eight people. Look for the word "bunch." 
---
You are a good man
---
I'm of the opinion Whitespring should be a fixed mid-level (meaning about level 15 to level 30) location that doesn't scale higher for max-level players.  I feel that way because of that damned golfer ghoul quest that requires you to kill 10 that are never around because high-level players always overwrite the encounter levels.
---
Nuking could probably still overwrite the encounter levels, but it really shouldn't be THE end-game zone, since other areas should be desireable too.
---
They respawn. I have a pet deathclaw that died multiple times but always respawns
---
How many atoms is the new PA pair?  PA paints are the only thing I buy in the ATOM shop.  Is it the Hot Rod paint job?  Is it for all PAs?
---
They give you good money! Especially in the older games 
---
Will do thanks
---
K, reduces duping but does nothing to address the broken balancing. 
---
I miss the toy car gun from 3, you could cripple the legs and run like hell lmao
---
Their respawning is patchy at best. My snally respawned the first time he died but not the second, my radtoad never respawned and my deathclaw hasnt died yet.
---
you sure it wasn't the blackbird paintjob that was limited edition/time in the atomic shop?
---

---
I'm sure you know but I'm asking just in case, do you have a weapon out?
---
chameleon doesn't work if you've stowed/holstered your weapon 
---
That's pretty much how my wife is lol she doesn't knock me for gaming, but she knows my passion for it and goes out of her way to get things she knows I will like based on games I play. Fallout travelling mug , FFVII lanyard for my keys i'm always misplacing, and the playstation button (square, X, O, triangle) LED lights for Xmas. I was more than satisfied.
---
I won't tell her that the FFVII lanyard she got has cloud from FFVII : Advent Children and for some odd reason also has Lightning from FFXIII lol she gets an A+ for effort in my book.
---
and yes, yes you do have to marry your GF. It's pretty much written in stone now, friend.
---
Or a player can find their own but yes
---
That’s weird, maybe try to get another mutation and see if that fixes it. 
---
Yeah, if this game is to succeed long term, which I genuinely hope it will, Bethesda really need to get better at communicating, fixing actual issues with the patches, and most importantly on this topic, take a stance on exploiters. If cheating is all good and nobody gives a damn, fine with me, I'll simply move on. Ideally I'd see them do a reset/find *some* way to get rid of all the garbage that went from being super rare to making everyone OP, but if they introduce KoS PvP servers and player markets without addressing this first, that'll be the last nail in the coffin.
---
Wasteland whisperer doesn’t work just animal friend. I tamed my deathclaw with animal friend in 30 min but tried for hours with wasteland but got nothing.
---
Nah man, FO4 was released 2015 ;)
---
Put out your weapon and stay still.
---
Last three nuke runs I did: Blue-screened in the silo; blue-screened in the silo; launched the nuke and blue-screened five mins later in the nuke zone. This is a joke.
---
If you're on Chrome you can right click the page and click translate. The wonders of technology.
---
I’m guessing you are also taking advantage of Ammo Smith and Super Duper perks?
---
I hear one of the best ways to get lead is hop in your Excavator armor and hit Lucky Hole Mine.
---
I haven’t needed to worry too much about ammo as I use a Gauss as my main. And while the ammo is heavy, the gun is powerful and only takes Lead/Steel to craft. 
---
Some people will always cheat. Its on the developer to fix exploits. I don't know how you aren't aware of this. 
---
Right because Bethesda will definitely do something about it. 
---
You just slide off
---
There’s an even called “messenger” where a mr gutsy tells you he needs you’re help to deliver a message, he’s broken down and you got to fix his engines. Once you do that he needs your protection to get to his location. He brings you to an old house (many different outcomes because this event comes up nearly anywhere) knocks on the door and informs “the residence” of their prize or what ever .... it’s very funny to see the robot that is only coded to give these messages, desperately want to get to an old run down shack with skeletons laying on the porch, just to realize “no one’s home” 
---
You can get a hot rod themed power armor station for 700 and the "Hotter rod" PA paint for 1400. Its for all suits except Excavator. (45, 51, 60, x01). Forgot to add in OP but its limited to 1 day
---
you should upgrade your power armor to the spiked seat version solves those problems 
---
how did he disappear? Did you kill him and then he sought revenge on you?
---
It’s not just you. There no loot options and then there just ammo drops or random trash armor - but no plans or flux or anything else. It’s common and Bethesda doesn’t care. 
---
It’s just end game content after all, why bother making sure it works when they can spend more time pumping out new armor paints? 
---
I’m lvl 40 still can’t kill a scorchbeast so you’re better than me at gaming
---
Taser attachment for harpoon gun.
---
Git on it please, Bethesda! 
---
Are you kidding me lvl 56 and have never killed one. I can only clap for this accomplishment I have not done yet
---
Fuck the haters, enjoy games your way. I have numerous female friends that game and not all of them are good. Some are. I'm not necessarily good as a dude gamer, but I have fun. That's all it should be about.
---
Don’t date someone who tells you what to do. 
---
Probably other reasons that she doesn’t want to disclose 
---
yes and if you're interested in more "team efficient effects" bring a cryolator too, slows the queen down big time.
---
If you killed one at level 34 I'd say you're doing fine.
---
Yes. No addictol can save us from this. 
---
Now I can't sell them to collectors for 2k that see this!
---
Basically 
---
I’ve seen Barn Doors but can’t say I’ve ever noticed the Barn itself. Is this a popular plan?
---
It's becoming a very popular spot, /sadpanda. During my last 7 hour masochistic xo1 calibrated shocks server hopping search, half of the time my camp needed to be relocated because some squatter took that spot. It's a great C.A.M.P. location with the best view of prime fissure when it gets nuked.
---
Very much so.  Three of the most common types of complaints are bugs, QoL requests, and content.  A few more things like this would at least go a little ways towards addressing two of the three. It'd be no substitute for real, meaty content but it's always nice to have something to dink away at.
---
Thank, they are back as of now. 
---
Ayegurl! That's how I like to play too but I'm a dude. Play however you want, that's one of the great aspects of a Fallout game. This map is pretty big and awesome and exploring it is a lot of the fun.   
---
Exactly. Versacemustang. Xbox
---
"In video games, an exploit is the use of a bug or glitches, game system, rates, hit boxes, speed or level design etc. by a player to their advantage in a manner not intended by the game's designers."
---
Building with methods that aren't made to be in the game = exploiting. Like purifiers on camp fires, furniture on rugs and stacking stairs on stairs etc.
---
killing any scorchbeast at lvl 34 is commendable, you are definitely not shit
---
My point is that the current drop system for legendaries is nowhere near reliable enough for a permanent breakage system to work.  There would need to be some method to either craft or farm specific legendary weapons and armor.
---
As I read your story I realized how much I shared it. Although I don't have another to criticize me, my squad isn't happy with my stealth play since they like to run in and often die. I can take scorch beasts out over 40min, but never get hit once. Nice to see more people like this out here.
---
P. S what system u play on? 
---
Had that problem yesterday for the first time. Even though I dropped/consumed enough i still couldn't fast travel. I exited my power armor then reentered which seemed to fix it
---
Wow I didn’t know you can build there, isn’t it a marked location? Love the overall shape of the structure and especially the windmill =D Great use of different wall types to create variety! 
---
I've got an explosive flamer that still shoots fire in addition to the explosive "pellet"
---
Fuck them you do you 
---
That is a pretty cool location, do you have any issues fast travelling there?
---
Have you beaten the holotape games? I've done Grognak and Wastelad so far.
---
Ok mate thanks ive given it a week just because i prefer to do main missions over all rather than side but thanks a lot
---
I see this sentiment posted quite a bit, but never understood it. Crickets have been one of the easiest creatures for me to dispatch since I started encountering them.
---
Wtf is wrong w you ?
---
Well done on taking out your first scorchy!
---
I like to sneak around and snipe too, and if you do that in vats who cares?
---
Keep enjoying the game and don't let a couple of guys own insecurities get you down. Gaming is about enjoying the journey.
---
Typically, the use of the word cringe-worthy combined with a negative opinion warrants someone else finding your opinion cringe-worthy.
---
Not my opinion personally,
---
Just saying. 
---
Good work, bud!
---
I find it kind of odd the ex felt like you didn't "have time" to play, yet they seem to have it themselves.  Or at least that's implied by the way he was critical of your play.
---
I find that funny.  Good work with the Scorch Beast.  I haven't taken one down yet, but just got to level 40 last night.  Maybe it's time to dance....
---
There's a town in the mire that requires you to climb up though a couple caves to get in to. You can see it from a distance. It's in one of the caves. 
---
The place is good for pictures. 
---
Lol Fr! The responses are cringe worthy. Baby girl, add me if you play x. Don’t be scared.
---
I wish I had a boyfriend that played fallout 76.  Oh well.  Grats on the kill though lol
---
Vault man there’s no need to feel down. I said vault man raid that sack on the ground. You can sprint as long as AP don’t run out. Use your pipe pistol kill Eyebots!
---
Really, who cares how you play a game? It's about you enjoying it however you want. Screw everyone else.
---
Add Codmuff on Xbox one if you play. I have a vendor character who can give you a free legendary weapon. And we can join those ex bfs of yours and I’ll destroy their base. I encourage my girlfriend to play! I don’t care if she can’t move and shoot at the same time! Shame on them! Congrats on the scorch beast 
---
Fucking Thankyou. Waiting for this.
---
All these white knights bruuuuuh
---
Nice, thanks! Sad that it didnt work with the plasma gatling :/
---
Is the flamer range high enough? Explosive flamer sounds like suicide :D
---
Everybody ICBM Tonight. 
---
Everybody Wang Chung Tonight.
---
Some guys are extremely competitive so they rather shit on their other half to feel better
---
Honestly everyone plays at their own pace and playstyle.   Don't ever let anyone else dictate how you have fun in a game.   Some people love to do bleeding edge content but there are usually more who just like to relax and play casually at their own pace. 
---
So many gamers forget that especially MMO players that the majority of players are fairly casual and are not spending 3+ hours every day gaming.  Just because someone has a different playstyle does not mean they are not enjoying the game. 
---
People are embarrassing 
---
That's the best feeling, killing that first scorched beast that keeps killing you over and over. Now the shoe is on the other foot. Good job and the way you play games is fine just because the game was made so you would have fun and that's what your doing then there isn't anything wrong!
---
That's how I play literally any game with stealth in it
---
Thats how i play
---
Yeah bro, you guessed it. Smh
---
Yeah Xbox. I was using traffic lights mounted on a wall as stage lighting. I wanted to use the light panels but they just take up way too much camp budget =(
---
I played WOW hardcore from launch until about 2012.  Haven’t touched it since. 
---
A buddy of mine started playing and someone gave him some bags. He sent me a picture and the mageweave bags were made by my original priest tailor. 
---
That was pretty cool seeing my bags survive 13 ish years. 
---
I’m also on PC.

---
Good question.  I'm specced for shotguns and got the thing as part of a trade so i really couldn't tell you.  Need to do a heavy energy build once i get a new mouse.
---
Gratz on killing the Scorchbeast :D Regardless on its level they are still hard to kill. So its no small feat to kill one by yourself.
---
Sorry to hear you had to deal with such shitty dudes
---
I see way more very low level characters wanted than higher level ones. I think maybe some newer players may not understand all the actions that can get you 'wanted' and do so unintentionally. 
---
If they follow you around and keep attacking that's one thing. Then by all means, light them up.
---
Damn nice ^^ 
---
I'm not sure if I got that one or not, but I've been in there I think. That was the ultracite armor reward location, right?
---
Really? Even the biocommesh and dense ones? I didn't know that!
---
I'd enjoy knowing where the fuck a person even gets the Tuba.
---
Found a string instrument plan but no tuba.
---
Never stop being you. Play the way you want! That’s the awesome thing about this game, there’s something for every style. I’m a woman in my 40’s and only in the past few years have I gotten into gaming. By my own definition, I’m terrible at it but I have fun and it’s so relaxing.  I’ve been playing since beta and I just hit level 22 and it’s fine. 
---
Damn I didn’t kill my first scorchbeast until level 60!
---
I tried reentering and even restarting the game and it did not resolve it lol. I’m hoping they Hot-Fix it soon. 
---
Accurate ^
---
I picked one up the other day, but it was just "junk"

Occasionally, if I'm travelling from farther away... in that case I usually just fast travel again from Hornwright Industrial Headquarters and that tends to fix it.
---
This is exactly what my perspective on perk cards was. If they wanted to keep it skinny, they could even make it to where you could choose 1 or 2 of the SPECIAL stats to 'specialize' in and give those categories free passive slots that don't detract from the category overall.
---
I mean, I feel like this post is going to have the opposite effect. A lot of trolls are just gonna be looking for pets to kill at camps.
---
Well, this explains A LOT!
---
I still haven't killed a scorchbeast :(
---
What the fuck does Tetris have to do with anything? Your replies make zero sense. 
---
yes. on the right of screenshot, you can see that perk doesn't have any lock, so it's equipped
---
Nothing in the Atom store is needed to play the game. And since you can get atoms for free playing the game I don’t see a problem with the prices. 
---
I have just over 4000 atoms saved up just from doing normal in game quests/challenges.  Never spent a penny of real money. 
---
Not sure why people keep bitching about ATOM Shop prices.....
---
my goal is to hide the passwords of blocked computers, surely some say something about the zetan, especially the man who is taken to discover something about the subject

Nope. Tried it several time. Stuck with the purifier overcapping my budget.

I have a female friend who's 40 lvls above me and she's playing rough and loud. Carrying Fat Mans and Missile Launchers to support from afar. Now I feel like the stereotypical gamer girl cause I spend my time making my camp look like a proper home.
---
Lol hey, thanks for the offer! I do play on PC. 
---
How about I try  going it my own, and if I have a hard time I'll call you over for backup.

do you have any stored items?  how many turrets do you have?

I started playing video games MsDos was barely a thing. You think you know better but you don't. Peoples like me aren't why Fallout 76 was buggy at release. This is not how things works. And the problem with gamers is that they take those things to serious. It's just a video game for god sake. If you're willing to pay even though there's tons of review saying it's a shitty game then it's you choice. Don't come shitting on the game after.
---
This game has a lot of good quality produce content and it's pretty much like most of the newly released Bethesda games. Skyrim was super buggy to. Getting killed by flying cabbage was a thing (and probably still is). And don't tell me putting a bucket on a shop keeper head to be able to loot his store is brilliant right?
---
Plus it's the first Bethesda online game. So of course there's going to be problems. They're creating brand new software which they've never handled before. Bethesda was always about single player. If you'd expected something different then it's you that don't get it.
---
My big yellow ass sneaking around in power armor. I sneak everywhere. 
---
Tbh, your ex-boyfriends sound quite the immature and laddish type. So good riddance!

I play this game like you as well. I think I was lvl 50 before I even reached Watonga. 
---
Cheers.

What a fancy pair of containment breeches.

OH MY GOD!  Best REDDIT chain ever!

I'm fine, my lone wanderer is so lone.... so lone.

Their puny minds can go play Fortnite. I play similarly all solo. I allow the squirreling to take over everything in Fallout games. I love the details you find at each staged scene.
---
Keep on doing what you do.
---
Clearly they weren’t good boyfriends then because they shouldn’t put you down! I do the same thing in my game and I have so much fun :) 
---
Same. The only thing I don't like about that one is how fast it produces. You have to check it every 5 ish minutes else it stops producing. But if you're hanging around the camp it's really good to snag every time you walk past haha. 
---
Xboxonemasterrace? We on xbox, providing players from previous server are not "offline", can just join people from our recent players list. Write down a few high level character names right before choosing your nuke site so you can try and rejoin.

The easiest solution is raising level cap (AFTER DUPING IS FIXED). I wouldn’t buy a level 45/50 TSE if a level 55/60 is able to be looted. 
---
One of the three big ones: West tek (i doubt that one though), RobCo or General Atomics.
---
Oh scratch that, Affinity Tag. Tag one special stat to make all 'passive' (non-combat) perks cost -1. Solved.
---
That's a good point
---
RUN! You don't run you stand your ground! A hard fight indeed. There I was trying to open a safe in the gift shop.(I hear a grunt) then i ghoul throws itself at me 20 levels more but I take it down. Man that was close then two come through door. As I take another on down three more poop up. At this point I'm like🙎🏼‍♂️🙅🏼‍♂️🙆🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️I'm doomed. At this point half the room is filled with these damned monsters. 
---
So now I equip my Grenades and start throwing them in to the groups hoping to take some down but more poop up and I'm like I have to start attacking one by one. I'm behind a counter with no escape so my only chance it attacking after 30mins+ I get down to the last 5 and someone helps me. Thank the gods!
---
Low health with only one stim I didn't think i'd make it but I did. Overencumbered hardly able to move. I pop a  Psychobuff and fast travel home to my camp. Drained and beat I make myself to the bed and go to sleep tomorrow is another day.
---
Add Savage_thirst for a good time :)
---
Great Scott, I doesn’t have that kinda caps! It’s all good, I’ll just have to tough it out and find one meself 😩
---
I like the enthusiasm, but I've been managing my 400 pound, and now 600 pound limit since the beta. I want more quests, but not for something I should have had all along. 
---
The issue isn't your gaming styles or skills. The issue is their attitude. 
---
Absolutely this ^^
---
This I agree. I think there should be a way to craft legendaries even if that means series perk investments and 15 in two specials
---
The explosive version of the Tesla rifle is currently this way. Instead of shooting it’s Arcing electricity it shoots a single explosive shot. 
---
I'm a level 44 stealth dood and I still can't kill a Scorchbeast. Where do you find level 40s? Lowest I've seen is level 50. :(
---
This might not come as a surprise to you, but your ex-boyfriends are assholes.  
---
  
---
Good luck running into a good boyfriend!
---
Prospector hat may be what you are looking for
---
Phallic 👍
---
I'm actually very curious to see where it goes from there because I'm confused and interested by their comment at the same time.
---
I'd be happy to meet a complete stranger with my interests. 😑
---
Or more importantly, acknowledge that there’s a good chance that they’re small minded fools. We’re far better off recognising that people are often just wrong 
---
Ahh.. didn't see that.  Thanks.   Still, some of those colors.. woof.
---
You sound like the way I like to play. I take my time, I explore, I read everything and listen to every holotape. Why rush? Why deprive myself of content by blasting through it as fast as possible? Savor it, be mindful of the experience, be truly *present* in the experience and enjoy it. They sound like assholes. You do you.
---
Someone said it's a bug.
---
Someone said try take the perk card off, log off, log on, put perk card back on and try again.
---
Кто-то сказал, что это ошибка.
---
Кто-то сказал, попробуйте вынуть перк-карту, выйти из системы, войти в систему, снова установить перк-карту и повторить попытку.

---
In this game its the gunfight mechanics that is shut. Not your skills. 
---
But apparently these two weren't good at Fallout. Never snuck around, didn't collect all the stuff, relied on chems, etc.
---
Create your maximum of 5 players and help friends move 25k caps onto those other accounts so you have ‘bank accounts’ for your main account. Move your camp to different locations and rebuild the style. Get more plans so that you can build more stuff. Get all armor, weapon, and power armor mods. Find rare clothing items. Take cool screenshots 
---
I go slow through all missions on the first run, I also explore and look for other mission starting points then when I replay a mission (powering up...) Or any daily I've already completed then I'll blitz through it. Other then that it feels odd to not go slow through a new nuclear wasteland. I have 3 different (legit) playthroughs on fallout 4 and ive always gone slow, even on my cheat run (tons of mods (god mode, infinite ammo, infinite carry weight and all perks out of the vault))
---
Nice comeback, doesn't in the slightest show your insecurity and lack of mental maturity. You got me! I'm the kid! Have a good life!
---
I'm on PC. I'll buy it for 2k caps if you'd like. 
---
well its a fallout universe.. where raiders exist.. i see this more of a cool niche thing rather than somethin to bitch about like some in the comments are
---
I’m sorry about those assholes.  If it’s any consolation that’s typically how I play. If you’re on PlayStation and looking for people to team up with you could play with me and some of my friends 
---
No items stored. But I have many turrets, like 4 or 5. I know they use lots of capacity but if it worked before, why doesn't it work anymore after I scrap something? 
---
I basically build a camp like I wanted and then filled up with turrets
---
You can find them and pick them up, but they are just scrap : (
---
(Raider and Ultracite cry in the distance)
---
Then what’s the incentive of doing events? What’s to keep you playin? The item you want wouldn’t be as rewarding if you could just find it. 
---
Rare items are sought after BECAUSE they are rare. If everyone had it because they found it in the world you wouldn’t want it. 
---
got an explosive lazer pistol once, doesn't shoot laser anymore (visually it's like a ballistic explosive weapon) , also it's not affected by demolition expert perk.  Ended up dropping it.
---
Ahah thanks dude, that's also mine
---
How do you get to own a pet? Are cats available too? 
---
As a matter of fact, I do have an extra set. You can have them if you want but explosive vents are broken right now so they are pretty worthless.
---
Haters gonna hate man, I've come to realize some people just have a hate boner for this game.
---
Yeah I was going to mention. I have sunk hundreds of hours into various fallout games and I barely ever use chems. For me they are just free money. Not relying on chems makes you boss not bust.
---
Okay. Thanks.
---
A town that's raised? I can only think of Tanagra, but that was a bunch of houses and didn't require any caves that I can remember.
---
Lmao, you sir are a better man than I 
---
I’m not your friend buddy 
---
If it was by design then why do you have to make specific builds in order to place them? Like campfire, rugs etc? As it is now, it wasn't meant to be. Since you can't stack the stairs without having to glitch the building. Hence my point still stands. /checkmateatheists
---
You would have to find a cat in a random encounter alone. Only creatures that spawn alone as a random encounter can be tamed.
---
Only way to get mods is to find more ultracite laser weapons. Theyre a bitch to get. Either have to craft them which is expensive as hell for materials. Or find them. Which is even harder.
---
And to keep them from breaking fast? Just don't use it, that's how poor energy weapon durability is. Gunsmith, weapon artisan and luck of the draw help, but it'll still be breaking after a lot of combat.
---
Do not put a splitter on it. Ever. It will break 4x faster. 
---
Thanks man, I’ll make sure I check it out.
---
I've had a lot of fun role playing as a BoS field scribe recruiting new players. I just keep bringing them to the military base to see if they have what it takes to join the BoS. Or another day I'll RP as an enclave officer and help them through the enclave recruitment. I do the quests without my explosive weapons since it makes the game too easy. I use some 2 shots that aren't explosive to be strong, but not too strong. 
---
Almost all the time.
---
Just trying to clear my stash and my inventory from something that I don't need and BOOM game crash
---
I'd settle for a girlfriend that just played games with me, don't care if they were good or bad
---
player name and make it unkillable by players problem solved
---
Screw them, man.  They sound like the type of players that are racing to finish the game, then shitting all over it because they were able to beat it so fast, when in reality they've missed out on the majority of the game.   ESPECIALLY Fallout games - if you rush through, you miss all the good stuff.
---
Y’all white knights ain’t gettin into her panties 😂 either way and this so called gamer gurl probably doesn’t even play and just farming upvote or its even a dude 😂
---
watoga often seems to have them.
---
Updated to include the exclusions.
---
Keep the character! How I see it, future updates will hold better energy weapons. And they could do a buff. You never know what could happen!
---
Morally wrong is still wrong. 
---
Pointless for me to leave my door open, even teammates can’t walk to my base without getting attacked so any strangers either gonna get killed or killing my pet sloth in self defense no idea how to make the turrets more “neutral” 
---
You would think, but gamers are usually assholes.
---
A fire on a wood platform!?
---
congrats! girl gamer here as well. took down my first scorchbeast around the same level as you and was proud of myself. you probably already know this but dudes that shit on you for doing something you enjoy are fucking idiots and not worth your time! don't let anyone make you feel bad for doing something you want. keep playing! if you're on xbox, happy to team up.
---
There's nothing rewarding about farming events for a 1/40 chance to get an outfit, which is compounded by the fact some of the outfits you might be rewarded with are outfits you can already find. That's at best, grind for the sake of grinding.
---
I took my bayonet off... it looks cool but the weapon does its own melee and I didn’t want to lose the range/accuracy
---
How about I’ll make it 100 caps with a stimpak?
---
did one border cost 1k atoms?
---
My wife did a broadcast on Xbox when our buddy tried to ride the Nuke like a majestic cowboy. I'll see if I can find it
---
Stop wasting time on useless perks you dont use later ...
---
You go girl!
---
I didn’t use chems until 76. I keep a buffout in inventory so I can fast travel a few pounds above my excavator limit to a vendor. 
---
You'd think after all that time they wouldn't be so tighty or whitey. 
---
Heh. Close enough. 
---
found this at the waratoga vendor
---
It's makes more sense to play Tetris than Whitespring ghoul simulator. Go do some quests or something.
---
Mindset of players: rush everything, don't bother exploring, abuse all the glitches and end up running around the same place AND complain.
---
Good thing your replies make all the sense in world.
---
Way to go, that's awesome and keep on playing. I've been playing since the BETA an ran across the Scorch Beasts maybe three times and have yet to defeat one myself. So way to go. Your not 'Shit', but you are a GAMER! 
---
Awesome job!!
---
My dildo has arrived
---
Subbed, thank you!
---
+1
---
While my buddy and I were exploring, we found a tuba and spent a good five minutes laughing at our characters playing the tuba with the mouthpiece clipping through the filters of our gas masks.
---
isnt that blue as fuck?
---
Pretty sure thats blue as fuck.
---
Oh look another person trying to stir shit up
---
It is a game. Play it any way you want to play. Well, don't be a griefer, but apart from that the only person's opinion that matters is your own. 
---
Occum’s Razor, brah!
---
Did i describe the blackbird paint?
---
Well done!!!   I've a similar play style!!  I sneak and snipe most of my kills and then panic and spray and pray my shotgun when they find me lol. 
---
My stash box is so full and I'm constantly over burdened. 
---
But I have fun, and can take down a scorch beast of I have to.
---
If your on pc,  feel free to add me, my ign  is the same as my Reddit username. Just send me a msg here if you do so I know who you are lol
---
I'm just a romantic, I hope he finds love under the starry nuked sky
---
I think he’s referring to the PA paint job.
---
Not sure tho since I do not PA.
---
If we are talking about realism that nuke would still kill me.
---
They did stop the Overloading yourself with boards dupe but there is already another one.
---
Dang. 😂 
---
aha lol totally missed it. thanks
---
I've had the game longer than you and I'm only level 23,so 6our doing better than this guy already! 
---
Isn't this most people in western society? We live in the me-me-me-mine-mine-mine world. 
---
You might want to get some perks for shotguns in the future. I’m also a snipe build but sometimes you need a close/mid option. The weapon wheel can really come in handy after you take the legs out And you have a dozen crawling legendary glowing ones. 
---
Always finger gunning people that start smacking me. Eventually they give up. And if I get shot from afar I start waving at the dude. 
---
Well son of a bitch.  Went on a quick weekend getaway wit the family. Won’t be back until tomorrow afternoon. 
---
The only thing I care about purchasing from the Atom Shop are PA skins. Dammit. Lol
---
I haven't picked those yet, probably my mistake. I've been focusing on doing damage with the heavy weapon perks.
---
I'm guessing there's a ton of nodes in the mine?
---
My playstyle exactly! Some people are just careful in-game and like to explore. What's wrong with that?
---
Others are just really good at combat. And some are level 100 in-game because they're level 4 in r/outside :)
---
Nah, the blackbird skin cost 1800. It was also a limited time item a while ago, it's not up for sale right now
---
They were referencing Doctor who, actually
---
I had to rebuild when this happened to me, even after scrapping everything I had stored. I enjoy making different structures though so it was an excuse to migrate and build.
---
I didn't add in the cost of the PA. The border and that pose are like 1000 points.
---
Ahahaha! This totally just made my morning. Great read!
---
Do you use the perk for the reduced weight on the 2mm?
---
I always forgot about it and I was carrying upwards of 75 lbs of 2mm.
---
You should consider joining a faction! It's a great way to find people to team  up with, and it creates a great sense of community! If you're  interested, here's a 170+ member BoS group: [https://discord.gg/PnEgyW7](https://discord.gg/PnEgyW7)   
---
We do wasteland patrols, roleplay, nukes, talk about Fallout lore, trade with each other, help each other gear up and level etc. You'd all be very welcome!
---
Then don’t farm events, just play the game you myopic toad
---
Oh uhh... nevermind then :)
---
Also my assumption 
---
They should thank you for spawning a lower level queen
---
Decided to take a workshop for the first time the other day, and after the first defense, one of the turrets decided to attack my stash box. I figured it was like getting a kitten all riled up; its aggression must be vented.
---
This information isn't accurate. Whitespring isn't the issue. Scorched Queen is. Scorched Queen scales based off the amount of people attacking her, so when 5 level 10 - 30 show up, she can become nigh impossible.
---
So it isn't always intolerance, sometimes it comes down to game design (although,, the scorched queen region should be level locked for this reason IMO)
---
/the more you know
---
So ruin it for everyone else smart not
---
Where did you get the light plans from?
---
Honestly it doesn’t really look that good in my opinion. Looks best on T-51 
---
I'd also like to have somthing we could shoot for fun.
---
Well it doesn’t help that the tamed creature attacks on sight, even teammates, my friend comes to my camp all the time and has to run inside the house to get a breather from being shot at by turrets and attacked by Mr. Cuddles and this is over multiple days and relogs, always with him on my team, so they at least don’t do any damage to him but still he can’t fast travel cause he’s being attacked and it’s really annoying 
---
A gamer 😎 girl? 😡 Wtf, this is historically inaccurate. Everyone knows wahmen can't play Vidya. Stacies trying to infiltrate our hobby, get out of here roastie. 👌
---
Agreed. That’s why I said the TSE still needs a balance. 
---
I think the idea is valid even if the reward isn’t a TSE. Currently there is such a huge gap between normal weapons and a TSE. There needs to be a way to get something “in between” besides RNG. Crafting, quest reward, something. 
---
OP translated it - hooray for OP
---
Just PM me your login credentials, credit card info, and mothers maiden name. I'll take care if it for you ;]
---
Good for you! As a guy, I can rightfully say guys are jerks! Congrats in the kill, I myself am only 18 since I don't have too much time to play but my game style is the sniper sneak as well, it's a great way to play, I feel it allows me to enjoy more of the game. I get ti appreciate the scenery and learn more of the plot lines and interactions, and who really wants to rely on handicaps (drugs) when you can do it purely on skill?
---
My wife killed a deathclaw once. Never been so proud. 
---
Can we get a more specific location for these random spawns? I saw in the thread that there are specific spots where random encounters occur. Anyone got a bead on that specific location? 
---
Tree hitting a freaking mutfruit bush with your melee weapon killing molerats.  Got a 20 cap bounty for it.  I literally went into a nuke zone and no one wanted to kill me.  Until I decided to run in front of an explosive shotgun.   It should be bounty for destroying whatever object.  Not hit with a bullet or swing of melee weapon. 
---
Shame the drop rate us low because I really want the Responder Fireman outfit.
---
I was in the middle of the gunfight trying to kill him, he crouched down, and vanished. Then he basically snipes me from a good distance just by spamming his minigun at me.
---
The correct answer is that Bethesda shouldn't lock end game content behind a spawn chance on server login.
---
Congratulations! It gets a lot easier once you hit level 50 as you have a lot more perks and better weapons. Try playing with a team mate. I learned so much about the game just from playing with random people who share their knowledge. If you are playing on Xbox then I’ll play with you. Pm me for gamer tag
---
or incase the launcher has a verify/check for updates feature that also determines if the files have been altered/changed in size or if new ones were added all together
---
Thats a known bug, I dont know what causes it or how to fix it but I've encountered it too and it eventually just stopped.
---
The dupe glitch does need to be patched, but is it like personally affecting your ability to play and enjoy the game? If dupers are affecting you that much, you probably need to step away from the game for a bit. 
---
The vendors are usually out of caps sell other stuff I don't need. 
---
Well done for overcoming the adversity of some criticism, your journey started started with that march to the shop. You 've battled through life and faced demons of the highest order and succeeded in killing a character in a video game. You are the hero we don't deserve. 
---
60 levels in 76 hours here damn nukesprings is good. I got to 54 on Xbox before switching to PC so I don't mind the quick levels.
---
There's a reason these guys are ex's.  it doesn't matter how bad your gf is at games.  You always encourage them and stay optimistic.
---
I soloed a scorchbeast at lvl 35. I didnt really feel that it was that difficult but I was wearing a full set of power armor. Just took a shit ton of ammo...
---
I dont use chems either. I sell those. I sneak everywhere too when I am on my sneak/snipe. Yeah enjoy the game how you see fit. PM me for my username. Ill take you on a wasteland date. Help you forgrt about the idiot you broke up with. ;)
---
Move on quit bitching 
---
Think that's because the costume is in the atom shop. 
---
Try the scorched queen. They nerfed how melee damage works against her, so even someone with a half hearted long range rifle build can outdamage her compared to a full build melee =P
---
been dead set on convincing my gf to get an xbox to play these games together
---
Sounds like you were in two emotionally abusive relationships. Glad you're out of them, and hope you use that experience to have better relationships in the future! 
---
Well done and well played :) There loss is one less scorchbeast in the World
---
“Nothing rewarding” implies if you don’t receive the item you wanted you receive nothing when that is not true. You still receive caps/xp/ammo/meds. And it’s not grinding for grinding sake... it’s an event, that offers rewards. Some rare, some not. 
---
If it’s not rewarding enough to do it, be it drop rate or otherwise, just don’t do it. Move on. If everyone stops doing events they will adjust drop rates accordingly. 
---
You can always “buy” it from another player... someone luckier than you. Spend your valuable time farming for things to trade for the item you desire. Online game, dude. Take advantage of the player-run market.  
---
Enclave vendor sells it sometimes
---
I have no idea. I hadn’t actually seen it before, and having googled it now it looks grey to me but I’m colorblind (tritanopia) so that means nothing. 
---
I was just saying that usually, that’s the culprit when someone says it looks Enclave. 
---
Dude mark your calendar for like 10 days from now, then post something just like this person's post in this sub and make sure to put "gamer girl" in the title, and how gamer men are mean to you. You'll get 3.6k upvotes and 2 golds within a few hours. 
---
I killed him when friendship didn’t work. Felt bad I just wanted a friend 
---
These guys have to have somethinf seriously wrong with them to make fun of their gf for playing video games instead of thinking its awesome. My gf never touched a fps before meeting me and i taught her how to play from scratch. Now she is better than half my friends and just as invested in games as me. So when i see stories like this of people ignorantly making fun of their girl for just trying to have fun it rlly drives me nuts. 
---
Yes please. I spent over an hour having 2 level 90, one mid 30 and two mid 25 players repeatedly destroying the camp I (level 47) was trying to build, killing me and taking my junk. First time I’ve run into a wild pack of assholes since I’ve started playing.
---
Gamer mama here- get rid of any twits that call you shit.  
---
Congrats on your kill! 
---
&gt; I guess I just want to know whether the game has more to offer or whether it is truly dead and that I should just let it go. 
---
The game isn't dead, you just burned yourself out. the game is still very very new, in the grand scheme of things so of course there will be more content to come. How much, how extensive, and how often it will come is pure speculation at this point. 
---
The most I can suggest is do what I do; find new friends online to play with, help out lower levels when you get the chance to, get the trophies, achievements, etc. Stock up on gear and materials so youll be prepared for the new content when it released. Collect outfits/costumes, etc.
---
The game leaves alot of choice up to you, for you to experience it your way. If you already experienced it every way you can think of, then maybe it would be best to put it down for a while. 
---
I'd be happy with something that has a pulse at this point.
---
*cries in loneliness and social anxiety*
---
And those guys should go to a mental hospital 
---
I honestly never had that experience, everyone seemed too busy just farming. Anyway, the area is always full of 40+ level people so there is absolutely no chance lower level ghouls will spawn unless you literally joined a newly made server and you manage to make your way there first.
---
I guess it's how those prices convert to real world currency that is the issue. Since they do have a real world currency value, then the items being sold can be said to also have that value for the price it is listed for. So a door for example being $5. A skin being $14. Etc. If you were to buy the atoms that is how much you would be paying. I personally have over 1000 and nothing really interests me too much, but at the same time if the pricing for the atoms were more reasonable I might be more inclined to spend. As it is, coupled with server issues, crashes and bugs, I'm definitely less inclined to spend more on a game I already paid full release price for. I don't bitch about it, but I will share my opinion if the subject comes up.
---
You or your community CANNOT tell or control others on how to play an open world multiplayer game. Sorry to bring you back to reality.
---
Sub spec for shotguns or melee. Pick up the shells that drop off scorched and mole miners. Use the shotty or a sledge while you are farming lead for the gatling/.50.
---
Make sure you are using ammosmith rank 2 and super duper rank 3 while crafting bullets. You should be swimming in ammo real quick. 
---
Shred the guns you get with scrapper for steel. Lucky Hole mine runs with Excavator armor will net you several hundred lead. Gunpowder can be had from cloth and acid at a chem bench.
---
yesterday i came across 3 low level players in flatwoods, i jumped up onto a roof and they crowded round down below, i pulled out my fatman with mirv launcher and looked down, theyd all ran for it, i fired one shot behind them to have a little fun (i have pacifist mode on)
---
one started following so i started walking away, blowing up cars and tossing grenades left and right
---
later on they were in a small town north east of flatwoods, they were clearing out the town and i was helping from a distance, one of them started banging on a work bench in the open, i sneaked up from on high and dropped a nuke mine in his face, it killed me but i got a laugh out of it
---
later they were in helvetia, i decided to end the night by playing on the tuba, and letting them find me, it was a lot of fun :D
---
It is VERY useful in nuke zones *IF* you have someone running Rad sponge.
---
Essentially it gives you health regen any time you are taking radiation. YOU STILL TAKE RADIATION DAMAGE. That's why rad sponge is nice. Since you are constantly taking radiation in the nuke zone, you are constantly regening, if you have someone running Rad sponge to pull the rads off of you, then you lose the rads, but gain health regen.
---
Oh awesome I'll try it out next time. It's a shame that that it's PA or hazmat only in nuke zomes, unless you can get some partied people using that perk that gets rid of rads. Now if I can get it to work for me I can use my combat armor instead.
---
It's pretty much like saying 'Crime is high because our police department is shit'.
---
Pair it up with Rad Sponge and share rad sponge in a team makes this card very useful, you will basically always at full health
---
Read that they always respawn, but each pet only gets a set number of respawns before they’re gone forever. 
---
You still have over 24 hours, the store says "1 day" instead of an hour countdown. I don't know how long exactly is left but if afternoon is soon where you live, you might be able to make it
---
Fellow girl gamer here. I play like you, and I love it. :) I think chems are near worthless, myself. Only a couple minutes of use does not suit my play style! LOL
---
My fiance teases me sometimes about my sneaky style, but at the end of the day, he's happy to have a gamer girl. Good riddance to the trash that belittled you for your gaming style! Hang in there, and don't settle for someone that gives you that much crap for enjoying things your own way. ;) :)
---
And if you ever want to explore with a fellow girl gamer, give me a shout. :)
---
I love your attitude! Keep it up! I'm new to F76 and think it's great, got any tips??
---
Please don’t kink shame.
---
Semantics.   Battlefield has flight simulation and fallout 76 has pvp.  It's a pvp game far more than a game that has no pvp.   Especially camps.  Camps don't take reduced damage being on pacify.  However, I think pets should be repairable like every other camp item.  Anyway, semantic arguments aside, everything in a camp is destroyable, my issue isn't that, but that pets aren't repairable like everything else too.   Though some say they respawn, that seems buggy at best, not sure if intended.
---
I was just writing a bunch and realised this is too off topic so I'll just say the fact you can earn atoms ingame does not make the other complaints invalid. Several other games have microtransaction based systems that let you earn the cash shop money by playing without having these insane prices. I am someone that loves outfits and customising my character in games, but the fact that they could easily half the prices on everything and i still wouldn't be interested in most of what they offer isn't really a good sign. 
---
This is of course completely ignoring all the other predatory practises and issues with the store, but this is mainly about the pricing and earning ingame atoms.
---
I think I have them I’ll let you know ASAP. Ps4?
---
Tell me, where would one find these "*blocked computers*"?
---
Doesn't work for every maze.
---
Thanks a lot! Where can i find Rad Sponge?
---
Thanks a lot. Where can I find Rad spomge?
---
It’s decently hard to get on the top of the building and mobs are kind of rough there 😂, plus I’m sure there’s a small subset who will see this.  You may yet more business this way from an easily farmable location for yourself 
---
If we are talking realism it would be a butch to play that guitar with gloves on
---
Keep playing the game how you see fit. It was your dollars spent, it's your time spent and it's your entertainment. These cupcakes are just gonna have to face facts that they can't have it their way. This ain't BurgerKing.
---
Maybe they should date each other? 
---
I didn’t realize she leveled by first on the scene, I thought she scaled to all players present. Either way, I’ve still got no idea what they were mad about. 
---
Railway rifle and harpoon gun with flechettes mod is also good. 
---
Harpoon gun makes is own ammo basically. Railway rifle is just steel and great for killing anything level below level 40.
---
Honestly, that's how I played up until about level 40. Sneaking all over with a sniper for Crits, and using a shotgun for up close. Saw my first scorchbeast (level 50) when I was level 31 and charged right at it haha. I'm using a .50cal,  shotgun, and grognaks axe now. Play styles change for some people, doesn't for others. 
---
Personally, it seems like you're doing just fine. 
---
Glad you aren't with those toxic people anymore! My girl plays games, pretty well I might add, but she doesn't do well with sidescrollers. Instead of bashing her, I build her up and try to help her improve, the way a good spouse does lol. Get you someone that builds you up girl! 
---
Play your games exactly the way that makes you happy. Nobody else has the right to tell you any other way to do it. And anyone who tries is an asshole. 
---
Grats on taking down that cancer bat and solo. You'll have enough of them at some point, but I still get a little satisfaction from killing them just to shut them up. 
---
You are awesome!
---
Stop dating morons.
---
Put some strobe lights in there for a funhouse feel.
---
Nothing says “idgaf “ like strumming a guitar while a nuclear bomb goes off!! 
---
I did that. Minimal improvement. But I have a regular ass editions ps4.
---
thank you so much!
---
With my ex it was opposite. She was *very* competitive while was more casual. She would talk mad shit, and tbh could usually back it up. 
---
You think she didn’t know that when she posted it?
---
You deleted your stuff, but you did describe black paint with white markings? 
---
if you don't want suggestions you probably shouldn't open your mouth
---
Yea it took me a while to figure this one out. It wasn’t until I was trying to get mutated that I realized how useful it was. Anytime you are taking radiation you regen health. So for instance in a nuke zone, if your HP is at 1 your health bar will begin filling with hp from one end and radiation from the other until they meet. 
---
I always behave in a game the way I would in real life, and expect others to do the same. So when someone shows up and kills and harasses a person for no reason I assume they’re a horrible psychopath in real life who needs to be put down :) 
---
Lol story of our lives. 
---
Playlist stored locally would be great. Then we wouldn't have to redo it every time we get booted.
---
What’s your gamer tag ?
---
You mean like the when world revolved around you after some randos destroyed your pixelated house in a make believe world?
---
I don't know if this is the same thing or what you mean but I have a problem where the binds around the hand just look white and really low res. So when I reload it just looks a really bright white even in dark and it clips through the weapon. 
---
Just switch servers 
---
This doesn't really work with a romantic partner, though. Of course you're going to care what your SO says.
---
Confirming in PS4 , I think it has to do with having legendaries in the trade . I see the do this weird jump in the screen for vendoring then a crash  happens . 
---
I would like this option but for lower levels. As soon as you leave the Forest and a high level is within 50 light years of any quest location... prepare to run and switch server.
---
Do it twice didn't work 
---
She barks, she drools, she claws!
---
Keep that carcass, people will avoid your camp because „some badass lives there that shot down a Scorchbeast“ 
---
In the Charisma tree. Note though, that someone else has to be running it for you to have the benefits that I described above.
---
A lot of guys that I date start off thinking that way and then get pissy about the way I play (like OP) or get mad when I beat them. 
---
I've started turning guys I'm dating into gamers. That way they learn my style and think it's the right way :D
---
Yeah she might still be lvl 99 but the HP are way higher if a lvl 150 spawns it. That's my understanding anyway.  I've seen groups where the highest levels stay on the edge of the nuke zone until a lvl 60ish player (partner?) goes in.
---
Yes for 1000caps 
---
4K if u don’t have mats, and 2k if u have ten violet flux, 40 aluminum, 20 crystal shards
---
It’s under charisma has up to 3 stars but you really only need a lvl 1 and share it with your team, so you heal your teams Rads and they heal your rads,all while ghoulish is refilling HP
---
1000caps 
---
I’m a dude and I literally play the exact same way. Although I would say I’m fair at combat. I suggest learning to use the area and map to your advantage (I’m a level 24 I think). Like yesterday I was doing a main quest that had me fighting level 40 super mutants. I was in a highway and kept jumping over the concrete medium to make the super mutants not be able to reach me. I do this just about every time I fight. Although I’ve never killed a scorchbeast, I always run, so good job for that!
---
Don’t be ashamed of the way you play games. As long as you are enjoying yourself then that’s all that matters. Especially with games like fallout, you can play however you want and the game will let you! So keep grinding and good luck out in the wastes, fight the good fight.
---
It doesn't sound like you're shit at games, it sounds like your exes are just shit at being decent people. Don't let anyone tell you your not good enough to play games or you're doing it wrong. Games are for fun, if you're having fun, you're doing it right.
---
I’ll take it, you on now? 
---
Interesting. If i play in a team of 2 members do we each have to have this skill?
---
http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Bunker_Buster_(weapon) link to a wikia page page for the weapon. It doesn’t say it but I think it comes w/ the guidance system and triple barrel by default.
---
Rad sponge is a charisma perk
---
That’s why I said balanced endgame, trapped is primarily energy with rad resist but its stats are just generally low compared to other armor 
---
It happens all the time sadly.
---
I was just happy my girlfriend at the time was willing to play F4! 
---
(We didn’t break up, we’re engaged) 
---
I picked up 2 copies of the French tricentennial version off Amazon on boxing day for 35$ for the gf and I.  Not worth more than that I'd say.
---
Exactly my problem with every bad review of fallout. I’m sure they all rush through and complain that it’s bad. How about actually putting time into the game and exploring every corner. That’s what fallout is all about, at least for me
---
I’ve gotten it from taking and defending workshops. I’ve received all the different instrument plans multiple times this way (I put my duplicate plans in the overseers cache in the Flatwoods church so a few newbies have gotten lucky.) The plan is called “wind instruments.”
---
I second that. Exploring is half the fun in fallout games. I'm level 31 and still running from scorch beasts with no shame. There is nothing wrong with your play style at all, OP. I'm on pc as well, feel free to shoot me a pm both of you. 🙂 
---
It does. I got all my plans from either the station vendor or the in town vender.  
---
No. One person has to run rad sponge, share it so that you each soak each other's rads up. The other runs Ghoulish and shares it so you both regen. The highest level of Ghoulish is recommended. However level 1 of rad sponge is really all you need if you have decent rad resist.
---
Charisma iirc
---
It happens specifically when I lock onto a target through vats, like a mob.  If the target runs behind something, like a workbench, and you pull the trigger it will hit that workbench - even if vats shows 95% on the target.  
---
It's happened to me twice while trying to help protect a strangers workshop.  Could be a glitch though.
---
I got in a few before running seemed like the safest option. 
---
There is a going theory about fallout 76 being a simulation as it clashes not only with the lore Black Isle/obsidian made but also Bethesda’s own lore 
---
Maybe we aren’t in a simulation - maybe we ALL ARE SYNTHS 
---
Bethesda, gimme a full power armor cosplay suit if my theory is right!!! 
---
My GT is Bigblackashley 
---
It is a Charisma perk
---
Hey I kinda stuck too. Do you play on xbox. I'm only level ten and I'm playing later with some guys on here.
---
its pc :(
---
&gt;I sneak literally all over the map
---
I'm getting flashbacks of that meme where Dragonborn exploded both his knees 🤣
---
But on the real that's lit I remember my first scorchbeast kill. I was about level 35ish and it took me and my brother both of our combined firepower to kill it! Oh and plus the robots at whitespring 😶
---
Glad you're enjoying the game though! Me, my brother, and my dad all play together on xbox and we really just like to walk around and have fun, because that's what it should all be about. Not doing it a "right" or "wrong" way, because theres no right or wrong way to have fun. So stick it to everyone who says otherwise.
---
Happy Wandering!
---
Thanks for the confirmation 
---
Sheeeeeit
---
No real gamer would criticize another person's playstyle. We are mostly a welcoming bunch and appreciate everyone who gives it a try. They are losers.
---
Nope, but it actually looks pretty damn cool in person. I made the same mistake and thought it was super secret Enclave paint because the shoulder has a circle of stars, but no E in the middle. Forgive the link, it's from Google - 
---
https://gamemania-sec.azureedge.net/-/media/Sites/GameMania/Products/Games/F/FALLOUT/Fallout-76/Screenshots/Fallout-76-Tricentennial-Edition-X01-Power-Armor.jpg
---
So much cringe
---
lol was thinking the same thing but didn't say it. 
---
I’m pretty sure unless u have a bayonet the u can melee with it and it breaks pretty quick 
---
Joining. My gt is Brostradamus22 
---
So actually I would share Ghoulish and my teammate would share RadSponge and we both will benefit from those perks right?
---
Thanks a lot
---
When that glitch happened to my friend he said he was sticking his spindly fingers into the lock, no bobby pins required.
---
Dont spec heavy weapons
---
3 people with mutations and all you need is bird bones marsupial and the charisma mutation card and 75% bonus in the luck cards
---
I know this is way late, but did you ever find it in the menu? I have an energy guns section and can't find it whatsoever. I wonder if I need the original gatling laser plans to craft it.
---
Beth has said private servers are planned in the future.  But who knows really.  It would not be the first time a product launched with expected features in the pipeline nixed.
---
People who go around telling other they are shit gamers are usually shit gamers themselves, your playing the game the exact same way I am, the exact same way I played fo3 and 4 and honestly I think its the way its ment to be played.  
---
I dont know your situation, but it sounds like your alot better off out of that somewhat toxic relationship. Good on you.
---
Will add now. Doing a sale. Meet you soon. 
---
Yeah. The only catch is that you need to stay somewhat near each other to have radsponge proc.
---
Yes, I know that, with the EA/Disney thing, but people weren't up and arms screaming about how it's 'another Disney Fiasco' instead it was 'This is an EA problem, but we can hit them on it in another way'.
---
Without seeing the official draft of the agreement for Silver Screen to produce, most of what I'm saying is based on how the actual production/alcohol laws are written.  Since Silver Screen is in Texas, we'll go with that (and Bethesda also has an office here in Austin).
---
To legally produce and sell alcohol here in Texas you need state, and federal level licenses.  On state level you need a  **DISTILLER'S AND RECTIFIER'S PERMIT** as Rum is a spirit, but this only lets you sell to whole salers, and to 'Qualified individuals outside the state'.  They would also need a 'Package Store Permit' and that's only assuming they sell exclusively to individuals and wouldn't be willing to sell Nuka Dark to any night clubs, bars, or any other 'social event' kind of place, each type of which requires it's own permit.
---
From a legal, and financial stand point, there would be no point in Bethesda being a 'partner' in this as then they'd need to get the correct documentation and registrations, where as if Silver Screen purchased lisencing rights with a clause stating x% of sales goes to the parent company (which is pretty common, Authors do this kinda thing with publishers etc.) then there wouldn't be the issue of needing the permits and registrations.
---
At the very least, if Bethesda ordered the alcohol from Silver Screen with intent to sell, they'd need Package Store and Wholesalers permits (as package store has to get things from wholesaler, and wholesaler gets things from producer and sells to retail locations)
---
[https://www.tabc.state.tx.us/licensing/license\_and\_permit\_description.asp#liquor](https://www.tabc.state.tx.us/licensing/license_and_permit_description.asp#liquor)
---
This is the descriptions for permits and what each entails, and here are some of the fees associated with just getting the permits; [https://www.tabc.state.tx.us/licensing/files/Fee-Chart.pdf](https://www.tabc.state.tx.us/licensing/files/Fee-Chart.pdf) 
---
TL:DR; the amount of red tape and money used to be 'directly involved' with the process is not worth it for a single, limited run product.  This all is only the requirements at state level, they would also need to meet the federal level requirements.
---
Well yeah they should be happy then, that’s exactly what I did. Nuked just outside the dropsite fast travel market so people could come easily and everything, thought I did pretty good. 
---
If you want legendary you’re gonna need to find the plans to craft BoS mod, find legendary combat armor and mod it. There is no specific mobs or enemies that drop any specific legendaries, only instance if restricted drops I’ve encountered is scorch beast queen and ultracite plans, everything else is the will of RNGesus 
---
Grab radstag cooked grants a carrying capacity boost. 
---
Ok cool
---
I have the tuba and I'm not even sure how. I think it might be "Wind Instruments," implying that there were more planned.
---
I’ve never been able to craft neither the mod nor any laser gun. I guess you need the base plan which I have never been able to score. 
---
Damn I’d just be happy to find a woman that would play with me. 
---
As has been said numerous times, explosive needs to move to a primary stat, or greatly reduced in damage to remain secondary. That’s my opinion as well.
---
No you just have to have a minimum of 3 charisma to share the lvl 1 card with your team wether it’s 2 3 or 4 people only one person needs to share the card.
---
Oh, I stag or steak, booze, and the chems! I have a hoarding problem. 
---
Your lack of punctuation makes that sentence more confusing than it ought to be.
---
Sounds like you deserve better! Sneaky sniper is exactly how I play the game too.
---
Lmao I too am afraid of this exact quest. Those suckers are scary! 
---
Al clear now! Thanks
---
It’s just the red wooden walls but was bugged previously and mixed up with power connectors.  Shouldn’t be this rare but I barely see camps with those walls anymore.
---
Exactly, although depending on the agreement, even with final say, if Silver Screen had started producing the plastic cases, or ordered them in advance assuming the agreement from Bethesda, they might have been able to seek reimbursement for such.  It all depends on the wording within the undisclosed agreement.
---
Pics or it diddnt happen
---
Parzival12345
---
It's Fallout, you've been playing it right the entire time! Some people are just dicks and can't let others do things their way. Pay them no mind, as long as YOU have fun, nothing else matters.
---
Anyone wanna team up on ps4 come hang with me and my rabble. Some guys are pretty high level and glad to just meander and help where possible. Noting serious. Beers will be drunk, nonsense will be talked!!! Add me stephenbone18
---
South Paul reference but sadly also American police reference...
---
Don't we all... Now where is some plastic!!!!  First was screws, then it became springs, now it's plastic.  
---
I didn't know that the Red Hot Chili Peppers played FO76!
---
Dude what an incredible idea! Can't believe I haven't tried it myself yet
---
[XB1] my game is continually whenever I'm am under attack. This game is just broken for me now.
---
Legendary effect that adds increased armor and energy resistance with more health on all armor with max endurance and the team perk that adds resistance under charisma may get you there 
---
Glad to see they're still adding to atom shop instead of fixing that water purifier bug that's made the game unplayable for some of the community for about a month now... Priorities 👍
---
That's exactly how I play lol, I sneak up to everything.  Don't you fret over those jackass exes, I'd love it if my wife would game with me but she's just not interested in anything I play.  Congrats on killing a scorch beast, I've not even tried it yet and I'm just a few levels higher at 38.
---
Catch me in the wastelands, PSN: GRZBOT
---
When playing in a squad it’s good for everyone to have 3 charisma to share at least one perk and everyone share a different perk that will benefit the whole team 
---
Bonus points for singing "We'll Meet Again" in your deepest voice while riding into Oblivion
---
Yep it's bringing in about 20 upvotes every time I refresh
---
Indeed!
---
Yes. Just bringing up the Pipboy often crashes my Xbox.
---
My favorite is still the skeleton catapults. Can't remember the name of the place, Johnson's Acre or something? I laughed so hard launching them.
---
Let’s not do this “she knew what she was doing” shit, please.
---
The enclave vendor in the command bunker sells it, it is just really pricey for something I probably won't use. Thanks for responding, I know it's a month old thread, but no one else seems to not be able to see it.
---
You and i sound like very similiar gamers. I go at a snails pace when everyone else seems to be rushing to complete the next objective.
---
I sneak.. All the time. And my character dont mess with no chems. No ma'am. (Altho i sell em to the robots.. So technically im a wasteland drug dealer)
---
Im level 73 and i havent completed the main story. 
---
Congrats on the scorchbeast kill! Those are verrry rewarding when done solo.
---
That's not exactly how it works in Texas, where Silver Screen is located, and where Bethesda is also kinda located.  There are alot of hoops to jump through.  Sure Bethesda could commission a special product for their own consumption.  But to be able to sell it requires permits, and fees (some of which get into the thousands in cost) and that's just for the state level documents needed, not including the federal level documents.  Sample production would have also been 'safer' for them when it comes to commissioning something to be distributed, however they would still have likely had to jump through some hoops to make it legal
---
Lol Awesome.
---
Ive managed to get it more than once at low level from things like those little blue lunchboxes around the map. They seemed to follow logic when placing items like this and so large buildings, construction sites, mines etc all have an abundance of said lunchboxes
---
That's what it's always been about.  I have this conversation with my kid, who also just wants to rush through the game - you're missing out on all the good stuff.
---
Agreed, nights are way to bright now.  I haven't played much since the Dec 11th patch hit solely because of this.  Bothered me more and more each day to a point where I'm about done with the game.  Whatever reasons they had to make it brighter were not worth sacrificing the the tools specifically designed to help you explore at night.  Now, there isn't much call to even use the Pip-Boy light, PA headlamps, NV mods, or the Night Eyes perk anymore.  Might as well remove them from the game.
---
Stumbled on this post and had to comment.  I'm hopeful more people will speak up about this.
---
Most dudes trash talk.  But glad you broke up with those losers. Life is too short to put up with a$$holes. Sounds to me like they felt threatened by you. Take care and enjoy the game. 
---
How much 
---
Same. I have an excellent river view so the only wall is to protect from enemies everything else is open and free for use, except I put a level 0 lock on my porta pottie but I realize now that if someone else does that they wouldn't get easy XP theyd get wanted. Oops 
---
The Better Inventory mod causes this. You can check a more obvious issue caused by it by going to the atom store and check if you can see the pictures for any of the items.
---
Easy to fix though, edit your Fallout76Custom.ini file with the below:
---
[Archive]
---
sResourceArchive2List = SeventySix - ATX_Main.ba2, SeventySix - ATX_Textures.ba2, BetterInventory.ba2
---
If you have other mods added like you said you need to add them to the end. The first time I set it up I deleted the first few lines because I thought it was referring to mods I wasn't using but you do actually need the whole lot.
---
Log out and hard reset
---
*checks name*
---
oh myyyy
---
&gt; I don't rush into things, I sneak literally all over the map and never use Chems.
---
&gt; I am, admittedly, not good at combat.
---
Sounds like you're playing to your strengths, OP. You're playing your way, and having fun doing it.
---
I'm 300+ hours into my first Skyrim play-through, have barely touched the main quest line, and am having a blast (taking my time and enjoying being in the world). 
---
F**k what anyone else says. Game how you want to game.
---
There are playable mouth harps as well.
---
Do you mean it wont be placed? Like right after you logged in or that your base just vanished while playing?
---
Dang. I think that is a factor. I don't crash much at all but i run lean all the time.
---
There is no fix.  It’s not a you thing it’s a game thing.
---
*and is supportive rather than putting you down.
---
I get what your trying to say, but the way bureaucracy works takes something that should be simple and makes it like finding a yellow needle in a haystack.  Even if Bethesda does not make the alcohol, they still would have to get permits/licenses to purchase it for resale, and to resell it.  That's alot of red tape and a few thousand dollars, just for the legality side of things
---
wood stove maybe? that's in appliances
---
I agree with that.  TS and E should not both be able to be on a gun. 
---
Still a huge gap between “normal” Dmg weapons and Legendary.  Was looking for a idea to help bridge that gap. 
---
I have the complete set, tuba and all on my roof by the river. Everyone is welcome to it
---
So now it's just a matter of Bethesda seeing this and deciding if this option is worth changing?
---
Sorry to hear that! I wish my GF had an interest in video games, I'd love to spend time with her playing them but she doesn't care seems like
---
Hell, my build is a sneak sniper. Yes I played Skyrim. Yes, I wondered if I could be a stealth archer in Fallout. Yes, you can.
---
It’s a perfectly legitimate strategy and build for the game. Play it in the way that creates the most fun for you. 
---
Yes. I take full advantage of “Batteries Included”. Also reduced the weight of fusion cores. 
---
Wait... you can sneak in that game? Huh. I've been leeeeeeroy Jenkins the game. Maybe I should try this "Sneaking"(whatever that is) and I'll live longer. Also if you're ever on my server I'll hook you up with come stempaks, purified waters, and repair your stuff. 
---
So tell me a little about these.. Audio logs... 
---
Make it a habit to bulk and sell your junk. 
---
I am a recovering junkahokic.  You need to learn to let go.  Keep the rare stuff of course, but dump extra steel and wood.  Also, gunpowder is an inventory killer. 
---
That being said, I would love it if the junk stash was capped at 400 and you had a completely separate stash for items.  
---
Instead of saying you were shit...they should have tried to teach you how to be better.    Idiots...
---
Seems like it was good riddance breaking up with both those guys. 
---
Well done, sister! 👊🏼
---
They seem to use spheres for the borders now instead of the old fashioned cylinder that went up and down infinitely, so if you can climb high enough or get to an awkward place you can get outside of the no build zone.
---
That's a personal preference. Doesn't change the fact that it's better
---
I'd assume they had a road map for releasing items before the game came out, also it is most certainly different people working on bugs and the atom shop. 
---
I'm sure that they're different departments :P
---
I have made an other post about a glitch, and after this i have see that i have loose some object that a friend built for me, 2 turrets and all my plantation... its not that much but it's annoying
---
I thought it might be level, but it wasn't worded well at all
---
Keep it up buddy you beating me by 5
---
Reading this made me feel secondhand embarrassment.
---
Someone is way to used to playing other survival games where everything and everyone is focused on killing you; you should chill out and stop being so hostile to everything and remember that this is Fallout and not Rust or Ark.
---
Saw you’re on xbox from another comment, if you have room during nuke runs I’d like to join up! I don’t have any friends that play fo76 and I haven’t been able to join hardly any SBQ runs because of it. My Gt is Gator Vz.
---
It depends on the girls, some are obnoxious and asking you things about the game like 24/7 when u just want to chill and play quietly. Others just like to know everything, even asking for spoilers while im like wtf? No find these thing yourself and enjoy the ride because that's the amazing part if i tell you what's gonna happen there is no magic.
---
Unfortunately, the number of the world owes me this kind of recognition and all the women brand of incel is very rampant in the gaming world of today. I’m very glad my girlfriend plays games with me but I imagine she wouldn’t if I treated her like garbage like OP’s ex’s did. 
---
Don’t settle for people who get that aggressive and shitty over video games, man. 
---
Oh dude, you are greatly missing out.  
---
Rank 2 ammosmith gives you 80% more ammo when crafting. 
---
Then rank 3 Super duper gives 30% chance to double anything you craft. 
---
You could be getting at least 2-3 times what you are already getting from your current mats. 
---
Just put them on when crafting, and take them off when done. 
---
You need some better boyfriends.. nobody deserves abuse.
---
I play with my wife all the time, she isn't in to shooters at all where I've been in to shooters for literally decades. I was so pumped that she'd play OW with me and now she's really in to Fallout. Her aim really isn't that good, nor is her game sense. It's sometimes frustrating for me "why didn't you see that coming" type of moments, but more often than not it ends up being pretty hilarious since she has such a different perspective on the game. I rush in, predicting behaviours and seeing the game more like a program. She sees games more like an actual world and that makes it amazing to play with her.
---
There really isn't much point to playing a game if you don't enjoy it. I like beating game mechanics, she loves exploring the world and has tons of fun that way. It always sucks when people closest to you don't help you enjoy the game and expect you to approach it in the same way.
---
Grats on your scorchbeast kill, when I was lvl 34 and would see a scortchbeast of any lvl I'd just run :)
---
If you don't have the plan for that stuff your friend has to place it for you again
---
I’m on Xbone :(
---
Never heard of it. What does it do?
---
Well yeah it does affect me. I wanted to be a stationary trader next watoga. Now I don't even have to bother to set sth up just because almost everyone is able to get Tse weapons god roll armor etc. from dupers who just give it away for free. It needs to be patched AND item levels need to be raised so that all these Tse weapons won't matter cause in the end they are just aren't as good as others. 
---
Which system do you use pretty sure there’s more Hanna few people who would team up with you
---
Habits get you everywhere :/
---
I’m only level 30 but I went around my server giving my old weapons to lower levels such  as a level 10 perfect storm machine gun
---
I don’t need them and they can definitely use them 
---
The raider power armor is available at level 15, good luck finding all the pieces. Check YouTube for raider power armor spawns.
---
See I’m tempted but I don’t like the idea of situational buffs like high health . 
---
With the legendary right gear I can almost be better than power armor with the exception of radiation resist. But then after a few hits all that goes away.
---
Thats why I wear a dress on my guy!

Yeah stuff made by friends are still a bit glitchy especially if they leave and you dont have the plans it doesnt let you do things with the object, or even scrap it sometimes.
---
Noted. 
---
That's exactly the same way I play, and it's very ammo efficient and effective. VATS is definitely something worth having for a sneak build. So, yeah, good job! I really despise people who just rush everything and end up not having anything to do other than whine like idiots.
---
I killed my first Scorchbeast as lvl 30 or so, but it wasn't really me... I just, kind of, managed to get the true apex predator or Appalachia to do it for me... A mirelurk queen.
---
Why do the jerks end up with a gaming GF? If only I could be that lucky:’(
---
Yeah I found a couple weaps like that too...sadly it's almost guaranteed to have come from a duper
---
there is another in atlas and in the part of the antennas
---
I don’t sneak a ton, and tend to smash things with sledgehammers, but you’re more than welcome to join me if you’re  on PS4. Having a sneaky person makes for a good teammate collaboration when you tank. 
---
Cool guys never look at the explosion.
---
Thanks! I haven't been in there yet.
---
Yeah I agree my girlfriend likes to play video games with me I don't care if she's good or bad but most of the time she figures it out and does better than me.
---
Yup, gotten all the BOS upgrades that way.
---
On a non-fiction note, fuck wendigos.  
---
Fuck your first visit to the golf club as a level 20 and  finding a fucking glowing wendigo waiting on the stairs.  
---
Choose squealing like a bitch, choose running away, choose hoping that the CAMP in the distance has a set of guns to help you out, choose life. And fresh underwear.
---
My base was destroyed last night as well. I saw a level 160 with a 700 cap bounty near my base, and feared the worst. Then I got the notification that my base was under attack, and now his bounty was 900. When I fast traveled, it was easy enough to get a sneak attack with my explosive shotgun because he was preoccupied. Only got 161 caps, and no loot. They then sought revenge for some reason. Managed to catch them again in the trees.
---
When I was able survey the damage, I still had my front door turret puttering away, never shot at the person.. 
---
Worse yet, when I selected "Repair All", the game crashed. Reload, try again, another crash.
---
I ended up moving camp to store everything. Luckily, that also repairs everything. The salt in the wound was being charged 160 caps to move, despite the prompt saying 40.
---
What happens if you build a camp over it? 
---
Op's username is gold. I agree. 
---
Also fallout is at its best when you take it slow and explore that random little shed-oh shit another scorchbeast!
---
Wtf kinda assholes were you in a relationship with? 
---
No no... didnt you know? Devs have multiple monitors because while they are coding and debugging on one, they are doing graphic design on the other!
---
Potential band name... Keazar and the mini nukes!
---
You do you, it's your recreational time. If you set a specific goal and were seeking advice and asked for help, that would be different. Some folks set their own personal limits and rules that they live by...sometimes those slow you down...not everyone uses the same path to climb a mountain, not everyone gets to the summit. Find a group with similar goals and core values and you'll be having more fun imo. Or find a worthy mentor if your ever interested in taking your game to the next level...maybe a youtuber you like that has bounced to the same genre of games you play, but again, not necessary by any means.
---
Different strokes for different folks! Slowly liking 76 more and more as I play. 
---
sorry the first is

# National Radio Astronomy Research Center
---
Tldr i don't want to grind for loot in a loot driven game
---
But if you have the ridiculously high defense you won’t take much damage or lose much health so the defense will still stay high? Currently the only enemy in the game with fully modded x0-1 Pa, that can really fuck me up, are the yao guais, idk why but they just are strong
---
Both of your boyfriends were negs trying to bring you down.  I'd put money on not just about gaming.  You are better than them both and not just at gaming.  Please do some research on toxic people and think about removing them both permanantly out of you life.
---
Probably right but I’d like to think someone didn’t know what they had and just got rid of it on accident lol
---
Same here, another pc stealth lady in it for the experience not just the xp! Pm if you want to team up.
---
Depends how mobile your camp is or if you are ok to move it. Because he is red it means that if you move your camp to the whitesprings the robots will shoot and kill him.
---
Leant that the hard way with my Mega Sloth.....
---
wtf
---
In on CST. Likely won’t be home until tomorrow around 1-2pm
---
How do I get a patio with a roof like yours? I’ve tried building up like that but pieces just don’t snap like they should.
---
While I believe it's too far gone for Bethesda to make two shot and explosive exclusive from each other, they should at least disable the bonus damage from demolition expert perk to explosive guns. Just make it a flat bonus increase, so it doesn't completely trivialize 99% of the mobs in the game so people actually have a reason to use/try other guns besides TSEs.
---
I got to about level 68 or so, and got really bored of the game. Just kinda gave up on it. My friend, however, is addicted to it, just like he was with destiny, whenever that came out. 
---
Regardless of the quirk and bugs, Bethesda have done an amazing job with the stories, so much detail and for those of us into this kind of thing the game is a goldmine. The level of detail in story lines and the design of the environment astonishes me sometime, tiniest details such as rock bolts in the mines, the timbers shoring up walls.
---
It is ashame that the reviewers of this game never seemed to notice anything beyond the pew pew and PVP. 
---
Again, agree on the patch and the lvl increase for gear. I've actually posted about it multiple times and offered a few detailed resolutions for many of the games current issues. But being a merchant in the game so far would basically consist of posting on reddit. I want everyone to be able to play how they want, but you'll get a better opportunity to be a merchant when they add the vending system (assuming its good). They just need to drop a perma-fix for dumping before they release that. 
---
But if you're stressing over the dupers, then take a breather ya know. Dont let them ruin your while day, that's how the terrorists win. 
---
So, major update on this due to comments and a thought striking me, particularly with bottles, as such I've made an attempt to contact SilverScreen in regards to said bottles to ask why the use of the plastic shells instead of the full glass bottles.  I have a feeling that, if I do get a response, it'll likely be due to the bottles being unable to be made, being to expensive to the point of needing to largely increase the price, or that they couldn't get it in small enough numbers for their needs and would have ended up sitting on a stock pile of them for the next decade
---
Dunno, martial artist makes Gatling gun fire faster
---
I don't even bother crafting stable except sometimes violet. You get a bunch for killing queen, which I do enough of to keep me with plenty of flux.
---
now i feel awkward asking for an invite :( my mate stopped playing but i really want to play with people...
---
I've noticed this on my alt A LOT. A lot of the higher levels tend to not give two shits about people lower level then they are and will just ruin their fun.
---
The biggest issue though is the lack of content for high levels. Most of the farming locations for materials EVERYONE knows about, tend to be in lower level areas or in low level events.
---
Most higher levels should technically be relocated to the lower corner of the map, but that would suck and no high level would stay around.
---
The map and the stuff the map has in it to do are VERY small .. Honestly this map is well suited for 4 people ... just about 4 people due to it's size and scale. Sure it can hold 24 people ... but then theres just far too much of an imbalance. I truly think BGS needs to think about making the map at the very least be 4x the size for the population on it and fill it with a lot of high, mid and low level zones and what not.
---
Good for you breaking up with those jerks.
---
Don't feel bad for playing how you want, I actually play somewhat similar to you, taking my time, exploring and leveling up slowly. You keep on keeping on and do what makes you happy. :)
---
Deal
---
Tagging for future self -- am working up an alt to L15, taking CHA every time (and HB 3).
---
Everything except 1 purifier and my bedroom door is left unlocked in my camp.   
---
One of the unintended side effects of the patch that replaced camps on log if you were kicked from your spot is that the process duped all camp items not "attached" within the camp buildings (purifiers, plants etc) it did this every time on log without notifying you. If the amount of duped items (purifier) reached a critical number the camp budget inventory bugs out and displays only one purifier which then can't be placed or deleted and contains the weight and budget of the entire stack...
---
I have (1) industrial purifier taking up 75% of my maxed budget which can't be deleted for over a month now.
---
In that time they have acknowledged the bug then proceeded to give (3) separate content updates to the atom shop.
---
So pardon my displeasure for the people who say "just don't watch YouTube guys, the games gonna be great, just give it time..."
---
A tip: if you don't like ppl then don't go to the most known farming spots.
---
You don't own the best lead farming spot in the game
---
It should not cost more AP since it is a legendary stat. It should only modify the ammo capacity. The drum mag is heavier though so I can see that causing AP drain.
---
Pro tip, fund a guy who wants to play games with you regardless of your skill level just so he can be with you. 
---
Upvoted primarily for the Crash reference! XD Nevermind that it’s oh-so-true. 
---
Your exes are assholes. For most games the only thing you really need to know how to do is have fun. 
---
Just melee bashing with a gun does this
---
wow so epic gamer girl whats ur paetron also do u sell f33t picz?
---
Oh please. Rule #1 of being a girl on the Internet is that you WILL be flooded with unwanted pms and friend requests if you tell people. It sucks, but it's a fact of life and to pretend that it's not gonna happen anyway is deluded. She could have posted this rant about her ex-bf on /r/GirlGamers or left "gamer girl" out of the title but she didn't. She tells you herself that she just ended a bad relationship a few weeks ago. Could it be that she's seeking attention and validation, as people often do when they end relationships? 
---
should be able to get banned for that
---
Not that I’m giving them a pass, but what Bethesda game isn’t filled with bugs on release? It’s a trade off for playing a game with this level of ambition and scope. Considering the infinite ways one can play this game, there’d be no way to game test everything without a 10 year game development and even then there’d still be some unforeseeable issues.  
---
When boy 
---
What if it's a melee weapon?
---
I'll have to ask if my wife had ingested any mentats before she bought the plans, but I know she doesn't have hard bargain equipped in her perks. She was level 18 at the time as well. Gave me a serious wtf moment when I had just waltzed my new level 15 all the way to Harpers with no luck finding  the plans and she just happens to run into grahm with the plans for somehow stupid cheap
---
Most people disagree. If you are going to play the game actively, that's one thing, but if you are going to simply sit on the server and let things collect on their own, you are just taking up space. That's why there is an afk timer. Unfortunately its very easy to beat an afk timer with software on your pc.

PIXELS\*
---
DreadfulTurkey here...
---
How dare you not be the best at everything you do, right? For what it's worth, my girlfriend grew up not being allowed to game and it's not surprising that she isn't instantly amazing. She appreciates the occasional bit of help and I appreciate that she wants to get into things that I like. What I'm getting to is I think you probably dodged a couple bullets here. Either they're not the supportive sort, or they take it far too seriously. Either way, they've missed the point that gaming is supposed to be fun. 
---
I’m sure it falls under Greifing 
---
-Pristine miner uniform is found in the lab where you do the excavator mission. And clean miner hat is found all over the Uranium fever mine. So even they can be taken off the list
---
Fuck them. Games are meant to be played how YOU enjoy them. Good on you. I didn’t take a scorch down until quite a bit higher.
---
My wife is a sometimes gamer and I’d never do that to her. Idgaf as long as she’s having fun. 
---
Different department or not, this is why a lot of us have lost faith
---
How?  Aren’t deathclaws melee only?  I don’t see one hiding in your base for half an hour waiting for a scorchbeast to land. 
---
I'll take the 1700 shotgun shells and give 2000 45. I just can't right now. 
---
Lvl 15 raider pa is a pain to find.
---
Cliff watch is where i got a few pieces. Then i played a bit, farmed a bit and server hopped a bit to try and finish it.
---
I'm now level 22 and getting close to better PA already.
---
Other times, you walk into a full minefield, which sets off in your base, obliterating it.
---
At my old camp location 4 mannequins would sometimes spawn in a circle, kinda creepy tbh. 
---
Whenever, I’m on all day today
---
nice. nice. what level is it currently? I'd really only like to confirm one thing, but i'll dm you from this point on. i dont really want this info being wide spread. some people know about it. i applaud them for not saying shit lol
---
Where was it? The person who answered your question has had their post deleted, but I would like to know where to get combat armor plans. Ty.
---
Will do! Thank you! 
---
As far as i know, until they add the option to adjust screen size\\hud, we are sunk.
---
You know when you see the "server no responding" on the right hand side of your screen off and on for a few seconds/minutes?  That's USUALLY dupers.
---
...since you don't seem to know that.
---
And that's just one way they're effecting us non-dupers.
---
When my wife plays, I make it a point to tell her not to worry about dying or messing up. It’s all part of the learning process and games are there to have fun. I don’t care if we get high scores or anything I just love that she’s interested
---
You need to take multiple perks like Evasion (+45) Barbarian (+60) and Ironclad (+50). You also need to repair your armor to 200% for the extra DR, and then on top of that need a legendary effect like bolstering for a low HP build or vanguard for high, both of which have their downsides of course. Then you need the right armor, BOS combat repaired to 200% is good, but I throw in a heavy metal chest which when reparied to 200% is almost 110 ballistic DR on its own.
---
That's how I like to imagine the military outside of Vault 111. Stoically protecting the vault knowing it will be their deaths
---
Nope, no vats.
---
His comment was about them pressing R to drop it. If you do that you dont have a claim to it anymore and anyone can take it. Low levels would just have to take off the pieces first.
---
Servers are still garbage, thats why you see a game already on sale, trying to salvage as much as they can before they really lose money
---
Blitzing is for your like third or fifth playthrough. Start Fallout 2, head straight south to the enclave saving frequently, grab the power armor out of the locker at the enclave base and any cool weapons you can find, go back up north and “start” the game with power armor. 
---
Need...more...adhesive...
---
I would laugh but I would probably console you, I wouldn’t be an ass about it. Yea people aren’t bad but you’re lucky to have a fucking girlfriend that shares something in common.
---
Nice find, and great Camp! What is the inside like?
---
I would say I’m good st this game but I get wrecked by scorchbeast. What’s your strategy? I’m a mellow character btw
---
This is pretty much exactly what happened to me last night.
---
As you’re exploring and doing quests you’ll run across abandoned power armor with pieces on it. That’s how I got my collections. 
---
Is it bad that I'm aggressively aroused?
---
She just said she’s not good, don’t be an ass. She said she takes it slow. Are you sped?
---
The servers dont crash like that anymore when the dupers do the glitch now. It's been patched, since you didnt seem to know that. 
---
There was a girl that visited my camp with wildman rag clothes once and said it was very cool, she had a really cute voice and i wanted to talk with her but im so shy and english isn't my native language so i dropped some stimpank got embarrased and went somewhere lol im an idiot...
---
look for Life Preservers, get springs AND plastic...AT THE SAME TIME
---
I loved the D2 sets like Immortal King and Tal Rasha. It would be nice if they add some sets for specific builds with a unique look to them. People love cool looking armor sets and collecting them, that are up there as the best possible thing to farm for. And knowing that one particular mob drops them is important too. So you know exactly what you have to farm to get it. And if you get an item that doesn't suit your build you can trade it for the one you need with someone else who got the wrong kind. I would be good if you could set up actual trades at the vendors, like instead of just having stuff for sale you could also add an item that you want to trade for. Like if you want to trade Unyeilding Raider Armor for Assassin's Combat Armor. Etc.
---
Sneak shoot is my #1 go to for fallout.  It’s just fun.  Use Vats like a champ if you aren’t so hot at FPS.  Try explosives you might like them.  This game is perfect for people who aren’t grinding shooter tournaments and matches.  The majority of my friends don’t play fallout because “the shooting is clunky.”  They aren’t wrong, it’s not a dedicated FPS game.  Fallout is still a great game.  
---
Social menu. Go to self. Hit leave world.
---
Will the item disappear from the shop? I haven’t spent anything so I have over 4K atoms right now
---
We know.
---
So your complaint is... it's annoying when someone shows an interest in your passion?
---
can someone not on mobile copy paste this, its fucking excellent material lmao
---
sure mate. you are right everyone else is wrong.
---
just look at the sheer number of people who have already purchased one from someone who duplicates, almost every other user who commented here and OP's post getting voted down into the controversial list
---
You're not the only one
---
Yikes
---
I'd kill SB's with you.   MY IGN is Uhland.  Add me.
---
Just do not bring you shity ex's along unless you want to hear me rip on them via mic non stop the whole time.   Would be a mostly negative experience hahah.
---
considering stealth archer is by far the most popular build in skyrim, i am baffled anyone playing a bethesda game has a problem with a stealth character.
---
Had an ex gf who used to punch me for winning. I stopped playing competitive games with her. Mortal Kombat was the worst one cause I've been playing those games since the MK3
---
Wow...it’s so fucking crazy that you think there are rules that girls need to follow in order not to be harassed in PM’s.
---
I agree - but since I wasted a night last night leveling an alt to get the handmade plans, I would be super pissed if they did it anytime soon lol. 
---
I don’t understand the reasoning behind the level restriction at all though. 
---
I think this was Maybe my second day in the game, but my friend and I made camps relatively close to each other's, but he was off, and some random level 5 walked up to my camp, while I was there, and they asked if I could open the door, so they could use my workshops and stuff. I opened up, let them do their stuff, then, after they left, I made an outdoors workshop. 
---
You can only see perks from level 27 for the 1st point you use, 28 for the next, etc etc. 
---
You can’t hoard perk cards in this game until after level 49. 
---
And what would duper gain from selling legendaries to vendor ? As he dupes he can just sell anything to vendor for that 200 caps even 200 bobby pins not to mention he can just keep drinking nuka cola.
---
This. I would like to know where to find a gamer girlfriend. I can't even really find people who play games (non-sports or non-CoD games ) in general. 
---
It is hard to justify to a girlfriend that doesn't game it is not a *nonsense hobby*
---
This was literally happening to me yesterday.. but dupers left before I could ruin their fun.
---
I'm not sure what you're on about.
---
Firstly.. Welcome up the wasteland..... Secondly, it's happy to see you being you... Thirdly, fuck people like that in your life... Fourthly, there are plenty of nice people to venture around with out here
---
Ya, OP is a socialist living in his parents basement.
---
Album Coveresque.
---
I like going around the wasteland taking very weird photos.
---
No, not most people disagree. This sub disagrees. This sub has decided on the 'correct' way to play this game.
---
The same shit excuse was used at launch. The reviewers weren't playing it properly.
---
The same shit for people doing PvP (something that is part of the game). They aren't playing properly and are being toxic trolls.
---
Guys building bases in Whitesprings? Nope, not really playing the game so just trash their stuff and they are the asshole.
---
The 'correct' way to play the game is to drop nukes on Whitesprings and then drop mountains of trash onto new players so that you can post about it here and get karma.
---
Not sure but I'm sure Google would know
---
There’s some near Rose on the top of the world and both high schools. I’m going to need a melee perk load out just so I can end up not needing 150 plastic every other day. 
---
Rule #2 of being a girl on the internet is running into people like you who seem to think that girls get whatever comes their way just for being a girl, regardless of anything they’re saying or doing. What’s that reddit? Niceguys? Incels? Not really sure what you get out of this, but you do you bud.
---
So my two ex boyfriend's both spent a lot of time mocking me for the way I play games. I don't rush into things, I sneak literally all over the map and never use Chems. I spend all my time exploring and collecting, and don't rush the main storylines or quests. I am, admittedly, not good at combat. When in active combat, I do rely a lot on VATS and just hope for the best.
---
Both guys always said, throughout the relationship, that I was shit at gaming. It got so bad that I didn't feel comfortable playing in front of either of them, not as a solo or as a co-op, because they'd end up shouting, taking over, or non stop laughing.
---
I broke up with my most recent ex-bf just before Christmas. He'd said not to get fo76 because I don't have time to play games (false) and it was to expensive to buy when I was actually just going to be rubbish at it. The night we broke up, I marched myself to the shops to go and buy it, red nose and teary eyed.
---
Three weeks later, I'm level 34. I'm still not good, but I love it and today I killed my first scorchbeast, all by myself. It wasn't easy, and it was only a level 40, but I did it!
---
I had that alot at launch. When the servers are under load they do that.
---
No. They should never had this ridiculous limit in the first place. You run out of space at level 15 and it hurts the game from then on. Fix it already.
---
No one was around, only my wife and me.
---
Lol it was not happening to you. It's not happening to anyone anymore. You should actually log on more often. 
---
Heh... this was just a bizarre case of someone nuking Charleston when I had control of the dump workshop.  The blast zone came right up to the edge of my space.  I used the 2-3 minutes to set up for this shot.  Totally worth it.
---
If it’s for repairs, hold out a few levels and spec into the overrepair perks. You won’t need them full time, just while crafting. 
---
I regularly see one near that spot in the mire where a town was lifted into the air by those vine things.  (i can't word this morning)
---
Every time I go by there, a mega sloth seems to be there.
---
seriously? why do you even answer this post ? just for karma right? here you have your thumbs up :D idiot
---
ok, about when do you think?
---
I did see a Two Shot Cryolator from killing a ghoul, for about half a second before the game crashed. It was also the first TS that I had gotten. Also the fiirst time the game pidded me off. Better luck next time, I guess.
---
What ever level the perk card has is the amount of special points you have to spend to unlock it. (Level 49 super duper requires you to spend all those points you saved on perks until you unlock it)
---
Sorry vault dwellers who took pictures of nukes behind them (some are absolutely amazing,  btw), but this is the greatest picture ever captured in FO76 server so far. 
---
Great shot!! The choice of bed and candles really add to it
---
What effect would this have, other than spreading TSE around even more than they already have been?
---
That basketball court is dope
---
Sneaky sniper build &gt; all builds. Orcs and power armor are for the simple minded
---
Absolute disgusting
---
yup understand that completely, Bethesda would have signed off on the final designs though and would have had to approve these designs before they were finalised.
---
I doubt very much they got a cheque from a company and washed there hand's off it, after all this is Bethesda's IP and of course the complaints haven't been about the actual Rum itself its the quality of the outer packaging.
---
If its got Bethesda's name on it they should take more care, especially as its there customers / fans that have suffered / unhappy with the product and situation.
---
good on you! i’ve helped with a couple SBs now (same level as you) and it’s really tough. 
---
take it slow, enjoy the story unfolding. 
---
Sorry to hear you were with jerks who pointlessly criticised you. That sounds like it kind of sucked. Good on you for standing up for yourself. I sincerely hope the comments in this thread help you feel better. Game on!
---
Bethesda seems determined to recreate every mistake all other companies have made while making multiplayer games, instead of learning from these examples.  
---
The weird part is they're owned by Zenimax who runs ESO so it seems like there should have been experienced multiplayer people under their corporate umbrella who could have provided support.  
---
And yet, here we are...
---
Lol Jokes aside i don't think bethesda is going to take incentives away from playing the game and move them to server hopping.
---
Kind of silly
---
So u single?
---
Haha. Done. Sent you a PM. You sound like a trust worthy person. If you don’t see it on your inbox, check your spam folder 😉😂😜
---
hopefully they would become worthless for mass duping
---
Ill be your bf :)
---
idk how the glitch works but would they have to do it 200 times to get those 200 bobby pins, vs doing it once to make a copy of the explosive handmade?
---
or is it even more abusive than that 
---
Exactly!  undies should be an in game item with a condition bar;  detergent and abraxo can be used to repair.  Why?  Because the cleaner your undies are the greater the disease resistance bonus they grant! Maybe even a charisma bonus when they are above 75 percent or a negative when below 30?  Or attract wild dogs and mirelurks?  Oh snap, or Super Mutants!  They already say they can smell you... so it would be completely lore friendly if dirty undies made them detect you more easily.
---
Had this problem, putting my TV into game display mode worked. Hasn’t worked for everyone I suggested it to though. Worth a shot if you haven’t tried it. 
---
T-51 is my favorite PA. 
---
I’m just stuck using excavator mostly due to carry capacity. 
---
I need to hang a sign that says this everywhere I frequent, just to help me avoid being a smartass to people. 
---
Thinking from an effort needed viewpoint for Bethesda it may be too much work for them to do a unique look for all uniques, and for a low player having certain items drop from particular enemies is perhaps too restricting and doesn't work with the current way how all sorts drop from any enemy.  And really do you want higher levels all contesting the same enemy that spawns in one particular place the most due to efficiency? 
---
However it seems like adding something into the calculation for legendaries, then have it pick from a table of possible uniques is much simpler and easier and thus more likely to be implemented.
---
After reading the approve, I have to say I actually find it harder using VATS mode because of how clunky it feels compared to the other games 
---
and highly active on r/fo76bazaar but doesnt need caps
---
&gt; That's exactly the same way I play,
---
Well this explains a lot regarding your recent posts. 
---
Great place, well done!   
---
Needs some screenshots taken from up there looking out, and maybe the interior. ;)
---
It's an ugly glitch that has happened in the past and is reemerging. I would bet it duplicated everything in your camp that was not on a foundation. Check your stored tab. You probably have multiples of things you most certainly did not build yourself. Hope this helps
---
I get the freezing effect on a TSE Cryolator I found, so I assume it's dealing it's normal damage as well. Decent weapon, doesn't quite compare to a shotgun though.
---
Personally, I would work the story, learn about the region and once you have a good understanding of mechanics, start focusing your character to a certain role and start leveling up towards it (I.e:melee, pistols, crafting, power armor, farming).
---
But they’re worth really isn’t what is the problem...it’s that everyone and their mother has every TSE available. 
---
You should make a Camp full of pósters of power girl and some letters "beat that"
---
👍You can totally trust me
---

Scrap the doubles.
---
Heck, let's take it one further and allow you to give your animal friends custom names. Lvl 50 deathclaw named snookums =P
---
Actually, yeah, this. I didn’t kill one of those flying balls of obnoxious bastard filled bastards coated with bastard sauce until I was like 45 and that was only because I stumble onto a SAM site. 
---
Every time that happens to me I scrap almost everything and restart. I usually plant about 15 of each plants, then when it's stored I end up with over 150 of each. Then theres a glitched water purifier that stored.
---
For me it's this glitch where I can place it, it even makes the sound effect of placement. It just doesnt build it. I have perfectly enough space and everything is green
---
I hate to say it but unless you have an amazing 3* pistol go rifles. And that is even debateable.
---
Pistols have no anti armor perks so it makes them rough overall.
---
I tinkered for a long time with a vats pistol build and you'd think the difference in AP cost would make a difference but it doesn't due to no anti armor.
---
And i have an anti armor vats crit western revolver.
---
Small magazine size is a problem too.
---
I don’t even run Demo perk and still destroy  early every mob in one shot with my TSE Gauss. My TSE Handmade takes 2 shots...
---
Check your terrain. I moved my camp to a mountainside, had to clear trees to place, went way over budget. I think it (terrain) counts or calculates into overall budget. 
---
Therein lies the issue, has to be a random spawn to be tamed, cant be a set spawn
---
Lmao what is wrong with your exes. Who cares however you play the game. As long as you have fun. 
---
Oh my god!
---
(Uninstalls real life) 
---
For more clarification I actually didn’t only delete cosmetics, I actually removed every one of my lights and generators for my house as well, still can’t place a thing more than 3 turrets (I used to have 4 at one point) this fucking sucks, stored tab is empty
---
Hello there! Tried Tetris yet?
---
NY Steezy thanks!
---
This is the kind of stuff I love to see. My wife plays the same way, and she loves it. Keep doing you! 
---
I’m pretty sure someone didn’t know what they had 
---
Nah I’ve been here for weeks now and have built a LOT more than what I have right now, its baffling me how little I can place out of the blue like this.
---
Holy fuck a nice guy in the wild. You forgot to call her a slut for not saying hi to you.
---
Overseer’s cache I believe. 
---
Thanks man, I'll get to it
---
Good for you. My girlfriend doesn't play games with me and often gives me a hard time for playing games in the first place so I can't really relate. But, I can't imagine ever being so disrespectful though, no matter what she enjoys doing. 
---
Good for you for clearing your schedule and good for you for playing how you enjoy playing. That's what video games are about.
---
Found the asshole.
---
\\[T]/
---
That already happens simply for 3 star legendaries in events etc. They could create long quest lines with access to an instanced boss at the end, or even just a locked building or dungeon or bunker or vault that you can only enter when you completed the complex requirements. And the current looting mechanics allow everyone who gets a hit in to receive the legendary loot anyway, so it's not much competition, unless you are one shorting everything, like some at Whitesprings.
---
Jebus, I'm almost level 50 and my knee jerk reaction is to still run from Scorchbeasts... Good on ya!
---
F those guys.. they're just dicks. You play how you wanna play games, and if any future bf gives you grief, tell him "suck it up, buttercup, this is how *I* play". 
---
I always prefer playing stealthy chars myself, and certainly am doing the same in Fo76. Ain't nothing wrong with that at all :)
---
I don’t see a problem with everyone having one. Other than PVP (which isn’t balanced anyway) how does someone else having a TSE affect you or your gameplay?  
---
Other than you not being a unique little snowflake??
---
Sorry Smoke. Wish I had some help for you. Like you said, "something new everyday."
---
It's more abusive than that, you can literally double everything in your inventory (beside quest items since you can't store them) and if you double / dupe it enough, you can gain 10k+ bobby pins with every single dupe.
---
It's just time consuming though.
---
Then perhaps the exploding bonus should actually decrease the damage because it provides AoE.
---
do scorchbeasts actually spawn at level 40? i've only seen level 50 SB's
---
Turrets are an alarm... not a gun, you silly goose. 
---
&gt; ferent department or not, this is why a lot of us have lost faith
---
He's right though, so what's the point in complaining if you agree?
---
Getting mad about the Atom shop updates is pointless and misdirected. 
---
It's the same as having your car being worked on at a dealership and being mad that there are guys in the Dealer's room still selling cars. It's the same principle.
---
Dude I got the game one release, level 40 when I saw my first and I bailed, level 60 when I had two attack my Camp, bailed, level 90 when I killed my first one a few week ago, so to you and all the players out there taking their time, who gives a fuck, go your own speed! Enjoy the game you want! And if any cunt doesn't like how you play, don't invite them to party.. also sorry about the swears, drunk Australian.. it's hard enough to write upside down.. give me a fucking break..
---
As long as you are having fun that's all that matters!
---
We could use the help!
---
Damn...I had such plans ;)
---
Always for repairs, as I can't seem to go very long without running into enemies well above my level that require a lot of firepower to defeat, wearing my guns and armor into nubs.
---
Awesome - thanks!
---
There are two types of reactions that guys have to gamer girls:
---
Those who are total assholes, and those who are so nice, they give 100$ items in Rocket League to them. (I've actually no joke, seen this.) 
---
Although there are a rare people, who are born with a gamer girl, who are nice.
---
I agree 100%... Ive been trying to farm for plans, notably distant thunder for PA plans, and ive gotten T60 motion assist servo plans at least 6 times, if I get a plan at all. Overall, ive gotten that plan over a dozen times, WTF am I supposed to do with all these duplicate plans? If they are as common for everyone else as it is for me, there is no market for them, and I cant sell them to vendors for salvage prices.
---
 I dont understand how this RNG works (or doesnt, more accurately) I know "random" in computing is artificial, but I feel like im always rolling a 6 sided die, where 5 of the sides are the same damn number.
---
I the only thing I have left to do in this game is look for plans, if I keep getting the same stuff over and over and over again, that is going to chip away at my interest in playing at all
---
Doing God’s work you are...  
---
I spent some time at WSR around lvl 15-20 trying to do the quests and farm some xp, but kept getting bullied out by lvl 100+ players...
---
Congrats on the SB kill. I did mine at 30 something, but I had formed an alliance with some missile banks the Brotherhood left lying around.
---
I use VATS proudly and with no apologies. The system dates back to Fallout 1 which was turn based and allowed you to select enemy body parts with hit percentages. Real time VATS is so bloody glorious I hope they put it into Fallout 5.
---
I run through crowds of Scorched, crippling their little legs with a deliberately underpowered pipe gun. Eventually, I have a parade of shuffling agony. Then I switch guns and end all their sad loser faces for I am Queen Death 👸🏻of the wasteland. Enemies suffer and die by my whimsy. Ah ha ha ha! 💥☠️💥☠️💥☠️
---
\*cough\* Anyway, sister, don’t let the testosterlads get you down. If they give you lip, tell them to hive off back to Quake or something. There’s a wasteland to reforge in your glorious, deadly image! NUKE FLATWOODS!
---
I tend to shoot first and ask questions later. I mostly use a TSE pump shotgun. Not much survives that.
---
Lucky OP, tfw no gamer bf...
---
My girlfriend plays the same way. She mostly just plays games to spend time with me. I would never imagine telling her she sucked. Seems like a viable strategy to me. I'm just happy to have a companion to quest with. Actually when we played Destiny 1 she did pretty well in the crucible. She'd always come in first or second when she pushed herself. I also agree that Donny should have lived.
---
Since you are level 15, you really should seek a vendor that sells the handmade rifle blueprint 
---
You will appreciate this tip after you are over level 20 
---
+karma 
---
You’re an idiot. I’m a girl speaking from experience not a nice guy incel. OP sounds like somebody who needs a friend. Having a pattern of dating guys who talk down to you and belittle your interests is not healthy. Assuaging your insecurities by seeking validation from men on the Internet is not healthy.
---
Yeah, you might be right. I dont have a lot of experience coding games, not as much as I'd like to anyways. Im a specialist in cyber security and digital forensics.
---
I wasnt really thinking from the point of view of implementing it into an existing game, rather creating a game with that system. (I have no idea why i was thinking that way lol). Implementing it would be hell on a developer, you're right.
---
Thanks for the constructive criticism OP!
---
Hey Bethesda cockgoblin
---
Go back through Beth’s hotfixes, it’s only when major websites etc pick up the story that they fix things pronto, anything else is left alone 
---
People enjoy games for different reasons. I like games that are interactive enough to be challenging, but at the same time, tell me a story like a book would. 
---
Some people eat food for just their daily caloric intake. Some people eat because they really enjoy what is in front of them. It's okay to not be one or the other. 
---
Well I didn’t so not everyone would know...
---
Is this how you stalk people? That also figures. You're basically a duper, that would explains pretty much everything.
---
Haha. Came here just to post this. Was going to say:  “Run to Watoga Train Station now and Server hop until you see Handmade gun plans” 😂
---
iirc they said they are open to it but it would be way down the line.
---
im still hoping though so i can play with my pc friends
---
Right lol
---
Why aren't you interested in them out of curiosity?  You wouldn't turn down an armor piece that gives you an extra 25% damage in all situations, but you turn down psycho which does the same thing and can be easily equipped in a hit bar direction to make your life significantly easier in a massive mutant fight?  I sell a lot of them but, but usually never psycho.
---
I bought mine from Camden Park's vendor.
---
I can't fathom the "gotta rush through and complete the main quest" mentality of some RPG players, especially in an open world, story driven series like Fallout.  
---
Hell, I pre-ordered Fallout 4, and have yet to actually progress all the way to the end of the main questline, simply because I go traipsing about the Commonwealth looking to find all the unmarked quests and the little easter eggs and such.  
---
Also because I mod the hell out of the game, mainly those adding new quests/story lines, and so forth.  
---
I also favor sneaking around and picking enemies off from a distance, though that has as much to do with the Gamebryo/Creation Engine being wonky about first person shooting mechanics and the controls being somewhat limited (like all your thrown weapons being hard tied to the grenade key, which absolutely ruins any kind of aiming for me, too long a lag between hitting the key and the axe/knife/whatever actually being thrown.)  
---
Sounds like your exes would be happier mindlessly running around in Cawwodoody or something similar.  
---
I haven't bought 76 yet as I was waiting to see how the implementation of multiplayer turned out, and I'm still on the fence whether I'll get it or not. I may eventually, once mods are officially supported, but until then I'll probably hold off. 
---
awh, look at you lil fella!  Jumping to snowflake and insults already?!  Did someone forget their juice box this morning?  Seeming a bit grumpy kiddo!
---
And the issue with TSE is they kinda ruin the game for anyone else around you.  As you absolute decimate anything, it can be difficult for others to get tags on anything.  
---
Thank you! So glad this is a sub
---
Honestly, I'd kill to find a GF who would play games with me, regardless of how she played. 
---
Gt Lanxmixpunk 
---
If you are still maintaining this:
---
- add a location northeast of 2, exactly halfway between Abbie’s Bunker and Thunder Mt. Power Plant (before the dirt road second path).
---
- add a location west of Lady Janet’s soft serve, after the ruined vehicle, immediately before the sharp curve, 
---
I know I am..
---
Offer stands still, will be on today exploring 
---
I think just nerfing the ever-loving shit out of explosive two shot fixes all of the problems. No more gaping chasm between weapons because the hideously overpowered weapons are brought back down to earth.
---
Holy shit this blew up! Thankyou thankyou thankyou for all your insanely lovely comments ❤️❤️
---
You know what girl. Good for you! You don't need that negative shit. Well done on your accomplishment. If you ever need help or someone to play with add me gt tako863, don't let no dirt bag tell you you're playing a game wrong, you play as you want to. Die 100,000 times. As long as you're happy and having fun is what matters
---
I agree it is a great idea. Yet it’s clear the game wasn’t built with that system. Adding that system would take a while.
---
You are fine... your just like everybody. We all are trying to come up with solutions to these issues. My quotes is based on time are based on my past experiences. I don’t know how the Creation Engine works for Bethesda. It could take longer and it could be faster.
---
Join us at r/fo76filthycasuals !! :D
---
I had a crush on a girl and at my friends party she swept the floor with in Dragonball Fighterz I honestly don’t think I’ve ever felt more turned on in my life 
---
Don't flatter yourself. You're not interesting enough to stalk. 
---
Yet here you are with the common as muck thumbs up pose! 
---
Reminds me of the broke subsidised government benefit claiming people that have no money for anything, yet still have a big screen tv

Yeah, you show those misogynistic pigs that you can game too! Men make me so freakin angery

---
I watched the [Post Mortem for Ultima Online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnnsDi7Sxq0) the other day. (the first MMORPG?)
---
And besides the fact that there was no experience on the team or anywhere and they had to solve issues as they appear, bethesda could learn a lot from their journey.
---
And basically regarding anything:
---
- communication (you cannot do this without staying close to us)
---
- technical (NEVER trust the client!)
---
- exploits (sometimes you can solve issues without breaking the 4th wall and even turn it into a game mechanic)
---
etc.
---
P.S.: Launching your first online game right before christmas was a recipe for desaster.
---
They where just jealous of you playing Bethesda games the best way. 
---
To slightly expand u/arosiejk 's point, Morgantown high school is my favorite for fast scavenging plastic. Partly because it's so easy by now (I'm 49, but it was true at 34) that you can bring an off-weapon (whatever you don't normally use, for me it's a 10mm pistol) for the few scorched wandering in there.   
---
Even MORE expanded - go in through the rear door. If you're looking at the front of the school, it's around to the right, on the corner as soon as you turn along the back. If you teleport to the school you're already facing the rear, so just go along the back of the school to the far end. Go through that door. There will be like 4 baby scorched in there. Grab the plates, the bowling pins, the golf balls, and the plastic pumpkins. There's  bonus wood blocks, toy cars, and a blast radius board game. Now,  you can be thorough and search the whole school, but if you just want a fast plastic run, go through the main double doors which take you into a hall way. Head to the end of it (not far) which is a cafeteria. Snag plastic pumpkins along the way. Snag plasticware on the tables, plus (assuming you're like most players) grab the trays for aluminum (and also because it's right there in front of you). There's a smattering of useful stuff in the back of the kitchen. Go through the back door in the kitchen and follow the little hallway, snagging aluminum cans and various bric-a-brac. Unlock the door you come to. In that hallway there's a door to your right. Go in. Get all(!) the microscopes, surgical trays, etc... then walk up to the chemistry workbench in that room and break all your junk down. You'll get 100+ plastic depending on how thorough you were (I here with cool perks the number is more like 200+ but I don't have them sooo...\*ascii shrug\*) and the whole thing will take you, once you've done it a couple times, \*maybe\* 10 minutes.
---
If this is a non power armour build you may want to pick up Ironclad \[END 5\] and Gladiator \[STR 3\] since these both give you extra ballistic and energy defence. Thru Hiker is an interesting choice but when it comes to food you can carry so much that some ends up rotting and only being good for fertiliser, pistol renegade might be better since it makes hipfire more accurate and can slightly up cripple chance. 
---
Also Blocker \[STR 3\] is good since most opponents do melee damage  
---
I've never had a mod autoscrap.  Does it happen for all mods with you or just this one?
---
You got your analogy wrong their; here let me fix it for you:
---
"It's like having to bring your car into the dealership because the manufacturer contacted you about a safety recall, then once at the dealership watching the scumbag salesman attempt to sell the same recalled vehicle to someone using the line "but now available in FIVE NEW COLORS" ... 
---
that's an appt analogy for the situation 👍
---
Uranium rock and then dark as a dungeon played while during the uranium fever event. Was truly something magical.
---
There is an event in the western side of Watoga (I think at the asylum) where we can turn on a sonic generator that draws in scorched and there is also an automatic surface to air missile system. The scorched try to bust the generator and the SAM site. It's like a tower defense game. It was my first time standing and fighting against scorchbeasts. I took down **three** with some help from another vault dweller. I wasn't expecting it to happen, but it did and it was awesome.  
---
Congrats. I still haven't gone after one solo in the open. I don't use VATS (Agi is kinda my dump stat), but apparently sneak attack critical hits buffed with perks can be wicked.
---
Yes I am surprised I was the first to make this advice too :)
---
Glad to see someone else wanted to spare OP the suffering to slowly shuffle behind a protectron

You don't need flux for mods as far as I know. They just say you need them in the ingredients but you can apply them without it.

I could agree with this too. Give us a reason to use any of the other 100+ combinations of legendary effects for something other than vendor fodder.

The only true way to play fallout is as a blind goon who's high on psycho all the time, running around punching anything it can
---
Such a shame I’m on ps, would have loved to play with your wife (..that sounded better in my head)
---
1) If they did it, it would easy as hell, same good as give out free  
---
2) If they actually did it challenging. Most of players in F76 sub would lose their mind, because F76 is already too hard for them. For them it is challenge to maintain their armor, their weapon. It's too hard if one is attacking their base and they have to repair it. Teleporting around the map is too expensive and PVP is too harsh.  
---
prime example why you should read your text after writing it

Take a break from the story mission do some stuff closer to your level. You level up, then you go back
---
Damn, why didn't I think of that?
---
Every once in a rare while someone links a niche sub that is exactly what I need right at this moment; thank you for taking the time. 
---
If you don’t how else do you know who’s winning the relationship?
---
Wasn't that the original plan?  And Sony was being noncompliant and kept insisting "PlayStation is the best place to play".  
---
Im on PC and would love to play with some of my friends who play on console.
---
I sell all my legendaries to vendors, two shots, explosive whatever. If I won’t use it, it gets sold. Normally at Charleston station that’s where I start my vendor runs in the morning 
---
I’m sure some get sold by accident but I’m sure others like me don’t care to keep every single weapon 
---
I just ignore hostility from other players. I paid for the game, too. We need a “flip the bird” emote. My favorite was two guys who started hitting me in my camp. I just kept planting my crops.
---
Just check the map. Even if no one is there it could have residual high level enemies, but if it’s clear of players it tends to be regular levels for me.
---
Try relogging had the same issue yesterday 
---
Good idea.
---
That's a pretty good nuke screen shot, yeah.
---
DAE SINGLE GAMER GRILL BETTER THAN DUMB GAMER GUYS AMIRITE?? XDDDDD UPDOOTS LEFT PLZ
---
This 1000x over. My gf and I agree we need a good hobby together apart from our normal routine, I would kill for that hobby to be gaming. She can be so bad I question if the monitor is on, wouldn't bother me one bit. 
---
OP sorry your exs were dicks, you made the right decision moving on. Enjoy fallout, check out fallout 4 and new vegas too.  
---
Agreed. I'm level 80 and even I have a tricky time with them. Those sonic blasts are blinding and its even worst when a second one joins the party.
---
Yup relogged a few times just restarted my Xbox actually, nothing :/ this really sucks because I had literally 10x the structures yesterday and spent a lot of time making it, nothing is working and my camp is bare as fuck. What the hell
---
I would love to take part in it, almost no nukes on prime in the scandinavian servers i am on :/
---
GT Spawn3232, but won't be on for another 2 1/2 hour :/
---
Have taken her down about 6 times, but after the holidays there are almost no nuke for some strange reason, and the servers i am on seems to be filled with lv1-10 players, strange....
---
If i do a lot of server hops i can sometime find a server with a prime nuke, but then the queen will already be dead, lol
---
Brilliant
---
Not using chems can make you, go from Goth...to Boss!! 
---
Haha. Didn’t mean to come off as a jack-wagon. I do appreciate you giving me a good chuckle. 
---
Full disclaimer, I did post that before my first cup of coffee. I feel much better now 😜
---
You have a valid point about one shotting mobs before other people can tag. I never use my TSE in events like Uranimum Fever and instead use a “normal” gun or Melee and let other people tag the legendaries before killing them. 
---
THANK YOU

---
Different game departments. This is commented on almost every post where they add something to the store lol
---
It’s all good
---
Farm ammo, use melee weapons for lower level enemies
---
I would like to point out that you are not shit just because you play differently, especially in a Fallout or Elder Scrolls game. These games you are meant to play differently, and I’m level 41 and still have yet to kill a Scorchbeast, so you are obviously doing better than me.
---
it's for the buffs, not the water i.e. muttfruit juice gives +1 agility, razorgrain soup gives disease resistance, etc many of these buffs you can stack (fill up on the buffs at camp and just take minimal of each type for refilling your meter/buffs when out)
---
Just how rng works sadly 
---
I totally agree. We should start with 200 in stash, but have the option to ugrade it through material farming, or questing.  I also think you should be able to build stash boxes and have them set to different categories if you want to.
---
Not necessarily looking for validation, more actually fucking proud of myself whilst having no real-life-offline people to talk about fallout with. But if that’s your opinion, cool, keep on keeping on :)
---
There was a level 100+ guy with a TSE shotgun running around too, initially he would contest the enemies being a dick by one shotting them, but after he realised I was helping someone get their hits in, he went off elsewhere luckily.
---
Part of the problem is there are only so many places one can go. Most of us need lead and steel for bullets. Now because a level 25 is in a place I want to go as a level 90 I must just sit on the sidelines and wait? What about my fun?
---
What the game really needs to do is introduce upgraded extractors for high level players.
---
I have just moved my camp to a "pretty" spot because the lead deposit I was on was a waste of time. 14 lead per however long meant if I did one or two gyms and stole all their weights I had a much higher haul than I mined, making mining worthless. 
---
I'm lvl 66 and I have yet to put a dent in a scorchbeast everything else is easy since I'm a melee build
---
Well done, I am glad that you managed to make the best out of a bad situation.
---
Keep on  with growing, and remember that games are meant to be fun!
---
No dude. 
---
Cave Crickets. 
---
People use chems? I only ever use med x when fighting high level enemies but not very often 
---
On this subreddit someone made a map of all the resource nodes, and when you place your camp near one the system makes the extractor available.  Set your camp on one of those, and go out adventuring, come back to about 10-20 of that resource waiting to collect.
---
For steel I used the node on the dry lake bed at the center of the map. Open landscape means your turrets have better field of view for threats, and you can go raid New Gad for xp, caps if there are super mutants there. 
---
Yes I do actually, I have a licence and I'm going to my lawyer and I'm going to have all you b\*st\*rds evicted. I think I saw him at at Slocum's, I think so anyway, regardless I'll be seeing you all in the Capital Courthouse when I can get past that damned Snally.
---
Possibly. Also its a great opportunity to shoot them down for stuff if you want.

You sound like such an unpleasant person.

Honestly it kinda already is, me and my friends payed 10 bucks and it's what? 8 weeks after release? That's crazy.

Heh. Makes sense. 
---
But is there a way to earn fast xp. Like perks?
---
They made legendary drops more rare now in the last update
---
yeah it's annoying because I don't think there's any fissure site near there one just spawns there because of the big bend tunnel I guess
---
It depends on what your perk layout is and what kind of legendary items you have. 
---
Nah, not quite 😂 just a girl plodding her way through the wasteland, talking out loud to herself and forgetting people can actually hear me. I literally screamed at a jump scare mole rat yesterday

No one is calling you into the Atom shop to buy anything. Hell, you don't even have to login to the game until you deem it's playable, so that's on you there.
---
Different departments. Different Jobs. Neither team's assignments affects what the other does. Complain all you want about the Atom shop, but it's presence &amp; updates aren't affecting bug fixes and general game-play fixes. Apples &amp; oranges all day.
---
i wish this BUG was fixed so people having it happen to them when they legit move their camp aren't treated like exploiters. It over budgets EVERY move and we have to delete full inventory or we cannot hook power lines up (they count towards budget)  
---
I really wish they'd fix the bug.
---
If you aim down barrel it has 0 impact, it seems to only affect hip fire
---
I used that to move my camp to a brilliant camp near a junk pile
---
You can still get complacent and mobbed. Plus in big areas you can get bigger and more spawns. That said, I mostly die due to self inflicted or environmental ... like being near lots of cars when I miss throw a grenade, catch myself with it and the 4 cars nearby. 
---
I’m not mad, just thought this was cool so I wanted to tell others.
---
Yea! He was ugly as shit, but he was mine

Another person told me yesterday that it could be wires. When you delete stuff in your base, the wires aren't removed from your budget
---
The game gets easier depending on the guns you have and amount of healing items you are willing to spare. By leveling up you get more of there and it should make it easier. Enemies get scaled to your level for the most part so it’s not like everything will be good in one shot territorry
---
And pick up the scrapper perk for more steel when you scrap em.
---
As you lvl up your budget does get a little bigger. You'll have to tear down old stuff to free up the budget again, but at least there's a function to improve it. :)
---
No it is not. I've seen someone one shotting (or two shotting, if you will) entire hourdes of glowing ghouls at WS during a nuke run with a two shot explosive shotgun. 
---
Sleep in your bed to get a well rested xp boot, it's only 5% I think but it'll help you out if you do alot within the 1 hour 30min you have the boost
---
Yeah seriously just scrap a bunch of guns and stuff. I’ve never had an issue with steel on any character.
---
No problem. I built my camp right next to one just so I could see it myself.
---
Stealth sniper is literally the best way to play the game. And so what if you're not the best player as long as you have fun? I can take the hat off a ghoul at 1000 yards and clear an entire fort without ever being detected. Yet I can't hit enemies for shit if they get within 100 feet of me, and while I can pathfind through the wilderness like a pro, my friends can attest that I have -5000 Perception while indoors (I get turned around in buildings easily).
---
My point is that we all have our strengths and weaknesses, and our own unique play styles. The only "wrong" way to play a game is to not play it at all. Or team killing. Fuck team killers.
---
Nope. After a while it becomes painful watching someone else be really bad at something you're reasonably good at, specifically if the mistakes they are making are easily avoided. Like they walk into a hallway. Stop walking. Turn 90 degrees and don't check for enemies. Get killed. Do this again 4 times and then complain the game is hard.
---
I'll play co op games with my wife all day and night but watching her do si gle player stuff? Fuck no, I just go upstairs and put headphones on so I do t have to hear her dying every 4 minutes.
---
She's gotten a lot better with minimal practice though, for what it's worth.
---
Try doing Scorchbeast queen on a hybrid. They’re nothing but a detriment to everyone else doing the event and they can’t pull their own weight. 
---
I can only think that it is a bug and not intended. There is no way anyone could have thought level  locking a plan on a vendor in an endgame location was a good idea. 
---
I'm working on mine, don't have a bloodied explosive rifle yet but my TSE lever is putting 2k out, this is with unyielding armor times 5, adrenal reaction, and radicool being my only low health procs so far. I'm going to get nerd rage and put emergency protocols on my xo1 for nuke zones. Off topic my build is unyielding/sentinels stealth rifleman
---
they are hostile so you can target them with animal friend and tame them
---
Yup I actually heard that too so I made sure to manually scrap wires when removing all that stuff and they didn’t do really anything to the budget :/ i’m really at a loss w it
---
Hey girly, what console you play on? I would love to play with you also!
---
My biggest disappointment with Fallout 76 (other than not being able to pause when I get anxious being an unexpected problem) is that there are too many enemies, too much fighting for the way I like to play. I just want to gather, discover, explore, build, etc. I don't want to fight, I hate the fighting part, but I feel like my sneak is broken; mobs almost *always* see me! 
---
OP dont listen to ex's about being good or bad at games.. to me gaming is about having fun with what game you got.. and if your enjoying it and any other games despite being good or bad then your a gamer to my eyes :D.. hope you read this  because remember, being a gamer dose not mean you have to be good at a game.. its about having fun :) if your bad at a game but having fun then that is amazing, if your good at the game then just as amazing.. i never compared gaming to how good you are.. but how much fun your having :)
---
I've read in 2 different posts that you need both maxed. Animal friend pacifies them so that you can tame them with wasteland whisperer. Also you have to escort your new buddy to camp or else he could die on the walk over.
---
Your an idiot.
---
They need to schedule it and let people know.  
---

---
Fantastic question, Kodemar.
---
It's no secret the Enclave existed prior to the Great War. However, the intentions and actions of the Enclave leading up to it are a topic of great speculation. Allow me to attempt to set the record straight:
---
The Enclave was organized prior to the Great War, and its members included high ranking political and military officials, as well as leading scientists and academics. 
---
These members were all part of a group of Americans who understood the world's critical geopolitical and natural environment and were perceptive enough to realize that, given the the state of the ongoing military conflicts over resources across the globe, nuclear conflict was the unavoidable next step.
---
These leaders separated themselves from a nation and world in denial and turmoil, hence the name "Enclave". 
---
The goal of the Enclave was to go underground (often quite literally) and stockpile what assets and resources would be necessary to rebuild America after nuclear Armageddon.
---
Who initiated this Armageddon is still hotly debated. Rest assured, it was not the Enclave.
---
I hope this adequately answers your question. Feel free to ask anything else that needs clarification. 
---
I guess I was looking for a place crawling with the tiny communist bots
---
Holy FUCK Cave Crickets are so OP. 
---
Level 34, nearly maxed out Iron Clad wearing a full suit of crafted enamel metal armor, with a fully modded Pump Shotgun plus maxed out Shotgunner (with expert). 120+ damage per shot, over 190+ base defense. 
---
I can clear out a super mutant camp relatively easily. Headshots all day long.

Two level 25/30 cave crickets killed the fuck out of me instantly right out front of Uncanny Caverns.

I'm level 30. I have the quest to kill 10 unruly golfers. I can't complete the quest because whenever I go to Whitesprings everyone is level 90+ -_-

I game with my Husband and it is the best. Everything with hubby is the best. Except grocery shopping. And that's how it should be; settle for nothing less.

---
bad luck, they just launched a missile 
---
With something like more power attack damage or swing speed, with +1 strength, all the damage perks, max strength and all the perks and consumables and mutations that increase strength and damage and all unyeilding armor. You can probably get the damage pretty high. I play with a build like that but it's not complete yet.
---
Anyway, just with adrenal reaction, my weapons, non bloodied mind you are doing double damage almost. Low health builds are definitely the top in terms of damage output. There's so many synergystic perks and effects it's awesome!
---
Wow its like im the male version of you in this game but still havent killed a scorchbeast as im am in level 20s. Just enjoy games and play the way you can and like screw any prat who says play everyone elses way.

Can confirm. Saw you in the woods the other day and took a screenshot.

Interesting, I run power armor myself 
---
Can someone give me a TSE gun lol I need something for ranged combat since I'm a melee build 
---
Great! Thank you both, will do! 
---
Good on you. Don't take no crap from nobody. You play how you wanna play. That's what these games are about!
---
Nah I dont want a gamer girl. She wouldn't have time for me.
---
Don’t pay attention to them.
---
I have 3 points in Char. Only have animal friend maxed and equipped.. tamed a Yao Guai 
---
Don’t know about dieing en route to CAMP but mine only showed up after a couple server hops, this possibly accelerates the journey 
---
We need a map screencap ASAP
---
Bloody hell those guys sound like jerks. Good riddance!
---
change server
---
I wish we could scrap those junk instruments to get the plans to build the real deal. I always thought that's what would happen because of us being able to scrap weapons for mods.
---
They are beyond map border as I wrote so I would need to be lucky to access them not only that but they don't carry anything as usually so I don't think they would give anything.
---
Got an instigating 2 shot Tesla rifle last night at the whitesprings Vendor, almost pooped myself
---
Go for the glory take on the queen! Take your time though! Shes a wild one and no shame if it takes forever or yah fail but im sure half the server will help atleast. 
---
Some ~~guys~~ **people** are extremely competitive so they rather shit on their other half to feel better.
---
Demolition expert and grenadier, yes. Fireproof, no. 
---
I have the opposite problem. I’ve been gaming for years and my gf is just now getting into it (now has her own Xbox) but is embarrassed to play around me as she thinks she’s bad.
---
Admittedly she’s not familiar with how to play games/use a controller at all but I remind her it’s a learning experience and she’ll get it. She just avoids playing around/with me for that reason and it bums me out :/
---
Fuck those guys, blast s'more shit :)
---
Is it 1400 Atoms for only 1 power armor skin or for all of the power armors?
---
not seeing it
---
is it just for a few servers?
---
Cool! Which one do you thinks a good melee weapon? 
---
I’m a 53 y/o gamer. What is RNG?  My google search has been fruitless (can find lots about RNG, just not what it is). 
---
Then dont read them, problem solved 👍
---
Right...... I was wondering if I was the only one needing plastic XD I got to a point where I had more lead than I could use(shotgun shells)
---
Well, with emergency protocols you take 50% less damage under 20% hp, nerd rage and adrenal reaction will both still be good, and you can ignore the armor, or farm it up just for the stat boost whenever out of PA like crafting and such.
---
I've sold 11 of them in the last 2 1/2 weeks!
---
Don't contradict yourself. And you know, every second spent looking at my post history is a second less you can spend farming and duping legendaries.
---
That sounds horrible, never let anyone talk you down like that again, please.
---
Grats on the scorchbeast kill, even dedicated gamers I know struggle versus these things. ;)
---
I know where I'm putting my camp now
---
Thank you both! Sure will do, how does it help? 
---
You are the kinda person I like in these games lol
---
But spawns do change difficulty inside a nuke zone...
---
If your camp doesn't get placed, just server hop and it'll get placed if the area is free. In regards to losing your items, it's not stored in blueprints, it's in the stored section. It's only blueprinted if you actually manually did that yourself (sometimes automatically depending on the structure if things are connected).
---
Just trying to help others find their way home.
---
Your game. Your life. Play your way. 
---
Glad to hear you're striking out for better tomorrows, both in game and out. 
---
you get the generator plans from Powering up the plant itself, the workshop is not necessary
---
That sucks. 2 noobs shot my Yao Guai and it killed one of them, but then turned hostile on me, I swapped servers hoping it would reset but he was gone forever... I like to imagine him still in that original server still chasing down that other ingrate all over Appalachia
---
&gt; lack of content for high levels
---
That is something I'm wondering about as I reach a higher level, people are getting bored I guess, improving the quality of PVP in the game should be a priority for Beth to keep people engaged.
---
Using Eve Online as a fine example, Bethesda could do worse than making areas *dungeons* that you go to through a cave or some such that are *Null Sec* like in Eve Online that are the wild west and suited to high level players who want risk and PVP with the possibility of really special unique items unavailable in the High Sec area *map.*
---
In Eve Online you could only mine rare minerals in *low to null sec* systems and this made it special although dangerous to obtain them. This might move high level player out of areas where low level players are going to learn and level up.
---
Why donate to the stream when you can just give her a tw octy?? /s
---
Yeah, I do that pretty frequently.
---
I drop meds, water, food, crafting mats, etc on the low levels around vault 76.
---
Last night I gifted a level 48 with a brand new set of raider power armor I got from a quest.  Almost forgot how to do it, you have to drop it from your inventory.  Kept deploying it and motioning for him to get in (which you can't...lol)
---
Sorry, I won't be on for an hour or so, I just wanted to give people more than the typical 10-15  minutes
---
If it's not there relog... DON'T place you camp again...unless you made a blueprint of the camp it won't be in the BP section it'll be in the stored section
---
Wonderful story of triumph! Hope goes out to all!
---
Yeah, actually i’ve been taking my time, every place i go i try to explore as much as i can, always collecting stuff and getting ready to level up i guess? i don’t know, maybe i’m too anxious about going out to missions without the necessary gear. Which role do you think is the best one? 
---
Sorry, I did know that, I just meant that you can't build them. Sucks finding a banjo or mouth harp in the wild and it's just scrap. I think they are the first thing I played, if there is one in that post just down from Vault 76.
---
You do you girl, sounds like both of your ex's were either jealous of your style, or just plan dumb. 
---
"You have to play the games our way or your bad" is the excuse of most teenybopper "alpha eleitist males" all over our genre. They clearly didn't appreciate how awesome it would be with a S/O that plays.
---
Fallout games (even FO76) are meant to be taken in slowly, experiencing the world first and the content comes as you explore. All those "alpha males" did was glitch, dupe, and grind thier way to "endgame" and are now sitting around complaining there is nothing to do.
---
You should also check out Warframe :)
---
You are more the hero the server needs, then he wants....
---
Just know there will be a bunch of others singing and dancing as you do.
---
The song that comes to mind is an oldie but goodie....
---
"nuke him till he glows,
---
Nuke him till he glows,
---
Hi-ho the dairy-ooh,
---
NUKE him till heeee gllooowwwwsssss!"
---
Yup what he said, and most of them come at lv 50. Since whitesprings gets nuked so often they’re good to have
---
There it's an accordion in the game but I think it's only scrap.
---
What company tea? It's rare af yes but it spoils so it's not a big deal if you passed one over. There's some quest that gives you one of them. 
---
They can be crafted but they require 2 honeycomb each which is a pretty rare ingredient and only spawns in a couple of places. 
---
Corn soup gives 3 ap regen per second. Company tea gives 10, making it the best ap regen food by far. 
---
Please add this! Bethesda doesn't want you to see any servers but the way the game works makes you totally aware of their existence. I just want a world that persists, like all previous Fallout games, and we don't get this with the current system.
---
Yeah, but what I was thinking is they would have added a small triangular piece so you don't need to build in even numbers to trim the roof nice.  The roof caps don't fit in well with the trims. 
---
You are a boss!
---
It happens if you don't have any steel scrap and you repair something that needs steel scrap. For this mod you usually just put the mod on right away, since there is a power armor station right by where you buy the mod. It doesn't cost anything to put a mod on a weapon or armor so there is no reason to wait.
---
My waypoint is right on top of alpha's. https://imgur.com/gallery/RtPQL09
---
Thank you so much! I’ll fix this when I get home!
---
When you die, do you respawn at your camp?
---
Then how do I show up on a new server and the vendor near by has 177 caps?
---
Damn, I didn't realize I had to build in even number tiles to look nice. 
---
You can't. 
---
[deleted]
---
I'd love a crazy hard long quest that allowed us to unlock a 2nd camp. 
---
Yeah I used to use them and now I never do..I will in my trap house down the line but for the most part not until they get fixed
---
Would it be possible for a level 90 deathclaw to be tamed?
---
r/whoosh
---
We won't be ready for a bit still!
---
I'd definitely be down for different boss creatures in different zones.  But they should spell out how to do it FIRST before implemented.  If there are conditions to be met, I don't want people wasting tons of time trying to figure out that you need to nuke the charelston fire department, wearing a clown suit, and dancing a jig........to get the boss to appear.
---
I had an issue with being invisible and it was similar in that I wanted to trade with someone. I discovered by trial and error that if I hit the change weapons shortcut button, the problem fixed itself. 
---
Funnily enough, you play the exact same way I do. The exes sound like the idiots I see on Twitch/Mixer that just rush headlong into a level 50 dungeon with a level 10 character and wonders why a trap they just stepped on one-shots them.  
---
And congrats on the scorchbeast kill! I still haven't done that yet, but I'm on a Skyrim kick at the moment. Going to jump back into Appalachia in a week or two.   
---
Keep up the ass kicking! :D
---
Should just be the event, also farming the workshops is a good plan source. Even if you dont pvp just taking (and defending it against monsters three minutes later) can both generate random plans as a reward.
---
Do this constantly and just server hop after i take a fee without building anything, 25-35 caps for the ones in the starter location for a set of random plans isnt too bad
---
You do that now.. when you are in endgame you’ll see them as nothing more than a bigger ghoul. Free gears, zero effort 
---
Added to album with waypoint as a reference where roughly they circle around.
---
I've been away from this place for event and when I came back they are still there.
---
Some of them are part of a random group event called "It's a Trap!"
---
When the event is triggered and you activate the tower is sends out a signal that causes a Scorchbeast to drop to the group. You then have about 10 minutes to kill it before it flys away.
---
If we are talking realism this map wouldnt be so green after only 25 years and be infested with giant flying super bats.
---
What lvl are you might have been me. No problem buddy!
---
Lol what's with the downvotes on several supportive posts. Are there gamer guys out there feeling intimidated and who have the same behaviour as OP's exes? 
---
Damn idk what else it could be. Do you have anything stored, or anything in the blueprints page?
---
How many caps? I'm interested
---
It can be part of a daily event. 
---
If I remember right they are use in the brotherhood of steel quest line. May be thinking of the wrong item. 
---
Level 28 here. Came across a level 110+ in the wild that wanted to trade. He indicated some bloodpacks, but I had no idea what to offer them for. Kinda felt like a shit walking away from him when he was probably only trying to help. Any advice?
---
It's not global maintenance. Periodically, individual servers will shut down for "maintenance". The notification you receive in-game is misleading, since it still displays while at the main menu after you leave the server. Just select "Play" again at the main menu to connect to a new server.
---
You have to be double the creatures level so if you're level 180 I suppose so
---
You're not giving us enough information! This is serious business! Screencap NOW! 
---
Team work, team .. work. Have a buddy launch the bike when your ready to film it. Stage it right and you got a big hit video. 
---
Do events, daily’s, and clear out locations.
---
Yeah - rad rats, cave crickets, and glowing ants are irritatingly beefy for being so small
---
Nothing stored at all. I do have some blueprints but I didn’t think those would have an effect but maybe I should try deleting them. Only have 2
---
Random number generator.
---
You say that but you end up giving them your physical copies of FF7 and the Brady games paperback guide so they can experience that and they FUCKING BURN IT AFTER THEY BREAK UP WITH YOU, ASHLEY THAT SHIT WAS WORTH A LOT OF MONEY AND NOSTALGIA. 
---
Which I also wrote. But their locations remain static. It's always the same amount in the same places.
---
Sad but true.
---
They make babies.
---
And one day you will find someone like my husband who openly admits I am better at Fallout than he is. He relies on my help to make it through the game. Though racing games and things like that, he has me beat through and through. I've been through something similar with an ex so you have my congratulations! 
---
I don't get d/c...I just get infinite loading screen 25% of my location hops..
---
You’re right, that was harsh. I don’t know you and you’re probably not an idiot. Have a good one :)
---
Good shit!  Those guys are complete jerks for acting that way.  Hope you continue to play well : )
---
Currently, explosive weapons still have the normal projectile damage, and then add the same amount of explosive damage on top. The explosive effect appears to ignore armor, so the practical multiplier is more like 2.5x, or 4x with demo expert.
---
To make this even remotely balanced, the explosive damage would need to *replace* the projectile damage, and ignore demo expert too.
---
One of the biggest issues in the game is how hard it is to find other players that are into the same things as you without needing to use a mic and networking with people constantly. Most players don't want to do that. The just want to pick up and play in their own space with minimal voice interaction. 
---
There's a perk in charisma that will boost your XP gain when teamed up, not sure by how much. I dont recall. Sleeping in a bed gives the well rested bonus, and I believe the canned stew (I dont recall the name of the item off the top of my head) that you get from the Feed The People event also gives an XP boost.
---
Best way to level up at that point, IMO, is hold some workshops (easy ones on the west side of the map) and/or join others defending workshops. In between that, do events that you know you can complete on your own. Not only will you get XP, youll get caps, items, and plans and possibly even legendaries. Doing some early on quests is a solid way to gain XP as well as plans, which early on the more you have available for your CAMP, the greater of an asset it becomes.
---
If you can get into an area with high level players, try to group up and tag the enemies to get some XP. There's plenty of friendly vets who wouldn't mind helping someone grind or power level. Finding a hazmat suit will let you get into Blast Zones, you can tag some enemies and the higher level players will just sweep through and kill everything. at lvl 15, you can equip the lowest level of raider PA, which can also be used in nuke zones or just help give a big boost in damage resistance.
---
He's one of the dupers and farmers who thinks there's no better endgame content other than farming legendaries and abusing glitches because it's a part of the game. Just so you know.
---
There is a point in the main story line that explains what they were used for, basically they are used to draw in scorchbeasts.  I wish we could repair them and use them at will instead of having to wait for the 'Trap event to spawn.
---
My perks seem to effect my stash, all my cores weigh .3 in stash due to one of my perks as well as my weapon weight reduced in stash from one of my armour pieces. Im on xbox maybe thats why?
---
Ammo type vending machine is fine.
---
I also want there to be radio beacons from fallout 4 that, when powered and activated, show your camp on the world map so people can find it, just like if you’re in a group. 
---
Thanks!!!
---
Get you “not a real gamer” garbage out of here 
---
You don't have to do the workshop at the power plant. Just ignore that mission if you don't want to take over the workshop. The "Power Up Posiden" mission is the one that awards generator plans. It can trigger once an hour and you might have to complete it more than once to  get the plans you want. Be sure, if you do it more than once, to learn the plans before attempting to do it again. That way you won't receive multiples of the same plan. Three different Generators can be unlocked by doing it multiple times.
---
Damn, I guess I better start leveling up!
---
It wasn’t. It only takes one jerk to ruin someone’s perspective of a group of ppl though and I understand how easy it is to ascribe intent to ppl’s actions.
---
Married gamer guy here. Would love when my wife plays. Sadly this is just a dream.
---
Okay I didn't say I agreed with how they did it so calm the fuck down.
---
Ive scrapped and rebuilt and nothing increased for me. Im at a point where i cant even place a single copper wire. 
---
Scrapping and rebuilding over 10 levels later still wouldnt let me place the wire...
---
So either it doesnt increase or its more than 10+ levels. No video or confirmation has been found by anyone playing the game..some youtubers went from 5 to 25 to 100+ and didnt note an increase in avideo I found. 
---
Awesome. I have a note pad next to my PC I've been using lol. This is a lot better thank you.
---
Its supposed to every man/women for themselves. Do what u have to survive
---
Cafeterias are a good place, they have diner trays wich give aluminium 
---
Shame you can't take the wing off and make a Sunbrella type awning.
---
What's your name in game.
---
Yeah it works now had to unequip starched genes and log out multiple times
---
Forgot those dudes. They're the ones who are shit at gaming. They are exactly what is wrong with gamers today, elitist assholes.
---
If you play on ps4 I'd gladly team with you and wander with you, that's literally all me and my wife do when we play together. (Yes I am better then her. A high level, but I dont make it known, or rub it in, or tell her she is trash, I try to give her helpful tips and pointers, but in all reality, shes a beast when she plays solo. And shes a huge fan of the fallout franchise.)
---
I didn't even know you could take creaturea yet so I probably would kill it Haha now I know and that's half the battle
---
Found a dead Deathclaw travelling merchant once, to this day I wonder what kind of wares he had before being robbed.
---
Traveling merchant you say... https://imgur.com/gallery/AzqWajA
---
Who hurt you? Are you okay?
---
The game doesn't really get easier as you lvl up, per se. What does happen is you find a 2 shot wep, or an exploding wep. After you find these the game becomes too easy. You're able to 1 shot glowing death claws and scorch beasts. But if you stick to non-op weapons when dinking around and exploring it says decently challenging. Enemies hit super hard at higher levels, especially if you aren't a PA build. 
---
In this case, the stash would just walk real slow so it's ok
---
Stash box: I’ll Fite u
---
Turret: u wot m8
---
&gt;So my two ex boyfriend's both spent a lot of time mocking me for the way I play games. I don't rush into things, I sneak literally all over the map and never use Chems.

They sound like the type of fallout players that run all over the map, don't pay any attention to the story, skip through dialogue and terminal entries and their main weapon is the fat man.
---
TBF I don't sneak in the overworld, but in any interior, I sneak.
---
Is the screen resolution thing ever going to be addressed? I'm kind of sick of having the edges of the game being cut off because the resolution is wrong.
---
Noobs running shit builds and preventing Scorchbeast queen kills because they do less damage than required to overcome the additional health and damage resist she gets per player nearby. 
---
Always seek to improve your own skills, but play how you want to play. Don't feel bad about yourself at all.
---
The fact that they berated you instead of encouraging you is beyond ridiculous. Most people would be happy to have someone that shares a common interest with them.
---
I was lucky enough to find a wife that is a gamer too. I would be ashamed if I were like your ex-boyfriends.
---
You are doing just fine, my stealthy friend.
---
Can we be friends? PC: @WorldsGr8stBoss
---
i had 15 charisma at one point
---
i have 3 now
---
I also did this weeks ago and it has not helped at all. Im at 11 days in a row being blue screened
---
Does it ever go under attack? Or can nothing reach it 
---
You may have found it. When you move bases, the game stores your stuff in blue prints. Idk if you moved or did it yourself. I would say delete them to find out.
---
Oh my god, so frustrating to read. Glad you got rid of those toxic neck bags. People give me shit for being a gaymer all the time, but I try to remember there’s REAL diversity in video gaming! 
---
Im going to set my camp there open, with no turrets to passively fight back. I dont have the caps tp be killed over a 1000cap bounty
---
I actually didnt know this until the other day. Thanks for sharing the info. This will help newer players.
---
Jammin’
---
Haha it's just crash *ba-dum-tsch*
---
This song plays in my head while I play without music idk why it's like my default fallout song along with I dont want to set the world on fire and the butcher Pete song haha
---
Yeah,  hopefully it's something they are working on. I have a few t60 mods that I probably wont use that you're welcome to have. Other than the shocks, do you remember what you're missing?  Once I get to my computer I'll message you with what I have. 
---
Sounds like you’re kicking ass. The only “wrong way” to play a game is to either not play or tell someone how they should play. 
---
You do you girl. If you’re on Xbox and want a decent human being to play with I’m ThatJerkBoxwell 
---
Hi five! 
---
I’ve killed... 6 I think now. My first was when I was around level forty. 
---
Mind if I ask how you did it? 
---
I was using the super sledge you get from completing the Mayor for a day quest, waited for it to land, and then heavy attacked it. 
---
That’s been my strategy for all of them so far, and it works so long as I’m not outnumbered 3-1.
---
Also, power armor.
---
This is not a reasonable request, IMHO.
---
Now get one with him on the monorail track.  Tell him to lose the PA - the risk of falling to your death is half the fun. XD
---
If we are talking realism, sneak wouldn’t exist in this game because everyone would smell like irradiated shit since there’s no way to shower. 
---
Simply solution, on any given log in you can queue up at the courthouse for farming rights to any specific area. Others who try to enter will have to queue twice to petition your holding.
---
I did and literally nothing lol wtf
---
I still say Bethesda takes about $120k / year and hires 3 radio DJs to actually stream to players in the wasteland.
---
They made how many hundreds of millions off the game, launch alone?
---
Damn, I didn’t even attempt a scorchbeast until level 45 let alone kill one! That’s crazy impressive I’d say.
---
The point of this would be that just owning the card would have it apply to the stash.  Equipping it would apply to you and the stash.  Unequipped would revert to only affecting the stash. 
---
It is. If we’re the content then we are the factions and factions can war. But, what concerns me is where are the boundaries? I got no problem taking part in social engineering to run toxic players off this game, I’ll even find the battles and hunt entertaining. Gets my money’s worth. It’s just a matter of time before these toxic ppl try and pander themselves off as the victim and then Bethesda, Xbox, PS, or whoever drops a ban hammer on the real victim who was operating within the boundaries of being “content”. Too much grey. But I’ll enjoy it for now haha
---
they don't have your extensive experience releasing games
---
&gt; is not hostile until you attack
---
Is this confirmed?
---
I know you're looking for other opinions, but the real question is what do *you* think. The idea of something being ethical is soley based on one's own bias and opinion. 
---
An example of this would be weather physician assisted suicide in medicine is ethical as it violates 2 medical codes, patient autonomy, and physician beneficense. 
---
Long story short, you need to decide it it's ok because others won't make that decision for you. 
---
Hey it’s me!
---
This is by far the easiest method. Takes 3 bullets to kill a super mutant. Each gun you scrap yields you 10 steel. 
---
Awesome! I’ll add you.
---
Damn I dont know what else you could do. Theres probably something fixable here, just dont knkw ehat 
---
Easier way is luck of the draw and sadly most of us are unlucky lol I have yet to find a grand weapon well let me say I found a 3 star combat knife awesome rolls..sadly lvl 1 lol my luck
---
Try relogging now maybe?
---
Anybody know if this works for PS4?
---
I think that is it.  There is a dog/wolf spawn above it but they aren’t really a problem.
---
So I mean, did they make fun of you because you were a girl playing games, or because they thought you were bad at them?
---
Congrats on everything though, scorchedbeats are a real pain at that level.
---
I have one of those too I thought it was my friend about to dirty his underwear
---
Oh I know. I was just highlighting the part that I enjoyed the most.
---
I think I’ve seen it at Grafton Station, Harpers Ferry and Watoga 
---
should be part of the main quest line 
---
starts 400 then 600 800 1000 as we finish it 
---
I love T-51
---
the quest wont even update from the deathclaw. its just breaks and doesnt give me another objective. i restarted the game and did the deathclaw again and the same shit happened 
---
I always keep around 5 phycobuff on me and at least 20 in stash as it gives you +25* carry weight (not entirely sure of the number). 
---
I don't believe I have gotten an Assaultron circuit board from an actual assaultron. I did get one from scrapping an Assaultron blade.
---
Yeah, I never run low on .50 for long range moderate damage, but one visit to a nuked whitesprings costs me 400-500 shells. 
---
Fuck id be happy to get my wife to play anything other than mario kart with me :P
---
I think lots of girls would like games if they were introduced properly. Skyrim was my gateway into eventual hard gaming because of a lot of the reasons OP mentioned.
---
My husband gave me the game, and a week or so to just let me get introduced. 
---
In Skyrim:
---
* You can make your own character look and have a lot of control over the look, with an option for a female character.
---
* I hadn't played games since super Nintendo. The extra axis of control was hard. I was able to explore a beautiful world to learn the controls.
---
* Enemies are intimidating and combat is scary. Sneaking helps you scout out a bad guy and snipe them off at your own pace.
---
* You get to collect flowers. How cool is that?!
---
* Perks let you explore and develop your play style. It made me more confident, which led me to other styles of gameplay.
---
That gave me a smooth transition to fo4, which led to a lot of other FPS games.
---
As a girl, I also caught a lot of tell from other girls. I'd justify myself by saying:
---
 Rather than watch tv, where you're watching other people do things, I offered to look at the screen and decide what I wanted to be doing.
---
normally I drop items and dance about it using the follow emote and aiming my gun at the bag till they notice 
---
I use legendarys now. But combat knifes or switch blades are great.
---
To answer your other ones, melee works great for lower level supermutants.  I typically use .308s against mid range levels so I don't use up my good ammo. (.45, .556 and shotgun shells) high levels I just use my legendary weapons to make it quick.
---
For power armor, you just got to hunt for it.  But there is a map you can use (https://fo76map.com)
---
To get legendarys, you can sometimes find them from vendors.  But it's recommended to kill legendary enemies.  I've seen a few low levels (5-10) that might fit your needs being a low level.    I'd recommend teaming up with someone level 35+ and tag enemies and have them kill it.  It's a great XP boost and an easy way to get loot. Especially if it's a legendary enemy.
---
Okay, I'll check it out \^\^
---
Had many randoms come into my camp to trade and the only time a pet attacked is when they panicked and shot first
---
I am currently trying to get it, if someone wants team up! (PC)
---
Please.... is that the best trolling you can come up with? You’re probably salty cause you’re one of the toxic. 
---
nice thanks
---
It would cost thrice the price of other emotes in the atom shop. They want 150 atoms for the "unimpressed/angry" icon where all other icons are only 50 atoms. 
---
Bastards... But I would buy the finger emote. 
---
I feel like the way they are going to fix this is dislocate the explosives perk from the legendary effect there by severely gimping all these weapons. Course that depends if the code allows for such a thing to happen
---
And also it doesn’t take “hours” to farm wood and steal to build your camp. I understand it’s the principle, but it doesn’t take long to farm enough steel and wood. Less than and hour max. 
---
Hi, I know this thread is kinda old but I was wondering what you found to be the best setup for your TSE handmade.  I just got one and was primarily going to use it against the SB Queen, (although I'm growing fond of it against other creatures as well.)  
---
In searching Reddit, I've come across a few threads that you started with some good information.  I was going to use the prime receiver, but then realized the ammo will be tough to craft, and it looks like it isn't really worth it.
---
Anyways, if you don't mind, can you tell me what mods you ended up with on the TSE Handmade, and which perks you use for it?  Have you tried it against the SB Queen?  I normally use non-automatic rifles, but my TSE Handmade came as an auto and it's pretty nice, so I could probably go either way.
---
Thanks.
---
I have never played fo76 but played skyrim and new vegas similarly, just exploring stuff and not really looking for a fight. Its meant to be fun and that means different things for different people. Enjoy gaming however you want to and ignore idiots who say you are doing it wrong! Congrats on scorchbeast kill!!👍😉
---
they make the scorched beasts land but only in the events 
---
Oh wow glad that didn't seem to be an issue for me yet. I do hope they get around to fixing some of the issues this game has.
---
Omg your dumb , The only valid one on there is maybe diablo but then again you had 200+ hours of fun because you redid stuff over and voer again but I cant name 1 ONLINE game that you can enjoy forever for 60$ sure some are free but they have even more rediculous prices for skins, if no one bought skins we wouldn't have the great games we have today. So if you want to be ungrateful to the great stuff we get and shit on them wanting to get paid your pretty much scum in my books.
---
I love T-60
---
&gt; The only out I gave them was them handing over their vault suits as a means of apology. 
---
Here's hoping you took a picture of what sounds like an epic scene ending a story of hard fighting!
---
Congrats! I'm glad you kicked those toxic assholes to the curb. If you like using guns try putting a recon scope on; it will help keep track of the scorch beasts (or any other flying enemy) when they go behind trees etc. because the targeting icon persists for awhile.
---
I drive my friend a bit crazy because we play together and I find a theme and tend to stick to it. First character is a Mistress of Mystery so no armor, no power armor, mostly hitting things with my sword. If I'm doing a high rad area I'll swap into a radiation suit but that's it. 
---
I'm super blessed to have the wife I do, she has never been a gamer but the fallout series stuck to her and we have a blast exploring together.  Guys that shit on their s.o.'s play style have no idea what they are trashing and dont deserve a partner willing to game with them.
---
I just don't get the whole "I wAnT a GaMeR gF" thing when most guys just shit on girls for playing games. I'm so confused.
---
They're like super mutant Usain Bolts. There is no escape.
---
What I did for a while was find a few places with well separated mobs. This allowed me to take them 1-2 at a time, loot, fast travel, repeat, logout.  Don’t forget that you can get a lot of junk from really easy kills from places you’re past needing. 
---
Wow geez you definitely sound like you know absolutely everything guess I better just trust your completely sound judgement that's fully backed up with soundproof evidence and not just a bunch of hearsay.
---
Girl you sound awesome and badass! Screw those guys, you play your games your way and have a damn good time doing it, that's what matters!
---
Also I love that playstyle. I dont use chems either, dont like the risk if addiction, plus they're my best source of income! And dont feel about about sneaking, I love using stealth in combat. Theres something so satisfying about taking out a bunch of scorched and super mutants without them even noticing you :p
---
some of those scorch pipe guns with the 25 mile range maybe..... seriously they need to fix those found one shooting at my base from so far it hit me and did 1 dmg and all I was wearing was a hazmat suit
---
If I were near you I'd give you a pat on the back. We have very similar styles of playing. I'd like to point out that because we don't play as Tanks that we always have a good stock on important stuff, like screws, lead, plastic, etc. Lol. 
---
My current boyfriend plays the complete opposite of us but he just has that talent for playing games. He's good, and a good 40 levels above me right now. When we play together he does laugh if I die a really stupid way or if I blow myself up, but he doesn't tell me I suck. Plus he enjoys having me as back up cause I always have stocked everything and knows I pay attention to our health/radiation. 
---
Find yourself a tank for a boyfriend who can appreciate your play style. That way you'll have a good guy AND(best of all!!!) you'll have a tank to take you places that have high level enemies and lots of deathclaws where you can explore while letting him take most of the aggro. ♡ 
---
That would be a great Easter egg. 
---
It will show up as the reduced weight in the listing but not in actuality.  You can test it easy.  Take off the reduction perks.  Move the item in and out of the stash and watch your numbers.  Reequip and try again.  You will see the stash uses the unreduced weight.
---
I first noticed this with bandolier. The one ammo weighs 0 on me but the pile has a weight of 1 in the stash. Putting it in the stash raised it by 1. Putting it back in my inventory kept my weight the same and reduced the stash by 1
---
The biggest one is the quest not updating, forcing you to restart it. And, again, if you dc because their servers are powered by arthritic hamsters, it restarts the entire thing. 
---
Again, it could be funny or quirky if their game wasn't a pos. 
---
Lets make a crew, Im a level 60, my buddy is level 57 and My other buddy is level 60, my gamer tag is mid_nite_2006, sometime they arent online, would be nice to have company, I can help with the tougher enemies. 
---
In 75 levels I've gotten 2 of them.
---
Sounds like you've got shit taste in men tbh!  If you SO mocks you incessantly for something you enjoy doing then maybe that is a sign to dump their ass.
---
a join last server option would be nice give it a 1 hour cool down so to speak that if your gone over a hour it deletes 
---
Why would you log out without picking them up in the first place?
---
I'd like to see less reasons for server hoping as well like all plans are on robots compared to just random
---
also they need to stop this 10-25 lvl thing and just make it 10+ on recipes 
---
He in the red farm to food stand with a red coffee maker near the big red Nuka cola bottle in the center of the fair. There is also a dead settler in a lock trailer near by
---
Lol, I drop fertilizer by other players outhouses (or toilets if they have them)
---
I can easily complete a Scorchbeast queen with the group of 3 I play with. We did it with 5 people total (2 randoms)
---
Then, another time, we had about 10 noobs show up (level 30-70, quite obviously bad builds half were using pistols) and the same group of 3 couldn’t even get her to half health with 13 ish total people. 
---
That’s not heresay, that’s experience. If you suck, you ruin Scorchbeast queen for everyone else.
---
He lagged out
---
I'll be cloak stealthed in the corner laughing and watching them pull what's left of their hair out as they do battle with those s....l...o....w robots who keep asking for more evidence and documents :D
---
i didnt think it would mess anything up as it hasnt broken before, when i first built my excavator my game crashed and i rejoined the server and it had went back into my inventory
---
Where did you pay $10?
---
Glad to find someone else who is calculated in their approach when playing.  I used to live for end game heroics when younger but learned to appreciate the ride over the least few years.  Now I run around immersing myself in my surroundings.  So much more rewarding. 
---
Glad you moved on.  Hopefully your next bf will be a better fit.
---
Yeah. Was level 162...if I could play I would def be over 200 right now. 
---
Its a long walk to watoga.  Follow the rails to get to the station.
---
Handmade has an awesome fire rate with very minimal recoil. 
---
Sounds like u dropped that one so it would stay out longer and someone took it
---
Rotten flux is the flux equivalent of spoiled fruit/meat/vegetables.
---
Just a little update, so far the best luck I've had with radium rifles is from high level Honey Beasts, a few spawn during the Irrational Fear event and they drop some nice high powered guns.
---
Economy is so bad, that explosive weapons have becomes so cheap that there is no point wasting energy trying to sell them for players. So people just drop them on vendors. TSE is going for what now, 5k? 30+ days ago They used to be 25k or not even have a price as people wanted other TSE weapon.
---
As ranking officer of the US Army in WV, I have instituted martial law under the UCMJ.  Because we never received the all clear from central command, the UCMJ gives us...considerable discretion in punishments.
---
The US Army executes warrants for wanted players, as commanding officer I presided over their trials.  As, due to the exigencies of current events, we have no time to actually maintain or administer either trials or institutionalizations, the only punishment we authorize currently is death.
---
If you know of anyone who has a warrant on them for crimes against the state, feel free to let us know and we’ll give ‘em what for.

Radium rifle plans for sell here lol 
---
it was inside my buddies camp and he sat and watched it the entire time, no one could have taken it, he couldn't even take it.
---
We live in a society
---
No i was watching over it while he was gone
---
Yep I can second this as a TSE primed 50 cal user. You rip through her.
---
 Found that as well. Very interesting. 
---
I just want to let you know that we have the *exact* same playstyle for this game. I sneak about collecting junk, avoiding fights and just building shit. 
---
Don’t let the guys get you down, just play the game and have fun!
---
Congrats on the kill too :D
---
In Skyrim: * You can make your own character look and have a lot of control over the look, with an option for a female character. * I hadn't played games since super Nintendo. The extra axis of control was hard. I was able to explore a beautiful world to grapple with learning to use the controller properly. * Enemies were intimidating and combat is scary and loud. Sneaking helps you scout out a bad guy and snipe them off at your own pace. * You get to collect flowers. How cool is that?! * There is lore and story and morals that were genuinely interesting and compelling. * Perks let you explore and develop your play style. It made me more confident, which led me to other styles of gameplay.
---
As a girl, I also caught a lot of hell from other girls. I'd justify myself by saying:
---
Rather than watch tv, where you're watching other people do things, I preferred to look at the screen and decide what I wanted to be doing.
---
It actually happens very rarely..
---
Source: am female
---
You don't get notified.
---
I moved down to the second lake as the super mutants tended to bash my wall in on every return.
---
Must say that I'm also guilty of doing that. I have a Instigating Lever Action rifle and I can OHK a lot if I sneak. Sometimes I don't even care about other players that farm a spot if I really need a certain type of junk.
---
 I also sometimes refuse to help others in their fights, even if that means that they wil probably die. I'm even guilty of luring mobs that are chasing me to other players because they are a good distraction.
---
&gt;level 20 players with super sledges and power fists
---
impossibru
---
Honestly can't say that's how I play. I'm on my 4th play through of both 3 and 4 and while it is faster because I have a general idea of where goodies are, I still take my time and enjoy it. Guess another thing for me is going about things differently (like stealth, sniper, melee, and so on builds).
---
Gyms you say, what be those, better investigate.
---
I know, my OP was mainly in jest anyway, having players of all level interacting and affecting each others gaming experience is what multiplayer is all about, I actually now just join in and farm the high level spawns for the loot.
---
I love killing those mole miners, they may be cute but they make such a satisfying sound FX when I thwack them with my ski sword :))
---
Ugh. So much this. 
---
I don’t care what games you like. I’ll play Stardew Valley or Animal Crossing with you if it means we have something in common. 
---
Surgical trays and cake pans as well
---
Fort Defiance, Arktos Pharma for surgical trays. 
---
Wow, that's rough.  I didn't even know jetpacks were in the game until I found an X-01 Jetpack Torso for sale in a shop, on a whim I bought it just in case it wouldn't be there next time.  I am SO GLAD I did.   Jetpack combined with Marsupial is so much fun and allows you to find so many awesome locations with ease.  I've switched to a Power Armor build just for the jetpack.
---
I shot it a shit load of times with my level 25 combat shotgun until it broke, then shot it a shit load more with my modded level of 30 supressed pipe revolver rifle 😂 also power armour, else I’d have died instantly
---
That’s my experience.  My husband (we’re both husbands) play 76 together pretty much all day every weekend.  We both have jobs that keep us fairly busy, so it is so nice (for both of us) to kick back and explore the wasteland with a built-in game partner.  We also play a lot of games separately because our game tastes don’t 100% overlap, but when we both love something we even play some single player games together.  We just take turns (5th grade style) for things like RE-VII and RDR2.  I’m pretty sure we are the exception rather than the rule, though, as far as gay couples go.  But I’m grateful I found a guy that will play games with me!
---
It’s the query time and additional persisted information. You’re dropping number of players per server by almost 20% therefore increasing the number of servers needed (and associated spend) by almost 20%. 
---
Congrats! I’m a L41 guy who has a very similar play style (minus VATS - don’t know how to use it), and I’ve never solo-killed a Scorchbeast. So, congratulations on doing so - it’s no small feat. If you ever want to tour around with somebody, PM me, I’m on Xbox, and I just like touring around getting in random skirmishes, and looking for ways to reduce how much I carry. I’m probably horrible company, but the offer is there. Regardless - keep enjoying yourself, and proving to yourself you’re great without external validation.
---
Here's the UNPLUG ME post-it.

I had already taken this photo awhile ago but now it has new context. I fully support this theory and will make it my mission to take photos of more evidence.

Though it's not my husband saying these things, I absolutely understand where you're coming from. I'm female and I stream. It used to be primarily FPS games and some roleplay, now mainly roleplay again. That's the 'acceptable' thing for women to play, regardless of the game. It's unfortunate that it turns into such a competition between genders, and that there's *still* this pre-conceived notion that we'll be utter crap at shooting games.
---
Screw 'em. In my off time, I'm running around in WW2 shooter games that I love, killing people like crazy. I'll hit up military zones in zombie survival games and wreck an over-confidant idiot. The people that I play with frequently never give me crap about it, beyond our usual joking around with one another.
---
Find people that value you. The person that you are, and like to hang out with you. Your game play style won't matter. Play what you want and what you enjoy. Most importantly, ***have fun***!
---
Not sure. I found my first mouth harp in the creepy cultist basement of some church in the Mire.
---
Bro I'm pivoting this showing my age lol
---
Azensor
---
As a fellow girl gamer, I think you're pretty cool. Keep on keeping on. Maybe we can play fo76 together sometime! I like your style, and I'm lower level than you.
---
That’s true. I was just throwing a suggestion out there..
---
Thanks.  I’m currently compiling an album and have some more of him.  If you are interested, check the paintings in the room, as well as the Home Sweet Home location very close to his room.
---
Dark as a dungeon in any mines is magical! Somehow I think there is a higher chance to play dark as a dungeon is mines!
---
51 here, think RND instead, lol
---
Congrats, sounds like we have a similar play style though I generally do alright in combat. Even I haven't killed a scorchbeast yet.  I want to hear more about how you did it.
---
Is South Paul the one who lives on the North Pole? 
---
1. Price won't have any true effect on dupping as TSE weapons aren't the only, or more valuable item that they are dupping (re: serums, plans, materials, cola)
---
2. The ones with the TSE weapons for sale aren't the people people who are going to care about making personal sacrifice (caps) to "make a statement"
---
3. People who dup don't typically have an issue with getting caps (refer back to dupping cola)
---
A buddy of mine sneaks all over the place and he is fucking lethal. I can't count the number of times a well placed sniper round pulled my FO76 character out of a tight spot.
---
No after lvl 50 everything gets harder
---
I don't mean to call bluff, but how did those bags not go soulbound over 13 years? 
---
(Soulbound means only one person can use it once it's picked up, or equipped in the case of craftable items)
---
Just bought the game. What is your gamer tag? 
---
100%! What platform are you on?
---
&gt; They're like super mutant Usain Bolts
---
So basically Fallout 76 version of ghouls. They're comically fast for no fucking reason.
---
Selling drugs to VendorTrons all day, every day.  Keep 2 Addictol (you can become addicted to alcohol if your teammate has the revive-with-liquor perk and you die a bunch of times in a row.) Sell the rest.
---
Keep only weapons you use..and only 50 of anything else else 
---
LOL I got three last night
---
Only store broken down junk and things that u will 100% use. Armor, weapons, and chems will eat through the storage weight
---
oh gosh, it's a good thing caps do NOT weigh anything in game
---
Farm whitespring while it is nuked. Meet up with a high level player and nuke whitespring. Ask him to share the rad sponge perk. He’ll do a lot of work and help you get XP. You’ll get a lot of legendaries too. I got my shotgun there
---
That is pretty cool. Never seen The owl head piece.  Is that a Mothman thing?
---
It blows my mind that these kinds of guys exist. If you have a GF that truly enjoys gaming, EMBRACE that shit (and her, ya blokes). That's a rare gem and a relationship you should foster instead of torch. What total bonches these ex's are and good you booted them.
---
Theres one to the east of vault 76

We don't agree to prices in the apocalypse, you barter damnit

Are *Death bags* prone to disappearing like *dropped bags*? If so, they might not have taken it and you are now a wasteland serial killer.

Lol, I've been doing the same thing, I take my time, I hang back and snipe anything I see with my silenced sniper rifle because that's how I built my character. 
---
I've been playing solo since beta and I just hit lvl 40, mind you for a while I literally got stuck in Charleston for two weeks due to a crashing glitch and I don't use xp glitches to farm because I think it takes the fun out of the game, but I still take my time to wipe out everything before I move in and explore it in person. The summary of the story is fuck him for being a dick about your play style and good on you, enjoying the game your way. 
---
by 50 of everything else you mean like aid items right? Should i not bother storing armour as I have been?
---
Skyrim was also my introduction! I really need to get it on PS4 though, as my ps3 makes the sound of a robot having an asthma attack
---
"When in active combat, I do rely a lot on vats, and just hope for the best"
---
That line had me rolling! Good on you though for enjoying games your way!! 
---
I felt accomplished last night taking down a lvl 68  legendary glowing ghoul even though I'm only lvl 32. It was a good night. 
---
Anglers!  Every angler I killed yesterday had 2 excess adhesive.  I found a bunch near / around Thunder Mountain.
---
1) XB1
---
2) Doesn't matter

3) n/a
---
- Note - many of these things have been mentioned already, but I am mentioning them again anyway, as they are a source of irritation for me while playing the game.
---
4a)  Bring back the "Block" option.  You can only "Block for Session" via the social menu on the left.  The "Block" option was removed at some point.
---
4b)  When you store posters and rugs in your CAMP, they completely disappear and are not available in "Stored".  I've done this with a Tricentennial poster and a blue rug with the rockets all over it.
---
4c)  Auto-scrap wires when you store or scrap something they were attached to.  We have ghost CAMP budget being used up by these things.
---
4d)  Legendary enemies will still almost always quickly regenerate to full health after hitting them.
---
4e)  Multi-star legendaries should always drop an equivalent multi-star legendary item.
---
4f)  Please change auto-scrapping to not include weapon, armor, and power armor mods.
---
4g)  Please prevent the scrapping and sale of "favorite" weapons and armors.
---
4h)  When dying over-encumbered, please don't charge caps to respawn at the closest place.  I've died while (accidentally) engaging the robots at Whitesprings Resort, and it will routinely only allow me to spawn at the nearby power station or the nuclear waste dump site - and it will force me to pay 1 cap.
---
4i)  When playing in a team, team members will routinely be completely invisible or naked to each other.
---
4j)  Whitesprings Resort robots are still multiplying themselves.  After awhile, things start to lag.. and the server eventually starts to shit the bed.
---
5) n/a
---
I had this exact problem several times while trying to build my version of The Combat Zone (check it out here: https://youtu.be/MMfRL77tr3s).  I also built near a power plant so that I could light the thing up like a Christmas tree.
---
The system they have now is great. If your camp can't be placed, you need to leave the game and reenter new servers until it can be placed. If you invest loads of time init a build, don't ever move the Camp anywhere else! Your buildings should be stored if do move it yes, but getting your camp back up exactly how you had it before will still be super tricky. 
---
The more effort you put into your camp at one location, the more you need to make sure you never move it. 
---
Hopefully now that you know how the system works, you'll feel far more confident in investing loads more time to build something very intricate. With the latest updates, camps are far more secure and there's no longer threat of losing them as long as you keep them in one spot. 
---
You can sleep and play instruments, they both give +5% so you can have at least and extra 10% 
---
The next blinky fancy hippi skin. 
---
Blackbird was the only serious PA skin till now. Maybe Tricedential. 
---
alright cheers, should i just clear out my aid section then as currently its just stuff im not using?
---
I had the same issue at one point. 1) if you have too much junk (like over 400 of a material) start bulking, and then selling. 2) you may be hoarding things that you think are useful but probably aren't, such as gear. I remember I had like 14 missiles and 5 mini nukes stocked "just in case", but I'm level 54 and still never used them. 
---
Im sorry these brain dead high horse people are downvoting you. Its not your fault that you didn’t know the gun was duped. You paid your hard earned money for it so it should be yours.
---
Actually it was the two headshots that did it.  The opener was intentional and let me get around behind him, but the second when he’s turning and gets staggered again was luck.  Otherwise this would have been a very different fight.
---
To be honest, he should have just dropped them in a bag on the ground and waved you over to pick it up. If he was offering them to you for 0 caps then you can just take them. Over 110 he should be fine without them and there's honestly not much you can offer up that he doesn't already have. Hope you're making it well in the wasteland!
---
Great! Actually that was another doubt i had, what kind of ammo use with every enemy, this helped me a lot! Thank you sou much!
---
Lol. So true
---
It stands for Randon Number Generator
---
There's nothing wrong with being sneaky and using VATS. That's how I play every Bethesda game. Give me a bow/sniper rifle and max stealth  everyday.
---
Officer cocken bols reporting for duty
---
Idk. What did [this guy](https://imgur.com/a/jRt7g0d) have to gain?
---
That's how I play too. You aren't letting others dictate how you have fun. More power to you! My fo76 name is the same as my Reddit name if you want a friend.
---
Right!
---
I dont get it. Why in the world would you rush through a game that is literally a Master Class on Environmental Storytelling? "Its the journey, not the destination" is literally the case with Bethesda games. No way would I rush through this experience. 
---
BTW, laugh all you want: I'm only level 31 and still using Stealth a lot!
---
Doubtful.  Sony's stance didn't change. 
---
They just allowed it for fortnite (with restrictions) so its a case by case basis.
---
I suspect Bethesda would have to demonstrate they can do it and not impact the experience and allow opt out, all of which i don't think their capable of doing.
---
Plus let's be honest here, a vocal minority would want and use it.
---
TIL that ICBM stands for InterContinental Bike Missile. 
---
Ya, pull out anything u don't use on a regular basis and sell it
---
Take it you found the staff room and then duped them? 
---
That does make sense...
---
Some kind of PvP/PvE/RP server matchup would be pretty good, yeah. I agree. Especially when it's only 30 players per map.
---
Because I landed two headshots that result in stuns.  Pretty satisfying way to turn an ambush around actually.
---
You can easily find them for 2k, 5k means it would have to be a 3 star with a pretty good third effect.
---
hahaha, nice :)
---
More like stuff used to craft..save stimpacks and rad away and sell and dump the rest for now..upgrade through hiker and that will help
---
I limit most junk items to 50 or 100, but don't limit springs, screws, adhesive, ballistic fibre.
---
Cork, bone, ceramic, wood and steel are way to come by, but all this depends on your play style, armour, weapon, and whether you enjoy base building. You'll have to work out what junk you need to fit your needs.
---
Also, chems drink, and food weighs a lot. 
---
I don't keep spare weapons or armour, barely repair them either. I make new ones or just use better stuff I find out in the wastelands.
---
On ps4.
---
They *can* do that by standing in front of the people with TSEs. That is how *they* have their fun in the game when someone else ruins it. If those people don't want to die from it, maybe put the TSEs away or it will keep happening.
---
See how it works both ways.
---
I thought we were talking about afk farming, not expanding our entire life's problems into an issue that has no relevance. None of that has any bearing on idling vs playing the game.  
---
I clearly pointed to several examples that show the gameplay intentions oppose idling around. Since you don't want to argue those points, have fun being angry and bitter I guess.
---
I just looked at your profile. I'm on XB1. But there are a lot more of us than I realized.
---
You're assuming that because some lower level new players attempted to raid with you and you're an elitist that can't play well with others that hybrid builds all are worthless and trash. You're mad and hurt over, what exactly? What is it really? Did someone take your vision? Stop you from walking, breathing, living? I'm sorry but what's the actual problem and how is it really affecting the fact that your shit experience doesn't explain all builds including good hyrbid builds
---
Isn't this......already well known?
---
I have some for trade or for caps don’t ask for hand outs
---
Use a spot light. Helps alot
---
So i've also been seeing a lot of "check out my nuke screenshot" posts and thought about doing my own. 
---
My idea was to PLAY THE GUITAR with a nuke going off BEHIND ME (or in front) in my camp which is in THAT. EXACT. LOCATION..
---
you stole my thoughts.. Maybe next time i'll just blindly take a random photo without thinking
---
Or you can say "opinions are like arseholes, everyone has one, and theyball stink" haha
---
No idea what you mean by not updating could you ellaborate?
---
Entitled much
---
Your so demanding. I've just been dumping extras so figure plenty of people are doing the same Reddit Enforcer 
---
Ok, is nobody else noticing a NEW fastnacht mask?! THERE ARE more than just the man! Where found????
---
Right? If you can power through those games without power armor or chems then I don’t fuck with you, and gladly welcome you on my team. 
---
As a player who doesn’t like using chems and power armor, I know it can make life a lot harder. I think the only chem I use is buffout if I got too much junk with me and *happen* to find a bottle of it. 
---
I just must be VERY unlucky 
---
Never keep 50 of any aid item. Sell those.
---
Awesome. Keep at it. Once you get a lucky drop legendary weapon you will melt them
---
"Team mate". Aren't you the lucky one
---

Back in my day (so a couple months ago, shortly after release), my buddy would regularly tell me that I was naked despite having clothes on.  So even when I thought I was looking good, I wasn't.  He sent me a pic or 2 as proof, one time playing a tuba.
---
Just a modern day professional stripper who's a little too good at his job.
---
Sugar Grove is always a great place to go for their pencils, pens, and clipboards. Glorious lead, plastic, and springs.
---
Quest objectives not updating. As in, press the printer to get a number, you don't get a number. That sort of thing. It's not specific to that quest either. 
---
Not to mention to random roll-backs. Which is why you can't get off without risking having to restart a quest. 
---
The last group of anglers I encountered were at the golf course workshop and ten levels above me in a group of five or six. I think I died at least three times trying to wipe them all out. I need better weapons before I take them on again. 
---
Oh we're at that time of the day again
---
Good on you! — I sneak around the whole map too and I don’t even know what chems are. 
---
That’s wise thinking.  They do like to hang in packs... :/
---
Look at the preview.  There are different designs for the different models, all in the same package.
---
Yeah, it will.
---
Nothing new.   
---
Next up!   
---
With the number of issues in the game? Honestly, not really. I would say this is an "emergency" situation for them. They can't rely on modders to finish their game for them this time. 
---
This reminds me of that holotape of the guy who watched the bombs drop from afar
---
Okay, never had these problems myself so i dont really know what it feels like
---
Yea, this happened to a person I was escorting through Glassed Cavern. I think it's some kind of visual bug.
---
Hey man I gotcha I may not be able to give them to you tonight but I do have some extra plans! Workbenches, lights, armor, guns etc.
---
Honestly fallout 4 was just so easy I often left my power armour behind to challenge myself. The reality is that I would often not even notice because with it or without it, the game was still to easy...
---
Can you tame the Mothman?
---
Are we playing the same game? I'm at level 151 and have yet to find anybody trying to force pvp on me, even when I take all the workshops I pass by. I'm shitting stimpaks left and right, and I give out stacks of 100 to anybody I find at train stations who sticks around long enough to let me drop them. 
---
I traded in my Vita to purchase the game. 
---
Nice :)
---
I added a primary capacitor to my gauss last night, DMG went up a bit, and that is supposed to be a  Scorched Killer, but didn't add any star..
---
No clue, havent seen it done yet
---
Sweet man. Im happy to share any extras I have as well!!
---
I could be wrong but I'm fairly certain that your crops are instanced to you.  I seem to recall a friend looking my crops but I could still loot them myself.  Though that may be due to us being in a team at the time.  
---
I accidentally shot someone’s wolf because I thought it was a mob. Quickly realized it wasn’t after I got a bounty. 
---
That’s screwed up. I’m sorry that they were so mean to you and I hope that you have good luck finding better lovers in the future.
---
Me want owl mask. =o
---
Nice one!
---
This sounds like a beast of a weapon! If you post how much it's value is or how much your best offer is ATM, I'm sure that would help get you more engagement (I used to trade weapons and this is what it takes to get the best sale price in most cases). 
---
In my opinion the PvP in the game is ruined by explosive round weapons, so I ban them in the PvP events that I try and run. Anyone on xbox one that wants to try hunter vs hunted or any other PvP mode is welcome to get in touch to join us! 
---
Thanks!  THAT ONE I know. Lol
---
Don't. Drop. Stuff. That you value. 
---
This exact kind of post appears here every 6 hours. Why won't people learn? 
---
Today on real talk :We will discuss people that spam buttons like scrap all then whine about losing their mods on the next episode of you are a dumbass. 
---
Later in the segment we will discuss the fact you do not need any mats to put a mod on but you do need the perk if it calls for it.   
---
Followed up by your story smells like rancid shit and are likely an attention seeking whore.   
---
I'm honestly surprised i had to come this far down to find someone saying congratulations.
---
Its all RNG. Been looking for Deep Pocketed Combat armor plans for weeks now. Can't wear my BOS Armor till I find it
---
We have become the NPCs D:
---
Charlestown workshop is good.  Build 2 extractors
---
I honestly left it behind because on my first play through of the game I found myself with over 70 fusion cores. And that was with constant power armor use. Literally never exited it except to fix it. After a while of this I got bored of always being able to be a walking tank so I was like “meh, don’t need this shit anymore” and proceeded to collect every power armor I could find and put them all on display, each with a fusion core. 
---
I'd be down to sell you some this evening if you still need
---
This. Congratulations on doing some good self care! 
---
My wife plays like you and I love it. I like playing with her and just following her around into every nook and cranny in the game. If she gets in a fight I watch her back. 
---
(Sadly the game makes her motion sick so she couldn't play for long.)
---
Keep taking good care of yourself!
---
Oo, thanks!! Now I can stop blowing myself up 😂
---
How do people get pets?  I know about the various wasteland whisperer and pacify perks, but I thought they only lasted a short while?  Don't they wear off after like a minute?  Haven't actually used them yet.
---
Or is there some other way to get a pet?
---
No as Sony is a cockstain upon the gaming community. They caved on fortnite as they saw their concurrent user base drop and go to PC after their fuckery with cutting you into different accounts. 
---
Storage is a meandering river in my experience.
---
My early rules are collect adhesive,aluminum, copper, plastic, springs,screws,gears and a few other rare mats.
---
The common stuff i keep at around 100. If i get tonnes of lead or steel i make ammo out of it.
---
Why i say it meanders is eventually i was packing 150+ of the rare stuff so i had to adjust.  I didn't bulk/sell it but i actively didn't grab every single one i found.
---
There isn't a simple solution but if you monitor your junk intermittently you can avoid long bouts of storage management.
---
How did he get in? 
---
So the big "Press E to survey" didn't tip you off? 
---
I paid 20$ for it two weeks ago. Bought it for seven CS:GO keys and a P90 skin from a key reseller on steam. Worked without issue and was a US key so they must be buying them in bulk from some vendor to resell. 
---
Seriously! IDC if you're bad at the game, but just getting to share my favorite hobby with someone I care about would be the world to me.
---
He can't stay in his power armor forever 
---
My exact feelings to a T haha only i have yet to make a Treehouse, only a house around a tree. But seeing that location, i felt the same way. "You guys get to build with it! Afraid ill do ya one better??" Haha
---
And don't fix the bug where you join a server with 2-3 people who log off and then no new people ever join. All teh lootz.
---
Actually nevermind, bad idea... 1 minute later "you have disconnected from the server".
---
Note: If you're a melee build you will need more Stimpaks, unless you have some other healing perks that make up for it. 😅
---
Melee builds should also keep all Disease Cures since we get up close and personal with baddies and will get diseases all the time. (The perk that does 30 percent reduction of this and the rad x disease reduction thing barely helps)
---
First one is the hardest, keep kicking ass
---
Should definitely be able to save "decks" of cards, this needs to be officially implemented asap. Unnecessary micro management on top of survival micromanagement mechanics is a bad look. 
---
Adhesive farm is the way to go. Corn, Mutfruit, Tatos, and purified water. Use the green thumb perk to get double yield from plants plus maxxed out super duper and you will drown in adhesive. I had to stop tending my farm because i have too much adhesive now.
---
Only the larger one.
---
The other day I was dropping my first nuke while eating a bowl of ramen, also taking a dump, fixing my car at the same time (needed a new head gasket), and recieving a blowjob from my beautiful wife! All while my step son was cheering me on in the background! I felt like I was climbing the tallest mountain in the world with 70000 lbs of gear on my back! So accomplishing I felt!
---
It’s all personal opinion tbh, I like CQB builds that are close and personal and I’m a brute so I have all defensive points (no power armor). But after level 50 you’ll be able to mix it up a bit
---
They didn't even start out all that great :(
---
Lol if you would have said swap then I would have been a little easier so many just ask for free stuff instead of helping each other if you would like to swap some I have countless plans for the camp stuff
---
I notice that in expired nuke zones some robots will appear in place of ghouls. Sometimes they even drop legendaries. It's weird.
---
You can close a locked door.
---
Sure they can. What do you think laws and social consequences are? This game is the wild west, and just like the real world the community can impose consequences on those who behave in a toxic manner. The toxic can either continue to behave poorly, give some of us enjoyable free content, or quit playing. Either way, fun for me. Welcome to reality.
---
Sound's almost as a miracle to people, oh well it happened to me 
---
Went from level 20 to almost 30 because of people wanting to help out starters and also give us a headups on what we'll be facing in the coming future
---
And also have encountered a stranger who randomly came inside of my C.A.M.P and gave me a handmade rifle as a gift
---
People on this game are mainly nice and sound are on the opposite side of that
---
You'll probably encounter many gwiaefers in this game tbf anyone does, getting baited by one is also a ridiculous choice on the other hand for you
---
There have been more than two updates, and more scheduled. Your facts are fake news. 
---
I have my CAMP down the road from 76, most days I will see a new player and run over with my welcome pack (plans I dont need, food, water, some sims and of course 10mm Pistol and some ammo) - made a few friends out of it :) I think this is one of the reasons that I enjoy 76 so much, the fact that 99% of us wish to help each other :)
---
Once I got past level 50 I started messing around with other play styles besides the one I usually go with and I must say that stealth sniping is alot of fun. Clear out a mutant camp without being seen once and you feel like the angel of death. Only down side is it takes awhile and could much more efficiently walk in and beat them with a power fist. 
---
You Go Girl!
---
Good! Well, playing against stronger opponents and dying a lot is the best way up for your skill, so either PVP or PVE whenever you have the chance.
---
CmonBruh what did you call me? 🤔
---
If they were an item, then they could be removed, and then the game becomes something slightly more disturbing.  Randomly coming across some guy fighting a Deathclaw while his junk flaps around in the wind is not exactly a scene I wish to see.
---
They have already fixed a large number of the game issues before the new year; the few issues left will be ironed out within the next few patches. There are people complaining about everything from the bugs to already wanting more content; not everyone can be perfectly pleased. If you give them time they will fix this game up to being the least buggy of all Fallout games in time as well as the one with the most content.
---
I agree with you pal
---
I physically cringed at this. Holy fuck
---
Everything after 50 build-wise is just refining or re-arranging, while the enemies keep going into the 90s. So just raw levelling isn't going to put you completely above everything. Of course once you're bedecked in level 50 3-star legendary gear, a lot of stuff becomes kind of trival, but that takes some effort in itself. Depending on your build, you'll probably have all the raw damage perks  by ~40.
---
Enemy levels aren't exactly the end-all of their challenge either. High level scorched have a ton of hp, but their armour is just trash tier, so cutting them down is a lot easier then a Deathclaw half their level (a lot of scorched are also idiots who try and fire shotguns from sniper range, which neuters their damage).
---
Scorchbeasts mostly seem to have a very questionable hitbox, or actual full on damage resistance while flying. I dunno if its just that they're that high up, but when they do land its night and day how much damage you suddenly can do to them even using the identical gun you were trying to shoot them in the sky with.
---
Ran into a couple of griefers last night. One provoked me and I bit and fought back...for exactly the time it took for the other guy to whip out an explosive shotgun. Lost that round. The rest of the time, I just let the guy whack away at me without ever reacting. I never took real damage again, and it seemed to really piss the griefers off. Win-win.
---
Buffout here and there dont count.
---
That being said, I gave up chems for 300% regen.
---
Never going back.
---
Lol sorry I should have been clearer.  Just trying to be a reddit fallout community! I'll be on later. Reloadin462. Maybe we can get a group to all swap extras
---
Honestly only spot worth nuking. The only thing I don't like about this game RN is lack of end game content. But hopefully that will change soon. 
---
Thank you, saved me some atoms
---
People like to farm for legendaries , since all the ghouls there turn to bloated glowing ones , great xp too 
---
Got my set from Graham.
---
Issues that do not effect everyone.
---
Unfortunately bethesda can blame ppls network if ppl like me can stay online, crash free, for hours on end.
---
None of these places worked for me on multiple servers. Ended up finding some south of overseers camp at the chicken icon on the map. Found 2 around the tower there then switched severs and saw another one. Had no luck with rivers and farms. 
---
instruments increase your AP regen by 25%, not XP gain
---
Damn that sucks, hope you find someone who just enjoys playing with you if that’s what you’re into!
---
Scrap it, you will end up with a little extra budget also. My camp is over 300% what a normal person can have because of Bethesda's "fix". It used to be you had to either go without power and you had a ton of things to now you have a ton of things scrap them and boom magical extra budget to build as you please \[Example\]([https://i.imgur.com/QFrmBh0.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/QFrmBh0.jpg))  
---
I have lights on the side and rear of the building also most say free food - water as I just wanted more lights out to change later. 
---
3 inside the mall, 1 out in the car park
---
Because high-level ghouls spawn en masse there and are relatively easy to kill.  An hour of farming there can easily net you 5 levels as well as several legendaries.
---
They are a permanent atom shop item. 
---
And yet I get downvoted for pointing out that this is already a well known method to get a 4 star weapon.
---
Because for some reason other areas don't seem very rewarding. I personally haven't and am not going to nuke that location or Fissure. I'm going to be trying other areas until I figure out if they really did make other areas actually pointless. Or if there are some secrets waiting to be discovered.
---
Good afternoon!
---
May I ask how to join you, never got the queen ..
---
I am gauthijm in Fallout 76 as well
---
I have discord as well
---
Take care!
---
Jean
---
Shh, don't give away my secret.  I like to do this when someone locks their base and I just wanna check it out.
---
One time, I did this to sneak into someone's camp and waited for like 10 minutes, crouched with my cameleon armor piece.  And when they showed up, I scared the crap out of them.  I was amused, to say the least.
---
Cringeeeeeeee
---
I had the trap event a few times, could never activate the trap.
---
The more you know
---
Sorry to hear that. Exes suck.  Here's something a lot of gamers dont understand( which I think is kind of funny):
---
Games are meant to be enjoyed. Not everyone obsesses over every achievement, not everyone wants to be the best pvp'er. Some want to collect, some want to explore. That's the beauty of a game! Play how you want, it sounds like you already had a more immersive experience than they did. 
---
That's exactly right! In every game I join, nobody is ever at the PvP events, and playing one of these events with one or two other players is never going to be as good as full teams. 
---
At the moment, hunter vs hunted radio radio just doesn't work as nobody ever joins at the same time and who the hell wants to run around listening the same annoying message over and over for hours while they wait?? Nobody. 
---
So yeah if you're on Xbox one and you want to try these PvP game modes, the only way is to connect with someone trying to arrange the games like I'm doing. You don't even need a mic, as hunter vs hunted is an "every man for himself" style match. All you need is the list of players looking to get involved. 
---
What is TSE?
---
Who cares if you're good or bad? What matters is that you enjoy it.
---
I don't think that's bad.
---
Consistency is good.
---
Not to mention, Bethesda most likely couldn't handle a request of that magnitude without breaking enemy spawns altogether and making the game temporarily unplayable.
---
This goes along nicely with the "some of you don't like other players killing things with TSE weapons, get over yourself" Both statements are accurate! 
---
Cheers :)
---
Sure np 
---
If you scrap your fusion gennie you get what - a couple rubber, steel, and maybe plastic? Pretty sure scrapping random cars and appliances gives nothing.
---
On the ps4 there has only been TWO updates
---
I was in the area for that mussion for Rose and wandered over. I immediately regretted this decision. Luckily, I found some robots doing some maintenance on the wall and they saved my ass.
---
I've gotta agree with the other reply, this is a bit ridiculous. I'm all for giving them the benefit of the doubt that they have plenty of work to do and these big issues aren't that easy to solve, but black ops 4 had an equally shitty launch day. They had daily updates for like a week, including over the weekend, hotfixing major issues and trying to fix the constant crashes. They already released a DLC and an operation almost a month ago. It's not an apples to apples comparison, but this is a game from an equally large studio that cost the same amount of money and yet has such a lower standard of support. If you have issues like the damage bug that we had for well over a month that prevented people from being able to access a large amount of the end-game content, that's something you put high priority on and work overtime for. If it can't be patched within a few days then at least a status update has to be given to the community for something that serious. 
---
This has probably been a true story on many occasions. 
---
Except for the ghoul slayer part.
---
Don’t forget that Misc. Tab.... gunpowder and ores weigh a lot
---
Then you haven't played many games.
---
And to add to that the drum magazine on the "quad" does not increase ammo capacity at all.
---
Sorry for the potentially stupid question but what do you mean by cell? 
---
I just dropped some stuff since I was over incumbered and fast travelled to my camp and now I cannot find the bag.. 
---
I know theres been people talking about finding undetonated nukes and I'm not sure if it has something to do with nuking other locations, I've never seen it happen at whitesprings and a long time ago I remember someone mentioning that you have to launch a nuke for it to happen. 
---
I love the map marker idea. Could also have some kind of "status" we could set for when players hover over us. 
---
I hate those people...
---
Wait are beavers non hostile?
---
I've been shitting on them from day 1
---
You could ask around on Reddit.
---
Pretty sure there’s a social menu where you can see other players in the server
---
Home! My fav sub. 
---
Run to White Spring clubhouse, then plop down CAMP somewhere close by, then make molotovs, when high lvs come by to kill zombies, nade the bunch of them and wait for the mobs to be killed, loot, log off and serverhop to the next server, rinse and repeat.
---
basement of clubhouse has gulf skirts and dress, those go for 25 caps each at vendors (7 faction vendors, each refresh their caps ~20hrs or so after you sold).  Theoretically you can make 1400 caps a day selling to vendors.  Save up 6-20k to buy a TSE weapon, then farm clubhouse some more, until bored, pretty much.
---
Are you of level for nukes?
---
Ign rampantrifleman
---
It's a good way to farm XP and legendary weapons.
---
That’s how I started playing Fallout 4 (I usually don’t ever play any type of shooting game- usually stick to Mario games, Pokemon, Animal Crossing, that kind of thing) and over time I’ve gotten really good and don’t rely on VATS much at all!  So kudos to you. Play the game the way you want to play and have fun doing it! That’s all that matters!
---
The spawns there are bugged(?). Respawning at insane speeds and don't seem to ever stop. Which in turn generates more legendary enemies faster then anywhere else.
---
I'm assuming bugged because the robots pile up too. Literally to the point of crashing the server if you hang out by the front door.
---
Which might be a secondary point, nuking Whitesprings makes the to wipe out the server crashing robot heap.
---
So, does that make me a girl, because that's my play style, as well. I explore, collect everything, search every corner. I try to take enemies down using stealth and from distance, and I use VATS semi-often.
---
Fine by me.
---
I LOLed hard at this!
---
Fellow lady who married the dude who does not think I'm shit at gaming ... but even still, I think I surprised him at how good I can actually be, which he only finally saw when we could team up in FO76. 
---
Good for you! 
---
Male, currently lvl 139 and i still run from the scorched beasts. I have a better chance at killing them now but rather run if i can avoid the fight 
---
“Least buggy of all fallout games” are you kidding me? Whilst New Vegas crashed a lot it never crashed 5 times in an hour like FO76 😩
---
Until you get multiples of, say, Pick Lock.
---
&gt;So the big "Press E to survey" didn't tip you off? 
---
That doesn't show up when you're looking at loot on the floor.
---
I wouldn't say you're bad at games because you're not good at combat, your playstyle is just different to them and stealth is always great in a Fallout or Elder Scrolls game. 
---
Tbe reason its "way down the line" is because they are waiting until they arent winning over xbox any more. until such a time crossplay wont happen
---
You killed a scorchbeast by yourself at level 34? That's amazing! I'm a level 40 and I don't even dare to get near those fuckers.
---
Appalachia has its own version of the dulcimer. Did that make it into game?
---
That’s what she said
---
asking in reddit &amp; discord servers is an option.
---
You could also possibility interact with strangers, It's not that bad tho.
---
&gt;there has only been 2 updates
---
There's been more then 2 updates. Not sure where you're getting your facts from.
---
ok, im out. will have more shotgun shells in the future to trade.
---
The mama dolcha event feed the people gives food that boosts xp
---
Agreed!  I wouldnt mind a sub or portal to specifically view camps and bases.  Or as you said, weekly contests. 
---
Second this! Literally have the exact same play style and would love to play with our girl gamers!! I’m also on PC so PM me if y’all wanna play sometime!
---
No video no proof, head back to the kitchen.
---
Also a gamer girl and also the exact same play style, lol. You are /not/ alone and the /only/ wrong way to play is to not have fun! And anyone who tells you differently doesn't deserve your attention. Period. I mean, the /literal/ definition of ”to play” is "to have fun" so as long as you're having fun, to hell with 'em. 😉
---
I’m absolutely an elitist and I’ve done all the calculations. Hybrid builds SEVERELY deter you as it is impossible to hit the higher echelons of damage if you are dual-specced. That’s how multiplicative modifies work. I’ve done all the math and worked the numbers, I do for every game I play, and I spend hours even planning a build before building it. I’ve looked at all the options and possibilities and I have not found one hybrid build that even gets CLOSE to what a focused build can do.
---
Hybrid builds also cannot hit the numbers required to carry their own weight during SBQ. Again, I’ve done the math. So unless you go respec for a focused build before doing SBQ, you’re just hurting yourself and everyone else around you.
---
Yes, shitty players take away from my in game experience when doing Scorchbeast queen. They take away from everyone’s. All they do is mooch and expect to be carried. Why is being upset about having my hard work launching a nuke and the thousands of rounds I have to waste trying to carry multiple other people unreasonable?
---
Why I said almost.  If it's a enter this side exit the far side it will work.  Usually it will get you to the exit, if the exit/ goal of the near is located in the middle then at worst the wall technique will return you to the entrance
---
I get this quite often as well on PS4 when going into stash or vendors list. One thing I think helped reduce the occurrence for me was to wait a few seconds for the stash or vendor list to load before navigating within. I usually wait till the image of the highlighted object in my stash or vendor stash displays and stops twitching before navigating around. Not sure if this will help mitigate this issue for any of you until if/when Bethesda fixes this.
---
Yeah, I've seen them too. Just west of point pleasant, there's some kind of bridge if I remember right, I could see them from there.
---
Because you sold something to a vendor in that group. Each vendor is placed in one of 7 groups and all the vendors in that group share a cap pool. 
---
At least now my Combat Zone Camp (check it out here: https://youtu.be/MMfRL77tr3s) no longer disappears. 
---
If they didn't perform maintenance and deliver updates, we'd have a much longer list of things to complain about
---
*cough cough* u/BethesdaGameStudios_ *cough cough*
---
Guys just shit on others
---
I say my friends are shit at games all the time. They never take it as anything but banter. Same when they do it back to me
---
Im not saying thats true of OPs situation, just that from my experience its more about bants than some insecurity
---
That's about the level that I was at when I first took down one solo. Congrats! Let them hate, I also like going slow and absorbing all the details. Far too much time was put into all the stores and little side piece information to just blow though the game. The writers are who make the Fallout series so enjoyable. All of the issues with the game, and I've not seen one complaint really about the story and missions. Play the way you play and enjoy yourself. If you or anyone else want to join up, my GT on XB1 is Broughsiff. 
---
Go to events with randoms I've gotten several friends that way
---
I play fallout with my gf too and sometimes I get angry at her, I feel bad about it but I can’t help it. Yesterday I got annoyed with her because she kept rushing into fights without a weapon equipped, only then when she would be in the middle of a swarm of ghouls she would go into her pip boy and equip a weapon, taking massive damage in the meantime. She would also keep stopping in the middle of fights to take rad away because she wanted that little bit of red to go away before she healed, meanwhile while she was taking rad away she would get killed. She never has stimpacks because she used them to heal when there is no action instead of eating food, then when a fight starts instead of being able to heal quickly, she stops to eat food from her inventory and dies. I don’t get frustrated with her because I enjoy shitting on her to make myself feel superior, I get frustrated because sometimes I feel like I’m babysitting her and always have to making sure she has a weapon equipped, that she has healing available, that she has ammo. I’d love nothing more than for her to be able to take care of herself.
---
&gt; You get a bunch for killing queen
---
So that's where all my stable cobalt came from! 
---
From the fact i’ve only downloaded 2 updates on the ps4 
---
They only respawn when someone new (force quit rejoins team) comes by.   
---
It is not bugged for respawns at all. It is just good old fashion force spawning. 
---
I miss dobby :'/ &lt;3
---
Was down by blackwater mine, at lvl 17, doing Rose's never ending fetch missions. Saw WS nuked. Slapped on the suit of lv15 raider power armor i have, ran over there. Thought I'd be safe by the gate, the one near WS station, kited some green fatties over to the 3 assaultrons hanging out there. It didn't go well for the assultrons... Realizing the imminent death of my protectors i ran like shit for the front entrance - well I didnt know it was the front entrance having never been there, just heard a sentry so ran toward it. Had about 5 or 6 glowing fatties on my tail by then. Mass chaos ensues and fun ensues. I leave lvl 21.
---
So fuck the snobs, that shit was fun. I got no help or required it. Just a fuckton of radaway
---
There's only been 2 updates on PS4? The fuck? They can get out like 5 on Xbox but can't do the same for the Playstation?
---
I’m not knocking anybody for using chems, I think in my total fallout playtime (fallout 1-76) I have used maybe like 4 or 5 chems total but it’s just like I personally don’t care for them. I don’t really have a solid argument but I really care about chems, that’s it. lol.
---
I love the map marker idea. That simple little thing would add a lot of functionality and life to the world. 
---
O.o fuck them both. Im level 90, but I play the game casually. (Aka, my brother plays on my account when Im at work) fuck anyone who makes fun of you for playing the game your way at your speed. 
---
If you like PvP, there's always going to be people out there that'll give you a challenge no matter what level you are. 
---
I love PvP for this very reason. Its the most everlasting element in the game IMO. I even built my camp to encourage challenges from other people! Check it out here:  https://youtu.be/MMfRL77tr3s
---
This is amazing! Well done on finding the location. I spent a good while trying to do this on top of the buildings in Watoga, with no luck. 
---
You actually reminded me of ready player one.
---
*Spoiler*
---
At the end the creator says, "thanks for playing my game". 
---
It made me tear up a bit. The best gamers are the ones that get immersed and appreciate a game in their own way.
---
&gt;Can someone reassure me that the next time I log in it'll all be there or something.
---
Next time you log in it'll all be there or something.
---
&gt;They briefly came back to play the tuba I have in the backyard before scampering off to who-knows-what other adventures.
---
/r/brandnewsentence
---
That's the right way to play if you ask me. Your ex's sound like assholes.
---
You know you are playing the game right. When you play the game, and you are having fun. Ur ex's can go fk off
---
See whenever my camp is taken I know in a pinch I can head there for a table and a bench. if its locked I can get into most places with a window, marsupial or other nefarious ways. 
---
We were farming the other day and eventually they just stopped. Like 8 or 9 waves but yeah. Finally nothing more came
---
Before submitting do a search 😔
---
My red dress has the same problem. At least my Marine tactical helmet grants me a bit of privacy.
---
Okay? Good job? Who cares honestly?
---
Dad I'm hungry!
---
Fusion cores fam like every other power armor
---
There is a *tonne* of nuked flora, and lots of high level legendaries. 
---
oh god my dreams
---
Er...you on PC, PS4, XBox? Im on PS4. Ill talk spanish with ya!
---
I don't even know why I bother going through the time and effort of setting up a workshop when all of my hard work and resources just disappear since I can't stay on a server for more than an hour. WE ARE TWO MONTHS PAST RELEASE WHY IS THIS STILL A THING BETHESDA?
---
Fake news in it for the "progressive" praise. lol at the believers
---
You found a pa chassis. They require cores. They are found everywhere
---
You are right: Pacifist mode only affects damage against player characters.
---
1. there has been 2 __LARGE__ patches, otherwise except for the holiday season there has been 1 every week/every other.
---
2. do you want them to rush shit and fuck more things up? or take their time and fix it right. (example, 3 rushes? on dupe fix, still a problem.  1 non rush for PA fix, not a problem)
---
I’m on right now. My tag is my name
---
Doing God’s work good sir. Where do you get the orbital strike stuff. Enclave?  Just started them
---
This *would* be cool but I can absolutely foresee many people exploiting it. I mean what happens when they equip all of these perks and stuff everything in the stash box like a 6 year old "cleaning" their bedroom, and then just unequip the perks?
---
"...and I don't want to hear yours" works too.
---
When I have trouble with enemies in a new area, I go back to a previous area and clean out every location in that region. 
---
You will get XP even for enemies well below your level, find plans, and find lots of junk for crafting later. You also get a little bit of XP from discovering locations and will run into random side quests, daily quests, and events that also award XP.
---
When I was level 25 I had only been to The Forest and the Grafton area and hadn't even been to The Top of the World yet 😅 I just kept exploring and cleaning places out.
---
I did some exploring of the Ash Heap, but I honestly need to go back and do a lot of the mines. I'm around level 45 now and am working on the Free States quests and exploring The Mire.
---
i wasnt able to kill a scochbeast til like lvl 80 so goodjob
---
I also played as melee power armored and surprisingly it wasn't half bad! Really good for ghouls and wendigo's. But sneaking and listening to "I wish a buckethead would show up..." has a special place in my heart.
---
Was sure I had those. Thanks!
---
Honestly I very much would enjoy having a gf that enjoyed videogames, regardless of how "good" they are at it.
---
OMG! I never knew,  my excavator armour is getting pimped to the max later then as I have a couple of mods in my stash atm, thanks for letting me know, much appreciated 👍
---
Too much stuff in there.
---
Get rid of the weightless useless stuff
---
#thiscommentwins
---
Limit your junk to a max of 100 to 150 per item. Drop all your ores. Sell any weapons and armors you're not using, and keep an eye of your gunpowder, usually I limit mine to 300.
---
Not true. Consoles have had at least 4 updates. One was a monster Day 1 patch, plus two other substantial patches. They also added another patch that added language support and other minor stuff no one notices. So there's 4 patches I know about without a Google search.
---
That said, you are right about one thing. Their PR team has never been in front of anything for FO76. They've played from behind since the Beta. I have little doubt they ate working nearly around the clock to get the game to the best level. My experience early on was not good, but after almost 2 months I'm not seeing even a tenth of the problems I had before and I think at this point most console players are on the hate train because it's still the cool thing to do. 
---
If I have one thing I'm still ultra bitter about it's a $60 charge for a game that costs less than $30 less than a month in. I'd like a partial refund.
---
I would really love Set bonus items. Mid level to mediocre independently but get a unique (doesn’t even necessarily have to be good just unique) bonus when you have the whole set equipped. I can already imagine a Grognak loin cloth and leg pieces that when equipped with the axe give some sort of barbarian bonuses. 
---
Yes there are fusion cores and you need them to make the armour work. Most sets spawn in the world with a core in them, but a lot of people loot the cores for their own suits. You can get cores from holding Poseidon power plant (one per hour if you power up the right machine), from looting them out in the world (fusion generators, suits of power armour) or from killing some mobs (I think sentry bots). It works basically the same as FO4, though.
---
You're probably best waiting til lvl 25 when you can do a quest to make your own set of Excavator Power Armour. You'll have had a chance to save up some cores by then &amp; will get the plans for the power armour station from that quest.
---
I'm glad that I got in on day 1 of the Beta so there were no high level players hanging around the starting trying to "help" new players.  IMO, it ruins the experience when you emerge from the Vault and see some over-budget floating C.A.M.P. and a scary looking guy in power armor comes over and gives you some dog food.
---
Let the new players experience the struggles and enjoyment of the early game.   Soon enough they will have everything they need, and will be stuck in the never ending "end game".
---
or is it intercontinental badass motorcycle? Ambiguity!
---
Lots of talk. No proof. Run it off maybe? Rub some dirt in it?
---
I think you only get notified if another player attacks your camp. 
---
Yeah it was called elegant apparently. (As stated by junfen below) but thanks nevertheless
---
I had no idea, from now on that’s exactly what I’m doing 👍
---
Unfortunately levels mean nothing after 50 lol. Wonder where this came from.
---
This has happened to me countless times in last two weeks. Just stopped happening last two days
---
In all seriousness though does anyone have any word on the next patch? I don’t think they’ve given up on the game at all but I just haven’t heard anything, or any roadmaps other then just factions are apparently coming. 
---
I’m hoping right now that In a couple weeks or a month we get a giant update with a ton of shit we wanted, and it was them just doing the no mans sky approach and just got to work and straight updated the fuck out of the game, but we’ll see. 
---
pretty similar to how i play open world stuff. i just slink around and loot
---
go you op
---
I think they come from Helvetica possibly? I originally thought they came from the monster mash but I think that's wrong.
---
Oh &gt;.&lt; youre right haha
---
Dude, if you killed a scorchbeast by yourself at lvl 34, you're definitely not "shit" at it. Lol. 
---
there are at least 8 that I know of
---
For the SBQ fight I am using the prime auto receiver on the handmade. Along with the high capacity magazine, true long barel and reflex sights. From my experience it gives me the most sustained over time dps. For the fight I max out demolition expert, put 6 points into commando perk and use tank killer. You’re right the ammo is expensive to make. One SBQ fight can easily use up 3000 rounds of ammo. But this does help alot. I think the prime receiver adds about 25% damage. I’ve also been in fights used up 3000 rounds of ammo and not killed the queen. That sucks more. 
---
Blops are arena shooters. Its a weird comparison to make.
---
You don't even stay connected to a single server long besides a stream of stat data.
---
I agree as well. I didn't start tackling them solo into 70 or so. There were a couple before that but I relied heavily on the antiaircraft guns.
---
At 108, I still avoid gulpers.
---
was given the hat, guess I'll be looking for the staff room now though for more! was I right about helvetica?
---
Kill super mutants in the eastern penitentiary, then scrap their pupe rifles for 5-10 steel each
---
No idea
---
http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout_76_patches
---
Just leaving that here; but yes, there should have been (and should continue to be) significantly more effort on Bethesda's part to fix broken mechanics (including patching exploits) and continue to improve client stability.
---
I dont understand people like that at all, if youre having fun who gives a fuck if youre amazing or completely trash.  Not saying OP is, just in general.
---
Okay so check it out, Aside from Whitesprings (for exp and legendaires which are mostly junk now anyways) and Prime(queen at least has a few plans left for me) the only halfway decent drop is on harpers ferry. That is it the big oh it is so awesome to drop nukes gets confined to honestly two spots.  Now I did drop on prime had a bunch of low players come and show up making it into a 20 minute fight so I launched another but aimed it at charleston which in turn pretty much emptied the server out. So then I rolled up to bravo dropped a nuke on prime and duo'ed the queen in less than 5 minutes.  So that is an option if you want people off your server for easy queens.   
---
Now me, I am a dick too, I drop nukes on players workshops. I have also literally nuked a players camp 3 times because I could and he was in spot that was taking up 4 other prime spots at whitesprings so I couldn't get my camp out.   
---
Now there is 2 spots I would love to try and nuke but no they are in the safety zone so new players don't get hit one of them is billings homestead with all the plant life over there it would be great for flux farming.   
---
TL;DR Rant over,   Basically whitspring is farming for some loot and exp that is all, also to compete with assholes on who can steal all the kills the fastest. 
---
The warranty sticker thing isn't as true as it used to be.
---
https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/ftc-warranty-stickers-illegal/
---
Not 50 pairs for 48 events. LOL
---
I got a ton of them at the observatory in the Savage Divide. I'm not sure if it's a location where the spawns change though (for example, that little shack in the dry lake bed near Charleston has been alternating Super Mutants and Scorched for me).
---
Anywhere with a good robot population should be good. That tech building with Sugar in the name should be decent too.
---
How you tame?
---
Last 4 times i killed her she dropped nothing and promptly disappeared when i use various weapons to make sure damage was registering
---
So i decided to not waste my time nuking Prime anymore and switched my focus to Whitesprings.
---
If i had to guess I've killed Queen about 25 times and have gotten drops about 10 times not without many issues like having to build a staircase to get loot floating mid-air
---
Find a place that has bits of ground poking out? That should be fairly easy in the swampy parts in the East.
---
You’re just mad that players like you wouldn’t get SBQ completes without players like me. 
---
Easy, get molotovs, go to whitespring, throw molotov into clubhouse tagging all ghuls that are coming out with the fire while running to the white spring entrance. The eobots do the rest. Its lame but you lvl up fast
---
Nope, but good luck getting into it. It has everything and then some. 
---
If you would humor me
---
1. What is your setup/ approach (gear, perks and the way you go about it)
---
 And
---
2. What is your desire from stealth? (Quick takedowns, minimizing/removing combat entirely, etc.)
---
still not entirely sure, someone i was with mentioned helvetica, a guy who commented here mentioned a staff room. so that's a start.
---
Ha
---
U can bulid at top of stairs. Maybe try to place stairs in water then build of that
---
"He's coming right for us!!"
---
1000 Base + 1000 Additional Earnable
---
What slot is emergency protocol go on?
---
oh is it a dev thing?
---
I would disagree. They have been study with updates. The game runs 90% better then it did at launch. The biggest issues are duping and I think they need to rework Scorch Beast Queen Health scaling. Server are almost stable,but the issues we see with servers now is because of duping I believe.
---
They are ready working on more content.
---
the last inside the vault said a large patch mid-late January is the estimate
---
&gt; would think that most gamer guys, gay or straight, would simply be happy to have a BF/GF that shared an interest with them
---
As a woman who's been gaming for 30 years, gamer bf's come in one of two flavours: extremely competitive douchebags, or extremely supportive cheerleaders.
---
Cheerleaders can be a little overbearing and a bit white knighty at times, but I'll take 'You've got this!' over huehuehue u suk something something kitchen. 
---
You are *way* underleveled for Top of the World. Head back to the Ash Heap, Forest and Toxic Valley and explore. 
---
The journey beats the destination, I don't think rushing and power leveling is worth it. If you really want to, get a friend to take you to whitesprings. 
---
Yeah some areas are easier but I've found a large open water I would   like to build in the center.
---
Honestly the game needs some serious tweaks to player interaction with other players and property.
---
If I'm in passive mode, why should other players be able to murder me? Why should my Camp be vulnerable to attack from players? Why should my pet be able to be killed by them at all?
---
Passive mode should OPT YOU OUT OF PVP completely. 
---
If not, the two Grafton vendors have these plans fairly often, along with the BoS combat armor plans.
---
A note that the "leather arm" and "pipe pistol" quests seem to either have plans in the loot box or have plans on the spawned horde boss (I'm getting cushioned trapper plans, which I've not encountered before - I haven't bought them or cared about them so maybe its a coincedence)
---
Bah. He's just begging the question in response to an obvious objection to this "theory." Bostrom is a smart guy, but he's really gone down a rabbit hole on this one.
---
I'll give it a shot. I've been trying to bump items in the lake and place camp on item s
---
If you had a little small square shack right behind the stage, it was definitely you then.
---
Nothing would happen.  The point of this request is that just owning(ie being able to equip)  would apply its effect to your stash.  Equipping would only affect what you are currently carrying as it currently does. 
---
The perk cards don't effect the stash at all atm.
---
The chest slot
---
Bulk your crafting materials and always sell excess bulk. 
---
I had a friend complaining about storage and I found out he had enough steel for 20 bulk sets of it... sell 15 of those. 
---
People in this game are tending to hoard everything and that’s just not how it works, you need to learn what items give you what like stop picking up lead and steel if you already have enough in your stash, like I normally am just grabbing adhesive and screws and electronics, even oil and all that shit it all adds up I once had 13 stacks of bulk oil, never keep more then like 5 stacks of bulk
---
Your right!!! That’s why nothing happens with my excavator PA !! Lmao that was a supreme waste of caps!!! I kept jumping into groups of enemies thinking I timed it wrong!!! Thank you so much for the gesture and the info!!
---
If you're on PC and running mods, you need to change up your fallout76custom.ini to read as below:
---
sResourceArchive2List = SeventySix - ATX_Main.ba2, SeventySix - ATX_Textures.ba2, &lt;list of mods here that you're using&gt;
---
Congratulations on taking one down by yourself!!! I’m level 62 and have yet to kill any scorchbeasts alone. The few times I have taken one on it was with other people or Whitesprings robots, otherwise I turn tail and run!
---
I'm an oxymoron kinda guy ATM since I run a predominantly stealth rifle build but softly clunk around in my Excavator PA  🙂 
---
Level 76 and I still avoid them even though I have the means to eradicate them fairly quickly, they can overwhelm easily if there's too many adds around and if there are multiple scorchbeasts just spamming you with that stupid sonic attack.
---
Hope it works. Thats how u make levitating bases
---
my problem with radrats is that my turrets at camp just doesnt seem to "see" them. They will completely destroy all my crops that my turrets are supposed to be watching over..and not once will my turrets fire at them. Its like the turrets cant see them or something
---
Lol level 87 and didn't know you could lock an open door.   How funny!  Gonna have to try this. 
---
I'm a guy and it sounds like a great way to play the game. Lower stress and you get to find all thw little things left in the game that others rush through.
---
Yeah it is the dev room.    
---
Didn’t think I need to, just wanted to tell people what I just learned. 
---
Lol, nice one
---
Can't touch them,  they're on the other side of the river that's inaccessible. 
---
I know I am. And super lucky for it, too. I dont deserve her.
---
Good bye medic pump lol. Do you get killed a lot running such low health though?
---
Find people with mutations you want and buy them cheap
---
You can get a fusion core from any power armor chassis spawn, just take it out of the armor inventory. Alternatively the public workshops at the 3 different power plants have a machine for producing fusion cores, they do require a significant amount of power. Finaly you can craft 2 types of cores, the plasma core for weapons only at a tinkers bench, and much later on fusion cores from a chemistry bench but it requires items from nuked areas (stable flux).
---
There are a few places you can find chainsaws (Clarkesburg Hardware store, a camp west of top of the world, Mountainside bed and breakfast, and the ranger headquarters) but the trick to make them useful is to use weapon artisan rank 3 to repair it to 200% durability.  Then you stack %damage increase abilities/perks/mutations and as much STR as you can get.
---
Yeah but I'm dumb
---
The only way people get good at games is playing them more, it has nothing to do with sex or gender. Good on you for not taking people's shit. If they are putting you down about video games, they were just going to put you down about something else in the future. Everyone needs a supportive significant other in a relationship. 
---
Step off your high horse a little man.
---
"The flamer runs out of fuel in about 30 seconds" hahahahhaa poor guy
---
I’ll come too!
---
I am not shit.  I don't remember what level I made it to before I got bored and moved on.  120ish?  maybe higher?  I never once used a chem.  They sold for a nice amount!  
---
VATS is there to be used, nothing wrong with that.
---
Are you having fun when playing?  Does it make you happy?  That is all that matters.  Anyone else's opinion is incorrect.  
---
Inventory.  Not stash. 
---
Though you can move them to your stash. 
---
Nah just fucking proud of myself with no-one offline who actually knows what fallout is let alone a scorch beast 😂 don't believe me and that's your opinion, cool, keep on keeping on
---
Literally right after reading this I saw someone at my base with a bounty. I fast travelled there and found my pet Deathclaw, Scratches, dead and the guy in my camp using my stuff. Fired a few "warning shots" (I had pacifist on and forgot), gave him 30 seconds head start, turned off the pacifist mode and chased him down. He got tangled with some robots, so it only took one shot to end him. Took his stuff as payment, he had Flux on him.
---
That's what he deserved for shooting my buddy and then using my cookpot. What's most amusing is I got lucky before and had the standing camo legendary armor, so I literally watched him come back to pick up his stuff as I'm saying (not through my mic) "that's what you get, remember Scratches".
---
1. Yes it does.
---
2. Yes, it is making me use more water and food when running it, but it's not really a big deal.
---
And to repair the second arch apparently 😣
---
Yes to number 1 but I have no idea on 2
---
.....and you are a very hateful and rude individual, I’m glad I posted as I have now learned that materials are not required to apply a mod, so problem solved, losing mods is something that has happened to a lot of people and the more it’s posted about the more info like not needing mat’s will get out there, but if you don’t like a post you can always scroll past, can’t help but feel your the one who’s attention seeking!
---
Mind=blown
---
Speed demon only drains food and water when sprinting, as for the Gauss rifle if the damage symbol is not a lightning bolt then grounded won't reduce it.
---
😂😂
---
happens with a lot of stuff, i just remove the roof and replace it after. a pain for multi stories
---
I only use mine in the shittiest of situations. I keep em at 10 &amp; 11 O'clock on my favorite wheel just in case
---
I recently got my girlfriend to start playing Pokemon Lets Go because she loves Go, and I love to see how she does everything so weird and different because she hasn't been playing since Pokemon Red.
---
She beat the 3rd gym, skipped saving Sylph Co, and decided to just run around doing stuff while I was at work. I got back, and she found Articuno, then defeated the 7th gym, then the 6th. I was, and still am, beyond confused how she did it
---
Fair enough.
---
Just because you play different doesn’t make you bad
---
You can only buy the blueprint for the weapon (handmade gun = ak47) in the small level instances of 15-20 
---
Afterwards it can only be found as a reward
---
mmmm... Dev room, tell me more, lol :)
---
I ran into the same thing yesterday with my power armor station. Eventually I just gave up and put it out front of my camp on the ground haha. I didn't try it but you might be able to stash your roof, place down the power armor station, and replace the roof.
---
Do you have to go through the whole process every time you want to launch?
---
I had a tent back there for people to sleep in. There was a chunky behind just to house fusion reactor and protect it.
---
Mine was... Then all the people from the nuke would come fir shelter and water, and bring all the ghouls and death claws with them
---
Just like how the sun shines through the ground! Truly amazing 
---
Yeah. About half way down there's a portapotty with closed door. Inside is a teddy bear with a human skeleton arm holding a plunger in the toilet. Pretty hilarious.
---
I fucking love goblin slayer
---
420? Is it that time already?  Pass the doritos my dude
---
yeah! i’m on ps4 as well, diewookiee is my handle 
---
I actually put a sign next to my front door that says "Close the damn door when you go" for this very reason!!
---
Where is the Dev room/staff room located?
---
Console?
---
Not true, there have on been 2 updates that required taking the server down and required client side downloads. Beth has done a lot more updating on their end which didn’t require a download.
---
John wicks unite!
---
I know for sure evrything stack multiplicative and before defence mitigation.
---
I'm glad you're so very aware of how many successful SQB's I've done with my squad to give you such an insightful frame of reference. Wash it off in the locker room Champ.
---
A better syringer.
---
Nice, I have a locked lower door leading up to a rolling metal door with a keypad to get access to the interior proper
---
A level 30 not ready for white springs? I am level 14 and im wrecking, but my build is all perception lol
---
I don't personally think there's a problem with it. Good buddies and nice people will just give you stuff for free, people who are friends or in a relationship who play together might trade real world stuff for items (for example a buddy might be like "drive me to the airport tomorrow and I'll give you a cool gun I found"). It's up to the players to set the price.
---
I don't think selling things for real money on a mass scale to strangers is particularly ethical with duping around. Once duping is totally fixed and all prior dupes have been wiped, though, it will be okay in my opinion. Just no way to tell if something is duped yet so I wouldn't trust it and would be angrily suspicious of any stranger who seems to always have cool stuff.
---
Bethesdas environmental storytelling is always stellar and F76 is no exception, however, moments like the Whitespring resort and the shit with Rose really make me wish there were more distinct NPCs, so I can definitely see where the complainers are coming from. 
---
Platform: PS4
---
PSN: them
---
Every time I leave a server my game completely crashes. It's very annoying when I try to join my friends, but I'm already in a game. I get an error code and I've reported it over a hundred times now.
---
Some people always use crowbars, when breaking into peoples apartments, I guess it's the crowbar manufacturers fault, because they give people this chance. Shame on them and people are innocent, because they just use the chance they are given.
---
Then they’re carrying you champ. Enjoy being a scrub. 
---
Yup, and I agree it's about as hell
---
Girl gamer here as well and I play the same way! Have had the game for a month now and just got to level 53 - I'd rather sneaky beaky my way around than grind my way to higher levels. (And I might not be the best at combat either...)
---
Thanks to both of you, will try that, looks so stupid :)
---
&gt;not as seeing the fallout series has an obsession with lore 
---
Well, fallout 76 is an exception ... 
---
&gt; what do you want to see 
---
I want “this machine” and “that gun” ... if you catch my drift :)
---
I wonder how many players would rage quit 76 if they made Whitesprings unable to be nuked and level capped it to 15-20.
---
[](/cheerilee)
---
It is really nice although the ergonomics of the device definitely leave something to be desired. If I keep this up, I'll probably look into getting a set of grips.
---
Thanks, just had to make me imagine a guy with 3 neck beards and in panties. Fucking hell.
---
Since you use VATS. You should invest in perks that increase your vats damage. I believe concentrated fire in perception is good and there's the luck perks which can grant really good vats bonuses. Idk if you're already building with those anyway, but just a heads up to help with combat 
---
This thing is so damn hard to find. Been looking for weeks.
---
no clue but I've come back to no crops before and I know some things like water purifiers can be looted 
---
that said having them inside also stops stray bullets from hitting squishy plants so still worth it - I know my friend places tents then puts the plants under them to keep stray bullets from hitting them
---
Damn dude! That sucks. 
---
Nice! Currently looking for some for that sweet eyebot helmet 
---
OP, what expertise do you have that allows you to know how to make a game better than actual game devs?
---
I too am bothered by bugs and exploits, but I’m sure as shit not going to tell professionals how to do their job, because I don’t know better than them.
---
That's how you play. You sneak around and you get your bow and —fuck stealth archer all over again.
---
Do u still have the plans? Someone sold me a suit but I would like to learn the plans 
---
 I've had all turrets hostile toward me after the Flatwoods monster came to visit. I had to store and replace to fix. 
---
I get what the Flatwoods monster does turning all entities to it's side (charming them, not permanent in most cases) makes sense, but scorchbeasts shouldn't be able to turn mechanical entities. Only the living
---
I'll kill as I please
---
Apparently to cut down on server hopping for farming they limit you to a couple of servers. Is that true?
---
I logged in and found a nice quiet spot near Alpha and built my base. Half way through the server crashes out. When I rejoin I can't place my base as there is a cooking fire and a stash box there. So I server hopped 3 times and kept finding the same cooking fire and stash box. Was I just unlucky? 
---
Okay i will look for it soon then thanks
---
If you're on xbox I can help you kill assaultrons. You need to scrap the assaultron blades to get them. 
---
Decon showers in Poseidon? 
---
Your two exs sound like absolute cunts
---
Yes! An automatic receiver and a suppressor.
---
Or maybe a Bajonett 
---
I think it is fixed. I moved camp the other day and didn't end up with any extra purifiers.  Probably hasn't moved his camp yet,  since the bug was fixed. 
---
There are other camp bugs still though, that affect your budget.  Sadly. 
---
Yup though it's not just end game content. Almost every activity and objective in the game is made easier or more efficient by server hopping.
---
Congrats on killing your first scortchbeast and fuck people who are like your ex’s! I’m lvl 54 and have yet to kill a scortchbeast by myself, can only kill them with the help of the AAA or if I find a group attacking one! Hell I’ve only been to a nuke zone once, although I’m starting to become more interested in them!
---
Not every mod can be learned from scrapping. Some are from plans only. My point was you can learn leather  chest or leg mods from any piece of leather.
---
I had no idea scorch beasts could be level 40
---
You got issues dawg lol 
---
That's a pretty nice spot!
---
Take my doot
---
You still have floors along the edges, but I mean thin interior. Like if you made a 3x3 house, you could have one square in the middle open with plants in it. Throw a fence around that and grow stuff.
---
YOU DIED.
---
I can also he,p launch the nuke if you need the help.
---
this also works with maps displayed in the game world. for instance, if you see a map on the wall at the train station in watoga, you can click on the pinpoints on the map to add them to your map. you gotta be really accurate and click on the pinpoints though.
---
I was doing the same yesterday and nearly gave up but finally did get the BoS chest plan from the station vendor
---
I only have a hoarding problem because I need materials to fix shit. Without durability I'd never hoard stuff
---
I just launched my first one.  Figured why whitesprings. I went with Morgantown.
---
I would kill to have a gamer girlfriend.
---
How do you live long enough to deliver the damage? 
---
Lucky I’m over 100 try’s now 
---
i would like: 
---
1. those vault raids
---
2. more mod options for heavy weapons
---
3. more syringer barrels, endangerol is temperamental and the favored barrel
---
4. more workshops that dont just provide various types of junk (nuka hot topic one, meds, etc)
---
5. customizable pip boy light colors
---
banned, like you account is locked out ?
---
I just sell the super stimpaks. If they let us down craft supers it would go like this.
---
Equip chemist and super duper.
---
Collect 10 superstims, craft 40 stimpaks, duper grants you another 6. 46 stimpaks.
---
Craft craft 184 diluted stims. Duper grants you 28 diluted stimpaks. 212 stim paks. 
---
Even with one point in chemist and no super duper it comes out to 160 diluted stimpaks.
---
Then there's the money angle. I get 15 for a super stim. 150 caps. 10 for a regular. 400 caps. 4 for a diluted stim pak. 640 caps.
---
The honest truth is we don't need even better ways to make stim paks go further. I run pharma farma 2, traveling pharmacy 3, and constantly am carrying hundreds of diluted stim paks as a team medic. If I give out 30 I don't even blink. Honestly I have a much harder time getting enough purified water out of my industrial water purifiers to keep up with my stim pak production. At any time I can sell out every vendor cluster on the map with stimpaks in my inventory. That's before I start selling all the other chems I collect along the way from medicine cabinets, first aid kits, and drug ghouls.
---
New River Gorge Bridge has about 5 bags on the south western end behind the barrels of radiation. 
---
Show boob pics or it didn’t happen
---
Been wanting this all my life, thank you.
---
Exactly the way I have played both Fallout and the Elder Scrolls series from the very start, 420+ hrs in and just hit 110. I don't mind being the turtle, you get to really know and enjoy a world.
---
Oooh this is brill! I've literally been so thick with my perk picks
---
I’m good, just thought if low level people wanted to get the circuit boards without facing assaultrons they have a chance to find them there. 
---
EVE is one world, one universe, one "server" in gamer speak.  ALL players are on One "Server"
---
FO76 has multiple worlds, that is how someone else can be built at your CAMP spot for example.
---
Also Bethesda server software SUCKS.  Getting dumped from the server while you are building up a workshop makes it pointless and NOT fun.
---
I already know my opinion on it. I dont really see anything wrong with it, hours invested in another game traded for hours invested in this game doesnt really seem bad imo. I was just curious what the fallout 76 community thought about the issue, and considering the first response I got was a downvote I will take it as not positive lol.
---
My fiance walked in unannounced with a ps4 on black friday and has been destroying bloodborne ever since (already on her 2nd or 3rd character). Yesterday she encouraged me to buy red dead and this morning i woke up to her playing that.  She's the best 😁
---
He carries some rare items. The hunters long coat, the clean space suit, the fisherman’s long coat, shit like that. Outfits that are worn over your armor. They’re pretty cool.
---
Never should have come here! You picked a bad time to get lost, friend. Can't wait to count out your coin! Die already so I can take your stuff! You'll be so much easier to rob when you're dead.
---
I just can't focus on anything other than your post title.
---
For now they aren't that great. The Plasma Rifle with the flamer attachment does pretty well. The ammo and durability are an issue though
---
claiming the workshops gives a bit of xp, as well as defending them. defending the workshops in the west is usually pretty trivial.
---
this can also yield some decent plan drops.
---
LOL, I'll definitely be looking out for that **Blackest of Black Crows**
---
Good luck, just be aware that it may be a rare chance that you’d find it in the floor. Also depending the level of people around you the protectrons levels may very. They highest I say was 38, but they are easy to kill. 
---
He said Scorched, not Scorchbeast.
---
There has been zero recorded evidence of this happening to mods since the december 4th patch. So it is simple to conclude you scrapped it by mistake.  Would you like to see the pictures of my carrying around over 100 pounds in mods and never lost one? That includes the jetpack, calibrated you name it. All while just playing the game and repairing like normal.   
---
So unless you have direct evidence I will say again " your story smells like rancid shit and are likely an attention seeking whore "  
---
I am not hateful, I am an asshole and rather blunt. I know this and I am fine with it.
---
nun ya
---
nope
---
At the moment, there's no reason to use Diluted RadAway or RadX. They weight the same, for less benefit. Diluted Stimpaks are definitely worth it for exploring though, since they weigh half as much and still give you the same healing (albeit over time instead of right away).
---
just putting points in intelligence can give you more xp for everything you get xp for
---
Smart people listen to other’s opinions to help inform their own.
---
Congrats on the kill.
---
The way you play sounds similar to the way I play.   Am I a ‘shit’ male player?  Lol
---
Play the way you want and have fun.  Only date people who treat you well.   
---
I hope you continue to play the game and enjoy yourself.
---
It is incredibly suspicious that you would "come across" this and not obtain the information of how and where the group got them.
---
It's true that the first and most extensive government-controlled experimentation with FEV occurred on at West-Tek and later Mariposa. However, it was never implied in the events of Fallout 1 or 2 that Mariposa was the only place where the government was coordinating experimentation of the megavirus. FEV was repurposed as a way to immunize US soldiers against Chinese biological weapons. It was an important facet of the government's defense research strategy, so it makes sense that this effort would be diversified and researched in more than one place. Hence Vault-Tec's FEV trials in DC and West-Tek's experimentation in WV.
---
There's no actual mission for it. You need to find the key labeled TNT Dome 2 and then head up to the Northwest to the Domes and find the right one to open it.
---
holy shit thank you so much 
---
Assaultron blades 
---
I agree. It seems like no one uses a mic 
---
I used the shorter curved power station--problem solved. If you want the standard power armor station use their method
---
Cool. Ill maybe he on late tonight, lvl 19.
---
Yes I'm also of your opinion but ammos for gauss are under energy ammo when you build them...
---
'Giving' noobs a 2.5k under armour sounds fair 
---
I'm running a unique fire Ax with 40% swing speed boost. Couple with 3 maxed out slugger cards. Drop 200+ every swing. 
---
The stories and art are excellent, but those are obviously different workstreams and different teams than the gameplay mechanics.  Writing and art teams were ready to launch, mechanics not so much.  Management could have launched early access with integrity.  But didn’t.
---
Ohhhhh, i might get thank hunters coat for my friend. Thanks
---
Yes they all did the first time, will try again. Sad as I wanted someone to talk to :(
---
Oh God yes. Thanks for the heads up!
---
This is basically how I see it as well.
---
Well General Dawson, if I don’t have 3 vault suit soon, as Commander of the Emmet Mountain Militia, I may be kicking some warrants up the chain for you and your’s to entertain...that rhymed more than I intended.
---
I've had the queen to drop the automatic version twice now the plans for it.  I don't think it's worth the mo though unless you're using it to hunt the queen more
---
Well it sounds like they were duped, no idea why they weigh 0 unless the have the weight reduction perk
---
Diluted radaway is useless, but diluted radX is awesome because it doesn't suppress mutations. 
---
You tell em girl yeah!!!!
---
Luck.  Scorch Beasts, I believe, have a higher chance to drop prime plans but they can spawn from containers and legendaries.
---
Stealth ladies unite! 💘 Let's all creep around the wasteland together 
---
We assure you 
---
They have played nonstop and grind out nukes and events 
---
Yeah i've had this a few times not sure why it happens though, it was also the smaller robots a few times
---
Probably exploiters. 400+ seems a little unbelievable. 
---
Nope, It's through xbox. I can't party up, message or do LFG. 
---
Improving armor over 100% incrase it's rad defence too?
---
That sux
---
Ah yes, I’d forgotten that feature. I don’t have any mutation at the moment so I haven’t worried about it. 
---
Coming to ya.
---
IGN is SemiPotent
---
Just did my second character. Worked fine. Didnt use a rad-x recently did you?
---
I think a central player HUB area thats clearly made to be such would be a big improvement. Should put vending machines they will add into the hub that players can get and load gear into, it would give a reason for people to go there to see what people have for sale. They could also have a LFG board as a way to add LFG feature, daily/weekly quests you can get from there, and plenty of other things as well. I think this would drastically increase player interaction.
---
Server hop Grafton station and the other Vendor not in Grafton and you should have them with in a hour or two.
---
Lmfao I was literally thinking that too
---
Play how u wanna play. Don't let anyone tell u it's wrong or make u feel bad about it. I'm glad u didn't let them put u off
---
That’s not competitive. That’s abusive. 
---
I have them. 
---
On PS4. I know I have marine deep pocket limbs.
---
I have regular pocket raider and leather chest plans too
---
Dm me if you want. 
---
Also - what other two vendors in Grafton besides the railstation? 
---
The responder... and? 
---
That's good to know, because I thought that it only added a single pellet, and wasn't useful. So does it actually double the pellets (16 pellets)?
---
It doable if you farm Nuke Zone IE White Springs.
---
Death trap foreal! I throw a few grenades in first to wake em up.
---
This is great! Definitely gonna try something like this.
---
I've been server hopping Grafton Station for hours over multiple days and all other Responder vendors. Not happening for me. 
---
I have no doubt it will be released. This might be the first online survival mmo that has that capability. It will probably put this game so far ahead because the community can address small shit with mods while the devs hammer out major bugs. Similar to how old school RuneScape works with their 3rd party clients.
---
Fuck those guys! This kind of toxic shit keeps people from enjoying great games and means that I have to play with only boys almost ever 
---
If you don't get kicked you aren't being idle. So what is the problem with building a base to shoot mobs and walk around in it.
---
You have a lot of damage mitigation perks. You can use stealth and stimpacks to stay alive, but yeah you will die  a lot more often.
---
What part did you find pant-shitting?
---
Simple answer, whitesprings farming for a few hours nets you about 10-15 levels alone. SBQ is simple drop nuke to miss V9 fast travel V9 she spawns start shooting her you have a 50/50 chance she flies over and lands in front of you. 4-5 players kill her before the game can finish saying Death From Above completed.   
---
2 people can kill here in a few minutes also.    
---
Basically the more players the are spawned in the more health she has the less players the easier. If you get her to mutate and down to the H by the time the rest of the server has fat traveled it takes like 5 more seconds for her to die is all.   
---
I have a level 195 and 100 currently. Levels are easy.   
---
And yes I will drop a nuke kill queen drop nuke kill queen drop nuke kill queen one right after another it takes like an hour or so with running the silos. Make use of super duper also for the mainframe cores and grab the easy ones when you hit the 3rd you should have 13-20 cores to just pop in so you save a few seconds. 
---
Are you going to robot in the Vendor in Grafton also?
---
That sucks. You can always server hop and block them though. I have no problem being a coward when it comes to the time and pride I take in my CAMP. 
---
Fuck those guys. 
---
This... I have plenty of hours in and only just recently reached 100...
---
Granyed I don't farm nuke zones, only if I happen to see one on the server. But come on... Level 400? That's sketchy as fuck
---
Comm ban. Check your account email or the Microsoft website for the length of the ban. There are ways to get around it
---
You can get on their level easily enough. TSEs are pretty cheap now thanks to rampant duping. The extra levels don't make a difference.
---
But yeah, queens are boring now. Only difficulty is getting there before they die.
---
Do they do any damage or are they fake
---
I feel like half of console crashes are proprietary BS that the console itself causes.
---
No, they changed the law. Now you have to yell "We're thinning out their numbers!"
---
90% weight reduction along with the build in weight reduction of all star? I have some weightless marine armor I tossed ultra light on and it is 0 weight. 
---
The responder vendor also has them? 
---
I hope he washed his hands first
---
I'm 306 and have not even been grinding hard at all.  Just a matter of how efficient you are with the time you're on.  
---
Dam, some people are super salty that girls play games or some shit O_o the downvotes in this chain make no sense
---
The train station vendor and the vendor in town can both carry them if I’m not mistaken.
---
GT: PotatoToucher
---
Yup, always check the club house if you see nuked flora under a clear sky.  Things can get weird in the transition. 
---
It's a Bethesda game. Wolfenstein, Evil Within, Fallout, you always end up playing a stealth archer. Fun, isn't it? 
---
I get the same issue on PS4. I assumed it’s because the loot is disintegrated as well?
---
You have a legitimate play style, the game even gives you PERK cards to support it. AND it’s the same style I play. I only put on power armor as a last resort. 
---
Nope I haven’t used one. Do you get a new mutation every server hop?  Or is it not guaranteed?  Maybe I’m just unlucky at the moment.
---
Not as regularly tbh. I'm just exhausted with server hopping at this stage. Will forge on but hoping a kind soul will have one for trade or sale! 
---
This challenge happens quite often, I decided to make a place for the pic. [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/1bZzMBc.png?1)
---
shows you offline :-/
---
I was going to look into it after my kids eat lunch and I crush them in smash bros. It's just the principle.  
---
Ah, new one for me, never heard about it, think i will keep having my mic off then, lol
---
All this work to make a extra shitty class of weapons not shitty.
---
I’m 58 and I run from them 
---
Oh that's gold. 
---
Nice job
---
Those are phantoms already looted before you got there.
---
Good psa my fried. I forgot to mention as well. That sprinting near the cow thing can sometimes cause I to damage and Agro you causing them all to agro. And yeah the water kills him. I like to stay interacted with him till the person I’m doing it with returns 
---
:D
---
Welch station. 
---
Whitesprings nukes are the most likely reason. I went from level 17 to 59 on my third character in four-ish days of Whitesprings nukes.
---
Meanwhile I barely have 10 magazines in 300 hours 
---
hmm?
---
Yea i know the feel
---
My camps set up across from Slocums Joe so I can run down to the Overseer's camp, get low levels to follow me, and show them my camp, which has water purifiers, crafting tables, and beds for free use
---
Imagine entire servers dedicated to PvP. They could even have zones that load you into these severs where they can remove any extra load on the server. These could be big battlegrounds that could maybe support more than the number of players on a server now.
---
Screw that asshole! If you’re on Xbox let me know if you need anything. I’m level 95.
---
just goes to show people can use controversy for their own personal gain 
---
YEAH! They played us like a damn fiddle! 
---
Fallout is meant to be played slowly and enjoyed, bet they were also shut in bed, to quick to rush to the ‘main quest’ lol.
---
I mean, if you walk into a restaurant and it's mostly empty but the wait to be seated is long, there's dirty floors bathrooms, and dishes, it smells bad, the food is under-cooked, the drinks are off, and the waiter acts poorly, then I guess don't complain or tell your friends how the place is poorly run and needs improvement. Definitely don't complain to the manager. You've never run a restaurant before, so why tell professionals how to do their job?
---
Probably all the robot spawns at Whitesprings. Brings my FPS down tremendously.
---
I stopped running at around lvl 40 because I play pretty much exclusively with my gf and we're about the same level. With decent weapons, they're "manageable". Lol
---
downvotes for being a dick, wow didn't expect that...
---
I found out about it the first time i went up one but have forgot since then, thanks for the reminder!
---
Lighthouse, in the house

Is it done yet ? going online in 2 min's :)

"It's not happening to me, so it's not happening for anyone!"
---
Auto flare fired when critically down, allow players in the area to initiate response and try and make it before an extended timer runs out and the down player expires. 
---
I went to that house over and over server hopping and only found it once 
---
Is there a way to fix that? Im right next to em. So I dont know?
---
Is there a setting?
---
Someone just came and used him. I really dont know.
---
I keep having ghouls smack my turrets and they give no shits
---
I think those are the one type of animal that don't get labelled as hostile, though I haven't encountered a player's one yet.
---
Just because you don’t play as much doesn’t mean others don’t. I know a legit 370. Calm down 
---
I've sunk over 200 hours in by this point. Still have yet to actually launch a nuke. The fun for me is in trying new builds, just like Dark Souls.
---
Dunno what sort of fuckin' weirdos your BF's were. Who gives a shit if someone spends more time exploring?
---
Hell, I've never personally beaten Skyrim or FO4 despite hundreds of hours of play because there's so much other shit to do or see that I get sidetracked. I'm the type who does all he wants first prior to finishing the main questline. I find it weird that they would want to rush the main story in a game primarily about exploration.
---
I'm a big fan of killing everything before it can see me because, ya know, dying sucks. 
---
I'm all about the sneak and hoard mentality. 
---
can't join you, offline :-(
---
Sell on fo76 bazaar that's the only sure fire way outside of farming monsters if you do go with that option farm on the west so it doesn't take up so much ammo or damage your weapons so much . Also you can walk into daily missions or events and get caps that way. It's nowhere near enough to get you to that 1% status but it's a start. 
---
Congrats on losing the douchebag. And also congrats on killing the scorchbeast. 
---
I play very much like you do. Half the fun is exploring everything. Why rush through it? 
---
I'm level 49 and haven't killed a scorchbeast yet. Got like 2 shots in once though. 
---
I tried making a discussion on how to fix it but people don't want to admit that a nerf will come.
---
Here's the discussion: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/abp9lu/an_idea_to_fix_the_tse_metagame/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
Really is no full-proof way. It will be much easier when player vending becomes a thing, since the fastest way to make caps is from other players.
---
Then again, the dupers will be the ones selling their hundreds of thousands of items for dirt cheap, preventing other people from making caps from honest trade.
---
Currently level 19 here. PSN Snausages81 
---
What's wrong with beaing a sneaky bugger who doesn't use Chems outside of Stimpaks and RadAway/Rad-X?  
---
I will admit though, the difficulty curve of 76 have allowed me to actually play something different than I'm used to, at least for the first half of the leveling experience. (Always go sneaky sniper/sneaky pistollier, this time I've gone Doom Marine with Shotguns)
---
I'm sorry man, ask teammates for them? Do you have the perk?
---
Im very competitive and i would never shit ob my gf if she played games
---

---
Pretty sure you said more than stupid in the head ? Was it voice or a message ?
---
My TSE 3\* took down Lvl 80 SB yesterday. I have no Pistol perks. I works pretty well. Once it lands you melt it pretty quickly due to high rate of fire. Its fun to use and ammo is plentiful. I take it out once a day for fun.
---
You on Xbox I am so bored of playing solo and wouldn't mind joining you
---
Maybe, but asking people to play a game the way you want, and not the way they want, kinda makes you an asshole too
---
You have to be between level 15 and 43 to get them . Level up an alt. The vendor at Harper's ferry carries them 
---
Death bags sit for quite a while if they go untouched.
---
You're luckier than me, i built mine on the highest possible point you can build, spanned between to mountains and it is still regularly taken.
---
I tried making a discussion on how to fix it but people don't want to admit that a nerf will come. I was trying to find a middle ground that would fix it without creating too much hassle for Bethesda and wouldn't hurt players who worked hard fir their gear. 
---
best thing to do if doing the radiation method is go to black water mine, get radiated, if you do not like the mutation, go inside and use the rad shower to remove your rads for free
---
You play like my dad(not an insult), whenever I would see him playing fallout or skyrim he would constantly be sneaking everywhere.
---
Lonk
---
Yeah, it's hit or miss if there will be a PA chassis in the mining HQ. Last time I went there to help my husband craft his Excavator set, there was one with a partial T-45 set in the second rack, so I nabbed it.
---
I'm rolling with a full set of mutations and slowly saving caps toward the day I can afford a selective serum shopping spree. I suppose I could vendor grind every day but find that boring.
---
Do you try more then once per server.? As in take 90% rads. Re-equip starched and cute rads then try again? It’s no 100% you get a mutation from taking rads. Sometimes you have to do it a few times. But yeah when I did it I gained a new one every time I changed servers 
---
My husband is very competitive in video games and therefore we have pretty different tastes when it comes to how we game and what games we play. I'm an explorer, I cover everything, and I love listening to storylines. When we go through games together he skips through cut scenes, never gets into the storylines,and constantly checks to make sure he is sporting the best gear and/or has all his skills in the right places. 
---
Even though our playing style is different he's never once scorned me for "not playing right" (and neither have I for that fact). He knows I'm enjoying myself and I do that in a different way then he does. When I find nice armor or weapons and I don't need I give it to him and vise versa. I'm a armorsmith and he's a gunsmith and when we need something fixed or made we do that for each other. He can go off and do his own thing but he likes to go explore/ do quests with me or go visit my base while I'm busy and very tediously place a shit ton of lamps in it.
---
Smh why post it. 
---
I'm level 69 and I have been going to all responder vendors but it's costing a lot of caps and time! 
---
Think I see them sometimes at harpers ferry
---
Thanks for the reply.  I'll go ahead with the prime auto receiver, I guess I got the plan a while back when I launched my only nuke and we beat the Queen.  That was my intention when I got the gun, so that I can be useful against the SB Queen.   When I saw that flux is required to craft the ammo, it kinda scared me off.  I haven't been to nuke zones much so I haven't really figured out how hard it is to make flux, but it looks like quite a hassle.   Maybe I'll get better at aquiring flux when I go to more nuke zones.
---
I have a lot of unspent perk points, so I can get those cards and swap them in when I'm going to use the TSE Handmade.  I saw in another thread that Tormentor might also be useful for crippling the wings and keeping her on the ground.  I'm mainly a melee build, so I can save ammo when she's down.
---
Thanks again, I've read some of your past threads and have gotten some good information from them.
---
I hear its a bug that it happens. If I reload I would lose him for you. :C
---
Ya I heard they plan on adding more vaults in quests to go along with them 
---
What system 
---
You want me to make you some chamomile tea man? Maybe a foot soak or something? You got a lot pent up there bud
---
What platform you on?
---
Sell everything u pickup.  
---
Can't tell if serious about gyms. There are a couple around. Green County Lodge has a gym with barbells. Missile Silo Alpha has a gym in the barracks. Horn Wright Estate has a gym with plenty of weights too.
---
The barbells are heavy AF but break down to a small weight. 50ish without scrapper each gym. Takes what? 5min to hit all 3 of those gyms for 150 lead. My mine didn't make anywhere near that. 
---
Yeah, I usually do. Shortly before that. I bought the plan for the Brotherhood combat chest plate. I don't think this thing is ever coming off. Thought you may like to hear that.  Ad Victoriam!
---
That's why dupers should get banned.
---
Yeah but I've never heard it go off. They seem really rare on Xbox. I've bought a couple from people but I don't know if that counts towards the achievement that way- the challenge doesn't update. 
---
I still run from them at 52 because why the hell would I want to fight one?
---
It's a flying bullet sponge who constantly spams an unavoidable AOE ranged attack that deals radiation and breaks the shit out of armor. I already struggle to maintain a good ammo count as it is, why would I want to spend 10 minutes fighting a single enemy, get all my shit broken, just to get some trash loot?
---
let me reload again
---
You're great, they are clowns, keep on keeping on.
---
Congrats on your milestone on fo76! Keep it up!

I just did a quick run through of Helvetia. I found the mask although you cant pick it up.

Don't forget pretty much every crafting perk.

2 hours of wandering around the middle and left of the map I had almost 400 steel. Not to mention craploads of aluminum, screws, and springs. 
---
Or they come and watch you die and steal your junk.
---
If you wanna be the 1% then there's only one option... Trading. 
---
But if you just wanna have enough caps for whatever then just do your vendor run every day and they will pile up. Running a high luck build helps too since pretty much every mutant will drop 5-8 caps and all the big game monsters drop 20+... If you get familiar with some good spawns for them then you can pretty steadily pile up xp and caps while hunting for legendary mobs. It isn't as fast as whitespring for xp and gear but it's way better for caps and stocking up on meds and junk. 
---
But again if you just want quick caps then nothing comes close to trading. 
---
Not even worth cause that will remove basically all my mutations with a snap
---
Muffled and Sleek misc leg mods exist for marine armor. Shadowed is usually a material, but I've only found it for Leather, Metal, Robot and Combat so far. Might not exist for others.
---
Glowing blood to all 7 vender every day will give you up to 1400 caps a day
---
If you go to bravo site there’s a trail that leads directly to the silo from bravo. Alpha is by a lookout tower and a scorched cabin location north of alpha. Charlie is south. Follow train tracks from Charlie south into a road, the ash heap road has a side trail that will take you to the silo. Next to a mountain ridge close to the Nuclear waste site 
---
It would be cool to see, but it's unlikely. It took them a while to increase the stash limit in case it hurt the servers. Giving each player the option to make their own instance might hurt it even more. But maybe in the future.
---
My 2 ex boyfriends flex

Tormentor is very usefull. Forgot to mention that. If your cripple the wings she won’t fly nearly as much. Good luck. PS when crafting ammo don’t forget ammo smith, super duper and put all your +luck armor on.

It’s funny you don’t have any logical response, just the same thing over and over. What a boring way to live.
---
I don't think it really matters what genre the game is. Both are online-only triple A games in big name series coming from big name studios. I only play the game for zombies, and matches can absolutely last a few hours there if the host doesn't quit (although host migration is a massive issue that people have been asking to fix since launch). 
---
As for the specific breakdown of studios, idk how exactly it's divided. The wikipedia page says it was co-developed with the rest of bethesda. Maybe what you're saying is true, but I just don't feel that they would have decided to let a game this big be developed by only a small portion of their staff
---
Fuck them.
---
I put 250hrs into my Sneaky Assassin Bow build in Skyrim. Ghosting an entire dungeon without being detected is an incredible feeling. Loved every second of it.
---
I have had to resort to a stylus, as a bike courier through the 90's and early 2000 we had blackberry and i could type faster on it then a full keyboard, while riding. I learned to thumb touch type, it doesn't work on a touch screen.
---
My bad, thanks for the save.
---
Ok I'll have to wait for that then.  Thanks for tip
---
wtf hell no. in no game would grinding to get inventory space be cool, what the hell is wrong with this subreddit. 
---
As there is less to lose in a post apocalyptic video game you could take the extra time to see if you're shooting at a family pet. 
---
Yah for me it was post nuke and I got a bunch of lvl 1 eye bots and I am lvl 50 soooooo :(
---
Call me crazy but I’m pretty sure games are suppose to be fun and you don’t have to be good to have fun. If you ask me it seems like they were just jealous of your skills keep having fun and you do you 
---
I saw a camp house built directly above the small pond near the Whitespring/Golf Course Farming Hotspot.
---
You start with a base floor then stack a stairway. Somehow you have to stack another stairway on top but flipped 180 degrees. That allows you to stack the foundation above that while giving no pathways to Ai's. 
---
You'll also have to use the stone wall around the golf course jump up to your base
---
I appreciate it, most of things I lost  wasn't really looking for (aside from Calibrated Shocks &amp; Rusty Knuckles) , 
---
ex: Targeting HUD, VATS Matrix Overlay, Valutboy headlamp, Optimized Servos, Hydralic Bracers, Purple Headlamp, Red Tactical.
---
I'd really like to find reactive plates / tesla coils /jetpack. I'll install any of those immediately if I find them
---
Someone told me he has a timer. Its true because the cow and him just died. Sorry may buddy. Guess neither of us gets a coat. (he didnt have one for me ) :c
---
Yes very frustrating because I thought it was a random chassis that I had scrapped and glitched and didn't scrap.  Ugh thanks tho
---
Level 91 glowing deathclaw - it will eat you if you shoot it.
---
Not on PC, appreciate the offer tho
---
Stick to Welch and server hop.  No caps spent other than the initial hop 
---
This might be since other spawns can cycle through different enemies and It might have glitched and picked protections instead of the ghouls its supposed to have.
---
Not on PC, thanks for offering 
---
I have had the exact same issue today (1/5/2019) multiple times on xbox.  The issue occurs for me when I get a mutation right as I die from rads.  When I respawn, the mutation does not show in the effects list.  This has happened for me with Speed Demon, Talons, Egghead and Carnivore while trying to farm mutations.  It happened for me when I died from rads by drinking toxic water and when I ran into a nuke zone and died from rads.  I have submitted a bug to Bethesda.
---
The high school (not watoga, the other one) lots of plates, cutlery, basketballs, plastic pumpkins.
---
Watoga has a bunch of plastic cutlery too now that I think of it
---
uh, I've stood there all by my lonesome watching the robots pile up by the dozen. 
---
The ghouls are kind of hard to tell, but having done the devil-cursed golfer thing with no one else in the area, also seem pretty endless and utterly unable to clear even momentarily.
---
Yup, another stealthy lady here.  Put your perk cards right, you can take out a surprising amount of enemies in VATS without them even seeing you.  Add marsupial and you can get some great vantage points.
---
Video games aren't meant to be played for someone else; you play them for your own enjoyment. Play it your own way. Well done👍
---
Thanks for sharing, your opinion is important too and have a great day!
---
Not on PC, but thanks for the offer.  Assuming it's not that great then?

Bullies come in any age. They dont stop being bullies at a certain age.
---
I was actually thinking about this the other day! Sounds like an amazing idea to me. Downside is if you move. If I can’t still put my house down after I blueprinted it and it shows green, what luck will you have with your Vault. It is also going to be bad on the building limit. It’s so small in my opinion and it needs to be bigger already. Having a Vault would require a significant increase.
---
I am on PS4, but it's I think because I just unlocked the X01 prototype
---
lmfao wtf are people really asking to farm inventory space?? in what world would that be fun in the least. no, thats a stupid idea for a game that shouldve given you infinite space to begin with.
---
I know, this is a tip more for low level people that cannot face assaultrons yet. I know where to get the regularly. 
---
Ikr?  Or at least label the damn thing!
---
You can use starched genes (if you are a high enough level to unlock it) before getting into the decontamination arch so that you only lose rads and not your mutations. But yeah, eventually you will have to use radaway to cleanse all of them that you don't want
---
Cool man. That was a super quick scorched queen. My mic is kinda shitty so you may not be able to hear me all the time.
---
With low cha and no buffs I've seen them at vendor for 11,5k, so I would imagine no lower than 8 or 9k.
---
I can't say off the top of my head what sort of debuff would cause -4 Endurance. If you have no perks, gear, mutations, diseases, addictions, or any other status showing that would be affecting this, it is quite possible you may have an addiction that is bugged and not showing (common problem). If you do not have an Addictol, you can find a few at Eastern Regional Penitentiary (north of Morgantown). Going to the courtyard and finding the entrance to the Solitary Confinement section (not sure if right name but something along those lines), then in the adjacent cell block there is a cell with an open wall that leads you to a medical area. From entering solitary to finding your way back to the main entrance of the prison there should be about 3-4 addictol spawns.
---
They're such assholes. Games are meant to be fun, as someone who plays games all the time when I'm not at work I take my time. Sure I'm a perfectionist at combat and what not but that doesn't mean I can't have fun or others can't. My girlfriend isn't the best at games but you know what, not everyone is. I give her advice every now and then to help her out and learn the battle scheme if she starts getting annoyed. She has lots of fun and so do I, it's a game. Always have a good time
---
Pro tip: don't be an asshole to people playing games. Just give them advice when they need it or ask for it, let them play how they want. 
---
Wanna do another?
---
Ah, the good old Navarro Run. I have many a 'fond' memory of the endless save-scumming needed to avoid the frequent and super-high-level random encounters you start running into down there as a level 2 peon.
---
Check how much health you have
---
Met a player like that. I avoid him whenever I can.
---
True but I guess assuming they are children was the wrong statement, I guess I should of said acting like children.
---
You have to place (not drop) the PA at the crafting station. Then you can use the menu on the crafting station to craft or modify. If the mod only says "Calibrated Shocks" it might be for the Excavator.
---
Problem is that, right now, I only have 2 to 4 hours to play this game per week
---
Oh I see .. Thanks for the help!
---
Duper’s are out here selling them for like 1.5-2k lol
---
I'll be on tonight! Send an invite to groovyelegant. If you happen to have reached the last mission, we'll be working on that at 11pm PST. Otherwise happy to help out with anything you're working on. 
---
Xbone 
---
Hah. I guess I know why my new spot is so often occupied. I didn't know the silo lid was so close to where I built, I found it by mistake and wondered if it opened. Now I know thanks. 
---
PC. Edited post. 
---
Pretty much this. I’ve never dated a girl who was into gaming (at least not the type of games I like). So whenever I get into a relationship the amount of time I have to game drops drastically. I get maybe an hr or two a night during the week, and during the weekends I am hanging out with my gf so I get zero time to play.
---
My current gf likes Pokémon and party type games (Mario party, super smash brothers, over cooked etc...)
---
It’s not really the type of games I enjoy, I’m a PC gamer, I mostly play RPGs, shooters, MMOs. But at least I can play Skyrim on her Nintendo switch when I’m at her place.
---
OPs bfs sound like dicks and it’s good she broke up with them. I would love to be able to play the games I like with my SO.
---
Yep, I have Ammo Smith and Super Duper, but I do sometimes forget to equip them before crafting :).
---
I haven't kept any luck armor, does having higher luck help the chances in Super Duper?  I have some luck Bobbleheads, and probably some chems and maybe drinks or magazines that might boost my luck too.
---
Go to recent players list and rejoin. Lol. 
---
well you might have trouble soon lmao because i know where im building mine now.
---
You should! Mods lend themselves *really* well to Skyrim. Kinda sucks you're on ps4, because the mods are really locked down on that platform, but there are still lots of great ones. I downloaded lots of quest mods; it's like playing a new game.
---
Meh, I can relate though. I'm currently playing with my GF. Whilst it's overall ok it sometimes is annoying and I literally had to take over (by request) a couple of times to do certain trivial quests (like the military training, hitting the targets (melee though)).  
---
Understandable though, if you don't game your entire life you might be missing some of the reflexes and feel for the game (muscle memory training etc.). Though abuse is lame and childish, that said I'm 30 not sure how old OP is that might change a lot.  
---
And if they're console players also, they sometimes tend to be a bit more verbal I tend to notice (not trying to generalize here).
---
I'm a mom, I don't own my own system and only own the game, totally not a gamer in any sense of the word. I'm lvl 45 and have killed only 2 deathclaws and 2 assaultrons(whatever they're called). The only scorchbeast my character has killed is when I panicked and gave my controller to my 14 yr old. I'm the only ps4 player in a house full of Xboxes, so I have to play by myself. I love this game and will play anyway. Sending you hugs from a fellow wanderer❤.
---
Ah, yes, silly naive me.  I was imagining a world in which dupers didn't exist. :)
---
Thx, do you need to hunt down the code carriers or is it enough to just use the codes online with a keycard?
---
Yew I'm gonna call fucking bullshit but whatever floats your boat
---
I only keep restoratives and Buffout and  if I'm playing melee I use Fury and Psycho. Everything else just gets sold after using some Grape Mentats.
---
As a fellow girl gamer, fuck those guys! Game on sista! 💜 I play similarly to how you do as well and it really pays off when you find all the random hidden things that a lot of people rush through. So you do you! 
---
PsA, running a silo is easier SOLO, the moment you step in with a teammate the difficulty gets ranked up significantly.
---
Yes, this!  You can't have (good) country and folk music without a fiddle!  Closest you can get is a double bass, so that's what I have in my camp, and it still sounds more like a jazzy bass than country.
---
Note that mutation serums are about 4x cheaper when bought from players.
---
Anyone else a bit pissed that the photo storage is capped as well?
---
I’m camped near Grafton and I always see it at the Grafton station vendor. 
---
They cant see you on the map, he blocked you too 
---
Yes it all helps and stacks. More luck helps with super duper. From my experience it won’t make it 100% but it sure helps. 
---
Level five characters into a 50ish build, melee built to survive in a hazmat suit seem to work best.  Start with one character, server hop until you find a nuke zone.  Run around the zone picking plants (equip green thumb to get double the flux) for flux.  Equip the barter perk and fast travel to all seven easy to get vendors (Responder, Raider, White springs, enclave, harper's ferry, BOS in Watoga, and Watoga).  Sell flux at each to max out caps.  If you gather enough flux in one day you can immediately log out and do this for a couple days off of a single farm session gathering.  1400 caps x 5 characters a day = 7000 caps a day.  You can max all five characters at 25k caps in about 2-3 weeks.  Takes about 2 hours unless you get super unlucky with nuke zones.
---
Yea ever since they changed the way loot/Ai spawns; its caused instability especially at Whitesprings due to the abundance of the robots.
---
I believe every time a player spawns at whitesprings, the whole package spawns, and they dont leave until killed off by enemy AIs
---
I know theyve definitely addressed this before...
---
Sadly, I have seen no dulcimers of any sort.  Plucked, hammer, or otherwise.  I am sad about this, too.
---
500+ hours of gameplay counters your bullshit claims, calm down once again 
---
Why only do it to play instruments? I've been a naughty nuddy boy since I stepped out of the vault! 
---
Note that no one ever trades with me
---
Level locking heavy armor plans until you reach a certain level, sure. But removing a plan from rotation after you've passed a certain level, hell no
---
I think it would just be better if they had Active/Passive perk sets or the ability to have favorites perk setups that you can change between using the favorites wheel
---
First, good job ditching the negative nancies.
---
Second, I used to play Skyrim with my wife (then GF) and she’d let me go all berserker and murder things then she’d spend the next minutes collecting everything. Was a great collab.
---
Video games are a great way to learn about fit and people IMO.
---
I do a camp McClintock run every couple of days. For some reason I always find a lot of adhesive and military-grade duct tape (that also gives ballistic fiber). Between that and farming for vegetable starch I have over 250 adhesive. I’m chronically short on screws, though. And I had originally grabbed so much steel scrap that I stopped collecting it altogether - until the other day when I realized I’d gone through it all and was completely out again. 
---
Have you had any trouble with hacking terminals? My ingame says I’m over 76 cause I’m on the back 760 bracket but still not achievement 
---
And scorchbeasts suck

Robots are different, we are talking the glf house and the row of houses. Those respawn when someone new enter the area. Even if the player has been on the server for a while if they come close to whitesprings it will trigger respawn. However it only works once per person, so people force quit the game and load back in on their team thus new respawn.   
---
I hope this fills in the blanks
---
Prove it
---
Seconded. Just get out of the power armor while you're standing on the crafting station. Stupidest mechanic. 
---
I would like this. They could be around the size of the free states bunkers.
---
Expolsive vents dont work, at all. Sorry they can't be bothered to fix it...
---
I used chems heavily in fallout 4. I remember that mission where you gotta save some farmers son from raiders. I popped jet to make the game slow motion and then head shot everyone in the room when I walked in the door before they could kill him.
---
Can’t really do that in fallout 76 so I just sell my chems.
---
Put the game on pacifist mode. 
---
I can be of assistance 
---
That would be hilarious, but it would kinda suck lol
---
You’re really that bothered aren’t you 
---
I hope you at least banned and reported them as well and remembered their names. 
---
I think it's 20 hours after the last time you've sold to them. So if you sell 200 caps worth of items at 4pm, they'll reset at 12pm the next day.
---
They reset every 20 hours
---
Okay Thanks, I thought this might be broken but wanted some input. It would be the one that I get constantly that doesn't work lmao 
---
You don't do it randomly. Use trading forums or discord servers. Plenty of regular serum sellers around.
---
codes on line and the keycard. Also once you have used a silo for the weeks code every time you say do alpha after that you just need to put in a fresh nuke card not the code.  Had a friend that was lost and yelling about how it took his keycard and he couldn't input the code and had to explain you just go card then nuke. 
---
Every server hop. The chance to get one is low though. 
---
If you played BETA you kept your character and whatever levels it gained 
---
Maybe it could be a feature of a hardcore mode
---
1)PS4
---
2)Xachary_Cross
---
3)N/A
---
4)Camp rapidly becomes overbudget inexplcably. Then when moving camp to fix it, items (almost always with crops) are often duplicated (4 plants becoming 18), and the cam budget will be well over 100% (154% last time I moved) as a result.
---
Even clearing the duplicate stored items doesn't seem to repair this without a relog.
---
Reported this back in the beta period, though its become much more of a nuisance as the camp naturally runs closer to budget before the multiplying items.
---
I did use a shared home defense perk to build some turrets, and team mates have built a couple of things I don't have my own plans for, though those objects are not the ones doubling themselves.
---
Mask is from the asylum at fort defiance. Hit me up
---
If you in ps4. You can have mine. The dildo nose is too disturbing!!!!
---
My wife pretty much only plays battlefield. She’s of BF4 now, but on BF3 she was globally ranked in the top ten on Xbox for Russian and American tanks. She can kick ass, and it’s fun to watch her rack up 20 kills before dying. Not bad for a 49-year-old school teacher. 
---
High level role playing right there 
---
I know there is a pacifist mode you can turn on so you won’t be affected your them but I don’t know how you will have to look it up.
---
Games been out like 50 days... If you play 10 hours a day, prove it...
---
Also, nice life
---
Nope. I'm friendly, helpful and I give tons of items away in-game. Try again. 
---
Paints for PA
---
Begone thot
---
Also, a bunch of girls there as well, if you want some sister gaming time. 
---
People can still kill you,you cant hurt other people with pacifist mode enabled
---
Is the plural of that shite-tonne or shit-tonne? Just curious...
---
I’ve never understood people like your exes. There’s literally games out there made exactly for people like you who aren’t the best at shooters and yet you’re enjoying yourself. That’s the only thing that should matter, your fun and enjoyment of whatever it is you’re doing no matter how you’re doing it, especially gaming. I had a friend in a similar spot as you where guys she was with would just tell her she was shit and shouldn’t play, but she really wanted to. She’d avoid gaming with me around because she was worried I’d do the same thing but I encouraged her to play. I just told her it’s more about me enjoying watching someone get more and more into what I’m also passionate about :) congrats on your kill OP! 
---
Also, nobodies like you don't bother me in the least. 
---
Yeah if they block you from the session, they disappear from the map but they still in game and you can see them if you find them. Just go back the work shop and take it back. If you block them you both disappear from the map, meaning you can't them on the map and they can't see you.
---
You can choose your camp or any other location you've visited. 
---
I will use this knowledge you've bestowed 
---
ROTFLMFAO! I'm 72 and I just party with the rest. I have done Whitesprings in a Hazmat suit pulling ghouls onto security when I was level 16 or so.
---
 Its just madness, I would not take it personally myself.
---
*Laughs in gauss rifle 
---
Leave me alone :( I wasted my materials and armor durability for those already :(
---
I mean they should do damage but I think they are also fake
---
Sure thing friend. Hope you get your shit sorted out.
---
To clarify- the reset clock starts at your last interaction with vendor. 
---
Dude try to kill me in my sleep. I woke up and drop a nuke on both of us. Lesson learn.... some players got nothing to lose in order to get even lol
---
Not always handmade plan
---
Plan types aren’t guaranteed awards.  My issue with it is I can’t get it to trigger. 
---
its rng keep doing it.
---
Yep. As they were hitting me into the fissure. 
---
That's Signs and Letters. Small Letters is pretty easy to get if you spam workshop missions. Maybe 1-2k caps if you can find a buyer.
---
I've heard of people dropping their power armor and other people stealing it. I can't understand why anyone would ever need to drop it, so that's why I made the distinction just to make sure I use the right wording. You just place it like as if you're about to get into it. It can be anywhere in front of the crafting station, or you can just exit it while standing in front of it like you said.
---
Nope, lighthouse + server hopping
---
You’re actually that bothered 😂😂😂😂 1 month off for break between quarters let’s me do whatever I want
---
I've had teams run up on me with explosive shotguns and they were doing tickle damage... Don't engage, not that difficult 
---
I believe so
---
You can make vegetable starch it counts as adhesive. I just pick up every vegetable I see now. Tons of adhesive.
---
I wish more of the crafting components could be built. Like if I have a ton of steel I should be able to craft screws and springs from it.
---
My gt is martinez2kid I've been looking for people to group up with
---
Fellow filthy casual here to applaud you on your first scorchbeast. I've only killed them while with my best friend so yay you for doing it alone!
---
Cryolator homie. Makes them easy target practice. Then take out their wing. Bam... downed
---
It would be pretty funny going 'PSSTT!' to a scorch.. Watch it turn around and blasting its face off with a shotgun.
---
The word you're looking for is assholes. Not extremely competitive, just assholes. 
---
To be fair, the overwhelming majority of players. I've encountered have been friendly and helpful. Those that weren't were very single player minded if you know what I mean! 
---
Only been playing a week or so, either I've been lucky or this game does genuinely have a commendable player base. 
---
Kill
---
Loot
---
Return
---
Well said, I was at the golf course trying to level up and this douche comes in and blasts everything in site, looked like a non end stream of fire, I assumed it was a TSE of some sort, anyway I can see how that totally ruins it for everyone else ..
---
Also make sure you block and report if you on XB1 when this happens, it will eventually effect their reputation and by the time they realize it will be too late.
---
Damn you handled this well
---
Kudos
---
Also my tip is to just simply not listen to anyone criticising or dictating something about your play style. Games are about enjoying them, not pummeling through them or being the best. And you don't have to know every studio, every director, worship someone or something. Just enjoy what you play because in the end, experiencing something new and unique is what games is all about. And you do you ^~^
---
Yo send your friend code if you play smash tho i need some friends for that and the smash community is kinda annoying about it 
---
I think this is where cargobots go to after dropping their supply box. Instead of flying off the edge of the map and despawning properly, they just get stuck instead.
---
To hear that folks in their 70s are still gaming it up brings a bit of hope to my life. :)
---
There is only so much they can provide. While they can maybe spoil it with a complete set of armour, stims, food, purified water, ammo and some matts how many people do that?
---
I may pop by and give a decent gun and some ammo with maybe a can or two of food. Really the stuff 1)you should be equipped with from Vaultec 2)something you can realistically expect a companion you've lived 25 years with who has more experience in the Rad zone.
---
If you don't want it don't pick it up. I would have loved some help getting out of the Vault and once I met up with my team mates I pretty much did. 
---
I think after publishing his spot online you might have some issues! 
---
First time I saw ants I thought, easy, just tap them with the pistol. Nope, full Auto shotgun clip required. 
---
The new players dont need to accept your help if they want to have that kind of experience.
---
&gt; sad Fallout Guy
---
That's my favorite way of referring to him
---
Like others have said, tat's exactly how I play. It ain't sit gaming, it's strategy!
---
Oh I’m totally an idiot, but only because it makes people laugh.
---
Sorry I missed you.   I wasn't around yesterday.   I'll be home later this evening. 
---
Username?
---
Maybe your guys hungry? (I dunno.. Quick guess)
---
&gt;Unfortunately, the number of the world owes me this kind of recognition and all the women brand of incel is very rampant in the gaming world of today.
---
For anyone else whose eyes were crossing. OP, I don't usually bother correcting English on the internet - but in this case, at first read your sentence actually says the opposite of what you mean. 
---
Yeah like one of those tour of houses some neighborhoods have.  You can see them on the map, visit ,then vote for your favorite one.
---
Do what I do take pacifist off grab a furious high speed gun with expo and kill them.  I try my best to tag and not kill the ghouls. But man the moment some tool whips out the expo shotty starts hopping around thinking they are the queens shit taking every kill and not letting others get anything, I go full dick mode kill them even if they are in passive and their friends 9you can tell if they try and pvp you) pull out my insta expo double barrel and go to town killing everything and I will do this until they give up.   
---
I am also petty enough to find out where their camp is and nuke it. Then follow them later to a new server and nuke it again and again and again.   
---
Otherwise I am a fairly decent human and try and not take all the ghouls for myself  just giving them love taps with my unperked normal 50 cal. 
---
Sounds like you really know how to choose your guys.
---
Ha lol I love doing that it's way easier to get loot when your weapons arnt thT strong to lead the ghouls into security 
---
See, thats where you're wrong. They had a hotfix on the 2nd to fix the nukes.
---
  I found this:
---
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1UcE5LQgFfopwevJuoi3w_Q2Q8Z7WyYAv
---
 Now I want it. ;(
---
I was using my super Sledge genius. The person who killed me was using a shotgun. He kept jumping in front of me to try and take damage whenever I was swinging a ghouls
---
Ah, you're right.  Always conflate the two.
---
Me: *Heavy breathing*
---
*Gets shot by scorched.*
---
There's another issue with it as well where after activation the SB lands and gets stuck too far from the event location.
---
Well first of all thats just one of the problems, but either way when you're at your workshop and a guy with an explosive dragon walks up wanting to be an ass and starts to claim my workshop from me (which forces me into PvP), theres not much I can do other than suck it up
---
Just be prepared next time and switch servers if you run into bullies, never swear or text. Bullies will be bullies nothing you can do and grab their names and block and report every single one of them.. can't tell you how many I have blocked and reported.
---
How the hell did u get in!?!?!?
---
If by "could" go on here to rant about things you meant "am doing so right now" then you're a winner.
---
I'm okay with the devs patching the game at the current rate because I realize that they're human beings and need a holiday as well. They're going to continue patching the game, and patching it, and patching it.
---
Peace out, though. It's honestly helping this subreddit when angry, bitter fools quit the game.
---
oh well, thanks for the thought
---
Yes happens to me a lot.
---
Ipso facto
---
Yes there is hope.
---
Dashboard don’t quit out or it will try to throw you back in the same server.
---
I will look for the plans later..
---
I can never find the one I crash out from but I joined the same one 3 times in a row trying to get my base to spawn today. Roll eyes. 
---
I was using my super Sledge. I keep my TSE on me at all times, but mostly I use melee weapons especially for farming. I'm not a cheeselord by any means
---
Yeah bit shit at that tbh
---
I don’t know a ton of other games that crash this frequently 
---
You can't play most instruments in the golf skirt (and most skirted) outfit for the same reasons... I sit down with a tuba and you can see my whole wind section.  Double bass it is for me.
---
As a relatively new player (currently level 15) I have been thoroughly impressed by how friendly and helpful the vast majority of players I've met have been. 
---
Pretty much this... I can count in one hand how many times I've seen it the past few weeks
---
It would be funny when some kid starts yelling in the background about a sandwich and the mom has an open mic for all to her watch her get slaughtered by a hoard of supermutants. 
---
Yeah dude or dudette if someone is hitting you on whatsapp 24/7 you said "omg he is so interested what a cutie" ? Or you get annoyed? 
---
There is a difference
---
Tbh I'm level 55 and I've not solo killed a scorchbesst yet so well done! 
---
Thats because their end game was ACTUALLY unplayable because of yet another bug in the game. Did they fix anything else in that hotfix? (Not trying to be sarcastic or an ass or anything, I just actually didnt bother reading it cause im so fed up with the game at this point)
---
You should have followed him home,then called a orbital strike on his base.
---
Well - given the loading icon persists it looks to me like a bug. Also in the previous games loot didn't disintegrate from turning enemies to ash, and from gameplay perspective that would give laser weapons a big disadvantage - which is the issue I'm kinda running into right now.
---
Don't bother with PvP if you value your sanity.  
---
It's pure game design cancer.
---
Is it really a huge issue of people running around and randomly killing other player? I have yet to have this happen even once. Have I just been super lucky in this? I see people complaining about it but I have never seen it. 
---
I made switch to only .50 and flamer or plasma gat. The mini guns just seem to eat ammo to fast i couldn't keep up. I have a bloodied plasma gat so that's nice and every third ghoul seems to drop a plasma core or 2. Make sure to take gunsmith 5 and weapon artisan. At max artisan make fun last twice as long. Go through 5 or 6 cores before breakage. 
---
just nuke the workshop it is the sane thing to do and the only message people like that understand. 
---
I would, but at the rate I'm consuming purified water in FO76, I rarely get the chance to make starch before I need the adhesive. 
---
Wait does someone actually use Chems? 
---
It’s the opposite for me. I typically blitz through my first play through, using a horrible build, and only completing the main story. I’m very impatient and really enjoy the story of most of the games I play. My second, third, and forth playthroughs are when I slow down, take my time creating a build, and either role play a toon or try to complete and explore everything. 
---
i have an extra
---
Well I just discovered my new favorite sub, r/fo76filthycasuals, so as you can imagine I'm a total scrub who previously relied on VATS to more calmly get me through the combat parts of the game and allowed me to experience the stories.
---
I'm only level 14 in Fallout 76  a. partly because I didn't consider how much a persistent world with no safe havens, even in my own camp, would affect my anxiety and b. partly because I'm struggling with killing things because I'm terrible and panicky.
---
1) I haven't logged in in a few weeks, but I recall I have two ranks of lone wanderer, have not yet found any power armor, I've put a good number of points in agility and perception, I'm trying to stick with rifles, pistols and shotguns but I'm thinking I should narrow it down more and drop one of the three. I'd love to find a great scoped hunting rifle and some stealth armor. I have a lot of patience but very little chill. 
---
2) My desire from stealth is to minimize jump scares and clear myself space to finish quests, gather and explore. Every mob I aggro makes me jump out of my skin, so avoiding mobs all together or distance kills is my ultimate goal. I use stealth to try to maintain some control over when and how often I will jump out of my skin since it's very uncomfortable to be so on edge all the time. Unfortunately I'm having a miserable time with mob seeing right through my stealth and an even worse time trying to kill them when they get to me. For these reasons I mostly hang out at my CAMP. I really didn't realize how much I'd miss having a combat companion to explore with. (I don't feel like I can substitute a real person without judgement). 
---
I feel like ultimately, fo76 was a bad choice for someone with such a severe anxiety disorder, but I love exploring the Fallout universe so I keep trying when I can. And even though it would likely go against lore, I do hope one day there is a safe haven gathering place, like a Fallout version of Stormwind, where you can relax and let the guards do the worrying.
---
I can from experience say that they don't help, or at least in my case they didn't. I placed turrets on high ground with help of defense structures, and spotlights obviously spotting in front of them on the ground. And then I watched a wild mongrel dog just casually stroll (not run) towards me while gracefully passing by the spotlight without turrets or spotlights noticing.
---
Must be a bug or something, but I didn't notice that much of a difference using one.
---
I mean how much experience does it take to know to fix game changing exploits as soon as possible?
---
Good for you. My SO plays games with me and sometimes it drives me because she's like "Ooo flower, Ooo flower, Ooo item" stopping every few minutes to pick up ingredients. That's just how she plays and I'll sit there quietly watching her knowing when it's my turn she has set me up with a ton items to make stuff with. I help her with the combat and she usually helps with puzzles. Teamwork makes games a lot less stressful and more fun.
---
Games aren't about who's the best but a form of entertainment and a ride a couple can enjoy together. 
---
Why can’t I find codes who has nukes I wanna be in the blast zone for the love of all that is holy how do I get there when is it happening Xbox.  Gt:ghop954 
---
They're just getting back from holidays, pretty sure that hotfix was pushed during their break
---
&gt;It is hard to justify to \[anyone\] that doesn't game that it is not a nonsense hobby
---
Ask them how much TV they watched this week and how the local team of Sportsball millionaires are doing.
---
I laughed at this way harder than I probably should 
---
No, trust me my guy theres a WHOLE LOT of other things I could complain about. And honestly we are on the same team here idk why you getting all hostlie. I want the game to be fixed cause I love fallout, if you just let them do whatever they want and act like there is nothing wrong with the game we are all gonna stay with a broken game
---
Therein lies 2 problems. I play mostly alone, since I'm the only person in my friend group that really plays Fallout. I have a couple people I run with occasionally online, but nothing like a team of 8 as you suggest. Lone Wanderer level two is a must for me at all time. That brings me to my second Point, any game that relies on a perk system to determine damage is flawed. I'm not a min max build, and I find the entire concept to be stupid.
---
This would happen to me 😂 my kids have to see what I’m doing at every moment in the day. And they are never quiet. 
---
"The night we broke up, I marched myself to the shops to go and buy it, red nose and teary eyed."
---
Its like I'm reading one of those todd howard green texts. Scorchbeasts can't be lower than level 50 by the way so it definitely wasn't "only a level 40"
---
Burn it to the ground!
---
Not much, but you can't go around criticizing Fallout 76 around here. These white knights will be the downfall of whatever F76 can achieve because their head is so far up Bethesda's asshole. Unless you have some super cheesy post about "i thought f76 was bad but now i know it's not" or "i met a level 8 who became the hero of my life" you'll get nowhere with them.
---
Congrats! :D
---
Good to know! Thanks! 
---
Same here girl. I am constantly sneaking, taking my time, looting absolutely everything, and pretty much doing whatever the fuck I want. 
---
I was playing with a friend who was stomping around in power armor while we were exploring and out of nowhere a huge lvl 80 Mirelurk Queen comes out and kills my lvl 50 friend in one shot. 
---
Now I'm in stealth mode the entire time and have put all my points into stealth and I'm only lvl 25. I have one piece of chameleon armor so this bitch queen can't see me, so I slowly back up and start taking shots at this behemoth, getting extra crits for being in stealth mode. 
---
My lvl 50 friend eventually comes back and helps my kill her but I was just so proud of myself for playing it smart. No matter where I go, even if it takes more time, I go in stealth. 
---
Play smarter, not harder my friends!
---
Yeah, it’s super funny messing up other people’s games for your own amusement. Then putting them on the internet for other like minded people to enjoy. 
---
I quite like the system as it is now
---
Fuck that guy, he sounds like an ass wipe. You do you boo
---
Those guys seem like ash mains who rush obj and step in a bear trap or die instantly to a dude holding an angle. 
---
From what I recall of my reading on advanced communications in a relationship, I'm pretty sure they both need to be kicked in the nads.
---
Maybe in just very unlucky lol but there is people out there that are getting their hands on stupid dooped explosive guns and just want to run around being asses
---
Camden Park’s vendor can stock that plan, if you feel like a change of scenery. 
---
I’m sure I’ll be on tonight but I’m in EST so I’d have to figure out the time difference. I’m samusaurusrex in game so feel free to add me. Also I admin on a discord if you’re interested. 
---
 Yeah I did a dry run solo and it was quite doable. I did use up a bit of 50 caliber ball ammo though. I love my Executioners Black Powder Pistol. ;) You could do it many different ways though. I think fixing the pipes is the hardest part.
---
There are plenty more of these pvp flagging exploits. That's what happens when you have stupid pvp flagging system.
---
There once was an XP exploit that got patched 
---
Mageweave bags didnt bind. You could sell then in the AH ffs.
---
That's an acceptable downside of choosing to team up with a **random**.

How do you get them to camp? Just pacify and walk?

I was like 99% sure it was, maybe I'm mistaken 🤷‍♀️

Though crash bandicoot in fallout would be a first purchase for me if it was in the Atom shop.
---
&gt;extremely insecure
---
I know plenty of competitive people who don't think "competing" means treating someone like shit.
---
My rule of thumb is focus on 1-2 max types of weapons, and get all of the perks that effect those. I’d focus on melee OR explosive. Then if your not running power armor use your charisma for bodyguards or lone wanderer depending on if your alone or not, also luck of the draw isn’t needed, all of the weapons you plan on using don’t attack very fast or use a lot of durability per shot, I honestly only find luck of the draw to work well on faster firing semi’s and auto’s. 
---
I'm not being hostile. I didn't even call **you** an angry, bitter fool. What I implied was that every toxic person that comes here to bitch and say things that basically boil down to "devs don't deserve a break, they need to patch ever 3 days" improve the community when they finally take off.
---
Yeah there were a few and the battle bot event glitch too
---
I'm lvl 100 and haven't finished half of the brotherhood story missions.  I haven't encountered the enclave people spoil on here all the time, and I missed a bunch of side quests from the beginning i'm working on now.  Live your life. 
---
Can you go on right now.
---
I always sneak and take it slowly.  Hell I'm level 55 and I still have quest to do.  
---
You have a point

I'd kms from excitement if my gf took up vidya

Asking people to not be an asshole does not make you an asshole.

Thank you. But I found one at harpers. Appreciate it!

That’s cute how you aren’t responding since I have proof

I had this great idea to roll a char named Gucci so my bags would say "Made by Gucci" but the name was rejected. Either someone beat me to it or Blizzard was savvy to the idea. I was heartbroken.
---
Since you're hard capped on daily vendor sales anyway, I've actually started using chems in FO76 for the first time in a FO game pretty regularly. Otherwise they just get tossed. *The economy drove me to drugs*
---
How about the order of mysteries faction quest line? Or the responder that is trapped in the closet at Morgantown Airport? I know some like to complain about the lack of NPCs, but I think the story telling is amazing. 
---
Why would people down vote this comment?
---
Well from what I’ve noticed it nets the most resources. I usually take a day or two wandering around, doing events, building up supplies. 
---
Completely agree.  
---
When I started the game I was prepared to skip most holotapes and just focus on tapes that were important for the main quest.  I gave this one a try and was hooked on listening to them all.
---
 The Freddie Lang tape is beautifully acted and heartbreaking.  It's a somber refresh from a lot of the comedy in the game.  Well done everyone involved.
---
KMooreLod 👌
---
Just relax and enjoy the game do some exploring and take a break for the missions. Enjoy finding all the little nooks and crannies. The game is more fun when you take your time and not smash through the levels as quick as possible.
---
Despite the negativity surrounding this game the lore is actually exciting to discover. Take time to read the terminals and listen to the holotapes. 
---
Don’t just rush through the levels you’ll regret it in the long run. 
---
Yeah they get overwritten/deleted if you replace them
---
I don't know tbh. I don't know the statistics on shotguns at all. I just know what I saw...someone knocking down hordes of ghouls with a TSE double barrel shotty. 
---
Oh cool! Thanks! ( i started yesterday and haven’t died yet)
---
Lvl 50 here to say that since I started gunning mostly solo, I’ve find myself being very cautious of most fights I end up getting into, I do carry around chems but I don’t like using them. Just kind of a last resort option for when i’m in over my head. I don’t like getting into fights I don’t know I can’t win with anything and even then I usually stop and try to plan a bit ahead for tougher encounters.
---
Then at the end of the day trouble just ends up finding me before I’m prepared to fight a potato anyway haha. There’s no right way to play Fallout, those guys were dicks. Play what makes you happy however you want. It’s your playthrough, your choice on how you want to play. Don’t let anyone else tell you you’re playing the “wrong” way because there isn’t. Good job on taking down a cancer bat at that level solo, I would’ve crapped myself at the thought of it. XD
---
I took it slow and easily in f76 too. I’m level 47 (exploring give you good xp) and I am nowhere near done the main quest line.
---
I can't fast travel as I am always encumbered, but I try hit a stash box the moment I see one at either one of my 2 camps or at a red rocket location. I try stash as often as possible. I do curse when I lose my junk to server crashing and nonsense like you die twice and your first bag disappears.
---
AH thanks
---
I'm thinking that was more due to the explosive effect than the 2 shot.
---
I have 15 luck. Got one every hop, most before I was almost dying. Only had to radaway 3 times without a mutation. Maybe use a luck bobblehead or such
---
Doesnt matter, something was broken and they fixed it, thus negating your argument.
---
Appreciate your proof... Now show me the proof I asked for... 
---
My bear has been killed dozens of times. They always respawn for me
---
Just had 2 players trolling one of our crew members.  So we rolled two 4 man hit crews and a 2man spotter and bounty crew. We just ruined their trolling day and both of their bases...lesson of the day is dont troll a player because he might have friends. 
---
Maybe you're too banal I hope? :D
---
ye logging in now
---
I scrap/stash my junk typically how often I would quicksave in a game.
---
Oh I know how it is I have a 10 and 8 year old, and the blaze through the game room for no reason other than to irritate me since their playroom is off the sitting room. It is a kid thing you talk they disturb. 
---
I came online this morning with a random ass 10 cap bounty on me and when I entered the server I was immediately killed by someone who then took my 43 Hardened Mass I collected last night. I was pretty pissed.
---
I had 3 missile turrets.  And 2 spotlights geared toward enemies....I'll never forget they targeted and attempted to murder my teammate.  (No bounty. No attacks) he fast traveled in and they ignored the 3 super mutants and a scorch beast to shoot him.  We were teamed up...no damage and refused to engage ANYTHING else.  Finally I moved my camp the spot lights barely help but if there is a blade of grass between it nope can't see.   Them I walk up on a transmit bunker andbthwir turrets reach out and engage me before they render in....
---
Sometimes you just gonna James Bond ur way around
---
It's like every 20 hours or so
---
Yeah this is largely why I have the Note as my last 2 phones, Edge and now 9. FFS screw your automangle i'll just write it down.
---
On the Note 9, the 'screen off' memo function is actually pretty fantastic. The biggest barrier to the usefulness of these things in a practical sense - and this has been right from the beginning of the "PDA" idea (I tested Newton for a week), is workflow and usability. With the 9 I can pick up the phone, take out the stylus, and start writing instantly. Finally the damn thing is useful and not a further hindrance to getting shit done.
---
Another stealth lady checking in. Where do I sign up?
---
What?
---
Are you on ps4?
---
I love your nuke screenshot it is quite rad 10/10
---
 Definitely make sure the main quest lines are active in your data tab of your pipboy
---
Yeah, like the ps2 textures and the uninspired holotapes.
---
You have to sell before you buy. They can only have a max of 200 caps. Plus when you buy stuff they only get about 1/4 of that into their balance.
---
Wish they would make a Male version, have no interest in spending that kind of money towards an outfit designed for a woman.
---
Prices are high but the lack of anything interesting in the shop is even higher. 
---
See, that's the beauty of games like these I think. There's no ***wrong way*** to play. You can play however you want and do whatever you want. You do you! You don't need no man! ;D
---
That's exactly how you play an RPG. You're doing it right, and those guys suck. You will find someone who knows how to play video games, and how to treat you.
---
I think the real question is who trained these molerats to be stealthy assassins
---
Nothing wrong with the Perk Card System in general; just certain perk cards.
---
But the Perk Loadout Manager Mod being a popular mod is also a hint that there are flaws in the design. Especially when a community manager acknowledged how they'll mention to the devs to add this mod into the game.
---
You don't have to engage, just let them take your workshop, any cares .. find another server, blueprint your stuff, engaging in PVP lets them win .. I know it is hard to not want to engage but you need to force yourself. I see so many workshops now days and hardly no one contests mine, I actually don't bother with workshops anymore except when I get to complete a daily challenge, but even then rarely does anyone take my workshop because they can't be bothered ..
---
Every once in a while, the types of enemies cycle on a server. 
---
Instead of friendly robots defending the fence-line, you might get glowing mole miners. Instead of ghouls in the club, you might get robots. 
---
I’ve once had it where the club was filled with rad rats. That was annoying - stupid things can take a super sledge to the head and survive. 
---
I was in a game yesterday where there was a wanted person for 5 caps in his base. What do I do? Kill the wanted player (like any sane person would), take his multiple bulked items, his friend shoots me, I kill him too and take his loot as well. Needless to say it was a good day.
---
Yeah, I know, and I'm not it spoils the whole game for them, but it kinda forces your experience onto them right away.  It's not so much the items that I'm thinking about, but sort of the mood of the early game.  
---
They obviously can't go back to day 1 where everybody was fresh, but maybe they could match players to servers based more on character level.
---
Yep, which is why Bethesda's game *requires* a server browser. The only possible excuse for not having one is having a single-shard world, like EVE. Anything beyond that, from WoW to Team Fortress 2, tends to have a server browser to give the players some control.
---
Congrats on your first Scorchbeast kill!  Those things are tenacious, especially when you're lower level. And congrats on ditching a couple of shitty boyfriends.  As a woman who's been playing games since I was a wee child, I can tell you, there's no 'right' way to play games. (There are definitely a few wrong ways: like being a dick to other people).  I played pretty much the entirety of FO4 on sneak mode, all 200+ hours of it.  In FO76 I have just about every sneak/sniper perk card equipped and can most often be found up on a perch outside an encampment sniping things.
---
And on a more serious note, date someone who helps you find joy in the things you like.  Date someone who respects your interests and hobbies, because respecting how you spend your time means they *respect you*.  If your partner can't respect how you spend your time, they aren't worth yours.
---
A lot of them do have some nice passives with them which I think is another great incentive to making these cards less situational.
---
Stash your junk and die intentionally if you want to get rid of rads free and easy. You can also go to Emmett Disposal Site as there is a decontamination unit there that will clear your rads if you don't want to do the dying thing. There are also some Hazmat Suits there make sure to have a good look around the entire place, there are a few different Hazmat Suits available.
---
You go girl! Fucking hate ppl who doesn't let other enjoy thing cuz they think it's the wrong way to play. Happy hunting! 
---
I rarely go to 2 places without stashing.
---
Betwern train stations, red rocket and my base there is always one close by
---
It's not so bad... you can add reload speed or armor piercing if you want though.
---
The more important question is how does a deathclaw lose to a supermutant?
---
Happens with the porta potty also if one person is sitting and another forces their way in they can die. It seems kinda random not to easy to replicate, we tried. 
---
good lord
---
I can see that happening.
---
Reminds me of World of Warcraft's glyph system
---
I’m 90 and still play video games. Fallout brings back memories of my childhood. 
---
This is how I ended up with an 8×4 "patio".
---
I suspected as much.... there goes 400 caps I guess haha.... I caught my self a split second to late that I had applied the medic pump like I wanted and pushed the wrong button on the other mod... O well thanks
---
 Stash your junk before going into combat? Like what do you want? No penalty for dying in this game?
---
Honestly, just take all the time you need. I rushed into that game to complete every single objective I could and finished it before the start of christmas, now I just wander around the map bored all the time waiting for them to add more content 
---
 * Be in your camp
---
 * Nuke warning quest starts
---
 * Don't bother checking map because I'm nowhere interesting
---
 * Be absorbed in building your tower
---
 * Sudden loud detonation sound
---
 * Wonder briefly if you have perhaps fucked up and should have checked map
---
Then I realized I'd stumbled across a silo cover while looking for this resource node, hence running to the window to look in its direction, and sho'Nuff.
---
I haven't really seen anyone using chems in fallout games other than the occasional streamer using whichever one slows down time. Oh, and stacking buffs to charisma to get the 100% settlement happiness perk in 4. Other than that you sound like you're playing it like the rest of us do :P
---
Sure thing, good luck. Will add next time i start up
---
If the other raiders were anything like you, no wonder they're all dead.
---
Try and kill a few ghouls.  They regularly drop rad away and rad-x.
---
Thanks for the suggestion. I will definitely check it out. 
---
Found the password holotape right next to the skeleton with another isaac holotape beside it, at the lowest level.
---
I have the last two missions: Belly of the Beast and the other one. Unfortunately, my char is all jacked up b/c of mistakes. I'm trying to make it a 2hd/rifle build. I have a lot of stuff I need to get rid of as well. I don't know any people who would benefit from completing the main story and don't want to waste firing a nuke. If done right, we can hit Whitesprings for a lot of XP and loot.    
---
I'm on PC as well and my user is: DocB30tn
---
That... Cannot be real. I refuse.
---
Every time I see a stash. If I have important junk such as stable flux I stash immediately.
---
Yeah I am
---
I really don't get how these guys even enjoy playing the game, what is the end game for them, must be boring .. so what if you have a kazillion weapons or 125000 caps, who cares, but then what ?
---
I can only imagine they get bored and go play something else.
---
Ahh interesting, I had foolishly assumed the opposite since it recommends 8 people for the optional mission. Definitely less fun alone though :-(
---
Your pretty awsome.!👍😏
---
Can confirm. Check out r/fo76bazaar
---
First mistake: You grouped with a random, expect the unexpected.
---
Second mistake: You engaged in a PvP fight that even though you didn't initiate, without first depositing all of your junk you collected first.
---
Yeah, it's an extremely flawed system that has to go, but play around it so you don't get fucked over. I've had that happen where I lost 100+ screws. Always drop your stuff off and be cautious of randoms you group with.
---
You need the tame option to get them to your camp. You can only tame randomly encountered creatures, and you need both animal friend &amp; wasteland whisperer as far as I know.
---
My current spot has some unfriendly neighbors so I'm thinking about moving my camp. Any ideas for a camp location with at least a bit of player traffic and a junk/lead node?
---
If you plan on collecting some more mods for other power armour, be careful theres currently a bug that makes you scrap them for there base materials
---
Now I'm gonna go hang out on silo covers to see if I fall inside.
---
I love the sound of these actually! You need a job at Bethesda!! 
---
Fun. I'll most likely be using the Plasma Gatling. Only problem with it is it breaks relatively quickly. Will need to bring some backup weapons. 
---
How long does it take to dupe that much? I assume it's exponential but I've got better things to do with my life than force a server to glitch. 
---
who knows, so many plans are bugged, but i sadly doubt it.
---
Edit: Very interesting. 
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_dulcimer
---
I definitely haven't seen that yet. I would imagine someone on the sound team either knows about it or ran across it doing research for the game, so here's hoping.
---
There is a fiddle at White Springs, Exit the resort out the clubhouse side and immediately turn right and jump up over the white railing.  You will find it next to a Nuka Quantum.  It's just scrap unfortunately.  
---
The most popular, favorite spot is basically the most controversial spot as well.
---
Thanks for letting me know. Any suggestions on where to look for ghouls?
---
You have understood the best way to enjoy Fallout.
---
Congrats on your first SB kill! Still waiting for mine.
---
I’m not going to have my friend send me screenshots because you can’t accept obvious proof. Looking through your profile I see you’re a noob and that’s understandable
---
Sounds like those guys did not know what the hell they were talking about.
---
You can't tell people they are bad at this game. I was reading a thread about a guy soloing site bravo and how it was so difficult and he was happy when someone showed up to help him because he was out of ammo. I soloed the nuke launch. It was easy.
---
I don’t think I’ve ever used chems in any fallout. Feared addiction. 
---
My deathclaw is only lvl 21 and the supermutants that spawn by my camp are higher lvl than that.
---
Yeah, I know not everybody is looking for the same early game experience.  If you want to play with friends that are already leveled up, that's your choice, but if somebody is camping at 76 or the early quest locations, you're kinda forced to play a part in their "end game" whether you take the items or not.  
---
Yeah I am on PS4
---
Yeah my speech is really bad i don't have any confidence to talk in english, i prefer type/writing 
---
That'd be 1am EST. Hopefully see you tonight! I'll likely be on earlier as well collecting Stims and mutations. 
---
Where do you spawn?
---
Honestly, do fertile soil near flatwoods, and collision course. You get lots of Stims, purified water and scrap and loot. Radaway you can find in first aid boxes at Morgantown airport 
---
I really don't think some stim packs and water are going to spoil someone's game.
---
My current favourite spot is right between the overseers camp, and the bridge crossing the river.
---
Because of its position many people will walk by it, and hopefully come to visit.
---
Thanks for letting me know
---
It is  I just sold him a piece of armor and then started to browse what hes got looking for 5.56
---
This is kind of why I was curious what the community as a whole felt overall. I know my opinion, but like to always see and hear other points of view in case I might be wrong or think differently from hearing another perspective. 
---
Ok.  Add me,  VillainesSarah.  I'm not on right now,  but I can totally help you out with some stuff (including some weapons and armor you might need). Plus,  when I first began,  it was nice having another player around to guard my junk when I died, etc. 
---
Definitely check the farms near vault Tec.... power armor chassis in some of their workshops. 
---
Even if it's too high a level for you,  pick it up.  Stash it until you can use it.  
---
Not really, the code pieces are only for figuring out the nuke launch codes, which is an endgame quest/event
---
Whitespring Golf Course 
---
I agree. It's like God mode in Sims
---
Lotta fiber in that razorgrain!
---
Sadly no one I know is remotely interested in the game. Or most games I like lol. Closest I came was we were all playing ARK for a while, but they've moved on from that, which is kinda funny since now I finally have a rig that could run ARK without catching fire. Oh well.
---
I'm hoping the private server thing is real and I might be able to lure some of them in; I have a 1U set aside for it I snagged when work was giving away retired boxes destined for scrap.
---
Yea seriously Bethesda, this is getting really out of hand.
---
At this point, I think its safe to say they really don't know how to fix the issue at all. 
---
I can understand if theyve been silent about this so they dont promote the exploit even further, but how much time would they even need if it is placed at its highest priority?
---
Few times I tried more than once per server. Wasn’t sure if I should keep trying over and over or jump to a new one. Either way no go.
---
Bout to drop
---
Nothing wrong with having your own playstyle. I tell my wife all the time that I don't care how good she is. It's just fun when she joins me and when she has fun. The games that I don't like to go at a slower pace I just don't play with her. I'd never attack her for the way she plays anything. Except when she uses cheat codes on the Sims.
---
Bethesda doesn't have tools to recover lost items so not much to do here. Sucky situation but I can't see how you'd drop all your high end items while they ng to get rid of holotapes.
---
On in about 5
---
You asked one of them specifically if they are stupid in the head and you get banned?
---
That sounds horrible. Better report it to the police.
---
If you are really anxious about getting jumped, team up with people. I'm not that high level too (just hit 30). I felt I'd never get good but it happens. If you want I could play with you too. Maybe if I clear out areas for you, you could explore a bit more freely, till you are high level enough to handle yourself? 
---
Join me bout to drop
---
Ok i already found two so far so badluck i guess 😂
---
Handmade plans are a possible drop.
---
One that I think is less weighted than other plans.
---
Bout to start
---
If you are on ps4, you can add me TrainerSeb and I can help you out with quests and provide extra firepower. I have decent amount of ammo I can spare as well.
---
Pretty funny! Jokes on him... I got a bunch of free loot haha
---
Good work! Don't screw those wieners who said you have to play their way to have fun. 
---
Well once you nuke fissure prime the entire server gets a notification that scorched earth event has begun, and then it just recommends 8 people regardless. The story mission says to optionally nuke fissure prime with 8 people it doesn’t recommend to run the silo with 8 people.
---
I’m at 10 Luck or higher I think. Need to double check that.
---
Oh sure, build up my hopes for three sentences and then dash my dreams to pieces with the last :P
---
What platform do you play on? If you ever wanna play with another "shit" girl gamer, lemme know! I also just putz around collecting stuff, exploring, doing side quests, listening to holotapes and generally taking my sweet ass time lol Im only lvl 36 or so now, I believe...been working overnights all season so haven't had much time to really dive on in there, but I'm back to daylight hours now so time to get cracking!
---
[Questions?](https://imgur.com/a/bMO0037) 
---
I saw that post about high level players doing that for new comers. I thought about that because I like to give away stuff. But there's only a Concrete Deposit nearby. For the water, it's fine. Also, the Mill is right next door, so you can get a bunch of wood, too. 
---
You could use I believe the weaponsmith perk keeps your guns from breaking as fast, I lvl 5 weapon Smith with melee + lucky break with max luck and I’ve never had to repair any weapon.
---
Baller
---
There's only one reply for these assholes: bullets through their heads. In the game, of course.
---
This is way too late virgin boy. 
---
What's that? What do you mean?
---
I don't hate the game. I'm happy that Bethesda is trying something new, but I'm angry with how misleading they were leading up to the release. I think it should be very clear to everyone who plays the game that has played any other fallout game (except for shelter of course) just how rushed the world design is, and how Bethesda has strayed so far from what the majority of their player base has been asking for. The game was made by a developer with no experience in the engine. Loot boxes are in the game's code, so get ready for those. They've butchered the class roleplay system, and I won't be surprised if they keep it as is for the next big fallout title, if there ever is one.. 
---
I'm genuinely sorry to have upset people but I don't think I should have been downvoted to hell like that, though. I wasn't  being hateful, ya'll are just oversensitive.
---
I hate to say it but the most likely scenario is you simply fall through the terrain mesh into an infinite void; or possibly into a plain blank cylinder and die.
---
But then again, if you do discover that some Beth artist snuck in a fully detailed launch silo, best video ever
---
...right before you hit the bottom and die xD
---
I’d like to see the crossbow buffed, I think it has a lot of potential for sneak builds.
---
Hey buddy - get on anxiety medication, hop on okcupid and make a sincere, low key profile. Your life can change for the better but only if you take the initiative. 
---
Same with the robots in Watoga after you get on the white list. Non-hostiles across thr board show up red too often.
---
I don’t think you should leave, but this issue does need to be resolved. The problem is how can they catch and punish the dupers. 
---
Did you put your camp at the same place overlooking Prickett's Fort? I love the view.
---
Better call the waaambulance. I can't talk to my friends tonight homie. That sucks. 
---
Probably Whitesprings Golfcourse
---
Okay I will. Thanks for offering to meet with me In game on,y problem is that my mic is broken so I'm planning on buying a new one soon. I will check out the farms near vault tech
---
Not sure why you have to be a dick. I was wondering the same thing too, for the same reason.
---
I do not really like the fights in fallout3-4. But I LOVE to discover the world. Same in The Witcher3. Fights are meeeeh. Got a mod to do more damage and keep enjoying to discover the worlds. :D

Ugh. Can you at least let us know it’s Juicehead? 
---
Tip to help kill a scorchbeast easier, use a stealth boy (or have a chameleon armor piece) and fire a silenced weapon at it, make sure there is a lot of space around you, this will cause the scorchbeast to land right in front of you and you can sneak shot it in the face a bunch of times and hopefully kill it before it sees you
---
Its never really the seller/manufacturers fault that a gun was stolen to them. You cant expect everybody to follow the rules even when background checks are performed.
---
In europe are you going to blame the truck manufacturers for people using those as weapons?
---
I used to be right at the Top of the World. Right where that little pond is, just southwest of it, there's a Junk Deposit. So, it's "close" to water (You can't set your camp down where you can catch both the Junk deposit AND the water). But you have very close approximation to the water, AND to the Shop. Not to mention the Top of the World, with high level enemies. That used to be my favorite spot before I found my current one. 
---
Too late to answer your request?  Didn’t realize this was time sensitive.  
---
Oh and virgin boy?   Good one...   keep working on those social skills, junior.  
---
Watoga on the north border where the red building is, right by the antiques shop. Have lived there since beginning of the game. I also have a unique camp build that allows me to play it pretty much anywhere .
---
Hmm I have an industrial purifier I can’t scrap too but yet I’ve still been able to build two buildings, one two story, and fill it them with all kinds of furniture, turrets, another purifier, generator, workbenches, decorations. Doesn’t seem to be taking up 75% of my budget. 
---
Ps4?
---
Please delete your account 
---
Right, as I said it isn't the items that I'm talking about.  
---
Anyways, as I also said, I'm glad I got in on day one and could play the early game that I was looking for.  I guess most players around here were looking for something different.
---
Well it was at least worth a cursory google search before you decide that something is a verifiable break in lore. The explanation is that West-Tek had a research center in Appalachia and was experimenting with another permutation of FEV on the residents of Huntersville. You raise a good point that Appalachian super mutants are identical to Institute mutants. It was never explained in Fo4 where the Institute got its hands on FEV, and it's feasible that an Institute scout retrieved some from Appalachia, since the West-Tek facility was *much* less dangerous than the more proximal Vault 87 in DC.
---
Of course, this isn't detailed in text of the game, so the practical reason for the shared models is probably that it was yet another recycled asset. And yes, there are a number of verifiable, small retcons that occurred in this game in the interest of recycling assets. But these retcons only pertain to new additions to the series made in Fallout 4. The cryolator is a perfect example of this. I resent these and find them immersion-breaking. But new assets take a lot of time to make, and these out-of-place assets are consequences of a rushed game. As it's been discussed exhaustively on this sub, the rushed nature of Fo76 wasn't the fault of BGS. Personally, I think that the writing and storytelling was better and that the handling of the series core lore points was more careful than what we saw in Fo4.
---
I have my CAMP set up at the stream by Top of the World, a little bit away from the train station there. Its pretty trash however, because I always get stray ferals or super mutants running around it and I’d have to constantly defend it for it to stay standing. I know theres a mountain nearby with water on the top, the problem is it’s slightly irradiated and has a snallygaster around there every now and then. If anyone finds that spot, then can you tell me the directions? I found it once with someones camp already there and I wanna set mine up there.

4) *TL;DR: Multiple extractors break each other.* Multiples of the same extractor (and multiple water purifiers) seem to slow down the rate of production. I just took Hemlock Holes and placed &amp; powered all three acid extractors and so far only one has generated any acid; I've been watching them for 15+ minutes.
---
4B) *TL;DR: Above but water purifiers, and less extensive.* A similar thing happens when I try to place two industrial water purifiers at my camp (I like to keep one locked for me and one open for whoever wanders by), where they fill sporadically and much more slowly than one individual purifier does.
---
4C) *TL;DR: Harvesting with a gun out steals ammo.* Unrelated, but I frequently lose a couple rounds of ammo for whatever gun I have out when harvesting things (wood, plants, metal nodes, etc). It also happens much more rarely when looting open world objects (the biocard in the silos is the only open world object I know for a fact it's happened to me with.

" Keyboard and mouse support for consoles" ayy lmao. Can't wait for one very big faction to control all of the servers and zerg all of the workshops without any real competition. 
---
Lose your virginity
---
Lol mine are three and five. So basically glued to my butt 24/7 🤦🏽‍♀️
---
Yeah that would be legit, I’m thinking raiders when they open up the vaults. 
---
this is how you get laid
---
Unless "coming close to Whitesprings" includes being in the Forest, Mire, Top of the World, and other locations that seem overly far away for a spawn thats a negative.
---
Again, no one was there, and I was solo. No one was quit rejoining around there. It took getting on at a pretty obnoxiously early hour to actually get a emptyish lobby with only 9 people in it to do that quest without people either nuking the place or wandering in and spawning everything but the golfers.
---
Either stuff is spawning 3-5x as fast as near anywhere else, not realizing the original spawn is still there (most other sites that will spawn on top of you seem to require around half a prior spawn to get cleared first). Or there's a drastic overabundance of spawn triggers there to the same effect thats the only location in the game with an infinite enemy trigger (other then maybe fissues)
---
Of those, the first two would in fact be buggy behaviour. The third would be unforeseen results but working as intended, but still be a drastic abnormality to the design of every other zone in the game.
---
That the robots can just keep piling up for no apparent reason right outside the front door of the shopping centre, would seem to imply that something in that particular zone is definitely out of whack. 
---
No prob

yes i believe everything about this post

Apparently some dupers are pissed because I'm calling them out over it because every comment is being downvoted.

I never use chems, doubly so in 76. When my character gets dehydrated every twelve seconds I don’t have time to use anything that dehydrates me faster. Lol
---
I dislike when people can't be supportive, or help out others; even if its just a video game.  It sounds like [traditional] RPGs would be more your speed, but don't give up!
---
It's funny because the pattern is the same in every multiplayer game where there are exploits.
---
1) Game launches
---
2) Exploits are found
---
3) Some exploits are patched while others prove more difficult
---
4) Game devs figure out how to track the exploits and do so silently, gathering details to come up when the a better fix, meanwhile people say they can't and won't fix the exploits
---
5) Game devs find a full fix fir the exploit and patch it, people say that the damage is already done and it's too late
---
6) Game devs monitor for further exploit-type behavior to confirm fully fixed likely specifically monitoring people they have identified as using exploits previously
---
7) Banhammer and ban waves where appropriate
---
Every time.

I would straight MURDER for a girl that actively enjoys video games and enjoys playing them with ME.
---
The issue is, I live in Texas, in particular, at Texas A&amp;M, and, it is populated by only country girls, or girls who are only interested in me because I am free IT.
---
It makes me sad more girls don't sit down a good game or two.
---
Man every player I come across is a wave and sometimes goodies dropped. I have my camp easy to find and have visitors often to my workbenches never had a problem. Never been in pvp that was unwanted. You just have broke a mirror or some shit 😂 
---
Yea either across the back double door or beside the pond
---
I was here since day 1 too. It was people helping each other right out of the gate. Whether it was bug related, quest related, or how to turn off area chat. We eventually figured it out together. 
---
r/fo76photos needs more love.
---
I saw someone used a single fountain to place a bridge to a floating platform over the water. Railed stairs up to a single 1x3 platform and back down to the actual base over the water. 
---
I've heard you can have multiple. For the deathclaw, I need both animal friend and wasteland wanderer (maxed), and it needs to be a random encounter.
---
Aww damn. I play on PC atm, but I am about to grab a copy for PS4 soon I think. The people I was playing with on PC bailed to other games and I have a few playing on PS4 that I might join. Shoot me your PSN name and I"ll add ya! 
---
Isn’t it always in hardcore mode? Only asking because I realized ammo has a weight and you need to eat and drink, which I’ve noticed are in hardcore mode on other fallout games.
---
So was your momma sister daughter and wife when I banged them all in a imax 3d

If u have all your health i guess its a visual

&gt;  Just before I respawned, another team member killed it. By the time I got there, the body was completely non-existent for me only. The other team members could both see and loot it.
---
This happened to one of the two guys that helped me kill the Queen for the first time this morning. Felt bad. :/
---
smack things with it
---
I don’t have my PC but if you want, add me. Im Sarcasticearlobes.
---
I have seen odd behaviour in the laundry room odd lag spikes and FPS drops. The robots are supposed to spawn like mad, the ghouls not so much. 
---
All I know is I spend hours at the 6th hole in whitesprings which is right next to the club the only time the ghouls respawn is when someone new fast travels to me or zones in near it. I have sat there for over an hour and not had them respawn, but the moment a buyer fast travels in boom the broken ass T-pose charred ghoul is visible on the back side
---
oh wow I didn't realize 
---
Honestly, it's so bad now that I am reluctant to call myself a "gamer" because of the association. I've been playing games for over 30 years, but it's just a hobby, not part of my self identity. Something I do for fun. The current gaming culture has grown well beyond ridiculous, with all the antagonism and entitlement and gatekeeping. This is honestly the first time I've ever been embarrassed to call myself a gamer.
---
Understandable. But best to keep this to yourself. People aren’t nice 
---
The think a lot of them will be used for future content and add-ons.
---
I read this as having Nick Valentines voice
---
Honestly, so  .38, .44 and 10mm rounds I get from scorched. Another way of getting .308 is super mutants at summersville. 5.56 rounds I get from high level scorched and mutants. 
---
Are u enjoying the games? Then u don't suck at them.
---
Easiest way is to do “Mayor for a Day” in Watoga. Makes all the bots nonhostile, but they won’t attack you for attacking other bots there. Assaultrons spawn all along the southern walkway. 
---
&lt;scratches head&gt;  Do you have a concussion by chance?  Anyways, family first always 🤙❤️
---
You  should consider joining a faction! It's a great way to find people to  team  up with, and it creates a great sense of community! If you're   interested, here's a 170+ member BoS group: [https://discord.gg/PnEgyW7](https://discord.gg/PnEgyW7) 
---
We do wasteland patrols, roleplay, nukes, talk about Fallout lore,  trade with each other, help each other gear up and level etc. You'd all  be very welcome!
---
That's also assuming the contract allowed that.  Honestly without being able to see the actual agreement it's hard to say what Bethesda's level of involvement was, I'm just tired of everyone acting like it's all Bethesda's fault and ignoring the actual company producing the product's existence
---
Mods of any type are not allowed in game.
---
Watoga train station is the most reliable. Other vendors have a chance for it (check the shop also near there just in case he gets one) otherwise just hop the station.   
---
I would sell you one but I had to remake a whole new T-60 so I am down to those on me. 
---
My wife and I will send you tickets when we bang your whole family next time
---
What's so popular about Whitesprings?
---
I just equip lead belly and drink from the sewage.
---
This thread shows what I’ve been saying for a long time. Games are for any ages! I grew up with Atari and I’ll be playing whatever comes along, and hope I am playing still when I’m 70!
---
As far as Whitespring, yes I have a TSE that I did earn, I only use when I’m solo, if I’m in Whitespring during a nuke it’s all Melee, so everyone can enjoy the ghouls! 
---
For the imax showing I mean 
---
i lolled

occlusion is a technology that has escaped Bethesda at all levels, both visual and audible

I gotta do it too, and I dont have my PC with me for a lil bit. My GT is sarcasticearlobes.
---
No, I'm salty.  Maybe a little dramatic, but mostly salt.
---
Dude here. I play the same way. I am absolute shit at PvP and I don’t really like talking to people I don’t know. But I fucking love fallout, so I tend to keep to myself and scavenge. I approach enemies and locations carefully. And I very much enjoy this gaming experience.
---
Can i join the Nuke?
---
Well that blows. I've only once ever gone up against her and actually landed some sweet damage. But that was a while. I haven't gone up against her since. That was some awesome fun though. I went there with my brother. I loved all the crazy scorched versions of other creatures like deathclaws and fog crawlers as well
---
Only a girl would feel the need to post this garbage and only the white knights on this shitty website would upvote this to feel good about themselves.

Farming legendaries

Man, makes me want to find a Camouflaged Deathclaw, but I've only ever seen one since playing (Lv.193)
---
I wish I could just blueprint my whole Camp so I could try out different camp designs.
---
If you’re XB1 I’ve got like 2400 5mm
---
Ah yes! I almost set mine there. It's, I think, DIRECTLY south of Top of the World. IT's BEAUTIFUL. And you can set your camp just outside of the homestead to catch the water on the pond. 
---
IF you loot whatever is in the meat pile it disappears :)
---
Hey congrats! Those 'boys' were wrong and dont deserve you anyway ;) We girls got nothing to prove when it comes to gaming, just to ourselves. Keep doing you! ❤
---
Sad Vault Boy means an addiction. Doesn't show up in the effects screen.
---
You don’t need to worry about any elitism from me. I like that subreddit, too. 
---
I asked for more context because my experience is the opposite in terms of feeling like this is one of the most stealth approachable fallouts in my opinion (barring spawning hiccups and bugs, and certain cumbersome locations). Even with full power armor I find myself being able to slink around pretty well and not get revealed until I’m ready or take the vast majority of a group out before I need to move in and encounter what’s still in the nooks and crannies.
---
I would say unless it’s really giving you a heart attack, keep at it. There’s plenty of perks in agility to make your life easier in this regard, as well as the fact that the agility stat directly increases your ability to sneak effectively as well. The sneak perk increases it further by a percentage (up to 75%) and Escape artist removes the penalty for running (this is confusing, because they mean the default move speed that you need to toggle off to walk when they say run, they don’t mean sprint) in stealth and gives you the ability to drop out of combat by effectively sneaking.  This latter card only takes up one point and enables you to cause enemies to lose aggrieved via stealth. I only have 5 points in agi and I wear power armor and escape artist and that tends to be enough for my stealth needs, so I can only imagine how effective you could be if you were using armor pieces to generate a stealth field or additional stealth bonuses and had higher agility and all the stealth related perks (and a lack of noisy power armor) you would be.
---
There seems to be a lot more options and stealth seems a lot less cumbersome  that it was in some of the older games.
---
If part of the fear is being harmed as well, power armor torsos can have a stealth boy mod installed, and there’s a healing factor mutation that makes you heal rapidly out of combat, which pairs well with stealth for obvious reasons.
---
I realize this is a wall of text already, but for context, the stealth perk opens up at level 20 and escape artist at 35, so no matter what it will take some patience and a few deep breaths to get to that point. But practice and your actual character getting better will make it easier if you don’t feel uncomfortable sticking with it.
---
You can shoot me a message if you have any questions or if you are on pc I may even be able to help.

I hate rats!

I don't remember where this was, however.  I took this screenshot a while ago.

I just remember it being on a roof.  :/

Did you use any serums?  The one i used seemed to eliminate any new chance until the protective effect wore off.
---
Are the Cheat Engine users still salty about getting banned?
---
ohh. I see. I might try that. I desperately need to level up.
---
I believe they're postponing the remaining 200 stash they mentioned  for CAMP Vendor bots, since these bots are going to function as another stash holder.

literally all the foundation i have made is displaying the message and its all concrete that took me ages to get &gt;\_&lt;

Oh I get it.  &lt;I don’t get it... no one gets it&gt;

whatever, keep spreading your misinformation
---
That’s not bad but by no means does that make you good at the game, your good at the game when you beat the queen 
---
If this is such a shitty website, then why are you on it? Your opinion is your opinion, but doesn't mean it's true :)

There's a teddy bear cooking a human arm in a porta-potty in the Glassed Cavern.

Huh
---
They all got it bud. Big time 
---
A word of advice from one gamer girl to another - your significant other should NEVER treat you like that, regardless of your level of expertise or gaming style. 
---
I am on the other side of this scenario, I’m a hardcore gamer, been playing since I was a child with NES, and my SO is absolutely horrible at games with the exception of sports games. Whenever he plays my games, he spends all my virtual money and uses all my supplies and internally I flip the fuck out. He spends all my money in GTA on cars just to wreck them, ITS AWFUL. 
---
But on the surface, I’m completely supportive, I try to explain different strategies with games and the controls. I never discourage him with any of the games he wants to play. 
---
Good for you for standing up for yourself and an even bigger congrats on accomplishing something awesome like this. 
---
You probably just talked me into putting my luck down to 10 Thanks. 
---
I'm trying to collect them but I scrap them everytime I scrap all :/
---
Lol I don’t blame you there!  First time I did it, definitely needed them!  However, I work tomorrow so sadly I will probably not be in at 1 am lol
---
Found one last night on the roof of watoga medical center , by the power armor that spawn there.
---
It's really not hard when they have access to the back end data. This behavior is likely already being tracked and once the fix is out, I predict a ban-wave.
---
Sometimes you keep the exploiters around to help confirm your fix works.
---
The fact you've had 2 ex boyfriends since FO 76 came out says you might want to spend less time in videogames and focus on the relationships a bit more. Or more time in videogames and no relationships, always an option too.
---
The players arm clips through any skirt/dress while sitting as well. Ruins a lot of good photo opportunities.
---
Will do, im trying to make a start on it but not sure if i should take the approach of a story teller or the approach of acting it out lol. What do you think?
---
Also is it just me or do the gnomes kinda whether or woohoo when you grab them
---
I play exactly the same way as you and guess what? Its just the way I enjoy games the most! Congrats on your victory over the scorchbeast (still haven't fought one myself) and just keep doing what you like, the way you like! :)
---
I think you wrote this down in a good comprehensible way and as a plus I agree with most of your points.
---
For me at times the game gets a bit depressing. Sometimes during the quests I'm really rooting for dinner people but I already know everybody is dead... At times that makes me sad and I also miss the of goofball NPC now and then. There are a few in this game that are fun but they are far and wide.
---
Didn’t know that, hopefully soon then. 
---
I've been reluctant to share my secret, mostly because I can't actually prove that it works, but here it goes: The amount your base gets attacked is directly proportional to the amount of defenses you have. If you have no turrets or "defense" items you will only get attacked by low level dogs and rats every now and again. Fill your base up with turrets and you'll get hit by super mutants and scorchbeasts. In my (admittedly small sample size) this 100% how the game works and the best defense is no defense at all.
---
I CANT WAIT for this
---
I would like to take part! :)
---
Happened to me in fortnite. Started playing it to understand what my 15 yo was talking about. Some tween took my loot box thing and I said you lil bastard. An hour later I couldn't talk anymore. Lol virgin ears i suppose. 
---
I am, that'd be amazing. Gamertag is LifeInFramePHL. Will be online in a little while.
---
Of you're going to ever go into a blast zone, the more rad resistance you can get, the better. 
---
You sure owned me here son. I mean if anyone reads through this exchange, they’ll surely agree that you have an uncanny wit.   Bravo.  🤯🤯🤯
---
There are definitely a lot of cool people out there who would help you if you had any questions or wanted a group to play with. And not just because you are a girl, but because most of the people who still play just want to have a good time. And in my opinion there really is no such thing as a shitty gamer. People have different ways of doing things, whether they be the right way or not it is always their way of doing it.
---
I'd love to join
---
Happened to me, granted before last patch, but yeah I scrapped everything, moved and rebuilt and didn’t have any issues. I also had hundreds of tatoes and mutfruits.

Please send me your social security number and address.

I won’t be home for at least 8 hours so may have to be tomorrow

I found this one also. It's either Torrance house, Hornwight summer manor, or riverside manor. They are all next to eat other. Also there is a hedge maze behind one of these locations with an Easter egg referring to Steven Kings The Shinning.

What platform is this on? I've not seen this at all on PC, personally.

Poor fella didn't know he was starring in the sequel to The Hurt Locker.

Based on the luck bobbleheads, he probobly duped like 13 times
---
Hey we have a group you would fit well in to play! Are u on Xbox?
---
I would eat shit at level 34 when attacked solo by scorched beasts, so good job.
---
The gnomes do giggle and the teddy bears squeak
---
Good advice.  Thanks. 
---
Ok. I’m bored.  Good luck in your travels son.   I fear you’ll need a fair bit of it.  
---
Fair enough, that's legitimately creepy. I still need to grab this mask.
---
You do know you must inspect the weapon to see all legendary affixes?
---
I feel like wind instruments will probably be expanded upon. I mean, it is plural.
---
No worries, will be around tomorrow too. Thanks!
---
I saw this one before I started taking photos. I'll have to go back and get that one. 
---
Ok cause I thought I was losing it haha
---
I usually let my shrimp defrost in a sink of hot water. I know you're not supposed to, but I do it anyway.
---
at that point they're not gonna be able to fast travel or move very fast so i would probably widdle them down try to kill them become wanted steal all the junk they drop server hop and let a random person use me as a pinata 
---
He rued the day he mined himself.

Saw one the other day that was cooking another teddy bear in a stew pot.
---
The only thing I need is your social security number. Dm me 
---
The initialization "CMF" makes me think of porn. Idk, maybe it is just me; same thing happens when the BBC comes on the radio.
---
I never AFK with junk on me. I haven’t had an issue with people killing me while AFK but better safe than sorry.
---
I usually store junk when I have too much, after exploring a place or if I’m going to a highly populated player area.
---
I do sell bulk junk frequently and I try to sell that ASAP at the vendor just in case. One time at Harper’s Ferry, I was on my vendor route and there were two high levels there. I tried to sell my stuff, junk being first, and they lured a shit ton of charred ferals to me. They did destroy me but were disappointed when no junk dropped from me.
---
Yeah I would like to put all the variants on a shelf or in a toy chest where they are visible as decoration. Hopefully we get the ability to decorate with Junk again.
---
Yeah that's not competitiveness, that's projecting insecurities onto your partner. It's emotional abuse at a certain point, and part of the reason that gamer culture has a reputation for toxicity is that not enough people are self-aware enough to check themselves when they're being abusive.
---
Just be a bounty hunter I got a a explosive combat shotgun last night I’m not gonna use till I see people with bounties on their heads 
---
Nope, my first ex I was with for 3 years and ended it with him 2 years ago. The other ex I was with for 6 months. Surprise!
---
Gaming morals (is there such a thing) aside, a lot of self entitlement in your post
---
People using the game mechanics to play the way they want, that happens to be NOT the way you want = bullies
---
Ok.
---
CMNF? &gt;&gt;; No idea what you mean...
---
A proper significant other lifts their partner, does not put them down. 
---
Good job on your decision to DTMFA.
---
I don't have a girlfriend now but I have a female roommate. She was always self conscious when I'd watch her play Zelda (she's a sneaker like you) because, well, she's not great at combat. I don't know where she got that anxiety from but it wasn't me. I told her often that it doesn't matter, games are supposed to be fun, let's have fun. 
---
And it wasn't because she's female. Before Zelda, she had never played a game that needed a two stick gamepad. Huge learning hill to climb.  Anyone would have been bad.
---
Of course she got better and was whooping on bokoblins without fear after a few months. 
---
How much do you hate life to see people helping people and go “you should let them suffer like the rest of us, how dare you help them!”  If you don’t want to help, don’t help. If you don’t want free stuff, don’t take it. See how easy that was? 
---
I used to use a ton of chems in fo4. Then I decided I liked Danse, and I stopped using them because *I didn't want to disappoint him.*
---
I like the game much better now. Danse was my sponsor to gaming sobriety I guess.
---
ill be waiting at vault 76
---
That’s fucking awful people can be like that. Hope you find your gamer partner so y’all can coop some good games. #gamersareoppressed I can’t even do this ironically. Kms
---
I used to feel like there were too many enemies, but now I'm level 50 with 3 powerful legendary weapons and, so now I just steamroll motherfuckers in a tide of glorious battle in my never ending quest to for lead, plastic, screws and springs.
---
You are correct. He did have me go to him, whereas other trades, I've had people come to me. 
---
Yeah with the holidays over I'd expect progress. I track similar things in enterprise software and it takes a bit of time for the trickier ones but at the end of the day it is just a matter of identifying the behaviors and then an easy script can identify the abusers for you.
---
I thoroughly enjoyed your wall of text and it's given me renewed hope to shoot for level 20 to start with. I'm on xbox but I appreciate that there may be some light at the end of the tunnel if, like you say, I can get there without having a damn heart attack! I've set myself a couple of small goals to tackle next, finding the plans for a musical instrument and finding a radiation suit. I can't wait to get some sneak specific perks. 
---
Or “Tamed Deathclaw”
---
Too bad you’re playing Fallout 76
---
I appreciate that, I hastily wrote from my phone this morning. 
---
If my group can kill all the competition before the ghouls despair it kind of becomes our golf course.  Raiders are gonna raid.  Look what the raiders did to Charleston, a little Whitespring murder enforcement should be expected.  Wait until we leave.
---
Don’t forget Super Duper - you can get 8 diluted from 1 full approximately every third time. 
---
Yep, it would be funny if the dwellers of the new vault are agressive.
---
I have Level 1 Lead Belly activated, I'll just level that up so I don't have to consume any found water.
---
The water purifier that sticks in the ground and doesn’t require a water source is located at Smith Farm. It’s south of Clarksburg (Far north middle of map). When u get there it’s sitting on the cooking station inside of the outbuilding. Sorry if this is a repeat answer. 
---
To heck with them. I’ve played a similar style my whole life. I’ve developed a deep and abiding love for Fallout and Elder Scrolls because I’ve crawled all over their world, gotten to know the people, love the story telling and...well...just enjoy the immersion. I was stunned three days after FO76 released when people were talking about having “finished”. That’s their style, great.  Not mine. My youngest son gives me crap all the time for reading every note, sign and dialog box; also for having subtitles turned on.  I told him I buy a $70 game to get more than 3-4 days of play. 
---
Congrats on the scorchbeast kill. And you keep being you. 
---
I figured out they will always spawn at your back. I found a staircase it couldn't climb. I would go down the stairs, turn around, go back up the stairs, aim at the base of the stairs, and when the radscorpion glitched there, shoot in that general area -- sometimes the radscorpion just flickers, sometimes the burrow dirt appears in midair, sometimes it doesn't appear at all.
---
Glitchy as hell, but I was stuck there until it was dead because it was 10 levels higher than me. Took some 20 minutes to kill. GREAT GAME
---
Oh it sounded sadder than this.
---
The camp improvements have made a drastic improvement, I have yet to lose or rebuild my camp. I have two camps, two xboxes. I have one at the junk deposit near morgan town or by the junk yard workshop which is close by, I like it has it is nice and central. I am encumbered, so having two places helps me a lot. I don't worry about water as I just up six water pumps at each of my camps. I farm water and junk.
---
My 2nd one is just above huntington I think on the east side of the map hidden in a forest, not pretty but it does have a few off a cliff view and a lead deposit. Also there is a death claw close by, plus a lodge which has honeybees, bears and a stash plus another area which gets sloths, tankbots etc, which I can actually snipe from my house, so it is cool in a way. Also huntington is filled with Supermutants, plus has a PA spawn. Also here is a house with a log at the back, which you have to climb up to grab keys for Sugargrove, so for those that don't know, get those keys next time you there, it unlocks a stash at sugar grove and I think is needed for another quest.
---
There’s also that one that stops disease while drinking. I just put both of them on before I drink from the lake.
---
If you turn your back in the waste land......your gonna have a bad time. 
---
Can do that on any platform. Doesn't help when the whole server crashes because it can't handle the many players at the same place.
---
My only issue with it is the Scorched spawning literally inside it. They kill it way faster than the SB, and if you keep the SB attention, the turrets will survive fine. But 5 spawning inside it will almost always destroy it before you can kill them.
---
I play the same way you do. You are NOT rubbish at gaming just because of your playstyle.
---
Play the way that makes you happy, that's all that matters!
---
I've been playing fallout since fallout 3. And I don't ever use chems and sneak is plenty viable. I think your ex might have a case of stupid. Chems are good option but nothing in this game makes you min max at all.
---
What is your character going to be wearing, id love to help with this build. Also are you going to be doing bloodied because if not you can free up a lot of perk points 
---
Have any questions? 
---
They would probably be even more upset if they met my ex who went from never playing video games to having top us guilds trying to recruit her constantly. Most people on our server considered me to be very good and would spend hours discussing mechanics, but she ended up so, so beyond my skill qnd knowledge level. In one of our progression videos she literally saved everything and you can hear me faintly in the background say, "holy shit, you're so fucking good."
---
I know it’s not enough for a blast zone but what about diseased enemies 
---
Yeah what is it , how do I join , and what does the organization do
---
Nope. Gotta buy the plans. For instance if you buy the "treated" plan, the next day you can get the "lined" plan, and then the next day you can buy the "shielded" plan.
---
Currently working on mine for the Marine Wetsuit since my Enclave under armor apparently disappeared.
---
And he’s gone. 
---
I am surprised no one was shit canned for this game
---
It is Bethesda's fault though, and i guarantee you they would not allow sign off on it without final approval, companies are very very protective with there names, IP's and what not. They wouldn't just agree to let them make the bottles and not have any feed back.
---
This whole mess its Bethesda's fault as its there product, i guess people would have been a little more understanding and patient with them but they launched the game to early then treat there customers like there the problem, how ever you want to spin it or look at it that's all Bethesda.
---
The continuing silence and lack of quick fixes though is whats making worse.
---
Ok, I haven't checked yet. Makes sense though because 119 seems high for having no associated perks. 
---
Doesn’t hardened mass store in the aid section? 
---
Yeah, I have a quad pump shotgun and it takes forever to reload 32 shells.  I don't want more ammo capacity than that.
---
Go to the big bridge near Flatwood, on top near a radioactive barrel pile are 5 bags of concrete. 
---
&gt; Teamed up with a random ...
---
and you've solved the problem.
---
There’s so much detail in the game and I like the story. I couldn’t imagine rushing through the game. I bought it around Christmas and started playing it a couple weeks ago. 
---
Sounds like your ex’s were a bunch of losers. I would be happy if my gf would even play with me no matter here skill level so props to you! 
---
I read 'team up with people' and made a face. 😨
---
I miss out on so much fun by being so damn wound up all the time. This has got me thinking I should give it another go though this weekend. 
---
Fuckin' rights!
---
You probobly wouldnt kill them cuz they would never pvp with you, they are probobly carrying thousonds of stimpaks, so you would never kill them, they also have the option to back out of the server if something is going to attack them so it is unlikely that you would get them to die, only real option is to pop a stealth boy and attempt to steal their stuff when you see them duping
---
so what? i killed my first scorchbeast solo with level 24
---
Not Sebastian!?!
---
Do you know where to buy vaultsuit underarmor plans?
---
It would be nice so I don't have to waste ammo to make sure a building is cleared.  After I kill everything I can find, I usually pop a shot or two and see if the hidden meter changes.
---
Only if the game allowed me to place more than 20% of my budget
---
That must have been a hoot.
---
"Quit playing like I don't like to play." Fuck em. You done good vault dweller. 
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Also if your not supposed to you probably shouldn’t 
---
Lesson is: whether it's a family member or friend, be kind.  Discouragement and failure are cyclical. Be positive, be encouraging, lift that person. They'll do the same for you. That's how you make strong relationships. 
---
Whether it's a girlfriend that's bad at video games, or a boyfriend that's bad in the kitchen, or a child that's struggling in school, or a grandparent that doesn't understand smart phones. Be kind and supportive.
---
they come as a reward from the main storyline quest, for other under armour linings check vendors 
---
I got lucky and got a quad combat shotgun.

I was just impressed the other day, when I was looking at my Pip-Boy. I was in the forest and the sun was shining through the trees, and you could see the smalls shadows that the branches and leaves left on my Pip-Boy, with the bright sun making it harder to read the scree, just as it would  in real life.
---
That certainly got my attention.
---
but i fucking hate sloths. they are an evolutionary failure that should have died out a long time ago
---
I have one that lets me fast travel anyone mid to south east cheap, with a lead resources for easy ammo (way better than mut factory and no worries about taking it or dcs).
---
Responders vendors sell them.
---
Great tip thanks!!
---
Girl, this is honestly the best playstyle for a Fallout game. It’s meant for exploration and not fast-paced combat. I was that way in Skyrim as well. My ex bf was always rushing into stuff and getting killed and raging out over nothing in almost every game he played. Meanwhile, there I was, genuinely having a good time just relaxing and playing the way I wanna play. Gaming is a leisure activity, and guys like that take it way too seriously. I’m glad you dropped them because honestly, it’s childish of them to criticize you for doing things your way. 
---
You sound like youre whining in this post. Just repair your base gawd DRAMA
---
They sound like plebs trying to rip on your combat gaming based off a game like f.o. You do you gurl you dont need trash gamers in your life and they sound like trash.
---
You killed a scorched beast while at level 40? You're not shit lol I avoided them completely and didn't try until much, much later.
---
im just here to inform everyone that there are no girls on the internet
---
Being a good gamer should only mean you know how to enjoy yourself playing a game.  Unless you are getting paid 35K/yr+ min to play games then there is no skill level, the leaderboards at that level are entirely pointless.
---
The dude who laughs their ass off and enjoys every moment of an hour of gameplay while making little to no "progress" is by far the better gamer IMO than the one who can blast through the entire game in an hour taking no damage but barely manages to smile even once or show a shred of emotion.
---
Just saying, enjoy the games and you are as real a gamer as anyone.  :)
---
It’s not garbage if you played 250 hours for a dumb digital outfit
---
I've seen the plans in Watoga at both the train station as well as the BoS vendor.
---
Ah of one my ex was like that too. One time he decided to made me play to tekken, thinking he would humiliate me. I wrecked him. He never said anything after that except "no I won't play with you" he was an ass, a big ugly one. Don't listen to anybody when it comes to your play style. You play to whatever you want however you want. My bf right now doesn't play like me at all and misses a lot of things so I show him, I teach him how to play this game the better way possible, but I never say anything when it comes to fights because he knows what he likes and how he likes to do it (ok he often says I don't fight the right way but meh, don't care, I played so many games he never touched, I'm ok to learn some things but I know how to win if I try hard enough.)
---
Anyway, a good fallout is always a good cure for a broken heart. It always worked for me anyway. You go girl 💪
---
That sounds so nice! What weapon is your favorite? I'm still using level 10 🌟 pistol and a crafted rifle and crafted shotgun. 
---
Take multiple radx or radx diluted at once for more resist. It stacks.
---
 Often they will show 0 caps. Try selling them something anyway and they will show what they really have.
---
When this happened to me I was building on to an existing structure ended up saying f it and re placing my camp
---
Can confirm this as well
---
I've literally never seen that screen where you select a stat. I've closed the stat window and tried opening the pip boy multiple times to select a stat. Hoping that it might somehow just work this time even though it didn't the last time, and the only way I've seen is to select a perk card. I've not once seen a stat select option.
---
Is that why the scorchbeast around abandoned bog town is white? I just assumed it was bugged. 😂 My bad to those pet owners.

The Enclave is what remains of the pre-war American Government and Military.

Just south of the radar array is a junk mode next to a camp site and small cliff edge.
---
My main has been setup there since close to launch.
---
I'm always shocked at how few times I've had to move and then later relog.
---
Its basically in the middle of all the end game spots with a junk node and i only got attacked by a lone scorched that shot from the array itself.
---
I thought you could only take one med at a time and do any of them allow you to keep your mutations

You cannot learn the plans twice. You're supposed to have the ability to paint any T-51b pieces with the Nuka Cola paint. If you can't then either it's not a T-51b piece, or you have some sort of odd glitch. But fret not, somebody else can paint the piece for you and drop it for you.

Playing on Xbox One X. 
---
Last few days have experienced at least one crash/server disconnect per play. 
---
Getting to the point where I don’t want to jump into any events because I know it’ll crash/disconnect.
---
check challenges and then go to character and the first challenge will show you
---
I get what you're saying in the first point. The SBQ was just an extreme example because it is literally the single toughest enemy within the game. The SBQ is meant to be a raid-like boss, which is why it isn't designed with solo-play in mind. The suggestion for 8+ people is from Bethesda for facing the SBQ, that's what it tells you in-game, hence my use of the word "intended." Like I said though you can play through everything else by yourself with no legendaries and never run into a situation you can't handle. 
---
I also play solo like 95% of the time. 
---
As for your second point, I mean if that's how you feel that's your opinion, not much I can say about that. 
---
Fallout has always had a perk system though. That hasn't changed since game one, so it's not a surprise to see it implemented in this game as well. Sorry you feel that way about the perk system. At least the existence of TSE weapons gives you the option to play in a way that satisfies you. 
---
Fully agree would be supper cool
---
I dont know. Slapping your genitals on the controller and screaming like a banshee seems like a wrong way to play a game
---
Depends how much of the important junk I have.
---
Sometimes I hit the jackpot and find a lot of screws, gears, Springs, ballistic fibre etc.
---
Then I get my ass to stash. Never know when the Fallout gods will strike.
---
But If I’m collecting steel, wood, lead just to top myself up I’m not too worried. They’re pretty easy to farm in large amount pretty quick.
---
I have a level 40 furious combat shotgun, a level 40 perfect storm, and a level 50 combat rifle with the explosive and troubleshooter effects. Which I prefer is really situational, but I tend to save those for special occasions and use a pump action shotgun the most.
---
If you're on PC I can craft 10mm SMGs, combat rifles, leather armor, metal armor, combat armor legs, and .50 cal machineguns if you need help.
---
Golly! I just checked and yeah, im fucking stupid, its a T45 leg not a 51b.....mi an idiot, welp time to go and find one leg then, Thanks a lot good sir\~
---
You could say the same about any number of glitches and exploits in any number of games. Sometimes there is no easy fix. Sometimes it's just a cat and mouse game that never ends. As one thing is fixed another thing is broken. As one thing is patched another pops up. There are sometimes limitations in the code that is so deeply embedded in the engine required to function that it would be practically impossible. I have no idea about any of that stuff, but if it's not fixed then there must be a reason for it. There are still some bugs, glitches and exploits in some online games from launch that have been out for 10+ years. World of Warcraft had level 1 Orcs falling from the sky and spelling out the name of a gold selling website with their corpses. That happened for a long time and I don't even know if they ever fixed it.
---
It can only be applied to T-51b parts. Make sure your right leg is a T-51b. If your right leg is T-51b and your cannot apply the main, the oart is bugged, try getting another T-51b right leg and try that one. Also, some users have reported somehow "forgetting" learned plans for some things (mostly CAMP) items. Make sure you can still apply the Nuka Cola paint to other T-51b parts to make sure you still have that ability.
---
But it FEELS SO RIGHT
---
this happened to me today as well, they are supposed to be full of stuff
---
I tried to join the discord channel but it says the invite expired. Would love to join if possible

As a guy who is basically the opposite of that play stile (rushes through everything, underleveled, relying on my aim) I still can't play with ppl sometimes too.
---
t-60 plans drop from the event distant thunder
---
I did the main quests in the morgantown airport area, and decided to move on.  Is 10-30 more about grinding to level up instead of just following the story quest?  I'm not sure where I have to go after "An ounce of prevention", but I wish the game would tell you recommended levels for the quests
---
The first time I went north towards Grafton, I got ambushed by a bunch of lvl 5 Super Mutants, and then almost immediately ran into some lvl 25 enemies so I ran back south instead :D
---
That guys a tool.
---
Right? Mistresses of Mystery Unite! I sneak everywhere... even at my own camp, if the turrets start popping. 
---
i thought it was called overencumbered...... But i keep hearing people say "oh no im encumbered" did they change the message promt or are people just reading wrong?
---
That is just disgusting
---
I suggest waiting at their camp until the person shows up, and record a vid to send to bethesda. Obviously it might be just some random person coming to investigate, but it should be fairly obvious what the owner looks like, especially if they try to do any repairs or build more stuff (if whatever budget exploit they are using even allows it)
---
Odd. Seemed to work easier. 
---

And i play the sane way sell all my chems i travel abd do side quest just ignore those as long as your having fun i see no problem.
---
So guys any other opinion about gauss rifle? We two discording opinion here above 
---
I've found the missile turrets are reasonably good as long as you set them up high and give them a wide open space around the camp to see things.  They have extremely long range too, enough that they can kill most things at longer range than the enemy can fire back.  Also unlike the turrets, the missiles can kill high level enemies quickly and have splash damage so they can take out swarms.
---
I have four in the corners of my base and have no issues with anything approaching other than Scorchbeasts.
---
If you mean armor, I'm undecided at the moment. Probably combat or marine.
---
I'm not sure what I'll be doing with legendary perks and stuff yet. For now I'm just trying to figure out my build

This is actually a holdover from the server bug that was duplicating your camp items.  I logged in one day to find &gt;500 corn in my storage.  \*sigh\*
---
No problem, dude. It took me 5 hours to track down my level 50 T-51b set just to put the Nuka paint on. You'll feel great once you've got it completed. Good luck to you, sir!
---
Man. How can I compete against these kind of vendors? Go organic?
---
I see it happen sometimes as well.  Especially sucks since i got marsupial in order to hit the top container.
---
That guy sounds like a complete jerk. I'm around the same level and also play like you &lt;3 the game seems really oriented toward melee rush style play and that's just not me. I'm enjoying it anyway though.
---
But you can place them all down? I thought it still didn't let you build past 100% budget
---
The point of video games isn't to be good at them, it's to have fun.
---
Sorry your previous bfs fun shamed you. 
---
I bet a moder could fix it asap. It's probably more to do with dev team management, but I really don't know, seems like a easy fix. Remove board crafting if that's what it takes.
---
You doing rounds or just one?
---
This guy setup in Whitespring, nuked it, came back and rebuilt and was leading ghouls into the line of fire. It was definitely intentional. 
---
I'm on xbox, but thank you! Just talking with a few players here today has gotten me motivated to get back in there and give it another go. The very last quest I attempted was to eliminate a scorpion Queen, but her and her minions thoroughly kicked my ass. I was so dejected by how terrible I am at combat that I had to take several weeks off, but I think I'll get back out there this weekend. 
---
#IAMTHELOUDESTSOPICKMEPLEASE
---
Yes.  I also had 50+ industrial water purifiers, and was placing them when I ran out of water.  That clued me in that I had more that I used to own.
---
Without class freak it's virtually unplayable if you use every mutation. 15 str drops to like 4
---
Oh my God, easter egg confirmed. If you wear the Grease Jacket while an ICBM is launched, you will turn into the Fonz.
---
I mean, that's how the internet and speculation works right? We just confirmed this is a real thing in the game? 
---
XD dammit i was there an hour ago! guess ill just rebuild. thanks for info.
---
I never use them either. I spent a fair amount of time in fo4 with companions and most of them disliked using chems so I just started away from them by habit.
---
No thank you. We're closed today.
---
Good, they can kindly go f themselves 
---
I think that a lot of players actually play stealthy, I mean with the right person you can kill anything one shot except for sb queen
---
Another pc stealth lady here. It's the best way to play! :)
---
No pets are permanent unless they die or glitch out, though even if they die you get a couple respawns before they’re gone for good. Wasteland whisperer and animal friend perks to tame, pacify only lasts 30 seconds but if you tame they start running to your base. Eat up a ton of budget though 
---
Ah rip. I just scrapped all my stuff that got cloned, I think I set down the extra plants just for the laughs but that's about it. 
---
Dude. I spent so much time trying to get up there to see if you could place a camp. Thanks for the verification. How in the world did you get foundations or floors up there though? Does that roof count as terrain?
---
Thank you, this link worked perfectly, I look forward to improving quality of life in Appalachia for a better tomorrow 
---
Anytime I've had a girlfriend who was into gaming it didn't matter how good they were at it. It was something we both enjoyed. That was the important part. 
---
You'll find better. 
---
Good tip thx!
---
Doesnt even have bloodied explosive what kind of vendor are you
---
Sweet I'll take the TSE Combat shotgun for 25 caps. 
---
Its just a server glitch that gave him those turrets. This was caused by no action of his own. I would hardly hold him responsible. 
---
As I recall you can post yourself in a doorway and the enemy AI couldn't flank you and could only engage you from directly in front of you. Killing everyone and looting them breaks the game basically.
---
SEKSY
---
If you want high-end protection, it's bad.
---
If you want something that works against trash mobs, gives you a strength and carry bonus (+100 lbs), it makes a fine exploration/adventure power armor.
---
Shadowed does not exist for Marine. Sleek and Muffled leg mods do (comes from examination if the game files so the information is reliable).
---
It was probably called "The Dragon" it is a 4 barreled black powder rifle, only holds one shot, but it does increased damage, it is a rare drop from death clawss and windigos, it can also be dropped as a legendary from anyone
---
There’s a cool down after every mutation gained, I think it’s between a half hour and an hour. Also the chance for getting one is 5% for every 5 rads gained so you may just have bed luck after the cool down passes
---
There was a bug for a while that stuff would duplicate in the in camps.  I think it had to do with when camps would pack themselves up.  I ended up having something like 400 corn, 100 turrets, and a bunch of other stuff.  It was kind of fun for a while to have a ton of turrets up, but not being able to build stuff got boring quick.  Took me over an hour to delete all of the crap.
---
Same here. Should have though of the long term. I would have liked to have some nice defenses and not limited to like 6 crappy lowest level turrets.
---
I spent 90% of my playtime last night doing the patrol quest. At level 45.

I wouldn’t mind as much if I was getting new Plans each time but the duplicates really fucking pissed me off. Plus some times the Patrol bot would bug out. One time he randomly teleported to just north of white springs........ It’s pathing was horrible and clunky. 
---
It’s doesn’t feel like farming when the event feels so clunky and goofy. 
---
I ended up just buying the plan from a nice guy here. I’m not putting another 5 hours into finding something that I may never get.

Sound like a couple of douches. My girl plays. She's actually pretty good at shooting (mercs people on Rainbow Six) but isnt great with direction and gets lost when we play coop. Sure it can be frustrating but the fun is in sharing an activity with someone you love. Those dudes are probably mediocre players at best and will either end up alone, with someone who doesn't play (wishing they should), or with a girl better at games then them which will really drive them insane. Meanwhile you have fallout 76. Clearly you're the winner here. 
---
Gentlemen!  You can't fight in here!  This is the War Room!
---
&gt;It is ashame that the reviewers of this game never seemed to notice anything beyond pew pew and PVP
---
Almost every review I’ve seen of FO76 mentioned bugs and glitches first and foremost. “Pew pew and PVP” usually comes later in the reviews I’ve seen. I get what you’re saying but you aren’t looking at the other side of the argument: that there are huge fundamental issues with this game aside from levels detail. 
---
 Obvious duper. Please don't encourage these people.
---
Really? Cause it’s been like a week or so now and my friend still won’t make nice with Mr. Cuddles need to use the perk to pacify him every time I have company, how long did it take for yours to fix?
---
I wouldn't mind a harmonica.
---
Yep, and add calibrated shocks to it and you've got the highest carry capacity in the game.
---
*Slaps roof of Excavator power armor with calibrated shocks.* This bad boy can fit so much junk.
---
You sound awesome, your ex's are stupid.
---
at least you are giving it a go and are enjoying what you are doing.
---
cant get my partner to even touch a game, I so wish she would, even if she was shit.
---
Then I could run around and be her hero.
---
There's plenty of things in this game you could not do because later on there's something better. You could say the same about life.
---
You also get Ultracite and X01 through questing. 
---
So do you level up slowly and take your time? The excavator set served me very well until I hit 50+ and got a hold of these other sets. And it was nice to hold all the extra weight. And I think there is a perk on it so when farming ultracite you pick up more with this set than you would without it. (Double check that).
---
Up to you!
---
Depends how much of a hoarder you are I guess. Not a bad utility set
---
[Here](https://imgur.com/mN3UCEr) is mine
---
I haven’t do the last mission before too and would like to join! Hopefully my supplies are enough though x’D My ign is Ariyx. Not sure if yall have already finished the mission by now, but feel free to add me nonetheless! 
---
yep found this after i gave up on turrets in favour of a larger base
---
It's the best for scavvers like me who pick a place clean for resources.  It adds an instant +100 to carry weight with all the pieces and another 100 if you can get both calibrated shocks for the legs.
---
False. The armor/energy rating is not great. BUT!, It gives you +100 carry weight. I use it all the time (lvl 94) to farm different stuff. But I'd recommend getting it to Max level once your lvl 50.
---
Maybe in part, but it seems mostly based on location. My camp gets the same spawns in a particular location no matter what defenses I set up.
---
It’s really handy for hauling loot and extra storage.  I use it all the time.  I’m not a huge fan of the color or style, but it’s meant to be functional not stylish.
---
Ahem, bad. Thank you and good night
---
 No! That's ridiculous. Its the Rifleman's gun.
---
It's bad...mmmmkay
---
Have you done this yet?!
---
Glad someone is having some luck.  My missile turrets just sat idle while two of my low level machinegun turrets struggled to kill some crickets.
---
Also, there is a set of perks that will lower the crafting cost.  I think anyone with PA should have this perk.  
---
Be curious to see if Bethesda do anything about this brazen duper...
---
Doubt it though :(
---
 [/u/lonevaultwanderer](https://www.reddit.com/u/lonevaultwanderer) 
---
Not sure this was possible, considering the game auto-detonates any mine you place after two are laid down?  O_O
---
They sound like a couple of shitheels. Games are meant to be fun, if whatever way you're playing is fun and makes you want to keep playing then you're not a "shit gamer", you're gaming exactly the way you should be.
---
I can have upwards of 500 carry weight. So... yeah. What's not to like about it? I also have two torsos one with Emergency Protocols and one with Motion-Assist Servos. One gives me speed, and damage reduction when below 20% and the other gives me +2 strength so more carry weight! Two Calibrated Shocks on the legs. That's another +100 carry weight.
---
There is cards that benefit solo, I don't see the issue 
---
So...apparently this is stuff that's not supposed to be in the game yet?  Congratulations on your big find.
---
Ignore the elitist twit, Excavator armor is very useful for both the extra carry weight and for the quadruple ore extraction bonus. Completing the quest also gives you the plans for the power armor station for free.
---
Grats on your kill! And great reddit name lol I can say I don’t understand the sneak approach, I find it boring, prefer to go in for heavy melee combat (though I still take it slow and look around for details and story) but to each their own, I’m always surprised how many different ways to play people can enjoy with the same game 
---
Health is generally good, I keep it near max, and trim off rads if they approach 20%.
---
Radx suppresses mutations but you get them back when it wears off, taking multiple doesn't increase duration. Radx diluted does suppress mutations. Radx and radxd are the only chems that stack, and won't remove other chem effects if you take them. No other chems can stack or be taken at the same time.
---
I hope you reported this to Bethesda...not that anything will happen.
---
its PvP that got tacked on last minute to a multiplayer version of fallout
---
Post your shit on ebay and have the people buy it there. I'll tell you now you are not getting 130-150 the best you'll get is 25. Don't post on reddit for this shit there's other places for this kind of stuff. 
---
Thanks man, is it the farm with the Yao Guai there? Because I made the mistake of going there with a super sledge (I play melee a lot) and got the shit kicked outta me and didn’t go back. But hey I found the cat billboard there.
---
Protection wise, not the greatest. It’s power armor which comes with its positives but it is just a tad bit better than Raider, all in all a great suit for hauling all your junk (say you’re going on junk runs) but you’re better off using T45 or higher when it comes to protection.
---
Put calibrated shocks on it?  You can carry probably 400+ pounds without any perks and decent strength. 
---
tldr (for something already short) : for protection you’d be better off using something like T51, but it has amazing utility especially earlier on
---
Hold up. You’re asking for real money?

Congratulations. Don't let anyone dictate you how you play your games. You don't answer to anyone about which games you play and which playstyle you adopt. Who cares if you choose a game, even if you are going to be bad at it? Who cares if you use suboptimal tactics and have fun with things that some people consider mundane? If YOU don't care, noone should care. 
---
Sadly, there are many elitist people out there who judge other just for being casual, bad, having different spending habbits or just choosing different games. These elitists love to follow the more "hardcore" or "complex" games and then look down upon others, while shouting how the "casuals" are what's wrong with gaming industry. Joke's on them - those morons are what's wrong with the industry and its communities. You can see it prevalent in communities that consider themselves as pinnacle of the genre, such as PoE, FNV or Witcher 3. I used to argue with those people, but I've found out that these people are so down their rabbit holes that they can't be reasoned with. The best way to show them is exactly what you did - playing the game/gamestyles they consider unworthy and having fun with it.
---
Definitely worth getting back into. Also, if you are struggling with combat, know that instead of fighting better, you can always fight smarter. Use plenty of VATS and aim for the weak points of creatures: it's usually the head for most human like creature, but may be different, like the belly for the Deathclaws. Pipe guns look weak but are surprisingly powerful.
---
Playing alone is a very exciting experience. Just remember who the dominant species is in the Wastelands!
---
Maybe, but I rarely use chems, just a Psycho from time to time if the excrement has become mechanically distributed through the local air.
---
If they were high level and dropped high level loot that would be one thing. At least legendary cave crickets drop high level loot, rad rats only come up to level 25 for some reason, despite easily being level 50 equivalent, and thus don't drop high level items worthy of their difficulty. Mole rats are also level capped at 21, but at least they die super easily.

It's an amazing versatile power armor and I'm all honesty isn't that bad when it comes to protection imho right now it's just as good as any other power armor and see very little difference between the damage I take. So it's great to have I'm.
---
I chose to buy mine from a guy that farmed it. I tried and was unsuccessful. Since I have plenty of caps I figured why not. I paid 2k for it but I recooped that in less than 48 hours.
---
Well on you, your doing good things out there wastelander
---
The dude doesn't like 76 and makes videos just to remain relevant and to provide a circle jerk of haters in the comments
---
I'd like to join up in the fight.
---
Alright, thanks man. Do you know if you can get bosses because IMAGINE HAVING THE BOSS WENDIGO IN WENDIGO CAVE as a pet.
---
yeah i feel that too.  
---
It's kind of a solitude, right? Sometimes it's good, like the solitude you get when you're on vacation and you're camping or travelling.  
---
But sometimes it's a bad one, when you find everything destroyed and everyone dead. But i guess solitude is just part of the story.  
---
In that sense it reminds me of System Shock 2. I never felt so alone as when i was playing it.
---
I'm surprised we have no Sax or bugle.
---
Both methods of duping I'm privy to are more complex and require changes that address issues with the architecture of the game and service - not the client. A real fix is going to take time - and people have probably just returned (or are returning soon) from long vacations.
---
Until then you'll get small patches that attempt to circumvent the method – not patches that actually address the exploitable code.
---
It'll be a while.
---
Could be system related tbh. I play often with a buddy on Xbox. He has the one X and I have the first gen. Often I disconnect and he doesn't, while my ISP is better and more stable than his.
---
Ok I know it just suppresses it so if you take 2 Rad-X you get +400 rad resistance?
---
The amount of armor it gives you is around half of something like x01 or ultracite. Depending on how fast you level/do the enclave or brotherhood quests it may be a better idea to wait for the higher dmg resist armor. I for one have calibrated shocks (100+ carry weight) on my excavator which gives me 565 carry weight. I have become spoiled by that outrageous amount and can never bring myself to exit the excavator armor. EVER.
---
I'm the reason why that random enemies head exploded next to because im up in the hills out side of town sneaking and sniping.
---
It is a a system I use and enjoy to earn caps and loot I would otherwise have to search for my self.  It is far easier to stalk a 150 lvl player and split 150 caps among the party.  Occasional we find people with way to much junk and we redistribute it among hard to reach spots.  Great system will keep using it.
---
Can't tell you how many times time a shotgun cuts through my power armor and kills me one shot
---
I've got  couple, but never really need them, I'll keep that in mind though.
---
Very nice.  Its a shame we have to make stuff like this for ourselves.
---
not as trash as this lazy, lame ass contribution. 
---
You may have become addicted to psycho then. Try to find some addictol. If I remember correctly, END debuff is a withdrawal symptom for psycho, so I think popping an addictol is a likely cure.
---
Girl fuck those idiots I'm glad your enjoying the game! 
---
&gt; You need to be reminded that fallout is a game and most of us don’t want to fight you. GET A LIFE.
---
Tfw OP is angry for people taking renegade options in a multiplayer game. 
---
Oh, wait. I booze it up quite a bit though. Maybe that's it. Would also explain why it comes and goes so often.
---
No, Maybe yes

The place for this is r/fo76bazaar or [this website](https://www.caps.city/)

Check [nukacrypt](https://nukacrypt.com/solved). They post the codes.
---
Yeah. It could be booze too. The withdrawal goes away when you take the booze and cones back when it wears off.
---
I can craft any other item 274 times for the same exact issue. Has nothing to do with boards. It has to do with the flaws in game server architecture. And even the method is patched we still have mule characters with the boards in our inventory that we can still log in and drop our entire inventory off to duplicate it. So patching the method and actions taken is not going to resolve duping - there has to be a fix to the deployed code in the server AND possibly the client too.
---
Either way, I'll keep track of it. Easy enough to get rid of.
---
I don't sneak a bunch but I explore the shit out of the map. 
---
Your ex's were dumb, it's a game, so long as you enjoy it there isn't a wrong way to play. 
---
I know stupid people will pay but I've seen a lot of people on xbox trying for $10 and $15 for guns just above or below a post of people selling duped god roll legendaries for 750 caps each. The in game economy is fucked but I doubt they're making much in real money beyond the occasional idiot. 
---
Not Texas.  No fiddle required.  No need to rosin up that bow.

Yeah, every once in a while when smushing ghouls I think 'These were people once.  This may be the very one that I was just reading about...'

Yeah I don't get it either, you could cap farm for a few hours and buy any one of those weapons

That last paragraph is exactly how I explained gaming to my gal. She is now a gaming gal and gives me a run for my money in Worms WMD. I was actually going to set her up my ps3 so she can play NV and skyrim today! What coincidence

by all means go ahead and tell me where to find the card that allows me to use stimpaks or radaways on non team members.

Good for you for leaving those losers! I am glad you are having fun playing, that is what counts.

If i have negative strength will it decrease the base dmg of a melee weapon? Example: if a super sledge has a base dmg of 270 and the player has 0 strength due to mutations will it decrease the 270 to a lower dmg and will it also decrease the effectiveness of other mutations that increase weapon dmg
---
I didn't know plans existed for this!!
---
I am level 19 and have the same problem I feel like I have good weapons but lvl 14 snallygasters ate up 30 stimpacks of mine and places seem so empty. I read what I fond and try terminals but other than explore Charleston firehouse I dont have much except dailies. I'm not about to rinse and repeat these events everyday how boring. I hope they add some legit questlines down the road or if I'm missing them make them just slightly more accessible. 
---
wait
---
you can just launch the nukes without getting the pieces?
---
Off topic, but how do u get the emote and mega sloth title next to your name??
---
You just really badly comprehended it.
---
Nope no serums. Not using anything but the nearby rad shower to do the process.
---
Yeah that would be cool. Maybe something like the fiends in Vault 3 in FNV.
---
Hands down most useful PA, can't beat +200 weight carry.  
---
I'm confused what in the game currently requires more protection than Excavator provides. I've tanked multiple queen shots with no defensive perks. I'm not saying it's the best, but... I definitely don't feel like I need more defense for anything enough to give up 100 carry capacity.
---
Yeah taking your time and fully exploring is a great approach in these games. Congrats on the kill!
---
My ex played Skyrim like I would have when I was 10. Two-handed sword and just wade into the crowd of enemies like a got-damn Berserker.
---
And she fucked everything up too.
---
Fuck those guys, they're dicks. Play how you wanna play. That's what these games are all about.
---
I cant upvote this enough. As a girl gamer myself, and having had difficulties like this in the past, im proud of you! There is nothing wrong with how you play, dont let anyone tell you otherwise.
---
Very cool.  Where do you spawn?  How did you set that spot if it wasn't natural?

Women who openly game are a gift from the Omnassiah! Am 43 and game on the PC, my wife is 38 and games on PS4 and XBox One. Gaming is about fun and I think too many people get too competitive when the gender of gamers is involved. My wife often punches her horse by accident Red Dead but constantly out shoots the AI like a real Jessi James!
---
What console are you on? Any low levels I see I either leave alone or help bring the enemies to them and tell them to tag the ghouls to get xp and loot and I'll finish them off. Everytime it's been a win-win. There are nice high level players at I've encountered them were I was lower level. One of my best experiences at a nuked whitesprings was when they kept dropping all the loot they didn't want for me and letting me try to hit some ghouls and save my butt a few times.
---
I simply find it exceedingly amusing how upset people get in workshop pvp.  
---
It could be better.
---
I mean .50 is not that hard to get ahold of in bulk, it uses a little bit more steel than the other ammo types at the Tinker's workbench and you get like 100 rounds at a time. (180 if you max out Ammosmith.)
---
Well, crossplay someday, maybe. It was a plan before Sony pulled out.  To the point though, I have faith that if you can just keep going at your own pace, you’ll get there. There’s no deadline to fun.
---
Do you want one hands or two hand?
---
He was better at call of when we played with his friend (but I wasn't so bad alone online).
---
It's ok if they are "better" but it shouldn't take away our interest and love for gaming, they shouldn't take it away.
---
I didn’t downvote you. I’m actually curious here.
---
When I meet people like you online. My first assumption is that you’re a sociopathic incel in real life.
---
No offence intended. I’m just really curious if you’re actually a well rounded functioning member of society in the real world and just choose to be a huge cunt online.
---
If anything, they are going to miss so much of the actual gameplay that they lose “value” of the game and will most likely be playing fortnite again soon enough. I always take my time, look through everything and sneak is just awesome for bonus damage lol. Don’t let them bother you but also nice on sticking the metaphorical middle finger up at the both of them 
---
holy shit
---
Didnt say it was
---
Two hands, than bk you for mentioni8ng that.
---
Just need a nuclear keycard and you’re good to go 
---
So people who don’t know this are also searching for this? Posts get lost and never seen again, it’s good to resurface a good tip or idea
---
I see. Why do people say to immediately jump servers to get another mutation then?  I thought that was to skip the cool down?
---
Good for you OP, and that's the poi t of the fallout games there's no wrong way to play it. Hell in the originals you could rely on your speech and sneak skills and effectively avoid almost all combat. 
---
Plant Tatos, Mutfruit and Corn at your CAMP. Adhesive for days.
---
How much stuff can you get?
---
How do you take a shit?!
---
Guy here, first of all big congrats for the solo kill. Beat me by 6 levels. Second don't listen to anyone telling you your playing "the wrong way". 76 like most games is built to let each player go thru the game their own way. Play it how you enjoy playing it and find friends that appreciate your style. Game on
---
ah, how do you get that?
---
Ooh, me too! I can be mysterious 😉
---
Have you thought of playing the Hitman series that just came out?  It would be right up your alley... sneaking, disguises, patience, striking at the right time.  If you’re getting into open combat then you’re not playing the game the developers intended. 
---
Not at all.  I was guilty at times of getting frustrated at my ex in some competitive online games when we grouped together. I had a bad habit of trying to teach or be instructive in a constructive way, but it wasn't taken so nicely. Even if I thought I was being polite. 
---
I do not enjoy the screeching on proximity chat or racially insensitive Xbox live messages.  The caps and junk are worth the emotional reactions.  I do have one team member who spazzes our if they are killed in pvp and frankly that is an embarrassing way to react to a pvp death.
---
...the fuck?
---
Do you still have ay spare?
---
My favorite is on the road to watoga. I have a underground tunnel with radio playing in the camp.

Its under gameplay options but sadly it does basically nothing. It makes it to where you can't harm other players or their bases, they can still attack you and if the are running a tse weapon then by the time you can turn it off to respond you are already close to death and they will oneshot you once you engage back. The big issue isnt usually them attacking other players, its that due to the aoe nature of most tse weapons they end up killing most mobs in the area before others an tag them thus robbing people of xp and loot.
---
You only find the stuff you want when you’re not looking for it lol

I followed Grahms route looking for him for 3 hours, gave up and went to a train station to sell stuff and there he was. Oh the irony

Essentially, if you break your game, they are not liable, but their official statement doesn’t say you can’t do it. 
---
Any level restriction you're aware of?
---
Well that sounds like how I play, my build is  vats+crits because I suck to aim in this game and I like first do side quest and explore before doing the main quest
---
My bf is like that on Destiny, he takes it so seriously and I don't, at all. So I decided to not play pvp with him anymore. Like that he's not frustrated by me and if he loses it's clearly not KY fault AND I don't have to do the pvp anymore (and that's a big win) 
---
My gf is decent at games (her words) she's Nott he best at combat so she'll get me to deal with enemies but she loves exploring and finding resources.  We just got ark on game pass with Xbox the other day and she's been playing ever since.  On her own she's tamed a few Dino's, built up a good base and lvld up a good amount on her own.  IM good at combat when I play ark but im not one for the building in this game, so I let her do all that.  Everyone's got there own set of skills be it combat, an eye for base design or any other game mechanic.  Anyone can be good or bad at a game, but it's really how much effort you put into it.  If you stop playing because it's to hard, your bad.  If it's to hard but you find a way to adapt around it, your a fucking pro.

What's even funnier is that the core trick to duping in online games has existed since at least Diablo 1, released 22 years ago.  Most of the dupe tricks are still variations on what we discovered decades ago.

I mean, ants being hella tough makes plenty of sense.

That is insane

Oo she is close to my mother's age (52) and i can't imagine my mother playing anything else other than candy crush.

Ran into him today, just google his name. He is running around wrecking peoples camps and trying to bait people into attacking him. I just stood there and let him try to attack me. He has a TSE shotgun and full assassin Armour. Just avoid people with extremely high bounties.
---
Same, he had nothing when I checked though, he just waffles on about meat..  
---
I added the Stealth to my Blackbird X01 (seems right) and Jetpack to my Hotrod X01.
---
But already had a jetpack, so one spare now, being careful when repairing my hammer and axe now....
---
Yeh there’s a lot that goI s into it. But it’s fair considering its impact in the server and its overall importance to the story.
---
You are our first winner of the day! send me a message with your FO76 gamertag and add me as well. my IGN is Pure_Savagery
---
Dudes that tell you you're shit, are shit. Remember that scorchbeast victory, that's all yours.
---
When you are ready you will know.
---
Good for you! This honestly seems like a game that is done best enjoyed at a slow pace. So much wierd and odd stuff that is easily overlooked if you just rush from place to place blowing though it. I'm honestly curious how far it can be played (practically) without power armor.
---
For a game without much direct NPC interaction, I've been finding to remarkably atmospheric and even startled at times.
---
Saw someone in Alpha earlier today so I raced through Bravo to try and set a nuke off before them, just for fun. I managed to get mine off 5s before the other and we both aimed for the SBQ :P

Took these images of both of them going off, thought they turned out okay, sorry for no pose.

Honestly you should've destroyed it all after getting the clips and let a friendb lol you for the bounty. This is disgusting.
---
It should cost caps to upgrade in increments of 10 that increase in cost. There are almost no cap sinks in this game. I barely trade and I am already at max caps. There’s nothing to spend it on.
---
I didn't know this yet and I'm almost level 40. Not like this is thrown in your face the second you start the game
---
I used level 25 Excavator up until the point I finished my first queen kill.
---
I read this in the most earrapey voice I could imagine.
---
I have those + the ER mutation and Scaly Skin, and rock damn near 700DR/ER in non power armor. Pretty sensational 
---
As I gamer, if my girlfriend played videogames and I thought she was "bad" I would just help her get better without changing her game style. Making someone play as you want them to will most likely make the game boring for the person. That being said, your boyfriends were simply two assholes you are better off without them if they were like that, enjoy your games as you play them.

I'd love to know how one ensures they get the items they are paying for. How do we know you won't just go radio-silent once you get the $?

Not to mention real world trading equals an account ban when you get caught.

My gamer tag is odie714! Thanks so much! Add you where exactly? I’m new to this system and using Reddit 
---
Agreed. Excavator with perks will last for hours of use almost everywhere.
---
I've rarely had to repair it, I rarely ever die and the extra carrying capacity is what sells the armor.
---
I've not used ultracite or other "special" armors but I fail to see what advantage they have over excavator.
---
Mikeyyy likey
---
If you crack open my armor there will be a deluge of feces.
---
I'm all about that bass.
---
It differs for armor type, gf was disaponted, bcos she wanted t-45 one, but u have different for others. Kinda sux.
---
It's honestly making me take a break from the game. After farming for hours trying to get a good gun,  while the best one I have is still a two shot vats combat rifle I BOUGHT off a vendor, while I have teams of people running around whitespring with two shot explosive shotties, it's disheartening. Doesn't help that my rad shower suddenly decided to start crashing my game every time I use it when it was fine before. 
---
I honestly love this game, but things like this can really drive a person away. 
---
You on PS4? If so I will take it off your hands for a few caps.
---
Server jump worked fine for me.  Got them all.  Never took more than 2-3 showers each ( except the day I had the serum).
---
I do see the problem with the loot and XP I have a TSE weapon and when I go into a nuke zone I try to let my friend tag as many enemies as he can but today for example I leveled up about 8 times while he only leveled up 5 times so there is a big difference there I always let him tag legendarys though so we both get the loot
---
Good for you OP!
---
Hehe, yeah the qaud lever action people are in for a rude awakening pretty soon.
---
I mainly want some other path to good equipment than a total RNG grind. In a regular MMORPG you increase your overall power by maybe 10% with each tier of gear you complete, and those tiers consist of 5-10 items usually. In this game a single ultra rare drop ups your firepower to 500% of what it was before, and there is pretty much no other way to progress past level 50.  Something about that needs to change.
---
My second and third characters are actually much slower than my first and I took my time on my first one! Am actually taking my time walking not running and going places I didn't go on my main and just learning to love the game from different perspectives as a different character might experience them. 
---
No matter what I tell you about my offline life you are under no obligation to believe me.  I’m just a normal joe playing a game in my off time who enjoys pvp.  I don’t take what happens a game very serious, I’m not an esport player or trying to run a stream.  As long as killing other player avatars in game gives caps and junk I see no reason not to treat people not in my group as anything other than easily killed and farmed mobs.
---
Do the math. A level 15 vault dwellers will give me 15 caps, the same as an 81 behemoth.  A level 150 vault dwellers will give me 150 caps and junk.  One shot kills on a  Vault Dweller is pretty easier and they respawn faster.

Fair warning I wont be on until this afternoon as I am spending the day with the family.

Rushed world design? That's the one thing this game actually excels at. Then you complain about something that was data-mined that hasn't been released yet and no one knows how it will be handled. Ridiculous. I don't even know what you are talking about with class roleplay system.
---
That's probably the reason you're getting downvoted. You're not making a lot of sense.

For me yesterday, at some point it was happening every single time
---
You need to shoot them in the legs to cripple them.

Never heard of plans for this.

on fallout 76!
---
Nitpick:  Helvetia, not Helvetica.
---
I've been there before.  Cool spot :-)
---
That sucks. I finally got to take part and kill her twice last night on the same server, nuked 3 times in a row. The second and third had about a ten minute interval between the queen dying and the next nuke.
---
I am also on PC and also trying to launch a nuke right now. My in-game name is Jenevra, add me!
---
The funny thing with all my mutations is a majority of them are gotten the natural way

I have no idea if you can tame bosses but that would be the scariest thing to see when visiting someone's camp D:

I run a critical vats/sneak bonus damage rifle build and crouch walk through almost every area I am clearing. I also comb through every corner of an area so I don't miss a thing. There is nothing wrong with your playstyle at all!
---
Furthermore, regardless of how 'bad' your ex boyfriends seem to think you are at video games, what matters is YOUR personal enjoyment of them. So what if you have shit aim? If you're having fun, you're having fun. That is, after all, WHY people play games.
---
I know he calls himself a raider lmao
---
Move on and quit your bitching
---
LOL I doesn’t appear to be around YouTube, interesting with the talks of supposedly at least two complex dupes out therein the rumor mill.  I haven’t noticed groups any more around the maps doing nefarious stuff but it’s funny to watch this cat n mouse game 
---
Had you locked the acid extractor?
---
Profit? Its not that I want to sell them. It looks like you joined the sub yesterday. There has been a lot of people throwing bullets away. Instead of throwing them away, I could use them. You make it sound like I'm a cheater or something. Sorry to ruin your day sir, it was not my intention.
---
lol wait till you get those 3 star rolling pins or tire irons
---
honestly it would probably be better if they did something like diablo 3's seasonal characters than a full wipe.
---
I have the plan learnt on pc if you want me to mod it for you
---
Gaming isn't about the best way it's about doing what you enjoy. 
---
ESO didn't do that so I doubt fo76 will. 
---
Yeah I hated that we couldn't play smite together which I had enjoyed a lot with her. I need to be less competitive in those games. 
---
why? it would probably only reload 5 times.
---
Good thing you flushed those shits out of your life.  Your significant should never put you down to make them feel better about themselves.  
---
I'll name mine FreeHugs. :)
---
Funny thing is, I have Quad double barrel and it still only pops in 2 cartridges on a reload.
---
Fires all 8 insanely fast though, if it was explosive and two shot it would destroy the server from the inside...
---
Completing Wat?
---
Start a campaign about supporting local businesses.
---
Why would you assume that when the qaud pump and qaud single action reload the entire clip?
---
Hey, how are you doing? That's how I like to play mostly too, I love exploring and taking my times with quest, doing that shows that we all are interested on the finer details within games 😁 Another thing, to anyone reading; we are all amazing gamers no matter what race, gender, sexuality or culture. People who hate will always find a way to hate because that's what they do. Everyone can be better than the people who hate by showing kindness and valuing and helping others, it's not "cringey" or "weird" it's decent, it's kind 😊 To the op also, don't take any of the things that they told you to heart, You are spectacular at playing games 😊 Have a great rest of your day everyone ❤️
---
Yup, your life does not depend on it 🤓 be stronger that your hunger to win
---
I like this idea. A lot of folks have been asking for passing of traits from the cards. This I could totally get behind. Also if they make a lot of the perk cards such as the ammo perk or other / cards be passive once you reach a certain level I think that would be a lot better than having to remember to equip every single time.
---
The fact that you didn’t get all defensive and aggressive makes me believe you. All good
---
Man.
---
I was honestly just curious. 
---
Take care :)

Nope, it let me follow the guy around that walked up and started lighting me up with a gatling laser at R&amp;G Station for no reason. He killed me without me firing back and left the server after he got his bounty. So I went and got my Fat Man and the few mini nukes I had, followed him into the next server, tracked him down to his CAMP, completely reduced it and him to rubble, took his junk, and promptly logged off. Fuck that guy.
---
How is banning dupers going to fix duping? I can't actually be the only one who recognizes putinive action as a fundamentally reactionary policy which solves zero problems.
---
A lot of that first part sounds like me! I went to a nuke last night and someone killed me, probably because I accidentally shot them when shooting at the SB uncontrollably XD
---
I'm horrible at combat but I still love FO. If you love the game, play it however you like! Who cares if you sneak or avoid combat. This game is a make it your own! Now, I just wish you couldn't VATS other players if you're passive.
---
 They could pull it off.... here's my idea. 
---
Kill everyone, start from 1 again.... in a new vault. But now there are npc out in the wild... from vault 76.
---
Talk about a fresh start!!
---
Hahaha, OMG I thought this only happened to me. It happened to me twice in a row, third time luckily was a charm.
---
I didn't realize ESO had the same issues. You'd think they'd learn after how many recurring bugs are in their games.
---
Makes me think of Mad Max.
---
Munalos?
---
We need ONE MORE SCORE!!! Jk, even RP-ing as a raider I can’t bring myself to kill another players pet haha I’d feel bad if I accidentally did though.
---
A full wipe once weapons have been rebalanced, two shots and explosive weapons are removed. Lore fixes are implemented, legendaries are fixed, event/quest rewards are fixed, bartering returns, perks/skills are redone and Scorchbeasts and scorched are redone. 
---
Main and side quest lines are all over place. Just keep exploring. 
---
you on xbox then?
---
genius
---
It is based on locale. I got constant Scorched, Mutie, and Molerat attacks near Uncanny and Whitespring with only two turrets.
---
I had my camp on a Lead extractor outside Whitespring, six turrets, barriers, the works, the only time it got attacked were from rare Nuke spawned BloGO's being trained over by fleeing players. No random spawn attacks from molerats or anything else ever.
---
Meanwhile, every ghoul and dog and molerat in Appalachia really hated the small camp I temporarily had on a front porch of an abandoned, boarded up house with one barrier, one turret, and a punji board down the road from Grafton Steel.
---
But they also hated the turret-and-punji filled hellscape that was my Junk Extractor base outside the other side of Whitespring. The Scorched and Super Mutants especially despised my front walls above all else.
---
Meanwhile, on a large steppe overlooking Cranberry Bog, I have a literal fortress and not once has anything attacked, in what is the most hostile area on the map. I have actually deleted all but two turrets in the ~30 hours of playtime my camp has been there to free up budget for decorating and more additions.
---
The game was big trash lol. They almost did a whole remake of the game from ground up. Now look how good the game is. Various bugs sometimes but they get fixed almost immediately. 
---
I would honestly recommend a tesla rifle, it arcs and tags a lot of enemies but doesn't really one shot stuff at least not in nuke zones. Ive found it very helpful
---
That actually sounds cool. I like it.
---
Wow, so many people replied to this and I'm actually shocked?? Anybody good with discord servers that want to organize one for all the people who wish to unite? 
---
Fake.
---
As in real life. You’ll have people with a different agenda (Raiders) lol so you’ll come across folks who will try to shake up your everyday lives of course (: 
---
Ahh didn't know that I'm not so sure then
---
Your Exes sound like assholes. It's not cool to bash people for not being good at video games. Trash talking mid game is one thing, belittling someone's enjoyment of the game is another. I hope you continue to enjoy the game and congrats on taking down the scorched beast. It is no easy task. I've personally never enjoyed a game out of spite before, but it sounds kinda fun.
---
You play the way I do. I might be better at combat, but that's fine. You're in the game, exploring and having fun. And if you killed a Scorchbeast? You're not bad at combat, sista...
---
If you're on PS4, I'm Wallstreet821 there. I have a girlfriend, I'm not thirsty, I don't ever need to see a picture of you.  We can just explore n kill shit. Or - just keep doing you, and to hell with anyone who says otherwise. Fuck those assholes. The assholes who laughed should have been grateful to have a romantic partners who shared their interest.
---
Ok ya I think I have an extra I can give him
---
Bitch bases will be orbital struck
---
In my cases, the stuff is back again after one relogg. And 1/3 of the trees aren’t marked as bulldozerable - meaning when building foundations, one will snap in removing a tree, the second isn’t placable cause of another tree next to it...
---
Grafton has some events that have skill based checks, if have 5 agi you can sink barrels instead of taking them for the pass the buck event. And also up in grafton the dogwood die off if the fertilizer spreader is broke its a luck check to fix it without using mats
---
The game is poorly designed, why are you taking this so personally?
---
The lever action uses the recycled assets from fallout 4 which means it doesn’t use the one round at a time reload that the other guns use. Whether or not you fire 1 or 5 or 20 rounds the same reload animation where the character reloads 5 rounds plays. 
---
I'm building and assassins guild. If you want we would be willing to have a bounty board 
---
Noice

I see most others are PC, but I’m also a stealth/sniper lady who would love to play with other ladies on Xbox! PM me 
---
Banning dupers is part of the solution. Obviously, the duping bugs have to be addressed first, or there will just be a new wave of dupers.
---
Right now there are tons of dupers who have stockpiled thousands of chems, bobbleheads, etc. They have many multiples of TSE weapons to trade away, etc.  All of this blows the game balance way out of whack and is a major cause of server lag. 
---
There are plenty of legitimate players who paid for this game who are having to put up with the problems this causes. At this point Bethesda has two choices: Support honest players, or to allow cheaters to rule the game. If they want to do the former, banning all dupers, or at least wiping their current characters, is really the only path back to sanity.
---
No it’s a cake 
---
That glitch was fixed. There’s a new way players are using to force duplicate everything in your camp using blueprints.
---
I tease my fiancee but that's a whole different beast than mocking your partner for enjoying something their way. 
---
YoU SurE sHOweD THeM!1!1!
---
No you just wasted over 20 dollars on a piece of shit game.
---
Fallout 4 would probably have been a better purchase assuming you don't already have it. Also, you probably do suck at gaming so lulz.
---
Once again you've proven you have no clue what you're talking about. Please stop responding to me.
---
I tamed a lvl 20 giant sloth last night with just 3\* Animal Friend 
---
Syringer with multiple different effects?!?
---
What level are you 
---
110. Long ago. I think second week of the game. Haven't seen one that big since. 
---
Thanks! I use your list for weapons constantly
---
ESO wasn’t made by Bethesda, it was developed by Zenimax Online
---
I might try the serum route too. I got some caps to spend. They work the same way as gaining mutations naturally but I can choose exactly what I want?
---
Worlds full up. 
---
I'd rather buy a 15$ gun off a duper than 15$ worth of atoms from beth, or other microtransactions garbage for another game.
---
You can get fo76 for like 30$ now, and then just buy yourself into end game god tier firepower.
---
There are dumber things to do with your money, if you cant find what you want for caps.
---
If you pay attention to my original comment I'm not referring present. Its referring to the future, as in when the patch drops that finally fixes the lever actions reload.
---
Use a 2 handed build but put 1 handed cards into strength.
---
I have played all fallouts like that, sneak around, explore every inch, and snipe things.  Only way to play!!
---
I’ll be on tonight as well, let’s do it. Ign: ArcherJG. Is this your first nuke?
---
That's stupid.
---
Your exes are stupid.
---
Everything is stupid.
---
Games are to be played in whatever way it suits the player.
---
You're not bad, you just like stealth games lmao
---
Unfortunately, you've gotten a pretty free market you're trying to bring down. Only way you could cut prices so much is to undercut every single seller and monopolize the entirety of every Fallout 76 vendor sector.
---
Oh yeah that's right. I forgot about that.
---
Dat aspect ratio, 
---

---
I think it was in the trailer, but not in the game, what's it do?
---
I completely disagree it can cost up to 50 caps just to fast travel and buy the normal versions of a gun from a vendor can be 500-1200 caps it would not even be worth selling them anymore 
---
I prefer walking cap stashes, otherwise known as Vault Dwellers.  Biggest haul so far was 237 caps.
---
I really would like the grip with "incrase gun bashing damage" like other weapons have.
---
I think you do not fully appreciate the number of idiots that exist in life.
---
30 caps :(
---
Sorta, in the sense that they will see your character randomly lock up all their joints into a position in less than a second... 
---
"NoT aS MaNy dETaiLs As LE WiTcHeRiNo "/s
---
Honestly inside the silo you can actually see the missile. I bet you fall into that room tbh.
---
Idk man, here's my thoughts on constructive criticism, so dont take it harshly. I personally don't get the point of this. From a larpy roleplaying perspective the character is bland and gives us no reason to be invested in them. You survived the bomb and used to be a mechanic?. The grammar and punctuation needs proofread. So with that out of the way, what information are you presenting us? Generic, irrelevant, non statistical based "info" on 4 power armors. No x01, no excavator, no ultracite. No info on repair costs or mats, no info on DMG, energy, or RAD resists for anything. If you're trying to break this up into s ok me kind of tutorial about PA you need to flesh out where you're going with the chapters and what info will be in them, presented as a story. As it is, if I were a new player looking to find out ANYTHING about PA, this is like 450 words that tell me absolutely no information of any value.
---
So, sounds neat in theory, needs some work. 
---
It's why I always focus on their legs in VATS. A crippled cave cricket is no real threat.
---
Oh dear god, thats fucking horrorfying
---
If you were on Xbox I could have given you 600 for free. I have so much ammo just sitting in my stash j don’t use 
---
Fuck yeah!
---
perfect! thanks 
---
Another one right here! I'm on Xbox if anyone wants to team up for some good old-fashioned sneaking about!
---
I may play differently that most. I'm level 77 and I still haven't finished the main story lines. Weve been slowly just exploring. Going to all the map points and discovering new locations and side quests, working on taking work shops and building camps, grinding for good gear at Whitesprings and playing in nuke zones. We just now have started the bunker story bits. 
---
It really depends on what your goal is. For me personally I enjoy the exploring most. So really just dying over and over while I find new areas has been really fun. 
---
They need to use travel agent :|. 50 cap fast travel is just being lazy and wasteful of ones own caps.
---
Well i think your asking for trouble by placing your camp there with a Yao Guai pet. Because it’s going to get shot at by some clueless newbie. 
---
All I know is I am only a level 23, and I can't even wear Raider power armor, so the level 15 for it must be BS, or yet another Bugthesda special.
---
I dont know what are you talking I'm talking about Guns with legendary effects no a lot of people is looking for Normal weapons at least this vendor dont put 5k for a single gun with no legendary effect
---
What did it do? Might have been renamed
---
No problem, thanks for the intention anyway. 
---
I like the idea however, in Skyrim once you use that shout it's pretty much just hack hack hack until the dragon is dead. There's no difficulty to it.
---
Nice! I’m a girl gamer who isn’t that good. But if you ever wanna team up, shoot me an invite! We can be bad at the game together-  NO JUDGEMENT! just inbox me and I’ll shoot you my gamer tag. Either way, enjoy gaming YOUR way and fudge everyone else! 😉
---
Reduced C.A.M.P repair material cost
---
If it meant no more cheaters and exploiters than I'd definitely go for it. But idc, I've got better shit to do and play 
---
310 with the 3rd tier cap collector 
---
AT LEAST 5?? 
---
200!
---
The wording for both of those comments is all over the place man. 
---
how so?
---
Keep calling them out, don't let them win.
---
Congrats on your kill, scorchbeasts are a challenge! You're not a shit gamer, you're stealth and enjoy the game. I'm sorry that you had to deal with that toxic masculinity crap. My ex was the same way. He was so happy to "finally have a gamer girlfriend". A few co-op plays into the relationship and he's talking trash and being a total jerk. I love ESO but never could get into Fallout. 
---
Fallout 76 comes out and he begs me to play. 2 weeks later, I hop on 76 to check it out and really enjoy the game play. We co-op a few times and he starts the same trash talk. 
---
3 weeks later, I've surpassed his level and am offering him better weapons. 4 weeks later he is blaming his repetitive deaths on me "being a higher level" due to high level super mutants. 5 weeks later, he rage quits the game entirely due to me having 60% trophy completion.
---
He begins whining when I am playing and makes a comment about how he now "knows how his ex-girlfriends felt" when he ignored them while gaming. Shortly after this, we break up. 
---
TLDR: BF talked trash in co-op so I smoked him in 76 trophy completion and levelling.
---
This would never work. Especially without dupers. You can easily get any duped item for 700-1k from most dupe shops. Mods, plans cheaper.
---
For non dupers this will never work. It can take 10 hours of server hopping to get one x01 calibrated shock. Mod costs 400-700 from vendor. To give them 300 caps for that work is insane.
---
There has to be viable options for cap farming. They used there time to get you things, they deserve compensation.
---
High prices = legit means of obtaining
---
Low prices = duped
---
If you want good items and low prices...
---
NEVER BITCH ABOUT DUPERS
---
You can chug a mutation serum to suppress the negative effects of mutation.
---
It's an important PSA to bring up basic things.  Yesterday I walked the roads near Vault 76 and found areas I hadn't seen when I started, because I was focused on getting to the Overseer's C.A.M.P.  
---
There's an observation tower near Flatwoods I never have gone to.  I have to, just to complete them.
---
"I would usually buy them, but 1:1 it's not profitable at all"
---
Okay, so why bring up profit then if you're not selling them?
---
And I don't really think it's cheating, so much as it's lazy as hell. Why should someone else put the effort into getting all that ammo just to hand it over to you? Especially when, again, it's probably the easiest ammo to produce in bulk?
---
Like honestly I'll take a duper over a beggar, at least the duper's producing something.
---
(Also "looks like you joined the sub yesterday" like I mean are you too lazy to even look at my comment history? I've been on this sub for more than two weeks at this point.)
---
Melee and shotguns. If a scorchbeast lands it's dead instantly
---
all rise has a special mod you cant obtain at all and super sledges only have 2 mods but sledgehammers can get more rocket mods 
---
sledgehammers are better than super sledges because bethesda logic
---
Right? I even tell them to throw grenades on me so they can tag all the mobs. I don't mind sharing the grindfest.
---
With the perk and caps Bobblehead, I once found a 325 
---
Honestly you are an idiot and your idea will never work even if you find a few people who agree with you.
---
This assumes the fix is as easy as you're thinking will fit the time frame.  
---
&gt;  If you give them time
---
If they launched it as an EA game, that'd be fine. However, they launched it as a 60 dollar game, where bugs like these and to this extent is really inexcusable. 
---
I just found a small group of them in Flatwoods. North side as you come into town.
---
Thanks 
---
because they will be too lazy to put in animation for 20 rounds lol. look how long it took to fix and still not fixed.
---
That’s what I mean it has to cost a lot more for a legendary then the normal one
---
Tank you
---
1. Add a spotlight to get the turrets to see them better.  
---
2. Dont use turrets theyre useless and take up crazy space on the budget
---
Downside if someone attacks you it still hurts you and you cannot hurt them.  
---
Always felt like using chems was cheating.
---
So you're telling me that at a high enough level I can have addiction resistance, and every battle I can just rush in at super speed, with damage reduction, extra-strength, and extra HP recovery rate, and simply bum rush everyone in the room until no one's left standing...?
---
Nah, I rather not take chems and have a good ol' shoot-out like God intended!!
---
Maybe don't stare at the floor all the time? Combat must be terribly difficult. 
---
It's not like you have to look at one certain place either. Literally just straight forward.
---
Keep it up! +1 all the way
---
I thought you can only get level 45 of T-51. Or if it was a level 50, then maybe they patched it. All I know is that I was comparing unmodded, max level T-51 and T-60 and I kept the T-60 as it came out on top. 
---
I like to spank people so if u are interested my gt is HyproCat12 
---
Wow that is a dumbass ex you had there ... FO76 might have its faults, but it's the perfect game to play with your SO... Mine isn't that great at combat either, so she has me help with difficult areas and it's awesome!! It's like a digital jar that I get to flex on opening :) 
---
I’m fine with that as long as it’s balanced like that where we can all reach the same damage thru different paths that cater to our play style. 
---
Why you on the subreddit if you hate the game 😂😂 I have fo4 already but thanks for the tip, move along now 😊
---
I think they removed it since most things use 1 material per type of material 
---
How are the prices unfair?
---
Scarcity, "Fashion"(Bloodied is currently the new sexy), demand (number of people) and what people can afford control prices..
---
Plus Fallout is based off the "US" model, which is FreeMarket / Capitalistic...
---
And adding 100 caps for X effect, no offense, is ridiculous, as X effect is better / worse in different weapons in each class... 
---
No key?   
---
Who do you think is holding Bethesda's paychecks?
---
Would a solution be Bethesda sets up a max personal and stash limit.  Anything above say, 1000 weight can't be accepted in stash and can't be picked up/added to personal inventory? 
---
That's true. But they serve hopping to get those items and basically for get another object of the game from another player. I'm terms everyone can understand sell any item less 5k is a great solution, to higher prices.you know like 6k for s explosive shotgun
---
That's why you get killed on purpose so bounty hunters dont cone for you later on 
---
infexion23 is my GT. level 126 so hit me up.
---
Holy shit, that's awesome! I'm only level 26 and I'm terrified of those things. Girl gamer here and I'm all about if you enjoy it, do it. I don't think you are a shit gamer just because you have a different playstyle than someone else. Those guys are stupid and you deserve better! 
---
Only bummer about wanted is you have to PvP slap them to be able to full damage them when your wanted while they usually 1 shot you with a TSE
---
I’ve moved since, but my favorite was a little NW of Sugar Grove, downhill from a moonshiners camp. Acid deposit located in a spot where after building you have a beautiful 270 degree panoramic view of the valley below you. When I first built it there were also three scorchbeasts circling in the distance.
---
Yep! Put on your shades boys (and girls) we’re going for a ride. 
---
Yes, I’ll be on later tonight. Well Launch some nukes
---
It's a lot of fun stealing workshops and waiting  for them to return.
---
You should not go around destroying random people’s caps just to try to get them to spend there caps you should just try to pvp them so people don’t have to waste there junk
---
Yep! Put on your shades boys (and girls) we’re going for a ride.
---
I still use my TSE sometimes when it’s just me and a couple low levels, I keep Tesla rifles handy to give to the lower levels so they can tag everything at once before I kill it. Otherwise I’m the one using the Tesla rifle. Work smarter not harder :)
---
You found a scorchbeast at 40? Damn, the ones I find are higher and kill me repeatedly. I got plans for better weapons, but need to level some to be anmble to make them.
---
Also, fuck your exes. Who rips their so like that for playing games is beyond me.
---
Assuming they yolo duped everything, 400,000 bobbleheads is about 19 turns through the dupe machine. That's a solid four hours of duping.
---
Like the real question I have is why? That's more bobbleheads than that dude will ever use or sell and more than all of his friends would ever use or sell. Dude could sell from just one stack of those bobbleheads to every vendor every day for 20 years. It's so far beyond excessive.
---
This is one of my favorite posts on this page because it just goes to show anyone can do anything on fo76 and in general and no matter what you can do it.
---
Except everything that Juicehead and like the other 20 competent YouTubers say about the game is legitimate criticism and concern. Circle jerk or not, hate or not, ANYONE as an intelligent open minded individual can see that EVERYTHING he discusses about the game both in negative AND positive lights are very much true. It's a rushed, buggy, asset flip that 9/10 times was meant as a heartless cash grab. Juicehead or not, anyone can see that as fair criticism.
---
I keep them and even keep a manageable amount of them at hand "in case of emergencies"; I still never use them...
---
And then there's one confrontation that seems harder than usual, I use one Psycho-Jet and clear the room. Now it feels like I cheated...
---
Not worth the stimpacks, ammo or annoyance in its current state.
---
I just don’t enjoy those buggy flying fuckers who spam attacks. 
---
Yup. He went to wanted. My plethora of turrets got him. I took his goods since he tried to steal from me. Usually I just take 1 thing out of the junk drops, but I needed the goods. Especially since 30 minutes later I got booted to the xbox homepage. 
---
I've actually started to collect sets of PA and the materials to bring them up to top condition.  The Excavator set is perfectly serviceable.  Is it the best?  Nope, but it's different.
---
I don't like the poor headlamp or the inability to skin it, but otherwise, it's great to begin.
---
I wanna see this.   I'll add you.
---
All I can say is suckers, this game is never going to offer them what they are looking for, they should go back to Fortnite.
---
Thats how i play every game lol
---
But fallout 76 is ran  by zenimax no? If so why did people get banned by them from fo76
---
I don't know what he has but that's not the first time I've heard of him.
---
And it wouldn't surprise me either, one of the original Fallout games had an intelligent Deathclaw as a potential companion.
---
I agree with you on everything but, just dont play fo76, go for new vegas or fo4 if you want better graphics
---
Rust basically
---
In the mire? I’ve seen it dead there a few times before, often wondered, fairly sure there isn’t though.

I've started running off when spotting a bugged one however it still eats away my stim packs :(

What are you wearing?
---
WHO EVEN FINDS HAVING THAT MUCH LOOT FUN AT ALL?
---
Awesome! Thanks a bunch
---
No prob mate thank u anyway
---
It's a example, However dont put me the "US system on Fallout 76 " others games like with a store like this make a better implementation of this kind of things" if,the first objects came for everyone's and those people put lower prices we dont have this stupid high prices. You never feel you are paying to much for something.

Of course you can’t. It’s really money stuff.

What about the people with somewhat limited playtime? The ones who have only hit level 20-30 since release?

Just fuck those people, huh?

I would’ve soloed it, but I kept getting lost. Nothing was doing any damage to me I just kept going in circles lol

On the plus side I feel more like Zoro now lol

On PS4 the direction knob/joysticks are so touchy...very hard to stay straight or true. Still can’t get it after dozens of try’s.  Can’t believe the whole  quest line hinges on this stupid course!

Personally it still kinda is. Because they can potentially drop ultracite plans. It's a rare drop but still possible. 
---
Fake News. 
---
Damn how do u get that high I’m only at 170 and it’s a pain having to go back and forth to my camp every 30-45 minutes to unload shit.
---
Oh crap i thought it was me.
---
Or shoot the people who placed them. I don't take damage but it's damn annoying to walk into my camp through a hail of bullets.
---
It’s a glitch, not reportable. I had it happen to me and it gave me 500 of every crop.
---
I'm role playing a raider. I have to destroy their camp. It's my life.
---
I see the costumes under outfits but not the hats :/
---
Really? Well shit...
---
That's exactly what just happen. Then they logged out so we couldn't even remake. No fun but oh well.
---
If it’s not worth you teaming up, why should I care about it?  Nobody is begging you to heal them, stimpacks and radaway are not scarce.
---
Team up if you want to be a medic.  Nobody needs a random person healing them sometimes.
---
We get the point man. It can’t be done 
---
Junk
---
If you don’t use turrets what do you? I want my base to defend itself when I’m not there 
---
As a guy in a relationship, I have to say that’s no way to talk to your SO. In my opinion, being in a relationship is all about lifting the other up, and I’m really sorry you had to deal with people like that.
---
What’s crazy to me is how they put you down about being good at video games. Their purpose is _literally_ only for entertainment. I’m glad to hear you’re enjoying the game—that’s all that matters here.
---
Ok, yes but sometimes you dont feel you are paying to much for something like X-01 Jetpack it's Rare True but if you start Server Hopping you can get that, True you can spent a lot of hours looking for it but you get that for 500 caps 
---
But how? Hacks? That's all I can imagine
---
I guess folks would rather be dicks than just use the hunter/hunted channel to find pvp partners 
---
Same. I keep radaway and stims and sell the rest. 
---
I got a prime handmade plan off one last night. They drop quick with the right build

I did before I posted this. Biggest mistake of my life.

Doesn't another player have to kill you for it to go away, though?
---
...and? 
---
Great stuff.
---
Not at all. Buying guns from dupers and selling to others is a good way to make caps.
---
10 is nothing. Anyone that's a legit duper has a 100+
---
Excavator PA with shocks most likely
---
The pa station is worth it alone in my opinion
---
Not OP but this is from the prima fallout 76 guide book,  It's pretty decent. I bought the digital version from the Google play store for $5. Its just nice having a bunch of little information all organized and one place.
---
fusion cores wouldn't be that hard if you played long enough, they usually spawn at 50/70/100% for me, but that number of bobbleheads is ridiculous.
---
Then a bunch of banned dupers come crying to Reddit saying Bethesda canceled my account, because no reasons boo-hoo.  If Bethesda banned them, just know they aren't in the business of losing more customers, so they definitely did it for a reason.  Just because a poster says they did not cheat, does not make them innocent.  Everyone in jail is innocent, and the guilty complain the most.
---
You’re a genius.
---
They're making very good beer money on Ebay selling dupes, actually. while you just sit on here and complain about them ruining the health of a game that was already dead on arrival. You gave Bethesda, what? $60? $80? $300? God knows how much in microtransaction cash for a ticket on the Titanic?  
---
But no they're the stupid assholes for turning a profit out of this mess before Fo76 is unplugged, right?    
---
I said that its not profitable because 1:1 could cost more than buying the materials to craft them.
---
If the game allowed us to sell things for like 0.25 caps, I would gladly buy them.
---
"Why would someone else put the effort into getting all that ammo just to hand it over to you?"
---
There are people that are lvl100+ that haven't "put the effort into getting all that ammo". They have thousand of bullets (That they obviously didn't craft), and the stash is not infinite. Why throw them?
---
"Like honestly I'll take a duper over a beggar, at least the duper's producing something."
---
Yeah, they are producing a broken economy.
---
I'm never going to agree with someone who thinks that dupers are better than a guy who asked for bullets on a sub.
---
"(Also "looks like you joined the sub yesterday" like I mean are you too lazy to even look at my comment history? I've been on this sub for more than two weeks at this point.)"
---
Yeah, I'm not going to investigate you, I'm not the fucking fbi.  (wooow two weeks, happy birthday grandpa)
---
Crashes have also been reportedly caused by an over abundance of holotapes and notes.
---
What makes you think he was glitching? 
---
Someone is always going to think X is worth less / More than another, it's just part of how we value things..
---
I carried my level 15 2 shot back powder rifle with me for 220 levels, and would not part with it for anything.
---
As for not being put in the "US" system.. Well it takes place in the States, and Barter / FreeMarket was the global standard for the majority of humanities existence outside of Fascist / Socialist / Directorships, and even then there has always been a "Free Market" black market.
---
Nah, I’m stupid. 
---
I'm role playing a raider. They dont have a pip boy or a radio. Cant do it.
---
Radrats and cave crickets never do enough damage to cause me trouble, but for some reason I’m always surprised when they take more then one hit to kill they definitely take more hits then super mutants and mole miners which seems weird and wrong 
---
This isn't "roleplaying".  It's just being a douche.
---
Roleplaying means having an identity and persona with a personality, goals, likes/loves, relationships, and most importantly- nuance.  Raiders have friends, people they still love and like to keep around; they have pasts and history with places and other communities; they reflect those experiences in how they are as human beings, even if it's crappy human beings.  A good villain has depth and complexity to them.
---
You've mistaken all of the above for simply a blanket excuse to go out and be an online jerk and troll.  
---
If you're serious about roleplaying as a Raider; hook up with other raiders, build a gang, listen to the Rose questline holotapes and her hinted dialogue at what she used to love.  Try thinking about meeting funny people/victims that might have made you laugh so much, you didn't end up killing them.  Go listen to the Fallout 4 Raider convos about 'grenade boy' and 'mattress kid'.  These things might help you add depth and complexity to what roleplaying a raider really is.  
---
F that, just wipe out all TSE weapons and I’m fine with that.  Otherwise I’ll be gone and go out of my way to make sure they never get any more of my money.
---
You do that stuff in early access or beta, not with the full product I was sold. 
---
And strong back perk card
---
I had a thing written up but it would have just made people butt hurt.   
---
Look Bethesda did the last straw with me on the 2nd they basically licked the wound that is duping. So now I am all for it. All hail the dupers let the items rain and be worthless. Fuck the marketplace they are overpriced thinking they have some moral high ground left go to the bazaar or better yet LFG if on xbox and buy it is hundreds of caps for what once was 5-8k. 
---
I’ve seen it 59 times thus far and always dead... however I did get to see it alive briefly and see it’s inven.. enclave/brotherhood type stuff... then a fugging scorchbeast happened.
---
Because he had so much ammunition. Like..tens of thousands of ammunition. I also know he has cheated and done similar exploits in other games as well.
---
You are our winner number two! send me a message with your Fallout76 IGN, you will need to friend me as well, My IGN is Pure_Savagery
---
Lol! I did almost the same. I put a rocking chair on the roof instead of a couch. 
---
I slowly sip mutfruit juice as I watch the world burn.
---
Points in strength contribute to how much you can carry. 
---
Excavator power armor increases carry weight by 100, and add calibrated shocks and then the carry weight is up another 100, 200 total.
---
Yeah I get wanted alot for damaging camps when I am wanted I switch servers and store my junk then go to groups of players and let them kill me. 
---
Colonel - I still listen to it and still tear up.
---
Are you on right now?
---
Their dupping, and then listing the items on RMT sites. I've seen via https://youtu.be/GWJQ5QVdcog Juice Head cover it spot on.
---
Definitely do not give them an inch, report them, kill them, stop them anyway possible.
---
This is the new end boss folks, it's Raid night on Duppers!
---
Junk and caps if through pvp.  
---
I'm level 161, so I highly doubt it. But I could be wrong. Pretty sure I've been seeing the plans for a long while though.
---
I think it's just the wrong model.
---
You can join our team.  Im level 45, buddy is level 70.  You will better off teaming in more difficult areas.  If not, do the overseers missions.  Good loot to begin with and XP.  Also claim workshops,  and head to Mothman city (forgot the names atm). Lots of level zero mobs.  
---
Ps4: utchia23
---
I found the problem. I just cant exit my power armor. If i join a server with it on im fine but as soon as i exit my power armor suit. I lose it. Even if i put the suit back on i dont get it all back
---
The way you're putting it is making me sound like an asshole. I'm just trying to help, you know?
---
I was lvl 90+ and saw it at the watoga shopping plaza a few times
---
Seems they've lost touch with what games are for. It's not about being good it's about having fun doing something you find meaningful. I admit with my girlfriend I can get a bit pushy when she is playing persona 5 and is making poor decisions in a fight but I love the amount of joy she finds in hanging out with the characters decorating her room playing at the batting cages sure she isn't the most efficient but the world she finds seems a lot more fun than mine in all honesty.
---
Level 1 mobs.  Typo
---
You never asked my back story, identity, persona or any such thing. You can try and tell me I'm not roleplaying but you're wrong. You cant limit what someone is doing because they dont fit your definition. 
---
Excavator can get calibrated shocks (+50 carry leg mods) like every other power armor set. You can find them occasionally in Harpers Ferry and a bunch of other vendors. Excavator mods aren't called "Excavator", just the mod name ("Calibrated Shock" in this case).
---
And keep your eyes peeled. There are maps everywhere ... 
---
Its not the best protection in the endgame but I still see plenty of yellow cans out there even vs. Sierra Bravo (the Queen).  You can craft them at level 25/35/45 though doing all 3 sets can get expensive.  I know I did at least 25/45 but I might have skipped over the 35.  It was the first thing I did on my character (3rd restart) when I hit lvl 25.  Used it till I was 60+ before I carried 2 suits with me.  15-25 in Raider PA (made sure I got that Raider set by 15 too).
---
The extra carry weight from a full Excavator set is very nice to have.  I still carry it around for fast travel and while exploring, though I keep a 2nd suit for combat duties now.  And if you go mining ore, the hands give you extra ore so there's another benefit!
---
I don't know where you were at to farm mutations but I have found that it seems you need to be in a spot where you get 25+ rads per second to consistently get mutations. I farmed mine at blackwater mine, it also has a rad shower in there so you don't have to waste rad-away. Hope this helps.
---
You should do the quest just for the simple fact that you get the PA crafting station plans from it. It helps with building up initial supplies especially at a lower level. Early to kid game it's great. I have better sets L, but I stick to my excavator whenever I'm going on loot runs. 
---
That takes the fun out of the game just block them if they are bothering you or do what I do and server hop
---
Nothing is wrong with that. Thats not what people do though. They afk and have a macro auto clicking every 5 mins to pressing w every 5 mins to keep them logged in.
---
1. Xbox One X
---
2. King Speedlemon
---
3. NA
---
4. lots of disconnects and crashes. Was playing with some friends and they dropped a nuke on me. I looked up saw the payload about 3 inches from my face, then the screen went white and the game crashed. (still got the achievement).  
---
Then later I was capturing some workbenches to get material and was attacked by a Scorchbeast. During the attack the game crashed so yay I'm out a few hundred caps for that. I'm only lvl 20 so I only had a few hundred caps
---
Personally I think it’s a blast of a game. But it’s a blast riddled with issues. A lot of crashes and bugs. A lot of duping of really powerful guns everywhere. But still a great world to explore and a lot of fun to be had. I’m glad I got it.
---
I got an explosive tesla yesterday, it is ... interesting.
---
Intentional pun? Stuff....stuffed bears....
---
Basic playability shouldnt be something you have to "earn".
---
Thanks for the advice I will definitely head there sometime. I'm not on now so I will have to add you later 
---
Someone already mentioned that it just slowly pages you to the side as it opens. ☹️
---
I found playing the pink panther theme helps you sneakiness in any game
---
I've played both! I enjoy a bit of fallout and Skyrim 
---
Thank you! I'll try there next
---
I sneak my way everywhere. I also don't hit chems (yet hoard them like I want to open a pharmacy .) I'm a solid sniper and can re-position on the fly but I am rubbish at any PvP. I love lore and rare finds. Gaming comes in all suits.  
---
You got your clubs, love melee, fighting, mayhem and destruction. Max chaos. Spades that min/max their builds, create the meta and find the best exploits. Diamonds that hoard the rare and exclusive, best items and titles. Hearts that love the team and the story, the community at large. I am like 60/40 diamond-heart. There is mix to everyone. The only shit gamer is the one that thinks there way is the only way. Enjoy the game.
---
I only have animal friend maxed, don't have any for wasteland whisperer, and i'm still able to tame fine!
---
lawls ,using Bethesda and solutions in the same sentence
---
Theres a magazine that reduces camp repair costs.
---
I went off your own words.
---
&gt; I'm level 125, I just want to have a fun time like everyone else. When i find a camp of a person around my level. I destroy their camp for that nice wanted level. 
---
You don't add any details that provide depth or nuance, instead stating in an Out-of-character post that you get your fun by destroying other players' camps.  There's no roleplaying here, it's all meta.  So don't make up an excuse.  You're NOT roleplaying.
---
If you are wearing excavator armor quit and rejoin a world your weight will increase by 100+ on top of the 100 excavator give you until you exit the power armor. However if you join your friend world while the glitch is on your game will crash, at least that is what’s happening to me
---
I understand your point and the problem of duping but this is a bit of an extreme solution. 
---
A lot of people have spent hundreds of hours in this game (myself at 350 hrs) already via legitimate means. 
---
I'd rather they do a full item wipe.
---
I dont like the idea of losing 2 characters ive spent time character planning and levelling, reduced to nothing, it would make me quit the game completely.
---
Positively hoisted 
---
It's Ghosttchild :)
---
I found that too, near the overlook near the highest point in WV. From what I could tell, all it does is lead the rats back and fourth in a loop. It would have been cool/funny if it lead them off the cliff face
---
Why's this a big deal? Honestly if he wants 500k wood let him have it. If he just wants to log in and dupe the shit out of everything let him. Th ia happens on EVERY morph. Why's it a big deal that it's happening to 76? News flash they've been doing this sense launch. So many salty people over something so trivial.
---
Intentionally crashing servers just so they can selfishly dupe their items. Highest tier of Selfish Asshole you can reach, really.
---
Thanks, that was really fun :)
---
Never experience a so laggy server before, and we got her just in time.
---
Just let me know if you plan any more, i will be ready.
---
Those that call them out cop it for it. Trust me been dealing with the dupers for eight weeks now. Especially on the trade subs with their ask for real money...
---
Don't let them bother you, fuck dupers , fuck Bethesda for not doing a thing about them, fuck the people paying them real money for this crap....
---
Your doing a good thing constantly reminding Bethesda here they need to stop this issue. Eight weeks of it has caused serious harm to the unreal game.
---
So do you go find a deathclaw, tame it then put your camp there? 
---
I got those perks much later on, you need build perks first.  Mats are always obtainable...  for black titanium just take over Gorge Junkyard.
---
It was a glitch ... continuing to use them (as in knowingly placing them) is an exploit. 
---
Absolutely report it. Worse case they delete them for him.
---
Your dignity
---
sent request
---
Which cards are these?
---
Repairing that 100 power generator cost alot
---
fucking dicks, drop the ban hammer on em.
---
I'd say he probably just dropped his whole inventory, which honestly could probably even be macroed. I don't know how the duping exploits in fo76 work, (well I probably do since a lot of them are most likely same exploits that are used in other games) and I assume automating the process is probably just as easy with a macro. 
---
5k caps isn’t much if you’re farming caps.
---
You can spend those few days farming or just bite the bullet and buy the item.
---
It’s all about how much you value your time and how much of it you have.
---
I bought a Plan last night for 1500 caps that I had burning a hole in my wallet. I usually only spend caps on fast travel. So my 10k in caps just grows. I don’t even make it a habit of depleting the vendors ever 20 hours. 
---
I think prices for the most part are fair.
---
Thats really dumb that they gave you crap. Especially if you're a different class! I play as tank and my husband plays sneak thief/assassin. Its fantastic because i just run in and smack everything with a baseball bat and he covers me. If your ex's werent such d-bags you might have learned to team well.
---
Either way, good on you! 
---
When you wanna trade
---
Well be on later today. Around 7pm est.
---
Yeah buddy as others have said they sell their dupe shit for real money. Problem is people are paying them to get the best in slot gear, weapons , caps , perfect xmen builds and so on.
---
Its a major issue among traders and i have stopped trading now because the market is fucked by these wankers.
---
That's the thing, it's an online survival game, not a rpg or an mmo. If Bethesda does anything like that, the game will just be an mmo. And trust me, fo76 is alot more forgiving than any other online survival game. 
---
On xbox we are forming a town of sort close to fissure site prime 4 people have already joined I joined yesterday as the farmer I make a TON of food and water for everyone come join us if you want. Level doesn't, matter if you can live down there you good enough the mayor's name is MrDiamond01. we are all randoms btw I know none of them. We range from lvl 30 to in the 100s and it doesn't matter if you have a mic or not. And there is a fissure site nearby and and there are tons of bodies laying outside the city
---
hes is so annoying and not sure if he still does but used to do some stupid ass ending to every video with some bs he learned in his 101 class like some dumb ass bimbo. 
---
Didn't upload I'll work on that
---
You loose stimpacks when you don't just die.
---
Part of the long list of bethesda incentifying things that aren't fun.
---
Did the ghouls rape the unarmed?
---
Can I add u ingame so I can see it?
---
If you can, get a combat shotgun and enforcer rank 3. I take our their wings real quick and they're stuck on the ground for most of their health. 
---
However, sometimes they'll bug and with *literally* every part broken, they won't land until the last 1/4 of their hp. 
---
And usually level 24 or 26. Just stay out of the blast!
---
how much is it?
---
&gt;I feel like half of console crashes are proprietary BS that the console itself causes.
---
...that ONLY happen for this game?
---
It's the console's fault?
---
Seriously...?
---
Get yourself some high intel to get the gunsmith perks, find a combat shotgun your level (try scorched...they usually have shotguns) and mod the fuck out of it.
---
I run with a combat shotgun that does I think 130 or so damage per shot. Then you can run and gun. My secondary weapon is a highly modded hunting rifle I turned into a sniper rifle. I pick off as many enemies as I can then bust out my shotgun.
---
Helps if you have decent armor and are mutated.
---
I recommend mutation farming until you get healing factor and those two mutations that give you radiation damage/electrical damage to melee enemies.
---
If you can't get good armor, roll with some power armor.
---
But the best thing is to have a friend who can save your ass if you need it. Two players against the world is MUCH easier then going solo in this game.
---
Hopefully one of my tips can help you a little.
---
And honestly, your playstyle is fine. If you want to be a stealthy assassin, go ahead. I flip between sniper/shotgunner but stealth has never been my strong suit. The only time I went full stealthy is when I was doing Fallout 4 on survival mode lol. The only chems I use are Med-X for roleplay purposes (my character is an addict) and sometimes buffout for more carry weight if I need it. I love exploring and collecting and in single player Fallout games I skip the main plot quest every time because it's boring and I just want to do my own thing. I used to rely on VATS for every hit in single player Fallouts too...but since VATS was changed for FO76...I hardly use it now.
---
Tell me about it my entire camp got destroyed buy like 2 level 130 both with bounties over 2k 
---
That would be awesome! Lol 
---
The devil went down to Georgia, not West Virginia
---
Again, you didnt ask. I said I was role playing in game as a raider and I made a post saying most people leave when their camp is attacked. I AM roleplaying. If you want the whole story, ask. It's funny you think you can tell me what I am or am not doing.
---
Did you kill it? Get any loot?
---
13 Im broke asf 
---
Doesn't work if the game crashes completely, only if the server disocnnects.
---
I actually think there's been more updates than 2... but that's not really what I'm amazed at with Fallout 76.  As time goes on, its becoming very very clear that Bethesda intentionally released this knowing its extremely unfinished, and their "business strategy" so to speak, is to have gamers play it and decide what needs to be added.  That to me, at least personally, kind of concerns me on Bethesda's future. 
---
Don't get me wrong, no game is perfect and all games have bugs.  But this is incredibly blatant.  Like, if modders are going to solve this many of their issues, why not just hire those guys at that point?  At least they've proven that they actually WANT to work on the game.... 
---
Damn people need to just play the game fucking duping ruins servers for everyone and then those fuckers blame bgs.
---
And they want to include a PVP specific mode later. Let that sink in 
---
Step one is to sort out where you're willing to cut off. It's gradual, not just 20%, so you can easily do half-life and not have to run at the wire.
---
Dirty water/toxic water can be used to build your rads to the cut off to stay at your mark. I like Toxic Goo from WestTek in case I wander through a decon or get rez with antirad.
---
Depending on the rest of the build you can go a few ways. Nerd Rage (INT) is good times, but Adrenaline (AGI) can be even better. Both stack, so if you aren't doing  a big guns/explosive build you might be able  to afford Nerd Rage. If you're solo consider Lone Wanderer (CHA). Sentinel Armor can add additional damage reduction (while not moving) and there are also affixes for damage reduction while sprinting. Empathy mutation is wild, but get some caps ready to spend on serums. Adrenal Reaction mutation is great. Unyielding armor is a staple, but not completely necessary when you first start out.
---
The final step is to laugh in 10HP land at the Two-Shot prefix.
---
Wearing the garb of mystery as a male avatar makes me feel vastly more immedating.
---
I'm sorry, I know this isn't helpful but I gotta ask. How do you misspell melee two times but both are different? Like I understand misspelling but I'm flabbergasted at how you changed the misspelling the second time.
---
hot damn.
---
There is a setting for pacifist mode.  
---
I see why you scratched the name so others won't get the incentive to seek this person out, especially with their devious acts. But part of me wishes that you had left their name unveiled to give us so that we may avoid this individual and not seek them out and if it would even help all of us reporting them as well. Hopefully they can wipe all their characters and get rid of them altogether. 
---
I use excavator PA for everything. It's resistance is good enough since nothing in this game is difficult,, ande extra 200lbs carry weight is outstanding.
---
As a fellow girl gamer, you kick that scorchbeast ass. Well done, madam!!!
---
What's this Parkour? I'll head there now and try it.
---
Fuck them. Games mean different things to different people, and i fucking hate how almost every player i meet plays to be competitive, and completely miss out on great moments of storytelling or small immersive details. You deserve better, so play for you, not for anybody else.
---
Heavy standard and light have different stats.
---
Dupe glitch
---
i’m assuming his is a higher level?
---
You base will only get attacked when other players are neaby it and the enemies will scale with that player, turrets only seem to go to about level 15 and get raped by any enemy in seconds
---
I don't have this luxury to one shot things but i will be honest if I get to that point and I need to farm I'm gonna one shot everything cuz I don't have all the time in the world. If I see someone lower level sure I'll let them tag jt but yea
---
Oh good god I was looking at the wrong side of the trade menu Jesus.
---
Nope both level 50 heavy
---
It’s straight below the big chicken on the map
---
Mine is also heavy 
---
Level 80 ... If I make it to a stash great, if not then no big lose aside from after visiting a blast site ( flux ).
---
My camp is pretty complete, full repaired sets of leveled Power Armor, enough mats to repair everything a few times using perks. 
---
I don't really like to use chems either. Maybe grape menstats for getting something from vendor much cheaper, only time I used them for battle was a glitched Glassed Cavern with 2 scorchbeasts. Other than that they are vendor fodder.
---
I did try to stack intelligence with Daytripper to create weapons with better durability a couple of times (after I accidentally scrapped one of my main weapons of course).
---
Aside from swapping out perks and focusing on getting a specific build going...no.  i really had no idea what i was doing until about level 40.
---
Which vendor or area has a chance to have it?
---
It was a while ago, but I'm not sure if there was a yao guai. I remember there was a Snallygaster, and it was chasing me around. There were actually two. But I was too low level, and they were level 40, so I wasn't making any damage. So I just left. But I do remember you couldn't go in the house. There was a little shack right next to the pond. And there were big rocks on the south side of the pond. Some nuclear waste barrels too. And it was at the very top of the hill. 
---
Yeah when I was in a nuke zone I had to repair individual pieces before I could fix it all.
---
Mine is taken about the same moment, but from much further away. [Boom](https://imgur.com/X6e9epm)
---
This guy gets it.
---
What Bethesda SHOULD do is make a Passive-Aggressive setting, where you can defend yourself, but not have to worry about being the one to take the first shot or get Wanted for some abstract misfire.
---
But you don't have to buy the materials? Steel is everywhere. Lead isn't that hard to find either, and gunpowder drops from anything that can hold a gun. Take a machete to a bunch of low-level Scorched and there you go. I can agree that it'd be nice to be able to sell excess ammo, but if you're really making this ammo to use, profit is pointless. (Especially when you can just wander around a nuke zone for a bit, pick plants, and bam. Easy profit.)
---
And as for the duper thing, I don't want either of you frankly. But the duper at least took the time to learn HOW to dupe, and then start pumping out thousands upon thousands of rounds. Do I like it? No. But they're still doing more than posting "hey you're not using that give it to me for absolutely nothing in return".
---
And "investigating". Hah. I'm just pointing out your lazy ass can't click two links and see I didn't "just join yesterday". 
---
The reset is 20 hours from you first interaction with them once  they have refilled. So if you check back and find something you want and you sell them more to recoup some of the caps you spent the time doesn't restart. 
---
I try to get my 1400 caps right at login and check back for plans after most disconnects. Their caps are always available at my normal login time.
---
They do sometimes glitch and not display properly so try selling something to get their Compaq computer brains warmed up if that happens. Worst case it will tell you they're out of caps for real.
---
Did you know if u walk up to the CAMP and look at it it says the player name?
---
During the beta it was a hot topic... aside from a sense of accomplishment/realisation of how much time you’ve wasted? Well, I’d hate to spoilt it for you.
---
I decided to leave it alone. I was like lvl 15 at the time and didn't want to possibly have to fight 6 lvl 25 rats all at once.
---
Skyrim was my kickoff back into the gaming world, too!  I still love it.
---
Right this very second?
---
Junk in over.  Junk and caps equal to your level in pvp.
---
Was going to come in here and talk about Ginnie bags. You have warmed my nostalgia.
---
My Two Shot the Dragon, AKA my most important weapon, just vanished.
---
Last time I used it it broke, and I just fixed it. After I'd fixed it it mistakenly had a magazine size of 7 instead of 1 (which is a huge deal, since the weapon has a huge reload time). Fast traveled somewhere else, gone. Guess the game things I cheated with the magazine size, even though I didn't do a thing.
---
So, so lame. I was so excited when I found the weapon and my whole playstyle is based around it. Ugh.
---
Yessir
---
Theyve already said they dont have the capability to see or interact woth players' inventories.
---
I tried it for hours at launch but couldn't get up there.  Went back later with Marsupial and got to the end much easier.  There's not much up there.  Only thing I remember is a note, from a guy who did it before and planned to turn it into his little base.
---
Each stage of the course does have a medkit, though, so you can get a few stimpacks and maybe some water when you do it.

What does WV mean because I wanna go find it
---
I don’t get it. Who cares how someone plays a game? I’m guessing they made fun of you when playing fallout 3 or 4. Those are single player games. I wouldn’t care if you literally looted everything and kept going back to the base to drop off your stuff. ITS YOUR GAME. 
---
That being said, I hope you have many more hours of fun in Fallout 76!!
---
Duping was gone I thought with the quick fix
---
PS4 Pro - Massive Game Stability issues. Had 3 Bluescreen crashes in a Row during a whitespring Nuke Event playing in a Team today. Crashes occured approx. 5 Minutes in the Game.
---
Had a freeze and a bluescreeen crash while trading with a vendor and while running into a nuke free whitespring zone on a different server without a Team the same day.
---
Generally speaking the Stability of the Game is an insult on PS4 Pro from my point of view! Teaming up with Friends and being in Whitespring seems to worsen the stability.
---
Friends playing on standart PS4 are having similar issues.
---
I would love to get a link to this data!!!!
---
i definitely had this issue myself near poseidon power plant. found chally the moo moo fine and could hear grahm but couldn't find that jerk anywhere, think he was stuff in a cliff side nearby 
---
I swap luck up and down for better drops...but other than that, no.
---
Only if you want to keep trying to find or make Ultracite 10mm ammunition.
---
That is how I play, especially fallout, as a gamer for 31 years. I really like sneak-esque games like splinter cell and hitman. I checkout *everything*.
---
Probably 40, but I don't do the search perk or w/e. I don't have much use for caps besides traveling and the random plan here or there. 
---
Really I just sell stuff for caps because breaking it down tends to not be worth it. 
---
You should play Red Dog Redemption 2, completely cat free.
---
The boss mod is too great...just finished a full set of weightless.
---
Hmm that would be a bad idea as children in most if not all Bethesda games kids tend to be invincible. But nuking kids sounds like fun.
---
Overrepair.
---
There are plenty more of these pvp flagging exploits. That's what happens when you have stupid pvp flagging system.  
---
For anyone wondering, no he doesn't, no he isn't, and your videos are bad and you should feel bad.
---
HeY eVeRyBoDy Go WaTcH ThIs HiLaRiOuS ViDeO. Go back to begging on sub4subs plz, or at least stop trying so hard, it's very unbecoming of you
---
nope still working for them
---
yeah gonna try this. RIP my flux supply. Gonna have to farm some wood and steel. :(
---
West Virginia
---
I killed it once and nothing happened, the rats kept going along their path.
---
the subtle art of not giving a fuck
---
Check out the overseer stash box at her camp and the church in Flatwoods.  Higher level characters are putting stuff in those places all the time.
---
No, you just craft one less now. 
---
Just get used to duping. 
---
Countdown started
---
love you &lt;3
---
Hell we should have the technology  by now
---
They *ARE* a pissy bunch.
---
Did u know u can also use binoculars? Yeah! They wind up in ur weapons and u can use em like they are intended
---
If they did somehow crack down on this, I’d like the miles to get taken down as well. Profiteering from the cheating without putting the effort into doing the cheating.
---
That increase resistance??
---
How cool would it be to create hordes of super stealth chick play teams! We could be the Sneaky Bitches lol
---
different mods on it, possibly? 
---
Yeah, I don't really care. You clearly don't have bullets to spare. And again sir, sorry for ruining your day. Lets end this shitty argument here
---
So do enlighten us.  What's your rationale for attacking camps, for example?  Do you derive sustenance or profit from it as Raiders might desire?  No.  Is there a protection racket you're running?  You didn't state anything like it.  I am very curious now, what reasons do you use to rationalize your behavior in a in-character manner?  Did shanties and shacks terrify you as a child?  Are you acting out against your inner clown?  
---
I'm betting you have nothing.  Again, you deflect by saying I never asked you questions, but you put yourself up on the public soapbox and then made yourself look like a douche.  So defend yourself and actually explain your roleplay.  I want to read this.
---
I did not know that.
---
A few minutes after patch someone figured a way around it, posted it on youtube and yeah. XD 
---
What they should do is raise the level cap to 60 then balance the stats so a TSE on an optimal build can’t 1 shot people with pacifist on. 
---
Hated that dude in the movie
---
Everyone is right this is a free Market if you can't can pay 1000 caps for something you looking for another guy for a lower price and sometimes you buy something from another guy for 2K you have to sell it for 3k to have profit I understand all this post coming from duping guys. They can replicate any Item from the game and sell that for a lower price "if they want". What happen with you guys server hoping for hours to get a object
---
Yep, increases weapon damage too.
---
How convenient...
---
No no no, shoot them in the face, and if they fight back, kill them, steal it, and dive off a cliff so they can't get it back. 
---
See, I figure people don't know what they don't know until they play for a while. I planned out my build using Nukes and Dragons, but that was all theorycrafting. I'm just getting into the states where I don't know what other perks to get. I was curious if others are set in their ways, or if people are generally playing around with SPECIAL points and perks for different builds in their later stages of play.
---
Oh so I just have to get the over repair perk
---
Yes. Temporarily. You can increase melee weapon damage and armor resist with 200% repair.
---
Sadly, bad information. I carry 2 sets of Power Armor. A level 50 set of T-60 and excavator. I combat it out in either but generally use the T-60 for Queens. And Excavator for carrying the loot back!
---
I proudly display that everything I'm trading is not duped, and anything I suspect might be duped is heavily discounted and listed as potentially duped
---
Your life
---
That is true, but I run a melee build with maxed strength, all my points are allocated to gladiator, incisor, ninja and whatnot. I could move stuff around but I don’t know if it’s worth it. 
---
Is it the same way as the old way basically?
---
If so you could just stay near their camp and wait for them to drop the loot they want duplicated lol, then snag it
---
Yet I guarantee you have one weapon or armor piece that you traded for.
---
Especially if it's tse it was most certainly duped.
---
Stop being such a hypocrite.
---
99% of the people bitching about dupes have benefited from them in some way
---
Yeah that kind of stuff will really drive you up the wall.
---
What do you use yours for? Honestly I've been scavenging the wasteland and not powerlvling /questing for 90% of my game time and at level 15 I've amassed a ton of scrap etc. but once I hit the 400 cap I just started selling things off to vendors or making weapons and scrapping them to unlock more mods while keeping any "essential junk" in stacks that I'd be able to sustain myself with for repairing armor/creating weapons/mods and I've managed to keep this going throughout. I don't need 50 missiles, so I just dump em, just like the mini nukes or cores (which are absurdly abundant) see if you keep hoarding, then a stack of 1000 will essentially feel like it's not enough, then 1500 etc. It will never be enough because in reality you're gonna be getting a lot more junk than you'll be using throughout the game. 
---
Had them disappear before my eyes before, but then their loot was on another body, like added to the inventory it almost seemed like but I don't think that can happen currently in game
---
wouldn't it be easy for Bethesda to ban these kind of accounts? I seriously doubt that 400k Big Guns bobbleheads have even spawned, let alone been able to be gathered by one level 17.  If they claim to have no way of knowing a duper, this would be a dead giveaway
---
I think thise were just costmetic headgear on suits with no helmet equipped.
---
I do this event whenever I see it. I figured they might be empty because I'm on cooldown for the items to respawn from the last time I did it.
---
Show us his name and get his ass BANNED. 
---
its not power armor
---
and cheating
---
Fuck these people. Don’t even censor their names, let everyone know 
---
Yeah I’ve seen it... big... walks with a Brahmin. Well at least I expect it would had it not been dead every time I see it. I don’t think it’s possible to encounter it live, but I’ve seen it pre-dead maybe 6 times I reckon.
---
My friend basicly one shoted an 80 scorcher as it crawled from its fissure hole with his bloodied melee build. few min after he finished it. I shot it in one wing with my shotty to keep it grounded and a lower lvl person added A pot shot. Rest was him lol! Was epic.
---
I set mine up on the lake bed in the middle of the map. I put my water purifier down and fast traveled away for something. I came back and I hear an explosion. I look down and two muties are walking away from my beaten water purifier looking rather smug. At least they felt dmug till the very end. 
---
I did! I did just rifles no melee well up into the 60s when I got an explosive shotgun and a decent 3 sledge and redid some specials. I'm stocking up on levels for when I finally get a really good legendary drop. I also messed around with mutations and went from herbivore to carnivore and picked up cannibal.
---
I come from a history of two years of CS:GO and TF2 trading. People could duplicate some of the higher stuff early on by faking scams and abusing report tickets, but thankfully valve stopped duping items to preserve the economy. It blows my mind that people pay real money for this, I've seen plenty of high levels who are willing to give out this kind of crap for pretty much free
---
not fixed for me at all. it duplicated my entire camp multiple times less than 2 days ago and i still have a water purifier stuck i can't delete for many many many many moves now.
---
If you mean just having the radio on in game while you play, it COULD come up as a copyright claim just for being there. Publishing companies have algorithms set to look for their music, not necessarily HOW it's being used. That's why you see Oxhorn cutting off radios in his playthroughs. The likelihood of this happening I'd put at 50-50.
---
If you mean using it as background music for playthroughs, I'd see if you could license it somehow to avoid copyright claims. There used to be a company called Limelight that allowed creators such as musicians to license songs for covers and such but I'm not sure they're around anymore. 
---
Either way, it's a beautiful tune and I hope you get to use it!
---
Super Duper (luck) works on it, too. I can get about 20 diluted stimpaks out of 3 regular. 
---
Preach, I literally brown bagged over 100 T-60 Motion Assist Sevos the other week (one stack of over 100).
---
I've got a stack of over 200 maps for the same treasure pile, once I nail down one of my "High Roller" friends we are going to do before and after screenshots (not going to record 90 - 120 minutes of monotonous clicking, that would be stupid) then break down the rarity on a spreadsheet  
---
How long is temporarily, does it go down the lower the durability?
---
you're right. [https://postimg.cc/Cnk13PkD](https://postimg.cc/Cnk13PkD)
---
Why just why???
---
&gt;Both guys always said, throughout the relationship, that I was shit at gaming. It got so bad that I didn't feel comfortable playing in front of either of them, not as a solo or as a co-op, because they'd end up shouting, taking over, or non stop laughing.
---
This is a fairly good red flag test.  If the next guy you end with is the same, lose em.
---
Move your C.A.M.P device somewhere else in your camp and it will change your spawn point.
---
There should be some kind of strike force set up XD
---
Gaming isn't primarily about being good, it's about enjoying yourself.
---
Spooky. Don't tell Markiplier.
---
Even if it’s already in my camp itself?
---
Are you sure? They're soulbound when equipped IRCC. The ones on AH were never equipped.
---
Hey it can be done...
---
"Bethesda has NO solution"
---
I’m willing to make the ammo.  Just wondering if the 10 mm pistol has good enough power
---
Bethesda struggled to upgrade the stash size by 200 due to server stability issues. Then this cunt rolls up with 400000 bobbleheads and over 1million wood.
---
I just don't understand why they don't create more than one alt 
---
You.  I like you.
---
Yep. If you have plenty of mats you can keep topping it up, like sharping your axe on a grinding stone. Keeping your gear in tip top condition. Gonna cost you but worth it if you want the best.
---
That’s just junk though, the real haul is theirs for keeps until Bethesda wipes their inventory.
---
Traveling pharmacy, bandolier, and pack rat all maxed out help tons. You only need 8 points of strength for em. My carry weight stays at about 120 on average and I only carry weapons and armor I use. 
---
&gt; fuck the people paying them real money for this crap
---
This is the real problem.  Well the real problem is it wasn't hot fixed. 
---
I'm having 2 issues -- I can't add anything to my camp despite leveling up 10 times -- I even rebuilt base and still the same -- also when I die, I no longer get the quest \ indicator where my loot is -- just the X of where I died 
---
Heavy attacks?
---
Xbox. Got stuck after launching nuke. Couldn't leave the computer screen. Had to leave server to fix it
---
Still freaks me out everytime i watch it....
---
Not most (I hope)
---
Plenty enough though. 
---
I got my first build complete around 70 then spent all the way to 115-ish changing it around.  VATS Critical to no VATS, 1-handed to 2-handed melee, combat shotgun to heavy weapons, rifle perks remained.
---
^ This. You can only place two down at a time.
---
I’ve had the same thing happen as well, except the bodies immediately reappeared in another spot. Odd. 
---
Good for you. Those guys aren't worth your time. I love that the day you broke up you're like"screw you guys" and went out and bought it. Also I'm always surprised when people say you have to play a certain way...the games are set up for all kinds of play and there's cards and perks for stealth. I'd say they suck if they have to use chems...I just sell them. I was terrible at combat when I started Fallout 4. Now I have one character I play with my boyfriend and others (there are guys that will support you and say good job) and another character that I just explore and catch lore with. It's about enjoying the experience! Big congrats on the Deathclaw! I'm going to try to sneak up and tame one with my solo character one day. I'd join you sometime if you want. We should create an Order of the Mysteries group. :)
---
My man! :D
---
It crashes servers and lags the fuck out of the game? 
---
I mean if you really wanna defend your duping habits try and spell some of the words right in your post.
---
Do it!
---
I watched 6 lvl 40 Glowing Plagued Rad-rats take out 2 lvl 65 Supermutant Warlords and 4 lvl 50 Supermutant Masters. Because they have f\*\*ked up hit boxes. 
---
From what I've found its not uncommon for folks to have a mic, just not use it.  Like a lot of these coop games folks tend to go on-mic if you make reasonable comments and questions.
---
Yes, also lost looting rights and XP from mobs even though I did 90% of the damage. 
---
I've also had legendaries and other mobs just stand up then die when I'm near. The only loot to be had is meat, if any. 
---
Are you on xbox? I’ll sell you a pair for dirt cheap
---
You just edit it and you can move it around anywhere. Every time you move it it will change your spawn position.
---
Thats probably the  faschnacht owl mask
---
Your loss dude
---
Thata super disappointing.
---
Awesome, hope this works! Thanks
---
I can attest this is real and a very serious problem spanning eight weeks currently.
---
You have a good point and basically you are those people farm caps easily because you know can sell stuff to vendors to each get 200 caps so that's good.But buying something for higher price it's not even fair sucks
---
The only weapon I’ve traded for was a 1* furious spear just after the beta. I don’t play with guns as I’m set up for melee, and the only melee weapons I use are spears as I’m playing a tribal. I have 2 that are 3 star, but they’re random finds and not exactly god roll. 
---
Carry on thinking that though guy if it makes your feel like less of a cheat :)
---
Slow down John Seed ✋
---
You won't get a strike, however, your video will probably be monetized by the owner, or someone claiming to be the owner, of the music. 
---
No strike against you; however it may hamper the growth of your channel because ads suck and you're a nobody so why am I going to sit through this ad sort of thing.
---
Yeah I had to move mine before as it would constantly spawn be pinned between two logs in a pond 
---
I've never had the base armour plans :D I've just bought them or got them as legendaries, and then applied the mods.
---
Others have said that the plans are provided by doing the free states quest lines? I haven't done these yet, so can't verify sorry.
---
What is your ig name?\`MrClavicus?
---
It’s a glitch leaving and rejoining boost your carry by 100 and it also charges your core to 100% if you are in the armor 
---
Ya, assuming the rats stay pacified until you attack. My brother and I just ended up killing them all.
---
In order to duplicate, you force a server crash. Kicks off everyone. 
---
Is that your bank statement from that? If so venmo me like $50 bucks and I'll give you 100 supply requisitions a TSE gauss rifle also some prime plans haha that is if you are the guy from ebay
---
Absolutely.
---
Had a problem with plastic for a bit, run Watoga high school a few times, go through the area straight back through the lobby and grab all the plastic plates and silverware. Usually they’re  in a place setting on the table but don’t forget to look on the floor, I always find forks on the floor. Also check the kitchen, and the little staircase up through the kitchen that leads to another dining area. 86-100 plastic a run. All my shit is repaired with orange and black Halloween plates and forks. It’s absolutely ridiculous, but I guess no more ridiculous then repairing with golf balls either. 
---
Hmmm I have to try that. I’ve been doing it at Emmett Mountain Disposal. Got shower right there and barrels that seem to be doing 15-20 rads per second.
---
O they are more than happy to message you privately on reddit and tell you they don't give a shit about the game or the community.
---
Don't worry they will block you before you can even reply....
---
How... nice 😆 well, as long as I don’t have to fast travel twice I’ll be fine.
---
If we are talking about realism I could make fucking soup with purified water. 
---
Hey, sent you a PM, could you check it out? Oh and I've also added you in-game, assuming your IGN is the same as your Reddit one.
---
Screw those guus for talking down to you like that. Egotistical pricks
---
Off topic but, Man, you give me hope. I am half your age and with your speech patterns &amp; vernacular usage I would have never guessed your age without your admission. People give me crap for gaming at my age. They just don't get it.  I will never give them up, especially a good RPG.
---
#gamerForLife
---
no?! fuck hole cheaters are making the game bad? well i never would have guessed that. 
---
Bro you sound dumb 🤦🏾‍♂️ All he said was give him the bullets instead of throwing them away... That’s it. 
---
Its why these posts are important i still always keep this link ready on here.
---
Constant reminders that they must do something about it.
---
I have one T-60 calibrated shock mod. Will sell for a minimum of 1,000 caps. Yes I’m a greedy capitalist...  :)
---
Username: bmack500
---
Can u explain why is that?
---
If you get a two shot or explosive... Or a 2 shot explosive
---
I believe deathclaw requires both, but I'm not sure if anyone's tried it with just one of them.
---
Hate this , another issue is when corpses won’t yield any loot.
---
Imagine realizing you spent half of your supplies and got nothing other then good ole exp 
---
I have both Fix it Good and Weapon Artisan. Yes, Fix it Good raises the resistances while it's greater than 100% condition. No, Weapon Artisan doesn't raise damage. 
---
can you show us the name though? asshole should be banned/reported. at the very least. 
---
I feel like fusion cores were the reason my stash was always full early game. I do float around 50 in my inventory now because of it at least, plus with batteries included the weight of all of them is only 1.5lbs.
---
The lowest level scorchbeast can be is 50 
---
You play however you want. That’s what makes the game fun. 
---
IIRC you have to have pain train lv3 for it to work 
---
Mine seem to bug to where they just fuck off if I am managing to kill them.Get them down to half health or less and they fly away.
---
That happens?! Jesus I've been struggling forever to find good weapons. 
---
This would be my first launch, yes. 
---
If you go sneak, at late game you can easily swap between rifleman and commando as you have ammo to spend, and sneak attacks will continue for each hit while you're in [Caution] or [Hidden] regardless of your weapon type. This makes sneak commando really effective against low perception hostiles, and even against Bravo's.
---
Once you get Sneak 3 you won't have any problems with Super Mutants, they will run right towards you but not actually see you until they bump into you. 
---
If you're doing rifles, sneak is the cheapest perk points to spend on tanking.
---
How do u get it
---
Currently taking points out of perception to put in other stats, really not much use for it with heavy weapons.
---
I either speak to them or punch them in the face.  
---
Dude, same. 
---
I have all suits of armor. Excavator is used 99% of the time. Been through many hours and several WSR nukes and SBQ runs and haven't had to repair it yet.  
---
Also using perks to help this.
---
I forgot, if you're in a team you can also respawn at a teammate's location. 
---
Yeah I caught some dupers once, but they saw me and logged off. Next time I find some gonna try and sneak to them then run snag the legendary they're duping. Chameleon!
---
Sometimes I dress up like a cop and hassle people about using chems. Want me to follow him around?
---
They stated that increased stash space was a problem they were facing due to technical limitations, which tells me that earnable stash space through questing would be perfect. 
---
That way, only the more dedicated and committed players will be getting it. This way, they aren't placing unnecessary load on their servers. The extra space goes to those who earned it. 
---
Maybe next time post before you launch...not when there's &lt;10mins left and you barely made a dent.  Waste of resources.
---
I wonder if the devs were smart enough to take into account for supply/demand, so maybe if you sold bulked adhesive to vendors you'd get some basically free caps.
---
Isn't it Purified Water, not Boiled Water?
---
Either way, it's a great tip.  :-)
---
I said 99%... Not 100%.
---
Notice everyone on feeds buying tse guns and 3* god roll melee. 
---
Acting this self-righteous and douchey is just as bad.
---
Btw the weapon I use the most is a 2* instigating, speed spear I got legitimately.
---
Don't talk down on people who want to play differently from you
---
Also, I don't have a mic. If we're all on a team does it matter who launches?
---
They have some issues to work out. My GF and I have a blast with this game. She may not have amazing aiming but she kicks as much butt as me pretty much. 
---
Thank you for asking. I'll gladly share. All of the below text will be said from the character.
---
My name is Samanta. My parents died when I was 2, no idea how. Raised by my aunt Margie. She was a strongly independent woman and didnt take no shit from anyone. I guess that's where I get it from. She got us in the vault but sadly passed away in the before reclamation day.
---
Once out in this world I've heard stories and stories about it became very apparent I know nothing about life outside the vault. For weeks I wandered, exploring the terrain until finally I found her. Rose, she was a raider, and it sounded exactly like the life I wanted to live. I set up my personal camp in the southern shadow of Top of the World. Then began my self training in the ways of being a raider. 
---
I started small with taking crops and purified water I found unlocked in their camps. Eventually moving onto out right attacking anyone that came near my camp. After a while that just wasnt enough for me anymore, I needed a real rush. So after a conversation with Rose and her direction I set out. She suggested I try a little home invasion, and if there was a locked door, make it so there is no door. 
---
That's where I find myself today. A self proclaimed solo raider wandering Appalachia. I kill for the fun and steal to survive. I feel like for the first time in my life I have a purpose. 
---
I use the stash for junk/scrap items very often. I go out, get junk items. Fast travel home and break them down into base components. Go to my tool bench and bulk as much as I can. Then redeposit them into my stash. That way I can fast travel to any railway vendor and take bulk items out to sell when I need them. Overall, I would say that 3/4 of my stash limit is stored junk items, base components, or bulked components.
---
With reputation? Actual proof of other trades and thousands of recorded transactions? 
---
But yeah... Assume first then make accusations based on your idiotic baseless accusations. You're an idiot. 
---

They sell it for real money on several websites dedicated to it, cap sellers and even Ebay. Worse on Ebay you can see how many the seller as sold of each item it is depressing so many buy them..

Stingwing filet gives str also

Random number generation, basically how you luck it going.
---
I never liked commando in fallout because of the ammo consumption plus I like dmr types because of the control gauss has been my all time fav weapon in fallout but I never understood why u can't choose a sneak crit vats riflemen
---
I had this problem once, and I traced it to the fact that I was standing inside the repair area.  I moved my CAMP device away to an empty area, and then repaired without crashing.
---
I added you, if your name is MrClavicus ofcourse
---
WAIT WHAT I DIED MULTIPLE TIMES TO MINES EXPLODING IN MY FACE WHEN MAKING A NICE PILE, :(
---
Cool.   I can come up with 4k. I'm close right now.
---
Maybe by next year one of those will drop lol!
---
I was so happy when my girlfriend said she would game with me, I bought her a PS4 so we could play together
---
I dont think its in game yet, there were i think 7 faschnacht masks only the clown one is in game atm
---
Old timer complaining. Go figure, I'll see you around whitesprings with your walker.
---
Rust was a great example. 
---
That probably is gonna work but probably produce bugs on the stash box or but I'm Agree
---
Mageweave were never BOA or BOE as far and I can remember and you could give them to alts or other people after you out grew they with Neatherweave (which were BOA/BOE). 
---
It’s been so long ago its hard for me to remember. 
---
I do have the picture in the text message from my buddy showing it for whatever that is worth. 
---
You say that like crickets aren't some demonic hell beast that shrugs off nukes...
---
This type of thinking is really fucked up.....
---
Do you not want this ONLINE game to thrive for years to come hmmm?....
---
Player trader , pvp , server stability even fkn PVE is effected....
---
Think first and enjoy your downvotes.

It potentially can be. It's a loading screen tip.

But yeah, not everyone knows this, and it's useful information for new players!
---
IMO, the fastest steel you will find in this game is the Uranium Fever event + Scrapper perk.
---
There's a table RIGHT THERE, most molemen drop multiple junk and a shotgun that all scraps to steel, and they just keep coming for 10ish minutes.
---
I'm level 119 and I still only use diluted stimpacks. I have 200 in my stash, 50 on me at all times, and plenty to hand out to those new to the wasteland 👍
---
If someone is weighting 140,000 pounds, he should get flagged for extreme exploiting.
---
Considering I've gone through the quest at the hornwright building for the ID, quite a bit.  Uranium, Black Titanium, aluminum, iron, and an alright haul of junk when you count the scrap from the dead mole miners.  The top couple rows are hard to get unless you have marsupial and/or a PA jetpack.  Otherwise youre stuck jumping and grabbing like a 5 year old getting ceral off the top of the fridge.

You mean folks who want to bypass the game mechanics in a multiplayer game and get an unfair advantage over people who choose to play legitimately? If you play legitimately I’m not sure why you’re crying? 
---
Most of the World Objects have a storage limit now as of two patches ago, usually 1-3 items.  So... yeah...  
---
Then it’s better if i do it now that i still can, right?
---
this is fine (c)
---
They need to make it so that if you damage their wings enough, they can't keep flying all the time. If you cause too much damage to their head, they can't use sonic attacks so much. The same way it has been in every other Fallout game since Fallout 3. 
---
It's nothing more than a method to force players to buy atoms.
---
If you're on PC and want a free nuke grenade plan, let me know.

Everyone in here talking about the owl mask and I'm just wondering where the winterized paint for the T-51 came from
---
its one thing to have a 2-3 tse's you paid thousands of caps for that may or may not have been duped. its entirely another things to be flipping a dozens or more tse's for profit you know are duped. don't be coy. 
---
Yeah, i literally had no clue what i was doing until i hit 40 and my buddy showed me N&amp;D's calculator.  I wasn't too far off.  Only took me 30 levels to rearrange SPECIAL and get the perks I wanted.
---
STASH expansion module?  Or Stash'em for short?
---
Had a 2 shot 25% faster fire rate I sold the other day from grinding reg golf house, it'll drop
---
Don't lie, 90% of you just can't get it to work, that's why you're bitching. Lmao.
---
Ok, old guy here, and this is my first dance on any kind of online game (but not a Fallout virgin). I don’t need step by step directions, but can someone tell me what’s going on with this duping thing, other than the obvious connotation by calling it ‘duping’. How are they doing it? What can I be on the lookout for to see if its happening near me? 
---
There it is, I was thinking of netherweave. It's been so long... That's my bad there.
---
I have one now, it does about 219 Damage. To me, it's not worth using in anything beyond reaaaally weak enemies. 
---
Thanks for helping, everyone!
---
Now imagine this happening to you with the scorch queen 
---
Had the same... Shoot a couple of enemies and wanted to loot them. Recognized a car burning next to them. Could grab some stuff and had to run for cover when the car exploded. The corpses were all gone after the detonation. 
---
I bet you that he isn’t going to reply back 
---
You mean folks who took advantage of something that's been in the game for 2 months. Doesn't seem like hacking or cheating to me.. And advantage? Everyone I run into has a tse.
---
You're crazy to think most people aren't doing this
---
Nice! 
---
I think you they can craft a ton of anything though it’s just that leather armor or whatever is the easiest. So it might just start happening with steel or whatever the next cheapest thing is to craft 
---
Cool. Now keep hammering away at Bethesda until they implement this across all platforms. 
---
I am too low level to kill them, but I will walk up and shoot them in the face, so they know, that i know, that they know, that i know, if you know what I mean.
---
My camp is built on a slope of some cliffs, about 90% of the time I fast travel to it, i fall through the world (which is inverted, so I fall up) then about 5 seconds later I land in the same spot. It's actually my favorite thing about my current location. 
---
Hey sneak damage rocks, made make a character all about sneaking. 
---
It was just the one, might do more later.
---
You can try equipping a miner's hat, it throws a spotlight you can use it to point out the bag.
---
No it isn't, things that are common are not desirable, if everyone has one that's not what people want, they want what only a few have. This is how that's achieved....
---
Sure 
---
Respect because I've been playing casually since launch and I still havent been able to one on one a Scorchbeast??
---
Then, most people are cheating, don’t you think? 
---
😂 glad to hear
---
Still benefiting from duping. Which you insist to be infallibility wrong. So no difference in the two
---
nice try Punisher
---
That was very shitty of both of your partners, but just know it took me and 3 other of my friends to kill a lvl 40 scorchbeast, while dying more that 20 times in the process. We were leveled 15-27 and it took us 40 minutes! Congrats 
---
I want it add me @ soggyest 
---
They dont need to randomize some of the spawns more than they do already. The reason why the forest doesnt have much i the way of level variations is because its the beginning area, thus low level area.
---
Getting into Ash heap and Toxic valley increases levels, and then finally Savage Divide, Mire, and the Bog all have max level caps. Its based on normal estimated playthrough progression. Last thing I need is to go to morgantown with my level 13 alt and have to fight a randomly spawned group of 50+ muties.
---
Way to go. Jus play however you want to.
---
What's wrong with that?
---
your doing gods work
---
you must get reworded!
---
I was level 115 before I started the main quest line. I still haven't launched a nuke. It shouldn't matter what or how you play games.

These ex's are stupid for losing a relationship over something that should have brought you closer.

Won’t be the first time a game has had a database wipe and surely won’t be the last.
---
This would be pointless unless they can 100% fix the duping but judging by how the server sends/receives information that’s looking like a bit of an ask.
---
BGS would need to either increase the save timer upon DC/Crash from 15 minutes to 30 so they loss whatever they tried to dupe as a counter-measure, aswell as preventing the item storage in containers. We loot from the world, not store in it to be fair.
---
I have the same issue, playing on PS4
---
Have heard of Rust a few times, but have never looked into it or played it.  My understanding is it's similar, and apparently superior to Ark, which I have played.  But as far as I recall, you were limited to your undies as far as nudity goes on Ark.
---
I have a mutants bowie knife with +40 swing speed that does 133/stab. It's fucking awesome walking into a nuke zone with a knife and just fucking stabbing everything in a flurry. I feel like that stabby robot from Futurama. 
---
did they say if Limited items will ever cycle back or return?
---
It really is. Especially with thing like paints. I'll buy 1 PA paint, then they'll release a new limited one with no way to get that amount of atoms without buying them, which I refuse to do
---
Yeah I have a mic but I'm mostly sticking to myself. But I have talked to a couple people. I just prefer not to lol
---
No lol.. At this point duping is pretty equivalent to white spring nuke xp farming. Been in the game just as long and is the smartest use of resources and time.
---
There are so many ways to get atoms in game there doesn't seem to be any good reason to spend real money on it. Buying atoms is just for those folks that have an impulse to collect everything.
---
I noticed that today it seemed a bit odd; but I would check your background tasks. Are you watching youtube or doing something else?
---
Thing is I didn't even know they were duping. They were on corner map in toxic wastes, thought they had a camp and wanted to see it. Kinda bummed me out when they were just cheating, now I'm on the lookout when the server gets laggy
---

sadly NO

Any more than what’s already been bitched about the past month? Did it suddenly get worse?

Wow... so immersive

What a cute mask. Are you going to share where you/they found or no?

You can't just post cute owls without telling the people where to find cute owls.

That's wonderful of you!

Might want to kiss her goodbye for a few days. For me, those specific games absolutely hijack the addiction centers in my brain. I ran on no sleep for like 2 weeks, and cut waaay back on smoking.

Go outside for a smoke, or crawl this dungeon? Dungeon won *a lot* of those battles.

Or a vending machine that only sells Pork n' BEANS
---
Does the handy blade benefit from slugger? When I use it in 3rd person it looks like I'm only using 1 hand to hold it, so I've been equipping the gladiator perks when I'm using it. 
---
There need to be Passive Perk Cards and Active Perk Cards. Passive Perk Cards will enhance the game but don't have to be equipped. The cards for this post need to be Passive cards. While cards like Slugger, Heavy Gunner, etc need to be Active Perk Cards.
---
Weakness disgusts me.
---
Also I’d like to add that I was getting mutations consistently until I got Healing Hands and kept it. After that I’ve yet to get another mutation. It was the only mutation I kept and then tried getting more.
---
It's all about visibility, so thanks for commenting!
---
I’m like, “I already did this twice. You guys should know who I am by now!” Lol
---
Fuck this pmo. I wonder how many times the server lagged when I was playing cause of this 
---
Sure you do. If I accuse you of being toxic, you play the saint. Your comments make it clear your just here to argue and defend toxic game play. Why not just own it? 
---
Mole Miners are in Lewisburg
---
The Breach and Clear even it great both for finding mole miners and for obtaining black titanium.
---
Okay, well have fun cheater. 
---
Play the game how you want! Be a critical sneak sniper, only thing that matter is that you have fun.
---
Somewhat buggy is an understatement lol 🤣.
---
You know that you will eventually only get atoms by grinding the daily and weekly challenges. You won't keep up with Bethesda's exclusive offers with the rate of atoms you recieve.
---
Happened to me with the SBQ yesterday.
---
Yeeeeah 
---
Worth it 
---
If u put on passivemose they cant be killed by players
---
You can get 5-6 Black Titanium from each Deathclaw you kill as well, the one on Deathclaw Island is a good one to farm if you have a long range weapon.
---
Hasn't yet, though the last time I killed her she dropped nothing.
---
Thanks I'll check.   Scored a few bowling balls and many pins at the freak show location 2 days ago.  That was a nice bolster.  Chucked explosives on the 2 mirelurk queens from the top of the ridge.
---
Deathclaws on Deathclaw island north of point pleasant for black titanium. Kill, collect , server hop and profit.  
---
Awh, man. I wish. I'm chained to Xbox unfortunately. Do not have the space in my tiny bay area apartment for a desk or desktop computer :(
---
When the truck manufacturers are all powerful Gods that shape the very fabric of the reality the truck exits in, I do blame the truck manufacturers.
---
Bethesda made and controls the very space this glitch exists in.
---
Fuck those guys. Youre a God gamer in my opinion 
---
My friends and I are in the low 50s and if you ever wanted to play youre more then welcome to come sneak around with us if we play. We dont really sneak around but being in a party gives more xp. (PC btw)

Just pm if youre ever down

And good luck in the wasteland

The beer hat of course
---
I won't spread the exact details on how to do it, but here's how it works in online games in general:
---
Your character isn't constantly saved.  It's saved under certain conditions.  Most notably, when logging out, and every X minutes/seconds.  How duping works is you trade one of your items to another character/something else then crash either yourself or the server before the scheduled save comes up.
---
Your character thus reverts to the previous save when you log in(ie before you moved the item off of your character).  You still have the item.  The other character/thing ALSO still has that item though, as they didn't crash.
---
The methods involved in crashing yourself/the server vary from game to game.  And they tend to have serious impacts on the other players as well(lag, disconnections, character rollbacks).  The players that do it are undoubtedly cheating, and being quite selfish in the process.
---
TSE is the best combo at the moment and I hope bethesda is close to finding a genuine fix to these dupes not just giving us "addressing the duplicate" excuse.  Once the glitch has been fixed, they might add more legendary mods.  I'm hoping for a stacking bleeding effect.
---
Pistols generally aren’t worth it. There are no perks giving armor penetration so they are innately at a disadvantage. Only good if you want to gunslinger-style kill squishy mobs and do nothing against higher level ones.
---
Power! I also was forced to begin hiding my gaming from the person I was with, due to disrespect, so your story is very heartening. it’s what made me realize the sphere of connection we had was a very small object, not a large life changing forever connection. 
---
I just did SB queen event a few minutes ago.  I  only got the one automatic award item for event, nothing from corpse.   There were about a dozen people there.  I was probably about the 10th to take a look at corpse and it was empty.   So either everything went to the first couple of people to check corpse or maybe nobody got anything.   I have done event before and there was loot (legendaries, prime plans, etc).  or it is still not fixed. 
---
Please tell me your on xbox. I would like to show you that your not as trash as you think. 
---
Nothing wrong with playing that way, those mechanics are there for people like us! I personally am a lore obsessed loot goblin, all my buddies spend their time grinding in workshops and horde events and then wonder how I’m 5 levels above them with a ton of screws, gears, and springs.
---
r/copypasta
---
I play the same, was over 130 before I started and finished most of the main quests.  The one I did finish asap was the enclave so I could get into its bunker to sale items and get the X-01 PA, pick my battles and sneak away if its not to my liking.  Im still exploring place and finding things I missed the first few times I visited a location.  If Im with a friend who likes to run in, so be it, I let him/her while I hang back :-)
---
It gives +100 carry weight, so it is handy to have for a lot of things. It doesn't have the best stats, but it is good enough for any of the content... really any power armor will be fine. X-01 has the best rad resist, T-51 Has the best damage resist, T-60 and Ultracite are sort of in-between. The mods you use  make more of a difference than anything.
---
 Because they are not individual items, it is one item followed by some numbers. It's the individual items that have stats and conditions that have to be tracked that cause server strains. 
---
  So a stack of 1,000,000 bobble heads is the same as one bobble head. But each armor or weapon (items that don't stack) each have to be tracked separately so 1,000,000 TSE handmades is 1,000,000 different items being track on that one specific character. 
---
I got on like it too
---
As a couple others have stated.. come join
---
I am a 48 yr old male.. and i use vats alot cause my aim/reaction time is shit.. i mainly sneak and shoot from a distance when possible. So my play styles alot like yours. Never worried about min/max'n anything just here to have fun and play with like minded people.
---
My opinion you ex's were stepping on you to make themselves feel superior.. screw 'em ya better off without em.
---
If ya on ps4 hit me up: Silune
---
Youre more than welcome to come join a bunch of other filthy casuals, although the one girl in our group i will warn ya is a lil weird.. kneecappin ghouls and then 10mm em to the back of the head, or running around in a clown suit scaring noobs.. if ya can get past her weirdness ya more than welcome to explore with us.
---
Yeah her two ex's are just shit people
---
&gt; I see why you scratched the name so others won't get the incentive to seek this person out, especially with their devious acts.
---
The post would be removed if he didn't, rule #9
---
I love that you play "shit" as that's my playstyle to a tee. Even now, at level 89, I have two very powerful weapons and still sneak and creep everywhere. The only times I use chems are when they'll give me just enough strength to fast travel to a vendor to unload my goodies. 
---
About 200 caps from vendor?
---
im  200ish lvl
---
thought I've  done every thing in the game and was kinda bummed out 
---
and then cam the duppers 
---
and game got fun again XD
---
My everyday roaming around build is a sneak crit sniper no PA. In nuke zones I'm a heavy gunner in PA.  I was able to make sure that I could fit in both builds with my SPECIAL stats. 
---
You're not wrong, I don't understand why you're being downvoted. 
---
For the record, fuck the dupers.
---
Im finding the same :( its probably people duping again, ruining everybodys fun 
---
I have an ex like hers, he's super competitive and nasty at me for not being like him. So it happens. It sucks.
---
Yep, got some meds and a funny story up there
---
I'm also a slow leveler. On PC as diaphoni.
---
Stupid? It's for farming nuked ghouls where they're usually at their highest concentration. It's likely very effective. You just need to tag everything before it dies.
---
That's bittersweet.  I am sorry for your loss.  :-(
---
It's immersive if you're RPing as Mister Fantadtic. 
---
Wasn't there a challenge of 'take a picture with a group in the nude'? Something like that. 
---
can’t play right now but that’s really nice^
---
The owls are not what they seem...
---
Just finished, took me like 10 minutes just to find it, then five to do it. It's not really anything special, I found a couple Meds, a Note, and a Bobblehead. 
---
Eliminate or limit?
---
Im 165, and ive had fun switching around to keep the game interesting
---
I'm a level 10 (I think) on Xbox, so if you ever want to team up, I'm free.
---
(I'm not the guy you're replying to btw)
---
Do you have a source for this? 
---
Yeah, havent sold em yet, sitting on my second char.
---
You can farm springs from white springs. The ghouls drop pocket watches and flip lighters. I've gathered the most springs there out of anywhere else I've been, plus it is a good place to level up. The only issue is you have to scrap everything quite often at lower levels because of weight.
---
Yeah for the most part you only need Animal Friend, though I’ve heard Deathclaws (and possibly Gulpers) require Wasteland Whisperer as well, dunno if that was confirmed or not
---
Black Titanium is not rare at all, just go hunt Mole Miners for a few hours and you'll be swimming in Titanium. Just go to the Blackwater Mine, clear the outside and inside, scrap the drops, switch servers then repeat.
---
I have loads of fun with them until I've been out walking and forget that i have that equipped and not my .50 cal and blow myself up point blank because I wanted to mow down that mutant hound with automatic fire
---

I'm horrible at video games (especially combat) but I love good stories and lore which naturally draw me to games like this. Screw those idiots who talk down to you or laugh at you. YOU DO YOU GURL. Have fun in whatever way you please because at the end of the day that's what video games are about. Also, I know for a fact that there are plenty of people out there willing to play with you and still enjoy themselves. 
---
I personally stand in the back while my friends kill things and then I stimpack and feed everyone lol. They guard me while I read through terminals and notes or listen to holo tapes and I give them the "short version" because some of them just want the cliff notes lol. This is the kind of game where you really should play however you like and I'm sure you could find people to play with here on reddit or on discord etc.!
---
I'm so proud that you were able to purchase the game after your breakup and kill your own scorchbeast! You're so brave ♥ Keep doing you, mama!
---
Zenimax Media is the parent company.  Bethesda and Zenimax Online are two of their dev studios. 
---
Right? If they spent four hours of duping, and that's the equivalent of 19 dupes (I don't actually know the specifics or how to do it, just using your numbers) that means that they crashed 19 servers right? But even half of what this player is carrying would still be excessive. Dude could have saved two hours of his time and ~9 server crashes that screwed other people. It seems legitimately crazy to continue doing it to the extent they have. 
---
I agree, was just chatting with a user on the fo76bazaar channel, was wanting a 2 shot only handmade and offered 1500 caps, he asked for 15$ paypal, Its going to be a cold day in hell before I pay anyone real $$ for an item in the game.   I would have paid him the caps.
---
That actually sounds amazing! I'm packing up for the night bc my server just crashed but I'll hit you guys up sometime!
---
I’m a bit the same, I’ve found that fast traveling to one of the safe spaces if I just need to duck out for a minute helps me a lot. Early game I’d go to the responders church in Flatwoods, and now later in the game I go to the shops in white spring hotel if I want truly enemy free crafting time
---
Again, for people who feel the need to buy every limited item that comes through the shop, sure, spend cash. But the game doesn't demand it and offers plenty of atoms for the average player to get several limited items without effort and without spending a dime. Much better than games that offer no in-game way to earn premium content.
---
&gt;We were farming the other day and eventually they just stopped. Like 8 or 9 waves but yeah. Finally nothing more came
---
Create a team. Have a teammate log out and then rejoin the team. A "new" player entering the area will usually cause all the ghouls to respawn.
---
Rinse and repeat as needed. Also, glowing dudes continue to spawn for at least 30 minutes after the bomb clears, so don't abandon the area just because the mushroom cloud is gone. 
---
I sell mine too. The thirst mechanic is bad enough without adding chem side effects in
---
No limitate, duh. 
---
i met this guy a couple weeks ago at this camp. was starting my alt and me and a buddy stumbled into him. he had all the instruments out on his deck and we played a little before we left. good times
---
Install a mod that makes those things glow, don't craft anything for a few days, have 300 plus screws. 
---
"You don't know what you have, until it's gone."
---
It's going to hurt, and it might not ever stop hurting. Just remember that this is part of life. Death is inevitable, so we must embrace it when it comes. 
---
Proudly a filthy casual girl!
---
Sorry. PS4!
---
warehouse walls?
---
Congrats. Dudes are idiots. Had a girl that actually wanted to game with them and ruined it. 
---
I play that way too.  Sneak and explore. Rushing around Leroy Jenkins-ing everywhere seems like a shit way to play to me. 
---
5 min? I couldn’t stand the idea of jumping through the one line logs. Let alone the one pole logs after that. 
---
As a gamer of 25 years myself (not 25 years old) and someone whom works at a nursing home. I don't care. Play the game or play a different game. This is an online MMO in the fallout universe. There is pacifist mode for a reason. All thes  "PvPers are ruining the game" post are older than *fill I the blank*
---
This comment probably doesnt help but I also have issues using power armor stations where I attempt to craft or repair and it essentially drops my armor and I cannot use the crafting station so I have to pick my armor up again. Pretty annoying and all my armor is getting low on hit points.
---
If you're looking for bikes, travel to Whitesprings station and then serve hop a few times.
---
Alternatively, launch one yourself. 
---
My friend bought them from the watoga bot vender(not the station)
---
Ok,found it. It's called Beckwith Farm. It's, on the map, the little house that's south of Top of The World.
---
There's not a whole lot of resources, but it has a beautiful view, water, a Weapons Workbench, and isolation. But it's also close enough to the station. And centrally located.
---
Is that what they are called? Any idea where I might find them?
---
They're sure fun, but due to the flight time even super mutants are gone before you hit what you aimed at....
---
Could have the heavy version. It's better than the normal heavy armour
---
Looks like that
---
I am just working on multiple builds I feel that gives fallout the replayability it had I am in the process of finishing my riflemen and working on a gunslinger who actually does work in suprised it's not use that often it clear mobs very well.
---
PVP at the highest level is a frenzy of who can make the other stagger first to actually be able to do any meaningful damage. 
---
Mic area hey take this bag 
---
You gaming ability seems fine.  Might need to work on your test in men, tho.
---
Fallout, probably more then anything, is to be played how YOU want.
---
Grats on the Sierra Bravo kill and good luck on finding your nerd prince. 
---
Thanks!!
---
Sadly no, or at least not at the moment. The only build plans are the ones visible in the build menu whether locked or unlocked.
---
Wear the cop hat and patrolman's sunglasses. I was already rocking that with my vault tec armor. Let them know what we're there for.
---
I like you too!

Black Cowboy hat.

Domt think people enjoy leaving your server it's been a long wait

Thats not Roleplaying, your just been a right cunt to people.

I was a casual button smasher before my SO introduced me to Oblivion

I've been playing since 10/13 - I've earned it! :D
---
Oh ok thankyou ill have to try it!
---
You play like I do. Take our time, explore and enjoy everything. Your ex's sound like the people I hate gaming with. Good job for you! Hope you continue to enjoy the Wasteland.

I had my camp over at the overseer’s camp helping out the low levels by giving them some stimpaks and purified water that I was producing immensely. One time, while I was at a workshop setting up some water purifiers to sell, I get a notification that my camp was under attack. I check the map and I see that a level 10 (Who was one of those people with X’s and “69” in his gamertag), who was wanted for 5 caps was there. I shrugged off the message and continued building at the workshop. 
---
I check again at my camp and the guy was wanted for 30 caps, This had catches my attention. I then fast travelled to find that three of my walls were destroyed (luckily, my fusion generator and everything else was still there) and the guy was outside the door. He noticed me and ran off a short distance away while I did a thumbs down. Then, they started shooting with their automatic pipe weapon and ran off to the Slocum’s Joe. 
---
I repaired the damage he did, and I stayed at my camp with my combat shotgun to make sure he wouldn’t come back (I did not go after him as I am more of a pacifist and I already had hundreds of caps). Minutes go by and the guy leaves the server, goes to the Xbox homepage, and goes offline. 
---
If there is indeed more toxic players coming into the game, then I guess I’ll get prepared. 
---
Dont judge me
---
“...some men aren't looking for anything logical, like XP. They can't be bought with caps, griefed, traded, or teamed up with. Some men just want to explore every nook and cranny of the world and soak in the lore and little teddy bear dioramas 
---
Sounds right
---
found 2 , West of the Chicken icon South of Overseer's camp. As soon as you see them shoot to kill, else you'll have to search around since they seem to have Warp engine :D
---
On the main menu go to your character should be above atomic shop and when you see your character name it displays time played. If you have multiple add them all up.
---
But they are. I can see them. Just never find the plans.
---
Lol what system are you on? Please say xb. I play like that too (in terms of sneaking around and picking enemies off with a suppressed rifle). I would not laugh and make fun of you.

Also, the event ends with the announcement from Responders (as I'm racing to the shaft exit) that there are mole rats in Charleston church, but that event doesn't show on the map, and I don't seen how the two correlate to one another.
---
It's also might just be because of your PC.
---
Are you on xbox? If so you are more than welcome to join me amd my group. We are mostly older as well.
---
Also, my exes would try to explain things like I was 10. Some people don't understand that failing and retrying is a perfectly good way of learning!
---
It turns out that all the glitches we experience, especially those that get us killed, are bugs in the simulation.
---
You need more up votes.
---
I just tamed a Deathclaw last night with only animal friend 3. It hasn't shown up at my CAMP yet, but the tame prompt came up and I sent him to my CAMP to replace my previous pet.
---
I think 1000-1500 is enough
---
[removed] to you too!
---
Sounds quite nice I personally run power armor. So I'm sure that nerfs me a bit since I can't wear the unyielding armor. 
---
And people want player vending, what's the point ?
---
this is how i play low and slow. i carry the mining power armor with me at all times (but i do own 4 sets fully repaired) just in case i need to fast travel and im to heavy.  
---
Eh, 65. I'm pretty sure the Fallout universe is one where America didn't sell out it's economy to the Chinese, lol.
---
Is that how melee pvp is? Me (lvl 98) and another dude (99) were both sniper builds with explosive LARs. We were sneaking around the forest finding eachother and seeking revenge. It was pretty fun, considering it was night time on top of all that. 
---
This is the same problem as the issue with the Atom Store - people reward the bad behaviour so it persists. If we didn't support it, it'd be less of an issue.
---
I know I'm complaining about people being humans but still. Some of us are real stupid or just don't give any F's and want their shit now, regardless of the costs.
---
Hopefully Bethesda sorts this shit out in the near future or at least before they open up more gameplay features like unrestricted PvP or player vending.
---
“I swear next duper I see, I will hunt you down and gut you like a fish!”
---
I haven't visited white springs yet, I'm looking forward to checking it out. And yes the responders church is the calmest place I've found to hide in, when the farm robots aren't causing a ruckus. It's a bit boring though, I've looked at everything in there several times over. 
---
Keep an eye out for “wind instruments” plan, I thought it was wind chimes but it’s a tuba
---
So you can tell me how my imagination works? And yes, raiders are cunts that want you dead. You and Dixie can post till you're blue in the face. I'll do whatever the game allows. There is literally a perk card to do more damage to other peoples camps. Why would a card like that be in the game if Betheada didnt want me to attack camps?
---
Pooping Fligs?
---
Inb4 "pacifist means you cant do damage to others, not vice versa" that comes up every time someone suggests it...
---
I'm 91,and for the last 10 levels or so, I've been gathering perks and swapping special points to try out mutations. I need one more point swapped from charisma into luck to be able to hook up Starched Genes and Class Freak. 
---
Read some of the other comments I thought you were talking about walls from static buildings not walls of camps. I think grahm and the watoga robot carry the metal ones? I got mine as a random drop.
---
But did you Google it? LMAO. Sorry I couldn't help myself. I have been hunting it as well with no luck so far. Hopefully someone gives us some pointers. 
---
Man, this made me so happy. I get a lot flak from people online for being bad at most games. What they don't know is I have Cerebral Palsy (neurological disorder.)  I have delays with hand-eye coordination. I don't feel, the need to explain myself. It feels so good when I win the odd game.
---
I got them from capturing and defending workshops, they can be bought from various vendors as well seen it at harpers ferry vendor
---
I actually was choosing music the other day while playing to set the mood, through Alexa (So out loud.. ) Forgot I was mic-ed up. Anyone in hearing distance would have heard me searching through the wicked soundtrack 🙈
---
They don't crash the server, they crash their own game. It absolutely causes a ton of instability for the server in the process, but it doesn't crash, at least not immediately. I keep seeing people say that every server crash is caused by dupers and, while many are their fault, saying that it's solely on the dupers just flat out wrong; sometimes shit just fails on Bethesda's end.
---
That’s perfect!  
---
Old fisherman hat in my opinion matches with the same style and color. Otherwise the green or wool fisherman’s cap (gray or green) matches pretty well.
---
The fix treated the symptom, not the disease.  If they quick fix the new method, odds are another one will come up fairly quickly.
---
It's going to take some engineering changes to truly root it out.
---
You let your 7 year old play this online survival game with  graphic violence alone with strangers whilst you cleaned the house?
---
They're is an owl mask?
---
yes its always the pc's fault. well my pc is fine, and it ran ok last week, i mean a gtx 1070 and i7 6700 isnt exactly bad is it
---
Certain Perk cards should be passive, like hacking, lock picking, strong back, life giver, etc. 
---
I think we should get a passive slot every 5-10 levels, where we can equip those passive cards. That way we don't have the ability to get +50DR or carry weight by level 5. 
---
I just hit level 70 in Skyrim, and have not done any of the main quest since the tutorial. Taking it at your own pace is just fine!
---
Just head to the tinker stations and make some ammo. What lvl are you and what ammo do you need? I may or may not be able to help. 
---
Yeah bro same
---
if this story is for real... i swear im done with society...
---
I play the exact same way, and it drives my husband batshit. You know what drives *me* batshit? Going to the same place more than once because I forgot something. 
---
Do you think this is just a glitch or just a punishment for dupers
---
They must have some ultracite claws if they can just bury straight through concrete bunkers and foundations
---
Pain Train is for when you run into an enemy it says nothing about falling...
---
I get glowing mutants like this all the time! A coiled mod on your power armour is a handy way to help finish them off, as when I get it the enemy flies around the map, unable to get shot in at all.

I got to the end of silo as I needed to protect robots I got disconnected, was very upset

I’d like to think new vaults would have to eventually bring npcs
---
No.  
---
Sentinel Assassins armor and the lone wanderer perk make it so while standing still a player is basically invincible.  Getting staggered though counts as movement and removes the damage reduction.  Typically a standoff between 2 players actually geared for PVP will be a flurry of explosive shots where the first person to get offset by one loses.  
---
Gotta get me one. Creepy looking things
---
I gave up with turrets. It feels ridiculous wasting half my camp budget on absolutely nothing. I built my camp on the outskirts of watoga so that whenever something decides to come by and smack my plants, a local assaultron tells them to piss off
---
its literally the point of every single video game ever made.....

I'll try next but it doesn't say that anywhere.

I hadn't ever read the rules! Thanks for the point

His conclusions noted especially that watching TV for long periods puts the brain into a highly suggestible state.

Yes, that means what you think it means.
---
Fair criticism? He has literally posted fake information before and never updated his videos.
---
Hey man, been trying this out for a day now. I cant seem to find a 'base item' for the trapper set. Also, there seems to be no way to directly message a user, just post on an item. Its hard talk to arrange a deal. Will you be adding any sort of messaging function in the future? Great work so far, this website is sorely needed.
---
There’s no right or wrong way to play a Fallout game. That’s the beauty behind it. Sounds like mentioned gentlemen wouldn’t make great companions anyways, on-screen or off. 
---
I wake up every morning and go, "You know what I REALLY NEED to enjoy this game? A million bobbleheads. And not a figure of speech, a literal million bobbleheads. The game will be so fun then I won't have any choice but to... Trade with random people to show off my bobbleheads?"
---
There is no way they can't figure out this person isn't legitimate and can't ban them for life. WTF?
---
I am going to sell my sole then crash the game. UNLIMITED SOULS!!!
---
Don't hide their names. Expose them for what they are.
---
Oh, yeah, PA build skips unyielding. That's where you'll have to sort your INT perks between guns, power armor, demo, etc.
---
People buy them for real $.
---
even the devil needs the occasional pit stop
---
Hmm, I'll have to look into that. Would having the adamantium perk keep you from staggering since you never cripple?
---
Right.  So another made up post with no video proof.   Why do this?  There’s enough cool content in the game that’s real.
---
That’s my thinking, unless they’re all dead some how before the vault opens. 
---
Ditto and most annoyingly I sometimes can’t find my door to get out lol
---
If we are talking about realism, the immediate effects and radiation of a nuclear strike wouldn't dissipate after 2 hours like nothing happened.

I really hope NPCs come

---
Ignorant people that pay real money to fraud/cheaters for cheated items that make their game worse, laggy and dc all the time, that may in the end get erased (i hope). 
---
It’s a nice thought at least..
---
The cool idea someone brought up before is that this was Bethesda plan all along to slowly revive the wasteland but since the game came out in a poor state no on gave them the hope they needed for the nee dlc 
---
I know it seems like a simple thing and pointless that I’m talking about it, but I literally had no idea this was a thing. I thought I’d just admire the view but then it said I could search the area. Thought it would be cool to tell others if they didn’t know as well. 
---
I’m by no means an expert at the game or any games really so you can’t blame me for not knowing. 
---
The unsaid key to not losing your first bag is DO NOT pick up any new junk after you die.
---
If you dont pick anything up your old bag will sometimes move to your new death site or stay where you first died. If you have even one piece of junk on you though, the new junk will drop on your death and overwrite the old bag.
---
Also be careful around fissure sites, if you fall into the fissure you dont generate a bag and your loot is gone.
---
Congratulations on the termination of these shit relationships. Don't ever let anyone tell you how to enjoy a game. Sincerely, from a fellow sneaky lvl 35 who haven't yet visited Charleston. 
---
Great response and I understand what you’re saying. Thanks for taking the time. 🙂
---
Glad to hear it and you're welcome! Just didn't want anyone else to read it like I initially did hehe
---
One thing I didn’t realize at first was that your weapon and armor plans unlock new levels to the same point you are at every 5-10 levels, so if you’re say level 30 you can make level 30 weapons and armor if you have the plans
---
Thank you all for helping! Now that I know what they are called and where they might pop up, I'm a happy C.A.M.P.E.R. 
---
😊😋
---
Even if Bethesda fixes duping, these guys will never run out duped weapons. The game needs a reboot.
---
Vault raids, player vending machines, new quests, and events
---
A duper speaks in public... rare you lads tend to cower and abuse people in private messages then block them.
---
Let me ask you something.
---
Do you not care at all for the longevity of the game, the community or the player market at all?.
---
Nice, I might slip this into my rotation since it kinda matches up with all the steampunk wallpapers I have.
---
No NPCs coming. We know this since the very beginning.
---
This literally can't happen.  There is a two mine limit in the game.
---
I mean they die in one shot by like level 20 if not less
---
Your a idiot. Hope Bethesda account bans any who dupe.
---
Isn't that normal though? Sneaking around avoiding combat and collecting stuff and just enjoying the game. You don't have to be good as long as you enjoy it. You will improve over time so take your time and enjoy yourselve. 
---
I ran into this asshole who showed up in my camp and was like, "I'm just checking you out because you hadn't moved in a while and I kill dupers." 
---
Me: "That's cool, I'm just waiting for my mineral extractor to pump this last bit of black titanium ore." 
---
Him: "I've got lots of that back at my camp if you want some, just follow me back." 
---
Me: "uhhh no thanks, I'd rather do it myself." 
---
Him, five minutes later: "I'm gonna dupe tonight if you need anything." 
---
Me: "Fucking that."
---
*Logs off*
---
Pretty much happens all the time now.
---
That's exactly what I want, a tuba! 
---
Use the power armor light ant keep truning it and off on the bag making an epilepsy triggering spotlight. If they notice the bag and dont move dont worry im sure their family will call 911 for u.
---
So what? Parents are too worried today.
---
yeah
---
I rode my horse off way too many cliffs in Skyrim. 
---
Why are you posting about a game you feel is poorly designed? If you don’t care why engage?
---
I care. I like this game. Don’t like toxic behavior. So I made a post about my experience on a sub dedicated to the game. Clear up your confusion?
---
You are not able to do this. It has to be crafted as such
---
Right on. I'll throw an invite nonetheless. I feel past level 50 group play will become critical for enjoyment. Especially PvP. 
---
We can be sneaking buddies, I play almost exactly like you. Ha!
---
Read the study, I provided the link when someone asked - note especially the conclusions around Alpha waves and the effects of spending extended periods in a state more open to suggestion. 
---
Note also what the researcher went on to do professionally, lol.
---
Can you macro on ps4?
---
This the tears of all their bitching that will follow here on reddit will be just amazing.
---
I was thinking other day that the experiment for vault 76 could be the scorched plague, and that we are still part of the experiment, like, how would a smallish population of talented individual deal with it.
---
I'm in the thousandair club myself, lvl 75 and never had more than 2500 caps to my name. 
---
That is great lol.
---
Nah, mine is a bit more north east at the lead deposit (on a small cliff)
---
I can switch between big guns and 2h melee for both I have all three levels of damage perks also stabilized for guns incisor for melee bloody mess I don't have any agility so o could do lvl 1 adrenaline but I haven't so far
---
I heard that happens if she's targeting someone and they log out.
---
This is so brave. So this is what representation feels like. 
---
Twice she’s de spawned on me immediately it’s infuriating when I drop 1000+ rounds on of ammo on her 
---
It sucks he had to block out the username, I love a witch hunt when it takes down scumbag hackers. 
---
Can’t recall them saying never.. But maybe I missed it..
---
I've had this occured as well at location 1 in my post. Most of the time if a deathclaw nest spawn, some dead brahmin and travelling merchants will spawn around it. I think by it both rendering in at the same time, the deathclaw gets the accidental name of the merchant.
---
Genuinely sucks, this scumbag should be hunted down. 
---
Thanks for the support! 
---
The trapper set does seem to be missing from the DB! Great find! This will be corrected today. 
---
So, currently the only communication in the app is through commenting. Comments alert the seller and the other people who have left comments on that item. 
---
I'm not a duper. But I do buy duped items. Enjoy that nuke drop when it disconnects every 30 minutes because people are duping. Suckers.
---
I was just talking with someone about this on a pvp thread I made. He said that if you can get your hads on some sentenial assasins armour you take little to no damage when you're standing still. This would offset the getting one shotted from a TSE and you can engage with them. 
---
I haven't tried it yet since I don't have any. 
---
It’s just a merchant mini game for them I guess?
---
But even that wouldn’t be fun with this inventory. 
---
Except... you do. Your not an NPC, just another vault dweller like the rest of us. 
---
Choosing not to use the PVP option provided and instead you wreck camps? Interesting. 
---
Same here, and fuck anybody else who shits on how you choose to play. I went through the same thing with several exes of mine. To me, the whole damn point is to enjoy the game. Kudos to you for standing your ground girl!
---
Ive never duped anything so its probably just a glitch
---
I think it's random? I had this happen near one of the fissure sights. 
---
I don’t use TSE but I still won’t share.  Sorry, but find your own golf course.
---
Can we get a fix to the Salvaged Assaultron Head [glitch](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9yxaqy/salvaged_assaultron_head_do_not_use/)??
---
It’s a wrong model issue.
---
It is supposed to be an encounter where you come across a dead brahmin and a dead traveling merchant, and the live deathclaw which “killed” them. However the deathclaw spawns in dead AS the traveling merchant along with the Brahmin.
---
They care little for caps check my link they just need to dupe Nuka Cola. When they have 25k caps and 100,000 colas waiting on their alt. They just want to milk all the real world money they can before the ban hammer falls.
---
On ebay you can see that alot of people are buying these duped weapons... so they are clearing up a nice sum. No care for the community, the game or the longevity of the game.
---
Its why these posts are important because the first dupe tricks were noted in Beta. 
---
I got assloads of springs, screws and ballistic fiber by parking CAMP at Camp McCormick and clearing the area each spawn. There's 10 ballistic fiber, 6-8 screws (typewriters, fans) and a load of clipboards with springs.
---
No enemies, quick run through each server hop, snag the goods and go about your life.
---
I did this exactly once on impulse, felt like a total jackass for it, and never had the urge to again.
---
I can understand doing it once because you don't know any better. But after the first time, it should dawn on you that you've just used this thing they enjoy as a weapon to make them feel bad about themselves. That you've turned this common interest into a negative experience for them. Essentially you've soured their ability to enjoy it.
---
One might have been an accident. 
---
The next might be a automated factory. 
---
They can’t all be peopleless. 
---
I’m happy to wait 
---
Pretty sure they're bats, right?
---
I always get lost in the school, my favorite places are the amusement parks. All those lovely lovely bright white plastic cups lying all over the place and nice long sight lines for sniping in sneak mode
---
No, they are actually bats.
---
I use the shotgun accuracy/reduced spread perk in the perception tree along with Enforcer, and breaking one or both of their wings seems to guarantee a landing if they have space for it.
---
I haven’t had any issues so long as I stay outdoors and move away from stuff in the environment. But man, these guys were annoying as hell to fight before I understood how picky they are with their landing spots. 
---
Yep, been there.  He didn't pop until I was actually on the island.  Dropped 4 or 5 titanium.  Hopping servers for this guy may be the best approach.
---
We can always dream, even if it’ll never come true. 
---
You won't get a response, even if you did, it wouldn't matter. Entitled children like him are completely unable to understand just how much of a scumbag they are. You'll never beat out his mental gymnastics. 
---
I can see that they can't track the actual duping, but I'd have to imagine they can see what is in a character's inventory. It should be a simple query to a server. 
---
fucking molerats are super stupid in this game for sure. 
---
Your just as bad as the dupers i hope they have a way to remove all glitched items.
---
I've come across more 7 yr olds with language worth then most older people. I typically avoid playing with kids because they are worse then most adults lol. As for violence... Lol... There's alot worse then what's in this game, and have seen younger kids play. 
---
Well the lore mentioned 96 but apparently they all died or something... Maybe it's a cult thing or some new mutants or whatever. 
---
I'm hoping for new enemies because more is always better. Something really fierce and challenging is especially needed.... Maybe rip off that Jurassic park movie and make weaponized deathclaws lol
---
The holotape in the storage room of Morgantown airport is suuuuper depressing lol. Basically some lady got trapped in there and you listen to her slowly die over the course of a week from dehydration and starvation since the door doesnt open from the inside 
---
You had to buy it from the atom shop I believe 
---
Gross
---
&gt; (Sadly the game makes her motion sick so she couldn't play for long.)
---
Ugh that's the worst. =(  
---
I get motion sickness playing some games, too.  I had to really fight through the first couple of days of FO76 and then it got better.  Some games there is no pushing through it (Looking at you, Mario 64 and Minecraft) but I was determined to give it 3 or 4 days.  Fortunately it subsided and I was able to play.  I was lucky this time
---
I know i have tried many times and never gotten a clear response out of the game is shit and deserves yada yada yada crap.
---
I loved ready player one! Actually that makes me feel all fuzzy, Thankyou!
---
I've been spamming the trade emote until they accept then make a zero cap offer.

Gotcha, so every 15-30 seconds for me.

Uranium fever event. You’ll rack up more titanium than you’ll know what to do with after scrapping loot.

Lvl 24 and 10mm
---
If you don't use a TSE or BSS, or Heavy Instigating I don't think you're much capable of not sharing, people will tag the ones you don't hit immediately
---
Honestly I’d be okay with my characters capacity plus 10% for a MCC 
---
Why ruin the game carrying 1000+ lbs it’s a survival game
---
I gave up my pip boy to Rose for protection.
---
I was actually thinking about something along the lines of this! I was thinking sort of like how they did it in Elder Scrolls Online, where you would buy inventory or bank space upgrades for a certain amount of gold. Difficult to think of good prices for them though. Try to balance it, say 100 caps for 10 extra lbs, then 110 for the next 10 etc. (just a thought)
---
I mean u dont have to but is more fun than not using it
---
I’ve never seen it there 
---
Or ya know, just kill Mole Miners which are more common.
---
I can help you out with 10mm ammo later tonight if you still need it. 
---
When it comes to most fallout games, slow and steady is always best.  Explore EVERY nook, cause the details make the game.  I found a toilet the other day with a teddy bear holding a human arm (skeleton) holding a plunger.  What happened here? I don't know if i want to know.
---
Every player has a different style, and this game suits every single one equally. YOU DO YOU. I'm proud to have a fellow gamer who can kill a scorchbeast. There are a lot of them, and they all need to die.
---
I think this is very possible. I have noticed several patterns like this
---
Cool are u online?
---
That's great info, will see if that helps the next time 
---
And everyone stood up on the bus and clapped...

I haven't heard that one. If it is the case then no doubtedly there would be evidence to uncover

this.

---
Yeah I'm a bit boring but I had a minute where I was actually super proud of myself and had no-one to tell, so I came here. Keep on keeping on :)
---
depends on the game
---
Yeah send me msg then my gt is HyproCat12 
---
Oh wicked I didn’t know that, it’s been a while since I’ve played it...just sitting aside till some patches role through, but I’ll have to get back in. Thanks!
---
I'm fully aware of how it works.
---
More like bugs in the human gene pool
---
I have about 4 good builds i could use. Plus i have moved a few points to try other things. After awhile of playing, i saw some perks I've used for a long time not be as useful as once before. So i would change cards or move points to use cards that benefit me more now, then earlier on in game. So there's always room for tweaks.. And im lvl 162
---
You are winner number four! send me a message with your Fallout76 IGN, you will need to friend me as well, My IGN is Pure_Savagery
---
+karma thank you so much
---
oh lol. so then would they count towards the hunters legendary effect as animals?
---
You've been hit by a smooth criminal! 
---
Thanks I was hoping this has happened to someone else as well
---
Idk i only get trash legendaries soo
---
I miss my grandmother too, but it's important to remember that she was loved and likely lived an awesome life and had awesome family (you!)
---
At this point I would like to see how many true two shot explosive guns there are..I'm betting well under 1% is a true game generated
---
it's your fault the game has bugs from 15 years ago
---
not the developer's fault, oh me oh my
---
XB1
---
Kinda like to have the Quad Combat... 
---
It’s almost like this is actually a shitty game....
---
Level 119, never got the achievement for hitting level 100...
---
Bethesda told me the only solution was to do it again...😣
---
this is a real problem, but not much you can do about it, nuke again
---
Witch-hunting probably isn't allowed on this sub

Was like a 24 hour sale only

Yes, I can hear everything said and he understands that violence in video games a real life violence are two very different things. 
---
I ended shitting another 5 points into charisma as by this point I was always teamed up whilst online.
---
I play the same way, I'm level 35 after nearly 100 hours and I still run away, screaming when I see a scorch beast.  Using your ex's logic, you're a WAY better gamer than I.  Using my logic, I'm having fun so couldn't give a rat's arse, and neither should you! 
---
Makes sense.  My last Blackwater trip yielded legendary sporting equipment (golf club,  pool cue)
---
Makes me think of a British Pop singer... Pretty cool
---
I found a skeleton mowing the lawn just near vault 76 the other day, it made me smile 
---
Lol it's totally ok to suck at videogames. This reminds me of when people say they suck at drawing. There's just no such thing really...
---
Yasss! Add me: WordsmithChar

RIP your inbox vault dweller

You’re wrong about that. I met a group of guys that have a character that weighs 37,000,000 lbs. not even kidding. They said anything over that instantly crashes any server that character tries to join. I have duped weapons that I bought from people, but it is the only way to get my hands on them because Bethesda made the odds so skewed. It’s like they were asking for people to find a way to make those weapons more available. Now that there are so many out there, it will create an entire new pvp economy. Whether is works out or not is yet to be seen, but Bethesda making things like tse and jet packs so rare is asking for people to manipulate the system. I could never get into duping myself though because it’s a game to play and the people that dupe hardly do anything besides farm nuke zones and obsessively copy whatever they can get their hands on. I’m looking for an adventure that doesn’t require me to run from level 70 super mutants. With my tse I can actually put up a fight. 
---
I can only see the abstract but I get the premise
---
Im guessing the researcher went into advertising? 
---
I'm on PC thou and someone already asked me to hold it for them, so I am going too, sorry
---
Bethesda is at fault yes but does not mean they get a free pass. Also the point OP is showing is a reminder to them that they need to swing the ban hammer hard as its against their TOS that we all read and agreed to.
---
Meaning exploiters should lose their Bethesda accounts and all games attached to it. As they purposefully seeked means to exploit the game.
---
I cannot wait for all the salty stories that will appear on reddit.
---
lol farm for a week and not use the wrecking ball... yeah right
---
Let me guess. You don’t have kids.
---
Seems to me that all the best would be parents in the world never seem to have children. Wonder why that is.
---
You’re depriving the world of glorious spawn. Go get a hooker pregnant and change the world man. 
---
I guess the same reason energy weapon durability hasn't been fixed. Or how several weapon tags don't work with the proper weapon perk card. Or how Shotguns usually do no damage to flying scorchbeasts.
---
This is stuff I expected to be fixed on the first week. Now we are 2nd month.
---
To sell for real cash on eBay and the like
---
No worries, thanks anyway
---
400,000 big gun bobbleheads will keep you with the bonus 24 hours a day for around 45 years. I will not play this game that long.
---
I always got trash until I hit level 55 or so and it seemed to get better, getting marine armor all the time now
---
Seriously. I just created one of with lots of help from my bf lol. I will pm you an invite link 
---
I think it would be interesting if they periodically open vaults and if you started a character in the period that vault was opened then your character would have that vaultsuit and start from that vault. But this most likely wont happen and itll just be some sort of npcs. If they did do that there could be events like vault vs vault
---
There's alot more mask that haven't been found same with other headwear 
---
Guaranteed spawn is in the vault room at the train yard north of the whitespring
---
Except... it's on your arm. 
---
It's like the Patrick ID card meme. Come on. Griefing players under the guise of roleplaying is way overdone. You want PVP, there are better ways. But it's pretty clear that's not your goal, based on these responses. 
---
Once I get a quad .44 or Western I'm dropping the rifles. I love gunslinger builds. You carry one with a scope for a few potshots and crit all the things when they run at you!
---
Im in the bazaar, was this on the discord and who was it?
---
Them feels, man. I don't care about the weapons, but I'd hate to lose those server hopping plans. 
---
oh thats shitty
---
Congrats!   One of the best parts of Fallout is how you can play with your own style!   
---
Honestly tho... F*** the abusive BFs
---
Pretty sure cold hard cash is what they looking for and ppl are paying
---
400,000 bobbleheads is roughly 47 years of buff. Does he think we will still be playing this in 47 years time? 
---
Yup. I have a separate build tho for it. I'm just hoping for a shared character stash 
---
I dont know what slowing down armor decay has anything to do with this conversation...
---
It’s usually the people who don’t have kids that like to give parenting advice.
---
Let me tell you.
---
I thought I had my parenting style all figured out. Soon as that kid came out. I was fucked lol mind went blank. 
---
I don't know the method to duplicate things (because I am here to enjoy the game) but this method implies to crash the servers?! 
---
No.  They count as Scorched though.
---
Vaults will open to explore
---
there will be no non player characters
---
you were sheltered in the vault while the scorch threat killed off every last living person or faction
---
you play as the character that saves the wasteland
---
Ok awesome I’m BABYFACEKILLA000 
---
I have literally read every single comment and message on here, because the majority are overwhelmingly kind and supportive! So rip my inbox indeed, but it's mostly a nice thing!
---
I have gotten a plan for the confederate hat but I am unable to unlock the plan.... and I'm not able to do it in any workbench either...
---
Have you tried shooting/hitting it? Usually works for me 👍
---
Even play the game?.
---
Yes it has issues but its a pretty amazing game with alot of potential. Its part of the reason why the community truly despises those that seek ways to exploit the game and ruin it.
---
This is an issue all ONLINE games face and people that try to exploit are pure scum of the earth.
---
Huh cool. 
---
Nah dude, the goul slaying gamma gun. Lol
---
No matter how many stashes you steal, people you report, dupers you massacre - there’s gonna be a TSE shotgun or HMR available for 20$ on eBay. Fact of life.
---
Stop trying to justify exploiting just because almost everyone has a duped weapon. Its like saying that drug dealers and producers shouldn't go to jail because people use their drugs.
---
Sure, both the users and the enablers are guilty of wrongdoing, but the enabler is definitely the one deserving the harsher sentence. 
---
Craft one
---
Same. But nobody buys my stuff because it's not TSE lol
---
This entire reddit post makes me sick.
---
Want a spot that will never have conflict with someone else, it exists. I assure you though, you'd be an absolute moron to build there though!
---
In the far southern portion of the "Savage Divide" is a spot with both Acid and Lead in close proximity of each other. The acid is interestingly in a cave, the lead deposit higher up, above the cavern. Outside less than 100 meters away. FISSURE SITE. Yep, don't worry about human neighbors, nothing but ghoulies and misery-spreading Bat-Monsters.
---
I.. don't know if I'm meant to be terrified or if that's just your name
---
They count as animals and scorched
---
ok thanks
---
Enclave under armoire, bos knight and officer uniforms, harness, military fatigues, I think raider leathers and there’s more.
---
Alright
---
Yeah, when I switch to my shotgun I usually shoot for the ground to splash-damage the legs, or offsides of a grouped mob to not direct hit any one targets.  Dunno why it's so hard for people to spend a teensy bit of extra effort to be courteous.
---
Jam partner running late huh. I hate when my mates aren't on time to gigs
---
Hey guys, I killed a scorchbeast with no chems too...
---
Military Fatigues, Road Leathers, Harness, Brotherhood soldier suit, Operative Underarmor, flannel shirt and jeans, marine wetsuit. The easiest are either Road Leathers, or Military Fatigues. You can find road leathers and harnesses at raider outposts
---
If you're on PS4 I can craft you new ones
---
Scorchbeasts are easy if you wear power armor... If you don't they're very tough even at much higher levels. 
---
I don't know why your bf would try to convince you not to play. I'd be happy if my gf shared an interest with me even if she wasn't very good. I guess it would be annoying if I always had to play with her and do what she wanted. I could see trying to convince her not to get it if that's how things were.
---
It's a perfectly cromulent word.
---
Sadly actual explosive weapons are useless waste of space, and thus ordinance expert and grenadier is a waste of perks,. Just keep the explosive legendary affix weapons, they are exponentially superior and theres no point in fatman, missile launcher, grenade launcher, grenades, or mines at the time being.
---
I've got almost 5k saved up after spending over 2k of atoms. I check it out everyday, and never see anything that I want. What are these cool things you want?
---
agentclaret
---
That's so shitty of them. I'm happy with the fact that my girlfriend genuinely likes video games.
---
I will admit that before they fixed the annoying weight bug with armor I started using the unlimited weight glitch after respawning naked several times into a nuke zone. However, that fucker has more weight in one type of bobbleheads than I even came close to.
---
Stop ruining this shit for other people.
---
P.S. before anyone says anything I stopped doing it happily they day they patched the stupid armor bug.
---
Blow em all up. He probably won't have enough resources to repair them all. You'll be wanted but it would be fun. Got any explosive weapons? 
---
That's kind of how I play. I love playing stealth characters and I love the lore aspect of games. That being said, there is no right or wrong way to play a Fallout game. You can tailor the world how you see fit. That's the beauty of open world games. Don't let anyone tell you how to plan any game, Fallout or otherwise.  People who rush past the towns and such never learn what made them so unique and what happened to them after the bombs fell. That's what immersion is all about. I mean, why bother playing a game if you can't be bothered to actually enjoy it?
---
Lol im level 103 and only have one explosive weapon and its not even level 45-50
---
God, what a fucking douchebag 
---
Just watched the videos, make sure radaway is out of your system or it will not work. I just drop that crap nowadays, I avoid showers also! You need to have no chems in your system and the serum should work. Hope this helps. I will catch you later and see if it does I have the plan so I will just make you a new serum on the house. Beth. should give my character wings haha...
---
There is a lot of potential that could be had in this game, if Bethesda would see it. Allow passage of time, but possibly instanced, depending on the stage of the main quest you’re on. Perhaps eventually allowing actual established communities mixed with player owned property, and NPC’s. A lot more than just this..
---
Go in front of them.
---
Eh, it happens. And everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Even if they're stupid and wrong, lol.
---
And that's okay.
---
I don't have anything I need to prove to the people that think I'm a squeaker, or a pre-pubescent boy from Russia (what?!), or Bob forbid, female. I'm just here to play games, yo.
---
If you are using a controller it's probably stick drift.
---
You have to do it again if you leave the world. If you get to the end and you lose connection, that's you leaving a world and hence have to go through the whole process of launching the nuke again. 
---
New card, new pipes, new cores, new robots unless you have launched the nuke already, and have got back onto the same world (by joining a friend or a recent player) 
---
Yes, this is a common problem, it's happened to me twice today alone and I've been /attempting/ to kill the queen all week. 
---
Each time you want to launch a nuke, you need a new nuclear key card from the cargoBOT or another player, if you've put that silos code in this week you don't need to put the code in again, just the key card. After you launch a nuke you'll have a 15 minutes before the silo closes and kicks you out, and you'll be locked out of launching a nuke from that silo for 2 hours. 
---
If you choose to nuke fissure prime you'll have 3 minutes to get there, and 30 minutes to kill the queen, if you don't kill it, run out of time or disconnect. You need to start over from the beginning.
---
&gt;  No care for the community, the game or the longevity of the game.
---
Food comes first and then morality. Not all the dupers are stupid, ignorant pricks. In some parts of the world ruining the fun westerners have on their entertainment is a side effect of plain survival.
---
(And when I look at the dominant political narratives currently, that isn't going to change anytime soon.)
---
Yes. And no it’s not. That’s bullshit. Most online games are actually playable and not loaded with game breaking bugs like this pile of shit. It has potential but they didn’t it so horribly and it’s like the game doesn’t know what it really wants to be. And every time Bethesda tries to update and fix it, it gets worse. It’s a fucking shitshow and it’s why this sub has died off and why the game is dying off. Nowhere is this game being promoted as the game of the year and nowhere is anybody raving about the game. Only the fanboys who are afraid to venture onto YouTube and actually see how terrible the game actually is so they can stop lying to themselves are saying “it’s amazing!”.... filthy fucking casuals, man...
---
Even with all that aside, the way Bethesda ripped off its Collectors Edition buyers and then proceeded to doxx them, is disgusting. But I’m sure all the fanboys forgot all about that so they can help themselves sleep at night for supporting such business practices...
---
You could be a medic, then distribute stims and rad aways to players. Kinda like how the prize bot stalks you down to give you money or the grand prize. You can also revive anyone you want to when they go down. Today I saw someone go down in pvp but the other dude didn't finish him off. I stimed the downed dude up and he got up and wrecked the other guy. It was pretty funny tbh. 
---
We have an announcement to make.. lol
---
I get bored and see newbies coming out of the vault and hide above it with a bowie knife, mask and strait jacket.   Then their first view of the outside world is a maniac with a knife singing butcher Pete....he's hacking whacking and smacking.  Then if they don't freak out I drop a live grenade at my feet and leave them with what ever scrap I had 
---
I took it off my arm. Not a hard concept. 
---
I hardly see anyone roleplaying, about 2 nights ago I did find a group of 3 that were all role playing as BOS. They killed me over and over again. It was so much fun. And they kept getting caps in return for killing me and I kept shooting their camp. Then one talked on mic asking me to stop, and I did. I will always fall back on the, if it is in the game, they want me to do it. There is a perk card made specifically for destroying camps.
---
I'm not made of caps!
---
black prospectors hat 
---
Yep but what’s to say others were t sheltered in their Vaults too. Some are unopened, surely not all the residents inside are dead. 
---
Your boyfriends sound like "elite gamer douchebros". I've been playing games for 30 years and my game style sounds very similar to yours. I'm male if it matters.
---
I suppose being an asshole is harder to admit for some people
---
i'm just starting to believe they are not in the game and it must be some kind of mod
---
I just got a two shot ultracite laxer pistol. Is it worth keeping?
---
Sorry but I’d rather have a few people with disposable income subsidizing my online play with frivolous atom shop spending, rather than have to pay a subscription or something similar for continued online development.
---
Maybe for fun? They don't weight much.
---
I am a guy and play the exact same way you do and am having the time of my life. Screw those guys. Play your way and have a ball!
---
Very nice! Do you have any 2560x1080 wallpapers?
---
Yeah, just need to take a look at how many people bought Fallout 76 on launch day, the amounts of idiots is staggering.
---
Paid for upvotes again. Really sad 
---
why on earth would you ever care what someone thinks about how you play a video game? 
---
3 weeks to get level 34?.. I would have broken up with you based on those stats alone.
---
&gt; But no they're the stupid assholes
---
Yup. Pretty much.
---
il start with the questions: 
---
crashing is hit or miss with them, i had one crash and 1 success today on them.  the countdown quest must be completed every time you try a launch. the faction quest related to silos is a 1 time quest though.
---
as far as tips go, bring meds and make sure you have some sort of decent weapon before you go in.  after a few runs of the silo you will get the hang of it, and after upgrading gear and hitting 60+ it eventually becomes second nature
---
They're even pickier than that. 
---
I was fighting two at once, I never moved, neither did my friend. I broke everything near instantly, however, they wouldn't land. When they got under half, maybe more, they both suddenly landed. 
---
I don't get it.
---
You'd be surprised at the kinds of things people buy. I've had to sell some stuff like bolstering +strength armor to robots, and meanwhile sold stuff I never expected to make it. Just be patient, have reasonable prices, and luck will take it from there
---
you should go play a game with no cash shop that's online . Oh... wait
---
You proved my main point.. Any one benefiting/enjoying themselves from duping or drug dealing is a hypocrite and shouldn't hate on dupers. A coke addict has no right to talk shit about Pablo Escobar.
---
Dude that's how I play too 
---
You go girl. The best reddit award today is yours:)
---
I wasn't even telling people they were bad, I was just giving my personal experience of enemy... I guess I should've known I'd be downvoted for not agreeing with the hivemind though
---
I report every suspisious xbox group post.
---
maybe it helps. maybe it doesnt.
---
I've never tried it, but I will check it out to see. Healing factor+life saving armor has made me no longer fear jumping off of absolutely anything haha
---
you don't have to but enough people are so that you also don't have to pay a subscription and will be getting free DLC.
---
Hahaah, it's pretty funny but her game style actually sounds typical and *fun*.
---
In Fallout 4 you could die from being overweight. It was harsh if you forgot when taking of power armor. I see no reason they couldn't set an upper limit here. Sure you want to look like crazy but constantly run out of AP that's fine. When you weigh more than a semi truck then that's going to be an issue.
---
I have a 3* instigating double barrel, double damage if target is at full health, bullets explode for area damage, 90% weight reduction 
---
Isn’t it illegal to be selling video game items like that? 
---
They had this exact problem with ESO, they fixed it and banned people. I got kicked out of the server 5 times last night, and the Pocketed Marine Chest plans that I purchased didn't show up in my crafting items after one of them, so I want it done as much as the rest of the community. But patience and hope is all we have
---
Yeah but is it worth making ammo for it or does it shoot normal fusion cells??
---
Hells yes! Screw stereotypes and your exs for making fun of you. Do what you enjoy and do it the way you want. That's the glory of video games, its a personal experience most of the time. As a fellow female gamer I applaud you! I'm only level 25 and also take things slow :) ♡♡♡ Congratulations on the kill. 
---
I play on xbox, but that sweet sweet karma is too tempting
---
I like to shoot lvl 5’s at Morgantown airport with my double shot explosive combat shotgun that I duped. If they fast travel, I’ll tail them and launch fat man nukes on their base. Then I message them to uninstall the game. 
---
It’s the only fun thing to do at lvl 175+ when you have all serums, recipes, and double shot explosive guns in the game.
---
They couldn’t even get the 21:9 wide screen support right
---
Yeah I’d really hold my breath on this one...
---
I play with my husband and his friends, they're so helpful.. there's me and 1 other girl and we always team up. We all help each as much as possible but I've never had any shit from him or other guys. In life and games... if a man, person or  whatever tells u "you cant do ..... " they either hate you or are jealous of u. I love that meme "if u can believe in Santa claus u can believe in urself"  
---
Yep, Tanagra town. To get up there you climb through some caves and there's a dwemer robot face in there. 
---
Hmmmm.. I've never used it one but I am pretty sure they have primed mods. I think that only prime receivers require ultracite ammo, otherwise it is normal fusion cells. So if it was a primed ultracite laser then yes ultracite ammo, if it was a normal ultracite laser it should be normal fusion cells.
---
I'd double check though!
---
I thought duping was fixed? Either way having 1000+ lbs of junk on you does not lag the server.  
---
Thats a load of wank...
---
I will happily call Bethesda out on their shit and i have.
---
But this game is no where near as bad as you bloody claim. The main issues i face is server stability and i am sure once they ban hammer and fix the exploit that will lessen alot.
---
The game is pretty top tier for a Fallout game with a truly amazing community. Calling us Fan Boys or shills is just silly. Not saying your point of view is wrong exactly. But if you dislike the game no one is forcing you to play or even be here.
---
Us that are how ever will do what ever we can to make sure this game has a long long future. 
---
of course. I think it's best to get a bunch of perk cards you want to use first then start moving points around. I wasted 10 levels moving points around someone's back and forth and now that I got things right point wise I'm still a few cards short and the levels are grindier after 100.
---
&gt;scary and almost unreal
---
Not gonna lie I personally think the mole miners are scarier; mainly all the grunting they do and their degenerated bodies.
---
Ghost people were just creepy and annoying to kill. And its Fallout so theyre both equally unreal lol
---
Sorry, what’s duping? So I’ll know when I see it while playing (Level 32)
---
While you’re correct the guy did say that the player was only a level 17, I think a couple of super sledge swings outta do the trick
---
Kill. 
---
Everything.
---
I know this is an older thread, but where is the Crimson at Whitesprings? I have a tough time getting more than even 4 plants.
---
Arent disease resistance and rad resistance different. I didn't think lead offered any disease resistance at all. 
---
Thanks but as it's my first, it's going to be my showpiece for now...and I'm on PC.
---
Except it's right there, on your arm. It's not a hard concept. 
---
Ah well, keep griefing, it's pretty clear no one is going to be able to get you to see what's wrong with your whole premise. 
---
This sounds like it's Bethesda's fault not the players.
---
They need to fix that.
---
Doesn't exist suffice to say. Not even a two-fer. Closest you'll get to "Two" deposits is the Ammo Factory. Lead is used for ammo, so skipped a step, and there is a Lead Deposit.
---
While the other stuff is more than likely duped, you can get tons of fusion cores pretty easy when you get into the later levels. I've had to drop at least 40 of them since they weigh so damn much, and I dont go through them that fast anyway. You can also farm them at lower levels at the posieden power plant. Claim the workshop after powering up the plant, and you get a fusion core processor that spits out a fusion core every 90 minutes or so.
---
I avoid main story lines like they're the plague in every game I play. I don't even get my first shout in Skyrim until I've literally discovered and done everything else in the game. And when it comes to fallout, I don't use chems either. I mostly forget about them but I also don't want to get addicted to them. I was using alcohol as a water substitute until I got addicted one day, stopped drinking it immediately. It never occurred to me that you could get addicted to alcohol like you can chems. A scorchbeast by yourself at level 40, that's amazing!!! I'm level 65 and I've still yet to kill one by myself without the aid of the surface to air missiles (and by aid, I mean them doing 90% of the damage lol).
---
Same here. 
---
R/thathappened
---
I honestly had to leave the room when my ex-girlfriend played. She had fun but I couldn’t bear to watch. So instead of doing what my impulse demanded I would go do laundry or go grocery shopping 😂 
---
Fuck those guys. My girlfriend does exactly what you do. Sneaks everywhere and explores everything, and I love it. I’m just happy that we enjoy the same things, and if she needs help, I help her out. It’s a shame that your ex boyfriends turned such a cool thing for you guys to share into such a venomous point of contention. The good thing is that you will move on and find someone who appreciates it. It’s gonna he far better in the end. 
---
Probably.
---
I've gotten my fiancee into GTA, Minecraft, and she'll watch me play New Vegas. It's a hell of a lot of fun gaming with her!
---
I just really loved that gun. It was my Kalashnikov...
---
Whatever you say....
---
I wouldn't even mine people selling their grinding services for money. Ex: I'll give you 20 bucks to farm these plans because I work 70 hours a week and don't have time. But these fuckers are just out right cheating. Because of this we can never have that. I'm disabled and would love earning a few bucks by legit grinding stuff for people who don't have the time. Honestly just a few bucks for games. Hell I might even buy atoms with it to support the ecosystem. But nope. Thanks to the syphilis infected donkey cock suckers that isn't an option.
---
Lol, gotta love just the close up of the face!
---
Duplicating items. It's a process. It'll be 2 or 3 dudes sitting around a paper bag
---
Yes of course. But it doesn't happen with out it being a TSE
---
It is def against the ToS, I don't know if that makes it illegal though.
---
What if I can only make rent by selling these hundred duped shotties on eBay? We don’t all have a face pretty enough for streaming.
---
Based on the dupe method I know of, I'd estimate takes about 10 minutes to perform a dupe. It doesn't crash the server, it just crashes your character. I won't get into specifics. But it still most likely gives the server a heart attack.
---
All my numbers are made up. 2^19 is about 500,000, so if you start with 1 it takes about 19 or 20 turns to get that number. If you're being safe and reserving some amount it might be, say, around 24 turns to reach that number. 24 rounds at 10 minutes is about four hours.
---
I think they’re skipping 77 and going right to Fallout 80
---
Definantly not a shit game. I killed my first scorchbeast at level 50 something by myself. So you got me beat. Also glad your enjoying the game.
---
actoad
---
The paddle ball one is wrong. The weapon is not scrapppable in 76, therefore the mods must be somewhere. The issue is there is no mods in 76 for it right now. If I am wrong, please correct me
---
I'd say the glitch is back, it's happening to me and I most definately don't want 4 portaloo's.
---
There will always be exploits and glitches. Look at at gtaV I think they should make a report system or maybe delete the tse weapons from the game or give everything explosive resistance 
---
Because there is nothing wrong with it. 
---
don't listen to this clown. He's just a goody goody trying to dissuade those chosen by the Thug-Life cancer he's always getting jacked. I think what OP is doing it's fair play. If I get my camp wrecked I get excited to pursue the bounty. Showing up and whomping on some body for 100+ caps  is a beautiful thing. ( I've seen 200+ bounties before)  I've gone and smashed houses to get crazy bounties and gone picked where to hide and waited for the horde of bounty Hunters to come after me. It's like hide and go seek. I get caps for joking everyone who shows up and whoever finally kills me gets a big pay day. plus they can see me on the map and I came see them. Makes the game feel like I'm being hunted. Try it for thrills.
---
There are several Black Titanium ore deposits in the Belching Betty mine you can collect on each server, if you don't mind the extra trip.  If you have a friend with completed Excavator armor, they can extract 4 times as much ore at each deposit. Needs to be smelted at a chem table, though.
---
If they were bigger like in 3 I'd agree, but at the size they are their exoskeleton wouldn't be that thick
---
Mostly explosives like mini nukes missile etc
---
If anything the fact that they need chems just shows they aren't actually that good at the game. If they were that amazing they could do stuff without chems. I never use chems in FO games I just haven't felt I needed them so far.
---
Yeah buddy it causes alot of stability issues while doing it and ofcourse the aftermath of having people with 1.2 tonnes in their inventory.
---
See my thread on this.
---
You can turn 2 tick blood in to 2 blood packs in to 4 stimpacks in to 16 diluted.
---
With super duper you can easily walk away with over 40 diluted stims from 2 tick bloods.
---
If you're not using explosive, you are behind the rest.
---
Fuck the video game police.  You play the way you want to play.
---
I too am a sneaky loot hoarder.
---
Here's to being constantly over-encumbered 
---
Whatever you want to believe. Griefers are cancer. 
---
Nah. New Vegas was the best for me and for the franchise continuing the narrative of 1 and 2.
---
Wow! Thanks for the detailed explanations/help! Really appreciate it! The CHA tip is awesome. I was wondering if charisma was the only driver of prices. So does that mean that using X-cells will improve prices as well? 
---
I and many others play with my SO. I've ran across many couples in the game.
---
You'll find yours.
---
So we're like the wife beater in the toxic relationship? Where you have had a hard day at work, grinding, bugs, crashes, you come home drink some beer and give Fallout 76 a beating. 
---
IGN is akspa
---
The only thing i want is npc's in the world. It's awful lonely.
---
Then they shouldn't have put it in the game if they didnt want people to use the perk card.
---
Lol cool man thanks. Let me know. And I like your life saving/healing factor combo. You probably never die!
---
Disagree, explosive, especially TSE take away from the game / enjoyment.. And more than a few other high levels agree 
---
That is crazy..I don't think people who get killed as wanted should be able to get revenge. I am glad you took them out though. I know some of the high level folks are due to exploits so some don't have the weapons, ect. it is just you never know if they are loaded with stimpacks and other aids to help due to the dupe glitch.
---
Sneaking is fun, makes the game feel more strategic
---
And easy
---
Explosive though two shot is no slouch by any means.  
---
Just get yourself a two shot explosive gatling gun to have the best of both worlds.
---
Some of the scopes use it.
---
Six months late to the joke
---
Hey I'm lemonlime133 but I'm only lvl 16 
---
I'm so sorry for you man...
---
I haven't had this problem. If someone attacks me and I don't fight back they leave me alone. I mostly see people teaming up and getting each other. Which is a nice change of pace in the gaming world. 
---
I'm Brian
---
Never let anyone tell you that you are having fun the wrong way
---
I have one. I'm also looking for rare outfits if you had any- I'd be open to trade 
---
I broke into vault 96. Can confirm no NPC’s will be coming from the vaults
---
Yeah, but there has to be SOME challenge.  I kinda miss the old FO's way of skills where you got points to spend each level
---
Good.
---
Watoga seems to be the better of the two from what I've heard. Thanks for the reply! About how long did you need to try to finally get them to appear? Also, any tips on leveling quickly? These 15 levels are feeling pretty grindy haha. Also, is 15 the ideal level, or do you think it's equally likely from 15-19?
---
Power armor, some serums,  few other things
---
OP is a liar, moves don't stay permanently. Also there is a two month limit. They blow up after a short period of time.. nice try man
---
It happened to me with my Excavator Helmet. I carefully cleared out the enemies, collected the ingredients and slowly, one-by-one deposited them in the container. The game decided to spawn in a few robots behind me, they hit me and the helmet showed up just where my mouse was pointing at, offsetting the ingredient I was about to deposit. At least I have the plans for that piece, unlike the gifted ultracite armor.
---
But they fixed the event so that only participants get the stew. Why? Because you can't let people just running around with +5% XP, that's too fast!
---
Would you happen to still have it? I will buy it from you for 1k caps! IGN: MightyJL
---
I don’t think so just really shit durability
---
I don’t care what number, I just hope it’s as good as 76
---
Broken windows theory. 
---
If the town is a dump people are likely to commit a crime. 
---
If they are easily available exploits people are more likely to do them. 
---
this should be the top comment.
---
Freezing your game is not the same as freezing the server lol
---
Well seems to be overwhelmingly upvotes now! Nice job, and keep pissing them off. All of us legit players stand behind you😉
---
screaming into the voids of Reddit won't do anything. Write an email.
---
Clearly you've never had to capture (or recapture) a workshop. 
---
Anyway, best of luck with your trolling. Hopefully you get bored of that too sooner rather than later and move along. 
---
What do you mean?
---
Don’t forget to wreck their workshops. I’m sure you’ve figured out that anyone stationary for more than a minute or two out in the wilderness is probably at their camp.
---
Keep in mind if you run directly in front of someone using a TSE or exploding shotty they’ll likely kill themselves.
---
And slap damage still damages armor and power armor unless they’ve patched it. And of course, finding someone low level or low armor and sneaking, then aggro’ing an entire area and running to them before logging out or even just dying intentionally is as raider as it comes.
---
apparently they came from the dev staff room some how? so it'll appear in the game normally, eventually i assume. no reason they'd leave out these sweet masks forever
---
Graham the travelling super mutant merchant sells them
---
I actually got a two shot explosive gatling gun, and my god does that thing just eat through everything .
---
Or use the FO76 livemap... link to come...
---
Nah, we should be in the FO5 beta about that time.  XD
---
Time to shred the wasteland!
---
At some point it can be but atm its definately not 
---
Thanks man
---
Same here.  I'm always getting rid of the junk I have on me.  That's mainly on me though.  I'm a packrat and feel that I need to loot the entire town before I can move on.
---
You would think so, but it appears they never implemented a way of seeing any player inventories.
---
I highly doubt it’s just RNG that’s boning people for loot. It has to be a bug.
---
Yea well explosive I have only found one of, good gun thou, lvl 40 quad combat rifle with ex ammo
---
It was never in the store.  Do not proliferate false information. 
---
So my understanding of the healing factor mutation (and please correct me if I am wrong because I am interested to know) is that the healing only works outside of a fight.
---
Which would mean the second that an enemy is close by the healing factor no longer works and you would get damage from the starvation, thirst and any damage from the enemy.
---
Just to clarify I dont have this mutation, I was just researching it to see if I want it. You really had to read the fine print for this mutation...
---
Sounds about right
---
After a month, probably answered. Basically its a sort of "cap"/"node count"
---
Food/Water are "Capped" productions as far as I can figure out.
---
As for Alum, Copper, Junk, Wood, etc(crafting materials) the number represents how many deposits are in the workshop. 
---
Terrible attitude...
---
290+ here and many of the areas can scale with the player count, plus helping others / lowbies can be shockingly rewarding..
---
I've been given more than a couple "GodRolls" (Including my current Anti-Armor, SwingSpeed, Reduced weight sledge) after "Shepherding" groups in WhiteSprings..
---
Plus you can actually spawn them faster with a group than you can solo   
---
I have my camp on the top of Senaca Rocks, thought I'd never have to worry about being unable to place the camp up there, but much to my surprise I've had a few times where there was already a camp there.
---
But I got some nice building ideas from the others though.
---
I Though it was only the fact that there were "suspect inventories" with thousands of gun, but if it's the action of duping who crashes the servers... Pf. It's just stupid. Thanks for your link and response. 
---
We don't know for sure that it works that way. The fact that Bethesda has been concerned about stash sizes indicates that items might have individual IDs.
---
Food that spoils definitely has individual IDs. If you eat a steak that is far from spoiling, you sometimes reveal a steak that has almost spoiled hiding beneath it in the stack, even though that's not displayed to the player beforehand.  That indicates that each food item instance requires a unique registry entry that stores a unique property: it's more than just a quantity appended to an item type. If food is stored with individual IDs, other items might as well for some reason that we don't know about (tracking purposes, opening up the possibility of naming items in the future, etc.) 
---
If a player leaves items in a container for another player to find and he leaves the lobby, do those items remain or disappear?
---
More like the universe. 
---
The question is can you prove it doesn’t?
---
Can you prove it doesn’t revolve around many things at once. Life is complex humans more so. 
---
Maybe you are the center and that’s why I’m replying. 
---
You will eventually get a mutation serum plan. Hope you get a good one. :)
---
/s ?
---
I love all Fallout games but this would be a personal choice.
---
Take FNV give it FO4 graphics and it would flog every single one of them by a huge amount for me. Even still in its current basic unmodded form i would say its my favourite of all of them.
---
76 is just unique since we can play with friends.
---
No, we (mod authors) added that as a possibility in Fallout 4 (The core of this game) but Bethesda didn't love the idea
---
Oh shit sorry I see. Damn I need that
---
It's not easy for Bethesda to do anything. They're clearly not in full control of the game or duping wouldn't still be such a massive problem.
---
Many games face this sort of thing early on and they all reign it in pretty hard but Bethesda seems mostly unmoved by it.
---
I understand that stagger is an effect and not a cripple so no it wouldn’t.
---
You're wandering from my original argument.  No one said you can't do those things, much less Bethesda.  When I responded I told you that you * ** WEREN'T ROLEPLAYING** *
---
If you wanna wreck camps, then do so acknowledging that you're doing so for the fun of being a douche.  Don't cover it up under the guise of *roleplaying* because that's just utter rot.  Man up and own your shit.
---
That being said, your backstory... well...  as a roleplayer and gamemaster for over thirty-five years, I'm going to be blunt.  It's weak sauce.  If I were critiquing your character, I'd say it needs to 'show, not tell', and illustrate through anecdotes and circumstances **WHY** your character thinks the way they do.  But you're not playing at my table, and I don't really care what you think good roleplaying is.  Because in the end, if I see you grief someone, I'll either claim the bounty or if I am just too tired to deal with juvenile inanity, I'll move servers and block you on my list.  *shrugs*
---
I plan to nuke all sorts of places for shits and giggles. 
---
It's really only worth nuking two places...but hey I want to see what happens
---
I’m actually jealous
---
My theory is as follows, get your tin foil hat ready haha. We are all an institute experiment designed to improve Synth combat a.i. The scorched represents the remains of humanity and the SBQ fight is training to take on the Prydwen.
---
No problem my man it effects everything in the game so i am happy to make sure everyone knows why.
---
And Welch 
---
Same experience.  I have a large 2 story house on a lake just south of lake eloise.  Floor 1 is 8-9 generatora (only had mediums at the time) and purifiers in the water.   Second floor is bed and crafting.  Loft.  Gorgeous view.  I only get the occasional dog or molerat.  
---
Alas, I may dismantle it soon.  Now that i know the joy of launching nukes solo I may go to a more central location to help grind to 50 (event travel cost and closer to whitesprings).
---
What enjoyment do people get from duping? There’s no point to even play the game when you can get anything you want.
---
I'm r/outoftheloop on this duping thing. What is it exactly?
---
Someone got big balls
---
Here's another shot from the same fight
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/stmZOHw
---
No, it isn't. Better than f4 though.
---
They presented the map and the concept as though people would be nuking wherever they wanted. I wish I had been on the map that are describing because I would have loved that game
---
Can also occur if someone is glitching / standing on objects that the queen can't Interact with (someone lands in a tree using Marsupial and Birdbones for example)
---
Hahahahaha!!!! Got wood?
---
I have a stack of 35 and a stack of 12 fusion cores so his stack of 77 is probably the closest thing to legitimate 
---
Someone nuked the edge of the map the other day just to troll 
---
It's like how do you unlock the car door if the remote key battery dies?
---
Do the next step
---
There are a few actually sold by bubbles in the 2nd floor of the resort.
---
I’ve done it twice in a row before and got rewards, did you check your inventory to make sure there was no new stable flux or a legendary you didn’t have before?
---
I'll buy your explosive Gatlin how much you want for it? 
---
Different flavors really.
---
New Vegas is a plot/narrative driven RPG game with a political intrigue storyline.
---
Fallout 76 is a sandbox survival game, with a rather bleakly atmospheric storytelling approach.
---
Unless you mean mechanically, then yeah. 76 isn't exactly hitting the levels of top tier shooters or action games, but its miles ahead of the clunky FO3/New Vegas days.
---
There’s pvp in this game?
---
Yeah, go upstairs to the Whitesprings bar. There are several unique varieties sold there including Grape, which removes radiation. Very useful with Cola Nut.
---
And I agree too. It takes away from the fun and the challenge, but it's the endgame.
---
Have it, but no mods exist that I know of.
---
Yeah, when I was running a glue farm I had soooo much corn, tatos, and mutfruit
---
Nah, not really. Just one-shots.
---
Is this serious? You’re saying someone is so desperate for necessities that they buy a console and buy fallout 76 and and subscribe to an internet service and dupe just to make ends meat? 
---
Really?
---
Sure! Msg me on xbox, i can do either the white powder or whitespring jumpsuit for it. Gt Maus86ed
---
Yes I got it to drop today.
---
Very artistic ... very well done!
---
/r/quityourbullshit 
---
Keep calling them out. Don’t let up!
---
There are plenty of us with 20,000+ burden on mules that aren't dupers but just insane horders.. 
---
I kept every legendary from from beta to level 255 for example, etc etc etc, all "muled" on alt characters and secondary accounts..
---
They need to fix the exploits, not penalize the player base 
---
I have a explosive combat that I only use on the scorchbeasts or to protect lower levels in nuked areas, bit other than that I use an explosive asssult rifle. It isn't the strongest as it boasts ~250/hit, but I have a lot more fun with it. 
---
Selling for real money currently 37 dollars for 25k caps, 15 dollars for basic TSE items up to 50 dollars for top tier ones with amazing third traits. Serums, stims you name it they all have prices and they do sell.
---
Even searching 76 on Ebay will list too many for sale.
---
I don't even play the FO games but I'm proud of you. As a girl gamer myself, I understand the flack when guys are better at certain aspects of games.
---
Im allowed to die to this boss 47 times  before I figure out the trick to the fight. Like screw off and let me enjoy my game, bro. 
---
Ban them all!
---
Okay tysm for the info!
---
Ex ammo?
---
They need a gift emote, have this problem all the damn time
---
People are duplicating items in Fallout 76. This can be done to all items as far as I know, including legendary items. This is causing crashing, stability issues, and ruining the player driven economy. 
---
Give it time, I'm hoping to see NPC's in the future if the do a progressive sort of story to the game.  
---
Like this here is chapter 1, just emerging from the vault and everythings fucked  
---
then theres chapter 2 where maybe all the scorchbeasts are confined to the mire, a few NPC travellers have started coming back into the rest of the map.  
---
Chapter 3, scorcheasts are basically all dead bar the odd 1 or 2 around fissure sites in the mire, the NPCs have now started to make small towns that you have to help them build (however this now re-introduces NPC raiders  
---
Chapter 4, maybe some big factions start coming out of the now small cities created by the NPC's with our help, raider problem if now worse...  
---
Ect...
---
What's to bullshit about that? F76 is riddled with bugs, common occurrence for many.
---
It is, the TOS is a legal binding contract 
---
No to actual clans and guilds. Yes to joining a faction in Fallout.
---
It is a bug, happend to a mate of mine when we were looting. We were with a farmer tho so he gave him his share. Nothing you can do tho. Occasionally when you kill something without loot, relogging onto that server will result in the loot spawning. Rarely tho, I lost connection once playing with a friend and I rejoined him and there was loot on a mega sloth we killed that wasn’t there before
---
Scorch Beasts level 50 and higher have a chance to drop Plans. Also the Scorch Beast Queen can drop them.
---
Sounds about right. My game locked up about a half hour/45 minutes later.
---
Fallout is a series I’d really like to be into but it’s a shame all of the games are dogshit 
---
Good for you. Glad you “took out the trash” twice. I teach my kids (sons and daughters) if anyone tells you that you are trash at something you love, you don’t need them in your life. Keep on trucking, friend. I’m also impressed, I’m lvl 34 with decent gear and I get routinely crushed by scorch beasts. I have to run and hide every time.
---
How about some game logic that looks for a ridiculous number of the same item and puts the dupers on the same server together every single time they load.  We'd never see them on our servers.
---
I appreciate your understanding of what I'm doing. 
---
Dogmeat
---
Fallout nv is a really bad game and giving fallout 4 graphics ain’t gone change that 
---
Next you’ll be claiming someone RP’ed at you.
---
Fairly average sized but my scrotum is quite loose 
---
Which goes back to my comment about tracking individual stats and conditions...wood has neither 
---
r/thathappened
---
Doesn't have to be, I've taken down the queen with groups of 4+ with zero TSE's.
---
Hell a standard 2 shot prime Gatling does insane damage to her, and I use a freaking dagger in close combat on her (not bloodied build) and typically due 1/10th of her health each time she lands (I am usually group less)
---
Someone nukeed whitesprings and not 5 mins after someone nuked it again. I was really hoping for a queen nuke when the second one was announced. 
---
Hahahahaha.... "is your character single?" This is either the funniest, or the saddest thing I've read this week.
---
Skyrim is better than fallout nv and Skyrim if fucking shit 
---
Well i believe 76 is to be Fallout Elder Scrolls Online. We should see Starfield next followed by Elder Scrolls six then possible another Fallout game.
---
Maybe 8-10 years from now based on their past history. Its why its really important that 76 succeeds in giving us content for years to come.
---
Link, source, or any proof? Just curious as I havent heard that yet. 
---
Never let anyone tell you what you can or can't do. When it comes to gaming play to your style and if someone doesn't like it, they don't have to be part of your world. That's the beauty of gaming. It isn't that those men were (are) competitive or whatever it's that they don't know how to be stand up respectful boyfriends and husband material. Never waste time on someone like that. Whether or not they game, a man should care about you, support what you do and cheer you on even when you fall on your behind. 
---
I'm garbage at many of the games I play. The people I surround myself with make it fun to do though 😏 
---
I guess they also hate the idea of a working game? 
---
Good on you
---
Report these guys every time you see them. 
---
Ok cool gonna get grinding then lol
---
Too man variables. Depends too on your endurance. 
---
I will say this though, I ran all over the place for quite some time relying primarily on occasional rad-x. 
---
I have 2 levels of rad resistance now, but only 1 piece of leaded armor, and I go everywhere, only rarely using power armor. 
---
You'll get a feel for it over time as you travel around. 
---
Yeah I've only ever killed one and that's because I hid and let the SAM do all the work for me
---
Yea I was just thinking that.  Even if they didn’t want to give us a building set, they could just give a bunker entrance that you place and then when you go in it’s a replica of a free state bunker just without all the decor so we could decorate our own.
---
Honestly, it's really short dude.
---
Both of them sound like r/niceguys 
---
People who rely on Chems and rushing in aren’t worth your time. I love the sneaking way. Makes the game so much funner
---
As are cats, Dogmeat ftw
---
Do we get a refund when it crashes?
---
Over never played on a server where whitesprings was nuked always cranberrybog
---
Fuck those zeroes, fam: go get yourself a hero. There's plenty of worthy partners out there for you: you just snagged 2 losses in the first rounds of your adult life .... keep it moving.
---
Lol I gotta remember that.  Unfortunately I usually get slapped around Flatwoods - the only one person closables I can think of is the PPS's on the road to Sutton
---
Sorry about that :( we just ended the giveaways. 
---
Keep telling yourself that.
---
I drop nukes in all different kinds of places to see what it's like. Because who knows what's in store. Most places are crap to nuke.
---
First time asking for help on here with fallout and I'm met with people not believing me? Seriously not farfetched at all, why would i lie about this? Lmao it's fallout.
---
bowler hat
---
well, there's the fact that as far as I can find, there are no other players having this bug, and the nature of this post which is basically begging for items that you "claim" to have lost. Additionally, you are asking dupers for help, and you are asking for some of the most powerful items in the game.
---
They are already here. We are the npcs. 
---
I see plenty of ppl play like that and in this game also. So you do stuff your own way long as you like it.
---
That mod also fits the dragon
---
What does X have to do with Y?
---
I'm glad that You liked so many stuff but I figured I'll reply for sake of bumping disscussion a little bit. (It's NOT a hate post - Just my opinion as reply to Yours)  
---
## The game looks absolutely fantastic 
---
Agree. I still think that Fallout 4 had better use of geometry and there were simply more things around you too interact with but F76 is not ugly by any means. Engine things aside - Bethesda has some great artists and level designers!
---
## Some toughts on socializing
---
Disagree with this part. Fallout was always about feel of being alone vs the world. And Fallout 1/2/3/NV were NEVER goofy, funny stories about bunch of people runnnig around dressed as santa.   
---
IMO Fallout 76 is great when I treat it like a spinoff. But if that's the Fallout we are stuck with for the next 7 years or so (and it looks like it... Starfield will be out around 2020/21 and ESVI around 2022/3 so... I don't expect new Fallout at least till 2024:() then I'm gonna be HUGLY disapointed. Fallout main series is gonna be always SP for me.   
---
But like I said - If Bethesda won't block conent for solo players (via coop only Raids) then I'm good with F76 for now. I really like it. 
---
## Fallout 76 brings new meanings for old stuff
---
* **Junk** I don't have problem with it as a concept but the way it's implemented in F76 is... Terrible. Due to the carry limitation your gameplay loop is this: Go to point A - collect EVERYTHING - Go back to work station - scrap all the junk - repeat.   
---
It's "two steps forward one step back" kinda thing. And it kills the sense of exploration due to it becoming tedious very quickly. Increase carry weight limit and boosting legendary weapons so craftings is OPTIONAL rather than NECESSARY would help IMO.
---
* **Settlements** \- Not a huge fan. But since it's optional I'm ok with it. I have simple settlement and that's all I need. I'm here to play post-apo aRPG - not city builder.
---
* **Food and other resources**: Well.. It's survival mode light. After 15h of normal paced gameplay you have enough food and water to never feel threatened so the survival aspect of food goes away rather quickly. I don't mind as IMO survival games are very rather boring when done badly so I'd rather have this than ARK clone.
---
## The online gameplay stuff
---
* **workshops**: 90% of the time I NEVER saw anyone giving a rats as\* about them. The only couple of time I saw anyone capturing them were low lvl players. Soooo... Not enough reward provided to be bothered capturing them.
---
* **events**: Well It's classic MMO fature so yeah - they are okey. 
---
* **nukes**: Now nukes are something I really dislike... But I'll get to that later on\*
---
* **the map**: Agree. I like how they managed the world. I like that it's small player count on one server and overall - I just like how the maps looks and feels.
---
* **economy**: I was never a fan of ingame trading as I always felt that it kills the purpose of looting the best weapons/armor for yourself. But again - It's MMO stuff and as long as it's balanced and optional. I don't mind at all. 
---
"So overall the game feels a lot like an social experiment." - I think You give it waaaay to much credit. It's fun game;) Don't read to much into it mate;)
---
# The Bad
---
* **NPCs** \- Yep. Stupid idea. And I disagree that it makes sense because... There ARE NPCs. Robots, computer AIs etc. To be honest I'm 90% sure that we will see human NPCs added to the game with some expansion. 
---
* **rebuilding Appalachia**: Agree. No sense whatsoever with this idea. All you do is kill, kill, kill...
---
* **bugs** \- Yup, and no, there is NO excuse. Zenimax is MASSIVE, billion dollar company. It shouldn't be this way!
---
* **server** \- Agree however that's the one thing I had little to no issues. (but that's just pure luck so I agree;))
---
* **settlements** \- I disagree as I don't want settlements to be permanent thing in bethesda/fallout games. It's cool feature but has not place in Fallout game as far as I'm concerned.
---
# Why the hate?
---
Dude, even tho I agree that game recieved some bad rep from people that never even played it I have to say - Defending multi billion dollar corporation that released full priced game FILLED with bugs and expensive af microtransactions is just stupid. The game is good. Atmosphere is IMO way more "fallout/ish/" than in Fallout 4. The sense of fear, dread etc. is back and I love it! It gives me hope that bethesda sill get what made Fallout so special. But there are some serious issues with this game and being vocal about it is the only way we let Beth. now what's what.
---
\***ABOUT NUKES!!**
---
Why I hate the idea? Fallout never treated itself to seriously but it was never "theme park" game. The entire idea of those game were about roaming around the world that is on the verge collapsing into the abyss. It was ironic, sarcastic but it never treated nuclear war lightly. Nukes were something scary, something terrible that destroyed the world.   
---
Giving them to the players as a gimick, as "cool new feature" takes away ANY gravitas they had. Now they are nothing more but means to gather some cool, new loot. That's it. 
---
IMO there are soooo many better ways to create endgame conent. You want randomly generated zone filled with radiation? Make radiation storms from F4 random, end game conent. Result would be the same but lore would be kept intact. 
---
Anyway - those are my thoughts. I like the game. I like the world way more than F4. I like that it's less goffy and "funny" than F4 map.   
---
I miss singleplayer experience and I really, REALLY hope that Bethesda will never block solo players behind some coop only conent.
---
Cool story
---
Mine actually went away when i closed app and restarted the game. 
---
The up keep cost is high on it and it's hard to get mods for. I don't use power armor often so the easier it is the better for me.
---
+Karma 
---
deathclaw, gulper, snallygastler, and mirelurk king require both 
---
I had a sorta similar issue happen to me on PS4. I was dropping things to help a friend and when I was finished there was no bag on the ground. Everything disappeared, including an E handmade, shielded vaultsuit and other goodies. I contacted bethesda but they say they can’t retrieve items in game because they don’t have the tools for it and some shit to do with the game engine. I call bullshit, final fantasy XIs engine could handle that and it was on ps2 and Xbox 360 lol. 
---
Interesting. Thanks for the advise, if it happens again I might just have to give that a try
---
Those quests are completely broken. They're often grammatically incorrect and there is no "next step" for the quest.
---
Once you disconnect or even equip the item it loses its "quest status" and you can drop it.
---
I love the meme.
---
Well thats like..... your opinion man.
---
We all have different tastes and every Fallout game well besides 76 has knocked it out of the park with awards each time. 
---
Its ok not to like one of them but FNV is beloved by many for its own reasons.
---
True 
---
I thought it was pretty heavy handed, but to each their own.  
---
I definitely know what I'm writing about (not talking), it's just that you don't like and/or agree what I'm writing so therefore, I obviously have no clue. That's funny!
---
On your comment, that you conveniently deleted, you wrote that you do actually dupe, and, since you obviously have nothing better to do, you're stalking me and commenting on multiple Whitespring-unrelated posts just to bash me further.
---
But please, do keep up, I enjoy responding to your nonsense. Much satisfaction!
---
Are you sure about that my dude? Check the comments.
---
I made a post with a few photos but not many and everyone in vault 96 was dead. There was also mob spawns inside of it which I’m guessing is what killed them. Another vault was burned down according to reddit a while ago and the 3rd vault was frozen. But I’ve only seen 96 the others I can’t verify
---
Because they were publicized while the staff was off for the holidays?
---
Are you new?
---
And what is this dev staff room?
---
What do you hate in a game sir? Do you hate games that are rushed, unpolished and with pointless mechanics? This question is not related to the thread, I’m just asking 
---
Hey I hope you don't mind if I add you too! I'm on PS4 as well! I love your story!! First good for you and congrats! Second you are better off without nah sayer guys like those! I'm hoping my wife will play one day too. But anyway when I add you we can meet up in all honestly I enjoyed your story so much and your determination to prove those guys wrong I would like to craft you a full set of Level 50, 160% Durability X-01 Power Armor, with Calibrated Shocks to add carry weight, Bright Head Light mod and maybe some more goodies. My psn is whiterabbitm1 hopefully we'll be wondering the wasteland together soon! Till then sneak your heart out! 
---
As a pistol build your disappointment makes me mad lol.
---
I'll sell for 1k
---
Wtf did I read? Is this r/gaming
---
lol.
---
Hell yeah. Go you. Fuck them.
---
This will be the final straw for Bugthesda, they can’t live without OP. Thank you for your sacrifice.
---
Wow, this was so nice to hear. Good luck in your future gaming! 
---
You can nuke almost anywhere you want
---
I’m dead lmao
---
I play this way. I have a couple of friends that dont and that shit pisses me off. You play the way that suits you best. If you're enjoying the game then you're playing it right. 
---
Wow. 
---
I'm ready to get rid of mine. With 8 shots, it would be amazing. 
---
exploding
---
Op is upset with the limited time items, not the entire cash shop...
---
Just completed mission, will launch in the next couple minutes 
---
yes exploding
---
It wasn't a mod?
---
I'm still waiting for almost a month to fix my water purifier duplication bug that is eating away 24% of my CAMP budget.
---
Those dudes sound like some jerk normies anyway 
---
I don’t know it just sounds like you have had a disproportionate amount of trouble with it. And yeah it would be discouraging and sucky so I hope you come out of it soon and seldom see it like the rest of us. On the flip side I saw my first nuke drop like last week and have only seen three total now. Which is exceedingly low apparently as I see people talking about seeing a few a day sometimes. Just my shit luck 🤷🏽‍♀️ I seem to always miss them. Hope things balance out for you. This is the only pvp game I play at all these days because the amount of people who only get pleasure from a game is by wrecking it for others seems to be growing 😒 and frankly I probably would have put it aside if I was having these issues like you are. 
---
I run two instances with two accounts from the same install and rarely crash.
---
4 hours? It's a lot less
---
Somewhere we're not supposed to know about go to I assume with all the things from the game available
---
I do the exact same shit except I use melee a lot because I’m shit at aiming (probably because of controller) so I’m constantly scrapping high level melees for mods and people keep telling me that it’s a waste to scrap weapons. The thing is these people also have 1000+ hours on fortnite and rarely play anything else so I don’t think they have an opinion in a game they barely play
---
I found plans for the MG42 in a safe once
---
Remind me why it's called MG42 in the plans while it's in the safe but Light Machine Gun in your inventory and everywhere else
---
Save early, save often. I'm an old ass gamer and u still remember the days when you needed to save every 10 minutes and rotate your save file names because games would crash constantly and there was a real risk of running into a bug that would completely break your game. Having a save from a couple of hours earlier to roll back to was mandatory.
---
It was like that in fallout 4. You could save scum to lock down a gun and roll through the effects. Usually it was only about 10 effects that were possible
---
Mmm i think its to do this type of thing. Don't ask me exactly how. But from talking to a few on these posts it has something to do with duped bobbleheads. Also remember slap damage is not capped damage so could really do some damage.
---
You rock dude, i mean girl,  i would love to know if this context were inverse this post would be this upvoted :P (just asking :P)
---
Such a broken game. Please issue me a refund! 
---
Alright that's a relief I guess. Sucks that it could even exist like that though...
---
This one didn’t 
---
This is fake. Karma pharma
---
I actually just got my girl an xbox for Christmas and we've played far cry 5 together to warm her up and yeah she annoyed me when I tell her left and she looks right but that's little stuff. We beat the game a couple days ago and shes playing by herself now and I had to switch it to easy and she got so excited when she cleared an outpost by herself. The whole point of gaming is team work and finding something you enjoy, our next game is 76 and I've been playing since beta and am currently level 160ish and I fully expect to just be building camps and taking things slow, if the excitement and joy of your partner having fun isnt enough then you're literal garbage 
---
Prepare for the reddit downvote brigade!
---
There is no next step that's the issue, it was just a mini quest leading me to that item
---
That's one dumb ass duper, multiplying bobbleheads and wood/leather.
---
Oh, your well-crafted argument has cut them so deep, sir. *Wounded them.* After I, -oh whoops- *they* wipe their tears away with the $2,000 dollars they may or may not have made over the week on explosive shotguns. A thing, they might add, that has no tangible value to any reasonable person but a cancerous, Pavlovian trained, microtransaction hungry fanboy that wants to be exploited. And a thing that will have no tangible value when the servers eventually shut down. They are just doing Bethesda's own hustle, but better. 
---
And when they do kill this game? And force everybody at Bethesda to do an objective autopsy on their complete failure, and you and I all get a *real* back to roots Fallout out of it as a result of the devs getting humbled? Will they even get a thank you?  
---
*I don't think so.*
---
Farm stuff people want and sell it on here. Making caps ingame takes forever. Find a good weapon and it could be 5-10k straight up
---
guys actually rib on each other like, all the damn time. kinda sounds her two exes just playfully teased her about being bad, which i do to my gf, and she does to me.
---
this girl just sounds super fragile and narcissistic or something, like i just somehow doubt her past boyfriends actually bullied her about sucking at games.
---
If you are talking about Marlo1979, his bug is different. He was dropping items intentionally, but they vanished. Also, you deleted your post...
---
I finally got a useful legendary (the first in 75 levels) - a furious combat rifle (was even a lvl 50).  After I slapped on a long barrel and suppressor, my stealth sniper is a little more happier today.  Now if they would just make a 2 shot hunting rifle.
---
Good on you for getting away from the toxicity and proving them wrong. There are a lot of different ways to play open world games like '76. It's kind of the whole idea behind the Fallout games; to play how you want to play. Congrats on the awesome kill!
---
Who cares if they're pissed, a minority of people are ruining the fun for a majority of people because of their own greed.
---
Screw them.
---
Make a daily vendor run to all 5 different factions, make 200 x 5 caps per day, sell rad aways, rad x, stempacks, menstats, bobbleheads, nukacolas. But what are you trying to buy?
---
huh? you can play fallout however you want, i never use sneak either.
---
Yes I deleted my post because I was sick of people not believing me. Kinda grinds your gears when people are hostile over a damn game. 
---
Good for you for getting rid of the parasites, that's pretty much the way I play every game. Stealth is my favorite form of combat because it is so fun and tactical. Yes it takes longer but it's more rewarding when done. I loot literally every building and just explore, even when I dont want to. Playing open world games takes forever for me and I dont regret it one bit. Theres nothing wrong with gathering resources and making yourself stronger and better equipped. Although the downside is I'm almost always way over leveled for the main story which is a bit of a bummer. If you dont think you're good at aiming, practice makes perfect. Hone your shortcomings into strengths, that's how every great gamer got good
---
Farming events. I can buy out most of the vendor caps daily just by selling high-value outfits, once you know where to farm them. Straight jackets, spacesuits, civil war outfits and hats, golf outfits, ranger outfits, etc.
---
Please report people like this
---
This dude is just entitled, it's a random mob in an online game, you have no right to tell me I need to let you get the XP just because you happen to be nearby. You'll find another enemy to kill. 
---
Posted exploits and promotes their use. Hate band wagoner. But I doubt I’ll get reasoned responses from someone who just used two by the book bullshit phrases.
---
I'd like to see nuked supermutants. 
---
This is the most awesome thing I've seen yet! 
---
Well done!
---
Good for you OP. I had friends in the past that used to shot on their GFs for not being pro level at games and I was always like, they are playing games with you... how is that not a win win?!?!?!
---
My wife and I play together every now and then but she gets hyper competitive lol! I think she nearly made a guest at our house who we had never met before cry a little or at least broke him a bit when we were all playing MK9 a few years back. It was before the Super Bowl and we were hosting a party and she was crushing everyone and this new Comer some of our friend brought along was a little too cocktail and she crushed him game after game, some times flawless kills, keep in mind she knows no combos and is just button mashing like mad. She's yelling in his face and mocking him with his own cocky words. It was truly glorious lol!
---
Anyway I digress... Don't ever let anyone, especially a man get you down just because you approach gaming differently. You're not out to be an e-sports player, you just want to have fun. Next time you're with a guy, use that as a determining factor to see if he's even worth your time. If he dogs on you or puts you down for gaming, chances are, he'll do the same in other aspects of life and relationship. So if you see similar red flags, send them packing because they aren't worth your time or energy or your tears.
---
Grats on y I ur Scorch Beast kill as well!
---
Yeah you get them asking you to go to Sugar Grove (one of the harder areas if you're low level) and for your trouble you get rewarded with either a pipe pistol or a piece of leather armor which is level 1.
---
This is why I’ve been playing the same character for well over a year on Skyrim. I’m determined to uncover every fucking thing I can do before I progress the Alduin line. 
---
Just shit people have sold. I found an explosive shotty at the watoga BoS vendor after a scorch queen for 230 caps lol
---
System?
---
Oh mybad i have a hunters exploding combat rifle that consumes 25% less ap in vats
---
Viet Cong, obviously.
---
Hell yeah, girl! Don’t need those jerks! If you had ps4 add me and we’ll make a kick ass girl party 
---
I'm waiting to not have invisible shots fired at me taking damage but no sound just my character grunting and losing health no disease no nothing then comes scorch boy with a shotgun that is more silent than a mouse. How should I know he was shooting me? Happens alot
---
It's supposed to be a joke. Because people still complain of some broken mechanics. 
---
It’s no longer legit when those 20 all are just repeating band wagon hate. Just cause everybody’s doing it and saying it doesn’t mean it’s right.
---
Just because it's not the depth of character you're looking for doesnt mean I'm not roleplaying. And in the end that is exactly what I am looking for other players to do. Kill me for caps because I destroyed their camp.
---
Sounds like your exs are just power tripping over video games that literally millions of people play. Good riddance it sounds like 
---
shadow, im sorry i looked at this after i turned the xbox over to the kids. i'll check with you tomorrow. my gt is joykill47.
---
I also have a bunch of water purifiers so I sell purified water for five caps a piece
---
did you make posts on reddit about how she teased you about being bad at games and did you get two gold?
---
Go home Todd, no one wants to buy Skyrim any more...
---
I agree it's objectively better... Huge map, multiplayer, a steady stream of cosmetics plus its a live title so there's a lot to look forward to down the road. 
---
And between you and me I never liked the thousands of npcs anyway... I found them cheesy and would be sick to death of listening to them halfway through. The nerds can keep their branching dialog, that shit killed the replay value for me. 
---
Subjectively 76 is my favorite but objectively it's just a better version of fallout in almost every way. 
---
I loved new Vegas and is probably the fallout I spent the most time playing. At least it's a living world and I quite enjoyed the soundtrack
---
I dislike the scan lines
---
id like a Marine Tactical mask aswell, i just cant find any, and the Wet suit neither.. could you craft it for me ? id appreciate it, i already added you, (princerevivaldk)
---
Really? Dangit I need to find another one than cause the bayonet actually does decent damage
---
Its because of lingering radiation
---
"Dude what are you talking about, they have no advantage over other people! duppers just ruin their own game"
---
Yeah right. 
---
The megasloths also drop like 5-6 screws on death
---
That’s not a bug. Sorry you lost your stuff but you did inadvertently damage an NPC in Whitesprings, literally has happened to everybody.
---
I have a TSE weapon and if the people are farming at the whitespring I don't use it (actually I probably wouldn't use it there anyway, there is something relaxing about using melee on ghouls :p  ).
---
So last night I am on a server that had the Whitesprings nuked and there is a lot of people around. We all run into the golf house or any of the other houses and everyone is hitting each ghouls once to allow other people to get a hit in. Now in a manic situation like that I figured it would be a mess but we all were just using melee weapons and sharing all of the kills around but it worked really well. If someone was away from the group they would throw up a "come here" emoji if they found another hoarde of ghouls. We were not a group, this was not planned, I dont know these people and we were even using microphones. This is just was it looks like when you have a bunch of people together that are dicks which made it a fun time. I noticed when a alpha glowing deathclaw showed up all of the explosive weapons came out so it's not that they didn't have them, they just chose not to use them.
---
After a while a group of other people showed up, all with TSE weapons and started mowing everything down and setup turrets at the back of the gold club and hogged everything and ruined the whole vibe of the game.
---
Just because you have it doesn't mean you need to use it, I got a lot more enjoyment from working with other people. If nobody else is at the whitespings then go nuts with your TSE...
---
I have a similar play style and there is nothing wrong with it! I have been avoiding the scorch beast because I’m only level 17, so I think you are awesome!
---
You are right, i have the mutation and that is how it works. Once you are in combat the healing stops, even if you sneak away you have to wait until thd danger/caution bar go fully white to hidden before healing starts again.
---
twisted muscles has no noticeable drawback for melee -- and it works with unarmed weapons too. I ran it from around level 25 to 46 and it's amazing. One shot people higher level than me in power armor with a dc gauntlet for instance. 
---
Now I have class freak I have added talons! Amazing. I am trying to decide whether to keep pushing for more, or got for all of them, or just enjoy the extra talons for a bit. But really it's 1 shot city in whitesprings.
---
Must have been someone else. 
---
To be fair, coming from PC to console, I was pretty bad until I got the new reflexes down. 
---
&gt;For example, apparently the second version of the Power Armor Station (the one that curves to the sides instead of over the back) simply does not work. It will take your power armor and then claim that "someone else is using the station" when you attempt to build or repair. It will not allow you to collect your armor from the station nor can you fast travel away because, "you cannot fast travel at this time."
---
While I wouldn't be surprised if people have experienced bugs with *anything* in the game, I feel the need to stop you right there.  I use this version of the Power Armor Station and it works just fine for me.  I've crafted armor on it, repaired armor on it, modded armor on it, everything.  No problems.  It works fine for me.
---
Were you alone? Was there anyone else around to take stuff? We killed her in a group of six or so last night and she was empty when I looted her but luckily there were other legendary creatures around to loot. 
---
Have someone commenting on everything I post bitching at me because I said kill em all. 
---
These quests suck. They only ever lead to weak items. Plus I suspect they’re recycled from FO4.
---
Shit I'm only level 48 and I've had it since release, I guess some people dont live on video games like you
---
So you just came here to complain about exes and brag about a simple kill? Cool
---
Repost? 
---
Absolutely agree. But, wouldn't it behoove us, who are tired of all the bugs, most of which are attributed to dupers, to at least give it an honest shot? 
---
1. Make a list w player tags, suspected alts...whatever your platform. 
---
2. Report them to Bethesda, Microsoft, Sony. 
---
3. Have a rotating team of high levels take them out.
---
4. Bring their loot to a designated camp. 
---
5. Scrap it all. 
---
6. Give scrap in server tolerant amounts to noobs. 
---
7. Lather, rinse, repeat until Bethesda actually fixes it. 
---
Fallout has so much to explore and experience, combat is just a small part of it, at least in my experience. 
---
just curious, but I wonder why it is so hard code wise to stop someone having stupid high numbers of some items. For example, the bobbleheads here. How long does 1 bobble head last? How many does 1 person reasonably need?  Why not hard code a limit?
---
Sole reason I bought 76 while on sale was with Hope's it would see a good turn around
---
Someone got hungry and cooked the potato...
---
Bro, server kicked me during her fight today, after we finally got her down just past half health, so frustrating.
---
Somebody nuked mamas food thing and I was like wtf 
---
No, I didn't. 
---
You say I'm stalking you, yet you're the one that's responding to a post i made days ago and "bashing me" with made up accusations. 
---
 I hardly ever ignore people but you're going on my list. If you respond, you'll be talking to thin air because I'm done with you. 
---
Yea, the results for doing this is a mixed bag. Did nothing for me personally for a different issue. The typical solution for me is asking the question: When was the last time you fully shutdown your ps4? For me, I typically put it in rest mode, but kinda rarely shut it down. After booting back up after a full shutdown, I haven't crashed in 2 days. Previously had been crashing 4-5 times a day for several days. Could be a weird memory leak issue or something.
---
Where should I farm that is reliable
---
I’ve given up on the game because of the bad apples like this, it’s not worth investing my time into anymore.
---
You can also use the marsupial perk with power armor.
---
These are some of the ones I’ve found and looked interesting enough to be part of my loading screen wallpapers. Last one I just couldn’t get a spot to get it on photomode.. very tight spot in valley galleria! https://imgur.com/gallery/vFzzzfe
---
You had me shit scared for a minute there where I was thinking I was the first '3 year ex', I'm sitting here thinking 'I might have joking told her she was shit at a game once but surely she didn't take it to heart' haha.
---
But it's all good, times don't like up, been with my current partner for 6 years now.
---
Play the game how you want to, that's the best thing about these games.
---
Try the Deus Ex games, they are good for a 'play it how you want' style, especially the first one.
---
dont blame the dupers, blame bethesda for the shitty code
---
I certainly hope so.
---
Wow, that would be very interesting!  
---
The lack of NPCs brings a lot of questions because indeed at one point in time people started to know how to survive and gather in all kinds of cities and groups. We are in a gap between populated times
---
the Vault Ambassadors of 94 left a year after the bombs dropped and was resealed
---
however 96 and 63 have remained sealed since the bombs dropped but judging by the rest of the game and the story residents are probably dead
---
Ah, I see you did specify MELEE weapon damage. I hadn't tried out Weapon Artisan on melee weapons yet, so I did so, and you're right. Went from 87 damage to 113. Nice! Thanks for the heads up; I'll edit my post above.
---
/r/upvotedbecausegirl
---
They are terms and conditions not a law.
---
You’re account can get banned from the game, worst case scenario.
---
Woohoo! Thank you, thin air.
---
It's like the skyrim joke.
---
Want to start a new game as something different.
---
Create a build for double handed axe.
---
End up sneaking and shooting arrows for the 35th time.
---
Fucking great my dude
---
And what have we learned? 
---
Yep, OP is penalising legit players with their proposal.
---
PC xbox or ps4
---
Thankyou this will help
---
Nuke zones for legendaries. 5.56 ammo always sells. Springs sell. Just look at the subreddits and see what people are looking for.
---
That’s probably what they enjoy about it. Thinking they’re edgy “trolls”
---
There are two good ones in glassed cavern. Already mentioned is the bear holding a human arm plunging out a porta potty. I neglected to take a pic of that one.
---
The other I did capture. One bear floating on a board n some toxic water and two more on the shore holding out a pick axe to try to rescue him. They are all wearing miner hats.
