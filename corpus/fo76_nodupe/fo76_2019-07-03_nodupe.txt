If that doesn't work I suggest going to the trading sub that rhymes with park it 76.  You can get some deals on them there or trade scrap for them.
---
---
---
Soooooo what time is the reset?
---
Sometimes it's bears, snallygaster, super Mutants, scorched, anglers, mirelurk Kings!
---
That’s true. If you start doing it all the time though it gets old very quickly, but you do you!
---
I’ve been through the process and I agree it’s fun! But personally never launched one on my own lol
---
Yes, more INT = more XP, with diminishing returns the after you get your INT past around 30.
---
you make a blueprint in adventure mode, and they can be deployed in NW. some items are not allowed though, like turrets. or Punji boards
---
Piss off so was his post. Nobody cares if he wants to leave like I dont care what your saying
---
I have a solution to the public team problem go inside a private interior and then try to make a public team it works for me
---
I'll be totally honest with you i don't understand half of what you typed, i'm not a native speaker. 
---

---
But yes, you require to play everyday now to keep up with the Season system. People that can only play during the weekends or only a few days a week have no reasonable way to keep up with the Season and require to spend money if they want to make it to the end.
---
12pm EST
---
Thank you for the acknowledgement!
---
Yea I have a few of them. During Xmas I ran around with a blue print that was a sleigh with rein deer... I dressed as santa and waved to everyone. Won a game doing this!
---
I’m on PS you are welcome to have some of mine :)
---
Happened to me earlier too. I was switching back and forth from a heavy weapon quickly and it randomly happened.
---
I picked up FO76 for the first time a few weeks ago and can't put it down. It's super fun to play if you get a couple of mates to play with
---
You could replace the word 'wastelanders' with 'Shadowkeep' and post this comment verbatim in the Destiny sub, and it would get upvoted.
---
Did you definitely not get the score or could it just be that the HUD didn't show it adding on? 
---
I did Line in the Sand on day 1 and it procced twice for me, including the HUD. Although it may have been more than 5 minutes apart.
---

&gt;Please note that sometimes the UI may take a few moments to update. 
---
Would they be able to add a cooldown with a hotfix? Maybe in response to people reportedly hitting rank 100 using an xp exploit?
---
Medic build here - I run the chemist backpack mod (which is a raider gold bullion item though) mostly because my regular team just throw all their stims at me to carry them. me using stims is way more efficient for us than them using a stim. I dread to think how overencumbered my character is without it. 
---
however I think the high capacity backpack mod is probably the most useful overall, second being rad resist or armored.
---
I generally mark all my ammo down to 1 cap, missiles to 10, nukes to 50 or so.
---
For legendary, everything is sub 150 caps. It's just a game. Can't take it with me.
---
Yes but if you vats exit and  re enter  vats , it will fix it. Gun fu helps too
---
Is it possible to donate stimpacks to your cause? 
---
Don't rly need them for my build and I can get the daily vendor caps without selling them. 
---
Right now I'm short on stims cuz i sold them but if I stock up a few I can donate them.
---
Atleast 4 or 5 snally gasters everytime at trainyard. Yes every single time.
---
Also agree on Abandoned Bog Workshop. Climb to top of the tallest building, using the fire escape, and drop down the elevator shaft. There's an office room with a bunch of typewriters, fans, and globes.
---
To also answer your edited question; out of the 400 games i have played or tested in the past few years, i have not seen a battlepas system this strict to complete.
---
Then I should be alright, thx
---
added 
---
imma rob him
---
I think I may have experienced this as well earlier, I actually ding'd twice during the match and only got the score for one and I know I had to hit 10k at least 3 or 4 times to level up twice.
---
Guess I'm going to have to pay more attention and make sure I'm not getting screwed out of more points here.
---
I'm probably miss remembering, I'm level 190.
---
Tried the bashing one in vats with full charge, prime receiver, the works, full shotgun perks cards and skeet shooter on a legendary SB and only hit about 1/3 of the health bar.
---
Lol that guy is def cheating.
---
i have the minigun plan and i recently bought two modules, all i have to do is go craft the mini gun?
---
Come see my camp if you’re on Xbox - NeonPinkIcon 
---
I try to sell everything super cheap so maybe someone else can resell and make a profit
---
Im asking cause im not on right now, but where do you see zorbos game piece
---
Rather than fix the FAQ, just add another weekly repeatable for public events. Lots of players at these events makes doing them a lot more fun and the game more engaging as a whole. That keeps people playing, and isn’t that the point?
---
Grinding XP endlessly for 10 weeks is going to burn players out and isn’t done efficiently in groups. SCORE for public events is absolutely necessary to keep this thing fun. Don’t look into doing it in the future, just do it. Even if it takes a few weeks to get it in, it’ll still make people happy.
---
Not unattainable. Just a bit disrespectful of our personal lives ha.
---
Same, just completed a weekly and didn’t get anything.
---
Welcome to the world of the Gauss Gunslinger.  Hey we added a super powerful silenced energy weapon with a large magazine size, but it will always miss on the first shot in VATS.
---
At least it’s consistent.
---
Yeah I don’t recall seeing it
---
I have gun fu at max. I’ll try that though. It would be nice if they just fixed it
---
Had it's uses. The mystery pick is good for new players to get both gear and armor at a discount overall, and easily replace their scrip.
---
This now confirms that Fallout will require DAILY play to achieve the rarest items/best rewards.  (As apposed to allowing the same progression for people who can play in big chunks every so often, or even every couple of days) 
---
Isn't that an issue when it comes to things like gaming addiction? People with those pre-dispositions will be (irrationally) scared of missing the dailyies in fear of missing out on the high rank rewards.
---
Don't get me wrong, I've been playing daily for a while now (after a long break to play other games), but it strikes me as something that could be a problem similar to the gambling issues with loot boxes in other games.
---
Are there other games with daily play requirements and no chance to make up the difference and achieve the same rewards if you miss a few days?
---
See the "How to Sustain Fusion Cores" section in my [How to Build: All Weapons](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/g3c20n/how_to_build_all_weapons/) guide.
---
If you use Full Charge 2 strength perk (available at level 33), and follow the tips for avoiding fusion core drain, you can have a single fusion core last *forever*.
---
That's IF that week happens to have a repeat xp challenge. It could change to something like, do X public events or something...
---
There’s a lot of us kicking around.
---
I haven’t played since the patch. 
---
Do I have to claim the ammo converter in the atom shop or something?  It’s only there for a limited time?
---
It's a blue rocketship and it pulsates blue.
---
I'm a bit biased due to being a PC gamer since dinosaurs still roamed the earth and computers were coal powered.
---
Text chat wouldn't or shouldn't be mandatory on all platforms (were they ever to implement it) and would end up being just another form of communication. Don't like it, don't use it. That's how I view the mic.
---
And the lack is both glaring from a technical perspective (every MMO I've ever played has had text chat, as have some of the shooters) and offensive to people who can't use mics for whatever reason.
---
Frog leg 40mm grenade spam, basicly every NW 100+ player.
---
Same, Acorncadet. I’ll start throwing them in my vendor for 50 caps. I have pretty high luck and usually get them at max condition but I also throw them on the ground because I don’t use them.
---
holy shit you did it! you should submit this to bethesda so they can pay you for your hard work!
---
I got a bunch during the Wastelander foundation questline. Stealth suit one.
---
&gt;It's a blue rocketship and it pulsates blue.
---
They've reimbursed Atoms when you provide a screenshot.  But you need to open a ticket.  Hopefully they'll offer the same reimbursement for SCORE, too.
---
Why does it look like I'm not getting S.C.O.R.E. points in Fallout 76?
---
We are investigating an issue where some Weekly Challenges are granting their S.C.O.R.E. rewards at 3 of 5 completed instead of 5 of 5 completed. In these cases, you are still getting your S.C.O.R.E., but you have already received it by the time you have actually completed the Challenge, so it will not display an updated score when you complete 5/5 on the Challenge. This will be resolved in a future update. 
---
Please note that sometimes the UI may take a few moments to update. 
---
If you are experiencing an issue where you are not getting your S.C.O.R.E. points other than the above mentioned reasons, please submit a Feedback report here under "Quests". Make sure to include screenshot(s) or video of the S.C.O.R.E. and Challenge that you are reporting.
---
Don't you just change the stock?
---
My team had the same problem with Heart of the Swamp last night. Flower closed and didn’t spawn any minions. Stayed closed the rest of the event.
---
Most people who have optimized combat builds will not be able to use any of the weight reduction perks, so those would be welcome, or Inspirational and its xp bonus would fit any playstyle.
---
I must be mistaken then, my bad!
---
The Imposter doesnt count towards cryptids. It does count as killing an assaultron in the weekly S.C.O.R.E challenge for killing different robot types though, so its not a total waste. 
---
Your best bet is to hit up either Toxic Larry's in the Mire or the Flooded Trainyard that's east of Watoga. Both have enough snallygasters. Queen of the Hunt also guarantees a cryptid.
---
Not for the OP; if you noticed the provided screenshot, you'll see that it shows 2 1k challenges completed but only 250 SCORE accumuldated.
---
He started halfway done for me. He is just the other side of the black hole.
---
I can do that for Non legendary ones to make them rifles, but I can’t for legendaries for some reason.
---
Actually that would be kind of neat, especially if each is themed.
---
Give us the confetti plans 'cause they missed out for this one.
---
Season 2 could have dead leaves because it's Autumn, or something appropriate to whatever the season's focus is.
---
Season 3 could be snowflakes or appropriate.
---
Lather, rinse, repeat.
---
That's the problem ... there's no other multiplayer online game in the Fallout universe like 76 ... no competition so even less motivation to fix things quickly.
---
Why would you want it upped its not like you get anything decent for scrip out of 1000s of scrip the only decent thing I've had was a 2 shot bloodied handmade
---
As a PA / Heavy Weapons build, I can understand your pain. To reduce FC usage, I fully equipped the Power User perk. This makes even the jetpack very energy efficient. I mostly use the Scrounger perk to get like 2-3 fusion cores off ammo boxes in 1 day. To farm Fusion Cores, I use the private world, take 2 plants, do my dailies and quests and just go and harvest them over time. I‘m always selling 5 or so in my CAMP near the Top of the World. 
---
Edit: oops, didn‘t read your full post. Excuse me!
---
Yay! I did mine for the first time at about that level with the stealth armor. It helped me immensely when having to repair everything so many times. I’d tried once before the armor was added and was killed way too many times.
---
Great song all around
---
I tried NMS about 6 months ago. Fun but too grindy and random for my taste.
---
This is one of the few areas I trust the devs on, but not in a good way. The game is so fragile and the netcode so bad that cataloging that many more items would break it. I completely buy into it, but it's just sad that this is accepted fact and not derided as embarrassing in a full price AAA game.
---
That said, they probably had an idea going in just how badly the game handles a large stash. Why not make the scrapbox from launch? Or categorize stashed junk as not weighing? Or not charging a full MMO price for it?
---
I can't find a game that scratches this itch, especially the building. I love my little Whitespring B&amp;B/shop. I put some solid effort into making it both aesthetically pleasing, helpful and easily accessible.
---
Yeah, I started gaming on PC back in the late 90's. Quit around 2015ish. Use to be a hardcore PC master race douche, but as I've aged, console gaming is less of a hassle. No more worrying, as much, about security, or individual drives and components updates or upgrades.
---
Gaming is my escape now, so the less issues, the better it is.
---
That's nice of you.
---
I went to a very, very nice place today, guy had a dining room, vending machines set behind.. windows? Bank walls? Whatever that let you access it through the window.
---
All ammo for 1 cap a piece. After getting very little ammo from the converter (I'm brand new) this was a godsend.
---
Atleast he was in house so I could wave :)
---
My main is a medic - I built it up with a group of friends who mostly don't play anymore - and I ended up dropping my CHA down to 12 as well. I pretty much had two CHA loadouts, one for the medic build itself, another for when I was soloing 
---
With the introduction of public teams though, it feels like it might actually be worth me dusting off the medic loadout again.
---
Could be great.   Most likely will be disappointing.  I'm watching it regardless.
---
I’ll second this. Don’t go crazy on legendaries and weapons until you’re around level 20. Go melee-based until you start being able to use the better guns
---
One guy suggested it should be a vendor with selling things for the ammo currency and buying back with the same currency and I honestly love the idea
---
This happened to three of my weeklies and they have not responded to my tickets. Made me mad because I was excited to do the battle pass but now I’m started at a 3000 score deficit in a pass that requires me to not miss a single point if want to complete it
---
You should be able to just add a stock, you might need a science perk on to do so. Or you have an ultracite laser and need to learn the ultracite laser mods.
---
I haven’t even claimed it yet lol
---
It has to rate better than the fan made Nuka Break series to be worth a look.
---
Try this, I had the same issues and resolved it after many many edits .. you may want to remove the  fVanityModeMinDist=150  though as you may not like that

He’s at chapter two for me
---
I use my PC for too many things to even consider giving it up in favor of a console. At least this way, my lifelong gaming addiction is SLIGHTLY less obvious ;)
---
That and the fact that I've never been able to comfortably use console controllers for a long stretch, even when I was younger. Damn tendonitis.
---
Omg I’ll walk around and collect junk too! I’m a wife player so we are triplets! I like the teddy bears and Mr Pebbles has all my love. I started as Melee since I legit did not play Xbox besides Skyrim.
---
Every twenty minutes is an overstatement, but alot! My group, everyone expects bluecreens and other disconnects. Don't know about the masses, but the 30 to 40 people I keep in touch with all have problems.
---
Friend is using this build. He has got Luck 15 with all Critical perks, and he is using all Rifle perks. He does not use any chems however.
---
Im not sure tbh lol, it's hard for me to tell whats good and what isnt but they definitely are amazing either way.
---
Y'all got what you wanted can't complain now
---
[removed]
---
I am on pc. Wasteland-Wizard. I run a Dollar Store. I sell everything for 1 cap. No more. 
---
Also I usually spend time looking for low levels -10 and make and give them stuff for free to get them started right. Fun stuff really.
---
Absolutely. Westworld was really good. I just love post apocalyptic stuff. Even if it's bad, fallout 76 for instance. Zing! Jk
---
Try not to die
---
I play every three days for about 8 hours.  I'm just doing what I can do and enjoying the game.  Trying to actually keep up seems like work.  It isn't detracting from my experience, but I am not getting much from it.
---
Nah, that's Games for Gold, or something like that.
---
Gamepass is more like PS Now except you can download them instead of stream them. It's a subscription service to play anything in their library which changes with games added and removed, sometimes before you finish them (RIP Metro Exodus playthrough)
---
If I leave unused ammo points on the machine, can other people use them? That’s the only reason I could think for locking it.
---
Same! The stealth armor made all the difference in the world!!!
---
If Amazon aren't assholes and decide not to put it out in my country, sure :p
---
We here at Hunts' Sporting and Hunting goods ™ recommend uses those to give back to the community. Find someone who is a lower level or put them up in your vending machine for free, someone out there fresh from the day's hunt is sure to have a couple scrapes and bruises and a nice old Stimpack is sure to bright up their day!
---
Lmao were not gonna make it boys
---
maybe you have a ultracite laser gun? for some stupid reason ultracite laser guns and normal laser guns dont share mods.
---
Just tried at 9pm. Still booked. Very strange. I can see the gore and such are in the basement if I glitch the camera through the door.
---
Same, just walked up on my heavy gunner and it triggered. My main? Nighttime and still "Sorry, we're fully booked".
---
I'm both excited and a bit bothered, I got it on the steam sale for myself and GF a couple days ago. I already sub to PC game pass.
---
Ah well :-/ I got the Raider/Settler bundle anyway.
---
On the plus side, it means I can introduce my Gma to 76, I got her Game pass for No man's Sky and this is a huge side benefit.
---
YOU THE REAL MVP
---
Stay with your team. Don’t spawn in on top of each other, but spawn close. Loot and then stick together. 
---
I’m not great at NW, but just staying together has drastically improved my experience and my Overseer rank. It’s a whole lot more fun too.
---
Same server on two characters with two different results. It's very odd indeed.
---
There are at least a dozen PA spawn in te forest alone. 
---
THeres also several static spawn point for cores.
---
I find them in ammo boxes.  Events like line in the saNd award them.  
---
For longevity, get the power user perk (Although I don’t think you re eligible for that until L50)  Does wonders for core life.   
---
If you use VATS a lot, it alos eats cores, as does the jet pack mod).
---
I just went to Morgantown and got a fresh set of these parts to test for you. They went into my display (the same one you posted below) without any issue. If you didn't scrap your jars maybe try getting a new copy of them. There shouldn't be any issues with them.
---
Riding Shotgun has been buggy as well.  They go into the door then aren't there when I load in.
---
Not really rare. The dragon really sucks imo

Hmm.. I’ll have to check this out, thanks! That is super lame haha
---
I’m gunna have to check this out, thanks!
---
Take a look at that .. according to a couple of buddies they had the best improvements in performance when they lowered the texture settings and the shadow distance .. the above link is the ini settings I use (Fallout75Custom.ini) for my inferior machine
---
This is the best suggestion I’ve seen! Would make seasons more unique too if those special challenges were relating to the overall season theme.
---
There definitely is lol ;)
---
I'd like to hope so, but their offshore customer support just replied with a generic "You're getting your SCORE at 3/5 instead of 5/5 but you got it!" - not reading a thing I said about how it's dailies autocompleting. :(
---
With copyrights and patents I'm pretty sure BGS is stuck with their engine until they create or buy out a better one. I see people all the time complaining that Fo4 had unlimited stash space why can't 76. Fo4 didn't have unlimited stash. If you put like 1500 individually named items in a workshop they game would crash. Same engine, same issue times 24 per instance.
---
The junk having weight, even stored, is a "survival" mechanic. Same with inventory management. Annoying, but part of the "immersion".
---
The 100 a year deal cuts the sub price in half, or close enough. It's by far the better deal. I had no issue dropping 100 on it, when there are/were only like 2 games I was interested in this year. Game selection over all has been pretty lacking for the last few years for me.
---
Plus, I can skip over a fast food meal once a month to cover the price.
---
I’m ShinyKittySurprise in game.  I usually nuke the Queen at least once a night, more if I have time.  Happy to set you up with a better rifle.  Maybe do a silo run together if you want.

I know and understand. As your suggestion in your op isn't implemented and unlikely to ever be implemented my suggestion is as close as you will get.

the sub through steam needs the steam version to show up. same if you have the non steam version you need the non steam sub

Needs to be on steam  won’t show up on the other

DEMOCRACY IS NON-NEGOTIABLE

yes
---
My PC is used for too much sensitive stuff to be open enough to game on. It's not even on the same network as my other devices. *sigh*
---
This is hilarious. Maybe people just couldn’t bear to shoot you haha
---
I’ll give that a shot now that my dailies have reset. Thanks for the tip.
---
O good call but I feel like that one will be a constant or at least I'm hoping
---
This is crazy, that's some extreme effort with very very little wiggle room. I'm lvl 13, I'm not making 40k exp a day lol
---
I've gotten a whole 6k exp since the event began and I've done all the dailies so far.
---
If I get about 5k experience a day, I'll make it lol
---
I hadn’t seen that. My auto weapons like to force a reload when there is still ammo in the mag for me.
---
I keep one character slot open just for level up challenges. It takes 20-30 minutes at most to leave the vault, run down to Flatwoods, and complete the first couple responders quests to get to level 4 or 5. NW level up challenges are similarly easy.
---
Yes, it's cheesy, but it's a heck of a lot faster than leveling up a 300+ character.
---
With a full building crew, a full set of unyielding and under armor. I easily above 25 int... before food/drink/drug boost.
---
It’s a known repeatable bug. I personally use it often with my tse handmade just cuz I’m a wee bit trigger happy. It is very easy to do which is why it just kinda happens to some people when fast swapping between a heavy weapon with a large clip and another weapon.
---
Dm me your name I’ll add you
---
Yeah i went to that location in the toxic valley with the grafton monster and two snallygaster near the crashed vertibird myself.
---
Yes you can
---
High Capacity is a must for the Hoarder build. I haven't tried any others.
---
Hmm... so not a big fan or EARN IT, eh? ;)
---
same here any fix for this?
---
?
---
I noticed the issue this afternoon. Everything was fine this morning. Xbox also.
---
After leaving a month or two after launch, I recently returned for wastelanders. I gotta say, I'm impressed with how far its come and the attitude of the project team. I was sure they would have given up on it. It's nice to see them take on the feedback and make changes as required. 
---
I'd like to see the ammo converter set up so that you can pick an ammo type, and then you can dump in ammo one side. (Like a trade menu) then it automatically converts it all to your specified ammo type which you collect at the other end like the ammo factory or ammo fab unit.
---
The anti-encryption "won't somebody PLEASE think of the children" bill that just passed a senate judiciary committee.
---
It’s a bit buggy as of now, sometimes it will let me fast travel and sometimes I get the “you cannot fast travel to a workshop you do not own” message.
---
Yall on xbox I'm more than happy to help with gear mats or stims. My wife started off slow but she's almost to lev 50 now so tell her to stick with it
---
Probably heavy, iirc though it’s in its own armor class
---
Why aren't there community projects for Crater and Foundation???
---
Thank you for the solution! I am already addicted to that sweet sweet xp boost from a building team and want it back!
---
Scorched earth, literally an event (that's public) that requires the site to be nuked to start. Learn to manage your shit or lose your 20 extra special with an OP build. And since you wanted to ask I have a power armor heavy weapons build and a bloody stealth rifleman both of which work fine in a nuke if you can pay an ounce of attention.
---
Sturdy. When u craft it on the bench, its listed as sturdy.
---
Don’t use it, ask group members to not use it
---
Ah thanks
---
I tried that just now. It didn’t reset it.
---
Thanks... Is there an easy way to copy my Beth install into the steam directory so I don't need to download 80 gig?
---
Totally
---
But public group members have it on and they don’t communicate.
---
I haven’t used it yet it’s too high of a level, but I’ll remember that
---
&gt;And people love that wannabe Fallout
---
Maybe because its more Fallout than anything Bethesda produced. People are willing overlook bugs and poor visuals when theres engaging gameplay to be had.. F076 has none.
---
Tell me if I’m wrong but isn’t it only ur teammates that it works with. Just tell them to not use it
---
I used to store plungers in mine and also had one dedicated to handcuffs .. next to the bed ofc
---
I had a super sledge with the rocket mod on my wall. There is fire coming out (not animated though). I think that might suit to your cigar. Best placed on a wooden wall of course!
---
Yes but with the new public groups, this is becoming a real problem. They don’t communicate or don’t listen and just completely screw up my build.
---
I’m on PS4 and always just go to social, then team, find my name click on it and click leave team :)
---
I am not seeing the other issues, but I can’t create a new public group either. Xbox.
---
I don't think this is true. That cheating blighter is already a third through the board on day 3/70. 
---
However this would of been an amazing feature if Zorbo auto unlocked the score and was a real time analog of where you could be with the challenges.
---
So does the +vats hit chance, I think.  I bbn know that works on weapons with fast fire rates.
---
Yes! You keep everything except the ability to use the survival tent /add to the scrap box but everything in the scrap box can be used without 1st being active ☺️
---
Total over several matches.
---
Oh. I haven’t played in a few months so I didn’t know. That definitely sounds pretty annoying bc I was a bloodied build
---
He just get sad sometimes
---
Well, fuck. I haven't heard about that. Politics are even more shit now than they were.
---
But no, I'm not a fan of privacy invasion at all.
---
I understand people use it for nefarious shit, but not the majority of people. 
---
Just more control of the whole brought on by the few.
---
This quest was bugged for me, both an albino deathclaw, and a angler worked as "cryptids".

All of really needs is a "repeat" button that was spam. Functionally the UI is garbage, but it's very inline with the fallout universe.
---
ohhhh that makes it much easier, haha
---
Damn straight. And always under the guise of protecting children... despicable misuse of a real issue.

---
So we're just supposed to lick bethesda's boot?
---
I’m a high health melee build using vanguard armor and two mutant secret service pieces. I’ve got barbarian and adamantium (spelling?) cards maxed out. I’m sitting on 590 DR and 600 energy resistance
---
I’m still trying to find ways to make that increase lol. I say keep going for high defense because it makes every aspect of the game easier for me lol
---
Also I don’t use PA unless I’m in a nuke zone
---
I’m going to be completely away from home and a game system for about two weeks. Rip Season 1 I guess.
---
Not really fine. The time investment for the current rewards is WAY too high.
---
Either needs to be much better rewards or much much less time investment. I'm not grinding for 60days just to complete the legendary run.
---
I can complete the season pass in Destiny 2 in a week of comfortable grinding. How are people just OK with this?
---
With Class Freak its barely noticeable
---
Or maybe they should fix the damn game and also because people have the right to complain about new shit they mess up. Is that boot tasty?
---
And the Grafton monster :)
---
Massive QoL improvement for me, but I'm low INT. 
---
Could you fit Class Freak 3 in to Luck? Then it would only be -1 Int for marsupial.
---
All the power plants have workshops that supply fusion cores. If you capture all of them and active their extractors, within an hour or two you’ll have more than you know what to do with. Only downside is the extractors require 100 energy to power. 
---
However, complete powering Poseidon/Monogonah and you’ll get that output (100 energy) for free.
---
Take one of the three Power Plants on the map and power it up. Then link the power box to the fusion core generator. Free cores. 
---
Even better if you use first because no one can contest it. If you don't have first see if a friend does. If no friend own first then try to avoid Posidien. Weirdly enough Monogah and Thunder Mountain don't get pestered the same.
---
Oh Boi, I remember my Ragnarok Online days now... One month grinding just to raise level 99 to 100...
---
That’s what I’m trying to get started. Everyone is set for events which is fine but half the servers I’ve been on are dead and the “events” groups/group leaders aren’t even going to events.
---
It's not possible to make content at the rate we can consume it.
---
It’s technically not a new problem, but with the public teams it’s just a thing. Seems most pub teams don’t use mics (or they’re in their own PS4 party), so they can’t hear you.
---
They shouldnt be....but theres some crazy stuff floating around....
---
For me they seem to work the first time I join a server when booting the game. However going to the menu or joining a friend or new server it bugs out.
---
Didn’t realize it was wanted to be gotten rid of.
---
Yeah I havent been able to travel since that dude in the post mentioned it lolol
---
You cant really. If someone is using it when you join a group, just leave and join another. Or start one yourself and kick people off using it. Its going to take a while for word to get around about the new etiquettes of public groups and perk sharing but I feel it will be less of an issue going forward
---
nice
---
absolutely
---
Can you just not join the public teams?
---
The etiquette thing is a good point and serves other purposes. Good call.
---
Well yes but it’s the new fun thing.
---
That's 100% a ball and you won't convince me otherwise.
---
It’s a different game without it, definitely worth it.
---
Haha got mine saved but literally seeing people pop them for no reason xD ended up with a 75% AFTER free range ended. Can't complain though now everything blows up with confetti haha
---
Love that people downvote me for being legitimately critical of a flaw in this game. The circle jerk in this Reddit produces enough fluid to drown a small child. When I send a friend request, they need to add me back since it doesn’t show up in their friends list like it used to. When someone sends me an invite and I hold down the button to accept, it puts me over the wrong friends name.  These issues are constant.
---
I almost got that to go w the red, white &amp; blue Helvetia garland.
---
Yes, seems to be in public servers as of the moment
---
I had a day one tank build. High endurance/agility/strength. Problem was damage output. Went with unarmed enhanced with mutations. Discovered the benefits of unyielding armor. Full set with armored backpack. Start full health and as the battle goes on the stronger 💪 I get. It evolves into bloody...It's my most OP build, to the point of boredom. Since the introduction of the stealth suit. I can survive nuke areas as a heavy weapon swap.
---
Thanks!
---
How are you liking it?
---
Just started playing FO76 again don’t really know what’s going on, brief explanation?
---
The math saying you couldn't miss a day is highly debatable and with a double xp weekend you can catch up.  I think they just put him there for everyone.  Level 10 is good...that's 3+ levels a day and you have 10 weeks to finish you'll get there!
---
It's very fun tho. I highly recommend using it for a bit. It's not a good weapon tho, unless its legendary, which you cant get anymore
---
Oh please your opinions have no more right to be expressed here than Op's do, nor are you in any position of authority. The least you could do is learn to write and spell a bit better.
---
But why is no one talking about it /s haha
---
Thanks for the wiki I think I might buy it now
---
I understand you think its “fair to spawn players in a nukezone” and the result of non- rad defence prepared equals death.      
---
       
---
But this doesn’t only effect scorched earth. This will effect any event with auto spawn near a nuke zone or anything else deadly. And the sad thing is, you usually have to quit the game. Theres no way to stop constantly dying and respawning once it begins.         
---
        
---
Your point is flawed because the respawning+death sequence is EVIDENTLY not intended. I do not need to dance around reddit comments to explain to you that BGS Doesnt deliberately create a feature that kills people trying to respawn.     
---
      
---
You clearly really hate the people dying in nukezones for some reason due to bugs with respawning, and are arguing for this to stay, for clearly a disgruntled reason. Good on you.
---
Become one with the bush
---
Suprise this is what happens when you let people who play maybe 6hrs a day be the loudest
---
It all comes down to how hard it is to create meaningful content compared to how fast we can consume it. You also don't want to lose chucks of your player base because they've done everything there is to do in a short amount of time.
---
If there were no restrictions on currencies, XP, Score etc, then people would blast through the content, complain there was nothing to do and stop playing until the next update. That would drop the player base which wouldn't be good for those still online and playing. It would also drop revenue from the atomic shop.
---
While it sucks we don't have more content, it is not physically possible to create endless meaningful content at a rate quicker than we can play through it. You also can't put more resources into creating that content than the return you are making. Businesses need to make profit, and a good profit at that. Unless putting more resources into creating content is going to generate a lot more revenue, they'd be stupid to do so.
---
Yep, it sucks games have to go down this route of limiting our progress, but for the health of the game and to not have long periods of people not playing until the next update, what else are they meant to do?
---
I'm not saying i'm happy about it, but what are the realistic alternatives?
---
Nice to know. Thanks
---
That’s hard core
---
correction, canned meat stew is 5% only. If you're seeing higher values, you're probably a carnivore. Both carnivore and herbivore double the buffs from their respective food group (and leaving the opposite food group alone).
---
Best mutation imo for QOL. Currently lvling an alt and find it painful without it.
---
Thanks! As a shop owner who tries to keep things reasonable, I appreciate this. ALL ammo for   
---
 1 cap and ALL meds for 10 caps. Plus I try to sell at or below retail value for most things (except weapons, which I am slowly learning which legendaries are more valuable). I also try to drop 10mm pistols and ammo for newbies who swing by my CAMP (looses screws permitting). I tend to set up in the dry lake bed near the Fertile Soil event farm, so level 5 through 10s tend to wander by.
---
I would say definitely. As a general rule, perks don't typically scale off of intelligence, and if you find that you're noticing the penalty, take the egghead mutation, you will pretty much negate all the penalties, except for endurance. The carry bonus from marsupial is greater than the carry penalty from egghead's strength hit.
---
Broiled Scorchbeast Brain instead of Brain Bombs for Int 5 alone, 7.5 with a group and running Strange in Numbers.
---
I'll add it to the list.
---
I think it’s just their way of saying when the season will end. Kinda like a ‘play’ with the board game itself
---
This. I've responded to several people asking this and it turns out they are pretty much bang on where most of the community are.
---
Are u on pc
---
O..k.
---
You mean make a feature intuitive and useful? Are we playing the same game?
---
That is so cool
---
Sigh your right I sometimes forget who's running the game xD
---
Bush Wookies ruin the experience for everyone
---
Tried that, still unable to make a team
---
But I must sniff the pipe
---
I thought this to myself as well at the beginning. 
---
Now I can definitely not live without it lol
---
Have you considered that making a third of the game feel like using Microsoft Excel might be bad design?
---
Get Class Freak and Starched Genes both maxed and you'll wonder how you ever played without it!
---
It's random. I get the Retirement quest almost every day and the Communication one once in a while.
---
I did retirement yesterday.
---
I did 15 min in 2 matches hiding in bushes. Not proud. But completed
---
Where are you from?
---
Tenderizer, gun fu, concentrated fire all do similar damage buffs per kill but to a lesser extent than adrenaline. Of course these are all in other categories than adrenaline, so you probably don't have room for them unless you shuffle a lot of perks. Maybe mister sandman.
---
The only capitalist that can be trusted is a dead Capitalist 🤖
---
Thanks for the tips! Do you have an idea on how the respawn works? I know some items respawn after picking up 180 other items, but the flowers never seen to respawn correctly so I usually wait the 18 hours.
---
Some people play in certain grindy ways already. I know a couple gear obsessives who would just repeat whatever the current legendary farming meta was, although they stopped a couple months ago when they got sucked into Red Dead 2. They’d just nuke, loot, nuke, loot, nuke, loot, hop servers and do it all again. Whitepsrings, Watoga (before they completely nerfed it), Burrows, other spots that were good legendary farms. They had a good half dozen alts that they used to just store caps and legendaries.
---
Hell, now if you start a public hunting team you’ll be getting extra xp on top of your legendaries
---
It honestly cannot be a "marker" to show where you could be. Day 3/70 and we already have to be a third of the way through. If it was an analog of where we should be the season will be over in 9-10 days.
---
Get class freak 3 and use both marsupial and adrenal reaction. Those two are so much fun for every single type of build. You can jump higher, carry more and every single weapon will essentially be bloody, all at the cost of 1 intelligence and 11 HP. Adrenal reaction stacks with bloody weapons, too, so you can easily start 1 shotting just about anything with a chest shot using something like a lever gun. Even a handmade will 1 shot just about anything if you get them in the head.
---
You dont have that much. I have 364 damage resist and 759 energy resist. No Vanguard or Bolstering
---
It wasn’t like that before the most recent patch it  used to switch each day
---
Obligatory thank you!
---
Hes just wondering how hes gonna pay the next guy that returns his stolen item.
---
Got to do what you got to do
---
That’s what Elon feeds his baby
---
No me neither. Excepted for luck maybe. 
---
How’s your luck compared to your heavy gunner?
---
I’d be okay with them being delayed for 3 years if they fixed the instant travel and vats bugs.
---
I had a radio come up as "Beizement" for a while, was looking at it when it changed back to "Radio". Thought I was going crackers.
---
If I'm being honest, no clue on how vegetation respawns :/
---
Using chemist and supper Duper I can craft a batch large enough to last me a week, so I don't know exactly when the flowers reset. The shortest time between gathering sessions was 2 days, so the respawn timer can't be that long.
---
They were so underwhelming that I'm fine with waiting for season 2. Better to get it right than get it out sooner.
---
No it sucks. I dont want to spend 5 minute looking for the last guy in the game. Its stupid
---
You can spam the button though. Your selections are sticky, so if you tried to say convert missiles, when you get kicked to the convert/redeem menu just keep hitting your Confirm button, and it should select the same things. Only reason to slow down is if you've emptied out that particular ammo type or if you have other important ammo in that type (e.g. .308 in the 'low quality' ballistic ammo category) and don't want to accidentally convert those too. 
---
Same goes with redeeming: go through the menus once to choose teh ammo you want, then spam confirm until you can no longer redeem ammo.
---
Honestly if I were Beth I'd just remove the pretend slow terminal interface since that's what seems to be throwing off people.
---
Estonia.
---
Nuclear Winter? No its locked behind the base game
---
Fort nite was full of Bush masters upon release. They fixed it. Beth can do the same
---
If 3 month delay means better quality perks and I hope they add more, then I'm all in for it.
---
Choices are memorized with controllers as well. So really you can just choose the type and spam whatever your platform may be.
---
Oh yeah. I had a patio table set up for me and my team. Many pictures from there.
---
My personal thoughts on this require you to think about one thing...
---
"How many ultra rare and powerful Legacys exist in game on characters that quit playing before they became Legacy but after Vendors released"
---
Probably quite a lot and some will never come to light again. 
---
They may have logged in to try wastelanders completely unaware of what they were selling. 
---
Calling it stupidity or foolish could just be down to a player returning not even giving it a thought whether or not what they had for sale has raised or lowered in value. 
---
Take it for what it is and enjoy your new weapon.
---
I think because we participate in gaming related forums and communities where information is shared and absorbed we forget that what is probably a huge number of players don't. I bet if you were to survey the player base, a large number wouldnt even know what a bloodied build was, much less that it requires rads to be at its peak efficiency. I bet they are joining public groups and seeing it for the first time and thinking they are doing all these "rad lads" a massive favour by helping them out. 
---
The public teams is a wonderful new thing, but people need to stay mindful that for many its their first foray into playing in groups and there will be misssteps along the way we will need to work around
---
EDIT: Thank you for the award!
---
That would be amazing! I’ve never played with anyone before but I’d really enjoy that. I don’t currently have a mic but I’ll see if I can borrow my husband’s. I really wish text chat was a thing! I’m Kalamity929 in game. See you there! 😃
---
This bug can lead to some funny results. The legendary exchange machine had my friend's name one time.
---
Oh yeah, I misunderstood. I thought for some reason you meant $40 on top of the base game or something, or only Fallout 1st members could play. But yeah, if you buy Fallout 76 for only Nuclear Winter, absolutely a waste of money. And making you pay for the whole game just to play it does limit the player base. I see what you mean now
---
Find a loving and supporting fallout 1ster who will let you use their server to claim the power plants if you had xbox I would have let you
---
They should fix it, it also doesn't help that they wear the gillie suit and the storm makes the zone so damn dark
---
You know you're getting basically nothing out of that right? 350 is a sheer cliff.
---
Yeah I normally make batches for my friends who pvp a lot, and I can usually make a batch every 18ish hours (so a little earlier the next day). I'd just noticed that I managed to get 85 from yesterdays batch instead of a usual 50-60 because of the forest being in season.
---
When I try the 180 respawn trick the plants visually respawn but they don't do anything when they're interacted with, and if I've not picked up another 180 before the next days batch the ash roses refuse to respawn for me :/
---
He's only moved one space, he started near that worm hole on the board. If that makes you feel a little better.
---
I'm in the exact same situation.
---
Hey man I hate doing it too but if gets the challenge done I’m doing it
---
Which collectron(s) do you have?
---
If you hit up the Radiation Rumble event it usually spawns like.. 4 to 6 snallys
---
I can't even figure out what that's meant to be.
---
Also - Pipe is life!
---
And if someone has already gone through either Toxic Larry's or the trainyard, your second option is Grafton Monsters. They can be found at:
---
- Grafton during Grafton Day
---
- south of Hemlock Holes
---
- just outside Poseidon
---
- sometimes is a Heart of the Swamp boss.
---
EDIT: almost forgot that Wendigos can show up in Lewisburg if a high level player drops by, and also at Freddy's House of Fear.
---
What makes you say that?
---
I joined recently on the recent free to play weekend, just before Faschnacht, and I gotta say, I have had the same reaction. I expected griefing and trouble from the get-go, but it's been wonderful. I am also a compulsive scrapper and yes, the FO1st scrap box is my altar.  
---
But the community has been so great! Friendly people in-game, great teams, excited newbies. And the forums and sub-Reddit are full of helpful people.
---
I am hooked!
---
or just the flooded trainyard
---
Inb4 they release the pts and the testers say the perks are underwhelming and delay it another 3 months
---
I thought he was supposed to be glued to his desk, but today he was over wandering near one of the Sunny bots...I swear Ward is trolling me sometimes..
---
Please explain how Empath works even when in a team but solo.
---
&gt; FT to charlston capitol, below in the floodbed.
---
There's also a snally there sometimes.
---
My dude they all fucking dead my dude thsts like saying the bos is still in appalachia
---
I am having the same issue :(
---
BoS sent and Expedition from California
---
Why not just play the mode how it was intended
---
Yeah I’m only level 31 and I’m pretty casual about the game, I’ll grind sometimes so I’ll just mess around and try it out
---
Personally I'm glad they're delaying legendary perks until they can be made better. Most of the current selection was basically hot garbage. The only legendary perk that I was remotely interested in personally was the one called "What RADS?" and that's mostly because my character was a full health power one for PVE content. another reason why I liked what Brad's is because when you fully Max it out and got a huge substantial bonus instead of just a minimal one like all the other ones did. It went from 100 radiation resist and 3 RADS healed per second to 300 rad resist and 6 RADS healed per second at Max rank. it actually kind of felt like it was worth the investment to an extent.
---
Okay
---
I think so. Only way to confirm is go private, launch a nuke, and kill her by yourself. Best done if you have a very high-damage setup (or lucky enough to own a magic weapon, which given that they're basically bugged garbage weapons, should be easy).
---
I think she's pissed that she's glued to the side of that bus...
---
No
---
Yes, that's why I did it a second time and made sure to observe the actual score. I received none.
---
Yup and I’m kinda getting angry because I need her quest to pop up
---
Part of the battle pass event.  Low level reward
---
I’m happy but at the same I already uninstalled this game already. Is it so hard to just get right or ok the first time? It donned on me I’m not doing anything actually fun. I’m farming all day for ammo to then do the boring af nuke quest to kill the boring af sbq to take the shitty legendaries to the mole until I can’t. I do the dailies in like 10 minutes and then I remember to turn in 20 of the several hundred notes I got. I GUESS i could do the rep grind but no thanks. I’m just messing around in my camp just hoping someone buys something and idk why I’m doing this to myself. I had completely forgot about this game after wastelanders but then this seasons thing came and I was like sure I’ll try but the ammo machine sucks and I know for a fact I’m not gonna play daily so why even bother. Maybe with it being on game pass some on the fence friends will try it out and bring me back in but otherwise I’m going to try to find a game that doesn’t actively make me both addicted and bored
---
There's always middle mountain cabins. Yao Guai, Honeybeasts, or Radscorpions can spawn there, so you still get your acid. Also Tanagra Town's cavern system has plenty of cave crickets.
---
 West Tek should be everyone's first move after getting hacked.
---
Thanks! Were currently offering a special on trips to the Tatooine system. For some reason, most people don’t want to travel to a system with two suns in the summertime...
---
Ever since I finished wastelanders, playing the game has just felt like a chore
---
It's still in atom shop but I caant use on my charachter
---
It has diminishing returns. You can still squeeze some out of it but 350 is about as high as it gets before it doesn't matter too much.
---
Yep.
---
Why?  Actually curious.
---
At the end there's a timer for you to get out
---
Hi,
---
Take over the 2 power plant workshops that give you power cores. You will need fusion generator plans.  Play the game and fast travel every once in awhile to the workshops and collect.
---
i like nw :)
---
These seasons have stopped me completing the game, like I dont have the time to do quests, and the seasonal stuff, and gold at the same time. Bought this game when wastelanders came out, was fun at first, now I regret it, seasons wouldn't be so bad if not for nuclear winter.
---
Where did it say live action?
---
yep
---
But if I’ve already done all my weekly ones before the weekend I get punished? It doesn’t take long to get most of them even just playing enough to get the daily stuff done every day 3-4 days and it’s out
---
Unless you're searching Wendigo Cave. Then it's downright impossible.
---
I can not play without it so I got like 10 just in case I ever make a new character
---
I mean, I usually do the same drop location every game because it's the area I know the best, and I can run straight to the good chests
---
not really any reason to drop anywjere else honestly since everything is randomized anyway
---
Praise the Lord and pass the Ammunition!
---
It mightve gotten unequiped
---
It has the potential to be very entertaining and reach a wide audience like the Witcher.  But I'm gonna keep my expectations for the quality of it to a minimum. Really interested to see how they go about it.
---
It’s simple, Ed boy: They want you to live on the game and not play any other games. 
---
Some games do this very well, where you’re really enjoying the game and you just happen to get cool shit out of all the time you put in. That’s great; but, when the devs are scum about it, making your only other approach to use real money and buy your way up the tiers/levels/etc, while they never fix the mountains of broken game mechanics, and never deliver on long-since-promised features, it’s time to stop playing. They’ll wise up when their concurrent player counts fall below a desirable level.
---
Without the right build it’s impossible. Guy said he’s not ready. Don’t try to push him into something he’s not comfortable with
---
mine is literally just lucky hole mine and excavator power armor
---
with super duper you get around 1500 lead
---
Thanks. I tend to get odd bugs but good to know this ones not just me.
---
2 wendigos south of abbey's bunker, on the road buy a bus(I think)
---
Just do a queen fight and you generally will get it
---
Reworked? Should be tested to begin with, lazy mofos.
---
Thanks awesome nice job
---
What a piece of junk!
---
As much as I enjoy 76 its hard to deny that there are so many flawed design choices. Sometimes the issues are so glaring and obvious the player base can point out the issues before a feature has even been released just based on Bethesdas description. It's baffling that a group of professionals can be so consistent in their bad design choices.
---
My favorite part is how I made a shitty and obviously sarcastic mock code that in no universe even looks like real code and it was still downvoted. 
---
I am literally in agreement with the message about telling that other person to code it themselves, as though it were as easy as my post. 
---
God damn people
---
every 6 months  would-be already happy, I started way after you guys like 2 months ago and burned the entire main quest and I'm just with the ally quest left to do and events, and now I can't even play couse I'm with weight issue or I just drop the legendary to be able to play or I wait for the scrip to reset and, why not raise to 500 and let us be happy? same for gold bullion. and for older people I think a raid where you is need to be 50+ and on a full team an put difficult enemies (can be te same enemies there but with hight stats with a cache with random legendary on the end guarantee 3 starts) with a backstory wwhere the overseer found an obscure vaultec experiment. 
---
add 1-2 weapons each major update, on each category melee-ranged-unarmed.
---
make "exploration far way" where we leave Appalachia to find new and strong enemies(same thing as a raid) full of rads that only an especial PA can take the hit and put this PA as a reward from another raid.
---
the options is huge just use your imagination.
---
If it’s not max level and legendary most people don’t want it. There is a market for low levels but why bother they’re usually broke. No one wants the fasnaut stuff.
---
Nice, me and my group are on course for level 20 some point this weekend
---
People with a lot of time on their hand who only play this game and little empathy for any situation that isn’t theirs or anyone who enjoys playing a game differently then they do.
---
That’s all that matters...
---
I guess I’m just not understanding. I still use stimpacks, especially against the queen and encryptid. If a lot of mobs hit me then I’ll need to use them too. I’m usually the one in the group going head first and taking all the damage lol
---
Are you a melee build too? What’s your set up like? I’m always down to learn new ways
---
&gt; Bethesda needs better account security
---
"you need better account security", maybe?

Check your apparel tab.

Love to hear if you cancel after a month with the scrap box.

You could always do the “colossal problem” event. Oh wait...

---
I got floater flamer grenades from a glowing one, don’t even know the plan
---
I’m interested but not enough to pay. Honestly it’ll probably be trash like literally other game show except the Witcher. The story just isn’t that interesting and I don’t think it’ll translate but I’ll definitely give it a shot.
---
I dont think ANY of the bug fixes in this patch actually did anything
---
Carnivorous mutation 2x for meats so squirrel for 20% AND scorchbeast brain for 8 INT
---
Too late, I already uninstalled the game. They will keep doing this. Releasing unfinished/rehashed stuff and then try to fix them all the while delaying actual content because they broke the game and have to fix their own mistakes.
---
The cycle continues...
---
I've been getting floater grenades off stuff.

It isn’t gone.  Just the public groups.
---
CAMP on a junk pile and set your collectron to scrap search.
---
And there were plenty of posts that actually do/show the calculations that explains you need to complete every single daily/weekly, every day/week, plus also a few thousand extra points that would need to be earned by grinding XP.
---
If you are removing the chance to get some of these daily's along the way, each 1 requires leveling 10,000 experience 2 and 1/2 times just to get back the points from that 1 challenge.
---
A max level supermutant gives you around like 200 XP with some XP benefits. You would need to kill 50 to get 10,000. That's 2 runs of West Tek (if it hasn't been cleared already, because the game makes it quite impossible to grind XP unless you have private servers), each run takes around 10min (that's assuming you're a beefy character with the best weapons). So for a lower level person, or 1 that doesn't necessarily trade on the Reddit marketplace for the best Weapons, it will take maybe double the time.
---
So. Calculating the Comparison.
---
Loosing a challenge like- collect 3 purified water. Time taken to complete: 1min. 250 points
---
Grinding West Tek in order to gain the same amount of points (Equivalent, because you can't earn half of challenge)
---
5 runs of West Tek earns around 25,000xp. Each run is 10-20min depending. So 50-100min to earn 250 points
---
The comparison
---
Challenge- 1min. Earning Xp- 50-100min.
---
If this happens multiple times, people are left so far behind, the only choice is to buy many of the levels.
---
Stop defending a company who is clearly chasing greed.

The real Beckley truly was the friends we made along the way...

I can only see it working if they make it not take itself too seriously. Maybe a dark comedy action sort of show. Because while the games were dark and grim, there were genuine moments of camp or goofy nature that comes to break the suffocating tension it could build. Fallout 2 and New Vegas Wild Wasteland trait followed that model.
---
I was in a level 23 empty house yesterday and I jacked his camp up.  Radiation shower. Radiation barrel, fusion generator. All crafting stations.   I took a pic but can’t share it here.

Hopefully, those dances are lameo
---
Legendaries can be purchased at the Rusty Pick near the Firehouse in Ash Heap. But they’ll be on sale next week starting the 9th. Usually 100 scrip for a 3 star gun, they’ll be 75 instead.
---
Damage resistance has a ceiling. After 350 dr/er the amount of additional protection you are getting is minimal. PA is the the exception. Normal armor more or less caps out.
---
super duper doesn't work on it
---
I can fix the problem just tell me your social security number
---
Well Xbox live is down if you're trying right now. But I've also been having connectivity issues, otherwise too though so...
---
A daily login reward? Yeah 100%. If they expect us to play literally every day, even if just for an hour or two, might as well.
---
Not patched. Still can drop 1* though
---
Yeah, ish. There's also fuel gauge in the bottom right corner that shows his progress for each space. Basically they gave him a huge head start but players can move multiple spaces per day more than he can. 
---
Some people hit rank 10 to 12 on the first day. My assumption is that they didn't want players out pacing Zorbo on the very first day, so they put him farther on the board to give you something to work towards rather than starting him at zero.
---
Yes so just dont try ezgg.
---
I guess I need to read more carefully, I was not expecting it to be at the bottom of the list.
---
Thank you friend!
---
Commie
---
I’d a grim take on it honestly. The humor while nice always felt forced or a chuckle at best. I want the same energy fallout 4 op gives. Hell let us REALLY a see pre fallout fallout. Like wtf that’s when literally everything interesting happens in game.
---
Gonna have to go to a thieves guild fence for that, pal.
---
/u/Valseek /u/ladydevann please, this bug was listed as fixed forever ago, any sort of update at all...? Sorry for the billion username mentions I'm sure you guys are getting right now.
---
thanks a bunch, I'll wait for that then.
---
I fully expect them to copy more and more of ESO while not pumping out the same amount of content.
---
Where are you getting that damage resistance has a ceiling? If it does then I’ll think about moving stuff around
---
Thanks! I was not expecting it to be legendary, although I knew it would have a legendary attribute.
---
Just get it you’ll understand
---
Man there’s TOO much in ESO lol I so wish Fallout 76 was made by those guys. It’s also so buttery smooth.
---
Oh they definitely fixed the budget glitch with the circus cage. Looks like that was the only one that stuck though.
---
Their all of a sudden dropping in the presents too
---
I sell three stars that r low level near vault 76 for new players for under one hundred caps as i ve no use for them
---
He mad
---
I guarantee no matter how they take .. there will be bugs and glitches
---
I can agree with that. I guess in my head I envisioned a violent version of Pleasantville. Either way could work in my opinion. Just depends on the cast and execution.  And if they bother to consider some of the lore at all. I'm sure they'd find a neutral location to not bastardize existing content. But who knows.
---
Oh no it's the grammar police. We have to read 20 peoples posts a day saying there leaving when clearly they wont
---
Well if you want to run a shotgun build. Google 'Fallout 76 shotgun build' and then sort by date. or replace shotgun with melee/automatic rifle/non auotmatic rifle etc etc
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
You can move a point or pick a perk every level now. if you use this site   [https://nukesdragons.com/](https://nukesdragons.com/)  you can put your build in there and post the url here if you want people to help you out. Being a fresh 50 you probably have some points and cards you could do without.
---
Dont have the plans I just completed a level 50 heavy bos unyeilding set but its 2 star lvl 50.i know the vendor bot near the waterpark at the top of the map usually has some ...been a while could be wrong
---
Why would they put more resources in though if it won’t make them more money?
---
It was. Did it get patched?
---
Just re-equip from the atomic shop, its working fine for me
---
First and foremost, the rusty pick in the ash heap region is where the Purveyor moved to. She will trade you a random legendary gear piece each time, so it is just RNG. 
---
As for build questions, start by picking your "specialty",( ie melee, pistols, heavy guns, ect) and google builds for that type. Its a starting  point, but it will at least give you an idea of how to change your build. 
---
Me personally, i sneak everywhere with the chinese stealth armor and blow shit up with a bow and exploding arrows!
---
It still blows my mind they even bothered to name the SS members since they literally do nothing save the one vendor.
---
Asking the only question that matters right there.
---
You have a 1 minute timer to gtfo of dodge, you missed it unfortunately. I missed exiting the tunnel by about a second once and watched as the tunnel collapsed in front of me, with daylight literally metres away on the other side once. Wasnt cool.  
---
\*EDIT\* As far as rewards go, you receive tokens from the mining robots periodically, on a perfect run you get close to 50 tokens from the bots and another 10 as a reward. There are also little treasure troves that uncover themselves periodically. Lastly, most people I see doing this just run as soon as the escape timer starts, however if the robots are still up, you can earn another 4-8 tokens from the robots by just not escaping too early, i usually leave right at the last second.
---
She'll make .5 past lightspeed. She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. I've made a lot of special modifications myself.
---
So what would I get if I am level 68 ? I can pay
---
You should be good. It seems to be if you are logged in within around 20mins of the changeover of challenges, it autocompletes some at random
---
\#4 without a doubt.  #1 is your second best.  You can rapid fire them in third person, and the quad holds a lot of ammo.  Also Quad DPS is way better because there is no pause to reload.
---
Um you don't want too much of the ESO model. The Crown store is the epitome of soulless cash stealing. Theyll charge $50 for a crafting style and $150 for an imaginary 'house'. 
---
Oh and unless you run the niche, desired meta build for your type you can't join. Oh, and even if you do you'll need to post a vid of how hard you smack an animated dummy to PROVE it and THEN you might be allowed to play.
---
Fuck ESO firmly, and ZOS and the horse those shit bags rode in on.
---
Apologies for the venting. ESO touched me when I said no.
---
I definitely do not want to see a post fallout world. No CGI Deathclaws. I’m good G. The fallout storylines aren’t tv material. Just show me the events leading up to the world of the games we play.

Just bought it a couple hours ago as well! Following this to hopefully get some tips too.
---
Anyone know how to change which photo is displayed at the top of the post? It seems to have just picked a random one from my imgur album and I can’t seem to figure out how to change it.

Lol I haven’t gotten far enough on to notice those things but I can’t believe it

Mines just permanently fucked up, I used to have 300 carry weight but now it's 250 and it goes even lower when I'm in power armour

I dunno, maybe this crazy idea of finishing the product you put out there. Or just having pride in your work. I guess that concept is lost in this day and age.
---
No worries. I was the same first time I crafted a legendary. I was expecting a box to open like it shows on the crafting table, not an actual item.
---
It's just pretty well known by now, but you can look it up if you don't believe me. I'm surprised you hadn't heard it before.

Well at end game the exclusion and the meta chasing is off tap my friend I promise you.

Perk load out are on the road map. So we should get a solution in the coming months.

I'm free tomorrow.
---
I’m almost ready for Toddhood
---
im with you on "what rads."  for full hp builds it actually feels like a good/legendary card, much less it was an "endurance" styled card that was actually useful.  its the 1 perk im looking forward to and hope they dont fuck with
---
im hoping they use it as a "baseline" for how the perks should feel for the various builds they would apply to
---
Don’t be afraid to get in the mix. Everyone loves a low level charging in with a hatchet in hand.
---
ah indeed, that works too
---
Same for me
---
You do know that perk loadouts are coming, right?
---
With shotguns RN, just get into the habit of using VATS if you want max damage.  That is assuming you are using #1 or 4.
---
I don’t do any of the defend events. Too slow and none of them give anything good
---
Westworld creative team is behind this. It’s gonna be good.
---
I am not policing your grammar, I am saying that the way you write reminds me of teenage girls on twitter. Additionally, by voicing your misplaced frustration in the form of lambasting OP over having to be witness to too many threads about a particular topic in a discussion forum about a video game after its big patch day (shocking), you are also being a giant hypocrite which leads me right back to my original point which is 
---
&gt; Oh please your opinions have no more right to be expressed here than Op's do

I think buying the board would be cheaper
---
OH - that explains why I just completed "Gather building supplies" and didn't get anything. Thanks. \^\^;
---
Same here. I got buried.
---
I don't know if it's exactly what you are looking for, but I enjoy the videos of angry turtle
---
Yeah, i think i got some points early when i shouldn't have but then it frustrates me when i expect some but none given. (Cause i probably already got paid when i shouldn't have) but i am more just annoyed cause now im confused if im over or under awarded.  Or even

Herbivore and carnivore now boost food effect by 2x. I, a herbivore, have been eating cranberry relish for 20% xp boost these days.

Oh man,  lost a few Jah tunes to some dirty trades back in the day!
---
Yeah I mentioned that in the post. 
---
This can be useful for those that don’t use it don’t have the excavator power armor.
---
Things you can do to improve your chances:  Wait until the enemy is facing you and not even partially obstructed.  Don't engage if VATS isn't at 95% chance *when you initiate VATS.* Close VATS and reinitiate when closer.  Don't initiate vats while at a lower than 95% chance and move closer expecting it to hit when you reach 95%.  It usually will miss if you do.
---
aww thanks, much appreicated!
---
Who tf downvoted this?
---
Use VATS and try again.  In Third person preferably, sneaking and aiming for the head.
---
Both have 10+ Luck. Hm. Very odd indeed.
---
game is fun but once u get settled in youll notice the flaws. Bethesda in this fallout is like trump to the us
---
Apologies if I'm misunderstanding you, but the settlers/raiders questline is not the main questline of the game. Lots of new players seem to make this mistake.
---
The questlines diverge around the Responders/Rose part of the main story, so go back and continue it from there if you haven't already.
---
It will be on Amazon so no restrictions on rating
---
I died
---
There’s a 1 minute count down at the end before it collapses. I head toward the exit a little earlier than that.
---
oh I know my build is [all over the place and pretty bad](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=b968c55&amp;d=sa2su1s61sd2sv0pa0p80p90pc2p02ej4e40c72ck0cr0c50i10i30ic4ij0ii0i60ia0i50at1ac0ar0ag0l62l91), I just picked whatever was bugging me at the moment I leveled or whatever stuff I pulled out of the packs. Like I leveled when I was slightly over my weight limit and just picked 'strong back' so I could fast travel back to camp.
---
Honestly I'm okay with whatever weapon/build, I normally play a stealthy sniper but since starting this game I wanted to go against type and I've really enjoyed going in as a heavy with a combat shotgun. just blasting my way through everything.
---
the back of my knees are moist in anticipation
---
Welcome back!
---
I recommend struggling. The temptation is to blast through to the end game as quickly as possible, but I suggest taking your time.
---
Many of the locations in the Forest are mere annoyances once your 30+, but at 10, are super challenging and fun.
---
You’ll be in the end game grind soon enough, take your time getting there.
---
Grafton bit has it
---
It will be finished in precisely 10 hours when I can be bothered to stop being an insomniac
---
If they do this it means they’ve given up on the perk loadouts which we desperately need. I hope they didn’t read this ;)
---
Ah that’s so BS. So probably unfortunately for me since I missed 1 day or possible other days I can’t reach tier 100?
---
oh I completely forgot about Rose. her radio call in every time I log in sort of drifted into the background mentally, it has just become the audio queue that lets me know I finished loading in hah, thanks for reminding me.
---
That's got nothing to do with game progress for players being slowed/restricted.
---
not until fred said something about it
---
I don’t know people bother damage is hardly a issue ever for me outside The Encryptid event which just is a one shot over over.
---
but you also mocked them like a child so maybe you deserve it anyway ¯\\____(ツ)____/¯
---
Some youtuber said it didn't work and there were a couple of threads on here saying it didn't work so basically i didn't even try.
---
They said it did the noise and animation for super duper but you didn't actually get another one.
---
Dm me👍
---
Just a thought while we're at it. It doesn't matter much but think we could add alien blaster ammo to the list? As far as I can figure out, there's only 1 or 2 ways to get it, both tedious, and alien blasters aren't all that great either. It would be nice to have the ammo just to play around with it.
---
Dood get mutation perks in luck tree I have all mutations totally worth
---
It's more that if people are spreading this info about it working and being incorrect they are adding 8-33% extra damage to players under the assumption that it works.
---
Level 68 in The Legendary Run? How the F\*\*k?
---
Anthem is like hoping your dad comes back from buying cigarettes, 76 is like hoping your dad will stop being selfish and being too "busy with work" that maybe tomorrow he will teach you how to throw overhand and you can stop looking like a fool in gym class. Either way we are all growing up with self esteem issues.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title.

M8 my character level not legendary run haven’t even begun levelling that yet
---
I didn't realize that mockery or even the basic understanding of it was exclusive to children.
---
I'd say a child is incapable of the mockery I performed. 
---
But an adult would understand that without needing an explanation, well a moderately intelligent and witty one would. 
---
Oh well.
---
I’ll say this though. I actually liked the Catalcysm in that game I just hated how they time gated the gear you could get.
---
Train station and the vendor bot there.
---
Those threads served a valuable service: those threads made it extremely clear to Bethesda that the ammo converter is so poorly conceived that people won't put up with it. I wish people would be as mad about lack of content.
---
Wow, people complaining about nothing without even actually playing themselves and seeing how fast they actually do get levels... no way, that’s new ;)
---

---
He wasnt discussing issues with the game he felt more inclined to explain why he was leaving. Nobody cares. I guess you would know about teenage girls on twitter......
---
Bethesda to fallout 76 is like trump to the us, constantly promising things they can never live up to and then goes on to do something completely random that changes everything. They try to milk their fans and there are also those diehard fans who see the good in every dumpsterfire update they release. Think of this update, people are so happy with them putting in a party interface even tho it provides new gameplay content. The battle pass is neat and gives u something to do for a little but is not any real content. Wastelanders is literally the only content update they have had in the last year. 
---
TL;DR Bethesda is Trump
---
When I visit a good shop or a cool CAMP I drop 10 super stimpacks. It's not much but I hope it conveys my appreciation.
---
Yeah God forbid a company try to turn a profit so they can create more content.  I'll defend who I like.
---
I think I have some spare plans laying around or I can mod the armor for you if you'd like
---
You can run a shotgun build. One of the best weapons in the game (IMO) is the gauss shotgun which unfortunately you have to grind reputation for foundation for. 
---
Here's a normal shotgun build by a youtuber. Those peeps usually know their stuff. https://www.kevduit.com/fallout-76-shotgun-build/
---
When you level up now for the next 10-15 levels i wouldn't spend any points if you can manage. or slowly fix your build. Lose those quality of life cards like pack rat, strong back, pharma farma etc. 
---
Go shopping at vendors and see if you can find a decent legendary shotgun to get you started.
---
you sure showed me!
---
If you complete the challenge early you don’t lose the points, you just get them earlier than you should have. Trust me, I thought I lost points too but I literally did just get them earlier than I should have. And this is happening to everybody, some people just may not be noticing.
---
Did u at least get ur ammo tokens before u died
---
Hmm I did and found the opposite https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/btcqov/does_damage_resistance_mean_anything_in_this_game/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

I just list all ammo at 1 cap each. I wish I could create ammo bundles-- I want to price some of it cheaper. I've seen people putting up basic ass ammo for more than 1 cap per round, but it doesn't make any sense to me. It takes up valuable stash space (vs very little inventory space with the right perks). Sell a lot of it for cheap, and you'll ALWAYS be moving ammo. In a 2-3 hour adventure mode session, it's not at all unusual for me to get 10k+ caps from ammo-- .45, 5mm, and 5.56 are my primary money makers
---
Yea it’s the interactions that mater sometimes not the overall experience

---
Awesome and I hope the loss scrapping is about 5 Percent of the materials used to craft then just let us craft new ammo with the scrap. 30% Return was just fu-+ing insulting and pisses me off!
---
I don’t blame anyone. Any person grumpy about micro-transactions isn’t obligated to take part in them. People have to accept you don’t always get everything you want. The high level rewards are for people who spend the most time playing.

Probably over 100-120 tops depends when you buy it thank god ive been saving 20 k atoms for something like this

They should just tie S.C.O.R.E. to XP gained give give XP for completing daily challenges. That way players just do whatever they enjoy doing in the game.

I hope they let us pick and choose what to buy, not the whole thing as a bundle. All i need is weapon and PA skins, not much else.

hell yeah, that +INT goes a long way

How exactly ? They made a free season pass with the option to pay for it , even if it was mega easy to cruise through the levels I would still pay for everything because after all I’m a whale and nothing will ever change that

But yeah, even with current estimates, it does look rough to reach 100 being a casual player. Gotta do all the weeklies and dailies you can until we get a better handle on what all they are adding throughout the season. Certainly not kind to the casual / working player!
---
But really don't get down about it yet, you're really only one board space behind even though he's 'far ahead', and you can move multiple per day. Could easily catch up.
---
Yep, Angry Turtle. He’s the most informational Fo76 YouTuber I’ve come across.
---
Kevduit’s videos are a lot of fun, but his website offers much more information, including builds, guides, etc.
---
Captainoob is great for checking out a variety of legendaries in action.
---
If it’s a series of short stories, maybe a few parts here and there I think it’ll be good.
---
I’m not sure how a series could go, it’d be similar to walking dead in that regard, with basically everything replacing the undead.
---
Totally worth getting.
---
Have you ever heard the tragedy of Todd Howard the wise ?
---
Yeah its my go to gun for SBQs and other tough enemies since my usual main guns is a lever action and Fancy Pump Action. I burn through a stupid ammount of ammo but it does a pretty good job. I usually manage to always do enough damage to get to loot
---
I got one of those from the 3* legendary blood eagle during riding shotgun today
---
Umm.  It has happened multiple times and been broken after recent patches.  Happened to me on one of my mules about a month ago.   There's also the vendor stealing out of your camp too.
---
The cap on gold makes the grind unbearable. Get rid of that and I wouldn't mind playing MORE to get notes from events, etc. Instead of doing a few dallies and hopping off immediately
---
Who’s pushing?
---
Yeah, I use the gift box too. I once was trying to give some good stuff to a new player and he seemed really friendly and was trying to engage but just wasn’t getting it. I tried to crouch next to it, swipe at it, emojis, everything I could think of. He mimicked what I was doing and seemed really excited but just never made the connection to what I was trying to do, poor guy!
---
I want a chest.. thats about it
---
Ironic because Fallout was *originally* about making many choices.
---
No, my keyboard isn't sticky, I keep it clean and I really don't appreciate you insinuating things when I'm just trying to look for help for a minor inconvenience.
---
Caps on caps on caps on rng on rng on rng.
---
Its fucking lame.
---
I want to play a hell of a lot of Fallout 76 on the 3-4 days a week where I have lots of free time, but Bethesda clearly doesn't want me to.
---
So I play for an hour or so, hit my caps, then go play something else the rest of the time. This week I finally got around to playing Spider-man on Ps4, holy crap what a great game! 
---
Next week I'm gonna do God of War, super looking forward to that.
---
WE DID IT REDDIT! WE SAVED THE CITY!
---
Not gonna lie all the items you get for playing are for the most part better then the ones in atom shop so I fail to see where the complaint stems from
---
Yes and the Teddy Bears and Gnomes as well. I would watch it just for the easter eggs.
---
You make a good point I cancelled first long ago as it was founded on a lie and continues to disappoint
---
You dare question the ways of Atom?!!!?
---
Ah yes I have, as our heathen gods have said, let there be light; Devil todd the lost has said, it just works.
---
Yes this has been happening to me as well. Xbox1
---
i wanna see how far i can get then see if i need to at the end just made it to lv 18 but keeping this pace the whole season gonna be rough lol
---
It's pretty broken, I had to leave team and goto ares chat for it to work. In game chat did that before public teams where you had to switch from team chat to area chat back and forth until you could hear them.
---
Dread it, run from it, the fallout first subscription always arrives
---
Yep, also the strips on limbs have weird placement, esp.noticeable when you dodge move, or jump. "It just works"...
---
I’m not sure what the point of workshops even are to anyone at the endgame. They don’t just continuously make resources and it’s not the time to deal with their mini events. At first I liked making Fusion Cores but now I realize they’re literally everywhere. I make ammo but it’s so slow I usually forget.
---
I wasn’t trying to be insulting, sorry if I offended you. I guess I was trying to be funny, but it was a poor attempt.
---
If it’s not too late to respond seriously, I haven’t noticed that issue happening with me or anyone else I’ve played with. But what does happen to me a lot is that when I go into a trade menu with another player, I’ll accidentally hold the “accept trade” down too long and it’ll instantly only show offers instead of the whole inventory. But I don’t think that is what is happening with your scenario.
---
That’s why I’m just gonna whale out make Todd happy for a fraction of a second
---
No, not really. It was random. I was doing the Retirement Plan one every single day, and then the Communication one once every few.
---
A baby too? Man u almost got a full team...
---
Love it. I don’t think I could go back to running a build without Marsupial.
---
As stated in other posts, with Class Freak 3* you’re only taking a -1 INT hit.
---
If that’s still too much, browse player vendors for affordable Marsupial Serums. I found one player selling them for 250 each. Taking one negates the negative effects for, I believe, one hour. You can also buy the recipe and make the serum yourself.
---
In any case, try it out. You won’t regret it. :)
---
I don’t know how people can even play this game without the scrap box and tent.
---
Thank you for the tip. I did this and indeed took less than a minute.
---
Revenant is hilarious. Just when you thought you couldn't possibly be doing more damage, have a near death experience and return as a nuke in human form.
---
Hell yes. I love the blaster and only have 82 rounds left
---
The quote “...Todd Howard and the rest of the brilliant lunatics at Bethesda...” seems accurate.
---
It’s very hard at first but you get used to it also having mules and Trading constantly keeps my inventory relatively low on weight
---
Hmmm your right. I mean clearly with the player count, amount of people using fallout 1st, highly profitable revenue from microtransactions and low amount of resources being put back into the game, they are well and truely hitting high profit margins. But those poor executives at Zenimax need to buy themselves another boat, so I guess it's time to get blood from a stone from their loyal customers.
---
There's xp then theres score
---
For me it switched every day and I know this up until now it’s been doing this for the past few months it’s been everyday
---
Isn’t it just wild the entire objective of vault 76 was to rebuild and we literally never do anything like that.
---
Yea the cap limit is pretty horrendous as it is 30k ? Really that’s nothing
---
Sounds great! Where can I get one?
---
You could try abandoned bogtown. There's a 50 that spawns in the truck before the police station
---
Grafton monster has a dedicated spawn location.
---
Thank God the SS didn’t have their own Reputation lol. The Scrip limit and complete lack of trading them made me not even bother.
---
I did it for the enclave mission when I was like lvl 30 that was a shit show
---
Either start fixing your build now or gather enough points to fix it in one go. 
---
If you haven't yet you'll probably want to look into mutations. They help a lot. BUT you need 5 points in luck and 2 perks starched genes and class freak. but then you should also have 3 bloody mess for 15% extra damage
---
Well, 30k caps is a limit. I was talking about how gold bullion being capped at 200 a day is horrid
---
Toxic Larry's Meat n' Go always spawns a group of Snallygasters. There's other guaranteed spawns for Snallygasters, Grafton Monsters, and a few other cryptics all over the map. Anglers count as cryptids, too, so that one point of interest in the northeast corner of the Mire is another option.
---
They’ve said you have to go through the board so if the thing you want is at the end ohwell.jpg
---
Dunno whether this one is true or not [https://youtu.be/OqwoKVJQ46A?t=551](https://youtu.be/OqwoKVJQ46A?t=551)
---
Is that with BArbarian?
---
Really? Were you just really unlucky or something cause this one was fairly easy. Snagged the grafton monster at charleston then the nearby snallygasters - no problemo.
---
Is there a video or link where I can learn more about this?
---
Try the submerged train yard east of watoga.
---
Snallygasters spawn there often.
---
Hemlock holes
---
Tree Tops has a giant sloth spawn
---
I haven’t successfully done the grind needed for any of the things in this game whether it be reputation or bullion etc it’s all too tedious and such a waste of time
---
Can I still play my XBox files, even though I already have a PC version? I've made the decision to never play my XBox, ever again. I'm in the process of rebuilding one of my old XBox characters; but that might not be necessary, if I can access the old files.
---
black bear lodge or something like that, by the pioneer scout camp, just kill snally gasters. I think Charleston has em around too
---
"Not a popular opinion" on a sub filled with people bitching about it. ok
---
Keep flipping a coin, and eventually you'll get "heads" three times in a row. Chance and probability, friend.
---
As everyone is saying, Angry Turtle, quite informative, i'm rocking his stealth heavy gunner build and it's beautiful. BADCompanySarge has good build videos too.
---
My guess is the game didn’t register the damage fast enough so it just gave the enemies a extra guy
---
Nice! Come on. 
---
(Seriously though, I feel like that could apply to all the C.A.M.P.s in Appalachia)
---
Screw the high level rewards (I don't even want any of these rewards), your forced to participate just to get the Atoms, Reduced Atoms, you were getting before this shitty Run was implemented. If you Don't participate you get nothing now.
---
My friend with a gatling plasma. His head is sideways.
---
I think the bigger question is who still uses power armor?
---
South of abbie's bunker has 3 wendigos that spawn
---
Just do prewar fallout 4 themes and plot. That’s all I want
---
Cryptids: Flatwoods monster, Grafton monster, Mothman, Sheepsquatch (not imposter), Snallygaster, Wendigo.
---
You mean to say you couldn't find 3 of any combination of the above? They don't have to be 3 different ones; 3 of the same will work.  
---
The easiest by far is the Snallygaster, since they always spawn in groups of 3 or more anyways.
---
I just come back to the game today. I'm loving all the new content but I've wanted loadouts since the beginning. Can you give me a link or give me a rundown on what they said? This is amazing news!
---
Yea both I think could be improved and the max on gold should be increased too
---
It’s not that I use it, I don’t.  It’s just that it’s rotated 90 degrees, and it’s in your way when you go up to use all the other crafting stations.
---
I like to call them "Tetanus Fridges"
---
Yea they were all so...boring. Like I was expecting effects like Exotics not just linear damage or stat boosts
---
That's the only three i know of. I would say project paradise should be one you can start but it's not been bad the last 2 days thanks to teams.
---
Aren't the survivor rewards being given out unintentionally right now along with christmas and Halloween rewards? If so then you can still earn the suit, I just got the winter beanie 5 minutes ago so it's still bugged for sure. You need quite a bit of XP to get the ghillie suit though.
---
If you don’t play you shouldn’t get anything. That makes no sense
---
Did you check wendigo cave, Charleston capitol, kiddie corner, treetops? Those are pretty much guaranteed spawns for cryptids.
---
no shame in it. given the limited amount of time I have to play I'll have no choice but to pay if I want to complete all levels of the event.
---
You better slow down. It’s suppose to be impossible to complete remember.
---
This is a slap in the fucking face
---
You have to do some specific shenanigans to get the vendor bug, and no, getting stuff stolen thanks to a hack in game isn't a thing. Also how'd you get the vendor bug if you haven't played since December?
---
I just loaded and unloaded at the Halloween store.
---
I've noticed that on PC there are a lot of afkers at the Morgantown high school.
---
They just need to listen to the community more I’m not even going to try and do legendary run till they fix it half the time I don’t get score so what’s the point
---
This and the fact that the ammo machine is an utter failure.
---
Well i only asked because i saw it on the challenge tab but i thought you couldn’t get it anymore, and wanted it clarified but i still don’t know. It still looked like it could be earned on the challenge menu.
---
It's shameful that pc players were able to create a perk load out mod in the first week of release on pc, yet us on consoles are still waiting over a year later.
---
Making the inoculation was the closest it got, now all we do is nuke the place to collect materials so we can jump higher and run fast
---
Also it’s made by the people who literally made the original games/lore, and owned the IP.
---
Yeah I saw the calculation and it's maddening. There's absolutely no way we can lvl up to 100 within given time. OP must be cheating
---
lol how rebuilt is it supposed to get?
---
really we should/could all be dead or ghouls by the time the next FO in the timeline starts...
---
That’s pretty crazy if you were on Xbox I’d pay you to make my base like that
---
It's because xbox live is spotty right now.
---
[Great kid! Don’t get cocky!](https://youtu.be/nN9xsFUsPqM)
---
Workaround: Embrace being the Lone Survivor. Teamwork did not make the dream work, it made the bombs fall and acid rain burn them all.
---
Most people don’t though.  They just play it when there are good rewards then immediately stop once they get them.
---
I don’t have an interest in it either.
---
Congrats mate.
---
Settlers have made a grand total of 1 settlement.  Raiders have spread out to two other spots.
---
How great would it have been with every major patch to see a little improvement to each settlement.  Wind turbines all along foundation, more defense around crater, perhaps event a settlement or two popping up on the map as a permanent home.
---
This x100
---
Ohhhh, my bad. I was gonna say, teach me your tricks lol.
---
Personally yes, absolutely worth it. Class Freak makes it even better, and running a build team pretty much denies the lost INT points.
---
All I got from the beginning was 84 rounds and that's what I still have lol
---
Yea I’ll be rolling when he old enough to make a bloodied vats stealth build
---
i mean the game is still filled with glitches theyve acknowledged since beta so I honestly wouldnt bet on it happening anytime soon lmao
---
It was "fixed" a few patches ago but continues to be fucking awful.
---
Never did nuclear winter, ever, no interest in pvp.  But I wanted that ghillie suit and I was able to bush wookie all the Christmas, Halloween and Survivors rewards in two days.  Even got lucky and won a match.   Very happy with a great haul of skins, outfits and other stuff.
---
Really do think it got something to do with server condition. If I see rubberbanding, I just switch builds so that I can use something that does not rubberband
---
Very creative a buddy of mine built a tie fighter which was pretty sweet
---
I had almost the same thing happen to me. Did a random looking post on Xbox looking for screws I think I needed like 20. Really small ask. This guy's invites me to his party and team and proceeded to give me a huge amount of screws. Then presents. Just loaded me up. Thank God too bc I was about to give up. I was at like level 30 something and  the game was starting to kick my ass. Now I try to take the time every single play session to find a low level player and give them a fully modded fixer or handmade, ammo, stims, radaway, and any junk plans I have at the time.  And then fly away in my SS jetpack and speed demon serum to show them what their future holds lol
---
Yea no room at the moment for 2 TVs and a baby
---
The game will die way before this bug. It happens with many weapons and at least, in my experience (playing since release, daily, all builds, etc.) Once you trigger it, there is no fixing. It's like the weapon gets broken and you can't nerf yourself to fix it. The game can't do the math. 
---
My godrolls (bloodied explosive handmade, bloodied faster fire Tesla) don't hit as hard as my bloodied SMG. 
---
My shotgunner causes less damage with a furious shotgun and all perks on, than my melee warrior with a regular lvl 25 shotgun he loots from an enemy. 
---
It just works.
---
Before we were getting Atoms for dailies/weeklies that were not very time consuming. Now they've taken those, reduced the amount, and locked them behind tile ranks on this stupid gameboard, forcing participation that takes exponentially longer. It's beyond shitty.
---
Go watch Angry Turtle's videos.  All of them LOL.  He is a master of the game and loves to teach.
---
you just have to wait. literally sit there, put your controller down, and wait a few minutes
---
masturbate
---
Does this happen to you every time?
---
I tried that it just wouldn’t let me respawn. I put this post together while waiting actually
---
Just go there, start the quest, fast travel away and come back in 6 minutes.  You'll still get notes and credit for the event.
---
mind sharing your exp route? i need something fresh after consistently hitting west tek, burrows, and charleston capitol.
---
2500 atoms? Are you trying to take the food out of my kids’ mouths?
---
will do, how do you go about making sure to get the right mutations? just sit about in radiation, get one, if it's not good for me, radaway, repeat?
---
I swear I grouped with you yesterday
---
Thanks!  I've been wondering where to find that.
---
I have gun Fu working well.
---
How many hours did that take if you don't mind me asking?
---
I think my run was around 2 hours or so from start to finish with killing the queen. It was long but not too bad I thought. I bet it will get faster over time but 30 min! That’s sooooo fast!  Hard to imagine! Nice work! ☺️
---
If it's just for the sake of an event, the defend workshops that trigger after taking one count.
---
Huh? That's pretty much what I said. Mitigation is much better than dr because dr drops hard. It's why bloodied builds are so tough, mitigation by percentage make effective health pools huge. 20% health of your health is maybe 50 points, losing 10 or 12 on getting hit. 20% of a build with several mitigation perks might be 100 with incoming damage being a point or two.
---
Started from scratch in NW and got all the Christmas, Halloween, and Survivor rewards in two days of being a bunny in a bush.  Even got lucky and won a match, great haul of stuff, love the blue camo power armor skin and especially the ghillie suit.
---
Usually answer the same question over and over on whether my load screen picture is, in fact, still a scorched beast. (He's three, and yes he asks literally Every. Single. Time!) Lol
---
Honestly, I either have a sip of my coffee or a sip of my beer depending on the time of day. I realIzed I was doing this unconsciously and was drinking way too fast.
---
He was exactly like that when I visited him yesterday.
---
Lol
---
Make a sandwich, grab a soft drink, use the bathroom.
---
not what i ment, what im getting at is now everyone sucks BECAUSE of one of the crutch perks being broken.
---
we need more GOOD perks not all pigeonholed into one or 2 perks
---
Be glad yours even shows up. Mine has all but moved out, it seems.
---
West tec
---
Yeaaa I’ve been going pretty hardcore an I’m only Lv 18 damn dude lol
---
Much better. But keep in mind.... You can always make an Acronym.
---
They changed project paradise a few months ago to be like normal events.
---
As long as you select the one from power.
---
There is still a non generator version in the misc structures tab
---
Oh I WISH there was a new ladder! Some glorious day...
---
Heh, no, it was just a standard ladder that was hidden underneath a rug that went down to some 1x1 wooden walls + floor cubes.
---
It''s the best non PA armour in the game. You don't need the mask it adds nothing.
---
As for "grinding events" You could do 6 or 7 events in a casual day of playing and get enough treasury notes to get your 200 bullion for the day. That's not even 30 mins of gameplay. 
---
not to mention you can do the dailies for davenport and both factions to get them as well. 
---
Also max gold is 5000 not 2000. And you can buy 300 gold from smiley for 6000 caps. 
---
also this is endgame stuff. It's not meant to be gotten easily.
---
Just got one from her.
---
I just server hopped the Graften Monster near Poseidon Energy and Charleston
---
Sofia disappeared but the console is still there? Did you try scrapping and replacing the console?
---
When the broke gun fu it was broke for quite some time.  Shuffle some points around agility is the best stat for good perks.
---
Nice, because this thing sucks.
---
scrap her console. Then build it again.
---
My rng is baaaaad lol, just got unlucky and a little frustrated when something I thought would take me minutes took me hours.
---
Whitesprings vendors. Im pretty sure I bought the plan off of one of them. Then play normally. Eventually you will not only get a Max level one but it will be legendary. And then you can craft them and it doesn't have many mods so scrapping them to get the mods wont take very long at all.
---
I did the same, got all the Christmas, Halloween, and Survivor rewards including the Ghillie suit which was my primary aim.  Love the blue camo PA skin too.  Surprisingly fun, and nerve wracking, sitting in a bush all day, got a bunch of crossword puzzles done too.
---
This is what I've been doing too, but I still think you shouldn't have to change an entire build just because of a bug that Bethesda refuses to acknowledge
---
Ahh thats a glitch, you prob have healing factor. They will never fix that as it poses no monetary value to them to fix it. You learn to play around it ive had it for a couple months already
---
"live action better be accurate to the fallout experience" I mean, it's bethesda, at this point they don't know what "fallout experience" means
---
Fast travel to the Whitespring Resort to start. From that spawn point, kill the two sentry bots patrolling right next to you, then run to the other side of the building to kill the other patrolling sentry bot for an easy 3k exp (assuming they spawned at your level). From there I go to Huntersville ----&gt; West Tek -----&gt; National Isolated Radio Array -----&gt; Harpers Ferry -----&gt; Pylon V-13 (kill the animals there then head slightly west to kill some mutants at the workshop if they're there) ----&gt; back to Whitespring, sometimes the sentry bots have already respawned. Then server hop after that.
---
Where is the burrow location you're talking about?
---
Existential dread.
---
Oh, that's easy to clarify on. The ghillie suit skins for armors are going to be obtainable for as long as SCORE is going on. The ghillie suit cosmetic outfit is only earnable in Nuclear Winter for a brief time because it's bugged and being awarded when it's not supposed to be.
---
I have a four tile high cross I put down all the time, it says PRAY in neon letters on the front haha
---
Well, medium grinding is good. But some people are lazy af, change my mind.
---
Same thing with gramps for me. He keeps telling me he needs space
---
Yep. Scrapped and replaced the console, turned it off and back, moved camp, still no Sofia. All I said was I thought Silver Shroud could take Mistress of Mystery...
---
But no, she’s really just not showing up.
---
Same here! I’ve done the DMV route so many times that I have become J47.
---
I’m just not using it until it’s improved.
---
It helps that I started a new (shotgun) character and can just transfer a bunch of ammo from my old character when needed.
---
Oh that was the old way when people didn't have recipes and serums. 
---
You can now just buy the mutations you want. Most players sell them for around 300-400 caps. i have seen them as low as 200. You need class freak to reduce the negative effects of the mutations. And you need starched genes to make sure you don't lose them. 
---
PRO TIP: Once you have mutations use diluted rad-x as it gives you rad proection but doesn't supress your mutations like rad x would
---
we literally used to get  enough free atoms to buy more than the amount of stuff offered in 3 months with the previous challenge system, not only that but we get no choice in what we unlock now.
---
we get less, for more work, and get choice removed from the equation. bethesda will continue to offer less and less for more and more money because people like you come out of the woodwork to give them money. they made the season a grindy shit show because they know damn well lazy people like you will shell out. youre getting had, and you dont realize it.
---
Yeah i mean if everyone could play all day, it would be easy haha
---
Yep, spent all day today in the bush and got ALL the Christmas, Halloween and Survivor rewards.  Love the ghillie suit and the blue camo pa skin.
---
🤷‍♂️
---
right on..
---
im still not playing much at all because adrenaline is broken.. glad to hear you cashed out
---
Felt great, didn't it?
---
I've tried it with my weapon holstered and also with no weapon equipped at all and it still wont move or rotate, can you confirm that it's still working for you?
---
About 10 each day for the past three days. I'm sure there's plenty of room for optimization though. 
---
Also, think of it this way, you could easily spread that time out over multiple days or weeks to make up for missing a few days of challenges.
---
Same with Gramps. It worked one day, now he just tells me, "Shhh, not right now, kid."
---
In my opinion, this game is perfect to play while listening to podcasts, I've always appreciated the fact that I can put on fo76 and just turn my brain off and relax; so usually I chuck on a podcast in the background
---
It’s happening for a lot of weapons.
---
Started to happen a lot more on my stealth commando than usual too.
---
Now that I’m playing a shotgun character it is a lot more noticeable BUT that can also be because enemies are too close.
---
I wonder what would happen if I had a short shotgun for enemies on top of me
---
Same, I sell all non plasma core ammo for 1 cap, and plasma cores for 25. I retail most plans at 10-25 caps, cheap enough for new players or collectors to snap up. I try to keep inventory moving, but I don't have a lot of luck.
---
Burrows is in Harper's Ferry, pretty decent dungeon.
---
Well I disagree with 30 mins of playing I get lucky if I get 1-2 Events that give gold per hour, my main point was it increase the amount your aloud to trade in and the max overall amount, and it’s not necessarily hard to get but more annoying it’s locked behind a cap of how much gold I could get that’s what I don’t like
---
Hmm, well then that might be all. They really should add a few more then my golly theres so few.
---
It’s been fine for me lately - I thought they fixed it...
---
i concur
---
It's all HEAVY gear isn't it?
---
Aside from the fact that they did both in the OP and in their replies before your confusingly hostile nagging eroded their will to keep up, it is irrelevant. They are enabled (just like you and I) by this community to post whatever they want as long as it fits the rules. You specifically didn't even do that and still insist on debating the content of their post to justify your opinion while simultaneously discouraging OP from expressing theirs because you disagree with it.
---
Gonna add some spawns for op. Flooded Train Yard often has lots of snally, so does the middle of Charleston, Often a Wendigo at the Fear Shack and at the station South East of Fissure Site Prime. Grafton monsters in the garden of White springs, near descent toward Charleston, and in the area south of Hemlock Holes. The Daily hunters mission also can fulfill one. Mothman can be found at cult sites sometime. Sheepsquach at the end of Free Range. Farming Random Encounter locations also can lead to cryptids, especially sheepsquach.
---
wow some brainwashed pay piggy shit.
---
day 3 and you already want to shell out. fuckin pathetic.
---
Yup
---
that would be tight if there was a real trade dialogue.. you could even make housecalls
---
This is exactly why i stopped playing Destiny. 
---
But really, if you think they can create a Wastelanders style expansion every three months, you are dreaming.
---
Yeah and I keep trying to pull his finger
---
The modding community figured out settlement building, they need to take some notes.  I like the C.A.M.P but I shudder while building.
---
I've read some stuff about anti-cheat software, but idk.
---
It is in protest of Bethesda locking 250 score behind a game mode that most are not interested in, it is a blatant arm twist.  It will be next to impossible to complete the season without getting the score from NW and Bethesda designed it that way to try to save a dying mode.  I'll continue hiding in bushes and picking up my free 250, thanks for your concern though.
---
Eat, change music, refill water, answer emails etc.
---
That’s where Bethesda screwed up at with time alive giving the most XP
---
I switched to Beckett to see if I get a quest, then will switch back to see if it resets something.

Workshops just seem like such a strange design decision. You're supposed to build on them but there's no point, if you want resources you'll have to check on them constantly, and you always have to micro-manage them since there's always attacks and repairs that need to be done. In public worlds everyone's supposed to fight over them too but it's just not worth it.
---
I figure if it fails in most regards it can at least be an opportunity to create something nice and make fun builds.
---
Never played NW before, never did pvp in any game, so no way I am gonna be competitive, but I wanted the ghillie suit so I went the bush route and almost always finished in the top ten, even got lucky and won a match when someone got careless.  Got all the Christmas, Halloween and Survivor rewards in two days.  Pretty fun being a bush hugger when those rewards kept coming in.
---
I pretty much only see that in the mobs that you can see that arent really there...
---
The fancy weapons are valuable to collectors. Even more so if they have good legendary traits.
---
Hmmmm
---
Well thats why they're getting my lovely voice all over their speakers lol and why I can only offer the pricing for players talking to me via psn message or active headset.
---
Mabye they are pacifists.  Just cuz bucket of bolts zed tell you to kill dont mean you.gotta.
---
Server hopping exists. You look for those events that offer notes. And like i said davenport and faction dailies give you like 9 or 10 or something. 
---
And once again. It's endgame armour and weapons. You're supposed to work for it. It's not supposed to be had within a week. Because some people play this game like 16 hours a day and they'd have all the new stuff weeks and moths before everyone else. By putting caps on stuff it stops that.
---
I tried this over the past few days with no change
---
The predator and alien franchises would like a word with you on if hiding is a valid tactic or not, oh and Batman. All very aggressive combat ready people.
---
I sell plans for 10% of suggested price. Also all my ammo is one cap and i have some cheap meds too.  My camp has a swimming pool though so i also sell overpriced swimsuits and sunglasses. People always buy me out though, and then they splash in the water and take photos so it makes me happy.
---
It's happening to me too on Xbox
---
If you aren't supposed to hide why is there a ghillie suit?
---
People gain more points by surviving as long as possible, not by kills.  By definition it’s a tactic, and the best one.
---
LOL.. Upvoted.
---
i had to do it a few times and also build a different ally item
---
Yep. Same.
---
Not fixed. At all. Play every day after work. Same sh*t, different day.
---
Megasloth is not a cryptid.
---
You're getting confused with the "Kill large enemies" challenge we used to have. Which included - in addition to all the cryptids - sloths, deathclaws, SBs, etc.
---
BG sucks the incentive is to survive not kill ....
---
I did this for the last two days, started from scratch and got all the Christmas, Halloween and Survivor rewards.  Almost always finished in the top ten with no kills, but averaged a bit over 400 points.  Just stayed still in the bush and moved only when I was forced to.  Got lucky and won one with three kills at the end, 900 points for that one.  Very happy to get my ghillie.
---
sweet i appreciate it, this should throw some flavor into what im doing.
---
the other user beat me, burrows is a dungeon just off of of harpers ferry, map symbol is a circle with a water drop in the center (entrance itself is a manhole in the road).  it spawns about 20-30 ghouls at level 42 and 62.
---
Then dont play the mode, why not spend the time grinding experience in the adventure.
---
I got a good laugh from this response, thanks.  It's pretty obviously you don't know what you're talking about.
---
I play NW for the 250 S.C.O.N.E. not for the pvp
---
Lol the title sounds like a novel
---
That’s nice. Some people like to be tactical. Some people just want the score for staying alive 30 mins. If you want to just go guns blazing you should find a new game.
---
Angry turtle. Amen. Didn’t bother watching YouTube until I saw someone else give him a shout out. Good shit. No joke.
---
I got a bunch of crosswords done.  Oh, and a ghillie suit.
---
Nuclear Winter can be a drag. I personally like the mode as I like to think I'm relatively decent and was having a fun experience due to the fact I didnt run into a single hacker for once. 
---
The rewards are hella good though
---
I buy from good vendors even if they don’t have anything I want just to support them.  If your prices are insane I’m turning off all the lights in your camp and opening all the doors.  Passive aggressive?  Sure.  Pointless?  You betcha.  Fun?  Yeppers.
---
Get a full troubleshooters sentinel set
---
You could probably have got through the 30k xp needed for 300 SCORE in adventure though. Granted the use stimpaks one almost tempted me into NW, but I didn't want to invest 30m into it. 
---
I suppose if you were afk it would make sense though.
---
lmao imagine taking 76 BR seriously
---
Because a grind through Westek/Golf Course/DMV twice nets me less score than a stealthy bush in NW while I have a few beers.  Blame Bethesda for not rewarding the XP grind sufficiently.
---
Not sure why you're getting downvoted, but yes. Somehow cancel culture didn't knock him out in the previous wave though and he's been quick to be able to delete negative remarks or inferences.
---
Where is your camp setup?  If you want a steady stream post up in white springs, Watoga or the savage divide.  Any place high level.  If you’re already setup there then what are you selling?  If you have mostly plans and armor people will skip you to avoid apparel and large present plans.
---
PA is still required of you want to min/max a heavy Gunner build
---
Thanks.
---
Faction dailies only give like 3 and I just think 200 is to low for the cost of the items the attachments on the weapons cost 250 gold per if the max is 200 at least make the prices lower it takes 6 days just to be able to get the chest piece..... I just don’t like how it’s like that in my opinion it’s just not worth the time
---
P.s. can we find a way to shut her up!
---
No, and I agree visually it would make sense to show yours as well.
---
I find this is usually a connection issue. Your computer registered the damage so the health goes down, then it updates with the server but it doesn't upload the damage you did so the health goes back up. 
---
Sadly this may not be an issue you can fix, as it just might be the servers acting up.
---
Same is true on PC if you play with a controller.
---
Toxic larys dude
---
There's a Wendigo at Sons of Dane compound.
---
I use fallout 1st mainly, I guess it could be a problem with that.
---
B O O M
---
The stimpaks one was another arm twist.  You had to actually get out of your bush and go find them.
---
Damn right.    
---
Must have the intro game theme or something very close to it.    
---
IMO, there should be a wide variety of people and none of that garbage ID politics.
---
Pick my nose
---
I don't think that would cause an issue. I have this happen to me on the rate occasional and i have both good internet and I don't have first.
---
I'm on PC as well.DocB30tn is my user so feel free to stop my my CAMP. I tend to play later at night around this time for a hours. I have all crafting benches on that one, a stash box outside, and an ammo converter. I might have a few things I can spare but nothing like most people.    
---
Make sure you have a good build on the Nukes and Dragons site.    
---
Many quests net gear which is leveled according to the player. I would highly suggest avoiding Wastelanders b/c an early item give in that sucks at lower levels. Once you're 50 then these items usually scale to 45 and 50 respectively. More damage, better effects, better condition bar, etc.    
---
Don't hoard everything. Metal is very easy to come buy but if Bulk stats you can sell it off for extra caps.    
---
The level up screen has two stages. The first is adding a point to whatever special you want and the next is choosing a card which can be in ANY SPECIAL. There is a filter option at the bottom.    
---
IMO, try to craft soups b/c they fill both the water and food meter. Less weight for more. If you're not going to use chems extensively, throw all them in your stash. Sell them at vendors for extra cash but there is a perk and Aid items which boost CHA for better ROI.    
---
Metal armor is best for melee and ballistic resistance. Leather is better for energy. I believe Combat armor has the best for both but weighs more.    
---
END Perks tend to be ease of life perks. IMO, every build should have at least 3 points for extra carry weight and essential carrying perks.
---
Jesus two weeks??
---
Imagine intentionally ruining another player's experience because you can play the game like a normal person. Kinda sounds like one shotting legendaries at an event
---
They all jump behind the school on some rocks right?
---
They aren't being proactive though. This, by definition, is reactive.
---
Why not actually try and have fun in the game instead of sitting in a bush
---
I'm trying to learn how to make a mod to replace her audio with silence. I found most of the audio files in question.
---
I think it just doesn't show it. You can see the X4 at the top.
---
Yea
---
Thank you for clearing up that it isn't only me! HAHA 
---
I have been pleading with my damn TV that my bar needs blue if 'the new guy that just showed up' has a bar that I can watch fill up right in front of me! I assume it is meant to represent your bond with the fellow teammates. Essentially they see my name with a filled up bond bar while they don't have a bar themselves. Rather odd visual representation/no hint that says hey dummy, you won't see a bar for yourself.
---
Squad goals :)
---
Once again. Endgame items. not meant to be had for weeks and months.
---
If you just play the game normally you'd have them eventually.
---
You think ppl hide just to ruin your experience? Can’t tell if you’re serious or not because that’s just silly.
---
Lol I am on ps4
---
Yea, it is starting to make sense to me now. How it is meant to display a teammates bond to myself while they see one of me to them, haha.
---
I've ignored her for a few days, but she definitely gave me a quest today. 
---
I mean... I didn't do it, but she definitely gave it to me.
---
I do have plenty of fun, I grind at least 70K of XP every day in adventure.  NW doesn't interest me in the slightest.  You try to kill someone when you have no perks and some shitty revolver you found in a crate.  The players who have the perks are the only ones who have a real chance of consistently doing well.  It is like wondering why level 10 players don't really think it is wise to engage Level 250 players in Adventure.  Because it is pointless.  I only play NW because I have to in order to get the score.  I didn't design the system.
---
Just gotta make sure, ya know?
---
I like to share Team Medic, never seen anyone share it before. As a counterpoint I wouldn’t always share Rad Sponge, or at least don’t share it if you think a teammate is a Bloodied build.
---
It's not even technically about who the most aggressive is. I take it you're using that stance from Zax as proof of how to "properly" play the mode (unless that's your own personal opinion), but Zax is clearly not the best judge of what is or isn't acceptable in terms of testing for qualities of leadership.
---
While I'd agree that experience gains in Nuclear Winter need reworking, I wouldn't ever agree there's a "proper" or "regular" way to play the mode. If someone gets the drop on me because they hid in a shrub and I couldn't see them, their tactic worked, and mine didn't. They made the better decision, and my reaction wasn't good enough.
---
I've seen arguments against Aqua Boy/Girl in a similar vein as your complaint about hiding in bushes. Thing is, if the circle closes on the center of the lake by Grafton Steel and Grafton Dam, it doesn't matter how good of a shot you are. You need Radaway/Rad-X, or you're dead in the water. Same thing, then, with the bushes. If it gives you the upper hand, go for it.
---
If they take the PvP out of workshops in adventure I’ll have a real life stroke
---
Do i have any other option to store my stuff? Because the stash capacity is no good. I mean is ridiculous to have lock doors that other player can lockpick them and all this defense just for show. Please tell me im wrong... Because i bought cheaper like ark, atlas, rust, h1z1 and none of them came with this crap. Please tell me that this is a joke.
---
I went to the flooded train yard near Watoga, killed 5 Snallygasters after previously killing the Flatwoods Monster during Queen of the Hunt. I only got credit for one cryptid kill and was unable to finish the daily's. I then killed a Wendigo during my Ally quest...still just 1 out of 3.
---
Really cause I've won games with shotgunner perks while using a Rifle
---
Pipe, life is!
---
At this point, changing your build to an end-game one looks to be tedious unless you have dedicated friends who can help.
---
How will I hide monkey heads in people's camps now!?
---
I've gotten a couple of them 2 or 3 days in a row at the Purveyor shop...
---
They should absolutely give SCORE.  Events are so much more fun when more people join.  Stupid to not give SCORE.  It's a huge incentive to join public events.
---
I have a build using pipe rifles and revolvers because you can use both pistol and rifle perks. It worked out really well because you can start using them very early and you'll have lots of time to keep an eye out for nice legendaries in vendors.
---
Like the other user responded, that’s games with gold. Game pass is Netflix. New games get added into rotation as some gets removed. There’s a PC version too. It’s the best thing this generation
---
then tell bethesda to make make score challenges for NW. noone wants to play that shit mode but we have to if we want all the score.
---
if you want BR go play a real BR not this bullshit, the rest of us just want the fuckin challenge done.
---
The current version should never have gotten to alpha.
---
Sure the bush can give you an upper hand, but what advantage does it give you if your hiding in a bush with no plan on coming out
---
That’s not a bad price for a buyer.  Assault rifles aren’t hot garbage.
---
The play the mode like a normal person.
---
My main is 45 and I've had made a mistake in not getting Starched Genes and 30 and 31. I ended up getting Marsupial by sheer luck and had to level twice very carefully with health the health bar irradiated. She's not 45 and Class Freak hits at 46. Maxed out that greatly reduces the negeative effects.    
---
Rad-X MUTES your mutations for however long it is effective so I wouldn't use them anymore if you are going to have a mutated character on any level.
---
Not close. Junkies is better.
---
I missed out too..dang!
---
Inspirational seems to stack I think
---
I like to share gunfu
---
I’ve got junkies but I was just wondering how much of a difference there was
---
Dude, don't discount the fact that most adventure players are already grinding 2-3 hours at a minimum each day to get the dailys done, the score challenges done, get enough XP and buy gold/modules/etc.  Most if not all of us resent having to then log into NW for another 30-60 minutes to get necessary score that is locked behind a mode we don't want to play.  The grind is already tedious enough.
---
So wait, if it’s bugged and still being awarded that means i could get it?
---
Your team's goal should be winning the match. I don't pvp much and am not that good at it. I am good at moving and hiding and every time I've played (not much) i've lasted until the storm makes the play area small.
---
Or the suit was help you sneak up on your opponent
---
If you want heavy Gunner yes, focus on Strength. Start by taking melee perks, and be prepared to run a melee build for quite awhile. You'll have to transition into heavy Gunner late game when you'll be able to fuel your weapons with ammo. You're also going to want PA... The specific power armor your using isn't all that important, but you'll want to make sure to have a good amount of points in Intelligence for Stabilized and if you're going Bloodied, nerd rage. If you're using a Gatling Laser you'll also want power user. And don't ignore agility either, you'll want some ranks of Adreneline (when it's fixed anyway)... And under luck in addition to Starched Genes and Class Freak you'll want One Gun Army. You can pretty well ignore Perception (just three points, and you'll be switching cards here on a situational basis)... And you don't need much in Endurance, just Radicool if bloodied or either Fireproof or Lifegiver, which ever works best for you.
---
I would never share the rad sponge perk just as a matter of ettiquette. Quality of life perks likes strong back or bandolier are always appreciated, as is pharma-finda
---
So 30 hours total? Jesus that’s a lot of time.
---
That is why most just hide in a bush.  Doing that for 20 minutes will usually get you 1000 xp.
---
attrition is literally how you win a BR anyway, but i guess thats just over your head. go play COD
---
The mode is a choice if u really spend that much time playing the game then just grind experience in adventure.
---
Yo everyone who downvoted you really doesn’t understand sarcasm 👀
---
I ended up with several.  I think it was a reward on some events, but may have been mutants at the prison break event..  To me they are a waste of space. Can't sell them and don't care to use them.
---
You should buy Metro, Very good as I’m doing a play through right now. Trying to get the Iron Man achievement.
---
Capture as many workshops as possible. Do not do the defend quest. instead wait for it to be captured by the enemy and then do the retake quest. Quicker and easier. So you get xp, loot and plans for capturing it. Then Xp, loot and plans for retaking it. Also free travel points. 
---
Couple of points in luck. More than likely you're gonna have at LEAST 5 in luck with a proper build if you have mutations. Take at least 1 rank of pharma farma for finding more meds. You could stack intelligence first to get those sweet xp gains.
---
also lone wanderer (I you plan on playing by yourself but you should join a public team. Look for a building team as you get int boost. more int = more xp). Travelling pharmacy (even just 1 point only until 50+). pack rat (even just one point only until 50+). lock pick/hacking +1 (not essential). Butchers bounty or green thumb for food. Probably want butchers bounty if melee. With the new public teams maybe 1 point in inspirational for xp gains. Scrapper. thru hiker (maybe 1)
---
Yup.  This is how I managed to complete my dailies today.
---
Just got a Halloween gun skin.
---
how about a no thirst and hunger perk so they dont have to take it out of the game..?
---
also.. your suggestions are not all completely broken god mode cards.. well played...
---
i wasnt home and was planning on playing it with a buddy, we just wanted to know, if your not gonna be helpful then dont comment
---
They'll be back, eventually, if the current state of this patch continues to be as shitty as it is.
---
I really like the idea of.... really all of them! I really only find the secrets of power armor one to be maybe a little overpowered, but then again, it would be a legendary perk card. Overall your point is extremely valid and I agree with it 101%, and I love all of the creative perks you came up with! I would most definitely try and score a couple of those legendary cards for sure!
---
It increases limb damage, but iirc it technically doesn’t do x2 damage. The first shot does full damage, but the second does 66%. But pretty much yeah, on base terms, TS increases your chance to cripple limbs in ‘one’ shot
---
I never see mine either.
---
TS accuracy blows
---
Do you recall where you got the Shielded plan for casual underarmor?   I’ve been trying for a while to get it to drop from some events.
---
If you decide to stick to the bushes, and don't have a plan for how to get away, that's the players' fault. If I ever need to hide somewhere, I make a plan for where to go, and what weapon to run with. Same as you would running or scouting; the tactic used isn't more or less valid just because it isn't inherently aggressive. All depends on the execution.
---
Thanks i unlocked up to the jack o lantern armor last night but haven’t gotten any more tonight, I guess the last reward is a bigger xp gap than the rest
---
How is the space ship im racing already through the fiest color section and im only getting the ammo convertor now 😅
---
Instead of making it free, charge people but actually expand and quality assurance it ya know. Beth fucked up and we’re paying the price with all these limits.
---
People accused me of lying but ignored that part of the screenshot. I mean I know math is hard and all but come on, lol.
---
Seriously, how do you make it work?
---
Junkie's is also one of the "magic" effects listed so you can most likely one shot every thing that isn't a boss.
---
Ok, thanks
---
That would be nice but I’d prefer if they just gave me score for the ones I’ve completed instead of giving me nothing for it
---
Fax
---
Bruh I can’t even use legendary flamers because for some reason they do no damage on my end.
---
It's not fixed. We've had this issue at other events too.
---
I was wondering the same. Should have gotten the NW beanie but I don't see it. Hoping that the last two rewards drop tonight.
---
Samesies
---
My bad, It was me. I've been taking them to mix with my vodka...
---
Someone left a full set of X-01 pa with a nuka paint job in my camp ... I sell everything half of what it suggests and fusions cores priced at the charge level...
---
This ALWAYS happens to me when doing Crit Headshots in VATS. It will show their health go to 0, then leave VATS, and the enemy will be full health.
---
Grafton monsters count, sheepsquatches do too.
---
According to google, a cryptid is basically a creature of myth that hasnt been fully proven to exist, or something like that
---
two shit is garbage.
---
JE is good stuff.
---
the problem is that two shot explosive triple dip on item degradation.
---
I'm pretty tapped from the steam sale, but I likely will in the future. It's the best looking STALKER-ish game atm imo
---
No you didn't, it's bugged get on it before they patch.
---
I've never even got it there, I only get it at the SBQ fight, if you die too close to the end your camera is stuck spinning over and over and over? yeah just set your controller down for about 7 minutes
---
Make sure you are not on a team already before you try to create one.
---
Except it's bugged RN and you can get the rewards for the last three NW limited time events.
---
OP it is bugged you can get it if you hurry before the patch
---
It's in the regular "team" section of the social menu, not the Public Teams section. Select your name and then "leave team".
---
Nancy Drew is under quarantine, so you'll have to hope the Hardy Boys are up for the job.
---
I used to use a TSE lever action and it was horrendous on durability
---
Probably a bit more. The Assault Rifle is criminally underated and those are god rolls.
---
There's really nothing wrong with someone pointing out the bullshit that exists in something. 
---
Op isn't bullshitting. Some people do feel like it's a chore &amp; etc. Calling bs on something bs, is bs.
---
Also it's good for people to voice this, that way others can possibly get their stuff, if they're on the same platform that is.
---
Yeah I’m in the same situation
---
Cause getting the jumpy juice in our systems is the best method of surviving in Appalachia.
---
Watch the entire bee movie
---
I haven’t had one in two days and I’ve tried removing and replacing every ally and rebooting the game.  Squat.  I was so mad I put my ally in the mole suit until they learned their lesson.
---
Lmao i was gonna offer 3k. I thought the assualt rifle was a terrible weapon.
---
playing this solo, just taking the game at a slow pace, not in any rush to get to end game. so even if it takes quite a bit of time that's okay, gives me something to aim for. :)
---
thank you, will do.
---
No captiol Building?  It’s chocked full of ghouls.
---
I love how immersive it is, and while I still think Last Light is better narratively I can’t deny how fun it is to travel around Russia.
---
Dang I'm disappointed even the gamepass version won't carry over from Xbox, that's the one thing keeping me from buying it on pc. This game is begging for pve crossplay and cross progress
---
Well it is very convoluted but it does work, it just takes forever with the lack of any kind of mass  converting, but that also goes for everything else as well, try smelting 300 lead ore after doing a luckyhole mine run. It's also a pita to get out of the menu because you can't simply back out like in a normal terminal, oh and don't be in PA and try to use the menu you'll squat down and stare at the strut holding up the keyboard and not be able to see the terminal screen. It's just another egregious flaw in a would be decent system.
---
Obligatory joke: Your moms house.
---
Yuk yuk yuk.
---
I've been getting it whenever I'm in a team and not the leader, when I'm on my own they show the original icon
---
I'm on PS4, I just keep tapping X every couple of seconds to keep cycling through.
---
Damn at this point more people upvoted this comment over the actual post.
---
There is a bug since the patch that is letting you get rewards from the last three limited time NW events. The influx might have a bit to due with that.
---
Yeah I was really hoping for that character progression atleast
---
I like showing up in power armor, gifting them and doing the robot dance and then sprinting off..lol.
---
There are always more than 3 snallys.
---
I already had the ghillie suit unlocked so I'm not 100% sure if the Survivors rewards that lead up to it are being given out now but I think they are. If you do a NW round and get a Wasteland loveseat after 150 xp then you can get the ghillie suit cosmetic outfit.
---
Something to try that works about 50% of the time is crouch and try again. If that doesn't work just walk in any direction a short distance and try again.
---
Stat into blunt weapons early on, boards, bats, etc. 
---
Water and food will heal you up to a decent degree
---
Grab all the junk you can hold, scrap it, find a train station and sell it 
---
Continue doing quests and you'll get lots of stims and food
---
The score rewards incentivize and encourage this kind of behavior.
---
Blame Bethesda, don't blame the players.
---
That’s gotta be why i saw it in the menu
---
Git gud scrub lol jk. I can help. You on now?
---
Ghillie Suits aren't designed to make it easier to approach, they are designed to hide. IRL they are used to help a sniper hid in brush. People in bushes are absolutely using as intended.
---
Ah, I try to not go above Medium, and prefer Light. I like to be agile. Even with all Light gear though, it seems as though I can go higher if you're reaching 700+ with no Bolstering or Vanguard, or Barbarian, whch honestly just seems really unlikely, but I've never checked out Heavy gear.
---
And this is a good example why it's not a bad thing to make a post that you're leaving.
---
Hopefully you're both on the same platform though.
---
Imagine taking ANY game seriously
---
I’ve opted for max dps on my top 2 characters. Don’t care if I die but I’m takin it with me. About as much fun as you can have in the game in its current state.
---
I had one and it absolutely shredded enemies.  That a good buy
---
That paragraph needs some work, home skillet~
---
This sub overreacts to literally everything. Don't bother trying to be logical with them.
---
yes but only for 15 but I will be on later
---
If you can get enough XP, yeah. I've unlocked a couple of the NW survivor rewards yesterday and tonight due to it being bugged right now.
---
Where are the train stations?
---
Their pretty hard to find at first. Try the hospitals with the pharma farm perk and alot of boxes will have stims and radaway. Also I'm on most days same gt as on here hit me up if you see me on I can set you up if you don't want to spend the time farming.
---
Add, IDeathknell. When you is on I'll join
---
Your input is duly noted.
---
Step 12- 2 days at 8 hours a day.
---
Could have been more steps if I didn't waste 1-2 hours on the ammo conversion. All dailies and finished weekly. No NW
---
Praise the Mothman!
---
When I started this game I expected, at worst it would be all PvP or, at best, indifference. Instead it is mostly all of us vs the wasteland.
---
Is it like a huge grind for it, i was about to get on nuclear winter, how many games would you expect it to be?
---
so item degridation works based on hits, which shotguns deal alot of because of pellets, then the two shot doubles that, and then the explosive is another double from the base degradation. basically almost 3 times what a vanilla shotgun is.
---
Charleston is pretty close to vault 76, that has a station. Worth looking it up and checking your map
---
It's so shitty to use, and the gains aren't worth the effort of going through the interface. I don't understand how some people are NOT upset about that.
---
Thanks that's all I could ask
---
As long as you qualify please contact us via private message.
---
Yes!!!

https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html this link will take you to a damage calculater, put in the details of the guns/perks and see for your self
---
Did you have any exp buffs active?
---
So basically psnow?  Tbh ngl i dont see the point in using a "streaming" service for games you never truely own them
---
Im rank 14, and so far I have completed every challenege that wad available, weekly, daily, and NW. I also spent several hours grinding the repeatable challenege by joining XP boosting teams, using Inspirational perk, and also killing all the ghouls at Whitesprings over and over.
---
Edit: as far as hours played over the past few days, I'd say well over 15. Stayed up all night once.
---
Haven't heard from him yet.. guess he quit reddit too
---
I was expecting a Rick-roll, I'm disappointed and excited at the same time.
---
August 4 is patch 21. They said colossal problem releases then. But nothing about perks. Patch 22 is September. Maybe then?
---
It's not just about armor and perks. The backpack depending on the mod can give 90 or either damage or energy resist. I also use grounded and scaly skins
---
Lol. Quit Reddit 🤣
---
Depends how well you play or how long you can hide in a bush haha. I think from the start it's about 14,000 xp or so.
---
Why do you have to wait for the next Season? Why can't you just add more SCORE opportunities just from obtaining EXP (100 SCORE for 10,000 is an insult, to be honest) or doing your every day stuff (dailies, public events) like you said? A lot of people here have already provided feedback on the absurdity of the grind and your only response is that you're looking into improving it in future Seasons?
---
Exactly a sniper uses it, not a child playing hide and seek
---
Im on a pretty crappy laptop right off the shelf from Staples.. 
---
its more on the "entertainment" side of things than "gaming".. but it does have a 3d card.. 
---
you may have issues without one.. /not an expert
---
You can select different clothing from the Atomic Shop. Just highlight what you want and you’ll see an option to make it a NW favorite. 
---
As for strategy, when you’re new, just spawn near the highest level person on your team. Hopefully the rest of the team does that too. Loot what you can, shoot what you can, but ultimately just try to stick together and revive people if/when they go down. 
---
You will do better overall by sticking together, even if you’re all bad. That’s the key to NW.
---
Captainnoob has a [vid](https://youtu.be/NqLyibQW2dM) that queen tested that weapon. And i think it shredded her in terms of time but that was before Beth intentionally bugged her so she wouldn't land even with crippled wings. 
---
Anyway another look at if its worth it since i would buy it is it's 6 or 7 days of selling stuff to a NPC vendor to get the max daily caps. And thats if you dont have a vending machine at your camp.
---
To add my own opinion to this. I love fallout in general. I started playing 76 a week ago,but I still go back and forth between games.
---
loadouts someday
---
At the end of the day the decision is your choice, Bethesda didn't force you to do anything
---
20, 3 days of 8ish hours.
---
Mine has a card but a bad one
---
Nah, the exp is fine maybe increase the time alive exp some more.
---

---
Great, so if I want to get to the end of my game board I have to either pay lots of money, or no-life this game.
---
Which, since I have a job and other IRL stuff (like most other people),  I cannot do.
---
Shame on them.
---
I just use 1 chameleon piece..
---
none of my armor is matched.. I care more about the legendary effects than type
---
once I get the legendary effects I desire.. then Ill swap stuff out if its got the same effects but better protection
---
Rank 16 on Xbox and 13 on PC. Xbox I’ve played what I normally do on days off—maybe 10ish hours over 3 days. I focused on XP buffs on Xbox and a couple hours of deliberate XP grind—that’s the extra levels. On PC I’ve done the challenges and very little else, maybe spent 2 hours over the 3 days.
---
Ah, well i'm not going to use mutations, even if it gimps me, i wasn't aware the...backpack could give THAT much DR lmao. I"m just so lazy to get the tadpole shit done.
---
I’ve always thought the franchise would lend itself to a great series if done correctly. I didn’t love the direction they took Westworld in but I’m hopeful they might get this right, with decent writers.
---
Cranberry relish, brain fungus soup, the inspirational perk, well rested bonus, the occasional lunchbox buff, and joining "building" public groups when they're available. Also, I have the herbivore mutation so the relish and soup give twice the boost they normally do.
---
Yeah but that still requires swapping.... I want passives baby!
---
Welcome to reddit, lol :(
---
I run an unyielding set with one piece of chameleon.  With my high special stats, sneaking is no problem at all.  I still have to use the stealth suit for radiation rumble, but the queen fight is fine with the secret service set and radshield.
---
That's actually a really good idea.
---
Not me! I sucked even when the perk was working. 😂
---
Don’t play NW the first time you log on to 76. Join Adventure then leave and you can join NW without Autocompleted challenges
---
Lastnight I had a level 12 join my team on xbox. She kept to herself and did her own thing. Other people came and went, but she stuck around. I dropped her some legendary armor I got from campfire tales, and when I was gonna log off I promoted her to leader because she was with me for the most part, and gave me the 50% bonus experience for most of my play time. Most higher levels will help out lower levels because we were there once.
---
People can have jobs and play a game too. I work 10 hour shifts at a factory 4 days a week so I have had 3 days off to grind. Don't act high and mighty because you 'have a job'. We all have jobs.
---
Ive been waiting to play since last year already, I can wait another month or two
---
try it now
---
Fallout 76 is not an MMO and its egregious that you would even call it one.
---
These camps are random and the NPCs show up randomly. The Settler Merchant (or whichever Merchant) moves around. I've also seen her in a spot near Wavy Willards and near Gauley Mine. You'll see them again.
---
Play 4 hours a day, do all dailies for the gold and for Score.  40ish INT, rested/cranberry foods, etc.  Weeklies for Score when I can, I have 2 left to finish. Grind about 50-70K xp per day.  All on a private server as a lone wolf. I've done 2 of 3 NW dailies.  Am at 15.5 on the board.
---
It’s really bad of late
---
Thanks. Thats a good advantage to herbivores.
---
Yeah, its a random spawn point. So you might try server hopping.
---
Wow! That's....wow. :D 
---
If you've got a moment, could you please use the glow in the dark stars wallpaper in a Camp and screenshot it for me? I really want it and I want to see it in use, to give myself something to work for. Thanks &lt;3
---
I can help where I can if your on later I'll be logging in in a little bit. GT is same as on here.
---
Honestly these almost sound like the normal cards we already have...
---
Well. I think this game needs Rust-like PVP. I want to steal everything. On an unrelated note: I am looking for PC playing EU based(for the ping) Enclave roleplayers to burn down bases of foreign operatives and their sympathizers
---
would be a perfect legendary perk.. breaking &amp; entering..
---
dam she was selling way cheaper than modus
---
Getting the backpack isnt that hard. Getting the plans are the real challenge. I suggesting buying the plan from another player. If ur on PC I can sell you any bp plans
---
That's because you're using a "magic" shotgun.
---
Junkie's is one of several effects that massively overperform in VATS, for some buggy and inexplicable reason.
---
For those interested

I only really care about being able to stay undetectable.
---
by mobs or by players?
---
Because they didn't add anything new with this update so we're all tired of playing the same brain dead content that we've been playing for months.
---
Bloodied does more damage and is squishier. Junkies is tankier and does plenty of damage.
---
yo stack the snowman, they can go up like 8 snowman high its awesome.
---
There are no grammatical errors in that sentence. It's an independent clause followed by a dependant clause, so it does not need punctuation to separate the clauses (unlike this sentence, which does). The only grammatical error is the lack of a period at the end of the sentence.
---
Funny thing: I did mine at level 75 and when I dropped it and killed the scorched beast queen I was level 76. The perfect ending.
---
Not even once?
---
You may be getting low level players with very little money coming by.
---
I agree, i loved the first season. And i suppose around half of the second. But i have yet to finish the third
---
In the future if she keeps playing I’ll keep an eye out for her. I’ve got a little list going of gamer tags that need a little wastelander love, and by the sound of it she could use some extra
---
Edit: my gt is khicks01
---
It's honestly really nice. Iv soloed this game almost to lvl 50 and now I'm just bumping into cool people left and right. Hope they keep doing more stuff like this. Only gripe I have is in wish we could bigger camp size
---
Its an online mmolight game.
---
As long as its not breaking TOS or exploiting/cheating, just who tf do you think you are, telling other people the "correct" way to play?
---
I'm level 123 and when it comes to visiting vendors I rarely go to any that are even remotely close to vault 76 as alot of those are either low level or are people who have vendors set for low levels. Also if they have less than 10 weapons or if they are at their camp and are less than lvl 50 I don't bother at all bc they probably don't have anything I want. Just how I do it anyways.
---
Mobs, with the CSS I can walk right through entire locations right to an objective without being seen or firing a shot and want to see if that's possible with standard armors and if it is exactly what I need to get to do it.
---
Step 13, all dailies, and all but 1 weekly done. About 2-3hrs a day.
---
I am not acting HIGH AND MIGHTY, chief.
---
I am saying, you have 2 choices, No-life the game on your days off or PAY MONEY.
---
Also I said job and other IRL stuff.  You can be single and have no pets, kids, wife, family and just work and game -- good for you.
---
Bloodied has the best DPS by a wide margin, but requires a significant investment in your build. Junkie's is decent damage and can be slotted into any build.
---
Yeah, try to find some decent clothes in the atomic shop that aren't too bright. Now as for spawn points, if you are just going to hide, start away from structures and places with loot crates. Find a bush, hide. Don't move. If I'm going to go for time and or xp (which is based on time and placement) I usually won't even bother to loot any gear at all. I'll pick a spawn point that is about halfway between the center and edge of the map to increase my chances of not having to move very far to get into the first circle. 
---
Usually if you can stay hidden past two storms you will end up close to the cutoff for placement xp by the time the 3rd storm hits you.
---
I don’t see them for private teams either.
---
I'm going to do this next time. Snow man tower 😂
---
Before the lockdown and furlough. I was playing 1-2 hours work nights.
---
And 4 hours a day off. So currently double my gaming. After 35 years in my career field, and my kid now adult. I can enjoy my hobby.
---
I can see a double space in your recent defence~
---
I have a husband and we are trying for a baby. You assume a lot about people you don't know.
---
Ah forgot to mention our little pug. But yeah, accorsing to you its impossible to have a life and actually enjoy playing games in your spare time. :/
---
Bloodied is stronger, and can be tanky enough if you know how to perk defense.  You get a huge boost to special stats.  Junkies is slightly less powerful and if you want the special boosts you have to run low health and unyielding armor. If someone is gonna do that, why not just run bloodied to begin with?  Junkies has its place, but I have tried both extensively and for me, bloodied is the best.  Admittedly the learning curve is much steeper though.
---
Junkies IMO is only for players that don't want to manage their health and rads, and feel safer with full health instead.  It still does a lot of damage but you miss out on a lot of other perks.
---
You are calling people children for using a strategy you don't like? That is ironically childish behavior.
---
Bloodied is great if you want to completely overkill everything.
---
Junkies great enough dmg, even if it takes a second longer to kill high level epic monsters.
---
And with full health junkies you dont have to worry about dying to stupid things.
---
It told me this morning in NW that i had unlocked wreaths, and then presents, but I have no idea where they would be.
---
For me never set up camp in the forest, mire, ash heap, or toxic Valley. Either you don't get enough customers or people never actually buy stuff.
---
Liberators are an interesting example as they will spawn a bloatfly on death when shot with the syringer mod, suggesting they are coded differently from other robots in the game. May be a "bug".
---
Sorry, not the best picture, but here you go!
---

I already had it set up in my character's bedroom, but it's only a 1x1 tile room and photomode gets wonky trying to take a picture in there, haha. Also, the random squares of light are from a disco ball in the room, sorry about that. It looks freaking amazing in game, the stars are very glowy and show up really well even during the daytime.
---
That isn't a grammatical error; it's a typographical error.
---
Question: Why do you end every comment with a tilda?
---
Play for 2 hours a day and reach rank 11 in 2 days. I still have two weekly challenges. It's easier than you think.
---
Who says you need all 100 rewards? They level 70-100 rewards are meant for daily, multiple hours a day players. If you care about them so much quit your job and stop complaining.
---
Idk about you but I recently became a bloodied build and adopted to it pretty easily. Probably because I had easy access to that mutation and a solid set of power armor
---
Why dont I just punch my opponent in the nuts in a boxing match
---
No....it's pretty much the only fuckin thing to do. Maxed Rep with Raiders and Settlers a long while and have most of the bullion shit I want. Got bloodied gauss shotgun and minigun that pretty much one shots anything I point it at....What am I supposed to do other than this score shit? The same low effort events they've had since launch? Launch my 1000 nuke? Ya'll treat this shit like there's just a fountain of content...I've seen more content in Raid: Shadow Legends....
---
It's your lucky day! ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Yeah, the legendary run is similar to the old challenges that awarded atoms and the atom store,  its account wide, not character specific.
---
How does you hiding in a bush(which I have no problem with since I prefer sniping) stick it to Bethesda or other players, OP excluded? 
---
Matches last longer which benefits everyone and the extra-thirsty just hunt down the bushkin to rack up kills.
---
I like it a lot, but I can't seem to build there, not even on top. Any ideas?
---
Also players looking for score points that never play PvP may be logging in, and then hiding in a storage room, just to run up time to increase their overseer rank... Maybe 😀
---
My camp is between Flatwoods and the Wayward and I do alright. Most of my clientele are high levels
---
At least Bungo let's you grind at your own pace on their seasons...not a fun grind, but better than this shit....
---
junkies is poor mans bloodied for full health players
---
You're well learned! 
---
A. To express a less than serious attitude towards the subject, imagine I'm waving my arms like a tube man~
---
we'll see how long it actually lasts. people said the same thing about every event thats been added but eventually no cares about it after a time.
---
its good we finally have some fort of LFG for future content though.
---
Damn how the he'll did you crank out over 1million exp in 24 hours?
---
Meat piles eventually disappear and the loot is left laying on the ground instead.
---
Same. Like how far is Todd Howard's dick down their throat to think like that?
---
RnG is hilarious. I got a Bloodied first roll and a Junkies second roll and a 2 shot third roll. all looking for a vampire. 15 more rolls later and still elusive to me :(
---
hey sorry did not see you replied back to me, ill be on tomrrow afternoon if you are still interested.
---
What's the controversy?
---
I mean, I'll take it. It's just weird that I've not seen it, and I've played since the B.E.T.A.
---
We will see where you are at when this is over.
---
  
---
At this current rate, like I said: Not possible unless you no-life on days off, or pay.
---
ill expect your apology after this is over.
---
Even a standard shotgun does the same. I was using a standard combat shotgun before i got an instigating one and it did far more damage in VATS.
---
Public teams are awesome and the incentives make it totally worth joining up with likeminded people.
---
Makes sense. Thanks.
---
Thanks a lot!
---
Never will happen
---
Nuking tanagra and killing the scorch that spawn when you mine ultracite. It’s posted here daily.
---
Hmm. I've just never seen it before in all the time I've played.
---
agreed. uny provides so much agi that its just overkill at that point.
---
The unyeieding effect stacks?
---
It takes an extra 7000 XP to go from the Jack-o-lantern armor to the Glowing Skeleton Costume.
---
In all, you'll need 27001 XP during this unexpected availability of the rewards to earn all of the Halloween and Christmas stuff. Halloween rewards are done by 14000 XP, while the final Christmas item is at 27001 XP. That means there's some huge time gaps in between the rewards you earn.
---
Why the hell would that even bother you?  I mean, how does it affect you personally?  If that's what a person wants to do with their money, who the hell are you to say a damn thing about it?
---
People are so fucking weird sometimes.  I could see if they were, like, using YOUR money without your consent, but it's theirs to do with as they wish.  You really don't have any business making such comments about it.
---
And don't hand me that nonsense about "If people do that Bethesda will think they can make people pay for everything", or some such nonsense.  They're going to do that no matter what anyone playing FO76 does, so that ship has long since sailed.
---
Lmfaoooo
---
Gosh. I’d hate moving camp again. It’s on a cliff side. Perfect view. And I’m not sure if I’d be able to set it somewhere and it actually set. I’d probably have to scrap the whole thing and rebuild it again.
---
Because that is what they are there for.  It is why some people play.  To collect all the items, plans. etc....
---
Bethesda markets it as a 'free content update' but, by the time this is over, if you want the end rewards you will have to spend real money unless you are privileged enough to be able to no-life this game -- which sees to be why I am getting so much hate.
---
Im not sying that is why you play, but it is why myself and many others play.
---
And as for your idea to quit my job, you are just being rude and unhelpful.
---
I find rare crafting materials in nuke zones at Whitesprings.
---
I've been running bloodied since the beginning.  I use SS armor because I lose the unyielding stats when I enter power armor.  SS is doing fine for me unless I am in a nuke zone, where I usually use PA temporarily.  If you are a bloodied heavy, I can see why you'd run PA more due to the benefits of the stabilized perk.  I rarely ever die, only to poison usually, and even that is not often because I have two pieces of armor with poison resistance.  My mutations are Adrenal, Bird Bones, Egg Head, Eagle Eyes, Marsupial and Speed Demon.  Healing factor is bugged so I run Lifegiver instead.  It does the same thing if you are bloodied and you don't have to deal with the fast travel failing bug all the time.
---
Also, she is one of the traveling vendors that can show up at your camp...I am not sure if you need an ally for this to happen, but I know she's stopped by at least once for me.
---
I use all SS, no chameleon armor or mutation and just carry the CSS with me. It's easy enough to stay hidden.
---
Yeah laugh it up.
---
Like I said, we shall see.
---
You get +3 to all stats except endurance for each piece equipped.  So I am losing out on +3 for each by running one piece of chameleon. 
---
I think that is what you are asking.
---
Yes all Xbox. Me and all my group just quit for the night. Way too annoying
---
Like you said, while the content may become stale the LFG feature probably gave it a nice overall boost. But I think it's a good thing overall.
---
This whole grinding/grind limit really hurts people who only have free time on their days off from work.
---
I hope Bethesda fixes this issue.  How?  I don't know but it is getting really old having all the no-lifers tell me just to "quit my job" if finishing the race is my goal.
---
I love getting a headshot for 1200+ damage and have it not even register on the mobs health meter.  It seems to be happening a lot more often over the past few weeks, most noticeably in vats.  Very noticeable on SB's, for some reason?  I can pop off a few rounds from sneak while manually aiming and drop a SB almost instantly.  While in vats?  I'm watching the damage numbers pop up, but still burn through three mags before it goes down.
---
So... What if you're sniping from the bush using the Scoped Lever Action, or the top of a cliff to keep the high ground? You wouldn't want to be 20 feet away standing directly in front of someone with a Handmade if you've got a Lever Action (unless you're a great hip-fire shot).
---
Every weapon and tactic has its uses. Obviously hiding and sniping won't be the best option once the circle closes in. But it can be amazing from the right vantage point.
---
Doing that on a private server also counts as being on a team for the herd mentality mutation, so that's a free +2 to all SPECIAL as well.
---
Wear hooded rags! Use the Cricket persona from FO4!!  😁
---
I'm tired of swapping gear though lol
---
With the grind to the end of the legendary run it will persist 100% through the end of the season. It's after the season I'm sure they will be dead as fuck from fatigue. Were all going to be worn out
---
Yea have a buddy who hit this where he can’t use grenades even after dropping them and picking them back up
---
Having Fallout 1st.... I have near 500 screws in my scrap box now ;)
---
i have a lvl 235 junkies build and a lvl 76 bloodied commando build. I like them botj. my bloodied build shreds pretty much anything.  I use a full set of unyielding armor with ap. tjat along with the defense perks keeps from dying most of the time. so long as I  don't get mobbed. I typically run about 12-15% health
---
See.. i like the way you think
---
Just sharing some thoughts while reading your comment, here to offer a different perspective, not bash on you or your play style etc. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed NW, not just for the mode and gunplay but the people who play it as well. (There’s a group of folks who’ve been playing this mode for a long time, and have since formed friendships/enemies along the way, it’s quite interesting to check into the vault and see how people are doing) 
---
I’m lvl 300 in nuclear winter and can tell you right now that levels do not matter one bit, there are certain players who you’ll see are really good and that’s that. All that level shit just plays in your head. 
---
It is possible to win a game with the standard perk loadout. There have been many of us who played through a match without our usual perks and won, due to a bug where visiting ADV resets your perks. 
---
The loot isn’t to blame, I’ve seen players pull amazing things with revolvers, 10m subs and double barrels etc against top tier weapons like launchers, handmades and explosives.
---
The players who have a real chance in succeeding are the ones who put in the time to learn and adapt to what works best, along with a little repetition and map mindfulness. 
---
Just my two cents.
---
Wait..there are teams? How don you know who is on your team?
---
I'd add that the chameleon armor sneak effect does stack regardless of what anyone might tell you.  More pieces = better sneak.  But, one piece is absolutely enough if you run high stats with unyielding for the other pieces. I can circle an enemy at arms length and not be detected with just the one piece.
---
That wallpaper looks awesome
---
It's +3 x however many pieces you wear? So it'd be say +6 if you're wearing two pieces? And how does the chameleon mutation work with a chameleon armor piece? Does one cancel the other out?
---
There’s a bug going around in which the unlocks are once again in motion, I had a buddy last night suddenly unlock the glow in the dar Halloween skull mask (: so that was pretty neat. 
---
Bethesda, just let it be unlockable for everybody, play it off as intentional...come on. Lol
---
So your argument is that hiding, an allowed and quite frankly effective strategy, is as bad as deliberately breaking the rules?  False equivalency aside, stealth and hiding is an element in virtually all battle royal games. If other players play style bothers you so much, maybe you should consider another game.
---
It had a lot of potential, but just no worthwhile content. The combat was quite fun and the flying felt good, but there was nothing to do, nothing worth earning and had balancing issues.
---
Such a shame.
---
Bush wookies do not shoot. We are a peaceful people.
---
As for strategys just stick to the bushes. Learn the maps. I'm level 94 now and have like 3 kills total. Im constantly in the top 10, mainly down to the top 2 teams. Just hid well, wear dark clothing, using the laying out photo pose of you have it, camera mode is great for checking your surroundings
---
As somebody who plays on PS4, there are plenty of players who spawn in the same spot every match they’re in. They’re not bots or anything. I myself tend to choose the same damn spot...lol it helps to keep landing in the same place constantly so you know it like the back of your hand.
---
I respect your opinion, but you can't tell me that players frog jumping because of perk cards that I don't have don't have any advantage.  (That is just one small example) Levels do matter relative to perks available.
---
They made a bunch of newer guns and one of them was like literally broken good and then they nerfed when people were actually having fun with it lol
---
Hiding and playing the game are two different things. A bushwookie has no intention of doing anything but stay hidden and ruin other experience for other players(weather intentional or not). Hiding and stealthing a completely different
---
I haven't had it with Daguerre.  
---
I did have the exact same problem with Chloe and Daily: Play Time. I never turned in my quest, and then went to turn it in some time later (could have been a day, could have been a week, I don't remember how long it was) and she wouldn't accept me turning in whatever it was. Whatever I originally had done (probably picked flowers) was lost and the game didn't "remember" what it was, so I couldn't turn it in. Until I had the option to Reject the Quest in the Pip-Boy, I couldn't do her Dailies anymore. She'd just say, "Not now, Leslie!" or "I'm not seeing you!" Once I rejected the quest, I waited a couple of days, and her quest has worked fine ever since. I now make sure to turn in all unfinished Dailies before I leave the game.  
---
I'd suggest going into the Pip Boy and rejecting the quest, waiting a couple of days for a reset, and then trying again.  
---
**HOWEVER...** There does seem to be a bug with certain Allies. Right now, I have Gramps (Settler Forager) and he literally just tells me, "Not now, kid." every time. I can't even get his quest, and I love his because most of the time, he gives me a Legendary fetch quest.
---
i don't like the idea conceptually, but i upvoted you anyway just for the effort
---
Thanks for that, I guess I’ll just keep at it
---
I sold a berserkers war drum for 3k earlier today and this comment has me worried. Are legendary war drums a big deal?
---
It’s certainly better than the entire server just hanging out of people’s camps
---
Tbh I only swap when I go into high rad areas, which you will have to either through using power armor or the CSS anyway.
---
And in shotguns its only adds 1 extra pellet. I'm not sure how the damage is split on shotguns with two shot. But it's not great
---
Run a fluid hybrid tank/unarmed bloody build. Best of both worlds. High strength, agility and endurance. My damage is supplement by mutations. My gear/ backpack helps my health. Full 3 star unyielding, under armor.
---
Can charge power attack, or stealth kill. For SBQ, can easily switch over to heavy weapon, also bloody.
---
Some ideas based on perks from Fallout 4. 
---
Blitz (May not work in pvp if it is too OP). 
---
Rank 1: +100% sprint speed toward an enemy target in VATS while using a melee weapon. Consume 20% more AP during this sprint.   
---
Rank 2: melee attack in VATS after this sprint deals more damage based on sprinting distance during Blitz, up to x%.   
---
Nuclear Physicist  
---
Rank 1: while a fusion core is below 20%, gain increased AP regeneration and deal increased energy and radiation damage while wearing a power armor. 
---
Rank 2: while a fusion core is below 20%, taking radiation damage slows down the fusion core consumption by 80%. Deal increased ballistic damage while this perk is active as well.   
---
Critical Banker  
---
Rank 1: allow player to store two additional critical hits. 
---
Rank 2: allow player to store three additional critical hits. Each consecutive critical hits deal additional 20% damage.
---
If you cared about the rewards as much as you claim, you would find the time to earn them. Simple as that.
---
Your feelings are no more valid than theirs. They aren't exploiting anything and they are playing the game their way.
---
This. That's why there are so many people play nw atm
---
Tell that to World of Warcraft, Everquest, UO, Runescape, Minecraft, Team Fortress 2, Counter Strike, and various other games that still going strong.
---
So judging by your position, you would be overjoyed to go to every event and have the legendary get one shotted everytime
---
one simple suggestion is build a foundation add a wall then a slanted roof, then you can extend that roof with another slanted and drop down a half wall etc without needing a foundation.. you can use this to build up and clip into things
---
the foundations will snap to the walls coming down from the roof .. you'll have to mess around and try to find a way to connect stairs or something to ground it though .. otherwise once done you won't be able to delete the roof of the properly placed foundation
---
Now you need a yao guai and call it Chewbacca
---
No!
---
They were meant as PVP hot spots / flash points / funnels but with everyone super nice to one another in PVE they serve no real purpose.
---
Same my damage on most of my weapons seems nerfed even without adrenaline.
---
Exactly I gave a random low lever my level 25 Junkies lever action, I loved the gun but he needed more than be, he better still be giving her lots of super mutant headshot kills she loves those.
---
Same as you.... I donno how im gonna level up every single day for points.
---
I want leggo perks to add completely different and new gameplay elements. 
---
- Autoloot
---
- Enhance Vats
---
- Consumerables do not expire at all
---
- Bullets Penetrate 
---
Stuff like that
---
That's actually a part of why i stopped playing Destiny 2 a few months ago.
---
Honestly, frog legs users never really gave me a problem as they’ve all died the same, so I do not share the same sentiment towards the perk card. I also have pals who use that card and still die quite often. (I really wish there were stats) with that said I wouldnt mind if they changed frog legs and made it the marsupial mutation only obtainable by rads etc.
---
And yes I suppose you’re correct, levels do matter in terms of relative perks available, though I don’t believe your odds depend on whatever perks you have alone. I suppose in my mind, literally dealing with the cards I’m dealt with, and working up to those perk cards I wanted is what taught me most of what I know in game. I learned different routes because I didn’t have frog legs, etc. I went through all the basic ass cards, worked my way up and molded a set that worked for me by amplifying my strengths. If I were given those cards fresh off the bat I don’t believe my play style would have evolved the way it did. 
---
I totally understand where you’re coming from, though. I know it ain’t for everybody, and it’s easy to just brush it off and not even wanna invest time into it. Like I said, if it wasn’t for the folks playing it I don’t think I would’ve stuck it out as long as I have.
---
If you collect ore you get double the amount
---
I hate it because it breaks immersion and feels stupid to bounce around as if it was Quake 2, but it is probably the most useful mutation in the game. So, yes, unless you like 'normal' looking jumping.
---
Yea they need to bring back survival for people who like to loot and pvp and leave new players and pve’ers alone
---
Agree. Beckett gives a good level 45 3* Anti Armor faster fire gun.
---
You get 4 times the yield when mining ore deposits and veins. That's pretty significant.
---
Oh...right as I'm getting rid of junk
---
And last night, I got the message “you cannot travel to a location you do not know“ Give or take like I hadn’t discovered it. I’m sorry but I discovered Billings Homestead in the first day I was playing
---
I mean tbf they gun basically made anyone capable of downing in the endgame boss in seconds which was actually a bad thing because it ended the event and you lose all on doing all the extra things for a higher score so people would actually threaten to kill the boss if people didn’t play like they want lol
---
Agree. Beckett gives a good level 45 3* Anti Armor faster fire gun. 
---
You can buy the plan from the watoga vender in the mall and the northern most train station
---
Welp I need lead to feed the .50 cal to feed lead death to my enemies
---
I've seen the queen killed a bit too quickly in this game too. I think some builds in this game are a bit OP
---
Anyone?  
---
Is there anyone out there?  
---
Is there anyone else in this entire sub?  
---
Are there any other posts here?  
---
Is there a search function?  
---
Does not being able to use the search function make someone an idiot?  
---
Or is it just another case of people pretending to care about what is/isn't affecting other people?  
---
So many unanswered questions.  
---
Does this hppen to anyone else? 🤔
---
You're awesome!
---
I've had a couple players recently just drop stuff for me on my 'selling floor,' presumably thinking much the same as you? My prices are on the low side, originally I was north of the Landview Lighthouse and not too far from Vault 76, wanted to help out some newer folks. Have been building Everywhere since and am overlooking Whitesprings now (with a seating area above to watch it get nuked), but kept the prices low. Some of it has turned into inventory management again, I'm nearly maxed even with the scrap box, so the eighteen million stimpacks/radx/radaway I seem to find get tossed into my ammo/aid/plans vendor for a couple caps.
---
Still found room for a fourth 'joke' vending machine though. It was "I can't believe it's not butter" for a bit with recipes in it, but I changed it to "See with your special eyes 0-0" with "My brand!" on the front. Just...selling glasses. I dunno. It's fun. Have fun!
---
with calibrated shocks mod on both legs, you get another 100#, for a total of  200#.
---
Higher DR/RR than most lower level nonPA armor
---
4x yield when looting ore veins.
---
I’m L207, excavator is still my goto when I need PA
---
Downside is the extra carry weight can easily overencumbered you when you exit the PA
---
I had the same problem. Switched to Beckett and did a few quests for him, then switched back to Daguerre, it then progressed fine.
---
I have complete 3 weekly tasks. That were supposed to award 1000 SCORE.  but for some reason the SCORE was not added. I thought maybe I missed when it added. But just completed another one and was not awarded any SCORE. bethesda needs to fix these issues or I will no longer play or purchase any bethesda games
---
Bloodied is not the 'broken' element. Unyielding paired with bloodied is. It feels like God mode: you become the Suzuki Escudo from the first Gran Turismo.
---
Bloodied is king in this game.
---
[It's only the dailies that are getting doubled.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hjynjl/summer_roadmap_looks_pretty_interesting/fwphct6/)
---
A few people mentioned the same thing. However, since Bethesda said they're going to re-do the converter, I am not going to touch it until then.
---
It's worse than ever for my PA Shotgun if I'm not in VATS. And with switching over to teams I've dropped my Lone Wanderer perk and am missing the AP regen from it. It's brutal.
---
Where can I find the mods 
---
I rarely use power armor
---
Democracy established
---
What you say is true. I bet the person who downvoted you doesn’t even play NW lol
---
I wonder how they'll fuck that up when they patch it.
---
Same here.  Some people have said they got the reward at 3 of 5 tasks - the last couple I competed I also monitored, that did not happen.  No score at 3, none at 5.
---
Kinda annoyed, to day the least
---
I used to have my camp there, and it can be a tricky place. I never used the rug glitch for the roof, but besides that I only know that it’s extremely temperamental.
---
And by bunker, I’m assuming you mean the two train cars? Or do you mean the actual bunker with the house that’s south of the church?
---
Absolutely incorrect. For one, the magic guns were a bug, and exploiting a bug is usually considered rule breaking behavior in online games. As for the builds that melt legionaries, it is on the developers to fix their content, not the players. Don't blame players for playing the game the way a developer designed it, blame the developers for releasing a broken and unbalanced game.
---
My friends were making fun of me for being lvl 19, lol. Grind on!
---
I think the responder bots have them.
---
No worries! It's definitely a massive grind, considering we have no ETA on when the rewards will be gone again, so it feels like a ton of playing in a really short amount of time. Good luck getting everything you're after!
---
I use ultrasite pa, with excavator arms just for this.
---
If you are asking me to choose between my family and game, you are God damn right I'll pick family.
---
But the point is, casual play won't allow you to reach the end on time.  Not sure why you are all fighting me on this.
---
That is really dope and one of the more creative C.A.M.P.s I’ve seen lol
---
The bubblegum bear is fixing a seem?
---
a panda being spanked by a bubblegum, kinda a way to take a closer look at a distant yarn
---
Rank 14, skipping all NW challenges and dedicating all other free time to XP grind for levels. Fully intend to skip levels when the 2 weeks is up though, have about 2k atoms saved for that purpose.
---
Democracy is non-negotiable.
---
Nukes at 50? Are they selling? I had 7 in my camp for 15 and ended up just dropping them. I can't seem to sell nukes for anything.
---
It's not always snallys, sometimes it's super mutants. But it is my go to spot for cryptid killiling
---
I started playing on PC back 6 months ago as well, but stopped playing due to lack of friends to play with. I do have a a good build however.
---
Your math is slightly off on the food - Cranberry Relish can be used for 10% along w/ Herbivore and Stranger in numbers for +25% from food alone. (It should be 22.5% but they bugged the math.)
---
THANK YOU!
---
Oh for sure, it's definitely pushing the boundaries for what is reasonable in this kind of system.
---
Also, if you get Morgan town, I almost always spawn near a power line tower.  Most people don't look up, so hiding in the shadows on the cliff face works great.
---
Use Building when doing an event for the int boost, then right before the event finishes, switch to Event for the XP gain
---
I've ran into random items on the ground as well, just no legendaries though.
---
Wait how did you do it if the daily and weekly are cap?! Is there something else  besides  the 10k / 100 score point reward?
---
So that is the new Ghillie armor!
---
I would say giving it a tattoo
---
I've gotten credit for them, but I've gotten credit at 3/5 finished, then nothing when I do complete the challenges. (TBH, I was hoping that it would glitch out and give me double SCORE, but that did not happen.)
---
Far as I can tell you can't buy it anywhere leaving the only option of crafting and scrapping and hoping you get it
---
Well, best guess is to check the whitesprings indoor vendors and do cranberry bog quests, events and treasure maps
---
This. Craft/scrap
---
Bullshit. That’s false advertising.
---
Tyr, sh games and captain noob for weapons and non foodbuilds, angryturtle for in depth guides.

Inov used to good but complains way to much lately imo.

Do Bush Wookiees ever encounter other Bush Wookiees? What happens then.

what do you need, next time were both on ill help you put, what build are you?

Holy crap. They’ve got to be joking. That’s ridiculous!

Bubblegum is sewing the pandas leg back on￼

do u want a gun?

also missing 2k for the week. Bethesda has acknowledged it, doubt we'll see a fix or compensation though. It was supposed to have been fixed with this patch along with a bunch of other things that didn't get fixed.
---
We don't acknowledge each other. We just hide
---
You get a full set of ultracite armor if you complete the BOS quest 
---
X-01 you have to make after you get to General in the Enclave as you get the plans
---
T65 you have to buy the plans with bullion from the gold vault
---
Thanks peeps! Got it by scrapping.
---
What's an aluminum falcon?
---
At least with score there’s the repeatable gain xp thing, although the payout should be like 500 instead of only 100
---
For me it’s .45, 5.56 and full fusion cores (1, 1, 75).
---
Wreath is under wall decorations and presents are under floor decorations.
---
Take a couple Rong Bips
---
I’d like a gun and I need rounds for a hunting rifle and 10mm rounds
---
Because there's a lot of people that don't want to play the trash, cheater-infested game mode. Yet they pretty much have to or else they'll have an extraordinarily hard time meeting the point quota for the legendary run.
---
Trust me, if there weren't PvE rewards locked behind your precious PvP gamemode, people wouldn't be doing this. Yet Beth keeps trying to incentivize people to play it by locking PvE rewards to it. Y'know why? It's because the player count for it is trash otherwise. Wonder why that would be?
---
And here's the real kicker. They don't care how much you hate their tactic because they're not interested in whatever your "correct" way to play is. They're just interested in what gives the most XP with the least amount of effort.
---
atomic shop&gt;fallout 1st&gt;scroll down and you should have raider and settler tent
---
I would wait until right the season is about to close before buying ranks. Save yourself some atoms since it'll take 15k atoms to max it from nothing. Even if you only get to r30 that would save you some atoms
---
Anyone having problems being able to team up with your friends?... Might just be my xbox but just wanted to see if anyone else is having the same issue?
---
Exactly. It blows
---
This 👆
---
hmm, i don’t see anything. could it be i just need to let it take its time?
---
Hahaha. Like that friend that never leaves even tho you drop blatant hints.
---
ill give you my AAE hunting rifle and about 8k ammo for it, are you familiar with markey76 btw
---
Yeah I do mean the train cars, my bad. Do you remember how you got it to work?
---
No, it was a monthly unlock for fallout 1st that isn't available at the moment.
---
this what im running except throw in some berry mentats. man i thought i was ahead of the curve at 15, time to get grinding for real
---
Oh okay, thank you then.
---
I mean I ran out of ammo earlier and had grenade ammo. I tried it out and it didn’t take me long to get at least some ammunition. I think it worked out just fine in my situation.
---
PSA: if you wanna grief AFK in the vendor menu

https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_1st/Rewards
---
This has a list of the items from the past.
---
About as unpopular as the opinions in r/unpopular opinion.
---
In any case, I like the idea behind earned themed items and all that, but it does feel terrible to earn less atoms as a result.
---
I had the same issue tonight. I found no fix.
---
I’ve been playing it to break up the boredom of adventure mode. I’m terrible at NW, but it’s a lot of fun.
---
Very much this
---
Yeah its their bond with you. You dont bonf with yourself.
---
I'm only getting credit for the daily challenges.
---
Yeah, when I got the jet pack at first I decided "That's it, I can get rid of my mutations, free up some Luck slots" played a day with just the jetpack and immediately missed all the extras.
---
Pipe is life...
---
Hey now we might get a 50 atom icon as compensation.
---
Asking in here helps. Saying what console or computer you use helps too.
---
I feel you, but I just think it works fine as a survival machine. No, it won’t crank out the best amount per click or whatever, the interface could use work. But I was surprised that it worked so easy. I just needed some .556 and gave it a shot and had enough to keep playing with the gun. It gave me some ammunition I needed when I didn’t have the materials to do so otherwise.
---
Buy one off r/market76
---
Happens to me a lot. Enemies not even leaving meat piles and going straight items on ground.
---
that 100 repeatable is really easy if you have high int

"No. Also, what problem?"

\- Love, Bethesda

I do have high int , how tho which perk card

Xbox One .. Im very new to online gaming and completely lost. I guess that's what I get for waiting until my 30s to play online.

Offtop: I miss psycho scream like in fo4, like in old video player takes psycho while crouching near to enemy, screams and gets Fatman in the face lol after being instantly noticed screaming
---
Thank you for putting plans at reasonable price, been running round trying to find guns and armor plans but most people seem to sell them for 300/500 caps each it's insane.
---
I don't even really sell stuff and have vending machines full of free items and nobody comes lol. It's nice because I get horizon's rest to myself tho.
---
I took it from a level 1430 player on my first day of playing as a level 2. Bloodied build so he obliterated my ass until he got bored of wasting his explosive bullets on me lol

I'll just copy paste my other reply:

Simplest strategy is make it yourself. Sinple Yet time consuming.
---
Most of the time it’ll give me those icons and tell me I either can’t fast travel to it (even though I fucking own it) or it makes me pay. When it’s not a location icon and the real workshop icon I take it because I know it’ll be free.
---
Yeah I only have like half the caps necessary

this is happening to my tesla rifle after about 30 mins of gameplay.

Buttressed is all you need
---
Farming EXP is easy but 100 Score Points for every 10k hahaha yeah no, I love to grind all day but even I have my limits.
---
It's just my main toon I had no problem with my alt.🤷‍♂️
---
I know this is going to end up buried and never seen, but I'm throwing it out there anyway:
---
The Weekly Challenge "Destroy Robots" seems to be bugged. I destroyed the 5th robot, and it showed "5/5" on the tracker, but the 1000 points were never awarded. Interestingly, the Challenge is greyed out (completed) but the Tracking icon (the square to the left) is still active. My final kill was a Vertibot while collecting a nuclear keycard, so maybe it didn't register as an enemy? Doesn't explain the "5/5" or the completed challenge, though.
---
However, this may ultimately be a misunderstanding of the Weekly rewards: does it hand out the 1000 points immediately, or at the end of the week? I couldn't find anything in the Seasons announcement that clarified it, but upon writing this I realized that I don't think I've gotten rewarded for any completed weekly (except the 10,000XP recurring reward).
---
With the legendary grind and vending I seem to he at max caps far too often, so buying a serum plan isnt out of the question. Farming water is a really easy way to get all 1400 caps per day from vendors if you arent already.
---
😂😂
---
I recently made a melee character so I respec’d my main with higher perception,agility, and luck so Nuclear Winter finally feels fun to play
---
part of the reason is how Bethesda makes everything server side detection, even the smallest thing such as movement.
---
but i don't even know how their net code screws this up. i can accept a lag, i.e. the damage takes a while to register. but how do you screw it up that it registers only PART of the damage?
---
That's interesting bc my camp has only ever let me build up 4 stories.
---
How did stealth armor go?
---
I haven't even considered but it sounds like fun. Did you get pulled out of stealth very often?
---
Also, congratulations!
---
Bethesda: sure, we'll bump it up the list from #543674 to #3345
---
I'm in Beijing.  What's your psn?
---
At the moment a lot of mods are missing, but it was noted that they were looking into adding them back.
---
Is that the market subreddit?
---
they don't want you to grind. they want you to login daily. there's a difference
---
Do you even do the NW dailies?  I'm guessing no because your routine sounds like you probably get equal to or more from the 10K/100 in the same amount of time.
---
Which ones aren’t available? I really didn’t look much into it other than the buttressed.
---
You all understand that it's free with game pass now.. I have said it from launch, it's destined to be a game pass game. Like every mmo it will become more tedious as time goes by, keep in mind that the game is basically free now... MoAr mIcRo TraNsActiONs!
---
Huh!  I sort of hung the build area off the cliff to get more height it seems!
---
I hope this shuts everyone up lol. Not everyone is suppose to be guaranteed to hit 100 ffs
---
Buttressed for first slot. Second slot of arms is either melee or scoped focused so meh. 2nd slot on legs have a fee options. Sleek for sneaking. Custom for for ap usage. For the chest, there are alot of options. Ultralite for weight and ap. Or lead lined. Or asbestos. 
---
You can view them all here.

[secret service info](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Secret_Service_armor)
---
The gather supplies one or the kill robots?  I didn't see either of those pop up at anytime.  But, according to my math, i got both.
---
The trick there is to just start a new character every day and just run to The Wayward to get a level up from that quest (plus maybe a few small errands). It's dumb, but it's a good last ditch measure.
---
May end up trying it if I move again
---
Thanks for the tip. I'm not super high level yet but I'll remember that!
---
Maybe eventually we can reclaim Morgantown for the Responders and Harpers Ferry for the Free States.. Hopefully.
---
If you set your camp in a tree you can build above and below, there’s a YouTube vid out there showing 9 floors
---
To hit the XP mark multiple times, you'll pretty much have to stop building and start grinding. It's not so bad though: take an hour and do nothing but hit every event you see. If the Queen pops up, be sure to go (grenades are great for tagging enemies). You'd be surprised how quickly you can hit the 10k mark.
---
That's not possible, I have it on good faith from many posters whining in many other threads about how it takes them 6 hours just to get a daily done and it will be completely impossible for them to get above rank 50 in 10 weeks.
---
I bought all of mine at the Responder Bot at Camden Park.
---
Hey dude. I think I have a Fixer plan to spare for free. Let me know if you still need and we can hook it up. IGN WooWooKennyWoo
---
Chest is good.  Arms and legs are limited and both missing deep pocketed.
---
Legs have cushioned, sleek, and custom fitted, and since cushioned does very little and sleek doesn’t stack with speed demon, custom is the best one of the set.  Didn’t see much in arms worth worrying about at the moment personally.
---
Cool, so nine is probably the limit then?
---
Thank you, added.
---
Thank you. Added.
---
Dido!!!
---
I just did it at level 70, solo with more deaths than I can remember and all but 1 gun broken by the end, even had to stop and make ammo at a tinkers bench I found half way through. I went in blind and it was a lot more difficult than I expected it to be so I was not at all prepared. If it weren't for the ability to remove turret targeting controls I wouldn't have been able to do it. Was a great time though, Sadly no one turned up to the nuke zone so I didn't get much out of it, outside of some flux and a good time.
---
Bethesda's performance index is based on daily login, NOT hours played. they rather have someone play 10 minutes each day over 1 year, than a player who logs 10 hours of gameplay a day but quits after 2 weeks

I'm sorry in advance for the wall of text and constant run-on sentences.

     For "endgame items", most are laughably mediocre. With the exception of the ss jet pack, backpack mods, the odd godrolled weapon, or full set of ss god tier armor made by an exploiter. I dont even bother turning in notes anymore because the items are too meh for the effort. Even the ammo machine makes little impact. Crafting ammo in the 10,000s? Well, have I got a deal for you! What would you say to an extra 200 rounds every now and again? You made it to end game, ground out that rep, and put some work in! So here you go! Half an engagement worth of rounds every now and again! Go on champ, you earned it! Hope your guns arent primed....at end game. When you are supposed to get this. An end game item. 
---
 Nice T-65, pity there is a legendary perk that gives up to 60% damage mitigation that is planned come out soon (Been waiting on the perks for well over a year now). And even if they dont come out, power armor is still sub par to regular armor. Blah blah blah best in class resistance, no utility (unyeilding), no back pack, no ap, and no infinite jet pack. And even then my regular armor still has a chance to have a high resistance/mitigation with vanguard/bolstering/assassins/sent/cav. 
---
Cool water well bro, wish I had that gold to waste.
---
Did you really buy all the ss armor reinforcment mods?! YOU KNOW YOU ONLY NEEDED BOLSTERING RIGHT?
---
Man flaunt that wealth! Cudos for not only buying deep pocketed, but also pocketed.
---
Cool mask mate, love how the purely cosmetic items are the most expensive!
---
Nice plasma caster! For your......sneak crit....heavy weapon build?! For when you want to do with a heavy weapon, what you could better do with a rifle....
---
Bruh, is that a Gauss pistol! MY MAN! Because pistol builds arent totally the most weak builds you can do (not disputing that there are some decent pistol characters out there)! Way to waste your time and agility points on a single fire, charge up gun, with no anti armor perks, and one of the worst ammo types to make.
---
Cool thorn/solar armor! You could have just gotten weightless or stimpak difs for a lot less effort. Also, you scout armor is kind of mediocre in comparison to combat armor right? For the price of one piece you could have bought almost 3 regular 3* pieces right?I do admire your dedication to make one piece every other day though! Good thing rng isnt predatory so you dont make the same exterminator lock pick/under water breathing piece every time....oh wait. Man, what a sad end to the failed story of vault raids. 
---
Pick a grenade, and laugh at yourself for using a grenade.
---
Is that a cattle prod? Shocking! 
---
Man, nice gauntlet you got! My handmade/50 cal/ fixer/gat plas/ any gun with magic damage from broken perks do just as much if not more from range!

Farmable dirt tiles are actually kind of good though if you pair it with the magic grenade. But unless you are adhesive farming, I wouldn't say these are game changing end game content.
---
Very very little of what I have been doing for the last year has been changed by this "endgame content." And none of it is worth grinding for over a week on. So play the game, grind for half a month, and then forget about the rest of that garbage because your time is better spent.
---
Looks like we’re getting double daily’s on the weekends. That should be more than enough.
---
I believe that’s what was started, my camp is on a cliff going 3 floors below where my camp was placed so that’s at least 7 floors for me
---
Well, it's nice to see colorectal healthcare is still a thing in post-war times. Schedule your colonoscopy today.
---
The real problem is you get more xp from sitting on a bush than her getting kills.
---
From what I’m seeing, this seems to be the general opinion, so it’s not much unpopular.
---
Anyways, yeah I feel that too. I love the game, but damn is it gonna feel grindier. I get that they need numbers or whatever, but it would be so much healthier if they took off limits on earnables and slapped SCORE *onto* the daily challenges with atoms rather than try to tinker with it.
---
Seasons felt like it could be great. You play and you get to earn cool stuff as you play. But without catch ups or the ability to earn SCORE more passively than through challenges, you just get more people leaving rather than staying to grind it out. You get the grinders going all out getting through it while the casuals can sit back and enjoy the game at their own pace. 
---
All I know is how bad they handle grinds in an ever changing game. Although it doesn’t affect my choice in their next *single player* game (same for any game really: wait a few weeks and then check reviews), it certainly changes for multiplayer ones. 
---
Still, I’ll just go in with the mindset I always have: I’m not gonna get everything, so just go for as long as you can.
---
Coming to you, had to cook some meat and do some other shit.
---
This video was not given to me when this last came up and I asked if he actually had changed, so I found it myself, and will post it. Have both sides anyway, whether or not you find either side genuine is up to you and I'll leave my thoughts out of it.

Welcome to Destiny 2, where seasons have killed the joy.
---
(I'd rather Bethesda just release Wastelander-sized DLC every year or so, but I think I'm deciding I'm just not a grinding MMO player....)
---
So I decided it’s worth my time and investment because I’m enjoying myself. We can agree to disagree. Personally I’d rather not see the game the way you apparently do and I’m sure the reverse is also true. Hopefully you can find some thing that’s fun and worth your time too.
---
Thank you for this breakdown!
---
Yeah, used 5 or 6 plasma cores on SBQ.  350 shots each, I hit for 58 on head.  Even averaging 20 damage a shot with misses etc. I still overkilled her just by myself.  There was more than a dozen other people there too and they were all stealth suit or heavy weapon.  I'm sure she soaked several hundred thousand damage.
---
Omg yes please
---
Well...I wouldn’t say that right now with what’s going on...but I feel ya.
---
True
---
There already is a damage cap of 110 in pvp. You cannot one shot a player unless they are bloodied themselves.
---
Yeah really there are a ton of places where your camp can be without SB sponds
---
I'm assuming your talking about the one you get in seasons?  I got no answer for you.
---
FYI
---
However, the one that you unlock from the raider faction is hilarious.  You can lock the terminal. But, anyone can still collect whatever ammo you are making.
---
Bloodied: pve
---
Junkies: pvp
---
Oh god, the lag on stuff.  You shoot something and then you wait... and wait... and wait... and just as you've waited seemingly forever and go to put another bullet into it... SPLOOT!  Bloody mess.
---
I’m 104. I need to do my first one too. The quest just sits there and taunts me.
---
You can always try your luck with the new public teams but I’d always be down to team up sometime! What’s your GT?
---
Lower the resolution to 640x400 or lower if you can.
---
Today was the first day I acknowledged fallout 76 as a better game than destiny two. I have hundreds of hours in both. But the game is just so unfun atm, even 76 is more satisfying
---
Played against a guy in NW today, he was called NukaWorld and was like rank 300+ and it was very obvious he was using ESP and Aimbot, I watched his screen for about 10 minutes to confirm it. I used aimbot on other games like Ark, DayZ and Rust years ago lol not anymore but I can spot it easily.
---
It absolutely can, QA would be saying the exact same thing we are now.
---
Only nicer and more constructive because they weren't hyped up over it.
---
Search on youtube, there is a video about this, it's basically buttonsmashing😣 and the convertratio is bad. It's not designed to get masses of other ammos. Basically you convert ammo in ammopoints and than you have to buy at this station your desired ammo. A pain cause you can't do mass converts. You only buttonsmash.
---
I haven't gotten snowmen yet.  Do I need to AFK harder or is this something that requires atoms?
---
Thank you
---
its not that hard.
---
use herbivore and cranberry relish and brainfungus soup, sleep and get a leader bobblehead. join a public building team. 
---
kills sentry bots at whitespring and then do ghouls, wes tek, borrows, steakhouse, huntersville, capital, fort defiance ect
---
hit guided meditation, line in the sand, radiation rumble, distant thunder, horde events, and sbq ect.
---
repeat.
---
the Mirelurk Queen one is easy to explain. she ate a Marine. i call that working as intended, lol
---
Ripper, thank you!
---
Make sure you get the under armor and shielded mod. Only 450 together. Adds 4 str 2 perc and 4 end.
---
You can use other peoples ACM. So I don't think it matters if latter player don't get it.
---
Thank you so much! You're a life saver!
---
I like how intentionally vague it is, rather than something straightforward like. "we're going fix it by just using the vendor menu system, which is the more logical implementation"
---
I'm pretty sure we're going to end up with another dumpster fire, that THEY think is a fix
---
I dont believe your named items show up for other players. It would just show the default name.
---
I've noticed that if you have stacks of items, it will show the "freshness" of whichever items will spoil next. So, if you have one that is halfway there, and you make 30 more, "fresh", it will show the one that is nearest to spoiling.
---
I dont know. It works for me. I have a motivation to log in and do stuff. Since I already have almost everything I want from gold bullions, farming score is my new addiction.
---
It is still better then farming reputation in WoW, lol.
---
I’m a bit confused. So say for the 5 camp things I only need to do 2-3 of them to get the credit?
---
You’re very welcome
---
In this universe I’m kind of concerned.  It’s changed so drastically since 1997 it makes me wonder if they’re going to use the original theme for it or the weird 1950s theme Bethesda has been going for...
---
My understanding is that Zorbo indicates the number of days left in the season. So if you're behind him at the end, you won't get the final rewards. But if you manage to get, and keep, in front of him you'll make it to rank 100 before the season ends.
---
Is this a separate one from the one you could get before Wastelanders?
---
It has been MIA for me since a recent patch. I can't even seem to get him on Private Server. Weirddd
---
I've been doing so many more events and I have a ton of Treasury Notes that are waiting to be redeemed lol
---
I nuke whitespeings in a private server for my high rad farm. The best places in queen zone are the forest and forward station delta. But people kill them quick. Respawn every 15-20 min. 
---
Whitesprings is tons of ghouls if you know where to look.
---
I didn't notice as I've barely used it, does it do fusion cores?
---
I’d be happy to play with her on a low level and teach her the ropes
---
This is so rad.
---
Don’t you lose the bond when you chance team type?
---
I'm waiting for a 2x Xp event so I can get 2k xp each round for adventure
---
Great tip. Thanks
---
Its secret service underar. Mods just came out for it this week due to a previous glitch.  Secret service has only been a thing post wastelanders I thought.
---
Nope.
---
Haven't noticed that, I'll check next time I log in!
---
My first launch got me a "disconnected from server" as soon I fast travelled out of the silo. 😐
---
Would be fun to do if the game worked around that kind of play.  Can’t have too many legendaries to meet everyone needs because of weight limits and not everyone wants to roleplay either.  Interesting idea but it doesn’t seem like it would work out.
---
This is why i've bough a couple backups to keep in my stash.
---
Damn it! I was hoping it wouldn't come to that. I was hoping on selling that plan but I got a quad ffr that neeeeeeddsss this mod. 
---
I imagine it's going to be the same story with ultracite laser mods.
---
If they aren't interested I would be positively ecstatic to get the fixer plan as I am running a stealth Commando build and it would be immensely helpful
---
This is a bug right now, normally you have to do all 5 things listed but you get the score after 2-3 are finished, so abuse the he'll out of it😂
---
I finish mine in under 10 min level 228 here if your on xbox I'll get you though it so fast and teach you how. And when all is said and done you'll be able to launch nucks left and right.
---
Just got to gift me 100,000,000 atoms
---
Lol just kidding wanted my comment to be longer so it would be intimidating... Are you intimidated?
---
under armor. Your perk loadout, go to the bottom bar. It will highlight a button to show unopened cards. Scroll to a card you dont have. It will tell you which button to then press to purchase with your tickets.
---
Shit you could bring explosive bait and and a cryolater to keep her grounded, and I'd be more than happy. You can play your build and still be useful, you'll make up for the downtime when you do get your melee in anyway
---
Didn't know that, a couple of people I play with are always saying how they are one shot, so maybe they're just lying. Thanks for letting me know!
---
I think Destiny 2 is better when it is telling an actual story with advancing plot and new material/world-building - it doesn't hold up well with just a perpetual grind.  For some reason, Fallout 76 does better with that.  But I admit I just recently finished the main quests, and endgame material isn't quite as old in FO76 for me as Destiny 2....
---
Definitely a good idea
---
I’d like to see a legendary perk that just makes all those perks passive based on the cards in your inventory.  But I doubt the studio would ever do anything like that.
---
It can't craft fuel either. Which is a darn shame, cause my flamer is starving for ammo.
---
I wish I would have thought about this before I server jumped 6 times to kill the graften monster by the capital building
---
Thank you!
---
I have this tinfoil hat theory the bad design was intentional to prevent players easily crafting currency for themselves since caps have a limit and with 2* Bandolier ammo kinda has not
---
Barbarian is bad. Use blocker instead. Evasive is *really* bad. If you don't use VATS, switch to Dodgy instead.
---
Also, both Bolstering and Vanguard are mediocre at best. It's not hard to get to \~300 DR/ER with armor alone (BOS heavy combat, polymer scout, buttressed Secret Service) and you don't need more. Instead go for a mix of armor pieces with the 15% mob-type specific reductions (Mutant Slayer, Troubleshooter, Zealot, etc.) and the 3\* 15% damage reduction effects while blocking, standing still or running - depending on what you do when you come under fire.
---
Some time ago I saw this near The Whitespring. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/7ApKNYA.jpg
---
It can. Its misslabled as 10mm I believe
---
It's a little bit of the opposite for me actually. Before Seasons, I loved Wastelanders but once that was over I just didn't feel like I had a reason to play.
---
Recently I got into the reputation and gold bullion grind but honestly, didn't care too much about the rewards. One, they're far off and two aside from maybe the Gauss Minigun and Plasma Caster, the rewards are ehh to me.
---
So I'd do the 3 quests (Raider Radiant, Settler Radiant, Davenport Radiant) for the past couple weeks, not everyday and then get off the game. Not even for the rewards but just for something to do.
---
Now with Seasons I am getting plenty of cool and useful rewards and there are often within reach. 1000 Caps? Great! Atoms? Heck yeah! Skins? Damn straight! Camp stuff? YES! YES! YES!
---
I am playing more now because of this and I feel like what I am doing is meaningful with cool rewards in sight. My Scrip is currently maxed out though, better spend some before I claim the Scrip Reward in the Legendary Run. Thing is I don't have much need for new legendary weapons and armor. I'm mainly a PA user and I have an amazing Grognak's Axe and a decent Lever Action, think it's explosive and two shot, not sure atm.
---
So I been enjoying it thus far, I'm content weapon and armor wise and getting cool new things for those weapons and armor and even more important, my camp.
---
Aww that's the worst news iv heard since cyber punk got delayed to september
---
It's like a Maltese Falcon, only lighter weight and cheaper to mass produce.
---
Clever!
---
Maybe I’m wrong, haven’t taken note yet either
---
They should really put an idle timeout on this.
---
And then people complain there is nothing to do in the game
---
I would gladly grind SEASONs for a Ghillie Protectron
---
The jumping around like an idiot in these battle royale games is ridiculous.
---
I wouldn't say it takes no skill though.
---
Tanagra town is the easiest way to get a pile of stabilization stuff. Nuke it, climb up to the cave, once you enter there’s a big hole down to your right with a few ultracite nodes. You can keep picking them and mobs of scorched will keep spawning.
---
It's happening to my handmade. Being commando if I just hold the trigger even at 95% I'll be missing or doing no damage. Stopping and firing again seems to fix it usually
---
Give em away to noobs.  That’s what I do.
---
I used to love pvp. Then they removed SBMM and I just can’t mess around with bad weapons anymore. Then they added exploits, overpowered weapons, and made the game feel expensive. I just can’t do it anymoyrr
---
I try but I get DCed way too often and sometimes they just don’t get the message
---
Make sure team fill is turned on
---
I assume your relogging to reset the ghouls right? Are they all dead for 15 minutes after the nuke lands on your private server? Mine sure the hell is lol.
---
&gt; both copy fortnite
---
Just as a note, this element was implemented in pubg before, and some could even argue the Minecraft battle royales implemented it with inspiration from hunger games.
---
Im at Level 9 so i will miss everythong.😅
---
I needa do some dailies but I'm lvl 14! Congratz! Lvling up and xp seems to be a solid way to get score (I run uny so I get that repeatable comes fairly quickly)
---
Wouldn't be holding a ton of legendaries but a decent few. Especially on the 1* useless ones. Id rather trade those for something either a little less useless or some ammo that I could use as opposed to the mesley 5 script you get for em. 
---
And just like any other merchant if i don't have what you're looking for youre welcome to check elsewhere.
---
yup, enjoy it while it lasts
---
Guess it all just comes down to personal taste, been here since launch myself and I love the game. 
---
The YouTube barrage can cause everyone to follow some sort of mob rule, just gotta learn to ignore it and be your own reviewer. 
---
Welcome fellow dweller 🤗
---
I nuked whitesprings and farm the legendarys on a private. Gets me armor and weapons to sell. And levels it decently
---
Most people that are saying it's not a great experience, are players that have no quests left or are just doing dailies. It makes sense, the end game is not really end game as there's nothing to do apart from grinding to get equipment you like.
---
I'm at like 13. I think 8-13 is average. Everyone spazzed the first day and got to like 10 then it slowed down when the weekly's were done.
---
Stalker anomaly mod is the way to go, for stalkerish 👌
---
I've come across him a couple of times, but pretty new to the game. Anything special about him?
---
Didnt know I could relog.  Normally do a run.  Wait 30 min,  do another run.  Takes 2 hours post silo run.
---
I doubt they are lying, 5 shots from an FFR handmade or an explosive laser can appear as one if they weren’t paying attention or if they were lagging.
---
Oh no I was commenting less on what you were planning for it but the plausibility of actually being able to roleplay as an arms dealer.
---
I think your idea is pretty great.  But I’m curious, are you planning to use vendors or to trade off your person?  Because I’m pretty sure that person-to-person trading has become pretty sketchy recently and is kind of hard to get into, at least on PC.
---
And Hunger Games got it from the movie Battle Royale!
---
Snowmen was a precious atom store purchase. I think two Xmas ago
---
Same for the destroy types of robots and gather materials and complete event as a group in didnt get score for any of those 3 weekly challenges. Daily's have been fine.
---
Where is this located?
---
Sure thing. I’ll give them a couple of hours to reply.
---
Ah okay, thanks!
---
thanks for sharing buddy 👍
---
Grats brudda 😁
---
I share Field Surgeon, helps speed up stimpack effects.
---
I trade constantly player to player. I don't like dropping unless I'm dumping because a few times a rando has jacked the trade. Plus its the only way I can effectively sell at the lower rates since caps can't be dropped
---
I'm in the same boat, but I read someplace else that it will eventually come in. This might be true since I remember yesterday I suddenly went up like one and a half levels just randomly and didn't know why, I'm assuming it was a weekly challenge coming in. So look out for it, I'm missing 2k as well from two challenges I completed an hour ago.
---
I think I would be higher but iv been running nuclear winter alot, since the holiday items are currently obtainable. Considering I run heavy combat armor, and a combat rifle you can imagine I'm quite happy with the halloween stuff
---
I recommend creating throwing knives with all your spare steel and having a melee weapon you can depend on. You’ll start stocking ammo in no time. Also use the shotgun
---
Alot of grinding but thanks
---
Just dinged 18
---
After the queen is dead. Run over to the grove and see if the Wendigo Colossus is there, if not, go back to camp. Hang out for like 5 minutes. Wait for the rest of the players to leave the nuke zone. Then head back. You should be able to trigger all the spawn points. When a scorch beast spawns, don't kill it right away. Scortched will continue to spawn (with a bit of a rest between batches) as long as the scorchbeast is alive. 
---
Also, get yourself a syringer with the bloatfly mod. Shoot a scortched with the syringer, then kill it with your regular weapon, it has a chance to spawn a bloatfly, shoot the bloatfly with the syringer, then kill it like normal, repeat for as long as you want. You'll still end up with mostly ionized meat, but I will typically get 1 or 2 high rad fluids from each 10 or so bloatflies I kill in this manner. The best spot to do this is the ruined shack in the grove (not the main house, the shack on the west? end) There is a mole rat in there. Shoot that bad boy with the syringer and start farming. If you stand in the doorway the bloatflies have difficulty escaping. 
---
Also check the robot vendors and player vendors after nukes. I will usually find 3 or 4 just hopping around to different vendors. Every little bit helps.
---
well done my friene 😁
---
Nice
---
I’m in.
---
Former expat here if you’re just wanting someone who knows the lingo
---
Oh, interesting.  I tend to play with my game audio off or just not wearing headphones most of the time so I don’t really engage in the social aspects really.  But that’s pretty cool
---
Also can't turn in 5mm ammo.
---
For sure. I'm at work anyway but if they don't respond DM me or I'll DM you when I get home in the morning and we can coordinate from there.
---
Just...carefully. I know the north eastern corner can be very touchy. As well as most of the middle...you’re just gonna have to play around with it.
---
Holy moly!
---
Currently Rank 13. Did all my dailies and the Repeatable I think 2 or 3 times today as well. I was wondering this too, wanted to see if I'm behind or not. Seems I'm not!
---
true fact tho
---
lul gta online handles everything far better than Bethesdas mobile gaming pay2play shit.
---
He sells some rare items. Like nuka cola clock, cuckoo clock, and hunter's long coat.
---
I've discovered the abandoned bog town, but the world challenge for finding all the workshops still won't complete. I found it around level 50 and I'm now 125. It's not game breaking, but it's like, come on man.
---
I recommend Morgantown Airport, there's meds spread in the whole area and the event it has gives ammo and weapons. Make sure to swap servers if you want more stuff from the event.
---
Oh my goodness, thank you! I definitely need this :) now I'm pumped :)
---
12... Fuck I'm behind..
---
Yea it kinda creeps on you with 44 int :)
---
Awww, the honeymoon phase.
---
I'll have a vendor there with a few hundred rounds of each type at the normal rate, also so players can fast travel to me. but have signs placed to either message my psn or plug in a mic and area chat me.
---
When im out doing my wasteland thing ive always kept my vendors on a switch to shut them off when I didn't want to be disturbed by other players.
---
Target the hatch and you can lock it too
---
How is the lead speaking?
---
Gratz.
---
Quad tesla is my go to.
---
Seems to be getting a lot better.  Few months ago it was every man for themselves it felt like.
---
This. I absolutely love the flamer but it's pretty much a useless weapon at this point
---
&gt;part of the reason is how Bethesda makes everything server side detection, even the smallest thing such as movement.
---
That's not what's causing these issues. 
---
In every well-built online game, the server is the absolute source of truth. Bad implementation is the client saying "Hey server, my character moved from A to B"; good implementation is the client saying, "Hey server, please move my character from A to B". Rule of thumb: **The client must be assumed to be full of shit at all times and cannot be trusted.** 
---
*(Incidentally, Bethesda's idiot-tier client/server implementation is how the inventory stealing hack happened. The server implicitly trusted the client WAY MORE than it should have, so when hackers  figured out how to make the client tell the server "Hey server, that player is a container now", the server responded "Sounds great, whatever you say boss!" which then allowed the hackers to literally loot players like they were a container. Also, remember in the early days when framerate was tied to movement speed and allowed people to run way faster than intended? Good times.)*
---
So the server actually *should* care about every little thing. I think the problems we're seeing arise from the fact that Bethesda's server-side interpolation is dogshit. Fallout 76 has a tick rate of about 20, meaning the server updates the game state 20 times per second. For reference, that's super low. So in order to make the game feel more smooth, the server needs to do interpolation between ticks to smooth things out, and that's where I suspect a lot of the hard to kill bugs that have been around since day one come from, like rubber banding health, unkillable mobs, broken VATS, etc.
---
He rarely sells the clean spacesuit, which is a lot of fun to wear.
---
Finished my challenge by only going to hemlock. Got the Grafton monster and 3 bloody snallygasters.
---
Is there a guaranteed area for the Lakewood Monster? I've been playing since beta and still haven't seen one.
---
Apparently Last Laugh drops a grenade if you get downed... not when you die. So the perk is absolutely worthless when you’re playing solo because you instantly die instead of being downed.
---
I’m very pissed off about this because just now I was among the final people in a tiny circle hiding in a bush and I found a nuke grenade, noticed a team of two so I ran up to them and started punching them expecting to die and nuke them, didn’t work. F*ck this garbage game mode...
---
You’re right, I just did the math and I’ve gotten it all. It just never popped up.
---
Dataminer here ;)
---
Many people assume weapons can only have one type. They NEVER have one type.
---
The NW SMGs are rifles, automatics, pistols, and more.
---
Ground Pounder works on all rifles.
---
The M79, Auto Launcher, and Missile Launcher are both Explosive and Heavy.
---
Shotguns do not benefit from from Tank Killer or Ground Pounder.
---
Thank you, I just remembered that I have a mod for inventory management, maybe it's related.
---
And it's not like they'll get the remaining 70 ranks in 70 hours since the score requirements go up by 25 every rank. It's roughly 17% to rank 100, so it would likely take over 120 more hours to get to rank 100.
---
I am one of the rare people that always scope out the sniping points. Then I snipe them from the bottom, often a headshot. If they’re moving I won’t shoot for the head.
---
An escapee!  It was more to do with the time zones and when everyone can be online...?
---
That’s good to know. Maybe the rewards are just extra laggy for some reason. I did get instant credit for one of my weeklies, just not the other two. Hopefully they’ll show up sometime before the end of the season.
---
You have not tried to fast travel 15 times, just to get countdown for the 16th. And when it reaches 0, you still wont fast travel ... the hell I lost my zen quite bad that day ... :D :D :D  
---
But I know the issue and TBH it happens more on public servers, i rarely encounter this on private.
---
12 atm with only playing like 4 hours a day
---
Seems to be ur average bud
---
I'm going to search this name ok tell her that I will need an invite but I can give her so much. My GT is TODD#65 something something.
---
You are on level 30 of the legendary run, but you don’t know what the burrows are?
---
What triggers and disables these perks is being on a team or not, not the number of players on it.
---
but thats literally what is happening, they took away 90% of free atoms that anyone could save up for whatever they wanted so they could milk people like OP. they know damn well that if they dangle a carrot, and make it grindy bullshit, that lazy people like OP will shell out. thats 100% the design philosophy, to manipulate people using FOMO.
---
they are adding more and more monetization because they know people will pay for it. thats how this shit works. bethesda will sell the least amount of product for the most money, and paying for season skips is lowering the threshold  for what Bethesda has to offer to get people to pay. then on top of that you have people like OP almost imitatively begging to pay.
---
because of pay pigs like OP, we now get less, work more for it, and get less choice that what we had before. what people pay for effects everybody. you can pretend that it doesn't and play mental gymnastics but it doesnt change reality. 
---
clearly i touched a nerve, and youre insecure about the amount of money youre about to dump on this garbage, and thats just life, there are chumps in every circle.
---
I think my int is like 8 or 9. I tried to be in a group earlier, both building and event and ether didnt have people join or they left so it was real pointless to me
---
That's pretty good
---
I'd save your atoms for right now in case you want to rank up in the season later on. The collectrons and such aren't as helpful as they seem.
---
As long as you haven't glitched your camp to be over budget then yes, you're safe. If you want to be extra secure just put your vending as far away as possible from the point people spawn in.
---
20
---
I got your promise,  not a scratch
---
Is she hot
---
U must really want something in it
---
Quite a few people will burn out well before the season is over. I'm already burnt out from the bullion grind, so I'm taking a break for a while.
---
Now all we need is to be able to build underwater and you can make Zoidberg's house.
---
This is just my take on all those things
---
1 - The game supports so many different builds and styles of play. It's pretty clear the goal is meant to build around what you have and then improve from there. Not spend 100's of hours, ungodly amounts of caps and real life money all to have the most damage possible. Fallout 76 is a lot like Elder Scrolls Online in the idea of not being meta friendly and instead create your own build with what you have. 
---
2 - The ammo converter has a terrible interface but it is only days old. I believe something will change there. As for the ammo exchange rates, kinda feel if you don't use .38 and want 5.56 (me), then it helps a lot in ammo supplies but if you were expecting it to fully supply you for your choice ammo. Well that demanding too much as well as ignoring all the issues it would create. Hell I got 3000 5.56 ammo out of the thing when I first used it. I'd improve the interface and take the point cap out of the game or increase it to 10,000. 
---
3 - Considering in interviews and so on the idea that the gold bullion rewards are not meant to be something you get soon. I think they'll increase the price for those items. As for daily limits, they'd but gone if they didn't get people playing more often. Plus with the balancing behind them, I'd imagine everything would be increase in price for caps and script if that happens. Why would they add a effective way to keep people playing and get rib of it.
---
4 - Survival mode was dead long before it was removed. Though I don't understand why they had to remove for all 10 people who liked it.
---
5 - The Atom thing bothers me but them 1500 is more atoms than like 99.9% would grind in the old system. In fact, most people would just buy them regardless. Already seen a lot of people wearing only what is in the atomic shop right now.
---
6 - Blooded does need a nerf, but if you get a weapon with over 200 fire rate, that's when things like the scorched beast queen dies before you even can shoot it. Bloodied is losing popularity at most of them were too scared to do anything. Too much "oh no I have no health what to I do, I must hide and not attack or do anything" and nest to no "I'm playing a built where I must kill everything before they can kill me". More and more people are changing to junkies because the scaredy cat styles of a boodled build is not fun. I'd argue of you wanted a game where people play there own builds and not the meta, then both bloodied and junkies would have to be nerfed.
---
7 - I think it needs to be shortened not removed.
---
8 - rifle weight reduction perks would be great but no on uses those types of perks. Only chems, ammo and junk related one. I don't think it's that important in my opinion.
---
That's the last item I need to get from him. I got the hunter's long coat the first time I found him, and he always has a regular spacesuit, but that clean version has yet to reveal itself to me.
---
Ah the fabled
---
637E28E245C74A6AA051
---
You have struck it rich
---
Not that I know of. Been playing since a month after beta and I've seen less than 10.
---
This isn't just a new player thing, sadly it normal for all levels xD
---
it has INSANE reload speed.
---
its ugly as shit, but a very good alternative to a handmade if you dont own one. 
---
honestly, its worth alot more than 10K  in my estimation.
---
Same.  Just completed several of mine and didn't get any SCORE points
---
In order for people to have any chance of getting to 100, all weekly challenges need to persist until they are completed or the season ends. That's how Fortnite does it so people who start the season late aren't unable to progress.
---
im sure a shit not going to give beth my atoms. fuck that.
---
im frontloading the grind in case i miss too many days in the future.
---
Sure good idea if private world has it own character apart from public servers
---
As of the fix, yes 4 str 4 end and 2 agi plus 15/15/15  others were fixed as well.
---
Hiya! I’m lvl 35, just started playing like a month ago. DEFINITELY still learning the ropes haha, but i’m a quick learn. Would love some company out in the Appalachians, none of my friends have played 76 yet (very unfortunate). My PSN is Hundredhands4u :)
---
I just... Are you in third person.... Do you have a split personality.... Or are you... Because I am confused... You are the exact same person who posted... I just... WHAT!?
---
Hopefully they fix this and give everyone a score boost because not getting score you earned feels like time wasted
---
Try doing them in public teams.
---
Two-Shot adds an additional pellet to the 7? existing ones, so no. For a crippler, look for the Explosive effect, which does double the number of hits each shot does, and those the chances for Enforcer to proc.
---
I will definitely be adding you now :)
---
I second: easiest spot get the plans. Just bring tons of caps.
---
They are everywhere but never at 100%..
---
The challenges registered as completed but I didn’t get the score from them, being in a team wouldn’t help at this point
---
👏 more 👏 dailys 👏
---
It's all pretty much aesthetics. The Contemporary bundle is the only thing I think is worth a look rn. IMO don't buy anything that isn't expiring unless you are sitting on a fat stack like 3000+
---
Yeah. I regret selling now. Never had a decent gun so i was always a melee main
---
Yea, poor guy. It seems like his Alzheimer's is getting worse and worse...
---
It's not an exploit, you just don't understand how the game works. All weapons have multiple types. Accusing people of using exploits because you assume you know how the game works is just low.
---
The Radium Rifle is both a Ballistic and Energy. Energy and Small Gun Bobbles work on it. It's not an exploit, that's how it's coded. The Gauss Rifle is both Ballistic and Energy, but it also has an Explosive projectile, so it benefits from all 3. Again, not an exploit, it's coded that way.
---
It'll suck, and I'll watch every second of it. 
---
:D
---
Both.
---
There was a video from either norespawns or final render building above that train car bunker. Worth checking out.
---
one of the biggest issues, that and vats.
---
Not sure but I wouldn’t be surprised if it didn’t tbh
---
Same thing happened to me tonight
---
Im only rank 12
---
Have to give credit to Bethesda for the new team system.  It really maximises the gameplay and also makes LFG on PC a lot less hassle.
---
I shouldn’t be surprised a bug like this is out there yet here I am both surprised and disappointed
---
Most people here are just fishing for reassurance that the other guy cheated. It's an easy out. 🤦‍♂️
---
God damnit they planned this all along. They nerfed the free atoms so people will spend real money on ranks.
---
Same, I just use it as a decoration in my garage lol.
---
The joke is that Chewie does all the work.
---
I'm coming in now if he's still alive, but I'm guessing he's probably dead by now.
---
That's really awesome of you
---
15, just about to hit 16 as well.
---
I believe there will be a double xp weekend a few times before the season end, mass leveling if that happens will likely get a good few rewards
---
I seriously hope they keep this based on cannon and not some JJ Abrams type hack job on the lore. I'd also hope they keep the story focused on FO and not some modern social agenda. Keep it focused on survival and the moral issues addressed in the games.  So much story material and lore to use. I don't want an Abrams type alternate universe adaptation which ignores cannon and physics of the world.
---
You're gonna be fine, people have done the math right now and there's some room for missing challenges. Just try your best and you should get far. Also just a FYI the 150 atom rewards you get from the run can be used later to buy levels, and it basically doesn't cost you anything.
---
I share my 3* Bloody Mess. 15% more damage is probably useful to everyone.
---
Ah shit, here we go again
---
Pretty sure it is a bug. Not complaining though, free loot of things I wasn't there to kill :D
---
You likely received the SCORE when the challenge was at 3/5. Most of the weekly challenges are buggy right now and reward SCORE at 3/5 instead of 5/5.
---
Congratulations!! 😀
---
haha. same shit happened to me on my 3rd run. that is why i nuke only while playing on private server. If u got disconnected u can connect to the same server in this case. But I dont recommend if ur goal is farming hi-rad fluids and other stuff.
---
BuT i'Ll NeVeR bE aBlE tO gEt AlL tHe ThInGs!!!
---
Understandable good on you, this pass isnt set up for the average gamer like most other company's would have done
---
now they just need to fix the power armor through qalls glitch
---
I completely agree.  Casual players who might only have time to play an hour or two every few days should be able to access the end rewards just as much as those who play for hours a day.  A good balance does need to be struck though.  If you want to grind out the whole season in a couple of weeks that option should be there, however it should be paced out so that those who play less will *just* make level 100 by the end of the season.  
---
Honestly I think it's just another grab at cash since you can just buy your way through the whole thing; unless they add in more ways to earn score points a lot of people are saying you can't even get to level 100 without using atoms.
---
It's a ridiculous grind but I'm getting levels left and right last 2 days if gained maybe 10 to 15
---
Bloodied by far, though both are OP compared to all of the enemies in the game.
---
Because no one ever said casual play would yield you all the rewards. Not sure why you cant grasp that.
---
Season rewards are hot garbage
---
Yea people are not yet getting the whole int=xp thing. I run with two account so i don't have that problem. My mule account just sits at the camp providing "Inspirational" perk and "Empath" mutation. While my main shares "Strange in Numbers" perk for nice synergy.
---
I hope that’s the case, I weirdly want the power armor from this season.
---
Omg yes, even just lockpicking and hacker would make me very happy.
---
I'm level 188 and I haven't done it either. 😶 I am such a coward.
---
Another show needs your help. Here, I’ll mark it for you on your TV guide.
---
Every team needs strange in numbers shared. Travel agent can be a nice qol to share if everyone is going around mostly doing their own thing.
---
How do you glitch through doors?
---
The contemporary bundle is the best thing they've ever released imo
---
Yeah, grinding NW myself. Enjoying it a lot more than I thought I would. It's cool to have a Fallout battle royale.
---
It's easier to just run on a private server for me so I'm not competing for kills with other people. That mixed in with group participation already declining
---
I tend to sell cheap. Caps are easy to get so I figure why not help others.
---
Awesome thank you!! Super excited to figure all this stuff out, whenever you see me online feel free to hop in :)
---
Check your laptops spec's. There websites online that will check for you.
---
It's been there since this game wasn't even released- I mean, since OBT.
---
At this point, I'm 100% sure bethesda can't fix this problem.
---
sorry bud, I hung around for half an hour with no takers so I jumped servers.
---
Get a screenshot?
---
If anything, this outrageous grind makes me less interested in the game.
---
Awesome thank you!! Super excited to figure out all this stuff and “get good” lol. Whenever I’m online feel free to hop in :)
---
Intelligence passively increases your xp gain, much like endurance increases your HP
---
If it was that bad no one would play it. It is bad, not enough to keep me from my Fallout obsession. Yet ...
---
I was so close to quiting when I lost my b2525 HM to a pipboy glitch.
---
Yea this is my 2nd character who's become my main so hes alot lower level in nw but I managed to get all the perk cards for my build at level 12 so I'm doing really well in it. But im to the point that im tired of just hiding in a bush and have taken a very aggressive approach to it and have been enjoying alot more. I got 3 wins today. Unfortunately mo1 else had a mic but they listened to me during the wins
---
I had never played NW before the latest patch. Now, SCORE pts dailies have a NW option, so that was enough to get me to try it. So far, it's a lot more fun than I expected... but I haven't met any 'hackers' yet (as far as I can tell). Killed a few people, and have died a LOT. I suck at PVP, and I don't know all the 'good spots' to start to get decent crates. Several times I've died with nothing but fists LOL! Still fun, though! :)
---
It’s not just you.  
---
We all hoped that the last patch would fix that.  
---
 I tend to count to 10 before confirming for each dialog screen. It seems to help. Sometimes.
---
Owl_No is my psn 
---
im a poor little noob
---
I didn't even see it in game. This is how far I thought about it: [https://i.imgur.com/uCWib3C.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/uCWib3C.jpg)
---
You could add the amount of ammo you want to change (250), or adjust the amount through the extra mats you need for it (8) (if it requires extra mats). Ok I forgot the button for the actual "convert!" action heheh. All ammo on screen all the time. Or! maybe through a fast slot machine type of selection. Then you could pull the lever and the new ammo would rain on you and then you'd have to pick them up from all over the ground and everyone else could steal it... or maybe just rain straight into your inventory.
---
Yes if your using enforcer. No if not but still more than most legendary effects, though there are better perks to do that.
---
Depends which collectron is available. I don't have the normal one, I have the commie bot and fasnacht ones and the things they get me are sometimes incredibly useful if even just as extra things to give away such as alcohol from fasnacht bot or radaway from commie
---
Yeah it's fairly easy to get levels in a 4 man event xp group.
---
I don't see why that would be necessary. The way I'd see it probably working is that you get a private world that stays the same no matter you're on or off and it keeps all your workshops (and maybe keeps the power plants powered up???) and have the option to reset the world completely if you want a fresh private world.
---
Build as many as you want.
---
That's an unfortunate truth.
---
Well, tbf, that's what nuclear winter is for. It's very much team pvp. And it hasn't been nerfed.
---
Most people don't need what you share or already use it. So no damage perks if you want to be useful. I share travel agent as I found not many people use it.
---
Haven't been able to get on a full squad since day 1 of update people end up leaving or no 1 joins
---
They're already aware - https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hjqrrb/can_we_rally_bethesda_to_polish_the_screaming/fwpax1r/
---
Not true. Very few gecks were ever created, far far less than the actual number of vaults they built.
---
I didn't mean Evasive, i meant Serendipity. that one saves me quite often. I sprint alot in combat, so Dodgy is a no go for me. I  have little invested in Endurance since the perks mostly suck. 
---
I don't run Evasive anymore. 
---
I also do not want to run Heavy armor. My build is mainly being high Strength for damage, high agility to move and sprint around quick, and some luck just for fun. 
---
Vanguard and Bolstering seemed great, it's free DR/ER for literally nothing. I get some at full health, it dips a little bit around mid health, then i spike again at low health while Serendipity activates to keep me going so I can finish.
---
I used to offer all extra plans at 0caps but every now and then some asshat came and bought them all, even duplicates, so now I tend to put them at 10caps and it seems to have worked out nice, even though I'd prefer to let the newbies get them for free
---
This happens a lot for me at the grafton steel workshop. Its like the super mutants that are usually patrolling around near the vertibird station just dony spawn, but their entire inventory shows up haha. EZ pickings 🥰
---
Third day of doing dailies, barely cracked 14, with a couple hundred to spare. That's including the level up xp.
---
Snowman’s are awesome, but have you ever tried out placing 200 portable toilets so your enemy either looks through then all to find you or just gives up? It’s amazing what you can do with really dumb buildings lol, killed two players because they were distracted by a toilet and an oil lamp and fasnacht balloons I placed on a foundation. Good times.
---
I couldn’t tell which fast travel bug you were talking about but yeah this one sucks. I click fast travel, grab my phone, zone out, and a minute later realize I’m in the same spot.
---
roll a joint
---
Throwing a controller through your TV is a hell of a response to a 30 second inconvenience. If you end up doing this you probably have larger anger issues.
---
You can build as many as you want. Their not technically a skin, but they basically are which is why people call them skins.
---
Once you buy it. You never have to buy it again. Have as many as you want. It works just like any other generator in every way.
---
That depends on a lot of factors, such as her distance from you, where you hit, what kind of weapon they are using, etc. In any case, if you can't use a prime weapon on her, you should at the minimum be using a sales zealots weapon.
---
I'm at 14. It would be higher but I had to spend a while doing NW. No way I was going to miss out on getting that glowing skeleton early.
---
Maybe it's a futuristic vape
---
This is the best option when theirs to much lag it empties the legendarys inventory too stop lag before I can get it
---
Its only been one week so it shouldn't be hard to calculate if you got it. Unless you've gone ham on the repeatable 100.
---
All the communists in the deep wear a all black spy outfit, if I remember correctly.
---
Strange in Numbers and Inspirational are good.
---
Lmao. It was definitely a bit of an exaggeration. But it’s for sure the most annoying thing in the game and should have been patched out by now.
---
I can't tell you how many times I've watched someone walk right into the bush I was hiding in and spend a good 1-2 minutes right next to me without every knowing I was there. That ghillie suit works amazingly for its intended purpose.
---
afraid not.
---
Nah I haven’t gone ham, I’ve only done yesterday and today’s dailies, excluding Nuclear Winter, and most of the weeklies
---
I visited this subreddit, half expecting some Rule 34 stuff.
---
I was instead pleasantly surprised. Thank you!
---
Lol same
---
What I dont understand is why you got downvotes for a reasonable question and I got upvotes for making a snarky comment on Bethesda's UI in general.
---
I quite enjoy them, they just look super classic and are neat under windows. I’d recommend.
---
Buddy if that genuinely feels like politics for you, you live under a rock. Its satire at best and slander at worst. Nothing there displays any propaganda towards any political allegiance, you uncultured loser. ALSO WHAT PART OF WHAT I SAID HAS A SOCIAL AGENDA. Dont copy and paste what you see on your feed and claim it as original thought. Do some real thinking bud
---
I think they said you have to wait 2 weeks before that begins
---
I can get a picture of them together for you, if you want
---
Not really. As it stands, it's been increasing by 25 every level. Quite frankly, the only time you could earn "double" would be the few days that leveling up is part of the daily list, and then you get 500 xp for it. As I stated before, weeklies are going to be our real money makers here, at 1000 to 1500 score per weekly. My suspicion is that they intentionally did it this way to force people to spend atoms if they want all the rewards. If I'm correct, it's pretty damn shady on their part.
---
If you click on your vendor and it shows items that are in your stash, without a sale price tag next to it, that doesn't mean that other players can see those items, it just shows you them because it is stash "connected" so that you can easily take items that are in stash out to then price them for the vendor.  They aren't actually visible to other players.
---
ah damn for real? didnt hear about that
---
sell it for 2-3K caps
---
I may sell it I’m just asking if it’s good
---
Yep im adding you now :)
---
Then you aren't hurting anyone but yourself. Improvise, adapt, and overcome.
---
yes it is good, use it and sell it when u got a better minigun
---
Ok nice!
---
You aren't meant to be trusted.
---
Thank you so much, really appreciate the help
---
AFK SCORE.
---
I know this may sound bad but I just want a male lead
---
I only played enough to get the ammo converter with this latest patch, I'll be stopping until the winter update because by then we should have BoS DLC, Legendary Perks that have had time to go through plenty of changes and possible additions, One Appalachia for leveling new characters even better along with the new Public Team system, and if they can get it out "this time" the Perk Card Profiles that don't require a mod.  
---
I'll stop in to check out the pre-BOS quest on my main but otherwise there's no point plowing away day after day for nothing of actual substance.
---
this isnt what i mean, everything in my stash was listed at its base value in my vendors.
---
That sucks, I won’t buy thirty levels for just one or two items lol
---
1. Find any ultracite ore vein in the world. ANYWHERE.
---
Click to harvest the vein, if it disappears fast ravel away to unload the area, then return. If it stays, and still prompts you to harvest that is what you want.
---
When you attempt harvest an ultracite vein the game will spawn a number of scorched (and rarely a scorchedbeast) around you to attack you. It works best on bugged out ore veins that are already harvested and don't actually harvest when you interact with them, as you can spam click them to spawn dozens or scorched in seconds.
---
This allows you to infinitely harvest enemies for materials at almost anywhere you can find ore in almost any nuke zone, as random ores can be transmuted into ultracite by nukes. 
---
It is preferable the ore is somewhere with line of sight blockers, like in a trench in cranberry bog, as the game will spawn the enemies as close to you as possible, but not somewhere you can see them spawn, so if you are in an open field they will spawn miles away, if you are in a trench you can't see out of they will spawn almost on top of you.
---
Dude if your on xbox I’ll give you a level 50 one for free cuz I feel bad that you got a level 30
---
Alrighty thanks
---
Mfw my quad explosive pump shotgun takes two shots to kill a level 5 ghoul but will one shot a level 65 charred ghoul in vats no problem: :DDDD
---
It gives the halloween stuffs too.
---
I totally bush wookie it and I'm having a blast. I played before to get the ghillie suit and I'm back for the old Halloween and Christmas stuff. 
---
I never fire a shot and most times I don't even pick up a gun. I just pretend it's a big game of hide and seek. I make top 10 more often than not and have even won a couple (although in all honesty the scorched won them for me).
---
That happens a lot.  I’m not sure if it’s a bug, but if you need meat then that’s a great place to get it.
---
Bad. Very bad.
---
Cyrolators are pretty good for boss fights, since it basically renders them unable to harm you.
---
But I’m curious - why did you wait so long before launching a nuke?
---
I was thinking of doing the same thing next weekend. It's annoying to level up my lvl 111 character. I do have a lvl 26 one as well, but I found out that that's not as fast either. Can't take on the tough enemies so I'm getting next to nothing for kills and I've already done all the starter quests.
---
So guess it's time to make a temporary character every weekend...
---
You can make zoidbergs house, just place a dumpster.
---
How do you get so much damage out of your weapon? Is it just perks or legendary effects?
---
Ok contact me when youre ready
---
How many hours spent?
---
Honestly best way to find a team is asking on here I’m on Xbox if you wanna play sometime
---
Ok sent it
---
Jfc that's a lot... this will be an insane grind for people with literally anything else to do.
---
I don’t have high hopes, but I’ll at least try out the first episode.
---
The exact same thing happens with my two shot combat shotty, it's so frustrating
---
What platform are you on?  
---
Also I would suggest making a ticket for Bethesda support so that they can look into it.
---
He spawns in two or three places now. He isn't hard to get to spawn
---
thank you. i ignored this challenge because i wasn't sure what qualified as an cryptid.
---
A lot of people don't know that Inspirational and the new lunchbox perks stack per person. You're able to hit the 4k per gain cap on exp for events legitimately now, plus enemies easily getting into the 5-600 range.
---
yeah maybe I'll end up hating it after a long time.
---
Ikr... Give it time, and he'll end up with the digital herpes known as bugthesda love
---
Ditto?
---
Just be slowly dragging your loot back to watoga train station after a scorchbeast queen fight, over encumbered,, injured and low on ammo for your big guns, and walk past the sam site. That'll trigger it, and assaultrons and gutsys and scorchbeasts galore
---
im ps4, not gonna bother with tickets, too much hassle tbh, ill stick to playin solo in private for now.
---
Thats what nuke mines were for...easy junk from an afk asshole
---
wdym by that?
---
I’m on now
---
Carnivore doubles meat effects and removes veggie effects.
---
Herbivore doubles veggie effects and removes meat effects.
---
What do you consider good prices? I'm mostly selling plans (have about 110 in my vendors) and I sell all of them for half the value the game says they are. Also they're mostly camp plans, no power armor or prime receivers. But I have noticed they're not selling very hard. Obviously higher level players will have all that stuff already.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Man, Reddit sucks at sarcasm.
---
This better not end up like super Mario Bros....
---
I suggest checking your quest tab under both daily misc, side quests misc, and events, 
---
I had a period of three days where I didn't get a quest from her then randomly happened to find the weapons box out in the world, and when checking under my tabs I found the objective under the daily misc tab next to talk to cloe, which was strange, 
---
When I went to her the mission ended normally and i got the usual rewards.
---
Hope they leave out all bugs &amp; glitches
---
Yep, I just did not wanna be behind.
---
They never have a screenshot.. 😩
---
Harpoons are good once you run out because if you shoot the dead body of any entity with a flechette harpoon gun you get back more harpoons than you spend, allowing you to generate infinite points.
---
That will be useful after they make the interface not hot garbage, but whatever it's worth.
---
Facts my friend plays a stealth rifle man build and I just go him back omg the game a while back and some of his perk cards refuse to work and all the engines keep regenerating like there Deadpool
---
ahh hell yea, more free shit for playing the game even tho its not that time of year :)
---
I'm level 213 and I was so annoyed yesterday because I needed the level up to finish the daily challenges. I was so annoyed... and had completely blanked on the idea of logging in on one of my alts for five minutes. 
---
I might have to make a mule that just carries around old food because there will surely be a "eat 20 pre-war food" challenge sooner or later.
---
This shit is getting ridiculous, my gauss shotgun is useless after the update.
---
It'll be based on Bethesda's hack job of the lore
---
theres always one with a snarky reply...
---
The one at the airport I forget what’s it called but just send up a flare and boom event time
---
Welcome to the internet 🤷‍♂️
---
Interesting it doesn’t say it does tho
---
&gt;6 - Blooded does need a nerf, but if you get a weapon with over 200 fire rate, that's when things like the scorched beast queen dies before you even can shoot it. Bloodied is losing popularity at most of them were too scared to do anything. Too much "oh no I have no health what to I do, I must hide and not attack or do anything" and nest to no "I'm playing a built where I must kill everything before they can kill me". More and more people are changing to junkies because the scaredy cat styles of a boodled build is not fun. I'd argue of you wanted a game where people play there own builds and not the meta, then both bloodied and junkies would have to be nerfed.
---
Bs. Junkies is a worthless build to me, would never run it. You take way too many negatives to your special to achieve the same results that bloodied gets. And as far as hiding, hell no. I'm in the thick of battle, killing everything and very rarely even getting hit due to smart perk choices and d.r.
---
Yes that or put it on a second floor
---
Trash. Food build at its finest. Where you at? Ima come  steal your junk.
---
I'm just under 13, would be at it if I did either of the first 2 NE dailies. Finished all the weeklies. At this pace I should hit maybe 3 to 6 more levels depending on XP gains over the weekend.
---
Then I'm going to have to assume you are just full of it.
---
No screenshot, and too "lazy" to file a 2 minute ticket.
---
Wasn't that something that was happening to players who used the camp budget exploit?
---
I wish it happened to me at most 3 times. I'm usually doing it a half dozen or more. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.
---
If you missed out on the Halloween, Winter or Survivor unlockables, they are unlocking now for an unknown limited time. Until Bethesda gets around to fixing it.
---
well hopefully they dont change anythin till the hotpatch comin soon
---
Place your camp in a tree. The way building works is that you get as many levels BELOW the camp as you do above. So you can achieve up to 9 or ten levels with smart placement.
---
I can understand that
---
Just got the closing skeleton outfit have the  chrismas left
---
Dm me too I don’t voice chat tho
---
The game fun, but the endgame is bad.
---
Nope, disabled all of my addons, tried all the displays, the jarred head &amp; hand just won't show up in the inventory for me to select.
---
Aww, is someone a petty bitch to the point where one suggestion makes you go through someone's post history? I hope they keep the Adrenaline perk broken so your dumbass has to actually try to play the game.
---
i think each point is 3% but some user say 4$ other 2% xdddd
---
One day i must check it
---
Thank you! Going to try that right now.
---
Yeah, I marked them
---
assume what you like my friend im not here for your validation, just to see if it happened to anyone else.
---
I’m too lazy to read through the page, when are they sending double XP weekend?
---
Same. People are so greedy even when you try to be nice.
---
Third time's a charm, but very annoying.
---
Empath counts you as being your own team mate, so when you are on a team you get the benefits of your own empath. The same works for herd mentality.
---
HOWEVER, for empath you need to be on a team of 2 minimum for it to activate, as it requires a target that is not you to start working, while herd only requires you to be "on a team", so works in a public team of only yourself.
---
This was changed for empath, on the test server it worked like herd mentality on a team of 1, and thus would be neutral without perks, and would be almost as good as lone wanderer with class freak.
---
Having more than one empath does not have any effect, as one empath is enough to give the benefits to all 4 players, having more than one is worse as it means more people are having the penalty.
---
Nah, don't be sorry, you made the effort to share him. I just wasn't fast enough. Thanks anyway.
---
You're gonna end up regretting not doing those nw ones. Some people have made spreadsheets of the bare minimum level you should be at the end of each day to reach level 100 on the last day of the event. They also figured the results of not doing the NW dailies, and it would end up with you at 95.
---
&gt;Yeah God forbid a company try to turn a profit so they can create more content.  I'll defend who I like.
---
Wtf? They designed the season knowing that some people will grind every challenge, grind every event and earn their way through with their time.   
---
And their calculations allowed for the %age of people who will pay their way through.  
---
They've built this to match their profitability plans. They are *already* making a profit.  
---
Broken reward systems penalise the players, they don't cut into profits.
---
It's not a bug. What it is it's the system eventually giving everyone the chance to collect what the killer if the mob didn't loot.
---
I got the Ghillie suit randomly today. I don’t play NW very often, so that was a nice surprise. Bushwookie life for me now!
---
Pro tip for when you do launch one, the less robots you kill in the beginning - the less can spawn later on in the silo
---
Take note of the new community calendar in this week's [*Inside the Vault*](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/55xUO5myjkzlgAewWjzCxl/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-july-updates).
---
Game devs think consistent short bursts of play is better than massive no life grinding whenever you want for whatever reason
---
Expat as in expatriot?
---
What rank are you? With the first set of weeklies and the first days dailies complete it was possible to be around rank 10 iirc. With the 2nd and 3rd set of dailies id estimate rank 12-13?
---
Also we are getting double score weekend eventually so that should rocket you forward
---
They don't factor in the repeatable score challenges or the double xp weekend coming up or the double score day. Plus you can spend atoms to gain levels worst case scenario. AMD you earn enough atoms doing the legendary run to. It more than a handful.
---
This is always the one I hit up
---
The bloatfly syringer is an underappreciated tool. On several occasions I've spent 20 minutes farming them with a friend and we pick up more than 20 HR fluids and even more other components. I think about 1 in 30 bloatflies is a legendary--a low level one, mind you, but still a good reward.
---
Other unique rare outfits he sells are longshoreman coat (yellow tattered raincoat), winter jacket and jeans, red and green ski suit, and clean straight jacket. He also has a unique fisherman's overalls too that's a recolor of one of the standard one.
---
Happens to me all the time. But far the most annoying bug in this game.
---
I always sell plans at 11c. Even the jetpacks.
---
Even though I bought my jetpack at 2k I think.
---
Nah you all are missing the greatest of all places to nuke and XP farm. The barrows.
---
gz op :) I'm lvl 203 and i launched my first nuke around lvl 150, awesome feeling. 
---
P.S.: If somebody needs help launching a nuke on PC, hmu ingame (ign: anchronix).
---
Perks, magazine, bobble heads, chems. All those together along with good aim? Easy peasy
---
This started with Wastelanders. It's pretty nice. Sometimes you can find a despawned scorchbeast Queen pile and pick up really good loot.
---
No.
---
This! 
---
Apex does it the same way a d honestly, I‘m stumped I haven’t thought of that yet.
---
plushie is part of the legendary run
---
ohhhhh, i check it when i will be online
---
I just hate the idea of using a non mutated toon to do challenges. Without Speed Demon and Marsupial the movement is just, well, horrid. :)
---
You apparently haven't nuked the burrows then...
---
Mobs mobs mobs. It's all about mobs. I hit lvl 18 on the board tonight. Got about 30k XP from irradiated event alone from mobs. Just do slap damage and move onto the next target. Rinse repeat. That's awesome!
---
So at this guys rate, 12 days instead of 7. Cool.
---
Agreed, it would be amazing to visit other players servers and see their takes on the same locations, as well as be able to build up our own worlds.
---
Play. Something. Else.
---
Fuck, it's not that hard.
---
Yes.  Basically looking for English speaking people who are in or around the Chinese time zone
---
I wouldn't mind a 5% chance the the Mad Dog Super Mutant Event buffs him dual wielding mini guns while being piggybacked by a Behemoth carrying the anti scorch beast middle turret.
---
It better be a 1:1 conversion. I have 10k+ 5mm ammo waiting to be converter to .45 but if I do it now, I will only get a whopping 522 .45 ammo for 10k 5mm ammo. That's complete bullshit that you lose so much ammo in the process.
---
You're  one if those bethesda fan boys?
---
Having played the PTS I can say: &gt;!yes they're rewards from doing the event, so they're not available yet!&lt;. You can interact with the plushie and it makes a groaning sound, and the trophy is animated.
---
Ok good to know. Just have to remember how to launch my own nukes
---
Ha!  I didn’t realize you could put your camp module in a tree!  Thank you.
---
I have a toilet, a generator, and a clean billboard with neon letters "This isnt a decoy! Honest!!" Written on it.
---
Yeah I agree not a fan on how that works. Should be like put desired quantity to be converted
---
Wait if people sell theirs to robot vendors, the materials show in the robot's inventory for others to buy?
---
Also with patch 20 the Halloween, Winter and Survivor unlockables are dropping with Overseer XP.
---
This has some serious potential. Obviously I’m expecting Father Todd to get his grubby hands on the script and “edit it” for “more purposes”, but here’s hoping it’s good!
---
Yes. Best mutation there is, followed by Speed Demon
---
why don't you just play mineycrafta?
---
No such event as Encrypted.
---
Same here, I think the only plan I sell for more than 10 caps is The Fixer, usually 7,500 caps unless someone offers me more.  If someone really wants it, then I just end up dropping it for em for free.  Gives the warm fuzzies
---
If you use that mutation it is worth it. You can also sell the serum to vendors for 500 caps.
---
Bethesda cares dumbass.
---
Yep havent tried that yet I'll try it
---
As far as I know most of the ebay markets are scams, and we didn't had a weapon-dupe glitch for around 13 Months. (The last in May 2019 were most of the Legacies were duped).
---
I think just reballancing them would be enough since they still have worth to collectors and stuff, and like I said they are great flex guns.
---
Reintroducing them back in the game would make much sense because it was a glitch that made these roles spawn ion the first place. (Since energy weapons don't shoot physical projectiles) 
---
The only Legacies that would make some sense to be reintroduced would be the Gauss Rifle, Radium Rifle and the dragon wich should actually spawn with the explosive effect since they're shooting bullets.
---
Tanks again for your feedback, I really appreciate it.
---
a buddy if miine has had this for weeks.
---
Maybe, but I've ran into a pile of goods in a nuke form a enemy my friend killed ages before and got high radiation fluids. Something my friend would of got as he loots everything not nailed down.
---
Also this loot never used to be a thing till a few weeks ago. Since beta till recently this never happened. So I'm inclined to believe it isn't intentional.
---
need mods for them... shit goes TRRRRRR and gg
---
How old are you lol
---
I like the sound of that
---
I will use it to help lower level players so maybe 100 caps
---
Prepare for postpartum when you do.
---
If you have 10 hours a day to spend on the game, sure. 99.9% of people don't.
---
There two things here...
---
Legacy gun - a gun where certain effects no longer drop. Examples include the double legendary effect on any gun. Why was this removed? Not sure it didn't really break anything. Quad exists for most guns. Another one is legendary dragons. Once again, now sure why they removed it from drop lists... However, when people speak of legacies they're usually talking about explosive energy weapons (laser gun, plasma gun, Gatling laser, Gatling plasma, flamer, cryolator, Tesla, harpoon, and whatever else I can't remember). The explosive legendary star breaks energy weapons as the shots become ballistic. This results in the being bugged and do extreme damage.
---
Why is the guy buying down-voted? Because the legendary effects described is impossible and had nothing to do with legacy. Wikia has a good explanation on how legendary effects work but the summary is.. explosive (abbreviated as E) and 25% faster fire rate (abbreviated as 25 or FF or FFR) and others is a second star effect and thus can't ever be on the same weapon. Legacies still followed the drop rules so you'll never see E and FFR on the same weapon.
---
That's not necessarily saying those "impossible" guns don't exist... Because well... they do... These guns are called hacked or illegal weapons and you should avoid them like the plague. Bethesda might one day ban ppl who have our have even just touched one...
---
The shit tier client/server implementation is actually mind boggling beyond believe considering that id Software belongs to the Zenimax family...
---
If id can't fix your netcode, you done fucked up in every possible way.
---
Your just to slow.
---
Yeah I was wondering this myself, I have a lot of atoms to pass around after I bought my desireables.
---
Nice gesture but you know some level 187 clownshoe will come along and clear out your stock.
---
Congratulations!  I was 113th, and i still had help geting through the silo.  A sissy good accomplishment.
---
No problem! I know the pain of losing a mutation you need. You’re not an idiot, we’ve all been there.
---
Oh yeah
---
If you dropped the nuke.. then by all means shred the Queen to pieces. Otherwise, hit the damage requirement and step back.
---
I think rank 9 right now. I'm working on the weekly. The supplies one doesn't go up if you get 5/5 building supplies you have to complete all of them
---
I think OPs point shows that there's a method to the exponential growth. Sure he got to 30 in 3 days but take his tips and 100 over ten weeks is absolutely doable.
---
Australia here
---
WTH lol I got to rank 4 on day 1 lol
---
I'd guess that he's at a stage in life where he can't go back to playing games like he used to and the job isn't particularly fulfilling and/or high paying. As a result he resents it and projects that into the game as unfair. As opposed to something that's not aimed at his demographic. This is most likely the guy getting angry at his situation not you or even the game.
---
I can relate, but then I changed position to a better paying job with less working hours.
---
It’s not a crime to voice disliking new grindy content. Not saying anything is a great way to make Bethesda think it’s all they have to churn out to keep us busy. Look what happened with ammo converter. It’s alrdy getting reworked bc of criticism.
---
The nozzle is bugged and has to be reset every time you log in. You reset the vaporization nozzle by changing the barrel from long to short and back. If you don't, the flamer has almost zero range with the vaporization nozzle.
---
Put the vaporization nozzle on first, then the long barrel. This will fix the range. Every time you log in, swap the long barrel to short and back to long again.
---
Thanks. I was wondering why I couldn’t find it. The more I know...
---
I sell most plans for 10% of game price. Ammo for 1c
---
i got a junkie 25% faster fire rate mg42, one of my 'get shit done' weapons
---
I’m like 14 but what do you do to grind that extra xp? Events or legendary farming?
---
I'm not junkies because of that very reason :D But it is second best for damage and also full  health.
---
Also if you take offense to my comment on scared bloodied players, ether you are one of those people or you never seen them hiding during SBQ fights, the encrypted event, Radiation Rumble and so on. They are quite common and easy to spot as unlike AFKers they move.
---
All the ones I spoke to about it are too intimidated that they avoid combat dispute that they could kill anything that attacks them no problem. 
---
So if you actually do play blooded normally than I dunno why you took offense. Unless you needed a reason to stroke your ego...
---
At least it looks like "infinite health" bug seems to be fixed. Previously when using bloodied auto Tesla sooner or later server will glitch and all the mobs become immune to all damage (kill able only via vats). After the patch that bug is not triggering like for 2 long playing days with tons of events, so I am at least happy that Tesla is back to business and melts packs of mobs. 
---
However on shotguns rubber banding is still real for sure, you either kill mobs from one hit or they don't register damage at all which is annoying. 
---
BTW I submitted Tesla infinite health bug and jetpack glitch when wastelanders landed and hell - it was fixed patch later! Coincidence or not...
---
I find if you price them at about 250-299 clownshoes don't touch them (although once someone did come and buy 70 of my serums at 299.. but that was once).
---
I just hit 13
---
Serendipity is indeed good, yes.
---
Scout armor is pretty lightweight for how much protection it offers. I'm fairly certain it was classed as light in the PTS too, for legendary perk purposes. I run mainly scout armor on my non-bloodied character because I like the protection it offers, its low weight, its looks and the convenience of simply buying the mods for caps.
---
And hey, if Vanguard/Bolstering works for you, who am I to gainsay your setup? All I'm pointing out is that mathematically, using Cavalier (because you say you sprint a lot) and the mob-type specific legendary effects is bound to offer better protection overall than a combination of Vanguard/Bolstering.
---
Lol I'm going to stop on Capt cosmos skin which is 95 I think
---
you should throw strange in numbers in there too... maximise your egghead / herbivore gains etc
---
Agreed. You'd think the one who dropped the nuke would get a chance. Such hasn't been the case lately.
---
Thanks for the information youve shared with other players op. I'll be taking some of your advice mixing it with my current play and fine tuning my xp grind tomorrow. I'm at 18 myself on the board but I'd like to create a little path map to grind some XP from hoards. Great post thanks for sharing.
---
They could have the first day being 10 atoms and the last being 70 atoms and it will reset after that. Only 280 atoms a week but we will be getting atoms from the legendary run.
---
Don‘t buy levels early. Buy them in the final days of the season. Earlier ranks are easier to get then later ones.
---
Junkies is an extra 50% damage, twoshot is an extra ~8% on a shotgun. Junkies is also better in vats where it is more accurate and does massive damage from a bug.
---
Ok thank you :)
---
Power fantasy RPG, not Fallout
---
Yeah, I was thinking about dropping them to 10% but I'm not really looking forward to going through all of them again, especially with the interface lag you get after having it open for .3 nanoseconds.
---
&gt; It’s not a crime to voice disliking new grindy content.
---
I didn't say that. I just don't understand, if you dislike grinding and it's actually wearing you out, why on earth you'd keep playing this game and not just go do something else that's fun?
---
He is a Melee boy he needs the Queen to land
---
I used to sell them all for 200 each and had to stop because of cap limits
---
Suffering with success
---
Afternoon :)  You guys are a few hours ahead, but if that's ok with you for evenings and and mainly weekend?
---
Hit 18 tonight. I had one of the most insane XP grinds... SBQ (4 people popped pails for 100% XP) I launched an encrypted after. Radiation rumble popped off right (I nailed down about 30k worth of XP from the hoards). Immediately went to project paradise and another sbq... Absolutely mind blowing amount of XP (I stack int and had a full team). Some of the most fun I've had in this game!
---
Took a SB down to 10% health health stayed 10 till my next shot it bounced up again??? My gauss shotgun gives health it does not taketh.
---
12 is definitely not behind you're doing great. It's day three of ten weeks long!
---
Exactly how I play.
---
You don't need to know what the burrows are for anything the LR. I only found about it last week
---
It’s similar, but game pass lets you download all games so not streaming. I enjoy that I have zero barrier to entry for the games and by the end when they leave if I’m still playing it I have the chance to buy at a discount. However I haven’t done this yet... I just move on
---
Many 3rd party games have also debuted right on there which have been a pleasant surprise.
---
10k isn't that hard to get since everyone's using xp boosts and farming events
---
Omg I though it was me on Alt Tesla rifle only aims at other players...super frustrating during sbq
---
That's a pretty big percentage. Don't forget there will still be alot of people not working rn.
---
I might be selling my FCs for too cheap. I usually put 60 on full ones, 35 on 50%, and throw anything below 50% in the trash.
---
I only sell full ones, and they sell well at 75.
---
The little ticks of 3 damage with my gatling gun I bring to destroy turrets in the silo just doesn't cut it out there at the queen lol.
---
That’s the link to Bethesda, there isn’t a much about it since it’s coming late in the year. We’ll hear more when it hits the PTS at some point late in the year. 
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/CIO182qn66xKBXx84CG06/2020-roadmap-free-week-76-seasons-and-more
---
Do you want them to also generate while your offline?
---
I find it very prominent with the “Charred Scorched” or whatever it’s called, usually Lvl62 and burnt to a crisp, and “Scorched Champion”. 
---
Very annoying, because you think you’ve killed them and next of all they fly at you at about 120KMph.
---
I’m not necessarily worn out from grinding. I’m just starting to get irritated with the fact that I can’t seem to find the last freaking piece of T-45 power armor I need to complete my first set.
---
Every place I go to already seems like it’s been taken or just isn’t there, and when I did find a single chassis with T-45 on it it had pieces I already had.
---
I don’t see how other players managed to collect full suits of their own, much less *multiple*.
---
What platform do you play on? I'm on Xbox. If we're on the same platform, I'll definitely bump the price up a little
---
Good guy Jeff!
---
No no no, you’re not doing that! I’m buying them and marking them up!
---
One time I sold a note called best plan ever for 6969 caps and some poor sucker bought it
---
Yeah I usually hide in bushes too, but last night I had an interesting encounter. I came across two guys in a match that were in power Armor, I figured there were armed to the teeth. So I tried to avoid them while sneaking through Morgantown streets, had no choice because that’s where the circle was heading. I thought I was toast because there was no way of avoiding them without them seeing me, so I gave up and waved at them. I kid you not they came over and started emoting with me, we crouched down and worked our way into the next 2 circles together. They both got annihilated while I hid in a hedge. I took one of their guns and 1v1’d the last guy. Unfortunately only got second place because my aim was garbage. But it’s moments like that, which make the game funny at times.
---
excellent, glad it worked out
---
I miss the building system in Fallout 4 , it’s such a good idea you can built a settlement with your people and take care of them, defend them , gather food , rescue’em from kidnappers , take quest form’em .. REALLY MISSED THIS on 76
---
The burrows is in harpers ferry, but for some reason its inaccessible right now.
---
Or even just a behemoth carrying a surface to air launcher haha that would be terrifying
---
Lmao good hustle
---
sometimes the damage cannot be undone... the ghoul got you good
---
it's bugged,
---
you can actually get rewards from HALLOWEEN2019 and CHRISTMAS2019 (but not SURVIVORS)
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer\_rank#Rewards](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer_rank#Rewards) 
---
And you get both for the same xp rank.
---
example:  Earn 3500 Overseer XP : you get  [Jack o' lantern paint (combat armor)](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Jack_o%27lantern_paint) AND  [Nuclear Winter beanie](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Skiing_outfit).
---
I don't think I've ever had a crippled limb in 76. Used to happen all the time in fo4. Maybe I've just been really lucky.
---
I agree Bethesda should have fixed this long ago, but I read on these forums that getting rid of the healing factor mutation stops it from happening.
---
I decided to switch around my mutations for patch 20 and decided to not reapply healing mutation just to test it. I haven’t had the fast travel bug happen once since then. Totally worth it so far.
---
I guess if it increases your int then it would give you an xp increase for everything.  Can't imagine there's a way to code it to only affect building.  
---
Grab a few friends and test it
---
Yes. More intelligence gives more XP. If you're just running around killing stuff Building is probably the best setting.
---
Why just regional bosses? Every event should have a boss!
---
Every point in Intelligence raises your XP gain by 2%.  So yes you will gain more.
---
That would be a more useful bonus for say, Westtek. 
---
While I think if you are event hopping obviously it might be more worthwhile to have the 100% event xp bonus, unless of course it's something like Line in the Sand or even Uranium Fever where you may get a ton more xp from killing mobs.
---
Again I haven't done the math but that's just my guess.
---
I'm gonna claim them all just to see if anyone would care
---
Hold down start in world and join a public team, it’s actually really awesome. You can share perks with each other and get huge xp boosts
---
Just to maybe avoid mistakes: it does not help if you move the camp module higher up if you alreday put it down somewhere, must be done in the initial camp moving/placing step. It helps to have marsupial and/or a jetpack to reach a point with enough space below it, like a tree or power pylon.
---
In public teams menu thats just the name for it 'Building Team' like the others are called 'Exploration', 'Events','Casual','Roleplay' etc....
---
Hah, that’s hilarious. I’ve got another one where it’s a small room with nothing but toilets and oil lamps and I shove all my mines into it, lol. Got to make an actual base soon though. Toilets and oil lamps won’t cut it forever.
---
What system do you play on?
---
Thanks I gonna try sticking to a 4 person team to maximize my XP.
---
I don't think that'd really be necessary given how quickly the resource extractors get full. It's not like you'd be missing out on much if they didn't work while the server wasn't running and I'm not really sure how it'd produce stuff with the server offline unless it just calculated how much time it should take to fill up from the last time you logged in.
---
Reminds me of the vending machine for the fo4 mod modern firearms.  Loved that thing.  I agree with you... but would never happen unfortunately.
---
now, I am imagining melee players jumping with jetpack, desperate to hit the dying queen...
---
They said they’re going to rework it, not idea what that might entail or a date when it’ll be implemented
---
Shame Pumpkin Pie doesn't give us +80 health or there being a consumable with veggies giving us +carry weight.
---
Thanks. im a more of a run around the map killing stuff guy then doing events so the all around XP for killing stuff seems better.
---
Its good since its a magic legendary effect. Just use a few Fomula P to make the spread tight like Sabrina Nicole and you're set. Idk if they fixed the magic legendary effects but worth a try.
---
It doesn't even need to be a legendary perk though, once you've unlocked "X"amount of rank 1,2 and 3 locks you can always do then without a perk card... We've already earned it so how about rewarding is for playing the game rather than slowing gameplay down! 
---
This could be applied to all perk cards - set a number of the "things related to the card" and once you've hit that target with that particular card you've "learnt"it or something.
---
I can see that, but bethesda added the battle pass, which would have been a good thing if we didnt have to LOGIN EVERY FUCKING DAY
---
Talked about within the last 24hrs
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hjx33l/int_vs_experience_gain_confirmed_yet_again/
---
In a solo team (oxymoron!) you'll get little benefit from +1 Int so joining an existing team may be more beneficial than starting your own. Also don't forget to share perk cards to get more team boosts.
---
Contemporary and Log Cabin bundle are very worth it IMO. Then the Green Thumb bundle with the Asbestos roof if you want it. Other than that maybe the Vault Tec one currently in the shop for cheap, maybe.
---
Arrivals has been fun so far. I’ve had a break from D2 since the beginning of the last season so the break my have something to do with my enjoyment. 
---
I’d like to say I’d come back to 76 in September but who am I kidding? Beyond Light will most likely draw all my attention so I’m pretty committed to another 6 months of D2 at this point.
---
Yep, im on xbox one and it does it too. Ive given up fast traveling because of the lag/crashes etc.
---
All my plans are free except for backpack mods, fixer plans, and a few other weird ones.
---
7 I think
---
My entire inventory on one of my characters was stripped in the end of May.  That was not was not December.      Before that in March everything in my stash was emptied somehow.  Sooooo fuuuuuuck youuuu.
---
I pretty sure leaving the server and spawning back in near by respawns all the enemies so you could do it for hours spawning back in to XP farm or legendary farm
---
Who thought a Bethesda game would designed like a mobile game lmao
---
Thanks! Thats what I needed to see.
---
Anyone else having trouble understanding this?
---
I'll I see on this post is "Me mememe mememe mememe mememe mememe me me meme" - talk about self importance! 🤣
---
But seriously people here do have a tendency to want Their Version of Fallout prioritised in development, and to have Their Minor issues at the top of the list.
---
I just see it will be the norm to introduction for any new faction , Responders&gt; Rebuilding Flatwoods , Enclave expanded to other locations outside of the bunker in the whitespring resort , etc .. , it’s a good idea to rebuild Appalachia with human npc’s + make more community engagement
---
Having three food items that increase melee by 25% each (with strange in numbers active) is just ridiculous and I love it. Actually hunt for food with the Herbivore/Carnivore buff.
---
Yeah that’s what I wanted it for :)
---
Since you cannot give a reasonable answer to what I said, and are just attacking my intelligence you have nothing more to offer to this discussion.  Thank you for nothing.
---
Another "avid-player" who descends into the depths of personally attacking someone who disagree with something on their favorite game that they no-life.  No surprises here.

Level 76 and just did my first today aswell from sure Charlie however I had a friend with me. I decided to nuke white springs and I got rings of great XP and materials for flux and I was very happy
---
Oh yes I forgot broiled brains! Thanks!
---
And the perk that raises intelligence at night.
---
I am at level 13 now, and I've done all of the dailies and weeklies that have been available, so that's 17 extra levels from the XP repeatable alone, which is like, what, some 700 thousand XP gained? In, uhh, three days?
---
Nice job.
---
Praise the sun...I mean Atom !
---
I hear you. I love my CAMP and as I said I do alright but where I am also happens to be where every beginner throws down their starter CAMP as well as being a popular area in its own right so it becomes a challenge getting my CAMP to spawn. having to retry loading in every session gets old. So as much as itll break my heart Im going to have to move soon. I have a spot picked out (2 x actually) but its a matter of psyching myself into actually doing it
---
Fed76 is a good way for price checking. I use it now and again for trades and it helps me to estimate the value of the trade etc. Very useful and I recommend it.
---
What’s your secret??
---
Or baity titles...ahemm
---
If you play for long enough you'll need  to caps sink into something.
---
Who’s Sabrina nicole
---
You can open them while in a match, just find a spot to hide and then open your Pip Boy and go to perk load out. Open them all and be ready for the next match.
---
Nice eye, Patch 22 will be the end of community challenge which will be a CHARLIE we all did BRAVO &amp; ALPHA in patch 21 by then
---
Happens. Also for some quick advice, if you stop by the farm just south of town, you can grab some boiled water, razorgrain, and corn. You'll need it to make the nukashine. The nuclear material will be provided in the locked room through the quest. Also, just use the brewing station and fermenter in the room where Biv is, no need to find someone who already has them.
---
I did this once.. without meaning to. 
---
Ages ago my batteries on my controller went while I was shopping.  So I had to put them on charge for a bit.  My power button on my console also didn't work properly...old xbox
---
So,  I was literally stuck looking at the vendors stock and couldn't do anything until my batteries charged.
---
Yes, pretty much. I will also sacrifice one nuke to find out how stuff works when you're on your own in a private world - this time I had company.
---
Also - **don't log off / log back in too close to the zone you want to spawn in** ... I watched a pretty recent vid from angry turtle about spawn mechanics, and what he found out that you load into the game as level 1, so you would trigger low level spawns! Always travel away, relog, then travel back...

And the movie got it from the book by the same title! We did it!
---
For some reason anyone who says the grind is bullshit and impossible to casually finish w/o spending money gets attacked on this thread.
---
Lots of unemployed no-lifers trolling on Reddit I guess.
---
Soon your extra 600/month ontop of unemployment will end.  Get back to work, parasites.
---
The lag was really bad. Had the game crash in the cranberry bog when I went into that little foresty bit. Game crashed on fast travel etc. Its rough atm :/
---
it should say scrap all junk at the bottom. when you enter workbench to scrap. 
---
IF the junk is in your stash you need to take it out to scrap
---
unfortunately, the repeatable is a weekly so it probably doesnt get boosted :(
---
Well with it costing 100k EXP in order to get 1000 SCORE I’d say it is pretty damn impossible for those that have life responsibilities.
---
Just to add, can confirm the canned meat stew doubles under carnivore
---
Everyone who says leveling fast is easy has:
---
Bloodied build, have all the unyielding needed armor with +1 int on it, and be Herb mutant, eat all proper soups/buffs/drugs and be in a 4 man fully bonded team for the extra +4int.
---
"iTs EaSy To GiT 600 eXp PeR kIlL"
---
Its different for everyone, never feel ashamed of being burnt out
---
I did a month long gold and rep grind in May and then went back to my true grind game Destiny, i looked over the score rewards and what i really want is the Sheepsquatch plush, so my goal is that atm
---
Just ask if your sanity is worth the items you want from the pass lol
---
I do 50 on SBQ Head and 34 on body when hidden or in caution.. Crits are in the 80s.. It‘s a basic stealth non auto rifle build with prime Receiver on a Zealot / Explo Assault Rifle.
---
I refuse to pay that much for a single plan as it would just be easier and less frustrating to buy the roll you need.armor but  As I finally bought the fixer awhile ago and only got one fixer drop since I got the plan, and that was once doing the parade, and not the best roll but I will take ignore 50% armor but prefer it to either be bloodied or have both.I don't need a god roll though so I can wait it out or hope to get lucky and get a bloodied for a fair price.
---
On PC it's "T". Approach the workbench and press "R" then "T." There are prompts at the bottom of the screen.
---
If you have any they’ll be in the Misc tab as Treasury notes
---
Syringer should do that
---
Do you mean it does or it could be a mod
---
Fascinating, I didn't know that, I will try not to obsess and see what happens next time this happens.
---
Thanks for the tip 👍
---
I know this will sound weird, but I always share maxed out Cannibal perk. Its strangly.....useful xD
---
I feel this 100%. I put a ton of hours into this game in the last month, grinding out my build, getting the perfect C.A.M.P. Location, grinding out the main and cool side quests. Cashed in my first bit of bullion for the Secret Service Chest, and immediately after getting 10 bad rolls the game started to feel so stale. I logged back on today for the first time in a couple weeks and saw a 3 active teams not really doing anything at all. They were all at their respective bases. I get I could've server hopped a bit to find a more active world but it really didn't seem all that appealing to me sadly.
---
That’s a heartbreaker. I had that experience at my last site. But I think I’d take that over 0 foot traffic. 
---
Lol, “psyching yourself up” That’s hilarious but so relatable! Hah.
---
Came here to say that. Fine job.
---
Should be a mod
---
Yeah that would be nice instead of people just getting rid of their syringer they would use them more
---
Very true.
---
Can you still move people with hammers and gauntlets?
---
I sell most of my plans at 10 caps, the ones easy to find I throw in free as I know even if someone takes them all to be a dick, they won't get much for them if anything.
---
If I'm low on caps though and the plan is popular I will go up to 25, but even the rare stuff I usually max out at [50. ](https://50.It)[It](https://50.It)'s why I don't why there is even a cap on Caps because I have a hard time selling most things unless it's popular ammo or good roll/god roll or really rare.
---
Even meds like rads and stuff usually don't move unless I sell them cheap and at that point, I'm better off selling to a vendor unless I reached the cap on it. Usually, I have to get lucky and someone who is about to hit up a nuke zone comes by and buys rad supplies and whatnot.
---
I never understood the cap limit, but the cap on sale price as I find two people usually exist in this game, the broke as hell or the the swimming in caps.99% of the time I have to buy random crap or overpriced crap just to free up caps to sell stuff.There is a reason most are either loaded or dirt poor, but in the end, if you long enough you will be filthy rich. because you won't have anything to spend it on.
---
Your welcome
---
The perk packs in NW don’t have anything to do with your perks in the normal game? So if I open a pack it doesn’t take away a point from my character in game? Sorry probably a really silly question.
---
What we got 5-6 right now? Make it 10 and we should be good with a steady 2k plus weekly challenge it be fine..
---
It prob too late for any changes to the new system so prob next season
---
Treetops also spawns either 3 snally or mega sloth
---
There's an infinite amount of caps in the game. Whatever you spend, will eventually be made back one way or another in the game. Spend away.
---
I love chair
---
Doesn’t fortnite have a premium season pass? Lol
---
bethseda gatta  make money somehow they can’t give alway everything lmao
---
I’ve also had the same lack of S.C.O.R.E. On the weekly destroy robots and gather building supply tasks. Let’s hope Bethesda fixes this one because it’s annoying as hell to finish a task and get nothing for it.
---
Syringer should be utilized more. Should be able to buff and heal your team. I'm thinking kinda like Ana in overwatch. So you can play a proper healing class with all sorts of buffs. 
---
Make ammo a stimpack mixed with a boosting drug of some kind. Maybe normal shots heal for a small amount with some regen and crits also give the target  the benefit of whatver booster was mixed with the stimpack for 10 seconds or something. 
---
I'm thinking kinda like Ana in overwatch. So you can play a proper healing class with all sorts of buffs. 
---
And to make sure you wouldn't miss out on rewards you'd get a percentage of the damage to the target credited to you.
---
the scrap all junk button is greyed out and the junk is in my inventory.
---
Why do you care so much? Just shut your mouth and play your video games if you love it so much. We complain because we care about the game, and many of us are long time fans and hate to see Bethesda screwing around like they are.
---
I know! 30 seconds! And having to push buttons!
---
Sure, things like that are annoying. But the anger level you are describing? I think you should give your reactions some consideration and put things into perspective.
---
Why are you downvoting him? He is right!
---
How has the theme changed? I see the setting, but the core theme has always been the same since Fallout 1.
---
I just want a opossum pet
---
These were being suggested from the very early days of the game and i'm just baffled why they still don't have a central hub yet. Fasnacht showed that people love getting together and chilling, showing off their outfits and trading. Top of the world should only be accessible as a hub once you've finished the rose quest line and the wastelander quest line and it should be instanced. Wasted game area.
---
Give me the specs. I could probably judge...
---
talk to my wife who is sitting in the same room working from home.
---
pc?
---
All control vaults contained a g.e.c.k, just not all g.e.c.k's within those vaults were legit devices.
---
Most were shoddy knockoffs because creating a true g.e.c.k device was complicated and cost too much to produce
---
Here comes another camp with 100's of the same plan in the vendor.
---
some junk items cannot be auto scrapped, they have to be manually scrapped by switching over to the Junk tab and scrapping them from there.
---
I realised this around level 30 when another player started trying to bump me out of the way. I hadn’t even been there that long, I was just looking at the plans!
---
Have you done the math?
---
Yhea
---
Maybe not only people who complete the quest it would be nice just for people of all levels to be their that would make it so instead of just having a select few up there the whole sever could be up their trading having fun and just generally enjoying the wasteland
---
It was called Mischief Night. You go to the whitsrping and fuck shit up. Blow up cars, kills bots,paint on walls, trick or treat at the cottages, etc. it’s just really fun pure chaos. You also get double objective points and a higher chance at good rewards if you wear a Halloween costume.
---
 Out of all the events it’s definitely my favorite.
---
you must have already scrapped it then. if it says things scrap, loose, raw then it's already scrapped. if it's things like toy truck, bag of cement, pre-war money.. actual items then it hasn't scrapped and you have a problem.
---
There's the paid season pass that costs $10. There's also the free pass that gives you 20 rewards. All of the weekly challenges are available for both free and paid battle pass owners until they finish them or until the season ends. 
---
They've already quartered the amount of Atoms you can earn, so they need to put more stuff in the Atom shop that people actually want to buy if they want to make more money.
---
Probably not
---
We have a profile on fo76? How do we access that?
---
The Halloween event was a lot of fun but super goddamn laggy.  
---
It was called Mischief Night, took place at the Whitesprings Resort. We had an eyebot named JES-2R that would lead the whole thing after you lit the bonfire to start it. It was best to show up with some form of costume on (witch, skeleton, etc, etc). The eyebot would lead us through the grounds and you'd have different objectives to complete while they told a story.  
---
It'd be like, sow mayhem in the park, along the cottages, and the courtyard. You'd light bonfires, kill robots, blow up cars, graffiti the walls, place forks on the lawn??, and trick-or-treat (sometimes you'd get candy, other times you'd get a landmine blowing up in your face). It was CHAOS. Then at the end, you'd light a big ass bonfire and kill the Whitesprings elite security force (protectors, assaultrons, and a single sentry bot). It was a lot of fun! And the rewards were nice (I ended up giving away my pirate costume, but I kept my pumpkin shorts one).
---
No one of the "Bethesda Replied" people on here confirmed it would be separate still. 
---
Rightly so.
---
go HAM and open them. you're not gonna get banned if you open them. Just don't bother listing the plans in the vendor. 
---
You can get caps from the presents so watch your cap limit.
---
I think carnivore is the big winner here. I pretty much don't have to sacrifice any of my usual food buffs and now most are doubled. They have made food amazing.
---
SAM launcher as a Behemoth Hat.
---
Whichever suits you.. It has diminishing returns after 1* but 5* is still worthwhile if your build has the room for them. You should always have at least 1* regardless of build tho
---
My camp is between wayward and slocum joes. All recipes are 1cap (but mostly i just put them in the overseers cache nearby), all camp related stuff (decorations, structures &amp; workbenches) 5c, all armor plans 10caps (except marine / combat armor / high level stuff, but never more than 99c), basic PA plans 20 (except headlight modifications, those are 99c and only interesting for those who can afford it anyway). 
---
General rule: if it is useful for low levels it is offered cheap, if it is catered for mid level &amp; above it is 99max. 
---
When i find outfits i consider nice i stock them for 9caps, for example drifter (the best looking OF imo), scavenger or surveyor outfits. Gas masks again are 1 cap cause everyone needs one at a point for progressing ingame.
---
If i have more than 100 ballistic fibre in my inentory i craft modded raider underarmor and sell for 39c. It is dirt cheap considered it's benefits (+agi &amp; +per) and cost (ballistic fibre), but they sit for a long time in my vendor. Customers don't read the descriptions nowadays and just don't realise what they are looking at.
---
For a second you feel relief, but then the game is like nahhhh
---
Yeah, there are some incredible people.    
---
So....  what ended up working for you on that quest?
---
I highly recommend getting any of the skins for your drop/death loot bags. While I still think the best was the bright blue present box, it’s not currently available.
---
Changing it from a paper bag is worth the atoms.
---
ive noticed the healing factor mutation very slowly heals limb damage pre-patch 20, unsure about after patch 20
---
3.
---
Yup. I’m at 3.
---
I opened 200 and the presents deleted themselves. Message saying "This Item cannot be consumed and will be destroyed"
---
Yeah I can see how it can be done for sure. I can see a full time worker with family struggling, but fair enough you can’t cater the game to everyone.
---
But then it doesn't work as you need that area for two of the quests. That's why it should be in there after those 2 quest lines are done or at least the part at the beginning of wastelanders where you meet someone there. 
---
it would just be instanced so if someone who hasn't met those requirements goes there they'd not b able to access the hub
---
And some (looking at you stable fluxes and certain toys and quest items I’ve picked up) can’t be scrapped at all.
---
WTF
---
never heard of that happening
---
I didn’t think about that your right then
---
Can i enter there second time?
---
20 SS chests rolled so far. 0 unyeilding.    
---
    
---
There is only RNG hell. No weighting.
---
The problem with that is,every boss they add ends up having the same loot pool as a random legendary found mucking about in the world. I mean outside the Fixer for Sheep boss,and well there are repair kits for the queen, and the only reason I pretty much bother with her.
---
You can add all the cool bosses you want. but if their loot pool isn't going to match the effort and time put in, then I'm not going to bother with it much. I don't need to get good rewards every time, but I at least like to feel my efforts mean something other than just personal gloating.
---
It would be nice if the big bosses at least dropped 2\* or better. I mean I can go to Uranium Fever and spend about 10 minutes or so and have 3 cracks at legendary and 3 chances at good loot vs the one for the Queen, beyond and pray I don't get the respawn bug or freeze because it can't handle all the shooting.
---
Why an end game boss is pure RNG is beyound me,they could at least have a low chance to drop Unique gear piece/s if they are going to pretty much have the same loot pool as any other legendary I might as well farm the tunnels under Harper's Ferry[. ](https://fairy.You)[You](https://fairy.You) usually get 2-3 legends each run and a ton of mats,and the same chance at RNG. 
---
First, the loot pools need to be dealt with,otherwise adding more bosses is pointless if nobody really bothers with them.  I rarely get people to show up for the Sheep event but drop a nuke for the Queen and in most cases more then enough show up,and if not I can at least farm flux.
---
🏴‍☠️PIRATE 🏴‍☠️COSTUME🏴‍☠️
---
Prepare to be disappointed
---
This is really the way to go for ranks - double or triple xp help a ton.
---
I would say it is worth playing now though for the Halloween and Christmas rewards.
---
I used to do the NW dailies (unless obscene) for the perk cards, but now only get the rank up cards bc they swapped it for SCORE. Luckily I have a build out I am happy with, but will make getting the alternative cards I want a bit harder :(
---
Oh man I agree
---
Found a camp like that tonight, had a bunch of plans I didnt know for 0-5caps a piece. It was like christmas.
---
I've been tempted to try and find all my serums again so I can try this out. It's just a pain to find them sometimes.
---
Well, the core of the seasons, the legendary run, is basically the reskinned version of the same Daily/Weekly challenge system we already had, but it gives fix rewards instead of atoms. And that's it.
---
Crossplay is my biggest hope besides the optimization of the performance. Have friends who playing on XBOX, PS4 and myself on PC. Would be amazing, if we could play together.
---
100% for me, I’m now motivated to get on do events kill shit, and just have fun.
---
If you hold the back button it’ll exist the converter entirely
---
Ive launched my first nuke on my early 60's, with help of a friend of course. Then launched 3 more from there on solo hehe, its easy just need to have patience to run thru it.
---
I've found with my bloodied shotgun I can vats enemies one hit dead but other times if I vats the health goes down and the normal enemy will get health back and it takes longer to kill them so annoying
---
lets hope that the series menu will not result in such a clustermess like the ammo converter...
---
okay maybe your right. I checked and it says things like loose screws, scrap wood, scrap glass, nuclear waste, aluminum scrap, etc. So from here, I would want to unload it into my CAMP inventory or does it get unloaded in the workbench?
---
It will be reworked but who says it will be how we want it 🤔
---
This is a wonderful display of integrity and compassion! I started a community of people doing just this, with our own lore and traditions. We are over 1.5k players on all platforms and around the world. I started it over a year ago with just 29 members to start. If interested pm. We'd love to have more wonderful people such as yourself
---
It does make things confusing for sure, I hope they can patch this asap, I don't want to have to count my SCORE every time to make sure it got properly awarded :)
---
I got it on launch, got really bored during the Rose quest  and stopped playing for over a year. My friend just got me back into it 2 months ago. It's a much better game now than it was then. I even made a 2nd character to replay the game when i feel bored on my finished account.
---
Yeah it is a little confusing, hope they patch this soon :)
---
i did see this kind of error every now and then since a few weeks...
---
I've had this for a while now (again).  Very frustrating when trying to clear enemies and you have nowhere to run to get away.  Waste of ammo, stimpacks, and time
---
You need to find a stash box. either go to your camp or find a red rocket. or another players camp.
---
Was it on xbox? And were the plans priced at 500 caps?
---
Yes it does. Did it on my own on my private server the other day. Camp, leave server, back to server, back to nuke zone, everything is alive again
---
Thank you :) will pm you now
---
I'm not hurting anyone, if a product doesn't meet my standards I can stop using it until it's fixed . I'm not trying to prove my loyalty, I pay , I choose.
---
Fairly common drop from meat weak.  Have 2 in my stash and I've sold/dropped quite a few more.
---
Generally, if you've got a bunch of stuff we're after (5mm/50cal/308 and fusion cores) on sale at 1cap or a reasonable price for the cores? we'll clean you out in a heart beat.  
---
Even now with the ammo converter, alot of us are bulk buying even 44 and 38 because we can turn it into ammo we need. We'll often drop a little something as thanks for helping lower our already grindy end level existence xD  
---
I drop power armor, based on the persons level, because.. well; everyone at some point could use a set. Low levels for tougher zones/getting started, mid levels as a stop gap or because they have trouble finding/building full sets. I always make sure to have some full 50 sets of T51 because it's the best ballistic n energy protection really until they can get hold of their ultracite or T65 sorted.  
---
Plus; it's Nuka Cola painted! who doesn't love Nuka xD  
---
Usually drop them a couple bottles of that, to &gt;.&gt; at one point I had nearly 600 bottles of Cola/Cherry/Quantum/Cranberry combined xD
---
I try to sell cheap, but sometines that attracts resellers who will flip it foe more then you're selling. I try to raise my prices just enough to discourage resellers.
---
And having hackers and invented guns like laser broadsiders on ps4? No thanks
---
Most sought after mutation. You'll have not problem earning your caps back.
---
You might be missing out on some good weapons.   I'm level 237 and only keep 1 - 4 very good weapons in my vending because my stash is full.   I scrip every weapon that isn't outstanding one way or another.
---
Doesn't work for anyone.  It's been plastered on this sub all week since the patch came out.
---
It was a fun game.
---
I played with my rl friends a bit before they dropped out, had some adventures running through the caves killing scorchbeasts and helping a bud launch a nuke and kill the Queen.
---
Don’t think it should get the hate it does. 
---
The only bad part to me about Vanilla was how the story was told without you in it, really.
---
Even harder to digest the content when playing with others. 
---
Currently slowly through Wastelanders content now to regain my 100% trophy rate in the FO available on PS3/4. I already feel torn on grinding and I don’t have the dailies for the factions - just the SCORE system and the NW old rewards pull me away from that focus. Not going to be fun grinding Rep and notes. 
---
They have surely been slowly improving the game - will say I think the party system should have been available at launch to more easily be able to partake in some of the harder content, so glad they finally got around to it.
---
IMO the two biggest things that still bug me other than grinds is the fact that you don’t get discounted for items in bundles if you already have some of the items in them and how the perk cards work. If I have one maxxed I should be able to pick how many stars of that card I want to use for build options. Scrapping the extras for legendary ones doesn’t address this or clean it up and the lack of load outs is annoying.
---
this.
---
If they have plans at low prices, ammo going for 1cap n plasma/fusions at reasonable rates, 1-3 star armors/guns not set to stupid high prices? I'll buy what I need, and sometimes what I don't just to help them alone; depending on their level x3  
---
If the shop belongs to some lvl 487.. chances are he may not need my extra caps as much as the lvl 43 next door x3;
---
Right? When I started my new char some high level player had done the same for me and I decided that I'll forward the favor for other players. Having to put them at a price kinda takes away that from the newest players.
---
Yeah, same here.   In fact, I have to take down my vending regularly because of the 30K cap.  I'm in the same area.
---
Ok thanks for quick reply let’s hope the hit fix it soon!
---
It's gotten worse lately imo
---
Yhea, anything unlocked is free game to the world. If you'd locked it, even as a lvl 1 and they picked it; then it's theft.  
---
I set up a few purifiers myself so people walking by or shopping can grab a couple bottles.  
---
I've been debating planting some crops near by, to. Even if it's just Tato's'; it saves you using your dogfood or stash of Cram for a while xD
---
So I take : 
---
Poseidon Energy (including Fusion Core plant)
---
Lakeside Cabins
---
Berkeley Springs
---
Dolly Sods
---
Converted Ammunitin Factory
---
I drop a resource on all the lead deposits and then I just cycle through them as then need work or help. Farm 5.56 or 5mm at the Ammo Factory and I stay pretty busy with that, although I'll usually ignore a workshop until it's stats is Retake because waiting fo waves? Ain't no one got time for that.
---
14 also
---
You can still find Jes-2r chilling at Freddy fears, randomly saying crap that startles me every damn time because I always forget they he is there.
---
It wasn't me, but nice to know someone else is out there spreading some Nuka love!
---
Is the 10000xp one the only one that we can keep doing after we finish all the dailies (&amp; weeklies)?
---
Is there no other way to get SCORE?
---
GTA online is a literal money printing machine. Rockstar focuses so much of their own resources only in this stupid title that every other game of them  gets ignored.
---
It absolutely it. Kind of fun too. I'm not a pvp guy at all. I'm old, have bad eyes, slow reflexes and I make bad decisions so I don't fair well in most pvp situations. I wanted the ghillie suit a while back so I forced myself to play NW and ended up really enjoying it. I tried to play for real on teams but it didn't work out very well. I was always the first to go down and it was pretty frustrating. Then I embraced the ways of the bush wookie and everything changed. Trying to stick to the shadows and out of sight for as long as possible while chasing the circle across the map is a lot more fun than I expected. it's like a Metal Gear or Socom game with real people taking the place of the NPC enemies.
---
Also use new cranberry nuka cola, which gives +2% exp or +6% with cola nut perk.
---
Same same. Waited for an existing group to free up a spot and joined that team. Had a ball!
---
13 😅 guess i have some catching up to do
---
That's what I'm hoping for.  I had 5 spare points to play with at least.  Had never used the sneak multiplier perks at all before.  Actually pretty good alternative for the time being if you aren't already using them.
---
Sneak attacks hit for basically the same damage they would with fully charged adrenaline, even higher at night.
---
Generally? I sell 'normal' plans from 25-50 caps (depending how arsed I can be to go through all the sliders)  
---
Stuff that's a little 'rarer' I tend to sell a touch higher; Jetpack plans for instance normally go for 200.  
---
They tend to sell pretty quickly. Ammo; 1 cap a round. fusion cores I used to price as 1cap per 2% charge (70% charge; 35cap ext) Plasma cores at 10cap. Vendor was empty each day.
---
All my plans are priced at 11 caps each, no matter what plan they are.
---
Correct
---
Can you enter there second time? I have some tokens...

That's the message you get when you try and use something that would put you over the weight limit
---
Wow great tip I’ll try that out thanks 👍
---
Or put another elavator next to the other one which would go underground their would be no explanation to it except rose would say David covered up to his stuff cause he was paranoid and the wall came down which wouldn’t make sense but that part could be change
---
To be fair, I'm getting score from random, I don't know what, things so no idea 🤷‍♂️
---
I’m trying to balance taking advantage of the NW rewards and get through wastelanders story/trophies. If I am not getting the daily score questing I feel a bit let down bc it pulls me in even more directions and I miss out on progression.
---
I just coped with the fact I’m probably only going to get to like the first space wallpaper. Would have liked to get the firefly lights and the chicken coop 😐
---
Finished encrypted and no credit given. 0/0 cryptics killed.
---
13 I think. Whichever is the flat wood bow skin.
---
yeah. i’ve gotten score from scorched earth once but i just did one again and got nothing. it seems really random.
---
Assuming you have level ups to waste anyways.  I had 90 something unused levels so didn't really matter to me.  If not might want to hold off possibly and just use cards you already have.
---
Bethesda acknowledged the issue so with any luck there may be a hotfix on Tuesday...I hope.
---
where can I find the ammo converter? do you need a plan and if so where can I find that plan?
---
Do you play in 3rd person? I had the same problem but it was fixed when I went into first and tried again
---
Yes I’ve a similar number of spare levels so I will experiment thanks
---
Yeah it is easy
---
Can i have some? Lol, lvl 78 started 3 weeks ago :p
---
Mostly 3rd. I have one character stuck in PA but switching to another seems to fix it. I'll have to give that a try. Been doing a lot of Nuclear Winter and PvP so I mainly use 3rd person. Didn't seem to happen until today. Thanks for the advice.
---
It’s probably from the repeatable weekly, you get 100 score every 10,000 xp you get. And with the public teams it’s double xp if you’re on an event team with full bonds
---
welcome to the club! level 325 here and haven't launched a nuke myself
---
Upvoted for use of clownshoe.
---
This sucks, but imagine this bug and a VATS build, which is also broken, stacked on top of each other.
---
Not sure if this is impressive or sad
---
And reading the article on Bethesda.net, Todd Howard seems to be the Bethesda connect. And, for some reason, I think he’s going to end up as a cameo at some point. BRING ON THE DEATHCLAWS!
---
Let’s hope not!!
---
Tasty squirrel stew doubles for carnivore.
---
Appointment gaming sucks all around. There are better ways to limit progression than with daily or weekly limits, but these game companies screw over the majority of their population trying to control the obsessive habits of a minority of their players.
---
No matter how well written it is or isn’t, if it doesn’t follow the Fallout lore to a tee it ain’t gonna be worth the watch in my opinion. 
---
I’d like to say I’d be able to still enjoy it for what it is if it is good and not following the lore, but I don’t think I would be.
---
I read coronavirus mutation. Fml.
---
I sell all plans for 25 caps each. jet pack plan, 25 caps. My 1000th mole miner gauntlet plan, 25 caps.
---
I adopted the same business model as dollar tree
---
19k score you'll miss is you don't do any of the NW dailies. You'd be around Lvl 94 if you did everything else (not including the repeatable). 
---
So You'd need to do the repeatable 190 times. Which seems high, but don't forget they're doing double score weekends (at least one confirmed in July).
---
That is why it's not sarcasm on reddit unless you /s.  (/s)
---
Is The Fixer good then, I picked one up somehow, think it was the parade.
---
Do plans stay in the cache if you log out?
---
Decontamination is useful if you are not bloodied and helpful for full health builds. I disagree that the robot should be unlocked. I payed 500 atoms for it and will not unlock it. It is the best robot imo since it literally finds soup which is a pretty good source of food.
---
I bought the Winter Icicle lights and the mounted Mothman for 50 caps each from a camp I visited. I do the same. 
---
My plans all sell if I keep them cheap, I think my only exception would be The Fixer once I actually learn the plan myself that is. It never drops as a reward for me.
---
Look straight up and try again.
---
If they take longer than it takes you to kite a mob over to them, you don't have to feel bad about it
---
I got my hopes up because the chose Kilter Films as a partner. With Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy as showrunners / producers this could be a big one... At least the framework is ok.. So it has potential.
---
You're*
---
I loved my first month of FO76 as well. I had a blast, and really felt like Fallout to me. The players running around actually enhanced the experience more than I thought they would. Overall it was a far better experience than the memeing chuckleheads would have you believe.
---
Then came legendary grind, and the bullion grind, and the bugs crippled my build, and now the Season grind has begun.
---
I know video game developers have nearly perfected how to keep people playing games long after they are actually fun, but that grind shit doesn't work on me, so I'll be playing something else until they figure out a more interesting way to get me to play again, or add actual content to the game.
---
But, yeah, for a month it was pretty damn enjoyable.
---
Yeah outfits were decent.  I kept most of them
---
Probably 8
---
I don’t want the plushie.... I need it
---
Yes it works on weapons.
---
Nice. Think I'll go change my prices then. Don't really care that much about the caps, but there are some plans I've had for over a year now that I don't mind freeing up some space with. And yes, I know I can drop them off somewhere for someone to find them, but I do care about the caps just enough that I'd rather sell them.
---
But it’s not your soup. It’s OUR soup
---
porn star
---
Juicy
---
Finally, someone with the guts to help.
---
I, like many others, have a water farm going. I know I’m gonna hit the cap limit every day, so why price gouge? Everything at my camp is 50 caps or less, most ammo for 1 cap, and the rest (40mm, Missiles, .38, .50 cal balls) for 0. Not only is this helpful for newer players, but it clears up my inventory space pretty much daily.
---
How many atoms does it cost to advance a score level?
---
Tbh that's why I don't use my shotgun much, I 1 shit everything in V.A.Ts but hardy anything out side. I don't have any V.A.Ts perks either.
---
Or one of the unused vaults
---
“Kill x amount of flatwoods monsters”
---
I think this is one of these things that will never get fixed. Have they ever talked about it since launched? I am not aware.
---
It's been suggested by the community that the existing vending machines scattered about should be using the pre-war money as currency, not caps.
---
The Ammo converter should be re-worked as an Ammo Scrapper workbench, give you raw materials to then craft into other ammo as normal.
---
Are you illiterate? It literally says in the post that I have the week off.
---
Yeah I'm about to reach that one
---
No. Pc gamepass players will play with other pc players. Xbox players will continue to play with other Xbox players.
---
At Rank 17. Grinded around 250k XP per day since the season start. I have not much choice as I have to grind at least 100k XP per day to level up once; that's 1000 score points extra.
---
At 5, haven't played last couple of days. Seriously don't give a flying F about this ranking &amp; seasons. Anything I get from it is a bonus, none of it is vital.
---
Rank 13.
---
I would be higher but my rcd is is tripping killing my wall sockets so little gaming atm, and also no fish tank electrics so thank goodness it's summer!.
---
It just means OP is carrying over 1400 lb. needs to drop some weight.
---
This.
---
If they added a different nuke boss for each zone they could have each one drop a certain kind of flux. Instead of people doing a few SBQs to get a shower they would need to either make it themselves or do each boss.
---
The grind isn’t bullshit, stay mad.
---
I think you're ignoring the fact 90% of the players at Fasnacht wouldn't have been there if there wasn't an event with limited time rewards. They weren't there to hang out, they were there for masks and plans.
---
People suggest a player hub all the time but unless they pull people from various servers and fill an instanced lobby it would be a pointless addition. Think about it. There's only 24 people to a server. How many servers do you think you'll find more than 2-3 people just looking to chill and not do anything with some random players or get together for in person trading? You might get lucky and find one with more, but the fact is the servers have too small a player base for a player hub like that to make sense, especially when players already have their camps which function as ad-hoc hubs anyway.
---
It might be cool if they did pull people into a special lobby for goofing around and trading, but that seems like a huge effort to implement for a very small payoff. I think the dev team is better off focusing on adding content that is easier to implement, especially considering how overwhelmed they already appear to be. Do you really think it's worth their time to divert so much effort to a player hub when they can barely get simpler content that's been planned out the door and working properly?
---
Lol, forgot about this, checked back and ... 26 downvotes... not bad
---
Is it possible to build crafing benches inside of the play structure? I want to live in it
---
Yea, always. For NW, I don’t really play It and never had that bug for the limited amount of times I tried it. Sorry.
---
Do you have adamentium skeleton perk? That gets rid of it.
---
Nope, the NW stuff is a waste of time.
---
My camp is litterally pissing  me off due to this as I add one support I can't get rid of it. Add a stair on I have to make "another access point" when the goddamm foundation is at most 2cm above the ground. Just because it is floating according to the camp system.
---
The amount of restrictions is kind of ridiculous and needs to be reworked for stuff like that.
---
[This](https://imgur.com/a/Y31t91V) is what happened to the last guy who camped there. He used to have laser turrets before this photo.
---
Don't have to feed them if you'll sacrifice them to Atom.
---
I used to be angry and frustrated too.
---
Make that positive change in your life. It's better for you mentally and physically.
---
No secret, just lots of patience, food buffs, and ammo.
---
No never used that perk.  
---
Why did I get down voted?
---
I've noticed it happening more on my melee character power attacking. The dmg numbers show but dont register.
---
For real this is the best advice
---
Do you join any teams for the xp boost?
---
If you don’t submit a ticket you can’t really complain.
---
I mean it would be even better if it filled the lobby from other servers
---
There isn’t a single cryptid there... is this a joke?
---
Lucky hole mine is great for that. Scrap guns for steel. Tanagra town for acid. Best of luck!
---
You probably got credit at 3/5 and didn’t notice
---
Reposting what I said below.
---
Think of it like this: You can easily spread out the time I spent out over ten weeks to make up for any missed challenges.
---
saw a level 80 clear out my whole plan stock, most were beginner plans at like 5 caps a piece. took me weeks to get all those. I even have my camp real close to the overseer camp
---
Yeah, Herbivore was good because Glowing Fungus Soup was a good source of water and food with rad resistance. But when you strip away the bones not a lot of good choices in veggies. Its harder to cook good meat though.
---
If it doesn’t yet exist, I propose the Wookie‘s Creed. 
---
Article 1: Thou shalt not fire upon a naked man hiding in a bush or diving in rad polluted waters.
---
Meat week coming soon.
---
Burnout from any subject just normal thing. Take a break until you recover.
---
Couldn’t tell you since I didn’t downvote but my guess would be because crippled limbs is super common without that perk or without decent armor, especially early on when you’re just running around in a vault suit
---
It's the best rifle in the game
---
Yes, and each cryptid should have it's own boss battle 
---
So far we have
---
- SBQ
---
- Sheepsquatch (via encryted) 
---
- In August we get the Wendigo Colossus 
---
Still missing 
---
- Giant Sloth
---
- Mothman
---
- Grafton Monster
---
I maxed out on caps from a couple vendor sales last night... went shopping and found this guy had a single roll of toilet paper for 30k (a covid joke I'm guessing) so I asked how many caps he had. As soon as he said 6k I proceeded to buy that glorious roll and made his day. Was it worth it? You bet your clean ass it was 😉
---
Most of us don't we leave them for the newbs to use.
---
It just takes too long for the return to be worth it.
---
Yes. Join a “building” team if you can because of the INT boost they give. Otherwise just join any team available so you get a boost from the inspirational perk.
---
Happy days! Hope I didn't sell for scrips..
---
Afaik: they should stay in the container, even if you log out. It's like the dumped stuff near train stations you find sometimes. The overseers cache has a standard inventory for each player (purified water, ammo, food,etc.), but the added stuff by players should also appear to any player accessing it. It ofc vanishes once a player decides to pick the added items up.
---
What is clownshoe lol
---
I was going to try and grind, but then I noticed I would have to put waaayyy more time into it. It is the equivalent of working another job that goes into overtime and no breaks. Each and every day. Nah fuck that.
---
I'm never excited to grind.
---
I'm excited when I get the payoffs from grinding, but the grind itself isn't especially fun after the first time around
---
It’s all up to personal preference. Collectron is more of just a fun camp item than being “useful”. Bundles are all cosmetic.
---
 Hmm.  I do use power armour on my character.  Maybe that's why.  
---
So I get down voted cause I just got lucky? That sucks.  Lol.
---
Does that count in nuke zones though? Aren’t they always max level in that case
---
I feel the same. Thats why I, time to time, go back to my chill play style, optimize my camp, organize my junk, and chase some annoying challenges like "cook this, cook that, scrap that, repair this weapon, kill a robot with an assaultron blade etc". Visit other players, especially lower levels and buy anything that isnt madly expensive or totally useless.. Make new friends, drop some junk or show how i do stuff.  
---
BTW, if we only do the bare minimum dailies and weeklies, (NO NW crap) will we able to reach to the end and get eeverything?
---
*cries in a Life of Brian reference going unnoticed*
---
Halfway through 14. The “grind” is evident as I did weeklies etc all on first day, but I’m also not hardcore playing constantly so it’s not too bad. 
---
Weekend double and the event score changes will help a lot, and I’m planning to get ahead with it so I can take days/time off later.
---
Bossing should have been like how it was in runescape.
---
I didn't play around last Halloween, so I missed out on the Nuclear Winter rewards at the time (which I saw talked about a lot)... I honestly don't remember hearing about a Halloween Adventure mode event. Now I want it to be October so Mischief Night can come back; didn't realize I was missing so many plans! Thanks for the breakdown of what the event is.
---
Just be warned, the SS-Torso breaks weightless.
---
@Bethesdagamestudios
---
PLEASE TODD!
---
You won’t get crippled in power armor ever
---
The mole miner gauntlet is really a weird plan because you can get like 10 of them when you do the Uranium Fever.
---
Even without the int bonus from unyielding, you’re still going to make a lot of progress on the board just from killing stuff.
---
No soup for you!
---
I managed to contact support, don't get your hopes up, they can't edit your SCORE, so any amount you lost is just that, lost.  
---
I wish they could give out a few free atoms for those affected or something.
---
They already have an idle timeout but idk if it kicks in while in a trade
---
The Fixer is great for stealth builds. The plan is acquired as a potential drop from the Encryptid event. Soooo many players don't know how to effectively complete said event therefore they will spend 7000 caps or more to get the plan.
---
The plan allows you to craft regular variants (that only have the stealth bonus) but also allows for legendary variants to drop from the purveyor. These variants are highly sought after as they have the stealth bonus as well as (potentially) three legendary effects.
---
I sell most of my plans -50 caps of the value. People are greedy, man.
---
Good news! There has been progress https://imgur.com/a/LxxaKUc
---
T-45? I feel like thats pretty common, no ? Wait, we can craft the PA can we not?
---
Dunno if it was you buying all my plans yesterday evening. But its pretty much the only reason I've got a vending machine. So that people can have plans they are missing for 10 caps
---
There is plenty of time to both rebuild and die / ghoulify.
---
FO76 starts 2102
---
Great Winter happens in 2030
---
FO1 starts 2161
---
So we have 28 years to rebuild, suffer a nuclear winter (from constantly nuking the Whitespring probably) and 30 more years after that before we catch up with the timeline.
---
I can imagine the nuclear winter being a big reset button on any rebuilding.
---
14.
---
I started a new character so I’m ranking up fairly easily
---
Remember before the release when they teased us with the grafton monster? No one gives a shit about him, even though he was a main thing in the first reveal trailer.
---
You beat me to it! LMAO
---
start a new character, the update was basically a low level player QoL update
---
0 atoms. They’re only selling cosmetic items in the atomic shop, remember............
---
Yeah I'm a heavy build and I find it especially bad with the gatling plasma
---
I stopped doing that because changing PA caused a bug for the chassis to lose all its defense values.
---
Truly the game shuts down all avenues to use gauss minigun.
---
NEXT!
---
Doesn't help when solo on a private world, does it? I assumed like everything else it all resets
---
No, that promotion has long since been over.
---
Mine too, liked the chaos, liked the fact that for fucking once I was able to get all the rewards :-)
---
Man, that was hilarious. You should try stand up.
---
Sitting at 13/100, at about 750 SCORE towards Rank 14. Haven't gone nuts with experience grinding, but I've gotten a decent amount of the repeatable challenge done (9 times, by my count).
---
So many opportunities. Tbh I’m just angry they have the gun models for the Service Rifle/AR-10 but they refuse to add in different rifle models.
---
Rewards are account wide, except for the lunchboxes, supply crates, bullion and cap rewards.
---
On another note, what's the deal with no longer being to build at a teammate's camp while in NW? Bug or intended?
---
My friend's and I would love to build defensive bases in NW but only one person can build now.
---
Well I think they've said they would never sell Perk Packs but this is a way for them to bend the rules.
---
Some people don't have 2 hours a night, every night. And if they do, they might not want to spend it all on one game, every night, for the next 10 weeks.
---
Would love to see cross-character in this game. I own F76 on PC and X0, it would be dope to level up one character across both platforms.
---
I was at an event and then I FT’ed back to my camp, which is next to a pond. I had the option to Drink the player that I had last seen at the event.
---
Has anyone else noticed the nerf/bug of no longer being able to build at a teammate's base in NW?
---
Sad day for me and my friends wacky camp building together 😓
---
Exactly my  thoughts. Burrows is a MUST go place, really good XP source. of course its a preference, and even tho I went to Harpers Ferry many many times, I actually didnt think you could get in those manhole covers LOL waaaay until i discovered every region except the bog. But i think i legit set foot on every location on the map at least few times, without any quests. IN fact, i didnt even goto overseers holotapes up until I fully explored Forest, As heap, and toxic valley.
---
Remember how you would build something huge and wonderful in Morrowind and it would ruin your save? This is why they don't implement that sort of freedom in Fallout 76, being completely server-side and all.
---
Ok nice thought i have to play through 2 times
---
I sell at 20% value, no matter the plan.
---
Nope. Now i have a reason to log in and do random stuff.
---
150
---
I'm about that life
---
The best way to give unwanted plans to lowlevels is to drop them right in front of their feet. 
---
Im way to lazy to put them into my vendors one at a time...
---
Its probably got something to do with anti-cheat. Server side health bars so it doesn't matter your ping, the server has to say "ok that's a valid amount of damage" before it goes down.
---
Just my theory
---
is it really? Here I lazily sit at my camp after completing bare minimum daily and weeklies.
---
I tend to sell CAMP items at 9 (to avoid kickbacks to the server) and items/weapons at 15.
---
After reaching level 90, I got bored. The same quests,  there's nothing I find stimulating about the game anymore. I probably came to that conclusion faster with all the bugs, and the fact I have to pay £12 a month to store all my virtual junk. 
---
I enjoyed the game initially, but what's the point even trying to get good guns when everything is nurfed. I have an exploding 3 star shotgun and I don't see the hype at all, it still takes two shots to kill level one enemies. 
---
I know it's a trading game, but it does more action to be stimulating enough to play it. Maybe add a horde/survival mission, more main quests would be nice.
---
The game feels rushed and a gimmick for profit, they don't deserve their fanbase with the tiny amount of effort they input. And Fallout 1st is laughable.
---
This is why I don’t do much camp building
---
Lol tbh I’ve seen a few hacked weapons and other than being cool looking most people sparsely use them do to everyone being toxic about people who use them.
---
Had one for a bit but would only use it on the SBQ fight. Would use it once everyone had gotten hits on her, was just tryna speed up the fight and save everyone ammo. Didn’t have bad intentions with the gun, just tryna help out.
---
You can just use atoms. That’s why it’s a grind they want you to either play a lot to get it all for free or pay atoms.
---
Ahhh, great, good to know.  I was actually wondering about that.
---
in terms of cryptids you are also missing flatwoods monster and snallygaster there...
---
Wastelanders really shaped up the game to be decent I still wish there was more to do hopefully the brotherhood coming adds something
---
And im so proud of u!
---
 "**Seasons is a decent FREE addition"** no we lose 3000 atoms per 3months, wierd conception of free addition...
---
"**thanks**" ahahahahaahahahhaaaaa.
---
If the doors are unlocked you can have a look, just remember to close the door on your way out.
---
Its like Christmas in July
---
Wow I didn't know, thanks for the link
---
It would only work if only between Xbox and ps4
---
Same! Never fired a shot before, and pray to Atom that I’ll never have to (looking at you, legendary run dailies)!
---
If I had to guess I'd say it's because of the way the points work. Maybe in you have points stored up someone else could spend them? I have not tested it, just the only reason I can think why it would be an option
---
Do whatever you want in someones camp. if they don't want you inside they will lock the door.  If there's a water purifier and it's unlocked it usually means you can help yourself. If there's an extractor though and it's unlocked i don't take the stuff in it. It's a weird rule i have. 
---
Oh and if they have crops. Don't take everything. They probably wont mind if you take like 3 or 4 things if they have 10 planted. 
---
if you scrap the things they've built they're gone for good. If you store them or move camp they will stay.
---
I found a level 10 guy and gave him all my plans it was like 50 different ones.  I know the feeling of someone gifting stuff to me and it was good to know they would be used and were valuable to him.
---
You’re allowed to go into people houses and do stuff in it :) and yes, they are your items now
---
You're not really missing out, it's just mostly mounted head plans, a bottle of booze and a toy
---
Canned Meat Stew only gives 5%.
---
What is a magic weapon?
---
I have a 'workshop base' blueprint that I can slap down with a building I can hide in and basic base facilities, generators for the resource extractors a balcony I can take up defensive positions on and turrets to help deal with the waves.
---
...that's just, like, your opinion, man.
---
The Wendigo Colossus in a Colossal Problem is going to be a special more tough version then the kind you can randomly find on the world map.
---
What ammo are you converting...... Big list of all ammo, what ammo do you want....... Big list of ammo leaving off ammo you already selected..... Simples. Keep it simple stupid.
---
They’ve also sold ya know Repair Kits and Scrap Kits in the Atomic Shop regardless if we get them free they promised Cosmetic.
---
Could just be a visual bug
---
16
---
I don't think you lose the world right away, had multiple disconnects from server when solo and even when we both got disconnected, jumped back in right away and were on the same server, same world. Even the workshop I had claimed at that time was still mine (munitions factory) after like 2 min internet outage. I think it can be hit or miss but you don't lose your world right away. 
---
There's a limit, something like 10+ mins, when the world really shuts down or gets recycled to another 1st player. Another time, after claiming powerplant workshop, right after powering up the power plant I got disconnected and could not get in for like 15mins+ (internet trouble), and sure enough, workshop gone, power plant powered down.
---
See when I use my op weapon I always make sure people get there hits in before hand before I start blasting
---
[https://imgur.com/a/l61IS2v](https://imgur.com/a/l61IS2v)
---
So first: Most players are really happy to see other players in their camps. A lot of them spent hour to built it like it is and want people to see their work. If someone doesn't want others inside he would just lock the door. So look around as long as you want!
---
Second: as far as I know those items are yours. I've built a fusion generator in my boyfriends camp when he started and he moved several times. It was just Stored like the rest of his camp.
---
I hope I could help you.
---
Go into NW with a new character. You'll hit rank 2 after 1 match.
---
well there's a reason why the OP specifically made this thread about 1st private worlds though. The map would quickly become cluttered, and it would be near impossible to find a server where you could place all your settlements down
---
Meat week item. Rewards will prob come back but we won’t know yet unless data mining has already showed 2020 rewards
---
It's nice to help out new players. If I see a low-level player I'll always make sure to throw them some extra Rad-X, RadAway, Stimpaks and purified water. Sometimes they're visibly happy, jumping on the spot, crouching and sending me the heart emote. It's adorable
---
I got my J/25/25 Fixer, a B/BE/25 Fixer, a full set of secret service unyielding/AP/Weapon, Ammo, Meds, Junk weight reduction armor (thx to duping xD).
---
I already won that freaking game.
---
What we need is some real hard events/dungeons like vault 94. The only real hard thing to do in this game is encrypted solo...
---
I'm not sure if you have to set it up beforehand but if you hit share you might be able to save 30m gameplay video that you could attach to a bug report.
---
There was someone on here suggesting there's a short cooldown timer, in case they were in quick succession.
---
Tbh my camp was fine and worked and could remove a foundation attached but with patch 20 something changed subtly making the foundation i made floating. But it most likely because i built in a pre built area under a picnic table gazebo in the wilderness.
---
Yeah, according to one of the posts on here there is a minigun that fires explosive bait too, on PC anyway.
---
The stuff they left was pretty cool so I'll keep it for sure!  How do you lock the door?  Thanks for the advice!
---
I’m already at lvl 30 so there is no reason u can’t reach the end in 10 weeks
---
Sadly, a well known fact.
---
Ugh. I'm extremely disappointed this is still a thing with Update 20.
---
It only started to happen to me in the past week or so. Makes me go crazy, did i just dream clicking on fast travel ?
---
Cheers, sadly opportunity is long gone. I got to the 10k about once every 45 minutes, roughly.
---
It’s just a camp item. Build as many as you want. It’s just a reskinned small generator.
---
It's the torso that gives you more Ore, not the arms.
---
You talking about the old dailies/weeklies right?
---
Quadruple, not double.
---
as opposed to figuratively finding soup? as in that well known expression 'gonna go find me some soup'.
---
13 myself. Someone posted yesterday that they were on 30 after grinding xp for 10hrs a day.
---
Even at zero caps people are taking 40mm and missiles? Wow doc, that's *heavy*.
---
Sometimes art imitates life y'know?
---
Thanks, that's useful to know!  I made a blueprint of my shack so that if I have to move it I can rebuild the same thing in the new location.  It's only a basic one but I'm pretty sure I will do more complicated structures later... I sunk so many hours into Fallout 4 settlement building it's not funny, lol
---
Oh my dear god!
---
Only 4 characters? I've had to start filling up characters on my 2nd account!
---
Yes
---
I believe you can find plans for each piece of armor for every set, yes. I'm just having shitty luck I guess.
---
 I've been going to Point Pleasant, Wade Airport, Nuka Cola Plant, Poseidon Energy Plant, Morgantown Trainyard, Grafton Dam, Black Bear Lodge, Aaronholt Homestead and the Silva Homestead (all places that can spawn T-series Power Armor), and can't find anything but empty stations or chassis. 
---
I've even been trying to server hop to see if I can get lucky but I don't even know if that works anymore. I've only had FO76 for about a week or so.
---
Thank you. Some people are catalyst for freaking out.
---
When you are in build mode hover over your door and it'll say lock on the bottom bar. 
---
This will only mean someone will have to pick the lock to open it though. And the consequences for doing so are very minor. But it deters most people.
---
The legendary run is just a poor idea of Todd and his crew to keep people playing the game and purchase Atoms of course.
---
But I know I’d u have Xbox game pass for pc u can play fallout 76 on that on the 9th and your progress carries over apart from atoms and fallout 1st
---
17
---
thank you :)
---
Aye, and just switch the team to *Events* when you're doing an Event. Switch back to *Building* once finished. Best of both worlds!
---
Having an issue with the ammo convertor from the legendary run, when try to use it I end up looking at the middle of the machine, not the computer monitor. On ps4. Have scrapped it server hopped nothing fixes it.
---
Yep. I cant dip in and out anymore, I don't intend on making fo76 a job so I cancelled the auto renewing of fo1st. Wont be logging in anymore. Kinda sad as the fun was great, but I don't want to feel pressured into playing.
---
Honestly, this is the first I've seen of it in action.
---
After the player got a message from my nephew asking nicely to stop, they messaged him back then blocked him 🤦🏻‍♀️
---
i didnt know that was an option until i read this
---
Better yet, JUST place the damn thing, who cares! What are we gonna go, place 100 stash boxes halfway inside each other? we are already 10 miles away from any major location, Nothing snaps together that supposed to snap, We dont have vertical half walls, quarter walls, or decen windows or roofs or even decent stairs.
---
I've been asked this by friends who have Forest camps. My theory is that there is an assumption that Forest area vendors will likely be low level. As there is no way to know if the weapons are Legendary or if the armour is actually armour, I generally don't travel to the vendor unless I'm "passing nearby".
---
Every time I see people begging for PC/Console cross play for a game, I feel conflicted over their blissful ignorance of that which they ask to release upon themselves.
---
pvp is pretty much a opt in, as for soloing quests you can pretty much do every thing except end game by your self ie. vault raid and queen fight
---
It sucks.
---
This is pretty much the only thing that gets us all together as a family as we don't get to see each other often (especially since the lockdown), I'd hate for that to be ruined in my nephew's eyes.
---
It’s not hard to keep getting the 100 score for hitting 10k xp ... take 4 people in glassed cavern ... or continuously drop queen nukes
---
Im pretty sure when the person decided to have this, "you cant remove that, other parts need it have access/support" was legit high on gasoline fumes.
---
Cross platform consoles yes
---
Not with PC (although I know some pretty awesome PC players and would love to hang out with them in game)
---
I usually sell all the plans I find around 0-5 caps just to help others and I love when I find someone do the same thing.   
---
I also put pink flamingos on sale for 1k caps as a joke, and my friend bought it, because he thought that's something rare and special. Now we make fun of him and we usualy hide some of those on his camp as a joke.
---
I’d like it if your build on a workshop is saved and when you log off it all disappears ect and someone else takes the workshop. Then when you come back on and take over the same workshop it remembers what you had built and it all spawns in again. It would make building in workshops viable and would actually vitalise the PVP side as well.
---
I need to join your team! Any slots free? Haha
---
In the beginning, there was a reason to build up the workshops.  You would build them up to protect the Bench so that other players couldn't take the Workshop from you.  That all changed when the Whiners attacked.  They thought it was 'Unfair' that you could actually defend the Workshops.  And thus Bethesda enabled being able to take a workshop so long as you are inside the boundary...  And thus the entire drive to take them died.  Why?  Because you could now exploit them to kill Pacifist players without becoming wanted.
---
Personally, I would prefer an entirely persistent private Server.  It will be required for Mods anyway, assuming we get them before Bethesda EOL Fallout 76...
---
The shear number of locations in the game where you could realistically place a settlement is staggering.  Instead, 1 small camp per person at a set distance from each other...
---
These are great ideas, think you could make some for brotherhood of steel and aome more for settlers?
---
Are you on PC. I could see if i can craft it or keep pieces for you.  
---
When i was on PC i was chasing T-60s like you and 1 leg or arm piece took me FOREVER to find.
---
Okay I'm glad it's not just me, I completed 2 of them for 1000 S.C.O.R.E, got nothing. I am so mad!
---
820 hour player here. There is A LOT to explore in this game. Large map, 6 distinct regions, plenty of lore, lots of quests. 
---
If you liked FO4 mechanics you should like this game. It is less linear also. 
---
I play 80% solo. It’s fun solo and with others. I’ve met a lot of players in game that I’ve played with.
---
This is bethesda, they'll find a way to squeeze it in
---
It gives so much to reinforce a good gaming experience! I think it's what keeps this cumminity such a loving and caring one
---
What's wrong with fast travel? I've never had an issue with it.
---
Yep. I do these for everygame I play and im on BoS rn. Thanks!
---
Lol I’ll be grinding glassed cavern tonight on Xbox feel free to add me and we can make a 4 man team ... the veins can be hit by everyone once all 4 go in and 1 stays 3 come out n back then the one that stayed hits it n comes out n back in ... once it’s all set all 4 hit the vein at once and about 40-60 scorched attack lol it’s crazy and fun as hell to watch n we get about 500 score an hour total
---
Gt this my yard
---
It would give a clear gameplay advantage for atoms... something they said they won’t do. Maybe I’m just being optimistic. This would cross the line though.
---
Holy shit, yeah I'm joining you there! What do you mean by veins being hit btw?
---
It's bugged but the opposite way.  It unlocks when 3/5 objectives are completed.  So you already got it.
---
I think what he’s referring to is that sometimes when you click where you want to go it simply just doesn’t register and it’s like you can’t even fast travel. 
---
For me opening and closing the map 3-4 times will solve it tho.
---
I get that bug all the time too, it only happens really if your a bloodied build because when your health is low the fast travel is buggy as hell
---
Thanks! I'll check it out.  I'm not too worried though - I'm only level 15 so I have nothing to steal, lol. XD
---
Yes it’s possible. Don’t listen to bad math and people ignoring other ways to get score. People are already at level 40 without exploits.
---
all items that are non-consumable or currencies (excluding atoms) are account bound, so if you unlock a skin it is linked by the atomic shop to all characters. Caps, Scrip, Gold and one time use items are sent to the character you last played on when claimed.
---
Inside glassed cavern there r 2 ultracite veins ... 2 pick the vein while the other 2 stay in pick off the scorch that spawn
---
**YES**
---
Well dam you have been grinding XP because I’ve done all my daily’s and weekly and I’m no where near that
---
Ah right I see, yeah I'm down for that, just dropped you an add and a message so you know it's me
---
They just need to make it simple. Every 50 levels you can make 1 rank of a perk card passive and doesn't take up a perk slot. Gives people flexibility with their builds.
---
The 2 that picked the vein leave the cavern n come right back inside .... the other 2 leave come back and the veins will be constant for all 4 people and then everyone picks the vein and a swarm of 40-60 scorch come at every one
---
Yeah, I'm on PC. Specifically on the Steam version though. I'm currently level 31, and I had found more T-51b pieces before I was even able to equip T-45, lol.
---
Also does anyone know if the repeatable XP quest will change after the week?
---
Pls idk what you are tryna say tbh but I clearly said in the post not the OP of the post. Ofc I'm the op and i posted it but another reddit user posted a comment on my post saying that it was bugged and defective. Why you making your brain work too hard?
---
Flatwoods
---
I have never once found gifts in the game anywhere. Not only does the RNG hate me, I even repell dupers.
---
I'm level 12, and Ive done all daylies and weeklies too.
---
I’ll add once I come back online this evening
---
Oh god, another thread for the backslapping ‘I sell plans for 0 caps and a smile!’ brigade.
---
They really need to make a pinned post about this
---
&gt;stly, I either have a sip of my coffee or a sip of my beer depending on the time of day. I realIzed I was doing this unconsciously and was drinking way too fast.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;ReplyGive Awardshar lol, Same over here
---
maybe, maybe not. we will see once it expires in about 5 days
---
I'm enjoying it... I've only just started playing but I've played every fallout game since the first one and I was hesitant to get Fallout 76 because I enjoy the quests and the solo play.  However from what I've seen there's plenty to do in the game quest-wise and lots to explore, a lot of content and events you can solo easily. Don't expect there to be a main storyline that's in depth, but there are people you can talk to and quests you can do.  As I said I only just started playing so I didn't realise that the NPCs are fairly new...  I'm glad I waited until now to buy the game and I hope they continue to add more AI  content!
---
Lol, I have the same "problem"
---
Its more like a sarcastic meme meme version 😜 i dont take myself regarding a game too serious 😂
---
You know for a fact that won’t change anything
---
I really hope it does not, double XP with this would be so good
---
Broken record, but Angry Turtle is great for in depth explanations and overall gameplay. His streaming videos are fairly entertaining as well. Captainoob and SH Games for builds and weapon demo.
---
But it’s Bethesda so I think it’ll change before the double XP
---
Nice. Im on PC too, I messaged you. Id be happy to help you with that or anything else.
---
Yeah now that sounds like fun haha I'll do my best to follow the instructions!
---
Very nice thanks!
---
No gamepass is simply a tool for downloading and installing titles.
---
Months back it started supporting pc in doing the same.
---
any horde event. Don't kill horde boss and more enemies spawn.
---
I love seeing people with plushies smashing through the jet pack, but yes! I agree terrible design, would never happen with 3rd party Fallout 4 skins.
---
Ya I’m not opposed to grouping, played WOW too.
---
It has to help. This is getting a little insane
---
Probably not. Are you over level 50 and does events regularly you will just hit the max and scripts will be wasted anyways. Keep them at 8-900 and spend accordingly so you dont lose but arent full either. Another thing to consider is if you have scripts in the vendor to get rid of unneded items or stash space for them. Timegating is helluva thing...
---
Cool, thank you!
---
I had simple plans like Metal Bed mixed in with my other ultracite stuff and someone bought everything at once
---
Yeah it’s pretty bad for a triple A game, seems unfinished and the iron sites don’t even work too... they are way way way off so I have to use a red dot with a broken reload animation
---
Never was, never is. You'll still be fighting the stash and the scrip-return-limit, and the rngod.
---
Thats how i feel in most posts when i read that mememe text xD, meme is mostly used as term regarding crybabies who make a rant regarding something while they actually cause the problems bythemself. But dont worry im not here to make a rant on these ppl, was more like a ironic sarcastic post to have some fun 😜
---
I do my best to find us 2 more
---
To add to this, if you have a mic use it, even just one person communicating on a team makes a world of difference
---
Psychobuff to get the extra damage boost, rank 1 of the three heavy gunner perks for an extra clean 30% damage boost while only prioritizing 3 cards in strength, Stabilized in Intelligence for an extra 45% armor penetration in power armor, Bloody Mess 3 for an extra 15% damage, Adrenaline 1 for an extra 36% damage (max) whenever you rapidly kill enemies (which is often with heavy weapons) and finally the weapon: Prime Gatling Plasma with at least Bloodied effect.  I do similar damage to the player above, and that's what I run that mainly does it.  The Prime receiver is a must, it not only extends your cores from 250 to 375 shots per core, but with Ammosmith, you have a net gain on core conversion.  I cant remember the conversion off of the top of my head because I legitimately haven't made ammo for my gatling plasma in a month after I made 200 cores, but it's something like 2 regular cores and a yellowcake flux make 3 Ultracite cores.
---
I dunno how people struggle to save these. I'm always hitting the scrip limit, so much so it's become a nuisance.
---
This is one feature I really want them to add, even in a private server I rarely take a workshop because I know I will just lose it when I log off. Back when the game launched I would regularly take the ammo factory because the returns were decent, but when they slowed the amount of ammo it generated its just not really worth the hassle.
---
Welcome to the Wasteland. Legitimate level 400+, hit me up some time and I can share some tips and tricks. Gt Zombietickler86
---
Or at least give atoms are part of the score rewards.
---
I only grinded daily a few hours after work, it got me to SCORE rank 21 so far. At the moment I plan to save all lunchboxes for double XP weekend. Not sure if I should use them now, as its not guranteed that the 10k XP challenge is still there, when double XP weekend is going to start.
---
\-you have an option for NO PVP. so no prob.
---
\-don't pay more than 30(15€$...)
---
\-you can play solo, but it's really really more enjoyable with people.
---
generally introverts play solo -&gt; hit lvl 50-75. &gt; go to team for events / high lvl events.
---
and now you can "auto" team with people, take bonus from the team, and don't talk or mind them.
---
\-if you like fallout4 and all the bugs are "ok" for you, then you can take pleasure with 76.
---
If you get mad everytime you get a bug in fo4 DON'T GO to Fo76.
---
I love it when vats freezes, and won't let you attack, or when using the bow the controls freeze to aiming mode, or how I've noticed that as soon as a combat starts, everything goes out the window, physics-wise, controls-wise, AND graphics-wise. I avoid combat because of these bugs, and it has made me play the game less and less. Thanks for fixing the base game before you start monetizing extra features, Bethesda! You are now losing playerbase, and that is why they stuck you in Game Pass.
---
I don't lock any of my collections. If I'm not at C.A.M.P. to clear it out, go ahead and grab it, I have plenty of junk and scrap. I've got a full farm and some unlocked water purifiers too, help yourself. If you touch my raider ammo thing tho, I'll kill you.
---
They dont want you to finish, they want you to pay to finish while robbing you of 5k atoms in the process.
---
What system would you buy on? Steam?
---
Uranium fever does have 3.....if you you get a chance to hit any of them at least lol.
---
I had the same issue where i was puting stims, rad-x and diferent ammo for 0 caps. I had a big sign stating that this was a donation to low levels
---
 Of course people were ignofing it.
---
What's the deal with The Fixer? I have one I got from a quest a long time ago that's like level 30 with enhanced sneak but that's it, how are people crafting these with all the crazy buffs?
---
Good theory
---
Atom shop skin on item?
---
Blooded is really shitty for power armour tbh, if your junkies you’ll do less damage but u can be a full on power armour tank but power armour is pretty bad atm, needs a massive buff because my full set of secret service UY armour with mods is so overpowered when u use bloodied
---
FYI there have always be NPCs and quest giving NPCs, there just weren’t humans prior to wastelanders. Dialogue trees are also new.
---
Yes. Do all dailies and weeklies. Repeatable xp will do the rest.
---
Of course if you skip a week you're done.
---
vendor full?
---
You are ahead of the average from what I’ve seen and based on benchmarking calcs I’ve done. 
---
I’m only level 9 and that’s on track to finish.
---
I've been getting floater grenades despite not knowing the plans
---
Quick question, how do I lock things in camps. I don't know how two and I've put over 300 hours in
---
Thank you. I noticed yesterday I got some points I had no idea where those were coming from.
---
I am sorry if this has been asked a few times. I tried to find it in the upper posts, but didn't.
---
I'm sure some people would be down for that
---
You can get several hundreds of hours of gameplay just solo exploring / looting.  Not to mention quests, events, crafting, challenges, building, decorating, and more.  This game is gonna keep you busy.  There is also a battle royal mode called nuclear winter if that's your thing.
---
The current build is also pretty stable and smooth.  You will find a bug or two but most are minor.
---
If you get a deal give it a try.  As a fallout fan you won't be disappointed.
---
Most expensive plans I have are the jet packs for 500. Camp plans are about 10-15, grenades and mines are 20, ultracite and weapons are 100 and mods are 10.
---
Sorry, just got my lmg.
---
Im not seeing score as a grind, more a bonus for playing. Im not grinding out to max it out, wherever I get to is ok. Some of the stuff I'd like to get, but if I dont get there, thats ok.
---
I don’t believe it is
---
Limited time to play here,, and I feel the same way. I love this game, but the grind is getting the better of me. I feel as if I don't login to do the dailies I'm never going to succeed.
---
Please read our wiki page on this subject
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning)
---
Nope I still have 20 space left over and I can’t put it in any other vendor either
---
is there enough room in your stash to hold the weight of the weapon?
---
15, but someone was kind enough to share their exp route to freshen up my grind, hoping to hit 25+ this weekend
---
double check, if it has an atom shop skin on it you cannot add it to your vendor for sale. each machine also can only hold 30 unique items, if at max you cannot list anything else in that machine and need to make another
---
Bush life is the only life.  Yes it's boring, but the xp rewards are far greater.
---
Leader of the pack is great for this challenge. Noone ever does it.
---
Yes, I cleared out space just to try and sell it and it just doesn’t respond
---
I love it. I buy up so many plans I know I'll never use or even really heard about if they're at a good price. 20 caps for some shelves I didn't know were in the game and will probably not notice on my CAMP menu anyway? Sign me up!
---
Hemlock Holes for Grafton Monster + 2 snallies
---
&gt;but for some reason its inaccessible right now.
---
it bugs out sometimes, a server hop/relog should clear it up quickly
---
Nope no atom sink and I can’t put it in any other vendor either it’s very weird
---
First two days I fast travelled and ended up somewhere completely different.
---
I went to go back on the beat and ended up with a dozen people just outside a nuke zone shooting a scorchbeast!
---
It’s good 👍 not your fault. It’s on bethesdas end.
---
Wow now insulting people because of their financial decisions
---
On controller, it is LT for Xbox while in modify mode for your camp. I play controller on pc since it is one of those games where it’s mostly pve.
---
It’s literally just this one item I cannot Sell but if I put anything else it goes to the vendor
---
Or hates people's personal creativity in building.
---
Thanks
---
Nah. All ammo has different value and rarity  and it should lose a little bit of value with the conversion. Keep in mind they have the ammo maker and player vending ammo economy to worry about. I agree that the value was waaaay too low for the trade in but 1:1 would make ammo too abundant for everyone.
---
What weapon is it?
---
I was surprised too. No account for inventory space taste, I suppose.
---
Can i join world with you and do some shopping?
---
Yep!

If you have to choose between a "builder" team with low level players and a "non-builder" team with high level players, I usually choose the high level team. Reason behind this are mutations and "Strange in numbers". Low level players often don't have mutations. The perk "Strange in numbers" gives you +2 INT from egg head, +1 INT from herd mentality, +1 INT from herbivore brain fungus soup and +5% XP from herbivore cranberry relish. So its possible that it can outweight the benefits from a "builder" team.
---
Nice thanks for the answer
---
My girlfriend disagrees
---
How is acquired outside of the plan? I have one in inventory that's fairly low level, I think I got it last year at some point from a quest
---
with carnivore, broiled brains does 5, and 7.5 if you have strange in numbers.
---
I got 95% hit in vats with shotgun but it only hits 1 of 4 shots. Hate that bug!
---
I already paid for first for the year and can't get my money back otherwise I would've stopped playing completely already... The grind sucks, I refused to partake in the gold grind and this is way worse. And as a bonus they also removed the only fun feature this game had for endgame too so yeah... 👎 seasons 👎 76

If you’re on pc I can mod an automatic barrel for you. I also got a quad ffr on my alt account too. Went on my main since I had the plan there and got it on my first try. Quick tip, don’t forget super duper when crafting.
---
It happens when you have a health regen effect active. Been this way since launch AFAIK. It's the one thing that makes the Healing Factor mutation not worth it to me. But any kind of food, drink, perk or armor that is giving you health regen can cause it.
---
So to not have this happen, just stop using whatever is always giving you regen. Yeah, it sucks, it's dumb, I know. I guess it isn't high on their priority list of things to fix.
---
If your girlfriend won't let you put thirty hours into a hobby over a period of TWO AND A HALF MONTHS, it might be time to re-evaluate your relationship.
---
It is totally worth it though. And i like that it has a grind. Will give me such a good feeling of accomplishment when i have gotten a full set. I have gotten the Chest piece, jetpack, Right arm, left arm and right leg. just need the left leg now and ill be set.
---
Angry Turtle convinced me that Herd Mentality works even if you're away from your teammates, and will actually trigger even if you're in a team of one. Bit the bullet and bought a serum; can confirm it works as soon as you join/start a public team!
---
Dang, good luck!
---
I sell them for 5/10/20 caps depends on base price. And actually there are some players who do same. less than 500 goes for 5 caps. plan for 3000  goes for 20 caps. I guess it is reasonable.
---
Have you tried logging in and out?
---
If you have an existing steam account linked to Bethesda you may have it. I had FO 4 on steam, and 76 showed up without me doing anything.
---
Are any of them coming up in the challenges menu?
---
I have seen that hypothesis before but honestly... how hard is it to check for 100x the junk requirements? Same thing for super duper, you just roll 100 random numbers then give the player 37x (or whatever) the extra items that were crafted.
---
yeah I got that little baby breaking the sides of my trophy case.
---
Not a lot to show for it. Guess that's my last WC for a while.
---
ok I would like to buy some for my collection.
---
I keep most of mine at 50 caps or less unless it’s one of the actual hard to find plans.
---
I know. I was being sarcastic.
---
Not sure why asking for clarification got downvoted but 👍🏻
---
Do you stay in a server where your camp spot is taken?
---
I can't say I've ever noticed that on XB1 but thanks.
---
Nuka grenades and mines always work I believe. They deal environmental radiation damage.
---
Riding shotgun. This event you can start yourself so don’t need to wait for an event to pop. Server hop it and you usually get more than the 1 legendary enemy in there.
---
Once you learn the plan you can get it as a legendary drop
---
Sure! But I'm on PC and I think you're on PS4. My ign is Hantoniorl.
---
Are you also ok with people 1 shotting the queen and 3* legendrys
---
I have few rules.
---
Don't open doors. Don't thieve from Extractors or Collectron. Don't destroy anything. Don't litter (obviously excluding if you think a plan or item may be useful to me. Nospooled food, drop that in the wasteland). But mostly Do Not Touch Betty the Brahmin or Freddie the Frog, 
---
Oh, and don't sleep on my be. Uninvited guests use the sofa! 
---
I leave my water purifyer unlocked, and you can eat my crops as they refresh quickly.

If you feel the need to build at least make it useful. No rude signs or million punji boards. 
---
And talking of punji boards, when you visit others camps beware of entering through corridors or those suspended up high. Most are innocent design choices but just occasionally a griefer is waiting for unwary souls to prey on.
---
Yep and it didn’t help :/
---
People who lock communist bot are a shame on every known community
---
20 caps for plans. 10 caps for recipes. 100 caps for ultracite plans and jetpacks. Seems fair enough.
---
&gt; Soooo many players don't know how to effectively complete said event therefore they will spend 7000 caps or more to get the plan.
---
Or players with the caps would rather buy it than do the event a silly amount of times with still no plan drop.  Doesn't have anything to do with a players skill whether the plan drops or not.
---
I understand that servers aren't static; if you see a person willing and able to do so, take note of the name.
---
Don't play on a server with that person.
---
At 12/13 I think. I've done all the daily and weekly challenges so far and haven't grinded EXP at all.
---
I'm not sure honestly. Maybe something changed in the past year? I played day 1 and stopped playing after a couple months until just over a month ago...

And if an intern make it: why? It's literally more work for a less convenient interface.

Terminals are terrible, that's a fact, but if you're going to make it a terminal at least have just two tabs: [BUY] and [SELL]. I don't want to sell some [small-caliber-lightweight-stainless-steel ammo] to get points and be able to buy [big-caliber-with-grooves-on-the-side-of-the-bullet-to-increase-inertia-and-air-penetration ammo].
---
Happy cake day btw
---
Not anymore
---
A ridiculous oversized novelty shoe. It's an obscure but funny insult.
---
Oh ok. Is that recent? I haven't played since May.
---
I always do it if I see it but mostly for the fire helmet.
---
Rank 11 currently. So far have been doing all dailies apart from nuclear winter, and have got all but two weeklies done. However I'm not grinding XP too much (averaging one level up per day still) and I'm sure I'm going to miss days, not to mention that I'm still not that familiar with the game so (for example) I almost failed the cryptids challenge yesterday because I didn't know where to reliably find those. So rank 100 may prove too far for me. However, my target is rank 58 which some quick maths suggests I'm well on track to reach (11.5% of the way there).
---
You make probably the best point of any on here. It's really dumb for people to act like they deserve to unlock the most rare and grindy elite items for a medium amount of effort. These L100 items arent something meant for everyone to be running around with in August as participation trophies. 
---
And unlike Fasnacht, if you have the L100 items it proved you actually accomplished something most won't instead of getting lucky.
---
Yeah, you're right... it should be one account for every platform...\\
---
I'm struggling to find good plans. I'm lvl 36 and wear lvl 20 armor, almost no mods.
---
Ya steam
---
Will do ty
---
Exactly. The amount of posts about this is ridiculous.
---
Nice sounds good
---
I spent like 20 minutes building a stair way out of the little dam area my camp is, it's frustrating but boy does it feel good when you cheese it and make it work!
---
Alright I’m sold!
---
Saving mine for legendary modules.
---
Yeah, like the Ark situation. Always broken as fuck yet we all keep going back to it because the same reason. Just recently a lot of people had the creatures and items they spent years on wiped overnight for no good reason when they got stuck in the cloud during a botched game update.
---
There's usually a couple in the Berkley sewers.
---
serious question has someone ever bought a mole miner gauntlet plan from you? they drop so much I can't see someone buying it
---
But they are offering a wondeful deal to buy your ranks with atoms!
---
Just go to the big bend east tunnel and talk to Vinny you can start the quest by yourself  no one else need
---
No, it says when looking at the arms that if both are used, ore harvest is increased. 
---
Inventory description: "Increased mining yield when left and right arms are used in tandem."
---
It's gotten worse since the last patch, it effects every, weapon and enemy type now!
---
It seems like these last few updates have caused more problems with build mode than anything. Floors clip then won't move or even change floor pattern!!! WTH!???!?!!! My camp has been in shambles for weeks because every time i start to get somewhere with it, something else won't go or can't be removed.
---
When I was playing last night it gave me a "new" Halloween reward. So not patched afaik
---
Yeah I hope you like grinding mobs
---
I was having the same problem last night. I think it's Xbox Live playing up.
---
gatling guns are heavy, and if you are wearing an armor piece with weapon weight reduction that can cause some confusion. Check how much it weight without the wwr armor if you are wearing one and free enough space in your stash.
---
Oh there's new 1st stuff coming?
---
Same. I generally aim for either 10 caps or 10% if higher level like spare ultracite plans
---
It is Rank 5 of the new S.C.O.R.E. rewards. You complete daily challenges to get it.
---
I sell mostly plans for 10% of the recommended price.  I’ve only been playing a couple of months and it felt like the simplest way to do it rather than try and try to learn the economy.
---
I have played since Day 1 of beta, without any breaks and more than 3000 hours into the game.  Wastelanders broke me - having to do reputation on 5 characters was a killer, only possible cause of the coronavirus lockdown.  After the rep grind, I quickly dropped down to 2 characters for gold, and now only really care about it on 1.
---
For the past 2 weeks or so I'm down to daily caps, challenges and queen hunting with a group, in between launches I go do gold on the 1 remaining character.  Only reason I'm bothering with season 1 is cause the cosmetics will help fill in gaps...  there's no really nice alternative jet pack skin in the atom store, and the ghille armor paints will help mixed sets look pretty well integrated.
---
I don't care about even trying for a full set of SS armor - the RNG is beyond stupid, I've only managed 1 nice and 1 decent chest piece to run jet packs on 2 characters.
---
Grinding is one thing, grinding and not being able to share unlocks/items between your own characters is just utter stupidity!  Without the ability to trade new items, the RNG is bonkers...  if I roll a nice SS piece that I can use on another character but not the one I rolled it on, I have to scrip it?  That's the stuff only true turd brains can come up with.
---
What Bethesda needs to do is fix duping once and for all - which they can't seem to do.  Instead they come up with this stupid stuff that punishes legit players.  So people care less and spend less time.  When my year of 1st is up (already cancelled the auto renew) that might be the end.
---
Happens to non bloodied as well. Most of the times when I experience it is when I'm in technically in combat and just want to ft away because I'm done in the area but the countdown cancels after like 2 secs
---
really? i must have shit plans then, because I can't even give them away.
---
Everything rubber bands now!
---
We've had nothing good since the ranger armor.
---
The burrows is a waste of a time(if you’re farming exp) best case scenario is 20 ghouls with 1-2 legendaries. Not worth the time it takes to clear it.
---
Omg how didn’t I notice thank you very much
---
Most likely, you will be able to play it but at 720p at low settings with your card. But, I would be more worried about your temperatures playing the game since you are playing in such a small laptop. Gaming laptops are usually bulky since they need extraordinary cooling but your laptop is mostly designed for being sleek and portable.
---
&gt;the competent studio that made Fallout:Brotherhood Of Steel
---
The only one reason I bothered to claim workshop was : I needed those reward plans .  
---
That was the whole point of workshops in game for me.  
---
And as OP said, it has massive potential, but I am afraid that this prehistoric engine cant take it.
---
I have a lit cigar on sale for 30k if anybody wants it!
---
About 30x a day it seems. They’ve acknowledged it. Good news is you should have gotten score at 3/5
---
Hey worry not. At that level is just like that. Once you reach 50 you'll get plenty of plans. Remember to **always** participate in the nukes and any other event you can do without dying too much.
---
I’m stealing your soup.
---
Play most days if I can, even if it's to just do scrip/dailies. 
---
I'm same as you done all Dailies/Weeklies (No NW) and at Step 13.
---
Nope, separate perk systems. NW is tracked separately from Adventure mode.
---
Why does it matter?
---
This. As a build that relys on VATS. It makes the game near unplayable. I've had to take a break from the game coz the bugs are just ruining my experience. Really hope they get ironed out but it won't be on Bethesda priority list.
---
The only thing I will say is PC/steam are prone to hacking sometimes. But a lot of people play with little issue
---
Scorched brain is now 8 int
---
Yep i can. Psn is mcpoyle82
---
Yeah, I didn't know they were bringing more stuff.. We desperately need it
---
OP's weapon doesn't have a *magic* effect though. Plus, Gatling Gun is far too slow, even if it did.
---
If you still need one. I got you 🖤
---
Bruh you don't need to post this every 2.minutes....
---
Thanks for that.
---
Thx I’ll send you a request now
---
You cannot steal everyone's soup comrade.
---
I keep anywhere from 700 on up.  In my mind it's save for a sale, but it's really a stash issue if I play for a few hours.  So, probably not really worth it but required.  I usually buy up to 4 of the 2* ranged a day.    Maybe I'll step up to 3 stars.  That pushes space too because they sell for 40 script.
---
Yeah, the description has always been wrong. Try it with the Torso, you'll get 4x the amount of Ore.
---
Cool gimme 5 mins and I'll join you
---
Most people that hate or bitch about the game have never played ot or played too much of it . 
---
1h and 1000h
---
Thx again
---
This is the first time posting it?
---
Stuff like double xp and SCORE are mainly just incentives to get people to play regardless of whatever is going on in the game currently. Ever notice that most double xp weekends coincide with a free to play weekend?
---
Also stuff like double xp and SCORE aren't fully necessary to complete the season but they are really nice for those of us who can't complete every single daily challange because of things like work or holidays.
---
If you log out, Then log RIGHT back in, they will have reset. I usually do the run of the circle, relog ,repeat about 7-10x. Beware that if your logged out over a minute or so, the nuke zone disappears.
---
And they're silent! And you can stack them!!
---
Completely... It was okay when I knew I could take a day off and be okay, but now with the season you can't even afford to do that. It's too much. They really need to make everything weekly like I said in my own post.
---
It's atleast the 4th post you did... I don't know. If it was an mistake or not but you did do the same post more than 4 times and just deleted everything else (or the mods did)
---
Outside if duping communities. Yes.
---
I put mine at 1 cap. Fast travel still costs caps, people! I will not be shamed for traveling!
---
people can still pick the locks ,if you want to keep something safe use a keycode door or wall it in.
---
There is Weapon Smith perk, where at max rank it reduces gun wear by 50%. And Weapon Artisan, where at max rank allows you to repair guns up to 200% at max rank.
---
So I imagine as she relocates across the map over time her icon will follow her! That’s cool.
---
I just dont lock anything anymore tired of people picking the locks.
---
You should've picked a better one!
---
No I did after I looked at my post history. I only ment to post once
---
Ok as long as the hacking doesn’t involve endlessly griefing me lol
---
If you mean in the 1st category, they're usually the first or second Tuesday of the month.
---
Plus they are so much easier to wire them together with the wire going everywhere.
---
Yeah nuka spams are good ways to negate incoming damage, it's how I survive the pylons for encryptid event
---
What they are trying to say is "could have sold it", but in the English language and in spoken English this has become "could of" because "could have" = "could've" and this sounds a lot like "could of" in spoken English. So people tend to write "could of" but it's not grammatically correct. So you're right, good spot for a non-English speaker, doing better than most first language English speakers I know!
---
They don't necessarily bring anything new. But they bring something back, old or new, once a month.
---
You aren't alone.
---
Are you posting from mobile? Whenever I get a posting error on mobile I cancel out of it and hey presto, it’s already posted! 
---
I’ve definitely done this before where it’s said it’s failed then posted half a dozen times.
---
Thats a sweet name you got there
---
You're thinking of something else entirely.
---
u/Ladydevann
---
Bugged, same challenges reward you before you complete them. So you didn't get any score because you already been rewarded it.
---
Seems to be a problem with Xbox Live.
---
Oh yes!
---
Just let us be creative, and let us clip through stuff. FO4 was better (not perfect though) in that regard as it was a little more flexible.
---
My Halloween event plans have been selling very fast recently, in hindsight I guess they're a low price for rare(?) plans but I have no issue with that if the buyer doesn't already know them.
---
People who buy my things en masse to put in their own vendors at 10x the price irk me a little though...
---
Most likely in my opinion. 
---
I wouldn't rely on it not changing till nest Tuesday when the challenges change.
---
Bloodied is not the way to go with pvp. There is a damage cap so it doesn't matter
---
Its too soon 😢😢
---
Gamma Gun or Radium Rifle are the bane of Bloodied. 
---
Eventually they either have to eat the rads and die to them hitting 100%, or they have to pop something to purge rads and destroy their build's benifits.
---
Either way, if they're gulping Nuka Quantum like air, or they due to having 100% rads, you end up being the one trolling them because either they fall over dead, or you waste their time hitting you like a limp noodle as they chug Quantums.
---
One time I was playing with my friends and I saw that a player was in a nuke silo. We waited for 45 mins until nothing happened so I decided to go to a silo myself. It took 10 mins until I dropped it to prime. When the Queen healed, we saw that another nuke was launched, aaand it was coming right on us, so the dude nuked us and the Queen. We were able to move the Queen to far away from the blast. And guess what? That guy and his friends were in the blast zone so they all died when the nuke hit. After that, I decided to nuke his camp
---
Just got given one thanks for the offer though
---
Yeah on the RIF app. It'd say wait a couple minutes so I'd try again and again and so I didn't think anything was going through
---
Private worlds persist for about 5 minutes after the fallout 1st members are all gone - so even if noone is on the world. This timer auto sets to zero if the owner of the world goes to a public server
---
Nuka cola Quantum + damage reduction perks
---
Yeah, people are doing that to protest the change to not being able to drag your whole time into PvP. Actually both normal PvPers and troll PvPers are doing it atm.
---
Fire sale, buy it before its gone!
---
Thank you for the explanation, makes sense. Also thank you.
---
This is the way.
---
Same thing with my water, Junk Extractor, and my melons. Just try and save me some screws XD
---
Signed
---
Just use a Gamma Gun. It's the best pvp weapon to go imo. Get a Executioner Gamma Gun and every Bloodied build is one shot lol. The rads will kill them instand. No stimpack or dmg reduction perk will help them as far as I know
---
hmm i did track them down and it seems like they have all legacy explosive energy weapons
---
How old and did he have a mic
---
Yeah I know there were robots before but by NPCs I meant humans... I'm thinking if I had played before Wastelanders I'd have not enjoyed this near as much!  I'd hate to see Appalachia crawling with humans, but I'm glad they did put in a few!  I'm only 15 levels in but I'm having fun!
---
i had a gamma gun and it did nothing, they did have a lot of legacy weapons but i did zero damage.
---
Even encrypted isn't that hard when you do it right.
---
yeah they were really pissed when i was fighting them so maybe that's why?
---
I'm really hoping there will be a quest at some point involving the tunnels the mole miners dug throughout Appalachia
---
That does not mean they are bloodied. Of they new what they were doing they were junkies. People always assume bloodied, it's like the boogie man in this game.
---
That golf mini game sure was something.
---
I saw the chicken coop and welcomed the grind. I need that.
---
Wonder if it's due it being a landmine and would be a "neutral" unit once placed. But i don't think other landmines have that same attribute
---
Expecting to be flamed for liking the game in the games’ reddit says it all really. Glad you’re enjoying it!
---
From what JuiceHead said. I'd say if you do the repeatable challenge on top of all the daily and weekly you will. 
---
Though most people will not log in daily or do the Nuclear Winter challenge. So expect a lot of grinding.
---
That said I've seen some players wearing some of the skins from around tier 30ish. I'm already tier 13 myself. So I'd say it is possible.
---
It's coming to pc gamepass on July 9th
---
It's still possible they had the RNG gods glance at them and chain-proc Serendipity.
---
Xbox here. I can craft and mod any PA you might need. Feel free to gimme a shout!
---
Monster Mash. Yesterday I found 4 legendary ghouls in 4 run.
---
I switched some builds around and now I really starting to notice it happens the most on my bloodied builds.  
---
I do get it with my full health junkies builds but nothing like when I’m on my bloodied toons.  
---
On my junkies it might happen 1-2 times during hours of play session. On my bloodied it happens every dam FT attempt.  
---
Not sure if its just the low health or a combo of the health and some perks for bloodied builds.
---
No i was VATsing them the whole time they had no health. hmm this was the second time that day, the other guy had a two shot, explosive shotgun i think.
---
You don't lose your Bonds when switching. Sorted!
---
Serendipity shouldn't apply for PvP. Almost a 1 in 2 chance to completely avoid damage is ridiculous
---
What if one of the unopened vaults was one, maybe the gimmick of that vault was hyper capitalism or something
---
It’s funny. I didn’t think humans were necessary before wastelanders, but I think they did a great job and do help fill out the game. It’s a good foundation for future expansions also
---
They had power armor i definitely tried but they must be spamming radaway. I believe its legacy weapons and not bloodied now.
---
The last queen I did it took about 6 minutes for her health to regenerate and after that she,was dead within 20 seconds. If you're going to melt her that's the,way to do it. 6 minutes gives everyone time to get hits. The thing that gets me though is you usually get better loot from the random legendarys that spawn in the mobs than the queen so why kill her quick. Let the mobs spawn and farm them.
---
They released details on these yesterday.
---
I still can’t find it half the time
---
Bethesda needs to read THIS. Then get rid of pvp and friendly fire in adventure mode. No one wants it but griefers.
---
How did you get these sound files? I would honestly love to dig around and find some myself like you can with gcfscape and valve games.
---
They probably should bring back survival now 😉
---
Then please make a seperate post complaining about legacy energy weapons, seeing as the Bloodied scapegoat has been debunked.
---
Seeing some of the tiers some people are at. Double score and so isn't a necessity. 
---
Also double xp and score would be a way for people to catch up. In fact, some people have passively gotten to tier 30 so if anything double xp and score just breaks the system.
---
 Don't get it... I've had loads of them
---
12, I can not leveled up in the first day and I skipped a few NW one.
---
I can still reach the end before the 10th weeks end.
---
No way they get that working
---
Gutted :/
---
I've been enjoying it. Team ups have been great and really boost the events such as escorting the caravan through Big Bend Tunnel or Line in the Sand.
---
I've never seem the appeal for survival mode. But I never understood removing it either... In fact I can't think of any reason
---
The other player or my nephew?
---
My nephew is in party chat with us, and was at the time.
---
The other player, no idea. They were doing it to another mate of mine on the same server too.
---
hmm maybe i pvped them for about 20 min never killed them once. 2 legacy weapon players, i died from miles away and they would open in stealth to.  
---
That mean no gamma gun vats but again i think they were drinking and eating stealth boys so they probably lost more money.
---
Did they? I might have to go look into that then :)
---
hmm yeah that might be it.
---
Another player I know actually mentioned that frag grenades are destroying camps too.
---
15 here as well.
---
Oh that's not good.
---
!remindme 6 months
---
Dear Bethesda,
---
Please nerf paper.
---
Yours sincerely, Rock.
---
Wes Tec if you're high enough level. Usually between 1 and 3 spawn but yesterday I had 6 spawn in one run. Granted it's the most I've ever had in my 1000 plus hours of game time.
---
So do you actually need those silo code pieces or can you launch a nuke without them?
---
The Junkies in VATs will blow anything away as it's bugged/magic.
---
I guess there is a reason for this not being implemented.
---
Even reporting a player is a pita.
---
Is this why I was bombarded with assaultrons and gutsys? I was playing with another player and we were so overwhelmed we couldn’t operate any terminals without being killed constantly.
---
this post sponsored by paper gang fuck rock
---
BGS is aware of all of this but intentionally designed the game to be slow and a chorefest that’s just fun enough. I stopped bothering trying to give them feedback because they don’t care of they did we’d have a text chat by now
---
Didn’t know that they shared and stacked? Tried it with another player with no change, just got the +3. Anyone able to check this? I would like to be wrong.
---
Bethesda also said they'd be having double score events and double xp coming here soon. It may be close but I am sure most daily players will get it all the way done.
---
Same. I was thinking it was Xbox Live playing up. As, last night, it was showing 0 Friends Online. While F76 Social Menu had them all listed.
---
That's a terrible example. The Brotherhood also have automated recruitment. Have you played this game? That's all litterally in the main storyline.
---
Yeah! I read about it on another post on here a few days back and tried it out yesterday! If you can sneak past the bulk of them at the start, we maybe killed less than 10 and only had 4/5 per wave at the end of the Silo, it was a breeze!
---
Aye there's a Community Calender / Roadmap on yesterday's Inside the Vault.
---
Or just kill snallygasters at the flooded trainyard
---
play these out of a boombox at my funeral without explanation
---
Hell they could just scroll through reddit
---
I haven't seen them move. Might just put them in the suitcase at Charleston station. Or on the stoop of vault 76.
---
They straight up do not care.  There are bugs we reported in the beta still in the game, there still is no text chat for the hearing impaired, most weapons are straight up broken useless garbage, etc.
---
If you find something that you can repeat that's wrong - do not hold out hope for it getting fixed.  Reporting it will just sap your time and energy, and the copy/paste bullshit responses you just make you angry.
---
Enjoy the game as best you can as-is.
---
I Love it too . Any plans that are reasonable priced I buy, if I don't already know them .
---
This is the best solution.
---
This as well!
---
Possibly problems with Xbox Live. Had the same issue last night.
---
Yeah that's what I did
---
That's pretty funny...I could save my dog food.
---
my camp was violently tore apart with this update and reworked into a million glitchy blueprints. took almost 40 minutes to break down because i couldn’t place half of it.
---
Someone did this to me yesterday, cleared me out and when I checked the map they weren't that high level so I was pleased. 
---
I alternate between listing all plans I know for like 25-50 caps, or dropping all I have on me for some random low level guy.
---
Wait, were you primarily trying to fire at them with VATS?
---
It's broken targeting players right now. I only read about it for like a month until my spouse got Wanted by accident and asked me for help removing it. After trying to hit them in VATS for like 2 minutes at 95% and nothing happening at all, I finally had a brain-fart and remembered about it being bugged in PVP. Shot them twice without VATS and they were down.
---
Agree to an extent.
---
Make events like Monster Mash, Hunter/Hunted and the one they had up at Prickett's Fort PvP events that constantly spawn and/or bring back survival as it originally was when they released it.
---
Do you know of this works whilst in a public team on your own?
---
Go to hell rock
---
Sincerely Scissors
---
How surpricing... More atom purchases.
---
There is a quest that rewards a level 30 nonlegendary Fixer. It's one in the questline about the sheepsquatch, which Encryptid acts as the final quest for.
---
...to add to your post, the Stranger in numbers perk works even if you’re solo as long as you start a team. No brainer for mutation users with the new gaming team format.
---
Collision Course.
---
At what point is it safe to start killing? We did site alpha and it felt like the place was loaded with robots from the start. We were unprepared. I think I had 600 rounds and went in with a slow reloading 308 and a shotgun. I have since changed to an automatic handmade/heavy build in preparation for my next run. 
---
Do I actually need the silo pieces or can I launch a nuke without one?
---
Wait, wait. Class freek will neglates the negative effect fully? I know, it reduce the negative effect by 75%, but this will mean it will be 0?
---
I am on PC, but Ill craft one for my self when I am at home.
---
I sell all plans/recipes for one cap each. No matter how rare. Magazine, bobblehead for 10 caps. Near Vault 76. With four characters I get lots items from maps, workshops and in safes. It doesn't bother me if a high level comes and takes all. Helps me clear stash space. Caps have become a non issue for me. The One cap is a maintenance fee... Actually make more money selling water, bulk junk to vendors.
---
Power Up Events at the three Power Stations.
---
If they can't change or adjust the missing points, atleast give those affected 150 atoms per 1000 points missing as that's equal to a level so they could buy skips with it.
---
If someone shares a perk you have it doesn't stack. 
---
I think there's been miscommunication here. 
---
Take the serum

Join party and BOOWM! +2 to all stats
---
Put on strange in numbers and BOOWM +4 to all stats 
---
or if someone shares strange in numbers you get +4
---
I think ally plans are 10 caps, ammo is 1 cap.  Im on Xbox so it's not like I sell much.  There's something weird about Xbox 0layers compared to every other platform.
---
It’s the PC players begging for this so they can sell duped bs to console market. Nobody on console wants this.
---
Play by yourself and start a team of one and you get it, also
---
I'd been in a couple of times, but back then it didn't appeal to me either. NW is more my speed, and that's given me a bit of a confidence boost to take a chance on survival if they bring it back.
---
10000 xp is repeatable
---
I thought they made a statement that weeklies were unintentionally completing early. Like unlocking the SCORE at 3/5 instead of 5/5 and the like.
---
If so, then we *are* getting it. Just not as Bethesda intended. Because Bethesda haha
---
a specific major character does a bunch of stuff that is completly unlike him, and then gets gooified by a golf club
---
which could of been avoided, if he was written to act in his normal fashion
---
That’s the only thing I lock. Who doesn’t enjoy coming home to 20 bullets made after you just sunk over 200 or so into the SBQ.
---
you should be a dev or something
---
It’s interesting, if plans were placed cheaper in vendors and everyone could afford things (within reason) I bet it would lead to a lot more creativity within the community.
---
A stimpak dart gun would be hilarious in my opinion
---
Let me fix that for you.. \*Bughesda
---
No that shouldn't be a paid feature it should be included in the base game...
---
I definitely should get this... I always thought even with Class Freak 3 there was a -1 to everything, and since Public Teams I've actually swapped from 230 levels of Lone Wanderer to Body Guards 3 &amp; Shared Inspirational 1
---
This is a different bug that's been in the game since launch IIRC, when you login around reset it can auto complete a few dailies and even weeklies.
---
This would not be a big problem if the whole score system wasnt so damn strict and tight to complete it.
---
Larry’s Toxic Meat and Go....always find three Snallygasters there.

I only lock the boxes Im running low on

I messaged asking to restore a character (which there is an option for when opening a ticket), and they said they didn't have the tools to do so. That is complete bullshit, they did it for a bunch of people at Christmas time who had stuff stolen, and if you're unable to, why is there an option to open a ticket about it.
---
It is because it rounds up.. or down apparently.
---
The game is pretty good now but it was absolute bullshit before...
---
Lol you think bloodied build is bad??? How about a junkies tesla build with someone who knows how to spam them NCQ and uses stealth boys bc they cant aim and they cant pvp ftf... get butt hurt btw =P
---
The negatives of almost all the mutations are little to nothing with triple freak. Egg head and healing are like free money. Plague Walker about the only one I avoid, and the melee mutes.
---
Pretty much, and it's disgusting that paying customers don't get the treatment they deserve.
---
The community is pretty wholesome and it sucks Bethesda is so disrespectfull towards them, yea some people are blindly defending them but the majority of the community have a good heart.
---
One right next to vault 76? Might have been me. Big sign neon that says "welcome 76 dwellers free food &amp; water".  
---
My entire camp is built to help out new players. I understand that fresh vault dwellers start out with 0 caps but I hope they remember that cool place they passed when they left the vault and come back for the chem and tinker bench plans and .38 ammo I would give it away if I could but yea if I set it to free people will just take them and resell.  
---
I did have a single vendor off to the side with a sign for new players only. However I run into the problem of new players taking everything and not leaving stuff for other new players. Not there fault they are still learning the game. I found a new player once who was not aware 76 was online and thought my camp was part of the game.   
---
I take that as a compliment with how well I integrated it into the surrounding area.
---
the fast travel point part is super important. my vending is placed right in front of people when they spawn. no searching, minimally walking required. placing a few will light up the area and make it obvious it's a vending area.
---
i sell all ammo at 1 Cap, but they move rather slowly though
---
Thanks for the info, I'm surprised that it let's you build anything inside it at all
---
Also the Treehouse Village in The Mire is a great place to go. The Angler counts as a Cryptid and you will always find at least 3 there.
---
This is correct. If you complete the daily or weekly on a the same server that the daily updates on, the game will not grant any score. It’s a bug with the game not being able to properly update the menu. It can be fixed by switching servers BEFORE completing any daily or weekly
---
what do you meant kickbacks to the server?   
---
Does the 10 percent fee not come into the transaction if it is below 10 caps?
---
Oh my bad, was probably asleep
---
It’s random but if you spam and have server lag it can hiccup like that
---
Right and I play solo only 99% of the time, so I avoided it. But now I usually jump into or create a Public Team.
---
Gahhh the RNG, I want a mutants secret service armor set and keep rolling everything but mutants.
---
I got it yesterday and finished it.
---
I didn't realise this, I also found these details in an old post, is this correct?
---
-
---
*Charisma gives +5% XP per when doing Group Quests/Events. Max charisma is 15, Magnetic Personality (charisma perk card) max rank gives up to +6 charisma, Unyielding armor will give +15, X-Cell will give +2, for a total of 38. With a hard cap of 25 thats +120% to group quests/events, totalling +216.8% XP!*
---
I feel all new content (non-Atom store) is locked behind a ridiculous amount of grind, its hard to motivate myself to play anymore with this daunting set of daily tasks in mind just to keep on top of things.
---
Scrip, gold, faction rep, season score... It simply isn't possible for me to stretch my free time to keep up with the fallout grind anymore, yet at the same time I'm so bored with the old content.
---
I have been trying like hell to get it to trigger. I don’t get it
---
They did restore characters when people had their items stolen in that PC hack last year. They 100% have tools, they are just for the circumstances they deem important enough and not basic issues like this. The moment they admit they can do something, they have an obligation to support you. So they simply tell you “Sorry!” and then move on with their day
---
I mean for a real pvp player and a real bloodied build you know that rads are your only enemie. If you find a way to spam radaways fast during combat (on consol first place on the weapon wheel or PC on a specific mouse tab) and use a PA with autostim mod you will win most of the fights. But yea. Legacys are a own   league of dmg output lol
---
In that case i think players should be booted from the servers 5 minutes before reset to avoid this untill it's fixed, there are lots of players that are affected by this bug and don't know about a work around.
---
If I wasn't worried about a wookie shooting me in the back later I would let them be. But honestly it's annoying looking for them when they're there only one left milking an extra 20xp.  Once you have your rank xp, there is no need to keep hiding
---
I was worried that this was going to be another Karen post but you seem pretty cool
---
Is mutants really that good?
---
Project paradise has a chance to spawn more than one, especially in the venison section
---
He's gatling head now - a new SCP
---
And too*.
---
No prob man. Luck you lol
---
No. I don’t know why anyone would want that
---
GpWDirT is my tag
---
I always hover at 900~ scrips, pre-daily quests. Scrips is the first thing I do when I start playing, I cash in, buy a weapon or something if I'm closing in on 1000, cash in more, stop when I'm around 900. Gives me enough wiggle room for when I get Scrip rewards from Dailies.
---
Did all the challenges,  been joining teams and doing all events I can,  doing queen more often than usual and still only at 14 or 15
---
Awesome GpWDirT is my gamer tag
---
YoU HaVe To KnoW ThEsE ThINgS...
---
Nah idk either. Everytime i post a legit question it also gets downvoted lol. That’s just reddit I guess.
---
What gun is that with the ghillie skin?
---
It was designed to emulate one. Success or failure is a different story
---
i dont understand how explosive baits can explode out of nowhere, i threw some around in my camp and all it does is show the shitty smell colour but it dont explode unless enemy is nearby
---
Bloodied in power armor? You should be able to destroy them.
---
!
---
Public events have exclamation marks and are free to fast travel to
---
I run Vanguard at the moment and thinking of giving mutants a try to see if it's any better.
---
On my melee build
---
What’s story mode?
---
This also happens to me again after wastelanders. 
---
I traveled to my camp and spawned at my tent for some reason.
---
Wait... you were using a gamma gun against someone in PA?
---
yes.  Now the quest owner doesn’t get the bonus, the other team members do, and some quests are marked as events for some god awful reason. But it still does serve a purpose
---
Caves. Almost every cave has them
---
That’s not s legacy weapon and pretty garbage
---
👍🏻
---
Whitespring service entrance by all the bins
---
Uncanny caverns
---
I believe Wendigo Cave has a ton
---
Ohhhh I see
---
What I noticed is that my very first shot each time I load into a server wont register but every shot afterwards will. It doesn't matter what weapon I use, the first shot I make on a server just doesn't count for damaging enemies but sometimes alerts them of being hit. It's really weird
---
This exact reason is why it’s taken me so long to actually make a bug report. 
---
So everyone here knows Fallout 1st tents right? They had/have a bug, because what doesn’t. It used to be that when a tent’s owner left the game, the no-placement zone would stay behind in the world. They said they fixed this in the newest patch, and to be fair they did! That was half the problem. 
---
The awful thing about tents is if you leave the server and the owner’s don’t, the no-placement zones will follow you into the next server, and even into private servers. This will continuously build up in each consecutive server and only goes away by restarting the game. It’s possible that it’s not as buggy anymore, but it still 100% is an issue as I ran into it again on a private server the day Update 20 dropped
---
The only place this would make sense is NW because it’s a simulation. It’s the same day every day in adventure mode, wouldn’t make sense to see snow in Appalachia in October.
---
Play solo and start a team, that glitch works.
---
I think it will change to something like complete X amount of public events for 100 score repaeatable
---
Rare outfits
---
It doesn't HAVE to be... that's kinda the point of a Challenge isn't it?
---
Also, run a 4x bonded Event team and take out the Queen. Stack some other XP boosting effects like Food and Well-Rested and get the repeatable XP SCORE bonus in no time.
---
And plans, but once you have them theirs never a reason to do them again...
---
In addition to the “!” You will also see more description when you click on the event before joining
---
And it says public event when you read the description :-)
---
doublecheck that it’s not in your quest log and just not active, i’ve noticed a couple of times it’s there without me activating it
---
Yeah i see that but i mean it wouldnt be hard to implement right? I know fallout 4 had some special decorations up for halloween and christmas in diamond city
---
No. Bullion and scrip gets reset 20 hours after using. Dailys get reset at 4pn UK time
---
Thanks mate.
---
I'm not a huge fan of PvP in adventure mode, but I wouldn't want it gone for others who do enjoy it, and I believe having PvP only events as well as survival mode will help the PvP itch.
---
The blatant greifing though, that can kindly stop. 😊
---
Will do.
---
No. Different timers. On the challenges page you can see when they update. Vendors reset 20 hours after your first sale
---
thought u signed NDA for this, but ty for sharing
---
You can shoot them to make them explode. It's easiest with VATS.
---
July 9. It’s in this week’s inside the vault article.
---
You have all the rare outfits?
---
I was on a workbench so I have no idea how they were doing it, I could see explosions and my nephew told me they were throwing them around.
---
Battle passes, seasons whatever people call them are the curse of this generation and Beth even managed to make theirs worse.
---
Isnt it one year later now in Appalachia?
---
Hard to implement? I have no idea, I’m not a game designer. I just don’t think t would make sense as much as I would like it.
---
Yea that sucks after all the launch work, bring the TSE50 to queen fights just in case. Melee is so OP at zero cost (no lead farming ammo crafting etc), queen battle is the only place where there’s a little challenge when she doesn’t land much. Shooting a few rounds at her shouldn’t break the bank. When someone magics the queen, not just melee players but other shooters can’t loot either.
---
Thank you appreciate the info
---
Yeah ive noticed it happening ALOT recently since patch, and monsters in general have been bugging out and/or in a immortal t-pose state.
---
I think you've missed the point of my post - I was pointing out the irony in keeping the findings of a communist protectron for yourself - the truly communist thing would be to share it.
---
I don't care who locks what - I just think that the communist bots should be free-for-all.
---
Alright thanks guys!
---
I'm in the camp of those who bought it. I got ten White Fedoras, in a row. The hell I'm going to spent another 2k for yet another White Fedora.
---
So fuck that, gimme the plan, no matter the caps.
---
Ah yes! I forgot about VATS.
---
They should have started with prefab and branched out from there to custom components then loosely goosey building one piece at a time capability. 
---
But here we are.
---
I get from 1000 scripts save 2x a gauss Minigun. I hate it. When I want a new  legendary Gauss Minigun I craft me one lol
---
You are correct.  And one piece of chameleon will make you entirely invisible just like a whole set will.  Adding more pieces just makes you a tiny bit more stealthy.  Armor types don't cancel each other out, you could conceivably wear 5 different types and get a benefit from each.
---
PTS went public a while ago, it's available to any PC player who has the base game on their launcher and there's no NDA.
---
It only took the 20 updates to notice it. With patience it’ll be fixed before I turn 40
---
I've been to that camp as well I think. There is also a display case with a single roll of TP in it. :D
---
Mutants is 10% extra DR for each piece, and I don't think it stacks. So a fully modded SS set would give around an extra +30
---
If I have a fully bonded Event group I do them. Easy XP. Also usually ticks some of the challenges off
---
I've found 1/3 base price to be a good in-between for most items. My reasoning is, 1/3 is more than I would get selling to NPCs, while still cheaper for the buyer than buying from NPCs. Not everything is NPC-sellable, obviously, but I maintain the pattern on plans etc. anyway. Some things probably could be resold by someone at an upcharge, but I've found that sales get inconsistent above 1/3 value anyway.
---
Yes. And the same day of the year... over and over. It’s still October...
---
It's counter-intuitive but doing events is actually slower than going to fresh areas and killing enemies. The two exceptions are Line in the Sand, and Radiation Rumble. The amount of exp you get from enemies in those two is awesome.
---
i tried that too, shooting with vats but nothing...
---
does it need to be specific weapon?
---
I prefer vanguard
---
Hey by any chance does anyone have the healing salve (MIre) plan?
---
Rarely do I get less than 1. And I usually make at least 1 run a day through there.
---
well the cannibalism perk already gives you the option to *eat* players...so it wouldn't be too far fetched.   Even better if it actually did something to said player if you interacted with such an error
---
Something finally came from all of our bitching! Victory screech!
---
Oh, I'll go test. I was using builder groups as the extra int outweighs the event xp why you factor killing mobs. 
---
Cha might be better again. Good luck explaining it in game though.
---
YES
---
I don't condone griefing personally, but I liked team based pvp in adventure and think Bethesda should've done a better job at giving players fun ways to defend against griefers instead of leaning into pacifist bs separating the community but still forcing them to play in the same servers. 
---
All the ways this game has been has been has mismanaged is kinda baffling imo.
---
3\* Cryolater?
---
Surely you mean a 1\* Nocturnal Rolling Pin.
---
Congrats, you are now officially one of us. ;)
---
Of course. She gives me shit, over and over again.
---
Fairly frequently I get stuff with the same prefix, I've yet to get multiple bloodied/junkies in a row though.
---
Is there a special prize at the end, or do you just miss out on the board space rewards?
---
The lowest number (atleast with ammo) is 0.001. Everything between 0.001 and 0.0005 will be 0.001 regardless because the game rounds up from the 5. I.E if a round weighs 0.005 and you equip bandolier it will technlically weigh 0.0005 but the game will just make it weigh 0.001 because it cant register it otherwise. On the other hand if a round weighs 0.004 and you equip bandolier it will weigh nothing. Becuse it rounds down to a number the game can register, which is zero. 
---
Im guessing its the same thing here.
---
First world post-nuclear apocalypse problems.
---
"This is fine."
---
CHA also gives you better prices!
---
That's what I've heard, but I'm bad at math and lazy so I can't offer any proof
---
I like it because I don’t grind
---
Mine doesn't, however when I do collect the water there's generally more in my bags than collected. It could be me just not paying attention though, and I could really be getting skimped on water.
---
Nope, you should always be able to shoot your own mines in VATS (even with melee weapons I think). Though with this game bugs are so common that I take very little for granted.
---
I get about 5/hr
---
Your keyboard after spamming “Enter” a million times in the ammo converter.
---
A lot of recent tv shows have had just female leads or movies with female leads if seen the trailer for the doom movie they replaced the doom guy with a female I just want on thing untainted by feminism or people just manipulating groups for them to support them
---
Nobody on PC wants this too for the current time. It's like self-isolation during the pandemic, we know what's crawling around us and isolate to not infect the other platforms with such worms.
---
Wait so the vendor murgmah will only drop it if I already know the plan?
---
Not always.i usually find gulpers and fog crawlers there. But there is a pond icon in the top right of the map of a location with 3 guaranteed anglers.
---
Thats what i thought. Unyielding for the win
---
Wow that seems definitely worthwhile then!
---
I've also just been told the Team Leader no longer reaps the benefits.
---
Maybe inflation happened which lead to protests riots and looting till everything was gone and it just collapsed
---
Isn't it a randomly triggered daily? 
---
I didn't know it could be triggered manually.
---
I believe it can also happen if you are getting irradiated. It has happened to me in certain parts of nuke silos and a few other places.
---
3 in 10 people will have reasonable prices, id nuke the others if I could. nobody buying your shit at 10x the price idiots
---
Same. I tried with a different character to see if it was bugged with one and still was not able to complete.
---
Actually I find free Range often spawns two or three legendaries before the Sheepsquatch if there's a lot of people doing the event
---
The Cryolater is a pretty good support weapon for the Queen fight. If you aren't in the heavy hitter camp, freeze her.
---
It's 12/hour across all of the small ones you have. Any extra just add extra storage.
---
So you get 1 every 5 minutes, until you hit the storage cap of however many purifiers you have. No matter how many small purifiers you have. 
---
Each size has its own rate and storage cap, that are all separate.
---
Game is a perfect balance of surival, story and combat. If they could remove some of the jerkiness and stutteriness that would be great, but with this ancient engine that wasn't even supposed to handle MMOs, i won't get my hopes up.
---
Share a screenshot
---
Aye, after being caught with not a lot of scrip when they did a last minute discount before, this is what I do now.
---
probably bugged as hell yeah rofl 
---
maybe dem explosive baits is just another 'magic weapon'
---
Thanks for the quick reponse. Im guessing the npc vendor cap stash is the same as bullion and scrip since its the same vending system sort of.
---
We need sliders! Or an "all-in" take the friggin lot button.
---
Why do you even bother?  Your only chance of fun and quite balanced pvp is at below level 20....15 to be absolute sure.
---
Im running out of things to sink caps in. I wasnt going to bother getting all the serum recipes but I may have to rethink that.
---
What platform are you on?
---
I read somewhere that you had to be up by Grafton Dam for it to tigger 🤷‍♀️ but I don’t know lol
---
Yup!
---
Sorry I really don't understand your explanation.
---
Shouldn't I have 18 then after 10 mins?
---
9 x 2?
---
Empath is also worth getting as well
---
You take 8% more damage but the team takes 33% less.
---
As well as what has been mentioned there is some in the trenches south of V9
---
Correct.
---
If your first roll is garbage, just wait until the next day and try again. Once your first roll is something decent, that's when you unload all of your scrip.
---
Ok thanks for the quick response!
---
naaa that's the problem, these guys don't want *actual* PvP like they would get with survival. They want the type of 4 chads with (duped) godrolls steamrolling a single individual that wasn't even prepared for PvP. There enough videos out there showcasing how these people suddenly take a leave as soon as somebody on their level of gear approaches the field. Honest PvPers wouldn't need to use exploits if they wanted true PvP battles.
---
Damn I really need to get that plan!
---
Your entire camp (no matter how many smalls your have setup) can only produce 12/hour. That doesn’t mean one small can do that. It means about 5-6 of them can.
---
If you are on PS4 I have lots!!  I will be happy to share
---
I definitely noticed the change when they released survival.
---
Being a builder 99% of the time in game (I love building as much as it frustrates me lol), it was a nice change to be able to build up a camp that didn't have players at any given moment come up out of nowhere and destroying it.
---
I definitely agree with you, things can be better with the game.
---
I'm reasonably sure it's only ever triggered as a random daily on entering the toxic valley. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.
---
I applaud your method. I am too lazy for that much micro but you're getting max gainz there. Fair play.
---
You are correct
---
Ill be the first to day fo76 is a shitty fallout game.
---
Good good. Now let the time planning start
---
Perkloadoutmanager and betterinventory
---
the team leader benefits, the quest owner doesn’t.
---
So say you have a team of 4. players A, B, C, and D.
---
All players pick up a quest.  The team goes off and does the quest together.
---
When player A turns in the quest, players B, C, and D will all get 20% bonus XP and Caps as reward for player A turning in the quest.
---
Player A, as the quest owner, just gets the regular reward.
---
But, now when Player B turns it in, Players A, C and D get the 20%
---
since the CHA at that point is only for the turn ins, what may work best is to do a building team to do the quest, then have the group change to roleplay for turn ins for maximum benefits.
---
Cheers, if you *remember* to do it, it's just a couple clicks. You don't lose your Bonds too!
---
Ooh, ooh. Miss Nanny next.  
---
jk  
---
Kinda.
---
Yep I just noticed I didn't get score for the weekly building supplies.
---
Here we go. ... Again. ...
---
Sell all plans no matter what for  10% of the suggested price.
---
Use butchers bounty and visit the moonshine shack just south of 76, kill all the ticks and move on to the lumber mill south of that. Collect all the tick blood and use chemist perk to make blood packs. Chemist also happens to work with making stimpaks as well. Like ten tick blood is 20 stimpaks or more if you have 3 ranks of super duper
---
Thank you so much!
---
I think the containers at the Overseers camp are instanced. Anything you put in them wont be seen. Better off dumping them in a mailbox or something at Flatwoods
---
There's no minus with +3 because 75% reduce negative effect means you lose 1/2 a stat and the game cannot deal with a 1/2 point so it just goes 'ah forget about it' and you lose nothing.
---
Does that actually work though? I've heard stories about good and bad servers before, but I've never seen any actual proof other than hearsay.  
---
On occasion I'll get a couple of half sensible legendary weapons or armor from concurrent legendary enemies. It doesn't happen very often though.
---
They are, you're just not looking in the right threads.
---
“To initiate the quest, head to Grafton Dam and you'll receive a transmission from Grafton's mayor instructing you to dispose of three toxic barrels” 
---
This is from the fallout wiki that is usually right, usually.
---
Workshops are pointless to me, I literally use them as a way to explore building and if I like a design I make I blue print it
---
Pharma Farma is pretty good in my experience, it took me a little while but after running out of stims I had enough to feel secure after a few hours of poking around spots with chem boxes/aid boxes/etc.
---
They cant be traded
---
Last I looked they are not tradeable
---
It isn't
---
A big issue is too much synergize with low hp builds.
---
Bloodied pumps your dmg
---
Unyielding skyrockets your stats 
---
You have a mutation that also adds dmg
---
And then there's nerd rage and serendipity to make you tankier.
---
Finally there's that weird hp regen bug with adrenal reaction and speed demon.
---
The game is really satisfying, especially when you splat mutants into a bloody mess. I never get tired of it. I love selling junk in my inventory. I love scrapping everything and maintaining my camp. I love looking for that next big build idea and finding that perfect weapon. I love putting together the perfect power armor and working on the perfect armor suit. Just everything is so satisfying. Sure it has its problems, and I wish it had more content, but you get so much for what you pay for it.
---
Very interesting! What about completing Events? Who benefits then, A, B, C or D? Thanks very much for this info!
---
GpWDirT is my gamer tag for the Xbox and I usually play all weekend and after 5:30pm EST on weekdays. Today I'm going to a buddys house and playing Diablo 3 and upgrading some gear and grinding that out. Tomorrow and Sunday I plan to put a lot of hours into fallout.
---
Vanguard
---
While that would be good suggestion for a caring dev company, Beth couldn't care less. They only have the bug report forms on their website so you can't directly prove they don't care but the less bugreports they get the better for them they think. The devs might care but sadly they don't have a say in how things get handled. We already have a player report option in the game (which just links to the website but whatever...) and they don't give a shit about it.
---
Yeah it has, but previously there was a different Underarmor you could get with similar but not as good SPECIAL boosts
---
For XP grinding I find Herbivore better. Crafting "Cranberry relish" is easier than crafting "Tasty squirrel stew" (both give +25% XP). Also "Brain fungus soup" (+5 INT) is easily available, while with Carnivore you have to hunt scorchbeasts for their brains. There are also other cool interactions: with Herbivore + Strange in Numbers + Partyboy/girl the tea rewarded by Sweetwater gives +15 Perception instead of +2 Perception.
---
People dont really PvP untill they finish their build, so noone needs a workshop anymore.
---
It is usually accurate I agree. It's also listed under the daily quests section, which makes me it's actually random. 
---
I don't get it that often and I'm around the dam and lake frequently for the swarm of suitors event.
---
thanks i might atcually try that, finnaly can put that butchers bounty that i got from that pack onec to a good use
---
Events reward atoms, quick and easy.
---
Get a grip
---
Plans sell better in the lower lvl areas, if your camp is in the forest you’ll have a greater chance of low lvls that don’t have plans showing up to your camp. I’ve set up shop near the whitespring and plans move very slowly in my vendors even if they are cheap. I usually leave them in my vendor for a week and if they don’t move I’ll swap them out with the plans I found over the week and drop the old ones at a train station in the forest.
---
Isnt butchers bounty bugged for that or did patch 20 fix that?
---
Damn it, how much bullion is the plan then ?
---
Xbox
---
Put your hazmat suit back on!  Can't leave you alone for one second...
---
do the world a favour and dont post this shit
---
Bummer I would've dropped you one for sure :(
---
I join public teams but I can't hear anyone on the headset. It does show other peoples tags but It doesn't give me any direction after that.
---
I'm well grounded, thank you.
---
Ah no worries, appreciate the sentiment!
---
Enough of them where I don’t care for more. Lol.
---
Are you doing quest dailies or are you doing challenge dailies?  Believe that one is for daily challenges not for quest dailies.  And yes I know how confusing that is and agree the naming is borked.
---
I can't tell if you're being serious or not, but please don't bring your left wing cancel culture bullshit into a video game. 
---
I play a game with giant bats to get away from you "people"
---
Doubtful.
---
A new player, fresh out of the vault, has no caps to travel to your camp to buy free plans. 
---
Maybe they are greedy, but maybe they grabbed them to drop them at the Overseer's Camp or directly to a new player.
---
It's finally fixed!
---
i had to dump/sell mine last night due to sheer amount of weight after farming events. Just do it
---
Riding shotgun event, just go look for the crates, pick up brain fungus as you go, also loads in the trenches around cranberry bog
---
This is my favourite example of Bethesda's code.
---
So first we have one clientside logic system which highlights the item (red or green). It's pretty complex and no doubt considers a great number of variables to indicate if it can be placed.
---
... However.
---
We then have *another, different* server-side logic system which also does more or less the same thing, except it rejects item places instead of turning them red.
---
The reason this is so amazingly bad is because it *proves* that Bethesda spent time and money building  two *significantly different* building logic systems, which run *at the same time*. And released them *both*!
---
Some time during the development cycle of this game, some developer(s) spent significant, valuable time writing complicated logic that *was already in the game* and it was *never* raised by anybody who cared enough to stop them both getting into the game.
---
Absolutely A* incompetence.
---
I love the camp bro  
---
I can put a whole  foundation in a the rocks and walls but i can't put 1 pixel of wall into a rock off a wall that is the size of a bullet
---
If anything just the name of the train is bad. People make up weird shit to make things rhyme and flow.
---
At your level, just keep doing  quests and events inbetween your shopping 
---
Keep taking workshops that are nearby/free too. You don't need to defend them if you don't want to, just move on once you get your rewards. Do the powering up events at power plants for a pretty decent chance at getting the fusion geni. Head to whitesprings if you can too. The faction vendors inside have a ton of different plans each, as well as the vendors in Harper's ferry (Mire) and Camden park (Ash heap) 
---
Also, at the station near Poseidon Energy Plant. (South in the forest region, I forget the name sorry) There is a chance of a special vendor bot that can sometimes have rare plans or items like the hunters long coat etc. 
---
Friendly notice on workshops btw... If you try and take one that's already owned, you'll initiate PvP with the owner. (Just in the workshop zone) So double check the map before you start the take.
---
Idk you sound like an incel to me
---
Might try it again. I usually get around 3 from Whitesprings, it's just a shame they're under lvl too often.
---
Explain
---
Eat a dick, I’m waiting for my worksite to reopen. But hey, if you want to make general assumptions about people who aren’t working right now then I guess you’re in the right place
---
Enjoy the game and then quit when you get to the daily repetitive grind . Don’t fall victim to this mobile game fuckery
---
That's weird. I got him yesterday.
---
i have pharma farma level 1,looks like its time to upgrade it
---
You should start caring about your build at level 40-50, but if you already know what to do just go for it. The most strong builds for dealing damage are bloodied or Junkies build in combination with sneak.
---
Meanwhile I found a CAMP while I was on my level 4 alt that had apparently been harvesting all the free plans you find at train stations for the workbenches and was selling them for 250 caps each.
---
All my plans are 25 caps, bobble heads 100, and mods are whatever the default is for the mod, thinking now...after reading this 10 caps for anything and everything lol sell sell sell, get it outa my inventory lol,
---
"Wacky Waving Inflatable Arm-Flailing Tubeman my warehouse is full I'm gonna give them away, cus I'm crazy"
---
Absolutely. The daily cap limit and scrip limit was nearly enough for me. When a game starts becoming a chore it also starts becoming unhealthy. Drop that out your life.
---
You seem to be treating “feminism” as a boogeyman despite feminism being a movement for equality. If it has a female lead it’s fine.
---
To any who visit, i don't lock anything help yourself esp lower levels.
---
 I want people to look around and i wish people could comment. When I visit I like to leave someting if I can esp lower levels.
---
Holy shit Bethesda fixed something I need to celebrate
---
We have different opinions I know feminism is a amazing step towards a better world but recently it’s been tainting movies and show
---
I think you're falling for the Bethesda-speak.
---
Customer Service, the people who you submit tickets to, have little power to make any changes at all.  There is a completely different group dealing with more complex problems that *does* have the capability to restore characters and do other one-off fixes, but the CS people won't tell you about them, and don't really send complaints to them (probably by policy).
---
I don't know what you'd call that other group, take your pick.  But the people that read and respond to your ticket can't do the things like that.
---

---
I don’t even know that is a thing...
---
weapons that cannot spawn with specific prefixes anymore. like Double or Explosive on an Enegry Weapon
---
This guy beaureacrats. But really, thank you, this solved my issue.
---
Still a great start, but yeah the interface is suckola.
---
It’s oddly expensive. It’s like 1650 billion
---
They also fixed the infinite AP glitch on the queen. Jerks had to fix something not breaking the game instead of all the glitch's breaking the game.
---
We all play to get away from the real world and have fun so it is imperative that the game remains a safe and comfortable zone for all people. 
---
A song where people that make animal sounds to discribe people in the Congo and mock them by saying they don't want to be civilized is not ok. Even in a game.
---
Was it a TSE shotgun, or was it a hacked handmade with a splitter.  If you're on console, then it's not likely hacked.  If you on pc, the rof on the hacked handmade is higher than a shotguns with generally tighter spread.
---
Since Wastelanders cultist blades and Rippers are considered Legendary too.
---
A weapon that used to spawn, but no longer does after a patch; so the only way to get one is to trade for it from a player that already has one. Stuff like energy weapons with the Explosive legendary, anything with the Double legendary, or legendary The Dragons.
---
Found a good bit at Atkos Pharma last night during an event there
---
i did not include an order number last time i asked for a refund of atoms. i just gave the full item's name as listed on the atomic shop
---
Nice! And sorry, I re read your post and you clearly answer my first question!
---
Is it only on Energy Weapons? I got a 3 star explosive 10mm pistol from the SBQ the other day. Was curious if it was worth anything since its a pistol
---
I sell alllllll my plans for under 20 caps. I find it funny someone selling a mounted radroach for 200. When I have it for 3.
---
Just put “I don’t know” or something in that spot but make sure you clearly write the exact item name and amount.
---
Those and TZ Map
---
Collectron is good for scrap, but also the other variations are useful (example: Fasnacht collectron for easy daily food challenges)
---
 Small Vault-Tec prototype generator is good as it is very small and stackable
---
 Refrigerator / Ice Box / Cooler for extending the condition of food items
---
"Lying out" photomode pose is useful if you want to hide in Nuclear Winter
---
any "total conversion" power armor skin (like "Black Rider") is nice, as I like the utility of the Excavator power armor but not the appeareance
---
This is an extremely annoying bug. My max was 13 times once just to FT.
---
They have to be explosive energy weapons
---
2
---
13 I think?
---
that is a normal legendary, Explosive bullets was removed from the drop pool of Energy weapons because they do not fire bullets. pre-existing ones are still around and thus are legacy. the double prefix doubles ammo capacity, and was discontinued in favor of Quad
---
So many issues right now, whole damn builds broken with sneak and adrenaline not working since the update. I'm not gonna rebuild five characters because they broke them. I'm taking a break, I love this game, but am not going to let it stress me out.
---
Like my explosive Tesla Rifle which does a stupid and ridiculous amount of damage , to which if you stand to close to an enemy when firing you will also face a quick and timely death
---
Yes! I did exactly this! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
---
You keep the Bond maxed! Been doing this the last couple days.
---
Same here
---
I'd love a spot on this team if there's still one available
---
No grinding for me. Run the story and when I'm out of non-grindy things to do I'm going back to RC
---
currently 15, but that is because i have a job and have not been able to do much besides my challenges.
---
Perfect. Just hope my team doesn't bail when I do it...
---
I get about 30 stims by farming the ticks in the quonset hut compound west of the treetops at the end of the rail line using butcher's bounty.   Use Chemist and Super Duper to craft blood packs and then stimpaks and you will have more than you need. IIRC you get about 4x the number of tick bloods you have back in stimpaks.
---
Update: built a camp. They never showed up. I might try building with my zone just outside of the items they use and see if they spawn again. If not it's a shame I'd love to have had more NPCs
---
The way RNG is calculated is controlled on the server side, meaning it can't be data-mined so we will never know for sure. I can say that recently I used this strategy and 6/10 weapons I bought were exploding. Another time during Fasnacht (obviously not at the purveyor) I got an executioner's fixer AND the winter man mask at the same time. 
---
So I'll I can say is there's evidence to support my claim (that the server you're on affects the RNG) but I cannot offer definitive proof.
---
Me: Hooray! I finally found a way to perfectly sneak in and place this thing that I'm really excited about. Green Light means go!
---
Beth: Not so fast... (assumed evil, maniacal laughter)

But isn't this song about the gentleman wanting to stay in the jungle because life is simpler and better there?
---
Doesn't he state that the civilised people have it the wrong way round about being over stressed, too busy and having to pay for the finer things in life?
---
Something about them paying to swim and fish but that's what he does all year round.
---
Oh man that sounds way too advanced for this engine. Nice concept though.
---
Curious what you mod it with? I have one and it does like the same damage plus the 20% as my normal. I know the 20% isn't reduced by range so it makes a nice long range gun but its by no means ridiculous imo. Are you using the shotgun attachment or something?
---
Just patched that out in the latest update. Along with most forms of grieving.
---
Devil's Advocate: For a "new" player, who is dropping a play session's worth of unused ammo in and nothing more, it's only about a hundred clicks... as opposed to approaching a thousand per ammo type.

Yea... still a kick in the nads, but I guess they only hit the left nut this time?

Honestly I've picked locks to just use bases. I'm not gonna lock any doors, I run a restaurant in-game. On containers that I need.
---
Aye pretty much what I've heard before mate, I'll give it a try next time I roll weapons and see how it goes. Still using modules to get those last two pieces of Uny SS at the minute.
---
I find i have a couple of those, I try to only pick them up when I see them on my private world and relist them for 1, Even if I goof my plans are usually 10 each.
---
My communist collectron has been captured and is now the property of the Enclave. It works for the Enclave now. Everything it collects belongs to the General of the Enclave. Me. You want junk? Go collect your own.

You can have some water, though. You're welcome.

From what I've read here, you put it on builder, then switch to event when you're going to complete an event. If I haven't tried it myself. Let us know if it works.

Song is satire about modern civilization.  OP is an unhinged idiot.
---
*The song is a [satire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire) sung from the perspective of a native person whose village is visited by a [missionary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missionary) and other "civilized" people whom the native refers to as "educated savages". These visitors are trying to "civilize" the tribe. However, the native rejects them and sings about the major flaws in civilized society, ultimately deciding that he will stay where he lives (presumably the [Congo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_Rainforest) in the song's lyrics).*
---
Makes sense to me ...
---
i started putting all plans in machines at default prices. glad to see people get them!
---
From my time doing the badges, Anglers counted as cryptids there too.
---
I just put  n/a lol
---
You should be on whatever level you're on.
---
Don't concern yourself with other peoples levels. Some people play 16 hours a day. Some people play 16 hours a week. Some people put way more effort in. What are you gonna do if everyone is higher? Nothing much you can do.
---
I'm not even sure there's a notification, they prob won't even notice!
---
and it is purely cosmetic.  Doesn't even protect you from diseases.
---
I have a job and you’re a couple squared ahead of me. What’s your secret man?
---
I mean this in the nicest possible way,  but there are like loads of threads on this now. 
---
It doesn't matter what level anyone else is.  Just have fun playing the game.  If you're worried about what level other people are then maybe it's time to take a break? 
---
I'm not even level one btw.
---
I don't think i have any extra plans but i could make a leg for ya and mod any pieces you need modded.
---
Especially in a game that...
---
Encourages Drug Use - Junkies
---
Encourages Self Harm - Bloodied
---
Has you killing people and animals without a second thought. 
---
Trying to commit Genocide on the Scorched even though the Humanoid Scorched show some primative intelligence.
---
Depicts Kidnapping and Conversion with the Super Mutant Race. 
---
Over Zealous Religious Beliefs leading to Violence with the Cult of the Mothman. 
---
All this is fine just don't turn on your Radios Snowflakes!!
---
This wasn’t a game review nor was it me saying I don’t want to play the game. Was just venting my frustrations with a community I thought would relate with me but I was wrong.
---
I have 3 accounts, and am doing it seriously on 2 of them. Rank 10 and 12 on those two, and 2 on the third. I play almost daily and about 4 hours when I do. I will probs pay the last few ranks in the end if I don't make my goals of like 15 ranks a week. I grind Queens/Encrypted/Arktos/Radiation Rumble/Nukes and use Relish on public teams with well rested and Inspirational. I use my toon that has the highest INT on each account too to boost XP.
---
sitting at 680 as my level, it takes a lot of XP to level up, i spend my time between work and sleep trying to go up 1 level, but once that double XP event hits it will be a bit easier
---
I think rng is globally... "prone to suggestion"
---
When mumbles 1st came out I gave my findings to the "researchers" on this subject. I had received like 5 robot arms out of a dozen purchases. I understand robot arm drops are rare as well. 
---
By globally I mean I had got about 8 drops off of legendary npcs today. 3 of them were pole hooks, 2 of those were exterminators.
---
Not this coming Tuesday, but the following Tuesday, many players will be at level 100 and done with their season grind. 
---
Most likely I will too
---
Restoring the characters was only done once it was kicked up to the dev team , support team does not have ability to make server side changes other than atom shop purchases
---
Hopewell cave has a lot, the wendigo cave too, the mire south of the sunrise field is littered with it, pretty much all the caves.
---
Go away.
---
The problem with this is on a public server finding the legendary adds can be pretty difficult.
---
25 for treasure maps is what I typically do.
---
workshops are mostly pointless. with bullet maker and converters. you only need ammo and food. since you can build a camp right beside the Wayward you can kill all 3 cows every day and never need food or water. plus taking over a workshop is 90% of the time a death sentence. as its the only pvp you can get into on PVE anymore.
---
Also, don't make blueprints green if they can't be placed due to something floating, or remove those items and I will add them again from storage, but making me scrap the entire blueprint is just annoying.
---
If ur going full health ur better off using gear like troubleshooter, scorch, Mutantslayer, etc.  believe it’s been tested to offer more protection over vanguard.
---
Absolutely true. But for me it's just worth it for the xp farm too if it lasts a bit longer.
---
All my plans are 5 caps. Bobble heads and magazines are 40. Don’t sell recipes since you just find them all over.
---
Contrary to what some will say I'm going to suggest you actually have some sort of plan in mind before you start, so you don't go putting 15 strength on to a rifle build for example. 
---
https://nukesdragons.com is a great site for planning builds.
---
That said I wouldn't stress too much about build to start with, if you are familiar with previous fallout titles you'll know how it goes and what you like anyway, if not you will have to try different things and see what you like the best. My advice would be to either go melee with high strength, so you can use power armor later on, and heavy weapons if you like, or go stealth rifleman and go for a high perception and agility score, sneak is overpowered and can make hard fights while leveling much easier.
---
Stick to the left side of the map to start with and learn the game mechanics and what works for you, take your time and have fun exploring and stuff, don't go balls deep into the main quests straight away or you will end up fighting level 50 deathclaws at level 20 odd and maybe struggling a bit.
---
Welcome to Appalachia, don't let the rather large and irradiated bed bugs bite.
---
Hackers can get everything in one day, so why would you still playing this game and comment in this community?
---
Grow up God damn
---
Take your shit politics to World News or some other twisted sub.
---
Gtfo of game subs. No one wants your garbage agenda driven schlock here.
---
bulletin this is not your safe space
---
how much Dr a bloodied have? I'm not one and I have almost 460 when I run I hit 510( or 500 can't remember the bonus from perk)
---
I added that AFTER you asked as you reminded me :p
---
I have 300+ plans in my vending machines. I try to go half if not lower than half on my plans. It works out for me but I'm not the greatest on pricing 🤷‍♂️
---
I wish I could give you mine. I've got a set of 1*-2* but I'm still trying for a 3* set.
---
Whenever someone is buying a bunch of mine, I offer to pull everything out and let them take everything they don’t have for free. It hasn’t burned me yet, but if it does, oh well. I had a really nice guy help me out at level 8 and I’ve been paying it forward ever since because I was almost ready to throw the game away when he came along!
---
I could walk through walls for something like 7 months.  Sent video after video.  Did finally get fixed, but I never got a reply that communicated anything about attempts/progress/resolution.
---
the only thing that gets my goat on 76 is a AFK vendor sub humans. get in get out so others can. this is the only reason i kept nuke mines.
---
May I ask how to grind XP as somebody who is able to grind XP for 10 hours and only get not even one level worth of score
---
Probably bugs...radroaches.
---
Certain legendary effects are making weapons act weird and piling on damage like it's going out of style. Think furious but on all the chems.
---
Kill ticks, use chemist and super duper. Or kill cultist and/or blood eagles.
---
Ah I see...*steps into my liberty prime power armor...*
---
I appreciate that mate, I got a chest and legs no problems, arms though? Can't roll one for love nor money it would seem, had literally everything else at least twice excepting Uny.
---
On the plus side I have half a Vangards set done now as well.
---
I put an x number of zeros,the time I asked for a refund.
---
I sell all mine for 1c but also ran into the issue of high levels buying them all. I’m all for a free market but it just doesn’t feel right. I’m considering going back to 10% of value.
---
Probably some creature destroying it.
---
I have it ontop of a two story building as I'm in a Yao Guai are only started happening the last couple of days 🤔 Strange I tell yah!
---
I think it has to do with how many items are available, my level 3 mule setup near wayward has way more visitors (fully stocked 1-3 star weapons and armour) than my main does which mainly has plans (no mounted plans)
---
From my understanding of this question from experience and previous posts. 
---
The collection rate is not for the purifier but the camp itself. 
---
So if I have one purifier at 12/h it's not the purifier that collects 12/h but the camp zone itself and then randomly picks a purifier to place it in. 
---
Therefore having more purifiers does NOT increase the water collected. 
---
Having more just means more can be stored and the longer you can be away from your camp before needing to collect the capped amounts. 
---
So Small Purifiers hold 2 and my camp can collect 12/h
---
If I have 1 then it will fill fast meaning it will hit its limit fast. 
---
Having 6 still collects the same 12/h but spreads them out randomly into the purifiers. So it will take longer before they are all full.
---
It occurred all the time during faschnat
---
On the PS4 I was able to get the last t60 piece I needed off that suit of power armor in Watoga near the crashed Vertibird.
---
Personal preference really! I’ve found the Mister Handy’s and protectrons at the start the most annoying while I’m trying to scan myself etc just because there’s nowhere to escape them - I’m not a stealth build either so the turrets have to go for me.
---
As a general rule for me is if you can get past without using all your stims/dying then you might be alright to let them live
---
Don't bring here this thing. It's a song way older than any of this.
---
Your camp is being attacked by ghouls and the like, lol or maybe someone on your friends list is messing with you and really good at it. 
---
Most likely you're being attacked by ghouls or whatever. Move your generator indoors where it's less likely to be destroyed and install some fences and/or turrets. 
---
I personally don't like turrets but keep my genny inside and some fences around the perimeter. Between that and my ally my camp stays safe without turrets while I'm out adventuring. 
---
Good luck bud
---
Speaking of walking through walls, I made a new Jack of All Trades Bloodied character and got sick of doing the same startup quests. So I tried, and succeeded in skipping One Of Us and completing Officer On Deck. Turns out the game has no fail safe for this. My character, despite being able to launch nukes, can never open the Vault door or go through the gates. The only way my character will be fucked is when they eventually add in content to the Bunker, assuming that day even comes within the next few years
---
Why should you be able to get all the rewards if you don't grind?
---
yeah almost all my plans are at 1-10 caps and rare or power armor ones are set to 20-30 caps. my stuff moves fast. i focus on selling mostly plans for cheap too help out. ive had that happen to me too where a level 100+ buys all of it just to resell. fuckin dickheads
---
locks used to mean something when a person got a bounty you could kill them and then they would learn not to rob people. now since they can do it without fear. the next logical thing was people feeling entitled to others' resources. what next you want me to chew your food for you?
---
Even if temporary like the freeze effect, it would be fantastic. I could see people abusing it tho.
---
Perhaps you should listen to the lyrics then. Ever heard of satire?
---
Who took offense? I was simply pointing out the flaws in your logic.
---
At this point they should give us a passive 75% ammo recycle effect while using VATS.. that might cover my wasted ammo re-killing things or missing 3 95% chance shots in a row..
---
its no wonder I'm having more fun on my melee alt right now
---
A weekly changing raid would be something which forces you to team up and change parts of your setup to be able completing it on expert mode xD
---
I’m with ya, I even carry the empath at only 8% dmg loss. Ridiculous to look at the adjusted numbers, and see how little you are losing. I’ve got all but herb, plague, twisted, and talons. The new teams format makes it that much better.
---
Yep. Haven't you gone to robot vendors and seen 20 Marine Tactical Helmets there before...the vendors don't stock those normally, some player crafted a bunch and sold them to the vendor.
---
I have finished my reputation slog, I have everything I wanted from the Golf Bullion system, Scrip comes along very easily and apart from the cost of FT I dont have a need for caps(even though I still collect daily) So this grind came at the perfect time for me.
---
What's a reasonable price? I have mine priced between 20 and 50 caps for common plans and 100 to 200 for rare. I figured only new players would want the common ones now
---
ah i understand now, ty, i guess that's a good thing, but i still can't figure out why i'm not making the expected numbers by EOD, i'll re-calculate today
---
Kill area boss enemies,they usually give one to 5 stims. I sell them all everyday.
---
It happens when you charge the weapon before using vats.   
---
You need to VATS -&gt; Charge the Weapon to it hit
---
Running events and lvl 3 pharma farma perks while looting will help you out with this one.
---
Ummm, I just hit a bunch of events and run the sbq a lot. Plus I make runs on west tek and other super mutant locations. Currently if you have the herbivore muation, cranberry relish grants a 25% xp boost and i also use the build team for extra int on top of my unyielding stats. So I sit at like almost 40 int.  
---
But I am only level 13 or 14, I haven't been gridning the 10k xp reward. I just meant on that 2nd Tuesday you can then buy ranks for atoms, and many players will. I probably will too
---
In addition to that, what they find should be stolen from other people's stashes.....
---
Meh. I played it on noob difficulty. Poseidon to kill a Grafton, head East to find a snally, couldn't find a 2nd but when I went back for the responder bot another Grafton spawned. So easy.
---
Is that like the nw thing?
---
Would have been great if every region had their own Nuke Zone boss.
---
I would point you in the direction of fo1 and fo2 then. In fo1, the protagonist comes from what could be considered a control vault, yet still has to search high and low for a geck since his vault didn't have one.
---
Starting? I've been going through a cycle for months now. The worst part is that I have 5 characters on Xbox and 5 on PC. iirc 8 of them are over level 50. I've finished the main game once and Wastelanders twice. I clearly have a problem.
---
Play a bit of 76, and something else.
---
Play a lot of 76.
---
Get fed up of 76.
---
Continue playing 76.
---
Rage quit 76 a few times because of bugs.
---
Repeatedly start up 76, but realise I don't want to play.
---
Stop playing 76.
---
Play something else.
---
Continue playing something else.
---
Continue playing something else, and a bit of 76.
---
Back to top, possibly starting a new 76 character if I have any slots left (I've deleted at least 3).
---
No, the new season pass, they added it 2 days ago
---
Or maybe some well setup survival server to bring back the feeling of getting shot at any point by something which is actually able to kill you as i never die due to npc enemies 😂
---
The numbers are confusing and over complicated. It's about finding that sweet spot of "How many Purifiers and what Size" that works best for you. 
---
I use two small at my camp and these generate fast and cover my thirst and crafting but don't leave any really for selling unless I have a day where I'm going back to my camp a lot.
---
It's crap
---
Finding a red asylum uniform
---
That’s why whenever I’m working on it, I change into my WV black bear costume. Closest outfit I’ve found to being a Wookie.
---
Neat, what's it do? Or how doe it work?
---
Yeah, that one confused me too to start with. Poor wording.
---
When I get my vendor up I usually have around 30 weapons, 30 armor/shielded underarmours, then I fill the rest of my other 2 vendors with as many rare(ish) plans as I can fit even the BOS officer,soldier and knight uniforms plans for 5 caps a piece on
---
And your point is?..
---
My fiance actually found one in the asylum two days ago after only searching for pretty much a single day. I've been looking for well over a year lmao. I'm happy for her
---
I just got back into it and enjoying it,  but timegating bullion is ridiculous.  There is just way to much to buy to justify the time gating the gold bullion.   Biggest put off for me.
---
Thank you, sanity prevails.
---
Pulling the plug on the servers.
---
Something in that direction is coming. A mission on rotating Dungeon  bases
---
And break one of the best and most commonly used perks in the game
---
Public events get announced and are free to travel to.
---
Yeah agree for this too and on top i would like to see bigger hordes of enemies which makes it even harder for these endgame events. I play since first day of beta and have all the most op stuff for endgame but i have nothing to actually use it for as i can do everything with bad gear atm xD
---
6 but I'm pretty burned out, all i wanted was the ammo converter , the PA skins would be nice but not worth the effort

The song dipicts a caricature of a man who lives in the jungle makes monkey noises and fishes with a spear. this can not be any more inappropriate, especially concidering the artists who sand it.
---
It mentions atom bomb once and mocks the uncivilazed man from the jungle many times. It is not relevant to the game. It can be miconstrued as offencensive.
---
Why mutants? Just curious, wouldn't Vanguard or Unyielding be better depending on your build?.
---
Are you referring to the specop thing in summer or the winter update? Im guessing in the winter update is something which looks like it could get to be a raid/dungeon thing 💪🏻
---
I bet you are :p
---
You never even listened to the song outside of the chorus, did you?
---
Ignorance isn't an acceptable companion for censure.
---
I always like the repeatable "heists" in GTA:O. There's a few setup missions that can be done solo or in a group, with a final mission that requires a team to complete with a lucrative payout.
---
Now, FO76 isn't the same game as gta:o, but having repeatable missions that are  part of a larger repeatable chapter/story instead of the same 3 repeatable missions. Gather tubes, kill or dont kill this dude, and get me this mcguffin.
---
god damn that ronin helmet looks sweet as f. might have to start the NW grind after all
---
you may want to rethink that. racism wasnt a 21st, or even a 20th century concept you know
---
You have to find a fresh one, when you do the quest will pop. Sell all the old ones, they are useless at the moment.
---
The quest only triggers when you find one in the real world. What you're holding onto is junk.
---
Also, you can only do them one at a time so if you pick up 2 or more before you hand it in, you can only hand in one and the rest are also junk.
---
To be fair I worked with what I had building onto a cliff and it works. I really love my CAMP it’s literally so nice to log into it. Come check me out Devils Backbone or whatever, the BoS graves are my entrance 🤘
---
I don't think it's bugged, it just isn't lined up. Apparently raiders enjoy messing with people who have OCD.
---
was it always like this? i swear i did them like this before
---
I was helping a friend rebuild their house from scratch and we were making a floating deck to give the appearance of a pier for a private swimming hole. I wanted to try a different set of stairs so I added a second access point, but the original staircase wouldn't go away. So I added different stairs on the other side and attached them to a foundation piece on the ground. Not only would the original stairs not change/remove, now the new stairs wouldn't either. For any of them. I had four stairs at this point and I could no longer remove any of them lmao. She had to "move" her camp back into the same spot so everything would go into storage.
---
did they change it? i used to this like ten times in a row just from tech data from my inventory
---
Oh no! I spilled some RadAway and now my camp is gone!
---
As far as I know, I haven't been playing since Beta though so it may have changed over time.
---
Oh yeah? Try the "can't remove need support" bullshit
---
Sorry for all the rage you're getting here OP. I agree the song is problematic. Some have said the song itself is satirical, but I don't think that resolves the issue. Fallout itself is deeply satirical, verging on self-critical, of American culture, especially consumerism and anti-communism (thus claims to keep politics out of the game seem odd to me - its already there). Personally, when i hear that song i fold my distaste for it into my roleplay. Julie points out that other songs (e.g. a good man is hard to find) are problematic, so the writers are attentive to these issues. Maybe Bethesda could do the same here.
---
Its covered in turrets and ontop of my building over looking a cliff, unless they can climb 🤔. But never had that haha But ill engineer a solution or move and give up my precious aluminium extractor haha
---
I'm at 100 after paying 150$ nub
---
Twitter or Facebook
---
Oh man. I was thinking of switching to laser turrets for better authenticity, but not after seeing that. That looks like Boba Fett used him for target practice.
---
Haha that explains it! Thanks again.
---
Unfortunately I already tried that, thank you for the potential tip though!
---
That’s brilliant! I’m going to try that.
---
What character level are you in game?
---
It's been that way for a very long time.
---
There might have been a way you exploit your war around it (perhaps by accident) but what I said is the intended way it's meant to work.
---
They aren't responsible for your personal life. Sorry, but this is such an entitled rant.
---
I had 300-400 after Fasnacht. I played way too much.
---
Better than where I'm at - just 12...  I refuse to play NW.
---
Bringing the raids back but streamlining them so they arent a buggy mess. 
---
Adding new team/solo instanced repeatable dungeons where there could be a mini quest like 'find "X" supplies' or 'kill "X" boss'. 
---
Building off of aforementioned dungeons add tiered dungeons where you have to be above certain level to enter and the hardest could be lvl 150+ but all enemies inside are lvl 150 and above, have a couple 3* bosses, and be guaranteed a 3* drop on completion. 
---
Adding more events that are triggered with nuking a certain area. Like a massive mirelurk king, a huge chameleon deathclaw, a hoarde of behemoths, or even an area that upsets the human NPCs and a different faction sends an army in. 
---
You know, the typical MMO end game things where you get to use your gear you have collected/traded for to the fullest and where level (even though it doesnt matter for the story of the game) matters. Could be a great way to give the very high levels another way to grind 3* gear. 
---
I do think the gold bullion system was a great introduction. I think they need to add a gauss commando weapon and then add new weapons this way. Maybe make this a way to buy mods for your current gear that push them to 4-5*s but once made these 4 and 5* pieces cannot be traded/sold. Could keep things fresh.
---
We went the player vending route instead of the hub route. WS was meant to be the player hub but it's been abandoned.
---
I wasn't here for survival, it looks like it too couldve been great but no care was put into making it distinctive. It's a shame.
---
A new high level only area, full of munchkin killing level 150 glowing chameleon deathclaws.
---
A man can dream.
---
Ha ha nope I rarely group up when playing. I prefer to play...Solo. (Sorry, I couldn’t help myself. Please don’t sic the Pun Police on me.) If you see me online though feel free to send me a friend invite and come visit my camp.
---
That’s awesome. Does he still have it? What’s his GT? I’d like to see that.
---
Jesus you sound entitled.
---
same will happen when meat week arrives
---
Please Bethesda.
---
When I see this, I go to another vendor but standing mad next to him is also a solution.
---
Yep.. same here... tried it with several weapons, handmade, combat rifle, radium etc.
---
One of each piece I'm assuming? I haven't tried that yet, but a flat -15% damage reduction against most things would be good.
---
how about small-scale wars (events) between raiders and settlers or the other groups
---
I am stocking up on explosive bait myself so i can send their camps back to where their builders came from, to hell
---
It's not a matter of what you should be on. If you're doing all the daily and weekly challenges and you're getting the recurring XP score once every day, you should be on track for Rank 100.
---
Same, just happened for Robots this morning
---
Lol I am on Xbox but I barely get enough time to play as it is, so I’m sorry I can’t help you. But I did post the link to a YouTube video in one of the other comments so you can see how to make round buildings. That’s the hard part. After that it’s mostly just filling in the details.
---
Well damn that stumps me.
---
Something Complicated Or Really Elephant
---
Why did you quit? Hard to know what you'd find fun and enjoyable.
---
Yeah it is very very annoying at the least..
---
No? It's a song. Its enjoyable.  As a :half cast" person (a term that kind of bothers me) I dont find this song offensive at all and I'm worn out by stuff suddenly becoming "racist ".
---
I used to love the song by "the inkspots" from fallout 4 "I don't want to set the world on fire " is that meant to be racist now?
---
**S**o many **C**omplaints **O**n **R**eddit **E**veryday
---
I dont have unlimited free time. I have to fit it in around life. But the system is so rigid, it is getting tough to fit it in.
---
It sounds like you don’t want to play unless there’s dailies available to complete...
---
Yeah odd to me! Cheers for the advice tho happy hunting! :)
---
I once spent hours on a new camp.  Then I accidentally put a staircase in the wrong place.  There's no going back on some mistakes.
---
Thanks, I guess? 
---
I’m curious, is it because you’re a Star Trek fan, a Star Wars purist who doesn’t like the Fallout touches, or just a troll who hates everything fun?
---
You cap out at level 50; or do you mean diminishing returns of the effects of each point in each stat boosted from gear/perks/etc?
---
Oh they are available, but if I do them now, I lose the score.
---
Thanks! I’m glad you like it!
---
Actually, you should start caring about your build from Level 1 if you don't want to waste time and levels having to redirect the ship in the direction you actually want to end up.
---
I'm not even talking min-maxing. Just making sure that where you put your specials are where they're best place for your build.
---
any shotgun with medic, instigating, stalkers, vats hit, vats crit, or bashing is doing 10x more damage in vats roughly (one shots anything).  Any heavy weapon with a fire rate over 200 (100 if explosive) with the same stacks furious unlimited.  My instigating explosive minigun shred most things in 2-3 bullets, will kill a lvl 90 behemoth in about 13 bullets.  SB's need to hold still and be close enough but i can down them in about 10s if they hold still or land.  Mine doesn't shred the SBQ that fast but I do way more damage then I should.  I think LMG's are the main problems as they fire so fast they are killing thing nearly instantly.
---
People like yourself are everything that's wrong with today's society.
---
Ik but I missed a challenge, just trying to see if I have made up for the loss.
---
Yup, what used to be a one-shot is now a three-shot or more sometimes.

That's the funniest one I've seen, but honestly I'm loving this patch ☺️
---
I am wondering, how do you calculate the dmg requirement? Keeping count of bullets fired?
---
I mean like. Along with unyielding or so. Does the unyielding effect ever cap
---
So skip a day mate, most of us are adults with other responsibilities and a life outside the game. Play when you can and get what you can out of the event, not everyone will get to level 100. 
---
That is okay. The world won't end. 
---
Hopefully.
---
Nice. Hope they get updated soon.
---
Seasons is a way for Bethesda to make more, not make it more fun or easier. I'm not complaining, but those are the facts.
---
If all you have are small purifiers you get 1 every 5 minutes no matter how many you have.
---
If you have 1 small purifier then after 10 minutes your storage is full and you can collect 2. If you have 2 small purifiers it will make 1 every 5 minutes until both are full. So after 20 minutes you'll be able to collect 4. 
---
More small purifiers just make it so you don't have to collect as often.
---
I didn't know that. I never played pubg. Good call.
---
Score points
---
Well Unyielding, the most you can get is +2 for each (except END), so 5 pieces plus a max SPECIAL of 15 = 25
---
You can get it higher than that with +1 on some of your armor, Food, and Chems.
---
A repeatable, higher difficulty activity that might involve multiple steps and takes 1-2 hours to do.  Currently the only thing even close is to do a 3 nuke SBQ run with others that do queen runs on a regular basis.
---
The Vault raid was a neat idea but so badly implemented and buggy, but something along those lines.  Radiation Rumble and Project Paradise are shorter versions but good examples of what has potential for endgame repeatable activity - but you can't trigger them on demand now, so that's really bad.
---
Meaningful, multi-step events/raids of higher difficulty requiring a server to work together.  The Vault raid was too limiting, it was just whichever team entered the raid and that's all you had.  It has to be open so others can join in too.
---
10% chance to trigger a Wendigo Colossus is such a total waste, but the boss fights aren't actually that great either, just pump bullets and they go down eventually.  I prefer the multi-step activities that requires more work...  Encryptid is just plain stupid by design, it can be over in a few seconds once all 3 pylons are activated.
---
Im not sure if there is a damage threshold or if its who tagged the killing blow gets the kill for the challenges.
---
I ran into this the other day with my Alt, only one character would get credit for a legend kill, even if both tagged / did some damage to it.
---
Also, The Dragon legendaries are legacy too.
---
i have no clue but i am on pc. i just one being kill a lot quicker than normal and the number of bullets was instant. The plasma Gatling was shooting like 20+ bullets per second.
---
You're on PC and need bullets you say? Ive got a few thousand of every caliber known to man, hiit me up if you need ammo.
---
I've got a thousand, I probably play too much.
---
Two doors you use photomode on. There are probably videos on YouTube
---
I would love that! Yes please!
---
I like your "Bad Company" suggestion the most.
---
There is something wrong if I have to skip a day because my availability was off by 2 hours

Substitute Content Obfuscating Revenue Earner
---
Lol gotta try you know
---
So Can Our Revenues Enlarge
---
as a mostly melee player I here you, but I went and got a instigation explosive minigun for 4k and joined them, at least I can get my tag in if she never lands, sometimes even I struggle vs a  bugged LMG
---
Suckers Continuously Offering Repeated Expenditures
---
Score on events. Make them rectify this shaddy shit.
---
Since the new update, both claimed and unclaimed workshops have normal location icons on the map instead of workshop icons. I still can’t fast travel to unowned workshops but now it charges caps to fast travel to owned workshops. I didn’t see this mentioned in the patch notes. Is this a feature or a bug?
---
(It’s so hard to tell the two apart in this game)
---
I do try and shot without vats but i was not getting a shot off before being killed. A least with vats i could pop in and out of cover and not die instantly.
---
So lowkey Monster Mash is great for legendaries. Since no one ever goes to it one is free to get from 1-5 legendaries per event depending on how lucky you are.
---
Weird. Mine says travelling leather coat, I thought.
---
yes i was for a while. then i changed to two shot grenade launcher since Vats is really good but i still did 0 damage.
---
godspeed and kind wishes to you :)
---
Online right now, AWildBirbo. Pop me a request
---
When will you be on today?
---
Agree
---
seems that way and legacy suck. I just need to watch out from now on, check the players i try an pvp for plasma heavy weapons.
---
I refuse to grind. I havent played the game since I finished wastelanders since the end game isnt fun to me.  Ill come back once they add something new to explore.
---
have never seen that, at least not yet.
---
That's just called life man, no offense but you're coming off as a bit entitled, it's only a game. The rewards are mainly cosmetic anyway, there's nothing game breaking you're gonna miss out on.
---
I'm busy tonight and 3/4 nights a week but I'm not moaning about it. Either find a way around it if it means that much to you (get up at 6am and play then) or suck it up.
---
I'd like it if there was a boss theres no way you could beat on your own, I felt like team work was the main philosophy of 76, each faction worked on their own so the scorched took over
---
I think he switched it unless it’s on his alt but I will try to  ask him whenever he gets on
---
Usually pharma farma helps me a lot. I like to hit up the ranger district office and the watoga emergency services. Also the Tyler county fair has quite a few first aid kits. Other than that, I usually grind events and daily’s. The Camden park daily’s are really good with that too, very easy and give me around 8 stimpaks each time
---
I found the players and they had legacy weapon hense me taking to much damage so they kind of have nerfed those weapons
---
Whatever the amount of score you missed out on, multiply that by 100 and that's the amount of XP you need to earn to make up for that missed challenge.
---
Now that you mention that, I remember I did find chunks of scorchbeast loot (not Queen loot, though) lying around, too.
---
Unless a plan is particularly rare, I sell plans for cheap. I’m drowning in caps because I don’t buy bullion from Smiley, and just grind through the dailies, so why not be nice?
---
Oh, and occasionally give out stimpack diffusers and formula P. Project Paradise on the go!
---
yeah i know
---
i do think they should be completely optional
---
And let me build stuff without Support... if i want to put a wall on a huge flat rock don’t tell me it needs support... I want fallout 4 build system.. without this shit support needed...
---
kind of true i just like testing my pvp skills even if its unfair.
---
Aaah, good news! Thanks !
---
There is a repeatable for every 10000 xp
---
I’m glad it’s not just me. They’re all normal icons now instead of workshop icons. It still won’t let me fast travel to ones I’ve found but do not own, but last night it was charging me to travel to the ones I did own! Anyone know if this is intentional or a bug?
---
yeah i saw angry turtles video on the regen bug.
---
Its not even about the season, or the rewards so much as the "feeling" It was hard enough not feeling like I was wasting time before. Now its "completely useless" to log in. I know I can still just "play fallout" but I play games because they are fun, and this is sucking the fun out.
---
Yeah, it's great to run across. Even if it's just random crap, it's easily harvested random crap. I'm definitely not complaining.
---
This definitely didn't happen before Wastelanders, and honestly, I never saw it before Update 20.
---
They used to be a lot more generous with their mapping, as in if it turned green, you could build it.  I’m not sure why they changed it.
---
Some weeklies are giving rewards at 3/5, so you could have got that.
---
Let me guess, you aren't Congolese, African or even Black?
---
I’ve had to move entire camps because of that crap
---
Thanks! If he does still have it up, ask him if he minds if I share his GT here so other Star Wars fans can come admire his handiwork.
---
Stupid Cunts On Reddit, Everywhere
---
Yes i have just because you waltz in and auto recruit yourself doesnt mean alot because canonically the other players dont exist
---
yes. We know. And it's being looked at.
---
Nailer still spawns buddy
---
Yeah, a small amount of SCORE for each event would be nice too
---
It drops from the Queen of the Hunt Dailly Quest. You need to have the Treated, Resistant, and Protective linings learned for it to drop. However, this is just a very rare drop, I can't actually craft it. I had someone else craft it for me, and if you wanted it, that is the easier option.
---
If you can't get the Shielded Casual under armor, then the Shielded Valutsuit gives a +2 int, and that one you get from doing the main questline.
---
Ah man, if you're at the point where the game isn't fun anymore just give it a break. I've been there, and if it ain't fun it's pointless playing. 
---
Nothing wrong with that, burn out is a thing.
---
This has been going on for a long time I think my FT attempt record was 28 times , I know your pain and beyond.
---
That and an “I’m stuck” feature.
---
sort by -&gt; hot -&gt; "ammo converter being reworked"
---
Only idiots think they deserve more for completing a event they seemed not worthy.
---
U can get around that by bulking the supplies u need then scraping them
---
Needs more rare events and drops.
---
I have fallout 1st so I nuke whitesprings on a private kill the ghouls log out and log back in and do it again
---
I've actually been having fun lately, I really like the new teams, and getting larger groups at events. The problem is I can only have fun from 12-2pm eastern standard time.
---
You don't think there are medical, security, and rescue personel recruited into Vault 76? And they can't just takeover the pretty extensive Responder network and rebuild the faction? 
---
You don't think the same with soldiers that could just restart the Brotherhood if they wanted? Hell, the Brotherhood is just going to stomp in in a couple of months and let in anybody that shows up anyway.
---
You mean +3 each
---
Fast travel to Hemlock Holes and go towards the crashed vertibird just behind the workshop. It always spawns 2 snallygasters that are fighting a low level Grafton Monster.
---
No one has unlimited free time. The system isn’t ridged. It’s 24 hours.
---
Man you are just ugh.
---
As far as i know the cap is 100, which is not achievable legit. There are youtube videos where people use exploits to get to 100. I personally have 41-44 Int on my xp farmer (depends on group size).
---
I'd like to interact with the other Mole Miner hanging out in the Rusty Pick's basement.
---
Probably.
---
If it’s an event, then the CHA bonus doesn’t apply, only quests (like the main story, the side quests, and dailies)
---
IMHO that’s why they called it “roleplaying” since you’re questing as a group
---
I run a Bloodied Heavy build.. so it's very easy to hit the requirement. I don't really keep count.
---
With this game, I always am.
---
Could you trust it though? Might have a bug where all the feedback gets lost and doesn't make it to the devs.
---
Does someone know if the ammo converter was available on the test server before the update?
---
yup, it's working as they intend it to.
---
I sell that shit for 1/5 the price
---
Of course man I lyk
---
Lol I killed a dude like this the other day no gun just sitting in a bush
---
If you want to play, you can play
---
I'm not that heavily invested so I don't care. I'll do it as I remember it or feel like it but don't feel bad if I miss out.
---
More important things to get burnt out by than this.
---
I used to sell stuff at next to nothing but all the camps I visit seem to set ridiculous prices.  I ended up scrapping my vendor and I just drop all the plans/ammo etc I don't need at the vault now.  I never bother looking at other camps vendors anymore
---
Dam
---
Nice.
---
That’s very nice of you! But another kind redditor promisied to make me one:) stay safe!
---
I can't figure out the spawn levels sometimes. Did one violent night the other day. Got a level 50 vampires explosive +1p combat rifle from a 3* ghoul that came in. Got a level 15 bloodied crossbow from the wendigo.
---
Do you really think that’s what happens?
---
That's nuts - pretty big oversight for sure.  There's still a bunch in-game that seemed almost ready a year or more ago.   For instance, [here's a clip](https://gameclips.io/Ruleryak/b87cb92e-6cb0-405d-8320-4f7335f52ec3) from inside the President's office.  They took the time to make an audio clip to tell folks that found a way in to leave - always found that funny.  In there was a system for redeeming presidential seal tokens for special presidential gear, and some other info screens.  We've been speculating around the ballot printers and election possibilities since launch, who knows if they'll ever get enabled.
---

---
It doesn’t work that way. Need to pick up fresh ones in the wild
---
That's right. Only the communists are allowed to steal from people.
---
What level are you?
---
Any of the blood eagle camps. The mobs there will usually drop stims. Hit up a couple of those and ur gtg
---
I've asked this on multiple places no answer ever. Also lots of joke replies from people.
---
Honestly I'm of the mindset the faster I can sell it the less stash space it takes so I price most plans at 0-25 caps save for the holiday and ultracite pa plans.
---
See, you say this but I had someone shooting and emote spamming at me because they couldn't wait beyond 3 seconds.
---
Exploring. Trying to figure out the weird alien writing added in wastelanders
---
20 updates and they don't even get the fix right lmao
---
Yea I commented on the wrong comment and didn't notice until just now sorry
---
I mean double score for 4 days just means you can miss 4 days of challenges, it's going to be nice but not as amazing as some people think
---
Nope! Legendary Run, and it's rewards, were not available for play test on the patch 20 PTS.
---
Explains a lot, don't it?
---
Oh, so it's back again? I thought Bethesda said they fixed this.
---
That's good I was more worried about average people not being able to complete it, average people meaning people that need more then 2 hours of sleep to function
---
This game has serious jank
---

---
That's not Communism, that's Socialism. Communism means that the State owns the proceeds of labor. Socialism is where Everyone owns the proceeds of labor.
---
I was wondering this recently too.  
---
Other games seem to have much better information about soft caps, hard caps, diminishing returns and other stat and mechanics related things.  
---
I want to know how much does my SPECIAL affect damage, recovery, etc. Is there a threshold to meet for certain builds to be good?  
---
Does stacking effects or such become pointless after a certain amount?  
---
Questions no one seems to answer or even be bothered about.  
---
AngryTurtle is at least doing some good and experimenting and providing some information on things.  Anyone know any others doing similar?
---
Bloodied PA hvy gun build. Add perk like nerd rage, armor pircing, adrenaline, etc. With some damage up chems and food my bloodied minigun does 250-300 critical per round to something like a lvl 65 ghoul 155-200 regular customer damage. 
---
On SBQs I get between 75-100 damage per round into her head, and 40-50 damage hitting her anywhere else.
---
My bloodied guitar sword can get close to 300 damage on SBQ with my heavy strike. It's a one hitter be quitter for pretty much anything in the game if I completely set up all my one hand damage weapon perks, but I don't really prefer bloody melee builds. Not when it's way easier to kill stuff quicker at a distance.
---
Wow, she is hot!
---
I'll show myself out...
---
I’d like to seem patch notes or other important information on our “My Terminal” at our camps. Actually I want them to have a complete function for contacting others. Slap in a satellite dish on it and boom we have a post war internet within the game. Post questions, messages for others and whatnot.
---
Thank you so much! :D
---
When are you getting this info from?
---
It actually was really bad around launch and there have been really bad moments in pockets throughout. Not even small pocket either.
---
Now, yeah, it's ok.
---
They said they have double score weekends planned and what not so if your not to busy during those I'm sure u can get it
---
Enjoy your loot!
---
Have everyone share inspirational.
---
Yes but i higly fucking doubt most of the other dwellers will give a damn about the responders cause only getting the inocculation
---
Also wll things consider that you had to get a military training which mind you i highly doubt the brother hood would even let anyone in especially at this time and yes i sincercly doubt there were any personel like that in 76 because why the hell would we have to go through basic training? 
---
If 76 allowed for us to choose our own starting point and backstory 
---
Like for say 
---
A surviving responder
---
Or a overly cautious soldier
---
I would be all for it
---
Unfortunatly in most of bethesdas games those types of things are always mods
---
Yes, because it's unique, but they got removed from the legendary droppool
---
No problem at all, you too! Cheers!!
---
Thanks for posting this. I am having a hard time searching for the ones you listed. For example, I can't find any that start with 0001. I know that there is a huge amount of items there though.
---
If it truly means that much to you, get out of bed 30 mins earlier every day and do it then. Why can't you do that? Or do it last thing before going to bed. The daily stuff doesn't take long to do at all.
---
Sadly the game devs can't make the game fit everyone's schedule, at least not with daily stuff needing to be done, it's just the way it is.
---
Ammo converter in my opinion is only good for missiles, mini nukes, and syringer ammo, better off just selling everything you dont use in your shop for 1 cap then shop hooping and buying what u need. It's a better return that way
---
You don’t need to grind, you can go at your own pace if you want too.
---
Ah, I read that it also affects Events, not just Quests. If that's not the case then I'll prob not bother HaHa! Thanks again.
---
Just hit 14. Got 9-10 on the first day. But the slowing is settling in. Envious of the high INT players who can cruise through it.
---
Damn I just hit 160 something on my second character
---
And Grape Mentats to lower the price a tiny bit.
---
the game is a way for bethesa to make money.
---
Having issues with it as well, having to manually aim all the time to be effective. Means I can't be lazy and just vats stuff. 
---
They'll fix it, one day, maybe.
---
Funny thing, I think the bad ammo converter menu most people are experiencing is because of their bad internet. Let me explain...
---
I have a hotspot on my phone, I usually play 76 off of that, it works perfectly and I have no lag issues what so ever. I’m using the ammo converter and I just spam the X button for like 2 minutes and breeze through the menus and get my 2000 points. I kept thinking “This is going pretty quickly, how are people complaining about this?”
---
Well my hotspot data ran out, so now I’m back to playing 76 on my shite house internet with 700 ping. Tried using the ammo converter... couldn’t even load up the first screen. Tried it several times but the button to continue just doesn’t appear.
---
So personal experience says issues with the ammo converter terminal interface is based on your internet, no the ammo converter itself.
---
Jesus, Just had that bug and couldnt fix it. Thank you very much for this tip.
---
&gt; "Please be aware that Bethesda Customer Support is not able to adjust points" 
---
I bet you sometime in the future, this statement will be proven to be a lie.
---
It's not that they can't do it. Or maybe it's that front facing Customer Support can't do it but someone in Bethesda definitely can and they're just choosing not to.
---
Much like Bethesda use to say that they couldn't restore your character or return items that you'd lost due to a bug, showed us that they actually could do it, and then lie about it once again like it never happened.
---
OP, I'd keep pushing them. Get them to openly admit in writing that there is no one in the company that can adjust lost points due to a bug.
---
This. Start at level 1-2. The ideal build is completed at around 65-70. Assuming you need to shuffle specials and buy new perks.
---
Yeah unfortunately it does xD 
---
I never would rant on the devs as in the end of the day they understand more about making a game then i do but after the video of the devs playing the wasteland update before the release i just think they shouldn’t be testing anything as they should be considered noobs at the game they created 😂
---
What about my star bug swing speed from last night?
---
375 right now
---
Some Content Only Recycling Events
---
Simulated Chores Of Revenue Enhancement.
---
Quick use tip, after you selected them ammo you wanna scrap confirm then hit back, it will take back to the screen you can select which ammo to scrap again, also once you burn through your stacks and stacks it only takes a few mins right before I log off to scrap what I find in my adventures
---
People who say it is impossible to complete at all is foolish. 
---
However, it's also foolish to make fun of people who point at the absurd grind of this Seasons system.
---
There's the Traveling Leather Coat and then just Leather Coat. Two different items. Visually they're almost identical except the Traveling one has a backpack on it.
---
**!**
---
As someone who built their camp going down from a cliff edge...
---
...welcome to my nightmare
---
With a bloodied stealth commando build Encrypted is one of the easiest events to do solo, it takes less than 2 minutes and you don't even have to shoot any robots.
---
Oh ok yeah mine has a backpack. I got confused because op said traveling. Still a nice find for them.
---
It’s also foolish to have excepted anything else after all of Bethesda’s grind releases to date with this game.
---
What event did you do? Nice find!
---
Roger Stevens aka Captain Generica
---
This has been a problem since day one, they won't fix it. I just want them to bring back the bulldozer so grass and branches stop clipping.
---
And as a lazy player with lazy build....i am sad..
---
I'm "out of bed" early today. I would normally play fallout. Instead I find myself waiting til noon instead. I dont like it.
---
There are all kinds of weird/scary stuff and arrangements on roofs, I always try to reach them. 
---
For example there is one in the Toxic Valley with a skeleton handcuffed to a pole and some food and water just a bit out of reach - and a chair with a book in front of it, I guess someone watched the poor victim starve to death...
---
Thanks :)
---
Oh yeah I know! I can’t remember if I’ve been on this red rocket before. I think they might be adding and removing stuff with each patch to keep things visually interesting. 
---
The tents next to my camp got a permanent upgrade last patch.
---
I'm guessing a few people might not realize there are two different ones, which is what I assume happened with the post title. But yeah, definitely a nice find. They're worth the same, which is quite a lot. Before backpacks came out, I grinded for ages for one so it'd look like I was actually storing the hundreds of pounds of junk somewhere other than the pockets of my pants. When I finally got one, they introduced backpacks like a week later...
---
And alcohol to slur sweet things to the robot so he lowers the price
---
Is it live action or animated?
---
Because if it’s live action... it has to live up to the quality of Nuka Break and Red Star, those two fan made series were so well done and that’s some shoes to fill. It was so good, New Vegas added a weapon in the gun runner arsenal DLC called “The Nuka Break” as a reference to their fan film.
---
If fans can make something like that in a non professional setting, something professional has to be good. They should definitely take some notes on Nuka Break though cause they definitely did it right.
---
You can just go kill snallygasters at the flooded railyard...
---
Also, QotH hasn't spawned for me in weeks.
---
Pretty sure that was their intent.
---
did the uranium fever yesterday and all the mole miners dropped nuke zone items (high rad fluids, glowing/hardended mass), even though the only nuke zone on the map was far away
---
Yea, there seems to be an issue with the prebuilt areas no longer 'disappearing' when you are trying to build there. After patch 20, the prebuilt area that I am camped on reappeared and now intersects with my camp. I am afraid to change anything in my camp other I may not be able to restore it.
---
 Thanks, this thing is a real torture to use.
---
I've seen prices range from 10k-30k, on PC at least.
---
Im one of those players. People dont care about pvp so i dont care about pve  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
This game has to make money to stay alive. Free scrap box means no FO1st subscriptions, means no steady cash flow back into the game, means future dlc will not be free. So you would then have to pay money everytime they dropped a new dlc and probably have to pay to access seasons. Then you would be on reddit bitching about that.
---
if not for covid 19 making me unemployed i swear i wouldn't be able to do a SINGLE daily challenge let alone weekly one, it takes 8 hours for me
---
Again, what? 
---
The Responders are a VERY popular faction for people to roleplay. Players are the vaultdwellers that came out of 76. They have already decided to restart the faction. 
---
Same with the Brotherhood. 
---
And the Brotherhood will absolutly let anyone into their ranks in 3 months when they show up. There will likely be a questline to do it, but they will let anyone in that decides to do it. 
---
Besides, we have all already been through basic training. And have been given Brotherhood credentials. And just by being a natural PC are 1000x the soldiers of the Brotherhood
---
Its already happened. I'm not sure how you can argue it hasn't. 
---
And I'm not sure how you can argue that Vault 76 wasn't filled with all kinds of various specialists. None of them are medical personel? None are security? None of them have been trained in basic survival skills needed to rebuild America? 
---
What was your character? The vault janitor? Even the janitors and soda jerks had multiple advanced degrees in there. 
---
So in other words, canonically, you're just wrong
---
There's a skeleton playing spin the bottle with a bunch of plushies
---
Ok👍🏻I’ll probably keep it
---
For me, since yesterday. No more than the "first bond", no matter if I'm leader or member.
---
There's a random encounter with a settler that has programmed an eyebot to "sing" and it travels with him. Honestly it sounds more like a creepy broken robot noise than singing, the Pied Piper one is much better. I'd love to have one him floating around my camp.
---
I haven’t noticed a bar above my name either.
---
You can't bond with yourself. The blue bars are you bonding with them. They will see a bar on your name for how bonded they are to you.
---
I get people afking on the the legendary scrip machine at the purveyor all the time... 
---
If a timer, lets say a 60s of being idle gets applied, it need to be on all quests NPCs, vendors and interactible machines as well as workbenches.
---
Impressive how there are people who strive to defend a LAZY company like Bethesda
---
You could grind so your a silver away from leveling
---
You mean the halloween paint? I'm pretty sure I saw that as one of the rewards on the legendary run.

76 👀
---
I actually didn't like Outer World's all that much. Just couldn't get into it. I started a Survival playthrough of Fallout 4... It's nice to feel like I have a challenge again.
---
Sore cunts orally reciprocate everywhere.
---
I put another floor next to where the stairs are that you want deleted and it worked for me to delete stairs.  Then I deleted the extra floor
---
Helps a tonne, thanks.
---
They're outside
---
Not anymore scumbag... they patched that BS out this recent patch. No more murdering AKF players like a douchebag.
---
Yeah, same as me.
---
Try asking over in the trade sub that shall not be named.
---
Whole stage out front
---
There are going to be teddy bears all over the background doing all sorts of goofball shit
---
I have this happen alot at the queen
---
Precisely. One each at of Zealot's, Troubleshooter's, Mutant Slayer's and Ghoul Slayer's. Your choice of prefix for the 5th slot. :-) The 15% pieces give more defense against the mob types in question at \~300 DR than a full set of Vanguard's or Bolstering armor.
---
The Hunter's and Exterminator's prefixes are less useful IMO: The only really dangerous animal is a Yao Guai in melee range, and that's because of the constant staggering, not because of the damage; and mirelurks/insects are again mainly dangerous due to staggering in melee range and poison.
---
Feel free to mix and match for the mob types that give you the most trouble.
---
I roll with the Raven Mask and Ranger Outfit as my main outfit
---
Oh.
---
Steer Clear Of Righteous Ethics
---
Agreed, which is totally different from continuous feedback in hopes of BGS tweaking their awful system.
---
Just because it’s released doesn’t mean there’s no chance of fixing it.
---
Try looking at the stage
---
I only took them over for the daily atoms challenge
---
Because I'm not a Bethesda kiss-ass and I want them to do something about it.
---
google the live action F76 commercial for Xbox.
---
I 100% believe that commercial was made as a pitch for a TV show, and wasn't about the game at all.
---
Fallout 4 was better than 76 to me sadly, the online cash shop and pvp ruined 76, not to mention the bugs holy..
---
I’m a level 199 now. I didn’t really have any reason till now to start a experience route until now. I’m learning little tips to get the most out of it.
---
That would be great if you could craft me right leg, how much for it ?
---
people keep metnioning rear iron sights but id honestly settle for the front sight actually functioning. this skin is a complete joke -\_-
---
Has this always been the case with you or just more recently?
---
You seriously dont know about the Quality Abandonment team?
---
Shitty Content Outperforms Recreational Enjoyment
---
I don't see how that's possible when you need to make your own ammo and fix your armour ect. If you don't grind enough then it will break/deplete before you can craft or fix it.
---
Kingdom Come Deliverance. Pretty much a 180 from 76. Think skyrim on steroids.
---
Agreed, which is totally different from providing constant feedback in hopes of BGC tweaking their awful system. 
---
Hopefully they'll do a Wastelanders and do something good about this patch.
---
If Bethesda ever releases content for sale I’m buying it just for the principle. I don’t want this to happen to every game I like.
---
You must be one of those Excavator junk hoarding noobs since you seem so sensible 😉
---
Dying light
---
How long does it normally take for Bethesda Support to respond to an email?
---
Yeah I might try some combination of that, when I find a decent Junkie handmade I'll be going stealth full health and that sounds a decent alternative to Vanguards, which is what I'd probably normally do.
---
Means I might keep some of the SS I keep rolling that I'm just scripping normally.
---
Makes too much sense, they won't do it because of it.
---
on day one i was able to see a bar above everyone in the team.. so 4 blue bars (one for each of us)
---
I feel like this would be me if I wasn’t stuck grinding the god awful NW game mode for the Xmas and Halloween rewards... 
---
(I hate this POS game mode, only thing I have left to get is the final winter reward and then I can go back to adventure mode and grind the seasons.)
---
So got any tips for getting the most XP out of stuff?
---
Knife or blade?
---
I had this happen really bad yesterday that I had to restart the game as sound didnt come back. Its happened a couple times before. Usually it's when the queen has landed and nearly everyone is there, the amount of shooting and grenades etc seems to push it over the edge
---
That’s 125 full days spent playing. 
---
Goddamn, son.
---
I go immediately and try my luck.
---
No you didn't
---
Enjoy playing a perpetually broken game while getting mad to random strangers online.
---
Republican state governor's.
---
i will sell my raven mask to anyone with a good offer (ps4)
---
Damm, nice drop. Yeah, shit's weird as fuck
---
Yeah I wish Bethesda would make like a message board so we could leave messages for each other!  I'm on Xbox and I don't know how to chat to the other players I see... I can do the emotes but it takes me sooo long to pull up the wheel and choose the right one!
---
I will note I'm a melee build also so I get up close to the queen wether that makes a difference or not
---
TIL I need to drop my prices on plans, have been selling most at 49c thinking that was reasonable
---
Hahahahaha...respond, right...
---
Please do me a favor. You are about to get to chapter 2. When you start chapter two, look at the amount of S.C.O.R.E. you need to go up a level. I wonder if the amount resets at the next chapter.
---
Power armor sucks, and no. I store my junk every chance I get because of people like you who just set out to make everyone else’s experience miserable.
---
Wow...
---
How are the mechanics?
---
Same. Lol. I’m level 500 with god roll everything. I need absolutely nothing. So I even made my vending machines free with good legendaries. Made a sign that said dont be greedy yet someone would come along and empty it.
---
I build my character around a shotgun with vats crit. Is this what you mean? So the problem is the SBQ is shred by those players so fast that the rest will become nothing from the event?
---
But then what would people make endless threads complaining about?!
---
You don't understand... They're forced and compelled to maximize everything every day! With all of their time! So they won't fall behind in a pve game where they're competing with nobody and for nothing...
---
Sounds about like my record.  Was getting so pissed off trying to get to a V9 before the nuke hit to start scorched Earth.  Probably failed about the same number of times.  When it finally did work it had taken me so long that I spawned in the blast radius right as it hit and got killed.
---
Sent one off yesterday and am still waiting. In fairness, I sent them one about the Water Wheel two months ago and never received a response so I'm not holding out hope...
---
I took over the red rocket workshop used the glitch of the floor trap with the safe and the metal box got a lot of plans and weapons and amo and lots of scrap.
---
Lol no worries. I wish it was that easy to get.
---
They do provide me with entertainment though, every single time I see one of those inane pro Bethesda posts (90% are actual working for Bethesda, which is even funnier).
---
Are you serious? Lol yeah that’s it.
---
It’s certainly a grind and not everyone will get it, but no you don’t need to play 15 hours a day to complete it
---
tHANK YOU I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO HAD THIS PROBLEM
---
Yesterday it was the first time I opened shop. My stuff sucks compared to yours.
---
I'm wondering what prices do you set for stimpaks ,psychobuff and such? Is there a consensus for the prices ?
---
I am not overflowing with caps :)
---
If we had mods and workshop build permanence for my 1st sub, I could scratch my building itch.
---
Precisely - when the game becomes a 2nd job, it stops being entertaining.  A grind is not the way to keep longevity in a game.
---
I burned all my scrip last night.6  days to reup
---
Bought myself a 3 star instigating dragon yesterday for 2k don’t think the guy realised what it’s worth
---
I can never kill anything with the first hit i do as melee, it never registers i need to hit them like 5 times for them to die.
---
Unlike real life, you can’t bond with yourself.
---
What challenge are you missing?
---
There there , you are safe now little man
---
I enjoy stardew valley
---
Game desperately needs place anywhere capability. The natural look of so many camps would be improved by this, and stress generally reduced.
---
When you say dailies... you mean daily challenges right? Not the daily quests in your pip boy
---
It’s the “Gold Star: Complete 5 dailies” and I’ve definitely done at least 5
---
Hmmm. I don’t know about that. I haven’t heard anything about the ammo converter.
---
I'm starting to suspect that these guys are very well paid for this Lol
---
Education is always an investment that is worth the sacrifice.
---
Half the time it's red I still put it down never having it turned green.
---
Witcher 3
---
Dude,I spent nearly two hours in a “chat” session about missing items, which was supposed to be expedited to an “express” email response from a team that’s supposedly the ones to handle it...
---
That was over four months ago and I’ve yet to hear back.
---
Bethesda’s “support” is to lead you in circles with an automated system then ignore you.
---
That’s how a bad company manages to nit gave to do returns of most if it’s sales.
---
Lots an lots of people are reading the gold star challenge as complete daily events rather than complete daily challenges.
---
It’s the score challenge to complete 5 daily quests. I’ve definitely done at least 5 but I’m still showing 4/5 for the 250 SCORE points. It resets in an hour so i guess I’ll be missing out on those which is super lame
---
I am slowly coming to terms with the idea that my playing schedule isn't going to allow me to get to 100
---
wooby is loose!
---
I touch my willy.....
---
......alot!
---
must be sweet working as a coder/dev at bethesda game studios, they let you cut every corner imaginable and then just have bots handle complaints, this skin doesnt even have its own animations. if you use a drum mag your character reloads the air and the front sight isnt even functional. there are free fallout 4 mods that blow this out of the water how embarrassing -\_-
---
Most of my plans move at 25-50 caps. I only price a few above that (mostly rare plans like Grahm/vendorbot stuff).
---
The challenge is to complete 5 daily challenges not daily quests
---
I've not met this one yet, but sounds interesting nonetheless!
---
Doubtful, since it’s a very cheap ass wAy do damage control.
---
Probably farmed out to India or China, where they only pay a pittance .
---
As an older gentleman, I lived a full happy life. You learn to roll with what life throws at you. A virus that interrupts your career.
---
Staying home safe, protecting others by wearing a mask. Furlough till the fall. And using video games to distract myself from the madness of the news. So by labeling people parasites without knowing them is foolish.
---
Oh I can’t read lol thank you
---
How many of the daily challenges are showing as completed?
---
A lot of people are confusing daily quests and events with the challenges themselves.
---
Someone pointed out to me I can’t read so we’re good lol thx tho
---
What? How!? Tell me your secrets!
---
Me too, especially since I’m a glass cannon.  
---
It’s always fun when it happens multiple times in a row: 1k+ dmg, 1k+ dmg, 1k+ dmg... meanwhile, the ghoul/wendigo/moleman/mireurk/gutsy remains completely unphased. :/
---
Lol. No , Are you an active player or all you do is play house? 
---
Each public events has a few legendary and if you doing the dailies you gatta finish 5. The 10 legendary kills is a week long Challenge. 
---
Just play the game and do your dailies and you get it
---
they get the quest rewards, but you must do  X damage to get loot on her body.  A bugged LMG can kill her in seconds.
---
Man why didn't those "pvp lives matter" people just go to every station they could find to stop pve players from npc bartering instead of their dumb plan to nuke servers to crash? They would of made ten times the amount of progress they did.
---
I agree, even like one Treasury note would be cool.
---
Little kife
---
All those shitters saying it’s bad are going off of secondhand hearsay and haven’t actually tried the game for themselves, probably because some stupid YouTuber like JH who plays everything up way worse than it actually is told them negative things about the game. 
---
(Didn’t try 76 for the first 6 months it was out because JH said it was horrible. Tried it after a night of Overwatch pissing me off beyond belief, wished I had played it sooner... Last time I ever listened to him.)
---
no one buys 38 or 44 or 10mm good for those just use tab to make it 2 menu clicks per sell
---
I gifted a new player yesterday via the container. Dumped it, stepped back, he opened it and showed the heart emoji. Gues it worked then..
---
Lol I don't work for Bethesda, and my account is just over a year old. This game launched in 2018. 
---
What I said isn't "pro bethesda," its simple business. The game needs money to pay the bulls and generate content. In the case of FO the subscription helps keep the other dlc free for everyone. Without it, we would have to pay for it.
---
These still exist, only the blades are Legacies.
---
The handmade one is the “Screaming Eagle”. It looks like a Wasteland version of the Service Rifle from New Vegas. If that’s the one your thinking of.
---
Thanks, I'll take a look!
---
Its crazy how you think you're entitled to something just because you disagree with the price. Lol
---
if you didnt play RDR2 already, do it. its an awesome game, a beautiful world with so much to discover. and the story is breathtaking.  
---
thats about singleplayer. online was nice but r* abandoned it. bringing in roles like the trade, based on hunting wild animals, is great. but then leaving a bug that pretends 99% of the animals from spawning for like 3 months? and a lot of othrr things about the online mode but without any questions, the singleplayer is one of the best games ever made.
---
People say they want more difficult events, but I constantly fail Project Paradise and Ecrpyted because people don't know how to do them
---
It’s not bd internet, dude. It’s the overly clicky interface and fixed item conversion that kills it.
---
EVERY transaction takes three clicks:
---
1. Select “convert to points”
---
2. Select ammo category (and you have to memorize what category every single ammo falls into)
---
3. Select ammo type (and it only allows a fixed amount)
---
That’s lazy, painfully slow, and unnecessarily clumsy. Has nothing to do with your internet.
---
I only play solo and even if no one is around the kills won't count!
---
I’m on pc too, IGN is brandnewzo. Let me know if you guys need anything!
---
Lol.
---
I feel like I'm gonna hear a lot of that...
---
Nah, I have an BE15r harpoon that’s legacy too. Any dragon is also legacy.
---
Well, that’s what happens when you live in the 3rd world. I’m sure you could just go outside and experience Fallout tbh
---
is the driver outfit any rare? found it somewhere random but idk whats rare and whatnot
---
There's always some convoluted order of objects to delete to get rid of other objects. That being said, it could have made you store almost the entire structure before letting you get rid of the one piece you wanted to.
---
what is one of those?
---
What endgame...?
---
It works. Tested on queen fight. Just as she falls. Switch it then. So the prompt doesn’t pop too quick.
---
Uh huh. Right
---
Creating problems to fix. They should be in politics.
---
Star Wars the old republic: its a Star Wars (big shocker) MMO that’s mainly f2p. Mechanics are fairly easy to understand 
---
if you do get it stay off of dromond kas chat it’s pure unadulterated shit ( it’s your typical Xbox 360 lobby conversations  minus the racism)
---
Again, that three click process isn’t slow at all for me on my good internet. 
---
(Waited a bit for the game to load and I finally was able to start processing ammo on my bad internet, can’t spam the button then because the menu freezes up if I do.)
---
Now if they wanted to add in bigger portions of ammo to convert at a time that would be helpful.
---
That's how terminals work.  Also the search bar exists
---
As a high level player the sub is a QoL perk. It makes long hours in more manageable but only for scrap IMO. I have it and it makes the game more enjoyable however I am still in the same boat as you with stash management. 
---
Honestly if you have friends or teammates it's more fun. But grinding for xp is what my main goal is now. Learning tips and tricks to boost this or that to maximize damage or xp is what I do now. 
---
With the recent adrenaline break I have been exploring other perks to mitigate this loss lol.
---
That's why i bought steam version for 20$, not gonna pay for fo1st, but having a mule is awesome
---
Idk than, letting them mutate?
---
Definitely!
---
Do you mean your progress in your current level? I don’t know if there is a way to do that besides the level up screen at the end of a match which is annoying
---
Exactly
---
Sold a large amount of .38 the other day, I buy 10mm , but I agree with you on the .44
---
If it's for rewards you can check the challenges tab when in a game/lobby.
---
Yeah occasionally. Nothing major but it definitely started after patch. I also use 144. It’s rare, but what has increased is my crashes whilst fast travelling. 
---
Happened 4 times (still low overall) but there we are.
---
Thanks for posting this. 
---
I find it amusing that Bethesda is calling this ‘The Legendary Run’ and we are not getting legendary perks until after August... 
---
Damn it Bethesda.
---
I use a adamantite limbs and fireproof. I don’t take any damage from my explosive shotguns anymore
---
Source?
---
That’s fairly wrong.  It may not be theme but it sure has changed.  Fallout had this grittier take on the wasteland that changed after New Vegas with Fallout 4.  The architecture changed, along with gameplay and character design, shifting towards some sort of nostalgiabait modern 1950s setting.  
---
This kinda made the wasteland feel like something less serious and more of a dark joke.  So that’s why I’m trying to figure out how they would handle a show.  My question is, would it be like FO4, or the originals in terms of how the serious the wasteland is?
---
I could try that. Could it be my crapy internet connection?
---
Whitesprings interior is completely under utilised so should be turnt into a community area
---
Wastelanders Patch Notes.
---
I've had this game for a month and the honey moon phase has worn off already :p. Grind is not content
---
I should fuckin hope so.  That thing is so slapped together it's silly.   The design should be a hopper you stick the ammo in, press a button to turn into points, and then you select from a list to get what you want (with larger quantities being an option and a huge potential for "total points", the 2k maximum is non-sensical even in their already non-sensical menu system.)
---
I personally have a whole patio with tables and vendors and what not, but I understand why people lock it. Dont you already have a camp? And if you dont just use the overseer camp... it's not like you need mine. Need is the key word
---
Really Great ideas! Somebody get this man a job @ BGS.
---
I don’t use vaporization nozzle though and it still doesn’t do damage
---
Whats TZMap do?
---
They're actually spawning in groups at all three entries by the road. That's where I nuke them from the cliff.
---
The run up to legendary
---
Hopefully we can spend more than 10 ammo at a time :P And screw having a cap on it.
---
Marathon...
---
I'm excited for seasons but it does feel too grindy, I don't have the time to invest in it that they're expecting at the moment :(
---
Yep, wont be loggin in till next hour. Learnt it the hard way. It doesn't seems to affect everyone though.
---
No auction house !!!
---
&gt;st players are really happy to see other players in their camps. A lot of them spent hours to built it like it is and want people to see their work. If so
---
this!
---
End game should have been where we bring back the Responders, Bos, Women of Mystery etc and group with similar people in our faction to do raids or certain missions as groups.. And you could only join one so different characters would have different endings.
---
Apart from that aspect, Brazil is a amazing country
---
PCs all play on the same servers
---
she gave me two bloodied teslas :(  junkies build btw.
---
Only way I know of and I'm OR 107... =/
---
If yours is the closest and I'm over encumbered then yes, I need it, I don't want to walk to a train station
---
The first night, there were a lot of teams going for events, but now I just see people running the stat boost ones and not doing anything together.  Like everything in the game it's a great idea that seems to be implemented for the sake of ticking a box
---
Rank 15. I just use lunchboxes and eat all the xp boost foods and spam west tek and harpers ferry
---
The guy was asking if his explosive 10mm was legacy and I told him it would have to be an energy weapon. I was referring to the explosive effect. Also what does BE15r mean.
---
They got pushed back just before the patch. I guess they didn’t have time to change everything
---
That's part of the game.
---
They're an Atomic Shop item, just not a permanent one. I can't remember if they're part of a bundle or not but I'm pretty sure they were available a week or two ago.
---
About my rate too...I price the ultracite plans a little cheaper..I stick to around that on jet packs because dont want to kill the in-game economy too bad.rare ones a little more.
---
Agreed, I'm not against 76 tbh its just online ruined it a lot for me personally.
---
It’s such a weird design. Wish you could pull up pip boy like adventure
---
The E means explosive. And it’s not an energy weapon.
---
I just dislike the idea of someone running around in my base. I don't even vend. That being said though, if someone DOES happen to come across my base when i'm there and they're clearly friendly, I unlock the door and let them in to use my stuff and lock it again after they leave.
---
Yeah. I’m just getting frustrated with this game again. Should have known.
---
I don’t believe so, all you have to do are the daily challenges to increase your SCORE.
---
I lock mine to keep NPCs from opening doors but I just realized I usually leave my doors open anyway except the bedroom door. Don't mind if people use my stations but nobody's sleeping in my bed.
---
Those tiles are periodically sold in the Atomic Shop. Just keep an eye out for them, I’m sure they’ll be sold in the Atomic Shop again.
---
Same
---
There is a build limit on these of 20 per camp. They are silent, stackable and oh so awesome!
---
Thanks for your update. I'm surprised you haven't had company... I keep visiting the area and more and more I've seen a group of supermutants or... Scorched hounds (never see them anywhere else)... I've visited dozens of times and it is very rare there isn't something. Yesterday it was a couple argueing whether they should move to crater or foundation and my choice gave some faction reputation.
---
I wonder if putting the camp there influences the spawn?
---
Bethesda support has to have the most worthless game support I’ve ever seen... they can’t do shite to help out their customers.
---
What’s the f*cking point in having a support ticket system then Bethesda if every ticket ends and automatically closes with “We don’t have the ability to fix this.”? It’s infuriating. Have some people running your support ticket system that can actually DO stuff instead of whatever worthless robot/person you have running it now with copy paste responses.
---
The damn replies to tickets asking for help may as well be 
---
“Hey thanks for contacting Bethesda support!
---
no 
---
Please feel free to contact us again if you need another no.” 
---
What a joke...
---
Do you own a seedy shed? if so build one and add the power inside and the vendor outside, then level 3 lock it.
---
Nice, ty for info
---
I didn’t know explosive harpoon guns were legacy
---
My boy was happy yesterday he finally hit 100 treasury note and was waiting til 200 to start buying gold lmao
---
I was like what your supposed to trade 20 note per day.. he straight up wasted a week of gold
---
Could you not just use the normal wired conduit?
---
Like place the conduit on top, attach with the wire, use the glitch to embed it Inside the generator, and then you have wireless power. But it would use only 1 power connector peice rather than 2 peices of pipe conduit.
---
I've not tried this yet myself but it might be a tiny bit more efficient if it works.
---
Still I like your idea, and if not have thought of it unless I saw your video!
---
Would love to see this be a thing!
---
No i don't any idea where I could get the plans?
---
This this this!!!
---
You don’t actually need them, just a nuclear keycard. You can find the silo codes on nukacrypt. I only pick them up to stop that awful beeping haha.
---
Idea: Net harpoon for the harpoon gun. Each shot has a chance to ground the target for X. Additional shots add X up to X. Works on all mobs.  Mole rats and radscorpions digging?  Net em. Queen trying to find a place to land when everyone is on a tent or shed? Net her.
---
If you play on PC and they play on PC then yes. If one of you play on PC and the other on xb1 then no.
---
Why? That be a waste of time just look it up online
---
Yes it is all platforms on patch 20.  According to a.community manager they are aware and working on a fix but no time table...it sucks!
---
Thanks! I actually posted a completely new one you csn check out.
---
Link please
---
very broken
---
Do you mean do everything except attach the power radiator?
---
I make a lot of sales  so when I hit the cap limit I lock the door to the store area
---
Then go away and don't return, because we don't want you here.
---
I went to one guy’s camp.  Which first of all was designed to lag the hell out of your game.  I finally made my way to his vendors, because I needed to finish a challenge for learning food plans.  He had everything he was selling, including plans, for 1000-10000 caps.  
---
Not sure if that was a troll but I moved on pretty quick.
---
[X] Doubt
---
Huh. Interesting. I’d gladly lose that mutation if I can fast travel.
---
I can't turn in mini nuke
---
I like to burgle my way in a locked house. Spooked a couple of persons in bed when im tea bagging or leave a you are insulted note hahaha
---
I usually sell whatever dupped plans I got left for cheap. The only ones I sell kinda high are power armor plans. Only because they keep selling
---
I will... But I'll be enjoying my self while you slowly drown by your own self loathing. No one here cares that you deleted the game. You commented that hoping that someone would agree with you, so you would hate yourself less.
---
I only lock my protectron and water.. as people tend to steal from them, personally like to have people visit me when i play. I'm mostly a solo player but giving people a way to craft and store stuff to me is just respectful.
---
To be fair when I first started I bought up tons of cheap plans to sell in my vendor for what was still very reasonable and cheap. But caps aren’t easy to get in quantities that are really helpful for maybe the first week.
---
Yup. This bit me, too.  Solid reminder
---
They would not be able to process the amount of bug reports they would recive in the first day, and it would only pile on as the days go by.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Cultist_blade
---
It's noted under "Notes"
---
With the amount of people without a real build and the number of low levels that always seem to join the BSQ event if all i did was hit her until i hit the dmg cap I'd unload 1 mag into her within 5 seconds and never hit her again and they wouldn't kill it in the 30 minutes.
---
Instead of being a Handmade couldn't Radiowave be a Radium Rifle?
---
I got all mine from a nuked whitesprings in my private server, surprisingly a lot of legendaries there still.
---
Riding shotgun also guarantees one legendary with the captain, and the minions might also be legendary.
---
No there was a post that did all the math for the season if you do everything including the (NW crap) you will still need 5000 score. The math is 215,000 score earned for the season and 220,000 score required to finish the legendary run.
---
Its a bought item sadly, pops up in the shop occasionally.
---
.38 should not be able to be converted to 5.56 1:1. This doesn’t make any sense. One is rare and powerful they other is practically everywhere.
---
Do you really server hop ? ! Events aka public events spawn every 5min.. with the new public group you are better just grinding them on the same server
---
Can always make a mule and use a courier to move items over. I know there are some awesome dudes on the trading sub would probably be willing to help you move stuff over, just make sure they have high karma!
---
Muling helped with my stash/inv management issues immensely. I’m fortunate in that i can afford fo 1st so transferring isn’t as much of an issue. If you’re on ps4 i would be happy to host a server you can use to transfer items.
---
See I don’t get that. I got a bloodied cultist blade from faschnact off the sloth and I got a mutants from the SBQ last week.
---
Yeah that was the plan, but I realized no ones gonna want that.
---
Bitch bitch bitch.  It took me 3 or 4 minutes of hitting the button quickly to swap more than 1k shotgun shells and 2k .38.  I was doing other stuff and not paying attention, since the game kindly saves your last menu choices so you can just keep hitting the button after one cycle, switching the options to what you want when it becomes time.  The 700 or so 5.56 and couple of mini nukes I got out of it weren't all the much, but it's discarding something utterly useless for the things I need.  
---
I want them to speed it up too, the buying process in the menu would be ok, while you just dump all the ammo you want gone into a hopper and hit a button to get rid of it.  that would be ideal.  As is it's still handy, and honestly, if you hate bethesda so much, why don't you stop being a fucking hypocrite and stop playing the game.
---
Sure that it wasn't a cultist knife?
---
They were half price a few days back.  In sure they will make another appearance in the future.
---
Very generous of you. I'm on XB1 unfortunately but I appreciate the advice and the offer.
---
I also noticed after the update that glowing enemies and their corpses and body parts give off light
---
I recommend you see a psychiatrist, maybe he has a remedy for your xenophobia ;)
---
Absolutely sure on the mega sloth one. Not sure on the mutants since I got rid of it.
---
If you were using a fixer or handmade, they're broken in vats still. You need an explosive laser or quad tesla. They could have been stacking colas like a mofo too.
---
I got killed by a radrat in project paradise yesterday because I dumped two whole mags in vats that all missed. Even though it was right on me and o had a 95% hit chance
---
Beat me to it! Just made a post about it too.  I hope they fix it as customer support are saying they cant reward it back.
---
In events with groups of enemies I use a two shot tesla and if:
---
1, I can chain to a couple of them together on each shot
---
2, I quickly fire off a full clip or two
---
Then all damage I do with all weapons outside of vats will rubber band until I exit the game. 
---
If I fire slowly I can sometimes avoid it.
---
i was told there would be no math..
---
With 3 into Marathoner, I can now sprint across the map🙂. Never tried it before, thanks adrenaline break.
---
dailies reset at 12 et?.i thought it was 11
---
Thanks, I'll watch for it
---
It is.  If you use the search bar you will lots of posts on it.
---
Most importantly Bethesda are aware of it and are looking into it.
---
What about boosting it's Damage and Radiation damage to make it worth while?
---
It must because its turned into a ghost town since I setup unfortunately. 
---
Still a great location though so nothing lost :)
---
I think since THIS update it has gotten so bad, I have to make sure the enemies died and not get back up with half of their health back after it says they died
---
I hope so, my camp needs this!
---
Absolutely sure for the bloodied, not sure on the mutants since I no longer have it.
---
plug your build into [nukes&amp;dragons](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) so we can see it..
---
So excited for double XP!
---
I think it used to be 11. Question, is there an equivalent daylight saving time (British Summer Time) for EST? 
---
It was definitely 17:00 BST yesterday.
---
Check your blueprints. I had that problem yesterday and for some reason it was blueprinted.
---
Question, you’re a community manager right? There was two other community managers I knew of, Ladydevann and another one, I forget his name exactly so I can’t tag him anymore, but I think it was something like wanderer, wasn’t it? What was his name? He said to tag him when I had neat suggestions.
---
The math actually does add up... there is enough time
---
I think it also has to do with number of targets hit in a small interval. People can burn the queen down in under a minute solo and that doesn't seem to trigger the same effect.
---
Most reviews are based on the launch state of the game, now it's several years in and at the place it should have been on launch to be a full game
---
That could work. Also changing its appearance to have literal radio parta on it.
---
just make whitesprings vendor or modus sell player items he can have a 20% of the sale, and make cross server so I don't need to server hoping all the time.
---
rip do you still have the fixer to trade? maybe I have something else you would be interested in
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
Can use this to decide which points/cards you want, to give a better understanding of what could help
---
No, ill show you. I just tested it and it works, ill upload a picture.
---
Yes it is that hard to get it right the first time.
---
Why are you still here?
---
Go away.  If you don't play the game, your opinions are irrelevant and involvement unwanted.
---
I agree, vault dwellers using other vault dwellers CAMPs is indeed part of the game.
---
It's your perogative to lock away your lovely bobblehead collection, but it does detract from the fun a bit, not to mention make life just a little bit harder for everyone.
---
That's kinda the point. Not everybody gets all the stuff unless they play a lot. Stop acting so entitled. Not everybody deserves to have everything.
---
I just sold one to a vendor last night.  Never knew it was rare. 🙃
---
Look forward to it
---
If there is no lvl cap, the easiest way if you don't want to farm is to create a new character and lvl up in  vault 76 to lvl 2. Delete and repeat every day lol
---
Yes. All pc players play together
---
They know about the persistent issues.  All you would have to do is read this sub after any update or play the game like a regular person.  This difference between this and TESO is that this game might have two or three developers working on it any given time not counting when they were preparing for the major updates like Vault Hunters and Wastelanders.
---
I played NW for a bit yesterday (if you can call hiding in bushes playing....😪) after completing all the other daily challenges, but made sure to log back into adventure mode after.
---
Bro 90 other post... You can quit playing the game anytime
---
It doesn't even happen all that often, but I agree.
---
Lotsa bugs I can overlook, lots.  Me having an enemy be invincible for an extended period, often long enough to get me killed is not ok.  The most basic mechanic here is shooting and if it weren't pretty uncommon to see it'd make the game unplayable.  Still super frustrating every goddamn time it happens.
---
Jesus christ it changed. It's now 18:00 instead of 17:00. This sucks big time.
---
snooze
---
You can use same techniques to burgle into the wayward in NW mode. Shhh
---
This is why I try to create a way station for players in each of my camps, one of mine even had a small outside 1x1 building with a 1x1 porch with a bed for wayward travelers to use.
---
Another of my bases is created basically only for travelers, I have a shop on one side with all the work benches and the other side of the base is an inn with a kitchen in the downstairs portion and upstairs it had 2 beds and a piano.
---
I'm working on a gas station next. :)
---
Congrats.  Comin up on 150 and still haven't launched one.
---
Same. I had an easy melee of 100%. Somehow I missed lol
---
(builds up C.A.M.P. entirely using only clean sinks) 
---
Siiiiiiiiiink!
---
(should check if I can actually do this )
---
Yeah it is. I seem to get better legendarys off random spawns than events or mumbles.
---
For me its screen tearing and mobs being super buggier than usual, havent had any hard crashes so far tho.
---
I also never stay logged out from NW. I always go to adventure mode before closing the game  before the reset, it worked for me for the past year autocompleted challenges.
---
It’s from lunchboxes
---
The long barrel has and Antenna like dish on it.
---
Yes! 95% and I'm still missing 2-3 times in a row. So frustrating when getting overwhelmed by a mob.
---
I can offer you a much better weapon from a friend who also wants the lmg. Its a b3325 handmade, imho the best gun in the game but the community doesnt understand it.
---
Short explanation: with 33 you deal headshots, headshots are double damage, every shot.
---
Powerful automatic receiver
---
2 people nearby opened lunchboxes. 
---
+25% xp for everyone in close proximity to the player that opens it, stacks up to +100%
---
hmmmm.... Did you sleep and sit by the campfire? or maybe something about allies? I´m clueless about this, but would like to know too
---
They need better matchmaking - clustering higher level players on servers will help.  These events can be a total cakewalk - usually no problems if I do them on servers I join into where there's regular queen runs and other activity taking place.
---
Every single time. For a bit it was better and what you had to do was wait until the VATS swoosh sound ended then you would land a hit.
---
That's gone now and my prime junkie Gauss rifle sits unused.
---
No dailies 4 you! 
---
"But i just logged in, i didn't do anything"
---
You lose, you get nothing, good day sir!
---
"But..."
---
I said good day!
---
That's where they normally spawn yeah. But if you place your Tent you can change the spawn point. Makes it so much easier to kill them all in a tight group. It's pretty funny honestly!
---
Also how do you get that cake bonus?
---
The Adamantium Skelton perk under Endurance. You’ll never have any broken bones ever again.
---
You forgot wonderful, delicious, cannibalism.
---
Better than Brahmin.
---
I stopped using that version of The collection because they switch the sweet tato soup to what it is now. I prefer getting blood bags and grenades.
---
Like I said, I dont lock them away. But I dont get mad when others do
---
So right off the top of my head I would go for a power armour build that focuses on melee. Maybe throw in explosives since you have intelligence already.
---
Everyone saying all pc player play the same but we don’t know how does the Xbox pc gamepass works for other games?  
---
Do on gamepass go to Xbox server because it all an Xbox service or it just give you a free copy of a pc game?
---
Amazon hasn't signed a contract, green lit production or even started thinking about actors.
---
The producer of Westworld SAID he would dp a falloit aeries if asked, and had some ideas
---
Amazon said they would be interested in putting it on their platform.
---
Suddenly, the internet explodes saying a fallout series is happening.
---
What timezone?
---
Ye that's fair, I meant a general 'you' rather than specifically you.
---
They literally said it’s happening what are you talking about?
---
It is free-for-all. But it was locked in a upper-level room.
---
A pretty apt description of Fallout's America.
---
The mutation work like the first day, you can take it
---
Hmmm. Maybe increase the range too, longwave radio.
---
General fyi- if someone builds something for you and you can't build it yourself: you can't rebuild it. (You still don't have the plans)
---
So if you want to keep it until you find the plans always store, never scrap.
---
I'm hoping that the expeditions will fix that
---
Some time ago im used to have all my doors without locks, but noone close them. Just enter, cry a bit, and leave. So yes, i leave all my camp doors closed
---
They don’t necessary have to adjust score points. They could just give a small portion of atoms (50-150) as a compensation as we will be able to use it for rank up. Problem solved.
---
Powerful automatic
---
Alined long barrel
---
Forceful stock
---
Swift magazine 
---
Reflex dot
---
Suppressor
---
I'd like a proper XP bar in both adventure and NW. So I can see I've got xxx/xxxxx to go to level up. Makes it easier to plan what events and stuff to run and do.
---
CEST (most of Europe)
---
What’s its worth now? I just realized i have one too.
---
Better to keep it online. The ingame one would be buggy.
---
This happened to me at a few events, usually while wearing power armor. There's so many bugs, who knows when this will be addressed.
---
I see your point and agree but I'd even take a 2:1. 5000 .45 rounds for 10k 5mm sounds fair but not 522 .45 for 10k 5mm, that's just cruel and incredibly insulting to our time we spend in the game. Not to mention how long you'd be using the converter just to do it
---
Gmt+1
---
Don't mention it. Murmgh would give me a B2525 Fatman lmao. That's why I stopped rolling 3 stars, I'd rather have 4 chances a day of shitty rolls than 2. I'm thinking Beth only wants to fuck with us at this point.
---
Right. Yes, exactly right. I am not one of their employees lol. 
---
But you can circle jerk with op all you want over it if it makes you happy
---
Power conduit https://imgur.com/gallery/OtOumtB
---
I've shown it on top so you know which one I'm talking about. But it does work with the bury glitch you mentioned.
---
Only cost 1 wire and 1 conduit, rather than 1 wire and 2 pipe conduit peices.
---
Same. Hit my dailies and weeklies. Then it's like sometime hit the brakes.
---
This is for people that don't necessarily know that patch notes exist...
---
I get that this is a problem but if you post here about it you only teach new players how to do this. State that an item destroyed your camp and send a ticket to Bethesda with the details. 
---
Sure it's fairly well known by now but every time someone posts a "tutorial" on how to grief the problem gets worse.
---
.38 auto receiver. Sounds crazy, but it’s nasty, lasts longer and has less recoil.
---
Yeah. I lock a room that houses my extractor and water so I dont have to lock each one. And it's less tempting for griefers
---
I've almost entirely just stopped playing the game. Bethesda doesn't deserve my time or money if they keep releasing subpar content with next to no bug fixes or customer service.
---
You should write 'support' in your title, because this is a bit misleading. 
---
Looking at past issues, Bethesda support often did nothing to help recover some things lost to bugs or abuse, but Bethesda as a whole has responded by giving players stuff in compensation. Like the people who were being robbed by that one exploit-- Bethesda \*did\* make it right by them in the long run. And they've done the same thing with other situations. So they do tend to respond to known bugs that result in loss for players.
---
So in the end, you might not get individual compensation from the support workers. But that doesn't mean the community won't get compensation from Bethesda once the bugs are fixed. So you shouldn't be presenting this like we're just screwed and nobody is going to get anything.
---
Yea I have friends that aren’t on the forums or reddit or keep up with the game news. 
---
They don’t care about patch note so even if it added to the game they won’t read it
---
Cake is one of the various lunch box fun items.
---
Hey, I wanted to follow-up with you real quick. I think what you’re referring to is actually for sale in the atomic shop right now. Go check it out. Look under the CAMP section and then go to the structures section. See if the Mosaic Tiles are what you’re talking about. I can’t tell you how many atoms they’ll cost though since I’ve already bought them. Hope this helps.
---
They said it was "in development with a series commitment". In preproduction
---
Woah so you must have gotten lover 200,000xp then to get there right?
---
Just so you're 100% sure, refresh time is in 25 minutes from now. 
---
16:00 GMT, but most of Europe is in "Summer Time". 
---
So UK is currently on BST which is already GMT+1, Central Europe is on CEST which is GMT+2.
---
The way I'm looking at it... They added the Rep and Gold grinds, Seasons isn't a grind, it's just giving us lots of rewards *while* we play and grind everything else. It's great!
---
The theme and setting are two different things.
---
the best way to handle this down time, is to refill the feeder trough harness, and check the alcohol/energy drink levels on your beverage helm/headphones. 
---
If you must evacuate bowels, do so. But, if your truly embraced the legendary run space theme, change your astronaut diaper
---
Thanks for the tip friend
---
Ooooooh, yeah this does work but my way with the power radiator adds an increased range, sadly not by a lot plus personally I think it looks prettier this way. TBH either way works.
---
No one really knows. It's all just hand waving and conjecture at this point.
---
I was gonna ask about that yeah, so do the radiators have better range then?
---
When it's Summer Time we are GMT+2 and the UK is GMT+1. Hope they get rid of that nonsense soon.

---
Pretty much what I run during events and when I need to max out damage, usually with a 50cal, 5mm, Gatling Laser/Plasma
---
0, and I'm cool with that.
---
I realize.  Doesn’t change my point much.  I can correct that
---
There's already a teaser trailer out.
---
So ive looked and this is the only source that has this info you know that this page can be freely modified on a whim right?
---
If this stuff had been thought out properly we should have an app on out phones that link to our game accounts to do trades
---
I mean, Amazon promoted it themselves.  I'm pretty sure that's as strong a signal as you're going to get that it's happen.
---
It's a commited series, Amazon ordered a full series.
---
Challenge to scrap junk for item(s) that happened to be contained in the supply pack?
---
You probably hit 3/5 on the collect building supplies weekly. The SCORE is getting added at 3/5 instead of 5/5.
---
P.S. The supply crates weigh 0, so I'm keeping it unscrapped until I need the mats.
---
It was addressed, remember, fellow player? The January 2019 patch notes clearly state that this was fixed. We have never mentioned this issue since then because this issue no longer exists, it has been fully fixed and the game works fine now. Thank you for your concern
---
I’m too casual. I sign on, pull up the challenges, mark them all for tracking except the xp one, do like one or two... and then forget about it as I accomplish my actual in game goals.
---
had a similar issue (on ps4), cleared out and organized some data cache stuff and that helped immensely. 
---
probably see how full your xbox is and search on how to help with data storage
---
You don't get the XP rewards until the end of the match, so...
---
Yup this. I opened one and it completed the Scrap Aluminum challenge.
---
Do whatever you want. It’s a sandbox. The amount of things to do is only limited to your creativity or drive.
---
It only counts for NW? Odd
---
Right, that shit messes me up every time lmao.
---
That's how I thought, but in the end it's just prolonging the inevitable. And now with the gold-time-sink that you can not transfer the gains to another char/account.
---
It's just getting more and more ridiculous.
---
I play on PS4 and am currently running into login issues as of this post.  Upon seeing the “Signing In...” UI my game blue screens and has an error.  I haven’t had this issue until today.
---
No problem. I've been having a great laugh watching people trying to figure out what's going on, it's total carnage too!
---
No, pal, I commented that because I gave Bethesda several chances and every single time they managed to let me down. I don't give a shit if someone agrees with me or not, I just want to play games that aren't broken and I want them to fulfil their promises. I bought 1 year of Fallout 1st and still, they haven't added more than half of the things they said would be in it.
---
Game is an unbalanced mess even without the bugs. You are just delusional to think everyone should praise Bethesda for fixing something they launched broken.
---
Just stop it.
---
i envision that preston garvey shows up to randomly stop the show, maybe a literal freeze frame, and informs the viewer that a settlement needs their help.
---
I'm so triggered that I did 80 fasnachts but wasn't finished wastelanders and couldn't get hold bullion
---
I mean... yeah.. no shit
---
I've found the radiator does have a slightly increased radius and it is in circle so that's also fun.
---
mr fuzzy the ride....
---
mr fuzzy npc shows up at your camp, points at bed.
---
Pro tip: Real builds don’t use adrenaline perks anyway
---
I am waiting for the day this returns, I want it so badly!
---
go to Neverwinter or BDO then come back to talk about grind
---
Consider playing on a private server when with fam/firends. That's what I do and go public when I'm solo mostly and dont care if I have to chase down and kill asshats.
---
I don’t lock anything of mine. Water/junk etc. if you’re there and need it feel free to grab it. My workbenches etc are always accessible.
---
I really don't know why the CAMP building rules are so much worse in 76 than they are in Fallout 4.  Who TF cares if something is inaccessible by stairs!?  Why is that a rule??
---
I logged into the game last night and closed it after maybe 3 minutes. It seems like it's gotten worse
---
I'm sure it won't be this way, but I always pictured a Fallout series as an anthology show, like the Twilight Zone, except set in the weird 1950s Atomic Age world and all the trappings that come with that.  Perhaps book-ended by someone in the post-apocalypse finding some artifact of the story and then flashing back to what led up to that.  With the twisted tone of things like the radio Holotapes we find.
---
I wouldn't find the actual post-apocalypse as compelling for some reason, even though that's what the games are about.  It's ironic because, as a game, I would have no interest playing in the Pre-War world, but as a movie, that's the version I'd prefer to see.
---
Are you bloodied build? 
---
When I have FT bug, I just shoot the ground some bullets. Sometimes it fixed and I could Fast Travel, but sometimes it just does nothing. 
---
Super annoying bug, never happened when I was Junkies build
---
Matter of the fact is that there's some people that don't even know stuff like this exists, it would just make it more accessible to them.
---
since we are here, can you guys take a look at my build?
---
Oh lord
---
Why should anyone change this, Jesus christ just tanke the fact your wrong on this. Im not willing to waste anymore time on searching for the right patch notes.
---
probably should be in the non-nuke zone
---
I am just worried that it’s going to get the “woke” treatment
---
Truth
---
unfortunately we can't give you any advice unless you let us know which weapon you're using and what your perk card loadout is.
---
Awesome, I guess I have the luck of a devil. I honestly thought the yellow trimmed fireman's was rarer I got one of those from a toxic valley event.
---
I just didn’t find much enjoyment from it. What I love about fallout is the NPC’s and the interactions with them. So adding them is a huge plus for me. So them being there plus this sub Reddit’s community spirit makes me want to play again. I suppose I’m more asking, if you were to start again, what would your ideal build be and would be the first things you would do to get started/get a leg up?
---
Anything you do in the 2 hours will still be an XP gain, which get you that much lose to completing the level up challenge, and (maybe) the repeatable 10k XP.
---
Try using bethesda patch notes that are right on this site
---
still no info on what S.C.O.R.E. means...
---
... damn synths
---
That would actually be pretty cool. Id have to disagree about having it not be a post-apocalyptic setting though, but hey thats just my opinion. But as far as having a sort of Twilight Zone vibe would be interesting for sure. So you'd like to see different stories every episode?
---
Awesome haha thank you so much!
---
Was it just for the 250 SCORE 30 minute challenge because you'd probably have been better of just grinding xp in adventure for 30 minutes. Unless you were afk'ing anyway. Line in the Sand normally throws me over the 10k xp challenge twice on its own.
---
Yes and no. It's "technically" true but they are very clearly misleading you. Bethesda support can not do it themselves, but they can easily forward the issue to the team who IS capable of fixing it. It's a common tactic to weed out the people who don't find it worth their time to insistently complain so the support has less work to do
---
can you link it? I'm on phone and can't read nothing there
---
Same here. I've never gotten a fixer even though I've had the plans since they were added. Also I was getting great stuff from the Allie daily but that stopped last week. 1* garbage from that now.
---
Well I did it in the first place because multiple people telling me PA DPS was higher. So clearly not obvious to everyone, and wanted to test for myself.
---
Well you can do this. I font care if you belive me or not since I know I'm right.
---
The flew in my logic is that I didn't account for you? Because that seems to be all your issue was.
---
I mean I didn't claim all bloodied builds and its known Junkies is second to bloodied. No offense, but if you read it and paid any attention to the meta (which the a bloodied build would have). You'd of realized that.
---
Hit level 50 and give it 2 weeks
---
Spend Cash On Ranks Everyday
---
They dont mention it once in the patch notes
---
Just run feed the people, get well rested, and join a public team with inspirational. It's literally never been easier to get levels.
---
Because.... You looked through them in less then a minute?
---
Even if you wanna specialize melee, keep SOME ranged weapon on hand for tagging.  That's just common sense.
---
*he said quivering in anticipation*
---
A day 1 problem never fixed. Classic Bethesda.
---
Did it? Never happened to me or anyone I know on Xbox at least.
---
No I never said that they deserve praise, what started this was you saying you deleted the game, good go we don't need you taking up server space anyways. No one here cares that you deleted the game yet you decided to say you did anyways... what did you expect to come of that
---
1 Oh my god really your so brave to deleted the game, you know what guys I think we should do what he did
---
Or
---
2 you know your right but I enjoy it a bit still... Maybe I'll fallow your path soon
---
Yet you got me a man who will gladly stand in front of you and people like you.
---
No that one response I took a while on I just wanted to be certain cause that same wiki source says handmades no longer spawn in the game world also
---
I've played maybe 5 hours and I'm at level 13. That doesn't seem too bad given we are what, barely 4 days in now.
---
I go around dressed as Santa and drop gifts!
---
Ark survival evolved players be like: First time?
---
It's been Vaulted, but it'll be back, I'm sure.  It's been back multiple times.  There were blue and gold variants.
---
There was also the Giddyup Buttercup ride, but that only appeared for a week.
---
You may have misunderstood them. Some people say DPS when talking about "Damage per swing" rather than "Damage per second." Obviously the legendary perk that is designed to buff damage per second is going to give weapons higher damage per second.
---
Because most people that say that haven't actually played to form their own opinion. lol
---
You don’t have to login every day
---
Please dont report another bugs, system is overheat... 3... 2... 1... Shutting down
---
Honestly they should just bring it back. I don't see any harm in it and it kills two  birds with one stone, new content and PvP.
---
I looked, but there's no Mosaic tiles in the Atomic Shop. I looked several times. I'm on PC, so maybe it's offered only on other platforms? I'm pretty sure Mosaic tiles are what I'm looking for, so at least I know what they are called now.
---
Aaaand I just subbed to prime.
---
I've already finished all the Dailies and Weeklies.
---
Open the imgur in "desktop mode", then you can zoom in properly when you click the picture.
---
i'm worried there's a soft cap to these things, like after getting 5 or 10, the game just tosses the next ones into the void
---
Yep. One fixer as of yet. Best believe it was a supressor's.
---
Nah, we were talking damage per second. I think the high numbers make people overestimate the PA damage perk. And granted, the high numbers are more fun on the screen.
---
The thing that pisses me off is, they are not going to change anything about the perks except lower the amount of "legendary coins" needed to get them. They are still going to be useless except that perk with the bloodbug on the card and now we have to wait another month for them.
---
Bethesdas decision making is very questionable.
---
...really? Some of these bugs are starting to remind me of pokemon red. You know, the 20+ year old game made on a cartridge with almost no memory, in a day before extensive QA testing was even a concept. Back in the days when I could chill around with my pal ♀Pゥ ゥゥT until we decided to throw away 157 lemonades to start some arbitrary code execution
---
10,000 xp repeatable challenge for 100 SCORE?
---
Sometimes the UI is delayed as well.
---
Genius marketing plan lmao
---
Double XP weekends are easier. People throw around the word *literally* far much.
---
The fundamental problem is that even just "passively" playing I'm accumulating resources that will go to waste. Legendaries, materials, etc.
---
Grinding xp for the season not for levels, should have been more specific, but yes, those two definitely help. Relish with vegetarian adds near 20%xp by itself, they dont last long though.
---
thanks
---
This happens to me too and I always back out right away but they never stay long enough for me to get an ultracite gatling laser from my stash and kill them while they're using the vendor. One day I'll get to murder an impatient asshole and put their head on my camp's wall...
---
FT to Mac's Farm in cranberry bog, wipe out the mirelurks, equip green thumb and run around the swamp collecting cranberries, some spawn in the boat and the shack, equip super duper and cook some cranberry cobbler, 5% xp boost for 30 mins, you'll come out with no less than 50 food
---
That would be naff. 
---
I was worried the medium and large were going to do something wierd when I put them in my stash because they are just called the same thing, but it was okay.
---
This post should have way more upvotes .
---
Well, do you have proof that this ain't the case?
---
Is this what's triggered when you sleep in your camp, with an ally nearby, prior to exiting the game?
---
Considering there wasn't a single thing on there I would pay to watch, then yeah.
---
Me deleting the game wasn't the point of my message, why are you so fixed on that part? Do you literally have nothing else to do than to defend a game that should still be on early access?
---
I had no expectations other than to share my views on the current state of the game, not to argue with a guy named "FALLOUT FOREVER" defending it.
---
There's armor that reduces fall dmg.
---
Thank you- I’ll try that! We have 28gb free right now but I’m going to go and poke around in there to see what’s going on.
---
I'm worried about the "one wasteland" update, couse if is gonna be like the "one tammriel" will sucks so bad.
---
All my rifles have a damage reduction
---
don't fall
---
Team Cranberry Relish for the win! ;)
---
my arguments is that those people wouldn’t even click on the link on the news pop up when they log in because they simple don’t care about patch or patch notes 
---
I know because I have friends like that
---
I only have the last four patch notes which are all accessible from this subreedit
---
Totally agree with you. Sounds like OP likes to be spoonfed 😂.
---
You’re level 200 and it’ll give you something fun to do!
---
2 pieces of armor with the "reduces fall damage 50%" legendary perk.
---
 Check out Angry Turtle’s YouTube Videos. He has a Bloodied Heavy PA Build which you can use as a solid basis for your own build. If you get your hands on e.g. a Bloodied 50cal (1 Star is enough), you’ll do tons of damage while being quite tanky if you have Emergency Protocols installed and use the “trick” with maxed Lifegiver + Speed Demon Mutation. Honestly it’s really a bit OP in fact.
---
Two pieces of legendary armor with -50% fall damage, the only way I know to take no damage from any height.
---
Me too, the idiot was able to push me out the door, I was still trading with the vendor from outside the door, and made it a point to take considerably longer than I normally would have, don't be a dink.
---
Dang, thankyou! Didnt realise cobbler gave an xp boost as well, ill get on that after the daily reset.
---
i can make you a helmet if you want one. Free.
---
There's a legendary effect called acrobats, it's a minor effect that reduces fall damage by 50%. 2 of them would stack to eliminate the issue.
---
That being said, now I think about it, I dont think I've seen it on an armour piece ingame (it can only appear on legs) but it does exist as far as I know.
---
Of course it would be. Bloodied faster fire rate less vats broadsider anyone.
---
I mean ig? It kinda just reasonably makes sense that a 40% damage buff with longer swing animations is going to do less DPS than what is functionally also a 40% damage buff with regular swing animations.
---
The only people I’ve met crazy enough to not use mutations are BoS people ...
---
I'll be online later tonight if you're still looking.
---
I would think the answer is almost self-evident - if they do not sell, then you are overpriced for current market conditions.  If they do, then the price is right, or too low.
---
You may wan to withdraw sale until closer to halloween, when demand for pumpkins is likely to be higher
---
May as well. Worst comes to worst you just end up spending your scrip a little later than usual. If the discount applies to legendary modules or vault steel, that's great. Otherwise it won't be as useful, but still infinitely better than the garbage mystery pick. It seems like the purveyor is only really good for mid-game now, since it's useless before level 50 and anything she gives you is outclassed by the gold weapons you unlock post wastelanders. Use 100 scrip for a top-tier weapon of your choice with a random effect, or use 100 scrip to roll for a random weapon that will most likely not fit your build with a random effect. The choice is fairly simple
---
were you stealthed?
---
I’m beginning to suspect there had to be a change to Adrenaline in order for a legendary perk (perhaps Follow Through) to work correctly. And when Beth disabled legendary perks they forgot to revert this change. Thus broken Adrenaline.
---
Fair enough, at the end of the day it's just about accessibility. It would be more convenient if I can access patch notes from the console.
---
Nope, I actually forgot that it was there. I planned to snap and bolt
---
Stash has less free space than the weight of the gun?
---
Click on your user name in the social tab that shows you and your team mate. If you are the team leader you can then select make team public
---
Oh sweet I thought it might be something like that. Thanks!
---
I was in NW when the dailies started yesterday, might have been lucky but didn’t have any issues
---
It is annoying, but given the game needs to load the world before it can try to load your camp I'm not sure there's a way to fix it.
---
I thought it went without saying that I was talking about leveling when there isn't a universal buff to xp, but ig I overestimated people like you. I'll spell it out for ya just in case you still don't get it: "I was talking about leveling when there isn't a universal buff to xp." Smh kids these days.
---
That would be great i really appreciate that just to comfirm it is the helmet right ? Not the mask ?
---
Also, why can I see what I'm unlocking in advance in seasons but not in NW? I never play NW, so maybe I'm just being blind, but there's nowhere to actually see what unlocks when you rank up?
---
If the Fallout TV series is the only reason you subscribed to Anazon Prime then I think you might have jumped the gun by about 2 years. lol. They just inked the deal.
---
That would be great thank you is it for the helmet or the outfit ?
---
You have a point! I’ve taken more than a few breaks from this game and currently on one right now. Tired of the same exact farming experiences every day. Maybe launching a nuke will spark some more joy!
---
Same here.
---
This would be awesome. A chance that you can't event make it through the events should be a possibility. So you don't always walk away with something.
---
Personally, I like anthologies more than serials.  There's a time and a place for each, but I feel the latter is overdone as networks try to cater to binge watching or FOMO, and it rarely seems to meet the increasingly high expectations of viewers in the long run.
---
You could always have a constant cast that meets new characters along the way, like Star Trek.  Or some mysterious reference that flows between episodes and culminates in the season finale, like Doctor Who's Bad Wolf.  But I do like it when sci-fi presents me with exciting or twisted new ideas, and having a series that's mostly free from the baggage of what happened in episodes prior allows them to better explore whatever they want *now*.
---
This worked, thanks!
---
Did they remove the event? I knew about this for like 2 weeks but I wasn’t really able to use it since I had to work a lot. Now that my holidays have begun and I can play 10 hours a day, I didn’t see the event a single time. Is it super bad luck or has Bethesda noticed the glitch?
---
I looked up Mosaic tiles and , yes, this is exactly what I'm seeking.
---
My point is that in NW the only time you see that progress bar is at the end of the match. You cant just check the stats tab in the pip boy like you can in adventure mode.
---
fallout 1st 1 year subscription costs me around $150 here for no reason.
---
No prob, Bob
---
According to their site, it doesn't stand for anything. They're just trying to make it have a Fallout feel to it without putting any actual thought into it. They've fired the real devs and hired mobile game devs.
---
For sure, I'll let you know.
---
All I fucking want is stairs that arent slap bang in the middle of what is wrong with having them to the left or the right of a wall? Also another infuriating this is not being able to put posters above magazine racks or display cases
---
THE WALL IS MY FUCKING SUPPORT WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
---
I know :) it was just a spur of the moment use of 3 euros. Maybe something's good on there...
---
I've started shooting people in the face when they ask me for a bunch of bobby pins and all they give me in return is a desk fan.
---
...Sorry, couldn't resist.
---
I think usually they're listed in one of the challenges tabs like combat or something? I forget which one..
---
Made a post above or below outlining the route I take and another one with the buffs I use, check it out.
---
That’s what I like about this game too. I’m like level 113 and last night I was playing with a couple of fellows in the 200-300 level and even though I’m obviously not new new, I haven’t been around as long as they have and they were still throwing stuff my way. I always try to pay it forward as well👍
---
Yeah I know of hacked weapons just didn’t know they could go that far and yeah I love my legacy lasers
---
This is where I woke up when I was completing the Nukashine quest
---
Having two pieces of armor with the "Reduce Fall Damage by 50%" perk.
---
That, and Power Armor, are the only two ways I know of that render you completely immune to falls.
---
(looks at jar of bottle caps)
---
probably should look into a bomb shelter of sorts...
---
heh, nah, but It did spur an interest in the many cryptids in the game, youtube had a lot of old history/discovery channel docs on them
---
Yes it does exist, and I believe it can be on any piece of armor, not just legs. Source: I'm currently running with the effect on one arm and one on a leg and I'm sure I've seen it on other pieces too.
---
Oof, I wish I saw this earlier
---
i've literally just finished. Currently standing here with 1027/396. Making my way upstairs to scrap ALL the things. 
---
this trick has mostly not been working for me. This time i moved my tent to that position before it started. And BOOWM! Fish. Barrel!
---
Were you online at reset time or did you log in just after?
---
Happened to me yesterday and now today too. RIP nearly 2k score points
---
Because of this post I got that glowy skelly outfit. Thank you, sir!
---
Yeah I thought it might have been added with that content since there is an empty nukashine bottle
---
I'm saving up scrip for the upcoming purveyor sale (thank god no mystery pick). I'm honestly debating uninstalling if I don't get anything useful.
---
Great, kid. Don't get cocky.
---
Were you online at reset time?
---
I look for lower level players, when I find one, I drop all the plans I've collected.
---
I do a lot of events, **A-LOT**, so I'm always carrying a bunch, LOL!
---
You're using way too many qol perks. Adrenaline in agility (when it's fixed) can give you up to 60% damage and bloody mess in luck is a flat 15% damage on everything. You don't need the likes of travelling pharmacy with backpack mods. Tenderiser and gun Fu will also give you a boost (not so much the latter if you don't use vats). My general advise would be to drop the qol perks and look for more damage perks, use mutations and maybe go junkies if you don't want to commit to bloodied (50% damage with 5 addictions of your choosing). Hope that helps, if you need any more help let me know!
---
Yes yesterday, no today.
---
Yeah, it's one heck of a rush, but as t stands, I know I *think* every plan in the game that can be sold. There're still plenty of Gold Bullion plans I don't have but, at least for now, you can't kick those around. 
---
I miss that rush.
---
Awesome man! That’s some NW dedication! Glad I was able to help!!
---
I was online at reset time, but I wasn't doing anything, I was in my camp waiting the last couple of minutes for reset. I've tried relogging to see if they uncomplete but no such luck .
---
Sort of. I also wanted to see if I could unlock the winter jacket that I was a few hundred points away from getting when they ended those limited time rewards... but I lost interest very quickly...
---
Hurray!
---
What time did you log in at?, if you don't me asking. 
---
Reftesh was 10 mins ago.
---
Ah, sorry i misunderstood! Yeah that would be handy, and something to check to pass the time!
---
Only 3 minutes ago, I logged out 10 minutes before reset thinking itd save me 😂
---
I really hope it doesn't happen when the weekly reset rolls around. As Cam2910 asked, were you online when it happened? Maybe the trick is to not be logged in during the reset period.
---
I had this exact issue last night 😒. But it went away after I built another foundation piece (now I can scrap that piece because "something attached won't be accessible") 
---
Note: Nothing is attached to it 🤣🤣
---
Thanks, I've been asking as many people as I can to see if I can find a way to avoid it. I put a PSA out earlier to try and warn people, but your experience at least confirms to avoid being online at reset time.
---
Yeah, my stuff is always 50 or less. I just drop regular stuff around train stations, but good stuff like pa and mods, ultralight, drop pocket, etc, 50 caps.
---
Only open them for weeklys or in need. They nothing!
---
If you don’t make it, you spend atoms.
---
If bugs are the fault of you not making it, and it pisses you off enough, you quit and never give Bethesda another cent of your money.
---
Or you play during double xp weekend and double daily weekend and make up some of the slack.
---
Did you play NW before the reset and before you logged into that character?
---
Seems that way, though today I logged in shortly after reset and still got hit by it. Probably safe to leave it for a half hour around reset 😅
---
This is so dumb. I lost 4 dailys not knowing this
---
Seems like we may need to give it a bit more than a few minutes then. Thanks.
---
You didn’t
---
i'd like a vision of several time eras.
---
before the great war, during the great winter, the NCR period.
---
I'm looking at you, Razorgrain.
---
Huh, if it's give ng you the score, that's nifty tbh.
---
I did.  
---
Put some Serums in my machine for under 300 caps for players to actually use (yea, sometimes a high level Comes along and buys them all - instant profit for both of us, I suppose)
---
And I sell some to the Bots for about 500. (Grape Mentats+charisma boosting alcohol)
---
Any place near a source of water. I'm not and regret it but still like my spot.
---
Now realize just how tasty people taste and oh so practical on a daily basis...
---
Off to the shops  🙈🙉🙊🤮
---
I'm assuming you were online and now have bugged dailies. Sorry to hear it.
---
You mean you cheated.  If there were no duping the game would be much better.  You guys ruin it.
---
Exactly.  To be perfectly blunt regarding these drips.  They house a solitary brain cell, that fights for it's own dominance, in a body that just exits as a walking waste of oxygen and semen.  The end result of this is a person that cannot achieve anything in life then being a fucking dickhead.
---
So I was scammed some score?
---
Did you play NW yesterday, or play and not login until the next day on that character?
---
The flaw in your logic is that you think any bloody builds would hide and not attack at all. If you are playing with people who think that way, and can't accept that they will die from time to time, then you should strongly suggest to them to pick a different build.
---
I was talking about your misuse of the word *literally*. You *literally* used it wrong. Hence why i said Double XP weekends.
---
Were you online when they reset 15 minutes ago? (17:00 BST)
---
I sell all plans (except power armor plans) for 25 caps an they usually sell quick
---
Survivals problem was it was a hot mess. It added a bunch of mechanics that made solo pvp basically impossible
---
I've not played NW at all, it's not my kinda thing, so I leave it to people who enjoy it.
---
Bethesda customer support in a nutshell.
---
Yep, especially if you did the event multiple times on the same server without picking up all the loot from bodies. I play on xbone as well.
---
Thanks for the help everyone! Just picked it up and about to start planning my next camp.
---
No I just logged in at half past and have been playing since. I was in the middle of a Feed The People event and when it finished I noticed the time and checked my challenges to see and 3 were already finished
---
I've been asking people who post whether they were online. It's clear that you were. All bar 1 person I've asked said they were online at refresh time, so it's probably a good idea to log off for 20 mins or so around refresh time tomorrow until they fix it properly.
---
Yeah been playing since about half four. Mate said check the challenges and the complete 5 dailies, complete an event and level up were completed about 20 seconds after they came out.
---
I was literally about to post about this! Half my challenges were already completed, including "Complete challenges 5/5" despite only 3 challenges auto completed. And I've was literally tracking my score and no, I didn't get any for these.
---
I lost 1000 score. The worst part?? After watching a Juicehead vid I learned that if you complete literally every daily and weekly challenge, you will still be short of level 100. Beth deliberately shorted us. So unless we are leveling beasts, were gonna hafta spend that ca$h.
---
I love them, but they are too heavy. :(
---
Serendipity and low health if you're a bettin' vault dweller.
---
There is a way to skip the stagger effect from falling, by using a well-timed melee attack.  I'm unsure as to whether it works with gun bash or if it can prevent fall damage (prob not).
---
I must be blind then. Could only see the 2000xp (?) challenges for the ghillie suit and stuff, not the generic level 1-2-3-4-5 stuff. Can you also not look at the challenges when you're waiting in the vault? Just brought up map selection. Don't want to to be sitting in the menu during the actual match. To be honest, nuclear winter seems cool, but the whole userface is not very simple and the time it takes to play a game? Sheesh. Why does it kick you to menu after every match? Why can't it just be a lobby you go back into with the same people. 
---
Sorry, mini rant over!
---
yep i was scammed outta 1k score which is almost a whole rank because of it 2 days ago.
---
Yeah same ones for me. Dirty how we've lost score
---
Going to try that one, thanks!
---
I've been asking people and the concensus is this is caused by being online at refresh, or by having the last game played in NW.
---
I put a PSA out on here at 4.15 (BST) to try and save a few people.
---
But that's a mule account, so i progress on the main one only
---
it doesnt.
---
Yes, but it will not disconnect them from vendor, see my other reply.
---
I'm pretty sure the first fall damage piece reduces to 50% but the 2nd piece reduces 50% to 25%.  If you're also using the goat legs perk along with two fall damage pieces it would be pretty close to zero.
---
am British and can confirm it's bullshit. I think we're all clever enough across the world now to just get used to one world-wide time. It'll take a month before some of us get used to our mornings being 7Pm.
---
That's why I find lower level players, dump them on the ground, and run! LOL!
---
Sometimes, not always, when I've given a bunch of plans away like this, the player starts asking for everything under the sun. I'm like; "I just gave you 30 plans, 20 stim packs, 10 rad-aways. and 20 purified water. And you want more? Ugh... Like I said, it's only happened a handful of times, but happen it does, LOL!
---
Why’s that
---
log off before 12 pm eastern.. log back in 12:30 eastern usually helps your dailies to NOT auto complete.
---
Maybe they won’t find a way to fix it, but it feels like they have simply REMOVED the event. I didn’t see it in the last 25 ingame hours
---
You realise we are on day 4 of a 10 week event and most people are 1/10th the way
---
It seems like just being online at refresh time is causing this. Sorry to hear it.
---
I've invited a random old man to live at my house in real life and just wander around making inane quips. It's going ok so far
---
Gonna make sure I go offline just before, thanks
---
So in the hour before reset, did you complete an event and level up by any chance?
---
Where?
---
Flatwoods, there are loads about in there from the responder story stuff. 
---
If oyu run straight down the main road from Wayward, stay on that road and you'll come to a lone house with a porch on the left at some point with a dead body. There's one on the body, one on the table.
---
I did complete an event, I couldn't say for sure whether I levelled up or not, but there's a good chance I did.
---
No you were fucked over by Bethesda’s shitty (if it exists) internal testing.  Scam indicates intent.  Don’t attribute to malice what can more easily be attributed to incompetence.
---
As the proud owner of a TSE gatling plasma, they are fantastic to see.
---
There are also hacked ones that have additional splitters and the like.  You know those when you see them though.  The sky lights up with flak.
---
What's done is done, but on pc, it's something to look out for.  I'm not into pvp, but I still take close inspection of every weapon I see that interests me.  Mostly for curiosity sake.
---
Since I 1 shot everything but SBQ, Im not worried about "real builds", but thanks for the input.
---
Same. This game is so broken. Ugh.
---
I doubt they will just let us in their ranks because like i said at this stage in the fo unicverse the brother hood is very elitest i will say that the only thing we have is the brightest mines in america is stored in 76 which is excatly why we start with a 1 in all specials
---
No, I meant overall, but it seem one cannot see exactly. Thanks for replying though.
---
Maybe it just showed up in my atomic shop because I already own it then. I just bought them a couple weeks ago, I’m sure they’ll return in the future.
---
Yes and you realise the amount of XP gets higher with each level?
---
What if I have it already?
---
What? Communism is a stateless, classless society. Socialism is a way to transition to it.
---
Its the same for Project Paradise and Radiation Rumble - even when people know what they're doing sometimes things don't always go so good.  More so for Radiation Rumble currently.
---
Oh yeah 👍 I did this to a Bloodied Combat Rifle on an alt of mine and it's gloriously fun and effective.
---
Yea, that seems to be the only thing and it seems there is no way to see one's overall experience. Pity. Thank yoy for replying.
---
I just want my camp items to know I support them. Their lifestyle is their choice. Now, please, let me put this fucking poster on the wall. It's supported.
---
Same here, and will the game let me screenshot the challenge page?! GRRRRRRR!
---
By 25 points per level it seems
---
Doesn't matter. Just pick it up and it'll complete the daily (I assume that's what it's for).
---
Fair enough, bethsada do enjoy fucking customers
---
Unless you drop the nuke
---
Nope. I run a bloodied build and before I had any perks, mods, or legendary, falling off of slight declines were the death of me. I got two pieces of armor with the fall damage reduction and take absolutely no damage what-so-ever now.
---
Game not build around to have ah.. there an economy build around legendary and ammo , the current system is just fine 
---
You know there other online game elder scrolls online doesn’t have one even though players been asking for years
---
The current vendor system is just fine
---
So will nothing happen if he does end up getting to the top? Besides, it seems a little bit...unfair on how he is zooming across. At least go 3 spaces a day. Nothing more, so that people can catch up.
---
Thanks for the heads up 👍🏼
---
Patch notes stated this is fixed, but I’m not risking it!
---
CHALLENGES
---
General: Fixed an issue that could cause Daily and Weekly Challenges to complete themselves automatically
---
Sorry to be a geek, but... 
---
Lvl 10 requires 9900 SCORE out of 220,275.
---
So level 10 is actually less than 1/20th of the way there.
---
Lol the blueprint thing is pointless, 90% of the time it’s something that can’t be properly placed.
---
dump the qol in favor of damage is my rule of thumb..
---
Yes but as with every pass the first 20 or so tiers are meant to be breezed through. I just don't have the time to be playing every single day, so when I lose dailys to bugs that SHOULD be fixed. Its frustrating
---
Am i the only one who cant see this image porperly?
---
Where you should put your camp will depend on where your at in the game. If you're still working on the main story and side quests it makes more sense just to move your camp around the map with you. If you've hit the end game you'll want a spot that's advantageous to how you like to play. For example I have mine on a lead deposit in the Savage Divide because of the resource and it's proximity to West Tek and Huntersville. It's also a near several random encounter spots that I can farm, and I have a very useful route from my camp to the Bog. But again, this is an optimal spot that suits my play style. You'll want to look at the places you tend to go on any given session and find a spot that's convenient for them.
---
Im at lv 13 it says 1350 needed
---
It's a joke of a system
---
Beth screwed us, again. So after watching a Juicehead vid, someone did the math and even if we complete literally every daily and weekly challenge we will be short of level 100. And you only get 100 score per 10k experience.  Getting to 100 without spending CA$H is going to be nearly impossible, even for the most hardcore.
---
Tip: it will cost 150 atoms per level. The highest levels cost the most score, so don't buy any levels until the very last possible day to maximize the value.
---
Church
---
I mean of the total.
---
Ha yeah exactly
---
The grind to get the t65 power armor was insane.  And I’m not sure if it was worth it.  I’ve got another character with all the secret service pieces unlocked but now I’m stuck with shitty rolls from modules.  Just seems pointless to grind anymore
---
Update: Yes, that worked!  They appeared in the Challenges section after I finished the tadpole quest.  Thank you, again!
---
A guy offered me 30k plus a bloodied handmade so I’m not too sure
---
Seems to be way worse with the introduction of public teams. It feels like the more players that are in an area fighting the same relative group of enemies, the more rubberbanding that occurs. (Maybe it's been like this all along - I haven't really grouped up much until recently.)
---
Some of the levels give 150 atoms, basically free levels right? And it's not all that bad, there's a double daily score weekend and a double xp weekend. Stack all the buffs up, lunchboxes, stew, sleeping, inspirational perk and an events team and you can get some great xp, especially on double xp weekend.
---
I played when it first came out, is it harder to launch nukes now or do you just not want to? I also love the nice side of this sub. But when I had this on ps4 when it came out I could solo nuke silos in 30ish minutes. And I didn’t go crazy with perks or legendary weapons. Just marsupial rifleman and Rifleman expert so I just want clarification
---
eh whenever I'm at a train station and I have to take a short comfort break I usually have my character sit on a bench and open the Pip Boy. To anyone seeing me, it looks as if I'm on my phone while waiting for a train.
---
i assumed it was because I was shooting more due to adrenaline being borked
---
Yep, if it’s not an insanely high level from me it’s 10 caps, 5 for something super common (or 0, like Chem Station plans), recipes are 5 caps. Even moderate weapons and the like are at least affordable, think I sold minigun plans and things like that for like 25 caps. Only things I put for high caps are Starred items, everything else is rather just sell cheap and get rid of, especially if it helps others. You still need to level up and get the perk cards to build half the stuff anyways so might as well not make getting the plans difficult.
---
Don't really see any practical way they could do it on public servers.
---
Agreed the fact of something so simple as challenges and season pass could be so bugged  is laughable
---
You don't think that one of the most popular factions will be join able? Hahahahahahahahahahaha
---
And you are calling game mechanics story canon? Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha....
---
Breath.....
---
Hahahahahahahahahahahavagagagagaga
---
Bethesda:  "What's your favorite idea? Mine is being creative"
---
FO76 Players:  "Come on guys, let's get creative"
---
Bethesda:  "Now let's all agree to never be creative again"
---
Yeah I heard about that. I don’t use adrenaline. So I hadn’t experienced it firsthand.
---
I love everything about this idea. It both allows for an occasional auction house type location and prevents the issues that would generally come with such a convenience. 
---
Personally I'd love to see the Blue Ridge Company run it because I like that faction a lot and would love to see them get more involvement in the game than just one quest. It'd also make sense, as currently their caravans don't actually accomplish anything once they exit the tunnel, and this way would implement them into the rest of the game world. Maybe we could have a bit of extra dialogue with the merchants we've walked the tunnel with dozens of times and learn a bit more about them. As far as characters go, those six feel like some of the most human in the game with their authentic-sounding banter among one another during Riding Shotgun. 
---
If it were to be the Blue Ridge running the market event, it would also allow for some of the other faction specific items to be given as rewards- like the barrels and crates with their logo, the standing flags they have, or the hat Eugenie wears (which isn't exactly Blue Ridge exclusive as raiders and blood eagles sometimes wear it, but I always think of it as the Eugenie hat.) We could earn some things to help decorate our camps more like a Blue Ridge trading post in addition to the one wall flag we have so far, allowing us to feel like part of the faction. Vinny could even host the whole thing and make announcements for the events/ mini games on a radio in that Joe Pesci voice of his.
---
This is bugged, got no reward
---
I thought I was losing dailes but id randomly get the xp for them
---
That's about the only thing I remember from that movie besides the ending. I wish I could unwatch it entirely.
---
Check it out on Nexus Mods. New update out Wednedsay.
---
No, you're a normal person. There is nothing wrong with getting burned out and taking a break. On the contrary, if it feels like a job, move on, if you can. :)
---
Personally, I've accepted that I won't get to 100 because I can't play every day. If I make it anyways, because there is a chance that Bethesda might add other ways to earn score, I'll be pleasently surprised.
---
Nah it shouldn’t be harder than it was. And I can 1 shot all the robots no problem, it’s just something I never got around to (I say that but In reality i ignored it) but had some chats with a few folks and they gave me a bit of a motivational boost to do it! And everyone was 100% friendly
---
I've had 3 weekly challenges that I completed, they appeared completed, but I got no reward. Decided not to bother in future. I will just get on with the game.
---
25% off Purveyor sale July 9th. Start saving up that scrip.
---
The entire score system is flawed and broken
---
I got a gauss rifle from the exchange.
---
Thats a different bug. It'll complete but won't give you the XP until you complete the stage of another daily. 
---
Thats mainly a visual bug, this one is a genuine bug that completes them but doesn't award XP at all.
---
Umm that still wrong since each amount increases per rank.
---
It shows how much they care
---
It’s fast for me, too, but that’s not the point. It’s simple bad UI design to make it that complicated/tedious.
---
I should NOT have to log off just prior to update time.
---
More annoyingly is the help page which says Betheada Customer Sevices will not be able to adjust S.C.O.R.E. Going through the Devs support ticket page is not inspiring me with any confidence of seeing my 1000 lost S.C.O.R.E any time soon.
---
Ive realised I dont need to spend so much time cooking, and can instead survive just fine on old cans of dog food.
---
near water, and inside the safe (none nuke zone) is pretty good. After having my camp nuked just a few times, and rebuilding everything, i moved it to the safe zone.
---
green zone on map:
---
https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/3/37/FO76-nuke-protected-zone.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190216194951
---
They have been doing that for me and my friend for a long time.  As long as we are on a team a in close proximity to each other we have both always gotten loot.  Nice perk...
---
Sorry this happened to you. 
---
Were you online at refresh time? I've been asking people to try to confirm what's causing it. I put a PSA out earlier to try to get people to log off as almost everyone yesterday that had the issue said they were online.
---
I haven't felt a difference
---
Ehh specifically my TS handmade. I know TS weapons durabilities go down faster but with the handmade it just melts. Had to repair 2 times in a sbq fight
---
Same here, let me know if you can find a way to fix it
---
I was thinking the same, but instead im thinking of just relocating to a less popular C.A.M.P build area. At the moment mines just south of Whitespring next to the snake ilustration on the map.
---
My audio holo auto completed
---
It just works
---
As daft as it sounds have you tried loading up a different online game, then back to FO76.
---
Well i've done it 5 or 6 times in the last 2 days. It is definitely still there. If you're hopping servers it is easy to miss.
---
Perhaps Bethesda hoped the Crater and Foundation would be hang out hubs, but no-one does. 
---
WS train station is a good social/meeting spot so as another comment said, maybe have something in that area.
---
Cushioned doesn’t work
---
I have too, a few times, but sometimes what you get isn't worth 20 bobby pins. I don't need a non-legendary gun so I've stopped giving them bobby pins when they ask. Was just making a joke in response to the post.
---
 ok, you say i'm not playing when the challenges are restarted, yes, i thought the same
---
Nope. Wnt straight to Flatwoods (down the road from base) colelcted one of the responder story ones and it worked straight away.
---
You have to grab a pre-Wastelanders tape.
---
For some reason, Wastelander ones don’t work
---
I've traded for every weapon I currently use. My favorite right now is my junkies ffr railway rifle. I've been using that as my primary over my junkies fixers and Handmades. Go it in a trade package.
---
Camp the spot legendary enemies spawn
---
Alot of MMOs are going down the path of having randomly generated dungeons. For example, Final Fantasy 14, Diablo 3, and world of warcraft (will have this with the next patch). So  the layout and the enemies of the dungeon will be randomly generated each time you do it. This would be really fun to incorporate into FO76 especially if you allow the dungeon to be completed as a group.
---
   
---
yes, also, they only support in english, and if my english is not good?
---
Haha yeah i feel you. I give them anyway because i always play a do-good character and I don’t have use for all those bobby pins anyway. Locked containers are surprisingly less interesting than in FO4.
---
Ha, sounds about right eh. That was jsut the easiet and most convenient for me so I didn't see any issue, but at least it'll help others to know.
---
Is there anything else I have to do with the fallout76 ini file besides save changes? I set enlighten to 0 but it changes back to 1 every time. Maybe I'm just being stupid but 4 times the same and I'm not able to see what am I doing wrong.
---
This doesn't happen with fallout76prefs ini tho.
---
Up until Tuesday I had a blast doing my own thing every day, chillin, farming, killing shit in the wasteland . With adrenaline and sneak being broken, I'm taking my first break , 4200 hours of fallout76. I'll gladly continue playing once those perks are fixed. I have five characters that I play in rotation, all five use adrenaline, two use sneak. That's a total of 31 perk points that I'd have to move to make my characters somewhat playable. The damage increased from adrenaline saves me a lot on ammo, I don't want to feel like a low level again. So I'll take this break until they fix my perks. Much less frustrating than rebuilding my characters because of developer incompetence.
---
Honestly, even RDO's battle pass wasn't this grindy, &amp; that game is grindy asf. I played the 2nd Outlaw Pass bc I had no idea (or desire to spend bars) what it was at first lol. Anyway, it allows you to progress through only xp, w 1200 needed for each rank of 100 ranks. Obv xp gains are totally different in each game, which is why we use SCORE. But it was nice &amp; comfy grinding. Plus if you did a bunch of collections you could rank up at an insane speed.
---
Had to repair my TSE 50 cal 4 times. Used up 4000 rounds of ammo :(
---
Happened to me too. Finished an event about 10 minutes before reset, decided to go to the main menu and make myself some lunch. Hopped back shortly after reset and saw that I only had 4 challenges to do. Decided to do the NW one quick and see if the adventure ones would  update only to see that I had "completed" 1000 score worth of challenges with no score being awarded.
---
Don't even feel like getting those measly 750 points that I can get, especially after seeing that the holotape one isn't rewarding for people either.
---
Im pretty sure gatling goes to 45 right?
---
Can confirm, thanks!
---
I love that, I understand now, and I gotta admit it takes awhile, and I personally don’t reap any reward from lunching a nuke, I really do like the support here though
---
What is you definition of "progress"? And to what goal?
---
FO76 has no endgame, sadly.
---
Que? Didn’t auto complete for me, and I’ve been in NW all day. 
---
Wonder what actually causes this bug... I’ve never experienced it.
---
No, it adds to 100%
---
You could also do a costume contest (similar to the 'trial of style' in world of warcraft). Basically, you enter an event and the players in the event will vote on the nicest costume. Sometimes, it may ask you to dress up for a certain theme.
---
Another idea I had is maybe CAMP Contests. Every once in awhile, they could set up an event where players are assigned a workshop to build up using a specific theme. You then have all the participants of the event vote to see which one they like the most.
---
This!!!^ Coming from Fallout 4's building system to Fallout 76's feels restrictive enough, thinking you can place something when you really can't is so annoying
---
Ya, I was online chillin in my camp waiting for the reset. I saw another thread where a player logged off, waited, then logged on after and still lost the score.
---
I have a sinking feeling before every update in anticipation of the tidal wave of bugs to add to the list.
---
or allow things to clip a little bit. eso does and you can create amazing camps.
---
Yea I made a guy after Rick and then I turned myself into a pickle
---
Intel I 7, 16 gbs ram, GeForce mx150
---
And by the way, you suck at Fallout lore 
---
We actually know next to nothing about the Brotherhood at all from this period. For all we know, they become isolationists exactly because they let this WV Chapter just let everyone in. 
---
And there is an entry on the Oberseer's vault computer with someone complaining about how they have multiple advanced degrees but just can't seem to upgrade his job from janitor to soda jerk. That's why I used thise examples
---
Is there anyway I can help keep my laptop cool
---
I like the idea just wish we toggle the amounts up rather than sell 12 get pushed out go back sell 12 get pushed out go back sell 12 get pushed out go back sell 12 get pushed out go back sell 12 ....... And the same in the other side for exchanging points.
---
That might be the issue then, TS weapons suck at durability as they shoot twice as much. I think angry turtle had a video on it. That’s why I prefer bloodied weapons, or if I’m full HP I use furious weapons on the sbq
---
Yes, 10 levels give 150 each, for a total of 1500. That will buy the last 10 levels. So really, we only need to reach level 90 organically.
---
the problem is not that the bugs are not reported or well documented, is that they are unable or unwilling to fix them. Theres a thread with several pages of known bugs
---
This, proximity is key.
---
They didn’t break this quickly before patch 20 , only after.
---
He's feeling a little tied down as of late
---
I usually always play a good guy and my main is, but after finishing the settlers side of Wastelanders I made a raider and just to keep with the character I'll generally shoot every settler or scavenger I come in contact with while playing him. After I get their soup or treasure maps, of course.
---
 And I fully agree, picking locks is a lot less rewarding in 76 than it was in previous FO games. Hardly worth the time fiddling with a lock just to get a couple plates and a box of abraxo. My main has max lockpicking skill but I never even swap those cards in because it's not worth the time it takes to go into the menu, rearrange perks, open a box for two bits of junk, then mess around in the perks menu again.
---
Ah I see! Hmm.. yeah you’re probably right. May be nerfed
---
I've just received one now . Some random guy told me it's worth a fortune.. dose anyone know the actual value
---
Guess we can add this to the list of fucked up premium items Bethesda found fit to release. Along with my handmade thats missing the fucking bolt carrier and is just wise open....
---
Except they are? Straight from the [June ITV:](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7qsXgBQHeBSeM9uXichgZj/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-june-updates?utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_content=Bethesda%20Game%20Studios&amp;utm_source=Community&amp;sf123871915=1)
---
"We are also looking into creating new Legendary Perks and changing some existing ones based on community discussions."
---
Pass the buck was broken long before 20
---
Yeah it's fallen into exactly the same trap as Destiny 2. Just making us re-do the same content over and over. Wastelanders was fun because it was fresh and I legit played through a new character to level 60+ 3 times just to experience everything. That was coming away from Destiny 2 and the ridiculous seasons but it's just happened all over again.
---
But I’m earning Halloween and Xmas rewards in NW so looks like I’m grinding NW
---
Trust me, I take back the sorry to be a geek. I am a geek, I know.
---
You start at level 1. So to get to level 10 you need 9 rank ups.
---
So to calculate the total required SCORE you need to find the series sum of 1000+25*n for n=0 to n=8.
---
Or with this few levels
---
1000 (lvl 2) + 1025 (lvl 3) + 1050 (lvl 4) + 1075 (lvl 5) + 1100 (lvl 6) +1125 (lvl 7) + 1150 (lvl 8) + 1175 (lvl 9) + 1200 (lvl 10) =9900.
---
And don't forget fissure sites, they all have a chance to spawn a legendary scorchbeast
---
You stole my fast travel ritual
---
for me it all goes in a paper bag in front of vault 76
---
I make mine 11 caps. Tax you know.
---
I haven't been able to sink the barrels since switching to steam after wastelanders so that one is not attribute to 20 for me.
---
Tbh, they did push them back due to the feedback they got from people. I’m hoping that they’re reworking them to make people actually want some of the perks.
---
Personally I want a perk car for more stash space or camp budget.
---
Same thing happens to me near the Rusty Pick.  I've tried all their troubleshooting steps.  I have both Steam and Bethesda versions and it happens on both.  Sent a support ticket and havent heard back in two days.
---
Here's a youtube link of what's happened.  I can make a new character and log in just fine.
---
 [https://youtu.be/4R346e5siLo](https://youtu.be/4R346e5siLo)
---
well, it is supposed to. just put it on the pile of mods that do not work. like the Explosive Vents for every model of Power armor
---
Pass the buck has been like that since Wastelanders launched at least. Buried with honour there's usual a shovel behind the tree near the open grave, else there's loads all over the place.
---
having 5 characters really helps you spread the load of completing all the challenges. 
---
Keep an intentionally low level if you have to move your camp three times in one day, level in flatwoods or water park under level 20.
---
Like like like like this post.
---
Same lost my challenges for the day lol
---
My theory is we need to give it a good 20 minutes after reset time. Or it may also be caused by having been logged into NW for the previous session. 
---
Thanks for replying.
---
Ok that makes more sense
---
Felt the same before I put it down. It just feels like a gimmick to keep the servers populated. Go do things I've already done so I can check them off a list? Games used to be an escape from things like that. Overall, I'm just over the fetch quest model overall.
---
I can’t wait for cyberpunk. With it being delayed so many times I bet it’s perfect.
---
And yet here you are arguing with a guy named falloutforever, if it wasn't your main point then what was, the rest of your comment was pretty pointless just like every punch you attack with.
---
Admit it you've lost
---
DEAL WITH IT!
---
Usually sell my plans from 10-50 for basic plans, and upwards to 150 for some of the rarer ones!

Here is my slight variation of what I use:  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f343f5b&amp;d=sq2s32sr2ip2ib4lt2a72a01s10l71lu2pe2cr0cu0ls2ce0ee2sg2ir2id2s01s20](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f343f5b&amp;d=sq2s32sr2ip2ib4lt2a72a01s10l71lu2pe2cr0cu0ls2ce0ee2sg2ir2id2s01s20)   
---
The problem is unlike other fallout games in order to be strong especially in end game you can't get away with being a jack of all trades so many quality of life perks like weight reduction, more food etc. and even though they feel as though you can't live without them there are ways to make things easier. Also you need to specialize on a weapon class which you have which is good! Here are common concerns I had when giving up on quality of life perks but how I got around it.
---
Strong back perk: instead use power armor with calibrated shocks mods and you'll still have around \~340 even with X01 or more with excavator
---
Travelling pharmacy/First aid: When having life giver and speed demon mutation you get instant health regen for some reason and as a result you almost never die even at low health so you don't require these perks since you don't need to have stimpacks on you and if you need them to revive people just carry a few diluted on you....also while running around at this very low health in order to get health regen there are many mutations that help you resist incoming damage and you deal more damage so this build is very useful
---
Slow metabolizer: Get something like the carnivore mutation perk so that hunger from eating meat is more effective and just pick up ionized meat when doing nuke runs and you'll never have to worry about food again
---
\*the one quality of life perk I can't do without is ammo reduction like bandolier and batteries included because of all the ammo I carry plus fusion cores for power armor
---
So overall especially when you get good weapons you can easily solo the scorch beast queen with this build, you'll never die even if you go afk in a fight surrounded by as many enemies as you can think of, you'll be able to carry plenty of loot and never be hungry if you have the right mutations in effect. The one down side is posion damage.....be aware of mirelurks and stingwings because they can kill you fairly effectively but as long as you see them first you'll shread them with this build
---
Oh shut up you woke liberal moron.
---
No it means less free atoms are being spent and that is why we have a bunch of trash in it watch after the first season Bethesda will pull out a bunch of nice items and vaulted items and they are counting on us wasting our freebies by end of first season.
---
I'm actually running into an issue with "Build up a camp or workshop." It's stuck at 3/5 even though I've filled nearly half the workshops building capacity.
---
It’s an hour later than it was before patch 20 dropped (the most time zone-agnostic description I can come up with)
---
They program the game that way intentionally. It's all just a series of if-then statements. It's to keep you coming back.
---
What time did you log in? And were you in NW the last time you played if you don't mind me asking.
---
Im non-subtly hinting they should have just had singleplayer and should probably just implement it at some point.
---
How do you earn those rewards!
---
I was logged in during reset playing NW
---
This is weird lol
---
You do if you want to complete the season. Which btw is clearly what they are talking about...
---
People did warn people on here not to be logged into game when dailies reset as it will complete them and not give you score. It's happened last couple days
---
I didn’t hop, 4 hours on the same server on average I’d say, still no line in the sand. Many feed the people, many heart of the swamp, guided meditation as well, all this stuff but never line in the sand, it is so frustrating
---
What like build 5 floor decorations? Ho into CAMP build put 5 floor decks down can be the same then delete them
---
Okay. My theory (supported by almost everyone that's posted about this today and yesterday) is that playing during refresh time causes this, and you're safe if you log off shortly before refresh and log back on 20 minutes after. (Might be less but I've personally tested 20m both days).
---
Literally just playing NW. so far since yesterday I got I think atleast 8. Weapon skins/Camp items. I love seasonal cosmetics and I missed the holidays so This is AMAZING
---
Damn. I’ve been browsing this sub too. Oh well. Better luck tomorrow I guess
---
There's a subset of challenges to the right when you select it in the menu. Tells you what to build and what quantities are required.
---
Buried with honor I did yesterday and their was a shovel against the graves behind nott next to
---
I'm pretty sure it's been disproven that you can't get to 100 without spending atoms. It's a grind but it's doable.
---
Challenge accepted
---
Its not a great experience because when your char gets to a certain age every menu in the game becomes impossible to navigate. Crafting goes so slow it can take an hour to make 100 glowing meat steaks and it is just generally in a terrible refinement condition. (And I have thousands of hour and love the game but hate its current condition/path.)
---
Challenge says "Build up a workshop or C.A.M.P"
---
Thanks. Now just to find out where to reliably get one. I'm thinking the one near Vendor Bot Resin.
---
Yep I agree, gives me option to dump them but still gotta take them Somewhere
---
Right?
---
Anyone can help with this? I can't seem to find one.
---
They’re pretty much everywhere. I did Watoga, others did Flatwoods Survivor stories
---
Actually know that I think on it, I did notice that. My bad I forgot.
---
Even unarmed weapons too. I used 2 repair kits ytd and before i could last more than one whole day using it
---
If you don't mind me asking what time did they log on?
---
Try Flatwoods, check bodies for Survivor Stories. Or kill and loot a Responder Protectron.
---
Searching is not very efficient because of the way they load on the page. You might be looking for 001 instead of 0001.
---
Are you wearing power armour? Mine bugged out and I had to exit my PA before I could interact with the terminal.
---
they should just use the algorithm that decides if it turns green or not and abandon the back end one   it's nuts that those things are separate
---
Dammit. There goes my idea of simply using my powerfist until they fixed it :/.
---
Anyone else almost halfway through the season?
---
Link please?
---
Good to know!
---
It's made to spend the 1500 atoms the board itself award for the last 10 levels of itself. It's the only logic I found. And this doing every daily and weekly.
---
You have to build multiples of some of the items.
---
Wastelanders broke Pass the Buck, it just isnt a game ending bug for most so it never caught much attention.
---
I picked a shovel up @ the grave 2 days ago for buried with honor, maybe you were on timeout?
---
Play time has been broke for ages for me too.
---
On the plus side, Dragons drop again.
---
Public teams are da bomb.
---
NW is glitched and you can get the old limited times events.
---
All in all, for a large patch imo this one brought more good than harm for a nice change.
---
Being able to rock Herd mentality and Stranger in numbers 24/7 has made losing adrenaline barely noticable.
---
The guy in the fridge in Flatwoods.
---
17:01 we know it rolls over at 5 so he logged on
---
Remember:  the devs don’t play the game, or event test it.  Auto completing challenges have been an issue for a year now.
---
I wonder if the players would have caught this if it was put on the PTS.  Perhaps....
---
I sell nothing but plans for 11 caps. I always have a ton of them, and i don't see a point in selling for high. It's not like I'm using them, and for some of them grinding can be a real pain, so why not help out others.
---
Generally speaking I enjoy a long grind like this. However, knowing that I can't take a day off in the next 10 weeks and expect to finish without spending atoms does make me wonder if its worth even trying.
---
It will be even worse when Cyberpunk and the next Warcraft expansion comes out. I hope there is nothing cool in the next season, cus I won't be able to put that kind of time into it.
---
How does it take away from the newest player? IMO you are doing a disservice to real newer players (not low level alts), because you are making it easy for them.
---
You want free plans, go grind for them. My 2 cents.
---
Yep same went from very excited to oh of course they found the most gated time consuming way to do a season.
---
Grind out settler rep to buy suit or start a new toon.  
---
Can not trade stealth suit.
---
Huh. 
---
I might Steal that idea.
---
I agree with a lot of these - I'd add as number 18:
---
We know there will be instanced CAMPs further down the line. Can one of them be a prefab bunker structure you place in your CAMP, and, one you enter through the door, this opens to an instanced interior you can place furniture in?
---
Did they get reimbursed?
---
Same thing happened.
---
ok thanks for the info
---
Since 76 uses the Creation Engine and associated files you can use a lot of the same tools as other games. For this you'll need the Bethesda Archive Extractor and the Skyrim Audio Converter. Programs that are useful for other tasks are NifSkope and a modified version of TES5Edit called FO76Edit.
---
Molotov tagging is key for maxing exp and rewards!
---
Would be awesome if they made molotov fire heal allies with the perk.
---
Tbh I’m glad it didn’t work on him Bc I enjoy seeing where he’ll lounge next
---
It’s build not place, store, re-place
---
So I should just spam one item? Or spam multi of more then one item?
---
I know and I have scraped and built a new whateve etc
---
Railway rifles are nice, I just don't like the heavy ammo. How's your experience been with trading? I don't trust people enough to be trading with strangers lol.
---
PC? I'd be willing to pay/trade for it but idk if I have enough. Been getting frustrated by the bow accuracy issue and want to transition over to using rifles at least until that gets sorted.
---
No. Look it up.
---
RIPPED many times due to this as well...
---
... No offense, but in that case, the flaw in my logic is the same as the logic used. 
---
I pointed out that some people playing bloodied are to intimidated by the low health so hide instead and a lot of them have been changing their builds to junkies. You said that is wrong because Junkies has bad special and you have high damage and dr. You're whole point was that. 
---
Also I never mentioned all bloodied builds, only some bloodied players. Never even went into any bloodied builds factually. Why is it every time someone points out the level 200 bloodied guy hiding away. Every one with the same type of build thinks its about them or take it as a attack on the build?
---
Every update it seems like they nerf weapon durability.
---
I haven’t either.  Placebo in effect?
---
The guy who reports to him is a clown
---
Ah cool. Missed them too. Thx for the heads up!
---
Ps4. You guys are killing me lol I wanna help out but can't for either of you...
---
Omg I was not expecting that! Ha ha xD
---
Nah. My shotgun that hasn’t broken in 2 full days of play broke after one west tek run. Somethings...fishy
---
Try removing all friends that are MlA , and remove alot of zero weight like maps that u dont use on a mule character.  Alot smoother for me on ps4
---
Wait I missed this...what happened to Adrenaline? That's a key part of my build.
---
It’s all good man, we are getting a double score weekend in the middle of July
---
Yea absolutely. I picked up my grandpas old levergun and started shooting these drone things before any of these tiny cargo bots Crash into any houses. Or their packages explode.
---
Keep your fellow dwellers safe!
---
They actually removed 80%
---
Just been very unlucky i guess. I've only seen radiation rumble twice in the same time. And Project paradise 3 times.
---
It tells you what you need to do. If it says 5 floor decorations, you need to do 5 floor decorations. If it is 20 lights, you need to do 20 lights, etc until you do all 5 subchallenges.
---
Boom
---
Nah, that would rely on fixed values and carpal tunnel until they implement a Craft All option
---
Well I mean those 4 days counts as 8 if it’s doubling up your daily challenges only, and if they keep the x1 repeatable, then you can probably get ahead, that’s is THE time to grind out that repeatable, if anything it should be a bigger incentive to grind as if you grind a good bit then you’ll be on the right track to get to rank 100
---
After patch 20, I now have a dead tree sticking straight through my main building on my alt-character.
---
Good to know. I read a post a while back saying that's how it worked.. and since then I've been scripping those pieces more than selling them... I'll start hanging onto them now 👍
---
Hold X on Playstation
---
Yeah I learned that today lol lost out on 1000 Score, oh well.
---
I finished them all but the holotape, it seems bugged
---
We just had this convo not too long ago! :) glad to see you spreading the word to all!
---
So. They should really put an idle timeout on this.
---
I use mutations. Just not the ones that will give me negative strength. Like bird bones.
---
Not sure ifnit shows chickens. But it produces fertiliser
---
Ive repaired my Instigating lever once in the past 3 days. Probably 10-12 hours played 5-6k ammo shot.
---
I wasnt really paying attention last night but im pretty sure im still on the top half of 200% condition.
---
Durability seems normal to me.
---
One of the power relay foundations near Point Pleasant is a fun place to build. Directly on the lake bed outside New Gad is also good if you find a nook that doesn't anger the Super Mutants and still gets you access to the creek. On the north end of the map in the Forest there's a small calderra with a pond in the middle, it's elevated and secluded, I believe you even get two friends chilling in the pond with their safe!
---
Generally the same advice stands, water sources are great not only for peak hydration, but water sells for a fair bit still if you're looking to build up cap reserves.
---
It’s a “feature” since we got the super sick ammo converter we have so much extra ammo this is to compensate
---
It's so sad they patched Nuke Mines.
---
They were the only way to deal with AFK traders
---
Jack o lantern weapon skins/bats weapon skins/Xmas wreath/dead Xmas tree/wrapping gift hunting rifle skin. They just keep dropping. Seems like every other match or every 3rd match. Assuming it has to do with XP as opposed to level
---
I do 20 across the board. 5 for all my mounted (blank) plans. 5 for all recipes
---
Why do you say they don’t play it? They do live streams of them playing it from time to time. And no tech company doesn’t test. That would be absurd. Clearly they have a QA issue but if they didn’t test the game wouldn’t function at all.
---
I sell all my plans for 1c each. Doesn't matter the type or rarity. If I know the plan already, it's not worth anything to me and it's better off with someone who needs it. Some times someone clears out my vendor but it doesn't happen often. I'm setup downhill  behind Camp McClintock so I get lots of traffic from mid-lower level players.
---
Oh wow I didn’t notice that! Thanks this community is so helpful
---
Hmm. Maybe it’s hitting certain players. Knowing Bethesda it’s possible -___-
---
I'm almost lvl 500, I completely understand your feelings. I'd suggest playing something else or take a break from it for a day or so. You'll miss it eventually:). Or maybe find something new to do? I highly suggest making a new character. Either for a mule or a new playstyle. Cheers 🍻
---
Yeah Nuka Break was really wells done. I haven't seen Red Star yet though
---
Man, I wish text chat was a thing so much. I've just bought a mic headset but I can never work out if my mic is on or not 😅
---
&gt;as opposed to the incompetent studio who's that shat out millions in garbage merchandising, fallout 76, fallout 3, fallout 4, and fallout shelter
---
Healing Factor is the culprit now
---
Todd Howard was a mistake.
---
No I’m not a PA build. I scrapped it and rebuilt it and same issue. It’s not loading past the welcome.
---
Like the feature that now Gauss hits in VATS with proper charge. It just misses more than the first shot to compensate.
---
Hahaha love it
---
I can’t tell, and also want to know
---
Oh no, the communism expert has entered the chat
---
What is God roll?
---
Social Credit Of (the) Real Enclave
---
While im not affected by this. Imagine the amount of players who don't use reddit who get hit by this bug.
---
Yeah I can agree with that.  I’m often looking to get rid of caps because I’m close to the limit so I buy stuff I wouldn’t normally.  My favorite is buying low level legendaries and then gifting them to a person that level in game.  Anything lvl 30 or under gets gifted unless it’s crap (nocturnal I’m looking at you).
---
Instead if the workshop icon they made them location icons but they are still workshops
---
I don't sell anything for expensive prices, plans are usually less than 100 caps, ones like mounts are usually less than 30. I sell things like plasma and fusion cores for 75 caps, and ammo for 1-3 caps. I need caps too much and when I do I farm fusion cores and they usually get all bought within playtime.
---
For real... I was so excited for the farming tiles... Until I tried to place razorgrain and corn on them
---
Yes, its from lunchboxes. Also got this yesterday when a player opened lunchboxes at the scorchbeast queen event. Had +100% XP for 1 hour, which was insane. Grinded the shit out of West-Tek with server hoping as with other buffs each super mutant was giving 900 XP. I plan to save my own lunchboxes for the double XP weekend in two weeks.
---
If you haven’t already, buying legendary modules helps to prepare for future crafting and reduces the loop of purchased items taking up as much space. 
---
Consider that you’ll need the equivalent of a likely 5k scrip worth of legendary modules to get the weapon roll that you want.
---
To keep you safe from what's inside.
---
Ohh, I was being a bit thick, thank you
---
I use a str build with BB and negatives from addictions I don’t notice anything plus I get to jetpack around with zero fucks
---
It’s day 3 of these posts.
---
Could the fact that the reset was moved back an hour cause some issue?  In that people are completing challenges ahead of time in that hour, and messing up the way it rallies them.  Challenges don’t appear to be random.
---
Remember there was a bug where you could turn in wards quest repeatedly for about 15 minutes, stranger things have happened.  I’ve lost 1000 myself,
---
Why is this being down voting? This is a serious issue. 1000 lost S.C.O.R.E is equal to making 100,000 xp!)
---
Didn't catch that but definitely support it.
---
They do indeed.
---
I wonder if any of these are gonan actually come out according to the roadmap
---
SORRY, CAN ONLY RESTRICT ENTERTAINMENT
---
Yea had a guy get on the comp at encrypted and forced the timer to zero. Two people cant use the same comp now
---
I had the note that said happy fasnatch at my fasnatch vendor for 0 caps, just as a nice mesage, and someone just took it
---
Exactly. This game's issue stems from the fact of lack of fulfillment and focus. 
---
- You spend tons of time in menus. 
---
- You constantly have to sort inventory. 
---
- You struggle to make endgame builds because half your deck is dedicated to 1 weapon type and a ton of carry weight perks. 
---
- You do a bunch of quests waiting for the big "reveal" but there isn't much of one.
---
- Most dailies and events are broken. (Enemies don't spawn, or stand still/don't fight, disappear under ground)
---
This all caps off when you realize that a ton of the game is just pasted from Fallout 4. We've done a lot of this and used a lot of these weapons and items before, so it's not new. The only new thing in this game is the multiplayer, which the game doesn't really seem to emphasize well, and the quests, which as stated before are mostly broken.
---
Now you’re getting it .... lol
---
There have been a lot of complaints. I think we need to start opening up tags for these with Bethesda Support
---
That’s just sad
---
Flatwoods at the beginning of the game has them laying all over the place.
---
Honestly this is indefensible. The game knows it can't place the object but it doesn't know it without actually clicking place? It makes zero sense.
---
This is an unexcusable bug and a symptom of where the actual prioritization are for Bethesda
---
There are several ones in flatwoods one on the back porch if the house next to the bridge
---
Mhm, I should start using Molotovs instead of selling them at the first opportunity I get.
---
If you creep the sub, theres already a few duders in the low 30s.
---
If you got a decent team, are lvl 75+ and know some good exp loops it sounds do able, but grindy.
---
Im guessing we will have legit 100 rank score duders by week 4 or 5
---
I completely forgot about Flatwoods, thanks!
---
I couldn't be fucked to play this gimmick.
---
Yeah, i would usually open all locked containers the first time I explore a place but I wont care after that: plans can be be found by many other ways and they are randomnized anyway.
---
Mark as untradable/sellable. You have to drop or scrap it.
---
Sell 'em to me lol
---
Yeah if you want to this guy doesn’t seem like he wants to complete it
---
Don't look at wiki because those aren't base values
---
God roll is a term for the actually best stuff like Powered WWR armor, B2525 handmades, Fixers etc.
---
It's an untradable item, I put an extra on my companion, maybe do that?
---
Otherwise you have to just drop it
---
Well, Juicehead is wrong then.
---
https://youtu.be/UUnOYA-jFrI
---
Bethesda won't give you score, but from what I have heard they are giving people the 150 atoms to buy that level in the future.
---
probably different levels at customer-support and damage-control teams. If its only one/few users having the problem they ignore it but as soon as more CS requests regarding the same problem come in the damage-control team steps in and actually does its job for a time.
---
I love the blood eagles leather jacket, but can never see the design on the back because of the backpack lol
---
At about what time did this start? Does anyone know?
---
It's Rank 78, no one progressing legitimately would be near claiming it. Of course as we all know there's plenty of glitches out there...
---
Yes you can miss daily’s. I missed them yesterday and I have leveled up two ranks today before all of my dailies were completed. 
---
Earn XP.
---
I thought they were extremely generous with the amount they gave out. And now i'm just like. Whatever. They were free. You can still earn plenty of atoms by doing survival, combat, social and world challenges
---
I started doing this 2 looking for a bloodied fixer 3ven if it's only 1 star then I'll work up
---
With the heavy ammo I just run the ballistic ammo reduction perk. It works great. Just can't put it in my stash box lol.
---
I never make ammo. Buy it &amp; spread the caps love
---
There are 2 Prison Marshall with an holotape west of the Manhunt event
---
I think that is how Beths wanted it, unfortunately.
---
Seriously? I haven’t been able to play due to work the last couple of days. Are you telling me it is already impossible for me to bring it out to completion?
---
I am haunted by the ghost of a guitarist, and he only knows one rift.
---
This has been happening to people who were online at the time the daily missions reset (about 1.5 hours before this post)  were you logged in then?
---
Put them on a trash tan or in a blue suitcase near the starting area.. somebody will find it
---
Wish we could display our outfits and power armor like in fallout 4
---
I think level 100 reward also give you 500 atoms... but yeah it's not much still.
---
Read the posts by u/vortexofchaos
---
Im haunted by a ghost 50 cal constantly shooting lmao
---
There are way too many on this sub reddit who have seen someone actually doing math so they summarize what they said often misunderstanding it and spreading false info. It is hard to get to lvl. 100 but not impossible.
---
Find a way to use it give you free atoms or dupe some item that way and you'll see a workaround and 'attempted fix' incoming before your exploit video is even fully uploaded to YT
---
There is.....earn gold lol
---
You've answered your own question in your first sentence.
---
You can get it back, just gain 100k exp /s
---
[Here's](https://i.imgur.com/SCKegzb.jpg) a map for all the resource extractors. If you're looking for something else check out Mappalachia
---
Anything you can build, where the plans are (or can be) acquired through gold, cannot be sold or traded.
---
So you can’t sell or trade ss armor, gauss mini guns or shotguns, etc
---
Legendary items that you make based on these plans can be traded in for scrip.
---
no, it's logic. you can't program something with indefinite variables. these things have invisible hit box and navigation mesh that needs to play fair with each other or you wouldn't be able to even put your fit on a step.
---
the whole thing behind is complicated and tedious that's why you can't build any shit on 97% of the games out there. oh but a fking stair in your floating camp is some monkey programmer thing right? fk these company! amirirte?
---
I’ve always placed my plans at 5 caps, even SBQ plans. I get messages all the time from people saying nice camp and thanks for the cheap plans
---
&gt;I feel like it's practically impossible to get anything expensive in the atom shop without spending cash to buy points
---
It's a feature not a flaw (tm)
---
This does not work, you have to be out of the Vault and then level up for it to count (so basically you need to level up to 3). Not super fast/easy then...
---
It’s been disproven that you need to. Some people have managed to make it to level 30 already without exploits.
---
I mean, you’re not wrong
---
Mines over by alpine river cabins, nobody puts theirs there because of the screaming, so I've just embraced it by making my camp spoopy
---
Not to be that guy, but that's why atoms are for sale. Most of the stuff in the atom shop is aesthetic. It's definitely a money-grab move, but I see why they did it.
---
Lol I buy all your plans then put them as a drop for new ppl that way I see them pick them up and I know they get a chance at them ....much eaiser and I know who gets them. ☺
---
You get the score if u do 3/5 of the weekly challenges
---
Too late.
---
They added a bunch of new challenges too. The only ones I remember are killing 76 insects and cryptids, but I got 40 atoms from doing line in the sand today and I know I already finished all the scorched challenges so there must be another one related to that
---
I can't even scrap it. Which seems odd.
---
Im curious if they didnt balance some of the effect degrades.
---
Now that ive thought about it a bit, the AA/E gatling I use on my alt might be chewing through condition a bit faster. It is mostly for support but its hard to tell because the toon has been seeing more use to complete the SCORE challenges.
---
Ill try to pay more attention this weekend.
---
How about the system does nothing with our current perk cards but just straight up gives us a perk coin for every level.  We shouldn't have to trade build flexibility by scrapping cards, or be penalized for having moved special points instead of taking a perk.  Originally they said for every 50 levels you can get a legendary perk.  The last thing we need is another system to deal with.
---
But if you have played for a long time, you don’t have those anymore
---
I got a choice between play and pick up, worked for pick up, but not play.
---
1. Weird beeping noise everytime I pick something up.
---
2. Issue with LB/RB not being able to select items/data/radio menus
---
Would help if my weeklies actually registered and gave me the points.
---
So basically you want a trailer park.
---
Wish I could be of more help. I can only suggest removing the ammo converter, rebooting the game and then rebuilding it.
---
Fair enough. Maybe in a few weeks
---
But a lot of us bought it at launch and one of the main selling point was that you could get atoms for free.
---
Using atoms for repair kits now.
---
I used to grind the dailies so I guess my grind is easier now?... But ye would be nice if there was something more meaningful to play for. I think making weekly community challenges would help keep things a bit more fresh. Maybe something like collecting electronics from robots for a week to resupply the enclave and have stretch rewards. Maybe 50 gold bullion or 100 gold n top tier 100 gold + 250 scrip if the community hits the targets. If it had an effect on the world afterwards that'd be great. Maybe we have patrols of enclave robots spawn in as random events for the next few weeks?
---
Would be cool to just bully regular mobs too.
---
That is a total joke. How can Bugsada fail to retro reward you for autocompletion stuff ups on their end when it would be clearly impossible to do all that in 6min. !
---
i think you don't remember how to do that bc they are working since day 1 the same way that fo4 did
---
That was the main reason I redid my mutations. Well worth it to me. Now the only time I get that bug is if I try to fast-travel right after I eat or drink.
---
I'm now pretty sure we need to log off before refresh and give it a good amount of time after. I've personally tested 17:20 both days with no issues, and everyone I've asked so far has said they were either online or logged in a few minutes after refresh.
---
There are some nice lakes to the SW of Vault 76. Great for a large purifier.
---
Nope! Haven't been playing fallout since last night, hopped on at around 5:45 I think (UK so 45 mins after reset)
---
I saw that same post. However, did that post take into account the double exp weekend coming up or the double SCORE rewards weekend coming up?
---
I carry a fire axe everywhere.
---
By week two and a day there'll be tons of flex posts about people who opened up their wallets or 1st members who have a ton of Atoms saved up. Even if I had 20k Atoms I wouldn't spend them as ghillie and the PA skins are useless to me.
---
I don’t understand why we can’t just intersect some objects/have floating objects. It wouldn’t break the damn game lmao, it’s not like wanting my couch to slightly touch the wall is cheating
---
I’d just run west tek a bunch of times, you can always find legendaries there
---
I like to help other players but you can't always be generous to new players you gotta let them do things themself and not help them like its okay to help them but you think about it when the game first came out we was all grinding for those things and you got low level players just getting those things you took ages to grind for and it makes it to easy for them you got lv 10 players getting to level 100 in a matter of weeks because of how much dedicated level 500 to 400 players have been single Handly just lending them stuff telling them the best locations for things etc.
---
I sell all my plans for 20-30 caps unless their rare plans
---
my favorite by far haha
---
Anychance was this me PC IGN Sergeant-Cabbage?
---
I got cleared out last night. Sold plans from 1c-50c max.
---
Damn, it’s that bad?
---
Radiation itself won't cause it, but if you have the Ghoulish perk equipped it might seem like it.
---
It's the Lunch Box XP buff.  
---
It's pretty good, but given Lunch Boxes are in limited supply, you wanna be careful as to where/when you trigger'em.
---
That's a valid point, but there could also be other approaches, like deferring the pathing and collision tests from preventing you from doing anything until you want to commit your camp changes (Items could show up red in the meantime), which would allow building or deconstructing what you need to without running into individual parts breaking things.
---
And you can confirm this through footage or your own gameplay? No need to actually send me footage, of course. I'm just really worried that I fucked up my build.
---
He deleted his comment, what was it about? 😅
---
There will apparently also be other weekly repeatable challenges for completing public events. As well as at least 1 confirmed double xp/score weekend.
---
Definitely not the responses I expected, but this community never ceases to entertain 😂
---
Both
---
You can grind unlimted XP to get score. There are plenty of ways to level up easily in the game, some legit, others less so. The new teams also make it much easier to level up. In other words it's totally possible to complete without all the dailies though the dailies in many cases are easier.
---
Always at least one confirmed lego by doing riding shotgun. As well as some good xp.
---
Yeah, the double exp and double score seems like a good boost to balance the absence of NW.
---
Double score Weekend seems to be 3 days? So that's additional 1750*3=5250, double experience will double amount of 100 SCORE (that is if this is the weekly repeatable challenge that is there to stay indefinitely and will not change every week)
---
Just a quick update, that trick worked out pretty swell, got quite a few cobblers to share with the partner when we log in tomorrow 👍👍
---
They get it.
---
That's fair. Honestly, it does seems a bit restrictive (it isn't even enough for a power armor paint).
---
I honestly wish they spent more time into developing assets people could use to get more atoms being spent rather than reduce the number of atoms people can get.
---
I still have not paid any money for anything in the shop.    
---
I got a camo armor paint for all PA for 1200 atoms.  I still have over 1000 with the 150 I got yesterday.    
---
I only used PA during the BETA but with my new main being 47 I want to make it as stealthy as possible. The Guille skins are also something I want.
---
I’m aware but at least you were able to avoid it by just not playing nuclear winter but now you can’t even be in a adventure lobby when it resets
---
Aye. I've been giving out free herd mentality serums to people. +4 to all stats in a team with people? Yes please. And no negative effects. WIN!
---
ive been having this issue for a long time before patch 20. has been consistently terrible for me since wastelanders released.
---
Wow, that's awesome! I just hit level 25 last night 😆. It's been fun so far.
---
the support is needed for the game to recognize where to render your camp in the world alongside the camp radius if they collide with other people's camp or something. remember that this is not your solo player world you share with other people. even tho you could male it invisble you still need them bc wall logic needs a foundation
---
That is a good theory, although which would also fit with a the majority of people being online at the refresh time. There are a few people who have said they didn't log in until a couple of minutes after the refresh time (for the first time that day) who have had the bug.
---
But the majority of people who have the bug were actively playing, or had been playing and waited for refresh time. 
---
Now I'll have to start asking people when they last completed any challenges.
---
i've got 1023 hours and still have loads.
---
The easiest way to do these is to take a workshop, then spam create the things you need to. That way you don't even use your scrap since workshops have their own inventory. You can usually complete these in like one minute at a workshop, where as if your camp is max budget it will take longer building and scrapping and use your junk as well.
---
Placing them in a zip file might be good since I can't find a way to bulk download.
---
It's ridiculous. Having an indoor farming space is a key part of my CAMP, too. Need soooooo much indoor real estate for them to be worth it.
---
placing vendors behind a locked door is such a tease, just disconnect the power
---
Nevermind. I copied the one in the install folder to My Games folder and it worked.
---
Weird I picked up a holo in West Tek and it completed just fine.
---
My own gameplay. I was quite happy to pick up Ammosmith and Super Duper since the number of crafted arrows is so low. Scrounger is good, but I don't know if I'd run it all the time.
---
I have a 5 till alarm, and will alt f4 when it goes off if needed lol
---
Keep your eye open for Leader of the Pack. Starts about every hour up by Tyler county fairgrounds. Guaranteed 3 legendaries.
---
You get up to 2000 from the season...
---
I can’t even see the screen when I interact with the terminal, the camera just goes down for some reason...
---
2000*
---
A rusty car without wheels up on cement blocks, a pregnant dog living under it, a bathtub madonna next to the front porch.... what's not to love about all that?
---
Don’t think this ones been mentioned... AWOL Armaments at Roboco. Sometimes you’re lucky and no one else shows up, usually there’s 2-3 legendaries in the 3 waves. Then you can run over the road to the General Steakhouse to see if a legendary mutie is there too.
---
Alright, thanks so much! I can rest easy knowing my build isn't fucked. It's still probably pretty bad, but hey, I can make a lotta arrows! That's one thing my build is good for!
---
Good stuff, it's usually the first thing i do when i log in/switch character, works well with herbivore mutation too, doesnt boost the xp bonus but each cobbler is worth 20% food so they last a bit longer
---
Yeah it seems like some work and some dont, I got it to work picking up one in flatwoods
---
Isn't it obvious. You are supposed to buy and spend atoms. Hence why they were largely removed.
---
I bet you could on double or triple xp weekends.
---
Yup, it's one of the benefits of teams. As long as you are close to the enemy your teammates killed you can get the loot. But if you're in a different room or too far away it doesn't work, so it's a good idea to let everyone tag a 3-star just in case.
---
This happened to me already, contacted support, they couldn't give me the score back. I'm fine paying for atoms (despite 76 being a broken game for the most part)  but I would hate it if I had to pay because of bugs.
---
Yeah you can only see it at the end of a match, and there’s no way to know how much XP you need to level up. It’s just a guessing game.
---
Yup .. I play casually and over time I would happen to complete dailies/weeklies and earn atoms without having to see what I need to do .. which kept me in game more .. because I had atoms to blow
---
Now though .. yeah I still don't look at dailies/weeklies and only earned a couple of these rewards and none of them interested me at all in the slightest and so I've been playing less
---
It was cool before because it felt like an incentive .. I'd have a few hundred atoms .. a limited time sale would pop up that would interest me and I'd throw in a couple bucks before the sale ended .. not anymore .. maybe down the road(really far down the road) when they don't appear to be gouging us for pennies and nickels and the quality of the software improves I may rethink re-investing but not anymore
---
The whole in game store thing(conceptually) was a way for continued revenue expecting some people to pay(whales) and some people to mooch off the original purchase so not everyone is gonna put money in to the store but they've turned it into some wicked nickel and dime scheme .. I am now a moocher and don't care anymore
---
I haven’t heard of any of that stuff except for a fixer, I’ve heard of a handmade but not with that nomenclature and I have no idea what the WW power armor is🤷🏼‍♂️😂
---
Yeah, but dated engine is dated.
---
I feel like a lot of issues simply can't be fixed, or I'd imagine they would.
---
Fast travel not working but had to try it from 3-6 times before it 'took'.    
---
Enemies who spawn, can't move from their spot, take damage, but heal instantly. Can't hurt you but no XP.    
---
Lots of headless Scorch who are also frozen in spot, can't die.    
---
IDK if this is a glitch but encountered a Vengeful Mothman who after firing one shot, cloaked, and Hidden it turned into the Flash and got into my face.    
---
Killing something with level 30 Super Sledge would often result in it's death and xp but apparently the 'force' would knock it through walls and into the ground and cannot loot it.
---
Nothing is more dissapointing than building your house, deciding to pack up and move or you reenter a new session and someone is on your spot, so you pull up your blueprint only for the game to not allow you to place your house down because of some foundation issue. It worked before wtf happened!?!
---
It’s an internal space? Nukes don’t effect it.
---
I came here to type this.  Bravo!
---
As much as I 100% know you are right.
---
I really hope you are wrong about everyone opening up their wallets. If BGS figures out they can make big bucks off it it, the next one will likely be even grindier to get more money outta you.
---
Credit card warriors shouldnt get to flex, but its a free world I guess.
---
Bethesda won’t patch it because it will mean less people might be incentivized to buy each rank for the 150 atoms.
---
:) I think they do. But who cares? It just works.
---
I got the Safari Croc Backpack for 9931 caps. Literally a steal of a price even at that lol
---
I'm always afraid someone won't and that they'll be lost forever, but this is agood way to help out as well!
---
server max is 25 people you cant have an auction house across servers. it would be pointless to set up the codeing for a max of 25 people to AH anything. thus why they gave us vendors. with people jumping in and out of servers constantly its not a viable option to have a group market style sale. since we dont have mega servers like eso, wow or any other mmo.
---
They did, at 3/5. See below from help.bethesda.net:
---
I don't know why it's so strict. It's hard to get creative without having to find that ***exact*** spot at just the right angle, and it may not exist anyway.
---
There's four ;)

At least half of these guys are fos
---
I eat even more, soon reaching obesity levels, because gotta stack that shit.
---
I sent my new main to the SBQ. I know I hit her a few times before she was killed. I was not on a team and yet could not loot from her. I did get rewards from completing that even though.
---
Do we start at level 1 or increase to level 1 first?
---
Hold down your action button (‘E’ on PC) while moving the object, it lets you move it forward or backward, but stays in the same y coordinate unless there’s terrain in the way
---
I thought herd mentality had negative effects...
---
I've done that a problem I've had a few time is it would empty my vending machine and I would have to remark the items for sale 
---
The amount of time that takes is worth more than the caps they spend to get to my camp
---
I just unlocked this suit today, and I am confused as to how I equip it? I just got the game yesterday so completely new. The reward said to go to the armor bench but I still don't see how to equip it. 
---
Could you help?
---
What is to-go punch effect?
---
Fuzzy Brenda liked this.
---
Start at 1, then after 1000 score you hit 2.
---
It takes away in the regard that they miss out on a happy moment of kindness, which often helps them stay in thte game and enjoy it. I get what you mean, but tbh (at least for me) plans are the least joyful thing to grind for as it's mostly just random luck instead of actual efford put into it.
---
The junky build had a real effect on my real life, makes quarantine more bearable
---
Most people are Unyielding Bloodied Builds. i personally am a Vampire's Power armor heavy gunner
---
When you were on last night did you play NW last?
---
As long as you have class freak 3 there are none.
---
As someone who's spent thousands of caps for plans I'll never use (but they spice up my home), I can agree with you. Buying that pool table plan for 50 caps is ABSOLUTELY necessary to beating the Scorchbeast queen. Trust me.
---
One of the random Vault-boy lunchbox effects. I was more weirded out by the "Very Well Rested" though, as it seemed to stack and I did not even open a lunchbox.
---
Bethesda in general likes to be tight lipped. Anyway, don't try to demand the score or anything, I did and it's not possible
---
i take it your trying to see how far you are until you unlock your next Christmas or Halloween item due to the glitch. if the event was legit you would have a tracker in your NW challenges. but since them being available atm is due to a glitch the trackers are not active. you will have to just do it in your head sir.
---
were you on pc? Was it like, various power armors and camp items? Cause I was flat broke yesterday, now I have 15k caps again
---
You will never know unfortunately
---
Had it Happen on the Building Supply Weekly - FeelsBadMan - Pretty sure the 2X S.C.O.R.E weekend is their Reacharound er. Workaround.
---
You have to craft it at armor work bench the suit under outfits and the mask under headwear then you will have it in your inventory
---
I'm on Xbox so eh
---
Amen - Fix This Jive Already
---
Navigation mesh? Hahahahaha oh my fucking God thats dumb as hell. I played since beta, and I can tell you they don't give two shits about how well things navigate together. But definitely, come back next week for the 6h installment of Handmade skins, instead of fixing day one issues or community-based QoL like locked in trade windows.
---
uh, are you seriously suggesting that bethesda implement a new system? have you seen everything they have "implemented"?
---
this new in-game bug report system that you want bethesda to do, would be so buggy, that you would not even be able to submit a bug report about the bug report system.
---
Nope because I want everything will definitely get lvl 100. Gives a reason to do alot of stuff.
---
I had totally missed that the game takes a 10% fee? That explains a lot why it always said I got 9caps for each sale! Beside from my plans I only really sell ammo for 1cap each so there they can't take a cut of them so never really noticed haha
---
if someone opens a lunch box near you they can grant the effect to you, as well as themselves
---
Damn right. The game is set in America and has a massive American player count yet everyone’s a communist and proud haha
---
But ty
---
You need to do at least a 1000 damage AFAIK
---
I didn't get 2000 points for doing two weeklies. I'm still at 1k from 4 dailies yesterday. But ok. I'll submit a ticket and wait four weeks for a response.
---
I only buy duplicates when I find them cheap because I build camps on my alts, but I get it, some of these players take to resell them.
---
That emote is gone for me as well, but I never bought it, it was a freebie. Nothing is blocked for me in the shop either, the emote is just gone for no reason.
---
Thanks! I should have thought of that. Main post edited with new link.
---
I'd also argue that secondary perks are more important than primary in many cases. Sentinel, Cavalier, Powered, and Poison Resist will do more for your protection than Vanguards or other things will. Plus weight reduction armor pieces are worth their weight in caps.
---
I see there is no point arguing with your logic as you keep insisting not to understand a word I'm saying and keep using ad hominems and straw mans.
---
Enjoy playing your broken game and getting mad at random comments on the internet.
---
Why is the NSFW
---
Nope missed the NW challenge as it was survive for 30 mins I think and just couldn't be bothered to sit through it!
---
Yeah, ofc it's a whole nother thing when you buy them for your alt! I've seen some people buy 4x Ultracite torso plans when I've put them up for free, that's the kind of stuff I'm talking about
---
I’ve fired up games that were on disc so I didn’t think tot try an online one but I’m going to try this next.. we deleted and are in the process of re-installing it right now thinking maybe that’ll do it 🤞🏻
---
I hate it mid battle when you realise you never swapped them back in
---
Are you talking about the Uncle Sam salute? That’s only available through the tricentennial pack (purchased with $, not atoms). There was a bug that allowed others to equip it that was fixed in patch 20.
---
The Whitesprings has a whole misc quest for grabbing them, so try there
---
Unyielding bloodied build. Heavy gunner, shotguns, and melee perk cards all fall under the same special stats.
---
One Tamriel saved the game.
---
noob with caps
---
what will he buy
---
I always see people talk about West Tek but I never find any legendaries there. My luck is awful.
---
Thanks everyone.
---
Seems like a real waste of ballistic fiber.
---
So a bug is happening where you need to be logged off before the daily reset I personally give it an hour before reset and then log back on or you will auto complete them and not get score.
---
Are you referring to the weekly or daily? I've not had any issues with my score other than pre-mature rewarding of it
---
No that’s what I figured.
---
Great so I'm guessing I definitely cant get to tier 100 now since that screwed me and only 2 of the weekly's actual gave me score
---
So is revolution! Just as guillotine is reusable =)
---
same way as in adventure mode, but it is free, to build is free, but your selection is limited
---
You MAY* auto complete .
---
What level are you? The counter resets each level. 
---
So if you start at 1 and do 1 weekly for 1000 score, the counter would say 0/1025 (Lvl 2)
---
Dailies. Weeklies have been fine for me
---
I sell the robot models for more than they are worth, no one really buys them, but sometimes people come to my camp and really like the place, so I tell them they can buy a souvenir robot from the "gift shop"
---
25 or so caps isn't anything, and you get a neat little robot to take home and accidentally scrap.
---
If you're a fall-out first member for the price of it your stash box weight limit should at least be doubled 800 is just bullshit the unlimited scrap is nice but come on 800 is BS.
---
If you get a nice roll on a Vanguards or Bolstering SS its not a bad thing to have a couple of them in the mix. Most of the complaints about Vanguards is they have diminishing returns, but having a piece of two will add to your defense and Bolstering will help with the steep dropoff of Vanguards and allow you to drop to low health when needed and still be tanky.
---
I've been pressing and holding the back button and nothing?
---
pip boy and then LB i believe
---
Try something new withing game or out of this buggy madness. Anyway it is just a waste of ur life. So what exactly do u want to ask by this post is another question but I believe u can respond ur last one buy urself. Cheers.
---
Nice I'll keep a look out for tht one
---
Useless mirelurk kings, they probably got nerfed to house cat grade. I was surrounded by four and all tried hard to slap me and spit at me, no damage taken.
---
Well then more than likely yes if you log in everyday with those weekends you probably can. Just hope you dont get the glitch where 3 of your daily challenges are alredy done when you log in. That happened to me if it persists i'll lose out in 1000 score a day.
---
Absolutely fun. Find you a great group of people to play with and it just becomes cutting up in a party and making jokes about loot or helping in game challenges. Its truly a fun multi-player game when you can meet people. I had no friends when I started it and now I play regularly with 8ish folks who just make the time fly by!
---
Mine where completed then de completed mid ticket
---
Yes you may auto complete lol thanks for the clarification 👍
---
Thanks. 
---
The vast majority of people with the issue are either playing at the refresh time, or had last played NW. 
---
Another theory is that completing challenges within an hour of logging off, or in the hour leading up to refresh could cause it. Can't say for certain yet.
---
Nah, I think everyone gets that way eventually. Whether it’s 76 or another game with grind elements. Grinding is just a way to keep players logging back in until the devs can release content with real meat in it. 
---
When you think about it, what’s really the point of the rep rewards and the SS gear? There’s literally nothing in this game that couldn’t be done with the previous tier, so why grind all that rep, gold and scrip? Just to make something you can already do a little bit easier? It’s smoke and mirrors, the same as the legendary run. Just gives people something to do until the next real content patch comes out. We all get tired of it, so go work on that backlog and come back with a fresh set of eyes.
---
How often do even normal people die? The only event I have a chance to die is Encryptid
---
Damn been trying to get the fancy revolver and the shotgun, you won the luck of the draw
---
I know and I dont like it, me and my friend made a test and the lvls there are only to gate you from content, he with no gear and lvl 1 on heavy atack did 1500dmg me lvl 50 with the same weapon with no gear did 1100 damage, so is stupid in my point of view, all fights feels the same etc... I personally don't like it.
---
Oh very cool. Yeah I’ve been playing since launch. Once you hit level 50 everything opens up.
---
How are people already at level 40?
---
I always sell plans 90% off, no matter what. Fallout says a plan is worth 1,500 caps... Nah, somebody's gonna pick this up for 150 caps. every time I sell a plan I consider it my good deed for the day.
---
So the were ticked off and are now available to complete? Did you leave the game afk'ing while submitting the ticket or did you log off/on?
---
Oh lol you’ll learn
---
I noticed some weekly challenges gave me S.C.O.R.E. Before I’d completed all the relevant challenges. Also I was on during the daily reset and mine was fine. So guess it’s just R&amp;G like fallout 76 we love
---
Thank you for 7z  and the files themselves
---
can confirm, bug is still there after patch 20
---
I’m melee or heavy weapon, depending on what I’m fighting.  Things that fly get heavy weapons, melee for most everything else.
---
Just beginning to discover the joys of critter specific weapons - For example, the FSS ghoul slayers switchblade is something to behold at Whitesprings - but in general, my gotos are vampire weapons.
---
No I am talking about the Salute when you nod, and put your fist over your chest when in PA. That was the animation that took place when I chose to salute. The traditional salute was only available while in PA as a photo pose. Now the option to salute is gone are all of the other emotes that I purchased. I only have standard emotes in my wheel now.
---
No that's not true first you can grind xp for the extra score and also if you have saved any atom and know your. Not using it for anything special you'll be able to by ranks of score in a few weeks. I think it'll be 150 per rank. So you can just get the one your missing from the particular week you should have got and be fine.
---
I’d like it if shelves were like display cases
---
r/boneappletea
---
I've missed like 3k score though so I'll definitely have to grind
---
I'm pretty sure shared perks don't stack. It only gives you the highest shared perk, so if you share level 1 inspirational and a teammate shares level 3, then you get level 3, not level 4. It's better to just use level 3 inspirational and share something like strange in numbers because not many players have high enough charisma to share level 3 inspirational.
---
I'm not going to sell a plan for the fixer for 150 caps, that ain't happening. Stop looking at "value" that box vendors give.
---
When I seen one didnt give me any I wrote down how much score I had and completed 2 more and my score didn't change at all 😭
---
When you say the dailies refreshed "a sec ago" what do you mean?
---
Yessss... sky whaling. This is what the harpoon gun was for. Please, Bethesda!
---
Sure if you're in a team 100% of the time. If not you're nerfing yourself if you play solo at all. No thanks.
---
What's wrong with that
---
That sucks man. I have missed out on only 1k so far thankfully. Still was pissed so I can imagine how you feel.
---
I just used less words. The challenges refreshed at 12 and I already have some completed without even playing and I didnt get anything for it
---
Why didn’t they Just do a service rifle model that can be nodded into all the NV rifles likes marksmans and assaults etc I mean the m16 is kinda a US ar right?
---
Could you imagine someone actually justifying using a credit card to purchase pixels in a game and paying interest on it. Yikes. Using your debit card I get because some people do have disposal income.
---
Do you have any proof people are at level 40?
---
They are awarding score at 3/5. So when you completed one and wrote down your score, if the two weeklies you then completed were already at 3/5 you will have had that score before you wrote it down anyway. 
---
From help.bethesda.net:
---
Grinding xp, get on a team, well rested, cranberry food, inspirational perk share, lunch box. All adds up
---
I haven’t gotten on today, but do we have to craft a bow to use it?
---
The tunnel that goes underground out of Watoga has tons of brain fungus and glowing mushrooms.
---
Leave it to bugthesda to somehow make season passes worse 😂😭
---
Hope it stays true to the game and the first episode crashes like 5 minutes in.....
---
You can do the tick blood process which I did at first but I got the collecttron for my camp and the get blood packs and use super duper and scientist and you get 2x stims from scientist and super duper will give extra to. I never have to get them from anywhere else now. I have 250 and I never run out. You play on Xbox I can give you some

Would be 7pm (GMT+3) for Greece, but I doubt there's many Greek players, but still.
---
"robbed" means that they've had had something taken away, what you are talking about is the bug where you get the 1000 points at the 3rd mark and not at the 5th. 
---
And this has been acknowledged by Beth already.
---
btw. as for being downvoted... My guess is that happens because your post is a bit aggressive and shows that you have not even made an effort to actually research if this bug had been reported already.
---
We do, yes, but oddly, it has to be a normal bow, not a compound, which is what bothers me.
---
I don't know when, but at one point all the non-default emotes had been removed from my emote wheel and I had to go in the Atom shop and select the ones I wanted to add back to the wheel, similar to choosing which skins to use in NW. 
---
Enabled ones should have a checkmark on the square in the Atom shop
---
Riff?
---
That's wrong. Nukes do indeed affect some internal spaces. Turns the ghouls into bloated glowing ones.
---
that is the spirit! Lately I found myself fighting mobs with only 5 hp and they are not able to kill me.. I feel myself invincible unless there shows up an asaltron wth her head blaster or other mob with different type of damage like acid. Fun stuff.
---
I don't think I had any process on the weeklys at all before I wrote my score down though
---
Will have to try sometime then
---
Ok.
---
I feel like it'll suck in this game. Difficulty in Bethesda games just means "bullet sponge".
---
I really hate posts about people complaining about his others price their stuff.
---
Why? It’s entitlement. You literally think people HAVE to do what you find acceptable. You are t seeing them as people who are allowed to make their own choices. You see them as a resource for you. Yes. That’s literally the psychology behind this. 
---
Naturally you’re not going to buy it. Which is how it works. If it’s yo ridiculously priced no one will buy it.
---
And if someone does. That’s not your business either.
---
I’m pretty sure it’s just a visual glitch. I’ve been in the extended area and it wasn’t irradiated at all.
---
Oh no no no, I am thriled, hyped.. most of all, truly happy
---
Great leave it to them to somehow make season passes more cancerous
---
Subnautica had an excellent bug report system in early access. The difference is the devs actually cared about the game.
---
Were you online at 12? If not were you last in NW when you logged off?
---
The vast majority of people affected were online at refresh time, or logged in a within a few minutes of it. Of those that weren't online, some of them had been in NW for their previous session which was the bug before the patch.
---
There's also a theory that completing challenges between 11 (old reset time) and 12 will cause the issue.
---
Sorry I’m confused. Are you talking about a photo mode pose or emote? There is not just generic solute emote. There is the Uncle Sam, raider, free states, fly boys, maybe 1 or two more. 
---
If it’s the photomode pose that would be under poses and is earned from the BOS questline.
---
Not an expert, it's pretty basic knowledge if you paid any attention in your Junior High History classes. 
---
Besides, it doesn't' take an expert for anything today, you have all of human knowledge at your fingertips. Why are people so eager to be ignorant of actual differences when they exist, especially when you can take 2 minutes to educate yourself on practically everything on Earth.
---
I'm actually really excited to see how it turns out
---
Been playing for 650 hours and I’ve seen one.
---
There was originally a way to drop them from your inventory and then pick them up again to trigger the quest but I think that was patched.  Any extras in your inventory are junk.
---
dude same the sheepsquach plush is the only reason I'm doing this
---
So many more important issue but this mundane one you can get around by yourself with common sense gets so much downvoted
---
Yeah that’s great. Glad people aren’t allowed to make choices that don’t like.
---
You should. It's so much more of a challenge, and much better experience.
---
You on PS4? I’ve no use for it. I’ll give it to you.
---
The amount of times this question/post gets made is unbelievable
---
I was not online when the weekly didnt give me anything but I was a bit ago when it the refresh hit for the daily challenges.
---
Was told the same about the 2 full sets of modded PA that disappeared on me.
---
I only use GS3 with my BE hm, no difference in durability. Still need to repair after 1K shots.
---
I will make my entire camp Sheepsquatch plush
---
I’m a broken shotgun build so not much is a challenge lol we shall see if it is worthy
---
You'd just been in NW yeah?
---
It's a 10 week season. So if he moves 1 spot a day, he needs 70 spots total. He starts at spot 30 and you can attain multiple spots per day.
---
 I'm at rank 5 and I started today. It will work out but it's sorta like, you gotta want it enough to earn it.
---
Preach
---
Nobody’s forcing you to be here...
---
and it is the same there mate and in any other MMO
---
I am having the same problem. I have picked up 10 of the things and none give credit for the daily challenge
---
    Junior High History classes    
---
I don't even know what to say to that. You might wanna pick up a book or something
---
I just saw my second one in hundreds of hours of play. It was controlling a Scorchedbeast. I noticed they bumped up the frequency of Mothman for a couple weeks a few months back too. I’m pretty sure it’s intentional.
---
Like this I need to make more of an effort
---
It was part of the atom store. Some people got it for free by accident. Bethesda corrected that, I still have all of my salute emotes.
---
If I know the plans I drop them for them new players. Even if there rare or hard to come by
---
Too bad they drop low level gear but it’s a reliable way to get a little script if you need any
---
The other day i found the sercet armor jetpack at 3000 caps, i had 2800.. i tried to earn 200 fast as possible but i didn't make it lol
---
Because it's not meant for the compound bow, it's meant for the regular bow.
---
The non exclamation point events are arguably more lucrative than the public ones. The horde events are basically legendary and do farms as are AWOL Armaments and Monster Mash. Census Violence and The Messenger can give you rare outfits and plans which are trade commodities and at the least can get you a few thousand caps easy in your vendor. Leader of the Pack is a quick 9-15 scrip. A number of others award legendaries and caps like the enclave events.
---
It looks like they might've changed the camp physics, their strategy doesn't work anymore
---
I thought they were 0 caps
---
Thank for the offer, but I'd like to get it on my own. 
---
Why not put it on display in your camp, be it make some nice wall art
---
Your in a high level area...
---
Lol, oh well, now you can farm gold buillon instead.
---
Nope 1 cap a piece
---
Good shout as I try and join a team
---
What level are you now? I'm level 12 and have done the weeklies and all the dailies except NW, and the new ones today, if that helps you work it out.
---
Look for a horde event. They always have a legendary.
---
Wrong, you can level it by gaining exp. 10k which is rather easy, when you have 2x exp from events group, with dailies mixed in. So easy to level. PLAY.
---
Stop lying because you are lazy and cannot understand basic repeatable quest
---
Even when solo?
---
Actually no! I was checking the challanges again and they changed
---
I'm not sure I'll have to update you when I get back home
---
Pull up social menu and click on your name
---
...Or yellow if you're thinking that's an acceptable alternative. 
---
\-Colorblind people
---
I have a sink a chicken can use 🤪
---
What do you play on. If Xbox I can help you lvl
---
Exactly. I'm betting all they'll do is let you add all of the ammo you have of each type at once for selling and buying ammo. This will help with a of the screens and time but they probably won't do anything about the horrible conversion rate. I was going to convert 10k 5mm into .45. I did the math and saw that I would get 522 rounds of .45. that's insulting, what a joke.
---
Any events?
---
Well I did the BOS SAM event. Got the daily event and one legend kill, but yea I'll keep my eyes peeled 
---
Still gotta do the 10 legendary kills for the 1000 score
---
The whole system is a bit of a mess. Really unsure how it got past any kind of testing.
---
open your map and see if any high lvl player have theyr camp arround and if is any press social select your name and use "leave this world"(something like that) and relog, open your map and check again, if no high lvl player have the camp there you are good to go.
---
I mean its still like 1400 a day
---
30% of the challenges I did gave me score, this complete bs. There should be a “war” against Bethesda but not like the crybaby griefer bs, an actual well made “war”
---
If the Burrows are open, there is legendaries in there.
---
The mole miners event ?
---
People sometimes forget why they play the game, especially when they having a fear of missing out.
---
It's entertainment. If you're not being entertained, don't play.
---
Also, I hope they expand on how you can earn SCORE, because I'm willing to sacrifice at least 1 friend to get the sheepsquatch plush.
---
This is not the same issue.  I have researched this bug, and have read the information you are talking about. Please read through some of today's Reddit posts, since the dailies changed over earlier. There are numerous posts about auto-completion, and I am not alone.
---
No. The Burrows is a dungeon under Harpers Ferry.
---
I usually sell one of each fashnact for free right next to the vault then but a 100 for 30 caps each so when a low level comes there bound to be curious and I trade to give them caps for the future.
---
The main reasons behind this is bcs I had someone help me around a lot and now it feels like I want to do the same
---
Well I just hit lvl 50 last night and have very little caps so it helps me out in the long run
---
I had 2 weekly missions just consumed into the void i would be rank 16 by now had it not happened
---
Mountainside Bed &amp; Breakfast has an Overseer's Log at the bottom of the stairs outside, that's usually my go-to.
---
Interesting. I always thought they were 0 caps.
---
I was burnt out after the  Chirstmas events but kept grinding until wastelanders and have been taking a break since, I still like the game and will jump back in at some point
---
Whatever man. I had a history class in Jr. High. Maybe you want to broaden your perspectives.
---
I am talking about the emote, all of my atom shop purchased emotes are gone.
---
I am also blocked from the atomshop on my main account, I can't access it.
---
I think I’m getting more score from college grinding in an INT group than anything else but if I carry on the way I am I’ll not hit 100.
---
I’ll most likely use my 1st atoms to bridge any gaps but that will only get me so far. 
---
Those busy life gamer problems. Fallout 76 now needs to be a proper focus, if I were to play other games on the side I couldn’t get enough score.
---
So did I that's why I never picked them up. But when I looked after picking them up it said 1 cap
---
To which i laugh at those builds with a reflect melee weapon also,  funny how most legendary perks dont stack too high or has a limit yet bloodied and unyielding does
---
I'm still at level 30 and i didn't start the overseers quest yet, maybe i should learn more before that.
---
The only two that are worth doing are Line in the Sand and Radiation Rumble. They spawn a lot of enemies so if you can tag or kill them you'll get a bunch of experience. All the other events are too slow to complete or don't spawn enough enemies to make it worth your time.
---
Im sorry that this happened to you bro but it'll be fine. All his calculations where done with no exp challenges added no double score weekend or double exp weekend dont want to sound like a dick but just cuz you a herd a few people complaining doesn't mean just jump on the band wagon
---
My thoughts exactly. Most definitely poorly executed
---
Spend more money to unlock more episodes.
---
Lol, ur gonna have to deal with it then. no one is going to sell you something that is rare and required effort for such low base values
---
It'll only take them 6 months to a year to get around to it.
---
Gotchya so it’s a glitch. Thanks for the info.
---
Nope. This is a different glitch. Glitch 1: challenges autocomplete once you get to 3/5 completion but you still get the score.
---
Glitch 2: log on to find 3 dailies already autocompleted and you do not get the 1000 associated score. Not the same.
---
Just tried it again, it’s working for me. Holstered weapon, third person camera, right mouse and rotate. Double check that you didn’t accidentally reassign the hot key
---
Do you ever do feed the people for the caned meat that gives 1hr of 5% Xp?
---
**S**pace **C**adet **O**rientation and **R**ecruitment **E**xperience.
---
Lmao
---
And yeah you gotta weigh if something is worth it or not. Sometimes youll just NEED [insert thing] and other times youll try and convince yourself you need it because fomo
---
mine auto completed when i logged on
---
Ah yes and what do we do when we are finished with the season hmm
---
If you're in a group and at least one teammate hits it then you will get credit. Haven't had this issue especially now with public teams.
---
The camps has a lot of bugs that needs fixing.
---
I moved my camp a couple of days ago, that was a mistake as I now can't place the blueprint anywhere, even on flat areas.
---
So now I'll stick to one of those  small building prefabs until these bugs gets fixed.
---
4 builds here. Role-play brawler, gunslinger, courier and a ghoul.
---
Brawler (unarmed Melee tank)
---
Gunslinger (vats critical)
---
Courier (food build)
---
Ghoul (most mutations).
---
ditto
---
Here’s my issue - it has the same pulley system as the compound bow. Even if they only intended it for the bow, why couldn’t this work for the compound bow as well?
---
People are not being robbed of score, some of the weeklies are awarding BEFORE they're completed. Count your SCORE TOTAL
---
And since when can you not use a shovel so there’s no dirt on your floor tiles when you place them.
---
That makes me wonder if this is a change from wastelanders or the last patch.
---
Those made money and didn’t bankrupt the company and force them to sell the IP like interplay did 😉
---
Ikr they need to give everyone a free tier or two to make up for it
---
I usually sell plans at 20% their initial "cost". Most things are initially 100-250, so 20 - 50 caps is what they sell for. It's a nice way to deter those who just come buy everything you have, while still leaving it cheap enough for those who really want it.
---
If you need plans and are on xbox you should come by my base next to gorge junkyard. If interested send me a massage at must4rdt1g3r. I do give discount if you trade 2 mm electromagnetic cartridges.
---
I honestly don't have any idea. Lol
---
BTW: better do some research of your own, because this isn't the 3/5 bug but a DIFFERENT one which Bethesda hasn't acknowledged at all. Yeah, I know, I'm as shocked as you that there could be more than one bug in a Bethesda game update. Personally, I had three daily challenges auto-complete immediately too as soon as they came in, and no SCORE awarded for them (two for 250, one for 500). Apparently it's an issue caused by being online when the challenges refresh, similar to the old daily Atom challenge auto-complete one.
---
You are still on the top left side of the map?
---
You've not gone over to the far right where you WILL have a bad time
---
Rewarding is an understatement. I get so many legendaries a day I get my 150 scrip, sell some to get the 1400 vendor caps and then just start dropping them at train stations.
---

---
any% achievment unlocked, congrats :D
---
Neatly everything in my camp is 90% off from that list price. There are a few items that I will charge face value or higher depending on an agregate perceived value acquired from scarcity, uniqueness and demand. Such items may be 10x that listed value. If those items don't sell in a timely manner, I will incrementally lower the price. 
---
When I go to a CAMP and see very common items, especially those that are overabundant through the land, priced significantly higher I just walk away laughing. 
---
What I find hysterical are those that complain about the cap limit to then find items for safe in their machines for 25K of more. There is nothing in this game worth that. Don't care how many stars and perks it may hsve. But still, I move on laughing. While they complain, I keep selling and buying. Plus, inventory that doesn't move costs you money...err, caps. 
---
Hugs!
---
You don't have bullet sponges in ESO.
---
In addition, you don't have bullets or arrows.
---
Hahaha. Exactly.
---
Fallout didn't bankrupt interplay, but ok. Hope Bethesda sees this bro.
---
Weird all my daileies and weeklies are intact still in my menu
---
Okay, that's you.
---
Construction was entirely new in 4. They've added more in 76.
---
It just requires time. Time is, of course, money, but building communities have carried other games for years.
---
Yeah, totally forgot about that. If it's up you might as well grab it.
---
"bethesda good, do no wrong. bug report bad, evil, naughty" mind sets
---
My camp budget is about full and my camp is a shovel museum. All shovels all day!!!
---
Maybe I was being too subtle, Im pretty high
---
They are taking a lot more damage now, too. Not larger HP pools, but heavier per-bullet damage. I was getting mid 300s on headshots vs a group of scorched that were fighting MKs, which is very low, but hitting the MKs for 770, which is a bit high.
---
Vats stealth #s seem pretty off.
---
Look up zero VATS rifle build on YouTube. 👍
---
Not sure why your downvoted maybe because of the life giver exploit lol but when there are so many broken weapons in the game that are working unintentionally to solo the queen I don't see why anyone can take the end game seriously when they don't fix anything anyways so I say use what you can lol
---
They can only be learned from scrapping Gatling lasers.
---
Thts something u don't see every day, wow 
---
I went to this one camp and couldn't find its vending machines and was pissed to teleport out but I opened the fridge and there was a lower level museum and I was like damn thts cool
---
I would use a keycard on 15 pieces of steel
---
Can the jack o lantern pain go on the combat shotgun? 
---
It looks like it has a combat shotty in the mix
---
They are the Mosaic tiles
---
Sure did! I quit playing f76!
---
Whatever you want? Did you only do weekly and daily challenges before?
---
Highlight it it will show the details
---
This isn't the same issue. This auto-complete problem prevents players from being able to do the challenges, therefore robbing players of the chance to acquire said SCORE. My total was 500/x prior to the changeover. At changeover it still read 500/x but it said three challenges had been completed - one of which was the complete 5 events. I hadn't done any at the time!
---
Ive thought targeting has always been messed up in this game.
---
I sell them at 5 caps each
---
You are the best human ever. Thank you so much for this video
---
Did you get banned? What error do you get when you try to open the atomic shop?
---
That’s the only reason I’ve started buying T-65 parts. I rarely wear power armor...I’m just hoping to display it some day.
---
Juicehead calculated with the repeatable weekly and the double score weekend? Hmmm...
---
The Holotape in Aktos Pharma doesn't work either so it's vanilla holotapes only.
---
I would do more of the super low caps if I could just type a number in, even if a keypad came on screen so you could still do it with a controller anything would be an improvement over what we have. It really is discouraging using the vending knowing I’ll be sitting for 45 minutes to get the price sliders finicky nature to work properly
---
Uhh quest? Nuclear winter just exploring in general I take the game slow and explore everything I can while doing quest and it’s been a lot of fun discovering different creatures and strange weapons you play how you choose And there’s public teams now if your feeling that lonely
---
You mean the drifter outfit? This is not rare, but a visually great one. My favourite.
---
You are in a high level area. Stick to the forest, toxic valley and ash heap until you level up.
---
Small pond between Harpers Ferry and the power station has lots.
---
Yeah, but they don't reward atom anymore, they reward score
---
you appeantlly joined a party. and yes those items are now your you can store them but don't scrap them as you won't be able to rebuild them. its simple camp 101. if its locked leave it locked. if its open go right in. watch for trap camps. people build camps designed to lure people in and kill them.
---
I always sell my caps at 50% of original price or equal to its functional value.  For instance, I sell fusion cores at the percentage they are at.  I think its fair because caps either go to vendors or fast travel of which they don't typically come back from
---
Agreed - my “Gold Star” challenge stayed completed for the whole next daily set of challenges yesterday. 
---
People aren’t reading what you’re actually posting. Keep up the good work, fellow dweller!
---
Pilot episode features 56 minutes of scrapping junk and murdering a dog, capped off by a single, very animated thumbs up.
---
you forgot the up and down arrows, how am i supposed to switch between buy and sell without my Ups and Downs?
---
Hell yea, I don't do power armor either, unless going in the nuke zone. I would really like to display the excavator armor and ultracite power armor
---
😀 Thank you for making me smile. There is truth in jest!
---
These are bugs that were reported in fallout 4, Skyrim, new Vegas, and fallout 3 the morons in charge of Bethesda think this damn piece of shit game engine is still good when it isn’t a lot of these problems will never be fixed until they build a new engine that can actually handle an online fallout game not an already worn out and out of date single player game engine
---
Yup. Class Freak 3 reduces the negative effects by 75% and the game can only deal in whole numbers so it lets you off.
---
Ohh didn't know tht
---
Ironic that you’ve said “you have not even made an effort to actually research if this bug has been reported”. 
---
You have not even made the effort to read his post properly.
---
Hubs just not using last little but of loaded mag have to reload even when I have ammo. Can’t exit power armor. Can’t fast travel.
---
try to find new ways to destroy peoples camps .. they love that and with no text chat it's a win win
---
you can do the quests under data in your pip boy but this game is mostly about just doing unimportant stuff .. like killing stuff for no reason other than to repair the things you killed it with or selling it to other players to kill more other stuff
---
there's always the BATTLE ROYAL!!!! YEAH!!
---
but yeah kill, collect, repair, repeat .. some people have met their soulmates in game too apparently .. you could run around asking people to marry you IRL too
---
That's not the issue at all. The daily challenges are being auto completed. Today the level up challenge and the Gold Star complete 5/5 challenge were automatically completed at the time of refresh. How could you get the gold star completion without having completed 5 other challenges? No SCORE awarded, just missed out on that much for the day.
---
yeah sure we don't have 2m health boss there sure.
---
Same content on repeat eternally
---
I noticed too that giant, irradiated bats aren’t a real thing. What’s with this game, right?
---
There’s a perk called Ammosmith that can help a lot! 
---
Also I would try and pin down whether you want to go down the Commando or Shotgun route to condense your ammo/perk needs. 
---
In the same vein, I would try to pin down Vanguards vs Bolstering and get all of the same set.
---
Finally, there are trading subs for ammo purchases and I imagine you could come by shotgun shells pretty easy. 5.56 and ultracite might be harder but not impossible. 
---
If you decide on a build let me know and I might be able to help with weapons and armor for it. I run a high health stealth commando right now and have extra stuff.
---
I've been robbed of 2000 SCORE today.  Awesome.
---
Are you sure it's not just awarding you before you completed it
---
Same content on repeat endlessly
---
That's it - Gold Star. I couldn't remember what it was called! And thank you.
---
Imagine being against working, you lazy reactionary piece of shit.
---
yeah! your image is flawed and discriminatory!!! let's nuke his base!
---
I started after wastelanders came out, Ive been selling propaganda fliers since day 2.
---
Take my upvote! Great reminder.
---
Positive. I have already explained this in the thread, as have others.
---
the influx of players is a false positive. since PVE players are forced to go to NW to do dailies. if they want to get all the items from their season system. as for the hacker thing no idea. im on xbox. no where as many hackers
---
Yeah, I happen to agree aswell. Whitesprings is a hotspot for nukes and C.A.M.P's. I'm placed to the east of the dried-up lake bed. I figure if someone wants to come to your camp they will do if you want traffic just don't place your C.A.M.P out in the border areas of the map and you should be good.  
---
A decent place I have seen the odd one or two camps is outside of foundation.. might be a good area ?
---
I hate you, have my upvote....
---
The up and down arrows are available for purchase in the atom store.
---
Do you even Bethesa, bro?
---
Yes please, I'm tired of giving 1784 damage to a ghoul and dying because it somehow his life still full
---
When ESO you're doing 30k DPS then that's not a problem.
---
Me neither, but I do not say that it is not a real.one.
---
This has potential to be awesome I’d happily spend one hour watch someone looting junk 😂.
---
Seriously though given the factions and the wasteland lore there is a lot of material to work with. Chance to introduce characters from previous games probably not likely or to see someone supersledge a super mutant would be fucking awesome. guess we’ll just have to wait and see
---
That’s good to know. I picked up one from Flatwoods and it worked fine.
---
Im the same way. I am lvl 93 so jot new the other day i got a random team invite for some lvl 19 almost as soon as i longed on. Ended up hanging out with him for like 4 hr. Threw him a bunch of stuff. Help build his camp up some and since that was my build and mod character. Pimped out a few low level weapons for him ans made a few Marine Wetsuits for him ans his buddy.
---
This is the comment I needed 😂
---
Well what happened to Bethesda? They look like EA to me now.
---
Nope, not happening for me.
---
It sucks, and I read others may have lost the same as you. You are not alone!
---
What weapon(s) are you using?
---
If they did that WOW there would be so many reports they could not keep up !! IT JUST WORKS !!
---
Plus I don't have to struggle finishing events like Radiation Rumble and Project Paradise solo now.
---
Yeah its still a pretty bad set up. But my optimism paired with how appalling the grind still is making me think they will improve the system. I love this new addition cause more free stuff is always fantastic, but it is indeed clear improvements are needed.
---
Mainly use a 3 star fire axe, a 3 star handmade, and one star Tesla.
---
I sold my White Russian recipe(and all other alcohol recipes) for free because I think that's The Dude would do.
---
Did you programme the Insult Bot? Awesome burn!
---
    Communism (from Latin communis, 'common, universal')[1][2] is a philosophical, social, political, economic ideology and movement whose ultimate goal is the establishment of a communist society, namely a socioeconomic order structured upon the ideas of **common ownership of the means of production and the absence of social classes, money[3][4] and the state.**[5][6]

Literally the first sentence on the wiki article. Next time try to use your brain before making a buffoon out of yourself ;)
---
All my plans are 25 caps a piece even if its a prime or a jetpack. If you're on PC give me an add! IGN: Kirtonpolex
---
I’ve just been using them. They’re fun. Used the freeze ones on SBQ and ground her to a halt.
---
waitttttttttttttt bethesda game has bugs?????????????????????????????????????????????????
---
Cause we're getting fucked.
---
I know I plan to try and get it but Im done with killing myself for a little presteige in a game and some digital items.
---
Seasonal Clusterf*ck Of Repeatable Events
---
i dont want to buy rare shit. thats not the issue. read the post 👍
---
I try letting people get a shot in, but then the juke box gets swarmed and once I've cleaned up the mess they stand outside blasting everything. So I hop on the roof and obliterate stuff before they can. The sword swings both ways.
---
I also use a three star handmade. With the gun at 200% it breaks after approx 1,000 rounds. Usually lasts about 2.5 times as long.
---
you can't really farm that event anymore the timer is only 10 min
---
Did you text chat a lot in Fallout 4?
---
Same here! It seems spamming the tesla attracts the ire of the server. Especially since update 20, it seems to be bugging out left and right.
---
Nope, im actually in the zones you mentioned. Most of the enemies are my level, only a few are 60+. 
---
Thats what so annoying about it. Im fighting gouls and suddenly im dead because im getting oneshot.
---
man y'all really need to learn how to fuckin read smh
---
Thank you!!! Just got a Blood Eagles Oath and wa confused.
---
I get down voted all of the time. Even if you agree with the sentiment here but have a more even keeled tone, reference bethesda acknowledgement of the issue and promise to fix it still flies south vote wise. It's why people who try to use reason and balance over yelling curse and the typical Beth hate don't voice much here because of down voting. The loudest people are the ones you hear lol.
---
:) this guy gets it.
---
came here to say pretty much all of that. i rolled with a philosophy of sellng everything at 1/5 of what the game says its worth. eventually i changed it to, like you, 10% of RRP. things shift at that price and arent just sat in your invnetory. the second I did this is the second i stopped having to worry about caps. 
---
there are exceptions to the rules; bobbleheads, mags, rare weapons and plans and what not, but by and large everything else goes for a prove where it actually sells.
---
and yeah, i just smh at some of the prices out there. utterly ridiculous
---
Then add a text chat to the list, and spread it! They listened about the ammo Machine.
---
Search magic weapons and watch angry turtles.video
---
That sucks, but at least the mystery is solved.
---
oh i should focus more on one thing? i figured id be better off going for two diffrent types because of ammo(and none of my mates use shotgun ammo) . this is my second char my previous commando build ran in to the same issue i love the non stealth comando playstyle (with or without vats so i should like guerrilla) as well  , i did have a stealth char (gauss pistol only got it to 38 with stealth armour) which was not satisfying to play.
---
as for my armour i was kinda in the middle of switching to Bolstering ( figured id rather have the armour when it was important rather than becoming squishier after i stub my toe) ill have to look in to the trading sites but i suspect 5.56 is expensive as i see alot of people with handmade's.
---
Maybe not to the extent you could before, but it's still long enough to gain some nice xp for everyone involved if people don't want to show us how impressive their incredibly not rare big gun or rifle is.
---
Yes. Most enemies are my level, only some of them are very high.
---
Thats also the issue, since i cant scout them. I fight level 15 mobs, suddenly i get jumped by a 60+. No other players/camps around.
---
That won't really affect very much unless it also affects the weekly challenges and you actually have some weekly challenges to do on the weekend. It will only mean an extra 4000 score, which is less than 4 ranks if you are just starting and maybe less than 3 if you are further along the game board.
---
If the weeklies are also affected, that's an extra 10,000 score total. But, you have to not complete them on Tuesday or Wednesday of that week... which means you can't play much on those days and miss out on exp score, depending on the challenges.
---
It would be nicer if they just added score to public events **like they said they would**. 250 per event seems fair.
---
Thanks for the responses. Be nice to be told where to find when you have 8 million things in you lol. Best gaming community well except that guy that helped me clear my workshop then shot me in the back. Your a dick.
---
I just look at my other monitor and pay more attention to what I’m watching yet I still don’t usually notice I never actually fast traveled
---
Sadly it's an exponential thing. I saw (not my math) level 10 is only 1/20 of the way. It takes lots of XP grinding to be above 15 right now
---
Does this work on radiation rumble? Still need to complete this successfully
---
nah still on the left side.
---
Are you in Charleston capital building?
---
Wonder why it is happening to you and them and not me or my friends
---
Central market auction houses ruin player economies. It’s that simple. Everything becomes stagnant and price fixed and people end up controlling the market. 
---
It no longer becomes about what I feel something is worth. It becomes about people pressuring others to price the same way. And then it becomes about just some items being worth any value to sell. 
---
With cap limits it won’t be as bad as other games. But that will still happens to some extent.
---
Right now, I’m really really enjoying player vending in a game. Because i can put things up, based on what I think will sell. I offer good prices. I’m just about everything. 
---
I don’t have to worry about checking the market to see if. Have to reprice because someone under cut my already good price by a couple caps.
---
Honestly, if you offer items most people will want, at prices that are reasonable, there’s actually no reason for this.
---
I've had the same, I pride myself on being the cheapest fusion core seller (or as far as I've seen in any game) I always give a brotherhood rifle and 200 ammo to under level 10s, level 9 odd then buys my ENTIRE stock of fusion cores, sells them for double the price at their camp, I had over 70 cores
---
thanks, but i checked before. its always lvl 62 and happens even if noone is around.
---
Sometimes there are many of them, sometimes only one, which is actually even more annoying since that single one is easy to miss and often leads to death.
---
I probably use my axe more, because it’s furious and does extra damage with power attacks. Plus reflects damage back when blocking. 
---
So it’s a real killer.
---
Weird mine gave atoms I'm at 190 now
---
It’s been a while but I thought it was holding down a shoulder button, there is a lack of a y axis but yes holding x works. It’s also not stated anywhere on screen.
---
I don’t even know how to fit a lock 🤪
---
Im on PC, but thanks for the offer!
---
That is exciting! I just want the damned treasury notes in a time efficient manner.
---
I like concentrated fire for the ability to target vital areas and the slight damage boost.
---
I'm sure it can be done, but it may take too much effort on their part because there is no proper system in place, so it's a waste of time &amp; resources on their part. (I also lost 1k, it sucks)
---
Scissor gang ftw.
---
No it's not.
---
It's literally the highest DPS rifle in the game.
---
That theory would be wrong in my opinion. From my experience reset is around 5am local time for me, I was last online at about 1230am.
---
Logged in after being asleep for about ten hours; "Resets in 21 hours", 1000 score is not reset
---
You should be able to go to the stored tab and destroy what's stored.
---
Blueprints and stored are two different things.
---
You are in the second section of it, how much does it cost to get to the next level for you?
---
Not true, with the addition of secret service armor rads barely hurt you now.
---
Ok damn but worth a try haha. Thanks for letting me know 👍🏼
---
Become one with the bush. Cause PvP in either mode has really come down to hide n seek.
---
Yeah I haven’t noticed more degradation with melee weapons. Mainly TSE guns. As if they weren’t already nerfed enough.
---
happens everywhere and only charred ferral ghouls
---
Ahhh....I bet that's it. So I just built a Roman-style villa with columns and stone benches next to the big waterfall in the Mire. When I saw the Mosaic tiles, I knew they would be perfect for my theme. Too bad I missed out, I'll be sure to nab them when they pop up again.
---
Good question, though my only answer is "maybe." I haven't experimented much with foundations, but in 2 cases I've been able to clip a foundation through a building and also place a foundation \*just beneath\* that building by (1) placing a snappable white picket fence with its inside facing the building, and (2) using a blueprint to snap a foundation to that fence. 
---
Now, normally, you wouldn't need the blueprint to snap a foundation to a fence, but these were edge-cases where I tried it and it happened to work. This was also accomplished back at Wilson Brothers Garage, which is no longer a buildable zone and I haven't attempted this anywhere else... so, I have no idea if it works well in other parts of the map.
---
By all means, feel free to experiement and let me know how it goes!
---
Not on PC but my advice is the puddles at Encrypted count. See if someone gets downed in the puddle and revive them. That's how i got mine on XB1
---
I think I saw somewhere that it's like a Furious effect that keeps stacking indefinitely. So the higher the rate of fire, the faster it ramps up and the more noticeable it is. Not sure about the one for shotguns though.
---
Not accurate unless they moved reset time upwards 6 hours. Used to reset around 5am local time for me, I've been offline since aboht 1230am
---
My handmade is furious too. Forget the other star effects off the top of my head. I use it mostly first and switch when the mobs get closer. 
---
The Tesla is for low level mass mobs.
---
I had this happen to me. I was not online at reset time.
---
I have also been going by rules of 1/3. It just works. People buy more of my stuff, and I make a decent profit off it. It also helps because it eliminates weight from the stash box.
---
this guy gets it!  im in complete agreement with you.  i find myself self only spending caps on fast traveling so i always have a decent supply of caps on me, so im more than welcome to give them to someone who might need them if i find something neat in their vendor.  but then i see 1 star railway rifle for like 5000 caps and i just, i don't get it.  those are like 18 lbs!  how can you stand to just have that sit in your inventory?
---
I’ve been playing casually for the past few days and I’m almost rank 20
---
i use both. even as full health commando build i have more than enough damage that i'd prefer ground pounder over another 20%
---
Refresh time is 17:00 BST (16:00 GMT/UTC).
---
If you weren't online at that time and have pre-completed challenges, were you in NW the last time you logged off?
---
Since you asked politely: https://imgur.com/P2NOeRi
---
I'm kinda bummed there's no likw, sidequest chain associated with them.
---
I guess that's up to Bethesda to figure out.
---
I appreciate the flexing, but that’s not really what this thread is about.
---
I'll try resetting my controls to default and see if anything changes.
---
It's so funny, because it was working fine before...
---
I sell all my duplicates at a deep discount. Helps to collect more from the unique vendors. I also sell serums at 60% of the going rate. Marsupial and twisted depending on the flux i have. Got cleared out yesterday by 2 people. Moving again so have to redo the vending machine anyway. Was inspired by a build i saw the other day to build a pyramid. My burning man will have to wait for now.
---
try connecting the vendors to a keypad switch, that works for me but I don't know if it's different on xbox
---
+karma
---
Oof. Well, on the plus side you've opened up \~200 lbs in your storage.
---
Because they want to. It’s their camp. Deal.
---
Yeah me too
---
I can get in the game, I can't get in the atomshop it says it is offline.
---
I'm GMT-7 which would put reset time at 09:00.
---
Last I was online was 00:30, logged back in at 11:20.
---
I was in adventure when last online.
---
Thank you!!!
---
I like what they’ve done. I can spend cash anytime, this lets me get unique rewards instead of atoms I don’t need.
---
Some of the weeklys are giving the reward at 3/5 instead of 5/5 so you got the score earlier actually.
---
How can your stash hold 70 fusion cores???
---
I just always remove all the damage perks and use a week weapon like The Perfect Storm
---
It’s not flexing. It’s explaining that I use me handmade less than my axe, which probably means I’m not seeing a fast drop with my gun.
---
It wouldn't matter what kind of switch when the power becomes disconnected I risk having to restock my 3 machines
---
Ah. Makes sense. I apologize.
---
Grafton dam has one in the hut.
---
The last theory being thrown about on here is to do with completing challenges within the last hour of play time.
---
So when you were last on did you complete the dailies within the last hour you were playing? 
---
Sorry for all the questions, just trying to figure out if there's a pattern.
---
well I dunno what happened to you but I did not head this problem, only on whitezpring but is already a high lvl area, try to open a ticket to bethesda support if this stay happening
---
They removed bounty for picking lockes?
---
I fail to believe the story. Go ahead and nerf yourself with full hp and non legendary stuff, it’s quite simple yes?
---
what's the title/creator ?
---
get better friends? or no friends at all?
---
you could also play with full health. or just play a different build altogether.
---
your question doesn't make a whole lot of sense, really.
---
Any changes?
---
Under energy it says 10mm, but it is really fuel. It’s all I use the converter to buy.
---
&gt;  It can be miconstrued as offensive.
---
Which is exactly what you're doing.
---
i just don't see the point. why waste your inventory if no one is going to buy what you're trying to sell?
---
Ive talked about it already I didn't have any progress on them yet so I dont know how it would have rewarded me.
---
I keep shooting my neighbors before they turn into ghouls.
---
Kept restocking my shop with them from the stash, apoligise for making it seem like I had massive shop space
---
Being a public team by yourself is enough to trigger herd mentality, but not empath or stranger in numbers.
---
Tbf it’ll probably be bugged
---
Build....got to maximise dmg , not use weight reduction cards
---
I hate playing with other people, though.
---
It’s cool. I’ve found bugs are so erratic in this game.  Don’t experience them a lot. And I’ve never been perma bugged on some issues like some people are.
---
My level up complete automatically after the refresh, but I got the points for it. Thought it was wierd, but I had already lvl up like an hour before the refresh so I thought it was linked to that.
---
Modders fixed that in Fallout 4 years ago!
---
Yeah but the 25 percent xp increase is worth it to me
---
Ya, after all the bullion and rep grind I'm taking a break for awhile.
---
Someone should recreate this shot in a nuclear zone or in the firestorm in nuclear winter.
---
Don't forget to use the scrapper card for more steel from the weapons when you scrap them!
---
With full health, non-legendary, and fewer damage perks, I'm crippled. Low health, legendaries, full weapon perks, I'm unstoppable. I'm trying to find happy medium without totally changing my build.
---
It's worth noting I hold only my armour I wear and only use 3 weapons, the others I trade or give, again, I pride myself on my shop, its one of the only reasons I play, it's a large church, I'm hoping to post photos of it sometime
---
Noob question.. how do you share cards?
---
Because they want to double dip on the skins through the atom shop.
---
Shops still work with no power, they just don't show as vendors.   So if someone went there to repair and noticed the machines .... You may make that sale!
---
+ karma
---
Can you still kill things? Or are you just tagging and letting your team clean uo.?
---
Nah they are just roleplaying fallout world corporation in real life.
---
Turrets and crops take a TON of budget. Water and the Brahmin also take quite a bit.
---
I'm trying to to COMPLETELY cripple my character. Just nerf it by like 50-60%
---
So it’s not just me 🤪
---
were you online when the quests rolled over? i was yesterday and i had that issue, today i got off when they would update, and had no problems.
---
Do you also run tank killer?
---
then play at 75% health? or with a junkie's weapon? or with rank 1 of your weapon's damage perks?
---
I feel like there isn't much of a question here. just play around with the variables that make up a bloodied build? although that should be obvious to anyone.
---
I suppose one could push the afk person out into the wild and then just let nature ie some random scorched/feral do its thing.
---
But then those same afkers would probably be crying about how they were pvp'd unfairly and unjustly blah blah cry cry whine whine.....
---
Ok thanks
---
Have the same issue. https://i.imgur.com/Lt4LjJj.png
---
They're aware. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hjzzxs/are_you_kidding_me_challenges_autocompleting_still/fwq3ygv/
---
But whether or not they do anything this time is anyone's guess.
---
Very generous few things there I’ve never thought of
---
if you havent found anyone within 90 minutes I'll help you (thats when I'll be on) :-)
---
lately?
---
I don't really understand this response, it's like you didn't even read the thread, just the title.
---
The whole point is to create a central market that only exists for one or two days a month, and which would of course have caps to the number of things sold. That would not ruin the economy (what little economy actually exists in this game). Nothing would become stagnant and no price fixing would happen.
---
The whole point of my post was to avoid that kind of thing but creating an event that works for both sides of the point.
---
This is what I did. Plus if you get herd mentality mutation you get +2 int (more with class freak) for being on a team, even if your the only one.
---
Most run 4 charisma, there wont be a lot of options to share anything of any value.
---
Because Bugthesda
---
hope they respond soon and/or reimburse the 1000 score points
---
Unfortunately I was, and I now know this to be an issue. The horse had already bolted for me! However, it's Bethesda's job to fix the stable door.
---
Angry turtle takes a couple videos but explains everything in full and tests a couple things as well. Id go there. He even has a slide within the first minute of all the videos of the effects if you wanna screenshot it
---
Are you guys really surprised anymore?
---
I run 4 charisma, and can share strange in numbers, marathoner, aqua girl, cannibal, etc
---
I have a Bloodied auto 10ml pistol that I use when paired up with people. I can tag stuff without one shoting it since I don't have a single pistol perk,  I don't have to cripple my build by increasing my health, and my team gets hits too.
---
Exactly. No bloodied build would ask for a nerf, because when you run at high hp your weapon is just vanilla even lower damage than AA. The nerf is automatically done.
---
i met a guy who had prime receiver plans around 25 caps. i was afraid and amazed. so i only took the ones i absolutely needed. i was amazed about how many plans he had.
---
It doesn't need a foundation though. Not originally. That's new to Fallout 76. In Fallout 4 you could place walls on the ground no problem. There's really no reason for them to have changed that.
---
I guess they just don't want people building a wall around their camp without spending 80% of their budget on concrete walls.
---
It proclaims to other players that you are a food build and can’t manage your carry weight
---
I reiterate: 
---
It’s been like this since the beginning but after the big “oh hey we will fix it with this big update” it’s like...
---
Cool, thanks, you have left us out here to rot once again. So, yeah, lately I suppose. Post wastelanders.
---
unless that's a new bug, that shouldn't be happening.
---
before, i could be on at refresh/reset time and none of them would be autocompleted unless i was in nw at the time of it refreshing or i entered nw first when logging on instead of adventure.
---
it does look like they moved the refresh times to sync up with the atomic shop refresh (11am cst for me) and that could be an issue? bc before, 9am was when the dailies/weeklies would reset then the atomic shop would reset at 11am for me. 
---
four of seven dailies autocompleted for me yesterday but they were fine for me today and on tuesday. definitely inconsistent and annoying
---
I've got an entire hostel area set up, please stop stealing my brahmin milk
---
I got through the first 2.5 paragraphs, which was focused on how some people like these central auction horse, and some others don’t. 
---
So to me, you’ve set up the typical player market. 
---
Yeah. You say once or twice a month. Do you really think that’s going to last? You really don’t think it won’t lead to people wanting it all the time? 
---
So yeah. I read it.
---
I just hope that with the “c.a.m.p. Shelters” they are working on, we can put items wherever the fuck we want like in Fo4 just maybe using the camp placement mechanics
---
Same here. Gotta get that chicken coop
---
robbed??? it's designed like that so you spend atoms...
---
I did three of the damn weeklies yesterday morning and got no score. I had to grind out 300k exp to catch up.
---
The real surprise will be the day they get everything bug free!
---
Says the person that bought the game almost 2 years after release.  The game code is shit, Bethesda doesn't fix anything and when they do they break other stuff, and there's literally no end game.
---
If you come to play through wastelanders, its a fun game, but after that it will consume your soul through bugs, glitches, and boredom.
---
That too.
---
By patch you mean launch, right?
---
I'm guessing you don’t get that satisfaction of decorating your house with rare misc. items?
---
This.  West Tek is my go-to for a lot of challenges.  1 run through takes just a few minutes and you’ll pretty much get a level and 1-2 legendary kills out of it.
---
Yeah. I unlocked it last night and converted all my 6,000 rounds of .38 into 5.56. That works out hitting the enter key a bit over 1,000 times just to get several hundred rounds of 5.56.
---
However, the design intent seems to be for use after each cycle of explore/quest/loot/camp. If you do it that way each time you use the machine you won't be converting that much ammo.
---
Shelves that you have to glitch to use never made sense to me. Like giving someone a bowl with a hole in it
---
That option isn’t available until after the second week
---
Yeah, what can I say? 😠
---
Unless you get the dreaded "Server not Responding", you have a few minutes to log in again and get the same private world. I've had this happen once, and got a new private world when it happened.
---
I used to do Morgantown airport
---
Ooooh that makes a lot of sense. Thanks!
---
Tech debt, fix whats broken before adding a system that relies on something that is broken.
---
Consoles would be cool but i certainly don't want it with PC due to m&amp;k, increased fps, different settings and the hackers and modders.
---
or put a buffer in the vending machines to store the caps until you can remove them
---
ANYTHING other than caps into the void
---
Well, I'm on PS4.. But thank you for making me realize I now need yet another mutation. Guess I'm going shopping real quick. Lol
---
I knew it would change eventually, i play gears 5 and its iron system is made more in line with how 76’s atoms are now. 
---
You unlock loads of cosmetics during the season similar to gears 5’s tour of duty unlocking a small amount of atoms similar to iron in gears 5 but a lot of the stuff for sale is timed and more expensive than you can realistically earn. 
---
Being a fallout 1st member can minimise the problem but in the modern age of gaming this is just how it is.
---
I think people will be a lot more conservative with their spending, holding out for re releases on a sale.
---
Not certain on the answer for that one. I don't *think* that was the case, I'm reasonably certain I had them completed by 10pm. However I didn't mark down the time I last completed them.
---
I distinctly remember my last one was cryptids, and server hopping to do that. Logging off. Then coming back later to play a different character. I'm not certain the time frame of the log off / return and how long I was on afterwards. I want to say it was more than an hour but as mentioned, didn't exactly mark that one down.
---
I assumed so, but sadly the turret I set up was the only one. That's why I was so curious as to how people had such elaborate defences with a house as sizable as my own.
---
Sounds like a duper. In any case, I expect Bethesda to catch on and nerf this.
---
I get double score from some of the challenges. The destroy robots challenge gave me the 1k score when I finished one step and 1 k once I had finished the whole challenge
---
I haven't seen that event in ages I thought that they removed it for some reason.
---
I saw a similar post yesterday he had problems with mods so if u have mods installed this might be the problem
---
It's not just SB's since update 20 all crits in VATS can miss, I've missed crits on Bears, Ghouls, Dogs, People, everything.
---
At the very least I would appreciate the system telling me what object the item I'm trying to place is intersecting with so I don't have to tear apart 1/2 my camp trying to find it.
---
Yeah, not going to expect ANY of that to go as planned
---
Turn on your microphone, set it to area chat, and fast travel to a camp that has other players present. I mean, this is a post Nuclear War setting so populations are a bit sparse. Just try and make your way from the vault down to Welch all the way in the South. If you get there and didn’t have any fun, this game is most likely not going to be fun for you.
---
The early reset is actually helping me lol
---
Ya it doesn’t destroy everything it basically scraps your whole house but all the pieces are in your stored camp tab (except junk in display)
---
I don’t want to be shamed for bringing up this game, but Fortnite made battle passes popular and to get to tier 100, you did have to do every single challenge and grind extra xp for the couple months that the season was active.
---
I realized I always locked the door to my camp in FO76 because I wanted people to leave me alone EVEN IN A SOCIAL GAME!!! Big eye opener to me to be more open to talking to people and giving them a chance.
---
I'd recommend waiting until the end of the season. Higher the level, more SCORE it requires. Therefore you are "buying" more score the higher the level
---
It's got nothing to do with anti cheat and there probably isn't any actual anti-cheat in the game judging by what I have seen in NW and what I saw in workshop pvp and survival mode (anything goes for what can be cheated basically). People are still exploiting to basically insta-kill the sbq the moment she lands and have been doing it for over 8+ months now.
---
It's just spaghetti code from FO4 that beth austin has absolutely no idea how to fix, since the last I heard them comment on the person said it was probably a "visual bug" which is a LOL PEPEGA comment to the max.
---
I am having the same problem. I have picked up 10 or15 holotapes and none give credit for the daily challenge. Only with Bethesda!
---
I had so many issues yesterday I had a piece of wall refuse to be placed another piece refuse to be removed despite floating in the air not touching anything and then I had a random piece not line up with anything and block off half my camp that wasn't interactible then when I logged out and logged back in there were a bunch of wall pieces that had been invisible/ not there, I eventually decided to just make my camp really simplified
---
no but if they are pacifist mode. you cant hurt them. so its pointless to hunt bounties for a long time now
---
I sell all mine at 10% of the cost. Or drop them off at train stations...
---
Yet never seem to find them cheap myself.
---
I was having this issue where I couldn’t place my camp anywhere, it’s so annoying.
---
It happened to me with raider power armor when I try to exit I just ended up essentially viewing the armor skin from the inside and stuck.  I just logged out of the server quit the game restarted my computer they're for restarting Steam and logged back in and was able to normally exit.
---
It quit working when they updated Tuesday. Yesterday we finally got one of the community managers to acknowledge it. He said they are aware but have no timeline on when they'll get to it.
---
you don't actually have to play with them.  Just join a team and get the extra perks from being on it and do your own thing
---
I believe 150 Atoms are (possibly) the route Bethesda are taking. I'd rather they just fix it!
---
not if it's a katana or similar single edged sword
---
fortunately I'm still a young thoroughbred, with thick pulsating muscles and clean shining radiant skin so I can hit the vats button and fire to get a shot for credit
---
since before wastelanders I've yet to come to this and some other events without 2shot explosive degenerates who try to kill everything before the lower leveled can try and tag
---
What he said.  No.
---
There was a glitch a bit back that let you go over budget, but those people seem to be having issues now.
---
I wish I could upvote this twice since it represents my sentiment perfectly. Beth austin has absolutely no idea how to fix it for certain weapons so they won't even comment on it.
---
Pretty much anything other than what happens would be an improvement.
---
Fortnite had the same setup, and their’s was $10. People were fine with that.
---
Give credit where credit's due things in this game are at least 3/4 ass.  and it's still fun in that state so that's just get used to it and enjoy the 3/4 experience
---
I got ya, I went buy ultracite because I both dont use them, not to mention I get them from the ABC. But yeah I get your point, i usually go for camp plans like walls and furnature. Nearly bought out a few vendors because of this. Lol
---
Uranium Fever has 3 guaranteed legendaries.
---
Has it really been doing that since launch? I haven't had it happen till after this last patch. Doesn't surprise me tho.
---
&gt; It's to keep you coming back.
---
Well someone should tell them it's doing the opposite to me, lol. I've honestly been thoroughly enjoying the game thus far. It's just trying to find one single piece of the 2nd weakest PA that's killing it for me.
---
It's green but it wont place WTF!!!!
---
Yea I did it and got three 
---
Some guy gave me a thumbs down cause I "stole" his kill. Was unloading my .50 cal the whole event
---
It is not since update 20. The tesla, especially ones on auto, will bug out your damage after around 10-15 mins usually and have been doing so since beta. It is worse with auto tesla since it fires much faster and it seems like each shot you fire with a tesla has like a 2% chance to bug out that increases with the amount of time you have shot the tesla for, not even kidding.
---
Who cares.
---
Don't be that guy. Get a Tesla rifle!
---
 S.C.O.R.E. works as well as the ammo converter.
---
I dm newbs and low lvls all the time and hook them up with tons of goodies. Plans, meds, junk, even modded wetsuits to help out their leveling .
---
So you have to buy the flyboy salute! Teasing, honestly it's just another bug in a long string of them.
---
Hmm I am on Xbox, I will try these steps and let you know, mine is a little different with it saying I can't exit my PA no matter what.
---
Yeah, this is bullshit. Dailies and weeklies should award both atoms and score
---
I always have the wiki open on my second monitor so I can search locations of everything. A search function in game would be great.
---
What? You can definitely earn a bounty and get killed while in pacifist mode. I'm always on pacifist, and once I forgot somebody had claimed the workshop while dropping off my Red Rocket protectron cores and picked a lock. Got killed for it like five minutes later.
---
Yupp, probably in a fully bonded Event group smashing in high level events
---
The sad part is that you can see some sparks of genuine care and will to better the game and the franchise itself, which are (sadly) almost always oveshadowed by their greed and sometimes their incompetence. At least they somewhat try to listen to the community now.  :(
---
I knew I wasn’t the only one who had this problem
---
Yesterday I completed the daily challenge to kill robots, except I wasn’t awarded any S.C.O.R.E. which pissed me off. Really hope they fix it and future seasons don’t have this issue.
---
Then they give what you bought to everyone for free a couple of months later..
---
I can't share cards with 2 charisma
---
They No-life’s the better part of the week. Easily attainable if you’re unemployed.
---
Photo required
---
Don't do the camp budget glitch.  If you put up a scarecrow somewhere that your turrets can reach, enemies will aggro to it first and get rekt.
---
No it was a joke. I live in Florida, the vast wasteland of trailer parks and meth labs.
---
That's true, as much as they disappoint, they'll always hold a special place in my heart. It's the company we love to hate the most. I still have hope
---
First i need to start the pass
---
That would be awesome. But I can already listen my PS4 commiting sudoku
---
Unyielding plus herd plus egghead plus armor gives crazy intelligence plus food exp boosts plus lunchboxes. You can go crazy with xp boosts.
---
That’s awesome! I love meeting random friendly’s that drop me stuff on the ground! It’s even more exciting when it’s plans I haven’t learned yet!
---
I'm hoping for more interesting perk cards too, but I really, really wouldn't hold your breath for a stash size or CAMP budget increase from one.
---
Mine auto completed one today but I did get a score increase for it. Same with a friend
---
If you are on Xbox, join me sometime. I seem to have really good luck getting active servers, sometimes too active, lol.
---
Probably I wouldnt be surprised. Itll help give a little head start on plans I'll need that cost a but of capa
---
This is the problem with a “gotta catch em all” mindset. There’s a ton to do, and if you’re not concerned about collecting everything and “getting to 100” then it’s not a bad grind.
---
From a somewhat newer player perspective, there’s tons and tons of content, events, etc. I think all games become a grind when that’s pretty much all you’ve been gaming on for months on end. 
---
Honestly if you’ve got no love for it don’t even do dailies, take a break from it and discover a new game or rediscover an older game. Rewards are often either cosmetic or can be obtained again down the road so there’s no reason not to take a break. And honestly losing out on some rewards might help break the “gotta login and grind!” mentality people tend to develop with these MMO type games.
---
Just my 2 cents.
---
Best way to go.
---
&gt;I kinda feel bad for those who grinded NW to get ghillies and now anyone can get them by chewing gum and killing lvl 1 scorched.
---
Don't feel bad for me.  I did an annoying but easy grind to get NW ranks, so now I don't need to stress about Seasons because every reward past rank 4 is utter garbage.
---
Nah I know, got to stay hopeful though
---
Im curious if the Witcher series was enough of a hit, that Amazon wanted to do a tie in of their own.
---
They already do twitch promo's for 76, next maybe merch?
---
I had a similar problem as OP when starting my second character. When doing the pre-level 20 Wastelanders questline, there are level 60 ghouls that just spawn without reason. 
---
My advice is to try to find a small group to help you, go around the enemies, or try to fight them and hope for the best
---
Thanks for sharing your equally pointless opinion.
---
Well, that's one way of doing it :D
---
And thank you! This post has been edited to include the link.
---
Very true. I am glad that that’s not needing to be reworked after the release.
---
Standard Operating Procedure, my friend.
---
I imagine there's probably a combination of boxes that need to be ticked to trigger it, and somehow I accidentally did just that
---
4th of July reminds me of s’mores so I put them in my vending machine free for this weekend.
---
This has been the same since launch, unfortunately. Here’s my copy pasted post that I throw up every once in a while about the same things.
---
“STILL can’t change voice output... How the **** is this still a thing...
---
Fast travel not initiating
---
Non legendary enemies “mutating”
---
Enemies randomly dropping dead. 
---
Consistently inaccurate damage, some weapons affected differently in/out of vats
---
Camp intersection/floating placement issues, and the worst snap points of any “complete” game, period.”
---
well yesterday.. lvl 12 person 10 credit bounty on him. me full bloody build. 50 cal bloody sniper rifle. im standing in his house. put a round in his head. he just waves. workshop pvp vs lock picking bounties are different.
---
Usually there is a way to re-anchor it and fix it all, but not always. Sometimes when its recursive, the only spot for a re-root object would be buried and thus the whole arrangement is unsalvageable
---
So you dont want to help others?
---
By your own first fucking sentence there are already NUMEROUS posts AND they have official responses from Bethesda already.
---
What the fuck does creating ANOTHER post demanding ANOTHER response accomplish other than farming some upvotes?
---
Hi cap
---
There's some issues in game right now, that make you able to receive huge benefits from stacked this and thats. It's ok, it's no secret how they got there, not legitimately. Easily caught, but will anything be done about it? We'll see.
---
I can answer that, for money.
---
Unyielding/egghead/herd mentality/berry mentats/brain fungus soup will put you pretty close to 40 int.  Eat Cranberry relish and Use well rested and you'll get around 360'ish xp for a lvl 68 super mutant warlord.  I'm sure I left something out of the list, but you get the idea.  High INT drives your xp gain.  Do it.
---
I notice it always happens after I play NW. I think its some kind of bug any time there's a notification in the corner
---
Same, lost loads of score today, it even showed the gold challenge (complete 5/5 daily challenge) as complete when there only 2 auto completed, so 750 score disappeared.
---
Nice bug you got there, would be a shame if someone were to PATCH it.
---
The Unstoppables.
---
It annoys me that the fallout universe had a thing for superheroes, and we only have a few quirky quests for lore.
---
I would guess it's a visual synchronization problem.  Because your computer does some calculations, it also decides if you hit or not and how much damage you do.  Then it sends this up to the server, and the server is reconciling with everybody else, so it also gets to say "yes/no" -- sometimes it says no.  So your computer has to rewrite things because even though it thought it was going to drop it 10%, it didn't actually get approved.
---
Thus it looks like a rubberband.
---
The simple fix that they should implement is just not to change the health bar until AFTER the client gets acknowledgment from the server.
---
So far i have collected 13 holo tapes and not gotten the dailiy to complete.
---
i dont have any mods, only thing i really got is the Custom.ini
---
I'm a noob to fo76 .. the other day some dude had a stack of awesome plans at 10c .. I only had about 70c .. think I bought 3 .. but I was over the moon 😊 thank muchly cheap plans dude 😊👍
---
I'm not AFK, I'm attempting a hostile takeover of Bethesda!
---
Actually. I just lock myself in the restroom to go AFK to go to the restroom.
---
Even then, it triggers the positive effects if your on a public team - even if your the only one
---
Just got there a little while ago, no such luck. Doesn't reset.
---
Their is so many camp issues that I honestly wonder if they will ever get addressed.
---
Such as .
---
1. Stairs, what the holy fuck is going on here, so many issues, I just had to rebuild my ENTIRE CAMP, because i could not scrap a staircase which had nothing attached too it nor near it. 
---
2. Making items green as per the title, I mean come on.
---
3. Saying intersecting or giving any form of error WITHOUT TELLING ME WHAT WITH.
---
4. No option to move entire buildings like we could in fo4.
---
No doubt I could go on but this needs some confirmation it's being looked into u/valseek perhaps? not asking for a miracle or it being fixed even in patch 21, but just knowing it's being considered would be ideal for me.
---
Then its that
---
Oh yeah I hear ya lol. I go through the same thing. What's extra fun is finding the rest of a complete set that I scrapped long ago. I dont really mind but still...its like really? 😂 I'm not bitter about it, it's just a very noticable patter.
---
Yeah me, I remember Bethesda was carried like they were God's before I got into any of their games. Now I'm here and we got... Whatever the hell this is.
---
Supposedly they actually brought a lot of that code in to make the server /network implementation, stitching it onto the client piece that was fallout4.
---
Yep. It sucks for loot but can be great fun for photo mode.
---
The pattern continues, doesn't reset.
---
That's a good point, I havent heard much about the witcher series. Any good company should expand its roots into further avenues. I just wish they'd focus on what theyve broken before jumping to something else. 
---
Id imagine there's figurines and such already, but I'm sure itll blow up even further, anything for a buck. That's the Bethesda way
---
It was a high level players mule I bet
---
Because it has to be an atom shop item to use in NW.   Regular Adventure items can't be used.
---
I can kill things just fine, just not utterly destroy them like usual.  When I am on a team, I usually just tag and let the others do the work.  All I really want is the XP and Score.  I still get loot from anything that I tag or are near when my teammates kill it, so I grab any legendaries and scrip them, and pick up loose caps.
---
I have the feeling you don’t understand my request
---
now???
---
it is, i see it in the atom shop
---
In most cases, it first has to have a fire rate of ~200 or higher, and you must be on a high latency server (99.9% of public servers). Their public servers have a difficult time calculating damage under these circumstances, and other more obscure ones. But once those requirements are met, and if it has one of these “magic” attributes, it will trigger the uncapped Furious effect.
---
I apologise for trying to help get a reply for those other posts. I really do not care about upvotes. Downvotes can be somewhat upsetting though!  I appreciate your polite decorum - what a wonderful person you must be. Thank you for your insight and wonderful post.
---
U get score at 3/5
---
Yup also been hoarding radioactive waste for crafting, can't figure out why my hair is falling out.
---
lel
---
I played for a little bit at launch and got pretty bored. Made it to lvl 20 though. I just started back up again a couple days ago and im having a decent time. I like to join public teams and try to help out with whatever they're doing, even if I am severely under leveled for it. I fought SBQ the other day and my bullets might as well have just bounced off it. All the higher levels around kept me safe from the Scorched there that seemed like they could easily kill me. Oh and one of the higher level players dropped a bunch of plans I didnt have and gave it to me. None of my friends play and I would get pretty bored playing alone. The public teams help me not be so bored.
---
Any news on this? I didn't even know there was a mountain scout mask
---
Once more a new feature has been pushed out, and nobody thought to fix long standing bugs that could impact said new feature.
---
I do not in any form or manner blame the developers, someone likely warned of this, but the deadlines was pushed forward by management.  I have a pessimistic approach that management even left the issue in to hopefully create additional Atom sales when people need the extra levels.
---
Lol yea, I feel your pain. They really set the bar back in the day. As much as I want to despise them, I just feel pity now
---
What do you mean? Can you explain?
---
There are external cooling fans you can pick up at Amazon. You set your laptop on them. Just watch your temperatures without a stand and if they are too high, then opt for an external laptop cooler. You can pick one up for 30-60 bucks.
---
I mean, I’m unemployed but I’m a stay at home dad with an 8 month old, so...
---
Yeah exactly. When I first started playing I was actively looking for shelf plans as I thought this. 
---
Didn’t take long for me to realise they’re just a way of using up the camp budget
---
I believe that means your sharing it, but it's red because your not in a team
---
At my camp everything is super cheap. All plans I get, rare or not are priced at an affordable price, and if any low level needs the plan and cant afford it all they need is to tell me which one and I'll give it to them. Obviously I don't need it if I've already learned it lol. Same with guns and armor I dont use or wear
---
Not a noob, just a mixture between a mule and a playable character
---
When u reach 3/5 goals u get score and at 5/5 nothing it has been going thru here the past days
---
you would have to rework your setup almost from the ground up, moving most strength into Perception, and possibly more agility and luck if going sneak and vats crit
---
first of all, i think the text is all over the place in this post.. tried my best to edit it, but im really bad at that on reddit, so hope it will do :)
---
im currently playing alot on my own vanguards shotgunner. i have taken the time to put everything i could into the build planner, so here you go;

actually uploaded a video for a friend of mine new to the game, to showcase the build for him, since he doesnt know what to build and asked for suggestions. got a minor upgrade or 2 since, but nothing which matters:  
---

---
i know the build is not optimised by any means, but with this build im breezing through everything no problem.   
---
about the ammo problem, using ammosmith and super duper helps ALOT. same goes for the scrapper perk - i know i know... i just forget to equip it WHEN scrapping, so made it a thing to have it on at all times.
---
the secondary perks in CHA is for when grouped up, which is always these days.. having those to swap out in case someone else is sharing strange in numbers
---
\*i think i have everything covered here.. but if not, feel free to ask and ill do my best to answer.
---
I reckon I probably lost 5 or 6k today because of the exact same reasons, shit happens now and then. It's not ideal and something needs to be done about it but I'm not loosing any sleep over it, caps are so easy to come by in this game.
---
I feel like a dodo after reading this, I didn’t even think about how I’m still rocking max level lone wanderer while playing on a team. Thank you for posting this so I can optimize my perk loadout for teams
---
Ooooo, that one.   Not sure.  Maybe try restarting the game?
---
Guided Meditation Before Sleep Let Go of the Day:
---
Guess i gotta find more combat rifles to scrap
---
Yes but what about the singular ones, such as “level up 3/3 times.” I completed that and have not received any points.
---
Same. 2 mins after the dailies went live it had auto completed most while I was at my CAMP. I didn't get the subsequent SCORE later. Sent a ticket in to Bethesda with picture proof (5/5 dailies completed etc).
---
Just got an auto response saying I should leave it as feedback..
---
Not great.
---
If only I had tons of .38 rounds
---
Yeah, lol. Funnier though, I managed to find 4/6 T-51b pieces before I was even able to equip T-45.
---
For that you should or did you receive no score at all (are you lvl 1 on the legendary run?)
---
What about addictions? How many i needs?
---
If you look at it like it was a different type of company it makes perfect sense the old system gave out so many free atoms no one really needed to buy them unless they were lazy
---
Example 
---
If you were to go to an ice cream shop and asked for a sample and they gave you an entire scoop as a sample would you spend money on ice cream no why would you but make the sample small so they get a taste but want more.  This is a standard business model used for decades
---
Do you have the scrapper perk? I can get at least 400 steel for doing uranium fever and about the same for west tec. Also you can buy bulk lead and steel if you have the caps
---
5 at max, pick and choose the ones with the effects that hurt you the least.
---
yes i do.
---
Yeah for casual players it was fun to chase dailies for atoms and get a cool reward now and then. Now, meh...
---
No I’m not lvl 1, I’m rank 11 on the legendary run. With the two I don’t have I should be 13.
---
I think it was removed during the BETA or right after release
---
Absolutely agree, i was trying to find the brick building set but it's not cheap from bot vendors, almost 4k caps... and somehow ended up in someone's camp selling it for 100 caps and you can imagine how happy i was lol
---
Person from the mountains here. You can will prolly get snow in october
---
I was logged into Adv this morning when they switched over and mine were fine. Is it only happening when you're in a Nw match? That's been around since atom challenges, can't believe they haven't fixed it
---
When you’re on a team, there are a few perks which are shared to your teamates only if you have them in your build.
---
This one i havent heard of then  some didnt get any score but this doesnt seem to be the case
---
Since I posted this, I've seen a couple of different videos that explained it better and Juicehead was wrong. I don't think he even did the math himself, just parroted another source. And besides,  a lot can happen in 10 weeks. That's like at least 2 years in Bethesda time.
---
Can we get a Scrapbox in Whitesprings, Crater, and Foundation, it would be nice not too have to walk a mile while overencumbered just too place down my tent just too scrap junk. Also, some type of workbench in the tent would be helpful as well.
---
Cool idea with the ghoul
---
Bugthesda fixing bugs? Hahahahahahaha
---
It is still in game but it cannot be activated :/  
---
We just "recreated" this event :D
---
I tested the blueprints thing trying to get the most basic Camp I could place anywhere yet have all workbenches and other essentials. I found that a 2x2 foundation floor with all workbenches and 1 radio in the middle _will_ be placeable as a blueprint, but the exact same with **two** radios is _not_ placeable. I added many other items to see if the extra radios had just pushed the blueprint over some kind of limit, but no. Blueprints can't have 2. 
---
Logic overload
---
Would suppressor be good?
---
I’ve had several time when trying to target with VATS and it doesn’t recognize the enemy.
---
Ah, how it hurts to be unique :( well I appreciate the help anyway, thank you!
---
You said you can't hurt someone with a lock-picking bounty. I just told you how I got killed after earning a lock-picking bounty. My bounty was from picking an already-existing lock in an owned workshop, not for trying to claim it.
---
Not to mention, most good limited stuff has a short duration in the shop, meaning you will have to buy atoms if you want a certain thing and can't earn enough during the week.
---
Concentrated Fire if you use VATS. Ground Pounder if you don’t. CF 3* is fantastic for VATS, as each shot, regardless of whether or not it lands, increases your hit chance by 20%. This, coupled with high Luck and a few choice perks, and you’ll be spamming crit shots. If you’re missing the increased reload speed from Ground Pounder, pick up the Speed Demon mutation.
---
You go into your perks and you’ll see a share option on all your active perks. To share a level 1 card you’ll need 3 charisma, to share a level 2 card you’ll need 6 charisma and so on. Try strange in numbers on a team if you’re mutated, jumping even higher with marsupial and running even faster with speed demon is so awesome lol
---
Thanks I appreciate it. Does it also mean I benefit from the perks even if I'm not on a team.
---
Thank you I appreciate the help.
---
youst place your camp module
---
Depends on the perk, some perks exclude you which is stated in the description of the card but most are beneficial for you and your teammates.
---
Lol a gamma gun is going to do nothing to someone in PA. The rad resistance is way to high... why do you think people wear them in nuke zones.....
---
I didn’t know you could do that in Nuclear Winter. That’s why I was confused; because it said it was a Nuclear Winter challenge.
---
psa: hot swap your goal just before an event ends to event team, then swap back to building to maximize effects
---
Junkie's adds 50% damage with 5 addictions, you dont have to maintain the addictions in any way just have to have them. They will lower your special stats a bit but as long as you choose the right ones, not by much.
---
Bloodied adds 5% damage for every 5% health lost, so it goes up to like 95% I think. Although it goes higher, most people lower their health to 20% (80% damage) because of other low health bonuses (adrenal reaction and nerd rage).
---
So junkie's will do more damage as long as you have your addictions and your health it above 50%. Bloodied has the highest damage output in the game though so a lot of people choose that. If you compared a low health bloodied build (20% health) to a low health junkies build (20% health), bloodied with do about 30% more damage. I like junkie's because it is more versatile
---
Hello, do you play in third person? I had a glitch where I couldn’t exit my pa in third person. Switched to first and everything was fixed. Happens time to time.
---
I don't like to dick around with prices so every plan I sell is 100 caps. Doesn't matter if it's an ashtray or a radiation arch. I also sell all recipes for 50 caps. I might not get rich but I always have money.
---
I fixed VATS by restarting the game but still no enemies on compass.
---
I planned on it, I just wanted to know how to beforehand. Wanting to know things too early is a bad habit of mine haha
---
It has to be that. There is honestly no other explanation.
---
Bethesda has had different, completely new (to Creation Engine... they have some experience with a mobile game) devs working on separate parts of the game with what appears to be zero communication.
---
That's why we get stuff that LOOKS good from an art perspective that doesn't end up working either because of how the mesh interacts with the world (paratrooper bag sitting part way below the ground, multiple outfits clipping badly, stairs that clip out of their "zone" and don't attach properly to other stairs even, furniture that has way too many hidden "no touchy" zones that block other items, etc).
---
It also seems to affect building just like you said. Nothing else short of insane amounts of lag explain stuff that's solidly green and visually correct to add or move that errors out consistently.
---
It's heartbreaking. This game HAD so much potential, but it's been entirely squandered by carelessness and an attitude of "good enough for now, we'll fix later".
---
It never is. And it never will be.
---
lol I built a nw defence tower as a blueprint and can use it in nw 🤣
---
yes, drifter 
---
i like it as well, combine it with fashionable raider helmet and u lookin' raider as hell
---
do you even know how many atoms (money) they would miss if they did this???? this is bethesda
---
I saw that the challenges that need five tasks done will reward you after only three completed. Maybe it looks like you didn't get points because you already did.
---
Todd?
---
Considering that the "complete the rest of them" one is done when the others clearly aren't, it's straight up impossible to have your completion be in this state.
---
That's really awesome of you to do. I'm just getting back into the game and I always play on private servers because I still have a lot of trust issues, it's why I quit back in Jan of '19. But again, awesome stuff.
---
It’s the stairs that always get you. Remove stairs before moving camps.
---
Would love to know those as well.
---
I started playing in third person a lot more lately because of this.
---
You can build a wall of Mr. Pebbles plushes in the normal game, blueprint it and then place them all over in NW. The possibilities are endless.
---
I always share scrapper cause I think that's a card no one has in their builds, but I made room for it in mine.
---
mine's a little less contrived.  built a pub/trading post on the cliffs behind vault 76, overtop the cave with the skeletons and hole in the roof.
---
did it so that a locked nuka cola secret door opened from the bar area into the hole.  have a powered door in my loft apartment over the hole as well.  blocked off the ground floor exit with a locked door as well.
---
there's been a few people who got suspicious of the cola door, didn't pay attention to the circus cage with mattresses and a bathtub marked "food storage", nor did they go down to see the outside of the cave was locked and marked "employees only"
---
they just zipped out of the bar, around the outside and dropped down the hole.  hopefully the skeletons, bone totems, grill, electric chair. and locked door they were now behind gave them the proper hint that my sexy astronaut and i?  we're cannibals :-P
---
They said that they know this is an issue and they're going to fix it... Two months ago...
---
Its about 1250 score points around level 15. Which isn't much. However the point I was trying to make wasn't the it wouldn't be a grind, there's no such thing. I mean that it is possible if you do all the daily and weekly challenges as well as grind xp (which 2 new xp boosts have been add that also stack). 
---
To be honest, like with every new thing added to the game. People are looking to find ways to attack Bethesda regardless if it makes sense. In this sense, it doesn't. Its a free battle pass replacing the atom grind which very few people did. Of course it's going to be a grind because the whole point of a battle pass is to be grindy so you pay to skip it. But overall this barely is a grind compared to other battle passes out there. Most people will actually gain more from this than the old system.
---
Oh, I’m sorry... Stay safe and watch out for Florida Man
---
"We're whalers on the moon, we carry a Harpoon, but there ain't no whales so we tell tall tales, and Sing our Whaling tune!"
---
This is a great idea for an otherwise underwhelming weapon, even if it just did an old style wing weapon damage and down the scorchbeast.
---
That or give me a Dragon Rend Shout.
---
Well, those quests and characters you're enjoying didn't exist back when this game was getting shit on.
---
Im at the north end of the ash heap not too far from the Rusry pick.  I usually sell eveything. Weapons, ammo, armor, chems, junk.
---
I use my vending machines to generate the caps to buy what ammo I can. Currently sitting on 55k 5mm, 12k shotty shells, 60k .45 &amp; 50k .556 (don't use these).  With bandolier rank 2 the .45s and 5mm don't weigh anything and the rest next to nothing. 
---
Once I'm getting close to max caps I'll vendor/server hop until I've spent at least 10k on ammo. Sometimes I'll use the trading sub as you can get better than 1:1 on anything other than .45 and .556
---
I'll agree with you on this point. I think I was mainly trying to say you either need to really grind or not miss more than a day or two and play the double xp/SCORE weekends. Noone is truly close yet unless they have done nothing but grind the past few days
---
I just hit level 40 yesterday so still a new player. I sell all plans/recipes at 10% of the listed value. 30% on Aid and Weapons/Armor, and 1c for all Ammo. I was helped out early on too so these prices seem fair and I move a lot of inventory everyday.
---
Couldn’t hurt.
---
What do you mean by "only prioritizing 3 cards"?
---
That sounds awsome but could be a P.I .T.A 👍 lol
---
that sounds like communism. it is your stuff, not our stuff

---
here's the build im currently using. all the secondary cards i've added are situational. i have tenderizer in both rank 1 and 2, but can only add 1 of them in the planner. its just to swap around perks to fit properly while grouped these days. same reason i got my CHA to 6 to be able to share 2\* perks.
---
auto2 (junkies - no addictions, its just what was available): primed handmade
---
all armor pieces are secret service except left leg, which is metal (light)
---
chemist backpack mod
---
the armor pieces are obviously not well optimised, but its the best i was able to craft so far, even though i've spent about 90 or so modules XD
---
This is sadly not done enough.  They should really put out a video.  I think more people would enjoy NW.  The guy who showed me had blueprints for all scenarios.
---
Level 25 huh. I've been holding onto an amazing double barrel shotgun with quad legendary meaning you can fire it a bunch of times rather then the standard 2. It was game changing for me and I used it up to level 40. I've been holding onto it to give a lower level player. If your on PC you can have it for free.
---
Not bad, not bad, (slow clap)
---
oh ok lol
---
Yes on marsupial. Next I suggest speed demon, then adrenal reaction. These 3 are the most popular in the game if you want to help other players and will pay for themselves eventually. Just make sure to max sell the vendor first, then buy, then max sell the vendor again. If you do it this way the serum essentially costs 15k when you do it right.
---
🙏 thanks
---
All the power to you. You got a really good build, really good gear, and you're making it work.
---
I mean.
---
That's how the game works, is it not?
---
&gt;	the whole thing behind is complicated and tedious that's why you can't build any shit on 97% of the games out there.
---
Unless you are an expert in the field, have a degree in the field, or *at least* half a decade working the field as a career and not some autodidact of 'programming', you're not really qualified to say what is and isn't, and more importantly, I couldn't care less about what you have to say.
---
Exactly you chase those low levels down and make them take your known plans
---
Yes, just after patch 20, I had the same experience, it did a constant switching of my pictures same as yourself one second each.
---
You'll get much more of a sense of pride and accomplishment if you pay for atoms later on to finish the legendary run than if you just played the game and earned them.
---
The armor skins arent for NW. Only the ghillie suit and hood outfit
---
Did you buy the tricentennial version of the game?
---
Oh, so you're the communism expert then? None of that negates my distinction between Communism and Socialsm, which are two different ideologies.
---
10 caps says when they figure this bug out, they'll give everyone a few thousand score points to make up for it. Maybe 500 atoms too. They have the ability to do anything they want with their game, they just choose not to.
---
Oh okay. Yeah getting to the end is going to be a massive grind. Though I don't understand why people are shocked. I mean Fortnite requires you to pay if you want descent stuff and a lot of season required people playing a ungodly amount to get to tier 100.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if after a score weekend people claim down.
---
Same here. Lone wanderer when solo.  Teamed up it's Inspirational rank 3 and strange in numbers which is shared.
---
Same here. Woke up, logged in, half my challenges are done. EVERYONE needs to write a ticket that this affected. It was one thing to get screwed out of atoms but an entirely different fuckery to screw us out of the system that was meant to screw us.
---
Thank you! This was indeed very helpfull!
---
Thank you for the information. I can’t do all of this, because my original character was non-auto rifles and power armor (spoiler: not a good idea without vats), but it does help.
---
I sell all plans for the suggested price with the last digit truncated. example sugested price 500 my price 50. keeps them moving pretty fast
---
&gt; why are there both 1st person and 3rd person cameras?
---
New to Bethesda games, huh? lol
---
Do you know where you go to do that? It doesn't give me any any options to delete anything and I have an ally built in it so it wont let me complete any of the other ally side quests.
---
Yeah its really annoying because it wont let me complete any other ally side quests because you can only have one built at a time.
---
Say it louder so Bethesda can hear you!!!!!!!!
---
Yeah it was the stairs and a water spout that I built on a hill but for some reason it stored the whole thing together. Rookie mistake I guess haha.
---
It's likely due to the port from fallout 4.
---
Client side system for something like building is fine in a singleplayer game; but can cause serious exploitable issues or vulnerabilities in a multiplayer game.
---
So they likely added an additional system for multiplayer, but were too lazy to revise/remove the one designed for an offline experience.
---
Hey. I can be online if you are around?
---
Atoms, baby. Open your wallet.
---
get  closer
---
Dude, stop. How can the state own the proceeds of labor when there is no state
---
Did any of you lost this atoms after the update?
---
I had 1500 atoms and now they gone.
---
I dunno, Instigating The Dragon tends to delete anything in one shot...   
---
And if that doesn't do it, I've got a AP 10mm SMG that removes everything else.
---
I was right below it. Even used a long ranged gun. Their health bar appears, but they take no damage.
---
i'm on ps4 too, and F.O.U.R.  fucking F!O!U!R! of my 250 score dailies didn't give me any score.  had two 1000 point weeklys give me points at 3/5.  had a third 1000 score weekly.... give me nothing.
---
also lost my ally daily, which was to kill a blood eagle.  got to the location, killed the eagle, server crashed before i got back to sophia.  now i have no quest in my log, sophia won't give me a new one, and i'm just screwed out of a daily.
---
by the same token.... holy fuck is the new patch crashy.  tried playing for two hours today.  like clockwork 15-20 mins in the game crashed.  on the plus side it is logging in faster than it has in a long time, but gods is it unstable.  elder scrolls online on ps4 was working fine, so my net doesn't seem to be the issue.
---
the collective whole of bethesda at this point deserves to have an extra flame jets shishkabob rammed up their behinds.
---
For real this one is seriously the easiest of challenges
---
They have been in the works to make a Fallout TV show for over 10 years, it's not a new thing.
---
Yeah I used to play grindy phone games. Either you pay or dont get to the final reward
---
nw bug.  been in the game since wastelanders launched on ps4 for me.  find it mega goofy that it has now survived several patches.  i mean, i might be ignorant, but i seriously can't believe that it is a complicated bug to fix or find, seeing as how for me, it has happened every single time i've played nw and then played adventure mode without restarting the game.
---
&gt; having to do reputation on 5 characters was a killer
---
"having to do" That's some dedication, but didn't you question whomever told you you had to grind rep on all 5?  /s
---
I had to switch to a short scope
---
I’m losing SCORE every single day due to auto complete with no rewards. I want compensation.
---
Aw, man. Thanks for the intel
---
I just want the combat rifle skin that's around level 60 so I should be fine to get that. Other than that I don't really care.
---
&gt;trolling
---
Oh I see.  So complain about how long the board game will take and how its difficult for someone with a job and I get complained and yelled at -- so I do the same to you all and I still get complained and yelled at.
---
Reddit, home of double standards.
---
There's also the hunt meat events that spawn a ton of enemies, scrip, and a guaranteed legendary. The rewards for meat week included the Bloody chef out fit and hat, the Grill master hat, the Tenderizer melee weapon and plans to mod it. The other good reward was trading with Graham himself as he sells some rare plans and you can hop the location to cycle his inventory.
---
What area, specifically?
---
I built around a rail car.i can't have anything flush against one of the walls due intersecting issues. Anything I try to place even if it is green I can't. For whatever reasons there seems to be an intersecting issue with the ceiling. Anything placed down ends up get sucked up into the ceiling.
---
Bro, same thing happened to me! Had a metric ton of plan copies; guy came in, snagged them all, then stuck them in HIS store for like 20 caps each
---
I finally got one to work at pleasant valley ski resort on my privet server.
---
Honestly most of the NW dailies are a piece of cake and fast to complete except for increasing your overseer rank, reviving another player, killing AI creatures and killing other players. There's the camp one, using stims (just spawn on the edge of the map away from other people find some stims and run into the fire), taking photos and surviving for x amount of time, which is easy to do just hiding in a bush.
---
The sight is center screen I have one eye and have no issue with this
---
"Weird, the mailbox we set up to collect the bug reports was set to automatically delete all incoming mail."
---
Double standards all over this place.   I said its hard to do with full time job and IRL responsibilities in another thread, and I get down voted into oblivion.  And everyone attacks me and its cool -- so I do to Reddit what Reddit does to me and I am still downvoted and insulted.
---
Double Standards.
---
Waste of a psa. People that couldn't figure this out for themselves can't read.
---
Todd did - cause of how they designed the system where you can't trade anything between your characters.
---
Is there someone out there that can make a mod? :P
---
No offence but there's absolutely no chance you did enough damage to be able to loot the queen. However, someone in your team did, which is why you found loot in her corpse.
---
That being said, congrats dude.
---
As long as your not looking for clothes
---
People are forgetting the double S.C.O.R.E and XP weekends that will literally skyrocket players and cut their time in half. Instead of 100 super mutants to achieve 10k, it’s only 50. That’s like 200 score every 1 and a half West Tek Runs (because it won’t be 100 anymore, it will be boosted to 200). So you can get the equivalent of an entire weekly in 6ish West Tek Runs. Seeing how you can easily grind one out in 5 minutes, you can achieve the equivalent of a weekly every 30 minutes of game time. Or 2k score per hour. That’s pretty good.
---
Just buy what you want and submit a ticket saying you bought it by mistake and ask if they can find it in their heart to issue a refund. 
---
I've done it 3 times in the past month and each time they refunded the atoms quickly and also let me keep the items I "accidentally" bought.
---
Wow that sucks, thanks for letting us know
---
Will this move your current CAMP in the public world?
---
I agree. They've put some really good rewards in there. I'm actually happy about this.
---
I had no idea about this! Time to go find a herd mentality serum lol
---
I ran across players like this when I was a low level, dropping gear and weapons and aid for me to help me along. Now I do the same, hoping that when they are a higher level they’ll do for the lower levels what was done for them.
---
Atom says.. Free the Atom!!
---
Had 2500, now I’m at 150.
---
Aaagh, came here to see if I was the only one.  Seems not.
---
Havent played since the last update but is it the mysterious strangers riff??
---
Some guy was selling the psycho recipient for 5 caps in his vending machine, made me pretty happy.

"Entertainment"
---
Loving it.  Managed to complete project paradise 3 times today and encryptid once thanks to them.
---
Just make sure you don’t have fill team on.
---
The difference between 35 and 45 isn't that much, so it's still usable if you plan on going bloodied.
---
That's interesting.  May need to join teams more often.  If I can complete the challenges without ending up with more legendaries I can't scrip today but feel compelled to hang onto anyways eating up stash, that would be nice.
---
well now is the perfect time to grind those levels to get the cards you need then :p join an event group and jump around for events. travel agent helps a bit on the fast travelling there, but even without it, alot of people have fallout 1st "survival" tents. while in group with people you can fast travel to those tents (or their camps) for free.
---
no
---
Yeah, I get 10 atoms per challenge for some reason. With one challenge a season reward, I went from 250 atoms to 560 in 4 days. That’s pretty good.
---
Private world, sneak clearing whitesprings golf seems to gain mega XP. Get Intelligence as high as you can and go to town
---
Godmode glitch not fixed after all, huh?
---
That I didn't know, interesting. Though 10 years to make a tv show that already has all the lore in place doesn't surprise me one bit lol
---
Yea it’s pretty sweet. You can blueprint large defensive structures and just plop down everywhere in NW
---
16 times the entrapment!
---
Why u cant see your level progress  in your  pipboy is beyond me.
---
u/Mouseclarke do you want to team up? im only level 8 but i would like someone to play with
---
thanks for the help just realised all my furious weapons are broke so im gona try and get some anti armour ones
---
Excellent. Never trust sexy astronauts: it's the first rule of business.
---
For fast xp beef stew (mama dolches) event feed the people. Use it on sorched earth SBQ event. Do events with ( ! ). Do graft on day or any event that repeats with out the exclamation mark. Do quests. Keep up the grind my friend tedious but worth it. Scrap ammo. And cook a lot and sale at vendor for caps. Also join intelligence public group and use appropriate perks if you have them.
---
I am.  On server running SBQs
---
I drop and pick up stuff between my characters all the time (on a private server), but of course you can't do that with the bullion purchased gear, which is likely what you're referring to.  But with the time you've got in game, I bet you could have outfitted 3 characters or more with top tier gear and avoided the bullion grind.   Then again, I bet you enjoyed the journey, so I should just shut the hell up.  Sorry for rambling.
---
I think there should be a sidequest chain dealing with the aftermath of your raid on 79.  The reactor needs further repairs, the breech needs to be repaired and sealed, scavenging parts to repair the defensive systems and so on.
---
Was the quest Death from Above?
---
I shot down the three vertibots with one shot each w/guass shotgun 2 hours ago on PS4. Cargobot down with a handmade mag.
---
Its just a quest that helps u prepare for the silo and get the queen the silo can be run again and again dont worry
---
Ive had messages of thanks for low priced plans @ 5C. Some of the key stuff like s'mors recipes and badge related plans really help people that have not started at day 1.
---
The Flatwoods Fletcher bow skin works in NW but the armor skins don't. It makes zero sense.
---
This same feeling except when i go to vendor at train station. The only plans i believe i have left are all the PA mods that go for 5k-6k a piece but every now and then i’m pleasantly surprised.
---
My worry is that as soon as the 10 weeks are over, we’re back at it for season 2. The grinding never stops. We will never find peace.
---
Oh, is it that mothman church? I came across it one time on PC. The ally was dressed up as a mothman cultist and the church had a shrine with the mothman on it.
---
Well of course they can't! Their little hamster arms have too much trouble typing in all the necessary inputs to fix the problems. So instead they just keep running on their little wheels all day long using their tiny little headsets with squeak to text technology to respond to our emails. Bethesda is doing such awesome things with Fallout 76! They're teaching freaking hamsters English!! ^_^
---
There are a bunch of ways to boost your xp. I use berry mentats/mentats and canned meat stew and then i join an event team. Tag everyrhing you can in every horde type event. When there is no events availible then you hunt high lvl super mutants. West tek is The most reliable, there is a bunch more locations but dont know them by name. If you do this you will get your lvls in no time.
---
Only started playing a few weeks before update 20. but i felt it just got much worse after the update. for me.
---
Really? I'm not being a jerk, I'm being sincere here. 
---
It sounds as if they just want the extra damage, they don't seem to want to change play style since nothing about heavy weapons outside of the first shot is stealthy. 
---
You're the expert here but I'm looking to do a junkies build, I've even built up quite an arsenal. 
---
It seems as though there are nothing outside of junkie weapons needed for the build, even armor wise, all options seem available. The party boy/girl card prevents addictions and chemist prolongs chem effects whereas you need to be suffering withdrawal.
---
sounds like someone needs a hug...
---
it seems weird that some people are lucky enough not to encounter this at all and yet some are plagued by it....Bethesda bugs are profiling?
---
My apologies, apparently I wasn't close enough, despite being only a few feet underneath
---
I always try to join builder but nobody ever joins so I end up joining one of the existing event ones...
---
It's more like the difference between level 1 tech support and everyone else.  Level 1 reads a script, and if that doesn't work they forward you to people who know what they're doing (to different degrees).
---
I'll liken it to a situation I have with a database...if I have a problem, level 1 will read me the script, level 2 can log in and see my account and settings, and can make changes to everything I have access to, and level 3 can actually go into the database and make global changes.
---
People answering tickets are level 1.  You don't want to talk to level 1 for thing beyond passwords and error codes (for the most part).
---
With the new team thing he likely switched to another character and rejoined server.
---
Yuh, apparently the other comment was right and I wasn't close enough. Didn't know I had to be less than 10 feet away to do damage lmfao
---
You can use the Flatwoods Fletcher skin for the bow in NW so there's no reason we shouldn't be able to use the armor skins.
---
I share light footed to keep people alive at trap bases.  :-)
---
Alright cool. I got a bloodied mole miner gauntlet so I think I’ll stick with that.
---
They had an awesome grasp on this market in the genre .. but you can even see the lack of care from morrowind on .. they went from wanting to make something and to deliver it to other like minded people .. to jumping on a nickel and dime bandwagon where the quality doesn't matter just how many marketting ploys you got imbedded into the software
---
it's their own fault .. whether or not you're content and still play 76, which I do but won't be investing anymore anytime soon .. they did scare off a large amount of people with all these blunders and ruined some of their rep
---
Not rly gear doesnt rise after 50 and if u dont change your build or want any perks there is no need
---
Flordia Man is OP, Bethesda should nerf.....
---
Xbox I'm on, I've gone for the responder look, aiding new players and what not, mine is normally noticeable for secret passways hidden under rugs
---
same
---
I'm sure it's it's a glitch because my ss guass shotgun skin also doesnt work in nw and the camo one which has more benefits if anything does work. If they really didnt want it to be used in nw they woulda made it a bluprint like the Easter bunny hat.
---
Yeah i know, just since update 20 its been happening way more
---
I share Fire in the Hole because who doesn’t like a nice throwing arc?
---
Thank you for the quick answer :) genuinely helps put me at ease thinking I'm playing wrong
---
If there’s not a builder team available, I start my own. Usually no one joins, but  even +1 intelligence makes a little difference.
---
Why playing wrong?
---
The only thing I did was learn how locks work and how to pick basic locks
---
On a few of my dailies they have finished before i actually completed. Got mt score points, but just pointing out the bug.
---
It does move your score...
---
I appreciate that a lot actually. I love my grenades.
---
And a private session/lobby lol
---
I'll put this out here, if anybody wants to team up with builder on pc, add me ign Sallyuchi.
---
Weapons are either broken pieces of dog shit or broken because of how OP
---
they are.
---
Was the same player, didn't leave the server, I saw him level up in real time
---
I really appreciate it but I play on Xbox. I haven't played video games since GTA came out on PS2.   Now I'm showing my age 😆
---
Thanks, that was the cevat of the earleir mats posts, we didnt know if  it resetted or not.
---
Well we do now
---
I was hoping for eggs to make omelets to sell daily.  My cow already keeps my elbow deep in his .... *fertilizer* **and I don't need no more!**  I guess it was too much to hope a new production item for the camp.
---
Yes, I've heard that as well.
---
I wasn't trying to level up by 100 levels in the space of a few hours, I thought their might be a bonus to being a mu h higher level
---
☝️☝️☝️
---
Alternatively, if you have 8+ charisma, you can tell th former raider "come to foundation they're good hardworking people" and he says "yea okay that sounds like a good idea" and you get settler rep. I do this whenever I get a chance as raiser settler rep seems harder than raider rep.
---
And now you know how mole miners happened.
---
I try to sell things cheap in my store. All the plans I have found or got as quest reward and they are already known. I love seeing someone go on a buying frenzy while I'm out adventuring. Most expensive plan I think is my Raider PA jet pack at 200 and I think that's probably too expensive for a low level PA set.
---
xp trick you can use .. it's all over the internet and if it's on the internet it's true 
---
but previously yeah really no benefit for fast level gains after 60+ but now .. seasonal rewards have a repeatable the more you level the more SCORE you get the more rewards you receive
---
Spot on, I couldnt agree more. That's exactly what its come to
---
you don't get to "skip" ranks.  you get to skip the fecal maelstrom of the grind for a rank.  gods how i WISH you could just pick and choose and fully skip ranks.  those lunchboxes, scrap kits, fireworks, scrip, caps, and even the bullion (for me) can go crawl back into bethesda's crusty bowels.
---
only things i'd like are the glowing wallpapers, the gatling gun skin, the playground, the plushie, the tree, the firefly jar, and the planetarium lamp.  so yay 8 ranks that matter, 92 garbage ones.
---
&gt;This is a serious issue.
---
Compared to what?
---
That’s one thing about this game I like a lot. No matter your lvl, it’s always easier to be a better person than games like gta or Rust. I’m at a point where I’m over-encumbered unless I offer my plans for less than 25 caps😂
---
It depends, do u wanna go through it quick...or hang on to the first stimpack you ever found until  you get full price?
---
re: legendary junk, TELL ME ABOUT IT!
---
I'm an energy gun guy, whenever I can do it.
---
I try to be judicious about my use of energy stuff including fusion cores since they can be so hard to come by (and in the game, fusion cells and plasma cores can suddenly either appear in great numbers, or disappear for weeks/months), so I keep certain conventional ranged weaponry in stock as well and I don't use what I don't need to get the job done.
---
If I can get by with a conventional weapon, that's what I'll use - but some enemies just flat need a Tesla Rifle or a Gatling Plasma.
---
So anyway, I spent 100 credits at Rusty Pick and got a RAILWAY SPIKE GUN.
---
Of all things.
---
And it LOOKED as if a train had run over it too.
---
And you'd think I'd have learned, wouldn't you.
---
The last time I bought from Murmrgh, I got an antiquated 50 caliber ball rifle, complete with powder horn.
---
And I'm like, yeah - this is JUST what I need to fight a Wendigo (to cite to just ONE example) with....yeah - this'll work...
---
NOT.
---
I was SO DISGUSTED, I went back to the machine and turned it in and only got 40 BACK!
---
And THEN, I hadn't realized that Murgmgh had given me nearly 100 spikes (which are now more or less worthless since I tried to sell the gun to the machine) so THAT really ticked me off as well.
---
Damn.
---
That. 
---
Is. 
---
Awesome.
---
So basically you read the set-up where I describe the desires of both sides, but you didn't read the actual suggestion that is the rest of the post? That's so weird lol.
---
It's not a typical player market at all. Your response post was basically a waste of your time, and a waste of my time reading your comment. Ah well...
---
Just baffles me why he would jump 150 levels, it was using a camp glitch, seemed rediclously easy to do
---
hopefully the advanced guard for a Zetan incursion (as an event)!
---
It isn't possible to swap chars within staying in a public team. Even alt+f4  will kick you out.
---
Progress means i do dailys and score on main account only
---
Ah ok no lvl 50 but with legendary perks this might change since u unlock a slot every 50 lvl until 250 but for that u have time since the update was delayed
---
Just clocked that you said repeatable.. I think this was the answer I was looking for, thank you kind sir
---
Yea or he just states at you while he's sitting backwards in his chair.
---
I’m also “genuine” curious would it have been any better if they said it was a “testing season” instead of season 1?
---
You mean. I didn’t read the very long, very not interesting, idea where you then ask for people’s feedback and then get pissy when done one tied my like it? 
---
You didn’t want feedback. You wanted attention and praise. 
---
Sorry.
---
What is the max level one can be rn? I am 15 with some score in there. Did I loose some?
---
Lvl 900 here.
---
For the legendary run as one reason, completing the repeatable 10k exp challenge.
---
The other reason is to respec, having a different build or get perk cards.
---
Also, it looks better to be a lvl 300 then being 150.
---
Genuine answer: Wait for the problem to be fixed and complain if compensation isn't part of the fix (it usually is for loss of currency stuff).
---
There’s still some greedy sellers out there I’m afraid 😟
---
Events should always give score, problem solved.
---
Subway tile looks so good for the bathroom! Love the whole diner theme too
---
The 'state' the government, whatever you want to call it. Why are you so freaking obtuse?
---
If you edited the fallout76.ini, you have to set it on "read only" each time you launch the game or else it will reset.
---
I like the .50 I got 
---
Also I'm not that guy I was defending one of the diggers and he just pops up trying to take my kill
---
nah I am not interested in a handmade I already have one, just interested in getting the B2525 fixer at this point.
---
Sure. Just jump over when you are ready
---
Same here. Events only make up a small portion of what I do when playing. I'd rather the overall XP boost of builder.
---
Depending on how much you’re actually in a team, Herd Mentality might also be nice.
---
Nope we don’t unfortunately for you , you were the Minority side of the playerbase . I think it better to earn the cosmetic with the season then it is to do non-fun activity for atoms
---
Are people having this issue? I'm pretty confused as to what's happening. I've been getting SCORE just fine, hell, I'm already at the 1 week mark.
---
I don’t think I’d start over, nor would I try to power level.
---
Builds don’t have to be perfect to be successful. As you level, just respec as appropriate.
---
What I would recommend however, is gaining some real clarity on what you want your final build to look like, so you don’t waste more points.
---
There’s lots of advice here, mostly good. Maybe post your current and proposed builds, and seek suggestions.
---
Love finding them too. But HATE seeing people gouge pricing
---
Isn't it just a 2% increase?
---
World full.  Jumping back to friends server for 3rd SBQ run and then will try again.
---
Ok ill try to trade the handmade for a b2525 fixer.
---
Right. And if I’m not mistaken you only get the xp boost from completion of the event. Not from kills during the event. For the event teams that is.
---
Yeah but every little bit helps when you’re grinding xp for this season pass thing.
---
yeah, she actually cleans up really well.  have mine in a red sequin dress, nice set of brainy specs, and the devil horns.
---
i feel bethesda missed two boats with her lol.  shame she wasn't a proper companion in fallout 4, and they shoulda had her story end really off the wall like with her being a synth or something and part of an even more shady government program.
---
Thank you for this amazing work!
---
True, I should make exp food... Why am I so lazy 😭
---
Love that too!  And serums.  Found a camp with loads of serums for 200 caps ea!
---
They are all meh to any high level player, even worse that you can only share lvl 1 of some of those perks.
---
Cranberry everything!
---
You admitted you didn't even read the suggestion. You said you read the first 2.5 paragraphs, that means you had no idea what the suggestion was. And if you had read it and actually understood it, you wouldn't have written an irrelevant reply complaining that it will cause things that it will *not cause because it's not even that kind of auction house in the first place*.
---
You are trying really hard to cover the basic fact that you replied with useless drek after not having read the actual suggestion. You can call my suggestion uninteresting now to cover that up, but be real with yourself and what you did. You ignored my suggestion and then wrote 'feedback' on what you thought it was, rather than what it actually was. 
---
I don't mind if people think the idea sucks, but this kind of response is just self-indulgent and lazy, and to see you dance around that is silly...
---
never used him in any of the recent fallout games, so dunno.
---
okay let me know ill be on for the next few hours.
---
see the overall problem with this is the same I'm dealing with in other pvp games .. you get plebs and pve people joining pvp just for the rewards or to finish completions and it pisses off the people that actually enjoy pvp, they want pvp like minded people
---
then begins the whole road of the pvers start moaning and groaning about mechanics and how pvp is unbalanced cause of this or that further ruined the pvpers experience until the game mode eventually crumbles
---
they need to really seperate these game modes .. only pvp related things in pvp and vise versa or similar it sucks to see update after update with BS changes and knowing the pvers complaints are behind it
---
you should be able to advance through the season through adventure mode and through nuclear winter not combined or requiring both
---
People keep coming up with good ideas like these. However, it all comes down to money. This is a money making scheme. Bethesda knows that there are two types of players. Those with disposable time and those with disposable money. They also know that usually those with disposable money have jobs/families/etc and usually don't have alot of disposable time. So, this is a strategy used to get those with disposable money in order to buy atoms to level up quickly. So they will not put in additional ways of leveling up without players paying money.
---
As far as the people with disposable time, money of them do not also have disposable money. However, by having them log in every day, it makes fallout 76 look like it is doing well to stockholders. It makes it look like the game is very active with a dedicated playerbase.
---
So, either way, it looks good for bethesda to implement this strategy.
---
But I clearly did because I summarized it and noted how you ended it. 
---
So you lose.
---
There have been a few times where I get half way through a 25 round handmade mag at 95% vats chance before the bullets start to hit their target.
---
Thank you! I tried my best to work with what I had. I'm currently working on stocking my Nuka Cola machine with Nukashine. And I have stimpaks for sale outfront as well.
---
I really expected her to be a robot. Maybe she'd murdered the crew or survived because she didn't need oxygen. Oh well!
---
It's happened to me a few times now.  Eg killed X number of robots....zero reward.  Stuff like that.  Shows as completed, but no points awarded.
---
Strange in Numbers would be the only one I already have in my build, so that's usually the one I share
---
Nope I am death.
---
So is the server instability.
---
I feel lucky enough to never have encountered one
---
Run builder all the time. Switch the team to Event, just at the end of events, then back to builder. You don't lose the bonded bonus. You switch team by clicking on your own name(team leader) in team menu. Maximum XP!!
---
Yup I'm aware of running silos, mainly just dialogue I'll miss hehe.
---
If you plan on buying them, which I wouldn’t, wait until the end. Each rank gets progressively harder to earn (more score), but costs the same number of atoms.
---
If on pc, there is a map mod where everything is marked with a legend on the top left corner. Then you'll have all Infos like vendors, workbenches, gold press machines, fractions, random encounter and so on.
---
Getting replies for posts that already have replies?  Bethesda has already acknowledged the issue, nagging them even more about it accomplishes shit.
---
I thought that was just me having issues like that. I'd say about 2/3 of the score quests have autocompleted on me without giving credit. At least Bethesda is consistent?
---
awesome .. however
---
you need an outside patio with a fence and some punji boards for those w/o masks
---
we're all social distancing due to the scorched plague
---
Job well done sir! It looks and sounds amazing!
---
Surprisingly the server stayed stable the entire time, I was more shocked with that than the collosus itself
---
Oh, so much. Nothing compared to what we missed out on.
---
I asked about that days ago. I got plus  10 percent instead of 5 or sleeping cause of her . But then switched allie an Lost it. Is this what ur talking about? It was called something enlightenment I think.
---
Ah! True, with that new strain kicking around the vaccine isn't as effective. I'll make sure to allocate that and a deathclaw bouncer into the budget!
---
You didn’t miss out on anything.
---
Honestly I like your second idea better.
---
The problem with challenges/rewards is it doesn't get people to actually *play* the game mode.  It just gets people to log into the game mode and sit in bushes the whole time.  I don't think this is the gameplay experience Bethesda intended (although it is someone inevitable in a BR) and getting people who have no interest in playing to play isn't helping.
---
Red Dead does the same thing where they give challenges to encourage PvP but all it does is ruin it for the people who actually enjoy it because half the lobby is just trying to do their objectives and get out.
---
They need to make the mode better, not bribe people into playing it in a half-assed manner.
---
"I got through the first 2.5 paragraphs"
---
You are frighteningly comfortable with denying a reality you've already admitted to in writing, but which was already obvious when I read your first reply. :/
---
The basic principle stands: You're not offering feedback if you haven't even read the idea you're commenting on. It's fundamentally disrespectful to ignore someone and then chatter back at them as you did.
---
I suspect you're either having a bad day or you've got some mental issues that need address. I'll leave you to it.
---
It qss a lot of fun, but I burned about 2k 5mm and 2k ultracite .50 so I wouldn't recommend doing it frequently
---
there's a show about you people and it mostly ends in tragedy
---
but you bring up a good point we need more races in this game, i wanna be a centaur!
---
You can select individual perks can’t you?
---
Hey, hey you... pssst...
---
Fallout 1st gives a unlimited scrap storage, so hoarders like me can breath.
---
What is the purpose of the “spin” function?
---
Damn I don't even have 2k 5mm lmao
---
And don't even get me started on the ultracite .50
---
Excellent question, my teammates and I were talking about this last night.
---
If you don’t eat your meat, you won’t get any pudding.
---
That's the spirit!
---
Did he complain being here?
---
Do you feel forced to answer like a total douchebag?
---
Why do I really care?
---
I'd be interested in helping. I am currently grinding the rare plans and end up with some spares that I'd be happy to donate to the cause. PSN Ludvillain
---
I have 72600 lbs in my scrap box...
---
the only way that happens is if the level up that your applying is before the level requirement of the card .. this for adventure or NW? or you already have all the available options rank 1-3 etc
---
noap sir
---
Yep. Even one month lets you store it all. Of course then you'll fill your stash with weapons armor and clothing and collections...
---
Yeah.. but I don't have those cards ?!?
---
So we get to keep them?
---
not really related but where do i find a random holotape? lol havnt been looking all that much but cant remeber anyplace to go to
---
GIVE US YOUR REAL MONEY.
---
I'm on XB1 and I had no issue today. Logged in at 1030am est completed yesterday's challenges, and then at 12 est started and then completed today's challenges. Although I did server Hop a couple times, looking for events and stuff, I was able to do them all no problem.
---
Well i think its way easier the health pool is like a quarter of the SBQ and it can't fly. The shout and the wendigos r a bit annoying but the Colossus takes like 2 min til its dead and without magic weapons
---
if you switch between the bethesda launcher and steam, it will not carry atoms over. its stupid AF but i guess thats just how it works
---
They're in Strength right ?
---
It won’t let you disassemble the camp? There should be an option to put all the parts back into the stored, that’s what I had to do when I couldn’t place my camp anywhere
---
Very fun mini boss. I'd love it if more enemies had unique attacks like the fear one he has. And if you want a challenge, try fighting one with melee. ;)
---
I always offer plans, recipes, and  Bobbleheads for free in my vendor. I don’t seem to have much of a problem with high levels coming and taking everything. 
---
I do have 30+ Mounted Cat Heads for 69 a piece in my vendor because my CAMP is crazy cat lady themed.
---
Where does it tell you the weight?
---
Please people what is this i only noticed it yesterday
---
It pops sometimes when you sell to a vendor.
---
Somehow my mom can remember everything is and what it's close to, I on the other hand need to use this  [site](https://fo76map.com/) if I ever need something specific (like a tinker's bench and I don't want to travel to my 🏠)
---
Have to friend them
---
&gt;I feel like it's practically impossible to get anything expensive in the atom shop without spending cash to buy points. 
---
Free atoms weren't supposed to be all people spent in the shop.  They were supposed to let you buy small things or things on sale or help supplement purchased atoms for large ticket items.
---
The entire fucking point of the atom shop was that people would spend MONEY on cosmetics but Bethesda was too generous with how many free atoms you could build up over time.
---
Max level is 100, as after dailys are done you can just farm xp (with buffs) to get further. 
---
If you've done all the dailies and weeklies 15 is about right..
---
I’ll have to keep an eye out for that
---
My god you can’t handle criticism. 
---
I’ll make it simple. Your idea is stupid. And your to immature to handle criticism.
---
For those of us that don't play NW this was helpful
---
Your definetly not wrong, it always screwed with me that in a mode where your meant to fight to the death, being a pacifist bushwookie was the next best tactic to having a full competent team of buddies to play with.
---
The second idea was partially inspired by CoD Warzone. Im not a big fan of Battle royale mode, but I love me some Plunder. The contracts and respawns makes the difference between playing a match or not playing at all for me.
---
I don't know if you're actually mentally deficient but I'll repeat it anyways: There is no state
---
If they want more people playing Nuclear Winter, they need to add more modes. Right now it's a huge time commitment and gets old fast. They need some smaller maps with things like capture the flag, team deathmatch and others.
---
Thank you. I did the others in NW (I'm not really averse to it, though I only started palying it at all for these challenges) but was gonna sit out todays. 
---
I'm glad i didn't as it was seriiusly the easiet one after oyur explanation, and I ended up getting top 8 to boot without even meaning to after the CAMP placement, just figured I'd see how it went :D
---
Since the patch, I have seen VATS not work on many different targets.  I find that most of the time if I exit VATS, it works when I get back into it.
---
I was just searching for this answer. I got the beanie earlier and like 4 or 5 matches later glowing skel costume unlocked. 
---
Anyone know how much longer abouts for the winter coat outfit? I bought em both way back so I own a set already but if it isn't much more of a grind to unlock I'd rather.
---
Its fucking hard to break the fallout 4 habit of "fucking loot everything"
---
It was decrypted when it what is the public test server and so have the other 3
---
Dam, you nailed it! They did that shit on purpose!
---
I play XBox too, will look for It. Congrats!
---
Adventure . And I'm maxed ranked on all strength. ( I understand this is where incisor drops). I truly don't get it. I got happy with my build tonks ago and reached max level. Pointswise. Now I just get the same crap cards that I already have 😞
---
Everyone who isn't a fool should. Bethesda screwed over every player by taking away the free atoms to try and force players to buy them instead.
---
Shh. None of us would do something so absurd.
---
I can hit out for 14k damage. One shot a Scorchbeast with absolutely zero problem whatsoever. My build isn’t even complete yet. Yet when I do 14k damage to a Scorched, he gets staggered, his health bar goes down to zero. But BAM! All of a sudden he’s got full health again!
---
Yes to keep everything but the world,tent
---
That’s what I’m thinking
---
if you're on pc you can edit the ini to modify vats .. I've yet to run into the miss and re-enter thing
---
these are outdated but all of the vats DEFAULT values at the time .. adjust spring value etc to your liking

Spend a point and pick a new perk card.
---
I complete my challenges around 4 in the morning
---
This needs to happen. If we had persists t workshops in private worlds that didn’t need to be constantly defended, I wouldn’t even care about the budget restrictions.
---
Btw..thanks for you reply. X
---
Thank you much
---
Yeah that sucks a lot when this happens
---
By the way what's your build?
---
After I complete my challenges then I just go on nuclear winter and go nuts
---
I’m not even on PC. I hardly know what Steam is.
---
Strange is Numbers is a fantastic card. I am just shy of level 290.
---
Lol, I'm sure I would. Luckily I was on the new character Atom grind basically from launch until patch 7 or whenever they replaced the atom rewards. Between that and FO1st I've been able to buy basically everything I've wanted on the atom shop.
---
I'm all in on them adding persistent workshops and I'd be pissed if I wasn't able to get all the CAMP items.
---
I used to be able to one-shot kill anything using VATS with my shotgun, but since the update it’s taking 2 to 3 shots just to land any hits now.
---
Please do this so you don't disrupt those actually partying.
---
I’ve already bought it lmao I had enough atoms saved up to get to the third level
---
I started hoarding gold bars.
---
haha it is, I concur .. I wear a surgical mask now, so I can use this word cause I'm educated
---
I wish the npc vendors in the game wouldn’t over price the plans so much like its bullcrap I rather run around the map and go buy plans and things I need from players who will reasonably price things
---
To deincentivize griefing at the end of scorched earth, Bethesda made it so the reward flux you get does not drop in your bag, it just disappears. 
---
So It's not malice or greed from other players, it just vanishes if you die, which is enheartening to know.
---
2H Bloodied melee. I’m gonna be the guy who they rely on to do the damage, then they’re gonna whinge and bitch about me here on Reddit because I do too much damage to normal mobs. When I get nerfed and Queen fights go South for them all of a sudden, I’ll be sitting here with a big fat “I told you so” with a huge grin on my face.
---
I have over 5k atoms since launch from dailies and long term quests and have gotten many things from the shop with no cash. I wait until they go on sale and most of it isn't great to only put in a near max limit camp. Yes this is their plan, to shrink the supply and up the demand
---
This is true, you need to inflict 1k in damage to loot and get rewards. However, there have been instances since before the last update where I known I met these and didn't receive rewards or able to loot SBQ. I usually find a new instance if this happens.
---
Can I ask why do you need them?
---
No worries - its been a journey - mine's just coming to an end.  The new content was either going to extend the game for many or mark the end for many players - the boring grind will likely mark the end for many.
---
A grind is one thing - that Bethesda has limits/caps on stuff, time gating, a gajillion different currencies, etc makes it so much worse.  They don't account that not everyone plays the same, like all these character locked gear.  You can't even sell or trade those new grenades and I don't use them...  but they started giving them out in events now too.  Was trying to save up for a full set of T-65 power armor plans and I ran into the 5000 gold cap on the character and lost some gold I bought from Smiley.
---
They need to stop punishing the players if they want to retain players - but Todd seems to believe that a grind will be good for the game.  Not this sort of grind Todd!
---
Nope. I would never do something as absurd as have a collection of nearly every single junkies weapon in the game...
---
Don’t buy it then.
---
I will add you now :)
---
I don’t think they’ve labeled it yet
---
I usally do 10-25 caps depending one thhe original asking price.
---
[If you think that's annoying try hitting a moving enemy, that isnt targeting, you with melee.](https://youtu.be/mR1WyfiB2Bc?t=18)
---
I will
---
Yeah, it would be nice to interact with them a bit more. Even if it was just some sort of recon mission.
---
It's me too, over 5k and have skins, camp items, stuff I don't even use. Have you completed all kill robot challenges? I've done 3 and there are more still
---
Since it's combat rifle, can it be applied to the fixer?
---
Earlier today, I traded in a 3* pipe pistol.... To get a 3* pipe pistol 🤦
---
Also don't snap 2 defence platforms with the stairs on them, it will not let you delete them
---
Oh that sucks
---
I sell all plans at 10% the price they are listed at.
---
Pretty sure my post wasn't a tutorial lol
---
What's is the event that you earn these rewards kinda new to fallout so I dont really know
---
I honestly don't know. I hope so
---
no worries, maybe it's a bug with your current strength .. you got any diseases, mutations messing with strength .. which isn't supposed to affect this but .. bethesda
---
incisor opens at 34 .. but check to see if any cards after level 34 are available for choosing like bear arms (I think) and master slugger .. if a card after level 34 is available I'd send in a ticket
---
DMV! FOR THE WIN. Since update lots of legendary spawns. Make sure you use the terminal twice in the waiting area to start the first two waves, then clear all three floors. Fast, easy, and I constantly carry fresh spawns thru to get them easy lvls.
---
I usually do a few circuits around future prime, the SB’s spawn every 10 minutes, so if you add in the farm, army camps and sundew you’ll have your hands full
---
Hey, I just wanted to let you I know that I'm still working on this! With all the new content added lately, I've put in like 20 hours this week. I finally have my 3 rifleman perks maxed out, and I have one bloody mess. It's amazing what a difference it makes. I'm now one shotting level 60 ghouls, raiders, and scorched.
---
I wouldn't care for people doing too much dmg I mean I just need to hit the queen once and I'm good this way I spend less ammo , the only thing I complain is that if they killed a legendary before anybody else could get a hit, wich you don't need to deal 14k dmg to kill a legendary before anyone else can get a hit.
---
Same here, I was quick to scream theres a bug, well there is one, but its getting the atoms early (or when a teamate complete a quest?)
---
But you cant really buy your way with NW, you just gotta put in the time.
---
I understand if your comment was more directed at SCORE, they definetly are working the time poor / reasource rich and time rich / reasource poor angle there.
---
Im more interested in allowing us to work on time limited challenges, more at our own pace. And maybe people will buy cosmetics to stand out from the pack, similiar to how fortnite made its mint.
---
How about instead of suggesting to nerf one of the most popular play styles, suggest buffs to alternatives. Imagine if mutants stacked up to 5 like junkies does. Or if nocturnal gave double all night.
---
You shouldn’t be advocating to ruin the experience of other players just because you think your play style is too weak.
---
I usually do, we were playing around with the public teams before realising that we could do the same thing on private lol
---
But Bethesda 😂😂 thankyou zfirex
---
I like sharing Mysterious Stranger, mostly just to surprise people when he shows up.
---
Yeah it’s definitely a little disturbing to put it mildly
---
Great idea
---
The problem is it’s either 14k damage from my pole hook or it’s 300 damage per round from my BFFR lmg. And it’ll fire at least three rounds because of its insane fire rate.
---
These are the missing plans for the PS4 side in case anyone is curious:
---
-Double-Barrel Scorched Killer's Receiver
---
-Lever Gun Scorched Killer's Receiver
---
-Protective Lining Raider Underarmor
---
-Healing Salve (mire) recipe
---
I wish this was a thing on pc, raider fight club! Meet at the top of the world! Anyway, good luck mr durden.
---
Give a few seconds for the others than just utter demolish the queen
---
I'd like more enemies with fear, Flatwoods has charm /control that could work on you.
---
Also a perk card to counter.
---
Maybe 3 card levels with 3 points being immunity.
---
i feel that. i think a lot has to do with builds. for instance, i use full unyielding which buffs my strength. but at full health  im like 60 lbs over encumbered. so when i die the game is registering my base carry weight and not what it would be with my low health, or the slightly above that it would be if i were to respawn properly.
---
You don't have to hang out with them. Plus, some extra fast travel spots are handy! 😉
---
Yes. I am a VATS pistol build and suddenly I have a massive inferiority complex. Now I just go to events and hide behind the dudes with heavy guns.
---
Neither...it is it’s own category at the moment.
---
haha yup, they hate good stealth and vats builds.
---
the sunken church area I ran into a couple level 90s
---
the antique store and the ranger station NW of watoga I've found a few level 70s
---
and along the road NW of valley galleria I found a couple level 70-80s
---
All the fissure sites on the east side of the map. Usually good for ~a dozen Scorched each, plus a SB. Throw in WestTek and by the time you’re done you can run it all again.
---
They are on my friends list but it still says you don't have permissions.
---
sad to say it will never get fixed probably... I still have issues with smiley resetting properly so I had to earn all my bullion through dailies and events... to get the full power armor took almost 2 months... so this issue with the score will likely go unfixed as well
---
It was from a lunch box buff
---
Rethink the title bro
---
I'm pretty sure you're mentally deficient and purposefully obtuse. Have a good day.
---
I'm already halfway through the season
---
Best... Comment... Ever... 😂
---
The one player that’s charge every plan for 500 caps, when you can go to another player and buy it for 10 or 15 caps, but they are just assholes and think it’s worth 500 when he probably got them for free during a workshop defense event.
---
if it's public team you can't.
---
both leave public and invite them the old way.
---
Why?
---
Thanks, that explains it
---
You Absolute God. It's Sorted. Eye fang queue sew much.xx
---
I think it has something to do with your current emote set .. not entirely sure but this should provoke someone who knows into answering
---
Both third and first person didn't work, hard restarting my Xbox seemed to fix it though.
---
SS means more than that
---
I don't have it, but can it be placed ontop of foundations like the tent?
---
They could also add a weekly SCORE repeatable for Overseer XP. That’s harder to get, so it would need to reflect that, but it would be an incentive for people to try something new or at least bounce back and forth.
---
Thanks mate, never thought of that.
---
I know that, but what else does it stand for
---
I did have this happen with both weeklies and dailies, the ones this happened with I did the math for and came up with the correct number of score points for my total at least.
---
Yea that would be cool if we could just place junk, weapons, armor and meds just around of camp
---
I love helping out low level characters. Even if it's a high level character with an alt character.
---
Anyways a few times when I fast traveled to a new player straight out of the vault. I did the 🎁 emoji &amp; for some reason they began to attack me with their fists. Not sure if they thought I was an NPC, a player troll or an NPC troll, but it was pretty hilarious when they saw my tombstone and saw the plans and stuff I dropped.
---
Bethesda support says they are aware of the 3/5 problem and are working on a fix for the next update.
---
Lol I just stole like 200 45 from someone
---
Wow
---
Shutzstaffel
---
200? Try 2,000
---
What is the difference when you compare a regular level 45 minigun damage and the bloodied damage?  If bloodied is better, use it until a better option comes along.
---
Tbh, none of my characters run more than 5 charisma, limiting me to one star cards. The only one I could potentially share is strange in numbers. Most of the friends I play with are in the same boat. Travel agent would be another card but with my vendors up I’m normally looking for any excuse to burn as many caps as possible. Also, there’s no way for us to communicate which cards people need in public teams.
---
I didn't know that, will have to try there (currently a bit short on my kill-10-legendaries weekly so would be good to get it finished). Thanks.
---
Fr I have a camp dedicated to helping low level players and recently level 100 and up will come and by everyone thing and then to their camp and sell it for more, so I’m going to put a sign up with the letters, that say if your a low level message me for cheap chems or water or anything else they need.
---
no god mode???? I'm out
---
Because it's easier to nerf one playstyle, rather than buff how many others? Plus, Two Shot, and Explosive were nerfed all to hell, so I figured that nerfing rather than buffing was more up Bethesda's alley.👍
---
you actually get more exp in nw by not doing anything just being really good at hiding. i think they need to relabel it something hide and seek. or actually give decent exp for taking out other players
---
Oh
---
*laughs in power armor clipping glitch*
---
I’m not actively trying to level up. I just enjoy doing quests and the stuff I usually do and am at level 10. Seems like it’s just pretty challenging, but the indication it’s impossible doesn’t add up.
---
They make soup which gives an xp bonus.
---
You can see what is being shared and move cards around. Or message them. 😂
---
Well as the BOS was not actually aware of the Enclave until  2241 I'd like them to fix this by having the traitors in the whitespring bunker called something else and maybe put in a story on how the Early BOS dealt with them when they were encountered.
---
We know from the recordings in the bunker that the traitors had encountered BOS and that they were clashing but the BOS have no record of encountering an organization called the Enclave until 2241 (Fallout 2).
---
Aww, that's so nice!
---
Sadly, no :(
---
It's dull gray, or grey depending on what part of the world you're form.
---
Yeah.....🙁
---
Vault 76 was a control vault. It’s sole purpose was to actually keep people safe. Considering that Vault-Tec had a contract with the United States government, I’m sure they had something in their documents restricting that part of West Virginia from even being considered for a potential nuclear target. Of course, I’m trying to look at this from an in-world point of view.
---
I’ve only lost 1000 so far luckily but I can see it being a real problem for those trying to grind to 100
---
The Queen isn’t the problem, there’s plenty to go around when it comes to the Queen.
---
Omg I’m dead😂
---
Bruh you have no god damn idea what you’re talking about, I recently converted to bloodied and it’s way more fun than any of my previous playstyles, my damage resistance is so high I barely take damage from anything, I can even take a few hits from Yao guai spam. 
---
One of my characters is a full health berserkers build character that puts out an insane amount of damage, but unlike bloodied I have to hide constantly because everything one hits him.
---
Forward station delta in the trailer next to the power armor station. A little late but that's where I got mine.
---
It is from an event that has yet to be added
---
Do you know when it may be coming out?
---
I’ll keep a look out for them. As well as reaching out to my team/plan vendors
---
Yeah, this needs more exposure. Everyone keeps creating and joining 'event' teams, but I don't think they realize that outside of events there's no benefit. Builder is better.
---
[Map76](https://map76.com/) is totally searchable.  I can't remember anything either, so I always have this open on my laptop.
---
I mostly try to get on a builder team. However with more people doing public events, there have been events where I'm barely getting any kills because everyone else is gunning everything down so fast. So, when that's happening (it'll probably happen more when there's a complete X events daily) you might be better off in an events team, as most of the XP you'll be getting will be the event-end rewards rather than kills.
---
There is a useful XP route in this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hkazxw/seasons_finally_gave_me_something_to_do_in_game/)
---
The one time I killed it I took 0 dmg and so did my teammates
---
Maybe they updated it with the June 30th update then
---
Agreed, the Ghillie variants of the armor that are in NW were the things I was the most excited to grind for. And the fact that they couldn’t be applied was a huge blow
---
Haven’t found anything definitive yet.
---
Might want to be careful with that one - IIRC, the beam splitter Increases damage, but also makes a big reduction in accuracy,
---
Glad I’m not the only one.  Who aims in this game.  Vats is killing me lately
---
Could have been worse
---
in the game . nothing. out side the game it can be a bad thing, but no worries we are talking about inside the game so SS
---
Yeah, prior to today I was just thinking this isn't so bad since there's quite a bit of free stuff. But then I realized I don't really want that stuff and the one thing I do want in the atom shop is just out of reach with the new system. So instead of buying atoms like they probably banked on, I just won't get the item.
---
I'd be happy to be able to decorate my camp with the stuff I paid actual money for.
---
So tired of my camp budgrt always being maxed out.
---
Also... can we make it so that the board on the farmable floor/foundation tiles doesn't block placement of plants?
---
Or just make plant placement just a bit more forgiving about letting them clip into stuff?
---
I’m kinda torn. The new update has me playing again and I like a lot of the rewards but the lack of atoms that seems to be a thing now is disappointing. Maybe it’ll change in later seasons
---
Working as intended, It Just Works,
---
I’m gonna trade for another one if I can, for hoard events, I have one already that’s focused
---
All i can think of is that IT Crowd line "Have you tried turning your computer off, and back on again?".  Please update us on how your situation gets corrected.
---
I got a lever action. Also there’s usually someone with a glitched weapon shredding her before I can get close to my 1000 damage.
---
I’ve been robbed of 2000 so far.. I’ve just quit trying at this point
---
Stop playing this fucking dumpster fire of a game
---
The official acronym is USSS, we avoid SS for reasons
---
Join teams, get to 3 charisma and pick up inspirational so you have 15% xp boost, and share a one point card. Just about anything people will appreciate.
---
The. Take and defend workshops.  Xp will roll in.
---
Hitler's paramilitary organization
---
I serve to avoid pacified sheepsquatch on the highway now.
---
I am going to use that as soon as I get on, thanks!
---
I thought to myself that leveling charisma is useless for now since I am only playing by myself but will defo do that!
---
^
---
Great XP route on this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hkazxw/seasons_finally_gave_me_something_to_do_in_game/)
---
K.  I was Also intrigued by the potential for increased damage, but when I saw the accuracy hit, decided to leave it alone.  Awareness is/can be a terrible thing :)
---
Do you really? Does Inspirational work like that too?
---
What about a Berserker exploding black powder rifle? Or is it just the dragon?
---
Its confirmed that they are gonna change it. Was tweeted by ine of the devs. Hope they can make it better next time.
---
Don't go into the blast zone without wearing protection.
---
Horde events in the forest and toxic valley (green and grey areas at top left of the map) will be a good source of legendary items for you, and so is the event Leader Of The Pack, but they're only 1*
---
If you go to your junk tab there will be an option for Component View, from there you can mark the resources you're looking for and if you find an item that contains them it will have a magnifying glass next to it
---
I'm kind of drawing a blank but if you come across anything you'd like to ask about feel free :) I'm around fairly often
---
Im sorry you had to waste your bullets on an easy kill, while I hid in my bush.
---
If I need a pvp fix, Fallout is the last title I would spin up. Can you even consider Fallout a legit PVP game, when gun and movement skills arent really important and luck and hide and seek ability is what generally wins the battle?
---
I also like that myself as non PVRr in Fallout complained not one bit during my post about PvP, but you sure felt the need to rag on PvErs, whats up dude? All I want is another reason to come be target practice for ya.
---
You play in your mode, ill play in mine, til you got rewards I want. Than feel free to come bush whack me.
---
I noticed today that when you first initiate the sequence that calls her to the Hornwright safe room, it says "MOTHERLODE01 connected." The Motherlode you repair in the initial quest explicitly identifies itself as "Motherlode 03". So at least three of them were apparently built, and at least two are still functioning as of the start of 2103.
---
Nerfing two shot was a mistake. Two shot weapons were strong, but not much stronger than a proper berserkers or junkies build. The problem was the explosive effect which by the time they finally nerfed that two shot was already in a terrible state from multiple nerfs. The damage reduction, accuracy penalty, and weapon condition penalty is just way too fucking much. nerfing a play style to be unusable is never a good option.
---
Jermz_xx90
---
Thank you very much!! I forgot that the "pinning compoments" thing existed! I'll come back to you if I come across anything :)
---
I've just switched from bloodied to junkies. Got the big so often as bloodied, haven't had it once since junkies (about 2 weeks)
---
Could have the vending machines break when they can num no longer accept caps.
---
I’m the same but the public teams is great. You get the bonus and never really interact with people. Plus when they do their quests you get caps for some reason.
---
I’ll upvote that. That’s a fair argument.
---
Most of my plans are at 10 caps and recipes at 5 caps I do tend to leave some on the ground if I have too many and whoever gets there first can have it
---
Are you on Xbox? If so, I always have stacks of plans that I give away to low level players.  👍
---
very true, one dude a fought even got in his power armor to avoid the rads. emergency protocol also lets you avoid the slow movement of power armor.
---
150 atoms is, I believe, the amount it will cost to automatically advance your token 1 space in the legendary run (once the initial 2 week waiting period is over).
---
So while, yes, in the long run it would be much better for them yo fix this bug (and they may given a little time), in the short term the 150 atoms can be far more valuable that one or two thousand points, IF used to advance your token in the legendary run.
---
Yeah! I thought I was the only one. My Gauss Rifle used to be able to nail a Scorched like 200 yards out with 50% hit chance in Vats, now I can hardly hit a tick two feet in front of me. Its ridiculous
---
Well, If you subscribe to Fallout 1st you can go to a private world and start a new team with nobody on it and viola, you'll get the XP/whatever perks plus you'll meet your group challenges quota. Creating a "me, myself, and I" team still breaks Lone Wanderer so I recommend switching it out temporarily to something like Inspirational that _should_ give you a wee XP boost.
---
 I found the players and they had legacy weapon hense me taking to much damage so they kind of have nerfed those weapons
---
Idk if its exactly this issue, but last night I was “completing” challenges early, getting paid for them, and when I actually completed it, i didnt get the S.C.O.R.E. Doesnt seem to be the same from what you all have experienced. But I thought it was odd all the same!
---
Send me a friend request I’ll be starting it up on a private in a few
---
Was in NW earlier just getting the challenge for CAMP placing. Decided to play it out to see where it went. I ended up top 10 and on the edge of the circle in a shrub just chillin out. 
---
the circle closed and there was literally the smallest gap to the fire behind me as it did, I turned around to look at it and my crosshair went red. Some guy in a ghille was sat literally on top of me in the same bush, yet didn't see me even though I was in wood armour and he was ghillied up. 
---
Shot him in the head and just sat there bemused for a minute.
---
Compared to the other egregious crimes bethesda committed, like not putting enough emotes in the atom shop
---
Thank you so much! :)
---
Weight management is huge problem in the game, my recommendation would to get the perks pack rat and traveling pharmacy. Another good perk to have is farma pharma, you’ll find a ton of medical supplies. Another thing that isn’t apparent is that you can get a backpack, complete the quest “the order of the tadpole”.
---
I understand that literally anything qualifies as a PSA nowadays, but come on, this is literally the only feature aside from seasons that came with this update, and it's blasted in your face every few minutes with constant team notifications in case you happen to forget
---
Yet another needed function that was left out. The ability to mark MORE than ONE interesting location on your map. Like, how the hell am I supposed to remember that really neat place without dropping a marker. Ok, no worries, I’ll drop a marker here to remember, oops, already have a dropped marker. Never mind then. FML
---
All plans at my camp I set to 50 caps and weapons are 300 keep it easy
---
Stop playing and wait until bethesda pulls their heads out of their ass
---
I lasted 1 vs 2 last night and got down to the 2nd to last circle just camping in a bush with 1 gun and some aid. Got 3rd place and 644xp lol. Just slowly moving from shrub to shrub at the edge of the circle.
---
This is day two of the same issue. 
---
Crazy stuff. 😂
---
Eventually the main quest will bring you to a girl named Rose. She gets you into some pretty crazy things super early on and I would consider leveling a bit before you talk to her. Taking over workshops is a good way to get XP, camp plans, and stims to help you out.
---
Stupid Consumer, Open Rectum Entrance
---
I feel the same way.  I've been watching closely there are way too many times there are no events on the maps.
---
yessir
---
They’d rather do it the lazy way and give you atoms if you submit a ticket to them
---
The Halloween NW rewards are available now, as well as Survivor and Xmas.
---
Make sure you have a vague sense of what kind of build you wanna do. You can swap special points after level 50, buts it’s tedious and you don’t wanna be forced to swap more than a few.
---
I plan on doing NW challenges like this one, the rest I just can't bother.. I hate that damn mode, just hope that I can actually complete the 100 race without NW.
---
Just wondering, how does Herbivore affect Cranberry Relish?
---
The Ash Heap and The Cranberry Bog are still bugged even after finding 5 places :(
---
Nope, it’s still bugged. Says talk to zeke, I do, and then nothing happens. It still says talk to zeke. What I did was create an alt character just for the mr fuzzy tokens and I transfer them to my main.
---
They seem to take their time about it though...
---
I contemplated attacking my bush buddy, but I think I'm going to be pacifist in this game mode as much as possible to prove a point (mostly to myself).
---
We got a troll over here! Get’up on outta here!
---
Takes a few days for them to verify stuff and send your atoms. After a day or two passes and you still don’t get it, file a support ticket and they can just drop them into your account for you.
---
The game will crash and freeze more than you're used to. This is "normal".
---
There are basic things missing, like power armor displays. 
---
Caps will come, be patient. All vendors have a 1400 cap daily reserve. Once you get to a decent level you can sell enough to meet it easily. 
---
Stim packs and Radaway will become a lot more common at higher levels, tough it out. 
---
Build your first base near the wayward. The milk from the brahmin is very useful at early level. 
---
Dont invest much in pipeguns, you'll out level them quickly. 
---
Melee and unarmed (fist weapons) are viable and powerful, and very useful for farming mobs. 
---
Research the perks, some that sound useful or cool are not really worth the investment. 
---
The zones are broken up by general level. If the terrain changes, check out an enemies level before you engage. 
---
The only penalty for dying is you drop all your "junk" items where you died in a brown paper bag. You or anyone else can pick them up after that. 
---
Dont worry about legendary items until level fifty. Items cap out at level 45 or 50, and you'll want the maximum level of items. 
---
There is little to no communication between players in this game. Apparently this is by design.
---
I’m sorry to hear about your connection issues. I haven’t had the same experience, personally. In the past week, I’ve had two ‘freezes’ that required a game restart and some occasionally sluggishness at the start of a session. But it hasn’t taken more than 2-3 minutes at most to launch the game and get into a server. 
---
So, I won’t be joining you in your rebellion. I don’t think the issues are as widespread as you seem to think. 
---
I’ve had more issues with XBox Chat than FO76 chat. In fact, I had to switch over to that last night. 
---
Best of luck. Have fun storming the castle.
---
Well a con for both is needing low health.
---
Are you using PC or console?
---
Powered, means the armor provides AP refresh bonus. WWR, means weapon weight reduction. 
---
Handmade is basically an AK-47 chambered in 5.56.
---
You won’t get the atoms until the payment actually processes,generally takes a few days past the renewal date. US bank holidays may alter this months
---
Lights and turrets will gorge themselves on your build budget. Use sparingly
---
Unyielding is best for melee as it boosts strength, but it has the base damage and energy resistance of the armor.
---
Bolstering is best for range as it comes with a boost to resistances.
---
A mix is best for snipers.
---
Ooops. And the B2525 is a bloodied rifle of choice with 25% faster fire rate and 25% less VATS action point cost.
---
I got robbed 1000 from collecting building supplies.
---
Enjoy the first months without presssure and don't try to advance too fast. Find a combat style that fits you and develop guns a armor for It. Don't bother diying often
---
Did you get either the carpet or plushie?
---
this boi still isnt resetting... whyyyyyyyyyyyyy :(
---
It's not about the feature, more of a reminder to adjust your perks
---
No. Only the Survival Camp and Scrapbox.
---
Nah I feel if i get a protection scavenger then I wnt the loot
---
Bolstering adds DR/ER, but after about 350 (I think) the benefits diminish comparatively. 
---
However, Unyielding adds up to +3 per piece, and higher stats are almost always useful. Most benefits don’t cap out until about 30, and I think some may have a higher cap. 
---
4 pieces of Uny and one of Bolst seems to be commonly accepted. And with Secret Service Armor having such high resistance always, especially with Buttressed, there’s not as much need for Bolstering.
---
Sure. I can get on in mornings or evenings my time depending on certain days
---
My advice is a mix 3-2 and figure out if you are moving more or standing still more
---
why bother? there is better food for xp.
---
Yes and no, I only get to play for a few hours a week so the grind doesn’t seem so bad, but knowing that I’ll never have the time to get any good rewards is what is ruining it for me. I love fallout games because you are able to play at your own rate and explore things and have fun, now it just seems like they are forcing you to keep moving forward at an unnatural pace that takes some of the enjoyment out of the game. I still haven’t completed all the new wastelanders content yet, just chipping away at it as I play.
---
That's where I'm at. But I can fit a level 1 pack rat into my build, so I share that. Weight reduction never hurts!
---
I collect and sell plans exclusively. 15c for everything and 5c for recipes. They usually sell like hot cakes, so I have a switch between my generator and vending machines. When I’m at 29k I’ll kill the vending machines and just keep playing. Every once in a while someone will stumble across my camp when they’re off and buy a few things, but at 15c it’s not wasted.
---
When I get to about 29,750 I’ll just go buy something expensive from the enclave or someone else’s vending.
---

No point in sneaking if everything is dead!
---
You basically get addicted to 5 different things giving you 50% extra damage. You get some negative special points form being addicted but with your mutations and whatnot you don't even notice it. You also pick the stuff that only effects the stat you're not bothered about. Charisma, int, luck. That kinds of thing. 
---
I can give you a peek at my specials and perks if you want
---
If playing solo, that's definitely the way to do it. But if you're bonded to a building team, gaining 4 intelligence, I wonder if switching to 25% event xp would be worth it.
---
Just look at what chem/alcool as the less drawback for addiction and you can do pretty much anything from there. 
---
FYI after 200 gauss shotgun the only bloodied one i got was a 1 star... I know the pain.
---
Yes please ;) do you reckon class freak is worth it?
---
 Schutzstaffel   
---
Just google "SS". Bless your innocence but I it was a really poor choice of acronym XD
---
I’m in the sane boat. I have t had any of these problems either on PC. All I’ve had is some crashes to desktop here and there, but I’ve come to fully expect that from any Fallout game at this point. I’d rather take two crashes in an entire day on 76 than two creases per every hour on Fallout 4.
---
you dont have to rebond if you just swap the goal out though.  so it would still be the 100%
---
Was taking an underwater break in the river when it was time to move. When I turned around I see 2 more swimmers not 5ft from me. It was survive for 30min so I just left them. I like pacifist hide and seek, but if the daily us kill a player....
---
I was feeling worn out by it before the season even started. A few other games I play (mainly destiny 2) use a similar setup and it's just so tiring to deal with.
---
I buy duplicates when the price is reasonable or low because my son and my brother also play. If they need the plans I'll give to them first. Not trying to buy all your 10 cap plans to turn a profit
---
I got the score for this challenge before I completed the challenge, like at 3/5, so I wasn't surprised that I didn't get the score when I did complete the challenge 5/5.
---
What annoys me is that after some time, even if I have the besthesda launcher open, it will just give me an offline error and I have to quit and reopen it... What's up with that?
---
This is actually really useful beacuse i was posting this because of secret service
---
I’m a level 27 and those dudes just sneeze at me and I’m toast.
---
Not 100% on that myself
---
Full unyeilding for bloodied, full lifesaving SS armor for my melee.
---
I have not any issues regarding log in either.   I’m on pc ... My problem is the occasional game freeze and an “oh shit” moment before it recovers.   Sometime though the freeze ends in a loss of sound which I I think I can fix but am too lazy to do.    
---
I’m not a tech guy but do you think they are really maxing out the servers?    GTA doesn’t seem to have nearly as much trouble and like you said, other games are fine so... why can’t FO76?
---
sane boat, i like it
---
inb4 ladydevann says "we're looking into this!" and a year goes by with no fix
---
I agree. Not nearly as many as before.

How are you getting costumes? I thought those were nuclear winter rewards only.
---
Judging by the time it took me, almost a full day, I think it’s another 14k after the skeleton.  It took forever.
---
i tough the tent and the scrapbox would stay, shame
---
25% per opened lunchbox near you for an hour, stacks up to 100%
---
That's what happens when your support lead is Ralph Wiggins
---
Unfortunately not. Although you get to keep the emoji's and costumes.
---
charging barrels go nicely with the faster fire rate
---
The costumes can be found as world spawned loot but the plans to craft them come from a dead trick or treater random encounter. Only the glowing skeleton is from NW.
---
You can do private events, if your doing your dailies they count.
---
Doesnt that make IT 75% less fr?
---
Your doing gods work.
---
Does a planet with multiple suns have seasons?
---
There is one on the picnic bench at the lighthouse that works👍
---
I Need above 200
---
I sell al my plans for 10 caps a piece, no matter how rare. If I know them, and my friends know them, then they go up for 10 caps
---
I appreciate the lore based answer! I understand this isn’t a prominent issue like the constant storm of “this free ammo convertor is trash” posts. I just wondered if anyone else had ever wanted to nuke the forest region and i thought maybe a discussion post talking about why we can’t might get the ball rolling.
---
Mine completed during an event.
---
If it was just standing there it means the owner just left that server and their camp qas near there.
---
Research your character build... keep your camp small and simple.   Be patient and friendly.   If you become wanted ,,, stash you junk and wait to be murdered.    It’s all good... we’ve all been there.
---
The public teams helps a lot with this - they removed the being dragged into PVP, and public teams cant change your camp.
---
So now you can team up with strangers without the underlying suspicion that they are only teaming up to screw you over.
---
I put up 4 walls with no door and say in there and made top 20 out of 50 lol
---
I want gullie armour. I'm tired of getting kicked in the gullies.
---
Oooh I totally forgot about the holiday. Thanks bud.
---
I couldn't believe how fast they went, only got a secret agent chest for the jetpack but only took 30 tries for a fairly decent 3 star unyielding one, nothing special like ap refresh bit chem weight and rad resist. Only got 2 out of the 30 but bloody seems to have an awful drop rate
---
Thanks 😊 I’ll do that 👍
---
Without glitching i think 15-20 mins is pretty normal
---
Yeah I absolutely noticed this as well. I made a post about it yesterday but it got no traction. Really feeling like they changed the spawn rate for events once patch 20 dropped.
---
Lol the board is ridiculously long, but other people not having a job shouldn’t get you so worked up dude. 
---
Ever heard of a keyboard warrior?
---
XBox One
---
Just logged in to check and they're still doing the same damage they were doing before.
---
Ouch was afraid of that, thanks much.
---
Some of these rewards are better than the stuff they've been putting in the atom shop in my opinion.
---
I believe you'll get it eventually because I had the same problem and randomly while I was standing in my camp I got my score that i never got
---
Let our man here be Deathclaw King if he wants to be.
---
I had an autocomplete issue today however my score did rise immediately but before my screen loaded.
---
I was shocked at the price of stimpaks, but I guess it's cheap for endgame lmao
---
You can try, but the pvp community already tried it, and it was a pathetic display to say the least. Whatever you try won't be any better. If you want to send a message, stop playing the game, cancel your 1st sub for more than five days, tell others you know to do the same, and leave it at that. Don't come back until you are satisfied with the state it's in
---
Big channels have had a hate boner for talking about the game since its launch, it doesn't matter what people are saying about it because ultimately the only people that care are the ones who aren't playing anyway. And bethesda is very aware of that. It's painfully obvious that the people acting like this is the worst that's happened have not been around this game for too long. People have put up with much worse and continued to play the game, so like it or not there's something pulling those people in and that will continue to be the case whether you try to start yourself up a little "revolt" or not
---
Seen a lot a people comment on their sales policy. Me, I follow the 10% rule when I dump it in the vender and it defaults a value of 50 caps, drop the last zero and sell it for 5, 300 becomes 30, 225 is 22 (round down) ectera.
---
15-20 mins. I tried to help a guy the other day who was level 78 and was dying over and over. I cleared stuff out and hung around for him to come back but he never did sadly. I wanted to just clear the robots out and him do al lthe nuke stuff but it didn't work out. 
---
Well done you!
---
I've heard a rumor that any holotapes added during Wastelanders don't work for the challenge. Just stop by Flatwoods and loot the bodies for holotapes, there's about a dozen of em scattered across the town.
---
You HAVE to have class freak 3 to become all powerful =0

Normally i have adrenaline instead of thru-hiker but adrenaline is fooked right now. 
---
The ironclad and evasive is there for extra DR for things like SBQ, Wendigo colossus, project paradise. You could easily lose ironclad and have 3 in adamantium and move 3 points somewhere else. Also you could probably lose enforcer. I use it because of the teams. I can murder everything but instead i shoot at their feet and cripple them (shotgun does 50% limb damage)  
---
Demo expert is a must though. 50% extra damage
---
With new public teams i dont have lone wanderer on. It's worth being in a team by yourself then you get +3 to all stats from herd mentality. 
---
I have the following addictions. You need to take roughly 5 of each in quick succession. 
---
Alcohol -1 agi -1 Chr
---
Daddy-o -1per -1 int
---
daytripper -1 lck -1 chr
---
mentats -1 chr
---
psycho -10 DR -1 str
---
It’s weird, it seemed like I got double this month too...
---
adrenaline being borked isnt a little thing..
---
“I’m disabled!!”
---
I mean, there *are* areas of it you can launch at. Morgantown, for one. Just west of Slocum’s Joe too, I think. As far as an actual real world explanation for why you can’t nuke that area, I’m sure it’d be something along the lines of private servers being exactly like public ones, just restricted to people that are paying for them and their friends, and those restrictions are the only differences. But that’s only my guess.
---
Ok thank you though
---
I'm not talking about the perk system. I'm talking about pvp and camp damage.
---
Lack of testing.
---
people who werent doing events all along are fucking morons..
---
You and me both friend. Gonna change it as soon as I get home from work haha
---
Oh, in that case, Level at least to 20 before starting Wastelanders &amp; setup your character to be able to get to specials of at least 8 through buffs (str, Int &amp; chr especially). 
---
Also, whatever build you go with, front load your specials for to have more balanced spread for skill check reasons already mentioned.
---
Hope that helps!
---
It's been like that for a while (long before public teams), it prevents you from farming unlimited bots in the silo.
---
I actually think the red dot with the iron front is kinda cool
---
The game evolved. It happens. The only thing you can do now is roll with it or run away.
---
so long as they made it so no one but the camp owner can remove stuff. i like the idea.
---
It’s nice, I’m glad I can work towards a more group friendly build now that player interaction is a thing. I just wish you could designate if you were just going to group for the sake of being in a group but not actually doing anything vs actually going around doing things.
---
I went after three weekly challenges and received no score as well.. 😔
---
Very informative you're a legend many thanks :) wait what's happened to adrenaline 0_o
---
Most people dont run it as part of their active build - its only useful when scrapping weapons/armour, so most people collect all the weapons, then swap it in while they scrap.
---
Because I farm Burrows a lot and it’s convenient.
---
Go to Rose at the top of the world and pick a holotape up there
---
should have put that in the title.. i didnt read your cry
---
&gt; I’m not a tech guy but do you think they are really maxing out the servers? GTA doesn’t seem to have nearly as much trouble and like you said, other games are fine so... why can’t FO76?
---
The answer is fairly simple: their foundations are rotten and unstable. The game is running on a slightly modified version of an engine that was in some ways already outdated when it was first made. That contributes to the clunkiness and instability of the game as a whole, and it's why the coding is always such a spaghetti mess. The fact that so many things are broken and inefficient puts a heavier strain on the servers, which are also just a cheap alternative rented out from some third party. But it would take years to recreate this game in a better engine, and even proper dedicated servers wouldn't be too much help with everything else crapping it up, so there's really nothing that they are able to do about it for the immediate future. Not that they really would anyway
---
https://twitter.com/BethesdaSupport/status/1279152283863920640?s=19
---
Bethesda responded to my Twitter post. Same issues as stated.
---
Yesterday I was the sole remaining person and became Overseer without firing a single round. It was pure bliss sitting there in a bush watching a scorchbeast kill the last guy lol. I reached rank 50 and got my glowing skeleton from that round, now I can finally get back to the real game!
---
How do you know when herd mentality or empath is triggered?
---
Yep! Just finished grabbing all the cards I wanted a while back, and from this, I think I’ve decided to keep eluding concentrated.
---
I used to do the same thing but I got tired of swapping perks all the time.
---
&gt;stash box
---
so my CAMP will automatically pull from the stash box ?. For example, if I build a door. Will I have to build the materials in my inventory or will they auto pull from my stash ?
---
I think I hear Charles from rdr2 sometimes.
---
Unless it's just static junk build items, what you're asking for will destroy server performance.
---
it depends on how broken the game is at any given moment..
---
If you get into a team where someone is already sharing that, you can swap in another 1pt CHR card and share that instead.
---
Bodyguards, tenderiser etc.
---
That's okay. Youre one of those people who lack the brain capacity and ability to read beyond a headline before opening your mouth and spewing your moutharrhea. Bless your heart. 😘
---
My post is above bethesdas reply with photo. No way I could complete 5/5 dailies when only 2 were completed. The 2 that were completed I never completed either.
---
I was logged in at reset. And immediately after reset I checked dailies. Three of them were shown as completed. 
---
Logged out and logged in. No change.
---
This. This is all by design.
---
Yes exactly, only the owner has access to it.
---
insinuating someone is stupid isnt very civil..
---
I did not call you names..
---
Get all the heavy gunner perks + bear arms in str so 12 pts minimum.
---
Stabilised is 3 pts in Int for using heavy guns in PA. One gun army in Luck is also good to have.
---
Get all the normal damage perks (bloody mess, Adrenaline, tenderiser, glow sighted)
---
Get your mutation perks.
---
Get only 5 addictions and ones that have side effects that won’t take away too much from your build (-Chr, -Int).
---
Something like this:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a71gce/fallout_76_heavy_gunner_build/?utm_source=amp&amp;utm_medium=&amp;utm_content=post_body
---
says the guy who is literally crying about pvp...
---
That's all I sell in my vending machines, and I sell them all at suggested retail cap value
---
Yeah the red dot ain’t bad but they need to fix the iron sites, just never really liked the zoom the red dot has... just not for me
---
Haha! Best by far! So true 😄
---
Carnivore now doubles the effects
---
Looks like they're for your adventure mode and NW atom shop settings. So it includes the favorites, and which emotes, icons, etc are currently equipped. Thank you for this post, I've actually been having an issue where these have not been saving for months now, which means my loot bags always reset to default after leaving the game. Got no answers here or through googling, but this looks like a lead
---
It happened to me at the Whitespring Station
---
And I don’t have so bloodied weapons I muled them off to another toon for safe keeping.
---
I am getting extra score. I have completed two 250 score challenges and I have gotten an additional 1000 score
---
some people lack the brain capacity and ability to see the forest through the trees..
---
That's just too much micromanaging to be worth it.
---
I always share a tier 3 inspiration perk. 15% more exp for everyone. 
---
If someone else is sharing it, I'll do either bloody mess, hard bargain, or a max traveling pharmacy, or through hiker.
---
I really rather not risk touching NW since it seems to be the cause of challenges auto-completing.
---
That and no more than a single legendary creature has loaded onto the servers to be killed in 4 days. One Megasloth and one deathclaw, but no legendary kills for my player characters...
---
lol I'm not raggin on you at all my bad if I sounded like that .. and yes this game is not a game I actually pvp in cause of the unreliable keybinds, no animation cancelling etc etc .. but at the same time I can't help but argue the point, I wish games that at least begin to understand to seperate these game modes actually stick to it and keep them seperated
---
The most money I've spent on games was ones where I can level and obtain the things I want either through pve or pvp .. so I spend money in both game modes
---
In this game though .. I can't stand the movement, the animations the crappy options the low ceiling on the meta etc so I stick to adventure mode ... I just hate how they jumped on the bandwagon trying to push people into a game mode they don't want/intend to play
---
I want to gain all my season crap in the game mode I play .. I'm only a casual player in this game
---
On PS4 I’ve noticed several areas that haven’t rendered.
---
By using your credit card for Atoms to progress the season hahaha
---
You can piss off people by doing this, especially if they're not physically roaming around with you.
---
Sounds like someone needs to go play DayZ
---
I'd appreciate that. I always have it on for convenience but if someone was sharing it I could throw on something with some more utility.
---
You really expect them to have to follow the same rules as players?!
---
Tips for real life.
---
I hear Uthgerd the Unbroken from Skyrim all the time lol
---
Might this be due to the latest patch?
---
Fixing bugs doesn't earn them money. New content does.
---
We'll never truly see much effort put towards bug fixes.
---
there is such a thing as paragraphs.
---
and this is some massively whiny shit ironically enough.
---
It usually shows which one, right next to the name.
---
And their reply is for the 3/5 glitch, not this one!   But any reply is better than no reply. At least it's a conversation started.
---
I'm too used to swapping now - lockpicking, green thumb, hard bargain, inspirational, hacker, armourer, weapon artisan, science, science expert, science master, ammo smith, constructor, home defense, super duper.
---
Really wish they made some perks passive.
---
Open your perks menu, and the shared perks will appear "equipped" on the top of the stack with a chain-link symbol in the top right of the card.
---
Yeah, that have to reprogram the private servers to allow nukes anywhere. I'd say that is last on their list of things to do.
---
yeah that and the crazy shot through the crack in the wall where VATs doesn't even pick up a hit 
---
or you hit em once, twice almost dead then suddenly the next 3 shots take 1% hp each .. clinging to life then you have to reload all while taking more bullets to the face with their unlimited clips
---
It's not working
---
they’re fixing it. remain calm.
---
Yes. Look over the sub, it's happening a lot.
---
it just stopped working. no longer gives a % increase. 
---
But aye just play around with it. It's a beast. Also. If you weren't aware.. when you go into vats you will miss the first shot nearly every single time. Even at 95%. 
---
You can go in and out and in to vats to fix it. or just shoot then shoot again
---
yeah I keep hearing the guy from the dark brotherhood and wonder how old this guy has to be now
---
Areas not rendering was part of the original release. So it may be that the last patch messed a few things.
---
Bugs don't tend to affect everybody.
---
I'm running 4 pieces of SS with Buttressed, the chest has the Jetpack. Both legs are Vanguard's and I hope to get the other three Vanguard's as well. Right now I'm sitting at DR 507 ER 577 RR 287 with 7 mutations. What's Power Armor for lol??
---
That is the most truthful answer.
---
they need to make an actual mail system like in most mmos. so you can send items and massages to friends and alts. 
---
it would be nice to let a friend on a different server know that we are about to a raid/event/farm ect
---
come from your junk wherever it is.
---
This has been an issue since before last year. 
---
People lost out on atoms on a daily/weekly basis but never really had too much of an issue because the atoms weren't needed. S.C.O.R.E is needed
---
Armor can’t have skins in NW because it’s suppose to be a level playing field. If you can’t tell what type of armor someone has on at a distance it’s a big disadvantage
---
Thx
---
Go back to worshipping the Mothman bro
---
You loot goblin lol
---
My vats locks on and doesn’t release till the enemy is dead.  Happened on sbq today so ya know that was a long lock on.
---
It shows a card but it wasn’t showing what the card was just a blank card and a number
---
Sweet Mother, sweet Mother, send the Vault Dweller unto me, for the sins of the unworthy must be baptized in blood and fear
---
Same. I’m not too bothered because it is a game, but it should be addressed.
---
you first, buddy. the door's over there, as you so enthusiastically put it.
---
You can drop them or put them in your vending machines. Bots don’t buy them.
---
Well we were saying it one month before the update released, but most people didn't believe us.  
---
Now it's too late.
---
That happened to me, too. When I completed the challenge I got a few atoms but no S.C.O.R.E. And I’ve notice at least one other that has done this. It was one of today’s daily events.
---
I have done over a dozen events and have not passed rank 1...
---
I always sell plans for 1/2 the listed price and the recipes for 9 caps (except the hard to find ones, those go for listed price of 50). If a plan doesn’t sell from my vending in 2 weeks I pull it and put it in a suitcase at the station near Whitesprings.
---
I personally feel that I’ll enjoy it a lot note once more story content drops. And even once a colossal problem drops
---
THANKS A LOT! Thats what i was looking for, just one question, addictions are permanent? Or i will lose my addictions in a specified time?
---
Yeah, if I’m up there I go buy things, but no chance in this situation. I sell higher end stuff like vanguard and unyielding pieces or pews.
---
I launched my first today, all alone, level 75 and it took me HOURS! Then I had no idea what to do in the nuke zone? Just run around and collect stuff? It was fun but never again haha.
---
You get exactly 1500 atoms.
---
I mean that those 3 cards technically have 3 ranks to them.  If you want, you can level up Heavy Gunner 3 times for an extra 20% damage.  I do not.  Instead, I take Heavy gunner, Expert Heavy Gunner, and Master Heavy gunner for an extra 30% total.  This only costs 3 cards in strength, as opposed to 9 cards in strength if you level all of those cards up to their max ranks. Having 30% less damage then I could have, in exchange for 6 more card slots in strength is my preferred choice.  It allows me to run Bear Arms 3 and Travelking Pharmacy 3 (when in power armor) or Ordinance Express 3 (when not in power armor, Since I have the raider chem backpack)
---
Yeah I just started selling things with a Vending machine and I knew right away to sell known plans for 10 caps except for maybe weapon plans or mods for a few more.. I'd try to find what a weapon plan was normally going for and sell it for like half.
---
I also sell bulk adhesive for cheap but not many customers might have to lower even more lol
---
No, you just noticed this Now... This has been going on for a while... Noticed this since Wastelanders...
---
Make sure your scrap box is the last container you "look" at, then go to any vendor and trade. The vendor side, at the bottom, while have your scrap box weight.
---
Yeah I like jumping high, not jumping like I'm on the moon.
---
yeah! 
---
I need a game where I can cause indiscriminate emotional distress to other players and not feel judged but be applauded!
---
Where I can take advantage of glitches and bugs to make myself rich off other players hard work like a real raider!
---
And sure enough all you fallout lore nerds just gottttaaa play this fallout spin off and ruin my gameplay! HOW DARE YOU!
---
Addictions are permanent but stay away from addiction and rehab clinics.
---
One more thing, if you have a mentats addiction and then take me tats, it suppressed the down side temporarily but you still get the damage bonus.
---
Oh and another thing, bufftats is a Buffout addiction, psychobuff is a psycho addiction etc
---
That's what I thought. People are insisting that they can be vendored.
---
So this is a case of daily challenges not resetting from the previous day? Interesting.
---
No, I was in game doing an event. As soon as the event was done I realised the challenges had reset and I looked to see what I had to do. The event just finished as the challenges reset so I never had time to complete ANY of them. 
---
• Kill a creature (15/15) 
---
• NW: Deploy a C.A.M.P. (3/3)
---
• Gold Star: Complete a Daily Challenge (5/5)
---
The funny part about 2 of these is,
---
1. I hadn't even been in NW yet, so it was impossible for me to have done the NW challenge. 
---
2. Only 1 adventure challenge had been done so the Gold Star challenge couldn't have even been close to finishing. 
---
Its just a stupid bug that they should have fixed long ago. Support has received NUMEROUS complaints about it, the team 100% know about it and haven't fixed it because it benefits them to not fix it.
---
Just in your vending machine.
---
TL:DR nuclear winter is shit. I want survival mode back. Something like a rust lite would be nice.
---
Your misery has improved my day.  Thanks for posting!
---
Well that sucks
---
Not yet. August 4th.
---
I wish I could shoot as far as them.
---
Thank you! Frames improved hugely with this! I'm not having the water issue, but at some locations, although the marker shows 55-60 fps, it doesn't run smoothly. I've read that vsync can't be tweaked in this game?
---
Awesome thank you!!
---
you can easily get 8-10 at valley galleria
---
Awww thank you very much! I’m on PC though. I appreciate you!
---
i completed two weekly challenges that were supposed to award 1000 points each... they did not. i'm still salty over it :-/
---
While true, this sort of thing shouldn't even get that far.  Someone in product or development should have said "This is stupid, don't do this" long before it hit any sort of testing.
---
max quick hands..
---
The Red Rocket Mega Stop is a good place for that, too.
---
Tried the 4 at foundation didn’t work
---
This
---
It must take incredible self restraint to not spam learn every plan.
---
Herd mentality is easy ish, you can check your special under status in your pip boy and compare values in and out of a group.
---
Empath is a bit different, it needs someone to apply the effect to, so aslong as your in a group with more than one person and have the mutation it should be affecting you. I dont run it, so I dont know an easy check, sorry.
---
Yeah
---
Did you just assume my gender?
---
Thanks thanks and thanks again! Im a noob so i really needed to know how it works!! Now i can start with this build finally 💪🏻
---
  They still hit hard.  L208 - Out of PA, they kill me in about 3 hits - mostly its the ra damage)
---
It has definitely got worse. I'm missing 4-5 times in a row at 95% hit probability with a tesla. Tested today with a bunch of low-level ghouls. Taking a full load to achieve two hits in VATS. Manual aim hits every time.  Also getting the problem with ballistic weapons where the hit happens, sound effects play,  and damage is calculated but the enemy healthbar isn't affected.
---
The description says double xp for completing events, so you really want builder for most of the event, then swich group type just before it ends.
---
I wonder if we're all reading "It just works" wrong; maybe it's more like "It juuuussssst works" like it meets the minimum criteria for technically working.
---
28 times, that’s insanity, I know the feeling though, like you’re trying to beat the game at its own game lol
---
And can't smell your own shit on your knees.
---
Sorry not sorry. nobody meant to hurt you.. Stop crying about every little thing
---
Dude... Make another character for diferent builds...
---
Lol very intimidated! Unfortunately I’m on PC! Seems like everybody is on console. Bummer!
---
I’ll 100% try this. But I’m like 90% sure it won’t do a damn thing
---
Totally perfect!
---
Bolstering boosts your stats when you are low on health.
---
IIRC, unyielding boosts you when you are high health.
---
It flashes the name of the perk next to their player name when they join I think.
---
Why, i have 600+ skillpoints to spend.
---
At least you had a good time! I think sometimes people forget this is all just fun! I’m glad you enjoyed it 😄
---
And herbivore gets zero.
---
A good one to keep an eye on .. which gets fixed, then broken, then fixes then broken is inside the garahan mining HQ (sp?) walk in and through to the office on the first floor there with the bathroom and look at the med kit on the wall
---
Some patches have fixed it, some have broken it and some later ones re-fixed it and so on .. amazing work these people do
---
Show me where I called you "names"?
---
Lol. Will do mr megasloth
---
Im not disrupting, Im helping, one less to kill them.
---
As someone who usually plays solo, i'm probably guilty of forgetting to share. thanks for the PSA.
---
Same here. Did more events today than I've ever done and people actually showed to them for once.
---
Can't be robbed of score ... if you have already said screw the battle pass.
---
*taps finger on head.
---
Say no to vegan in the wasteland
---
I feel you .. but prefer to smell you .. where do you live?
---
Holy crap really? Thank you so much. I’m a commando build but nothing really more than that. I get so stressed when I try to grind and get gear hence not having good gear lol. Im just using the Chinese stealth armor. It’s really sweet and that’s why I’m still using my level 30 fixer. They just go well together.  😄I’m kalamity929, hopefully I’ll see you soon!
---
&gt; insinuating someone is stupid isnt very civil..
---
&gt;Youre one of those people who lack the brain capacity
---
Because you wont depend on skill points to play mellee or comando
---
Spend real money or spend more time in the game.
---
Not a single punctuation mark in sight.
---
i am getting conflicted reports everywhere i look. does INT affect XP in 76 or not?
---
O...m...g... I'm going there right now
---
It's the same non fun activities, plus now Bethesda says what you 'buy' via season rewards - and surprise, 95% is it is shit.
---
Ooh I’ll add you. It’d be cool to launch together! I’m kalamity929.
---
Drop them in blue suitcases at train stations for other players
---
If I’m out of town and can’t bring my Xbox what am I supposed to do and what if people don’t have that kind of money to spend
---
I have a bloodied commando build. That doesn't stop other bloodied player hiding and getting too scared to do anything, thus they changing builds. Sorry man if you take issue with that you should look for them. Their easy to find if you know where they hide due to your berserkers build.
---
I know what I'm talking about. Your just another triggered person crying over bloodied because not everyone plays it the same way and someone spoke about it...
---
You gotta go back into the main menu first I had this happen to me too
---
I can use paint in my NW Scout armor
---
I’ve seen them reload shotguns
---
If it's an atom shop item it's not tradeable.

I’ll be on later tonight. Already in my vendor.
---
I couldn't find it. It only offered to swap from buying to selling ammo

There is a hidden damage reduction effect in Power Armor. Each piece adds a certain amount (I don’t recall the exact amount off the top of my head). This means that for pure damage reduction, PA with less DR/ER is technically better. But the lack of useful legendary effects balances this out. Even with a full set of Buttressed Secret Service Armor, there are a handful of situations where I prefer PA. But not many.
---
It's a new bug since patch 20. It wasn't like that before. I've sent a ticket into Bethesda about it but it might be worth you sending in one as well so they have an idea that it's not just a one off thing for one person.
---
I was not a "raider" in the early days. I role played as a shopkeeper and was very successful at it. I didn't exploit or use glitches and I don't now. Cute of you to assume that.
---
two i think
---
It was awesome! I had no trouble at all in the silo. At the queen fight I did just fine. I did get a tad over excited and went down because I wasn’t paying attention like I should have lol but someone revived me. I think the armor is really fantastic!
---
8 because the update took two days and another day for weeklies not registering right for me.
---
Oh no I’m sorry!!!!
---
Everyone complaining about ammo converter and this huge iceberg just slipping through the net wow. That's a whole 5 points I got going spare there
---
They just want us to spend our atoms or real money
---
I didn't say that its the only rifle that you can use. You can make damn near anything work if its got good enough rolls. That's not the point I'm trying to make though.
---
Stealth commando with a fixer is the highest ranged DPS in the game, discounting bugged and hacked guns. That's just how it is.
---
You can use your Dragon, I can use my 50 Cal, and we can both have fun doing it. But it doesn't change that fact.
---
There is double XP and double score dailys coming this month which will help.
---
42
---
I've had the opposite experience where it is red and still places.
---
There are ways to add clutter. If you’re on PC I’d be more than happy to show you some of my clutter builds
---
Thanks for the info. Shame it's such a pain in the ass to send in a ticket. They need an in game option like Subnautica.
---
It does as long there’s more than one person in it
---
Ah good to know. I just love that I don't need fusion cores for my jetpack. But a few bursts and my AP is gone.
---
I run a support build, often sharing defensive perks or the +15% exp in team and ... i wish i could share more than one perk, having 15 base charisma should unlock an additional perk "sharing slot" That allow to share a level 3  for free.
---
Pause
---
Just finish all the other dailies than do it. That's what I've been doing. Cant auto-complete finished dailies
---
There apparently was a glitch at some point where you could sell plans to vendors.
---
most people haven't realised. Probably. I only know because people on here mentioned it.
---
Shhhhh...don't say anything. They might fix it /s
---
Oh just because I play solo. I tried it around level 49 and it was a complete failure. Only got back to trying recently! I’d like to try teaming up though. Everybody is so cool here. Honestly I was a little nervous to try meeting folks because some other gaming communities aren’t as nice lol
---
Lemme take a guess, did you just scrap or buy a whole fuckin' bunch of ammo?
---
Except 3 commas and a question mark
---
How can you advance so fast?
---
Nope. It's a little frustrating. Another one that gets me a fraction of the time is I'm teamed up in the main menu, the leader starts the match and it leaves me in the main menu
---
Thank you so much!! I appreciate you! 😄
---
So what exactly is the sentinel prefix? Finally just figured out what cavalier is, less damage while sprinting. See these phrases a lot on here. Played this game for over a year, and still learning new things
---
It says your team has to be near for Herd Mentality to work. How close do you have to be for it to work?
---
Yep I used nukacrypt as well!
---
You’ll get the hang of it if you play long enough. I still get your point though.
---
12. I hope my glacial pace serves as encouragement.
---
when you present yourself like an asshole.. people treat you like one..
---
Lol and very happy to be! Thank you!
---
We haven't run into that yet.  *knock on wood*
---
It does. Another reason unyielding is so OP, it speeds up leveling
---
Give it a whirl! If you’re on PC and want company I’m here - kalamity929
---
Where does it drop? Thx!
---
Is this for one of the daily challenges?
---
Ah, I see you're a wastelander of culture.
---
You get my up vote needs to be made more aware and fixed pronto breaks a fair few builds
---
It’s a great accomplishment no matter what! Good times! 😄
---
Today it is, so I'd assume itll come back within the 10 weeks
---
They've done studies, you know. 60% of the time, it works every time.
---
Sadly you need another player on your team but how far away they are doesn't seem to matter
---
Does it not stack?
---
1
---
I would find a way to run a maxed Blocker..
---
ignoring 45% incoming melee damage is huge in this game..
---
Never said I wasn't an asshole. Do you think I made this post assuming that I was not going to get any backlash? This isn't a Fallout 76 server where everyone is friendly and give out free hugs...😂
---
Of course I knew I'd be treated like an asshole. 😂
---
I get the same feeling every so often.  After Fasnacth, I went to world of tanks for a bit.  Just started back on Fallout casually playing score and trying out public teams.
---
Yup! I have the ammo collection perk and always get the wrong ammo. Doesn't sell too fast, so normally I do a giant drop maybe once a month to lighten the load.
---
Thought maybe I could finally turn that ammo into something useful!
---
Okay, I just hit play on the first holotape in the asylum and it worked for the challenge
---
Oh, strange. No idea then
---
I abandoned my tesla because of this. It was having the worst accuracy of them all.
---
You’d think they would spend some time doing exactly as you suggested since Netflix is making a tv show.    Imagine how much money they could make.      Even without the mass marketing possibility of a tv show, the game and its players certainly deserve a better, smoother experience.    I hope they do... this is my favorite game.
---
Same for every skin you get in NW
---
ok.. so youre an asshole..
---
congrats.. point proven
---
No idea about vsync but I do know that, in other fallout games, going above 60 fps is not recommended since it causes a lot of glitches. I don't know if it's the case in 76. Maybe you can disable the ingame Vsync in your ini files and set your GPU so 76 don't go too much above 60 to avoid problems but, again, never played with those things myself. :s
---
It's the best sale because the mystery pick is a scam lol
---
I appreciate that. Being sneak I’ve been able to avoid a lot but I’ll give it a go.
---
This game has a great community to offset the small percentage of jerks. Glad you ran into some of the former before the latter. Welcome! 👍🏻
---
Either one (as well as the tattered field jacket which is equally rare) have a VERY rare chance to be rewarded when completing certain events in the Mire region. Irrational Fear, Heart Of The Swamp, and the bomb disposal daily event from Boomer the police robot who can be found at the Southern Belle motel.
---
&gt; I think majority of people who have complained to the point where the game had to be changed......I think they have missed the big picture....what the game was intended to be
---
So...I take it you haven't actually seen the pre-release trailers and interviews? This is being shaped towards what is their stated intent of the game, what we got on launch was a beta version of that. The game was empty not by design, but because they did not have the resources to actually finish it yet for some reason decided to launch it anyway. Probably the clearest indication of that is all the features like player vending, collectrons, etc that we saw in pre-release trailers but ended up coming over a year later. Some of it was definitely shaped by feedback, but this community and this sub specifically take far too much credit for things. The fact that something happens after months of work and it just so happens somebody complained about it in the past does not mean they *created* that idea. Some locations were clearly left unfinished when something else was intended, some stories were clearly incomplete or ambiguous with the intent to be finished later. The "no humans" thing was obviously a late stage decision because their excuse for it was really poor and the robots were just shoehorned in. They could have been replaced with generic people and those would have served the exact same purpose. 
---
The rest just sounds like stockholm syndrome lol. People were able to make do by doing everything themselves, but very few people enjoyed it. I remember the old days of trading before player vendors and it was a tedious nightmare that everybody I knew merely put up with. The pvp was a steaming mess from the very beginning and it will always continue to be so, no matter how much they try to improve it.
---
As for your friends...the game has been out for almost two years, and has barely received any new content since then, so it's not surprising people are getting bored of the game. Believe it or not, things change in life. Eminem will not always be releasing music, Ninja will not always be playing Fortnite, and your pals won't be roleplaying in f76 for the rest of time. I get being a glutton for punishment, we all had to be that to some extent to bear the game in its early stages, but if you still want more, there are now other alternatives. DayZ or Rust seem to have the kinds of communities you're looking for. If you want it more fallout themed, there are still some fairly active FOnline sessions going on that let you truly feel a hardcore experience, not the casual one that will inevitably exist with such a massive scale game that itself doesn't know what it wants to be
---
as others have stated they are probably not categorized yet. im assuming that will happen along with legendary perks though. but from their mods, i think its safe to assume they're sturdy
---
Read enough crybaby culture posts and it's easy to make one yourself.
---
This, I gave them 60 dollars in faith. Now 20 bucks will get you the game and 40 bucks of atoms. I essentially got nothing but months of frustration for supporting them. Feel kinda jipped.
---
Same as Cavalier except change sprinting and standing still. Less damage while standing still
---
A simple yet humble request
---
I logged on after 12 and the "read a holotape" was already completed.
---
beta
---
There's usually(unless someone gets it) a copy of one of the Tales From The WVA Hills inside the Gift Shop at Uncanny Caverns. Also a copy of that on one of the bars on the rooftop bar at Watoga Estates.
---
I picked mine up today from the office on the same floor where Vendorbot Resin is at Pleasant Valley Ski
---
By lying about it because where other people are doesn't matter
---
13. I just do the dailies and weeklies without earning much exp in between.
---
Good question. I presumed no, but could be interesting is you can potentially have it 4 times
---
Never thought the day would come where getting ahead and herd mentality seems a good idea again. I'm even starting to use cards I never used like inspirational and stranger in numbers
---
i did alt+f4 earlier and joined the same team when i got back in. might have been an outlier though, not sure XD
---
Thanks. Want to know what to keep an eye out for while visiting vendors. Can AP refresh roll with these prefixes too?
---
Yeah I’m sneak if you run sneak three and one piece of unyielding harder to detect you’ll be good. I’m never detected except during the imposter sheep. Some reason I get agroed by the eye bots.
---
Yeah, if you want to do The Legendary Run public teams are very worth it especially for the XP boosts. I've found teams that will use lunch boxes and stuff with people as well which can help even more. Find a good event group and just hit a whole bunch back to back.
---
Also, unlimited named markers...
---
This is the true end game.
---
I'm fairly certain its 2% per int, so 8% total with fully bonded team
---
Huh Strange, did the same yesterday and it won't work.
---
Tested even on a friends private world where he was the public leader.
---
What answer are you looking for because it seems like you answered your own question?
---
Haha no worries, im glad you jumped in. A one sided discussion is just an echo chamber. It always good to have differing opinions.
---
I keep trying to run + slide and all I do is piss off my pip boy 😂 someday maybe
---
Not.....ussss.....
---
Just remember, it was the sub that hyped up wastelanders as the magic solution to fix every problem in the game, not bethesda. They advertised it as a major expansion, which it more or less was. I've been warning people to curb their expectations for months before it was even initially supposed to release, but every complaint here for about half a year was shut down by "wastelanders will fix it"
---
If someone would ever join my party!!!! 😭
---
😂😂😂
---
My friend said he thinks a lot of the settlers are voiced by him as well. I wonder if maybe that's actually the case.
---
My bow keeps missing these 95% shots, but on the flip side I also consistently rip even 5% shots, especially against stationary targets, but also have managed to many a times shoot enemies through walls and shit.
---
We can have a rough idea. It took them just short of a year to fix a typo that made the prime combat rifle receivers use ultracite .44 instead of ultracite .45. I remember running a test with the geck for fallout 4, and a fix for that without knowing any of the related item IDs took roughly 3 minutes
---
It does. 5% per point I think
---
I was XTrashcanCarlaX and I ran Trashcan Carla's Buy &amp; Sell so I am very aware of what it was like in the early days because I've been here since day one. Yes the mechanics were a mess and the trading system that crashed every 5 seconds was a nightmare but the game felt more raw. You didn't take a casual stroll through the Wasteland then, you walked around with fear and that was exciting.
---
What fun is a casino where you always win?
---
99.  Bruh git gud
---
Your a cannibal I assume. Bonuses now double with update 20 for cannibal and herbivore
---
It's so hard. Trying to say "No" to all of those juicy flip lighters. But at least bulk oil nets you some cash when you're not too too far into the game. But basically just tag for search the components you're always running low on and only pick up junk with those specific components.
---
Yes it can! Good luck in your search!!!
---
hey dude me again lol, do you hace any advice for doing this strategy in an area with uneven terrain or like over water?
---
I may or may not be trying to build a castle with a moat and I'm struggling haha
---
You are trash you need vats because you can't aim and need bloody because you get your ass kicked without cheese
---
No, you’re saying it needs to be nerfed because you’re triggered that some people hid during an event and I don’t agree with that sentiment.
---
Sure does! Tatooine for instance has four seasons:
---
1. Summer
---
2. Summer!
---
3. SUMMER!!!
---
4. OH GOD WHY DOES ANYONE LIVE HERE??!!
---
You cant, if you miss one daily you cant finish the season. Unless you farm the repeatble real Hard
---
I cannot believe this doesn't have more upvotes! Thanks for the giggle!
---
OK, I've tested this over a few SCORE level-ups and it looks like the banner is fixed. The new version at the Box link was my 10th attempt...
---
By the way, you can actually see all of the Legendary Run board game display just by clicking and dragging it.
---
Maybe it's because we all are looking for them more
---
Yeah that’s pretty on the nose. But still, they have a community of people highlighting their issues. They don’t need play testers: we *are* the play testers. But they just don’t seem to take any feedback into consideration when it’s *all* right here. Granted, some people bitch a little too much, yes, but still. There’s valuable player input in this sub. It’s not like Bethesda devs don’t know Reddit exists. 
---
All it takes is simple communication and the game could be loads better.
---
11-ish right now.
---
So on console I’m seeing that players are having a hard time accepting Building as the go-to team...I guess they don’t watch AngryTurtle on Youtube🤷‍♂️
---
Awesome idea. Been more than a few camps I've wanted to leave a little gift to show appreciation for their creativity in building or their good values in vendors. Sometimes I'll leave a bag on their bed, but I assume most of the time the next visitor to the camp ends up taking it instead of the owner.
---
Ok yup I still feel really bad
---
complains about "crybaby culture" while being a massive cry baby. 
---
lmao hop along
---
And one less teammate that could actually be actively helping them try to win.
---
Though I’m uncertain, with this update Carnivore means that the boosts from the foods won’t work, and herbivore + strange in numbers will boost them higher
---
/r/gatekeeping is that way ----&gt;
---
My favourite is a troubleshooters ffr faster reload .50 cal
---
Ammo is cheap and exremely plentiful and just chews through all the robots in a silo
---
Thanks again, I'll insist on those
---
HOLD ⭕️
---
That will completely exit a console, regardless of loop.
---
Yeah, seems to be my issue too. Kinda want to start event party and switch it to building once it's full
---
Never noticed before, i usually try to prep launch and gtfo of there, thanks.
---
Delete this now if you know what’s good for you...
---
maybe ur just bad
---
No problem!
---
Lmao probably
---
I am trying to win, I reach top 5 most of the time without a gun... Im closer to winning then my teammates that go Guns blazing and die in the 30s rank... Use your brain, not your muscle....
---
Weird...I got downvoted for providing a helpful and informative reply. Guess someone doesn't want people to know where to get those outfits.
---
You win less often today than you did a year ago. There have been far more nerfs than buffs. Things not working is not a challenge, it's a fruitless barrier to actually playing the game. "Back in the day", you could go through a nuke zone with two dozen rad-x stacked up, kill bloated ghouls for 700 exp each, and get yourself a tse pump action that dealt 4k damage per hit from one of them. And you could do all this while effectively invincible thanks to your duped unyielding sentinel armor that had its full pre-nerf effects, which also was never removed after countless dupe waves. Or you could nuke watoga and hunt down 3* level 50 legendaries that weren't even hostile to you and farm all the gear you wanted off them. After a hard day of farming, back before the most overpowered legendary drops were removed from the pools, you had to go do some maintenance with your gear, right? Nah, white knight and gunsmith were better back then, and repair costs were cheaper. There was no fear back then, don't kid yourself. It's still pretty easy now, but they added layers of grinding behind it. Back then there was neither that grind nor the difficulty to the extent that exists today
---
Hey everybody, this is an issue thar's been going on since before the new update. It only happens if you go into Nuclear Winter before you load into a regular world.  It was doing it before the update with the daily challenges. Just load into a regular world first and then go into Nuclear Winter and you won't lose any challenge\SCORE points. I hope this helps you all out. 👍
---
Not sure where this is coming from. You get get killed a lot in PVP by bloodied builds? Also, I’m pretty sure every fallout game was built with the focus on VATS.
---
Hey, seems to work for you guys so...why not?
---
And yeah, you hop along little rabbit. Make sure you hop right into the middle of a busy street.
---
bitch who say anything about glitching shut up and just answer the damn question and lets all have a wonderful day and night in appalachia in peace
---
Lol has not been my experience. There's usually only one build team and if not, I create it and it gets full fast
---
In what way? Every time I joined one, either there were a few guys with godly weapons taking every kill OR nobody would do anything properly and it'd fail since its hard to carry entire events. All for what? The possibility of getting some super rare hideous outfit and a couple of caps? 
---
No thanks.
---
Scrap box stays but you can't put stuff in, only take stuff out
---
I don't know if Carnivore negates the bonus, but Herbivore does double it.
---
You can have a card shared all the time. It just doesn’t do anything while solo.
---
Eh I don't know about that, when I was starting and claimed the ammo workshop, a high level instantly showed up and one shot my ass
---
I had this same problem, to where I almost rebuilt my entire camp trying to replace a single staircase. If the stairs are going upwards from a foundation, they’re fine. If your stairs are attached to a foundation at the TOP of the stairs aiming “downward”, it wants another foundation at the bottom.
---
You ran into the latter before the former. RNG I guess.
---
Level 14. I've done some grinding. I'm thinking I'm about at the planned point for today, I just dont  know if I can trust the plan.
---
Yeah, just figured that out. The person didn't state that.
---
At the rate they fire Gamma Guns, I'd say no. I've encountered two of these monsters in 1000+ hours, and it is like they have an irradiated minigun.
---
One showed up during a SBQ fight, and absolutely decimated everyone. Over and over. We ended up failing because we just couldn't stay alive enough to damage the Queen.
---
BTW, Scorched can walk over the body of another Scorched, and take their gun... they passed the Gamma gun around a few times before I managed to take it away from them.
---
https://gamerdvr.com/gamer/dielectric-flux/video/81971764
---
The sheep event is the only one I struggle to stay hidden. Otherwise every other even I do just fine.
---
Toxic Larry’s. Easy.
---
I did! I like a challenge and frankly this game doesn't have too many of them. So it was a pleasant surprise. Going to do it again soon at some point, but will go in a bit better prepared lol
---
Well, to be fair, if you could put items on shelves they’d cost camp budget per item anyway, just like displays 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Fr though who unironicly play nw over survival
---
I think you could drop class freak. If you are worried about starving from speed demon take carnivore and just make sure you loot all the meats you can carry. I use to use class freak then I realized I probably could use those points for a little extra resistance. Maybe trade it for barbarian. If you’re using radicool and unyielding it’s gives you quite a boost.
---
Sometimes I don’t get then right away but they end up coming in later just like call of duty has a late exp gain
---
Again, I am talking about the fear of other players.
---
I share Radicool, because I can only share lvl 1 cards.
---
But I can't tell if others already have this card equipped (and I'm pretty sure it doesn't stack with itself).
---
19
---
That's what I figured too, unfortunately for me I couldn't get a foundation under the pond lol.
---
I typically do Field Surgeon, is that commonly used?
---
I swear stealth is just broken during that event.
---
Like that but the complete opposite
---
That’s a good point. I appreciate that.
---
I like this plan! It would be great feedback on my camp/prices. If I get lots of salt and fertilizer, I'll know I suck! lol
---
Jokes aside, it would be nice to be able to leave notes for people. I've been hoping that they could do something with that useless personal terminal, but I like this idea much more!
---
And yet conveniently you leave out the part where they compensate you by giving you atoms based on how many ranks you've possibly lost from no S.C.O.R.E points
---
I've been hit with both, what irks me is that they've acknowledged it and we still have people pretending that there isn't an issue with SCORE not awarding for some people.
---
For #1 what happens is you actually get the SCORE reward for completing 3 out of the 5 tasks for a weekly challenge.  Then when you complete the other two, you get nothing.        
---
For #2 its being online when the daily challenges reset.  A lot of people, myself included, have been online during the reset.  What happens is, some of the challenges reset while others are still marked as completed.  These are unable to be completed and result in you losing SCORE.
---
110% broken. Sits next to queen and 12 scorched hidden...eye bots detect me in 10 seconds.
---
No probs. Other than that I’m a really similar build. Good stuff.
---
Ahh damn. I believe there’s a YouTube vid or two that shows how to put things under water. I’ve learned a lot of tricks on YouTube to camp building.
---
I always do 1 cap. But I haven't seen anyone under level 20 for a while
---
Everyone always comes in with this argument but often times everyone ignores the fact this game has changed a lot. Day 1 this game deserved all the hate it got. I mean the server could literally crash just by crafting ammo quickly. The first 3 nukes crashed the servers. The stash was 400. Quests didn’t work and were game breaking for a few people. There was slap damage and even that could be broken through easily meaning it was possible to be attacked and killed without ever engaging anyone. People who asked for a refund were immediately shut down, the first patches were about the size of the game itself, the game wasn’t (and still isn’t) balanced. 
---
There were dozens of dozens of reasons to be pissed. It has definitely improved but it’s still a series of 1 step forward, two back, two forward, halt. It’s better, it’s far more playable and more enjoyable, but it’s still a rather small game in a large map. To complete every quest in game would only take a week or two depending on how hard you play. The longevity comes in from the challenges or learning all the plans, etc. Yes, a year and a half later, this game isn’t as bad as you thought it would be, but that doesn’t mean it never was
---
You can tell members of your team that are sharing. They have a card next to their name. Go look at your cards and see how many are shared. If you are missing one, you and a team member are sharing the same card. So I unshare yours and share another.
---
But they didn't. 
---
The hell are you on about?
---
Yup lol sounds bout right.
---
How does this work anyway? Do you just meet up and open trade dialog to compare?
---
People have different playstyles. 
---
I camp and also go guns blazing. All depends on my loadout. If I have a handmade or submachine gun and a grenade launcher I will play aggressive as I know I'm good with those weapons. 
---
I won 20 games over the first 2 days as I was being a try hard to try get as much XP as I could (I wanted the Christmas/Halloween rewards and wanted to make sure I got them before they fixed them)
---
Only 3 out of thise 20 games did i camp until endgame. Its all about preference and I 100% understand people camping, just not people AFKing with the mindset of "its 3 less people for me to outlive and 1 less person for my team to kill". However that mindset isn't for AFKers. If you do actively play, even if its camping then I'm fine with it
---
No. Nobody else thinks this. It definitely hasn't been one of the biggest talking points around the SCORE system recently.
---
With Patch 20 they changed how Carnivore and Herbivore works. Before it only affected the hunger satify. Since the patch it affects all effects. Cranberry Relish normally gives +10% XP. With Herbivore it gives +20% XP and with Strange in Numbers it gives +25% XP. Same for brain fungus soup: normally it gives +2 INT, with Herbivore +4 INT and with Herbivore and Strange in Numbers +5 INT. But with Herbivore you don't get any benefits from meat anymore.
---
Cheers. I’ll play with it and see how it goes. I’m also working on a Berserkers build right now for another character.
---
Have you had any success game sharing FO76 in the past? Tried it when the game first launched with my brother and we would constantly get kicked out of servers, both while we were on the same network and on different networks. This was only ever a problem with 76 and no other online games that were game-shared. Eventually just ended up buying a second copy and haven't had any abnormal problems since. The game is so cheap now, it will only set you back a couple bucks. It's also coming to Game Pass next week, if you have it.
---
I'm still waiting on the inventor's laser gun pain!
---
Rrelease a skin or item  without a timer doesn't seem to be pulling peoples pockets? Put a 2 day timer on it and claim its leaving soon then keep it out for 3 months bring it back with another timer but this time for 13 days slap on a 10% discount and watch the money roll 😉
---
I noticed one of my challenges auto completed today, but the Score bar came up and showed an increase.
---
As long as it’s not 99 mini nukes!
---
There are a lot like there. Some in the community have spelled out exactly what the problem is and all the steps required to change it and Bethesda still refuses to fix some of these changes.
---
Some do but they can often take a lot long than the maybe day at most fixing the bug and testing it.
---
This totally reminds me of the whale that dropped $140k+ on the transformers mobile game.
---
I mean thats enough to buy a house in some places, a pretty nice sports car or...
---
The worlds most epic gaming room with top of the line everything and still have 100k for snacks, g fuel, and every game you could want for the next decade.
---
Scares me how many people dont truely understand the horror that is compound interest.

People like that are assholes but the real loot from Encryptid comes from the event completion itself, not the impostor's body. All it probably had was a nocturnal rolling pin.

I can give you a blueprint if your on Xbox, although it still has to be pretty flat
---
It wasn't so much a problem of getting it under the water. You can't take it out of the water once it's under. As far as I know.
---
Cannibal lvl 3. M'y friends absolutely hate it, but it's worth it.
---
the main rewards are from just being in the area when the quest completes 
---
I've never gotten anything good from looting the actual imposter sheepsquatch that I couldn't get by killing a random windigo or somegning
---
dick move still, but hey at least you didn't fail the quest, that sucks alot more
---
It wasn't me LOL
---
Keep your filthy capitalist hands off my blood packs! /s
---
I want to do encryptid with that guy..
---
It would still be the same technique....unless you're wanting to float it
---
Lol yeah the loot may be trash but I love the encrypted event
---
First world problems
---
Bethesda might not even need to go so far as give us a bunch of clutter decorations, they could just make cluttered versions of the furniture we already have.
---
Ain’t no money in free
---
Free cosmetics
---
Has anyone asked or addressed the issue where it’s impossible to do all the tasks (even NW ones) and be able to earn enough points to finish the entire board?
---
10 weeks.
---
10 levels a week average needed.
---
Doing Weekly missions should get you 5 levels minimum, more likely to be able to do all weekly and a day's worth of missions on one good session, so mabye level 7 times in one day, and putting a bit of effort into doing event teaming to boost your  s.c.o.r.e you should be at least level 9 by the end of a weekend. I haven't had a lot of time playing, but have pulled up on level 12 already, so ahead if where I need to he.
---
So grab that Egg Head mutation! 
---
Take it from me, totally not a seller of Egg Head serum.
---
oh you can blueprint it? neat
---
maybe ill find a workshop and build a base to place at my camp later
---
I didn't even think about that haha
---
Nonetheless, my answer is exactly the same. There's nothing else to be done about it but wait for a fix and hope for compensation/complain if there isn't. People have already been posting about the problem.
---
The whole system isn’t very intuitive. The players who are masters at building have been playing with every trick they can for so many hours that it’s become easy for them.
---
There is no off season. Once season 1 ends season 2 starts right away
---
You better have pocket sand ready for the elite team of Todd coming for you.
---
Rank 15 - only 24 more to go until I get my plushie!
---
Suggestion: keep 50 of each material except the important ones, like lead, steel, and wood. Keep 100 of them.
---
No I know but they’re empty is what I meant
---
You get treasury notes, that you swap for the bullion at foundation/crater in a gold machine for the bullion. Max 200 a day, because you can have fun, but not too much.
---
Thats all well and good for next time, but I still can't get back into the game. :(
---
You get 500 atoms from hitting level 100. Of course, that requires hitting level 100.
---
unlevel terrain causes the foundation to not be able to be placed at the same level as I rotate it though :((
---
uh oh triggered ..
---
if you want to play a game at the expense of others then I want to post at the expense of others
---
my guess would be nothing..
---
if they give atoms people will remember how much better it is to just get paid to buy what you want rather than accepting what they give you..
---
i just got one from roses terminal and based on the other replies I would guess the new holotapes aren't the same as the old ones...
---
It’ll be hard to blueprint the whole base but what I’ve got is pretty much the starting circle foundation. If you manage to get that down you can do almost anything from there.
---
They even do it to us Fallout 1st aristocrats. I had a weird ass glitch that deleted the entirety of the contents in my scrapbox. After two months of pushing them and pushing them I finally got about 1/20 of the stuff I lost.
---
Thats awfull =/
---
it prints out all the complaints right into the shredder
---
They've previously established that they plan to have ["a few"](https://fallout.bethesda.net/ko/article/fPSas0ftnlgD0FcZNnMoL/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-introducing-the-2020-roadmap-and-76-seasons) weeks' break between seasons.
---
By buying it with real money, obviously. 😒
---
What i do is use the regular stair case for inside not the one with a platform.that thing is a mess to deal with.plus it takes up too much space.then use the flooring to make a loft area with the gable end pieces and half walls, you can make it high enough to add stuff up there.lol the same thing that happened to you happened to my girls camp.
---
Please could I revive you for the tadpole badge?
---
You sure about that?  This "daily already done and no credit" issue has existed for a very long time (Nuclear Winter has had this issue for months.  Example:  Take 6 photos in Vault, but it's already completed from the last time you did it even though that may have been weeks ago).  I havent played NW since the patch and I've had a couple greyed out dailies that I had not done.
---
Theres double xp weekends and double daily weekends coming that will help make it up. If you miss NW then it just needs a couple extra rounds of the repeatable to make up for it which honestly isnt too hard to achieve if you make use of the public team system and the buffs to xp you can get from there
---
that's exactly what clicked into my brain haha
---
I'll give it a try! again thanks alot!
---
OR people who don't buy into this shit can instead buy a respec for atoms .. either or this game needs a respec option
---
remember the whole intention of an in game store .. SOME people spend money(whales) and SOME don't .. if you require everyone one to buy a sub .. and buy from the store and buy upgrades .. then you're going to have to offer higher quality software and hire a larger support staff or you're gonna go bankrupt
---
ya numbers would be nice. in camp budget as well
---
and 76 is the most difficult vats to use since it doesnt stop or slow time
---
Yes PSN is VeltScroll. Send me a FR.
---
Something for my watch list, then.
---
I keep getting stuck on Events teams. Every time I change it to Building for broad XP boost, everybody leaves. I'm barely seeing any other kind of teams, too.
---
Troubleshooters gatling :)
---
haven’t done a silo with it yet, but it did a good job at Robco :)
---
You can also buy 300 a week from Smiley. Hes upstairs at the wayward
---
Yes! You can take screenshots of all the ones that aren't known and keep a list. It's by far the easiest way to determine which plans you're missing.
---
I do the same thing. In 2 hours time I can do 3-4 rounds of WS and kill over 30 legendaries and collect around 50-60 HRF.
---
im just wondering if the 500 i got from the quest counts as my daily limit since no events are giving me any
---
look i want to believe you guys but can anybody provide a source?
---
And ineffective. Plenty of known cheaters in Nuclear Winter are still there.
---
Wrong. You get exactly 2000 if you finish. Level 100 gives you 500 atoms
---
No, so you have to go to the vending machine at either the foundation or the crater, there you can cash in treasury notes for bullion
---
Yes and the lady reward from this season is another stein
---
No worries. Sometimes there are bots that downvote everyone in a post too, but I'm sure occasionally someone who sells a rare item for a small fortune wouldn't want others to know how to get it. Though the information is on Google so it's not exactly a secret or anything. 
---
By the way, if you're after the outfits, be prepared for a long grind or to trade some valuable stuff. They're among the rarest outfits in the game and their value is generally considered to be more than the maximum caps a player can hold, so they're generally trade-only and not sold for caps.
---
True. I built a round structure over water once (couldnt use Jugs method), it's a PITA but possible. The foundations that you're not able to rotate, set one up where you can get the height, then build roofs/stairs/wall combo to bring you over to where you need to be.
---
Make sense? If you're ps4 I can lend a hand
---
That's what I hate about the mode... it's really fun when a specific group of my friends is online and I can play with a good team consistently.. but that barely ever happens. I wish they would just add some other pvp modes like faction deathmatch or ctf (capture the jangles the moon monkey? 😁) those modes have been time tested in so many other online games...
---
dont feel bad - you are way ahead of me :)
---
holy shit omg, yes please this should NOT be the case
---
ahh gotcha, no dailies have given me any yet, but ill keep an eye out for the notes
---
Any event with the exclamation point will give you treasury notes as well as the dailies that you can do for the crater and the foundation. None of the regular dailies give you notes
---
Honestly, I quite like the rewards available through Seasons. It's the grind that's shit.
---
Ouch. Yeah, it's exceptionally rare. Like in the top tier of rare outfits. Generally assumed to be worth more than max caps so people trade some pretty incredible stuff for it.
---
Whenever I run encrypted I tank all 3 pylons and then one-clip it with my JE laser. I don’t care if other players get hits or not. 💁‍♀️
---
Thanks for the heads up! :)
---
your lack of self awareness is humorous
---
Triggered. 😂 I find it funny that your kind considers anything more than 5 words long, "triggered".
---
Hell, post away. I won't be offended by anything you say. You're entitled to say it weather it be positive or negative.
---
Might as well go all the way at that point
---
The xp you get should at LEAST count toward the repeatable
---
I take all the pylons - but I fight her the old fashioned way, without the gimmicks...and she's still dead and I have 21 Fixer Plans.
---
ah thats the part i couldnt find anywhere, the exclamation point dailies. that helps a lot thank you
---
how would you be playing the game otherwise.. I mean in regards to avoiding "the grind" ?
---
Np dude
---
Aight, so, what's MEANT to happen is you do this:
---
1. Choose to convert
---
2. Choose ammo
---
3. Go to main menu
---
4. Repeat
---
However, what you did - much like I have done before - is this:
---
3. Press O to go back to prev screen
---
4. Choose ammo
---
5. Repeated steps 3 and 4
---
This basically puts you into a loop that will last for as many presses of O to return to the main screen as you have made pressing O to convert more ammo.
---
Just keep hammering O and you will eventually go back to the main menu.
---
Bethesda. It just works.
---
17, gonna push for 18 maybe 19 tonight
---
They should give us a score for that but it would probably be very little per match
---
Also I get 200 to 500 adventure mode XP per a match
---
So if I play 20 40 matches I will get 100 score
---
The only daily qeusts that will give you treasury notes are the ones from Davenport, Rocksy, Wren, and Ward. Davenport gives the photo opportunity and is at the Overseer's home. Rocksy and Wren are both at The Crater and switch off days. Ward is at Foundation. 
---
Other than that the only way to fram Treasury notes is to do the public events that have the ! on them.
---
It happened to me the second day.then next day after completing a minor challenge it gave me the 1000.
---
can someone confirm this to me, I'm level 13 as I see on the progression bar but on the rewards screen if I count the little square from the beginin (counting the first one) I will be at lvl 12 so the question is the lvl on the progress bar show my actual level or the next level I will be?
---
Yeah this drives me bananas
---
Gun fu or escape artist both run at level 1 for me too so I share those.
---
I think it should have been called something else. I dont even understand why they made teams based on building as a theme when you literally cant build together as a team. The name is misleading and people arent making the connection between the int buff and increase in xp, which isnt really explained well either.
---
Left is what you are. Right is what you are working towards
---
what platform?
---
 have soloed him 3 times. could never solo the sbq
---
This is going to quickly become one of the better events when One Wasteland drops if the wolves start scaling to your level.
---
so why I'm lvl 12 on the board, im 1 lvl behind on where I should be.
---
19, going to be 20 tonight! The grind never changes.
---
I still don't see what the big deal is with seasons the.legendary board game thing is. I'm not sure I even understand it all.
---
Is it just so you can.get rewards like skins and paint jobs? Maybe a few camp items? Seems like much ado about nothing. I haven't gotten much from the atom store just a few outfits and some camp items. But really wjo cares about all that stuff. Mostly nobody sees it.
---
All I ever wanted was more content. My guess is this ia just some way to keep people playing the game.
---
I don't know
---
I wish I knew this before! I think the only option is to uninstall the game and re-download. Which I hope doesn't delete my character. 
---
Somehow whatever was going on with the game- when I closed it, it broke. I have not been able to sign in without crashing for hours :(
---
NO! Absolutely do NOT!  If events in adventure mode isn't going to award score PLEASE dont make me play that garbage mode... dont get me wrong. Every once and a while it can be fun when a specific group of my friends is online and we can play consistently as a team. But random teammates barely ever stick together as a team.  NW has taught me that I really dont care for battle royales one bit...
---
The Terminal could have an actual use instead of just telling me when I can make alcohol again.
---
They did add some extra life time challenges most are kill 76 of do and so creature. 40 atoms per completeion.
---
A little something there
---
I know you know what I don't know @_@, joking aside I will never be able to finish this then.
---
The non glitch method to launch a nuke is a major pain in the ass... (now I can glitch it in about 8.5 minutes) didn’t do mine until prob 20-30 levels ago, currently 190 something... I farm too much. I run the mire brotherhood fire bases for high level enemies and junk, hit the fissure sites for those batty bastards and ultra ore... I mostly farm legendaries and haven’t completed wastelanders yet.
---
I mean I think either the amount of SCORE needed or the ways SCORE is given is too restrictive and requires too much grinding for XP, Nuclear Winter, legendaries, etc. I already missed the first day for real life, so I'm far behind. MMORPGs generally ask you for a bit of a grind regardless, and I'm already more tolerant than many, but imo this is far too much.
---
If this is a "Fallout 76 is 100% a grind of a game anyways" gotcha-style question, then admittedly the game in general probably isn't for you.
---
Theres a bug that currently awards you the score before you actually finish the challenge. ie it'll reward you at 3/5 instead of 5/5. Lots of posts and videos have confirmed this. Have also personally had it happen. 
---
Not saying that's what happened to you, but there's a chance it did and you maybe didn't notice it pop up.
---
I level a toon to 50 before I do much more than brush up against main questlines..
---
I run a few different loops around locations depending on if I am needing materials, or just xp
---
I always try to do any events that arent a drag to be in (im looking at you project paradise)..
---
I'll keep an eye out during my travels! Also thanks for the awesome work! Would I be able to visit the mule even though it's not complete yet?
---
I think those are my points you've got there...
---
You don’t like it. I don’t like it. We both know it’ll sell for a small fortune.
---
Crouch in a bush....
---
ok.. but that didnt really answer my question
---
I went on and play the match anyway. With the colors of Fo1st on my wood armor so everyone on the map could see me.
---
i read it twice, and i'm still not sure what you meant. 
---
76's launch was forced by Zenimax, and wasn't ready. It also launched by a studio that dind't know wtf they were doing. 76 at launch was not a fallout game. PVP has no place in a fallout game. 
---
Wastelanders is what 76 should have been at launch, and is a good starting point to work on. While I maintain that Todd's just a figurehead and Zenimax calls the shots, WL is what I want (minus the bullion grind and gear RNG), so while I'm not thrilled you're unhappy I'm thrilled pvp is leaving slowly every update.
---
That's because you did a really bad job phrasing your question and I wasn't actually sure what you meant.
---
I finally found one at South Cutthroat Camp that worked.
---
AFK while you sleep
---
Yeah I'll help you out dude
---
I know the answer already anyway.. its ok
---
Whats up brotha I’ll add you what ur tag
---
Trailer park east of the water park has holotapes that I used to complete it today
---
Ix Stoney xI can you give me 5 minutes? Need a quick bathroom break, send me the invite though and I'll join as soon as I can. My camp is near site bravo anyway
---
any luck?
---
Ah, so you're a smug jackass. Gotcha.
---
I have enjoyed my time in the game, but generally don't like playing it often now.  To me it is boring and just about redoing the dailies or trying to find something new.
---
I do have something like 490hrs of game time though.  I think the main quest and a lot of the side quests are great.  Once those are over the fun is greatly diminished.  However, even at 100hrs of game play this is a great game and worth the entry fee.
---
This game gets a bit more hate then it deserves, but at the same time a lot of the feedback to help improve it is seemingly ignored and all of the instances of the game crashing are annoying.  
---
Am I personally over the game?  Pretty much.  Is it a bad game? No.
---
that isnt very civil..
---
If you were in a team I believe you don't have to tag the legendary to get loot anymore.
---
I personally don’t like the game mode either but I’d be more inclined to play it if It was at least contributing to the legendary run.
---
Don’t sit out any of the NW challenges. It’s a fun and rewarding game mode when you learn how to play it. 
---
It’s a video game, enjoy it for what it is.
---
It did it to me too. Logged out at 1 pm est and when I logged back in an hour later, everything but NW was done.
---
Agreed, why should I play NW when I can play adventure and work on the legends run?
---
I'm addicted to CAMPS. I build an epic base, then have a other brainwave and tear it down.... Then another.... Tear that down.... My wife's got an interior architecture degree so she's getting called in every five seconds lol Other than that, yeah stride across the map doing events and dailies.
---
I've recently started a personal quest to create a holotape archive of my favourite factions etc. I love the lore and history of the WV fallout.
---
I get so much value from my $12 Black Friday pick up!!!
---
True facts dude
---
It’s a trade off...you can get all those same rewards that put in the shop on the board...and it’s now free.  I’m really surprised that so many people on here complain about free stuff.
---
If they are missing completely (as apposed to visible but ticked off) I had it yesterday and relogging in sorted it. 
---
Do not do any challenges before the gold star one is visible, otherwise they won't count and when it comes back it won't be possible.
---
I don’t think it transfers over
---
You can get repeatable SCORE in Adventure Mode by getting exp so it would make sense if you could get SCORE from exp in Nuclear Winter.
---
Doo dooo do dooo do
---
No, you didn't. Thanks. Good job. But when I did try to genuinely answer what I found to be a poorly-phrased question, you just made snide side-comments instead of explaining what you meant or something more civil in return.
---
Are you asking what I'd be doing in the game without the SCORE incentives? Are you insinuating the dailies are the only reason people play the game anymore? Because there'd be better ways to phrase that.
---
most of the atom shop stuff will be back if it sold well originally..
---
Your gunna make an ass out of yourself assuming
---
I’m doing the seasons thing on a new character and it’s a lot more enjoyable imo
---
Granted the state of the world in 76 it's more like the WVSS
---
No because there are 100s of cheaters already done with it
---
And this is the exact reason why people hate Bethesda. Not for this issue specifically, but for the underlying avarice that spawned it.
---
I have been pricing my plans at 25 caps, with only certain rare plans at anything higher but nothing above 150 (I think, it's been a while since I cleaned out my vendors and restarted).  
---
I have so many mounted head plans and prime weapon plans...I just want them gone, I don't want to drop them, but I'm tired of looking at them!
---
Well the XP glitch equals fast leveling through the season so that’s probably what it was
---
I believe Level 14. Did all my dailies today and finished the last of the weeklies yesterday. I couldn't tell you how many times I have done the Repeatable. I'd say maybe 8 times? 
---
Definitely under 10...I think. The one I am currently looking forward to the most is Level 19 for the stars wallpaper. That thing is gonna look so sick in my camp.
---
I feel like I'm behind actually, especially seeing your Level 17. Can't imagine why you'd feel behind, what kind of numbers are you seeing others say they got?
---
You can glitch any item into any display currently.  Its certainly not perfect but can produce some nice results. Really hope they dont fix this one, since it doesnt seem to actually cause any issues.
---
https://imgur.com/a/RktoQh0
---
At this point, people have no one to blame but themselves. 
---
Most players refused to demand better, so... this is what you get.
---
Man I love doing Mama Dolche's for the 100000000th time for extra XP stew...
---
I'm not making assumptions. I am just putting myself in their shoes. What would be my strategy for making more money in this scenario. This is precisely what I would do.
---
Should I do it solo so I don't disappoint my teammates
---
Not sure why they 3 doors to get through via the service entry.
---
Got you sent you a request
---
No, it need to be nerfed because it's over powered, I also said Junkies should too. I said a lot of the scardy cats bloodied players are changing their builds to junkies. You know.. Because it has the second highest DPS and people (like you did) get board hiding. I'm also going to add that not every bloodied player does that, though it doesn't actually need to be stated.
---
Literally every time someone mentions them. People like you come out out of the woodworks to explain how their wrong based only on themselves. Its like playing bloodied means you cant notice other player or something when it comes to pointing them out. That get annoying.
---
My guy people got to rank 100 the first day thanks to an XP glitch lol
---
Saw there was a new guy near Vault 76, level 1, heading there anyway, so I made a level 1 pipe gun and dropped it with about 240 rounds of ammo, he was already gone, just left it there figuring someone would get it.
---
seemed like a pretty straight forward question to me..
---
youre inability to answer it without directing undeserved rage toward me is kind of baffling..
---
clearly you understand the question.. but it seems to me you dont like what your own answer to it will be..
---
that isnt my fault and I do not deserve derision for asking a simple legitimate question..
---
Easy peasy. Haven’t played NW since it launched. I’m still sitting at level 4 with 160 unopened perk cards.
---
They probably have a target % in mind (using maths).  If they make it too hard, people won't do it at all because its not attainable.
---
Their making money off the season's? Source.
---
Weird, I got this one as soon as I logged in for the first time this morning. Try storing one and bringing it back out?
---
How much do you charge for shielded casual underarmour? One of the plans I never managed to get and desperately need. Lol
---
Yup, but if they make it too easy, they will increase the difficulty next time.
---
Joining your world now dude, which site you at?
---
I just grabbed one of the survivor's stories tapes in Flatwoods. Delbert in the trailer south of the church is probably the easiest to find.
---
Fo76 maps the app works for me. Looks like a silver unnumbered vault door.
---
You can disable all locations and include only the types you want.
---
Reasonable argument, when considering Beth's whole heavy monetization thing. This one seems relatively easy to me, but I am crazy full time. I want it to be hard enough to be an accomplishment, honestly. That level of difficulty would mean a lot of the more casual or part time players wouldn't be able to earn everything. To me that is the whole point of this type of season pass. Beth will do what Beth will do...
---
Amateur. I can’t even take all of the junk out of mine. It weighs upwards of 15,000lbs
---
Downstairs at the end of the tunnel on top of a barrel at The Rusty Pick. Called "Your Order Has Arrived"
---
In the level 3 locked floor safe behind the table near Smiley at The Wayward.
---
Two in common places visited by most people, anyway.
---
PLEASE do it solo. I get so irrationally pissed off when my teammates just AFK in a bush the entire match
---
Meanwhile I did it yesterday, DID get damage on them and didn't get loot lol. Guess you got the loot I was supposed to get.
---
On a new public team? You're able to loot most things your team kills, provided your proximity to them is close/ish.
---
just play the game and try to last as long as you can..
---
Damn that’s a bummer, kind of makes me not want to bother getting into it.
---
I put almost all my plans at 10% of face value.  They sell quickly.  Hell, I'm max caps all the time and I remember when we couldn't sell plans and the first thing we did when meeting new players was to drop duplicate plans.
---
I shake my head when I see player vendors trying to sell common plans at face value.
---
I’m at my camp fixing my suit cause I got whooped. Lol joking my team in in the public teams
---
Yeah I always feel bad when I'm the last one alive on my team and everyone else is spectating
---
if you were on PC.. Id say the only way to play would be to hug a bush.. cheaters ya know..
---
on consoles Id just play like any other BR.. try and live as long as you can
---
Watoga has a bunch, the story of a girl falling in love with an artist, and her mom is like "but he Hippie"
---
There's a third where challenges are missing completely, as in not listed at all. So instead of having 7 (with possibly some ticked off) there will only be 4. 
---
It fixes itself on relogging in, but, if you conplete any challenges while the Gold Star is not visible, it won't count for that even when it comes back. So the score for that would be unobtainable as there wouldn't be 5 to complete.
---
Test it yourself. Go to Camden Park when two or three dailies are available. Do one or two, then take a berry mentat before you do the third.
---
isnt monster mash a PVP event?
---
I still have mine but the sound effect changed to the Tricentennial Salute sound, which I don't like
---
No worries dude, we should be able to rattle through it fairly fast, you going after the queen?
---
Depends what the most expensive thing you’re listing is. 
---
I usually crap out about 20k and go looking at vendors/buy a serum recipe I haven’t got yet.
---
I’ve only been caught out once, some whale visited my base and literally bought me out from 13k. I was in the process of entering whitespring bunker (fuck being able to travel inside there right) and he bought my fixer plan for 12k when he’d already put me to 23k so I lost about 4k caps sadly.
---
Brotherhood kind of made that their whole deal. So, not just Communists. Lol
---
Thats because we started at level 1. So the first square you're counting is level 2.
---
fuck em.. I say
---
thats what the mute button is for
---
Yeah I'm levelling an alt now and got to Roses quests at top of the world. Not going any further until I have my mutations and addictions. Not going near that fucking Wendigo cave until I'm level 50 for my good stored weapons lol. Got wrecked in there by the Mirelurk kings first time I did that quest.
---
Yeah it is. It's not a test of strength it's supposed to be a fun few minutes of capture the flag-ish combat. Where your main prize is candy. Are people so hateful towards all forms of pvp.
---
Might help if you stated what you're looking for a hand with.
---
And the vault system.
---
The game in general
---
Had this earlier but fast travel is no longer free ☹️
---
Ill take reasons why bloodied build needs to be nerfed for 200
---
I have one serum recipe left, then it's on to the camp plans and Power Armor plans in the Whitesprings Resort and the Enclave Bunker
---
Did eventually after the first volley of messages. Already confirmed that 2/5 received a communication ban for the content of the messages.
---
Blank paper we could type out notes on would be amazing. Granted they would have to ban lots of words so people couldn't be abusive with it
---
I’ll craft you one for free if you like. No offense to the guy selling them :)
---
Drifter outfit and eyeball helmet since about level 20. Love that outfit
---
sure enough, its in my build menu now.
---
PA tank or something else? Been considering making myself a bit more tanky than just my X01.
---
Wasn't running bloodied at the time
---
A reasonable leap in logic, each level of the season will takes 150 atoms to complete, so working on Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) is the hope to get people to spend cash on atoms.
---
First time through, didn't realize reddit was the manual. It took me maybe 5weeks to crawl through the original main quest, but I played it alone like it was fo4. Now I maintain my stable of 5 characters, do all the endgame stuff with a group of friends, tear down and build one of the five camps every month or so, and come up with new goofy things to do or do to people or take pics of.
---
yeah I hear that.. thats where my current newest toon is stuck at the moment..
---
breezed right through there 3 times already and this toon just cant do it..
---
also doesnt help that the wendigo is stuck in the roof..
---
This is dope! Im already at rank 15 but hopefully with double dailies, i can end up reaching Zorbo even faster!
---
Yikes. That doesn’t make any sense. It’s a PvP event. I know it’s uncomfortable because there aren’t many of those but it’s all fair play IMO as long as no one is cheating.
---
Jesus fucking christ ditch the score system and let us get points just by playing i mean literally every other game with a pass system does that why the hell not this
---
Dude I’m the furthest thing from melee (shotgun,rifleman) but a pretty decent cattle prod with improved swing speed is at this point a much more reliable tool for killing enemies that are below level 20, in my experience.
---
Opened my first three at very crowded SBQs, but I'm saving the second three for 2x XP!
---
I heard it was a thing that happened.
---
I picked up Herd Mentality today for this very reason.
---
Funfact because of all the bloodied build assholes running around 1 shoting legendaries it makes it impossible to get a hit on anything not a scorchbeast
---
Adrenaline is bugged at the minute, so until they fix that you're wasting 5 points in AGI.
---
Yea same I'm hoping to push to 17 tonight on just repeatable. I'm nervous to do the NW challenge bc I hear it can cause you challenges to autocomplete ruining your score...idk if it's true but idk to find out
---
What is the different between score and points?
---
Most of it is just garbage camp items anyway. I have no desire to pay attention to this battle pass junk. Pretty much everyone that still plays this game seems to only care about building cute little camps. It keeps them distracted from the fact that there is literally nothing to do after level 50.
---
Honestly if they didn't add an achievement to WIN wouldn't even bother going but we had a reason to be there and got attacked first. It seems from this slice of experience the community is expected to check if someone is there and wait until the next one if someone is.
---
I’m also on this list of being robbed of score lol when it’s 5 people sure it can be missed but half of the community that’s on reddit are experiencing this exact same thing, including god knows how many that aren’t connected through reddit. It’s a pretty big problem and they should of made a quick fix within the first day or two. It’s astounding how long it’s been going for now and no sign of a fix lol
---
Today I got killed by a guy wearing the ghillie suit and became #2. He popped up in front of me but didn’t see me, I just stood there appreciating the suit and forgot what i was doing, until he finally turned around and shot me lol
---
Monster Mash is one of the few dedicated PVP events/areas left in the game. You cannot be faulted for participating as intended. I personally dislike PVP but if I was in Monster Mash, you bet I’d either participate or just leave. It’s not the deep. You’re not in the wrong; they’re just bitter because they wanted to skate through the event and ended up getting bested by someone with better gear/strats/whatever. Hit them with a “git gud” and let them seethe.
---
I share stuff that removes rads to mess with my bloody build friends
---
Y'all are assuming a lot from a company who locks lemurs in a room to code their games
---
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
---
I've completed 2 weekly challenges since last night that i havent recieved the 2,000 s.c.o.r.e. for. I should have gone up 2 levels.
---
Were you on a team?
---
What reasons?
---
I just gave a Thumbs up and a GG but damn did that open the flood gates.
---
Yea, all of the holiday items are unlockable in NW right now. I just started too but just wanted the ghillie suit.
---
You know what i fucking mean especially if youve played literally any game with a pass system
---
Ie lets say xp = points
---
You finish a event 400 points
---
Make sure to turn off team fill if you're gona bush it :)
---
Why isn't anyone talking about Adrenal reaction &amp; adrenaline not working lol Hellooo bloodied...?
---
I was refering to the other guy
---
I’m hoarding too many guns. I can’t figure out what heavy gun to use (I’m usually lever rifle or shotgun while questing). So I’ve got gatlings, plasmas, teslas, .50s, etc. I should just scrap most of them or sell them but I don’t think anyone would buy them since they’re not bloodied.
---
Yeah I already knew resistant so all i had to get was shielded
---
Sucks it’s not easier to make blueprints of large buildings and things inside them. I’d move my camp constantly.
---
Some. Not a lot. Twitch prime for sure. Unclear about seasonal stuff since they’ve only really had holiday events one time. 
---
Atom shop stuff rotates.
---
Course not because until they finally give that perk a god damn cap its going to continue to exist
---
You can still do this; you just need to find a group that wants to.
---
I just want the secret service gillie armor paint
---
Hahaha thats hilarious my dude do you know how much it costs to repair some things?  It aint cheap
---
I had that a few days ago.
---
Don't get me wrong I normally do the wife accidentally shared Rad Sponge earlier and soaked up some of my rads getting slapped by ghouls. I personally was half bloodied. The other guy was in Chinese stealth. Normally decent but in the tight hectic corridors of Watoga. Bad move.
---
Eh I wouldn’t let it dissuade you. It’s a PvP event.
---
Funnily enough i hit 28k caps today and rushed to buy a recipe and.. i'd already bought them all. 
---
OH NOES! I quickly switched to my private server and went and splurged 15k on plans from the vendor at the fairground. I'm gonna start vendor hopping and buy up all the junk i can find (and any bargains) so i can make use of my fallout 1st box before i cancel it. I have so much shit for sale in my vendors though. Nothing for more than 6k. Well except for Talons recipe as i bought it on my alt and forgot to send it over. 
---
Even though i don't use PA i may buy up all the plans. Or buy all gun mods and armour mods.
---
I've got a good sniping spot in Morgantown that no one else ever seems to use or check. 8/10 times I can just sit up for the majority of the match and pick people off and not get found. Generally rakes in a lot of xp
---
Wait theres a actual limit to over weighing your inv? Jesus ive never had this happen before
---
Honestly there's not been anything in the atom store I've wanted to buy in months anyway.
---
Yeah, I feel you. But you can kinda understand it when you move your camp and have the game almost brick upon scrapping one of the blueprints.
---
Honestly, I saw a few posts a while ago about people creating small modular 2x2 camps so that can blueprint and move it constantly. Basically a Large Tent with all the crafting benches in it. Seems fun.
---
Don't forget to turn off team fill
---
Big question is will it bug out tomorrow's challenges?
---
Well people like me will keep it balanced after it becomes possible to buy levels. I plan on purchasing every level I dont have after the first 14 days. Then my season will be over and I dont have to worry about keeping up with daily and weekly stuff.
---
Makes sense. I need to get fixer plans. I don’t ever see the event when I’m playing though. Didn’t know players could even sell them.
---
IMO, It shouldn’t be easy. It should be difficult but not impossible. That way the rewards are earned instead of just being handed over to you. That way you can spot the people who put in the effort to get the higher rewards. I do realize some people have already glitched through the entire season. Bethesda needs to get on that. 
---
We are less than a week into it. Why don’t we wait to see how this season plays out before saying a change is needed.
---
I actually don’t know what you mean which is why I asked the question. I’ve never played a game with a season before. I am not a fan of the concept. No need to be rude....
---
All of the Halloween and Christmas challenges have somehow been reactivated following Patch 20, and as such all the rewards are up for grabs too. You just can't actually see the challenge itself. Given Bethesda's slow response time, take the time to get all the unlocks if you want!
---
Rewards from Nuclear Winter are gone for good if you didn’t get them in time?
---
I'm fine with it it's just a sorry state if participating in a part of the game as intended draws so much hate.
---
Junk, always. I buy leads, steels, acids because I got the scrapbox and these stuffs are most common materials what people need. These thing just like caps.
---
I grinder NW.. shouldn’t feel bad, our ghillie suit is still unique, and we finally have a ghillie backpack to go with it
---
I’d love to have a massage. ☺️
---
Don't need to be Bloodied to one shot things!! PS we're not all assholes
---
I bought shielded on a different character, but was surprised to find these two with different linings that I'd never buy as you can just buy shielded first.
---
The only work around is to log off the game and stop playing for the moment of the daily challenge reset, because when I lost my daily score on the second day, the support staff just instantly locked my ticket and stated that they couldn't credit missing score!
---
You buy them from NPCs?  Hard finding players with lead and acid for sale
---
Tell me about it, I got the power armor edition.
---
Definitely happened
---
Love the food storage note ROFL.
---
On a side note, can all you folks dress the poor woman. Maybe the majority of people doing this are really 14 year olds, but ffs! Sick and tired of underwear space lady, and all other "sexy" incarnations.
---
I have two and do have issues with it. So, yeah. Don’t know what to tell you.
---
If you want cobalt nuke morgantown
---
I do this every weekend to farm XP's, legendaries, and High Radiation Fluids. The nuke will last for 2 hours so have everything ready before you drop the nuke. Launch the nuke and then fast travel to your camp. Heal up or fix armor and weapons. After the nuke hits, go to Whitesprings and run through the place, some of the enemies will spawn but most wont. Quit to the main menu (outside the nuke zone) and the back to private world. All enemies will respawn and then go to town and enjoy. When the radiation dies down, collect all the flux in the area.
---
I can do 3-4 rounds through the Whitesprings and average 2 levels (using XP boosts), 30+ Legendaries, and 50-60 HRF. If you want to have some fun, nuke it again after the 2 hours for more killing fun. After 2 nukes, quite private world for about 10 min so if you go back, its on a different server and the Legendaries will refresh with a new server.
---
Buy the encryptid assultron cards
---
I'll give you one. PSN VeltScroll. Send me FR.
