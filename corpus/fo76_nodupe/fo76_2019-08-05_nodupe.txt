Right?
---

---
They can't manage to program something that a bug has made clear is possible?
---
Are they actually this inept?
---
Christ.
---
---
---
Gears 5 made this move and it made me want to play it again. Its an amazing reward for dedicated players who will most likely encourage other players to join. More players equals more potential spending bethesda!!
---
I like the game but this BoS event is pretty much a bust.
---
It should be the Enclave, but aside from a few files in the game we haven't heard anything about them
---
  
---
Edit: really it should be everyone because the Brotherhood sure does like making enemies
---
Hey atleast buy be dinner first.
---
Yea I think Bethesda needs to be banned for duping on this one, I’ve noticed the same
---
Opened one just to make sure they were right about the drop table. After Vodka I stopped paying attention....guess ill keep my 70k in steel.  Can they not have 2 guys just go knock out weapon skins for a couple weeks.  Or put another stupid stuff animal in a backpack or a funny hat.  I don't get how clueless they are.  Spent all there really go ghille suit ideas so back to present loot drops.   Thanks for letting me rant on your post!
---
Not to mention the best items from the season are CAMP items.  Why fuck that up?
---
If I had to venture to guess I would say they have something planned, probably around the time of instansted camps, probably for atoms, that will implement things like double sided walls and such.
---
I just signed up for a year of 1st(last week) so I could test builds on a pvt server(captured workshop). I will be asking, no demanding, a refund and going to play non Bethesda games if they do not change this back. I'm tired of the only feature in the game I come back for being broken even further. I use to "move" every week and spend hours in game doing so, now I have no reason to.
---
The worst part is they not only didn’t fix the issue, but made it worse because now you can’t place a normal wall to then swap with a doorway wall...
---
The enclave should be the main opposing faction seen as the BOS are military defectors.
---
I was about to get fallout first again too. I won’t until I can build the way I like too. It’s the reason I play the game.
---
Yes I would love this, probably the only thing I'd pay real money for in case it supplys enough
---
It’s not real time. It gets updated once a day
---
haha thats why i love you
---
That would be awesome.
---
u/LadyDevann will players who have reached this milestone get atoms awarded retroactively?
---
And they actually missed a couple days last time over the weekend.
---
Too hard/long to program probably why many things are like this.
---
I'm gonna use it too, I thought it was just my laptop which is somewhat lower end with an A12 processor.
---
[removed]
---
Not normal at all. I've played other MMOs and always looked forward to the updates and patches. No game is perfect but I'm not sure Bethesda is even trying.\* 
---
\*Management, I mean. I still believe that the individual devs and designers could - and want to - do much better but mangement's policies and goals won't let them.
---
What system are u playing on?
---
Yep
---
Agree.
---
10 minutes? Damn I only have 2 minutes in the lobby. It’s never enough time to explore.
---
That's a good idea, it's like a lore friendly way of doing what SEO did. Maybe to make it balanced, you still have to connect wires to it but then it will remotely broadcast electricity
---
You're annoying.
---
If this is true, I'm done. They always fix things people dont ask to fix while ignoring bugs that make the game unplayable. I'm canceling my Fallout 1st and hope alot of people cancel too. The only thing I enjoyed was rebuilding my camp at different locations...... Truly the stupidest bug fix I've seen.
---
I am only doing it to piss them off.
---
They ended up giving us a Colossal Problem without giving us A Colossal Problem.
---
Honestly they should've given us the quest even buggy since now when it is finally released we'll find something to complain about after this update complaining dies down.
---
I honestly enjoy playing the game even though all my posts today sounds like I don't.
---
I wouldn't blame the CMs. They seem to be fed a lot of bullshit by the Dev team
---
Don’t think you understand how much creative camp building was predicated on this one thing. Cool non cube structures with polygon/round style walls structures (see Davy Jones lighthouse video)....no longer possible. Glitching objects into walls to make for nice built in look.... gone. Clean and easy transfer of power through walls... gone. Bunch of tricks with roofs not supported by 3 walls.....gone.
---
I never though it could get worse, and yet...
---
I do wish they would have added a 'max' exchange but as it stands they have catered for the mass scrappers but somehow made it even more messy for the smaller quantities such as the many 40mm and missiles that appear random in rewards.
---
How is it worse?
---
Before I gave up after 10 minutes trying to get rid of 3k+ .38 and 5k+ 10mm. Even getting to the point limit was unbearable... using this method.
---
Now, I got rid of 2,5k of shotgun shells, 3k of .38 , 4k of 10mm, 2k of .50cal in under 5 minutes, and with two more steps got all points redeemed for .45 ...
---
All in under 5 minutes. Would say ... 3?
---
The increased point limit and the 10x and 100x options are the real MVP.
---
This is clearly a cry for help.
---
I honestly feel this is true. Why plow the fields when you could just feed the chickens and wait to do the hard jobs later or slowly over time. This way it gets things “fixed” even if they aren’t necessary. But it’s easier and progress is progress, so why not
---
I mean, i guess you could try. The worst thing that could happen was them telling you no since it was technically an exploit.
---
Just have a friend join in for security, and use a weightless container if you don't trust them. Been doing that since the beginning
---
Time for me to uninstall
---
“Fixed an exploit allowing bows to fire much faster than intended”
---
Ya this isn’t fixed, just got wrecked in nuclear winter by someone using a full auto explosive bow  one Xbox One
---
If only i had friends that play
---
I am still upset about the Feed the People fix over a year ago.
---
Nope. This had to do with floating walls. Door to wall trick was how you could float a wall without a foundation and thus make round structures or barns over real land for farming.
---
Even so: I’ve bought stuff from the atom shop and didn’t have an issue with it because it was for my creative use.
---
What they need to do is ** ADD CONTENT and NOT GIMP CONTENT TO ARTIFICALLY EXTEND GAMEPLAY**
---
Unsubbed today. Gg fallout
---
There was someone in my discord a couple of days ago saying that they had over 6 million steel and they weren't donating at all.   Now, I'm not telling someone what they should and shouldn't donate. But that's a fuck ton of steel
---
So...no more interior walls, no more circular camps, no more walls being placed into prefabs, and no more running power conduits through walls. What the fuck is this shit, that's so restrictive.
---
I now have to open my inventory to see how much I have and do the math to use it.  I'm not big into calling for peoples jobs but a supervisor needs to get axed for this being a fix that took a month to roll out.
---
Was just checking myself. Dont see them....

Did you at first replaced another wall so that the last selected replacement can stay? I've added another little demo for double sided walls you may take a look at.
---
Previously placed items are fine, they just can't be restored!
---
Well then I guess it all kind of balances out then, doesn't it?
---
Luckily we have mega casuals which pay for FO1st and show Bethesda that what they're doing is right ;D
---
That's some hot garbage
---
For more than a year!
---
I have feelings.. but the builders will find a way to keep building awesome unique camps..  
---
As for bethesda... i hope they do hear the rage on this and take it constructivly. We need better build options. Stop giving me prefabs and give me half walls... not horizontal. Virtical! Give us stairs that dont sit in the centre of the floor... give us more things so we can make amazing camps and share across social media as free advertisment!
---
Thanks for this post, wish I found it before dropping 7500 steel
---
Thanks for funding the game! How's pvp these days? Still nuka quantum clicking simulator? Maybe they'll fix vats..
---
pretty sure everyone agrees with you, just depends on how much it annoys them
---
This hit me right in the feels. Well said.
---
I too was excited for some new BoS themed plans. Even just plans to make some of the items already in the game or reskinned versions would have been awesome.
---
Not getting exclusive plans/rewards for parting with my cork, and the absurd amounts they want compared to steel which is way more common, baffles me and makes me wonder how disconnected BGS with playing the actual game. I have 200x more steel in my stash than cork and I pickup and scrap everything that isnt nailed down.
---
I know they want to impress and help the new game pass players, but its the vets that will do the heavy lifting, so I hope they realize this and sort out some exclusive rewards for part 2 of the rebuilding.
---
Or like you said, people are gonna get bored/burnt out on the content and move on to greener pastures.
---
Really? What YouTuber? I watch a couple of the building ones. That show is going to be a DISASTER after this patch
---
They should be fine if they're already built, you just can't build new ones!
---
What new events?
---
Which new events?
---
Well... I logged in just to make same post
---
Colossal Probl--oh wait, that's not it
---
give them limited range. I wouldn't want to eliminate wires - its part of the aesthetic of the Fallout universe - but something that allows us to run power inside without making our homes look like garbage.
---
It would be kind of funny if all the dropped items there ended up taking down a server.
---
Yeah, right. Like she'll respond or even give a shit.
---
U can talk to a man with a squeaky voice and put steel in a box...
---
Internal dev build is the best.
---
Free crafting, unlimited scrip, god mode, no carry weight debuffs, all atx enabled for free, bugs all fixed, V96 and V63 run like butter, double sided wallpaper, Ward dead in a ditch

Don't worry now you'll have the opportunity to PAY for interior walls in the atomic shop
---
was playing with my friend and he got kicked for a steam update, ~~and now it says he doesnt own 76 or new vegas,~~ actually half of his steam library of games and dlc is now gone, so dont update steam right now i guess
---
Has anyone tried blueprinting an existing double wall and seeing if that can be placed? If so you'll be able to build them for others!
---
Tell that to under the map CAMPs that they praised before.
---
I'll just go with what you predict, because you sound smart.
---
I couldn't agree more, except that I give the game maybe 12 months...
---
I would cancel mine in a second if I could, but I bought an annual two months ago...
---
We should have the option to shoot the BOS 200 million units of Raw Fertilizer instead.
---
Already under "resources".
---
Lol that’s unreal
---
I used ammo converter to craft ammo and it crashed the server
---
There's no plans, you have to build your camp on an existing resource deposit and you'll have them automatically.
---
Hadn’t ever thought of it like this...it makes a lot of sense. A surface level game designed for an audience that won’t look too deep into the mechanics. It likely means less work for the devs and more money from cosmetics etc.
---
Gotta be on Psycho....
---
I used to have it. 
---
Try logging online to any other game and then try 76 again. 
---
I wish I could give credit to the person who told me this.
---
You know they literally can't do it "now" right? Even IF they decide to revert this you're not seeing it until the next update several weeks away.
---
If this were just a PC game it would be easy, hotfix it in and they're done.  But thanks to consoles and Bethesda's insistence on keeping everyone on the same game build they can't do hotfixes outside of EXTREME emergencies.  If I had a penny for every time I've had to explain console certs to this sub I would have at least five bucks by now.
---
XBox
---
Same issue, pretty sure it's a Steam Issue.  I received a 0b update and now it's like this
---
\-- it wants me to buy it
---
\-- but I own it.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/snn0P1b](https://imgur.com/a/snn0P1b)
---
I get it, most of the ones i started with don't play anymore or don't have a chance to. Luckily made new friends along the way, so it's a mix of different people now.
---
I think the point is, that if you only farm one load and donate it you would be wasting a huge amount of time, with the scrap box you can simultaneously have workshops farming whatever it is you need and concentrate on doing some sort of route to get more, or just going to locations close to those and then donating in a bunch, saving loads of time.
---
I don't have fallout 1st either and there is literally no way I would invest time in this, as the rewards you would actually want are so rare as a drop that you need extreme quantities, which you won't get any time soon with individual runs.
---
Yep.  This is a basic usability concept, and anyone saying we are wrong to object to this should be chased down the street by Don Norman and Jakob Nielsen until they repent.
---
On the plus side, I never even knew it took mini nukes because I never had 3 of them to give it.  So...plus 10 points for knowledge, but minus several thousand for good taste.
---
Congratulations
---
I wish I knew about the double wall thing before, that seems so much easier applying a brick wallpaper or something else than actually buying the plans an crafting brick walls.
---
Yes and people runing sub 10 min silos legitimately too. Kinda feels like theyre just pulling exploits from a hat to fix currently.
---
I'm not complaining about the sub 10's though. Queen servers thrive because of it.
---
Edit: it is a bit different though. Since youre asking for a refund and doing underground camps doesnt effect their transactions.
---
Imagine the YouTuber, now everything he's worked on is for naught.
---
"Sure, Bethesda is still shitting on me, but at least it's less shit than before."🤷🏼‍♀️
---
[deleted]
---
Your name is beefytrout my dude. You bet your ass I recognise a fellow genius.
---
I would have added randoms I have played with but don't really want random people on my PS4 friends list
---
I actually find it more convoluted. But each to their own. 👍
---
Which would be exactly what we needed to begin with.. But I wonder how they will mess that up. It's kind of like half walls and support beams, they are in the datamine but should have been available ages ago. (More worried there since I am sure they won't work with all wall types.. )
---
From the 50 other posts, I'm guessing it's not just you
---
They aren’t there.
---
They are the good guys lmao
---
Today's patch notes is the first time I remember them ***actually saying, specifically*** that the event was not  dropping today.  For weeks now they have been hyping both patch 21 and the colossal problem event, without saying specifically when the event would drop.  So it's understandable that many people assumed the event started today.    Bethesda causes a lot of confusion with the way they put out information.  This is not the first time. It likely won't be the last.   I specifically remember a prior article where they were talking about patch 21 and they were like oh by the way we are putting the final touches on the colossal problem event too.  They really should stick to talking about what's actually in the upcoming patches.
---
Has anyone tried blueprinting an existing double wall and seeing if that can be placed. If that works there's a work around for now.
---
I've had the plan for a while. I hope to get one soon. I haven't even seen one for purchase.
---
I just opened 40. All 6 plans i got I already know. I added almost 100 pounds of grenades and aid items. I donated 10k steel I think I’m good for the week.
---
Hahaha bad ass!
---
I always thought that I should do that but I was worried I may drop something I may need in the future like keys and the like, do I just need to be careful or are those safe from dropping?
---
Wait, what did they do? Couldn't get to the game yet...
---
And the foundation change!
---
He was an army brat who wanted to join the forces, but couldn't because the world ended. So he's a military fan boy, and BOS are the closest thing he's aware of in the region
---
How do you kill the kid
---
Yea this is a huge bummer. I just took down my long time camp 2 or 3 nights ago to move locations figuring I could just redo it later...shame.
---
This is completely garbage and gives the community NO incentive to complete these lofty milestones.
---
You give 250 steel and get one Christmas present with less stuff in it. No new plans or outfits or anything.
---
Trash.
---
My steel is better spent on ammo, sorry Community.
---
Its just a game, dude.
---
Or and here's going to be an unpopular comment but regardless, stop using known glitches and exploits when it comes to camp builds.
---
People know eventually it's going to be patched and when it does it'll undo or prevent what you've already started.
---
Yeah, it will be a box to put wood in.
---
I looked them up, not a YouTuber.
---
 But it's some guy named vault101manguy.
---
Yes
---
How did you get it ???
---
No it does actually up your bar but if you're in PA it doesn't show you the notification in the middle of the screen until you exit PA and aaaaall the queued up notifications spam in.
---
Made a similar experience after first getting scared that the challenges might've auto-completed when I didn't get the bar in the middle but noticed the counter on the map going up regardless
---
This is why communism doesn't work.
---
200m resources for alcohol and plans every vet has is such a let down, I’m happy that it’s a way for new players to obtain these plans but there’s nothing available for vets and it’s such a kick in the teeth.
---
You can remove them if you power armor glitch into the foundation.
---
Only reason Im mad is because now you can't do wires through wall and wall of collectrons.
---
Its a total waste of time and u don't have to participate at all.
---
I'm no expert. I did a full health  commando with cola nut, life giver adamantium skeleton, field surgeon, suppressor, first aid, dodgy serendipity. It seems assassins ap sentinel leather armor is a favorite. Qffr weapons which have base damage higher than 110. The issue I have is that magic weapons negate all of these efforts. Explosive laser and gatling plasma basically have no defense. But if you can find a group that agrees not to use them, I think there is a place for pvp. Its pretty fun.
---
Hitbox issue. I would make a report about it, might be able to get a refund. I'm sure it'll get fixed eventually.
---
Yes it is!
---
You may have to login when the event week is over to claim the stuff, like the free things in the atom shop, or how the big wanderer mask was a limited time thing for fo1 last week and needed to be claimed. But as long as the community goals are met, you should get it
---
You'll never financially recover from this.
---
Yeah I said from the start I wouldn't be getting involved if the rewards were like this. 
---
It's a shame cos they've paid somebody to do voice work just for this event to be rather lack luster.
---
Bugthesda strikes again... Devs, wake up your gorblok idea for once
---
My prediction is they are going to add double sided walls to the atom shop. I see no other reason that this was a priority.
---
donate 1 unit when in doubt. :-)
---
People dont sell stuff I actually want in their machines.
---
I mean the awards are meh but I'm not going to pick up a pitch fork over it. It's a fucking game it's optional. I still just do my thing in the game as normal. Which is beat the shit out of things with a golf club.
---
If the Runescape Reddit has taught me anything, there are a shocking number of people that will seemingly live on subreddits for games they hate just to hate on the game.
---
They wrote they did. They didn't.
---
I’ve given up hope of any real faction additions to the Atomic Shop....the day I spend real money on the garbage they’ve been giving us (more Fortnite than Fallout), will be a cold day in hell.
---
So,...never?
---
This happening to me as well.  Played for about an hour after the update finished and all was fine.  Went to play now and at first the game would load but tell me it can't link my account to [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) and now is says I don't own the game.  When i go to the store page it says I already own it and hit play now and nothing happens.  Desktop shortcut won't work either.
---
It hinged on being able to place a brick doorway against another wall, then changing that brick doorway back to a wall. That part doesn't work anymore as you can't turn walls into doorways or other way around at all anymore, which I just don't see any reason for at all to begin with..
---
To be fair I'm not sure If the wasteland has anyone I would exactly call THE good guys.
---
its a free item luckily so we didnt have to waste atoms on this
---
Poor saps completely brainwashed
---
More like sixteen times the derail at this point
---
I did the same and just recently returned and even if things are better now, without FO1st you still have to deal with a lot of compromises.
---
One main problem I have nowadays is that I am struggling to manage all the legendarys I can't scrip due to the tiny cap, which barely lets me scrip three items while also keeping a decent stockpile of raw material for repairs
---
Oh, thats good at least
---
I'm thinking the dupers will see more value in trading resources rather than getting plans they are already dropping by the truckload
---
Yeah, running into the same problem here. I can force a launch through the Vortex client, but it hits a Bethesda account error.
---
Yep, that’s how it looks for me.
---
Baffling that they would ruin stuff that would actually earn them revenue..
---
Steam is telling me to purchase fo76 now. I received a 0b update and now it's like this
---
That’s exactly what happened to me.
---
Imagine taking reddit and the internet this seriously.  But seriously...fuck Japan. Not only for Pearl Harbor but for what they did to China as well.
---
Yeah I ended up switching to a dense mod, and I guess I'll just have a chest piece with a jetpack if needed. I appreciate the tip!
---
Welp looks like I ain't moving any time soon
---
Was David of Arktos/Diehards in the game? Can't remember killing him like you said
---
The voice work and his lines were decent too.
---
Same.. it crashed for me, then wants me to purchase it.
---
👋
---
Same here, I thought I was the only one. I bet it'll be fixed soon.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
edit: Now it's all Bethesda games, fo4, new vegas, fo76 and dishonored.
---
I would asume that since even if destroyed the wall is still there it would at least repair back to normal.. I hope at least.
---
It's a game mechanic. And does it really happen that often? Only happened to me once.
---
I nuked Atlas and then got off. No new event, no actual mods for SS Armor like it says, "bug" fixes for nothing that's actually a bug. No fix for still broken perk cards, no fix for SBQ not being crippled. This patch sucks
---
Exactly! The minutemen come way later but theyre the closest i can think of, activly protecting and fortifying those who want to work together to bring back civilization. The BoS are just guna start another war.
---
I get "Updating Ticket" on the launch dialogue box, and then I'm taken to the store page for the game. No idea what's going on.
---
There is a stash right next to the power armor stand...
---
I figured this out having this exact problem, you can hold the back button to exit ANY terminal
---
GDIT - I was looking forward to something new in this reward list but what a disappointment! To add insult to injury, the stuff in the list isn't even dropping like intended and is bugged in some cases like the power armor mods. If I turned out something like this as a work product, I would be seriously embarrassed.  I feel for the devs if there is some incompetent manager forcing these things to be released like this! Whew Lad, there is some serious dysfunction at this company!
---
Ive unsubbed my FO1st. Recommend everyone does same. Money is what they want.
---
That's how it's been with previous legacy camp builds!
---
It. Just. Works.
---
(Yeah dude wasn't it a Rose quest? You had to get his key and he was a super mutant)
---
Patch Notes:
---
New Public Event! But you can't do it yet.
---
Meat Week is back! But you can't do it yet.
---
ATLAS Community Challenges! But there aren't any new reward incentives to drive people to donate.
---
That specific exploit was fixed in today's patch.
---
I have the same issue
---
Talking in a party helps, i can't add people unless ive properly communicated with them. Slowly that game chat becomes a conversation and if pleasant enough you play again and again.
---
I'll help!  I'll help!  
---
.....but probably out of sheer laziness than anything resembling moral outrage.....
---
;)
---
Interior walls, it would be time they add these, but yes I am sure it'l be a 1200 caps pack that has them included. (The datamined half walls and support beams I am sure will be just like that..)
---
I noticed this too.
---
If you hold B then it completely exits the terminal. Its really dumb that it isn't obvious. I found this out in a thread when the converter was launched
---
Yeah.. I just uninstalled it and now it’s telling me i have no license
---
I laughed way too hard at 2 toddlers on a leap frog laptop.
---
I was scouting locations to finally move my camp to, but now I can’t have double sided wallpaper anymore. That, along with a lot of the other creative things people have done, are now gone so my new camp is going to be a square house I guess :’)
---
It’s not even the BOS. It’s just some dumb ass kid who wants to play soldier. So he paints a BOS emblem on some camo and hands out discarded plans from white springs.
---
Well I can't really blame them, as it was said it would be added with this patch.
---
What bugs me most though is probably that Bethesda essentially just wrote 'well we added it but it's not available and will be unlocked later' in the notes, which felt like a cheap excuse for people not to complain about their announcement of it coming out now
---
It's more likely not maintenance mode considering Fractured Steel comes this winter, and the reason for patch delays can definitely be attributed to work difficulties arising from COVID this year. 
---
It's caused issues for devs in numerous companies across the gaming industry, as well as other industries too.
---
How many hundreds of thousands of dollars per year do you want to pay artists to make things for a game that was never very successful, barely sells new copies and has very weak monetization from cosmetics?
---
I mean, if you want to splash out half a million bucks I'm sure Bethesda would be happy to get a couple more artists and we'd get more virtual cloths to dress up our virtual barbie dolls and more tea sets to play in your virtual barbie doll CAMP.
---
I've tried, but I suck at the glitch. I'm gonna have to do a Sword in the Stone competition wherein I pay 10K caps to the remover of 2 neon A signs lol
---
If you're on PC, I might have to hit you up for help if you don't mind.
---
I found him clipping into one of the walkways with another NPC. He’s getting others in on it.
---
Am I reading it correctly in that this means if I have say, one of the miniature robot models in my stash (not on display), that it can be auto scrapped when crafting something?
---
I only ask for help during the cork week. All the rest of them can fail for all I care.
---
Have you tried closing the app and restarting your PC?
---
There is the Possum badge that requires killing things with a fat man
---
Yeah, I’d like to see this one reverted.
---
 C.A.M.P. Building glitches should be left alone unless they cause actual, documentable gamebreaking problems. How is having a two sided wall or running electrical line through walls a problem? 
---
Hell I build my whole camp out of Door pieces first since they seem to behave the best and then swap to windows, and then swap windows to walls as I decorate. 
---
With those features gone, it’s going to be impossible to build a camp that actually looks like a house. Unless Bethesda got tired of me boxing in my generator completely or something, which I wouldn’t have to do if the let me use something smaller and less industrial looking for a “cozy rural” home build.
---
That has been patched. You’ll need to acquire them using alternative methods.
---
I'm glad someone understood it. 😂
---
I’m never putting down roots. I’ve camped in trees, under bridges, taken over entire buildings, homes, and Quonset huts. I gave up trying to build walls a long time ago.
---
Everyone brace yourselves for the thousands of boycott the brotherhood/cancel your subscription posts.
---
I kid, just let us know next week how much you donated because let's face it, you're still going to play regardless.
---
Tod?
---
done
---
Feck!
---
Got sad when I read that. Was hoping it was something else being fixed with them. But I knew what it really was.
---
Yeah, not launching here either. Telling me I can purchase it....
---
Ive come across quite a few new players and stumbled on a few instances in the past couples weeks where its just kinda annoying to watch.. there seems to be a high concentration of douchebags on the public servers i join
---
Same, don't know what's going on
---
Wall patch, what happened?
---
Also your camp is incredible
---
You think its gonna all be out by 2021? You overestimate bethesda
---
Yes Jackomara! This update sucks. Collosus delayed, building nerfed. What a great update...NOT
---
"Exploit" ..if you can call it this ,
---
I was humming the tune while cooking n my wife was staring at me... lolz
---
Yeah read patch notes, it’s fixed
---
No please Todd I don’t want to sub to Fallout 1st
---
This is not a windmill you can joust, Sir.
---
Yeah I wrote a post but it got removed by the pathetic excuse for what passes as "moderators" here who will leave trade posts up for **days** but take down posts of people voicing their dissatisfaction. Anyway, take 2. 🤷‍♂️
---
...
---
Bethesda,  
---
Do. Better.  
---
This is a god damn joke.  
---
You have zero connection to your players, and what they want.  
---
I have never before seen a game where patches are nothing short of disappointment packaged in instalments.  
---
You have already lost *so many players* since Wastelanders released that banning dupers and exploiters had to be undone because you couldn't afford the loss. So why then would you consistently make terrible decisions against the collective player-base?  
---
Why would you leave the fast travel bug and the inability to cripple the SBQ bug unfixed, as well as *numerous* other bugs that stretch back as far as initial release... in order to make some terrible change to Camp building? Why would you set up a community event that makes FO1st super appealing and almost essential for the Scrap Box, and then round it off by making the monthly rewards complete trash?  
---
Hobbyists are auditing your code better than your staff are. Modders took weeks to release what you have failed to deliver in almost two years! Imagine how much money you would earn, let alone *save*, by hiring the likes of modders who made the Unofficial Fallout 4 Patch that fixed the plethora of things you never saw fit to address?  
---
This is not a pointless ragequit/goodbye post. This is not an airport, so departures don't need to be announced. This is simply a post to say that if you can't **do better** then hire people who can. Either that, or this money-printing machine will dry up well before you have a chance to release your next one..  
---
Sincerely,  
---
Someone who knows you probably won't read this because you obviously don't care about what your players think until it threatens your profit (but trust me, it will.)
---

Upvotes there will likely provide more visibility than they will here. Thanks!]*
---
As far as community managers go she’s pretty good
---
I donated some steel initially to see what was in the loot table. Now I got a pile of booze. 
---
Bethesda and the BOS will get no more of my scrap. They went out of their way to ruin player camps for no reason.
---
I'd like to know the same. Just want the collection
---
"Unintentional interaction" if you want to be pedantic.
---
When players take advantage of that it becomes an exploit.
---
Saw the same thing.  They probably stood there baffled wondering what is wrong with the event
---
On us, my friend, on us. Or we would not be there.
---
They also nerfed nonsensical shit that doesn't need to be nerfed
---
&gt;If there's enough of a fuss about this it's possible they'll revert it in the next patch
---
Did they ever revert grass growing through foundations? Yeeeeah......
---
I’m 99.9% sure your boycott won’t achieve anything and people are still going to do it. Sounds to me like you’re burnt out
---
Super mutants are the good guys
---
Yes they are. Floating camps still work as they always do, as long as you have floating foundations but this post is about having walls that don't need foundations.
---
Any event with armed mobs will give you thousands of steel with high INT and scrapper.
---
Even just doing a Westek run will get you a ton of steel.
---
Steel is worth basically nothing and these whiners want to get the rarest things in the game from it.  It's pathetic.
---
It works about as well as a 1985 DOS program, which is terribly. It's about as intelligent as the phone service when you forget to add a 1 or use one when you shouldn't have: "It is not necessary to dial a 1 when..." then fucking don't use it, you fucking piece of shit computer. "You must dial a 1 before..." then fucking ADD it you fucking piece of shit computer.
---
1. It should be larger and easier to read. I shouldn't have to get out a magnifying glass to see my selections.
---
2. It should be context sensitive (see the phone analogy earlier), so that it only shows me ammo that I have and in sufficient quantity to convert to points.
---
3. It should take me only two steps to convert any amount of any ammo to points: Step 1: Choose the ammo type from what it knows I have so I don't have know that X ammo is heavy ammo or whatever and so I don't have to screen shot or take notes on paper first, Step 2: Choose the amount to convert. Done.
---
That it does not work this way tells me the programmer who designed it is an idiot.
---
But they said they added it in the patch notes and Bethesda would never lie in the patch notes. Right stationary Ward?
---
I think it's communal but we will see if it needs any claiming
---
You could rug them into each other in Fallout 4,and while the rug is still magical, it's more restrictive than it was then!
---
It's not a mind-blowing reward list, but it's fun to have an extra activity besides the usually daily slog. I don't mind that there aren't rare items. But I was looking to find out if there's a way we can see our current progress as I'd like to see how we are doing so far. Not sure if they've even added it as a feature - does anyone know if we can see the total count anywhere or if it just stays hidden until the end?
---
whats wrong with the BoS lol
---
Me: ‘can I go to the bathroom?’
---
Teacher: ‘I sure hope so! Haha’
---
Me:??
---
Teacher ‘MAY I go to the bathroom?’
---
Me: ‘why are you asking me miss? You’re the teacher’
---
I fucking hated that so I pissed my pants in maths once. NEVER happened again
---
Putting a vaporization nozzle triggers it to have short reach. At that point, *changing* the barrel is what bugs it out to shoot long reach again. It doesn't matter which barrel you have equipped as long as you swap it out after building the vaporization nozzle
---
They do come up too much, but it's not really that hard to get 1-3 in even an hour's play.
---
The bug is being able to loot it from any side at all. It's a nylon bag and the looting side is ripped, which accidentally gives access.
---
Mine hates it. I try to mimic to horn sounds
---
Yes, it can only be found through mod boxes
---
Feel you man. It really isn’t rocket science when it comes to what they should do for the player base to be happy. Can’t be hard to program a few new skins. Of course it’s Beth, and they fucked up the NW ghille suit reskin on SS armor sooooooo.....
---
Ya... I don't think any of us give a fuck what some moron on the internet is going to not do.
---
Revert it. The wall glitch is about more than double wallpaper. It ruins built in cabinets and other objects. It ruins any sort of round like building. Giving us double wallpaper wouldn’t fix those losses.
---
Well if that's the case I'd say crafting ammo with it is an exploit , using your logic and all
---
It was a ingame feature, hardly our fault Bethesda had a massive oversite on it and choose to keep it in the game for months before fixing it 
---
Cant let players have extra screws now that would really make the game pay to win
---
They increased ammo point limit, but it was not the problem in a first place. It is a machine to convert unwanted ammo - it does not need to have a dozen options for all ammo types, it needs one option: "Convert ALL" and attached container for ammo.
---
Its probably not tracking. Its just fkd.
---
Theres a Giddyup Buttercup quarter ride I want. The legs actually gallop on it. Thats the only one I think Id actually buy even though theyre all amusing to ride when theyre at someone elses camp
---
I was looking at the list, I have most of those plans, but am now curious about this crococolossus backpack. I don’t see the point with the same I can probably get from an event.
---
Oh yeah, just checked it on the wiki. He's a scorched at Big Fred's BBQ shack. Probably done that quest 4 times but couldn't recall
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/David_Thorpe
---
Yep. I genuinely enjoy this game and just hit level 333. Been playing since beta. But seeing the same issues that I saw then, despite being reported countless times by the player base and seeing 0 effort being put in to fix those while they fix stuff no one asked for like the wall glitch really grinds my gears.
---
Yup, came here to see if anyone else has the problem. I opened a support case with Steam. They just did maintenance, so it may be related to that.
---
Pro: adrenaline is fixed.
---
Cons: boring patch
---
Yeah, right after they revert these CAMP "fixes"
---
And yeah you can spam Quantums, if your gear and perks suck and you cannot tank any damage without.
---
That was mentioned for all weapons it applied to, although today's patch notes claimed to have fixed that again so fingers crossed after almost 2 years it won't be a problem anymore
---
Where there is music there can be no evil.
---
Lol, I solo the SBQ when I'm bored and its still hasnt completed for me.
---
Yeah tried launching it earlier, just a window says launching fallout 76, then nothing happens. When i go to steam library, it ask me to purchase, click on it, then tells me it's already in my library. Uninstalled F76, not can't install it. It doesn't even show up as greyed out in the library.
---
shit youre right. the person who thought of this should be given a raise
---
I would think it would be cool. Paint it to look like Nuka-Girl.
---
Hah. You should have been here on ammo conveter day!
---
Going to make us a Led Zepplin album cover.  With nukes.
---
Agreed, and while add it remove the damn terminal, with the scrip machine style interface you could just use the machine and its animation itself..
---
Because it's something to complain about, that's all. Every single update is met with these nitpicky criticisms. Just like people crying over delivering steel. Two days ago if someone asked about getting steel they'd be told to do such and such event and scrap all the weapons they get from looting and they'd have more steel than they knew what to do with. Now all of a sudden it's a precious fucking commodity. Bitching for the sake of bitching is all it is.
---
Ehhhh mostly neutral unless like, some crazy threat is percieved
---
and even then, they're mostly serving their own interests
---
I'm not donating any more scrap to this shit.  I'd rather have the scrap than all of these recycled rewards that I already have.  I donated 1000 steel, found out that I would get mostly booze, hand grenades and rarely a crap plan.  Not participating unless the rewards change.
---
On top of all of that, the only thing I really looked forward to in this update was the Colossal Problem, which for whatever reason they decided to delay for "Weeks".  They have their reasons, I have mine.
---
Foodbuilds whining about not being able to glitch their CAMP builds, wonder where all the whining was when they made punji boards non stackable.
---
I'm not entirely sure, but you turn in meat to the traveling vendor Graham and can get up to 1000 scrip
---
Go check out Atlas
---
Good grief..... yup time to scrap it and dump my ammo at the nearest train station bathroom...
---
I’m gonna try and get it off of bethesda.net
---
Yup, after looking over the reward spreadsheet, I have no reason to get anything off of there.  It's all just the same old shit that most people have already and can buy from the vendors or get from events.  Not even the t-60 part plans.  I have everything on that list already.  So much for 'rare' plans.  It's nothing but shite to drop on the ground.  They really must want this event to fail...
---
That's why I listed the little excerpt from the fo4 wiki, in that game it always remembers things because it's one constant save file, but switching servers or restarting the game causes it to "rebuild" your character and fix it. The low reach is particularly bad here when you consider that it's still bugged to go right through enemies without hurting them if you are *too* close, giving you a very small window of space in which you can hit your targets. A flamer that's this difficult to be hit by is a TF2 player's dream
---
Same here, but I'm also unable to download any games with Steam, it tells me I'm in offline mode but I'm not.
---
Please note that the following is my opinion on this matter.
---
Speaking from my experience in IT and customer relations whichever team that is in charge of the building module in Fallout 76 really messed up on these building changes.
---
1. Why was this changed deemed necessary in the first place? I don't see very many reasons why this was removed since it wasn't game breaking.  Sure it may have eaten up some additional budget, but it was seen by many as a game enhancing feature.
---
2. Why was there no substitute or replacement double wall piece?  If you are going to remove something that is used by many, if not all, serious builders then you damn well better have something lined up to replace that thing.  In this case, *all current building sets should have been updated with a double sided wall piece and a double sided doorway when this patched was released!*
---
If a double sided wall set is added to the atomic shop for atoms then people should be reporting Bethesda to the Better Business Bureau and the FTC since I think it can be argued that the game was intentionally broken to sell a feature that has been requested since the game came out.
---
My camp was one of these legacy camp and I was working on moving a wall and all of a sudden the game had me remove my entire second floor and any double sided walls that I had built.  Since there are no double sided walls to replace the glitched walls it now looks like crap.
---
I just cancelled my fallout 1st subscription and I will not be renewing until this has been addressed by Bethesda.
---
Using glitches that only YOU benefit over will always be unfair and fixed regardless how people feel about it. IMO in PvE it's not considered beneficial to be able to build a CAMP to your likings. PvE is also focused on the looks and cosmetics.
---
Oh wow I hadn't done the quest for a while I thought he was a mutie not a scorched. I also grenaded the shack and didn't look too close at the meat piles afterwards.....
---
It got removed OP, what did it say?
---
Hello 99.9%, I'm dad
---
same.
---
I'm gonan ask them if I can you can also get your cd key off steam
---
Restart computer
---
 I had to
---
I support nuking atlas on every server
---
I’ve been playing since launch. I’ve experienced all the bugs. I’ve lost stuff. Had camp issues. Lost legendaries or had them unlootable.
---
I’ve killed the Queen and gotten meh. I’ve killed the queen and gotten nothing. 
---
I’ve had score autocomplete once.
---
Guess what. I’ve still had fun. Do I need to have adrenaline to play? No. Do I need to farm the Queen? No. Even though I’ve missed out on score from a partial autocomplete and didn’t play for two days, I’m still ahead of where I should be. And I don’t grind the testable Xp, but I get it from just playing.
---
All the fricken uproar over what it might take to complete the legendary run and it all turned out to be useless. All the complains about having to do dailies. People bitching about not wanting to do NW for the score. And it all turned out to be wrong.
---
I’ve never rushed through the game, but I’ve done all the quests. I’ve had a few bug out on me, but eventually they worked. I’ve got friends that still have something’s bugged, like not recognizing a location has been discovered. 
---
It’s a game. As long as it’s fun I’m not going to be a total asshole over it. I’m going to make big stupid rants posts. I’ll stop playing.
---
What’s it going to take to get you to stop acting like an entitled brat? If the game sucks to your standards, play something else.
---
But stop taking it out on other players because they don’t feel the way you do. Stop acting like your something special and that you deserve extra because you play a video game.
---
1 - If the game weren't making money it wouldn't be supported right now.   
---
2 - I make them for free.   
---
3 - It doesn't cost half a million, artists at bethesda are paid a sallary not by commission... If you tell them to do something on their hours, they'll do it.   
---
4 - If you're going to reward cosmetics (Which they are), take the time to make them desirable. I've already suggested things they could've done. Hell, they could've let the atomic shop skip a week and have a smaller content drop since they still have an impressive backlog of unreleased content for it, then sent the artists who'd have otherwise been designing new things for the ATX to design new things as ATLAS rewards.
---
Im currently having the same issue,not just with FO76 but Prey,and fallout 4. Basically any Bethesda Game
---
The datamines did show half walls and support beams, interior walls could eventually be a part of that. I'd welcome it but I can;t say the 1200-1500 caps pack will make people happy.
---
Is that true for stealth boys too? What about tesla rifles and legacies?
---
Okok new rule. No quantums, no stealth boy or chameleon, no tesla no legacies. No bushes either. Can only heal with preserved pies xd
---
My point is pvp meta is silly and not fun for most. So I do hope they fix the vats. But that's probably going to be after a few seasons
---
I have a feeling it's tied to the QuakeCon sale they just started.
---
That came with this update.
---
No more cheating foodbuilds.
---
Pro: It's Fallout. Con: It's Fallout 76.
---
I doubt I'll get a response today from Bethesda. But if I do ill update the proble.
---
Do the overseer missions first. Don’t get upset at how camp is still pretty awful for building.  Invest in making a farm &amp; water purifiers to sell produce and water for caps
---
How about just giving us power connectors that can link up on both sides? Rather than trying to figure out how to run wires inside your buildings. You’re right, I don’t know why they continue making things less fun by restricting or fixing things that really didn’t need fixing. It sucks cuz I was planning on moving but not anymore.
---
Surprise, they didn't
---
Joke aside, if anything being able to do the double walls would get them more sales on wallpapers since we can then actually use them..
---
Skeleton crew
---
Nope. Never noticed the spelling.
---
That's actually kind of depressing, it suggests that the 20 atoms really was an oversight and not just a way of tracking your time
---
I have 25k steel, and was ready to drop a good portion of it.  I looked through the rewards and realized there's nothing new, so I donated a thousand intending to put a few provision boxes in my vender to see if they'll sell. Turns out you can't sell them either. Guess I'm keeping my 24k remaining steel :/
---
Oh I was. 😂
---
Did they not?? 
---
Thought you could not buy them off Regs, Patch notes lie again?
---
I haven't been able to get on to fallout today, so do you have to donate 1000 scrap or can you choose how much you want to donate? Like can I choose to donate like 5 scrap or does it have to be 1000?
---
WOMP womp!
---
Hopefully in the next update they will patch out the "bugfixes" in this patch like they often. Or err I guess patch the bugs back in?
---
Still good to submit a ticket
---
Nah they already have nukatron models from Nuka World, they’re like funny little Nuka cola machines with legs and arms. I’d totally be happy with your idea too tho
---
This is why I dont play it!
---
I swear most the people that play this game have never even heard of Fallout 2, 3, or New Vegas. Brotherhood are not evil and definitely not neutral
---
BuT iTs An ExPlOiT
---
“Hell no, we’ll do nothing!”
---
That’s my kind of protest. Count me in too.
---
I was noticing this before then, but it’s definitely become more prevalent.
---
So, you're saying the ONLY thing that made you have fun with building in this game - the only thing you found enjoyable - was... making double sided walls?
---
IYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
---
Are we gonna ask the Scorched to pay for it?
---
I dislike the Botherhood. I am not going out of my way to give them stuff. I gave 1200ish scrap i got from guns/random crap. I got 5 or 6 supply boxes. Ended up with 2 Sturdy raider armor arm plans and a bunch of useless other shit. I wont even use raider armor. Most plans I have scaved from venders slowly over time.
---
I'm with you.  Major disappointment.
---
At least give us XP rewards for S.C.O.R.E. levels gained after 100.... not... nothing.
---
Hey, they claim to have finally fixed the damage bug. If that is true, I'll forgive anything else they did here
---
I've been wanting that water collector ever since it popped up in the datamines.. And now that I have it.. It collects a whopping massive ammount of 2 water.. Why beth? That could have been 20 and you'd have lost nothing in the process...
---
&gt; Why would you leave the fast travel bug and the inability to cripple the SBQ bug unfixed, as well as *numerous* other bugs that stretch back as far as initial release... 
---
Different developers working on different areas of the code. Just like you cannot have an artist do developers work, then developer with expertise in area A can hardly fix bugs in area B.
---
Like, I fully agree that all those issues need to be fixed ASAP, but it cannot get fixed by throwing unrelated developers at the problem. And those developers not thrown at critical bugs need to work on something too...
---
If you're referring to me, I have no problem with giving materials in exchange for rewards, I have no problem setting up my perks for scrapping and going grinding. But I don't get anything out of it that I want, so I'd rather put the scrap aside.
---
Can you elaborate please? I’m at work. I can see you can’t make doorways into walls now... which is dumb af.
---
I ain't giving shit to the Brotherhood!
---
Yes.  They're part of meat week.
---
Good to no I’m not doing it now 😂
---
Pro - I'll get back to you on that one. (apparently adrenaline is fixed, not tried it yet). 
---
Cons - Ammo converter interface is somehow worse! Secret Service Deep Pocket arms haven't been added despite the patch notes. BOS won't accept Bulked items. Camp walls are broken when attempting to modify them. Weight issue with damaged Unyielding armour. Wall/floor decorations incorrectly counting when crafting for daily challenge. Even more static zombie enemies than normal. No Wendigo Collosus event (still bugged and delayed)...and that's just my day 1 notes.
---
Its probably a bug, since most if not all bethesda games i think are on sale because of quakecon
---
They should add a new beer Stein for each time they screw something up and break something new when they try and fix something
---
New event postponed anyway, they did you a favor.
---
SAME!
---
I mean he wasn't mad at you using the weapons, he just wanted all the loot and xp and you were in the way of it, sounds like he was warning you off from the start, he knew he would be using a weapon that would kill everything quick, he probably was in hardcore grind mode
---
Not that that's cool or anything, I just don't think this was as personal an encounter as it may have been perceived
---
for people that dont have access to private servers, there probably are times they wanna just grind and not bother with other players, leading to situations like this where everyone gets upset  
---
orrrr he may have just been an asshole lol, but both situations do occur! so the issue stands
---
Idk.  Probably.  I just don't know what I would get rid of.
---
I definitely see where you're coming from, and they need to balance alot of those things somehow, but part of what makes Fallout PvP fun to me, is the crazy things like explosions all over, stealth, drugs, etc. All the awesomeness that IS Fallout. 
---
Honestly the PvP meta in any game is silly, even a game as well balanced as say, Dark Souls, will have even one or two "top" options for weapons, spells, etc. There is always a meta, unless the game is absolutely balanced, which is damn hard to do apparently.
---
They are just sorta playing the hand they were delt
---
Oh ok.  I remember seeing all the posts saying the ammo conveter was horrible when it came out, and I thought "it can't be that bad" and by golly it was 🤣
---
someone in another thread mentioned there was another issue that they fixed that likely caused this as a result.
---
Well, if we have to pick a moron to not care about - I know who's getting my vote.
---
Yeah sadly it’s throwaway dialogue and a wasted opportunity. 👎🏻
---
In what way was it broken and now fixed? I'm just not in the loop on that one
---
Yeah I posted about it and lady Devin commented saying they are looking into it
---
How hard is it to make a persistent exit button at the bottom of every menu with a pop up confirm??? I thought it was never gonna let me free earlier...
---
What change to One Violent Night are you referring to?
---
Well either she isn't actually a good one or the leadership over there doesnt listen to a thing she says because they are so fucking out if touch with us, its ridiculous.
---
I don't really disagree.  You always should have been able to turn in tons of ammo and the point ceiling was way too low before. Doesn't really change the fact that the rework made the UI worse than it was before.  Did it used to give you options to exchange ammo you couldn't even turn in?  Did you used to be able to exchange quantities you didn't have only to see an error message?
---
You keep linking the same demonstration that hardly explains how to actually pull it off. I've tried it myself and can't seem to get it to worl because the instructuons are so vague.
---
Once there was 9, with 5 crowded into the church steeple. Yup that’s exactly what they had in mind when for joe to play the game.
---
*Runs away from Maury s camera man while wearing a bad weave and trying to cover face*
---
Sign me up.
---
is there a masterlist of the issues for this game somewhere?
---
It should have just been 20 water, bethesda would lose nothing out of that and people would want it more. Granted I love it for the looks but with 2 water is basically pointless.
---
Yup, currently trying to finish cheating death and I can’t
---
I’m having this issue rn
---
problem. Glad everyone here can even login to the game to play :) I have to re purchase it :))
---
Unfortunately there isn’t anything for dupers to gain as everything you get from the Provisions they drop in bags weighing hundreds of pounds. There isn’t really any value in dumping off this stuff for a beret or flag
---
It's okay when I do it, but the big bad dupers can't use the evil exploits
---
You need to spend 200 more bullion and buy the SS Underarmor plan and make it.  You still can't mod the Atomic Shop SS Camo underarmor but if you make it you can mod it.
---
Ok, so as an aside: I was in Whitesprings looking for something that pairs well with the Plague Doctor mask that I bought in the Atomic Shop today, and the Free States vendor actually had plans for the Heavy Combat Armor Chest, Arms and Legs. Only had enough Caps to buy the Chest though, but I'm rocking 59 DR/59 ER with the bad boy.

Why is it not just a vendor that u buy and sell from using ammo and points like everything else in the fucking game! Shit for caps, scrip for legendary and gold for top plans. Introducing points for bullets. FUCK! No need to check ur inventory and go back and forth. Wait till the legendary perks come out and u can make about 150 spikes from 3 steel and this whole thing will need reworking again. They clearly dont know what they're doing.
---
I'll prepare for the worst. Like always.

I’ve been playing Fallout for 20+ years. The Brotherhood are morally grey, *at best*. Choosing hoarding technology over helping people isn’t a ‘good’ trait.

If Bethesda weren't obviously so damn *cheap*, I'd be inclined to think you were on their payroll.  
---
Kindly collectively go fuck yourselves.  
---
Thanks 😊 🙏
---
Yea I think it’s more of the devs vault and not hers
---
I don't have FO1st so I don't know how much of an inconvenience it is but couldn't you just put your tent right next to the turn in and then do 5-6 trips to get it?
---
The hell is a "foodbuild"?
---
How about we ask for legitimate building tools so we don’t have to use exploits and glitches to build an interesting house?
---
People are buying shitloads of steel from vendors, tho
---
A pretty significant change they should have mentioned is that the BoS underarmor is now treated as an outfit, so all the flux you used up making shielded BoS underarmor is now gone
---
There is no design with this terminal that will work. Just make it a vendor or be yet just make ammo scrapable
---
I haven't played in a long while, but are you telling me they actually put *more* arbitrary restrictions on building? How can they be so out of touch and assbackwards?
---
We'd have too many to count, my friend
---
My assumption is that they are making having the subscription even more of a perk. If it takes from the scrap box last, there is more (albeit slight) incentive to pay for the sub. I say this as someone that had 1st for a couple months, just to make it clear I'm not trying to be one of those "bUt PaY tO wIn" trolls.
---
I'm sure the box will make a much friendlier, and more cooperative faction than the Brotherhood. I suppose they'll introduce another time-gated currency as well. But, they'll need 8 updates before you'll actually be able to spend it on anything because the update will break the vendor, and cause the SBQ to turn into an invincible lvl 30 mirelurk queen that spawns 500 lvl 90 radrats
---
How dare you suggest that they skip the atom shop. They’ll sooner release things broken than delay it. In fact! Here! Take a broken skin which once applied will never be able to be removed. That will be 800 atoms
---
Yes it's in the patch notes. But it's NOT AVAILABLE IN THE FUCKING GAME. Pardon the yelling but my back hurts from being over-encumbered.
---
Found the bethesda developer responsible for this:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gddMPwOc\_s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gddMPwOc_s)
---
They dont give score... and then they give it 5 minutes later, it's weird.
---
I like the level of detail of the event; a crate outside a building. The only positive I got some sugar bombs as a reward to stockpile for the next soul destroying legendary run.
---
Fun and enjoyment is also a game exploit apparently and require balancing.
---
I believe under taggerdy, Roger Maxon, and Lyons they were good but under macnamara, Elijah, and the rest were just too entitled, elitist, and self serving. Everyone after the original Maxon on the west coast forgot the reason the brotherhood was founded. To protect the people of the wastes from dangerous tech. But they see it as a way to gain power and hoard stuff and believe themselves to be all "holier than thou".
---
Doubt it. They have conduits that intentionally are meant to run through walls already.
---
Honestly, they've been through a couple iterations and like most things, it's based on the leadership. The BoS people shit on is the totalitarian thugs they are in FO4 and elsewhere. They take what they want, instead of actually helping the people. They're also super racist as they don't consider ghouls, super mutants or gen 3 synths to be human at all and thus should be eradicated even though there are examples that they do have humanity on them for example, Fawkes, Grahm, Paladin Danse, and countless ghouls.
---
You had me at Brothelhood
---
Nope I have an Xbox, PS4 and a PC and it happens at some point in all systems in many different games... if one of my friends or myself gets dash boarded we just go " awe got the bethesda buzz/ the buzz" haha
---
I'm truly afraid to log in and see my ~10 hours work Camp glitched or with missing parts. Specially my furniture with several items I made using the rug/connectors glitch :-/
---
Probably because it makes for a toxic PvP experience where people can just hop in place with a stealth boy shooting at the ground and spamming nuka quantums. Not sure if there's any PvE reason besides potentially annoying some people at events
---
“Then make it worse, but with good intentions.” 
---
I believe the saying goes “The path to hell is paved with good intentions”
---
We knownyou guys have been telling us about all the challenges that take too long to complete. And we decided that you were right the amount of time spent on some isnt enough go kill a 3 star legendary!
---
Oh and don't worry we lowered the spawn rates on them. 
---
I legit said screw that AND the 50 critical shots for the weekly. And just ranked up 2 with atoms 🤣🤣
---
One of my characters has an Intelligence of 30+ and I get the same thing.
---
Now I'm laughing at you too
---
The event will be completed either way. It's a community event and if it fails it would imply that the player numbers are embarrassingly low. Bethesda can't risk that.
---
Besides, what are they going to do if it fails? The BoS will skip Appalachia and go straight to DC? :D
---
So much this...if they won’t even show us the progress then I have a hard time buying our participation matters which makes this event pointless and just a grab at excess saved up scrap.
---
I wish we could make the BoS turn tail on Appalachia.  They failed once here, fuck those guys, Raiders rule!
---
I look forward to farming those asshats.
---
you are exactly right, of course.  Graham wandered through my camp and i bought one from him to test the "one a day" theory, and nothing changed
---
later it hot me that i could start to craft one ( not having the nuked flora yet ) and sure enough the quantity, eight, showed up
---
weird, since the misc. shows how many of everything i have ... ten keys to the penitentiary, for example
---
thanks for taking the time to answer my n00b query, my friend !
---
Stupid term used by 76 players who mainly PVP and play boring meta strats. Basically the most boring, unfun people on the planet can't stand that other people can have fun by playing the same game however they please.
---
I mean, the Followers of the Apocalypse are well-intentioned, if not genuine good guys.
---
Including your system would greatly help because I’d offer to carry you/help with main quests
---
What about the raider bundle hood? Really REALLY wanna see if those work together before I buy it
---
I am not OP btw.
---
&gt; It’s a game. As long as it’s fun I’m not going to be a total asshole over it. I’m going to make big stupid rants posts. I’ll stop playing.
---
So I ask you again, where is the line? Who are you to dictate other people feelings and desires to them? Your argument amounts to "If you don't like it you can get out" and "If you take games seriously you are wrong" and doesn't take into account anything unconscionable that Bethesda has done and continues to do, and also the time, feelings, and investment of other players who disagree with you. 
---
&gt; What’s it going to take to get you to stop acting like an entitled brat? 
---
Entitled to what exactly? Are we suppose to take the product as is and chalk everything else up to a big ol misunderstanding?
---
Probably won't do much, there are still dupers out there with millions of that junk each. A handful of them could complete the whole event if they really wanted to
---
Super easy, barely an inconvenience 😁 I see what you did there 😁
---
This is the ‘best version’ so far. But even Taggerdy’s group came across as overbearing and domineering to the rest of Appalachia.
---
Morally grey is pretty good in fallout
---
Wait....are you telling me there are People that dislike runescape?
---
That already exists, it's holding the back button for your platform
---
Whats the point when the mechanism of ammo exchange sucks. Period
---
You can buy those at i believe Aurum in the Whitespring
---
Got them, but i cant apply to my SS arms or legs..
---
Wow. Just wow. Newest, most popular armor didn't have one of the most popular mods since it came out, then they apparently just forget to include it in the patch it was finally supposed to be in. God damn that is impressive.
---
Funny thing is .. Dont they feature builds that us all these tricks?
---
You physically can’t drop keys. Not even duplicates.
---
I'm so mad about this, I stopped played a month and half ago.
---
And one of their best doctors is a former naz-- err, respected member of the president's personal security forces!
---
Oh great. That's so dumb!! Well, I guess now I have a legacy camp too. I also used that glitch with the power lines. Well, good thing I used it before this monstrosity came up.
---
Oh man, bethesda bugs are so strong they invade steam servers and clients
---
My main thing is I love building immersive camps. Interior walls is one of the best ways to do that and make buildings more polished.
---
I mainly swap it in for queen fights, otherwise I run with 3 in marathoner and 2 in adrenaline. It's an easy sacrifice since you're not really sprinting around during the fight.
---
It is something with Steam’s update. A lot of people are reporting their games say “purchase” instead of “Play”
---
I also have the problem
---
Are you able to launch it from your file directory?
---
Didn't apply damage bonus after getting kills. Which is the only effect the perk has
---
What did you expect?? the engines early 360/ps3 made and made for a single player experience and it was broken even then. The engine at the core is just bad but Bethesda wont make a new one. Instead they port it for elder scrolls and whats worrying is Starfield is probably gonna use this engine.
---
Yee, they often do that
---
&gt;Broken promises (Colossal Problem, where is it Bethesda?)
---
You're right with the other ones, but not here. This is not a broken promise in the same manner as game getting delays (e.g Cyberpunk) is not a broken promise. If anything this patch shows that delaying a feature to test it more is something that Bethesda should do *more*, not less.
---
you are kidding, you are saying this game uses Adobe Flash and Action Script? WTF, is that a common thing?
---
We already have Clearwater but a way to passively collect boiled water would be nice. Else making a trip for dirty water is not a big deal since we can spam the collect button.
---
Add an extra 0 on there and then it may be worth it!
---
Yeah. It was the one thing I was looking forward to after the news of a Colossal Problem getting delayed. Not to mention that they're fences and not walls.
---
The disconnect is getting extremely frustrating. They are taking too long to fix most things and the obliviousness of what the players want and complain about is pathetic. Their current methods are a failure.
---
same for me as well in fact everything i own by Bethesda says to purchase.
---
Unyielding is all I use so that's gonna sucks and really they pushed by collosal problem again I was so excited for that and for that only I don't know why I expect anything from bethesda anymore
---
My brothers stand strong I see
---
The Universal Windows Platform stuff has always been way more of a hassle than it's ever been worth. My guess is that on every other platform, they're able to just modify the game on a file-by-file basis, but the UWP encryption means they have to do that serverside and then propagate the new versions of the files down to every user. Or, maybe they don't *have* to, but it's easier and there are so few people playing through Gamepass for PC or the Windows Store that they just don't bother.
---
I use dodgy and packing light in agility.  Idk about it.  I'll do some testing, see what's worth it.
---
Dang, well at least it just isn't me. Is there any reported fix yet?
---
i wonder if this was a partial "fix" to the complaints over the rng low drop for the good stuff mole miner pails.
---
But even if it was, there has to be a better thing to put in the "pails" besides recipes that a character ever needs one of before they clog your inventory.
---
Yes. It looks alright.
---
You actually have a great point
---
You hear about the show that's going to be about fallout by Amazon
---
I clicked Gameplay or Technical Issue -&gt; "The game wont donwload or install -&gt; Contact Steam Support
---
FUCK IT, I'LL MAKE MY OWN BROTHERHOOD, WITH BLACKJACK AND HOOKERS!
---
Arcade, yeah, forgot about him.
---
But was he really that bad? Been a while since I played NV.
---
Nah, its good now
---
turns out the quantity is only visible when crafting.  until then the quantity will always appear to be one uncrafted recall card in inventory
---
Doubt it since it wasn't intended to use that way
---
Negative. Even tried it from cmd, just takes me to the purchase page.
---
See the way I feel is it's not about getting the results right now rather than a public statement saying it will happen.
---
If only there were a better forum for games
---
I really don't get how people are done. I just caught up with Zorbo today. I missed a day or two at the beginning and another day somewhere last week I think, but I've done every challenge except some of the tougher NW ones and I hit, what, 68 or 69 today?
---
Its only a display piece in my camp. Doubt I will ever use it again. The user friendly interface isn't there
---
I just wanted a 'max' option not the 1/10/100 option.
---
And who decided to put buy and sell on the same pages? It should have been a front page split. 
---
The original ui was slow to use, but this 'improved' version is a mess.
---
...and the terminal screen is still too small with a massive border. Result is unnecessary small script making use even less fun.
---
So "fix" things that don't need to be messed with and ignore all the actual important bugs. Fucking pathetic.
---
2nd issue Bethesda have had with bags! Are you sure it ain't supposed to be a canvas bag or is it crappy cheap ass material? 😂
---
Yes, everything as in demo. Still not work
---
Okay that's good to know, thanks
---
Same issue for me. It shows as owned but when I use the desk top icon it take me to the steam store page. It’s not showing up in my library either. Glad I’m not the only one I was pretty freaked out.
---
I can't enter the cabin where Rocco is in the Wastelanders main quest.
---
Don't shutdown your program to escape, it broke my game
---
Oh come on, is having to scroll through more ammo types really worse than having to press 4 buttons 100 times to get rid of all 300 of your railway spikes?
---
Thanks! Gonna start working on my farm right away.
---
That´s some malarkey (to keep it civil).
---
Seeing what I did there is tight! 😂
---
Yeah, but I can forgive that as desperation in bad situation, I like the BoS
---
I am on Xbox.
---
Delightful, I prefer Modus as he has a charming smile that isn’t strange at all.
---
Could we stop talking about the Brotherhood like anyone other than Roger Maxson or Owyn Lyons is in charge?
---
Roger Maxson was not like Arthur. He legitimately wanted to help the people of the wasteland.
---
At least it ain't Beefylips
---
You used to be able to farm the event for legendaries for like 30 minutes.  Now the event ends in 10 max because of the timer.  It was a fix no one asked for and took resources away from problems that desperately need fixing while actually making zero sense.  It's not like it's even a money making thing cause they dont sell legendaries.
---
At this point it's become a shitpost term, but if they're serious, it's basically a term used by bloodied unyielding players who don't like fun and hate anybody who has fun
---
Technically it should be Dorsey that can do that he's the one requesting supplies not the actual brotherhood
---
We will see. I can’t control them. All I know is that I every piece of steel, concrete, cork, glass, leather, and wood moving forward that I find will stay in my scrap box. 
---
I am also of the opinion that after this messed up pile of Brahman dung, Bethesda can’t afford to alienate  the player base by not giving us the rewards. Even if we never meet them. I am not even worried about loosing out on a few plans I may have missed from previous events. All the ones from this event will end up in vending machines with all the duped ones from previous events.
---
I dont have any meat piles, thanks to a mod, so no flies either...
---
Welp, i'm never moving my camp now thanks to them :/
---
I'll try to vendorhop it, but I haven't had any luck with it so far. Vendor hopped harpers ferry bot who's supposed to have it like 30 times with no luck lol
---
It's definitely not worse. The option to scrap 100x the original amount of ammo help a lot. Just like before, use \[TAB\] (or whatever does BACK on consoles) to quickly jump back directly to the scrapping options.
---
But just because it's better doesn't mean it's fine. It's still clunky. We have to go to inventory to check the amount of our ammo and manually select the optimal options. The terminal interface needs to go.
---
This was an issue in the PTS, I wonder how it got past
---
No, it's more about the fact that these "foodbuilds" try to act like they know what they're doing. They complained about PvP they don't put an ounce of effort into being good at, and then try to have Bethesda do things like "damage caps" or the recent team PvP aggro F**k up.
---
There are actually several builds viable in PvP, and of course personal touches to your own build based on preference. Also some builds can use multiple "meta" weapons, Junky Commando being the most versatile with access to Tesla, handmade, and laser. The second build I would say is "meta" is the bloodied heavy power armor builds. You can of course use ballistic (LMGs) or energy (Gat Plasma) on that build as well.
---
Oh man, I'm not much of a farmer but that's still really annoying. So many better things to work on. Seems like they really screwed the pooch with this patch
---
You're in your gang which is fine, enjoy yourself.
---
Ah bummer I’m on PS4
---
In the last two years I have lost a lot of respect for:
---
Bethesda, BHVR, Blizzard, Bungie, DE, Nintendo, Ubisoft, and a handful of smaller companies not worth listing. I do not know why, but almost every company seems to have no idea why people like their games and are trying as hard as they can to piss their player bases off.
---
&gt;No rules were broken and they used the "keep it civil" to delete my post showing 2 game breaking bugs.
---
I’m not a mod, but your title of the old post was quite snarky and attacking the devs (warranted or not), so I would agree that you probably were crossing that line of “keeping it civil”
---
Oh. I use bloodied and unyielding gear. But I do enjoy fun, that's why I get satisfaction for running around wearing a chef outfit and a rolling pin destroying all mobs in my path.
---
Don’t get me wrong, I like them as an entity in the universe and lore. And I think they serve a purpose. 
---
I just don’t think of them as ‘the good guys’.  That’s the role of the main character, if they choose to take it.
---
Honestly, I'd rather have the shelf glitch back if I had to choose between walls and shelves
---
Peace through power. Join the brotherhood or perish pleb!!!
---
There is a main event every hour on the hour. That is the Cook Off. Prior to that, there are (if I remember correctly) other events, called Primal Cuts, every 15 minutes. Those events involve creature waves and collecting prime meat and regular meat, which is used for the Cook Off. Prime creatures are always legendary, I do believe. The Cook Off consists of several tasks needing to be done. Adding meat and veggies, playing music, and turning spits with meat on them. Rewards are based on how well the combination of the tasks are done. 
---
I think the two times the Event happened before, I probably got the best rewards 5-6 out of 10 times. Depends a lot on how many players are there. Rewards include Tenderizer and mod plans for it, Bloody Chef outfit and hat, and regular loot.
---
Lmao haven't played for awhile but after this I'll just uninstall the damn game, good to know so I won't waste any more time with it.
---
Pvp in 76 is an unbalanced joke and anyone with half a brain knows this.
---
Yeah I put in just 500 steel and while I was doing that I happened upon the post that had the whole spreadsheet showing the rewards and just laughed. You really want me to give up my steel for some explosives and beer?
---
They use the ABC Mouse servers to develop the game.
---
Don't forget the awesome, engaging back story for the whole thing. I'm not sure if it was actually written, or the voice actor made it up as they recorded.
---
... It's not adult sized. 
---
Really how much can you get completely wrong today
---
It's a bug from what I heard
---
Don't know if someone has mentioned in the comments and sorry if they have.....
---
But Spin up weapoms, you can't use your favourite wheel items or stimpaks untill it has completely stopped spinning.
---
Thank you!
---
They decided to make some unwanted adjustments to the building system and, hence, you can't use the 'traditional' double wall (with doors) trick to make walls you can put wallpapers in both sides. You now have to use the unpatched flamethrower trick, whichis tedious and doesn't always work properly. It wasn't even an exploit, since you used double the budget for a camp, but it allowed you to be creative in an easy, harmless way.
---
Chech the ITV for the details.
---
On the bright side, you get to free up some camp budget with those. So yay... I guess.
---
Its a bug caused by the future tech
---
As an adult who has had to survive on a twin size bed for a while during college, (and based on the sizes of humans) that comes across as being an adult size bed (twin size, but adult)
---
I read that it just shouldnt have to be done. This bugs been around since they inplimented the countdown timer and for some reason they just wont remove it
---
Bethesda are the definition of “failed abortion.”
---
You’re right, they can fix picture frames
---
Bethesda’s should hire the modders that made FO4 great. Atleast they were able to fix the game.
---
I don't know about "we", I speak only for me.
---
I will ignore Atlas, the rewards are just not worth it. I don't play an accident prone drunk with no plans, so I don't need all the booze nor the plans those BOS-alcoholics give out, nor do I ever use grenades.
---
I am way better off selling my scrap to vendors for more caps than I get for the "rewards".
---
Don't worry I'm sure Bethesda have a double sided wall coming up in the Atomic shop soon.
---
Power armor and pew pews
---
If you mean ‘lesser of multiple evils’, fine. 
---
But there are individuals that are much better examples of ‘good guys’ in this game. 
---
Like Harold.
---
I thought the colors were locked down and these were just blue
---
as other comments said. fallout 1st. it was a limited time thing.
---
Considering you can count on one hand the number of children that currently live in Appalachia? No.
---
I ran dodgy for a while, but then I realized I was rarely getting hit, and then I was it was usually from melee enemies so blocker takes a big chunk off that.
---
Happy cake day :(
---
I didn't believe you... so I went and tried it. Sumbitch, sure enough it worked.  :)  :)  Thanks for the PSA
---
Yeah Bethesda deserves a slow-clap as well.  This was a sloppy release on many fronts.
---
i would settle for an atom shop version stash box with only a 1000 kg cap...
---
Umm, it resets weekly (tuesday), they just fixed it that you can actually buy it earlier now. You now have to wait till next tuesday to buy again, so wont get any extra...
---
Pictures or it didn't happen.
---
It could have the servers pulled at any time, all depends on the bottom line and the 'higher ups'.
---
The TOS will have contingency items to cover them for this legally.
---
250 per donation.
---
The worst part is the items to sell are still visible even if you dont have enough of that item.   If it could grey out or not show options you cannot afford that would be a little better.
---
I have them and I'm on xbox one but im pretty sure they're just blue.
---
Going to have to try this out now
---
If you don't get it by the time I get on I'll do it for you and give you the plan if I still have it I had like 10 of them
---
They pay a team of people to come up with this. Put scrap in a box for caps. I too dumped in about 7k hoping to get the treasure hunter hat im missing from the last fuckabout. I got nothing of worth. Could have dumped that steel outside the wayward and helped someone out.
---
Oh ok. Thanks.
---
Raider doesnt have any skins either
---
An alternative take on their coded message... 
---
"we come in peace...and if you don't let us have Atlas then you will be in pieces" 
---
Charming people. I walked through the Pridwyn and Airport of F04 with an explosive shotgun, I doubt 76 will let me repeat the experience.
---
To be fair, one of the main reasons for Fallout 1st was to hold duped amounts of scrap! Most trading communities are now taking flux as a currency, usually asking for thousands of each flux. Nobody has that much farmed.
---
Ok, thanks i appreciate it! Im gonna keep trying my luck in the meantime
---
That's true often times they are not the good guys in my ideal universe they'd team with the NCR (who I think are the good guys) as an Entity within or in partnership acting as a supervisor for tech Brotherhood deem usable for the NCR. But this will never happen.
---
That was a change that occurred with the public events.  It was yet another sign the devs were out of touch with the player base when they lowered the timer to make that event part of the public event circuit without knowing we really liked it the way it was.  I have a lot of fond memories of farming that event with 5 or 6 strangers just shooting the shit on mic while farming the ghoul waves.  Now it's just a race to the crap wendigo lego at the end.
---
I completely agree. How could they have “improved” it and yet made it even harder to deal with at the same time? It was supposed to be a reward,  but using it now is closer to a punishment.
---
I didn’t have any delay in earning the points, the only issue I had was that the SCORE board navigation was SUPER LAGGY
---
"It just works"
---
Yet you can still build huge camps floating on stairs and they chose to "fix" this?
---
Tbh, the camp system was a major downgrade after getting used to place anywhere in fo4, that just allows much more interesting builds.
---
Actually literally JUST found it lmfao, i think your comment blessed my rng or something. Thanks for offering tho!
---
Tickets are being ignored these days, Bethesda doesn't care!
---
Wouldn’t you think that’d be unfair for the regulars? Don’t get me wrong I buy all the camp stuff, why? Cuz I can afford it and don’t careZ but point is, why would they pay wall an actual double sided wall? Seems kinda unfair for people trying not to spend money on the game. They should release it as an actual plan to find in the wild, make it rare. That way everybody gets a chance to have it without actually having to buy a basic wall that should’ve been a thing at least a year ago. 🙄
---
Yes. I'm saying the entire system is pointless and them being upset over giving us too much atoms is pointless (and probably not the reason) cuz they already make a ton off everything else.
---
I have all my strength used tho.  Heavy gunner takes 9 and pack rat and traveling pharmacy take the other 6.
---
I'll message you when I'm on my game is almost done updating
---
Before this patch it reset 8pm Saturday eastern.  Now it resets every Monday.  If you bought your gold between 8pm Saturday night up to 9am this morning you get another 300 gold you can buy in 1 reset.
---
I welcome more assets from Fallout 4, they should be about 75% cheaper though or some as event rewards as they are just a copy and paste.
---
Same thing for me. Unfortunate that theres no way to launch the game through bethesda's UI if you own it on steam. I guess vice versa is possible, but I purchased through steam not bethesda's UI. I REALLY don't want to miss my dailies, I just caught up to the dude on the board.
---
They aren’t. Some guy that wants to be their first recruit is asking you.
---
I just like how he says ‘member’.
---
That's it in 1
---
What we need is.. "Convert them all!"
---
Why?
---
Same problem here on my Steam library. I think it's just a problem with Bethesda published games, because DOOM, Dishonored, Elder Scrolls and Fallout games are all missing as well.
---
Oh ok yeah I wasn't up to date with it. But yeah, the event basically just consists of everyone camping spawn points and then some asshole one shots the crappy wendigo. It has potential to be a cool event so it's a shame. The wendigo that spawns should be much stronger and a harder fight to at least add something
---
Rip me. I got the mutation last night and teleporting has been so annoying. Now I realize that I have made a big mistake.
---
Those are both correct statistics.
---
I didn't even read anything about this in the patch notes.
---
Either an accident, or stealth nerf. Either way, it's shitty of Bethesda.
---
It's some bull shit. I can't even find a way to make a ticket with Steam right now.
---
of course theyre not theyre gonna add it to the battlepas!
---
No problem happy I could make your luck better
---
I milked the ones at Big Bend East last night.
---
From the patch notes...
---
"Secret Service Armor: Added plans to craft Pocketed and Deep Pocketed mods for Secret Service Armor limbs. They can be purchased for 250 and 500 Gold Bullion respectively from Regs in Vault 79."
---
...and yet Reg denies any knowledge on the subject.
---
Welcome to 76 - you will find most people are only too happy to help a new player out....regardless of if you want help or not 😉
---
Bethesda has been hyping both patch 21 and the colossal problem event for weeks now. But they never specifically said whether or not the event would drop today.   So a lot of people just assumed it would drop today.   That's understandable.
---
I learned long ago that you have to be careful to read the fine print with Bethesda when they talk about upcoming content though.  They are notorious for this exact thing.   Several times they have put out articles about the next patch that also mention  'upcoming content' and no date is specified for the upcoming content.   So I would assume that the upcoming content mentioned was in the next patch.  But I know better now. I have friends who thought colossal problem was launching today.    I had my doubts and those doubts were confirmed.
---
Everyone gets the rewards once they are completed, doesn't matter if you give stuff to the bos or not. On the other hand you can get supposedly "rare" loot as well as normal stuff from donating to the cause, but the end rewards are for everyone.
---
The Joker from The Dark Knight would be proud, Update 21 is "A Colossal Problem" haha poor choice in words haha
---
&gt; he vast majority of stuff I’ll be selling I guess.
---
You'll get more caps if you sell the scrap.
---
They should be added for free
---
As an elite food build I welcome the nerf to stacked punjis. Punjis were no challenge to a meta food build.
---
Ha!
---
bruh
---
Graham has it
---
I may have been looking too deep into this, it's been a slow day at work.
---
They seemed to have stopped offering refunds on atom purchases these days.
---
If they do, it better be for Fallout 1st people
---
No, this isn't normal. For most games, MMO or otherwise.
---
Square Enix and FF11 or FF14 or Blizzard/Activision and WoW, never seem to have this problem.
---
Bethesda is the only company I can think of who genuinely causes this kind of worry with their games, and 76 is the worst one by far.
---
"Good" or "Harmless" bugs are squished flat, but anything that hampers progress or just frustrates from crappy design is left in, and we get told "We'll pass it on/We're looking into it."
---
I love the idea of 76, but the reality is getting further away from the dream every week.
---
Edit: DayZ is another game with similar (maybe worse) problems with updates, but that's another matter.
---
That's a common cop out. PvP is hard to get into the top level yes, you need BiS gear that alot of hardcore PvPers possess. However, there is plenty of PvP to be had without the Meta builds. Hell, I've had ballistic duals with people right after frying them with a Tesla, I've had people set up fun and engaging PvP activities, and I regularly have awesome battles with people who wipe me from time to time.
---
So I agree that it's hard to be fully specced and prepared, but the majority of people are in a similar boat. The stories you hear are the ones about ambushes at workshops, or someone who had no idea what they are doing getting floored. You never hear about the honorable, and fun fights. People only get loud and complain when it isn't going their way.
---
Those people are foodbuilds who think that they should be able to compete with anybody. It's like slapping their pride when you destroy them, I am guessing alot of this comes from past Fallouts not being punishing in the slightest, and rewarding you no matter what. Now that it is an MMO, the other players are the punishing mechanic.
---
I preferred the original ui. It was slow but usable. The 'upgrade' is a mess.
---
Heh, and instead of the bunker it's the shady shed :/
---
Corrected 😂
---
I could hear heavy metal turning itself from distant noise to FULL BLAST at the end of this. Preach brother PREACH!
---
Same issue. Man this was stressing me out, I'm really glad I found this thread!
---
Huh, well that's kinda shit.
---
&gt; Not to mention--i saw that Asylum you called a base. You cleaned two floors... The rest you left for ghouls to have a sex orgy in and hide the bizarre red worker outfits. 
---
Giggity
---
*Insert Micheal Scott "Thank You" meme*
---
I don't like the sound of the Nuke Silo fix...
---
Try completing a challenge in PA and then exit if you didn't get the bar in the middle.
---
Instead of wanting them to revert a patch fix why not advocate for a double sided blank wall so we have a wall we can place wallpaper on both sides of. Makes sense?
---
In patch 20 (?) they changed it entirely. It use to be a 30 minute event. You could (barring idiots rushing the clock) milk this time for ghoul spawns. Typically each spawn was like they still are with 4-5 level 62 ghouls and 2-3 level 48. There is always a "boss" with each spawn that usually had a lot of chems and a map. BUT YOU WOULD FREQUENTLY GET A LEGENDARY WITH A SPAWN. Anywhere from 4-8 of them, lots of 3*. And when a level 62 drops, it is a level 50 item - in other words BETTER THAN WHAT THE NIGHTSTALKER DROPS! 
---
Now it is 10 minutes long, and you are lucky if you see 1 legendary.
---
THEY "FIXED" THE BEST EVENT IN THE FUCKING GAME
---
You forgot the 
---
/s
---
They got lost in transit.
---
I got two boxes, opened them, decided not to donate any more. I'll make ammo with the steel instead and sell it.
---
Ok thanks for the perk card info and yea I have a Je laser and plasma so I know that basically nothing can stop that but I’m hoping to find people who want to pvp with ballistic
---
I want the head of the person who thought making it a twin sized bed was a good idea.
---
See I was actually excited for this just because I thought it would include some new plans and items as rewards. 
---
I got beer and floater grenades.
---
I like the brotherhood in fallout 3. the outcasts were the ‘real’ brotherhood though.
---
in new vegas they were pricks but ok.
---
then came fallout 4. and maxson really freaked me out. pay attention to his hand gestures. he is the only character in fallout 4 that has that pattern. and it had a uncanny resemblance to a terrible human being, if we can can that fucker human being.
---
He likely is laughing, the colossus event isn't coming out yet. What were you guys thinking? 😂 Didn't read patch notes early this morning?
---
You are inside their minds! 
---
That is EXACTLY what they are going to do! And pray for the ability to customize the wallpaper of the outer wall because something tells me each wall will be sold  separately.
---
At this point the dev are just fucking with us for a laugh. They're already getting paid to work, doesn't matter how good or bad it is as long as it comes out.
---
The mistakes of the bosses we must pay for.
---
Dont know how
---
Does this mean no more double sided walls?
---
Darnnn i saw him like yesterday. And i didnt buy it :(
---
So what exactly is happening with the unyielding because its it's how its was making all your stats and carry weight jump way higher then they should mine has always been doing that I've had my strength at 65 my base is usually 40
---
No
---
 Imaginary Bethesda Marketing Spokesperson: " WOW! That's an amazing story!  Love those floaters!"  :D
---
Yes, true you have to be pretty ignorant to be killed by punjis, but you'd be surprised, I mean the complaining on here, nobody knowing about light step, everyone just expecting free shit from others, and calling them a griefer if they do any "bad" in a game where we are expected to roleplay a character.
---
Because it should already be part of the game.
---
I just booted my PC and it says that I don't own the game as well. I've read that some of the guys in here are having the same issue, but there's no workaround to it. Some said that you could launch the game via the desktop icon, but they get a server log out.
---
Says you
---
They forgot the secret service deep pocket mods too. We're in the exciting part of post patch where we get to search for al thel new bugs, things they claimed where in the patch but aren't, and general disappointments. Its a bit like the five stages of grief.
---
You are kinda extreme.
---
Sad to hear that can't even get this right. They lost me at the game being multiplayer focussed already.

Are you using the brotherhood fatigues underarmor
---
It's dying. That's what's going on.
---
Yeah i was looking in crafting for ages for the helmet only to realise there wasnt one. Damn u bethestaaaaaaa lol
---
The jetpack saves me so much time in game. It is a drastic quality of life improvement.  Things like the enclave missions go much faster flying. Getting away from mass mobs, just fly up to a roof. I use it constantly.
---
TL;DR, went and killed some mutants
---
He has a whole lot of really nice plans but they are all a couple thousand caps
---
This game is a fucking joke
---
When you lay on it, it gives the impression that your feet stick off the end. However, if you look at someone laying on it they merely shrink in size or hover next to it. It's honestly pretty hysterical.
---
I just want to be able to spot the bastard quickly since the damn thing never likes to tag his location.
---
What platform are you on? I have an extra ultracite calibrated shocks plan I’ll let you have for 1k caps.
---
If you try and convert the max amount it should just pull all your ammo off. Too much work to code.
---
Making caps isn’t a problem for me. My vending game is on point.
---
I work for a corporation. You have no idea how much it sucks if you don’t.
---
Yes, did they make it so the BoS faitgues are like a piece of clothing now?
---
I hope it does honestly, it would be a pretty poor design choice if Bethesda doesn't give us a contrary option. If they are just like "here's the Brotherhood, do what they want and get rewards! Or don't? I guess, but who doesn't like the Brotherhood?!"
---
If your on ps4 I can place whatever at your camp when I'm on
---
Welcome to patch day. Give it a few days and the whining dies down.
---
Literally the same thing just happened to me... What is going on???
---
Me too I would like to just have a good ole fashion shoot out. I’m on Xbox Gt is same if ur ever interested.
---
Yes, from what someone found they accidentally turned them into the fatigues you get rewarded from the event
---
You die.
---
But to be fair, that’s what happens to me ALWAYS when a yaoi guy comes up behind me.
---
Did this literally just happen. I have come back from camping and grabbed a new laptop. I have just installed windows 10 and Steam and have found tha Fallout 2, the only game I wanted to even play, is unavailable. What's going on?
---
Are you lost? Do we need to set up a silver alert so your family can find you?
---
Wth does your response have to do with the ops post?
---
Haha yeah I did it too sometimes and when they’re enough people to complete it it wasn’t that bad imo. It’s literally the easiest community event ever. Just funny sometimes to see basically half the server running in circles or even dead in the same place lol
---
Ok
---
That's the emote that someone asked for and Bethesda misunderstood what he wanted.
---
I just bought it today on Steam off of the sale, can't launch and it doesn't show up in my library. Weird stuff.
---
HONESTLY I said something about the junk walls long ago to people I play with. I loved using them in FO4. But of course they're in a 1200 bundle with some junk mothman item (literally looks like trash) and a rain collector that I'll never use. The car stash box is actually cool not gonna lie but I just want the walls. If only the bundle included the building junk walls and roofs from FO4 as well.
---
Exactly why I dont use gatling laser or gatling plasma . They stop firing intermittently for me.
---
I think that would be awesome I complete server we’re nothing but team pvping going on
---
I got it from the whitesprings resort vendors
---
Might still be able to do that with windows. 
---
I haven't had a chance to check yet.
---
Wow that is such bullshit, you’d think they would add in the ability to wallpaper a wall on both sides since it’s a very obvious thing people would like to do. Smh
---
Pita hid them from Regs as payback for him being a dick to her all the time.
---
Yeah but idk, I just need the lettering, not much else
---
Ah-ha! Thanks!
---
(Furious Hubologist noise)
---
[edit: thing]
---
You can disintegrate foul demi-humans without hate in your heart. We arent bigots, we are pragmatic. Now hand over any tech you may have found wastelander.
---
So you go code it. They have job openings
---
Oh yeah, I know. Been here a while. Just makes me laugh.
---
The Enclave liked that
---
So you are not loosing caps when you "donate" scrap to BOS?
---
Oh that's fine, I just need the letting made
---
Me too all my fall out games are gone!
---
Sorry I’m out of the loop, the what?
---
I don't have that plan yet, I like to take my time with everything so I haven't even started those quests on my main yet.
---
Durability seems to be inconsistent among weapons. Weapons like flamers and shotguns tend to snap like twigs after a small amount of use whereas other weapons can go several play sessions without needing a repair.
---
I have not done extensive testing myself but if you ever wanted to add to your already impressive list, that's something you could consider investigating.
---
But yes, tl;dr everything is broken in so many ways
---
Nope, they screwed us again!
---
100% word
---
Seems like an issue with steam...
---
Fun allowed in the world of Todd Howard?! Inconceivable!
---
Not true. Open it up and get drunk.
---
I'll give that a try next time, thanks!
---
Floater grenades. Drop them one by one with an extra button press. They removed extra clicks from the ammo machine so they had to go somewhere. It’s the law of Conservation of Energy.
---
Yikes.
---
I refuse to take anybody seriously if they say that having to scroll through all the ammo types is a net negative over getting a 100x option for conversion
---
I mean I did signal strength back in the day when the enemies could be hard. Kids have it easy these days...
---
😂😂
---
Why, what's so great about the pole hook?
---
Whats your gamertag? I'll add you.
---
The last round of berets clip through my toons head and I can see skin through the top middle of it. So even a beret won't help me.....
---
How Bethesda does this (probably more Valve with the sale store thing idk) is beyond words.
---
Look at it this way. Bethesda have had 6 dupe waves, all caused by trade windows or similar. They’re too fucking scared of a seventh dupe wave to get anywhere.
---
Although they're probably equally useless, I'd rather dynamite.
---
At least it's realistic to find dynamite lying around considering how many mines there are around Appalachia.
---
Same issue here. Tried to Uninstalle and reinstall and it won't even let me do that
---
Already said "nope" once I saw the "rewards" it was giving.
---
Same. Score is correct but the board lags as hell. I noticed they added some sparkling to the "legendary" rewards ,and it now lags.
---
God forbid they give us junk walls as a reward while we literally gather junk to fortify an in-game location. FFS, are they even trying to add anything besides Atomic Shop content at this point?
---
I'm glad they are fixing ridiculous CAMP glitches, all it does is add instability with all those dumb "below ground" bases. Seriously, you can stand just being SURROUNDED by "glitch" when in your CAMP?
---
Now I won't have to fall into oblivion because Pete Schweaty decided his tendies are done cooking so "time to log off for a spell" and I was foolishly shopping his glitched ass vendors.
---
Also you reported this as a BUG but in fact you are reporting a FIX to a BUG, so FTFY.
---
We don’t need another battle pass. I doubt more people bought atoms.
---
Wallpaper on the outside of a building is a bit different compared to game breaking hacked weapons.
---
Its a community event or something where we've got to collectively donate 1.2 mil steel scrap.
---
Why theres a boycott i dont know.
---
Weapon bugs, armour bugs, Power armour bugs... 
---
Just today I discovered that I can't use the ammo converter while wearing PA, as my character leans way too far down and ends up below the screen. 
---
But no, let's fix a harmless building exploit.
---
Same gt as here. This new "event" is garbage. The whole patch was garbage. Thank God I downloaded it!
---
Same thing happened to me, on all Bethesda games :/
---
Water thief reporting in. The rewards are capital D DOGSHIT
---
Considering that the very few new outfits we see Raiders/Settlers wearing are Atomic Shop, I’m willing to bet it’ll just be more boring Atomic Shop content. Nothing good will be given base game, more than likely.
---
I wish there were even some event plans, but sadly...  
---
Have a look at the [Loot Table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W0nsHf67V3_ke0RLgsIMwPb8kpI0kLgfX_0_bZPTTs/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;pru=AAABc98iQy0*OyiRUOom4oJdRKb43dnQww)
---
Yup. I logged in, did some stuff in my camp, discovered that they had patched out the wall changing, logged out. I felt so completely shit on in that moment. Of all the things Bethesda could have fixed, they chose something that people didn't actually want fixed.
---
I think this may have been the last straw for me. I've been such a vocal defender of this game, but this was it. The thing I couldn't put up with.
---
Lol, I was just messing around!
---
Thanks for pointing that out, my faitgues had the protective lining removed though which I'm not to happy about
---
Hope you are ready for the massive pile of booze you will get. I opened 40 crates. Got exactly 4 plans. I did however get 40+ bottles of assorted alcohol and a pile of bottle caps.
---
I sent a ticket in using the "Game won't download or install" option, hopefully that works. Since the "game won't launch" takes me to bethesda support even though it's a steam issue lol.
---
I kept my expectations low and somehow I'm still disappointed. lol
---
Ah nice at least a instill have my hospital
---
It’ll be a bundle for 1200 atoms
---
Glad that my base is underground.  I'm NEVER rebuilding it now!
---
Upvoted for visibility
---
You’re joking. Final straw for Bethesda, looks like I’ll be blueprinting my legacy camp
---
I'm not happy either I was using them to have more carry weight
---
It’s a feature to hide you from the griefers.
---
(Todd face)
---
Might just have to wait overnight,it’s doing the same to me on all Bethesda games on steam
---
have they fixed the jumpsuits? there are 3 plans. one craft the black one and two craft the orange and grey one. we still dont have the green one
---
Because the "rewards" are some alcohol items and floater grenades. I'm not giving up my steel that can be used to make ammo for some trash and a BoS beret.
---
You mean they did something right?
---
It does good damage, the swing ark is great and they're way cheaper than super sledges with a little less damage.
---
I would bet a half-naked whore this is a money grab! Wait and see they will offer two-sided walls in the Atomic Shop.
---
that's what I was going to do, I have about 32k steel in my scrapbox and figured 10k would be a good donation.  But I also don't see the point other than maybe helping others out??? I dunno.. I won't do anymore
---
It will cost you 500 caps and will be available in 2 months since they weren't data mined.
---
(Todd face intensifies)
---
I use .38 rounds, it's high enough calibre to one shot any humanoid enemy in the wastes, and most critters too.
---
it's a trick, get an axe
---
*BUGthesda intensifies*
---
Well, the dog is smarter, so we're good.
---
Even worse. They send a little "lacky" displaying exactly how much they value their soldiers lives.
---
Sure, send one man over there, to "see" if those people are friendly or savages! (Elder Maxim to Knight Butt-butt " ...if he reports back we're good to go, if not, we nuke them first.")
---
There's still the skeleton anatomy thing that may or may not be an armor stand of some form, we never got that this season.
---
Dont do it. The rewards are just floater grenades and alcohol. Look at previous posts with the full list. Save your scrap.
---
All Bethesda games are acting up for me
---
This entire thing is just great. 😂😂
---
They didn’t send him either. He decided to do this on his own.
---
I know your being humorous. But then three facts.
---
I have the exact same problem. I emailed steam support already but they haven't responded.
---
What items are you referring to?
---
There is nothing in the [Loot Table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W0nsHf67V3_ke0RLgsIMwPb8kpI0kLgfX_0_bZPTTs/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;pru=AAABc98iQy0*OyiRUOom4oJdRKb43dnQww) that isn't easier and cheaper available elsewhere.
---
Yeah im on ps4. Psn: Hypercell225, should i give ya something in return?
---
(Chally the moo-moo sad noise)
---
It won't help new people and it's pointless to even target them. The whole point was to target dupers scrap boxes.
---
Thanks for all the info!
---
Finish wastelanders quest line as a priority to unlock the new end game currency asap, so you aren’t losing out on said currency in your normal game play.
---
As you progress through wastelanders, do all quests for both factions up until the point that it forces you to side with one or the other. This will save you some of the reputation grinding, which becomes much more grindy after the main quest is over. 
---
use your scrip to purchase legendary modules from the purveyor (vs weapons/armor) in prep for the plans you can buy with the new end game currency.
---
Might have been fixed. Oddly enough my Q2515 tesla has been usable lately already, where it wasn't just a month ago, I haven't had the damage but at all these last few weeks.  
---
BUT the fix seems to have had some effect on the visuals of the weapon, the "rays" projectile whatever coming from it look off now, they don't visually bounce and chain off of enemies. They work, they cause damage, but visually it doesn't look like it's working properly. Reply if you notice this too, please.
---
Are you sure about this?
---
I literally have no idea how the converters work
---
I think they just want everyone to cave and buy all their prefab buildings

Hold the back button and it boots you from the menu.

What is dross toss?the game at the park?

u/valseek

u/Ladydevann
---
Any word about it?
---
And worst, do not kill the legendary in swamp. High chances you cant find their body n loot them
---
I've never duped. all my scrap is from 18 months of daily grind... ok I might have a problem :)
---
Nah. Clearing dungeons and scrapping weapons gets you TONS of steal
---
They really need to open up this game for mod developers. An unofficial 76 patch, new quest mods, UI improvements.
---
It’s what keeps me going back to fallout 4 and Skyrim.
---
How else are all those sleazy kids gonna have their crazy sex romps?
---
The dev team is 8 chimpanzees headed by a circus clown
---
Yeah that's a complete load of horseshit. 
---
Complete. Load.
---
Don’t people know anything about this game besides bloodied, junkie, and farming the Queen, a handful of events and complaining about limits?
---
Dup me a god tier weapon for all i care. Everyone is instantly one kill the legendaries
---
Did that for me too, refresh the page (I tried sending it again, but then it took me to the page showing it was sent in).
---
Just look up nukacrypt lol
---
Would explain why it won't accept the 200 technical data in my stash box!
---
Yup.  Same here.  Can not play the game.
---
I was just there. Nope.
---
Wow.
---
You are welcome!

It is in keeping with the BOS character to conscript the locals after taking over a valuable piece of property though. I for one have no plans to help them while they're in Appalachia. I do honor those who violated their orders and attempted to put down the SBQ though. They had the right of it. Ad Victoriam!!!
---
This is the same team that just broke part of camp building. 
---
Not sure they test anything.
---
How about you just let people do whatever they want to do?
---
yeah steel is SUPER easy... do a couple Uranium runs or even Lode Bearing and you'll have more steel than you need.   I just dont' want to admit how pointless it all is :) hahhahah.. I seriously have an addiction  :P
---
Its probably just a paperbag with a vault bag texture on top of it but its not centered.
---
The eight different community rewards that "potentially" come from meeting the goals. I know people hate the provision loot table, but c'mon.
---
I appreciate you and your pun.
---
Na I think they changed it a few updates ago where if say I kill a bunch of enimies and You happen to be close by but haven’t loaded everything in yet , the enimies will be dead and u wouldn’t get any of the loot cuz you didn’t kill them. Now the items appear after the body is gone so anyone can pick up the loot. Don’t kno if it has to do with bloody mess or not. But that s why u see items free on the ground like that. And with the way the bodies come back when u go to loot them it doubles it up sometiems.
---
I know what [we get](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W0nsHf67V3_ke0RLgsIMwPb8kpI0kLgfX_0_bZPTTs/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;pru=AAABc98iQy0*OyiRUOom4oJdRKb43dnQww) for 250 steel scrap. My point is that the 250 steel scrap is more valuable than what we get in return.
---
It would appear so
---
oh boy, wait till the next one, where they are supposed to touch level scaling lmao thats going to go well will no problems.
---
Ya, you missed that people who play the game through steam can not play now. Steam broke the game.

---
&gt;I feel sorry for the devs and designers who have to work on this mess of a game.
---
No something I'd want polluting my résumé.
---
Right because steel is soooo rare in the game. It’s like the most common thing you get from scrapping. 
---
I donated 4K today and it was so easy to get.

Because nothing ever runs out in a video game. Lol

Nothing to see here folks, ignore this Enclave propaganda *clears throat*
---
It still amazes me how nobody bothers to read the patch notes, hell I bookmarked them
---
I get what you are saying, especially if he’s doing it for the level up daily challenge xp. However for them to go out of their way and deny everyone of the xp and loot by using something like a hacked 50 cal... Isn’t that just as much of an asshole thing to do too? In the time that I’ve played since the beta, I’ve noticed that it’s always those with hacked 50 cals that are the most toxic but I’m sure not all are like that, it’s just what I’ve noticed. 
---
I don’t have private servers and even though I have legacy’s I don’t act in this manner on public. Besides, most of the time I’m equipped with my handmade since I’m a stealth commando. When things get hairy, or when someone with a hacked 50 cal comes, I take out my legacy laser rifle otherwise I won’t get any tags on the enemy’s. 
---
I was going to mention in my post but I didn’t want it to get wordy. I noticed this same guy with the hacked 50 cal in a radiation rumble event prior to the fort defiance event; killing everything in sight. However, I had no interaction with him, no emotes during that event either. This was when I began to use my legacy laser rifle.
---
Yeah, screw those greedy imperialistic bastards. I'm robbing everyone of their junk that I can. These are donations to myself. AKA my scrap box.
---
You lied to us. You say you added in the Secret Service Deep Pocketed and Pocket mods for limbs, yet they aren't even there. At least from my search, it's not there.
---
If there is anything in this game that we enjoy, they take it away. Im convinced this is the business model. 
---
They nerfed xp on ghouls in white spring because, oh no, we were leveling up too much. 
---
Then they nerfed how many legendary spawns were in white springs. I can do runs now and not even get one, but on average theres maybe one or two.
---
Then they took away legendary robots in watoga. 
---
Then they took away atom rewards for doing challenges and locked us behing this ridiculously stupid legendary run system to push repair kits and armor on us most wont use. 
---
Now theyve taken away simple build tricks we had that literally hurt NO ONE. 
---
While ignoring major bugs like fast travel issues, and issues with the SBQ. 
---
Now im even encountering completely invincible enemies. Not even the no damage bug, this is something completely new. 
---
Im convinced they want to alienate their entire base.
---
Same on PS4. I'm guessing a bug with the patch. I get the prompt to open the mine but nothing happens.
---
Oh, definitely. If they had their way we'd all live in soulless cubes full of mounted heads and dumb plushies 🙄
---
Edit: at least the junk fences somewhat sink 😂
---
Calling a gay man a former nazi for being raised in the Enclave (an experience he had no say in) is a fucking wild take.
---
I doubt the BoS Boss would rock up to mountain country.
---
We're all men here.
---
Not saying that it's rare. I could just put it to better use by making ammo. Anything is a better use than beer and floater grenades.
---
My other installed Bethesda game, Oblivion, also said I have to purchase the game. I tried uninstalling it as a test and it disappeared from my Steam library. I didn’t have Skyrim installed and I was able to download, install, and play it. I’m afraid Fallout 76 will also disappear.
---
Before times camp?
---
Just checked and neither was fixed. Both guys were buries with work apparently.
---
Woosh
---
Like to call my scrap organic.....
---
Same here, need to check my game pass for pc to see if it's the same issue but will have to download it again (all 75 gb of fun 🙄)
---
This hasn't happened to me, but my girlfriend is experiencing this issue currently. She owned every fallout game, and now none of them are showing up in her library even though the steam store shows both her and I that she owns them. They're on her profile, too. 
---
EDIT: She's also missing Dishonored and Morrowind, but still has Skyrim.
---
Wait...am I missing something? It specifically says that Deep Pocketed mod has been added to Regs’ inventory. I just looked and I don’t see a single new item in his inventory. Definitely no Deep Pokets for SS armor. What gives...
---
Are they leveled to event difficulty and enemies or maxed?
---
So I just finished my new camp yesterday, a round building. I'm guessing this can't be done anymore since you need to float the walls first using doorways then change them to full walls after glitching the roofs by flamethrower? If so, guess I won't be moving camp for a while. I've never tried this using full walls but the walls are still floating before putting the final floor down. A lot of builders in this game are gonna be mighty pissed. If my camp is haywire when I log on..... 😡😡😡😡
---
I am with 100%. I donated 6K steel scraps and that is all I will be doing for the BoS. I will not bother donating anything else in the future either.
---
Yep, I'm having the exact same issue. Someone else replied it's happened to them for all Bethesda games, but for me it's only Fallout 76. I was playing earlier, and when I came back it says to purchase, but it also shows I have it in my library.
---
I also can't verify integrity of game files (it's not clickable in the properties) but can browse local game files. Trying to directly run the executable doesn't work either. I guess not being able to use double-sided wallpaper in my CAMP is a moot point right now, since I can't even get into the game.
---
When wastelanders first came out that mission had so many bugs. So I’m on Xbox but first one I experienced was when a part of the mission happens the person with me was stuck in water and wouldn’t move or anything so I couldn’t advance. Sucked so bad. Only thing fixed it was logging out and redoing it all over
---
Showing off proudly, your lack of an attention span? 🙄
---
That was part of today’s update.
---
There isn't a Esc key on my xbox controller D;
---
It would be nice to get more nuka darks available out there.
---
No. It will not.
---
Maybe when building from scratch? I cant change any walls Ive already built. I used to lock up my store and change the windows to walls when I reached max caps and closed my store. Now I cant put my windows back nor can I move things around on a wall where decorations were hung around where a window used to be.
---
Same, if anyone know a fix/or when Bethesda will fix it let us know :/
---
'starts to' ...?
---
#Don't use FutureTec camp skin.  
---
There are a few hundred posts about it already.  
---
Known bug that they left unfixed in favour of making other changes to ruin the camp building system even further, instead.  
---
You'll have to replace and rebuild your camp with the skin *disabled*
---
You're set, I would say
---
Not that I’ve seen. For most issues I’d say reinstall but I think this is server issues between steam and Bethesda. I’m gonna just wait till tomorrow and try again.
---
How many facts?
---
Nope
---
I have not received Any legendaries from dailies or events yet. But I’m truly hoping that they can be 2 and 3 star too. Being faschnat I got 3 stars a bunch of times
---
You really only need to kill one or two...a half dozen, at most, of the people who make dumb decisions like these to get people to really think about decisions like these before they go live.
---
Like maybe if the person who came up with the ammo converter screens had been executed publicly, we may not have had this situation in the first place.
---
Nope. Gotta do what you gotta do
---
Fair. Maybe it's time to follow Marie Kondo and declutter your inventory. It took me a long time to ditch the weight reduction perks, but I'm now at level 400ish and the only one I have is 2 points for bandolier. It leaves a lot more room for damage increase and mitigation perks, plus I can leave scrapper, chemist, green thumb, and super duper equipped full time so I don't have to worry about swapping when I'm doing random stuff like gathering or scrapping.
---
How nice of you to poke your mechanical insulated noggin' in here Mr. "Paladin" if that's even your name. That's a rank, and if so your name is "XIII" or "8" which sounds an awful lot like a Synth's numerical identifier, rather than a human name, but I don't know anything. I'm just a "savage" who hoards valuable tech for myself...
---
This post will probably get buried because this sub mostly works as a safe space and mods delete genuine critiques but this kind of bugs are the reason people stop playing this game. I feel you bro. It is malarkey (to keep it civil).
---
I can’t even use the thing out of PA. I have 4 missiles to sell and when I try to sell them 1 at a time I get an error saying I don’t have any to sell. Wtf?
---
In all fairness, this is the only spot in the country with self-restocking nuclear missile silos, as far as we know so far. Securing Appalachia would kinda be the BoS' MO
---
Haha it me
---
I really thought I was losing my mind so I’m glad it’s not just me
---
Fo76map.com
---
They have camp items for the community rewards. Mainly a banner and the protection
---
"it just works"
---
Why shouldn’t they? They already try to alienate the entire gaming community
---
Dude, I literally just bought Fallout 3 because I saw it was on sale. Not only did I not receive the game, but Fallout New Vegas is now missing from my account as well. WTF.
---
I went fuck it and uninstalled it lol its downloading again
---
I do have a ton of caps, and I still do that. Gotta minimize the number of caps that get flushed down the ol' cap sink toilet!
---
Thanks!
---
i put 10k steel in, ill put in a little of each but thats it.
---
well ill put a bunch of cloth for the collectron i guess, nothing else is really worth all those resources except for the robot
---
Pics or it didn't happen.
---
Ps4 player here the event "rewards" are so crappy its just about killed any will i had to play 3 mishandled community events is 2 too many to forgive will not be donating a single item PERIOD!
---
It's a Steam issue. It's affecting more than just Fo76. Go through your library and you'll probably find more than just one game with this issue.
---
The problem is Steam doesn’t want to address it if you report because it’s a Bethesda title.
---
To piss people off.
---
"The rewards aren't good enough so we're going to make sure we don't get anything at all and end up wasting the event/ruining it for everyone else."   
---
You sound like a child.
---
I want to say server or internet connection issue. Easy to test if it's your controller. Does the controller act like this outside of the game or in a different game too?
---
Do they plan to reimburse Sinseer and the Chinese kids who run farm bots all day.
---
I'm willing to chalk this up to error on Bethesda's part, but... Does it actually let you sell one at a time? I know on the Sell screen, it says something like "Sell 1"... And then down toward the end of the line, it shows the *actual* amount you're selling.
---
Pretty cool. Probably going to be locked behind a dumb bundle
---
You’re welcome.
---
A CAMP from yesteryear...olden times...the days of yore. Good times. Simpler times.
---
So I submitted a case to Beth.net and they [coincidentally the same guy I had before not even a month ago] said they are aware and looking into it.
---
If..this kind of miracle happens for about less then 1% of people's complaints, we saw so much posts that gone blown up and beth didnt care at all anyway.
---
What Challenge’s can’t you progress?
---
&gt;Some of us took that final warning seriously and we're grateful we get to play again. The first thing I did when I realized Beth hadn't deleted anything was to get rid of the large holiday gifts
---
Exactly this. Perfect pointed out. I got temp suspended as well cause i tried to help some friends and did that awfull thing with a few items. As soon as i got my account back i got rid of everything from holliday gifts to even auto-duplicated techincal data(i swear i didnt dupe those things, why would I?). IMO was a good move of the company, cause i almost shit my pants just to think about losing my account. From now on avoiding everything ilicit. I even read the whole tos to make sure im playing by the rules.
---
Ash rose: palace of the winding path/Lewisburg rooftops
---
Kaleidopore: arktos biomes
---
Blood leaf: watery areas everywhere
---
Use green thumb and go to town
---
Well there goes my score progress for the day.
---
None of it has any “value”. It’s there to do with what you want how you want. Make billets. Sell to a robot. Make armor. Make outfits. Build your camp. 
---
Yeah the rewards are meh. So don’t turn anything in. Who cares. Stop acting like it real or has any real value.
---
Mmkay, ill probably donate some for the ones i want just in case, probably see a tweet when goals are met and can claim
---
Dare I say maybe Bethesda doesn't test before they update?
---
IKR? Took one look at it and I’m like “holy shit, something useful and it’s free.”
---
Yeah and I don't want to repeat his name, a waste of resources and people running idle bots are the ones who would reasonable acquire that challenge under 5 years. The highest hour count I have of any game is 5000 and that was over the span of 6 or 7 years.
---
They were massive pricks in NV for sure.
---
You seem to have the psychopath-perk equipped, in real life.
---
Either remove it, or go see a shrink.
---
To be fair, not many things are more sleazy than a sleazy bed for kids.
---
Lmao they aren't gonna make atoms off of that pfff
---
Also it helped to fix some bugs, because doorways, for some reason, are more often attach as they should, compared to normal walls
---
I think it's because the dupers have exploited everything with a slider. Trade windows, vendors, scrip machines. This is what we're left with. Disappointing.
---
At least they could award us with ammo credits as quest rewards instead of missiles and 10mm cartridges.
---
You dropped this "/s".
---
Yes same and it said "we are unable to help you please contact bethesda"
---
Bethesda has said issue is resolved. But no dice
---
They want to squash our creativity! 
---
This game sucks! We need to demand new Dev's and act out till we get them!! These people just are not getting it!
---
Ha ha I think they all have theoretical degrees in theoretical areas of game design.
---
Eh.  Some of them are must haves like batteries included when you're running a gauss minigun.  Speaking of which, its magic, so I can still melt the sbq while not having max damage output
---
Yeah....Bethesda is gonna anger us all more by not giving us some events after dropping this turd of a patch on us. I am calling that bluff and not giving any more.
---
Is there even any notification of the event in game? I was expecting something when I first logged in after the patch, but nada.
---
Not even Ultralight, that would have been even more useful!
---
It’s supposed to. Buy 1,10,100 and then sell 1,10,100. Wouldn’t let me sell any of my explosive ammo. Didn’t even try the others as I got rid of a bunch before the “qol” change.
---
Legacy Camps be really old cross dressers.
---
Welp looks like my camp isn’t getting rebuilt after all
---
you get it from doing the enclave quest line
---
It...just...works.
---
I won't stop playing, but I won't be donating.
---
bull, i just tested this, with both legendary and non legendary armor and weapons, including a bullion weapon got the warning every time.
---
I will tell you a sad story, I just got home from work, tired, I wanted to play one of my favorite games for a while, and I found that if I want to play again, I must buy it again, what kind of twisted joke is this?
---
Yup! I got back into this game cuz of a buddy and Wastelanders. And I somehow love it and hate it at the same time. Its uncanny. I really want to continue but, kind of pissed after the last issue I had and now this plus the other issues that are daily. And I dont post here a lot but, i lurk and read and see at least some people having the same issues. 
---
That being said I am genuinely nice to the Bethesda staff support because I work in the same type of business and I know how it is to get yelled at for shit that isnt my fault.
---
Lol k
---
Yeah because they obviously wanted you to auto complete his quest every day. What an outrage.
---
Yeah, it’s all my Fallout games. And only my Fallout games.
---
Me too
---
There is a 50/50 chance if you enter VATS with a Gauss Rifle, it will never hit the ennemy how many times you try. So you need to exit VATS and reenter VATS.
---
For the record,  of people were asking to raise the  ammo converter limit.
---
Also how does having players empty their hordes of 10k steel hurt you any?
---
They definitely should have included some of the rare outfit plans, or new plans. Or something new. 
---
There are rare rewards, in the form of plans. And I got some. But they are just plans that are already in the game. Nothing like the treasure hunter outfit or such.
---
Me too. :(
---
You have a solid point, ngl.
---
Haven’t tried the new iteration but really don’t know why they didn’t make it like a vendor screen. All your ammo visible, do like you’re going to sell to the vendor to trade for ammo currency. Same with buying it.
---
I’m protesting not because I don’t like Beth but because I hate BoS.
---
Me when I realise I’m not gonna get my Brotherhood of Steel collectron because everyone’s pissed of at Bethesda
---
I also have the Flame in the Flood displaying this. I have a friend with Witcher 2 displaying this. Definitely not limited to Bethesda titles.
---
But did they do anything to fix the abysmal conversion rate? 10k 5mm rounds converts to only 522 .45 rounds. That's complete bullshit. If they don't fix the conversion ratio, it's never getting put back in my camp. The raiders ammo machine is faster. So is runs to Lucky Hole and West Tek.
---
i just want to know why i have to hit B 50 plus times just to exit the damn thing. Why does it have to go backwards through everything i clicked on
---
Of course not and ur still building a bond with the other players if u swap back to that team later.
---
I do this all the time.   I even jump from group to group to find the closest fast travel point.  I'm lvl 206, caps are caps man!
---
kaleidiopore is only from kartos basement iirc  
---
ash rose I like to go to lexington then mining shaft #1 then run to welch (a bunch on the rooftops then another 10 or so from shaft/welch)  
---
bloodleaf I go to spruce knob lake, bunch of bloodleaf there
---
They can now sell curved walls... IQ9000 play
---
can someone even explain to me how it works? like I just donate 250 and got a box that gave me 4 alcohol drinks, is suppose to be shit rng like the purveyor? and rewards that don't have the same weight of the donation?
---
edit: just checked the ammo converter they manage to make even more awful to use, what the deal with the terminal put a fucking vendor like screen already, I can't see how much ammo I have to exchanged so I need pen and paper? ffsk those devs need to be fired alrrady
---
How do people not manage to always have tons of extra steel?
---
Bad person? Not at all. You aren't hurting anyone. Hell you might have accidentally helped someone by joining just long enough to give them that x2,3, or 4 right before completing something giving them the added xp, and when you leave a team it's not like it resets the added increase to zero.
---
Power armor is overrated.
---
Good to know they actually added something possitive with this update
---
I mean Berserkers makes the weapon do *more* damage the lower your armor resistance so yes. It would greatly reduce your weapons efficiency.
---
Ya, I miss read it, I thought it meant all holiday events didnt know regular events were included.
---
Is nobody going to talk about how it says harambe on the water tower?
---
Wonder how much would get donated if the Bos t60 power armor paint plans was apart of the loot pool.
---
Nah, ammo converter is great now! It took me 5 minutes to convert all the ammo I was holding on to that would have taken at least an hour or two otherwise
---
I haven't tested this, but I have a theory that you could put up a wall facing one way, then use the flamer trap to burn and destroy it. Now, put up a wall facing the opposite way. Finally, repair your first, broken wall. Maybe, just maybe, we can cheese the system and get indoor walls again. I'll test this theory and report back after 3 more beers and when my husband is done with the TV.
---
Ok, yeah, so I logged in to check. It says "Sell 1x : +60 points for -3 rounds". So what it means is, "sell one batch of three missiles for 60 points". The others are essentially "sell ten batches of 3 missiles each for 600 points" and "sell one hundred batches of 3 missiles each for 6000 points".
---
It confused me at first.
---
Mine are missing too
---
Lucky you can even build a camp. It won't even let me place stuff the majority of the time, and won't let me delete a single item (not even attached to stairs or acting as a connector to another piece) without deleting my entire build. I've given up even trying and just have workbenches and a stash set out at my location. Idk wtf they did but they tend to break the game more than fix it.
---
The legendary run burnt me out when I got to rank 70 and got hit with my first auto complete bug. Then I saw the ridiculous Atlas event and said nope. I'm done until fall or winter. This game is so shallow and broken. Time to go play something with substance and quality.
---
Don't buy it again thought. I think they just need to fix things on their end.
---
Cancel your first subscriptions. Once they lose money they’ll start listening
---
I agree. It would have been a ton easier to use.
---
People could open the window and take the junk out, but yes you should still be able to do the wire thorough windows.
---
Blood leaf around the water creek by the Wayward towards Flatwoods. 
---
Ash Rose there’s some on a roof top in Lewisburg, just north of the train station. And then there is more at the abandoned station 1 I think , not sure if that’s the name off hand. But there’s like at least 6 of them to the right of the barracks.
---
And the other ingredient is all over where we do project paradise
---
It’s not about hurting him it’s the fact that they are giving us crap rewards from the event
---
There's a hood in that?
---
There's a link you can check the goal on but i dont have it sadly and its updated 1 per day supposedly. added link to goals. [fallout 76 event goals](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events)
---
Yup :)
---
I’m doing it
---
no
---
If they'd just put a quantity slider into the original interface (like when you transfer, drop, or sell things) calibrated by "lot size" almost all the problems with the AC would have been fixed.
---
I haven't yet had a chance to go in and check what new fresh hell has been wrought upon us.
---
I'm going to look for that first it looks most medieval indeed.  Thanks!
---
I would assume it has some kind of stop where it couldnt possibly become worse than a basic non legendary. Ideally you would want to run little to no armor with a berserkers weapon to get the most out of it though.. higher you resistance the lower your damage, lower your resistance higher your damage.
---
Where is stationary ward supposed to be stationary at? I've found him in the same spot every time. Inside that camper thing sitting ina a chair.
---
I think your missing the point.
---
This event was phoned in - there is mininum effort. Its not about other people dropping in their steal for me, its about the fact the rewards are a clear copy paste with nothing new and not worth anyones time really. 
---
And yes, the simple answer is to simply not participate, but that doesn't excuse the fact that the event is a joke and those like myself that were excited to have something to fi ally do and looking forward to a bit of a grind for some new rewards feel let down. 
---
For the record, people asked for more than increasing the limit, a lot more to make the converter somebit user friendly- thats clearly not happened.
---
In addtlition, "fixes" that nobody asked for in CAMP building have again let the community down. Want to fix something - maybe start with something that is negatively effecting the community and address that. Off the top of my head, being able to fast travel first time everytime would be nice.
---
Ya it's for sure an asshole move as the game currently stands
---
I'm just saying it's also probably frustrating for people who play for the grind to have to nerf themselves for the sake of everyone else. Like they bought the game to enjoy, they didn't buy it thinking of having to be considerate of other players.
---
I always try to be a team player, but it is a strange decision Bethesda made with the tagging system imo. I mean, technically that dude, and everyone else is being punished just cuz he's playing the game "too well"
---
If XP and Loot were shared with everyone in the area, instead of having to tag everything, then this would be a completely different situation. In which the grinder dude may be seen as a good thing, ya know?
---
It's just an awkward game design situation that has led to situations like yours
---
I'm really not trying to defend the guy at all, sorry if it seems that way, I just think this multiplayer aspect of the game really could be designed better and in a way that didn't cause so much frustration, and I thought your post was relevant enough to chat about it a bit haha
---
When you're in the bunker, you're family.
---
I don't even know how it works honestly, like people give their scrap from free and they go "hmm for all that scrap, let's give them some alcohol that should make them feel good" but if you want I can link a doc of the rewards so you can understand why it's so bad.
---
So people are just wasting the nukes?
---
Fine by me. I’m a free states man. BOS can starve for all I care when they show up.
---
Yes more bugs please it makes the game funner
---
One of the biggest inspirations for the Brotherhood of Steel was an old short story called "A Canticle for Leibowitz", the basic premise is that these monks are protecting technology from others, the idea being that such destructive technology should be hidden and protected from those who might use it to do great harm to the world again, of course the issue, especially with the Brotherhood of Steel, is *who* are they to say who should and shouldn't use it etc.  
---
Sorry for the text dump but from a point of view, the BoS are the "good guys" but in the sense that they're just trying to make the world not completely destroyed again...
---
It hit us both. Only free night I get after the past two months of not been able to play lenghty and calmly due to some familiar issues and poof! There goes my night ranting on Reddit about this shite.
---
That just might work, please do tell me if it does (And make a post about it)
---
So far, it acts normal in other games. I do have shitty internet that is particularly shitty during storms
---
Ah ok. I don’t like that it’s a bug, but I kinda wish the vaporization nozzle/compressed nozzle had at least a bit more reach. Then the two shot flamer that I got might make a decent weapon.
---
I think it does lower you damage output though.  Kind o f like nocturnal but using dr as the scale instead of day night.  I think it's even the same numbers.  I dont recall where I got the info from though, so it could be out of date.
---
Who gives a shit? "Grinding" for atoms was easily the worst aspect of 76 before the legendary run dropped. At least this is more engaging and encourages players to participate in the new public event system
---
I just due no fill
---
The way I look at it, if a plan can be purchased from a vendor, then its not rare.
---
did you try taking a flame trap, breaking the wall with it and placing another wall?
---
I dont get my team buffs unless someone else is in my team if that helps
---
Its sad too since most player vendors are filled with these same shitty plans. You cant escape them.
---
If you're just doing challenges, consider turning Fill Team off.
---
Most people dislike someone who is just taking up a slot to do their own thing.
---
OK I'm sorry I didn't hear about that.
---
Well obviously it doesn't hurt me. It just seems like a huge waste of time, they told us we were getting new challenges/events. Putting steel in a box is nor a challenge or and event.
---
I'll craft ammo with mine u put urs in the box.
---
It shouldn't because there aren't any destructible physics associated with the walls anyway.
---
FINALLY WOOHOO!
---
Any idea how to back out after dumping a ton of ammo without having to keep pressing circle for 10 minutes?
---
Honestly, when I saw what this "community event" is - a massive resource sink, maybe to siphon out duped scrap and thus reduce the overhead load 1st subs generated with the scrapbox, without even any indicator for progress in the game.... If you even thought we'd be getting meaningful rewards, it's on you. 
---
That's not to say I disagree with anything in OP, I couldn't upvote fast enough. But yeah, at this point, having faith in this team/company is a fool's errand, imo.
---
Read the bottom part, if they start losing money they’d probably be more likely to just shut it down
---
Someone had to have turn in like 100000+ steel because I found a bag full of plans at a train station and most I needed, even some Powe armor part plans!
---
Thank you whoever.
---
w/o fo1st, the game would be a lot worse, unfortunately. It's damn if you do damn if you don't.
---
Modders have ALREADY FIXED some of these issues too in Fallout 4 mods. And Skyrim mods... And Morrowind mods...
---
No i dont just do challanges i want to grind for the hellfire armor i am not just afking
---
And they themselves were beaten up! Pretty badly too! And then they were ground into a fine pink powder!
---
Unless this has changed with today's patch you'll benefit from Inspirational even in a public group without anyone else. I believe Lone Wanderer does nothing if you're in a public group at all.
---
Yep bought the plans and am angry as fuck.  Hey maybe the people who wasted their gold on it can get something for the trouble.  Plus why can't they take it from stash like every other fucking thing.  They fucked this thing up so bad.
---
Of all the bugs in this game, why the fuck is this the one they chose to fix?
---
Why would they reinstate a BUG? Don't whine to Bethesda because you can't build your "Barbie dream house" with glitched ass walls and cords that make no sense going everywhere. God forbid you have to build a logical structure, and actually think about structure and efficiency. Too bad Foodbuilds cannot glitch their stuff anymore. Seriously. I wonder where all this outcry was when Bethesda made a silly choice like not allowing you to stack spiked boards. Haha very logical right?
---
Tldr; sorry you can't glitch your camp through the ground or place wires to nowhere, or floating roofs, OP. Maybe time to find a new hobby? If you don't already I recommend PvP. It truly is the "end game" everyone keeps begging for.
---
Or they know what people want, which is something to temporarily increase strength without the rarity of chems.
---
No its not just the team its other people
---
What IS going on down there? Is that a real quest going on that I’m overlooking or something?
---
This is absolutely ridiculous. This hurt no one and gave builders major creativie outlets. 
---
If it aint broke..  bethesda will break it.
---
I have played several pvp based multiplayer online games. The pvp system in 76 is complete dogshit, no ifs ands or buts about it. Why do you think 99 percent of the playerbase doesn't even bother.
---
1-2 hours daily is not casual.
---
I'm a heavy gunner, I blow through steel, lead, gunpowder and repairs take their toll as well. Basically heavy gunner is hella fun role to play at the high cost of materials.
---
Like the neon letters plan? It can only be purchased from a vendor. But it’s not always on a vendor.
---
There’s several plans like that.
---
That was the only positive thing he did, that's why they fixed it
---
Yep, just says Purchase on my library page. On the store page you can attempt to launch it but it's not working.
---
We dont even need a double sided wall. Just let up place a wall paper on either side. problem solved. Bethesda makes me so angry.
---
Also, now there is a limit in crafting stations (20 max overall) and prefabs (3 max overall)...unless that last one was already there, i had only noticed it on the cabin
---
so gun fu is broken again, well at least we got adrenaline back lmao
---
yes, glad its not just me. i have uninstalled and reinstalled steam. fo76 just gone from my library completely
---
Do people not use the through wall conduits?
---
I recently completed my dream of making scorchbeast mixed stew and have realized cooking is now my endgame. The grinder is on my short list as i still have to make all those scout ones as well.
---
Apparently there's this thing called Steam discounts (available today) that made some games unable to play. I've been going on and on about this for the past hour and there doesn't seem to be an update of sorts for the moment. People has reported to launch the game via the desktop icon, but it doesn't fully work as there's going to be a server error the moment you try to log into the game.
---
But then they'd have to take the time to disable charisma and trading bonuses so people couldn't infinitely print ammo.
---
Too much work for the interns manning the ship.
---
Damn bruh you got the whole squad laughing 😐
---
I see I see, well man I hope you have a better time than that cause that sucks.
---
My husband and I are both having that same issue.  When in steam library it tells me to purchase it but the store says in library.  It won't launch from steam store or desk top short cut.  Did they shut the server down again?  My computer doesn't have an update queued for Fallout 76 either.
---
XBox here. XBigiBloodX. Really? The rewards are just alcohol and gernades? I can make a ton of caps using that to make ammo
---
If only it was the fixing the undesired microgaps that appear in walls and floors from bad mechanics. But no, it's the one that allowed the easy use of double wallpaper to maximise the skins we *paid* for.
---
I shouldn't need a fucking flamethrower trap to make a house. Jesus Christ when did this become 'normal'?
---
Thanks
---
Considering that 7600 hours is roughly 317 days and more than half the time elapsed since the game released... someone that needs those atoms applied retroactively should have worse problems to deal with.
---
Makes sense I suppose. Still didn’t let me sell a batch of 3 out of my 4 though. Ah well
---
That's pretty much it. For every 250 steel you donate, you get a Donor Provision Reward box thing that is full of AMAZING loot.
---
I opened 50 to get a feel for the rewards. Then got feed up and went and looked for the datamined list which explained exactly why I was seeing the rewards I was seeing.
---

Hope this helps.

[It's a Steam issue.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i3w8l1/psa_steam_purchase_bug_is_affecting_more_than/) It's affecting more than just Fo76. Go through your   
---
library and you'll probably find more than just one game with this   
---
issue.
---
Not really.  The kept the same design but instead of selling one set of a predetermined amount of ammo you get to choose 1x, 10x, or 100x of that given amount. 
---
For example:  previously you sold 100 5mm for 70 tickets.  Now you can do that or 10x at 1000 5mm for 700 tickets or 100x at 10000 5mm for 7000 tickets.  
---
Honestly its better than it was but still clunky...
---
So it is possible that if your damage resistance is decent you could end up doing less damage than a non legendary? Interesting
---
I already know how to do my job and nobody tells me I did it wrong either.
---
That's fair
---
Steel being handed in go brrrrrr brrrr
---
Ssshhhhhh.
---
Idk bout you guys but I'm not waiting another month for basic shit to hopefully get fixed. It never does and I dont have the patience for this company anymore. I'm boycotting this game for now and if yall ever want this company to change more are gonna have to do the same. Sadly, these games are highly addictive and it's not likely this would make an impact.
---
Agreed, camp building is already super restrictive as it is.
---
Yeah I'm having the same issue. For some people it's multiple games in Steam apparently, for me though it's just 76. I submitted a ticket, waiting to hear back.
---
That I didn't know actually. Thanks.
---
Windows can be turned into walls, making the powerline glitch still possible. Since I just discovered that glitch existed when I did it about an hour ago.
---
[It's a Steam issue.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i3w8l1/psa_steam_purchase_bug_is_affecting_more_than/) It's affecting more than just Fo76. Go through yourlibrary and you'll probably find more than just one game with thisissue.
---
I always get an insane amount of alcohol and basic plans from the Xmas gifts. Sounds like these new rewards are reskinned Xmas gifts like you said. Very disappointed. It's bad enough I have to drop all these mounted head plans, alcohol, and weapon plans.
---
I use heavy guns too, do you people only use one weapon??
---
Same here and its so irritating and I really hope they get off there bumbs and fix this. It just started happening since this new update it seems like, considering it being so recent for us all.
---
Every time I’ve had a workshop taken, it’s been by someone 3x my level.
---
Is this the only way to get heavy metal armor plans?
---
The deep-pocketed limb mods are not in the game. Guess I'll just save my time and gold and wait for ultra-light, instead. Should take that long to be fixed anyway.
---
For 7600 hours, it should be hookers and blow delivered to your front door by Todd Howard himself.
---
This actually destroys camp building for me, now i have one more reason to never play this game.
---
Dupers are smarter than that.
---
I don't know or care if this is right but you got my upvote!
---
I get that literally 60% of the time
---
If you are in a Public Team while solo, I think that does negate Lone Wander.
---
I do know that if you're in a Private Team while solo that it procs the Herd Mentality mutation, and I think it does the same for Inspirational.
---
So I'm pretty sure it would tick the box for "in a team".
---
Any word if legacy blueprints can still be placed?
---
I’m happy for you. I did not.
---
Were we supposed to?
---
[It's a Steam issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i3w8l1/psa_steam_purchase_bug_is_affecting_more_than/). It's affecting more than just Fo76. Go through your   
---
Well done, super nice!
---
This was just malicious and totally uncalled for!
---
Gaben please I bought Half Life Alyx I just want to play games I beg of thee
---
Imo they should remove all restrictions for building placement! Let us be freeeee!
---
You mean legendary run? I think there’s a few weeks left I’m not sure, you might be able to make it
---
It's a bug remove the legendary run camp skin and pay to move your base it'll show on map now
---
To my knowledge I think so, I submitted a ticket to bethesda to fix it
---
I donated 2,000 steel. 
---
I got 8 crates worth of alcohol and some caps.  
---
Granted 1,000 was from my stash and the other 1,000 from server hopping 4 times and scrapping the weapons at west tek 
---
But really? That’s all I got.
---
Lighten up, Francis.
---
People have reported this issue and there seems to not be the only one. Some just couldn't get some S.C.O.R.E. out of the challenges and well, there's also the Steam issue where you cannot log in and play and so on lol.
---
Have you ever thought maybe the Sims might be for you
---
Given the displeasure with Patch 21, Steam's timing on this was rather unfortunate for Bethesda I'd say.
---
They should learn from the place anywhere mod
---
Its not like we cant make unrealistic camps with the current system
---
What happened?
---
I second **everything** you listed above, well put. Two more:
---
* They finally 'fixed' the NW seasonal rewards, and
---
* they removed an exploit with Ward (his ultra-repeatable quest) without saying so, calling it a progression bug. Disclaimer: I've never seen a single bug report complaining about that quest not finishing...
---
I mean, it’s a game... anything you do in it “means nothing” since it’s a game.
---
5 weeks left. You are behind but if you grind xp super hard you can get there
---
Even if you don’t finish you still got some cool stuff
---
&gt; heyre interested in what you: the consumer are statistically more likely to end up paying for regularly. Make no mistake, theyre not trying to build a fun game for you to play
---
But ... a fun game for you to play is what's going to make you want to pay regularly
---
I doesn't with full walls as ot leaves a frame, but with two half walls each side you can do it. Someone avove posted this. 
---
But, since a half wall is the same budget as a full wall, your double half wall is 4 times the budget of a single wall in that spot.
---
Someone made a post last night asking if a colossal problem was coming tomorrow. I resisted making a joke about the patch being a disaster since they all are. I regret my choice.
---
Some of us mainly play to build and rebuild camps.
---
Does the briefcase actually work?
---
It’s like Bethesda is trying to piss off the fallout 76 community
---
I agree, I got a junkie Gauss rifle yesterday and all I could think was “I can’t even trade this...this doesn’t help me at all!”
---
If you keep.getting hacked time to change your password format or mabye see if your friends like borrowing your accounts.
---
Stop glitching the game
---
I hope not
---
You are roughly at the same spot I am. I think its still possible. Might be more double S.C.O.R.E events coming up that will certainly help.
---
Keep the 150 atoms you unlock every so often right to the end so you can buy any missing ranks at no cost to yourself.
---
Also check out the other challenges for combat etc- entry of Atoms on offer if you habe not taken advantage of them already and hoard them 😀
---
Does /u/ladydevann read this sub anymore?
---
Some of us do only play to build. Just FYI. Its the only thing thats kept me coming back after 200 levels. lol.
---
Just encountered a bug where the cargobot carrying the nuclear keycard is spawned underneath Blackwater mine - right below the bot foreman. There's no way to get there and I am not sure if this mission will be stuck like this forever.
---
You are lucky you have been able to play since the update.
---
For me it has been unplayable.
---
Crash,after crash.
---
Fast travel spinning out.
---
First time ever, i can recall a message popping up on my PS4 telling me the game was corrupted and needed a fresh install.
---
PS4 literally spit the Disc out.
---
If u do manage to stop playing ill buy some of ur willpower for caps.
---
Her dialogue is horrible after the 20th time or so hearing it  .. can’t shift these nightmare or whatever garbage she spews . 
---
It just cured the ocd of having a quest marked off I think as it was bugged for a long time lol 
---
Although if they have fixed this what’s been broken in it’s place I wonder
---
i would like to see that, awful system, how those shit updates pass Quality control is beyond me
---
Sometimes, when I fast travel to Cranberry Bog loot will rain from the sky all around me. It's kind of nice considering the amount of times I've killed that bitch queen, and still have yet to be rewarded with anything resembling a decent drop.
---
Have you seriously been backing out page by page from every console you've ever used?
---
You realize you can just fully exit a console from whatever you're doing right?  And then if you want to go back to the top page you just activate it again?
---
Brick walls will still double if you use a flamethrower trap on the first one. Works for doorways, solid and windows.
---
Speaking of out of touch, /u/ladydevann isn't in any of the threads about this
---
Oh shit I'm sorry, the hood is in the Raider Skinner Outfit, I used the hood from that and the raider bundle outfit, my apologies
---
gonna see that couse 250 Steel have more valuable than 4 beer bottles and 2 Molotov
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-rider_problem
---
Literally how the world works, and things work out fine in most areas for most people
---
So nothing new or even slightly worth the reward. 
---
Im convinced rhis event is to get first players to dump out their surplus in their scrap boxes. One year subscriptions are almost coming up soon and i think most people will cancel. This is an attempt at trying to get them to empty their supplies and renew again.
---
Being able to jump as high as buildings because you got radiation sickness a minute ago.  
---
Armour sets and weapons that somehow have magical resistances / damage buffs to specific creatures.  
---
I'm not disagreeing with you, i actually think a lot of things about this game are strangely stupid and immersion breaking.
---
The PVP is ass and so is the building mechanics. Nobody WANTS shitty PVP, the same way nobody wants shitty building. Play literally ANY other online multiplayer game and the PVP is way better than the dogshit excuse 76 has. I'd LOVE to engage in fair, balanced PVP in 76. Bethesda just doesn't understand that PVP in videogames should not primarily involve grinding for hours to get OP weapons and gear to be able to insta-kill your opponents. That, and the game is bugged to hell. There's way too many factors that makes the pvp in 76 so fucked up, just like the rest of the game.
---
Such a besthesda thing to do. Never give you what you want, take away what you like. Like stealing candy from a baby, then hitting them with it.
---
what i thought also
---
Nah I've seen it in displays, just a visual item
---
💯THIS💯
---
I usually say "it's not so bad, you people just want something to whine about" but between this and the double wall *fix*... It may just be the kick in the pants that the veterans would 'need' to give up on the game.
---
Bethesdaaaa... *shakes head in disappointment
---
With that generalization, you have to also admit that the entire game is complete dogs**t.
---
 Because the things that effect PvP adversely also effect the rest of the game. For instance; God mode, Unlimited ammo weapon glitch, respawn bug, unable to respawn bug, workshop nerfs, etc.
---
There is no need to be so divided, as issues have been shared. For some reason the PvE people, largely don't feel this way. They believe it should be eradicated, and all who participate in PvP, crucified.
---
Anyway, if the PvP bothers you that much either, you A: haven't invested enough to learn and adapt as well as obtain better gear, or B: you also hate the PvE side because of these bugs and lack of balance.
---
I noticed one didn’t want to finish for me I had a difficult time with it
---
I found him in Vault 79!
---
The original 200 pound stash limit you mean. I was level 37 before they patched it to 400 pounds
---
Welcome to the fallout 76 sub, where currently more than 90% of the top page is nothing but people making the same threads with the same exact complaint about walls.  Expect to see at least a couple dozen of these just slightly more spread out.
---
I did think. If your going to not allow exploits, that means all.
---
But at the same time. Sheesh Bethesda. You kinda also have been promoting camps that use glitches to make camps.
---
Yeah, I would say the legendary power armor and modded weapons are the bigger issues
---
Thanks for letting my know, I just deleted the game from my library, now it disappeared.
---
Guess its back to minecraft for everyone I honestly can't even fathom how this game has a player base anymore considering how its been a runaway dumpster fire since launch.
---
No, I use every heavy gun type in the game and use Bear Arms 3 to carry them all. Problem is I run through 50, 5mm, 2mm, .308 so much that I can hardly deal with it. I have great weapons but...farming for ammo just isn't that easy as it used to be since I am always having to fix my armor and weapons since apparently Beth, nuked their durability and now they want us to donate millions worth of stuff to the BoS, who doesn't even deserve it since they robbed my Responders.
---
I’m going to assume you didn’t watch a single video about the legendary run recently or read any of the 100+ posts here on reddit. 
---
That future Tec camp is bugged. Whenever you unlock the skin AND move your camp to place it down. For some unknown reason it messes up your camp. You, and the rest of the people on the server can’t fast travel to your camp. You will not show up on the map at all. And I believe the vendors don’t work either. 
---
I heard about this like 3 weeks ago, so although I unlocked it, I haven’t claimed it.
---
I love condescending, self righteous posts made entirely on a point that goes right over the op's head. Thats what being self righteous does though.
---
Your'e right, my password was mediocre, and at 55 years old, most of my friends don't play video games, so no borrowing there. I apparently only got hacked this one time and changing the password is sadly no longer an option.
---
Wall fix?
---
I think their engine is so old they are not able to implement automated unit testing. So at every iteration, when they add more stuff, they cannot ensure nothing old is broken.
---
RIP. Hopefully Steam will fix it soon.
---
I’m waiting on some folks to let me know
---
+karma
---
Thanks for taking the time to write out a well written an good comments from the playerbase for those of us that are busy a lot with work etc
---
Gotcha gotcha, well then im gonna grind xp super hard the next couple of weeks.
---
Hold B if your on xbox. Works on any terminal
---
100% and it would be very easy to remove from any players that posses it
---
Much like the clean Mr fuzzy costume
---
cmon, youre telling me that you dont need more ***floater grenades***?
---
The entire game IS complete dogshit. Objectively, 76 has to be among the worst titles I've ever played. However, I'm still a huge Fallout fan and I can still get enjoyment out of a terrible game. The same way I can play 7 days to die, an awful game, but still enjoy it. This new "fix" for the building mechanics has just made a shitty game even shittier, and that's why people are justifiably mad.
---
That’s the nice thing about a reward at each step.  It’s 100 rewards, some bigger than other sure, but even just playing a little gets you something! I’m at 64 and don’t think I’ll finish, but it’s been fun
---
 They're not even Fallout fans.
---
 The Austin studio that is working on Fo76 was working on a game the studio designed, but when Zenimax bought the studio the game was scrapped. I'm not saying that every single person in that studio was 100% into that scrapped game, but it really sounds like Zenimax ignored any input from the studio and simply assigned them a task.
---
 The core parts of Fo76 were designed and built by Bethesda and then the incomplete game was passed to Austin. 
---
 It gets worse... Bethesda and Zenimax high off of the success of Fallout Shelter have forced mobile game design down the throat of Fo76. Repetitive gameplay, "content" that's just a reskin of previous content, seasonal events that just a new grind for the same shit. This game is a MASSIVE, UTTERLY MASSIVE let down.
---
sad trombone
---
Is that what that's all about? Why doesn't it just strip the paint job off if you accidentally drop something that's got a paint job?
---
7600 hours, Todd Howard better be the hooker.
---
bethesda might as well ad a duping machine at this point
---
Pretty sure it broke or was pushed back. Watched like 3 nukes launched at the mine with nothing happening
---
It's worse than you think...
---
Say you go through 30 pages to convert a bunch of ammo (or attempt to). When you're done... you gotta back up through ALL 30 PAGES before you can leave the machine. This is asinine and this patch is a low effort, not tested steaming pile of shit. I'm super disappointed in Beth today...
---
Was just in a game and saw nothing and just wanted to know forsure.
---
Sorry, but I want walls in my house, not an over-glorified fence.
---
You're that whale I've been hearing about...
---
Soooo... ummm... can i get my 25k steel back ?
---
Where the hell are the patch notes on the Bethesda website?
---
Cannot for the life of me find a link anywhere from the F76 home page.
---
Odd. Haven't gotten anything back yet from my ticket, and it looks like it is *all* Bethesda games. Doom Eternal and Evil Within 2 are also unplayable. Oddly, HBOMax also started being unable to play a lot of videos right about the same time. I wonder if there is a common licensing infrastructure they both use that has gone down.
---
yes, its much worse, since i have literally every option to sell/buy even if i have neither the points or the ammo to trade...i swear to christ, how can any group of people be so inept?
---
You know Fallout saga is not about building, right? There are MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO FIX in this game, I mean, everything is wrong with Failout76.
---
Patch 21 and honestly when has a patch come out since launch that hasn't been a disappointment?
---
To me scrap box is 100% the rest is bonus
---
Wow. It worked. Thanks!
---
Agreed. I'm canceling FO1st that I bought for the Responder bundles. I'm done paying for shit services, and shoddy products.
---
Prove me wrong Bethesda.
---
Hope is a helluva drug.
---
I’m foaming at the mouth for more *floater grenades*
---
If your character is built right power armor can make you extremely tanky
---
[it’s not real time. updated once a day max](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events)
---
They are going to make money off something we thought of! 
---
They will say " What people were doing was an exploit. We thought of two-sided walls two years ago. And we will sell you two-sided walls in the Atom Shop."
---
Works with full brick walls. Solid, doorway and windows. Personally tested.
---
-Oh ma gosh they killed foundations!
---
-You bastards!
---
Just landed my one star exterminator rolling pin from the queen, very promising so far.
---
Are you using the blueprint method? I'm going to be pretty upset if they patched that and I can never move my mailbox again.
---
😂 why do people expect anything else from Bethesda?
---
Beyond frustrated. Only had one hour to play today and I've not once missed a day of legendary run challenges until today
---
I say that knowing full well my standard set of passwords are below mediocre.  Sorry you couldn't get it figured out with bethesda.
---
Good time to remind people about a massive downside of digital products.  
---
You don't own them. You are simply paying steam an amount to use what they are hosting.  
---
If at some stage they don't want to host the files for you, you get nothing and are entitled to nothing.
---
Don't know what to tell you fren, I rarely fix armor and never run out of bullets, as I am always running at a surplus. You aren't only using prime ammo are you? Because that would be hard to maintain, true
---
&gt;Somethings gotta change about this. 
---
First thing that needs to change, that *we* can change - STOP. GIVING. THEM. YOUR. MONEY.
---
I know it gets exasperating to hear this, but it's true. They have little to no incentive to change anything as long as people keep their subscriptions and keep paying for atoms to buy up every new thing in the shop as soon as they're available (regardless of quality, even).
---
Those rewards arent worth my valuable scrap
---
Meanwhile, Flying buildings on stair stilts is just fine.
---
It's survival tents.
---
What problems exactly?  Mostly everyone who’s tested it on the PTS agrees the event worked just fine.
---
That’s too much to ask. Fast travel glitch is still live and you expect them to look into new shit? Maybe in five years. 😂
---
Y'all freak out over the weirdest things
---
I do agree, and am also a Fallout fan since I played 3. I have played this game since BETA, and I love Fallout enough to have also put up with the nonsense. I just also happen to enjoy the PvP, as broken as that can be as well.
---
Maybe rubbing this in is wrong, because it probably does effect me too, and I haven't tried it since the patch, but this is how us PvP players feel when they "adjust the team aggro mechanics" making legit team PvP impossible, or earlier when they took survival, and throughout the entire butchering of the mode.
---
That's why maybe I felt like I had an opportunity to be the other side of the fence for once.
---
It's like 180 or 160, I had to pick it up. It looks really nice on an armor I use a lot.
---
I'll make a gorilla camp before I fork over the atoms for all the prefabs.
---
Canceled my subscription as well.
---
Update: Bethesda emailed me saying it was resolved, but it wasn’t
---
Community Managers - "Look at this cool camp!"  
---
Developers - "They're not supposed to do that, better patch it."
---
Glad to see they're aware of the problem on Twitter. I had already sent in a ticket and the response I got was less than helpful. I think their twitter department should probably give the tech support team some assistance.
---
Are there any new items you can get from it
---
And if I recall correctly not on the weekends.
---
Brotherhood Bucks! Can only be purchased with bullion that can only be obtained from The Messenger events specifically spawning outside Fort Defiance!
---
What’s at monongah?
---
What's "unreal" is how people must be throwing money at Bethesda still despite all the issues. If they weren't then Bethesda would be listening.
---
Dupers are, Bethesda isn't though.
---
Minutemen, as annoying as they are?
---
Scrap box is best. Con is paying for it.
---
Fallout Tactics had Brotherhood Scrips, i expect them to come back someday.
---
Nah your good I'll add you as soon as all my stuff is done updating
---
Yeah, it's unfair to people who just like pvp in general. I wish the devs would stop screwing with shit and actually make some proper improvements. I still think they should've left survival mode in, it was fun being able to actually engage others without the slap mechanic.
---
Saw it too. In the interest of science, I wandered over to check out the nuke farming. Sporadic enemies and mostly yellow flux. Wouldn’t be my first choice to nuke, but what do I know.
---
Survival tent has saved me a good amount on fast travel costs, private world is great for claiming a bunch of workshops, scrap box cuts down on stash space a LOT, and some extra cosmetics don't hurt. I'd recommend trying it for a month and if you like it go yearly (it saves $5 a month).
---
And the foundation fix.
---
I'll try this on Xbox and report back but I suspect this could be tied to your localization of the game if it's not working for others.
---
Edit: I tried to follow your exact steps as best I can and it would not work.
---
[https://twitter.com/i/status/1290840497691353088](https://twitter.com/i/status/1290840497691353088)
---
Steps: Place the side walls. Place the double doorways. Go edit side wall. Up one, down one, scroll to solid wall. Confirm/Cancel (tested both). Select Doorway, edit. Confirm without pressing anything else.
---
It didn't work for me. Maybe it is the german client, and/or pc only.
---
Thank you for your service!
---
Yeah maybe they’ll have a take back the bog event!
---
Wasn't going to bother with it anyway, going to try and build a decent camp (going to be hard without the double walls now)
---
The event will start by nuking Monongah
---
My camp lol
---
Harambe lives on!
---
I quit this game cause of how many glitches and bugs happen every minute. Guess it hasn’t changed.
---
They could have at least taken us out to dinner first.
---
It's been suggested before to lift all these pointless building restrictions. Let players go nuts with how every they want to put. Sucks to see they are wasting development time on making the game worse.
---
Shhh dont tell Bethesda
---
I put my CAMP there when Wastelanders dropped, and my Tent next to the Raiders. It's just common sense.
---
Just so you know though, CAMPs can have issues spawning in just from a Player being present, not just another CAMP.
---
Hold b
---
My bet is that a different bug took out this bug.
---
Everything good in FO76 seems unintentional.
---
 This game sucks! We need to demand new Dev's and act out till we get them!! These people just are not getting it!
---
Teammates sharing a perk?
---
It suggests they got tired of watching people whine about an achievement they're unlikely to even unlock for at least another five or six years.
---
It's still still a way to track your time, now it's just a way to track your time with another 76 in it.
---
yep me and my buddy have the same problem . im angry just got home ready to play and bam
---
I did the exact same weeks after I came out. I got it on the release date. Played it in hopes it would get better. Stopped and didn’t pick it up for years. Picked it up a month ago and finally started to play again. Loved the new stuff they added. Today the patch update was downloaded and I have had more issues. It makes no sense. Then I see all the camp building “problems” that they “fixed” is making me wanna do the same thing again.
---
Sorry but only floating ennemies are allowed in this part of the wasteland.
---
The scrap box helped make Fallout fun again.  I was spending too much time dealing with junk.  Now I can go junking and not worry about it.
---
Hey.....I think I just bought a bunch of plans from you about 2 hours ago. 
---
Cool camp, BTW!
---
If you are being forthright on what was fixed, you could try not being disingenuous with it. 
---
They fixed a "glitch" that allowed people to have wallpaper on both sides of internal walls after ignoring 2 years of people asking for internal walls. They also removed the way to do round buildings, a lot of cantilever market stall roofs, in fact almost anything creative. 
---
Yes, this does limit floating camps, but at a huge cost of work around for what should be in the base game. "Great."
---
Seems you got touched by your daddy Todd.
---
I know how you feel just got out the pool and then this crap happens.
---
Empathy? A large company took money from us and then consistently underdelivered in product. Fuck everyone at Bethesda even remotely linked to 76 at this point. Do some actual development of the game.
---
i like your attitude more than i like this game!
---
Nope. Sorry.
---
Only transfer possible was between Bethesda launcher to steam
---
If you could do that, selling it in bulk would make you more cap value than these rewards.
---
Are you sub-83? You APPROVE of Beth's behaviour? Ruin what? A FUCKING HAT?
---
It's another missed opportunity by Beth. I'll be using my steel for ammo as usual. Sorry everyone.
---
What's that even mean? Teslas kill everything expect "bosses".
---
In a game I PAID FOR, I want to rush everything if I want to. I want the endgame gear as soon as I can if I want to! I don't need that developers tell me to no keep playing for the rest of the day so I must log in EVERY SINGLE DAY. It looks like a damn job and not like a game, I'm done repeating the same quests and events.
---
I can't think of any other supposedly AAA Game where youtubers and streamers are allowed to show footages or even stream live gameplay on a PTS, this fact alone says enough about how 'seriously' Bethesda takes this test server stuff...
---
God can someone chuck in the Backwoods Bungalow real fast and see if the collision mechanic is fixed? Ie can you hang pictures inside on the 'walls' and can you still jump into it and open peoples unlocked ammo machines despite the front door being locked..... Not that I do this...... :S......... ;)
---
Stuck at work for another 6 hours and need to know....
---
Probably already done to death but 
---
u/BethesdaGameStudios_
---
u/LadyDevann
---
Back to the pool for you then
---
Good luck on all that cooking. So many of the recipes require so many ingredients in such large quantities that it's just plain not worth it to bother making them considering how meager the buffs from most are. It's kind of a shame.
---
No i usually only play solo.
---
TIL there is a chicken coop!?
---
Yeah seems like it.
---
While I wholeheartedly agree that the XP system needs a major rework when it comes to parties and events, it is so easy to share kills at Line in the Sand currently. It seems like there's always at least one person there that will do the tent trick, and then all you need is any explosive weapon. If everyone just shoots at the ground, you come away with a few levels and 2000+ lbs of weapons to scrap. No need to use a hacked gun to grind efficiently there.
---
So, yeah. The dude was just an asshole, OP. My petty ass is glad you managed to get him to kill himself atleast once.
---
Yeah but the point is, i pick up ammo to convert. I am mostly melee, so the ammo i pick up is intended to convert. So the options still suck for me. I either have to wait to pile up ammo and convert it in bulk or still be stuck in an annoying process that arguably just got made even worse.
---
If u cant kill at least one / join a lobby with a friend
---
Plus it seems like half of every server I'm on has a survival tent so I imagine first of getting them a nice influx as well.
---
I regret that I have but one downvote to give to your stupid post.
---
We will never know of we actually met the goals since the pr of the goals failing would not be favorable, but i have seen many many people say they arent donating because the rewards are terrible, and many more people who dont like the cumulative rewards
---
Private server is so much fun. Everything is there when you log in. You don't have to deal with someone else clearing an area right before you get there. Perfect for grinding materials.
---
And yes the scrap box is lovely.
---
You don't, bethesda goofed again.
---
Bethesda said thats its all fixed. But for some reason. They think I can't login to my account on there stuff. But I emailed back telling them its not my account on there just can't even launch the game no response yet
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣😅
---
No longer making any purchases within this game until building goes back to the way it was before this patch. Ruining building techniques is literally alienating the ones that buy ATOMIC SHOP items. But, who listens to the players any more? amirite?
---
They are investigating this currently from what their twitter said.
---
I also can’t enter the mine :( I am on Xbox so seems global.
---
Was that a whale song I just heard? Majestic!
---
Ok hopefully they can fix this thanks.
---
Ive always thought it seems like super mutant suiciders deal more damage than the mini nukes launched in this game. I use to love blowing stuff up with mini nukes in previous fallout games.
---
the previous iteration was tedious but underatanfable. now i have to remember how much of each ammo i have or else i keep getting the "looks like you need more ammo of the given type!" screen. CONSTANTLY. if i dont have the ammo to do this, WHY IS IT EVEN AN OPTION?
---
who the hell tested this and said "yes this is better"?
---
He sounds like the same voice actor as the raider punk
---
Todd Haberkorn I think.
---
Not the right Todd.
---
Their support also just locks tickets asking for help or reporting bugs.
---
Absolutely. Revoke your money from Bethesda and bitch. I haven't bought a Fallout 1st subscription or any atoms, and I certainly ain't doin' it now.
---
I’ll make one now never tried it.
---
I really hope they stop with the bug fixes that don’t need to be fixed. Next they’re going to fix the flamethrower and terminal bugs I bet.
---
Nowhere not even trying
---
I really only have one other game which is destiny 2 and it hasnt happened to that game.
---
It’s adding tweaks and the dude who posted this looks like he got mad or is disappointed that Bethesda is trying to fix something
---
Yeah, I know right, why would anyone post content related to Fallout 76 to the Fallout 76 subreddit for people who come here for content related to Fallout 76. It's crazy right?
---
Unyielding armour? check/repair the armour, apparently there is another bug.
---
Yep. Infuriating. It also shows the game as "installed", gives me a "play now" button, lists all of the so-called achievements I've earned - because I ALREADY BOUGHT IT. Tested several other games, all fine. This is a FO76-patch-related issue. Nice job, team.
---
\*edit\* well crap, a few more games are having problems too. Looks like Steam, not Bethesda. My bad.
---
I am sorry but this one made me laugh out loud. They made it so you can´t exit the terminal and now you need to die to be able to play again? This is the cherry on the top of the malarkey (to keep it civil) ice cream.
---
I'm pretty sure they will come out with another article saying "CONGRATS EVERYBODY THE MILESTONES HAVE BEEN MET! HERE ARE THE &gt;!FAKE!&lt; STATS" anyways.
---
Look into your heart, you know that the answer to whether or not those bugs are fixed is "no".
---
Scrap box and private world are worth it if you play quite a bit. However, I think right now not subscribing to fallout 1st would send a strong message to bethesda that they need to fix and actually play their games and get more in touch with the community.
---
Sounds almost exactly like Todd Haberkorn/Raider Punk.
---
I doubt it. Sure it’s possible, but not likely to happen now especially with new content supposedly still in the works
---
Ok so I finally exited. The only way to exit is to spam the back button until you get to your first conversion. Unfortunately I had spent like a 10 minute session converting all my unused ammo. So I wouldn’t convert more than one type of ammo at a time unless you want to spend 20 minutes spamming back
---
nope, this was a deliberate change. Its in the patch notes.
---
Are you going to use it to store your two bobby pins and can of dog food?
---
Thanks! Let me know when your on and ready to place.
---
I think they are part of the 180 item rule. I haven’t farmed lead in a few days but they seem to always work for me. Have you been picking up other junk between these lead farming runs?
---
Yup. At least that’s how it was for the clean up Appalachia event
---
You can hold the exit button to immediately exit the terminal.
---
Is this a fucking joke? I know this should feel like a big deal but I’m PISSED. Unless I’m missing something - I’m not understanding what the point of alienating the building community like this was. Like no joke, it’s just a game but damn I’ve literally taken so many of the glitches and content issues in stride. To me camp building was literally one of the few things that brings me back to the game when I’m fighting burnout. Talk about being completely out of touch with your player community.
---
EDIT: yeah so talked to my fiancé and we’re probably done, at least for awhile. May not get around to cancelling both of our FO 1st subscriptions right this second, but we will at some point in the next week. 
---
Listen, on the off chance any devs or community managers ever see this post (doubtful), here’s the deal. I work with tech companies  at my job and see quite a bit of client facing stuff. You guys are either incapable or unwilling to work with your community to make this game better. There’s just a pattern of being out of touch with us that’s hard to invest in and whether it’s your intention or not, the community frankly feels like you don’t give a shit. Video games are a fun outlet and for those of us who work (I’m guessing your fallout first community right?), it’s super annoying to get this like half assed effort all the time. I give a lot of leeway to fallout bc of the engine you run but the service stuff is just too much to deal with. If you want us back - you need to expand your community relations team and treat this client an actual mmo. To give you a working analogy, I’m not going to pay for postmates every month if they either don’t show up half the time or the eat part of my order and proceed to ghost me on my response, but then in the context of ignoring my complaints, change the app and make it more difficult to use. Like not following the logic. You’ve got a loyal fan base and trust me you’ve pushed the limits, but you’re for sure not going to keep us long term with this lack of community support/engagement.
---
With that, on the equally small chance that this message reaches others in the fallout community that are frustrated - you guys are awesome. I had a blast playing with you and hopefully will come back one day with some changes. Definitely one of the more fun communities player wise we’ve had the privilege of gaming with. Cheers and wishing you all the best.
---
I though I was the only one getting legendary  rolling pins.
---
It is funny! But it’s sad too. How can they not implement something as simple as an exit button or option you know?
---
 sweet little lies todd
---
#
---
I just moved my camp, dammit. Was planning on building some more stuff.
---
Thought I tried that lol
---
I had a message pop up up on my PS4 that told me the game was corrupted after the update.
---
Might be a problem with some of those update files.
---
I pulled a total of 2500 from my scrap box. Wish I would've paid a little more attention to the rewards before I dumped that much into it. Wasn't expecting anything phenomenal, or even great, but to get nothing that I couldn't get from playing for 15 minutes or less was a bit disappointing.
---
Best thing I got was plan for prime gatling reciever. Which I thought I knew, but it didn't say (Known). Used it. Got a message about already knowing the plan. Plan was gone from inventory.
---
11/10 would try again.
---
this post sums my experience. I would play this game all day if not the caps/scrip/gold you name it limitations. Im sure most of the player base has the same opinion on this as me and you.
---
It isn't consistent. I have friends that can play games I can't, and I have games they can't play. It also doesn't affect most games.
---
Oh shit thank you! You need to post this
---
So the rewards are all garbage for an end game player pretty much. I thought there would be new plans. Guess ill save all my scrap and not waste it on this event. Thnak you so much for this list.
---
No mention of the other misc mods like ultra light either
---
How about a fallout 1st boycott as well!
---
Add 3 more 0s and it'll actually be fair. Sincerely no facetiousness. Anybody that has a system even running the game that long should get more than half the latest camp bundle with a single good item. At that point the game should be their bitch, not the other way around as designed.
---
Steel is incredibly easy to get and I don’t even really feel like fast-traveling to Atlas to donate it. It’s good to see that the rewards at least help newer players.
---
Correct, it's not about a timeline it's about the statement.
---
I mean, obviously we want it to work, but colossal problem has already been delayed at least once, maybe twice. That's frustrating especially because we didn't get any warning it wasn't going in until the day the do the update....
---
If you participated in present event (or game in general) you probably have all the plans already and other rewards are a couple of aid items and booze
---
I dont even care about the BOS or their stupid fucking little hat and I just want my 8k steel back.
---
# Todd and the sweet little lies
---
Maybe. Maybe not.  
---
A lot of things will factor into the decision for the future of this game in the event that they aren't making enough money. I think that this is simply a short-term money printing machine that only needs to last until it inevitably dries up and the next one is ready. By the time any collective action is taken (or this venture isn't as profitable as they *need* it to be) they will quickly wash their hands of it rather than attempt to salvage a sinking ship when their next projects already visible on the horizon. High risk, minimal reward. The reputation is already too tarnished to be a top-tier moneymaker.
---
Honestly.. I really doubt the game will be around long enough for another roadmap to be released (assuming it even lasts until the end of this one). I just hope someone is so enamoured by what *could have been* and makes it for themselves, so that something great could be born from the ashes of this dumpster fire. 😔
---
Yet another absurd missing piece of content that I just don’t understand.
---
It's a Steam-wide issue that is negatively affecting all Bethesda games. My advice would be to wait it out.
---
It always did that. Hold B on Xbox to exit terminal or equivalent button on ps4, ESC on PC will quit any terminal or workbench instantly.
---
Welcome to their business model.  This will all continue as long as people keep throwing money at a broken game and a fallen company.  I paid full price for this at beta, and I will never preorder another bethesda title again, after playing these games since Morrowind.  They have been relegated to the category of games and companies I do not trust.  I may play them at some point, but will only buy a used copy from a reseller a year or more after release when it's in the bargain bin, so they get nothing from the sale, and I can return it to gamestop if need be.  I have never purchased any atoms/subs or paid mods from their CC store, and never will after seeing the direction this cash grab company is taking.  I refuse to support this business model they have adopted, and in the long run hope it hurts them and their Hutt investors that greedily thought they would get away with this with everyone.  They don't care what you say about them on a website, and are laughing at you.  Speak with your wallets, people...
---
Do you mean atoms? But yes I agree as a Blue Ridge Caravan Enthusiast. It would also make sense because, logically, all the goods BRC transports weigh a ton (hence the Brahmins) along with bandits attacks so PA is killing two birds with one stone.
---
the dumb cunts at Bethesda fucking up the game as usual.
---
Todd Howard stole them for starfield.
---
I feel like I had just gotten used to the old crappy UI for ammo conversion and they do this. I'm not trying to pretend to know shit about game programming but this seems like such a simple thing that is just terrible.
---
No one knows how much of each ammo type they want to dump, we just want to dump everything we don't use.
---
Who's ever going to sell 300 mini nukes at a time?! They weigh 6lbs each! The fact that's even an option is just....god.
---
I just don't use stairs.
---
Yes obviously atoms.  Sorry.
---
Oh jeez, really? Good grief.
---
Ubisoft lost every single smidgen of respect I had for them after all the sexual assault accusations came up. Their entire corporate structure was build to hide powerful sex offenders. Seems that's just the norm for any company these days. Don't give a shit about your customers or your employees, just make bank.
---
Thanks for the link now I know that I dont have to buy it again.
---
You posted the same joke twice so genuinely thought you were lost.
---
Like, Bethesda, I'll do the model, I'll write the code, I want one so bad
---
I'd you are a bloody build check your health. When you die and respawn your health goes up some... Also buffout and bufftats do that as well. Also try taking your armor on and off and if you have need rage equipped check your stats to make sure it is working. If not you have too much health.
---
The event drops literally nothing that I want/need. I don't know who this content is intended for, but endgame players ain't it.
---
Now, if Earl dropped a fix for the damn VATS bug, that'd be a different story.
---
I don’t think it works anymore cuz of the patch
---
Some bugs are good bugs and these ones that benefited builders' creativity should be at the bottom of that bug fix list.
---
I’m sorry but isn’t video games supposed to wear down free time? Although I understand where you coming from with all the daily limits, caps, etc. and agree.
---
The joke was I repeated it on purpose
---
Thank you so much for helping me. Its perfect and I love it
---
"Hey can we have that asset that you already have from Fallout 4 since you just ported everything else?"
---
"okay... for $12 tho lmao"
---
Bethesda be like: fast travel glitch? Nah. Strobe light in the chicken coop? Absolute priority.
---
I think we have to come to terms that any new content going forward is likely to come from the atomic shop. And that’s a real fucking gut punch.
---
We can call it a bug but you know they don’t fix blatant bugs.
---
Are you using chems that boost your strength or health? If so that may be the culprit.
---
Yeah, the response I got from Bethesda's support was less than helpful, and I let them know in my reply, especially since the last ticket I put in the support was really good. Glad to see that, in this instance, the twitter department at Bethesda is better informed than tech support lol.
---
Who-what? Go virtue signal somewhere else. In fallout lore, enclave are the baddies because they are fascists. Whether they are led by fascists in 2076, 2103, or 2250 makes no difference, they've always been the game's variant of a totalitarian, genocidal government.
---
In FO New Vegas, they are the remnants because their mommies and daddies got their asses kicked by our hero from FO2.
---
Did i mention his gender orientation had anything to do with it? Remind me next time to get a "PC APPROVED" pass from you when I want to chat any Fallout lore that isn't sunshine and ponies.
---
What junk item is for that one?
---
No not until patch 22 they keep delaying it after complaints in pts
---
It seems the only things that get fixed are things that make the game more enjoyable at Bethesda's expense hmmmmmm
---
Might be related.
---
I had an awful evening of crashes,lagging,fast travel timing out, and blue screens on PS4.Never had it this bad before.
---
First time ever i have had a message appear, telling me the game was corrupted,and needed a fresh install.PS4 even spat the Disc out.
---
My point is some of those update files might be causing problems right across the board.
---
They care more about your fo1st than the pretend resources
---
You can use the back button to go back to converting more ammo of the same kind. It’s not worse if you know how the terminal works.
---
Yeah but like a battered victim of domestic violence I still believe things will change....
---
That way when we are under our numbers we can "rally" the last day.....got enough booze and shut plans ill be sitting this one out.
---
That and the stair case from FO4. That's all I want. I want a stair case that meshes into an upper floor without leaving a big wide gap.
---
I always place my survival tent at Foundation and I usually see one every other time logging on.
---
Why it was fixed: "Interior Wall: 600 atoms"
---
Also Ultralight!
---
I mean its my favorite look bag, I wouldn't had bought the pot of gold or parachute if I knew this was on its way. Anything Vault Tec is always cool especially if its free.
---
Yeah, it's the stupid sale that's going on. Just don't do anything hasty like uninstalling the game. I've seen people across every Fallout reddit doing the very same thing when it's not an issue on their end
---
Nope. It COULD be that health bar overlapping the rads glitch. That's all I can think of
---
It’s a public test server. Why wouldn’t people be able to stream? Any PC player has access. When it was a private test server this was not allowed. 
---
I don’t really understand your comment at all.
---
Well, I mean obviously I didn't know you could hold down the button/key to exit. If you can tell me where it says that, by all means do so. The help page says "To exit a terminal or terminal page, press B". Super useful. /s
---
So can my SS armor that's well over 600 on resistance. Plus it's so easy to be OP and melt through enemies.
---
These rewards aren’t even worth 250 steel, they aren’t even worth the 250 caps that steel is worth
---
You're on the right track here. If they'd filled them with useless but fun items like fireworks or maybe lunchboxes that don't give xp, just the small bonus like confetti mess, people wouldn't be nearly so upset about them.
---
Same for me. Besides Fallout 76 and Fallout 4, other related games are now listed on my Library page as requiring "Purchase", even old games like Morrowind, Fallout 2, and Fallout Tactics.
---
Boycott Fallout 1st!
---
You could think of it as a “good” deal for the atoms itself, but the scrapbox I’ve grown to can’t live without it.
---
Put them in vendor for 25-50 caps they go quick or sell them on the sub for trading stuff.
---
Sorry, mate. Rule Eight.
---
Got a good one for you.
---
Let me tell you about Bethesda support. A few weeks ago i was playing alone and had problems logging in my private world after a disconnect so i opened a ticket.
---
&gt;**Question Subject:** I was playing in a private world, lagged out, so i closed the game, tried to log back in and now i can´t log back into my account.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Already restarted the system but it didn´t work, the game launches but i can´t log in.
---
This is the answer i got from the "support" :
---
    Greetings,
---
    Thank you for contacting Bethesda Support!
---
    Beginning with Update 16, there is a new button in the Private Worlds mode on the Play Screen so that Private World owners have more choice in how friends can join their World.
---
    
---
    Team Only: When "Team Only" is enabled, only the Private World owner and players they have already formed a team with can enter the Private World.
---
    All Friends: Switching to "All Friends" will allow any players on the Private World owner’s friends list to enter the Private World.
---
    You should see an option to toggle between "Team Only" and "All Friends." Please ensure you and your friend(s) have the Private World set to "All Friends" unless you are already in a Team, then you can select "Team Only."
---
    If you are still experiencing this issue after performing the above, please provide the following information:
---
    How often does this occur?
---
    Were you part of a team on the Private World?
---
    Were you the group leader?
---
    What setting is the world set to?
---
    Thank you for your continued interest and support!
---
    Kind Regards,
---
    Bethesda Support
---
As you can see they talk about teams, friends, private worlds, update 16 and NOTHING about my problem that was not begin able to log in my account. That is Bethesda support for you.
---
Find a low level player in power armor and drop them a ridiculous amount of the cores, give a thumbs up and map away before they can react.
---
Right, so the system sucks, but it's my fault. Got it. /s
---
I donated 500. Will maybe do another 1000. Just equipped scrapper perk for first time. It helps a lot!
---
It could be. So many factors can be causing that. Good luck on finding the solution.
---
Building is the only thing that has kept me in this garbage game for so long. Now they are needlessly nerfing that while many serious and game breaking bugs exist. Just who in the hell is running things at Bethesda?
---
Sell them cheap or drop them
---
I bet the floating wall/double wall fucks with their internal/instance CAMP function and that’s why they “fixed” it now.
---
No, I just had some upper floors that were a few feet above the terrain; I snapped the iron posts onto them and they used to be able to just place with the bottom part of the post going through the ground.
---
Now it won't place if any of the post is going into the ground at all.
---
Whats the fallout 1st glitch?
---
No, but don't waste your time with lead nodes anyway. There is one place in the far south of the Savage Divide with acid and lead, but honestly, one run in the Luck Hole Mine and a quick 30 minute tour of Sunken Trainyard/Tanagra Town/Toxic Larry's/Dolly Sods should give you more acid and lead ore for smelting than a dumb extractor would get you in a day.
---
Just build your camp wherever you like and don't worry about resource nodes.
---
Ha I feel your disappointment  and anger I have been there many times my friend. Hopefully it works out for you
---
I just yeet them into the air and pretend theyre fireworks just to get rid of them
---
Even though you have a year subscription I believe it renews on a certain day of the month each month. I upped my monthly to a year right as it was to switch to charge for a new month and it took about an hour and a couple resets before it refreshed to show I was a FO1st member. If that is not the case and you have already waited, I would open a ticket.
---
Well looks like I'm not coming back to this game anytime soon.
---
...Or stop picking things up if you don't need them.
---
(Then people who do need them can pick them up.)
---
Through the Bethesda support site
---
Don’t worry, limited time bundle for 2,000 atoms will include double sided walls
---
A "community" game like this should give us mechanisms to push back the brotherhood.  
---
Imagine an alternative. The "community" could rally its resources and fight the brotherhood rather than donate.... let us dictate the terms of our world.
---
Considering that some of these rewards are level locked, I’m certain that by the time they reach the level to unlock anything even half decent, they would’ve already unlocked something better
---
Don't pick them up. Especially if their still in the generators that are found all over the map, leave them for the next person. Sell them cheap, give them to new people, I always needed a few before I figured out how much better against rads the stealth suit is.
---
Yup that was my experience when I first contacted them about the auto complete bug they assumed it was a completely different issue, now they just auto lock my tickets without even an automated response anymore, locked the second it's been posted now!
---
I already tried to uninstall and reinstall and it just fkin disappeared from my inventory
---
going to the buy page states that I own the game though
---
I have no fucking clue holy shit
---
Help?  I don't need help...I've got AMMO!
---
Thank you to all the helpers and kind people in the wasteland. It’s hard to trust anyone anymore. I’ve been brutalized idk how many times, killed over and over until I finally hop servers. 🙄
---
Please come back with a better response that isn't you throwing a fit because you think I'm SJWing Fallout.
---
*"gender orientation"*, lmfao.
---
Yea but if u FT or switch weapons u have to reequip  the fireworks. But yea super reload speed for nothing? I’ll take it.
---
Nobody will AFK for an entire year for 76 dollars of currency in a game most people hate
---
I honestly hate to see this is apparently not just limited to me having issues
---
I hate when they "fix" camp build techniques. Stop ruining my fun when shit all else to do in this game now.
---
Sell them. I literally never see them for sell.
---
If you cancel it, does your in-game First benefits immediately expire or carry over to the 10th, like in your case. I assume the day of the month you subscribed?
---
I'm just about wrapping up my 1 month of Fallout 1st and I was able to delete **TWO** mules worth of items from the cleared up junk/stash space. That, plus the tent, it's clearly P2W.
---
Now new people feel my pain after having the shitest release since Sim City and nutering the only fun end game activity PvP
---
I dig the Blue Ridge Caravan Company and would be stoked for a power armor skin based on them. One of the few things I can think of that would get me to stop using Nuclear Winter paints. I also want Eugenie as an ally at my camp. You just don't know what a lover's embrace buff is until you get it from a ghoul.
---
Pretty sure different things spawn for differnt people...
---
125 million*
---
Just FYI: Scorchbeast meat can be found in Scorchbeast nests. There are two in Watoga, though one is a bit harder to reach.
---
That isn't entirely true. If you got to the main menu through an option on the converter, the B button would actually just back out. I never new holding was even a thing.
---
Bugged as no longer under armor
---
How does one vendor ammo? The option never shows up for me.
---
Take a picture submitt a ticket and you will recieve a refund and keep the product
---
Good news is, about 20 other people already have
---
Apparently you can hold the exit button, haven't tested it out for myself though.
---
No need to necessarily panic. Steam is just having a very temporary stroke. If it says you own it, then you will be able to reinstall it once Steam stops foaming at the mouth, which should be soon
---
Oh what a surprise, all the shit that’s somewhat good is locked behind real money
---
Yo i prob been to mono once since the game been released. Im excited ill be getting reason to go there again. Also for you wall issue, Flamethrower + brick walls
---
Todd.
---
Just my opinion....don't waste your time.  Go to lucky hole mine wear Excavator armor, also do the quest Breach and Clear.  You will end up with a crap ton of lead.
---
50 cal is really cheap to make as in the materials required aren’t that bad. Put ammo smith and superduper. Craft maybe 4-5 times and you’ll get over 400 something ammo. 
---
I know because I used to get ammo for my bloodied 50 cal, and then for my 50 cal machine gun.
---
...and of course people downvote you. Man this sub is something else today.
---
Us.
---
Haha I might actually do that. Was hoping to make some caps off of em though. I farmed them at poseidon for like two hours while cleaning the house so I have like 30-40 I was hoping to sell. Makes up for all the steel and stuff I used to make a workshop.
---
How much would you buy em for?
---
I never even knew they had nests. I did try looking in the Watoga vendor on each server in case people had sold some, but only found lungs and brains.
---
I'm not exactly into building in this game, but I haven't heard this much outcry from the community over one specific thing in a really long time. 
---
Bethesda miiiiight want to think about this.
---
So, this is what they were working so hard on with these last two PTS patches they never bothered to supply patch-notes for. Breaking the already clunky and frustrating building system. Nice job Beth. Well done.
---
Who repairs stuff with materials these days??  Really? Like seriously? I think I’m sitting on 100 improved repair kits right now, in fact I sometimes have to delete them.
---
The game has been virtually unplayable for me since the update.
---
I have high speed,fiber optic internet.
---
Yet the lagging was so bad,that fast travel i was simply stuck in perpetual travel until restarting PS4.
---
I had 4 Blue screens collecting Lead at Lucky Hole.
---
Game crashed after Lode Bearing.
---
It was that bad that i had a message appear on my PS4 Pro telling me the game was corrupted and needed a Fresh install.The PS4 spat the game out of the console,i thought that was hilariously ironic.
---
No idea what they have done,but it is bad.
---
I was just trying to swap door locations because I bought the Nuka Cola door today. But nope... talk about buyers regret. I don’t want to change my whole structure just not move a door.
---
Expect some jobless teenagers and kids with tooooooo much free time telling you to play something else. Fuck them.
---
Removing every single daily limitations is a MUST.
---
Wow. That would have saved me SOOOOO much time in the past. Thanks a trillion!
---
Really? Wow ive never noticed. I usually dont stay on thise worlds tho
---
The grind is real.
---
But this is Bethesda.
---
Just increase the damned budget already. If there's more budget then people won't need use glitches. 
---
We know that besides the spawning in times, camps with over 100% have little to no impact on sever stability. 
---
The budget for the 21 workshops is rediculously high, and people hardly ever use these for actual building. 
---
Take half of the budget from each workshop and give each player an extra 20%.
---
If only we had some kind of in-game event going on wherein we had to collect *junk* to *fortify* some kind of location. Then we could maybe get some kind of new thematic C.A.M.P. item...
---
Fuck it, throw all the good stuff into Atomic Shop bundles, I guess.
---
Sorry mate, nobody cares.
---
Buying a second copy when it went on the steam summer sale. Todd's stash box mini game was getting old, they clearly don't want to allow us to easily swap items between our own fucking characters, and continue to refuse to increase stash box size to something reasonable. From there I filled all 5 character slots, and I max out vendor caps daily by selling serums that I trade to them.  It takes a little extra time, but I'm not reliant on the hope that someone will visit my vending machines any longer.
---
It expires a month after the date  you bought it
---
The trashman lol
---
You can't sell them to the robots. Put them in your own vending machine for 50 caps and they'll sell like hot cakes.
---
I'm just waiting for some duper to solo donate the 100mil
---
Atop Watoga civic center is one nest (a supermutant now patrols near it).  The other I think requires you to go to the to of the municipal building and jump down to a damaged catwalk and crossover to another building.
---
Your method... it just works!
---
I am another one with this annoying problem.
---
Pretty sure this is a consequence of brilliant work  with patch 21 (just launched).
---
Well I'm not farming them or the queen specifically and I haven't been playing for such a long time so I am only sitting on about 20 which I'd rather safe in case I can't repair something, most of the time I use them when lacking ballistic fiber but I guess my comment was a bit misleading it's obviously not just about repairs but also crafting itself whether it is camp-building, weapons, armor or just mods.
---
My 50k steel is in my scrap box
---
And you're offering what in return?
---
This is true my herd mentality kicks in and increases my carry weight when I initiated a group today.
---
Drop them. They will just take up stash space if you sell them in your vendor. 
---
I haven't bought fusion cores ever in this game.
---
I have the opposite problem. Every single time I relog I have less rads than when I logged out, and every time it's not enough to activate Nerd Rage. At least the perk is aptly named for what I feel when this happens.
---
This change wasn't in the PTS.
---
The Colossal problem event has become a Colossal Problem!
---
Welcome to the club I never can move my punji camp or add anything due to overbudget
---
Not things like fusion cores. I have frequently gone to places where someone has already claimed the core out of a fusion generator or whatever.
---
The loot on bodies is per person I think. but the loot/junk that's just lying around is first come first served.
---
It can get obliterated if you jump into a fresh world after you've picked up the loot in a given location, so that you can't double farm a location by server hopping. So I don't know what happens if you come to a pre-looted location and then server hop.
---
That is why I post here the way I do sometimes. For the people who can't scream it in their bosses face, just in case this is what is happening.
---
Alternately, if you're playing with a friend you can just aggro each other and have them destroy the walls for you. It's a little bit quicker than the flamethrower trap method.
---
Awesome, I had someone tell me you lost your tent and scrap box in-game as soon as you unsubscribe. Thanks for the info. Lemme know if anything changes, but I'll probably be cancelling mine first thing tomorrow.
---
Youre kidding? Well I wont be buying the bundle then. Ill buy the other two things I want separately and save some atoms. Thanks for the info. I was going to ask separately
---
Wait they delayed the event again?
---
Same here, I've got a few that say I need to purchase them and some that aren't visible at all. Checking the [licenses page](https://store.steampowered.com/account/licenses) confirms that these games are still tied to my account too. And one of the games saying that it's not purchased is Dark Souls Remastered so I don't think it's just a Bethesda thing
---
i dont think thats fair- the new ally quests were pretty amazing, especially the end of Beckett's. 
---
Also thoroughly enjoyed the Overseer and her missions.
---
I think some people just complain endlessly. It isn't the most perfect game but it is streets ahead of the other shit you named.
---
I think you guys are way too harsh on here.
---
Probably need to update mods
---
You got it backwards mate I've been talked down to threatened called all manner of homophonic and racial slurs just for using the PvP mechanic. PvP players found the God mode exploit early and reported it to Bethesda but you didn't care because it didn't affect you. But when food builds figured out that it did affect them you all  cried to Bethesda to get it patched. This is a taste of your own medicine hope you hate it.
---
Modders however managed to make them snap just fine. (except on PS4 due to the stupid restrictions they placed on mods)
---
Just dm me it if you can.
---
The true “reward” would be keeping your hard earned scrap and watching the Brotherhood fail.
---
Anyone else only able to interact with the duffle bag on the side panel? Only tried it once on one server but it wouldn't give me the loot menu when I put the cursor over the main top part of the bag.
---
Summer 2021*
---
Which are butt ugly. I like my wall wire glitch.
---
Thanks, I'm going to have to check those out. Sounds like a pretty cool thing to find out in the world.
---
Doenvote away but it doesn't make it less true
---
It's a steam issue dude. I know the game is full of bugs, but this apparently isn't their fault. Also, search the fucking sub before posting yet another thread about a common issue.
---
And I was just about to move my camp... guess I'm not now. I won't be renewing my 1st account again after this debacle. Guess this also means that no one should bother in buying anything from the Shop pertaining to camp building. Really ludicrous of Bethesda to screw camp building, especially after begging their players to send them photos of their most creative camp designs and showcasing those designs on their website.
---
Agreed but they already got my money for most of this event.
---
Beat me to it. My casual friends are lucky to get 1-2 a week between kids and work and spouses.
---
In fact, i would say the grind required by Fallout is anti casual if anything. Same with current iteration of Wow. I am a fairly hardcore gamer and i couldn't spare the time for WoW rep grinding currently required.
---
Thats why i hide them inside the roof and only have a part hang down to connect my cycling lights
---
I think my response was fine. I rebutted why my statement was not a wild take, and mis-wrote a word.
---
Usually prime for my 50...which sucks but it’s anti armor explosive 90% reduced weight so it’s perfect for queen fights
---
Can't even vendor them to avoid the dialogue option either. I hold until I get 6 then toss them as a stack, I save on dialogue windows but it's so dumb.
---
Best part is I intentionally didn't buy the plan for them because they're inferior to other explosives but I'm earning them anyway.
---
Thanks guy I’ve been rly helpful isn’t there kaleidopore in the deep where the Chinese are just west underground of white springs?
---
This double sided wall glitch didn't even give us more Camp budget it's just a work around so that we wouldn't have to have interior with exposed brick / metal / wood etc. Now just waiting for the other shoe to drop and Bethesda tries to sell us interior walls for 500 Caps, or sticks it into a 1200 cap bundle.
---
Highly unlikely. You are just getting lucky via RNG
---
Yeah I just rug glitched them on PS4!
---
Ah yes wasnt too sure why i put 1.2 instead of 125 in hindsight
---
I hope so... Been trying to get the backpack plan but so far no luck!... I rarely ever get to be part of that event on PC... Seems like noone ever does it, and when i start it myself noone ever joins
---
Games been broken since beta and anyone just now realizing how shitty Bethesda is and how deaf they are to the community has got their own issues.
---
Stop saying youre unsubbing fallout first, you shouldnt have been subscribed in the first place you whales.
---
&gt;I pay for 4 FO1st accounts. I understand being lazy. I could easily just run one and transfer junk around, but I like having easy drop off on the 20 characters I play. Yes, I log in to all 20, every single day, and at least do one or two dailies for each one.
---
What the actual fuck.
---
What paints can you get from nw anyway, currently?
---
My impression is that legendary rerolling would require more Scrip or Legendary Modules for the primary legendary bonus and less for the tertiary legendary bonus.  If you are rerolling 2 stars, then it better have a good legendary bonus.  If you are rerolling 3 stars, then it is better to just craft a new legendary item if it is Bullion equipment or buy a new one from a vendor.
---
It's like they looked at the problems people had with the original Ammo Converter and said "can we create all new ones? yes we can!"
---
Why, why, why does it now display conversion options you don't have the ammo to convert? The original machine only showed the ammo you had to convert. So if you didn't have the minimum amount of, say, missiles, missiles would not show up on the list. Now, you pick missiles, and you pick an amount to convert, and just have to hope you have enough for the transaction to occur. We shouldn't have to go into our inventory and write down how much ammo we have before using the damn converter! If I don't have 50 grenades, don't let me pick "50 grenades". Again, this wasn't a thing previously. They just made the thing even more tedious and stupid!
---
I sell mine for 20 or 30 caps, they take up so much stash space that I just want to get rid of them. People that use Gatling lasers will buy them
---
You mean you’d rather them be doing their jobs? Because the events already been delayed 2 or 3 times for months now. The content isn’t even that big that it should warrant months of delays.
---
I wonder if they intended to "fix" this, or if it was accidentally "fixed" when they fixed stuff like glitching through walls to the reactor room
---
I almost believed you were being serious until "God emperor Todd Howard" 😂
---
Hey, guys, it seems that clearing Steam's download cache fixes the problem. On Steam app, go to the main menu (upper left) Steam --&gt; Settings. Then click on Downloads. Finally, select Clear Download Cache. You will have to login again to Steam (so you will need to remember you login\\password!). But that fixed the issue for me.
---
Wrong sub, bud. Use the trade subs.
---
Did the same until they made QWAPA. That mod was a game changer. Good times..
---
Anyone who uses "food builds" unironically is a fucking idiot. Change my mind.
---
I would never build my camp anywhere that didn't have an incredibly unique unmarked landmark at it, especially not by those filthy Settlers.
---
Bethesda is said to have done this because the double-walls tend to increase server load. But if they really want to solve the server load problem, they shouldn't do it this way. Why don't they change the properties of walls so that players can either keep the look of walls or paint their favourite wallpaper? This method obviously saves the budget and is convenient for everyone, and solves the server problem at the same time. I can only say Betheada is really lazy, they can do nothing but subtract.  As a newcomer to this game not long ago, the enthusiasm for CAMP building was extinguished.  Good job, Bethesda.
---
If they think they have fixed the VATs rubber banding damage bug, they haven't.
---
Imagine if this is one of the possible causes of that camp building disaster we ended up with. They just change one number and the next day we find out the camp building system is even more broken than before.
---
Jk ofc, but with Bethesda you never know :D
---
Exactly! We have to write down a list of our ammo (with real pen and paper lol)
---
Yea you got it right, weird that it does not work for you. I'll set language to english and try again.
---
I'm stuck here too!
---
&gt; Raider Punk.
---
Pretty appropriate considering Russel is just a punk who's using robots, and now us, to do all the dirty work so he can look good and join the BoS.
---
Well its pretty easy to do by yourself. But iv made a pretty good cycle of running line in the sand, collecting everything, send out a follow me emote, and then scrap everything and run riding shotgun. Its pretty nice ive had like 4+ people do it the past few times.
---
You did! I was in a panic because I heard the vending machine bug was back but realized it was plans I posted.
---
Mods cared. It got removed, didn’t it?
---
What do y'all play on?
---
They fucked it up (surprise). It's not available yet.
---
Oh and don't get me wrong. I'm a complete hoarder. I don't think I've been able to fast travel for more than a year now.
---
In fact part of the reason I'm playing this game is to teach myself that I can just throw things away. I have enough trouble with that in my real life. Like I've got enough aid to feed an army. And I've got way more stuff in my real life house than I really actually need.
---
So yeah I noticed when somebody else is already picked up the junk.
---
Since I almost never use power armor learning to stop picking up the fusion cores was my first tough personal growth lesson. That and then many nukes I never use, because in fallout 4 they were so precious.
---
Yeah, I’ll help you out, I’m bed atm. DM me your IGN I’ll help you tomorrow. I know a lot more then I should
---
The thing is this update has already been delayed multiple times. This is just the straw the broke the camels back. And it’s just an event so like what are they doing if they cant get a simple event content drop ready for months? Is there even anyone working on the game at this point?
---
Sounds cult-ish. Im in
---
Why did you remove the double wall feature!?!?!? I mean I get the floating wall fix (because those [C.A.M.Ps](https://C.A.M.Ps) were eye sores tbh) but thanks to this "fix" the inside of my house looks like absolute garbage. I don't think anyone asked for this. Remember when people used to say "its not a bug its a feature"? Well this was one of those and a welcome one at that. Please at least make an interior wall set that will accept the wall papers on either side. I mean come on...
---
Also, you have to have the precise quantities of ammo on hand for each tier of conversion. Have 542 of 5.56? That is one bulk of 500 and and the rest you’ll have to do individually if you want the points. 
---
Between this and the actual conversion rates it’ll be easier to just farm t ammo that you actually need.
---
Oh, and it doesn’t recognise ultracite ammo or cores of any description. Awesome.
---
Meh. Just entitled whiners that think they don’t have to follow the rules while they’re a guest in someone else’s house.
---
Complaints about the game, criticism about Bethesda, etc; that’s all fair game.  But I f you can’t do that within the structure of the forum, then go somewhere else. 
---
You and I have both levied harsh criticism against Bethesda. It’s amazing we can do so within the rules, but some people can’t.
---
Man, this is not the same Bethesda that created masterpieces like Fallout 3 or The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. This bunch of assholes now want to get new Minecraft (they care too much about the clunky camp system) and Fortnite players (nobody asked for a damn time limited season pass or a batle royal mode like Nuclear Winter, this game is a joke, a fucking boring GRIND FEST with daily limitations like a mobilephone game).
---
If any other company would have made Failout76 it would be muuuuuuch better, I'm 100% sure now. Is like come on, the old Bethie would have cried if they see what they've become now.
---
Is sad and enfuriates me.
---
I tried my best to write something I figured the majority of players would relate to, so they’d comment and show that it is a bigger deal than just a single player, and it might actually grab their attention.
---
No. They'll just say they're adding new content to keep us buying atom shop content while we wait.
---
Ya, hopefully they let us customize both sides
---
 w/o as much penalty to budget
---
I don’t see what the big deal is here. Kinda childish to be this upset over an event that involves donating one of the most common resources in the game.
---
Theyre supposedly giving us the plan for the tenderize this time
---
Their priorities are shit and disconnected with reality. Most bugs is a major game ever, every update has a major delay and we are only getting a single big update a year or two at this rate for a game they want you to play daily, the end game grind is trash in challange, variety, and gatekeeping, PvP is good when fair but has been ignored and nutered, weight issues make this game feel like weight simulator.
---
When it works it's great, but the problem is bugs, lack of content, boring content, regressive or pointless updates, and terrible quality of life drive everyone away eventually.
---
Even though I’m enclave through and through, I was going to do the thing since it’s new content and good rewards (at least I thought). Turns out the rewards are shit and I need the materials to craft secret service armor since that relies on RNG and I still don’t have a good set. Fuck that event. I’d rather no new patches and new content come out until they fix the multitude of broken stuff. And (I can’t believe I have to say this) ACTUAL broken stuff. Not camp walls.
---
I tried using them - 
---
They do very little damage if you do get anything with one
---
They take ages to go off, whatever you threw them at will almost certainly not be there when they go off
---
For how useless they are, they weigh far too much to bother with
---
If have to go through a stupid confirm dialogue to drop them 
---
I can't sell them
---
I can't put them in the ammo machine
---
They are garbage.
---
Seems to now be an outfit. (Isn’t that what the BoS groupie at Atlas is wearing?
---
You are a life saver my friend. Keep doing the lord's good work.
---
Honestly?
---
I'd prefer if the REAL Bethesda worked on this game.
---
Not this tiny Austin "branch" or whatever it is.
---
Sure, it'd still be a buggy mess, but it would definitely have a lot more fun in it.
---
You can see them all on here, but the Slocum's Joe (rank 29), Pink Sprinkle (44) and Inferno (65) are all really nice, better than anything I've seen in the shop imo. The Inferno paints are the best ones in the game for me.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer_rank
---
It has taken me a long ass time to get my steel and lead to an acceptable level as a heavy gunner.
---
If they think I'm going to dismantle all of that to be given a fucking frag grenade or a single stimpack they can think again.
---
That shit I throw out of my inventory as soon as I'm given it as quest rewards.
---
I find scrap to be way more valuable then the vast amount you can get on that list.
---
Also I only actually have like 300 cork. Won't be getting rid of any of that neither.
---
It was a bad take because children should not bear the sins of their father, and considering Arcade's gay, its monumentally tone-deaf to call him a nazi, even a *"former"* one.
---
I'm just not donating.  Now that I hear what's in the little reward boxes.. ya seems like that was a good choice.
---
I hope almost noone donates more then a time or two, and the event ends nowhere near the goal.  Wonder if that would even get their attention...
---
His model class is raider so yeah I think hes a raider who killed someone fresh out of vault 76 and took their jumpsuit and used it to get into foundation
---
Done and done. :)
---
I was able to create a double wall blueprint, but when I try to place it I get "Cannot place item: Selected item is floating"
---
Why in the fuck is the Microsoft store version a 49gb update? That's over half the game's entire size.
---
And is no use at all to anyone with 1st. You cant get scrap from your scrap box from a normal stash box.
---
Real talk, are they actually planning on adding this? Would it be a misc. upgrade?
---
They should’ve nukes ATLAS instead!
---
Damn. I've got a sort of homemade porch on my house using posts that clip into the ground, guess that's just another "legacy" aspect of my camp now. This update is fucking ridiculous.
---
It sucks so much, my camp was looking good until this. Now i have to start again with no interior rooms like so many of the shitty box camps i come across
---
In a bundle
---
where is the cache? I deleted the game and now it's gone, not in my library anymore.
---
Oh no. Glad I have the save everything mod
---
I know what you're talking about on ps4 someone did something similar but somehow was giving me rads at their camp on whitespring
---
So you thought adding hate would help?
---
I agree completely :p, just saying it was a 100% fix for my gf and I, and it’s amazing being able to fast travel again. We haven’t had the bug in weeks now.
---
Each update is worse than we think it can be.
---
This worked. Thanks!
---
Yea why do that? If ur just gonna recycle the rewards from other events anyway, why take out the newest plans from the last event?
---
Let's be clear, 1 or 10,000,000 of something in a scrap box is the same server load.  That's the idea of it, those things are simply counts not complex objects like a gun or some armor.  It's the latter that causes issues in huge quantities.
---
Being able to sell C.A.M.P. blueprints/templates to other players would be kinda cool. Although, they'd have to have some sort of process in place to filter out templates to buyers that don't have the required plans.
---
I would love to see them take down the servers, not in the sense that I don’t enjoy fo76, but the sheer blowback that would result. They dropped the ball on creation club and then gave us this half finished game which took them essentially two years to make half decent. If they stopped supporting it I guarantee you I would never buy another Bethesda game and so would a lot of other people.
---
Too much salt in your cereals, kid? What's your problem? Get the fuck out of here if you don't like my post.
---
Most players sell hella ammo for 1 cap a piece
---
Bug to report:
---
I just completed an Encryptid quest and was a conduit. After the event finished, my health still kept going down and I died and could not be revived. Even after dying, my health kept going down but I was taking no damage from any visible source. I quit the game.
---
I think missing all the other posts about it is a stronger indication of possible blindness.
---
IIRC, Roger Maxson’s version of the Brotherhood were actually altruistic and good, they did actually help people but it’s only in the later timeline where they became obsessed isolationists that they’re bad.
---
I'd like to see CD Projekt red take on a fallout game personally
---
No, those are fever blossoms if I remember correctly. Kaleidopore is only at Arktos.
---
No it's about the fact that they touted new content and rewards. They aren't rewards.
---
Glad to help. As a C.A.M.P.-building addict, I really just had to find out for myself if there was a way to live with this. Because, I'll be honest, without the ability to build freely, I will just go play the Witcher.
---
Particularly since they had repeatedly said the treasurer hunter event was going to repeat multiple times in different regions and it hasn't happened again.
---
&gt; BHVR
---
The hell has BHVR done lol. It's hard to actually pin point a problem with Dead By Daylight fromthe outside because everyone falls under being a Killer or Survivor. Both sides have it's boons and flaws, but people are blinded cause they play one more than the other and can't fairly judge the game's balance.
---
The only games I remember 505 Games being involved with is Naughty Bear and the Mobile port of Terraria.
---
So, a 2-D pixelated world, with cartoonish violence, and Ron the Narrator getting oddly excited by environmental kills.
---
Same, I used them to make my back porch look less floaty. And apparently this was a stealth change a while back too because I discovered this problem about a week ago, pre-Update 21 obviously.
---
I have 3 lol. I was a builder who did a lot of building for everyone and I’m so discouraged.
---
but before if you didn't have enough to sell for ammo points the option wouldn't be there. Now all options are there for all ammo. Hope you have a good memory.
---
 A Colossal Problem event has become A COLOSSAL PROBLEM!
---
It worked fine in the PTS?
---
Is it just me, or has the number of such posts increased a *lot* lately?
---
Honestly lmao. It's not even comparable.
---
Must be, literally had no impact on gameplay, was just a feature that allowed us to be more creative with camps and now it’s gone
---
Thanks you guy you’re the real MVP’s
---
While I agree with some of your points, me and many others still enjoy this game and we wanna see it grow and evolve and get better. Speaking with our wallets would only work if everyone did it, if only some people do it I could see them shutting down the game as more likely
---
Cool motive, still childish.
---
You mean calibrated shocks
---
No, my friend! You just had to follow the steps given in the Steam support page! I'll edit my post, but probably you just got bamboozled by Steam as there is the issue where it won't let you download it again until they fix it.
---
Lately Feed the People is just showing up and running out the click. No enemies attacking. Boooorrriiiiinnngggg......
---
Is it though? AT this point all their building ATOM shop things are prefabs
---
I quit this steaming pile of dog shit about 1 month after release.
---
So they were supposed to fix the bungalow and somehow in the process messed up the wall replacement options? I bet that is what happened.
---
Pretty sure you can buy the plans for it in the production wing of the Whitespring Bunker
---
I'm logging on now to test this.. I want to see if I can blueprint it and place it again, which would allow us to place it in other people's camps so they can do the same.
---
Like I said to someone else, if only some people stop giving them money it looks like the games dying and they have more incentive to shut it down. If people were to speak with their wallets everyone would have to do it
---
I usually give them to low levels with Raider PA or just the frame
---
This has happened a dozen times before, you all unsub and then sub again 2 weeks later
---
I just got the scout forest and urban scout masks along with 3 jumpsuits after uranium fever..!
---
As sure as this patch is awesome.
---
My base is a legacy now
---
If that increases my weight capacity then yeah. I can't get in the power armor because I'm constantly overcombered. So is there a mod that maybe makes the armor weigh less, or a perk or something, can you lead me to it?
---
why....would you do that? Just put a door way and a fucking door, then walk through the door, i don't understand.
---
Yes, you can mod the backpacks as well
---
Ive no intention of participating any further at this juncture.
---
There is another backpack you can get that's a LOT easier to get while your grinding the tadpole quests. Go to the morgantown airport building, go to top floor and you get the Small backpack plan from that. It can be used with all Mods and skins. It's what I'm using.
---
Sharing is caring!
---
I uninstalled steam and installed it again, now the game is back, but I need to download it again. Thanks
---
Like...today? With this patch? Or...earlier?
---
Congrats on being mistake free!
---
The main thing then is likely that you're trying to do too much with your build rather than really focusing in on a single spec.  
---
For some tips, I highly recommend using the Chinese stealth armour. It's by far the best option for stealth until you get a perfect set of legendaries. Good resistances, good enough for nuke zones and the cloaking effect is insanely strong.  
---
For dealing with ghouls, blocker is a really good perk to have.  
---
I'm running a similar playstyle, though using full-auto rifles. [Here's the loadout I'm running currently](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1d345ff&amp;d=s00pg2ph2pi2pp2p00eh2c62ce0ic4a72am2an2au2a00a30ao0lt2l12lu2lk2l71lv0&amp;m=51cfeb). I don't think it's completely optimal, but it's good enough that I can kill enemies in 1-2 shots with my fixer (non-legendary) without ever really being in much danger.
---
Crap I forgot about that.
---
Same for me. Red Dead and others
---
Saw a confirmation that tesla arcs from the ground are invisible. I think they were meant to be removed entirely in the PTS? Who knows anymore
---
They already got your money.  They don't care
---
Yeah it's gives the power armor a higher capacity. Is the xo1 calibrated shocks
---
What do you mean realistic interiors? You can have your interior walls look like the wood/metal materials which is pretty realistic...or use the wall papers that look like cinderblocks or brick or something. I'm guessing you mean you couldn't change the interior of a door frame into a wallpaper style, which means the doorframe and door would stick out like a sore thumb among the rest of your interior walls.

Fyi
---
Sitin’ on the toilet doo! doo!
---
The daily limits for a hardcore game, strict weight management for multiple of an item, and PvP engagement methods are some of the worst design decisions that exist in gaming.
---
October 23, 2018.
---
I hadn't thought of that! Excellent idea!
---
YOUR EDIT: Or, they could just take out he server whatever and make it single player. they are probably already working on it, for when they move on to the next thing. Or, like you said, like they said, they may just say -server offline- BUT....There are many bethesda supported online only games still supported?
---
heavy raider armor is super rare... try signal strength 200times and got 2 heavy plans.
---
because of the duped gifts the plans arent rare anymore.
---
also the raider PA plans once upon a time...
---
No it stays in the scrap box. You can take stuff out but can't put anything back in when it ends
---
This is why I made this post  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i3vu2x/incompetent\_devs\_of\_pointy\_haired\_bosses/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i3vu2x/incompetent_devs_of_pointy_haired_bosses/)

Tbh, a two shot flamer is pretty bad. I think a regular flamer might be better. I did some testing with it and it's barely comparable. With the same perks, I was doing 138 damage with a mutant's hitman's, and 34 + 34 with a two shot flamer. Even taking away the hitman's bonus, that's almost double the damage on just a mutant's flamer. The two shot seems to be doing less damage than a default flamer. It also provides almost no bonus, because the flamer's base damage is very low and it gets massive buffs from the attachments (which don't add to two shot)
---
Fyi 
---
No, the junk stays in the box and u can pull out the junk but can not put it back in
---
Thank you
---
I cant comprehend the thought process. It just doesnt work. It doesnt fucking work. I can only hope that they realized that it should have been a feature already so they removed it so they can give us the ability to put wallpapers on both sides of a single wall in the future. But that's asking too much from Bethesda I guess. I really dont think they play their own fucking game.
---
There, I changed it. Happy?
---
Yep. The nodes can’t be farmed by your account until in game time has passed or you have collected a set number of other things.
---
You can’t add junk into it but you can take out
---
I haven’t been able to check since I been away but my  shielded lining BOS underaromr fatigues I have on my alt is gone now? They just got rid of it as a under armor?
---
Jeez, got me there for a second! Let's just wait for the download then!
---
Do we have proof the items were added to the loot table? I mean the SS deep pockets say they are there and aren't, how do we know the drops were added?
---
Take your pick|
---
After getting the small backpack you should totally work on the Tadpole Scout quest though. The large backpack is 60 pounds unmodded.
---
One problem, my character is too lower level to get those two perks yet, and i don't have the brick set.
---
You forgot the ? since the post starts with a why

The only holotape you will need is the Missile Silo State holotape

Bethesda : Releases broken game.  
---
Fans : Bethesda fix your broken game and glitches!  
---
Bethesda : Fixes bugs and glitches.  
---
Fans : BETHESDA WTF WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?!
---
Seriously guys, it’s one or the other.
---
Good point, if it's not a bug would have been nice if Bethesda mentioned it in the patch notes.
---
Shut up and take my money! 😍💰
---
Get a full set of Thorn armor and kill Whitesprings robots. There's a spawn point for two low level ones that pop out every thirty seconds or so. People used to do this with Strangler heart armor but it no longer works
---
Sorry if I don’t have time to scroll through ALL the other posts master. For god sakes 👎
---
I see, but it's over 5k, ima need to grind for a hot minute
---
Needs more work, clicking 1000 times to convert ammo because it only does tiny stacks of it at a time is so fucking awful that I don't even bother using it.
---
well im prob gonna rack it up irrespective, so good to know
---
This is the way
---
real men play nude! with just grognak
---
Seems like you were closest to solution, I downclocked GPU and VRAM and I managed to play both of these games in one go for several hours without crashing. I'll play some more today and if no crashes occur, I'll start testing for better performance along with stability.
---
I took a break from this game right before the update dropped needless to say I'm extending the break 🤣
---
So make it a vendor similar to scrip where you out shit into the left side and get ammo and get ammo from the screen (vendor).
---
No problem 🖒
---
They "fixed" the interior wall bug, meanwhile they keypad on powered doors is still on the wrong side...      
---
Like, how hard would that even be to fix?  Just swap the texture from the front to the back...
---
I was really looking forward to that addition. Why would they even put that in the patch notes, and then not add it?
---
https://amp.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/c9njxj/where_to_farm_all_the_things/
---
I feel like they should make a internal wall that we can make houses feel more house-y. Also a spiral staircase and more beaten down walls if were living in a nuclear shithole
---
What happened this time
---
Love when they make the game more soul sucking and monotonous than it all ready is.
---
And the infinite loop of Heart of the Enemy
---
I know the titles sarcasm but there is a stash box right there at atlas
---
I can't remember if I have a camp on top of one of the tram towers, but I feel that's legacy now too.
---
I don’t always have to poop. But when I do, it’s on the clock.
---
They didn't listen. We wanted a slider to choose our own amount. We also wanted them to get their heads out of their assets and fix it to be usable in power armor. They couldn't be bothered though.
---
What if people physically picketed outside of their offices in Maryland or Austin? That would be wild.
---
Calling them ‘easy ways’ when you just were asking for exploits and glitches is quite transparent, son. 
---
Especially putting the words in quotations. I know that feels like a clever move, but it’s really not. 
---
It was amusing, though!
---
Honestly this would be hilarious if not a single milestone was reached for the event. Like rip brotherhood, we don’t want you here lmao

i believe it was free in the atom shop the last tile fasnacht was on
---
i was just looking for this too
---
I'm in.
---
oh Christ
---
I'm afraid to click the link
---
It was part of a limited time free bundle a couple of months ago. Bethesda put it out as a kind of "apology" for fucking up the Treasure Hunter event. I think it was part of other bundles though at some point because it wasnt the first time Id seen it Im pretty sure. Id say itll resurface again as it gets closer to valentines probably
---
So if it was an atomic shop item that means that even a friend cant build it in my camp for me?
---
You're joking
---
Even the bow exploit wasn’t fixed, still getting killed in nuclear winter by full auto explosive bows
---
Who is your favorite music artist?
---
Still can't use it in power armor. These devs shouldn't have jobs. They must be sucking Fraud Howard's dick to still be on the payroll.
---
What happen with one violent night? Last time I participated it was fine... I think
---
Yeah it was in the bundle they gave out since fasnacht was late. That may actually mean it was a one time thing.
---
👀
---
It's not updated in real time but [here](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events) may be updated from time to time.
---
Oh, did something happen? My game uninstalled its self and after the reinstall, it completed all the challenges and keeps crashing. 
---
i really have no reason to play fallout. this might be it for me.
---
edit: I cancelled my fallout 1st membership. I'm moving on to a different game. goodluck with this pile of steaming garbage. it's been fun.
---
It's got about a 30 pound carry buff. So about half of a normal backpack. And it can be modded as normal. It's considered armor like the tadpole backpack
---
it's the norm for too many. it's nauseating ...
---
He is commenting that most AAA games use a Private Test Server and are more protective of what the next patch will have: not broadcast it

I got no mods.

---
"ATX"?

More whining
---
Jesus Christ, it's a piece of entertainment. Settle down
---
I guess I'm never moving my C.A.M.P...
---
Wait what? I have trouble changing a doorway to a wall for the double wallpaper trick but it didn’t work. I thought it was just a server issue and restarted 😭
---
&gt; Sbq still broken.
---
She has a specific perk applied to her, it's intended. I'm sorry to disappoint anybody who thinks they will be able to cripple her again
---
&gt; More weapons have been removed than added.
---
Weapons? You mean legendary weapons? Only 3 are removed from the loot pool and the only effects that had any removal were double and explosive, and they've introduced 12 or so new weapons that can be legendary since launch
---
&gt; No one asked them to raise the ammo point limit and that went from 2000 to 100,000. 
---
You must be new here in that case
---
&gt; Everyone that has ever played the game knows 150 script is ridiculous yet here we are hitting the limit 30 seconds after logging in.
---
And everybody who plays this game also knows time gating is an intentional design choice to make up for their lack of end game content, and it's not going away any time soon
---
&gt; So next time there is the option to take the piss u best believe I will be. Ill dupe everything and give it away for free. I've played nicly for 18 months only to be shat on. Ive seen 5 people in the last week, under lvl 200 running about with explosive plasma gatling guns. So I guess being banned was just another 1 of their lies. At least if I do get banned ill be free from this fucking nonsense.
---
I mean, you are right. They aren't going to do anything to you. Feel free I guess? You're here complaining about the game being broken, so you're going to go break it even further as some kind of revenge or whatever. Cool, cool
---
Yea and now you cant switch from wall to doorway or window you got to rebuild it I’m almost lvl 400 and I’m seriously thinking of abandoning  fallout its gotten  to frustrating and boring
---
No, it’s not. Like the last one, it will likely update about once a day.
---
Right now. Its Oliver Tree.
---
Have a friend who is high enough level do it in a private team
---
If you're on XB1, hit me up. GT CallMehFishmeal
---
You don't like seeing all your sneak attack damage instantly wiped and putting half a mag into something that should have actually died after the second shot?
---
100% Kits were the best strings. Took me a bit to get the idea behind them but man once you are used it finding items is so fast.
---
I had that happen like 5 times in last 3 days when I was looking for a good spot and managed to delete all of those bugged foundations/stairs all of those time. If you're on PC I can try and help you remove 'em
---
Just get to your ammo workbench and bulk enough material for the challenge.then scrap the bulk. This way you only lose a bit of plastic but don't need to travel around looking for mats
---
"MTX"?
---
Correct, but I hear some shop items are buggy and can be built at friend's camps anyway so you might as well give it a try.
---
Yep.
---
Why? At what point in the last two years have you believed they give even the tiniest of fucks about us. Don't worry, they'll fix this glitch, in 4 months. And include it in the price of your fallout 1st membership cause that's all they give a fuck about.
---
It'll actually let you do the conversions in 100 and 1000 quantities now.  Still seems like it would've been easier to let us scrap and build ammo but since they're hell bent on sticking with their poor designs, at least now it's somewhat efficient.
---
The event is designed for fallout 1st players but there’s no scrap box nearby for them
---
When I'm desperate 100.
---
To put it simply, the health regeneration makes you spend more resources and the more you spend the higher you chance to log back in tomorrow to farm a little more.
---
And the double walls "fix" is probably to justify the future sale of double walls bundles in the atom shop.
---
You can buy it at white spring restaurant. Just sit there and enjoy the Cranberry Meatball Grinder for 99 caps.
---
this is terrible - since beta I have almost always started every build with doorways as I map out and fix things up and then change as need. and now? wow...
---
but hey at least they fixed the game breaking fast travel bug... oh wait. they didn't.
---
Bethesda fix the hooded rags outfit.
---
Ah, thank you! So hardly worth doing. To be fair tho...i mean the plans most of us don't own are rare for a reason,a nd rightfully so. Sheepsquatch Club mods, Secret Service shit, etc etc. They require effort to get, not just spamming your 50k+ steel into a box for a chance. 
---
Either way I mean...what could they havepossibly given us as rewards that would matter? This isn't TOO bad, I get a lot of grenades I convert or use since I'm an explosive build.
---
But  Imean, what else could they have given us? Because I personally don't give a shit about cosmetic stuff. The stuff in the atomic shop is a lot better, for obvious reasons, then the stuff we earn in game. 
---
But damn if I wasn't hoping that Sheep Club mods would be there. 
---
At least it's a good way to farm a good pocketful of caps if you got the excess steel. Unless there's a limit in place that eventaully raises your chance to get only low amount of caps with each turn in to not inflate the economy. Like there even IS an economy on this game.
---
If you check his music out I'd recommend just hearing it first hes a very acquired taste. I'll just say that.
---
Fun fact the green numbers in the workshop is house scrap that is not from your stash.  When the numbers turn white in build menu that is your stash.
---
Then put your scrap that you want to turn in in your stash box or move your tent to the border of the build zone. Its not that difficult to use your brain.
---
Or maybe just move on to the next post
---
I don't get why they keep turning it into a quick cash grab when it could be a huge cash cow with better management and a little effort. The potential of 76 is enormous and consistently passed by.
---
All that Ultracite .45 down the toilet 😩
---
I’ve just stopped complaining about 76 now. There are so many bugs in the game already, and I don’t have the time to complain about them all. But do whatever, it’s your choice
---
Oliver Tree - I'm Gone.
---
Seconded
---
They don't listen to us on the forums, why would they hire us?
---
No, it’s just an outfit that covers your armor and under armor. But you can still wear other underarmors.
---
1,000 atoms for the double walls. Double the wallpapers, double the value.
---
Do you guys think the player base will genuinely donate over 100 million steal or however much it is? Are they even keeping track? Or they just gonna give us the rewards at the end and just say we did it... Wouldn't surprise me.
---
Yup, the amount of junk I lost. AND they had previously fixed it too. Fortunately lost items are semi- rate, so with a bit of effort able to regain.
---
Sneaky
---
I'm having the same issue at a different location.
---
I know right I was in disbelief reading that xD
---
This is a post about walls.
---
Probably because it’s one of the community rewards and rather than add a new set of fatigues to be an outfit they just changed the ones already in game.
---
This worked, thank you.
---
Bow if I could just discover the abandoned bog town and get credit for killing a queen I'd be happy.
---
It has always been the case. The idea now is that it is much less likely to happen.
---
Don't quote me, but it seemed like the order was
---
- scrap items in inventory
---
- Junk in inventory
---
- scrap items in stash
---
- junk in stash
---
- scrap in fallout 1st box
---
So if you hadn't put your item in your stash before doing any work, you might lose the item (this happened to my wife a lot). Even with a massive fallout 1st box, you could still end up scraping collection items. 
---
So it is definitely better. Best would be if the item is in a case it can't be scrapped, but that is not what we have today.
---
It feels like Beth is just a terrible HOA, you are just living the quiet life with your SO Punk Raider, doing puzzles and discussing conspiracy theories and Todd rolls around. 'I see you've got a hanging wall there, that's not up to code it's against the law of physics!'. Thanks Todd we need a modicum of civility and realism in a game about atomic armour and radioactive ghouls. Like seeing a floating base is going to pull me out of the immersion, I just imagine invisible jetpacks are tied to everything and move on.
---
The worst part about it I was grinding the hell out of that treasure hunt and it totally missed me damn it.
---
Eh, you **might** be able to do something with blueprints and stuff but I’ve never done it before so I’m not sure
---
WOW
---
Old carry weight bug is back from taking off an on armor.
---
Played since beta. Have about 1700 hours in and have defended this game to death until a couple months ago. I just cant any more. Theres no excuse for what they do.
---
I noticed this as well. But uh oh if someone is cheating in NW, on it! 
---
Wondering if they have been told not to respond. 
---
I don't know if I've seen the community this upset before
---
It started because I needed more space. Then, I realized I could easily group with myself instead of relying on others, to share the perfect perks setup for every character. I run Empathy and Herd Mentality on every character. I can also easily run 4 full vendors to maximize profits.
---
I'm sitting on, essentially, millions in caps worth of trades, and I hover around 500k total in actual caps. I also typically sit around 15k scrip.
---
My routines involve spending 90k a week on gold (for the 15 characters who have finished the vault 79 line), and another 30-45k every day or two on buying up cheap legendaries from vendors to trade in 150 scrip on every character. This lets me maximize my potential gains from the purveyor. I have the Fixer plan learned on every character, and I don't run Bloodied on anyone. Because I don't use Fixers, I'm able to make a lot of profit on Fixers and good Bloodied rolls.
---
I pretty much run PA and Heavy weapons on all but 2 characters. This lets me just craft sets of Jetpack/Calibrated legs PA for every character without needing to worry about armor until I can craft the best possible SS set I want.
---
All of my characters are over 50, with most well over 100, but only two around 250. I was trying to get at least one character on every account to 200 (eventually 300) for the Legendary Perks.
---
I knock out my SCORE dailies on each account every morning after midnight (when it resets for me). Then, later, after 8am when regular dailies reset, I log into each character and turn in the Vital Equipment daily (they each have either the Osmosis Kit or Portable Power Pack, so I don't need to go track it down).
---
Depending on how long it takes me to knock out my vendor legendary hunting for scrip, I then usually play one character in my own group of all 4 accounts to level or finish the gold quest line.
---
Coronavirus lockdown has helped fuel this obsession, but I own a business that I can do 95% of from home, as well as day trade, so I have a lot of free time to play while I "work".
---
I'm sure it sounds tedious for most people. I really do get that. But I enjoy it. I like the hustle of it all.
---
Got anything rare? You could sell it, if you’re on Xbox I can give you some caps 1-2k, bc I’m leaving
---
Not likely. I'm in a discord with a guy that has donated 100k already.
---
You were being a dickhead so yeah its justified
---
“Fixed an issue where players were having fun”
---
did they even put out a "live" tracker for community goal progress? cause as it is, no matter how much gets donated, they could also say "sorry no one ever donated enough for any of the tiers, but heres a BoS pack for 1800 atoms that has it all in it"
---
If anybody actually checks him out I'm curious, tell me what you think.
---
If you are on Xbox and have the flux I will mod your armor for you.
---
Exactly like I keep thinking ah sure it'll get better just takes time two years later shits still a buggy mess that you have to struggle to ignore how messed up it still is 😂 like between this and fallout 1st man Bethesda have fallen so far
---
Esc
---
Thirded?
---
Crazy this still happening, I'm a melee build with a Fixer as a secondary weapon but I remember having this problem a while back with my shotgun build and eventually gave up in it and became melee.
---
If you want to go back to main menu hit tab a few times or escape and enter.
---
You are not forced to go back through all the menus to convert more, hit tab.
---
I just converted many thousands of rounds of ammo in seconds.  Something that would have taken more than half an hour before.
---
If you think it's worse then you are mentally enfeebled and should just go away.
---
Oh damnit, is it back?
---
"And what is this gap in you resume here from 2019 to 2021?"   
---
"Uh, I uh, was in prison for meth! Yeah, that's it, meth"
---
The PvP is trash, you can shoot them and it won’t do any damage, but they can take the time to line up a perfect headshot with something like a dragon and oneshot you, so
---
once you finish that challenge, there's another for 760000 hours which gives 5 atoms and a scrap kit
---
I don't understand the question, the wall passthrough conduit has nothing to do with changing doors to walls or anything.
---
Oh yeah I'm aware of him. He's a smart guy when it comes to getting his name out there from what he said in the needledrop interview.
---
Honestly, I'd rather have the shelves glitch back than the walls thing :(
---
I was in the middle of building up a new camp when the shelf glitch got patched.
---
Welp, looks like I’m buying shit tomorrow. Many thanks for these weekly notices!
---
Moving a conduit on a mat or on a picture still works
---
I've done 40k myself. I'm sure it's over already 😂
---
I converted thousands of rounds in seconds, a task that would have taken more than half an hour before.
---
Calling that worse means you are clearly a complete moron and I feel bad for Bethesda that they have to put up with your shit.
---
I'm assuming they would run the wire through the doorway then convert it to a wall to get around using passthroughs
---
Boy you sure told them.
---
Bethesda seems to have a massive hard on for nerfing anything the players enjoy.
---
1. Athena Cap Pool
---
2. Feed The people
---
3. Camp items (recent)
---
I could go on and no doubt others can list many more, it seems if the playerbase is loosing items again lets have an example.
---
1. Vendors selling items from players stash = Bethesda silent
---
2. Same method used to dupe items so players GAIN items = Bethesda disable vending.
---
Why was it not disabled within 24hours of players loosing items?
---
Clearly they could not give less fucks if they tried, only when players are gaining do they act.
---
This game is nothing more then someones enjoyment at making the playerbase suffer.
---
I love fallout and I bought this game about a year ago during Black Friday I couldn’t believe this was a boring scrap from fallout 4. After wasteland era came out I gave it another chance but still is disappointing. As a fellow vault dweller I agree with all said above and I hope bethesda listen to us once and for all. Can you believe what they did to things like the ammo converter? That’s a piss on our faces. Like mocking us. That’s not fair.
---
 One more thing about NMS, it is all free and last time i played you couldn´t even buy in game currency with real $.
---
I'd go between 500k and 750k as my estimate for the current total
---
Maybe... actually... use the b2525 fixer..?
---
He's not my kind of music, but his songs are def catchy. You really think he's acquired taste? He's pretty big. But then again so are death grips and they're for sure an acquired taste.
---
Really enjoyed his karma police cover.
---
The seedy shed and satellite dish can be built in a friends camp, so maybe it can, give it a try.
---
I'm sure it's in the same loot pool as all the other bug fixes. Any update now...
---
I also liked doing that but OP does not seem to be saying that.
---
What about the Whitespring robots? At this point joining them might be the best lmao
---
I claimed the free loot bag skin, but how do I go back to the default skin?
---
Will do man it would be a great help.
---
I got 500 caps from one
---
Yes. A post about not posting about walls.
---
I’ve spent the last two days finally converting my camp to have cinder blocks on the outside and pallet wood on the interior by using the door switching/wallpaper trick.  
---
I was 3/4 of the way done.
---
Fuck this shit, they just lost a subscriber.
---
Yep it's still not there.
---
I wanted to add them to my back porch so it'd match the front, but my back porch is on one of the rocky cliff outcroppings in the Savage Divide and apparently those rocks count as items so the posts refuse to intersect. It always bothers me whenever I look at the rear half of the house.
---
Same with me.  Frustrating.
---
If by chance you still have that spare plan I'm on PC. Been trying to get it for a while. It is the dress plan, correct? It's the last one I need.
---
Just give us the fo4 building restrictions and be done with it, I’m so damn tired of not being able to place anything.
---
I honestly do understand the need for first. A game cant put out content and pay for servers in perpetuity without steady income to do so  
---
That being said you have to have a functioning product, care abour fixing actual issues your player base complains about and out out content that actually works. They simply dont listen to anyone who actually plays the game or seem to care.
---
True, and I just noticed my new autocorrect fixed it into NEW instead of NO, nooooo.
---
I couldn’t agree more. The content in this patch is more disappointing than words can say. The “rewards” for donating steel are terrible. I’d rather drop the floater grenades than have them weighing me down, along with the ridiculous booze, which is something you can get literally ANYWHERE in game  without having to sacrifice the steel we need to craft ammo. And you’ll certainly need it, because they also made the converter even WORSE than it was before. If I didn’t know better, I’d say they were trolling us for complaining about the original iteration. I was so excited to be getting ready for the BoS arrival, and now I can’t even see the point. I love this game and play daily, but after seeing these 2 changes/additions, coupled with the lags and new visual bugs and falling through the map on a fast travel, I just couldn’t force myself to keep playing. NGL I’m a little heartbroken right now.
---
Yes yes yes yes, let everyone know about this
---
He is as close to a regular wendigo colossus as the SBQ is similar to a regular scorchbeast
---
I saw parts of that but watched more of him on the h3h3 podcast.
---
I'll do just that thank you good sir.
---
And on another note about tickets. Did you notice how fast the bethesdasupport twitter account went from : 1) Q : hey there is no deeppocketed mod for SS armor ! A : It was sent to the devs team thank you for your insight ! TO... 2) Q : I don't see the deeppocketed mod for SS armor at the vendor ! A : Please submit a ticket with our support team @ support thank you !

---
Entrench and resist! Push the brotherhood out of Appalachia!
---
You forget, they hate ALL mutants!
---
That's most of the playerbase.
---
I think any developer would have trouble if they're using the same game engine for a multiplayer game.
---
Hit back and when you’re done hold back to exit
---
Eh.  SBQ is easy to kill too.
---
Same

I love getting the Whitespring ghouls to chase me past parked cars, turn, fire, booom
---
Then chain reaction
---
Hoping they do an instanced version of mischief night event to cut down on crashes
---
There actually is a double sided inner wall in game meshes archive. (At least there was one last time I checked several months ago while making yet another mod) The reason why it didn't make into the camp building system is a mystery.
---
I guess they tried to put it in game but it caused the scorchbeasts to fly backwards while wearing a tinfoil hat and taking photos of aliens and intoxicated naked players. In a radstorm. And it was actually the one and only time they logged on into game to check if stuff they implemented actually works as intended. Thank God that fix got reverted right after that. /s
---
Thats Bethesda now though, They are so damn stingy with everything in this game its nauseating.
---
I imagine some later level people who like to farm legendarios with laser gats would want to have a good few on hand but I'm starting to learn that they're pretty easy to come by.
---
I’ve spent the last two days finally converting my camp to have cinder blocks on the outside and pallet wood on the interior by using the door switching/wallpaper trick.
---
Agreed, a lot of the tools the building community uses were removed now with this update and its a real shame because basic things like putting a wire through a wall isn't as complicated as build a fusion reactor from junk parts. Soon the rug glitch will be removed and its really going to make it hard to make shelves with items.
---
Just out of curiosity (again) what is your type of music?
---
Hold down the exit terminal button.
---
That’s a good compromise and safer bet! It works for me! Thank you, kind sir!
---
Keeping this posted
---
Yeah... yay!
---
I smell an atom shop update selling us interior walls.
---
Clear the download cache seems to work.
---
Steam, settings, downloads, clear download cache
---
Probably with the BOS Uniform reward that is to come from the new event, something went wrong with the fatigues as well. At least that would be my guess.
---
Yeah I love getting god roll legendarys that are level 5
---
Bethesda: Fix Queen fight so she can be crippled no thanks.
---
Bethesda: Fix exploits used to make Camps amazing especially for the show cases they do on them now lets remove them. Next lets get rid of the rug glitch.
---
It's like they dont want their game to succeed.
---
Base building has a huge following, their system is incredibly unintuitive and they keep patching the ways we can use our creativity (that don't have a negative affect on the game), but continue to neglect bugs that affect gameplay and have been around for far too long.
---
*ahem*
---
Patch 5, with the infamous TSE/shotgun/explosive heavy nerf and removal of explosive energy weapons as well as a promise to adjust them and add them back in. Still no word on that 18 months later, meanwhile explosive energy weapons are still severely broken and probably the most duped gear in the game. I believe this was also the patch that ROLLED BACK THE PREVIOUS PATCH ENTIRELY, causing numerous issues, intense crashes, and raising the weight of bobby pins back to .1 each.
---
Patch 8.5, which brought in the first of the atom shop "utility" items and secretly removed the possibility of watoga robots spawning legendary, basically pushing everybody at the time even further to mindlessly grind whitesprings all day. This was also the same time they nerfed the effectiveness of many QoL perks like white knight and increased repair costs on items, which many argued was the first step in creating the grindy(er) experience we have now.
---
Patch 12, which brought back the horrendous bug where you could get stuck inside a power armor frame and had absolutely no choice but to leave the server and lose all progress on whatever you were doing. It also introduced the vault raids, possibly the single most broken piece of content this game ever had. The fact that it was so bad it died out in a few weeks and they ended up being removed from the game should tell you all you need to know.
---
Patch 18 (Wastelanders), which introduced some lovely new features you might remember, such as NPCs looting your legendaries after you die, items in your stash getting listed in your vendor at base value if your camp failed to be placed on a server,  and removing critter spawns. The critter spawns are apparently a big problem considering how many death threats were thrown out over the lack of critters breaking fasnacht. This was delayed by over half a year and ended up being one of the most broken patches of the game's history.
---
I could go on, but that's probably enough. Sure it sucks to see a helpful bug get fixed, but anybody saying this is the worst of it has either not been around long or forgot what it was like
---
It was me.  I did it.  All 3 downvotes.
---
You can give me the beer if you want, for Beckett
---
Huh. I mean I'm having fun. I got decent stuff, not everything can be gauss miniguns.
---
"Cagadero" lol
---
This worked for me! Had download an update to the game after logging back in, but Im in the game now. Thanks a ton!
---
Go forth and spread the good news.
---
Unfortunately I do not have the flux :(
---
Double-sided walls are an exploit; this change surprises you?
---
And I meant an acquired taste more of how he looks.
---
Yeah it’s overlay now. Sad face
---
What an incredible pain in the ass though compared to the old trick. I also imagine they'll prioritize fixing the flamethrower "exploit" in the next patch as soon as they get wind of it.
---
I'm down only if you're down
---
Wall broken????
---
Maybe it's all a ploy to trick people into duping.
---
"oh this guy donated 200k steel."
---
"better remove double walls in the C.A.M.P."
---
A fix for the wrapped cap would be in order too.
---
This is why I jumped on the offer they made us Aussies for the refund.
---
Over a year of beta lol well, the whole time this game has been a beta...
---
Thanks to u/MadDreaming I tried doing [This](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3134-TIAL-4638) and it fixed the issue for me. Good luck folks.
---
cool
---
Selling us junk walls in the atom shop is a fucking joke. Seriously, it’s hilarious.
---
Oh shit now i too have a legacy camp.. im gonna never touch it except for deco
---
Lol I am using it and I really am enjoying it. It slaps but now I just feel like the thrill is gone you know? No more seeking lol. Maybe why that’s why I liked this game was constantly trying to improve my gear
---
Yea I mean it's 3 platforms all with people with hoarded junk on first accts. Despite this subreddit boycotting the event like some woke gamer political super pac I think it'll be done very quickly. Bethesda is just doing this to pull some junk out of the game so the servers stabilize a bit.
---
Try this.  [https://support.steampowered.com/kb\_article.php?ref=3134-TIAL-4638](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3134-TIAL-4638)

Communism fails because of leadership, not the masses. Absolute power corrupts absolutely and all that. Communist Russia was a shithole because they'd *kill* people for not making their quotas in farms or factories, and then also made those quotas unreasonable because Joe Stalin was a monster with the intellectual value of a mushroom.
---
SBQ accidentally scaled to level 1 and her stats underflow to game's max limit, also brings back the bug where she could roam around the map. You end up with invincible SBQs wreaking havoc across the entire wasteland and it becomes a survival game and fuck the more I talk about this the more it actually starts to sound fun
---
I don't think I'll ever agree with first but I absolutely respect your opinion and yeah they seriously need to start listening to players more and address the bugs that have been there for ages rather than a wall glitch nobody really minded xD
---
You have full Uny sent ap armour in secret service right?
---
Regardless it's loads better and faster than what we had before.  Is it perfect?  Fuck no.  It's definitely better though.
---
That's a pretty ignorant take. All the pvp'ers left, so you have a whole community of builders, and today's update just pissed off, well, everyone who was left lol
---
“3 years max”
---
This game came out in late 2018. 5 year run isn’t bad for them.
---
Just stop paying, they don’t care.
---
You can, you have to break the wall though. With a flametrap or an alt that has flagged for pvp with you. Usually what I did to run wires through walls.
---
Nice! Remember that sharing is caring! Tell all your friends!
---
Not a bad idea, but how would this affect the primary reasons for the limits? 
---
Cap limit = reduce inflation 
---
Scrip &amp; bullion limits = reduce the speed of players getting everything they want. 
---
If you don't factor in a way to address those issues, Bethesda won't consider changing them.
---
It's a pain in the ass. I hate those.
---
I'm expecting this too.
---
If their intention was to patch and release double walls as part of an update for everyone. Then their intentions were but boy are they stupid not waiting to release it together
---
Lmao
---
Hmm ok
---
NO THEY HAVEN'T
---
Well no... guess I could grind for that thanks for the suggestion lol seems a little daunting
---
Reminder: Reddit is a minority. A tiny tiny fraction of the player base. And of that tiny fraction, you have another fraction of people who say as you say. 
---
That said, I do agree that we will almost certainly complete it... one way or another. Unless they make the process more transparent.
---
Can't really describe it in simple terms haha. I'll just say most genres from the 40s to present, but not all eras or genres like country. Also a few hip hop artists. 
---
I like more genres than I dislike and usually have something to show everyone that they like.
---
Id rather just take my steel and make ammo and sell it.
---
The thing is now the converter works for the half of players that have 2k+ ammo stored in their stash boxes it’s a PITA for players (like me) that like to convert low amounts of ammo due to very limited space. Also now it takes forever to go back if you’re not on pc. At least before if you select the right option you could easily go to main menu now you can’t.
---
Yes to that last part. But apparently, you can use a different bug to replicate the effect.
---
Let me guess, the fake argument is what you saw? Haha
---
look at the concept art
---
thank you for this. crazy these things aren’t fixed
---
ATX is the marker in the code for atom shop items. If it's marked ATX, it's slated for atome sale and not earning in game.
---
Was this written by some angsty teen? What the fuck is this post, do people really expect good results by talking like an asshole?
---
Thank god you have to actually cook one for it to count, this would have killed me otherwise.
---
Oh no, I got thousands of scraps that dun know how to spend n this challenge give me a chance to spend them
---
Me too but then I found this. Lol
---
Get scrapper, kill super mutants/ West tech/ Harper's faire. Grab ALL the weapons. Break them down . Steal for days . West tech is 500plus per run. Repeatable, exp, money .
---
I just listened to death grips and I think it damaged part of my brain to be honest hahaha. How did you even come across that man?
---
Wtf?
---
What about the mirror ball, does that work too?
---
That's right, It's my last copy of that plan. My ID is Eldyrus3 and I'm on right now if you want.
---
Caps I'm okay with. Atoms, not so much
---
Well, it is.
---
LOL
---
I second the scorchbeast Queen plushie
---
ItS jUsT a TiMeR dUdE
---
Hmm...
---
I didn't know only one dev could work on one bug at a time.
---
It will eventually return
---
I bought the dumb pack specifically for the taunt. I'm not pleased.
---
F
---
Man you need a girlfriend
---
I'd have taken it all too.
---
And the alternative is to just keep giving them money while they spit on you?
---
yep
---
No. 
---
Each mode have their own exclusive perk cards and their own exclusive perk loadouts.
---
I’m sure they’ll find a way to make it less awesome.
---
I can melt the SBQ but thats without "magic weapons"i try and be courteous when nuking but people with broken/glitches weapons are annoying to deal with. I usually light the bitch up and when I feel I've got enough damage in i focus on the adds to get more xp and loot and to help others focus on the queen to get their damage in.
---
 I dropped a nuke the other day and the queen was in the air one second and dead the next because some ass with a broken weapon destroyed her with a few shots from something. I dont get the fun in it, yeah I like to speed run silos and queen fights but damn dude don't ruin it for a lobby full of people cause you want to flex a shitty weapon you bought on ebay from a scummy hacker.
---
Was excited to see this in the patch note only to login and see they took something terrible and made it worse. It's like watching a toddler pull a crayon out of his nose only to put a glue stick up there.
---
Weird flex but ok...
---
Thanks. Is there like a generized time that stuff rotates back in or is it just luck of the draw?
---
Thanks, clearing cache wasn't working earlier but now it is. Redownloading game on my main pc. Managed to get all my challenges done in the laptop except the NW one. Didn't get my raider settler quests done today. Sold all my stim paks and water and drugs to get near 1400 caps.  Barely got any scrip.
---
But still much better than missing an entire day!!
---
Withdrawal symptoms fading away...
---
Ohh ok. I think i see now at the top my attribute points shows the same. I see now the cards are different.  My bad.
---
Go to youtube and search magic weapons. Angry Turtle explains it in extreme detail (slightly overkill but anyone will understand)
---
I'm happily married, actually, so my wife would probably not approve.
---
Yes..... assuming you have the Lv.2 Starched Genes Perk because if you use a Radaway to get rid of radiation without that perk equipped your going to start losing Mutations each time you use Radaway.
---
Why can't you replace a door and turn it into a wall or a window?
---
Recommend videos forever ago. Their drummer Is in a lot of rock bands and is considered by most the best drummer in the world. Weird that he does hip hop, right?
---
Helps being into abrasive music. But if you actually want to give them a shot try their album the money store. It's their most accessible. 
---
Maybe start with the song hacker.
---
Let me guess, you listened to guillotine? Haha
---
Loot bags are fair game. If you see people obviously trading stuff to each other with them it's rude to jump in and take it but in your situation you just saw some unprotected loot and picked it up. No big deal there.
---
Loot bags are supposed to be able to picked up by anyone. There's no way you could get into any trouble for it.
---
Just doing my lead run I'll get well over 300+ steel too, it's really useful for making ammo.
---
Whoa lets not set the bar unrealistically high.
---
This was a really poor decision on Bethesda’s end. Every set should have walls that can have wallpaper on both sides.
---
Luck of the draw. There's no consistency of when and why certain bundles come back to the store outside Holiday bundles.
---
Do you have the other materials?
---
54 GB update for me (PC Xbox Game Pass) its wild.
---
It is
---
Everything...alright?
---
This method is not guaranteed to work. My first ticket was ignored and closed. My second got an automated response about challenge autocompletes and closed, and my third hasn't gotten a reply in three days. Bethesda support is a joke and is just as much a rewardless grind as most of their in game content.
---
I had this issue today as well. I simply shut the game down and re-launched and it was fixed. Hope that works for you as well.
---
No, it's likely you  found someones death bag, which they can track, and isn't a bannable offense if you take it since it's a gameplay mechanic.
---
Or, they're just being dicks and harassing people, which you can probably report them for, but they probably wouldn't get banned either.
---
In any event, you did nothing wrong.
---
Yeah, good luck going back and forth in that fucking terminal with that crappy interface/system. **Why not SELL ALL ammo by type?** Why limit the exchanges in stacks of 3 or 15? Getting up to 2000 points was already a chore. 
---
They could just get rid of that stupid machine and integrate the ammo points to the vendors.
---
Roughly 5-10 weeks although I haven’t tracked it  personally so it could even be more maybe, maybe 5 months? Sorry I couldn’t give a definite answer
---
Blink twice if you are being held hostage
---
Exactly. Nothing like applying a bandaid fix instead of actually addressing the problem and having a convert all option like everybody really wants
---
Holy shit did they actually not include them with the patch like the fucking patch notes say?
---
JFC its clownshoes all round. It takes actual effort to be this incompetent
---
Nuke ATLAS....
---
Oh! I guess you also get it from the Free States Scorched Detection missions as well, as that's where I thought it came from. 
---
and making round walls
---
If you really want to stage a protest then do NOT submit your junk to the BOS event. Bethesda really needs this event to be successful so they can launch their BOS content over time. It is obvious the community participation us required for story progression.
---
Another way to  "protest" capture workshops and build protest signs like 
---
"Bethesda: revert wall fix now!!" 
---
"Bethesda sucks instead of fixing the CAMP they BREAK IT."
---
And
---
Do not let the anger subside post everyday in this forum and others. Bad press is exactly what Bethesda needs to stop to make this game a success.
---
Alright! Hopping on right now.
---
I'll check, but I used the PA method on Xbox and it worked a few weeks ago
---
You have nothing to worry about, this is not something you can get banned for. They left their stuff out in the open where anyone could take it; anything that's on the ground is free for the taking.
---
You don't have to dump the loot, hang on to the stuff and enjoy. Also, next time someone tries to give you lip, laugh at them, because they're silly.
---
Somehow just making ammo scrapable was decided against
---
You can still swap the windows back to walls after you pass the wire through.
---
they randomly disappear when getting rid of radioation by using radaway or walking through a radioation shower. to prevent this, use the starched genes perk card rank 2 and avoid the showers.  
---
also keep in mind that rad x will suppress the effects, use rad x diluted instead. i also recommend the class freak perk when using several mutations (or have some serums with you. if you have the mutation and consume the matching serum, the negative effects will be suppressed for 1h)
---
This is the best option for anyone with enough scrap to bulk and some plastic to spare.
---
I just ran into this for the first time. I've completed this mission on a few other characters, but now I just cannot enter the cave at all.
---
My Xbox One X crashed the game and uninstalled. When I finally got it installed hours later, all my challenges were completed, photos gone and the game keeps crashing. I cancelled my fallout 1st membership an hour ago. fuck this shit game.
---
Yeah, even though the game got better after the wastelanders update, its still not the game any of us expected it to be  
---
You'd think after the improvements in ESO  
---
and whatever PREY was using they could have implemented some of that in 76 but nope
---
The concept art and this are not the same thing.
---
It’s a bug.  No one knows why it happens but it happens. It’s just one of those things, man. Enjoy it while it lasts.
---
I'm all for helping them take back Fort Defiance, Camp Venture and thunder Mountain at minimum.
---
If there are no bloodied/junkies/magic weapons then it could be a dps thing, a lot of builds just don't do the damage required for that fight
---
That's the spirit!
---
Once i get the backpack I stop trying to finish them.
---
Yeah that sucks man, I hate those black market traders. People really need to stop spamming the SBQ with broken weapons. I hate it when that happens.
---
Makes total sense from a company the creates problems to sell you the solutions. Scrap box for example.
---
Damn is that big a difference
---
Anyone got a pic of double sided walls? I'm out of the loop.
---
How completely underwhelming. Ill be making no more than a token effort. Its not worth wasting the resources for.
---
505 games was involvedi n Death stranding and the game "Control" recently if you care to look those up for reference as to why I had thought about it
---
Go to the atom shop and click on your current drop bag
---
Maybe this glitch caused stability issues
---
I was using it to get in and out of my base without needing a door because people would glitch i. with power armor. I guess now I just have to remove the wall and readd it? Quite inconvenient
---
Bethesda can't afford the bad PR for missing all the challenge milestones, so they'll just cook the books and claim we did it whether we actually did or not. Hang on to your resources, spending them on this garbage is for suckers and rubes.
---
There’s a better way to wire things up. You can put those short conduits on any floor or wall decoration, hook the conduit up to a power source, pick up the bottom object (with the conduit still attached) and place it right back down, then pick up the bottom object for a second time and move it wherever you want. You can now move this object literally anywhere in your camp and the wire will go through anything. Even the ground. Underground wiring is the way to go
---
Well I can say this much it isn't a death bag and no one is watching it so finders keepers!
---
I just bought a year of 1st. So I could test out builds on captured workshops. I'm still in the period where I could reverse the charge on the credit card.
---
At this point if they don't revert ALL the stupid CAMP restrictions I'm walking away.
---
I'll try this on my PC later. I think it's more likely to be PC exclusive than language exclusive, but hopefully we can find a way to get it working for everyone. Kudos for figuring it out this quickly.
---
Death Stranding? Is that the new Kojima game? 
---
Heard about it, but not actually done any research into it, but I'll check it out. Thanks!
---
Broken cosmetic BS at that
---
Oh wow, I had no idea. If I had known, I would've flaired the topic "bug" and used the phrase "a bug" in the title. Thanks for clearing that up!
---
Edit: love how you added two more sentences to your post after the fact to look like less of a jerk. GTFO, son.
---
Im confused by what youf asking. Are you asking why you can't use the wall pass through conduit?
---
Yeah. I was really confused when I first logged in today.
---
They sure did!
---
Doesn't help the fact that they were supposed to make her be able to be crippled. They said it was coming in this patch and they lied to us I'm getting very Fed Up
---
everytime i play i get a team with no mics.
---
I had that happen with my furious explosive railway and let me tell you having over 100 in a thing that normally holds ten rounds was awesome. But yeah it’s been round a while ppl actually make it do that
---
You see a fight going on slide in an scoop up that sweet junk when someone dies!  Then stash it
---
Thats what I do, im not complaining about the lack of steel. Im just saying the rewards are trash when I could just take the steel and make .308 or .50 and sell it
---
....
---
X to doubt. 
---
He, or she? Make up your mind when you make up a story
---
RIP being able to put wallpaper on the wood shutter walls. Be happy with your shitty holey shack.
---
I'm way too high bro. Absolutely blew my head to be honest. I've never heard anything like it 'hahaha' leading me to question just what kind if motherfucker you are lol. No offense meant btw.
---
It can be yes, but it could also be the players, I've seen people unable to do the required damage to get loot during a 20 min fight (I don't know if they we're not able to aim well, just killing adds, or not helping at all)
---
I get what you mean. At least normal people will be courteous and actually be nice enough to let everyone get the reward, instead of literally keeping the SBQ for themselves.
---
Ok, that's what I was wondering. I had not seen this one before and I'm still not sure what triggered it.
---
Thanks to things like Xbox Gamepass and a lot players logging in to do their Score dailies, the numbers probably look like they are going up. A lot of new players and the older players logging in every day including all the new people playing Nuclear Winter! Problem is that's just a fleeting illusion that can only be shattered if things continue to decline.
---
To be honest, they better revert the entire patch since it broke so many things already.
---
The crippled isn't as big of a deal as long as people don't hang out on buildings so the queen can actually land
---
For god sakes, I didn’t even get the flux out of the event...
---
It's a shame to see people with sound logic and reasoning skills being shot down by the masses of ignorant people that don't really know how things work behind the scenes. Fortunately I know that this sub does not represent the entire Fo76 community and most people who are part of the community aren't as trigger happy about slamming Bethesda into the ground without any internal knowledge of the game.
---
I use it as a decoration
---
The best part is the iron sights were unusable before because you couldn't see where you were aiming. Their fix was to add a rear sight... thats too clunky and you can't see where you're aiming
---
Because some fuckhead decided we were enjoying it wrong, I bet.
---
Yeah they fucked something up. I had the 3 events challenge complete in the actual challenge screen, but still be checked for tracking (and thus showing up on my map) and I couldn’t uncheck the tracking for it. I’m *pretty* sure I got the atoms for it though; just a visual bug for me
---
Money.
---
Are you telling me you don't have the fallout 76 subreddit in front of you st all times? Pssh bust be a dang casual with that attitude lol jk
---
&gt;in closing, here's my feature suggestion for the devs: take your pay2play grindfest b list garbage game and code yourselves an ass to shove it up 🖕
---
Devs: instructions clear, but somehow we created a bug where upon shoving the pay2play grindfest b list garbage game up the ass results in it multiplying infinitely and installing itself on every Xbox everywhere. But it steals your credit card info, so it's on the back burner for a fix.
---
Yeah, we can get every pose in the world for photomode in power armor but we can't craft anything. Makes sense. /s
---
Just tested, can't enter either.
---
Couldn't enter Overseer's House either but exiting the game and coming back let me get in the Overseer's House at least.
---
Radshield doesn't suppress mutations either
---
You could easily switch from wall to doorway to get in and out of your camp without needing a door or doorway preventing power armor glitching. This could be done so fast I could have a solid wall, doorway, walk through, and switch back to a wall and appear to almost ghost through it. So many other things they could fix other than this.
---
This is what bothers me really. We are paying costumers and we have a broken product. Instead of everyone being mad about it and trying to make it better we have a vocal community of "fanboys" that will downvote, delete and hide any critique of this said bad product. I will never understand it. 
---
It is a bad business model, a faulty product no one should be defending it. Saying yes to every bad decision and feature they implement gives you Jar Jar Bing. This game is the Jar Jar Bing of the fallout series.
---
As for the downvoters, they can keep their "internet points" i will keep talking about it as long as they keep treating us like trash and not as paying costumers.
---
Line in the sand can still be cheeses if you have two fo1st tents.
---
Could be a typo, could be fabrication. 
---
And even if true, and even if we’re sympathetic, this is not the subreddit for such things.
---
The magic weapon especially. I have a magic minigun and if they aren't going to down her, I'll wait until there is a few minutes left and then melt her. 
---
If she is landed I can do about half her health in 10-20 seconds depending on the server. I only use it in dire situations like that because it takes the fun out of it but you could just be sometimes running into players doing that willy nilly.  
---
On the one hand I hope they fix magic weapons. On the other hand I hope they fix her landing mechanism FIRST. Won't hold my breath, given their track record.
---
So tonight I get on. I got drop a thousand steel just to see what I get. Which was crap. But I goto station near it to do my daily scrip. There’s a bag there no one around at all. Bag had a crap ton of junk. I took it and don’t know why it was there. It had a bunch of bulk stuff. But whatever
---
I mean it is terrible what happened, but this post seems... Like point farming.
---
congratulations on your better-than-average-redditor reading comprehension
---
Same. I have spent money, but that's stopped as of now. I don't even know if I want to log in tomorrow.
---
The 'easy' way is spend ATOMS, the less easy is to grind the repeatable weekly XP challenge.
---
Yeah. I'm fairly certain an Excel spreadsheet could handle an ammo conversion formula better.
---
I don’t think any mass scrapers are still haven’t that many bullets...the converter has been out for over a month now ya know...we have all changed over the thousands of bullets we had...anyway...
---
I passed over a thousand steel.
---
Then I found out what the rewards are.
---
Welp.
---
Not getting any more loot from me, BoS.
---
Ugh. I just don’t understand players like that. Today I was in my workshop, had just finished defending it and was in the tinkers bench bulking stuff and some lvl 300+ player killed me. Just wtaf. My friend messages him and asked him why and he just said “pvp”. It’s just so crappy. 🤷‍♀️
---
What are you expecting?  No one here can explain the technical reasons behind why it happens.
---
It happened. That’s it.
---
Son of a bitch! I just found out about it like a month ago, hadn’t really utilized it for a camp yet. Only my “shop wall” where I used a couple garage doors and windows to make “shutters”. Guess that’s another cool thing I was late for that’s now gone.
---
Yes, but it shouldn't be a tedious grind, honestly its not even so much the rewards for the score. Cause I can do that within a hour, but its if I want to have caps, or scrip I have to play longer so I can get stuff to sell to hit the limit of caps, scrip, gold. Gold itself for a daily kimit can take awhile. But if i could log on on Saturday and Sunday and grind out gold  and scrip all day instead of all week where as then I feel like if I don't. Its setting me back. Cause I won't ever be able to earn that back, except maybe catch up through only buying when there's sales. Idk that's just how I feel if I don't log on and get my daily limit then I'm wasting resources.
---
Glad your lawn was pruned for a short time! Mine never has been, unfortunately.
---
Yeah, I am bummed out.  Building was the only thing that separated this game from the others.     
---
They won't ban cheaters, but they screw the people that build.  I don't get it.
---
I will say that "Control" is one of 505's better works than death stranding, but both games are similar to the atmopshere bethesda's PREY has
---
Definitely a gay satanic agenda going on. I dunno if I should be hearing it for my souls sake.
---
How do you feel 1400 caps that fast?
---
Are you joking? The entire sub is spammed with posts about it.
---
Meaning it looks like a Gauss projectile?
---
I think it just a trick to force players to buy prefabs that are coming soon.
---
What's wrong with walls?
---
Doubt double interior walls will be an atom item. Bethesda usual just provides different textures and styles for base items, but double walls would be an extra mechanic. I’d guess they’ll introduce new objects like diagonal walls, vertical half walls, double interiors etc and double down on new textures and camp items. Probably it’ll all come with camp shelters when they can afford to increase budgets. 
---
Seems like they enjoy throwing us a bone just before ppl give up on them so we’ll feel like they’re listening.
---
Dude look at the hot posts...
---
I rarely if ever buy fallout 1st or atoms. If it’s gonna make the game more enjoyable at that time sure I might but currently don’t plan on buying anything
---
I actually like the rewards for the Community Challenge at the end but I can hardly care for the random Rare plan for providing the resources.
---
Who would of known a Fallout 76 post could go so deep man.
---
See, I've never even heard of Control until now, and I've never played PREY either...
---
Still, definitely gonna check those out, so thanks again for the recommendations!
---
Oh right. I cooked my first one after I did the line in the sand event.
---
Sorchbeast will also keep respawning if you do the Surface to air event at firebase Hancock. The sorchbeast will be a legendary.
---
Expect the worst and hope for the best.
---
Isn’t there a connector for that?
---
I can craft some serums for 5000 caps each.
---
You will find much better prices on a trade sub.
---
All fixed everyone
---
Witcher or Cyberpunk level quality but Fallout? Holy fuck that would be the best, the dream.
---
Had it active in a public server I joined
---
Seen it like 3 separate times today
---
It did last week. There’s no rhyme or reason for a lot of those events. Could be the servers just want you to suffer
---
done 3500 worth of steel, got that out of my inventory
---
I must have the worst luck.
---
Im just seeing bethesda adding double sided walls to the atomic shop.
---
That's where I am.  We have cheaters galore duping legacy weapons, other cheating dogs running 7-8 glitched ammo collectors in their camps, and this is what we get?  
---
I love this game, but man, I am thinking my time is coming to an end.  I can't stomach the cheaters being given free reign but the builders being even MORE restricted now.
---
Sounds about right. I just wanna mash!
---
Wait, it does? I didn't see that description like gas masks have.
---
Probably, same here. Whenever I need something to spawn/appear it never happens
---
Update:  problem resolved by using the Bethesda Launcher's Repair function, game now running NP  :))
---
That’s my motto for everything haha. 
---
Sadly, I’m what you’d expect
---
Here's an idea: if you can't contribute to a discussion, don't.
---
So they made it an outfit and no longer underarmor? It's a good looking piece and always thought it should be an outfit. I hate that it messed you up though.
---
You’re on the wrong website for that then!
---
Crippling is a big deal ...just because she lands doesn't mean she's going to stay down. And if you do not have a bloody unarmed Melee character believe me bro she has to stay down. Regardless to the fact that there are lying to us this is really upsetting me... This been going on since wastelanders... I was told from data miners that they applied a perc card to the queen in order for her wings not to be crippled? What's the point of having 20 different pinpoint on the queen if you can't crippled any of them .. would make the event more efficient for everybody on the server.... people standing on v9. People standing on tents. Tent placement ..none of that has nothing to do with the queen coming down and staying down.. regardless of how many people are standing on these objects if the wing is crippled believe me she is coming down right away. If both wings are crippled she will not leave the ground if she does it is only for one second. You're talking to someone who has memorized her behaviour since the beginning. Crippling is more important than you know if you don't have any one dishing out the damage at least she can stay down for people to make headshots for maximum damage. You can put the entire server on multiple tents 20 ft in the air. I'll stay on the bottom take out her Wings and watch all she comes down and stays down...
---
Considering how they fucked over most of the remaining player base with today's update idk if these fuckers are gonna make it til Christmas without reverting the building changes. Builders have kept the atom shop running lol
---
im confused...people are mad because they fixed something?
---
Open a ticket and ask to have the quest reset, and hope that customer support actually takes the time to look at what you're asking.
---
 I had a ticket up for a week, every time they updated it, it was a blank message and their first copy and paste response to the bugged quest that I wanted to reset was "We know that challenges are auto completing, blah blah blah" their support has always left a lot to be desired but goddamn they've been atrocious as of late.
---
I like buying them cheap so a 100% core I would buy for around 50 caps.  25% core for around 10 caps.
---
Well thats good to know. Might actually use it now.
---
This does affect their revenue. CAMP builders are a source of atom shop money) such as for wallpapers) and they just spoiled that.
---
I know I won't buy any more wallpapers now.
---
And the cheaters running wild ...
---
I had plans for a nice modern setup that would have had me happily building for a week. Not happening now
---
Have they made any comments on adding more/better rewards thou?
---
Also based on the fact that Legacy Weapons are a thing (Bethesda made a change but for some reason that change was not completely retroactive) there doesn't seem to be any indication that any would be future change would apply retroactively.
---
Definitely!
---
Recently I switched to playing Fallout 4 Far Harbor and Nuka-World since I bought the DLCs a long time ago and never got around to it. Was very glad I did
---
you can drop or sell them they shouldnt just stop because you want them to
---
Hold down B to exit. I had the same exact problem on PS4, so I just held circle until it let me go. No idea why this one is different from the rest of the terminals.
---
Isn’t this the quest that they fixed?
---
That's his gender fluid imaginary Lebanese friend you're talking about. Show some respect.
---
They fixed the Bungalow walls, which was the thing annoying me the most. So they did something right in my opinion.
---
Guess I will keep my spoon collection.
---
Just did this today after patch 21 was released. I lost 1000 rep.
---
I did monster mash for the first time today.  It glitched and I couldn't remove the mask at the end.  Trophy earned, never again.
---
When you’re in your vendor, you can press triangle twice (PS4) to see only the items in that vendor and ones in your stash
---
What kind of new loot is there? New outfits or plans or something?
---
They shit the bed.
---
I had a power outage today and thought that killed my xbox,  but maybe not...... I have a new door stop it appears
---
Awesome! Thank you! I read the options of the buttons down the screen but i didn't saw anything about this, great to know! Thank you!!
---
He's sighing in relief of the respite that he's given by not being force to go through the Wasteland by you.
---
Honestly bundles have been coming back alot sooner like 3 weeks sometimes. I didn't buy it because I like buying things on sale. The Chinese assault rifle came back quick and the matte black skin came back in like 2 weeks.
---
Sleazy children be sleazy
---
76 has clearly been the most unfinished game of all of them. They probably intended to rush it out so their main team could start TES6, however they didn’t realise the bunch of spanners they hired for updates were so incompetent
---
My point was simply in comparison with the community event 01 from last year.
---
Basically, obtaining steel is less straightforward than killing scorched. I’m not denying that in certain cases people are loaded with this mateiral, but killing scorched was **equally accessible to everybody**, regardless of your playstyle. There were no ‘loss’ or investment beyond time.
---
agreed
---
I started playing at Wastelanders. Wish I'd never bought it.
---
&gt;This is not a pointless ragequit/goodbye post. This is not an airport, so departures don't need to be announced.
---
I just wanted to say that I loved this particular section of your post - If Bethesda isn't listening to the players who are staying, they sure as hell aren't going to listen to the ones leaving.
---
The only thing it feels like they're going to listen to at this point is the red ink in the ledger.
---
I want Fallout 76 to succeed. I want it to live up to the promise its premise has, the potential it could fulfill. It never will as long as Bethesda and Zenimax don't care.
---
I started with Hahaha. And was greeted with a wall of glory holes with mouths like tongues, lips and teeth popping through.
---
In the apocalypse if anyone wants to wallpaper the outside of their house, shanty, bus, car, etc. they should be able to.
---
No, many devs do, you are just on one of the games of the worst 3, EA Activision and Bethesda
---
If only they *really tested* stuff they implement. Not only they clearly do not, but they also refuse to listen to their most loyal part of the playerbase. People, who actually agreed to test stuff at their PTS servers. Us, testers.
---
And I won't even start talking about stealth changes (as in "ninja nerfs") on pts builds of the game they make a patch or two before the release. This combined with our inability to find out in advance about the recent changes (bugs caused by hidden "fixes") by any means except of pure lucky coincidence leads to yet another disaster post-patch. I mean, who the hell bothers testing camp building mechanics if the only changes they bothered to include in the patchnotes were new events and major stuff like that? We need full transparency in case with everything that gets changed in the PTS to avoid issues like what we encountered today after yet another "patch".
---
They grunt and 'moan' when you enter a server so....
---
I've had that issue with the mask staying on after I've left. Someone told me to try getting in and out of Power Armor. It worked for me, so now I use it whenever I'm done farming Monster Mash (I find it a pretty good xp farm, didn't even realize it was a pvp event until reading it on reddit, never seen anyone else at the event when I've gone)
---
I recently got into building what is this wall fix thing? What's so bad about it?
---
Exactly there's no HOA in the wasteland!
---
I feel EXACTLY the same. Agree with everything. Cheers 🍻
---
PvE is so if your automatic hits something other than the enemy thanks to the recoil, you still hit something thanks to the arcing.
---
Im sure I get more lead from junk extractors. Probably just my imagination or something.
---
These are some good tips. If i where to add anything to it. Go raid some gyms for dumbbells there are gym equipment in many places even in low level areas these do not require acid to turn into lead which is great, but yea not as much but if you dont need lots its nice for a quick bit.
---
There are a few satellite dishes right around there.  My kid and I figured out how to get his camp on top of one of them.  We had to build up to the spot just below the dish itself and place the camp, so it's possible to do on that one at least.
---
Its the over encumbered sound
---
Wait til it goes on sale, Jesus. Don’t need to go on a tirade about it.
---
It's a sigh of relief because he gets a break from Bethesda's programming for a while.
---
So stealth nerf then. Done because they knew we'd react this way most likely...
---
how dare people care about things
---
Pretty much. Oh no!  Free items that are free at no cost to you but junk! What monsters! 
---
Although the camp thing is bullshit.
---
Good thing I moved and rebuild my camp a few days ago. I’m gonna have to keep it now. I really cannot stand having the exterior walls on the inside it just makes no sense. They should’ve had an interior wall from the beginning. Just like how the contemporary set should’ve had its own foundation no columns or roof. They could’ve included the floor texture to be in interiors texture.
---
I've been seeing the tesla firing effects from a 50cal occasionally when my friend switches between the two.
---
A bunch of plans I'll sell for a cap, a beret I don't want, and they're diluting the value of my fermentation operation.
---
At no point whatsoever am I enticed to cough up steel.
---
How's your cork, though?
---
Right, but they're still linked, aren't they? No need to store scrap in your actual stash means you have more allowance to store guns and armors.
---
(And honestly, who knows how this particular game handles it? FFXIV's glam dresser turns armor with all its stats into "simple numbers" too, yet it has to have a limit because "server load"...)
---
I usually just sell aid and grenades after doing all my daily stuff. All that glowing meat and blood sell alright.
---
Damnit alright thanks for the help
---
I knew something was gonna break but why this??? Building is one of my favourite activities in this game and it is absolutely dissapointing they did this change, especially since this is not an a gamebreaking exploit that gives you an advantage or hinders another player. :(
---
Yes, my point exactly.
---
Same haha, I like the color scheme of it
---
Well, the community rewards are good imo. And I do not care if the turn-in rewards is not 10 legacy weapins for 250 steel...
---
I feel your pain, it really sucks to see a company that you have supported and loved go down this path. I'm glad you are continuing to play though - so you have not lost all hope. You are just extremely disappointed and that is understandable. 
---
I wish I could tell you that it will get better, but I have no idea. Just know that you are not alone with how you feel. See you in the wastes.
---
Having them reset it may not fix it though, assuming you can get a live person to actually reset it, looks like they broke the quest outright when they reduced the amount of samples needed. Go figure, right?
---
But if they post a comment on someone else's post, they won't get as much attention.  Why do you hate America so?
---
I think you got your money's worth at that amount of time played lmfao
---
Also, yall really being this dramatic over a video game. A life may be needed.
---
Put in a little lead, acid and cloth and 250 steel is a whole lot of bullets
---
I’d rather be put in prison for meth dealing than Beth dealing... I’m sorry but how the fuck have Bethesda not been sued yet?
---
It still works. Not a lot of people joined. I did the event all by myself the other day.
---
Yeah, I was honestly taken aback at just how bad this "fix" is.
---
why everyone talks like strong they looking for milk of human kindness?
---
But why should someone have to back all the way out for every interaction and then start over for the next one with this terribly tedious rinse and repeat?
---
But that’s the thing, everyone won’t do it
---
Nope cant see it, must be too new.
---
They’re not even reskinned Christmas gifts. The gifts give junk. The Bullshitters of Steel’s packages don’t.
---
My fallout first has not worked in almost a month now. They stopped responding for two weeks and I was told to wait until patch 21 to see of it would fix it. So even if patch 21 fixed it I would get 4 days of my month of FO 1st. I never got the atoms either. They don't give enough of a shit to make sure their paid subscriptions work.
---
What have they said they don't know how to fix?
---
There is no need to boycott it:
---
There is very little incentive to actually do the challenge so most people will not do it anyways.
---
The nuclear winter rewards weren’t supposed to come back out. Don’t complain that they fixed it
---
All fallout 4 content should be free.
---
 It’s my first time, I want to go full raider now but I guess I’ll have to wait. Or just side with the settlers, ugh.
---
I just want to do it for the trophy.
---
I was saying this to people earlier but they said it was fixed/didn’t work
---
1. Go to the "steam" tab in the top left, and click "settings"  
---
2. Click on the "downloads" tab, then click "Clear download cache"  
---
3. It prompts to sign you out, sign out then back in.
---
Why not give a single normal lunch box, per container. Or give them a 10% chance of giving a normal lunchbox. People would be going to Atlas in droves to turn in junk for that
---
Take Nick to Far Harbour with you. You’re not gonna regret it, I promise. :)
---
Hey man, I am having this EXACT same issue on my PC. I am using the xbox app to launch the game through my game pass. I also have a VPN through NordVPN, but I still couldn't get it to work. Any way you can tell me how you got your VPN to bypass the issue?
---
Shhh. It's not broken, it's actually worth doing now.
---
I did :)
---
There's a mod for that
---
I mean, what's the point in dumping *resources*, stuff we can and do actually use, to get a bunch of *junk* in return, stuff that's either completely useless or else is trivial to obtain, anyway? 
---
And indeed, this isn't the first time they pulled shit like this for an "event". Just an observation.
---
☝️ 😉
---
Personally my favorite event
---
No Karens either thank goodness.
---
This right here.
---
I'm pissed every time they re-add items they removed when they rebranded FO4 as FO76.
---
I'll not be getting junk walls this time or ever, their greed is really getting to me.
---
That's pretty weak of them.  You should ask for a refund.
---
Wait double sided wallpaper was a thing?
---
Thanks, I was wondering about gunsmith as well and there was one other I can't remember now
---
it collects dirty water. it holds 2 at a time. I got it and havent seen it holding more than 2.
---
so I guess jt’s not worth it
---
Not that it's necessarily an 'easy' way, but just find an xp farming route that works for you, server hop and do it again.  I do Whitespring and either Ft. Defiance or the capitol building; 7-8k xp.  Hit the deathclaw north of Watoga and if I have to whack some Protectrons in Watoga for 114 each.  Get the 100 score and do it again. 
---
If I get on a good build team I'll hit up Harpers, the Burrows, the Behemoths, etc.  Easy to farm xp, focus on high concentrated enemy areas or the big money behemoths, deathclaws, sentry bots, SB's.
---
Getting 250 steel isn’t exactly challenging, js. Has nothing to do with stash space
---
Well that’s where you get steel from, dipshit.
---
Yes to this. Just let us put wallpaper on both sides. 
---
Or....give us back the double-sided wallpaper solution that we already had!!!!!!
---
Ok.
---
Does this also affect building circular camps too since it uses doors to first place down at angles, then replacing them with walls?
---
~~I’ve purchased it, it seems to act like a small water purifier that doesn’t require power. It has a max inventory of 4 water, and can be locked. Not sure about the production rate. So sure, if you want a quiet, powerless water producer then it’s a good purchase.~~
---
I’m wrong as hell
---
I’m pretty sure it’s monthly based on the day you started not the start of the calendar month
---
Doesn’t seem worth it for end game characters.  I wonder if the goals will be met.
---
What's wrong with them not getting attention? We know its fucked and what was that about america?
---
Move your tent near Atlas.
---
This!!!
---
Are you even human if you don’t do that?
---
This
---
I've only a simple small cabin, but it includes an interior wall and a hanging wall to get it just the way I want it. I'd been casually scouting for an aesthetically better location to relocate and rebuild my cabin at, but now I guess I'll just stay where I am for forever.
---
people like you are proof why unrestricted access to the internet wasn't the best idea
---
They could have gave slocum joe canp items for a quest related to the slocum joe place in appalachia....
---
I’m not so sure. Unfinished? Very much so; launching without NPCs proved that one. All I’m saying is, I’ve seen this before. In every Creation engine game. At launch, these games have always been great ideas dragged down with varying levels of poor execution. But they’ve always been able to fall back on the fans to do the polishing for them and in this instance, they can’t.
---
Why they don’t just listen to us, I have no idea. Maybe the board room is interfering. But rarely does someone set out to make a failure of a product on purpose.
---
Hell why is there an invisible bass player following me around after playing NW.
---
It's a donation and your whining that you're getting something back?
---
Simp. It'll be hilarious if they don't openly recruit and he just be given the same box of useless stuff we get for donating.
---
I was thinking the same thing
---
stop the endless whining
---
It's an optional activity. You're DONATING supplies to help the BOS when they arrive; you should be happy you get anything back at all!
---
I don’t t think that’s a bug...it does that with scorch killer receivers.  Or at least it used to, I haven’t installed one in over a year.
---
It is based of your payment date for sure
---
Yeah they are easy to come by. I don't know many people who buy them these days.
---
Building a cool base in an online Fallout game was one of the reasons 76 brought me in and hearing this makes me very disappointed.
---
I wouldn't worry about it too much. It's when you start seeing 'suspicious soiled blankets' in them that you might want to panic.
---
That’s a lot of grenades!
---
seems like they didn't want to have a "conversation" so much as create a dictatorial hellscape to profiteer off of children while the rest of the world burns, sense of irony ubound from the many soapboxes that they use to hold up their fantasy world
---
Yet the Prydwen could be kept afloat by a woman stuck in power armor. Makes total sense!
---
Dicks out for the Brotherhood!
---
Sub will run out its paid time, then you lose tent and private server access. You keep the scrapbox, but can no longer deposit into it. Only withdraw. So im gonna stockpile scrap (fuck those brotherhood bastards) as much as i can
---
You’ll need a certain amount of special points in adventure mode for certain perks in NW tho, like to use the frog legs perk in NW you need 9 agility points in adventure mode to equip it
---
Man, I didn’t even know you could do this. Would’ve been nice to have but I guess it’s gone.
---
Just tried it. You can turn the walls into steel or wood or whatever, but regardless of what type they are if you try to place a blueprinted double-sided wall it says "Cannot place item: Selected item is floating."  
---
I also tried it with the blueprint including the floors/foundations, adjoining walls, and even a roof. It doesn't work. *Only* the method you proposed worked.
---
But just to add: the [Flamethrower Trap Plan](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_Flamethrower_trap) is indeed a reward from the Free States quests done to restore the scorched detection system at Abbie's Bunker for the mission [Coming To Fruition](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Coming_to_Fruition)
---
I got an SS drop during SBQ today.
---
How democratic of you
---
Fun police detected!
---
The truth is, the game was rigged from the start.
---
Yes ):
---
They've been updating and patching ever since it came out and wastelanders was universally praised as good content. Some people are just going to bitch to bitch. That's the way life is. There's always going to be people who just have a bad attitude and are toxic. It's one of the reasons fallout community is so great because those people can't handle a game that people talk crap about on the internet so they go pretend to enjoy games that got good ratings on IGN because it's socially acceptable. If you don't like the game then don't play it but coming to the reddit to bitch to those that do enjoy it with ignorant conspiracy theories of how Bethesda has a small team for a game they are fully supporting then you should expect a little grief. My suggest is to get over yourself.
---
Ntm one of the new atomic shop items is junk walls, straight from Fallout 4 that you can download a free mod that adds them to workshops.
---
If this happens to me I'm fucking done with this game. I've had the same camp since early 2019 and it wouldn't be possible to rebuild now thanks to today's patch, not even considering the massive amount of work it would take to rebuild a camp that I slowly built up over the course of a year and a half.
---
Can you pm me how to do it?
---
But there was ammo in it so it wouldn’t be a death bag, I think they were definitely just being idiots

Honestly who even uses the workshop budget besides turrets, a stash, and a place to scrap things at? Its pretty much impossible to get to the limit woth what materials they give you anyways.
---
Sure, I'll sign up for this.  The rewards are crap. You have to go out of your way to do it (by comparison, killing scorched is something we'd do anyway). So it takes no energy to boycott this.
---
And fucking around with the CAMP system to make it even more of a Pain In The Ass to work with than it was is just asinine as Hell and should not be rewarded.
---
Yup, the middle is not responsive.
---
Yeah, must have skipped the part about ammo being in there... My bad.
---
Uh, no you don't. Just hold the back button and you exit the machine, exactly like it works on every terminal.
---
People that don’t have fallout 1st drop loads of junk at the train stations to free up stash space and also do it doesn’t go to waste, someone’s bound to find it like yourself
---
Is there a save editor that can somehow bypass this or is that not possible because of the cloud?
---
Do you have a ghoul blood samples? Check your inventory
---
They take it away, wait for everyone to miss it, then charge us for it. You can bank on it.
---
Exactly. And I don't know if you've ever tried to max out a workshop budget before, but it's a lot!
---
Give that budget to the players!!!
---
I donated 25k mainly for the caps. I have more steel then I'll ever use so why not lol
---
Makes you wonder what? That now the game is basically F2P (on xbox) they're putting all of their development/time/resources into their money funnel? What? No way
---
~1500 steel per event says it’s working just fine!
---
Yeah
---
Thats a bingo.  I can't wait for Cyberpunk 2077.  That's all I'm really hyped for.
---
Why aren't they bringing their own steel if they are such a 'Brotherhood'? Why does that guy feel the need to kiss their asses and bend over for them so much? This is OUR territory and they need to earn OUR respect.
---
Yeah I've been trying for about an hour on Xbox what a pain in the pass
---
Yes it's an unproven theory, one that just happens to fit the facts, and their consistent pattern of trying to do everything they can to make us buy the game we already paid them for.
---
I got mine from the 'Free States' vendor in Whitesprings for around 3000 caps, they're also for sale at the Watoga and Harper's ferry local vendors~
---
Check the wiki if you're looking to save caps though~
---
Some bugs are really unacceptable such as the new C.A.M.P skin that makes your camp invisible on the map. You do not need any test case to test it, you could find the bug by logging into the game. Unfortunately, they did not.
---
And you can equip seven cards from strength as long as you have enough points on your adventure mode character to cover their cost... just an example
---
yea it’s bugged😑
---
Flame thrower trick is such a pain in the ass. I use it only as a last resort. (I used it to get inverted corner roofs and put flat roofs under slanted roofs). But this post is helpful. I appreciate it. So funny how the community has to fix Beths errors and is willing to be so inconvienced to do it.
---
Maybe they're just trying to look like they're doing SOMETHING to the higher ups, since apparently all the other more important stuff is too complicated to fix or would take too long.
---
Thanks for the info. Its making a bit more sense.
---
There is just so little left in this game for long time players to enjoy. I'm not a big fan of grinding for rare weapons or armor. I don't like running the same events over and over. 
---
I like exploring. I like going on resource gathering expeditions to find stuff to sell in my shop. And I like building.
---
Building already isn't a lot of fun. There's a lot of limitations and you have to be really creative (and spend a bunch of time gathering resources and plans and/or carefully spending Atoms) to get something cool. 
---
There's just nothing left for me in this game if I can't build things like this. 
---
I feel really disappointed in myself for buying a full year of 1st a few months ago, because knowing me, I'll feel guilty about the wasted money, keep logging in, and keep getting frustrated. 
---
Can they maybe just release a downloadable version of Fallout 76 that we can run locally on our machines as a single player game? Then we can mod the heck out of it without impacting other players, and all us builders can have some fun again.
---
They should’ve had atomic onslaught regular armor paints in addition to everything else
---
Yes, currently have 15/9/8/2/9/6/7
---
-karma
---
I had 3000 grenades and the option did not work. Call me crazy but I think 3k is more than 500
---
Hey I'm actually on the toilet.
---
How did you know
---
And its gone?
---
I don't think you understand how many different things I try and how fast. This would slow that process down to a point that is not a conceivable workaround. It's the tone-deafness that most of the community is reeling from, from what I can tell.
---
Or bear with me now, maybe it was a fix to something else but Bethesda being Bethesda, they didn't check to see if that adversely affected other shit. I mean we're talking about a company who's golden phrase is: *"Hi! Please submit a ticket explaining the issue and we will see what we can do: **[Insert Useless Link Here]**"* 
---
Damn Reddit and it's comment cool down timer.
---
I’m surprised this hasn’t got removed. One my friend made for nuking the event got removed.
---
Still, I agree with this. I plan on it. I don’t have gallons of mats to dump for shit.
---
There’s still [hope](https://imgur.com/a/gA3w0kg) . Let me know if I should delete this, just wanted to share in case people thought this wasn’t possible anymore.
---
You mean like to how they totally revamped daily challenges into the seasons system to force everyone into buying ranks ups to unlock everything? Oh wait, that didn't happen and almost everyone is on track by now to finish with weeks to spare and even more score bonuses on the horizon? That pattern of screwing us over and making us pay cash for it? Awesome pattern there.
---
“ removed extra clicks” my ass. Now I gotta click EVERY individual ammo type to see if I have that ammo or not
---
Delete this before Bethesda decides to make this a top priority fix over things that have been broken for months on end.
---
Haven't seen anyone else mention it
---
No mention of it anywhere else
---
Wastelanders update brought this bug back and I actually moved my camp because of it, lol
---
married with a game
---
Well I just need someone else to see if I’m just dumb and missing it lol but if someone could check it’s supposedly from the guy in the vault
---
No definitely not been mentioned on every 2nd post
---
Good read. 
---
I played the BETA but ended up canceling my pre-order before launch. Most game betas today are really just advertisements to give people a taste of their game, but that's besides the point. 
---
I picked the game up the following summer for 15 dollars off of eBay. Did I think I would have fun? Of course, I'm a huge fallout fan, so obviously it was appealing. Building especially caught my eye. I made it to level 44 solo before I gave the game a rest. 
---
Not long after was I approached by a friend who had the game since launch. We made new characters and had a blast going through the story together. Something about picking a direction and looting places for scrap that was really immersive and we felt like we were NPCs who always talked about going out and scavenging. It was grounded. It felt good. 
---
It was not until around level 80 that the game stopped feeling casual and more hardcore. We grinded events every day and we would work ourselves to make the best character we could. It was no longer about experiencing what the game had to offer but to focus on building yourself to be viable. We sat on so many perk points because they were just unused. 
---
Then, wastelanders released and boy was it a breath of fresh air this game needed. I remember waking up at 8 am with my buddy to join the game and the literal second I connect, I notice the draw distance, the music, the optimization. THAT was fallout. For the next couple of weeks, I was satisfied with the state of the game. 
---
Today, it's a grind. I want to say that I have fun with this game like I did. I don't hate it but my love for it has diminished. When you've done everything and have to repeat the same stuff over and over again, each day.... it's maddening. I couldn't even bring myself to grind out max reputation for the settlers and raiders dispite it giving you access to the god-tier weapons. Gold Bullion is the worst grind that I have had to put up with. 
---
Now, with more content on the way, I'm not as excited. Atlas adds literally nothing outside of a donation event and a new character to speak with. Meat Week, something we have had before, is still a ways off and the Colossal Problem... call me a pessimist but do I want to grind for a Totem and a rug so they can sit in my 'learned' catalogue and never get used because the budget of the camp is so small? Don't get me wrong, it'll be cool to finally fight the damn thing since the release of Wastelanders but I'm not that excited.
---
All in all, I'll support this game. It isn't as bad as the dumpster fire youtubers and everyone else would have you believe. If I joined 76 today... it would blow my mind. There's so much content out of the gate now. It's actually kind of intimidating to start a new character with all thats been added. But, it is what it is. I'm glad to see an active community around the game and especially glad that the community isn't just blind to the flaws of the game.
---
They normally arrive a day or two after your payment clears for your FO1st membership. Do not worry you will get them.
---
So it has to have the wire through it?
---
Megasloth flushie ftw.
---
I'm not doubting that some people only play to build; I like building a lot myself. I'm doubting that the only thing this person enjoys about building is double sided walls. If that's the case, they should really just go play another game.
---
You know why you have all those downvotes on your earlier post? Cause you don't know what you're talking about.
---
Only thing I’m looking forward to is the Brotherhood’s full return and a Colossal Problem
---
I agree that it needs improvement, yes a slider or "convert all" would be ideal. But "worse than before"??? It took me all of 3 mins to convert about 10K in various ammo (2mm ec, shells, fusion cells, 10mm) into about 5000 rounds of 5mm for my minigun. 
---
Why do you have to "check back and forth"? Surely you have to know if you have hundreds or tens-of-thousands of an ammo type.
---
I know it's not perfect, but HAS improved. This is a trash whiny post.
---
How would that increase the sales of ATOMS? Have to think of the poor shareholders. /s
---
IMO this makes the event better...
---
I didn't whine about anything thank you very much. I've donated 2k steel so far and am actually fine with the rewards. Anything I don't have a use for will bring in a couple of caps. I don't have a problem with it at all so kindly take your attitude elsewhere.
---
I’m not home to check it myself. But what’s the Trophy
---
For the first time it spawned normal for me today. Was kinda boring but the graham and chally showed up and he went crazy 'helping' kill the scorched. Was funny!
---
In other news, water is wet, and the sky is blue.
---
I'm really fucking frustrated that they fix right away any bug that results in more fun or an advantage (that doesn't hurt other players), but the ones that kill game play, or make it so items the player paid for don't work, take months or are still not fixed.
---
There was a bug where if you stood in certain places during Guided Meditation, no ghouls would spawn and you could just chill out and, well, meditate. That was fixed a week or two ago.
---
The Grognak emote which I bought an entire pack I really didn't want just to get (I love that emote and was always jelly when I saw others use it) is now broken. You still do the pose, but the icon doesn't show up, so no one knows you're using it unless they're looking at you. 
---
But hey, thank fuck we can no longer use glitches to build cool camps. Oh, which reminds me, anyone else hate how easy it is to place your camp accidently? It wouldn't be so easy if the game didn't lag like fuck at times when you're trying to quickly exit or enter into the menu to grab a healing item/fix a weapon/tediously switch your perk cards. Not only does it suck for well-built camps that players put a lot of effort into (that you can't blueprint properly since Ol'Bethy wil never let you place it in the area you need), but now if you've used any glitch (like putting powerlines through walls like my camp) you're S.O.L.
---
I bought a month of 1st to get the emotes (as you can see I quite like them) and had purchased a year which was going to activate once this month runs out (funny enough, this was for the stash box which was full of 10k steel for the new update), but I've cancelled it. Not only because of this BS, but because the rewards for this new ATLAS update absolutely suck and are no different than what we get from the Christmas packages which are still floating around in droves due to dupers.
---
As someone else mentioned, it's the overencumbered sound playing because the game "removes" your weight buffs before logging. Same as when you login itll say overencumbered until its load up your buffs.
---
As soon as they can monetize it, we will get the option.
---
The cryo ones are useful against the Queen actually
---
Okay thanks for the feedback
---
Can confirm it's been doing this for me pre-update
---
doing the event.
---
Craig
---
I hardly go in to work currently so I sit and play every day and I agree with you. I have a group of friends and some of them have kids and jobs that make them work still. They can't play every day. Everything should be set to weekly limitations.
---
Oh stop exaggerating......
---
.... it's every 3rd post......
---
also super slow for me as well now
---
Woooosh.......
---
I note the /s but the reason I thought of this is because I've seen more than a few posts of people saying if they start now, they won't make any meaningful progress in the run.
---
This would hopefully encourage them to think, well if I at least complete the score that I've got, I can get a whole bunch of atoms until it gets too difficult; retention might result in more people spending $ who otherwise didn't stick around
---
I only paid a dollar so far because of gamepass. That's all they're getting.
---
No, I was showing that in order to get the wire through walls still you can use a regular wooden window and switch it into a solid wall of your choosing. That’s only part of the problem though
---
Edit: because I usually use doorways for my electrical work, then switch to a solid.
---
Regs reached with weight capacity so he could not add it to his inventory.... 
---
had he only invested into the pocketted mod....
---
Where? I just read the patch notes. Nothing about being able to switch wall types.
---
I was messing with my camp earlier and thought I was forgetting something, this is it. Sucks they take out the day I start messing with the wallpaper
---
Well...
---
I could get behind that reward
---
Great, and I'm sure when they "fix" it in 3-6 months we will have to make them shielded again costing flux. Morons.
---
another post covered this but the standard sights lack a rear sight while the glow sights have one. really wack
---
I know this isn't the thread for it but...
---
There is a good bit of lore concerning Doosley (I think was his name) scattered around Atlas.
---
Aaaaand I have a legacy camp.  So ridiculous- what an unnecessary "fix".  
---
But hey, a lot of you need to learn how to use conduits and it shows
---
Understood
---
pretty sure they failed to actually add them in game
---
Because you don't have to?
---
If you're converting a single ammo type you convert it, get the success screen and then instead of hitting the next prompt just hit back once and you're right back where you were selecting the amount.  You only "need" to back out if  you want to switch ammo types and you only "need" to do that if you want to save yourself all of five seconds.
---
Why you drop it though?
---
this shit is happening with me I’m freaking out I don’t wanna restart but it looks like that’s my only option
---
Yes! This was perfect! Thank you!!!
---
Yep, has been happening to me ever since it’s release.
---
true, i always forget about this existing :D
---
Perhaps people should stop rewarding their laziness and incompetence by not subscribing to Fallout 1st.
---
I'm going to run into the other problem. I should finish the run in about 14 days then will have 3 weeks of nothing to do with challenges. Which means I'm probably only going to log in to grab the daily bullion over those 3 weeks.  
---
The old way of giving Atoms for challenges is just way better.
---
Yeah but I thought they meant new plans not plans we can already have.
---
Full time job = 40 hours a week which is 2080 hours a year. Working this game as a full time us 3.65 years to 7600 hours. All for 760 atoms. That's a bargain.
---
Tier 3 rewards...looks like stuff I sell for 5 caps
---
No, all they need to do is activate the event, literally everything is in the game already. Multiple people have said it works just fine, they really don't have a reason not to other than story.
---
So basically all those cool base building tutorials are now useless.
---
No, it only works when you are not in any type of group
---
Wow, couldn't come up with an actual counter argument huh?  
---
My other posts get downovoted because like you this sub is full of a lot of salty crybabies that think every fucking thing Bethesda does is an insidious conspiracy to wring them of all their money.  
---
This change is obviously intended to help them sell double sided interior walls... that don't even exist... just like how the legendary run was designed to make you buy rank ups... and repair/scrap kits were designed to be the first step in turning the atom shop into a massive P2W cash cow... just like how the same went for the fridge... or how they were going to start selling more conveniences like an ammo converter or food processor through 1st to force people into buying it... sure is weird how none of these conspiracies ever come true huh?
---
the original masks in the middle ages were also just some sort of signs. they were made of leather without a filter or something. so in fact, to me, they are some kind of definition of a cosmetic item.
---
What? These complaints are valid when we can see the other types of work theyre shoveling out. We are paying for a product and have every right to complain. The hooded rags dont work and havent since beta. Why havent they been fixed yet? Its a pretty simple fix, they just need to move the value of the slots the outfit occupies around. Takes 5 minutes. Fallout 76 is like going to a store to buy a sandwhich. You expect the sandwhich but when you get it someone has taken a few bites out of it and they dont give a fuck so your left with a a half eaten sandwhich that someone picked all the turkey off of. 13 dollars a month for 1st, 60 dollars for a triple A game plus micro transactions. Look at the other products theyve released, ESO, skyrim, FO4 etc. Look at how those products stand up to today. Weve had 1 rerelease of fo4, weve had shitty updates for fo76. Take a look at TES, 57 different versions of skyrim and ESO. Thats their love child and asking for a working product on the other side of the fence isnt unreasonable when we can see the love their other products are receiving.
---
Strange. I have one wall with double sided, and it is still there, ot was not removed.
---
Newsflash: you can still cancel :O
---
Bethesda seeing the community reaction: “Whoops!”
---
What a lame event, turned in 10k steel, and got overencumbered and max Caps, all just useless crap. The rewards sucks and the grinding is going to be super boring. Just hope the BOS dlc will be good.
---
Okay I thought so... They can't even add shit right lmao
---
Not big on reading huh? The fix is un wanted and not needed and should have been a low priority at best while things that effect gameplay are still broken and in the game. Now we have broken combat, skins, and mechanics and now we are way more limited on how we build are camps. No fun allowed.
---
How it should work...scrap ammo into its crafting parts...ie lead/steel/gunpowder...use mats to craft ammo you WANT!
---
Literally
---
Seriously though.... I'm tired of atom shop beds all being so small.  And I thought this sleazy bed was supposed to vibrate.  Another disappointing missed opportunity.
---
I noticed they added some sparkles on "legendary" rewards. Maybe that's the cause.
---
I got a mature nuka shine bomb from one of thoses boxes. Opened like 10 of them. Nothing else worth mentionning.
---
Post this
---
As an aside, do you happen to know if mini nukes can be dropped at death with the perk card Last Laugh?
---
Think I got it wrong tho. Laptop with frog legs and jumpin over the toddlers’ heads?
---
Lmfao I didnt know anybody even played this anymore
---
Shots fired!
---
**What exactly is being _"exploited"_?**
---
CONGRATULATIONS BETHESDA!!!!! I am a massive fallout franchise fan, i own every single fallout game, even the ones you didn't make, i defended you guys against my friends saying s\*\*\* will get better, now you come out with this update and restrict us from changing the CAMP building, WTF????!!!!!! I am a massive builder, i have rebuilt my camp in Fallout 76 i don't know how many times due to me enjoy building, i have done hundreds of playthroughs on Fallout 4 just to build, so i understand the fans hatred here, i am a builder, i am a major builder and Atom shopper, so i fully understand why the fans are mad and i am in full agreement with them, you went TOO FAR this time. you need to fix this mistake, so do the SMART thing here, unfix what you did to the CAMP, i shouldn't have to list what you did. i enjoy playing a Fallout game with my friends, so my closing notes FIX YOUR S\*\*\*
---
I’m going to have to ask you to get all the way off my back about these references.
---
I’ve happily let my subscription run out, and stopped playing altogether after this update. I don’t think it will matter, tho. There are SO many bootlickers in this community, so many people that empathize with Bethesda for their cheap money grubbing tactics. I feel like a lot of folks that support Bethesda have never been part of a game community that actually gives a shit about its consumer base, and it shows.
---
*is definitely an exploit
---
OOTL: what happened? My wallpaper is fine,  but maybe not doubled up?
---
It's actually *more* of a pain to use now... at least for me. 
---
I had it down where I could just spam the 'X' button once I locked in what type I wanted. Now that method is just asking for trouble.
---
Ive canned my sub renewal. Just going to hoard as much scrap as I can until current month runs dry. Brotherhood wont get shit from me
---
60 mins and 30 seconds. Something like that
---
after every patch it feels more and more like a mobile game, 
---
just adding grinding stuff with time caps, and really no new content for veteran players.
---
[Can we get serious here for a moment. Bethesda - we're still missing FO1st advertised rewards &amp; quality of life additions are almost two years past due. What gives?](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gnb6zv/can_we_get_serious_here_for_a_moment_bethesda/)
---
Do it now. Before that period ends. They won’t change it back because technically it’s an exploit.
---
I'm pretty sure you need animal friend for the megasloth.
---
Tldr no one cares anyways
---
😂
---
This killed the ability to make a courtyard as well.
---
You built a 2nd floor, hung walls from it, then stuck half walls on the bottom of the hanging walls (which typically sunk into the ground, and you out a 3rd wall on top of the floor...then remove the floor. 
---
Ive got a huge courtyard with planted trees, open sky, and 2.5 high walls. Now i cant replicate it (i tried on another character). 
---
Completely unnecessary.
---
lol my 3 endurance melee can tank the queen in a f'in hazmat suit. PA is worse than useless
---
I also noticed it was deleted when checking for updates. There is another one there that looks interesting by Lyravega.
---
Honestly though, I'm thinking of trying to maintain it for myself since it's so good.
---
Good to see that more and more people are waking up to this reality.
---
Exactly. I NEED to do more work but not because I WANT to. It doesn't save me any time. You're suggesting that I should have only one ammo type to convert every time (which most people don't) and it's easy as hell. It's not. It's tedious, cumbersome, and ridiculous. I can't even see how much ammo I have while I'm doing this either. And on top of that they actually dumbed it down further by keeping ammo types that you don't have any of on the display now. Plus they put the buy and sell in the same menu now so someone can actually buy or sell ammo accidentally that they didn't intend to if they're trying to convert ammo quickly. I understand what you're saying but it's not better, just different.
---
She always disappears when there's a colossal problem.
---
Can these walls be snapped to a foundation or do you just plop them on open ground?
---
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
---
--
---
Also
---
What exactly did they change?
---
Oh, I understand completely. I'm not saying that this is a perfect solution, but it's something for people to work with while (I hope) Bethesda listens to the community. This kind of change to the game should have never been considered. It's really only further evidence that the people making changes to this game don't actually play it. If they did, they would know how valuable these kinds of glitches are. Unless they also implemented a two-sided interior wall at the same time, there was no reason for this fix.
---
Microtransaction.
---
Really? Is it broken now?
---
The beta is because it makes it easier to release updates quicker. Pretty sure Fortnite still does it.
---
I too would like to know. I was thinking about the same thing the other day
---
I've always interpreted "interior walls" as just being walls you can paper on both sides.  Am I missing something?
---
Because a new player can totally afford to drop 1k steel on a whim in the vain hopes they get lucky and roll something not totally garbage./s
---
Nevermind. Just a display bug and my limited solo play recently. Just remember to unequp and re-equip the perk.
---
So you want to complain to Bethesda that they removed a way for people to glitch camp stuff to have floating camps and wires through walls...just be glad you had it working for as long as you did, move on, grow up.
---
Check the plan and mod database:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/g3dqwa/plan_and_mod_database_wastelanders_update_is_now/
---
I feel like when people say interior walls, bethesda will take that at face value and come out with something dumb. The phrase in itself suggests a different wall type.
---
With the very long list of complaints and requests, why on earth world they waste their time 'fixing' something everyone universally liked? For two years they have dragged their feet on every update, taken the least appealing course of action whenever they get a chance. Why on earth would you expect us to give them the benefit of the doubt? 
---
When they start giving players what they ask for I'll start giving them credit, but here we are again, another update with furious angry players. If you wanna fellate Bethesda for a job well done, don't be surprised at the weird looks you get.
---
I'm going to pack rat like a mofo until my FO1 sub runs out(fuck BOS), then I don't know. Buy Borderlands 3 and the Outer Worlds so I can remember what wasteland joy feels like, maybe, until it possibly gets better and they fix shit.
---
Won't be spending time or money until they do.
---
They unnecessarily waste time/effort to "fix" this but leave dozens of other major bugs still in game...
---
I’m so sorry you didn’t get in on the fight.  That is frustrating.  
---
If there’s a bright light, maybe it taught you not to fiddle about.  Once you launch the nuke, get to the fight zone.  Other players may have been watching your name over the silo (on the map).  They know a Queen fight is coming and they’re prepared.  You’ve gotta get your hit in fast sometimes.  
---
I launch a lot of Queen fights, and I like a good fight with several waves of adds.  It irritates me when a team rushes in and kills her in 20 seconds.  So, I know exactly how you feel.  But it goes with the territory.   Makes you appreciate the Good fights!!!   And other players appreciate them too, I promise.  
---
You keep at it, keep launching those fights!
---
I come from ff14 and honestly . Treating this game as a mmo makes it feel better, I genuinely feel like a better player after ff14.
---
I think it would be really cool but you would use so much 10 mm ammo since dps I don't think is great...
---
Maybe with right build you could do vats headshots with the stealth damage bonuses?
---
Why the fuck does there need to be so many rules about building anyway? "You can't place that floor without stairs, it would be inaccessible" who the fuck cares? How is that somehow unbalancing? Let me do whatever I want.
---
updates...
---
Yup, definitely not available. I’ve been waiting for the SS deep pockets for awhile and was excited to grab them today. Too bad half of the shit on the patch notes didn’t seem to get addressed at all. The only things that did change was sabotaging creative camp building and a freeloading BOS wannabe at the Atlas Observatory. Way to go, Bethesda... thumbs down emote.
---
I have the SS. I used to run enclave forest operative underarmor. SS is +4 S, +2 P, and +4 E. Great for a bloodied melee.
---
i wish they would have used the mechanics from the vendors and give us a slider for how many we want to convert, because most of us want to convert everything we have! 
---
why are you forcing us to have left over ammo we cant do anything with?
---
Seems to be a new bug, it's happening to me too.
---
Honestly this whole situation makes me sad. I genuinely love this game through all of its bullshit because I can spend hours playing it (can get boring but I find my own fun)
---
Delaying the wendigo collosus event has really ticked me off. How many times are they going to disappoint us by delaying something so close to its release? They've had months! It was the same thing with Wastelanders, we were supposed to get that last FALL and look how long that took to come out.
---
The only thing they're good at consistently updating is the atom shop because it makes them money.
---
Don't get me wrong I know with covid it's hard to work from home with this but at this point I'm done giving them the benefit of the doubt.
---
And let's face it, they're not fixing this auto complete bug and they've never had any intentions of doing so. In all honesty it just feels like a massive ploy to get us spending money on atoms to rank up. 
---
The game should not be this exhausting.
---
On which platform are you playing?
---
I'm on steam and went to buy a mod there today and I saw the deep pocketed and ultralight mods in the list. They were for the platebody though and I didn't check if those mods were available for other pieces since I went there to buy a buttstressed mod.
---
Edit : oh nvm, just read someone bought the plans but they're not working lol. My bad.
---
They will add it. In 2021.
---
LOL @ bugged, will not drop
---
They stuffed cloth and flowers in the long nose so they don't have to smell all the dead bodies.
---
I agree 100%. I just bought it thinking it would be a gas mask.

Secret Bethesda Meeting Audio
---
"We have a choice we can fix our 'cannot place item it is floating' bollox &amp; the janky arse other build bollox
---
OR
---
We can remove one of the ways clever little gamers use to mitigate against the janky arse building mechanics"
---
"The second one, they'll like that best"
---
Instead of donating to the BOS, why not everybody put their steel in the blue suitcase in Watoga Station as a protest :D.
---
thank you!
---
This would be a nice touch indeed, not even necessarily for rewards, but an extra few lines in a convo somewhere or something of the sort. A funny nod to a daily we've all done more times than we care to admit, and certainly more times than it's worth it.
---
So, of course, I fully expect it to slip by Bethesda in all the focus BoS is getting from here on out. I mean... They still haven't even bothered to fix how the item itself duplicates and/or just stays in our inventory even after completing the quest.
---
Not without a suppressor you won’t. Even after two years it’s still missing the suppressor. Shameful.
---
It was so obviously a make work project to begin with, the shitty rewards are just a kick in the teeth.
---
Wow! THE one good thing about this update!
---
They sit on the ground and have a little bit of freedom (not much) in terrain collision.
---
Why would they have done this?  Read the fucking patch notes, there's three different fixes specifically concerning walls.  They either A) Had to make this change in order to actually fix something that was not allowing people to place walls or B) Unintentionally made this change while they were fixing something related.
---
Wow, what far out and crazy ideas those are right?  It would make SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much more sense that they're actually just being total pricks and paving the way to sell something that doesn't exist right?
---
Hello. You can build there, I tried it for the first last Saturday. If you start with a foundation tight to the side farthest from West-Tek and then build in a spiral around the satellite dish. About half way around where the dish is connected to it's support, there's a little space where you will need to move your camp to - don't just reposition the C.A.M.P terminal, actually redeploy your camp. This will obviously then undo your spiral. You just need to replace what you did in the last step, but now you can continue to the top and get into the dish itself. You can build in the dish be coming down from what you used to hey to there in the first place. There will likely be other methods that I've not yet tried. You can certainly placed vending machines in the dish. You can also use this same method to get into the massive (water?) silo tower on the train tracks in the Savage Divide. Again, you can actually build inside. I can send you pics if you like. I didn't actually do a full build at West-Tek as I discovered it whilst scouting for a spot for an experimental farm theme I wanted to build. But I did enough to know that the next build I do will be there.  I hope this is of some help to you. Let me know if you have any questions.
---
So I think I know your sexual preference now lmao
---
Holy molly, thanks for the info! If it's working, that's the next thing I'll buy then.
---
Oh yeah good point. It never gets updated.
---
Mailbox?
---
The only real incentive is a Purveyor sale
---
Not sure if there's a current glitch about modding or creating it but I have it with the shielded mod (costs 450 bullion for the whole set)
---
There's just two things missing:
---
- a "convert all" button
---
- removal of options you can't fulfill (which was already the case)
---
I'll probably renew. Still having a lot of fun with the game
---
They also only gave us one variant of the thin barbed wire wall.  In Fo4 there's 2 different styles and both have a version with barbed wire and without.
---
I just spent 10k of steel before I realized the rewards suck. I want a refund!!! I'm not going near that place before the BOS shows up.
---
I literally just got a free mod that adds them in Fallout 4.
---
They keep giving us rehashes of the Christmas scorched event and each one is progressively worse.  After killing a few mole miners and opening ornate pails and getting garbage, I stopped bothering with it.
---
The same is true for this event.
---
I was not excited about patch 21 at all.  That is because I learned that with Bethesda, you always have to read the fine print.  The only thing that the patch notes guaranteed being in the patch today was  a guy asking you for junk.
---
And that is it.
---
They kept mentioning the colossal problem event and future plans for the game- but if you read closely (and I mean very closely), they never actually said that colossal problem would drop today.  That is but one example of how they mislead people.   I saw several people nuking Monongah mine and I felt really bad for them.
---
It wasn't until today's patch notes when they finally said that Colossal problem isn't contained in today's patch.
---
Another example is the scorched beast  queen.  Since wastelanders, we have not been able to cripple her and force her to  land. Bethesda kept saying they were aware of it and it would be fixed in a future patch, and many assumed it would be today's patch.
---
Nope.
---
*Jar Jar Binks
---
(come on)
---
You're right. I heard so many people begging and hoping this release would fix the double sided wall cheat, and I'm glad Bethesda gave us what we asked for.  Good day.
---
because the game has a garbage reputation and even if they turned it around 100% of the way i doubt it would ever have more than a niche audience
---
Can now confirm it does work
---
I used to be annoyed with this game, now I just laugh.
---
*Sheffield liked that*
---
Very good post.
---
1 weapon issue I run into all the time is ADS in 3rd person may get locked on, leaving me stuck in ADS u til I switch to 1st person.
---
Only on auto weapons though

Bethesda Meeting Actual Audio Transcript
---
"Straw poll people shall we deal with NW cheaters? 
---
Or mess with the creative gamers making work arounds to our awful C.A.M.P building problems? You know the people whose videos help other players &amp; encourage people to stay in the game"
---
"Lets do the second one then get pizza &amp; watch Reddit explode, lol!"
---
This is happening to me right now on Xbox , such bs
---
I lock my water lander.
---
I honestly think everyone should boycott the BoS turn-in as a protest to how shit Bethesda has been since release. How embarrassing would it be if NONE of the milestones were met? It would send a clear message.
---
Cito’s great-grandparents
---
Animal friend 3 should do it
---
&gt; Or just make it so you can enter the amount manually. 
---
Eh, we still can't even do that at actual vendors...... Seeing it implemented here would be equivalent to a miracle.
---
Good to know, so do I need max for the card?
---
NOOOOOOOO
---
On the positive side, it still looks cool and only takes up the face slot, so you can wear helmets with it. Looks awesome paired with the drifter outfit and imposter sheepsquatch helmet, [here's my example](http://imgur.com/a/B0odfe7)
---
Just a shite update.  The ammo converter is WORSE than it was before.  It doesn't list the amounts or rounds, just 1x, 100x, and 1000x (blank space), and lists them all whether you have any or not, leading to multiple 'transaction failed' and forcing you to exit and try again, as pressing back button leads to a blank screen.  My BOS underarmor fatigues got stripped of it's shielded lining and repurposed into an outfit now for no apparent reason, probably to be re-used or sold as something else, or to get people to buy their camo gimp suit that is broken and can't be modded.  The red tool box full of scrap at the overseers camp now just spawns a couple junk items for new characters, to hinder players using a new character for level and repair challenges.  Vats is completely borked now, and I have to kill forest ghouls several times, as their health just refills.  They screwed up some people's camps with even more unnecessary building restrictions.  And now they added a scrap collection grind that pretty much requires people to pay for a sub to get some re-skinned crap and duplicate plans recycled from older events.  Just to name a few things...
---
Holy fuck what the fuck is wrong with Bethesda. Clearly we are angry, have they even responded to this?
---
I just want the nuka lamp but it's stuck in a bundle :(
---
Damn, what's your method for steel? I'm running a few LitS a day for weapon scrap but that's definitely over 20 minutes.
---
See if you can throw on the prisoners collar too. Itll give a red glow. I wore the mask with the FO1st Ranger outfit.
---
Besides to the tricks, this change will only lower the QoL, and I remember this function is since the day one right? what mind on them to think it's something proper to change anyway :&lt;
---
Oh.. according to the patch note you also can't connect the wall to the roof now? Guess my base is GG then
---
I have thrown stupid cash at ESO because I have fun and it makes me feel good to play, for the most part.
---
Not a whole lot of feeling good here.
---
Building mechanics. Can you naturally build double-walls without a workaround? No. This is known as an “exploit”. Shocking, I know.
---
I have double-walls at my camp, and I love being able to use wallpapers this way. Still, loving it doesn’t make it NOT an exploit of game mechanics. (Downvotes expected.)
---
There is no reason for me to donate my scrap now. Cancelling 1st. Boycotting this event. They can keep their shitty BOS beret. The legendary run screen runs at 3 fps after the new update so it takes me like 4 minutes to scroll across my bloody rewards.
---
Bethesda Whatsapp group transcript
---
"Wouldn't it be great if all the C.A.M.P.S were little boxes"
---
"They should be already the build function is borked"
---
"They are still getting around it"
---
"Lets bork it some more that will stop their fancy arse work arounds"
---
Great idea! I'm pretty sure I've got one in my stash somewhere, thanks for the recommendation :)
---
Cool thx a bunch
---
No! It’s people like you they’re ripping the piss out of! Don’t renew, they haven’t even given you the shit they advertised for Fallout 1st yet. 
---
Persistent workshops were promised. Got that? No? Oohhh how about the larger CAMP budget? I don’t think so! Wait. I don’t *think* so, I *know* so. Hmmm... What else did they promise? As yes. Atom Shop discounts and regular Fallout 1st exclusive updates. No and no. Reskinning the tent and Ranger outfit are *not* updates, and they weren’t even monthly.
---
It’s people like you letting those cunts take advantage of you. Normally, I’d let you go for it. It’s your money. But you’re not only giving them a green light to abuse you, they’re taking it as a green light to fuck the rest of us over. All of us have to band together on this because it’s not acceptable.
---
Do you think diluting the Christmas presents and labelling it a new reward would roll *anywhere else at all?* No? I’ll tell you why it rolls here. People like you are literally paying them to do it. They’re getting money for it, which teaches them it’s acceptable, when it’s really not.
---
I believe you can still wallpaper 2 sides using the flamethrower trap to break walls. I saw a post on it but havnt tried myself.
---
You mention the Gold Bullion grind - I haven't even started that yet and based on what I read on this sub I'm dreading it.  It sounds like a real drag and I think that's largely why I've been avoiding the main Wastelanders content.  I did the initial Wayward questline and I thought it was never gonna end.
---
You also make an excellent point about the problem of getting more and more camp items you can't even use because the budget is so stingy.  The budget restrictions feel so artificial, I mean there were like 30 settlements in FO4, more with the DLCs, and I built them up to ridiculous levels.  Some 4x over the budget using the gun scrapping glitch.  The game continued to run just fine.  I know it's not an apples-to-apples comparison but c'mon.  There has to be some middle ground.  I highly suspect that the limits are due to the limits of console hardware and the need to maintain parity between platforms.
---
The game certainly gets a lot of flak and some of it is warranted while some of it is just outright false.  But even the most passionate fan will acknowledge the ever-expanding list of bugs and mistakes.  I've been on the fence for a couple of months now about whether or not to renew Fallout 1st and today Bethesda made the decision for me.  This is like the 4th or 5th time one of their major patches has really rubbed me the wrong way.  Not gonna give them money just to piss me off.
---
We should be able to turn in our extras for rewards once they actually show up
---
Absolutely I'm boycotting it, I love this game but they just took the last straw.
---
Mind if I make another post of this to get it to flow around.
---
I scanned and repaired and took off all my mods and it worked. I’m not sure which was the cause but I did put my mods back on and it was fine so probably just the scan
---
But how does doing this show them? All that will do is prevent us from getting the rewards.
---
If you skip the Settlers stuff you will miss out on &gt;!a free Chinese Stealth Suit.!&lt; Do both Raiders and Settlers until you have to chose do Vault 79 with one side or the other.
---
I replayed FO3 and New Vegas 7/8 times, full completes. It's been months and I still haven't gotten the fuckers at Foundation to like me enough.
---
Just...how can you make a Fallout game not fun? *How*?
---
Please correct me if I'm wrong but I think you can hold the circle button to leave the console without going through the menus. On Xbox or PC use whatever button is equivalent to the circle button.
---
I also can't wait for the most overhyped game ever made.
---
It's really not that much cash and I enjoy the game. I should be able to spend shit on the things I like. It's okay if you don't want to
---
They didn’t work in 1348, so why should they work in 2102?
---
I can't find any posts showing what's the the atomshop, all I can find are these dumb ones complaining about stuff.
---
This is tame compared to what it was at launch. Tho the patch that broke armor legendary effects trying to fix the '+250 defense while reloading' was a nasty one.
---
They still didn’t protect the wearers from airborne or waterborne hazards.
---
You need to invest some time in finding G&amp;B5, 3-4k each time.
---
"hello, yes I want to sue this company for making a buggy video game that I don't like"
---
"...yes I'm serious"
---
"...hello?"
---
Aaaaand there goes the flamethrower trick.
---
Not complaining dude, I love the mask. Just pointing out something I though could be tweaked/altered.
---
Veteran players already dump or sell those for dirt cheap.
---
&gt;No SS armor Deep Pockets, as advertised.
---
They have become notorious for this sort of crap.  It's like a constant pattern with them.   The pattern goes like this:
---
1. They publish an article about an upcoming official patch
---
2. The article about the upcoming patch also mentions "future improvements" to weapons, armor, etc.  But if you read the fine print, the article ***doesn't actually say*** that the future improvements are actually contained in the upcoming patch. \]
---
3. Bethesda basically has a habit of writing articles about upcoming patches where they say "by the way there's other stuff that will be improved too in the future" (but doesn't  say  that the improvements are in the upcoming patch, but doesn't say that they aren't  either which leads to frustration and confusion).
---
How much is it? I found an atomshop update post but it only shows the bundle :/
---
They helped , not as good a a modern day gas mask but at the time it was much better then smelling LITERALLY a ocean of bodies.
---
Get it if you like the way it looks, other than that.. it's garbage.
---
Like I said up top I don’t need upvotes or rewards I’m just genuinely worried. But I got a reply 20 mins ago. She’s doing fine and luckily the explosion was kilometres away from them. But yeah then again, sorry if you feel that way. I just wanted to spread the word to everyone to pray for the victims
---
The moaning grenades. Aaawwww yeah.
---
As much as this helps the couse I don't think it changes anything but good on you man, lest money thier way seems to open their ears.
---
500 atoms if I remember correctly :)
---
Perhaps delete the post instead of walking it back while it’s so fresh?
---
I don’t think making uo a story is appropriate mate, I’m genuinely worried about the people there. I’m sorry if you feel that way but yes it’s a typo. Like I said. Imm not looking for your upvotes. You can ignore this post if you want I just want to spread the word to everyone in this sub to pray for the people in lebanon. Please have an open mind about it :) have a nice day
---
There is no fix, bethesda says they're aware and trying to fix it, but we all know how that goes...
---
They probably won't release it before the "Big One Wasteland" balance/nerf update, becaue the Event is a PVP event. Most people would not participate in a PVP event where you compete against buged/legacy weapons after the first few tries.
---
Me too, I've read about it but haven't tried. But the flamethrower trick is far more tedious IMO
---
They are destroying this game with there stupid and unnecessary decisions
---
Did they?
---
Better be some mask for 500 atoms
---
I used to run an Arma 2 server with a modded DayZ group, and had around 30 mods. When I made a change, we backup the server, test it on a separate system and made sure everything worked, then went live. It's got to be easier for a company that does this for a living. If I can do it so can you Bethesda
---
My base is illegal now due to the unnecessary change :&lt;
---
It just means walls that have the interior look on both sides. So brick walls with that are white on both sides and can have wall papers applied to both.
---
I found out that during my time playing WoW I got insanley spoiled with the quick bugfixes and hotfixes they rolled out (some within hours of finding the buggs).
---
Quests repeatable for example that keeps popping up when serverhopping and then entering the specific areas for the quests. That is actually harmfull in a way due to exp actually beeing valuable and now with the rewardrevamp.
---
I am however no gamedev so I have no idea if it has to do with some backend stuff in the end but it's the same with alot of offline gamea that would take modders as u said maybe a month tops to fix.
---
Old Ammo Converter:
---
-Displays ONLY the available ammo fit to convert
---
New Ammo Converter:
---
LOL nope, you have to first check in your inventory the amount of each ammo you have THEN go to the ammo converter and do the process...
---
Hey, Bethesda, how hard is it to include a simple command as: 
---
"Convert all selected ammo? Yes/No"
---
"Buy all selected ammo? Yes/No"
---
I'll give Bethesda my money but it sure as $hit wont be for Fo76.  I'll gladly pay for ESO+   at least that game is in a finished, working state.
---
It's doing it on PS4 as well. Feature or bug? Who knows?
---
Just like the BOS to keep all the good shit for themselves.  Well played Bethesda.
---
ほんとにありがとうね
---
Jesus
---
Now you're the one complaining bruh hahaha
---
Unplug it for an hour or so and give it another try.
---
Hope Bethesda sees this.
---
yeah if you had the walls in place before the patch it will stay. problem is I tried to rearrange the inside of my house and it doesn't work anymore.
---
Use a flamethrower and move on with life (until that gets patched, too).
---
It wasn't so much the complaining i was annoyed about it was that I didn't know what everyone was complaining about lol. Now that I know I can join in!
---
It was always slow to move around, but now it’s even slower and the frame rate is super low, maybe 5-10
---
Probably it's because mods contributors will be less responsible to the game itself.One can fix a glitch rather simple, but it's hard to fix a glitch without creating more potential glitches, and tbh, the "unofficial patch" for TES V did exactly so, it fixed some bug and introduced some more wierd ones...i would rather not recommand one to use that mod.
---
That bug may have moved more wallpaper sales in Atom shop if they just left it alone.
---
Honestly if the building mechanics were good i would have probably stayed as an early adopter. They aren't though... for all the amazing things that have been built the amount of frustration and pain dealt out by the creation engine is incalculable.
---
Last I saw he was at The Crater!
---
This is a good idea!
---
It's bizarre we haven't been given the ability to place interior walls in the first place. Bethesda employees really are a bunch of knuckle draggers
---
I'm actually on board with the side wall paper both sides bit. Less camp budget used.
---
same, this glistening polish is a real return to this game's roots!
---
LOL, that how it always was for me, but I just checked it now, and it seems faster for me, so go figure...
---
There goes my tidy connectors and powered terminal. 
---
There goes practically the entire use of power conduits. 
---
I had so much fun basically rebuilding my camp every 3 days and now? Half my build plans are gone.
---
If they haven’t been in touch from the start... then they’re still out of touch
---
Oh, I see. Thanks for the information. I am sure I wont move my camp, and most likely I do not have to redone my interior for a time, but I keep this in my mind.
---
I cant remember the names of the quests, but if it's the quest to raid vailt 79, you have to enter the code on the keypad to get in the cave.
---
Think I am one the same quest. I was doing it today when the servers went down for maintenance.
---
Noticed this, too. Cursor moves like I’m trying to punch in a dream.
---
Looking at a room that's mostly wallpapered but with a giant chunk of ugly wood in it kinda leaves builders feeling incomplete. Or as I call that incomplete feeling, FO76
---
Stop right there - don’t do that event. Don’t even think about it. Until bethesda can get their shit together the community needs to boycott the stupid atlas event
---
I paid $70.00 essentially on release day, first when it came out etc. I'm beyond fed up at this point. They continuously show they don't give a fuck about our input on anything.
---
I only know but I thought exactly the same the first time I bought loads. Really annoyed me I spent all those caps and still needed flux to make them.
---
Nah fam i mean the challenge xd
---
Been like that since it came out over a month ago. But of course, Bethesda likes to patch the good bugs, like double sided walls, instead of bugs like this
---
I lined mine without an issue.
---
Hurricane Patch 21!
---
it is animal friend no matter what you are taming
---
That alien blaster looks beautiful
---
No. Not even close. They are consistent though every update is bad news.
---
I can't even make a bloody bedroom anymore.
---
Hmm, I wonder why this person wants a flamethrower on the same day double-wall capabilities are patched...
---
They added deep pockets for the chest, but thats it. No addition for the limbs.
---
Cry a little more cuz u didn’t finish yet. Do you know how ridiculous you sound?
---
They just don't care about this game. They're looking ahead to Starfield and the next Elder Scrolls. This was a quick cash grab to fund projects they're more interested in. Remember, Fallout isn't a Bethesda original. They have no personal connection to it. They like that it was a solid money maker brand that they could then drag through the mud and shoot dead behind a shed with this mobilesque grinder of a triple A game.
---
Yeah, this is just some dude who wants to make sure they have enough supplies
---
Only today I saw him outside Vault 94.
---
I just laughed so hard at this XD
---
Me: Welcome to my small C.A.M.P with little to no decoration! Please take some food and refreshments as you must be needing them after your trip here.
---
Them: *Takes the crops and drinks that are unlocked then looks through my store, does/doesn't buy something/things and notices my locked door seeing if it's locked*
---
Me: Please don't go in there that's my room for when I have to be AFK, there's nothing inside besides my Collectron Jingles he gets me ammo.
---
Them: *Waits for me to leave or go AFK and picks my lock, breaks in and picks the lock my Collectron has and steals my resources (edit: then kills me before I can react fully) and server hops to a private session before he gets killed*
---
Me: Wow.. Another thief that kills me with some duped legacy weapon before I can react and attack them for breaking into my room, now their destroying my camp.. Gotta rebuild it in another session now
---
Nope, found him outside Vault 94 two hours ago.
---
The wanderer was near New Gad the other day for me and I was wondering if how long it would take her to high-hoof it back to my camp near foundation.
---
Maybe she thought there was water still to take a bath in finally.
---
(It was a retrieve mission)
---
Ffffffflamethrower.
---
I did 4 just as a test and yeah it's bad. I could get the same chems, stims and caps running events , more probably. One plan. Ultra light build robot. I dont consider myself a super dedicated player I even quit for half a year. Wastelanders has been a real motivation to play more and even the legendary run is ok. I probably wont grind to donate or clear out my stash for this for sure.
---
Must be rough.. Sorry to hear that happen to you
---
They sure are, they have big dick energy. They have so much in fact, they’re energy weapons now.
---
Same here. I tried everything like reseting the router to cheking the game files. I think the last update caused this.
---
Well you see the double walls added a bunch of decorative ability for two rooms because both rooms would have wall paper, however with this update 1 room will have all wall paper, the other will have three walls with wall paper and one bland one.
---
No they didn't just come into the game place a million foundations and make double walls for 17 hours, they are angry... Like most people are that it's gone, surf though reddit a bit you'll find more post of it.
---
It is so bad to the building community that they are boycotting the Atlas Observatory event, and I'm with them. If none of the milestones get hit they will noticed that they fucked up and will hopefully hear our cries of agony and will hopefully fix it.
---
Another thing, you know that camp building event Bethesda is holding well a ton of people are going to be flooding the comments with (revert the camp fixes) ect.
---
They only reason I responded to this they way I did is because I fill you didn't know the whole story, I'm not arguing with you I'm just informing you tis all
---
Oh lol I thought you were talking about atlas I didn’t even bother to read the post. My bad
---
I had some really weird static at Line in the Sand today, but it was at the end when a bunch of people in power armor were all sorting through meat piles. Within a radius of the sonic generator everything was pixellated.
---
Lucky
---
They don’t use the secret service lining plans, they use casual lining plans,
---
If that helps
---
One of the top posts on every patch note post.  CM's thank the poster for it each time and "pass it to the team"
---
There is a stashbox below the donationboxes. Beside the PA- and weaponworkbench
---
Whats crazy is that they keep saying these things are fixed then release the patch an the things are clearly not working.
---
Sacraficing a chicken usually helps too. So long as the bug that stops critters from spawning wasnt reimplemented with this "patch"
---
i- i have no clue what you mean ;)
---
I'm going to go check them. Thank you so much
---
FO1st Atom shop discounts have been a thing for a long time, people just never noticed. It kinda shows how the community really doesn’t even care about the discounts, they just want something to bug bethesda about. If they did care about the discounts they would’ve actually noticed.
---
And I’m pretty sure those other things mentioned were kind of things they planned on experimenting with and were kind of far down the road. Not 100% sure but I’m pretty sure
---
Personally I don't think getting a beret is worth depleting my scrap box for... I need that steel and lead to make ammo for my minigun of death. :)
---
Bethesda: As part of our updated, we'll be adding the junk walls from fallout 4 in!  We already had the models in fo4 so it wasn't too hard :)
---
Players: Nice! Do I have to find the plans for it somewhere?
---
Bethesda: no lol you broke bitch buy it from our shop
---
They buffed the .50 receivers a while ago. The information you found are outdated
---
&gt; Communist Russia was a shithole because they'd kill people for not making their quotas in farms or factories, and then also made those quotas unreasonable because Joe Stalin was a monster with the intellectual value of a mushroom.
---
Ah Good ol' Stalin. The poster child for why capitalism is so great! Now he killed people for not working enough? That's a new one to me.
---
What about it needs fixing?
---
This is great news
---
Oh look, it’s the bimonthly outrage that will be forgotten in 72 hours, until it happens again 
---
Least it’s keeping your pitchforks from getting rusty
---
There have been considerably worst patches
---
But, nothing compares to how bad day 1 was
---
It’s not fun when this happens because I don’t get my flux and repair kits, the legendaries are usually pretty bad but can’t go wrong with extra flux
---
Yes thank you. About 30 mins ago I had four players throwing bait bombs blowing my shit up   That right there is what ruins pvp and causes all the nerfing
---
Let's be real: people were never gonna want to give up their stuff unless Bethesda bribes them with some new uber-rare trade fodder that'll quickly end up in high demand because it's new and shiny, so they'll start donating the required stuff to get said rare trade fodder to trade for (insert specific godroll armor or weapon here). 
---
But since the packages you get are reskinned Holiday Gifts, nobody's interested in it.
---
No, I understand why people are upset, and I personally think there needs to be intentional double-sided walls that are officially implemented.
---
What I don't understand is the idea that the double-sided wall glitch was the *only* thing that made someone enjoy building in this game.
---
These idiots will never get it right.  Just change it back to the way it was originally, and just add a 'convert all'.  At least it only showed options to convert it if you had enough rounds.
---
Shame they don't fucking line up, give an option to snap or come in any metric of uniform sizing. 
---
I used those things to wireup my terminal glitched into a desk for a computer desk setup to control all electronics in my camp. 
---
But hilariously without the door to wall trick the conduits are broken now too since some of the connectors block walls being placed down
---
Don’t forget your apostrophe’s!
---
One more thing so if the weapons base damage is over the pvp cap do you hit 110 or do you hit what your weapon gives off
---
Nvm traders, they (try to) shoot at underground molerats - and at CAMP items and at each other.
---
That's what gives it character 😤
---
That makes sense. Tysm!
---
Yeah I see where your coming from they way they phrased it made it seem that way.
---
I don't think that's what they meant overall by saying it would be harder to rank up. Yes they've increased it to 3 star legendary creatures, but say if someone is starting the run today they're still getting those same daily challenges. They don't customize them to different players so to complete that daily they still have to do the same exact thing regardless of how many ranks they currently have. Starting out it requires way less score points to rank up on the board, but as you progress it increases an extra 25 score points needed between each rank. So you'd need 2,475 more score points if you were at rank 99 trying to get to level 100 than being at level 1 and going to level 2.
---
Don't worry the game bricked when maintenance started too.
---
I  believe that's how it works. Yes. If it says 225, it will only hit for 110 in pvp.
---
Lyravega does look pretty good. Does some things like push explosive ammo to the top of the list.
---
It is missing the Stat tag for food and the junk weights which to me the killer part.
---
I didn't think it would be possible to maintain without the header file for xtranslate?
---
Yea that sucks but luckily I made some plasma cores for a colossal problem so I got my 1000 in
---
Day 1 here too, bought the metal cased game with the fancy extras on release day. Even bought first within the first week. I am so fucking sick of bethesdas grubby hands on this A+ intellectual property. They constantly fix problems that aren't problems. Double sided walls? Really? That's what you stick a programmer on? This is the fix we need for patch 21. Not whatever the fuck was wrong with this colossal problem that made it not able to be released.
---
So like a normal person you shrugged it off and just did Fallout stuff? Instead of getting angry about it? You must be some kind of God to have such self control!
---
I don't mind it. 250 steel isn't that much and the random crap I've been getting is good for a few caps. I understand people wanted more from it bit it's certainly not as bad and the day 1 reactors make it out to be.
---
Honestly just a whole range of plushie versions of creatures from the game would be a hit.
---
I finish next week, do I give a shit that after that I'll have like another couple of weeks without more rewards?  No, because I'm not a whiny little bitch.
---
Update worked just fine for me. :(
---
And this is how they fix it? Smh
---
It looks like Valve screwed up some server maintenance, if you sign out and sign back into Steam they should return as owned titles.
---
Theres all ready a post saying exactly what you said here lol
---
Don’t like this change at all.
---
Yup, just like taking to a wall.  Should have saved myself the time blocked you sooner when i figured it would end like this anyway.
---
I saw that post almost immediately after posting this, lol
---
Lol wargaming just put out a janky update for world of tanks and now fo:76 too?
---
If you’re gonna fix these game breaking camp glitches (sarcasm), then you might as well make camp building easier for us all. I mean, come on, Bethesda. Let us be creative for once.
---
I was a kid when the thing was announced and now I'm closer to 30 than 20. 
---
I'm hyped. 
---
Also take your salty crackers to Bethesda instead of prancing about with your random not committed condescending comments
---
Or super rare outfits
---
There are many more major bugs and exploits that have existed for months and since launch that could have been fixed. But no lets fix one of the few ways people can actually have fun in this broken mess of a game.
---
If you play a game like 76, bad for you but what did you think? This game shits on users since or even before release so why are you surprised now.
---
Don’t tell them about the Fireworks, it’s so nice to be able to reload my 50 cal and it not take all year :-(
---
Bethesda and bad patches has been around for a long time
---
Thanks for the post and doing the work.  Helps me to decide that I won't spend a single more piece of junk on this event.
---
Hey that pitchfork looks like it's made of steel! Scrap it for the Brotherhood!
---
Remember when they added Atomic shop signs in game? And then immediately removed them?
---
Not as bad as it was in beta or at launch. Still suck but it definitely sucks one iota less that it did previously
---
You guys didnt want trap bases so they had to remove those methods to stack boards and some of those ways were useful building methods lol.
---

False advertising. Fallout 1st subscribers were promised further developments including but not limiting to larger camp budgets in private worlds, larger camp building space in private worlds, persistent workshops in private worlds and more. But this hasn’t happened yet and it was advertised when Fallout 1st was originally introduced.
---
Then there’s the sheer bad quality of this game. I’d have to do more research on the law regarding this though.
---
I donated thinking the ATLAS packages would be like some sort of rare commodity that you would definitely want in your possession. I was prepping for it ever since I heard we were getting stuff for donating our resources.
---
But 250 of my steel and I read that the packages contain nothing interesting. I am not FO1st so 250 steel is a whole lot to me. I will only be donating stuff I literally have too much of that I can’t use. 
---
I really thought the donor provisions would give like caps or bullion or even a large store of XP. Something that had value. Maybe it would even contain BOS plans for this event. Maybe they would open on a certain date and you could get many custom rewards for being a donator. Maybe you could trade them in to the actual brotherhood of steel and gain rep that way or something. But *no*, they must contain alcohol that I can get from my collectron!
---
If you cancel Fallout 1st with x months remaining from an annual subscription, you don't get the money back and it cancels immediately, not after the annual sub is finished.
---
And all warfare is based on deception 🙃 stay frosty
---
Im glad i got this on game pass. I got to do the wastelanders questline and the main questline, see the map and the few cool sidequests in it. And when fo76 leaves the game pass i can just go buy low level camps entire inventory to get rid of my caps and sell all my gear for pennies. The perfect way to experience this game.
---
Ah i thought it came with suppressor, thats too bad :(
---
For over a year Bethesda has been putting out constantly misleading info about patch notes.  I learned the hard way that you gotta read the fine print when it comes to Bethesda.
---
Typical scenario:
---
1. They put out an article about an upcoming patch, giving details about what's in it.  But if you read very closely, the specifics about what's in it are pretty lackluster
---
2. The same article will also mention "future improvements" to weapons/ armor- ***but doesn't actually say that it's in the next patch.***  But doesn't say that it isn't in the patch either. So people getting excited and assume that it's in the patch and... nope.
---
It's starting to feel like Bethesda is being deliberately misleading.
---
Oh gotcha thanks!
---
But it needs to be max right?
---
You shouldn't need to use bugs or glitches in the first place. I never understand why it is such a problem to let people decide if stuff should clip or not. 
---
This game has so much potential. 
---
They just have to stop holding back peoples creativity.
---
No, it's not the worst.
---
The reactions from the community though, are becoming more severe (with good reason).
---
Straw&gt;&gt;&gt;Camel's back. You can only get your hopes up so many times before you lose it.
---
TNX!
---
I have the nuka lamps from the twitch bundle and they are now broke with the update. Its baffling how inept they are closing in on 2 years, 2 years and they still cant release a patch that does more good than bad.
---
Its hysterical. They literally told a programmer thats the bug they want this dude to work on. Double sided walls. Someone's job was to fix the fact you could put a cosmetic on both sides of a wall. Not whatever the collasus problem was that they couldn't start the event today.
---

---
If you don’t like the gameplay, then why you playing? You can’t tell me you solely play to build. If that’s the case then go play the sims.
---
It doesn’t. But you’d think they had the option to add one and also better sights by now, wouldn’t you?
---
I was wondering the same thing and Jesus Christ they're reaching for shit to complain about because this is a change that went in AGES ago and was actually warranted.
---
People used to farm  the infinite ghoul spawns for the full half hour the event was up by refusing to actually fix the jukebox or play music, which personally always pissed me off when I'd show up there first to actually complete the event and then people would show up while I was about to finish and scream at me for ruining everything.  Now as soon as someone shows up to initiate the event a ten minute timer starts.
---
I’m not necessarily boycotting I just can’t afford to donate. I’m not FO1st so junk counts against my stash.
---
I need steel for repairing my weapons and armor so I never have a straight 250 on me. 
---
This event really sucked for everyone though when the boxes are just alcohol
---
How fucking desperate are you for drama that you're still whining about  the fucking ten minute  timer on One Violent night?
---
This must be wrong like.. those rewards are vanilla content..
---
Is it all the BoS underarmor or just fatigues?
---
For the SBQ dataminers found that she had a tag that prevented her from being crippled. That wasn’t a bug - they intentionally put it there.
---
They should really just post updates on the bugs. Explain to us why this bug is super complicated and how they plan to address this. We shouldn’t have to wait weeks for an ammo converter to finally get some remedy, only for it to still be bad. (Ammo converter should just not even be a terminal - they really screwed that up and the terminal looks out of place anyway)
---
Thats not the only thing they changed or messed up.
---
[It's a cooler on one of the small iron posts.](https://i.imgur.com/TgnZQCk.png) I copied it from one of Rotomon's builds. Unfortunately it's probably not possible to make anymore. I wish we had the blue lunch pails available as stash boxes, one of those + conduits could make a much better looking mailbox (or they could just give us *an actual mailbox* as a stash box but I'm not holding my breath on that).
---
As contemporary Appalachians it’s our civic duty to keep ATLAS irradiated until Bethesda learn how to play.
---
Honestly these are all exploits. I would like more flexibility myself, but this is not the way.
---
My friend didn't even know there was an event and he's been playing daily for a few weeks. He stopped reading the little corner box on the main menu on day 2 because he thought it never changed...
---
No in game notice of the event.
---
No in game radio alerting players.
---
I told him I was heading to Atlas with my 250 steel and caught him completely unaware!
---
Got to Atlas and donated what should have been 5.56 ammo casings...
---
My reward was 2 radaways (I throw them away as I'm sitting on 100+) 2 purified waters (seriously?!) and I'm pretty sure I stopped looking at that point. 
---
I won't be giving anymore of my steel away. Far more valuable as ammo for the handmade. 
---
I won't be going out of my way searching for cork. 
---
I *might* donate things I have an overabundance of and would just drop for space but even that is doubtful. 
---
For now I'm just going back to the same routine and forgetting the event exists.
---
I have to admit Bethesda have worked very hard to alienate the community I used to play for hours every day exploring the map and enjoying the environment but now I begrudgingly log on to do some of the many daily grinds and then log off after its completed and put on a more enjoyable game that does not punish your loyalty
---
Ah ok nice
---
I think a lot of people are burnt out on this game, myself included. When I hit 100 on the legendary run I’m taking a couple weeks off.
---
For me is the opposite, i have one of those "half" walls separating the kitchen with the hole of the stairs, i want to have brick part facing the kitchen, not the wallpaper, and i can't change it, I couldn't even before this "fix"... 😕
---
You should absolutely be judging people, they're a bunch of greedy entitled little pricks.
---
Last years public event was killing fucking scorched with their horrible loot pools and non-legendary scorchbeasts for by far worse community goal rewards and zero loot crates and people managed to do the entire thing fine.  
---
Now Bethesda offers better community rewards and a little bonus on the side with some spare plans, caps and consumables and people are acting like Bethesda just walked in and shit in the middle of their carpet.
---
Don't worry, your lamps will arbitrarily work sometimes during a play session then break again.
---
They've lit my CAMP up about three times in two months.
---
They patched an exploit and the community is mad.
---
Just let us build whatever we want. If we want to make some abomination of a camp then let us. No more of this floating or clipping restrictions bullshit. Most of us want to make appealing camps and could do so much more if these arbitrary restrictions were finally lifted.
---
What we want to do hurts no one and gives Bethesda something to parade around, so why are they screwing us over and not expanding on building in any meaningful way? Building sucks in this game, but we've been making do.
---
If we let this slide we'll just be given worse and worse changes that stifle creativity.
---
And the rear sights are really clunky and practically unusable since you can't really see what you're aiming at unless the enemy is close enough
---
One wasteland has nothing to do with pvp. Will only affect pve and the level of enemies you come across.
---
Are you in power armor? Happened to me and when I exited mine I got all the pop ups from the score, thought I was randomly getting more.
---
No, didn't you read his comment?  It's not up to you what you spend your money on, *he's not letting you*.
---
Bethesda needs to either replace or redefine/evolve the roles of their community managers.  76 desperately needs CMs who can act as proper advocates for the community and be able to easily predict what sorts of dev. decisions are going to cause an uproar.  Maybe our CMs are like this and just being stonewalled.  I don't know.  Something needs to change though.
---
Cork /s
---
The rewards are the community goals.  What  the fuck were you expecting to get for donating fucking steel?  Crocolossus backpack plans to rain down from the sky?
---
And OVER A THOUSAND STEEL!?!?!?!?!
---
That's like three trips through west tek.
---
It's an exploit, what is there to think about?
---
I'm betting that when they add the interior walls, you can't snap ceilings to them or something
---
Lol
---
It's the legendary run that was the final nail for me I intend to finish this one and then scale back my gameplay and even my first subscription I used to support this game but until they learn to support us players I'm not sure if my love will return
---
I’m not digging into my mountain of scrap just to get shit I already have in abundance. There is a consensus amongst some players to sit back and watch this fiasco unfold and hopefully fail. Don’t count on F01st subs or duper’s to help.
---
These kind of masks never protected anyone. They used to be filled with an Parfum to "protect" someone from an airborne hazard.
---
These masks come from a time when science was not that advanced and people thought that the smell was the source of the plague The way they are implemented in the game, they work exactly as they did in real life
---
And why the fuck would they put uber rare plans in loot boxes that you can infinitely trade steel for exactly?  Holiday gifts and Mole Miner pails were expensive cap sinks that warranted having neat stuff inside, these fucking boxes can be gathered in massive quantities by anyone able to walk through westtek and scrap some rifles.
---
Exactly. It stays up for some 5 minutes,  as people claim. I did it couple of times without issues. Sutton station lockers worked perfectly.
---
Ohhh I get it, they are complaining about not be able to farm it like that? I'm kinda new so for me the event was the same. They actually fixed a glitch there then, seems fair
---
I agree 100% just pretending to be neutral to cut back on all the folks telling me how wrong I am. God forbid you say something positive about the game.
---
Absolutely not.
---
The fact we can't see how much ammo we have is irrelevant, as both versions had that issue, it's just that using the old one to convert more than a few hundred rounds was so unfeasible the question of do you have 3000 rounds or 3400 was irrelevant. 
---
The fact you sometimes don't have enough to use the 100x option is nothing compared to trying to actually click 200-300 times to actually convert that much ammo, no including stopping to buy ammo in between because of the point cap.
---
If you can't use the 100x option, just jump back and use the 10x option until you can't, you really don't need to be overly precise. 
---
The fact you can now actually use the damn thing to convert obscene amounts of ammo brings issues to the front that you never felt before. But let me tell you, I converted 10k rounds in one session before the update, and that took all of an hour and then some, I was able to break down 40k in about 5 minutes, with a bit of fafing about, but the new issues were just as present before, you just never actually could get to them because other problems stopped you first.
---
Do you guys know you sound like “Karen” right?
---
More freedom building would be awesome. I too love building camps, but asking for freedom to exploit (which is essentially what is going on here) is just wrong. The outcry here is evidence that the community has already normalized play beyond what the game intended.    
---
I would love to see more tools for building, but this isn't the way.
---
Since we aren't being shown *any* metrics on collection totals... 
---
Fully expect them to just congratulate us regardless of actual count. 
---
No way in hell they won't deliver all the rewards at the end of this event no matter how it goes. 
---
I've always thought the illusion of community goals was stupid. If the community fails to hit goal, you've pissed off *everyone* playing the game AND set yourself up for a massive PR debacle. You've also wasted time and money creating assets that now won't be used or seen by anyone...
---
No. We could all sit out and not donate a single scrap and they will still ring the bell and drop the confetti like we hit the milestones early and have a highly active community here. 
---
To do anything else would be financial suicide (which some are speculating is actually what they are wanting. Don't want to take the PR hit of shutting down a game that has a dedicated fanbase but trickle them away enough and you can justify it and move on to more profitable ventures.)
---
"Hard earned steel". Lolwhat? I can sum more than 1k in a single Line in  the Sand event with scrapper perk and 700ish in Westtek.
---
You can still build a creative camp, if anything more restrictions requires more creativity.
---
Day 1 beta tester - never subbed to fo1st as I don’t support that monetization scheme personally.
---
I just wanted to see the Bethesda that made the really good Fallout 4, except multiplayer. They should’ve taken their time. I remember when they announced fo76 I got a bad feeling as it felt too quick. Those bad feelings were right.
---
This newest update was supposed to bring upon a new boss. Most of the player base hasn’t even fought the normal wendigo colossus, which is a huge design flaw in Bethesda as it’s never actually shown to the player that it’s a boss you should fight. The colossal problem was going to be the thing that changed up the endgame for a lot of people and they delay it..? It was the meat of the update! Most people were looking forward to it and they delay it!
---
This ATLAS event is just a bust. The rewards are trash from the provisions and honestly there’s no incentive to  donate to the BoS. they also seem super aggressive meaning some of the player base might not even want to side with them. 
---
The only hopeful thing is that when the BoS DLC does come it will provide good story
---
I am actually losing interest in the game.
---
If you have to glitch to be doing it, maybe, just maybe it wasn't an intended mode of play.
---
They shouldn’t have made it a terminal and shouldve modeled it off of the vendor ui
---
100000 Ammo points  
---
But we're still stuck to   
---
30000 caps  
---
1000 Scrip  
---
5000 Gold  
---
Just, why?
---
No, none of us do. Karens make big deals out of nothing.
---
No. You'll get the animation but you wont get 2 items.
---
If equipped you will here Super Duper trigger but it will not give you an extra item.
---
You could in fact see whether or not you could turn in before the Patch 21 update. Yes it didn't show you exactly how many you had but it only gave you the options you had available. This version provides you with all options always.
---
Even you’re exaggerating a little bit. It’s two posts for every seven.
---
I must have spent a good two hours trying to claim my twitch prime nuka lamp thing and to this day, do not have it!
---
It doesn't seem to work, see here: https://youtu.be/fwdm3vG1YO4?t=99
---
Seems like a bug because the Super Duper triggers, but there's no extra items, and the description of the perk says "When you craft **anything**..."
---
Stop shilling. Bethesda is downright lazy and pathetic as shown with today's update. You're in a minority.
---
So at the 7600 hour mark we just stop playing? Did they really want to give us a long lasting experience or just haha funny multiplayer game
---
I've been with FO76 from the start and everything that was glitched or poorly implemented , the players found some work around to make chicken salad out of chicken sh*t and what does Bethesda do? They patch the work arounds like oh people finding a way to put lights in display cases. Bethesda bans PC mod authors who only release mods to fix what is broken. F*ck atleast put a buyer beware sign up in the Atomic shop saying "Eh product might work or might not you got a 70-30 chance it might not"like the garage doors to Red Rocket and our nuka lamps
---
You only paid a dollar? I paid £7.99!
---
I just want a Fixer skin, surely that's not too much to ask?
---
Either way, it means the same thing to us, they are not effective in their role. It also means the dev team is essentially working blind.
---
The brotherhood of "steal"
---
Bad timing is their passion.
---
Remember when 1st got introduced? Correct, it was the exact day where wastelanders got delayed for half a year.
---
They did not help. Black Death was a bacteria, not a virus and not a smell.
---
These bacteria where literally everywhere.
---
It was the lack of hygiene and clean water that made the plague so devastating. People washed their clothes in rivers polluted with faeces and washed themselves with contaminated water (if any). At that time there was no sewage system and the smell was only a sign of lack of hygiene, it was not contagious
---
Well yes but actually no. This isn’t conventional warfare. This warfare is a special kind, as we’re revolting against Bethesda’s lack of competence and the way they treat their loyal customer base like shit. We’re nothing but honest to them, with the exception of exploiting the six dupes and that one bug in camp building.
---
Yesterday I met a few guys who drop 5 bombs  and the fastest kill was 29:24 and I didn’t even had a chance to shoot her
---
What is wrong with these guys? Don't they have a GitHub or somethin?
---
I do know that this entire project was outsourced to a smaller branch in Austin I think which has never made a game before and was typically responsible for assets at most. 
---
They don’t have many resources but if it’s still in there then we’re screwed. 
---
The project was trashed from the start when they tasked this tiny little branch that has never made a game before with doing something that is 4 times the size of fallout 4 and multiplayer.
---
You made the Americans angry. (read in the voice of Jeremy Clarkson)
---
Yeah! *whips out my dick and pisses all over their power armor*
---
Now with 50% less controversy!
---
Very  interesting!  What build?
---
Turn it off, leave it for at least three minutes, and turn it back on again.
---
Never. Everything is already in game and was even active to play for a day sometimes I think due a patch bug.
---
Since we never heard anything from Bethesda about it they just dropped it like so much other content which is in the game files but were never activated.
---
The metrics have probably indicated that the main reason players continue playing, and spending ATOMS is the phenomenon known as 
---
'Chasing the dragon'. 
---
The addiction to the legendary search, the high we get when a decent one drops even when we won't use it. The desire to get that perfect drop... this is what keeps players around the longest. Beyond content, beyond building, beyond lore... it is players chasing a high that keeps us hooked. 
---
So ANY method of farming legendaries will be seen as counter productive to the long term stability of the game, from their point of view. 
---
Sure, most of what you get farming OvN was trash, but every day, probably every hour *someone* out there was finally nailing their god tier drop from it. 
---
Once they get that drop... they play around with it for a few days and now the high is gone, the chase is over and subsequently so is their infatuation with the game. 
---
Metrics are everything to companies like this. It sucks from a players standpoint but from their standpoint they were losing 'X' amount of players weekly due to it alone. 
---
I feel your pain, I miss the glory days of WS being nuked every few minutes.
---
Bro I love the lumberjack guy. I love the little protecterons that go around dispensing desirable wood product
---
Yup, straight fucked up move by Bethesda
---
We need to get this to the top of the sub, this needs to be seen.
---
I was having trouble changing from a wall tonandoor frame before the update
---
The lamps have been broken since they came out
---
Ever used a power armor reskin with heavy weapons? Most of them have the same issue. Never got fixed, so I assume it will stay this way.
---
Oh, you mean un fixing the problem that absolutely nobody considered a problem? Ugh. Bethesda again.
---
Yeah... and demand for people to get fired for incompetence... it’s impossible to tell a Karen that she’s deranged... they’re incredibly entitled.... 
---
I’m frustrated by the removal of this feature, but come on, you sound like you’re shilling for karma. It’s that last paragraph that ruined your legitimacy. 
---
"Bethesda is the most incompetent/lazy gaming company I’ve ever seen. Fire your project manager and hire somebody willing to try."
---
Is it the publisher you’re mad at? Or just the team who work on fo76? Did Nate Purkeypile give you the side eye whilst showing you where the Low Fat Coffee Whitener was?
---
Edit: Happy Cake Day.
---
HA
---
I'm canceling my 1st tomorrow when I get on. This post has convinced me.
---
I would be embarrassed if I had to tell someone I worked at the Fallout 76 division for Bethesda. This is truly jaw-dropping. These are all simple fixes and they couldn't even fix them after a month.
---
Spoiler alert: Bethesda doesn't give a fuck about their players, especially in this game. People were fools for giving them money for this trash.
---
The legendary run was the final nail for me it takes hours per day to complete everything they want leaving no time for me to play fallout as fallout should be played exploring the wasteland
---
Does this mean my Church of Mothman is effected? I did the double door trick
---
Hmm. I cannot remember a 200 pound stash limit. Granted it's been nearly 2 years since I started.
---
It's definitely up there, but not the worst.
---
I'm wobbling on the fence between they changed it to turn around and sell us double sided walls
---
They didn't mean to 'fix' this but ended up 'breaking' it when they attempted to 'fix' the walls not allowing roof issue. 
---
The sad fact is, I'm wobbling on that fence because Beth has shown both options to be more than plausible at this point.
---
Agreed. How in the hell did they manage to make it worse! All it needed was a sell all button.
---
I tried it and it doesn't work for me too. I'm on PC and I even tried changing language to Deutsch and still it doesn't work.
---
Maybe some of your installed mods allow you to do that? Can you share list of mods you are using?
---
Now you understand the pvp sub community's frustration.
---
They could, but then everyone who hasn't gotten the converter from the Run gets effectively nothing. I mean, I've only seen like 2 people without it and the ammo rewards are already basically nothing, but still.
---
Besides, I'm afraid of what they might break in the process.
---
I said it before and I will say it again, i wish they would patch the bugs that were pointed out to them and get closer to perfection then to just keep adding more stuff that will bring more bugs and set them back even further. Im a huge bethesda fan, been playing ES since morrowind, played and beat every fallout after 3. Needless to say fallout 76 is a bigger disappointment than ESO and I dont know if anyone remembers how bad that was when its first release came, but look at it now, people love it. 76 has been out for way too long for its amount of dislikes, this should be/is a triple A title but doesn't feel like it. The camp system is broken, you randomly fall through the world hurting your character. I dont know if this last one is just me but the game is also quiet. But besides that the game seems to run awful, the map size is to laugh at, its tiny. I mean come on. The camp size is tiny as well plus not to mention the broken vending system where if people buy all your stuff before the game renders they can get into your stash and steal everything(dont know if that was fixed just saw a couple posts about it couple days ago). I just wish the bethesda that made my childhood would come out say they fucked up and say they have an ultimate patch that will give more complete stash space for legendary weapons and ammo, and to say they are sorry for listening to us before. #makebethesdagreatagain
---
This game won't be around long enough for anyone to hit that mark. They will have moved the 76 division to the next Elder Scrolls
---
I didn't even knew there was more than one. The one I had was the grey/white camo one and I don't have the others so I can't test them.
---
Just roll unyielding +str on all your shit and carry more weight than I can in calibrated excavator
---
Interior walls would be nice. It's incredible that they do not exist, when most wallpapers are Atom shop items, often included in pricey bundles. 
---
I don't buy those bundles because I don't have base budget for those, or stuff doesn't work like I imagined it would. 
---
They encourage box filled with Atom shop stuff, and think it's what everyone should be happy with. Without things like interior walls, the incentive to make appartement like builds ( with separate rooms for beds, bathrooms, kitchen, or bar ) is quite diminished. Shame, as appliances and equipment for this kind of building and decorating exists.
---
Test damage numbers for yourself with a couple friends in pvp real quick. Do a test with the card on and off before and after joining the team. 
---
I haven't checked it since the patch but need to later today.
---
Fuck no.
---
That's 1013 standard Australian working days (7.5hrs). I'd rather get a degree or something.
---
I'm fine with that if it means I can binge play on the weekends. Some of us with jobs can't get on for x hours every single day. I used to love spending a whole day playing fallout, now after a couple hours might as well do anything else. Good call giving us reasons to log off.
---
It’s time consuming and has everything to do with space. I wasn’t able to just grind for steel because I have no room in my stash. 
---
It’s not challenging just very long.
---
Now you guys know how the pvp community feels...
---
If you want to understand their reasoning, look up 'Timesinks'. 
---
This is an obvious time sink.
---
Probably not with the floaters.
---
They won't even get a quarter of this dollar tho. Done everything right!
---
Yeah, I had to delete and redownload the game for both of the last updates
---
I have 8 different Gatling laser types. Not one is the same and this bug happens to me every day that it is now apart of the game!
---
I was thinking nobody should have to pay for it because we ALL PAID TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE GAME. (Except game pass users...I guess they get it free). 
---
But like seriously I paid $60 and was told they can’t increase the stash limit at all due to server constraints. But then they charge $100/year to increase the budget infinitely for scrap????
---
Only works on secret service power armor. No legendaries.
---
Can someone demonstrate it ? Like take a pic. I'm having a hard time visualizing the problem.
---
No.
---
Why do people still support bad practices?
---
I completely agree. Wastelanders was SO GOOD, and the two updates since then have been absolute failures. It's just grind after grind after grind with no real content. The SCORE system is whatever, at least it gives me ideas for what to do in the game when I'm bored and about to shut it off, but that's it. I never sign on just to grind through SCORE. 
---
Even the promises of this update bored me before it came out. A Colossal Problem is.. fine. Once or twice. If you're decent at the game (I am not). 
---
Wastelanders, and IMO even the main story, was really great because there was so much good story telling going on. All I do in the game now is try to find side quest lines to have some story to play through, and there's not many.
---
Like, this BOS thing immediately sounded like a lame half-assed new thing when they announced it. Oh boy, another grind. Couldn't even mask the grind with some fetch quests and a short story? Come on. All we get it one conversation with a boring NPC. 
---
It's so backwards because, yeah it's obvious that they want people to spend money on Atoms and FO1st, and that's fine. Make your money. I get it. But you're giving NO incentive to actually do it. This update and the last were just flat and boring. Nothing is keeping me coming back now because it's all grind. 
---
It's really a slap in the face to everyone who bought this game and stuck through with it. I got it when Wastelanders came out and really liked it, but now I'm done with the main quests and there's nothing worth doing. The joy of other Fallout games is the literal hundreds of hours of side questing and random discovery there is. I logged like 800 hours on Fallout 4 on one character. I haven even hit 80 hours on this game (and I have a lot of free time)
---
I really don't think Bethesda has any interest in making this game actually good. I'm not expecting Fractured Steel to be anything good, and I'm not expecting the lead up to it to be good either. Sucks a lot
---
I figured some minor cosmetics or some plans. The assorted BOS paint schemes, the assorted BOS uniforms, plus a few new ones. Nothing *major*, just something thematic.
---
.
---
Not the Mole Miner Pails minus the unique stuff.
---
As for Wes Tek? I've never made it through there alive. It's far, FAR too hard for me, sadly. A thousand steel is about a half dozen runs through Uranium Fever for me, but also a whole lot of adjusting with the 800 pound limit. That stash box is *beyond* full (seriously, yesterday it was briefly at 806 pounds. Not sure how that happened exactly) and juggling weight is one of my major daily issues. 
---
A thousand steel is an investment of several hours work, but after this one? Not planning on doing it again. That said, I'll be selling my daily steel allotment at the vending machines, so if anybody *else* wants to go through it, it's about 1 cap per steel (bulked steel I sale for 30 caps, you see) … happy to pass it on to people more invested. Be adding the concrete and cork I gathered as well.
---
Lol I assume so
---
That's awesome, but: https://map76.com/
---
I love the valentines bed in august part that just shows that they really are scraping the bottom of the barrel here
---
Allright, then it is 100% I wont change my power reactor skin when the comminust one comes out. I only have 2 wires but they are going through walls.
---
They’re talking about the enclave event not one wasteland
---
That’s a much better reward, still steep though, it’s like ten hours per atom. They should really make it 2776 atoms to show their appreciation.
---
It was not added
---
Ok...so? We’ve all placed down a wooden - hey wait a minute that’s **in real life???**
---
That looks incredible! Well done!
---
Man, your words are amazing, made me rethink the whole thing. I guess the bigger picture is always better.
---
This won't change anything.
---
We have to realise that they don't care if they make money out of this game, its sole purpose is to check out how much shit we're up to swallow and how expensive they can sell broken and lazy created stuff.
---
The whole game is just a benchmark for their upcoming prestige projects. Fallout 76 was never something they want to be well done or have a minimum level of quality. From planing to development till today.
---
No. Because strange in numbers is activated by joining a public team
---
Saying it's better now is like bragging about dating the hottest waitress at Dennys. Not all that meaningful.
---
Okay so the horrible frame rate all of a sudden isn't just me. That's... good? I cant even go wandering the wasteland at a smooth frame rate anymore and I'm on console so there's really no excuse
---
Look at today's front page here. We're blowing gaskets here.
---
Aye
---
Gatling plasma is an older weapon, and it does not have a skin either.
---
Boycotting first and other things has been asked before.
---
Many people un-subscribed from first. It didn’t do anything.
---
That is one person I wouldn’t want to cross in the wasteland lol, so awesome.
---
Boycotting is a bad practice? Lulwut
---
You are correct, those mods were not added.
---
I've done 3000 hours &amp; I agree with you. I doubt it will be around long enough
---
And you can freetravel to your teammates locations aswell...
---
Oh really, are you saying if you spend more money they make the game better for you? That makes sense for a freemium game like FO76....
---
Damn already, whose next?
---
She can’t be crippled despite the fact that they’ve recognized it as a bug a while ago
---
In this day and age i will agree with you
---
It's worse for those of us that didn't have large stockpiles of ammo and were instead converting smaller quantities of all types. 
---
I was feeding my handmade with it every few days with the assortment of trash ammo I collected but the totals are all over the map.
---
I've got 84 .38
---
123 shotgun shells
---
300+ 10mm
---
5 flares
---
3 missiles etc
---
Before, I could just spam it once I got to the ammo type screen. Just spam 'X' nonstop until the counter stopped moving and then move to the next ammo type, rinse and repeat. 
---
Took about 2 minutes to clear my stash of trash and then produce my desired 5.56 the same way, get to it and then spam 'X' until I ran out of points. 
---
Took all of 5 min total the old way.
---
Now I can't spam anymore. I don't have large enough totals to use anything other than the smallest amount so I'm vastly slowed by the 'improvement'.
---
Sure, if I had bulk quantities the ability to sell higher counts is nice. I unloaded 500+ 5mm rounds easy enough. 
---
It's dumping the small quantities that is now overly tedious and frustrating.
---
I have 2 words to say to people like you: Fuck. Off.
---
People have a right to be mad, I get that. Just don't go trying to start a riot. There are people that are perfectly content with some of the changes made.
---
You basically do dumb shit over and over
---
Budget
---
You're just salty your "president" turned on you lel.
---
Noooo I’ll trade you my nudes for it don’t go for is dumb fixer.
---
Was like that before update too.
---
Exactly theres so much wrong with the game and they dedicate time to patch minor things nobody cares about. Yet events still are auto completing after a year and this is the backbone of the seasons, cheaters continue to go unchecked, real issues just go ignored.
---
 There is 0 quality control on this game absolutely none with events and paid atom shop items. How people are not getting fired is even more astonishing. Almost every single event has launched broken in some way and thats not an exaggeration.
---
And while we are at it please add support for wallpapers for powered doors
---
Every time a new patch lands I'm afraid what they broke or "fixed" this time. I almost hope no patches would even come because it's the same shitshow every time. 
---
Just when you're starting to accept that OK the ammo converter is bad but it's there or something like that, a new patch drops and they screw you in the arse again.
---
That's why all the coffee in 76 comes canned
---
I’m so glad I was able to buy this today along with the nuka jump suit set. I contract them so often that I don’t even care about diseases anymore unless it’s parasites, I just let them run their course.
---
I have over 1600 hours in this game with 5 characters from 510 to 105 lvl, this game is getting worst day by day,timegating,more currencies,patches that break the game more than fixing it,hotfixes that no one asked for,items that get in to the game untested,etc etc. The level of incompetence is unreal, i feel lucky that im on vacation right now,i dont think i could handle this, btw, did they fix the adrenaline card?.
---
Overwatch? They have a public test server and even announce the changes for it in the patch notes and everything. They encourage users to get on there and test. Now I have my own personal issues with overwatch and their decisions but they do the PTS right.
---
I’m just waiting for the day they implement One Appalachia and everyone gets their account reset to level one or the Wasteland is populated with level 1,000,000 enemies or something even worse. They need to accept that they need to put in the effort to fix this engine rather than cobble it together as it goes. That there will be no more free ride. That we deserve the AAA game we paid for. Bring on the Fallout.
---
Thanks man that's something I'd never find out the normal way. RIP casual not reddit player
---
They fixed the glitch so they could sell you double-sided interior walls for 600 atoms... each
---
Methesda!
---
Just tested on PC, and it isn't working for me. At first I thought maybe it had to be brick walls in particular, but I recreated the video exactly and it still didn't work. Hopefully we can figure out how you were able to do it.
---
The system in general is pretty sad, and the fact that it is allowed for such broken builds to exist in the first place is even sadder. Oh, but wait, let's fix double walls am I right?
---
Did they really fix the double wall?...well at least I got my camp just the way I like it.
---
At least you got a half-baked shitty PVP wanna-be Fortnite
---
grats bro now go drop it all in the wss blue suitcase, itll go further that way
---
Well yes
---
I read this like, how I the outfit fallout 76 got mister fuzzy in haha
---
I'm at work, so please excuse me that I can't test this now:
---
Is it still possible to double side place doorway walls, change them to normal walls and put on a wallpaper? I only know this method for double sided wallpaper, I hear the first time that brickwalls were capable to do it with just a single wall.
---
Same problem just happened
---
Actually you probably aren't that far from the truth.  Rather than trickle it away though, they use it as a loss for tax purposes like the big boys do (I'm looking at you GE and DuPont, etc...).  DuPont spun off Chemours to take the fiscal and PR heat when all of the C8 contamination hit the fan in the form of lawsuits, GE spins off divisions into wholly-owned subsidiaries all of the time to keep their net corporate tax rate low.
---
Why now though? Why not like 3 months ago or a year ago? Cheaters were running wild and still are and nobody gave a shit, now cause camps are ruined we riot??
---
Hopefully someday we get an Enclave update.
---
If they made sure it worked right, it would be pushed back two patches.
---
Everybody got the drop bag
---
No that was patched aswel
---
At this point, canceling on principle is like ministering to an 80s executive snorting cocaine out of a hooker’s ass crack.
---
Yea its odd, it doesn't work for bulking either but that one seems intentional since super duper never triggers
---
The 76 division should be moved to the unemployment line. God help us if they are given control of another game.
---
So I can’t glitch my walls anymore, but my Gauss Shotgun still glitches so I have to put it away when I run. Good job Bethesda. Way to prioritize.
---
if you have a companion store or delete them. this will remove the trader . then replace your companion.
---
Maxing the animal friend card just gives you a higher chance of taming the animal, you could potentially do it with rank one but using rank three won’t hurt
---
Haha I appreciate it man! Thanks heaps :)
---
Most of the stuff they know will piss people off and done for no logical reason is silent
---
Those cosmetics and plans are rare for a reason, they come from very specific thematic quests and handing them out like candy for the next few weeks would make them essentially worthless.
---
You don't want thematic rewards, you want instant gratification because there ALREADY are BRAND NEW thematic rewards with the BoS flag stand thing and the BoS collectron and the BoS beret and fatigues... but you actually have to wait for that shit instead of having it handed to you after turning in three shipments of steel and then fucking off to let someone else do the rest of the work.
---
Look, I may not support Bethesda’s choices, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t either. If you enjoy Fallout 76 and fallout first, you go for it and don’t let anyone tell you to stop.
---
Damn. That's objectively not fun. Just a brutal chore.
---
Wow. There was such a site.
---
I think that the direction of this program is different because the starting point is to port Mappalachia to the Web, which takes time to display.
---
Even so, did the location coordinates be extracted directly from the game?
---
Just a heads up, I went ingame and tested and I'm still able to place iron posts into the ground using the blueprint trick (stack 2 together on a foundation, save both to a blueprint, it'll let you place the blueprint anywhere without being snapped). [Example 1](https://i.imgur.com/DKfLzWb.jpg), [example 2](https://i.imgur.com/r6d0Uj0.jpg). Maybe you're trying to place them inside rocks, like I mentioned in my other reply? That wasn't possible even before patch 20.
---
Let's hope there's new free stuff every week, and hopefully there's good things for players that don't have fo1st as well. This time it was the Valentines bed and a rug in any case.
---
That's cause
---
40 steel 10 lead and 12 gunpowder you get 180 .50 ammo
---
If you're making .308 ammo you'd get maybe 24-36 bullets for that (I dunno the recipe for .308 as I don't ever use it)
---
I agree.   I really don't care about the beret; I know all the plans except the T armor ones and don't care about getting those.  (If I had, I would've bought them already.)   I think I'm keeping my steel for ammo.
---
And this while the quest are broken again in 2 hours after patch I had more bugged quests than in the month prior to it, so it kind of shows how they work.
---
when camp building is endgame and camp building gets nerfed
---
Nah, you got to much use out of your wallpapers. Use them on BOTH sides of a wall? FIX ITT. Wont buy atoms for new outside wall designs like the contemporary house if you can wallpaper outside walls!
---
Them not including the rare plans like the croc bookbag killed any interest I had in joining.
---
Whats really bizarre is anyone still plays with that dead rat. Fucking bury it, it was sick and now its dead. They keep messing with the thing making a monster
---
Im sorry  , not gonna happen there is too much people defending Bugtesdas every move even how much they fuck up and break and so on 
---
I have even been banned from this forum multiple times when trying something
---
Got to start somewhere dude. It doesn't have to be everyone that does it. Just enough for them to notice/care.
---
That's only if you care about the issue. I'm sure a bunch of people don't and are fine with things as they are.
---
I feel you. Ive done the same today. Unsubbed. I'm not going to stop playing as like you, I'm addicted to that "secret sauce" and still have fun playing everyday. But I'm done giving Bethesda any more money and being disappointed in the return. Maybe that will prevent me taking stuff like this to heart in the future.
---
The damn building community is what's keeping the lights on right now for the game, yet it's amazing how they constantly take us for granted. They are quite a bit out of touch with the community, and I can't wrap my head around changes like the double walls, meanwhile there's a ton of other serious bugs that require attention.
---
Please no.
---
I hate it when someone locks a room of his camp, I always have to glitch my way in to see what beautiful things they build. Since there is literally nothing someone can either steal, destroy or screw up except turning off lights or switches there is absolute no reason to lock doors at all.
---
Sure, a laser grid door would help to build themed bases, but sadly most people will only uses them to lock others out of their camp with no reasons at all.
---
Also there are some derps who lock their vendors, workbenches, chests or other utility things in a room to prevent others to use it... why?
---
(whispers) I was looking at other games yesterday.   Wondering:  Call of Duty, No Man's Sky......
---
Okay awesome, thanks for the knowledge
---
Here’s how I think it should be:
---
Title card -&gt; Vault 51 lobby. 
---
In the vault you can equip perk cards and explore.
---
Inside the vault 51 lobby there are elevators. The elevators have a specific map corresponding to them. Stand on them and join a server. The server counts down then everyone deploys. Play game.
---
When you die - you go back to vault 51 right in front of the elevator you took or something and can just immediately start queue for another server
---
I'm not sure.
---
It's been posted plenty of times in the past and I'm sure we'll see more in future. It's not exactly a new idea but people seem to think that complaining is enough.
---
It's a start but from my experience, I've only ever seen Bethesda be responsive to loss of money. Anything less - loss of reputation, unhappy players, etc. doesn't matter in the slightest so long as the money keeps coming in.
---
You wonder if people from head office ( wherever that is ) get on the phone to Austin and say WTF are you people doing?
---
The camo under armor is still bugged.  Let’s you try to install shielded mod, eats your flux, and fucks you up
---
That’s great. I’m glad you are satisfied with being deceived and exploited. I am fully aware that this game is a right sight better than it was at launch. I’ve been here the whole time. I wish better for you and all of us. But I cannot make you accept better. I’m sorry that you won’t seek it.
---
No but orbital strike beacons can 😉
---
Yeah, they definitely pulled that bed out of their asses.
---
Exactly why. This game is shit now and the company is shit now too.
---
Yeah it’s 24 with ammosmith,superduper helps but it’s pointless trying to use ammo points for .308
---
That event can make me feel a little sick when I play it now.  Someone mentioned that it might be lagging..... is there a difference between lagging and frame rate?   My apologies for the ignorance but asking to learn.
---
Ballistic weapons fire a blue laser should be intended?
---
It's like shooting yourself in the foot. I'm certain that the building community is what's keeping the lights on over at the devs HQ (so to speak..) yet the amount of times they've disregarded us with changes like this, broken atom shop items etc. is just too many. A sad day.
---
I think the new quest broke all "instanced locations". Hysterical.
---
The same reason chefs taste their food before serving it. You've got to test this shit yourself.
---
I guess it's drivers only, but I am by no means an expert for the plethora of .ini options so it might be somewhere. Seems to happen under certain conditions only anyway (good gpu, not much to render like indoors) and limiting the max fps via control panel was only a few clicks so I did no further 'research'.
---
From another post you can bulk items and then scrap the bulked items for the challenge.   All you lose is a few pieces of plastic.  Easy peasy...   Also, you just need to complete 4x of them. 
---
I did this with Steel, Oil, Concrete, and Wood.  Wood didn't work (see below) so I used Aluminum for the last one.
---
FYI:  Bulking (then scrapping) or gathering wood from logs do not work for the Wood challenge.  I'm guessing that only scrapping objects for wood counts (i.e. picture frames, wood skis, shotguns, etc.)
---
Yeah, same here.   I'll probably make one donation to check it out, but that's it.
---
No.  8K?     
---
Man, I feel for you.
---
Power armor is underpowered\*
---
The camo ss underarmor is broken? I was thinking of buying it.
---
man, everytime i click on this sub, it's just complaints. rightfully so, this game has gone down the shitter.
---
It's a bug they are looking into
---
I started to ask, "How's it on me?"  But then I read the second paragraph.   Okay.  I see your point.
---
Give me your big fat cork hahaha
---
Believe me when I say that I want to be pissed, okay I do. And if this year had been as bad as it was I would. However, given this year has been horrible, I'm trying to stay positive. If that means I have to look like I'm shilling for Bethesda, fine. As long as I stay calm.
---
GOOD MAYBE IF WE YELL LOUD ENOUGH, TODD AND HIS CRONIES WILL STOP SNORTING COCAINE OUT OF A HOOKER’S ASS LONG ENOUGH TO SEE THE DESTRUCTION THEIR HABIT HAS BEFALLEN THEIR FAMILY.
---
The double wall issue is one thing, but not even being able to replace a type of wall is ridiculous (solid versus one with doors/windows).   That means the camp layout becomes pretty darned static.   Geez, glad I changed out some windowed-walls the day before yesterday.
---
I agree that such things were due much sooner. This is just me refusing to give up the fight. This is me, as a serial lurker of all things on the internet, finally coming forward to say we deserve better.
---
😂👏
---
I'm not donating my precious steel to this game for shitty xmas reskins, sorry. After this legendary run crap I think I'm taking a looking break from the wasteland.
---
Lmao. Just the terrible frame rate alone is enough to boycott. They choose to fix things people like, not fix things that we constantly point out that are bugged. So I also have two words for people like you: Fuck. Off.
---
You won't buy new outside icon styles like contemporary house bundle if you get to wallpaper both sides your walls, think about it like this. Will you buy x? Nope? They don't care. Why do you think the atom shop gets weekly updates while we beg for simple fixes.
---
Ah so it works for the T-65 interesting. But I guess they don’t want you to have too many good bullion weapons even though you can sell/trade/drop them.
---
I thought they made that a thing. But there is a bug where she never lands. I was at one before patch 21 and it landed twice and we got it to half health in 5 minutes it then never landed untill the last 2 minutes it flew around for 23 minutes
---
At least you didn’t get the disappointment of a kid on Christmas getting COVID infected used socks instead of &lt;insert toy here&gt;
---
I'm not only boycotting this mission I'm taking workshops and posting signs like... with pretty extravagant builds. Take pics and post them to the forums. 
---
"BETHESDA SUCKS: FREE THE BUILDERS"
---
"LET US REBUILD APPALACHIA!!"
---
"BETHESDA SMH. REMOVE THE BUILDING RESTRICTIONS"
---
What’s the new reward?
---
What will that achieve? Bethesda won’t care and anyone over 20 with a hazmat suit can just walk in. The only people it will effect is the new players who want to get the supplies (if any), new players everyone was so adamant to help.
---
Don't get me wrong, it would be convenient of course, but if you have 1st you can always put down your tent a few steps outside to access your scrap box.
---
Yep, sorry dude but you have been duped. Tech data only works if you find it and then only one at a time. You can sell them back to Vendors for 1 cap each. Hope you didn't spend much more than that on them.
---
Ur keycard, ur nuke. If they don’t know to check the map when the nuke warning goes off...
---
Something's going to go wrong
---
I can’t tell, but I’m still getting ~2000 on bloodied gauss shotgun after destroying dozens of enemies in Tent in the Sand
---
Theres like 2 white/orange jumpsuits called knight and soldier (i think) and a black one called officer. Then theres the fatigues.
---
You have to find them in the wild, an dcna only turn them in 1 or 2 at once. The ones that are stacked don't work.
---
Well crap
---
As long as it’s not a queen nuke that missed fissure sure prime, it shouldn’t be a big deal for anyone.
---
No, supporting fallout76 only encouraging companies to release and continuously produce bad product because people like most of you are paying pre-order prices. 
---
Just stop play shitty products. You are literally destroying it for yourself and everyone around. Just take a look with lootboxes and the whole mobile gaming.
---
Its an option that is no longer available. It wasnt a glitch the floating doorway is the glitch that appears to still exist. So things just got broken not fixed is his point.
---
Maybe, just maybe, all those « building tricks » were spamming the world servers with collision errors? Maybe that’s why they fixed it? Still if that’s the case Beth, you must create new camp items to achieve the same results as our tricks.
---
Why not make it 7600 atoms? It would make sense. I mean, that's like 3-4 bundles and a few paint jobs lol
---
That's why i'l stopped caring for the xp repeatable. I'm at 85 and don't want to give up the only thing for which I start the game.  Atoms where are a much better option to me,even with those tough challenges everyone hated.
---
I know what happened to the rare plans that they promised wasn't expecting the croc back pack, but at least calibrated shocks or you know T60  plans. Was hoping this would reignited my burnt out brain but it's just killed my motivation even more.
---
Daisycutter is a legit weapon.
---
760 atoms, it’s not much but it’s better than 20
---
Many things one recently was the fast travel bug. They refuse to add ways to counter it and continuously say they can't fix it.
---
I liked farming the ghouls.   :(      Very disappointing.   Why on earth would they do this?
---
Boycotting the BoS stuff will give them the wrong impression. You know how out of touch beth is, next thing they will cancel the BoS update. Rather cancel your 1st subs, stop buying atoms, send this as a bug report, make a post about how this update was a mistake. I would really like a BoS update and a Enclave update and so on. If the rewards for Atlas is pathetic voice your complaint over that, don't combine, confuse the issues. That will just confuse beth and next thing you know they focus on junk and forget about this screwup of a "bug fix'.
---
95% chance to hit in VATS, only hits 2 or 3 times and then takes you out of VATS even though your VATS meter is almost full. WTB fix for this forever.
---
When you leave a server the perk cards, gear effects  and every other buff gets removed, to prevent stacking them on next login when the system applies them. Also, when you join a server, at the very first moment you can hear the same as when you log out, till all the buffs got applied.
---
Unfortunately all the things you said you did against the BoS, never happened yet, since 76 is the earliest time frame in the series.
---
In fact, I bet they were coming in peace and were friendly and all that, but you being all hostile and thwarting their plans, made them become the force we all know from the future.
---
Thanks a lot. ;)
---
Yep, they sure did... And thank god I have mine the way I want it too.
---
I’m sure it’s naive and hopeless.. But this is just a serial lurker’s attempt to finally stand up and hopefully rally others to the cause.
---
I want to enjoy it but it's hard with everything starting to feel the same and new content being shit (ATLAS) or delayed on the fucking release day. I was fucking hype and with no delays and not hearing any major issues from pts I was looking forward to it today.  To the point I was ready to grind it out after my basement stopped flooding. But no they wait until today to delay it and I am so done with their shit on top of all the bugs they refuse to fix (like the sbq cripple being fixed by changing one variable according to data miners). I'm not a negative person I was looking forward to seasons and while I would definitely change some things as a whole it made the game better to me. I just want to enjoy the game but it gets harder with out new FUN content. Wastelanders was an amazing addition and I'm looking forward to the BOS fractured steel or whatever but just because I liked some things in the past and and optimistic about the future I will not pretend I'm happy with update 21
---
And more then half the time, I miss the lego because people definitely do not hold off killing that thing.....  no waving over, etc.    So now I should do it because....?   The T notes?  Of which I have way more than I will ever be able to cash in due to the 20/day limit?
---
He wants you to leave the wasteland. Try to walk out of bounds to any other wasteland.
---
Nope. We are currently donating junk so they have a nice stockpile when they return I guess
---
Cant say you are wrong...did not not effect my since im a lazy builder but im pretty sure there is bigger issues to fix
---
lol. Definitely better but not worth grinding 7600 hours of my life away
---
Omg someone called me a Karen on my post earlier about being disappointed on another delay on the colossal problem event, I don’t know what is going through people’s heads tbh 🙄 just ignore it, whole heartedly agree with everything you’ve said
---
Yeah but the games only been out 2 years soon ...maybe in next patch lmao
---
Yeah its kind of lame. In the meantime i use brick walls for my interior. Looks decent.
---
That actually sounds like a good idea
---
Yeah?! How about the bed? I swear to god if its just a valentines day bed that we got..........
---
Did non fallout 1st players get the bed also???
---
No man's sky is awesome and they update properly
---
The fatigues?  Or the SS armor?  I knew the SS armor was bugged before the last patch, but this one is new.
---
Fo1 were the only ones to get the bed. But everybody got the bag
---
It might sounds like a good idea, but I have feeling that all this shit only happening to the game, because the devs are actually not in charge of making the game. These decisions probably come from an incompetent executive who knows how to run a company, but doesn't have the slightest clue about games, gamers and game development.
---
exactly, but what happened, is the grey/white fatigues that used to be just another outfit now an underarmor? or are all the jumpsuits now outfits? I am confused.
---
I got the bundle too, the lamp work, not very bright but will work better in a dark place obviously, which i refuse to make a cave of a camp to see the lamp so that's on me i guess 😂 what i would like to had included in the bundle is the nuka stash box, i hope they put it on sale again, but you are right, if you put nuka colas in the machine it would be nice to have them on sight, in those 4 spaces. I hope they do it someday
---
I saw a tweet earlier where a young woman said the best thing they did (wasnt sarcastic) was Bethesda saying it fixed scraping your junk items on display. That is how low the player base has set the bar. Yes the events like instant failed when it just started or the ridiculous rng of awards so rare you would see Sasquatch riding Nessie before you got what you wanted. Then the playlist of Events to unlock the what third or fourth currency in this game? Treasury notes  they constantly bombard you with Radiation Rumble and the failed Dungeon crawl Project paradise where the animal you are sworn to protect must of had his wife leave him and took the kids because hes suicidal and just wants to die. I have a question Why cant they just leave every item on the Atomic shop there (not returning to the vault) like they are Disney.
---
That’s what has finally brought me to posting about all of it, seeing that it’s fresh in the forefront. It’s given me the courage to attempt to bring us all together, for all the different things we like about this game. To try and help us fight for the Fallout we ought to have, rather than shilling out the corporate masters we are subject to. A naive hope maybe, but hope nonetheless.
---
I'm finding the grind painful and boring and I'm relatively new so god knows how you old timers cope 😂😂
---
Just like they "fixed" the Feed The People event. 👍
---
No need to log in till they unfix it. I was about to start a new camp but not if i cant rebuild what i have now.
---
Charisma and trading bonuses don't affect gold transfers, why would they affect this hypothetical?  They also don't affect scrip, or the possum badges.
---
Yes it'd be another GD currency in the game, but at least this is one that people would friggin want
---
lol yeah. I honestly couldn't care more for campo building on this game. I loved it but is just shite. nothing like Ark or other crafting survival games for example
---
Well here is what bethesda can do with this months fo1 subscription
---
Step 1. Firmly roll it up into a nice compressed package 
---
Step 2. Bend over and fully insert into rectum
---
Idk, thats what i was trying to find out. Im not on rn.
---
First, Happy Cake Day!
---
Second, yes, it has become a chore. It never felt like one when I was just playing whoever I felt like playing whenever I felt the urge. I would just group up with myself and play on a private server all day long.
---
But because of the no - drop / character bound legendaries, the gold grind for the new items, and the legendary SCORE grind, it has really changed my playstyle and urge to keep at it. I keep telling myself that once I have everything on each character (long eventually), it'll be fine. But I know they'll just keep adding new shit like this.
---
It was my hope that the community would create a huge backlash against character bound items. I'd almost be okay with account bound, but even that I feel like further weakens an already damaged marketplace.
---
I mean, very few people buy armor in vendors since the release of Secret Service gear. Now that Deep Pockets is finally coming out (again, *eventually*), there will be even less of a need for armor drops.
---
Anyway, yes, TLDR: It's become a pain in the dick.
---
The fatigues
---
I don't pay full price for anything. It always comes back around a month or two later at 40-50 percent off. Saves a lot of Atoms.
---
Yeah I agree. I mean look what happened when the dupe came along. They banned a ton of people, then all of those people cancelled their FO1st. It almost looks like this could have been a hit to their revenue cause a few weeks later, most of them were unbanned keeping their duped items. To me it seems like it was a revenue hit for them cause tons of people cancelled. Or well, this is all in my opinion haha.
---
I was looking at other games to play last night, and when I saw one that looked interesting but it was made by Bethesda.....   hard pass.
---
I've heard it said, they're going for cash grab while they can, instead of putting in the time to make a cash cow.
---
Partly because it has such a bad rap that the ROI would be wasted, and partly because they can just wash their hands of the game and move on once the studio has an actual release that they're working on (Starfield, ES6)
---
Players would be mad though that others have the chance to earn atoms when they can’t. Players who bought their ranks or did the xp glitches would be getting atoms while players who can’t play much are still doing the run. Not to mention that a lot of ppl don’t even care for the legendary run and aren’t even trying to do it. I finished the run a couple of days ago and getting atoms again would be cool but I understand why they can’t.
---
Any ideas on what you might play next?
---
The sarcasm is just dripping from this post....  though, it's probably how they view it.  
---
The rest of us just shake our heads and wonder why they feel the need to act like 2 year olds in public.
---
But im so shiny and red
---
I guarantee it will be an atom shop bundle if they do...
---
I couldn’t agree more! If you have a problem with the game, stop paying for it! 
---
One common step in boycotting is announcing to everyone on reddit that you’re boycotting and I just wanted to let you know that you don’t need to tell everyone you’re boycotting to boycott. Sometimes it’s okay just doing something, without broadcasting it online.
---
I could do a better job and I’ve never worked with the Creation Engine before.
---
IS it possible to learn this skill?
---
Well yes it's annoying if you want the loot but it was incredible
---
At this point the entire game is a joke... I log on to do the dailies and then hop off when I normally would play for 8+ hrs a day. I'm guessing that's why the servers were down for 4hrs, they had to make sure they fucked everything up perfectly before resetting the servers.
---
Side thought though... Isn't some of Bethesdas team on this sub? I say tag them nonstop in every post so they don't have a choice but to listen 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
I had a grey/white BoS underarmor before the patch. (Can't give you the exact english name since my game is in french) +2 END and STR. Now, it is showing and acting as an outfit and it can't be modded at all.
---
Any info on star field?
---
You don't need Fo1 to play it as a single player. You won't see to many other players, and those that you do see will either leave you alone or give you gear. I think the game is better with others around, and the best thing about Fo1 is the scrap box. That you don't really need at all, and definitely don't need starting out
---
Just picked it up today with high expectations but this has kinda killed it for me. If it isn’t fixed soon I’ll just refund I guess ☹️
---
Agreed. Bethesda/idiots.
---
I turned in one bundle of steel. 
---
Dropped the entire "reward" of booze and 3 stimpacks.  I'll not be giving anything else to the, so called, event.
---
I did do a bunch of Enclave events today though, so that was a good time. Better rewards as well.
---
There is a bug/glitch to transfer mag capacity from one weapon to another.
---
Take a handmade and a minigun. Shoot the handmade and instantly swap to the minigun (&lt;- arrow for gamepad). Gonna be really fast, once your handmade shoot while you pull out the minigun, its done (looks like the bullet is fired out of your bellybutton). Now the handmade have 500 rounds in the clip.
---
They patch the shit we benefit from pretty much immediately and either completely ignore or wait a year and a half to fix the bugs that hamper our experience.
---
That does sound like every tonedeaf decision have ever occur in any industry.
---
The Wendigo spawns in the roof of the cave then drops down when you hit a trigger point, if it doesn't then either you're in stealth or need to throw a grenade to trigger it.
---
I mean I dont care if I have 15 nuka cherry's and it displays Nuka wild, 2 Nuka Colas and a Quantum. I also give zero f*cks if someone comes in and takes them. Caps are a dead currency after a certain level. I mean no one wants them for items on here,so I just go around especially with this buy or sell same score point challenge and just waste caps on silly crap just so I'm not stuck at 30k
---
it is a fun game, but at the current moment the main storyline is fucked as a certain mission was 'fixed' but they didn't completly fix the change. BUT there is alot of side quests and other such things to do, minus the main storyline. PLUS there is building (fo4 mechanic if you remember) if that suits your fancy AND the brotherhood of steel is starting to come to the game (if you like BoS). I enjoy the game, though you will get fustrated. It is a bethesda game after all.
---
😂 I had a good laugh, thanks!!
---
Neither I want the Brotherhood back. If goals not met the building shouldn't be done.
---
I'd say it's worth a year of 1st, but that's just me.
---
I have to agree with him, as a veteran. I’ve sunk over 1,000 hours into this game and every word of what this man is saying is right. Lemme fix that downvote...
---
Oh GD it.   You're kidding me.   It was INTENTIONAL?!   Why is nearly every decision they make something that makes the game worse?!
---
i dont know, i love it, have a blast, and am happy to pay my nominal fee for a break from the endless drama in rl. bit over these ridiculously overwrought complaint posts, tbh, would be nice to have a break from the doom scrolling of constant whiny negativity.
---
The game is what it is. Don't like it, that's your prerogative.
---
You're 100% not wrong but also, It would maaaaybe put their minds into more useful fixes? Like "oh noooooo in order to get way more out of C.A.M.P. building we've had to entirely scrap ammo and med supply machines all over!" Like, those are literally worthless assets eating up apparently suuuper scarce resources. Who knows at this point. Maybe the entire game runs because of those, but that is just one of many things that would not be missed if removed. Which would be noticed if the devs engaged in the world/wasteland community they created.
---
Well to be fair \*some\* of the wall glitches that use this exploit do eat into camp budget. Yes you get ther budget back but only by removing all wall bits, including the one that uses the hanging wall trick to get it to work So it no longer works When you tear it down.
---
I suspect that at some point it suddenly dawned on them that some of the people complaining that camp budgets being to small were running into the budget penalty by using this wal trick to hang  wallpaper, thus costing them camp budget. Combine that with there usual refusal to explain why they are doing things, and you get this mess
---
Sure I can explain why it happens. Its bethesdas spaghetti code speciale.
---
There is a lot of side quests and other things to do in the meanwhile, which I intend to do as I have had the game sitting collecting dust (cant get any money back now lol), but it certainly does suck that we can't progress the main storyline.
---
That's why you throw buzzwords in there like "ad-revenue" make those shark pupils dilate.
---
How did they think this was a good idea?
---
man if i was Bethesda i wouldnt respond to the hyperaggressive complaints you guys make either.
---
Tone down the profanity, the anger, the threats (IM GONNA CANCEL, etc.).
---
Better idea-
---
Contact them directly, outline your concerns concisely and politely, and i bet you get a better response.
---
anyway, im ditching this medium, you are a stack of pathetic crybabies. tantrums and feet stamping.
---
GROW UP
---
Expect double sided walls in the atom shop next week
---
Same here buddy.. Honestly I have no idea what they are talking about and I have been playing since day 1. I change locations frequently and each time I build a new base but I still have no idea what double sided wall is....
---
I feel like they seek out the wrong bugs. They care about removing people’s way of trying to recreate interior walls in a normal house than having that stupid ward glitch where you just keep getting free xp scrip and treasury notes 
---
It’s like playing with legos but they take the legos away so you’re left with no creativity
---
Well the PVP community was fucked up real hard in the past, and no matter the outcry the pvp aspect keeps being nerfed and nerfed. Flakes didn't want trap camps and stuff, so deal with it
---
I agree, it’s not worth the grind but for the people who grind the hell out of it, at least they’re working for something a bit more
---
It may be hard to get a solid answer on the very divisive opinion of is it worth it here. I think those who love the game usually hide in the shadows here because much of this sub will downvote or bash those who enjoy pay and play (especially after update 21).
---
But my advice is simple. There are times you go to a movie theater and drop $50 on popcorn soda and tickets to find you loved or hated the movie. It's going to be that way with this game. Be prepared to have your own view and opinion on if it's worth it or not outside of what others say here. There is no solid general consensus on this game. It came into this world with super low ratings but people like me played it. Now on steam it has generally good reviews but many who still destroy it.
---
If it's on sale in steam I say give it a try and worse case scenario is you hate me for losing the $20. Good luck!
---
okay... still a bit confused. to my knowledge the grey/white camo BOS Fatigues has always been an ou... hmm wait. my hvy gunner has a black BOS jumpsuit, over it I have the BOS fatigues as an outfit but now that I think about it I realize the leather armor pieces I got go OVER the fatigues, which it shouldnt be doing if it was an outfit. So, have I been wrong, was it infact under armor all the time? I cant rememeber but my gut feeling says I never put shileded lining on a bos camo outfit... *confusion intensifies*
---
nah, im having a lot of fun and will continue to enjoy it
---
don't expect everyone to follow the circlejerk because you have a tanty. 
---
I am willing to bet that there are 10x as many people just relaxing and having fun with a silly game in their spare time than those who make these ridiculous threats and multi page complaints with big lists of ultimatums in CAPS.
---
It's a game, lads, take it or leave it. Plenty of others out there. Downvote if you want, idc, am going back to play the game, this place is a cesspit of negativity from people with no real life problems to concern them.
---
Ignore the noisy rabble, Bethesda, there are heaps of us silent players who love the game, warts and all.
---
This has been my thought process all along. Thank you for wording way better than I could
---
I wont donate anything. Its a useless event i will let the other suckers get me the rewards. Nothing is good anyway from it.
---
The same way PVP community now can't enjoy a good PVP or camp trash as before. Being fucked by devs
---
I just hope this engine is not based on the ES6 one.
---
Is it just me or is bethesda actively trying to kill this game as fast as possible
---
I, as someone that has never bought into Fallout 1st and only occasionally bought into atoms , almost exclusively (read: begrudgingly) when they are on sale, am advocating for putting our feet down and communicating that we won’t accept such shoddy, greedy, and half-hearted development any longer. I think we are on the same wavelength here, I maybe just needed to clarify more.
---
Can you line it first and then apply the camo?
---
yep- it is empty noise from people who have no real life issues to worry about so they focus their rage here. i get it can feel helpless when you are shouting into the void, so i get their somewhat juvenile, and misplaced, rageposts, but get a grip guys. world won't end.
---
me too, se my other reply above. guess I know for sure tonight when I get a chance to log on.
---
no, you have a legacy camp :)
---
Or the FT bug.   I swear, yesterday, I had to try five times for every jump.
---
And pay us scraps of nothing
---
Hey everyone another player saying they cancelled their subscription 
---
See? nobody cares
---
I don't understand why they keep not giving play testers the patch notes in advance, so that we could actually test the patch in the PTS.
---
This iteration they didn't give us any note at all, apart from a few superficial points about things that are not in this patch. How are we supposed to know what to test is we don't know what has been changed? 
---
u/Valseek, u/Ladydevann,  can you please tell the team it's impossible for us to actually test your patches if we have no idea what changes they make? Really, any new PTS iteration should start with "Update # Patch Notes". And actually give us patch notes after subsequent patches, unlike the last two PTS updates.
---
Like, instead of just telling us to test stuff that's months away, without even detailing it, we should have the whole patch notes, and debug tools, and yes, I mean cheat stuff and the console. It's the PTS, we can't take anything over to the full game so why not give us an easier time instead of having to grind to test your stuff, sacrificing the grind on the live servers? Since you willingly made the live game a daily-gated grind, you should expect that people have less time to waste on progress that's not going to be saved, especially since 99% of that time is going to be useless grind to get to the point in which we are able to test stuff. 
---
There have been tons of posts in the PTS forums about rebooting our characters to keep testing the Legendary Perks after having exhausted all the coins, and all those requests have been completely ignored. Not only that, but you also x5 the grind needed to update the cards, and still didn't give us the fabled lv 250 test character.
---
If we are to successfully test your game, 1. LET US KNOW WHAT HAS BEEN CHANGED; 2. ACTUALLY PUT IN THE PTS THE STUFF THAT NEEDS TESTING (Legendary Run and its items, hell even atom shop items which are routinely broken, Fortify Atlas, or a Nuclear Winter anticheat); 3. GIVE US TOOLS TO ACTUALLY TEST THE GAME MORE THAN JUST ONCE (if we're lucky).
---
You created the problem, you need to give us the solution if you want successful testing. Otherwise this backlash will keep repeating itself, over and over and over again.
---
Name one thing Bethesda have done really well in the last few years.
---
The boot tastes good right?
---
Yeah, but then again, if you, the dev, play the game and notice something that needs to be fixed, and your boss says you have to work on something else, you have to do what your boss says not what you think is the best. That's how things work under incompetent leadership.
---
They probably will but it may take some time.
---
How do you do that? I wanna try it.
---
They say they did, but who knows.
---
Don't forget. They fixed Ward again!
---
The amount of times I’ve had a level 800+ in Excavator power armor try to bully me out of a workshop bragging about how he can put out 1000 damage a hit on the Queen while I was 700+ levels below them was hilarious. My favourite was a dude in that Navy camo paint on his Excavator, level 1,482 who sent me this message: “If you don’t give me the ammo factory I will kill you and take it by force” while I was on my level 52 alt. I sent back “Not a prayer, lol”, so he said “I’m more than 1400 levels above you, I will kick your ass especially sine I do 1200 damage a hit to the Queen” (this character puts out 4-6k damage a hit, and my build wasn’t even finished yet), so I said “come on then big man, try and bully this little dude.” Of course, he tried taking my workshop. I mowed him down with a BFFR lmg. He had over 100 of each bulk junk and hundreds of each flux on him as well, the idiot! Of course, I stole every single last bit of it and tossed it in my scrapbox, because he was being a prick. Should have seen the abuse I got after that XD
---
If used properly the floater grenades are devastating. Throw them at yourself for instance, instant melting.
---
&gt;iots will never get it right.  Just change it back to the way it was originally, and just add a 'convert all'.  At least it only showed options to convert it if you had 
---
we know vendors are a gatewoy to explots/glitches/dupes, so...
---
I love how you're asking for something then immediately insulting them, yeah that's really gonna make them want to listen to you
---
This happens every update. Those affected most by the update come here joining hands on a certain "fix" lashing out calling for a boycott calling devs names etc. It's a cyclical activity here. The only ones who are united are those affected by it.
---
I don't do much building in 76 (I spent 2/3 of my time in 4 building however). This double wall thing I'm hearing about I literally learned about today... And I've been playing since beta.
---
But as time goes on things here will return to a normal pace as it always does after an update and the hate with certain things. 
---
And as always I'm perfectly prepared for the downvotes. This isn't an attack on those affected just an observation of the activities here after 21 updates.
---
Everything in this game is pared down to the bare bones, dumbed down to give players the absolute least they can get away with.
---
&gt; Pokemon moon and sun. Its first couple of community events failed horribly
---
Eh they made the rookie mistake of showing players a counter that was *actually* tied to their efforts. 
---
Made it hard to reverse course without making it obvious they were artificially bumping the totals. 
---
Beth learned that lesson, which is why we're blind to the total donated. ;p
---
fair point. but dont feel hated kind stranger :D if anything i'll hate myself for letting strangers tell me what to do :)
---
have a nice day!
---
That figures.  Too bad it also wasted the flux I used to mod it.  Have they actually acknowledged it's a bug anywhere?  I'd be more annoyed if it was deliberate, due to a reward for the scrap grind I just read about.
---
But from the look of things it only realy fixed the one that were blueprinted not stored, but that should be a faint straightforward fix. Well kind of lol
---
Oh man, remember when everyone ‘quit’ because drills were in the legendary pool? Yeah man that totally showed Bethesda!
---
Well, the 10 interns still working on the game clearly don't, since they focus on fixing CAMP "bugs" nobody asked for and the SQB is still un-crippable, and 3* legendaries still drop useless 1 stars, so...
---
Do you not realize that the BOS isn't asking for supplies? Or are you too ignorant to acknowledge it?
---
I can smack the Queen once, and do 6k damage with an incomplete melee build. Once I’ve done that, I focus on the little things that wind everyone up and otherwise kill them. Eventually I’ll have a 2-3 hit kill Queen killer build. *SMACK* mutate. I hope everyone enjoys their easy kill!
---
Totally! i put it in my camp today, I have a stash box at the end of it, when my girl was sleeping, she had her feet on top of the box lol. The bed is Too short
---
Patched? When the fuck was this a bug?
---

There's my full health pa heavy gunner build. I run vamps most of the time and junkies for big fights 
---

---
There's my bloodied stealth commando build
---
Those are just 2 examples. It's hard to make a build based on just ranged damage. You need a weapon type, full or low health, ect
---
It’s odd. Settlement building actualy became more fun for those whose hardware can handle Sim Settlments.
---
the catch being hardware that can Handel sim settlements
---
They aren't asking for supplies, Russell the try hard wannabe is, they have literally NOTHING to do with him

Holly shit every patch someone makes this post just fucking leave I don't give a fuck about your crying
---
Have this happen once for me on PS4 when logging in after new weekly update (not daily) - only thing I did different was that I looked into the atomics shop and/or the roadmap for the legendary run before starting the game... up to 80% was auto completed when I started playing...
---
Since then I have logged directly into a server adv/private and havent encountered the problem again...
---
I once found him under the entrance bridge where you spawn in. He was in the corner staring at the wall.
---
What was it again?
---
The new camp from seasons is broken. Don't do it!
---
They don’t have to be. But diluted and reskinned Christmas presents are taking the downright piss.
---
The same moment double sided walls are a bug ,
---
If these reputation missions would give more than 0.0000000005mm repution, then I would not care.   
---
It seems that also glitch in raiders retair ;D plan mission also not work. 
---
At least you can still do Ohio River adventures again and again.
---
what?
---
Ummm, on a similar note. Fallout first broke. 
---
Cant invite anyone.
---
It is now a glorified singleplayer mode
---
If you want really good damage then i would suggest unyielding armor and a bloodied weapon but this a late game build so just collect pieces along the way. As for the build itself just do a vague perception build with luck if you wanna just VATS crit everything then you can change around your stats later as long has its not a total change in build it should be fine
---
I agree 100%, I'm done. I might follow up in september to see if anything was added like it's supposed to be. It's been a good run guys. Stay safe out there!
---
We should all drop “your the dumbass” instead of donating as a show of rebellion
---
Your bloodied stealth has many of the perks I already have. I might give that a go.
---
Your health regenerated during combat if you had lifegiver, speed demon and adrenal reaction.
---
Sadly it’s called fallout 4 with mods
---
I wonder if it'll be always in legendary runs as a reward, because if they ever make it simple and efficient like this, it would suck for new players that missed the season. 
---
Or it'll just be a part of some C.A.M.P. bundle 🤔
---
If you think so.  
---
Then again, I ran with a full bloodied crew.  I was the odd one out running full health with a Furious FFR Explosive 50 cal.  We could take down the queen shortly after she first landed.  A couple of crew were sneak Bloodied melee so they hit like a brick once they could get close to her.
---
About 6 months ago one of our crew picked up a legacy bloodied explosive gatling laser.  That thing would eat her health up like candy.  It would also kill you in an instant, outside of power armour, from the splash damage if you were shooting anything even somewhat close to you.
---
There are other methods such as food, chem, Bobblehead, and perk card stacking and there are guides online on how to do this.
---
If you haven't done it before or seen it before it might seem incredible.  But once you've experienced it, it's not all that impressive.  And it's less impressive (and kinda immature) when they do it on a public server with a lot of other players trying to get XP, etc.
---
No, I'm saying that the game forces you to spend more money to make it easier/more comfortable to play. Yet no need to be all passive aggressive about it. Everyone decides for oneself whether they're gonna spend more or not.
---
Why even bother having it be instanced?  Just for the challenge of trying to to get a team to go and sctually do the same thing?
---
Someone posted that the dataminers found a tag that actually keeps her from being able to be crippled.  In other words, it's not a bug.  It's a feature.   It's intentional.  Two inches from saying, "screw SE".
---
Wait. They removed door and window walls?
---
For that build you'll want a full set of unyielding armour, even 1 star will do, though any thing with ap is much better. And a bloodied combat/handmade/fixer. Again 1 star is a good start. Though your end goal will be a bloodied 25 faster fire rate 25 less vats cost (that is like your super end goal for weapon)
---
The health going up and down is called rubber banding. Surprised that’s still in the game now, I remember hearing about it a few months ago.
---
So this "fix" is able to destroy my base?
---
I do have unyielding armor, not a decent bloodied weapon yet though. To be honest I’m unsure how bloodied builds really work. I know you have to keep health low to do more damage but I have no idea how you don’t die every two seconds.
---
I mean who cares about the shit pales. Isn't it about the end goal of free items?
---
This is what the meta is in this game and I keep asking why I still play
---
There is literally one solution at all:
---
Drop the sourcecode from the servers and let the community make their own servers with free modding options. Sure this won't work for consoles, but Holy fuck I'm sick of hackers and hacked items.
---
&gt;Because it's something to complain about, that's all.
---
No. This community does not have any deficiency of things to complain about, it has thousands.
---
It's about "why can not you do something right, even at second try?".
---
Someone at Bethesda had an idea that Ammo Converter should be a consumer product, not industrial, and made that "ammo phone" interface. Everybody cried. And - a rare wonder - Bethesda reacted.
---
...turns out they choose to overhear *anything* except "i want to convert million cartridges" and made new interface that have 10x and 100x increments. And in addition they managed to break even that scarce few of good it had. Now we have "conversion failed"screen when trying to convert 98 bullets.
---
We have to take a paper and pencil and plan conversion before starting - or spend time exiting converter to look in the inventory screen before each conversion attempt.
---
One step forward - three steps back.
---
It's also a little kind of funny, that BOS guy is not actuallly member of Brotherhood of  Steel, but only a guy that heard their scrampled message
---
I'm ripping Bethesda, not you. Chill.
---
they making this game simplest as possible because its easiest way how to earn money. Hell, they even re-skin existing objects to sell them twice or more times.
---
They already missed opportunity to make missions consequence in game with Wastelanders update.
---
Does anyone else want to spike their water supply with vast quantities of nukashine? They need the traditional welcome to Appalachia....
---
To be honest, this game doesnt compare to alot of good games, its worse than fallout 4 and I think fallout 4 is really bad fallout game. Im passed 400 hours and I feel like everyone like us try so hard to enjoy and uplift this game via the community but it just gets harder and harder to try and improve a decreasingly fun game
---
Bethesda have never been very good at patch fixing, they have never been very good at game stability. In the past the quality of game content made this tolerable to the consumer. There’s just not the content/quality in FO76.
---
Right now it feels like a Pavlov’s Dog experiment, how many aesthetic rewards can we offer for you to repeat the same tasks ad Infinitum. 
---
They want FO76 to be an MMO like Fortnite, it’s the business model they desire. They tried to bring their player base with them so offered a minimal quest line &amp; reduced camp building to ease the transition. Therefore they have little appetite to advance or fix these aspects almost 2 years on.
---
Ok. So I have the armor (mix of 2 and 3 star) and a bloodied SMG. Any good?
---
Yet you're saying this to me for some reason. Even though I'm "on your side".
---
They will produce lots of BOS W(h)INE Ad Vinum!
---
A bloodied smg is a good start, though it suffers since you can't put a silencer on it. The silencer makes it much easier to stay in stealth allowing you to stay alive and deal much more damage
---
Creativity comes from constraint
---
yes
---
State of this sub at the moment is pathetic
---
I really don't think they play the game like we do, that much is clear. They must have lab devices that are used to test changes specifically and with wire frame mode but isolated from normal game play, camp building etc.
---
This would explain why their fixes seem disconnected to the game that the player base experience and know. And they avoid forums or just cynically ignore everything discussed from a feeling of superiority.
---
They removed the ability to replace a window wall with a solid wall and vice versa.   Same with doored walls.   I haven't seen it personally, but have seen several others report on it.
---
I hope they know where they can put those.
---
That would be amazing. If that's what fallout first was I would 100% get it. Modded servers would be amazing. I haven't knowingly dealt with hackers but I'm tired of the headless invulnerable enemies that spawn and fuck up vats and make me waste ammo (cause I click shoot on the first thing in vats when I use it 95% of the time) I just want to keep liking the game but patch 21 which was supposed to reinvigorate my love with a colossal problem made me hate it more than I have since getting the game.
---
The actual fuck?
---
Industry exec's have vision based entirely on cash flow, all they see when they watch someone playing 76 is someone sinking pennies into a slot machine.
---
*1400, because Bethesda will break that ceiling too
---
Yeah, it is less laughable than 20 atoms, but still, that dedication should be rewarded with something significant.
---
We're still here, just being ignored by Bethesda and treated like trash by the rest of the community But we're here
---
I think this game requires a reasonably fast and stable internet connection both for the download and playing otherwise is gets all messed up.
---
Shut sown the game completely, this is the only solution.
---
This happens every time you play Nuclear Winter and then start Adventure Mode. It will happen every time you do this, because *Bethesda*.
---
Best time to plant a tree is 10 years ago.  Second best is today, brother.
---
Yeah, it's a small bug you have sometimes. Some people claim it's when you switch from NW to adventure, but it happened to me without going to NW. Try changing servers, should help and if it doesn't just restart the game. This is one of the most minor glitches and easy to fix.
---
Well that's really annoying. Now that I'm talking about it, I remember it happened a few times with the scorchedbeast in the past few days as well.
---
Whoopsie!
---
I'm also ready to bet that said executives are completely unwilling to give this game the manpower it needs. It's no mystery that all 400+ of Beths people are right now working on Starfield, I'd be amazed if more than 15 developers actually worked on 76. They probably see the game as being already dead, so instead of thinking long term and hiring more people to resurrect it, they want to get the most money out of this game with the least expenditure as soon as possible.
---
Honestly I feel bad for the devs, since knowing the absolute medieval state of working laws in the US they're probably underpaid and under threat of being fired if they try to organise any sort of protest. With their involvement on this project, being fired also most likely means being unlikely to find another job in the industry, at least short term. I wouldn't wish this fate on my worst enemy tbh.
---
Bc its asinine to design multiple future content with the framework that some or even half of it may never make it into the game just for community input. Its wasted man hours especially if that choice affects the entirety of the future content that has been planned. Ive seen ppl make posts on here like this, saying stuff like we should be able to boycott the BoS even showing up at all. As if Bethesda had some alternative narrative they spent months working on just in case enough of the players decided this isnt what they wanted to happen. While your suggestion of rewards being dictated by player choice isnt bad this playerbase would not be very reciprocal to the idea of “missing out” on the “other choice” rewards that other players would get and theyre locked out of. They barely handle the rotating atom shop cosmetics without complaining about missing out on something.
---
But back to the idea of having that level of community input on the direction of the entire game’s future content based on events like this just isnt practical from a developers standpoint. Not to say it cant be done, but with this dev group and with the backlogs and delays and reoccurring bugs they already deal with constantly, I just cant see them being able to put content out in timeframes the community would be happy with. I think everyone needs to lower their expectation for community events as being some form of community input into the game and just accept them for what they are, time fillers with stretch goals and minor rewards while we wait for the new planned out story/gameplay content. Leave the community input for future content to the surveys they put out where they get direct input into what players want. The BoS having a bigger presence in the game was something that ppl asked for in those surveys and this is why were getting it.
---
Haven't been able to do that for ages, the terminal just said the collectron is busy. I just deleted the thing and have a bit more build budget.
---
I felt the same and started playing games like Alien Isolation and Outer Worlds, I’m much happier.
---
Fallout is not the same as it was, it’s all marketing and money now.
---
I look to other games and other developers for amazing new content. Not Bethesda.
---
I have a fallout 1st box full of scrap staying right where it is
---
Fk the Brotherhood 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
Like I said, kid.  Chill.
---
Ok food build
---
You could put two interior doors on the same base line, and have them front to front. Then you could change them for walls and apply wallpaper to both backs, giving your camp properly decorated interior.
---
Before this broken update, the BOS fatigues (urban camo military fatigues) were an underarmor.  After today's patch, they are now an outfit that covers armor.  Something was borked.  I had mine modded with shielded lining, and it got stripped of mods, but still weighs 1 pound like an underarmor, not .1 pounds like all outfits, but acts as an outfit.
---
It's super fun if you like fallout. It certainly has its problems, but it always had a story. It's just a constantly evolving one now. It's kind of a bummer you will never experience the dead world we started in. But I can see why people didn't like that.  
---
The only real issue I have had is the inconsistency in everything. Be it damage stats, perk stats, blah blah blah. I just pretend I have good days and bad days. 
---
 You definitely don't need FO1st to play the story to completion. If you do become obsessive, its rather nice. But that's way down the road. 
---
In the end if you enjoyed FO4 it's more similar to that now with NPC's so much so playing on team makes story missions a pain. PVP is a choice so you don't have to get roped into that. I love them all so I'm a bit biased.
---
Yes we should just send thoughts and pairs and hope the fix things.
---
I've seen it recently as well.  Mostly when using my explosive weapons.  I think that what's is likely doing is first applying the full damage and then subtracting the armour modifier.  
---
The thing that I find annoying is that you used to be invincible for a few seconds after fast traveling prior to moving so that if you warped into a horde, you would have a few seconds to understand the situation and respond.  Either this timer has been reduced, taken away, or it's glitched because I notice that enemies respond to you even before the area has been fully loaded in.
---
Like I said, kid. Don't address to me if you're not "ripping me". And don't call everyone who doesn't agree with you a kid, kid.
---
Next month they gonna sell you interior walls in the Atomic Shop.
---
It's a sound bug that appears every time a message pops up in the top left corner of the screen (ex: You harvested 2 corn).  
---
How does this bug trigger? If you go play a Nuclear Winter match and than comeback to Adventure Mode you will get that sound bug. 
---
How do I fix this sound bug? Completely close the game and reopen the game. You will have to do this every time you hop on a Nuclear Winter match and plan to go back to Adventure Mode within the same session and it's the reason why the Nuclear Winter Score challenge is always the last challenge I do for the day.
---
That's the face I always use for males. 
---
Sorry but I don't know a fix.
---
I’m honestly glad to hear this. It’s fine to try to stay calm. That should be the way to go, never losing one’s cool. But don’t accept being taken advantage of. Not ever. Take it from someone who only reads about things and almost never speaks their opinion; don’t ever accept being manipulated or subjugated, regardless of the circumstances. Speak out against what’s wrong. The only thing for evil to win is doing nothing, ad nauseum.
---
Ah crap I was gonna make a pirate ship camp soon too :(
---
Lol why do you guys play this shit game where you have to glitch and game the mechanics to do basic things you want to do?
---
Every tab gives me Flare Ammo only when I redeem points. Love the change but I cant get the ammo I want for it, only Flares.
---
You absolute monster, not including a picture of this magnificent image you've created in my mind!
---
I beg of you, rectify this and give me solace!
---
Aylmao.
---
Also, you just described how PvPers feel doesn't feel good being ignored does it
---
you forgot the /s
---
People are flexing all the time in this game, never emote angry faces or thumb downs, they are like school tyrants, they get hard when they get a reaction. Ignore them, move on or jump server.
---
Exactly. I enjoyed fallout 4, mostly because of the plot, is like a bad girlfriend, you just can't let go. Guess what, I recently installed again RAFT, which is still in Early Access and i have more fun with such a simple crafting game than this FO stuff
---
The Rug was also free for F1st.
---
I have goddamn clue how anything that stops us from building whatever we want is at their expense.  Even if we made floating towers, how is that harming them, or even other players?  Yeah, trap camps that drop people, who really cares?  They're in the vast minority.  Platforms that make killing bugged ass bosses that could've been hotfixed are cool with me too.  Camps are our own individual areas, and we should be able to do whatever we want to them.  And I'm saying this as someone who loves their current camp and has no plans to ever move, nor do I do any of the tricks they keep "patching."   Its just stifling creativity and alienating people, I honestly don't get the reasoning.
---
We always expect too much from Bethesda. And never delivers.
---
So because i'm a part of the building community i can't have been a part of the PVP community? How about we band together against Bethesdas lackluster decisions. Instead of saying "deal with it". Main reason  PVP community got a little sympathy from the majority was because a big part of that community wanted to grief people, not do pvp. And many of that community were childish and rude on the threads that made people not feel sympathetic to them.
---
I have built many camp and being able to have interior walls with wallpaper on both sides turns a lame camp into a nice one. Its bad to remove this feature and not replace it with something official to keep the functionality. I understand it was unintended to allow double sided walls but the game was better for it.
---
This ability needs to be reinstated or better yet give us actual interior wall frames that we can add wallpaper to on both sides.
---
im really not being a dick, but id suggest trying Warframe. tons of content (new major content every approx 6 month), tons of stuff to do, great community (r/warframe, holla!) and you design and decorate your own ship and dojo. it is f2p, but its a largely pve game, so you cant pay 2 win really, but i know people arent so keen on f2p games. i pretty much play Warframe throughout the year, playing games like FO76 when they got something new going on (also a big fan of The Division, so Div2 is in rotation right now as well). i love fallout, hate what they did to my boy (they massacred him!), but i just feel like reminding this subreddit from time to time: there are other games. i payed for fo1st for two months and was like nah. if im going to pay, id rather give up my money for quality product. fo76 aint quite there, not for what theyre asking.
---
yeah
---
I assume you are talking about the two by one "stackable" stairs with the built in floor? 
---
That bug is annoying as hell but this patch didn't cause that, that's been an issue for as long as I can remember. I know a few work arounds I can show you if you are on PC.
---
Yeah, they didn't fix/upgrade the system, just changed values in 5 minutes.
---
Here's my, admittedly non tech savvy, understanding of why things are like this. 
---
They had the code for FO4, it worked well. It was polished and 'most' of the bugs had been ironed out. 
---
Picture this code as a single string, stretched out straight. 
---
Now, they have the idea for 76, and since they are attempting something new they decide to save costs by simply using the code from FO4.
---
However, that straight line of code wasn't going to be 100% compatible with some of the new things they wanted to do.
---
At this point they start folding the string onto itself, adding new sub routines, new lines of code extending off the original string etc.
---
Eventually, they get a code that works as 76. 
---
This code no longer resembles a string stretched straight, now it is a string that has been folded over itself a few times. Like a pretzel. 
---
So they release the pretzel and we players start diving into all the tiny cracks and crevices. In the process we discover bugs they missed.
---
So they go into the pretzel code to fix the bugs. Only now they aren't dealing with a straight string (clean coding) and instead have to carefully lift up pieces of the string to get to the string underneath. 
---
This takes more time and always... ALWAYS ends up disturbing the string in other places. You can never lift part of the pretzel without moving another part.
---
So they do this over and over. Eventually the pretzel starts to lose it's shape.
---
Now our code resembles a ball of wadded up string. It's tied in knots here and there, frayed in a few spots. Strings can't be lifted out of the way anymore so they are just cut with scissors and then repaired with yarn...
---
So they learn about a new bug, one they created the last time they had to dig into the wad of string and inadvertently cut the wrong one.
---
Now they have to painstakingly dissect the ball of string, looking for that specific piece that has the bug. Then they can't just simply remove it because lo and behold, it's at the damn center of the ball. They fight and flex the ball, but realize that fixing the bug would create infinte more in the process... so they just have to let it go and hope we get over it. 
---
This starts to compound. The more it happens, the more it WILL happen. Domino effect is is full swing. 
---
So now they've got this convoluted mess of code that can't be easily deciphered. It take infinite more skill and time to re-code and even when done perfectly... the nature of the string wad dictates that something, somewhere, got screwed up by doing it.
---
I even had a x4 bonus one time that gave the team a zen mastery perk. Resulted in health regeneration 😁
---
I don't agree you Bloodied builds had it too easy as it was and now you actually have to heal yourself properly like the rest of us. You guys want to have all the power with those glass cannon builds? Sure go ahead but you actually have to be a glass cannon as a trade off.
---
I am shocked to see so many upvotes and comments on this post.
---
Why do you guys make yourself suffer by playing the biggest cash grab of last year that sucks all around and continues to get worse? 
---
Please, stop, go play something good or do something better with your time...
---
What's up with the atlas event?
---
Bethesda’s C team are called that because the C means Cunt.
---
That looks disturbing. I'm not sure how it can be fixed but if it was on steam you'd run a game files validation, maybe other platforms have something of a sort. Looks like corruption of game files to me, but I might be wrong.
---
Hang on the double sided wallpaper isn’t the issue. It’s the fact that so many different camp styles can no longer be made. Barns, pirate ships etc.
---
It was kinda cool.
---
I like that this has significantly increased the viability of Vampire's heavy guns, tho. I was getting sick of explaining how I was tanking Assaultron lasers with so little health and that I'm not a hacker, hopefully this'll make them more widely appreciated and put an end to *those* pointless explanations.
---
I would like to have a vendor menu where I can sell unwanted ammo until machine 100k points is sent to my side of vendor screen, and then I should be able to spend those 100k for available ammo of choice. That's it.
---
Outer World's was great, but be forewarned that it's SUPER short. Like beat it in a day short.
---
NOISE!!!!!
---
Because it was used to "exploit" the game. According to them... ¬¬
---
Her not landing is due to how the flying mechanics work.  If she is targeting a player but can't find a suitable landing site (too many tents, they're on the fence/bunker) she won't land and will just do the flyover attack.  Also, if she starts the animation to land, or begins circling to begin that animation, and is staggered from heavy weapon fire (with those one perk) or a headshot, it cancels the landing animation altogether.  
---
Crippling her wings negated both of these and forced her to land and stay down.
---
Hunting the walking cane spiked and the two salves are the only reason I still play
---
I doubt they really care to be honest, I'm surprised you paid for it in the first place. All in all, they've got so much money out of you already compared to previous titles. You buy Skyrim for £40/$60 and that's it with a bit of dlc later down the line. But you've bought the main game, spent money on atoms and bought a year of fallout 1st.
---
They're literally laughing at your $200+ purchase for a single rushed out title.
---
but muh wallssss
---
Happens on r/destiny the game too and overwatch.
---
That should be exactly what happen, can't land because we don't want them here :D
---
Because modders don't work for a company that need to make money. According to my research which is looking up Wikipedia Bethesda has 400 employees. I'm sure most of them are your typical employees doing typical things. How many are working on actual game content? Now take all of the things these devs have to work on (multiple games all of their bugs.new content content that actually makes the company money etc).
---
Of course they have the ability to fix every problem. But they are like any other creative company creating entertainment. Having to balance a ton of moving parts to keep customers share holders and the likes happy. 
---
I work in the props and costume business. I guarantee you've seen my work somewhere. We create some great stuff that isn't cheap at all. But I've seen some private prop and costume designers working out of their shed making some absolute masterpieces which exceeds the limits of my brain. Yet they work a retail job trying to make ends meat. The business of creating something for entertainment is much different than the simple creation itself.
---
not saying Bethesda didnt fuck something up BUT, isnt it a bit logical that the camo fatigues were never supppose to be an underarmor, it should have been an outfit all along and now with the Atlas update they finally got around to fix it but of course fucked up the weight because - hey - the rules are that every fix requires a fuck up. The new Atlas event BOS outfit looks like the fatigues except the color of the pants right, so the old one is like that but slightly different. This is my theory at least, but the weight is messed up now since nothing can ever be completely fixed but rather half-assed.
---
I’m not donating 250 steel for beer and caps
---
Yeah I know all of this but I cant do anything when people put down 3 tents and stand on top, I tried running further away to get her to target me but k couldnt
---
I'm pretty sure I'm gonna backbones this game, again, and go back to ESO.  At least there my monthly money never felt like it was a waste.
---
I actually cannot think of anything worse than allowing u to fly and one shot everything in the game. It’s a game. The world has rules. The servers are always full and active. Why would anyone want to dilute that, certainly on console. On PC I’m sure it already happens with some of the 800 range weapons I’ve seen on here
---
It was most likely for experimenting on the PTS where they were testing community reactions to this trait but it’s been rumored that someone must’ve accidentally pushed this attribute to the live servers.
---
They can’t let players go nuts because of hardware and Game code restrictions.   
---
look up some Of the old restrictions that Sim Settments and others had to put up with and work around to even get things to work with the then current creation engine. Now realize that functionally it’s the same engine, it has code that dates bach to at least Skyrim (and given that many of the buds are identical to ones in Oblivion you ban argue it’s even elder.....)
---
I highly doubt that 250k scorchbeasts were killed for the previous event.
---
You're missing the point. If it's a modded server you pay for operate and run you should be able to do what you'd like. It doesn't mean the general base of gamers are coming in to be one shot. Modded servers are usually operated by a person who controls it's content and access. It's not for me to judge what they do with it but if you give the people the option of modded servers people can have their sandbox.
---
Because then it wouldn't be a time sink, which was the whole purpose for creating it most likely.
---
Can someone explain what everyone is complaining about, like, what has actually happened? I noticed in FO76 that you can build a solid wall, store it, then when you go to use the stored wall you have the option to change it to a door or window wall "for free".  But if they've taken this away, doesn't that mean you just have to scrap the solid wall and spend a few more materials to build the kind of wall you want instead? I'm failing to see the big deal but I'm only new to '76.
---
Considering how often people have complained about it, if it were an accidental push to live servers, why haven't they simply removed the tag already?
---
Yeah, don't blame the problem, blame the people.
---
why do you people still support this 
---
 real question not trying to be a dick
---
This was originally stated as a bug 2 months ago, but it was never fixed. Dataminers have found that she has an attribute that’s sole purpose is to prevent cripling.
---
As for the not landing, cripling the queen was the best way to get her to stay on. The ground which is why everyone is upset
---
They changed that to 760 atoms.
---
They're different but they're usually tied together. 
---
Frame rate is the smoothness of the animations. When everything gets twitchy and the animations go straight from frame A to frame E without the frames in between to make it fluid, it's a frame rate issue.
---
When it takes forever for your inputs to be recognized or the game soft locks, it's a lag issue.
---
You can have each by themselves, but you'll usually end up with both at the same time.
---
&gt;Bc its asinine to design multiple future content with the framework that some or even half of it may never make it into the game just for community input. Its wasted man hours especially if that choice affects the entirety of the future content that has been planned.
---
***So, I agree, if you are to design outcomes that can only be used that once and for that event, that would be bad design, and a waste of time and resource. But I'm not suggesting that, I'm suggesting, design four potential outcomes that are vastly different, and that can be tweaked if they need to slightly for each community event.That way, each event, you've already got three unused scenario outcomes, for factions that didn't "win" and you've written a 4th each community event.***
---
&gt;Ive seen ppl make posts on here like this, saying stuff like we should be able to boycott the BoS even showing up at all. As if Bethesda had some alternative narrative they spent months working on just in case enough of the players decided this isnt what they wanted to happen. While your suggestion of rewards being dictated by player choice isnt bad this playerbase would not be very reciprocal to the idea of “missing out” on the “other choice” rewards that other players would get and theyre locked out of. They barely handle the rotating atom shop cosmetics without complaining about missing out on something.
---
***I'm not expecting Bethesda has made any plans, but they could. So long as they designed the model right, it would allow for a better development framework and more interesting game. Elite Dangerous does this as an example, to a degree. If there's a chance of rewards coming round for the "next time" then that appeases the "I didn't get my way" complaints, also the suggestion of seperate tiered unique awards to the right of the flow chart means that people still get "unique faction awards" even if their faction of choice didn't win overall.***
---
&gt;But back to the idea of having that level of community input on the direction of the entire game’s future content based on events like this just isnt practical from a developers standpoint. Not to say it cant be done, but with this dev group and with the backlogs and delays and reoccurring bugs they already deal with constantly, I just cant see them being able to put content out in timeframes the community would be happy with. I think everyone needs to lower their expectation for community events as being some form of community input into the game and just accept them for what they are, time fillers with stretch goals and minor rewards while we wait for the new planned out story/gameplay content. Leave the community input for future content to the surveys they put out where they get direct input into what players want. The BoS having a bigger presence in the game was something that ppl asked for in those surveys and this is why were getting it.
---
***It's certainly been done with other online games before. Timeframes, of course that's got to be a consideration. I called out in the OP that the effects wouldn't necessitate being impactful in the next patch release, however, you could incorporate it into the cycle. Community event in Q1 has a gradual impact over Q2/Q3 by means of assets, by Q4 consequences are felt. It's just down to Bethesda managing planning, and the framework design correctly.***

I assume she buys six packs of the bulk bottles of pepto and pepcid At cosconnowdays
---
"80% is fixes NOBODY ASKED FOR" - and how did you get that figure? Many small bugs exist that people quietly report via the Bethesda ticket system and don't bitch about constantly on Reddit.
---
I ended up taking a screenshot of my ammo count with my phone so I could easily recall amounts. 
---
Still a pain when dealing with smaller quantities.
---
Technically thats not this BOS.  The hardliners anti mutant/anti ghoul BOS is Commonwealth.  This is still Maxson's true brotherhood, devoted to rebuilding a society and safeguarding the technology to do so
---
I bought the junk pack. Thought it had the power armor included. Sigh got both
---
to bad you can’t wear them, lol
---
No...  There have been a number of updates earlier on that increased the rates of blue-screens and freezes.  Those were much worse.
---
I actually agree with you 100% lol.
---
That's cuz that didn't happen. Just a Jew crying people did that
---
Lol, hate to be the one to inform you but nothing is rare anymore. Literally nothing.
---
That’s where the conspiracy theories come in - many people are convinced that they are intentionally lying to us. When originally brought up 2 months ago, it was recognized as a bug by Bethesda. People believe that it was Bethesda trying to quietly make the queen harder so they can discourage the instant kill builds from mowing down the queen. 
---
We don’t entirely know what is going on. We do know that if it is a bug, it’s low priority so it may not get fixed for a while even if the fix is just remove the attribute.
---
If it is Bethesda’s doing on purpose, they really need to be more open about changes like that.
---
Yeah like, I've been using bloody melee weapons for farming levels efficiently, but I may have to trade for a good vampire unarmed.
---
Some of us actually don't like to move our tents. I sure as shit won't for a lame event. Of course, I'm not wasting my scrap after seeing the loot table, and how 15% of the garbage we could get is bugged and won't drop at all.
---
Ha! :-)
---
I think it's a worry that it'll alienate people, however it's a marketing issue. Advertise the "replayability" aspect with multiple characters and they've spun any concerns into a positive.
---
I ask myself the same question every day
---
Okay, then it's the frame rate issue that's messing me up.   It's very, very jerky.   Thanks for lmk.   I wonder what causes frame rate issues.
---
I actually found a fix. If anyone also gets this problem hopefully they find this post for future reference.
---
You go to Documents/My Games/Fallout 76/Fallout76Prefs.ini and just find uFaceGenTextureResolution and just lower it. I set that to 120. May be able to go higher or lower but, this worked for me and looks significantly better than what I was previously dealing with.
---
Is there any function for the 'spin' part or is that just for aesthetics?
---
It's not that nobody cares, it's just nobody can help :( I don't know if Bethesda actually reads anything on this subreddit tho.
---
Not snapping is fine personally as you can make a circular wall with them. But they do form a continuous wall
---
They tried. And several now do. But many of them like making mods as a hobby, many more don’t live in the US, and a surprising number are or were underage when they started Modding.
---
„New“? 😂
---
What a waste of supplies for crap I dont want.
---
I put in 3k. I'd seen the drop chart already and still held out hope that maybe it was wrong, maybe they flipped a switch on the back end and added unique drops to the pool when it went live. Nope, nothing. I can't imagine how you feel after putting in 8k, my condolences.
---
I have things I've only seen once in 1700 hours.   Maybe others have stuff that's duped to hell and back, but I don't.
---
They should have never bought that shitty studio.
---
C.A.M.P's that people make are cool at times but when someone locks up a room, I respect it and just ingore it. I don't try to glitch in or break in to look around and be inspired of what they made, They most likely would have a Collectron or Ammo Factory behind the door.
---
I lock up my upstairs room to protect my Collectron, Ammo Factory, Turbo Fertilizer and extra crops I use for crafting, The Valuable Camp Items pretty much.. I'm going to say this now I don't make my locked area "beautiful" all I do is add wallpaper and floors that are the same below.
---
 The downstairs will look beautiful but the upstairs where it's locked isn't going to be good just protecting my valuables, so when I see someone try to glitch in or go upstairs I'll take it as them trying to break in and picklock my valuables and server hop.
---
I get it you may not consider resources gathers valuable or important and that's totally fine but I consider them to be and with the Atlas event happening now I'm going to need every bit of scrap I can get to help their cause.
---
That would solve it man! Cause we know they have the capability to add currencies, they just pull em out of nowhere. That’s the perfect solution. Screw re-creating the ammo maker, just have them do what you said!
---
if they want to make a full on survival crafting fallout game, thats fine, fallout is barely an RPG anymore anyways but they might as well have gone all in instead of half ass the building parts since so many people enjoy that and it wouldve been easy to see for them because of all the crazy and wonderful stuff people build in FO4. I got super excited for 76 just from them saying you could build your base anywhere across the map i thought it would be like alot of in budget fo4 settlements people do but I was wrong, although there is some cool stuff built before they ruin the building
---
A fix for the perks that *still* aren’t working such as Action Boy would be nice as well.
---
Firstly thank you for a decent response. Not just crying about the 1 thing that I said, that u don't like.
---
I genuinely didn't know people wanted more ammo points. I guess if u raise the number u can converter u have to increase the points.
---
Beth said they had broken the sbq and they would fix it. Its them not implementing fixes thats pisssing me off.
---
Its not broken the event. If anything when bigger boys show up its still too easy. They broke adrenaline and that didn't make it impossible to play we all adapted. I don't use rifleman, commado, heavy gun etc and still have no bother. Its them acknowledging they fucked it up saying that will fix it and not bothering. Maybe the answer is to assume that things don't get fix cos they are just beyond them?
---
Yeah sorry I forget about all the melee weapons. Still adding gauss versions of existing weapons is pretty poor work. Removing the explosive effect from all energy weapons is pretty poor work. When they added the screaming Eagle skin I thought that was gonna be a new .308 rifle as it said .308 on the side. Not the case, just a skin, that didnt work.
---
The god teir weapons are the end game for me and I feel like ive only got half a reward pool cos I didn't play the game at the start when it was almost unplayable. I'm over 700 hours and I've had 2 fixers (both of no value) from that purveyor. I know that's changed as of yesterday but it still heartbreaking to turn 2000 script into a load of shit thats gonna take me a week to slowly convert back to script to try again.
---
Time gating is and international design for silly throw away games on ur phone, not triple aaa releases from what I used to regard as the best in the business. We cannot allow this to become normal. I bought the game, I've done a couple of months of 1st. Let me play the fucking game.
---
We all cried about how long the raider/settler rep grind was and I finished that months ago. Probably done it twice over now cos I go back for the script every day. Still do all the dailies and most of the events (nobody goes near project paradise on xbox)
---
Sorry ive gone i little of topic here.
---
Ive been complaining about a broken game for 18 months. I'm now complaining about constantly being lied to. I know I'm being childish as fuck and that me running about giving everyone an VE15 minigun fixes absolutely nothing. However there are no consequences and it might just put a smile on someone's face.
---
I'll apologise in advance for any inaccuracies.
---
The one guy they pay to yell "WOOOOOO" every 3 seconds will drown them out
---
I pulled that figure out of my ass basically. Don't care about the numbers, I would just like to see the bugs fixed that everybody bitches about over and over again. Sure people send tickets about some of these small fixes, but people also send loads of tickets about the stuff we are bitching about.
---
I also just finally learned how to do this about one week ago.
---
Just bring back the replacing thing. We can’t make creative camps now
---
Also incredibly stupid. There's a global pandemic out there and ignoring it to protest over a game is frankly just about the stupidest thing someone could do.
---
Sadly no, it is a fo1st exclusive.
---
wrote this in another thread:
---
Right? I think they're tired of us rigging wires through walls and are trying to force the janky conduits on us
---
I just picked the game up with a buddy of mine and we are having a blast playing it together.
---
Trying to do everything co-op is a little bit wonky (for instance, we sometimes have to run missions twice so both of us can get quest progress) but that wonky-ness is more than made up by having a game that we can just explore and enjoy.
---
TL;Dr. You should give the game a chance especially if you have someone to play it with
---
Oh I'm banding on this, but I really enjoyed PVP and the fact that surprising a player (which others called griefing)  in  a game which concept is a wasteland after a nuclear apocalypse removed a lot of the flair and fun from the game. 
---
On this game, unlike fornite or many other new "games" TBH, I hardly find kids. Mostly old timers like me or adults, and seems this kind of game doesn't appeal to the angsty annoying teen
---
Fuck their thank you's.  Ain't getting any scrap from me after this patch
---
Don't buy this game pls, sucks af
---
"You are getting assfucked but get paid 1 dollar. You should be happy you get anything at all"
---
This is how your argument sounds.
---
Really? of all the things to be upset about thats what you’re choosing?
---
Mine lives under stored items in my build menu.
---
It was always a re-skinned military fatigues.  Same model, different colors, and different faction mods for each.  An alternative to the other skin tight BOS jumpsuits.
---
Oh wow... I didn't realize they fixed that. Those fuckers! Double sided walls and this healing "bugs" are "fixed" but not fucking fast travel or auto completion bugs. Once again, f\*ck you bethesda!
---
Simply use born survivor with one point and diluted stimpacks. Its much better than the bug.
---
Have a suppressed weapon, use cover and move position frequently. Marsupial mutation is great, rooftops are your friend.  I have a Bloodied stealth rifle build and don't have any Unyielding gear, the only time I die is if I am not paying attention.  Adrenal reaction mutation, Nerd Rage, Serendipity and one piece of Chameleon gear help a lot as well.
---
Update 5 was horse shit. I didn't play for nearly 4 months after that trash fire.
---
Do you really think Bethesda will give a shit if people boycott an event?
---
I would be down with the idea of modded servers except for one thing: I'm on playstation. Sony hates modding. This feature would be more or less useless.
---
I'm going to drop common plans everytime I saw someone in ATLAS. In exchange for 100 steel. I'm the Wanderer of Steel.
---
This guy seriously thinks Bethesda won't just wipe their asses with the formal e-mails and complaints anyway. People tried being reasonable to what is already an insult of an unfinished cash grab "game". We got ignored and insulted further as a result. Now is time for angry, more than ever.
---
We will simply not see any new round, curved or floating buildings, and all interior will have a barn wall in their living room. Just so effing disappointing
---
fallout 4
---
3\* legendaries will always drop random items from the full legendary table.
---
Though, it doesn't explain the run my main character is having where I would consistently get rolling pin drops.  It's a running joke in our crew that one of these days I'll get a Junkies Faster Swing Speed Explosive rolling pin and it will all be worth it.
---
I recently started a couple of new characters and I have been getting good or decent drops much more often.  Maybe it because I've been playing more hours on them, finding more legendaries, and with volume you are more likely to find something good.  It's easy to forget about all of the earlier bad drops when you get something good.
---
So dont mod a legacy camp from now on - shit sweet i love mine
---
Did it actually auto complete, or just get the tick icon next to it? Myself and many others got the latter, but you can still complete them as normal. (Just double checking before you give up hope)
---
"Pixel Fiction" is my new indie band name
---
The camp building community was huge and now we’re extremely limited to what we can do
---
Just sent a very similar message in a ticket to bethesda. Its out of love for Fallout, not hate for the sake of it. I want this game to succeed so we can all enjoy it for years to come
---
They aren't what was promised.
---
Stop being a sheep. Bethesda has pretty much killed the camp building community
---
It's indeed hard to answer such question because the answer is very subjective. I had my doubts before I bought this game, so I tried it during free weekend and bought it on sale shortly after because I enjoyed it. I'd say I had much more fun as a new player than I do now, you have to discover a lot of things, there are many quests and exploration of the world is entertaining. But even tho high level stage is full of grind, there's another kind of fun. You're not forced to save the world or follow certain type of behaviour, you set a goal for yourself and you achieve it. You build a camp that's one of a kind, you collect all nuka cola in the world or teddy bears, or maybe you grind for every plan in the game. Either way it's a grind and can be enjoyable. Bugs and some inconveniences sure can ruin the mood sometimes, but overall I think the game has a lot to offer to entertain you.
---
Why do you have to bee rude? It's not just him, this sub is being showered with these.
---
So it seems my main goal at the moment is to find a weapon I can silence. Thanks for all the advice. I really appreciate it.
---
This kinda stuff could have been added as rewards for a Raider quest or to expand the Bullion menus.
---
Why all the dipshit decisions when adding FO4 gear ???
---
Bethesda, keep the game interesting by dribbling in FO4 stuff as quest plans or in new evemts. Keep loyal players excited and happy.
---
Add new things only to the Atomshop and I'd bet you'll make lots more Atom sales and a lot more money = nailed on loyalty and content and a content and  happy community. A communitynI migh add is amongst the most loyal in gaming !!
---
Sorry but people are too competitive and will try to make the best camp possible.
---
Guess now I can’t add anything else to my pre-war style bunker over by top of the world. I’m just glad i got all my rooms built already and all my cables wired outside before they restricted changing wall types :/
---
Agreed. I'll be canceling my FO1st. This is just stupid. I understand you're trying to make it all stable but if that was truly your goal, then maybe you should have picked a more straggler platform from the get go. 
---
Congrats though, you truly matched the rest of the suckage in 2020... jerks.
---
And you know it
---
I never intended to participate in this "event" anyway. The community rewards alone are trash tier and cut-off copies of previous community events (double SCORE, discount purveyor) that are being sold as seperate community rewards now, instead of being ACTUAL special events already by themselves. Not even to start about the caches you get when you hand in the junk...
---
I do speak from a PC perspective but when bethesda promised it they didn't say if was PC exclusive. On the console side we seen fo4 modded using a mod menu. Why not have the ability to click/I click features one would like on their server.
---
Of which I'm not a part of. To me, camp building is something I do if I'm to bored to run a silo but not bored enough to play a different game. I don't give a shit about what they change with it.
---
Yeah, I have one chameleon piece I use. So I think a complimentary weapon for this build is the way to go. Thanks for the help. It’s very appreciated.
---
I suspect the number of devs is now probably too low to maintain such a game with quality content other than low level mods equivalent...
---
A lot of things are incredibly lazy since a long time now.   
---
It's sad because the world itself is not lazy at all.
---
What *hasn’t?*
---
what you got exactly?
---
I am definitely boycotting this mission. I still don't have the observatory unlocked for fast travel, and it's going to stay that way. I also want to remember them promising the return of Meat Week, and now it's locked behind the insane grind that is this stupid mission. NOPE, just a big NOPE.
---
Life giver + speed demon + adrenal gave autoheal. They fixed that now but it isnt a problem, born survivor on level 1 with diluted stims is much stringer anyway.
---
The first storyline bringing them in is scheduled for the next “season”, starting September sometime
---
I never nuked anything because I really didn't need to. I feel like I'm going to complete this challenge tomorrow :D
---
Wow, such cool comment.  Must have big PP to be that cool ....
---
A short note for those who aren't aware: If (solo-)building is your focus and the camp restrictions annoy you, Fallout 4 might actually give you a better building experience. It allows free-form placement for anything that requires snapping in 76 and has no annoying "this item needs support" checks. You can also build at as many places as you want, not just one camp. There's also small and easy mods that allow you to build anywhere in the world like camps do, not just at the predefined workshops in 4. And easy ways to get rid of building budgets.
---
What's really funny here is there's just no way this Atlas 'event' isn't about selling more 1st subs and tricking those that don't sub to help push up those *engagement* numbers. We are all that fanboy standing outside Atlas, we just didn't know it.
---
About 4000ish caps, lots of plans that I had already, floater grenades, booze booze booze and some meds.
---
Nothing amazing at all.
---
But I don't want to move my tent, it is where it is for a good reason. I regularly go up to crater for bullion and radstag. I don't want to spend a load of caps going to crater all the time. And many people have a stash box which is full, so no, I don't want to put a load of steel in it as I will have to take other stuff out.   
---
But sure, clearly it is me that is the problem rather than Bethesda just not either putting a Scrapbox by the stashboxes, or letting us withdraw materials from the stash if needed.
---
ok, thx , didn't knew that since I don't use Life Giver
---
I'm cancelling mine I will just fucking walk everywhere
---
What do you expected? Sadly, it is known there is nothing new, ansd thevplans are the same as the presents/moleminer, minus the event-only plans.
---
My pp is so big Johnny Sins would be impressed
---
I'm not even going to donate anything
---
I’m sorry, but you haven’t seen the other 76 bitch posts about this?
---
Do you read Patch Notes? Some of these 'small' fixes may be more rare and not parroted on Reddit multiple times a day but when they occur they can be very disruptive, frustrating, sometimes even game breaking - eg falling under the map, getting stuck, altering scrapping priority etc etc etc.
---
Bethesda isn't a one man company and it is possible to have teams working on different issues simultaneously.
---
I’m in ! League at least fixes their bugs when they see it or get reported of it
---
I donno what I expected.  But something more than that.  Maybe each turn in we can get the new time-gating currency that is gonna happen with Brotherhood of Steel arrives.. even if its 1 BOS-Buck.
---
As a single player games fan I agree. I do like coop games, but hate multiplayer and this game feels more like coop with strangers rather than mmo lol. I had no trouble immersing into the world, reading quests and talking to every NPC without anyone annoying me, on the contrary most people would either ignore me, say hi and leave or give something nice and leave xD if you want to be completely isolated from other players you can also turn off the voice chat.
---
I haven't played since I 100%ed the game way back. Did they do this just to fix the wiring through walls glitch? Man, I can't believe they'd bother after all this time.
---
I kind of appreciated the historical accuracy of them not working. ;p
---
Those ticks are damn confusing. I thought for a second that mine had auto completed before I joined my first team after logging in
---
Just a note on this, the last time I checked, endurance on ALL armors (inc. underarmor) was broken and didn't give any extra hp.
---
Probably worth testing, but I would be surprised if they fixed it as the bug has been around since launch.
---
Well, last time, they only could enter to your stash, if you have a glitched camp budget and your camp is not fully loaded when the customer used your vendor. So, maybe it is same.
---
Who knows, I’ve got from the Xbox app for free. Won’t play unless I delete everything else off my SSD though so it won’t be getting played until Bethesda sort a patch out... that hasn’t happened since launch so I guess I just won’t play it.
---
A previous post here showed the datamining info on drops which were very lackluster for the seasoned players base. I have everything in the list. To be fair I have every plan in the game less 20.
---
I think this community event was made for two reasons. To give the new players a chance to get the plans we've gotten from past events and to pull some junk from the game to stabilize servers. Knowing all of this I donated 30k worth of steal. I'd like to get the community swag and don't really need that steal. The contents of the boxes I'll end up giving away.
---
I do think they should put a handful of rare new plans in the mix. Give us something to get excited about.
---
It is better in some ways (10x and 100x are great) but they also took out stuff that was already there which was helpful. 3 steps forward 2 steps back is still 1 step forward, but also still really annoying.
---
hahah, well toché. But seriously, just don't see how your comment accomplishes anything other then being a dick,
---
100% cores will go for 1c per % charge, but I refuse to sell less than 100% and I sell at 75c each. They go faster than corona beer at the pub lol
---
Yeah, They are saving their Bos Assets for the awards for the next legendary run.
---
Lol I'm quitting
---
Beth doesn't reddit well. The more posts there are about the same subject, the higher the chance they will take note.
---
Complain posts on their forum are taken down by their mods, so this is one of the few ways to maybe get their attention.
---
Or some rare plans, BoS themed backpack, or statues, etc... nothing big, but something.
---
And then ad it as an ATX item you have to buy...
---
It's easily worse now because it displays every type of ammo and every conversion amount regardless of whether or not you have enough ammo to convert. You either have to know exactly how much ammo you have before accessing the terminal, or waste time clicking and getting a "transaction failed" message. 
---
So sure, if you know you have thousands of rounds of unwanted ammo stockpiled, you can get rid of it in seconds and that's cool. But otherwise, they made it worse.
---
No we are still perectly fine and better than the rest of you... ;) 
---
We just use born survivor one level 1 with diluted stims. :p
---
Good to know, it does not with barn.
---
Although the shotgun nerfing hit me hard. Looking back 8.5 there was the worst, didn't they als decrease durability around the same time?
---
Skyrim SE, Fallout 4. Going back to these games after FO76 has been amazing. And not one crash, disconnect, grind or greifing.
---
Its not that I dont think it would be a better way to do it and I kno others have done somewhat similar approches but they are outliers for sure. The majority of multiplayer MMOs or really any games with communities like that dont see that kind of direct input bc its so difficult to manage. I dont think this team has the capacity from an experience to the manpower. Bethesda would need to make deep reinvestments into the game that i dont think theyre ready to take. And yes like you said, they could find ways to reuse some of the branching narrative content theyd hav to plan for the losing factions but even with the winning ones these community events would be far in advance of the planned implementation into the game. I would guess closer to a year than a couple of quarters. By then the build up and hype they wanted the event to accomplish has died down and time they spend finishing that content would be filled with what? More filler content that the community is already sick of. Maybe when they have some more seasonal events than just fasnacht/meat week/halloween/xmas they can use those to fill that void without using community events with no narrative impact but rn its not enough. Seasons is nice but its not new gameplay just rewards for doing the same content. Even when the new BoS main questline finally comes the community will burn thru it in a month just like wastlanders and immediately start asking for the next one. Regardless how long this BoS stuff can be played thru, id venture it still took the entirety of the dev devoted to story content at least half a year or more to produce. From conception to patch date maybe longer. Believe me if I thought they could do something like that Id be 100% down for it, and maybe with the full fallout team working on it they could but as is I cant see it happening. Itd be nice tho.
---
I've only donated around 1500 so far (non-FO1st so no deep stores to raid) mostly from what I had already as I'm loath to devote specific time and resources to the PoS BoS.
---
I'll be opening the reward boxes at a vendor spot so I can quickly and easily offload 90% of the junk that results. I was hoping for some Ultracite PA  mods to be included in the mix as this is what I'm lacking but it seems I am to be disappointed even if I go nuts every day.
---
Just add a fucking UI like the trading UI ffs
---
Couldn’t agree more with you! I haven’t renewed my FO1st membership since last issue before Wastlanders and more likely will not renew in any nearest future as so far i have seen only pain with every new idea they implement... so far only Great thing they come up with are Public Teams. They have taken Fun factor out of the game and turned it into some sort of Candy crush where you do same thing over and over and have little to nothing time for your own creativity and way to play... sad...
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dtOQTR1VeK0&amp;feature=youtu.be
---
I can't complain about your camp, and alot of other folks are handling it that way which is totally OK imo - I almost instantly go back once I break into such a room. All these items someone can loot are lockable except for the plants which take less then 4 mins to grow again.
---
But sadly I had so much camps with locked entrance where I could saw workbenches or players stash crates inside which I could use due overcumbering or repair my weapon on an low lvl char. Or, the worse kind, having a wired and filled vending machine locked out. Why? It just made me sad so many times...
---
I thought of a better way for bethesda to do things here:

True but the most common way to prioritize your work load is to take the impact on the playerbase into account. A bug that has been reported 100 times should be fixed before a bug that is reported 3 times unless the impact of the latter bug is really, really significant.   
---
I understand that many teams can work on different things but I just don't understand how these teams prioritize.
---
Not the flat ones with the bracket supports.
---
I’m not totally sure if it’s that. 
---
I went to Harpers Ferry and moved my cards about, but I couldn’t work out what was actually causing nearly all my shots to mis my targets. 
---
I was targeting this particular Super Mutant with Vats at the torso. The first shot went to the left of him, the second shot to the right, the third shot above his head, and the fourth shot to the torso. 
---
This Super Mutant was that close to me that he was passing insults. 
---
I seem to be missing more than I hit last night. 
---
I used over 750 rounds and died twice because of my shots not meeting there targets. 
---
I moved over to the Whitesprings before retiring for the night trying to score some points. 
---
When I was there I ran out of ammunition for my gauss shotguns and swapped to my 10mm pistol. 
---
I don’t have any gunslinger cards in place for for my pistol, and I was dropping the ghouls from one to three shots with zero bullets missing. 
---
How does one explain this?
---
It's quicker if you massive backlogs to convert and I erased most of my 38 ammo in seconds, but it's actually worse on smaller amounts such as those externally present 40mm and missile event rewards that trickle in quietly and heavily. 
---
And why, oh why are the buy/sell pages not separated as the first ui option?
---
Frame rate issues are sometimes tied to overheating or an overwhelmed CPU. Of you're on a console, try cleaning your fans with compressed/canned air (not a vacuum, it's basically a Van de Graaff generator and can cause static discharge issues). Depending upon how tech savvy you are, cleaning the heatsinks and repasting could help too.
---
Lol why would you want to support something like this?
---
well, rip.
---
"*Metrics have shown* that changing restrictions on placeable buildings and objects generates additional playtime for users blahblah". I dont know if its true, but I know I'd do it if I needed to milk playtime out my dead game.
---
In other words, presents.
---
I donated about 12k steel across my 4 characters yesterday. The underwhelming rewards, both for the donations, and the community rewards, mean I'm not going to bother with any more.
---
In fact, when I've completed the legendary run, which I should be able to do in a week or 2, I think it's time for a break from the game entirely.
---
Then you'll understand the next time you try to use it. 
---
Works great now, for those that had massive stacks sitting around. 
---
For those of us that were converting large quantities of smaller amounts ( 42 .38, 88 shotgun, 5 flares etc) it's now much more tedious.
---
I don't have the stash space to store 1000 rounds of trash ammo. It was a good way to gain a few extra 5.56 before as I could collect while playing and when my stash hit limit I'd spend 5 minutes spamming 'X' to convert all the ammo. Now that 5 minutes has turned into 20 and it's just no longer worth the time investment.
---
It seems you are right, it mentions these two - 
---
* **Walls:** Fixed an issue where slanted walls could not be snapped to roofs.
---
* **Walls:** Fixed an issue that could allow walls to be snapped to overhanging roofs and upper floors, which could be used to create floating walls.  
---
which covers the floating wall aspect and some of the roof changes, I thought it mentioned the switching doors as part of that. In which case it might be linked to those, or possibly to this: 
---
**Client Stability:** Attempting to replace a Fence in Modify mode no longer sometimes crashes the game client. 
---
If so, this might be an "unintended consequence".
---
That fucker's got a mind of his own...
---
Previously, I had stuff from my stash show up in vending, and I did not have a glitched camp budget.
---
As an adult who sleeps on a California King allow me to retort with a
---
I get you. So much of the cosmetics are just ports from older games and the Creation Club including Captain Cosmos.
---
Brotherhood Scrips are a surprise tool that will help us later! You weren’t supposed to know about those, but you have a knack for finding out things you shouldn’t..
---
Happend to me 30 mins ago
---
Nobody should buy atoms period. I don't know how we all as a society got so stupid as to be willing to pay for parts of a game we already paid for.
---
You forgot that teslas now crash games.
---
Coukd them enter to you vendor before your whole camp loaded in? I mean, maybe the spawn points is too close to the vending machine.
---
How is that a good thing? Bloodied is under 20% all the time. So you use a stimpak every 20 seconds?
---
Now that you're mentionning it, I didn't notice a difference with my HP ... endurance is also supposed to lower your chances of getting sick so I hope this bit is working, at least. :s
---
Hah. Did you just ask them to listen to their player base?
---
I couldn't agree more... They patched it to the worse. Why not like this:  
---
1. Display available ammo types (even if it is only one bullet)
---
2. Select amount of ammo you'd like to convert (like when selling things to a vendor)
---
3. Regardless of what amount I select the machine should convert the quantity I provide and I should receive ammo points (the machine should do the maths...)
---
4. In the end you have traded in all ammo and don't have a rest left which you need to put back into your stash or drop or whatever...
---
They must have a dev team size of 10 and 9 of those work on cosmetics. They want to run this as a game as a service yet we get nothing of substance. Almost 2 years since release and the only major content we have had dropped was the 4 hour wastelander quest. Even wastelanders could of been so much better, a bunch more events could of been added, but most importantly actual choices, why do we get to be in both the raiders and the settlers? 3 years from now we are going to be valued members of the BoS, Enclave, settlers, raiders, NCR and the Bladez with no consequences.
---
Its cute that people actually still expect "effort" from Bethesda. The introduction of the BoS is the laziest thing they could have done for the next update.  
---
All the seasonal events will be the same garbage Christmas present/miner pail loot pool which is just full of very heavily duped plans that not many people are gonna want to grind for.
---
I hope so. Id love to see this event fail miserably
---
Boycotting the BoS stuff will give them the wrong impression. You know how out of touch beth is, next thing they will cancel the BoS update. Rather cancel your 1st subs, stop buying atoms, send this as a bug report, make a post about how this update was a mistake. I would really like a BoS update and an Enclave update and so on, more content. If the rewards for Atlas is pathetic voice your complaint over that, don't combine, confuse the issues. That will just confuse beth and next thing you know they focus on junk and forget about this screwup of a "bug fix'.
---
Small update, i found a way to make it work; if you analyze the blood sample before you put the t-fuse in it works. It wont work in the reverse. However, it does seem to lag on the t-fuse a few times; so you may need to reload for the t-fuse.
---
I'd pass on that. Vampire's isn't about the damage but the hits. A level 1 Vampire's knife will give you the same healing as a level 50 Vampire's sniper rifle. The only melee weapons viable for healing are Rippers(if you can get a legendary one at all) and Mr. Handy Buzz Blades, and they're only viable with a glitched 'magic' legendary(limb damage). Emphasize stealth or power armor with melee, there's no sense in ruining your armor and burning thru supplies doing it any other way.
---
Only need one bitching post not every post
---
Its so funny. Even low level players is saying the awards ain't worth it
---
They don't actually fix things, they update to introduce new bugs. That is my conclusion.
---
its fallout 76 no progress, probably at the end we got notification collecting is done or not. That is how game keep us in game longer time.
---
Yes it’s a solid game. Especially on sale pricing. You can’t go wrong. I think this game gets a real bad rep, but it’s good fun. 
---
The big problems and issues really start appearing once you reach end game (or lack of end game if you get my drift). 
---
You can easily put a hundred hours in having fun exploring the world and doing story quests.
---
Dunno for me this event feels pointless. I could imagine this in different way, a global event that could happen ( or trigerred by player if you spend like 1k steel or sth ).
---
Reclaiming ATLAS from Robots and scavenging inside ATLAS for materials to build up BoS outpost. They could literaly make a dungeon like radiation rumble but bigger.
---
More fun, add 2 difficulties for low levels and end-game players. Some unique loots/plans.
---
And it should be actual BoS scout or someone else doing reconnaissance
---
Not even the vendors want them
---
Yea don't worry. You didn't miss much. I tried it once and it was sooo OP glitch. You would always instantly heal up when you fell below certain health. Can't understand why people whine about this as it is clearly not intended..
---
Well you were able to build two walls on the same foundation snap points, facing in opposing directions, given you a thicker wall that has the interior side on both sides. This allowed you to put wallpaper on both sides and use them as interior walls.
---
Images: [https://imgur.com/a/igJIMgA](https://imgur.com/a/igJIMgA)
---
Gotta love the irony that it actually is slightly worse after this fix
---
I was boycotting the atlas event anyway. The BoS are garbage and I have no interest in helping them.
---
They're only shoehorned back into the game to sell more shit in the atomic shop anyway
---
This wasn't part of trap camps, so go cry about your pvp issues somewhere else.
---
I agree, it's a huge waste of money that we spend real money on that crap. Especially since you don't own the cosmetics you spent money on, once the servers are down its gone.
---
Then fix all the issues in the game, and bake a cake of rainbows and smiles and we can all eat it and be happy... 🌈
---
The reward comes at the end! Its a community goam
---
And your "donating" so why do you expect a reward at all?
---
Dont go rant about something we all knew already pls.
---
I'm not in game at the moment so can't check - does your endurance special (shown in pipboy) increase when you equip it?
---
If so then maybe, if not then probably not.
---
Weird. If I could turn in scrap metal and cork and shit in return for booze and hand grenades IRL I’d be soo stoked...
---
This will cause issues now building pirate ships and ufo's ffs
---
make sure you scroll down. no info yet though. [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events)
---
Sorry about my wording I'm exhausted.
---
So are the rewards for turning in junk just common plans you can't sell?
---
You can find it at  [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events) 
---
Not like they've bothered to update it, probably a manual process that will get done once a day.
---
If you're going to set a target for something like, especially if it only runs for 4 days, at least update the thing once an hour. People who really care about it will get some sense of achievement seeing the meter moving. With the people who were hoarding steel in preparation, we could already have made it.
---
Chances are the progress bar figures will be made up by Bethesda anyway, to either make it look like people are participating, or to slow it down to leech as much steel out of the system as they can. Not that it's hard to get steel if you know how...
---
Bro nooooooo. Look at the rewards that you will get, [There is nothing good at all!!!!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i3o7ar/fortifying_atlas_donors_provisions_drop_list_and/)
---
Why fix stuff that nobody complains about but is having fun with, but major bugs (like the fast travel bug thats annoying as f*ck) are ignored
---
They really know how to suck the last fun out of this game
---
I donated half my steel so if we fail that’ll be a big rip
---
Public test server

---
No only when you get hit and serendipity and ricochette doesnt trigger, try it, its very powerful.
---
Same with the neon letters. 
---
I moved my camp and they were on the outside wall.
---
Some nuclear winter icons don’t work either I used the crocodile one for my entire time with the game until I got the skeleton from nuclear winter only to find its invisible! The sloth icon doesn’t work either. &gt;:(
---
And I just read this now, when I run around to collect trash... just finished the challenge in the hard way.
---
Collecting from woods are counted, but one by one, so you have to collect from 100 logs to finish that part. Better to find cement bag.
---
Keep in mind Russel is asking for it
---
Yeah, let them know this kind of rubbish event is not good enough, especially with these rewards.
---
What posse me off is that it's not the ludicrous amount of bugs or the creeping up of nefarious monetization that topped people over the edge.
---
Its the fixing of a fucking exploit.
---
Where was all the anger over all the bugs that don't get fixed and are remaining in the game????
---
Why weren't you all this pissed with the combination of stuff like auto complete, adrenaline being borked, fast travel but not getting fixed. Vats being screwed. Now all of that is worthy of a meltdown.
---
By not, your showing Bethesda that that is ok. They can get away with it.
---
That's what is annoying me.
---
I got a legacy camp too, since the days we could place purifiers on campfires. I wonder if they place on these urban floors now.
---
Someone has to do it XD on the plus though had 52 caps left with vendor caps done already due to plan splurging and donated enough to have 1000 so was alright. Loot kinda meh though with it being bos would of preferred some of their energy ammo
---
Their C-Team works on this game...
---
A lot of things in this game need a complete overhaul... Weapon balance is another example. They said in the past they wanted to completely overhaul weapon balance but I have heard absolutely nothing on the matter since then.
---
But... you can sell plans. Look it up. I’ve been buying all the jet pack plans for cheap and selling them right back to vendors.
---
'slightly worse'....i reserve the right to use stronger terms. 😁
---
The ride NEVER ends with Bethesda, holy shit.
---
probably once per 4days
---
This was the only useful thing I got from 10k steel Sugar Bombs (post-war, with rads) .
---
So explain us why it was needed to fix camp building glitches? Who got a disadvantage out of it?
---
Also please point out why the content we're waiting for weeks now got postponed yet again while it already worked flawlessly on pts? I didn't found a single bug or anything that won't work well... I also done the event with my clan several times and no one noticed anything uncommon, we even looked active for exploits or other uncommon stuff. 
---
Sure its needed to alter scrapping prio, but were some other changes really needed?
---
Seems like a waste of stims to me.. I don't need to heal every little bit of damage i take (especially with healing factor).. Until i'm somewhere around 5-10% health. But i keep that in mind :) I always thought it would just keep taking stims every 20 secs.
---
Theres plenty of placea to farm ghouls.
---
Why is this more annoying than fast travel bug not being fixed?
---
If anything, it's brought more junk into the game. People farming the steel etc end up with other junk too.
---
Doing runs through places like Westek with the scrapper perk, means you can get big amount of steel and wood from the weapons easy. Never mind the ammo, other junk and chems from the corpses as well.
---
Fucks sake BGS 
---
My entire camp build is based on bringing wires through swapped walls and placing x2 adjoining doorways and changing them to walls. 
---
What else are you going to break
---
It’s honestly annoying
---
Nothing like that has been datamined yet AFAIK.  Usually ATX stuff is known pretty far in advance.  I imagine something will come eventually but they've messed up by not planning the "fix" to coincide with new content.   Had they done that, we'd be seeing people thankful for fulfilling a long requested feature and possibly even being thankful for saved build budget instead of the usual clusterfuck.
---
It's strange that the Bethesda community members always have the time to talk about how nice somebody's screenshot is and lots of comments ready to go when they get a modicum of praise, but any time there's issues (quite a lot of the time), they go missing for weeks.
---
You could probably write a simple bot to work out if a post is positive or not and comment "Cool!" if it's positive or "We're working on a fix for this." if it's not and put them out of a job.
---
or just leave the window in place 🧐
---
I’m just saying they made a mess of my camp. I’m going to miss those magical doorframes.
---
Lost 9500 SCORE today all daily and weekly have autocompleted. Game did an update yesterday and had to reload at the menu screen before I could get in
---
I'm so tired of this tone deaf attitude from Bethesda.
---
Getting vendor trash as a reward! That's is what keeps me going!
---
It really only triggers when you loose hp. For the waste: one stimpack plus one water plus chemist gives 4 diluted. Add super duper and its really cheap.
---
They stated they are looking into it on my post from yesterday
---
Yep. Seedy shed and log cabin walls no longer accept wall racks unless you fart around with it. Regular walls only the top third of the wall racks actually align to like normal.
---
Being more pissed at the fixing of an exploit rather than the insane amount of bugs that get added or stay in the game for months at a time. *sigh*.
---
GAMURS RIZE UP!
---
That's what I'm thinking ain't no way they aren't putting in some random number every update. It would be some sad press if they set out a community goal and we didn't hit it.
---
You have no idea how many times bugs have been reported, only how many times they have been raged about.  If Beth were to concentrate solely on just 1 or 2 issues I bet people would simply bitch about the ignoring of the many other broken things. Multiple studios and multiple teams means they are quite capable of looking at more than one issue, and some are far easier to fix than others.
---
And they introduced BOSA: The Brotherhood of Steel and Alcohol that requires steel and give useless alcohol LOL.
---
The problem is that fallout 4 was already a knotted mess thats built on morrowinds engine and has skyrims assets unused in the files.
---
no, the ultracite laser rifle was SUPPOSED to trade off damage for a better Rate of Fire, but when you use mods, it makes them the same RoF, making UC Laser Rifles pointless
---
&gt;Collision Course
---
you can also do the uranium fever, it spawns a shit ton of enemies all with shotguns and molerat gauntlets, having scrapper perk on, you can easily get 700ish steel from doing the event once
---
Ah, thanks have to try that out
---
Its never going to happen, I've personnaly given up trying to get these weapons noticed by the devs and Bethesda, they are not interested in fixing them because they are too busy pushing newer stuff into the game which also are not finished.
---
I also find a great amount of displeasure when i get a 3 ☆ shovel... which is also in need of a crafting plan.....
---
great. this isnt the thread i was hoping to find when i had the issue.
---
Petition this, everyone is outraged
---
How about actually putting deep pocketed in the game to start with?
---
This is all completely avoidable.  Community managers are either incompetent or being sidelined.
---
&gt;Signal Strength
---
Sounds about right, all that level scaling is messed up, when I was doing the Hunter for Hire (the one where you build crane sign to get some people to come) i was lvl 6, and the gangsters that came were levels 58 and 59. Didn't have stats to convince them, so i ended up having 2 pissed off high levels in my camp at all times... 10/10 would die repeatedly again
---
That would have been a better and more fitting bos turn-in event: scrip for plans!
---
True, the 1st discount is a valid thing, there are atleast 1 item each week for reduced price.
---
well, nothing new under the sun.
---
No a single original new plan. Nothing incentive. If you are able to massively give scrap in this event, you probably also already know all plans.
---
That is true, I have no idea how many tickets. However, I dare to say that the number of posts on Reddit here will be reflected in the number of tickets.   
---
Also, it takes just 5 minutes for them to come on reddit and see what we think is most important.
---
Honestly I hope it fails. No offense haha. The "rewards" just isnt rewards at all. You give in scrap that you can use to craft useful items or thing like ammo, for something that is  more useless than scrap.
---
Worst update this year maybe.
---
V.A.T.S Unknown was a punch in the dick. Not to mention the issue which some people got a Lev 20 and others got a Lev 50. I still rock a the chainsaw, saves me ammo on Queen fights. But i agree, the Dev's aren't listening.
---
So there is a building glitch in fallout, where you can change a doorway into a wall or window and because of that you could snap two brick doorways together onto the same "seam" of a foundation, convert them back to walls and have wallpaper on both sides, as well as that it was good for putting things into walls like vending machines, fireplaces, just about anything.
---
By removing this mechanic or glitch for the game you are denying and upsetting a huge amount of the community who enjoy making bases etc. It seems odd that they are patching it as it has no effect on anyone else. It doesn't make you invincible or anything. Its a shame as I think there will be a huge backlash for a large majority of players in the community.
---
Don’t reverse this fix, just make a decent pass through wire conduit and make wallpaper work on both sides of the wall. 
---
I’d rather this than having to effectively soak up 70% more walls in my budget
---
There is 1st membership discounts in the shop, each week... few weeks ago, we had the clean nuka machine, then the cement barriers (not walls), etc...
---
Well yeah true, but the rewards are not even rewards at all. Its worse than the mole miner event. Here is the list of the rewards that you will get if you donate 250 steel. Warning: Its a list full of useless items. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i3o7ar/fortifying_atlas_donors_provisions_drop_list_and/
---
This is what they'll probably do if they ever do add it.
---
Every single bit of content added is aimed at low levels. That should show where their priorities are at
---
yeah, im level 80 something. i gave 1k steel, im not giving anything else. I didnt get shit except some grenades i just sold to the vendor.
---
Regs has yet to get the memo. It's like he lives in a bunker!
---
I can destroy like 95% of players in this game with no armor and bench made weapons. 😐
---
I'm just a wicked pack rat and love my deep pocketed everything.
---
Wait....you honestly think the progress bar is legit?    
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztVMib1T4T4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztVMib1T4T4)
---
they probably already have each “ update” planed. They know which one will complete, and how soon, and by how much it will over complete. Why? Because having any part of it fail outright would be a fairly substantial Publicity Bomb, with media outlets and click baiters smearing Bethesda from here untill the launch of Starfield, and possibly beyond.
---
but having people finish off the objectives with many being seemingly finished off in hours? Given the quantity’s listed most of there pet outlets will be positily dancing like Cats smellin Catnip laced fresh tuna, as they positively Crow over ”Bethesdas Return!” with each announced massive overfulfiment of the Bosses stockpile. 
---
Sorry if this sounds a bit too cynical coming from me. But Bethesda freaking earned it the second there so called spokes person Troted out word for freaking word with only the brand name changed the same Promised my kid Pizza but I got the Flue therefore I’m not lying because shit happens excuse that Steven Hoffenberg used years ago. (Towers Financial Ponzi scam back in the 90s)
---
Bethesda has put out nothing but buggy garbage for a decade, are you really surprised?
---
Well tbh, if you sold all the steel for 1 each, you wouldve had 50k caps.
---
Sorry if it was ambiguous \^\^"
---
Foo bill
---
This is a good idea.
---
What about conduits
---
I already put the sample in, when I reload the game it gives me the t fuse to put back in but the it just says please place the sample in the centrifuge and try again
---
&gt; **Submachine Gun (.45)**  
---
&gt;The  scorched killer’s receiver nearly doubles the fire rate, from 75 to  127. This does not occur on any other weapon. This is the fire rate it had in Fallout 4, so it’s most likely a copy/paste that got through like the handmade drum mags.
---
[Holy crap you weren't kidding.](https://i.imgur.com/r61a2LG.jpg) I put it on my 25% faster firerate SMG just for shits and giggles and it now has the same rate of fire as my non-FFR LMG. It may be doing piss poor damage but it feels like an actual honest to god Tommy gun now. I gotta find me a junkie's FFR SMG now to mitigate the damage loss because this thing is fun as hell to use.
---
Well it cant be any worse than their previous event, treasurehunter... Or is it... Cant even tell anymore whats the biggest sh*t
---
What new players?
---
Gamepass can't access the game because of "region ping", Steam can't access the game because they suddenly don't own the game anymore...
---
Idk bro I hit up Bethesda, I'm hoping that'll help somehow
---
Ah ok, thanks!! I haven't played long so my camp is pretty basic, just open plan with some vendors inside.  I haven't played since Saturday so from what I hear there's been a few changes!
---
Well. This update did drive away another large percentage of the PvP community. Have you seen the chains teslas leave behind?
---
You say you're a dev, but honestly you don't know much about prioritizing bugs
---
Not the amount of bug reports of the same bug does effect the criticality resp. priority but the impact on the gaming... 
---
As an example:
---
Tesla rifles which causes ranged weapons to deal no more damage is a major bug... You have to rejoin a server to fix this. 
---
Joining a server and get the prompt that the weapon has no ammo is a minor bug, you can change and change back weapons to fix this.. 
---
OK... The Photo frame is the least important fix we needed but reddit is not the complete player base nor is it the official way to report bugs nor is it a indicator how critical a bug is
---
Compared to every single other game that loads lever action guns from the right side, the 76 one where the character meekly loads it from the left is like a limp dick animation.
---
Im saying does the specific instance you don’t want a window, it still works
---
Damn bro, sorry to hear that trust me I Kno how annoying it is, I restarted the game like 7 times
---
How does this show that the community doesn't care about the discounts. They have been in a tab not marked fallout 1st. And Maybe some people have liked it but nobody knew those discounts were for fallout 1st members. Nothing to indicate it. So it´s hard to care about something you don't know about. Plus the numerous things they have promised for fallout 1st members but nothing has come.
---
Because Todd has herpes.
---
i for one wont be donating any more mats unless the rewards are something ill actually use. you know, like steel.... oh wait.
---
What system are you on?
---
If they were going to do this, it absolutely should have been implemented at the same time and without atom cost.
---
Later, my Padawan. Be patient. They will add those walls one by one... and the end, as a bundle, but ypu already bought each with higher price.
---
That is because ER has very little to do with defense in PvP.
---
It's not just that, from the previous patch you could double wall to use wall paper inside their builds. That's just a small part of the changes.
---
Why on earth just they decide to do it? Because they’re a shit company
---
Omg the update to the ammo converter somehow made it 10x worse to use. I actually had a good flow worked out with the old one. Now I have to know exactly how much of each ammo I have to use the converter or it gives you an error message. Every update manages to ruin the game even more than the last.
---
I have been saying this from the first minute I looked at the old ammo converter! Testify.
---
😂 This guy likes to gank. Not PvP. Always funny when a gank backfires.
---
Haven’t played since the update yesterday and I already know that the BoS won’t see a single dime from me
---
Just use wall passthroughs from the advanced power connectors set.     
---
Conduits can look real nice in certain builds, if you position them right.
---
All of what i am willing to donate is my Nocturnal Switch blade 
---
Even then that's waaay too much
---
Nope, they removed this. There is a painfull, lomger solution, with the flamethrower trap, or with PvP, but I do not know the proper way. My single doublesided wall is working, but I can not put any new down.
---
Fallout 76 brings great shame to the family.
---
Maybe it has an negativ impact to the pathfinding of npc?
---
People talk about their camp buddies joining them on the adventures through WV., maybe there is a connection?
---
Would be nice to get an explanation why they have fixed it, maybe it could used for other exploits which affect other players? 
---
Yes, it was a cool thing, unfortunately it was a glitch and no feature. Maybe they will give us interior walls some day
---
Thank you for this. You just saved a few atoms for me.
---
I used to love using my chainsaw back when 200% condition gave a buff to it, i used to mow through ghouls at whitesprings. Now it's just junk that weighs alot topped with the fact you still can't display it and the mods for it mean diddly shit because they also don't work.
---
Then there is the .44 revolver with no way to add the bull mod even tho that's advertised on the blue camo picture.
---
They advertised the biv daily with fire berry whisky that wasn't even implemented.
---
The list goes on with forgotten weapons, armor etc... With each new concurring update...its getting to be a joke..a joke that isn't funny anymore.
---
I've petitioned on reddit countless times now on here about the state of forgotten items like the chainsaw and even once got a reply from a dev saying the usual shit " we'll look into it" and it never gets addressed again
---
It’s the only way to make internal walls look right especially if you are using barn or the new blue wooden walls. Having some wallpapered and some exterior just looks wrong. 
---
After this patch you are really just stuck with having to have either no internal walls or rooms, or alternatively have an odd looking building with random wood, metal or brick walls inside. 
---
Not to mention neat cabling now not being viable. 
---
I’m lucky I revamped my camp last week and most of the work is done but I’m now unable to finish off a couple of sections meaning I’m stuck until they reverse the patch.
---
Could have been the case.     
---
I just removed my vending.   I think I'm going to sell or drop whatever was in vending and call it a day with that endeavor.   The 30K limit has been a problem anyway.
---
U could have turned all that steel into railway spikes(not quickly I know), then all them spikes into ammo points and then all them points into .308's and had a week of fun with a explosive lmg. Also u can't give away atlas provisions to low levels. Personally I find it pointless and a bit of an insult.
---
Nah, it's probably me.
---
Why turn in your hard earned mats anyways? screw the BOS. They wouldn't do it for us.
---
I player vend plans and make a lot of caps doing it.  There are certain unsellable plans such as Single Action Ivory Grip or Mole Miner Gauntlet, but most of the common ones can and do sell.
---
40mm is really really good at tagging everything when you glitch the line in the sand event tho
---
It definitely is not worse than the FT bug.  That one....  ugh.
---
Pete Hines - "we didn't quit on Elder Scrolls Online, and we won't quit of Fallout 76 and want to make it something worth while"
---
Well maybe management and the devs should act like it.  Fixing exploits as miniscule as the camp walls and ignoring the numerous bugs that ACTUALLY EFFECT the player bases gameplay does not give that notion.
---
holy shit be a bit more edgy please. if you dont like the game dont play it. good god.
---
I thought so. That explains things ammo "points", perk "coins", all those immersion breaking flashy popups, the silly sounds that comes with the above. Makes it feel like this is a ftp amusement park mobile game and not a Post Nuclear Role Playing Game.
---
Strangler heart?
---
You can't. It's the whole 250 or you get a message saying 'not enough of the required material'.
---
There is a stash box and crafting benches near the donation box.
---
A bug free game.
---
Thats all I want.
---
But sadly our dreams is unlikely to come true.
---
I mean a real ghillie paint
---
THIS!
---
This literally broke the carleton mine and I have no way to complete the Cheating Death quest.
---
Haha take my upvote
---
Christmas
---
No more sleeping for Ward!
---
I server hopped quite a bit tonight and only once did I see anyone at Atlas. A level 400 or so at that.
---
Honestly I’m done too. I officially deleted the game after playing since beta (wtf was I doing?). I too love fallout series more than any other game series but Jesus Christ.. they can’t even fix a damn fast travel bug in the space of a month and half... and on top of that bullshit they can’t even release a public event that everyone’s been waiting for, hey why not just delay the fo1st payments like they delay every single piece of content they create. I thought the devs were improving but this update was terrible, literally everything that was worth while either didn’t come out or got pushed back lmao...
---
Gladly if you take mine too!
---
Thanks for the info.  
---
Not tech savvy at all.  :(
---
Sorry for off topic, but can some of FO1st ol' timers tell how often they offer tent skins? Regular, while useful, is quite bland compared to some I've seen from others.
---
I don't bother with Workbenches, I just have a store/farm camp. I don't bother with having a pit-stop for other player's like myself I just go to a station for that or whitesprings as it's wasting camp budget where material gathering can fill the budget.
---
When the interior camps come this winter..( heh.. Those will be delayed for sure when they supposedly come out watch..) Maybe I'll make a Pit-Stop interior depending on what our budget will be for inside. 
---
But untill then I'm focusing more on resource gathering rather than decoration since we got about a few days at a time to get 100m+ of different materials for Atlas Observatory
---
They used a private test server for wastelanders. Players kept asking for more transparency and for a public test server. The listened to their customers and made a public test server....
---
They do this EVERY single time with the patch notes now.... next update is when they will actually fix it. I swear to god they must have someone that fakes the fixes on purpose
---
More like uncommenting the line that deals with crippling effects. If takes months do that, it explains an awful lot.
---
It is. I always end up with thousands of excess though.
---
No nerf on the uber-abused bloodied build and buff on other useless builds ? Mkay, you really know how to properly balance your games BGS...
---
The have terrible PR and communicates. I’m totally with you. Do you think they are trying to upset people? Lol
---
Not really I didnt play with normal bow most of the time because I got good compound bow I just test my bow and now they are both same you just need to understand how it works
---
Yeah same, was ready to despair. I’m only rank 42 cause I’m Xbox gamepass and started late so trying to get as much done as possible, gotta get that Jangles backpack lol.
---
And if they open up consoles to be modded then that is accessible and can be hacked into the adventure worlds just like it is on pc now. I would hate for that to be a thing. It’s bad enough now
---
Yes, and do you recognize how often the pathfinding in FO4 in "hacked" camps was broken?
---
Almost every time you used the doormat glitch you broke the pathfinding... 
---
Was it cool? Yes, was it Multiplayercapable? No
---
Not everyone is a Exploiter in FO76 so why should the Exploiter gain an advantage (this time a cosmetical) everytime they use a glitch?
---
Your sentiments are spot on however all you are realising now is what people were critcising the game for at launch - an online revenue generation store with a low-cost, low effort buggy game stuck to it to justify a cash grab. This 'groundhog day' buggy approach that characterises its life cycle continues on its trajectory because people continue to heap praise on them, ask for more, pay for subscriptions and continue playing it so they see a continued opportunity to take money - all the upvoted comments in the world aren't going to change their direction of driving players towards spend, only a significantly diminished player base willl get them to sit up and take notice. It's called live service and there are plenty of examples of this practice out there that have all gone the same way. The people behind this are not deaf or blind, their approach is strategic and intentional - they want your engagement not your enjoyment because in the longer term that equals your $ so if something is frustrating you or even driving you crazy in this game then *it's working as intended* because that's the first step in getting you to spend*.*
---
That seems more UI then anything. Right now you go to main screen but just click NW and you are immediately put in a lobby
---
I hear you on that. 
---
Found out today that the loot list for the Atlas Provisions contain items that will never drop because they are still bugged like they were when the Treasure Event was running. So if youre hoping for some of the power armor mod plans you are SOL too.
---
I guess living in a vault doesn't protect you from stds
---
Or you know... comment on the trending posts vs spamming the sub with duplicate posts.
---
I’m disappointed to hear this, I always wanted to give them a go but never got around to it. I love bows in other games. I guess I’ll need to get my fix in Destiny :(
---
the fuck is so hard to draw texture on both sides of wall
---
it was just your turn now. they nerfed pve community, then absolutely destroyed pvp community and now the building community. sometimes i just think they whant us all to stop playing f76 so they dont have to take care of the game no more and concentrate on their others games. its sad
---
They wasn’t in discount for me, and I had Fallout 1st.
---
Oh neat!
---
Bethesda, this is an embarrassment. I am sure there a lot of issues that we do not know about, and I'm sure you are in the coffin getting yelled at by your bosses and then by a vast majority of the player base but this is sloppy and unprofessional. there are still issues from Beta that haven't by fixed? Why? Why is it so hard to fix this game so it can play in a fun, safe manner? What's the reasoning for events to be delayed constantly, and content to keep getting pushed back? It's almost September, there's no way your ready for the BOS Quest or Season 2 if you can't even get the Colossal event fixed after pushing it back 3 times.
---
The break it with the flamer trap  method still works. Same with double sided doors.
---
Don't you use the ammo weigh reduction perks? I just let ammo build until I have a ton on my person and then convert
---
I'm surprised, I'm so used to everyone playing bloodied all the time
---
Agree
---
Same boat bud. Been playing since beta, not only have I stopped my sub for fo1st I’ve temporarily deleted fo76. I honestly need a break. It’s like an abusive relationship lmao.
---
I’m stuck too. Can not enter
---
The Commander has been getting stuck in my interior wall a lot the last week, just trying to walk through it...
---
Which just happens to be the only wall I doubled.
---
Only way to free her was to server hop. Sometimes selecting the wall in build mode worked but not always.
---
Hmm, now you've got me speculating.
---
The items on offer definitely aren't very enticing, they've really dropped the ball... again.
---
This week, we have the rug and the valentine bed for free.
---
And we have the coal dust excavator PA paint for 160 atoms (80% off).
---
So there is a discount, again.
---
How about fixing the BOS fatigues underarmor you broke and turned into an outfit for this steel dawn crap, and giving people that modded it some flux back afterwards, since it got stripped of mods.  Can't these people add anything new without breaking existing things?  This isn't the first time this has happened.  Just pathetic...
---
No way, next season gonna be a plethora of ghillie skins for every power armor, mark my words.
---
It's normal for Bethesda to do some dumb stuff but you never know.  I'm not saying it's an Atomic Shop item, I'm saying they are gonna implement it in soon.
---
Yeah can't wait till they nerf those bloodied builds more.
---
EXACTLY!
---
Because people already use exploits for camp building in 76 that are purely cosmetical, like the double sided wall glitch. As long as it doesn’t affect other people’s gameplay I have no issues with exploiters having funky camps, ideally they’d just be features tho, so people don’t have to exploit.
---
I understand that there are different groups within the development team tasked with varying projects. But there needs to be more adaptive task management.
---
While the double sided wall thing, was a bug it was not one people were bringing up as something that needed to be fixed. If the you remove a work-around you should provide a solution for the issue that required the work-around. This is simple stuff, entry level management knowledge.
---
Bethesda, please focus on bugs that prevent gameplay or ruin enjoyment for the community.
---
I for one will not be doing the atlas mission or any other mission from now on, pathetic Bethesda
---
I can't even put into words for pissed I am they cant be snapped like a wall, especially given how uneven all the terrain is in game. Let alone the Rain water collector only provides dirty water, so you pay literally money for an Atom item that provides the most useless drink in game.
---
Think he vants to sell them TO vendors!
---
Cancelling an Annual subscription means that they cancel it immediately and don't refund the remaining part of the year. They also don't allow you to play the rest of the year if you cancel the renewal before the last month.
---
Isn't this kind of practice illegal?
---
Definitely, I also feel that the Legendary Run was added more so we couldn’t get more free atoms from daily challenges
---
I just hit level 41 and have been prioritizing other perks.
---
It's a melee/Full auto build but I'm no min/maxer and get burned out shortly after hitting 50 so I never play endgame either. 
---
I was just using the Armco to feed the ever hungry handmade for the occasional times I need range. I'm actually up to 4000+ rounds though, now that I'm primarily using a 2* super sledge I lucked into. 
---
I can easily feed her via farming and it'll be easier to just not bother collecting the trash ammo rather than try stockpiling it for meager roi.
---
Your catching on, Bethesda doesn't do random shit no one asked to be "fixed" without a reason.
---
Just look at the random taking away of the scout masks in whitespring bunker as an example, taken away for no fathomable reason to us players at the time but low and behold it occurred not long before the implementation of the vault raids which surprise surprise had a new scout mask you had to grind to get. No one would have got the mask from the event if they could easily buy one from a vendor.
---
Another example was reducing white knight perk, no one again asked for its nerf, armor hardly required fixing with the perk activated as is. After the "fix" armor degredation also seemed to be increased and the new white knight did little to change that... surprise surprise repair kits were introduced in the atom store.
---
I wouldn't be wholey surprised that double sided walls would appear at this point tbh
---
In the midst of everyone complaining about the new events and bug fixes causing more harm than good, and just general shambles, it's stuff like this that makes me happy to be part of the community.
---
My first few hours were pretty brutal too, so now whenever I see a level 1 player in Vault 76, I'll quickly craft a pipe weapon, mod it to be decent, make a set of leather armor, mod that with added defence and Deep Pocketed, and then go wait for them.
---
Then I drop a goodie bag with the gun, some ammo from the absurd collection I have, amthe armor, and some Corn Soup (hunger AND thirst?!), give them a "heart" and then bounce away.
---
It's no big loss to me, but it can mean everything to a first timer.
---
GG, OP.
---
GG. 👍🏻
---
Am I the only the one that had this update delete all saved photos? On xbox
---
Happening to me too on Xbox as well another on PC, don’t know any fix
---
Ha ha ha ha ha they most definitely would not! Not without the genocide of all the other factions at least.
---
Not with a bowling ball launcher it's not.
---
Yeah, he's so desperate to kiss their rear ends that he's just building them a base.
---
Typical came out today mutha  nuka
---
I should note that I also look forward to the day when Bethesda gets around or bothers to fix the Magic Weapons **AND** Legacy Weapons. The "meltdowns" will be glorious because finally that knocks everyone off their throne abusing/taking advantage of those bugs/exploits down to **MY** level.
---
When was this supposed to have happened because I couldn't do this before the update happened
---
That’s coming next month, it’s part of the stairway to hell bundle.
---
They do. The big tire one doesn’t if you place it on the right. But the flat ones absolutely do
---
Agreed
---
Not even surprised tbh
---
And youre 100% sure that this exploit can not affect others playerers experience?
---
What with the colissionmodel, with the pathfinding and many more? 
---
Are you sure this has absolut no impact to other players? 
---
Everyone should build a funky house but not when it has an negative impact on the stability or performance...
---
That’s your opinion. But you can’t ignore the huge community who play this game to build camps
---
Bit with a smaller plan pool, they can't be dropped or displayed and they weigh 10x more.
---
Im on holiday so i cant check, but the leather one has the same problem with a 50 cal equipped. Im sure they didnt check that either.
---
Also didnt see in the notes that the leather floating ghille bug is fixed
---
It broke in the latest patch apparently, so unfortunately gotta wait and see unless another thread has the answer
---
God Bless The Enclave!
---
You might be seeing them nuking Atlas in protest as the mine is rather close...
---
Building was literally the only motivation I still had for logging on. Moved my camp at least once a week because I enjoyed the designing ect.
---
But now...just bought RDR2 on Steam...
---
To be fair I can usually finish all but a few daily challenges just by playing normally for a couple hours and a good portion of the others just take a couple minutes to do things you don't normally do.
---
Wait what? I´m a monthly fallout first member and i had no problem ending my renewal. are you sure that this is right. Do you have any sources.
---
I've been putting them up for 5caps each, they sell pretty well
---
Totally agree with you I started grinding events for the rare plans, I've been unable to work due to my comprised immune system. So have a lot of free time on my hands. So I've been really grinding the events at least 100 a day. Nearly ever day. And this has been for 3 month I've got nothing at all no rare outfits, I've got so many scrip legendaries they are dropping out my pockets. And I can fast travel I regularly drop scrip for players just so I can move. I've 1067 gold bullion tickets I can't trade in. Everything about this game is designed to hurt the player why. The while game need the time gates removing the legendary system needs reworking. The rng needs to be looked at I understand thing need to be rare to keep people playing but there needs to be a reward system where after so many times of doing the same event it auto drops I don't care if it's a 1000 events. I'd rather have. A goal then rng.
---
Hard to argue against all the 'bad' that's come with this patch, BUT ....... at least my Teddy Bears should be safe from scrapping next time I move my CAMP and build something.
---
Well, it is understandable that they cannot be dropped (it prevent dupers), but the other thing is not.
---
not even close
---
https://youtu.be/wu9LOVRW3vY?t=760             
---
This is where the quest has broken for me. i watched this video just to make sure i wasnt missing anything. The only difference in quest logs is mine says enter the mine and tune your radio. I obviously tuned my radio to the frequency, thats how i found the place. When I get to the mine door, its not opened like that guys is. Am I doing anything wrong? Ive finished out the enclave missions and this is where the overseer has brought me. Am I missing something else?
---
So basically no consequences to dying then?
---
What, I have to wait another month for them to release patch 22 to move forward in the game? You've gotta be shitting me
---
For those of us who have been following the data mines for Fallout 76 and have an understanding of Fallout Lore we can tell you that is definitely not happening.
---
When you say "patches", are you taking about the steaming piles of Scorch Beast Guano that Bethesda dumps on us?
---
At this point there are no excuses for Bethesda anymore. If they have no quality assurances, unrealistic deadlines, and shitty management, I don't have any sympathy for them anymore.
---
Totally. I will finish the legendary run since only 20 ranks are missing and then I will take a good break from this game tbh since I played it from day one
---
I think one of those people just crapped out the latest ATX update...
---
get a room you 2
---
Automated testing doesn't work that well in games though usually. But they definetly have no quality assurance team, at least none that is being listened to by the management.
---
Personally I think it's an improvement. Far from being perfect but I can at least trade in useless ammo types at reasonable quantities now. Menu still needs fixing in many ways though. Why didn't they add sliders!?!?!
---
Done a run last night and launched  in under 10mins so still possible.
---
Someone woke up on the gatekeeping side of the bed today
---
AA is better. Great rifle.
---
Two Shot is not double damage as you would think, and accuracy decreased with it.
---
&gt; Even if we made floating towers, how is that harming them
---
I started playing in May of 2019 and got hooked. 
---
Bought my friend a copy so he could join me and he initially really liked it but a week later he stopped logging in. 
---
I asked why and his response was, to much immersion breaking for him to properly get sucked in.
---
I asked what he meant. 
---
He replied, as far as he knew there was no anti-grac tech in the apocalyptic wasteland yet everywhere he looked he saw floating buildings and stairs leading into infinity. 
---
Just took him right out, reminded him he was playing a game and that in turn caused him to not enjoy playing. 
---
He never came back and I have to suspect he wasn't alone. 
---
I was initially turned off by them as well, but I'm a 'world builder' and it was easy enough to handwave away with my own head canon. 
---
I mean hell, in my head canon the pipboy is a far more magnificent piece of machinery. It houses miniaturization tech that shrinks anything I want to carry down to a manageable size, so I can carry 16 missile launchers and assorted goodies without hassle. It also has teleportation tech. Whenever I go to a new area the pip automatically marks it with a tracker that allows for instant teleportation back to that location! Living in a wasteland is hard, but the pipboy makes it just a bit better. ;p
---
So explaining floating buildings wasn't hard for me, Zetan tech is lying around after all.
---
But for him, and I'm sure others, it was a deal breaker. 
---
This concludes my anecdote.
---
I’ll donate enough for one reward in case they try to pull the “only people who donated will get reward” when we don’t hit milestone
---
There's still a chance you won't retrieve the loot bag, nor someone else.
---
Ammo converter got worse ? Sure buddy. How about knock it off with the hyperbole
---
Not even a little but they're gonna lose the last of the die hard fan soon
---
It was mentioned during my sign-up. I'll try to find the toc text. 
---
Are you still able to access your fallout 1st items after confirmation of cancellation?
---
This was the one damn thing I was happy to see they added in the patch notes , and it's not even there.  Super annoyed! This patch was absolute shit along with ruining walls in CAMPS not being able to switch from doorways to walls in build mode!!!
---
I think it was a whole mix of things. Increasing repair costs, lowering the effectiveness of white knight/gunsmith/etc, pushing out repair kits. May not have all been in one update but I know all of it happened very close to each other. I recall they did raise the durability of some weapons before, not sure if they ever decreased it
---
How is this trash game still alive lol
---
The process of "launching" it  
---
[https://imgur.com/a/JmxECgx](https://imgur.com/a/JmxECgx)
---
Superwierd, im just met with intercection errors as soon as they get even close to being edge to edge in a straight line
---
Here's the reward table: 
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W0nsHf67V3_ke0RLgsIMwPb8kpI0kLgfX_0_bZPTTs/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;pru=AAABc98iQy0*OyiRUOom4oJdRKb43dnQww
---
And new console players are busy with the main quest line to notice this event and have very little steel anyway.
---
I think we will get about twelve vanilla, boring NPC who walk around doing silly shit and despite the quest level you're at or the reputation you have, they'll treat you with same indifference as day one.
---
That isn't no consequences to dying, but to stop assholes stealing junk during events.
---
Just like the holiday gift boxes, from my experience. Radaway, stims, alco, plans, caps (up to 600 was my max from one), etc. I, personally, didnt see anything new in the plans I got and I opened around 150 of them.
---
Meat week will come regardless of the Atlas event on August 18th. The meat week event that's a reward for the Atlas event is a (optional) second go at it a few weeks later.
---
I'm also a melee build. I had this happen once the other day as soon as I launched the game and was dropped in at my camp. A quick reboot solved it.
---
Yes, I have the scrap box but cant add anything to it. All outfits are still craftable
---
I agree with what your saying..it is funny to see people talking about the legacy's they have that are not duped but oddly have the same legendary prefixes..But you do see some gems at times
---
Those "consultants" would be a quality assurance team. This is pretty much common practices in this industry. I'm 100% sure that Bethesda does not employ a quality assurance team for fo76 or they're just not being listened to due to deadlines or whatever.
---
It’s not hurting anyone is it?
---
Disappointment and regret
---
You dont drop loot when you die in an event.
---
Not really a simple new event...  
---
At least not just take a photo, or a gimme scrap one.  
---
but still... yeah... this is not promissing for a high end content roadmap
---
But really, that sounds like illegal. If you paid for a year you should get a year no matter when you cancel the renewal. And what do you mean by not allowing you to play the rest of the year? Like they ban your account? that doesn't sound right.
---
Dont donate. It’s a waste of steel.
---
All he said is correct, and I’m fairly certain TS will do more damage, however your chances of doing less damage per shot at **almost** any distance just increased by about 50%. TS is wonky when it comes to accuracy. But up close and personal TS is good. So if youre doing a lot of CQB, *personally*, Id rock TS. If youre doing literally any range - AA. (But regardless what you choose, you have to admit that TS is kinda fun)
---
I'd be happy with "Bethesda miiiiight want to think", let alone adding "about this".
---
Here is a progress bar 
---
[https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events)
---
however it has not been updated.
---
Well, you got me there!
---
If it's anything like other events the Bethesda website will publish a new number once a day, not including the weekends, to show current progress.
---
As long as we know. Do you think they gonna show bad numbers?
---
First game I preorded. Obviosuly last one
---
Try renaming/deleting your fallout76.ini and fallout76prefs.ini in /MyGames/Fallout76 so the game has to create new files. 
---
And try running without Bethesda launcher, directly over fallout76.exe
---
Loot table was datamined. It’s a disappointment to say the least.
---
Starched genes?
---
I love the smell of steel burnt in atomic fire.
---
Cyberpunk is a singleplayer game. It doesn't last nearly as long as FO76 does, so I don't think they're too concerned about this.
---
People said the same thing before Borderlands 3 was released as well.
---
It's not a false equivalency. Fallout 76 will have been out two years by the time Cyberpunk gets released -- are you seriously saying that there's something this game could do which would make you decided not to buy and play Cyberpunk 2077?  Fallout 76 could come around to my apartment and cook me dinner and walk the dogs and I'd still be buying Cyberpunk.
---
Hi. Cultist blade drops in the game. I just got a 3 star one.
---
Not true, at least not every time. I've had many occasions when I dropped loot during events and got my junk stolen.
---
Shafted!
---
It kinda worked. More than nothing.
---
it should be ingame.. under the reputation tab at least
---
Different playstyles? You mean Bloodied or heavy gunner PA?
---
I actually totally believe you.
---
Maybe open your eyes and actually read it all.
---
The new update changed around loot pools. Whether on purpose or on accident, it seems they may have reintroduced some of the lost items
---
Honestly took me a while to find it too, and it should be somewhere in-game. You're welcome :)
---
You ain't wrong. But after putting 1600 hours in... I feel like I can't just give up XD
---
It should be 7600 atoms. One atom per hour of suffering in this endless un-content of features.
---
When I login I'm greeted to the thunderous sounds of turrets unloading on Dr. Hale like the nazi guns on the beaches of Normandy.
---
Proof that the Brotherhood of Steel has never NOT struggled trying to do something.
---
"Hey, what's that metal clunky and hydraulic noise?! Oh, just this weird big moving bush - must have been the wind"
---
I've donated about 1k already, didn't get anything. What am I looking for?
---
thank you will try now
---
Cant see why you wouldnt just play both... considering ones an RPG and the other a MMO
---
Because they didn't fix anything, just changed some values in a 5 min smoking break.
---
Worst, no. Imo very close though.
---
This update probably has the least amount of playable content. Highly disappointed. 
---
The BoS event is a joke for veterans. We already have all of those plans. I have 15,000 metal, I only donated 250 metal , just so i can say I participated. I am not wasting any more of my materials. Good luck getting millions.
---
Yep, today, a day after their latest patch. Immediately took me over 5 attempts to fast travel. So much fun too when it counts down from 15 to 1 second before cancelling.
---
This shit has been in the game for months. Bugs are being constantly introduced and left in the game for weeks at a time, while they employ mobile tactics to get you playing every day with this shit going on.
---
Yet we dont see spammed posts and outrage about this. Something that is damn well justified to be called out on.
---
I think all updates are the worst updates yet. Every single one had to be fixed afterwards, so kek.
---
My camp, my rules.
---
Actually my shower is at the side of an open air crafting area, easily accessible, hard to use accidentally. And there's always Starched Genes, you'll clean your rads but maintain the mutations. 
---
But I still retain the right tuse rule #1 if I rebuild.
---
Make pvp vats great again
---
Looks like its supposed to update here, https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events
---
But isnt updated yet.
---
Please, look at recent posts before making a duplicate.
---
Here goes, me repeating myself, [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events) there is a progress bar but we will only see progress when Bethesda decide to update it
---
my question is how did the update size change so drastically over the course of 2-3 hours
---
Ok so i found and deleted fallout76.ini , but couldnt find the second file, i launched anyway, directly trough the folder but same thing happened, any idea?
---
What discussion?
---
‘This bug happened.’
---
*’We know.’*
---
Engaging discussion, truly.
---
Yea, it's called the whole game
---
That’s just silly. The community should be making sure that our friend doesn’t lose their mutation. /s
---
As an Avid camp builder i can support this. All my entrances have two entrances marked by  Ghouls (No rad shower) and humans (Rad shower), one with a on and off switch or somewhere else in my build.  
---
But then Dear OP, can i count on your support in protesting the tone deaf bug "fix" that has crippled the building community?
---
You won’t get anything good. Look: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i3o7ar/fortifying_atlas_donors_provisions_drop_list_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
I still have my 6 artillery cannons
---
What do you expect. Bethesda has set a new low and players accept this as the new norm.
---
Yeah im not saying I disagree but starched genes is made specifically for that.
---
As much as I’m suspicious of anything like a progress bar, I do realize currently it has to be manually updated, given its Bethesda.
---
I thought that was just my console choking on the legendary screen.  Well glad I ain't suffering alone XD
---
Changed WHAT? There wasn't anything wrong with your post I was just adding
---
Yeah it’s getting pretty bad even on Xbox. Everyone and their brother has now legacy weapons even when they just started playing.
---
Same thing will happen to shotguns, feel free to quote me, and it's not like they're op right now, just viable..but seeing how lazy these devs are (honestly, been gaming for some time..got to be THE laziest I've seen, covid aside) with the way the balance things.. well.. it's a guarantee.
---
This is not true, canceling a yearly sub should get you the remaining time, just like the monthly sub. Their frequently asked question specifically says that is the practice.
---
Be a hero, get it for us all xD
---
In which folder did you find/delete the file? The one in your installation folder (program files/Bethesda.net launcher/games/fallout76) is the wrong, you have to look in "user"/MyGames/Fallout76 if I remember correctly.
---
Not at home right now to look the exactly path
---
It won't fail even if goals aren't met.
---
What the hell......Bethesda....🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦
---
Even if i have 30k steel and have no use for it?
---
Save your scrap bud - it's way too much gear for a beret and a fairly half baked pre-story.
---
I was looking forward to getting these as I have a seriously bad case of shitty inventory management. Another disappointment. I am not even surprised, and that's just sad, we're used to being letdown in every corner.
---
Thank you for the input, i do reboot the game every time it happened, it helps for a while.
---
The issue appeared two days aggo, did not expirience the issue before that.
---
How strange I’ve been going through all my challenges that are close to completion and mine also says I haven’t killed the queen - which at level 215 is a laughable suggestion
---
Thank you for that. Like others have said it should be somewhere in game. TBH its placement just adds weight to my theory that our contributions arent going to matter at all because it will complete regardless even if its by Bethesdas intervention
---
I think that’s only during public events.
---
Man we are just trying to get it the recognition. So many people don't like this change and it is pretty weird. Does it bother you to see this?
---
Enough booze to keep Becket happy
---
Think so too
---
och nevermind, they didnt even add the ss armor mods, my bad
---
Not going to happen, why would they fix walls to be double sided for free when they can monitise it and get players to pay for the privilege.
---
Not saying it's good business practice to shaft it's playerbase but it seems that is all Bethesda cares about atm, give a little bit but expect big returns
---
I swear Bethesda only wants us to make tiny box camps as there isn't that much flat space to build in as it is, foundations need to be made longer so we can build on the hilly terrain.
---
Ok so they patch building glitches that harm no one but don't  fix the bugs that allow cheating,  griefing and ruin the dam thing for everyone?
---
Yeah I’ve run into it before but most recently has anyone ran into the full health but dead enemies? They don’t attack or die but just stand there. If you take down their health, it just fills back up 🤷🏾‍♂️ ran into a mirelurk queen like that just day.
---
Actually I do think it is better. The trick is to hit the back button ("b" on Xbox) after conversation and then you'll go back to the screen you were on with the same option selected. Although definitely not perfect, I was able to convert all my unwanted ammo for 7000 .50 cal in about 5 minutes. Whereas previously I spent about a half hour getting 2000 and giving up. So, improvement but yes - it could be better. Also wish it was connected to your stash and displayed the total amount of ammo you have available with regard to each option, or better yet just a bulk conversation based on what you have available. But, it's better than nothing.
---
Dang I thought it was gonna be BOS Plans like for outfits already in the game and BOS Paints.
---
That why I have my shower on a side next the vendor machines (for easy location) and connected to a switch, whoever needs it just have to click the switch and use the shower while it doesn't annoys other players.
---

---
Got to respectfully disagree with you, Wada\_tah, on the "Check back and forth" bit: I actually have very little idea how much of any given ammo I don't use I have. I know that I keep my three main types (.45, Shotgun, and 2mm EC) between 1000-2000 each, but the random .38 I pick up? I thought yesterday that I had about 200 -- turned out to be twice that. I like the 10x and 100x options, but really wish they had kept the "only see what you have available to sell" clause in. Or show how much you have on the converter interface. The random groupings are...an odd choice too: 18 .38, but 24 10mm and 12 .308, and 15 .45? Not sure why they chose those arbitrary numbers: last I checked, 10mm, .308, and .45 come in 20-50 round boxes IRL. I don't know, Beth...
---
...... My friend you are a gentle soul.
---
Extremely common knowledge but God bless!!! :)
---
This is it. And fuck those people who blame others and not the system. The system makes the necessity.
---
If you join in, and help the CAMP builder guys get the devs to change it, people will stop talking about it.
---
Oh thats good to know, gonna be on the look out for all the drop junked from the dead newbs during events
---
Yeah, and I'll miss it as an underarmor. Don't think it will be back from the twilight zone of outfits. hope I am wrong.
---
In the bethesda launcher i clicked on "Game options" and then pressed "Show in folder"
---
I have been waiting for them to fix the vats bug so I can use bows... Guess I should have known things would go in the opposite direction, meh.
---
My google-fu sucks apparently :)
---
Still a bit annoying to lose all your rads if you're playing bloodied.
---
Last year they fixed a lightbulb at the high school.  Game was nearly unplayable before they implemented that one.
---
Right????? My PS4 server was the most dead I've ever seen--three CAMPS on map and maybe seven or so players roaming.
---
Congrats Beth on the inspiring effort.
---
Meanwhile, something as simple as the Excavator promo poster in the BASE GAME as a camp item would be more worth chasing than all the shit they posted including the beret.
---
thank you, sorry, I did not notice it from quick search of Atlas. My bad.
---
Because sooner or later those lunchboxes will end up in the Atomic Shop convenience section, you'll see.
---
Yeah for sure. I leave my shower outside. Having it in the entrance is a bit silly
---
I dont want to have to use a "cheat" "glitch" or whatever to do something that should be in the game in the 1st place.
---
I agree, i'm mostly curious on the progress. Found the link
---
All good but thanks for the effort!!
---
Yup, mainly happens to ghouls or scorched for me.
---
Works as intended, cause I dont want to have my camp advertise as vendor, when Im near max Caps and I have removed power and locked the vendors with walls (as extra precaution, cause you can still buy from them unpowered).
---
Clearly someone didn't read
---
Like someone above said, having one that switches on and off is probably the best option
---
https://media.tenor.com/images/1a38abb93c9418390a8c93e474a75149/tenor.gif
---
And they will be limited time for 24 hours only. Quick! Quick everyone, buy it now or else!
---
you get a small reward every time you donate, check your inventory.
---
Besides all this instead of having any new and themed rewards for the donations, we get the same trash we’ve had from Christmas again.
---
They don't have much, doesn't mean almost anything to you and you're just doing a bad thing...
---
Don't apologize. Sorry if I came across as rude, it wasn't my intention at all. Was more like a friendly suggestion that I worded incorrectly :)
---
There are still MULTIPLE bugs with the screaming Eagle Handmade skin
---
It would be problematic to show this in the game, since the goal is cross-platform, the game itself is not.
---
Totally fine. Keeps the durability of our armor nice and full with all that insta dying.
---
I just bought the game, is this gonna affect me in any way at all?
---
Dont want to sound like a dick here but have you not followed the recent events and updates ??? 
---
Smiler selling 300 gold for 6k caps was most likely a swing at getting our caps 
---
Mole miner pails where used to drain our initial presents and caps 
---
Daily and weekly atoms swapped out for the low amount we get now means more people paying cash instead of earning  
---
This event plus the fact we S.C.O.R.E challenges nearly every other day to use up some of that "duped" junk.... I'm pretty sure weve had similar occurrences recently too for other things
---
&gt;Yes, this does limit floating camps
---
The scrap box is a monthly sub not a one off atom payment......
---
Ok thanks, perhaps there is a discrepancy in the toc text on the sign up. I remember reading it twice and thinking it's not very friendly. There's also the possibility that I had a brain fart at the time.
---
And again, someone tries to compare a single player game to an mmo... why?
---
Fixer or handmade ghillie paints ?
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Nji1wR3q5hoHOKwKQWnK5p1qhtub7O64XPGZxeimpI/edit#gid=0
---
Well, People should build the way they want. Even if it means inconvenience for other players.
---
But i Will say that you might loose a lot of costumers and visitors if you forse us to go through a decontamination shower. Also starched genes exists.
---
I didn't know actjon boy was bugged. What a shame. The simplest of fixes, things people actually want and they do this shit instead.
---
Oh dude hell to the yes for that
---
And afterwards you should get a discount in the bundle.
---
They are all duped, unless you got a drop in the first months!
---
They also lie on the patch notes, as there are multiple lies on 21.
---
I think u both make very good points.
---
If ur playing cyberpunk and its as incredible as it looks, how likely are u to jump on fallout to get 150 script, 200 gold, put wood in a box, or whatever other shit they got going on that week.
---
I didnt play fallout 76 for a few months while I was enjoying the outer worlds. Old fashioned bug-free fun.I 
---
There will always be the hard-core fans that would still play if it only ran at 10 frames a second and tell u that all the bugs in the game are ur problem.
---
Just take a break. You need it
---
Far Harbor is top quality DLC. I'm afraid it's the last good DLC the Fallout franchise will ever get. Seems that we're stuck to  atomic shop skins and community challenges
---
I'd love to know how many staff are still on the project. Real talk I wish there was a present day documentary from Bethesda from their side seeing who is doing what.
---
Yeah same here , don't get me wrong once the update finished it was around 9pm UK time so that would probably cause a dip in players
---
I would now its super easy to join a team now.
---
Thank you so much!
---
Yes I usually play solo and now with the public teams you can still earn the bonuses of being in a group while not having to be in an actual group
---
Another lie from Bethesda
---
All junk is good junk
---
I donated 8K of steel, only notable reward was 5 plans, all common. There was only one I didn't know already (revolver part)  Time seems better spent elsewhere.
---
Temporary solution: Build up a wall, destroy it with a flamethrower trap, build another wall behind the first wall and repair the destroyed wall then. 
---
https://youtu.be/dtOQTR1VeK0
---
Yup, any day now "interior wall plans" gonna come out in a bundle for JUST over the low tier atom purchase cost.
---
Even the community awards are trash, Bethesda made zero effort in this event so I'll make zero effort donating materials.
---
The problem is veterans already have all of the rewards these events give.  So the people with the most scrap have no interest in participating. 
---
 I have thousands of steel I will never use but I refuse to donate more than the 250 i did. 
---
 Had they slipped in a few Camp plans that I don't have or anything that I don't have I would be quite fine donating my steel.
---
Highly disappointed with this event.
---
What’s wrong with wrapped cap? I know hooded rags are garbage
---
At this rate patch 21 was a joke ..
---
Let’s hope for patch 21.5 to fixes the joke rewards &amp; add Colossal Problem event
---
Sorry, I meant that you lose the rest of the year's fallout 1st benefits
---
I really don't know where the launcher takes you there 🤔
---
But I know when you can't find the fallout76prefs.ini, you're probably in the wrong folder
---
I don’t know what to say about it. 
---
A dressed up turd is still going to be a turd.
---
This is why I love this community, the things I can't figure out, have typically already been discussed!
---
Odd that they wouldn't include something in game like they did faction reputation.
---
I just donated this morning, yet the tracker shows 0, I wonder how frequent it updates.
---
Lel. Busteeled.
---
Many people cancelled their Planet Fitness memberships when PF announced their new mask policy. And guess what? A week later, PF has "revised their mask policy," and now they're sending emails to members who cancelled asking them to come back.
---
Some actions *do* have an impact.
---
And unopened. They couldn't figure out how to open the can.
---
The thing is my game is installed on the Hard disc and the launcher is on the SSD, so i cant find the game in user
---
Who knows really? Wouldn't put it past Bethesda to bait and switch. I did not read the sign up toc, but did read all the info PRIOR to buying the years 1st and the promises they made. Now I have to question this since I'm a recent purchaser(less than a month) and still could do a credit card charge back.
---
Just win the lottery with modules. Oof
---
Making bulks will, actually, help you with the "Gather building supplies" faster than anything else.
---
I’ve put in a lot of solo hours into the game and had a real good time but without friends some content isn’t really doable (some events that the community doesn’t do but I think that’s it) you can still enjoy the game but it does feel kinda empty without someone at your side, the games community is great needless to say. Obviously it would be better with a friend if you pick up the game maybe drag a friend in with a free weekend.
---
Oh yeah, I meat the rewards I got were just junk, radaway booze caps that sorta thing, what am I keeping an eye open for
---
I think i know what i'm doing with 2000+ hours in game. But thx :)
---
I tried 3 different public servers, no more than 3 camps each, maybe a half dozen players. No public teams to be found, no one joining the ones I started, No one running events at all...High level players nowhere to be found.  A ghost town. This was on Xbox.
---
I went back to my private server &amp; honestly just got fed up with Legendary Run BS &amp; just quit playing...I wasn't enjoying myself at all, none of my friends were playing, why was I wasting my time?
---
Good job Bethesda!!!
---
Idk, I’m still waiting to see ESVI before I judge the game.
---
Junksnatcher sounds like a raider name. Don't listen to raider scum people. They are scared the BoS will stop them from raiding and pillaging in Appalachia. He wants to snatch your junk, the BoS is asking.
---
Your wife's issue is a steam issue that affects many games not just fallout
---
Yeah it does look nice inside.
---
At this point THIS is just not good enough. At this point, unless they make this like Fo4 build system I don't think they are gonna win back builders with inside walls that will likely cost atoms.
---
Nuke ATLAS!!!
---
good luck. if you're loud enough, they *might* fix it in 6 weeks when the next patch comes.
---
I agree with what you are saying... it should be like cooking or any other crafting: press a button and it will eliminate any invalid choices. A convert-all and slider is missing from the other crafting menus so it's hard to expect that would be implemented here. Check back and forth.... if you have 150-2000 of 20 different ammo types it would be faster to go through each type starting with the 100x than moving in and out of the converter menu to check for for each.
---
But to point, OP said "even worse than before". It's not broken, it just sucks. But with the new multipliers it sucks objectively less, was what I was trying to get across.
---
Oh so it's the same as all the presents expect for the toys and coal?
---
What does path finding in my CAMP have to do with you? I highly doubt that this engine melts over that. And what are those many more you are talking about?  Are you 100% sure that it does affect other players? What if Bethesda was able to figure out a way to allow more freedom?
---
The game isn't giving us that choice, it's not allowing us to progress the questline.
---
Weapon and armor plans.
---
wait, these are in the patch notes though. are they not in the game??
---
I donated some steel (2 donations) just to check: alcool, some caps, floaters and frag granades, mats... no plans (never expected a beret). Well... nobody should feel very motivated by this, even though the donation was small. Same tour: all legendary goals visually autocompleted, but after a little casual play the legendary bar was going up again, if I was not winded in repetitive actions I would never had know.
---
It in no way was an exploit, and it had 0 effect on stability or camp performance. I can say that without question. I have a 300% build mega mansion and havent seen any stability issues at all.
---
Ok i made screenshots of the directory where bethesda launcher takes me  
---
[https://imgur.com/a/q2KYxXr](https://imgur.com/a/q2KYxXr)
---
I thought it was gonna be actual new stuff, like BOS weapon skins or something. It's the same generic lootbox stuff we get from the miner pails and the presents
---
Oh yes! Finally someone with the guts to help! 😂😂😂
---
They fix shit we can benefit from like their families are being held hostage by fucking ISIS or something and unless it’s fixed within a certain amount of time they’ll get decapitated but when it comes to stuff that harms the player, then Bethesda will ignore it like my dad ignores me.
---
They are given for completing stages of the event I believe.
---
I started The Order 1886. Damn is it some awesome eye candy. So far I like it.i have a long list of games to catch up on. Some bug name titles and old school games as well. I also play SWTOR and FFXIV, need to catch up on their latest expansions too.
---
Fantastic...just stored mine because I wanted to display my last non duplicate bobble and because of budget.
---
I want that hunter's hood so bad T\_\_\_\_T
---
My 1500 steel I donated would of have been better used making over 6.5 of 50 cal ammo that I use rather than trash I just drop on the ground.
---
It's the only way to get Bethesdas attention
---
I already am not going to be an early adopter of any more of their games because of how they handled this one.
---
Bethesda and Bioware are on my wary, hold off and see the reviews list.  Companies need to realize that their future sales is extremely dependent on their present performance.
---
You are tho, at least by european laws if a service like steam closes they have to provide you a way to download all your owned items with no drm on them
---
Well here's my take, I've been a fallout fan for years, bought 76 on launch 
---
I was a loyal player from day 1, paid for stuff with the promise of later improvements but after they charged for private world's and stash space, you can see exactly what Bethesda want to do with this game. 
---
Squeeze every penny and treat gamers like oranges, This game is completely burned me out in terms of fallout. 
---
Even the wastelanders update came across as desperate and overfilled with pointless none sensical and cringeworthy dialogue. 
---
Everyone talks like the war was 100 years ago when it has barely been a generation since it happened. People use words like super mutants, use caps as automatic currency without any question or explained reason, factions make bizarre decisions to fit into the "lore" (which feels like fan fic than lore) its overly long and dragged out to make the game feel more complete. It's easy to see right through 
---
The reused assets from Fallout 4 ruin the visual design since everything looks older than it should be. The amount of debris was explainable in Fallout 4 because of time but it just makes 76 feel wrong. I used to think legendaries where guns animals have either eaten or found so it made sense to find certain ones, whereas there was no thought about consistency to 76. Every NPC can drop one without a reason to have it. 
---
I had to stop playing not out of choice but out of pure principle and this community should actually put its money where its mouth is and stop giving Bethesda the benefit of the doubt. It's been years since launch and it's barely improved in terms of bugs and general vision for the game. I can't believe how badly they fucked us all over with this game
---
Bethesda are actually charging us for features that where in Fallout 4 and everyone just laps it up and feeds Bethesda money. We are part of the problem and until we actually stop playing Fallout: RNG Simulator nothing will improve.
---
I hate that I sound so toxic but I really don't feel I am to blame about this
---
&gt;  You had such a GREAT opportunity here to get the community involved in  pitching together to help support the new faction coming to 76, and in  return for donating an obnoxiously large amount of our precious scrap,  
---
Scrap steel is piss easy to get. 250 can be gotten in like 5 minutes if you really gave a shit about getting it.
---
Scrapper perk, then scrap weapons and armor
---
Unfortunately so far based on post I read in the last 12 hours it seems that Patch 21 broke an Ounce of Prevention quest for that single change to that quest they made and it broke some instance quest areas this includes Cheating Death and From Russian with Lev.
---
You can either hope for Bethesda to push for a hot fix in the next couple of days or your looking at at waiting 4-6 weeks from now when they release patch 22 in September.
---
Seeing how they never listen to us anyways the only thing its gonna do is clutter up peoples dashes
---
So when it gets to cork(for whatever the BOS need massive amounts of cork for)we'll get better stuff?
---
I just want this to happen. Isn't it a community event? Fuck them if we fail XD
---
you dont have to give up, just poke your head in from time to time. i play the latest update till i find myself complaining in this subreddit, and go play something else until the next update. hell, im currently reconnecting with fo4 rn.
---
I wonder if it had something to do with the load it creates on the server to have two objects like the in constant collision with each other.
---
Get a refund. XDD
---
Crap and booze
---
More like Tiny Little Small Notverywellhandmade Holiday Gifts.
---
Boring
---
im over it, man. I got myself to rank 80 and have enough atoms to rank the rest of the way. i'm not doing this freemium bullshit anymore of having to log in every day. they take a month+ to release patches, and then the majority of the fixes end up being shit that they broke with the last patch, or new "content" that was introduced broken with the last patch being fixed. the two major things they added this patch are an effort to collect duper's junk disguised as an event, and the Wendigo Colossus event which, despite months of testing and delays, *still* isn't ready or available. seriously do they have more than 2 people working on this game?
---
Nuke ATLAS.
---
I had no idea that farming strategy was a thing. I would just show up and play the event like your supposed to.
---
That's the installation folder and therefore the wrong one.
---
The standard would be, when Windows is installed on C: and you didn't move your MyDocuments folder:
---
C:\users\"your username"\MyGames\Fallout76\
---
That's where your config files and photo mode pictures are saved
---
How is it a broken promise? Do you want them to release sub par content or delay and fix it?
---
As soon as I jumped on I immediately donated 250 steel twice after the second one I thought to myself yep we’re gonna fail this challenge. No body is going to donate anything for these rewards!
---
If you can get a good Plasma Rifle, slap a flamer barrel and than a pulse capacitor, in that order and have fun.
---
What do you mean about the lore? He operated in Appalachia for a bit then returned back to California. Who’s to say he won’t come back?
---
Sorry, I didn't mean to offend the turd lovers
---
That would be Patch 22. Or, like I believe, the new currency will come with expeditions in Patch 24.
---
Especially if you have fallout 1st. If you don't, then it makes sense to donate to make the junk worth something
---
Yes, specifically with strange in numbers as well. I haven’t had a chance to test it out fully, but I did notice the same issue.
---
The initial ammo converter was slow but it did exactly what you wanted it to do...show you what ammo you could convert by only giving you the option to select ammo you actually had.
---
All that was needed to 'fix' it was an easier and quicker way to mass convert unwanted ammo. Playing a game should not involve spending excess time on either checking ammo amounts and taking note before entering the terminal to convert them. Nor should you need to go through every heading and subheading to find ammo you CAN convert in an amount you CAN convert if you didn't check your ammo initially.
---
Awesome
---
I don't know, all I can say is they're not having any of my screws.
---
New version of Smiley! Doesn't remember you.
---
Yeah i carry 30 or 40 heavies around and the favorite menu s a real mess
---
It's not always raw head count - when company gets bigger and not improve/change processes over time everything slows down to a crawl...  Closest example is World Of Tanks - the company have hundreds of devs working on a game and the rate of new content and fixes is quite low (it takes years to balance few vehicles for example).
---
I've seen people build houses and bases at workshops for some reason.
---
Are you talking about the small dishes or the really big one? I'm referring to the really big one closest to Alpha Silo.
---
So....  don't point out that we are dissatisfied?
---
I donated 250 of my 15,000 steel that I have.
---
 I refuse to donate any more because I already have every "rare" plan that are in the rewards.
---
 I wasn't trying to make a "stand" against Bethesda,  I just refuse to do work with no reward.
---
I wonder how many times I've seen "Fallout Killer" banded around in the last 2 years?
---
Even more ridiculous when it being compared to linear, single player, offline games. 
---
Don't like it, don't play it...its that simple.
---
I don't have a bloodied lever yet but I'm also using a bloodied railway rifle. It does quite a lot of damages while firing faster with more ammo in the magazine so I usually switch for it when there's a swarm of though enemies. Only downside is that there's no silencer for it.
---
Right lol, I’ve had that mask since almost release. Cool that they’re bringing back some og stuff that only day 1 players will remember.
---
I run a blue ridge caravan outpost. Its kinda perfect. The fellas run shit under the mountain and i have a checkpoint up top.
---
At this point, fallout 76 is basically a f2p game in every way except the price. It has mtx, the content is time hated and there is even a subscription pass.
---
&gt;Not getting exclusive plans/rewards for parting with my cork,
---
How the fuck can you be putting cork in yet when that doesn't start until Aug 11th?
---
Returning player?  
---
Server hopping has been different for a while now, to prevent it being used to farm the same spots. Containers replenish after you loot another 60 containers. World loot requires you to pick up 180 world loot items. Some people say that it is actually 255 of either, and that they are on the same counter. This includes looting even a single item from a container or power armor chassis.
---
The correct welcoming party! Did the exact same to the raiders but the assholes just wore radiation suits and carried about their daily business.
---
We can't do anything about it.
---
The community event progression is not transparent, only Bethesda has the data and they manually upgrade the bar.
---
They could have zero contributions and still mark every last challenge as complete, and nobody could prove the progress was manipulated.
---
The same thing happened with Clean Appalachia last year.
---
ok, thx a lot, found them, deleted them, now gonna try to launch and will report bakc :)
---
I’m broke, so I can’t afford to get a lawyer, attorney or anything like that I’m afraid or I’d have done it a long time ago.
---
Wait till they are all there.
---
I think it's neat (the area growing over time during the phases of the event) but the rewards really aren't worth farming steel for. I don't need alcohol and I already have 600 stimpacks.
---
U can take any auto rifle and turn it into a riflemen build so get a B HM or fixer with performing magazine
---
That's not very helpful, where do you get the weapons from? I can prob do 2 westech runs in 20 min if I learn the layout a bit. That wil be nowhere near 10k steel. I always use scraper. Or do mean you horde enough weapons and it takes you 20 min to scrap all of it for 10k steel.
---
Not going to donate because i have the plans etc.. and dont need any alcohol.
---
The only reason i was going to donate was to get a package to display at my camp but found out you can't even do that.
---
what's especially fucked is that it is going to be another month to six weeks before we get patch 22 and, like this patch, the majority of it is just going to be fixing all of the shit that they broke with the previous patch. we're just stuck in this perpetual chain of them making new issues while trying to fix old ones while at the same time getting dick for content. the biggest part of this patch is an event they've been working on for *months* and it's *still* not ready. they're fucking clueless.
---
It's not the same, at all. Picture yourself trying to make a 2 or 3 stories building with paper in both sides. Yes, you can make a little cabin with that, but for most of the usual builders it's like changing our round wheels to square wheels. And that is if you are not counting the "pass the wire through a door and change the wall to a complete one" little trick...
---
There's a huge list of grievances that being one of them. Was reason enough for me to not donate too.
---
It's just the fact that in 4 days the community could force them to listen if we purposely failed the steel donation.
---
YES HOLY FUCK THANK YOU!, it finally works, the answer which is on no forum or reddit post, thank you a lot, you are better at explaining things and have better response time then bethesda support, thx a lot dude
---
Oh, building took a major step back from Fallout 4, there are far too many rules and restrictions now, greatly limiting creativity, which was what made building fun.
---
That shouldn't matter. Your lawsuit is so slam dunk you should be able to get a massive payout from Bethesda and pay your lawyer loads of money and keep some for yourself as well.
---
Yes. A legacy gattling plasma dose a full 100% explosion damage multiplied by 5 with the splitter on it
---
As a rifleman I used a lever, handmade, and fixer.
---
25 rounds a clip is nothing to sneeze at, they can be silenced, and are easily made to be automatic if you wanted to switch up.
---
Bloodied pipe revolver rifle, benefits still from rifleman and pistol perks
---
The one where they increased repair cost and introduced repair kits, I think they also reduced durability around the same time, not sure on this part though. Or maybe the great shotgun nerfing.
---
When my camp is Vendor, sure
---
But if my camp isn’t a vendor, then all rules are off, there’s nothing inside my house for you anyway
---
As I said in other post about the flamethrower trick:  \*It's not the same, at all. Picture yourself trying to make a 2 or 3 stories building with paper in both sides. Yes, you can make a little cabin with that, but for most of the usual builders it's like changing our round wheels to square wheels. And that is if you are not counting the "pass the wire through a door and change the wall to a complete one" little trick... \*  
---
Saludos, tigre.
---
So have us gauss weapon folks... We feel your pain
---
Wrapped cap makes you bald 😂
---
theyre using it as a metric for community enthusiasm.
---
this boycott wont create innovation, it will end it
---
Hi! I played it solo almost all the time. It´s good.. You can play solo.. BUT!
---
They introduced a public group system.. That makes it absolutely easy to join a group and play in a group. I changed completely to groupplay. Works fine. At least that does ;)
---
Glad to hear it works! 
---
Have fun and remember to spend all your junk to the brotherhood so I can have my cosmetics 😅👍
---
Yeah, me too and I don't have a clue why this happens and what I can do about it.
---
With all the other patch related bad news, I'm so fucking mad right now...
---
Yes. I experienced this after “Line in the sand” getting guns to scrap.
---
I think they are just doing this event to clear out people's inventory's off the server...
---
Oh and I couldn't build on the big satellite, I had to jump, shimmy, and crawl
---
The caps and junk are never an issue, but your point on daily/weekly atoms is a big one that hits every player
---
Yes its a waste.
---
Why the eff are we getting a Valentine's Bed in August!!! Makes no sense!!!
---
They just need to revert back to Fallout 4s building system that didn’t have all the creativity-killing restrictions.
---
Can you explain this? How does it hinder the builders. I just can’t picture what everyone means. Can’t you scrap the wall and build what you want? Albeit with a couple more steps than replacing it?
---
Tysm, I'm not a returning, been playing the game for a week, so I guess I was watching some pretty old tutorials lol, but seriously, thank you.
---
Yep. There is nothing rare.
---
I open the reward boxes at a vendor and sell them immediately. In effect I'm just getting caps as rewards with the occasional (usually unwanted/needed) 'rare' plan thrown in for variety.
---
You mean exterior wallpapers? Because it sucks that there can only be 5 different exteriors. That white brick would be great.
---
they're clueless man, and i'm over it. tired of wasting time on a game that the devs clearly don't give a fuck about. every patch now is just catch up, trying to fix the bugs they introduced with the previous patch, all while breaking something else that will be fixed in another month or so, whenever we actually get another patch.
---
Yeah they're really not to worth
---
I've seen it happen sometimes after line in the sand but most of the time I am seeing server crashes after line.
---
That's a fair point. Stupid cap limit.
---
That what I'm saying. Lol I ain't giving them nothing!
---
Right?!
---
Ah that makes sense. No problem.  
---
Good luck!
---
Don't give them ideas!
---
There was so much fire in these boards today over silly walls.
---
Yet when given a chance to be heard people get spineless and pretend they cant do anything. 
---
Reddit is such a waste of souls...
---
*off the soap box knowing I tried.
---
This has been happening to me since launch and exactly how you described it with the loud pop before it goes black, but it's interesting you connected it to melee. It happened a lot with my first main, a slugger build, then it wasn't a problem for the past year while I was using guns on my fav builds. But then in the past couple months it's been happening again while I built up my newest character and, yep, it's an unarmed. I'll be damned.
---
Oh but I love the look of gauss minigun so much
---
Is there any reason why we couldn't just have the Ammo Press System from Fallout 3? Or the Reloading Bench from new Vegas?
---
Despite the "fixes" to make it better, it's still one hell of a slog. In all seriousness, who the hell thought it would be smart to put a "Failed/Thank You" screen after each transaction). It's incredibly unwieldy to use due to the constant Click/Tab, which really starts to lag as the more it progresses.
---
Couldn't it be as simple as "Click" and a Top Left Notification of [X Ammo Removed/Purchased] without the screen changing states? That way all we have to do is click until we get the [Insufficient Ammo] notification on the top left. Then move on to the next and so forth.
---
Please read our wiki page on this subject
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning)
---
It's great especially with FO1st.
---
You get a full set of raider armor through the main quest. 
---
Also I suggest you read the guides on loot spawning.
---
Cyberpunk is gonna kill every other game for 6 months,not just f76.
---
No way they'll pull that. You can't offer meat week again and only have it pop for "those who donate" and the same for the double score or purveyor. You'll be fine.
---
Yeah I only did my daily and surprisingly most of the *weeks* SCORE in an hour and logged out.
---
Sign of the end of my time in Appalachia. Not because I don't love F76, there's just so little being done to truly get excited about or make it worth dedicating personal time to. Wastelanders was truly fun, but about a few weeks worth of actual casual content at best. 
---
This game is like that stunning girl in high school who settled for the ultimate choad douchebag (or several...) who you see at the grocery store in her early thirties who's absolutely gone to sea and you think of what a tragic waste it was. That's how I feel about F76. You *used* to be pretty n cool.
---
The only sugar bombs I want ♥️
---
Yea so nobody gets rewards. That’ll show ‘em
---
Feck same here, I just can't even, I loved bows. You could get your ammo back, sneak, keep sneaking, level half a camp without alerting anyone.. I just DEALT with the fact that sometimes VATS would screw up my bow (stuck in aim down sights mode). But idk if I can deal with 2 bugs attached to one type of weapon, especially if it is my main goto
---
Really should just take the time and overhaul the game. I wouldn't mind servers being off for a while if it meant a beautifully smooth experience. I love this game I play every day with my girlfriend and my brother. Kind of tired of killing legendary's just for them to poof away as I'm about to loot.
---
No he didn't. He used satellite communications to recruit the Appalachian BoS before losing contact. We have no reason to believe Maxson ever left California after the war.
---
This would be something to say when they actually have a release this year.
---
II don't think you are wrong, per se, but Bethesda is going to feel this. Builders create their own end game content, but they are also the greatest spenders of atoms and 1st. I spin up a pvt server so I can take a flat workshop(wade airport usually) and practice my builds/experiment ideas.
---
Most of us are looking for other options. Any game can take its place. Satisfactory and subnautic have been on my list of games with build systems to try and I have a ton of other open world games burning a hole in my steam library pocket.
---
If I can quit Wow walking away from 76 will be cake.
---
Bad business is losing the people paying the bills. This and the floating walls breaks nearly everything about MY builds and my enjoyment of the end game.
---
A slap in the face.
---
Hunters Pipe Revolver, Stalkers Bolt Action Pipe - double perk whammy! 
---
L230 and the damn RNG just won't give me Bloodied pistols (or pipe rifles) however often I craft, kill or visit Murms...but it will give me a 1* Zealots Ski Sword drop, followed immediately by an identical 1* Zealots Ski Sword from another legendary drop in another battle.
---
No. People are pissed because they used exploits for building their camps and now some of them got fixed.
---
It takes up so much screen though haha. An explosive gp is stupidly op. Don't use it if you don't want to. It's not needed
---
I quit the game when legendary run came out, how'd they nerf building?
---
please provide your source for maxson being in appalachia post-war.
---
What system or launcher are you on?
---
Make the AA a powerful automatic.
---
Umm have taken a look around at all? There’s all kinds of people protesting things for frankly just about the stupidest reasons.
---
Can recommend that
---
No man we won't stop. It's not just the double wall paper,it's a trick that is used for much more than that,in the construction of master camps. 
---
Also stop for what? Other posts about this or that guy that gifted a dick in box to a box enthusiast?
---
I'm level 45, haven't found out what Starched genes are or even were to get them yet.
---
Whoa, sir, im happy to find another soul with the same issue, i was under the impression il be alone in this conundrum :D
---
So it does seem to be tied to melee, hopefully.
---
Oh yeah ! to note further......it seems to be also tied to doing crits while performing a melee attack, at least from my limited observations on the matter.
---
I play Solo-Team...essentially joining/creating a public team and getting the bonuses but continuing to follow my own path with the option to coop as and when it works better for quests/events.
---
they're clueless man, and i'm over it. tired of wasting time on a game that the devs clearly don't give a fuck about. every patch now is just catch up, trying to fix the bugs they introduced with the previous patch, all while breaking something else that will be fixed in another month or so, whenever we actually get another patch. 
---
they "didn't have time" to fix the SBQ, or the auto-completion bug, or your ally not providing dailies, or even to have the fucking Colossus event ready after months of testing, but they had plenty time to fuck up camp building, fix picture frames, and pull a completely stupid attempt to get rid of duper scrap and disguise it as an event.
---
Bethesda doesn't give a single fuck about their players.
---
Yeah I just checked today to see if it went away. Still awful.
---
To have to go back and forth isn't better. I'll take the previous spamming x and only seeing ammo options that I have. This new stuff is nonsense and hardly worth it in the end. I'll take the nothing and spend my time doing events or something
---
&gt; They could have zero contributions and still mark every last challenge as complete, and nobody could prove the progress was manipulated.
---
That's because it's in the company's best interest to fudge the numbers. They want to prove to their competition (other game developers/publishers) that their game still has a healthy and active playerbase, and is not dying or dwindling.
---
So yeah, it doesn't matter what resources people do or do not donate, because everyone will get the top tier rewards at the end of it anyways. Capitalism will see to that.
---
They “added it” but they haven’t “implemented it”
---
100% agree and good post.
---
This new update was just another massive disappointment, that brought hardly any new fixes to boot, as well as Wendigo being delayed for weeks. Deary me, what has happened in comparison to last spring? Constant new and fun content back then.
---
Also, im having no doubt that we will find a plethora of new bugs this update that we get to enjoy for at least a month.
---
lol the 12 year old op deleted the comment calling you a turd lover.
---
Pc
---
lol
---
"chew some bubblegum", "kill 5 super mutants", "kill a legendary enemy", "build 10 something in a camp or workshop"...
---
What are u even talking about? Even a three year old child would come up with some harder and time consuming tasks.
---
😹😹😹
---
i just wanna know why i have options to sell ammo in quantities i dont have. and options to sell ammo i dont have period. the old system was tedious but i was able to get rid of everything efficiently. now unless i keep track of evetything myself, i get the "you dont have enough of this ammo type" screen constantly.
---
Its really not tho
---
&gt; In effect I'm just getting caps as rewards
---
The irony is that if you'd bulked the steel and sold that directly to a vendor, you'd get more caps out of it than selling a few bottles of booze.
---
Great post OP, but sadly we know Bethesda never does podcasts about updates, never talks to us unless it’s on their terms with drones asking questions scripted questions, and the fact that they never address community outrage is probably the worst thing that the can do. Honestly I’d recommend we all just boycott bethesda by not paying for anything and to get their other game communities in on it.
---
I'd actually consider spending atoms, if the legendary run hadn't burned me out and every update wasn't a disappointment.
---
Cmon Bethesda, people wanna like the game and then also would spend money on it, but why do you keep making it unlikable and piss off your fans?
---
As soon as i finish the legendary run im getting off this game for a while. I need to enjoy something else.
---
I really want to abandon this game now for a bit. But that fomo i guess has got me? I dunno.
---
Oh I see. I heard his voice in a few holotapes with him talking with Taggerdy and addressing the brotherhood and I assumed he had done so in person
---
The update is 49GB for pc gamepass for whatever reason
---
Brotherhood of Cork!  I thought it was just me getting an abundance of alcohol.  I hate this already.
---
I'm not sure why would they change the building rules all of a sudden? It's probably not intended anyway, so let's get loud!
---
That's actually the point my friend.  Why were their obviously very limited resources devoted to changes no one asked for when their are such glaring problems that have been in the game since day 1 like the fast travel bugs or the trade bugs (plural).  Bugs  which players are frustrated with on a daily, scratch that, hourly basis.
---
Eve online had a period of massive changes that were hugely controversial. The entire pve community/industrial community cancelled their subs and a week later all the changes were reverted.
---
I know. I meant that the list was made. Now I know I won't be donating lol
---
&gt; The only reason i was going to donate was to get a package to display at my camp but found out you can't even do that.
---
Do the packages not go in display cases? That sucks, I was hoping to have a few BoS boxes sitting on my shelves for flavor scenery.
---
LOL... No wonder we can't come together if posts are getting removed for no reason...
---
And you have to put items for sale. If it's powered but has no items, the icon on the map is a tent.
---
That’d be disappointing but not surprising :/
---
Farming steel isn’t hard. It’s one of the most common and easy to get resources. In fact I never keep much if any in my stash box. If I need it I simple go out and get it. Done. 
---
And yes I agree the rewards from the ATLAS provision boxes are very meh. Collecting steel is one of easiest things to do in the game. If you think it’s hard, impossible or you always struggle with it. Maybe you don’t realize what junk gives steel. Maybe you use too many bullets because you just want to stay at a safe distance and spray ammo everywhere. Who knows. 
---
Also we all know that duping isn’t fixed. Somewhere some how someone’s found a way to dupe. Hell even Animal Crossing has duping issues.
---
So I don’t want to see another case of duped plans in the game. Or whatever items.
---
At the same time. Yes I want a chance for at least something fun. 
---
But trying to get people to boycott the event, because YOU PERSONALLY want something cool and neat and unique is selfish and unfair to other players. 
---
You don’t have to donate. But trying to tank it means your trying to ruin it for others that DO want to do the event.
---
Your no better than people who one shot legendaries robbing everyone else of the chance.
---
Don’t participate. But don’t try and encourage others no not because you want to get back at Bethesda.
---
If you don’t and the event gets completed you’ve lost nothing and got free stuff.
---
Also crafting ammo for those gauss weapons is a pain in the a\*\*...
---
But the gauss minigun is what comes closest to a legacy energie weapon.
---
Because this all building thing was bug not a feature or something They dont need reason for fixing bug
---
Even better is the one with the Daily Quests. To include a non-Daily Quest (non repeatable) here is a true masterpiece...
---
Perk in luck. Keeps your mutations even when you get rid of rads
---
You mean to tell me I trudged over-encumbered with 4000 steel from Pleasant Valley Station for nothing.  Where?
---
I've submitted a ticket, but I'm sure they're busy sifting through a bunch of bullshit tickets from people bitching about walls and colossal problem not working.
---
Can confirm after last night...got her to half health so she would mutate the first time she landed in 10 seconds or less. Got her to half again the next time she landed in 10 seconds or less. And stopped so others could get their damage in. Felt like a dick for even testing it sorry if anyone didnt get their loot on XB1 last night ☹
---
Because you have three development teams. 
---
A Team does main games. 
---
B Team does ESO
---
C Team does FO76
---
no big deal, so i cant complete the story line. Who cares, im only on my first character and paying for 1st. Really Really bad experiences so far. If anyone were to as me I would have to suggest them not getting this game. It has the potential to be great but it feels like something a college kid made in his spare time. Thanks for the response tho.
---
Good bye then
---
I have already purchased cyberpunk and will be spending the majority of my time playing it once it's released.
---
 There's nothing Bethesda can do or implement to change that.  I have played 76 since Beta and am really running out of reasons to log in anymore. Once season one is complete that's probably going to be it for me for a while.  I will turn off my fallout 1st subscription and hope for the best for this game.
---
I want a massive sea of change too OP, but the problem is that they will tell us about their “change” but then take a year to do it. Wastelanders took a whole year upon announcement to be implemented. The devs are deaf and stupid and I was talking to a friend of mine last night and we were saying it’s like the Devs haven’t even truly played the game like a normal player. We bet they have their dev accounts and run the game on small, workable, local servers and don’t truly see the game like we do. Heck I wanna know just how many people are on that team personally.
---
Any coder or database designer could tell you it's likely defined as INT(32), probably unsigned giving it a 0-4.2billion range.   Having a 0 there or 3,832,865 takes the same storage/memory.
---
Things that cannot deviate (currency, scrap, ammo) are simply counts (or INT() of some sort).  Your right that frees up space in the stash for more stuff, but how much more? I was 700ist when I went first, and 600ish when I moved my scrap out.  IE it was already mostly weapons, ammo, and aid/misc (fucking gunpowder)
---
Nah. I can get booze I don't want for free with my faschaut collectron
---
-Michael Scott
---
2★ fixer bloodied ffr
---
If theres one thing I've learned from MMOs is they will never truly show the real progress and will give maximum rewards by the end of event. If they don't it would show they failed at developing the event.
---
The double wall removal a HUGE thing in every building community im a member of. This breaks a huge thing from a major part of a lot of players endgame "fun" you can no longer have a nice looking interior of your home. If thats what your interested in doing in this massive open world game.
---
Should have a plan trade service in game trade so many useless plans in for one you actually need it sell them back to vendor bots.
---
And in additions they fuck up her loot table and you only get normal SB loot.
---
No but seriously with the way damage is registered on the SBQ to determine if you deserve quest rewards, it could really fuck with the level scaling if Bethesda fucks this up (which their track record says everything about)
---
You don't want tight costumes, that's for sure.
---
I'm level 60. I turned in 500 steel and quickly decided that the event is worthless. I'm done with it already. I was hoping to use it as an alternative to getting the BOS t60 paints or maybe getting t51 BOS paint. Hell even some alternative camo BOS undersuits or scribe uniforms would have been awesome. If they added the other riot gear variants as rare drops I'd have been hooked.
---
But NOPE. We get FUCK ALL. Shitty plans and trash.
---
I need money first... And I highly doubt it’ll be one of those grand slam $10,000,000 in compensatory fees cases.
---
This sub is like Groundhog Day. 
---
Bethesda releases some lame content - everyone complains and threatens to leave. 
---
I walked away from this dumpster fire early on and never looked back. Was apparent right from the start that Bethesda failed hard.
---
I did not know this. I'll have to try it out.
---
A single player game? Nah, don't think it's fair.
---
I'm not disagreeing, but it's intentional and I bet there's still a lot of 'support tickets' for it anyway.
---
If they just let us wallpaper both sides of a single wall piece, the problem would be mostly solved.
---
And it's strange that they don't allow this, because... you know those stars and planets wallpapers everyone is getting for free as part of the legendary run? Well, those actually look awesome when placed all around the *outside* of a building. Especially since they glow in the dark, and can be seen from quite far away.
---
Always good to have a 100th confirmation about something.
---
I came here looking to see if anyone else had this issue... doesn't make sense when my friend's patch was only 4Gb through the Beth launcher
---
I absolutely hate the gold bullion grind, going on my 4th week grinding for a freaken armor set and the only peice that has the pocketed mod is the chest peice. Sure I can try my luck for legendary effects but wait I can only make so many a day because it takes legendary modules and I can only get so many a day because the scrip is limited too.
---
Always good to be a whiny asshole about a PSA for people who may not have seen the other 99 :)
---
You’re right... my bad. That scavenger collectron never shuts up.
---
Those new drop loot bags are difficult to loot, it takes some hovering until you see the menu
---
I am also having this problem and I've submitted a ticket for it. Was really hoping to do the raider side but I may get impatient and side with Foundation just to get started on my treasury notes.
---
You also gave them 4000 steel for diluted Christmas presents, in case you hadn’t noticed.
---
Dont call them Bugtesdas! It makes them sound like they actually do bug testing
---
Nope cannot be displayed in display cases.
---
Why not? You are so 100% adamant that your case is open and shut. Even a small 500,000 pay out would be enough for the lawyer and you to get some money.
---
Probably talking about junkies
---
I feel the community is overreacting a bit too...
---
Destroying the building community for not being able to build a double side wall?
---
 I mean come on... I was not even aware this was a thing.
---
I figured out that it it not language but mod related as it does not worked as i turned them off.
---
My loaded mods are:
---
sResourceIndexFileList = EnhancedBlood - Textures.ba2, EnhancedBlood - Meshes.ba2
---
sResourceArchive2List = PerkLoadoutManager.ba2, EventNotifications.ba2, ImprovedHealthBars.ba2, ChatMod.ba2, BetterInventory.ba2, SaveEverything.ba2, OldRepair.ba2, intRaw.ba2, HiddenStandardBackpack.ba2, PA\_FastANIM.ba2, 10SMGDS.ba2, TacticalReflexSights.ba2, PipeGuns - NormalReflexSight.ba2, UHDmap.ba2, Glowing Scorched.ba2, Shades.ba2, Glow.ba2, BagGlow.ba2, ModBoxGlow.ba2, AshPile - NWDuffleBag.ba2, Meatbags - Meshes.ba2, CheckYourReflexes.ba2, Power Armor Clean HUD.ba2, Diranars\_PALight\_Up.ba2, BetterGITDMap.ba2
---
Nothing different that I can think of. Quit Ps4 and started playing on PC myself.
---
I really enjoyed Fallout 4 and the mods available for building. But the appeal of FO76 was the ability to play with friends and other people... to stumble across other camps. Have others find yours and comment on them. Yeah, we could video our camps but so much better when folks can actually enter it and interact with it themselves.
---
No it has nothing to do with this, I've done this mission on several characters before but cannot progress it now, the entire mission is broken.
---
Because it is an option to get a response from the company. I support filling their inbox with "bs" tickets. Your issue however is far more important than the removal of a mechanic that's existed since beta.
---
They are gonna give the rewards anyway. Just wait and see.
---
Yeah. I don't know how Bethesda's update system works since since the steam and Bethesda launcher versions were significantly smaller even though all three of them are practically the same versions.
---
If they were so much off with their expectations for this machine, how off are they still with the other limits in this game?
---
30k caps? Easily reached.
---
800kg stash? You like to collect stuff? Better buy premium.
---
1000 scrip/150 a day, while one item can go for 40? Wtf bethesda
---
The only thing that's not limited is the fucking atoms
---
How do you trigger it?
---
Because building was why we put up with the other bugs to begin with 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
My gamepass download was only 8.6gb, I assume it needed 50gb for uncompressing and updating files?
---
God forbid they changed camp site to a cube instead of a sphere ...
---
I'm mainly puzzled why BGS spent time on 'fixing' that. Just... why? They could have fixed the queen cripling for example.
---
Yeah, this patch did more damage then it ended up helping.
---
I mean, i get the rewards arent great, but i think you dont fully grasp what a donation is, a donation is something you give for no reward, so tha fact you get anything for doing this should be a bonus.
---
I may just get started on the game Grounded and uninstall 76 if this shit takes more than 2 days.
---
I haven't gone to Atlas yet. I feel this is another 'fun' grind for little reward it won't be worth it.
---
And everything bad happens cuz of money
---
But... settlers, raiders, and bicentennial just went on sale, also did you not see the rustic toilet? Its got a molerat in it! A molerat!!
---
Sorry, Prospector's hat. And it's in the world.
---
I guess we're all doing our part
---
Yeah, after I got the legacy gatling plasma I don’t see any points of crafting and holding a tons of heavy and expensive ammo of gauss minigun but I do love the appearance of that hungry bastard
---
Yeah I agree but the gauss minigun is really sexy
---
Glitch, not exploit. Switching walls gave no in-game advantage over other players, nor benefited their own character other than the ability to build a lot more creatively. There are quite a few communities and sites centered solely around building in the game.
---
Scrap anything and place everywhere made building fun
---
How often does it crash for you? For me it's like once a week which is like nothing compared to how it used to be
---
If enemy is full health it hits like a tank. You don't have to charge to get base damage or legendary effect, BUT a fully charged shot will do more damage over base damage, so a fully charged shot on full health enemy will do double that.
---
A Colossal Problem is a small feature?
---
I'll look it up; thanks.
---
Yeah couldn't they just make a column with stuff you want to put in like with vendors and just let it calculate the ammo points. It's surprising how bad they made it.
---
I don't understand who sat a developer down and said "Okay, we've got the biggest update since wastelanders on Tuesday, broken perks we need to fix, players can't fast travel, vats still not hitting, and we need you to fix double walls."
---
They first killed the pvp community, bye bye survival, then they killed the trading community, allowing a dupe for days and then randomly ban some and not others, now they will kill the building community... they just want us to play the legendary run 🤔
---
Nope it needed to download almost 50 gb to update. Also how did yours download only 8.6gb?
---
That sounds cool, how does it work?
---
I'm not sure why you're starting to be a dick, but yeah, an actual bug is more important to report than a false report about an intended change. I literally cannot progress the game, but sure. Keep in mind that I don't agree with the building changes, but that is *not* a support issue and flooding support with complaints is childish.
---
My favorite is a Bloodied  Rifle that dropped from Murmur with FFR and FR.   :)
---
Unsubscribed yesterday, stopped playing in the first week of legendary run as it burned me out. Will keep watching fo76 for when new content comes. The more I realize how little fucks Bethesda actually gives for the community, the less fucks I give about fo76. It's just sad tbh.
---
Sounds familiar
---
No idea, when I started the download it said 8.6gb, downloaded and patched. I’m on the Australian Xbox store so maybe our version is different or something, no idea. Sorry you have to put up with a crazy big download :(
---
Yeah. I dont really understand what these insane ramblings mean. All I know is the game is actually enjoyable to play now compared to unplayable before.
---
Here here! Doesn't make any sense why we should continue to accept crap. To the nay-sayers who think this won't do anything, if Bethesda is not making a dime off this game anymore, then their only options are listen to the players, or deep six 76. Let's put them on the spot and ask what it's going to be.
---
so the time passed, but I don't understand what you mean about collecting a set number of other items? Can you elaborate please?
---
Reddit is always full of pointless posts so I don't see this as any different
---
Im not even gonna be able to donate cuz i have no power
---
Exactly! Again, I would be more forgiving if they patched it out(actually fixed it too instead of just removing the option to replace doorways), and gave us an option to easily wallpaper both sides, or added interior walls for the various wall types.
---
So uh why should I donate materials...? I actually regret donating 500 steel now. The rewards are things I don't want, it's boring and Im not sure if me contributing helps anything
---
Im genuinely curious about those 300$ you spent in Atoms. That means you got approximately 40000 + 19800 atoms. What have you spent all those Atoms on?
---
Had the same problem. Verifying the game files did the trick for me
---
This is why i quit fo76 too.  The devs literally dont care.  There words make it seem like they do but their actions speak a million words. They do not care about you. No fun is allowed.
---
For XBox you just hold the B button for a second, and it will exit.
---
Sorry! I dont mean to come across like an ass toward you! At all! My apologies. I do mean to convey my anger at bethesda however. 
---
Your issue is far more important than the changes to the building "glitches" they fixed. I dont mean that at all sarcastically. There needs to be a way to get developer feedback beyond their community relations manager telling us the issue has been passed up the chain, but without that, the support tickets force the companies response to your complaint.
---
Just watched angryturtles video on monday where he was preparing for the event and explaining it, and was a little bit hyped to finally have a little reason to play fo76 again.
---
Even the way they're wording it in the patch notes is absolute bullshit. "We've added the event in this patch. But it's still not finished for the same reasons we've already delayed it last time so you have to wait for the next patch." what is this scam?
---
BE Lever, BE90 Railway.  TBH I like the Railway the best.  The lever is better for stealth though.
---
What happened to one violent night?
---
Hmm what do you mean with 'grass growing'? Are you talking about when you haven't raised it enough?
---
They really aren't good with water items - the too slow well, the clean sink with the dirty tap water, and now the too small barrel.
---
If your character is built right SS armor way outstripes it on tankyness.
---
Great film.
---
Those performing magazines really put on a show.
---
Maybe? But the download size is just so big compared to other platforms. I expect patches this big to be a huge update like Wastelanders
---
I lost a strangler heart the other day and submitted a ticket and they said to check my stash box (didn't think of that) or remember if you die to pick up your loot. Just seem this game takes one step forward and twenty steps back
---
Like all the bugged challenges. People shouldn't have to email you every time a challenge is bugged, I have like 5 bugged challenges
---
No public events in Cyperpunk where my level 500 can flex and 1 shot level 25 legendries, then wave at the crying level 20's giving me thumbs down.
---
so I choose FO76. It's a game for real players!!
---
I guess that Beth was afraid if they made it any more useful people would be screaming, "See?! Pay to win!" 
---
..sort of the same idea as the fridge/icebox, basically cosmetic with a minimal practical use.
---
Calling this update  “A Colossal Problem” was a good move...
---
Especially because the reasons they gave for that is exactly the same shit this thing was delayed in the first place, didn't they?
---
It's fascinating how much Bethesda can fuck up. Instead of honestly delaying it until it is finally finished, they again try to meet an unrealistic deadline only to fuck it up it again. It's like they actively try to disappoint their fanbase. Just baffled by how much they're sabotaging themselves.
---
people complain because they want to enjoy it. whineing about whiners though is always a bad look.
---
It's fascinating. They could've built on what they learned from what, 7 years of ESO? Instead, they chose to follow The Division 2 ideology - forget all progress from previous game, ignore players whose input fixed the previous game, continue to make irrational, knee jerk changes until all players give up and move on to something better. 
---
Wouldn't want to think about what happens to all these jobs when Cyberpunk comes out...
---
I'm a party boy I've my alcoholism under control.
---
Even I’m not so much of a dumbass that I think it’ll net me a fortune, small or otherwise. I’ll probably get less than I spend on the lawsuit.
---
Mine was also only 8.6 gb
---
Thanks! Let's see if they wake up and smell the coffee. I'm impressed with the response this patch has gotten. I think everyone should condemn this, this has been the last straw for me. Even if you are not a builder, you must see that this a long with many of the recent and past decisions are absolutely ridiculous.
---
It was more of a joke post but yes I have noticed that lol
---
If there were items you could find or craft in-game which performed better, I'd have an easier time believing this.
---
Are you planning on running stealth, vats, or power armor?
---
People are really getting their panties in a twist over this camp thing. I'm glad I'm not a builder.
---
Sorry for calling you a dick then, I thought you were being sarcastic. I think this subreddit is monitored or at least visited by Bethesda developers and the entire sub has been very vocal about the wall issue. I'm just frustrated with my inability to progress the game.
---
I have better things to do with my steel...
---
Don't worry in a few weeks there will be n Atom Shop or FO1 item that will  allow you to do these things
---
I know the only thing I do now is get score once I'm done I'm probably done for a long time
---
We just need a wall Frame that we can apply skins to either side.
---
I agree it was an easy brownie point for a developer, AND because it has been shown again and again and again that the devs play the game very little, they didn't even try to think who this would annoy.
---
Ugh that weapon plan list. As a new player my lever gun plan hunt continues :(
---
Bump it up! Bump it up!
---
They are getting nothing from me. All the rewards are trash anyway
---
Sounds good.im trying to find a junkies or bloodied radium just to try it out
---
An unpopular opinion that we share. There are frequent posts about the difficulty of these tasks, most done without trying. Others require specific but minimal effort.
---
For a long time its been. If something is easy, its too easy. If it is challenging its too challenging. A lot of Goldilocks players out here.
---
These rewards are garbage. Who the hell needs any more grenades I can make them myself. F the beret! It's not worth it I'm not putting any more in there
---
They didn't just break it, they intentionally removed it.
---
Bloodied pump action shotgun, bloodied fixer, TSE handmade, and a bloodied 33% hit chance lever action.
---
This whole thing is the 21st century horse armor
---
Ive decided not to donate any materals to the BoS.
---
That would be the icing on the cake lmao.
---
It'd be nice for one of these to be a reskin of the small water purifier that just requires the plan.
---
Whole gaming world is waiting on Cyberpunk, including devs here probably. BUT I will still be playing FO76 . Not like I am going to devote all gaming time to CP every session. Love this damn broken game.
---
It didnt. Its purpose was to stop the smell.
---
Lol people still play this garbage heap of a game?
---
Would spending all my time nuking the observatory childish and unfair?
---
Why ruin a rant with common sense. Get that out of here!!
---
So you prefer paying for atoms over free?
---
The only way the new system is more engaging is if people actually want the specific cosmetics from the run?
---
..just wondering; when you collect the 2 dirty waters do you get any rads? like you would collecting from a sink or well..
---
On bethesda launcher?
---
Seriously who the hell needs any of that when you can make it yourself???
---
I was hyped for this, but now I'm just playing the new Gwent update instead. Good job, good effort, Bethesda.
---
It’s nothing special. Booze mainly. Grenades, the floater kind, but also the frag, pulse and plasma. Sometimes mines.
---
Sometimes a plan.
---
&gt;They could've built on what they learned from what, 7 years of ESO?
---
Except ESO is ZeniMax Online. FO76 is BGS.
---
I mean, I get what you mean, but at that point, they could learn from several other online games as well...
---
I posted an edit, which may or may not help, but ive seen high ping or latency issues cause instanced locations to not load. If you try resetting your internet at the modem/router that might help your ping, therefore help your ability to load the instance.
---
The building community a long with other parts of the community are fed up. Thus you are seeing a lot of posts about building being nerfed. Colossal problem being delayed again, SS DP mods said to have been added and were not etc. If you don't like the subject don't read the sub while this is going over. Nobody is forcing you to scroll through this. It's like saying i don't like the news, Trump is always on the news, we get it, stop posting about him, it´s cluttering news feed/site
---
"the team" its what they call the garbage bin in the office
---
How?
---
Seriously starting to make me sick. You included this in the patch notes saying that this would be available. Not available for anyone sick and tired of the lies
---
Ha, I actually forgot to grab the water before I logged off, so I don't know the answer to this. (Knowing this game, though, my guess is that you'd still get the rads.)
---
Don’t listen to bitter people. If you want to donate do it, the steel in this game never runs out.
---
Kinda mind boggling they choose valuable scrap as the item to turn in, at a minimum of 250 at that. So the reward for unloading all your scrap is a beret reskin. And then you get squat in the provisions for the 250. Why in the hell would I dump my scrap I can use for more beneficial things?  They should’ve introduced some kind of temporary item (like a BOS dog tag or something) that you get off of enemies and quests.
---
 Great job on this patch and pissing everyone off The ass hat that had the idea to change everything should be shot ,poisoned, drown,stabbed,run over by car, tossed in pool with plugged in toaster and the list go's on GUYS really need to start caring about your player base before its gone :( 
---
 **BIG F U Bethesda..........**
---
I don't know, I hit update on my Xbox and it only had an 8.6 GB update
---

---
I see. I don’t think it’s black too, but thanks.
---
I figure every comment MAY help.
---
I came back to this game simply for the excitement of getting into building again. I got addicted to watching “best camps” type videos on YouTube. I binged all the “glitch camp tricks” videos learning everything I could. I subscribed to Fallout 1st for the extra atoms, and I ONLY spend them in the CAMP section of the atom shop. I’m a first-person player; what my character looks like is almost pointless to me. I grind SCORE dailies simply because I want to get to the camp items. I enjoy building a nice camp with cool vendor layouts for people to visit. Taking away any freedom in camp building is a huge hit for a player like me. Please listen, Bethesda.
---
I need to be a little more educated as to why people are getting their panties in a twist over this. How does this no foundation, wall thing work?
---
With bethesda magic, just remember the recipe, flamer before capacitor.
---
Even if it were, why let that stop you :D 
---
First time in a long time I loaded the game up today got to the menu and just logged back out. Nothing really for me to do at all until daily reset.
---
Never really bothered me before but I guess with the latest disappointments it finally tipped me over and sapped my desire to make busywork even. I was planning on nking ATLAS though (with a secndary on the queen to make up for it slightly) but meh.
---
That's exactly what I've got (Bloodied 33% VATs Lever Action and Bloodied FFR Pump Action). Do you find you ignore one of the guns more than the other?
---
Same static “everything is squares” at sons of Dane one violent night event
---
I have deja vu with this. They said, Rift will kill WoW. Then Wildstar. Then SWTOR. And a billion others, most of them even got a full shutdown...
---
Sorry :(
---
We're just supposed to use foundations at, what, their max heights then? Might be so, but I def missed that memo; I seem to remember when our floors were actually our floors, and not some tiles with patches of weed though.
---
But there has been more than plenty of outcry about every one of those things?
---
You could probably use that time to go out for a walk, pet your dog or ask Greg why he fucked my late mom.
---
They exploited a glitch to build structures that were not intended to be build that way.
---
I'm using a pc to play this. I looked at the xbox app and it said 49.6 GB.
---
I don't know, sure this was probably not needed, but in game development, different team are working on different side of the game. 
---
Those who work for the building mode, are not those who work on game balance, and not those who work on quests etc...
---
This is the "awards" that you can get. Warning: its really bad 
---
Why do they keep sabotaging themselves?
---
I am amazed people are still playing this game.  Im also amazed Bethesda is gutting it.
---
It's a little like bungie taking flight out of Anthem.
---
It works like a regular casual underarmor instead of an actual SS one (no mods, etc.). It's basically only good for NW.
---
I tried on/off teams, different servers, private server, closing the game and turning the xbox off for about 7 hours. I'm seeing more reports about this same issue so I'm inclined to think it's an actual game issue.
---
Let's get a mooove on.
---
EXACTLY!!!!!!!!!! I will lose our shit if thats all we get for being 1st members....
---
So... How about some graphical / engine optimizations? R5 3600 + RX 5700XT and still get fps drops to 30 in specific places, doesn't matter if its on low or ultra :P
---
Bloodied Handmade, Bloodied Deathclaw and then a low damage tesla rifle for tagging during events
---
Look do you want a spoiler?
---
&gt;!The detachment off the Brotherhood of Steel that's coming to the region has  been traveling for months to get to the Appalachia region without contact HQ in the West for far too long and there are holotapes in the game files right now with Maxon basically begging the leader of the coming detachment to contact them as soon as possible because if not Scribes in HQ are thinking about removing the existence of the detachment that is from their Codex meaning their history. 
---
Fracture Steel is the name of the expansion coming in winter that along with the fact that we know that the Brotherhood of Steel in Fallout 3 believes they're the first detachment in the east it means that yes indeed the Scribes at HQ did remove the existence of this detachment coming to the region from their cortex and history!&lt;
---
FO76: Broken WasteLadders. Coming soon!™
---
Only for this part she should receive an Oscar
---
Fair point, I won't renew my subscription when it ends in a few days.
---
This doesn't fix the error where steam thinks FO76 hasn't been bought yet.
---
With steam you can only launch what you've bought or added as an external game.
---
So a pointless item? You can probs take water out of a river or stream quicker plus why bother if you can just get purified water out of anyone's water purifier
---
Totally. ESO comes to mind first just because it's a Zenimax title, just as FO76 is. The fact they couldn't even communicate with another studio owned by their parent company for experience in online gaming and communication is the true embarrassment here only rivaled by the fact that no one there bothers to play their own game.
---
Try resetting your internet, it might feel useless but ive seen that fix this issue. High ping makes the server do weird shit. Worth a shot to me. Ive seen other threads though too.
---
If you want to really send a message, you should unistal. That's the only true way to vote and it includes both of your suggestions.
---
I won't do it, but if you want to rise to the barricades, then you should. I will just keep playing when One Appalachia is released.
---
Bloody awful. Even as a new player I own almost all of the stuff in there just via buying from players. If those armour plans were a 50% chance then it would make me actually want to farm for missing plans. Everything that's useful is insanely low drop chance.
---
Nothing
---
Yeah definitely. I only use the shotgun if
---
A) I’m low on .45
---
B) If I want to switch to close range targets (only sometimes)
---
C) If I’m just trying to mess around
---
They added them to the files, but forgot to add them to the vendor. So they halfway did what they intended. 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
Fallout is one of the greatest science fiction, alternative history, RPG(lite) game series with so much mythos and developed history - it's fascinating.
---
It's also sad how Bethesda seems to be going out of their way to fucking destroy it. Like... jfc. Fire your team, hire the modders. Your stock in the community of people who actually play and pay would go up immediately and even more when they release an update that is actually good.
---
That's just perfect.
---
&gt; Some poor, underpaid Dev will just have to read thru them
---
No he wont, someone lower reads it, maybe.
---
You forgot about people like me: those who like cosmetics and practically collect them.
---
Ever since the Atom challenges got swapped with those garbage ass S.C.O.R.E challenges, I have been feeling empty. And no, while i do like the beelzebilly outfit and mr demonic backpack being added and free, they too are just reskinned content, so that doesn't cut it.
---
I normally am strongly against digital rioting, but this time, I say "go ham".
---
100 modules later and not one piece of SS Unyielding
---
Didn't think i'd agree with a raider...
---
that title reads like the unwanted child of a haiku and a limmerick
---
Doing those things does not circumvent the budget. If a person wants to spend their budget by doubling all their walls that's their choice. It does not give them an advantage and it does not hurt the game in any way. Policing what little fun remains in the game is a fast track to failure. They are either hilariously out of touch, or purposefully trying to sink the game now so that they're no longer obligated to work on it.
---
??
---
Why don't you just buy it from the vendor?
---
Vendors (player  must be level 25+) 
---
Camden Park: Sold by vendor bot Chad. 
---
Grafton: Sold by vendor bot Greg. 
---
Vendor bot Responder 
---
Grafton station 
---
Lewisburg station 
---
Welch station
---
Whoa!!! Let's not blame Tood. He's a stand up guy.
---
He's only following Todd's orders.
---
Truthfully, I missed Halloween (NW rewards, Glowing Skull) and Christmas events due to shelving the game last year about this time.  Seems this will be true again for this year.
---
Oh ya, great way to crash it lol
---
A Colossal Problem was added? Because it sure wasn't and will be in "coming weeks".  Besides that, yes, 1 event is a small feature for a game this size. And they couldn't even add that one small feature when promised...
---
I'm not much of a builder... I'll admit, but this is indeed horrible.
---
You want to sue for false advertising? How many hours have you put into this game? How much did you pay for it?  
---
It's just a game man, go play something else if it upsets you so much, jeez...
---
I run a two shot lever action, does more DPS than my bloody version. I can one shot basically everything and down scorchbeasts in 3-4 shots.
---
They added the code for both "colossal problem" and meat weak that's why it was so big, but cuz of this there wont be an update when these go live
---
What a colossal problem!
---
Ever since wastelanders dropped this has been an issue. I hear nothing but excuses I'm in all honesty starting to upset me quite a bit. The scorchbeast queen needs to be fixed ASAP
---
the whole project of fallout 76 was a mess from the very first beginning, to developing, on to release and beyond till today. Heck the game wasn't even planned, it all started with a developer at Bethesda who wanted to make a Fallout 4 multiplayer mod on his own. He showed his coworkers what he did and someone said: "hey, let's make a fallout 4 multiplayer mod addon". Testing goes on, they realized how bad it worked and decided to make a new game where everything is based on multiplayer.
---
Back to your question: they don't care, simple as it is. fallout is a purchased license, nothing the stuido can identifies like they do with elder scrolls. Fallout's sole purpose is to threw cash out after realizing that Fo4 was not that good as they wanted it to be.
---
I highly assume that Fallout 76 was and is always just a playground to test out what they can do to their fanbase and players. An testing site to check out what they can do to make it easier or make more money on upcoming prestige projects like elder scrolls 6 and beyond. i mean, wtf a simple recolor of an Power armor for 12$ was one of the very first atomshop items. changing a color code takes up to maximum 2min's in total.
---
Everyone's FO1 yearly sub comes due at the same time?  I thought it was one year from when you purchased it.
---
Yes it was added in the patch but it's not currently an active event.
---
Don't go for the bloodied lever, get an instigating with 50% limb and 25% AP.
---
Fully uny, no buffs and it does around 1500dmg non-crit whereas the same bloodied does only around 900.
---
Crit HS are around 3-3.5K dmg.
---
You can't do half pulls now which is dumb, cuz they fixed that in the last patch as a % damage to pull str
---
To be fair, handling this mess of a code without creating huge chain reactions is not easy..
---
You can absolutely get it from a stream or pond faster (as fast as you can click, really), but with 5 rads per click.
---
Also, Purified Water is great for drinking or selling (5 caps per water with Hard  Bargain 3) or for making diluted medicines, but for some bizarre reason cannot be used as part of any food recipes I'm aware of. You need boiled water to make soup, for example, which requires turning two dirty water into a single boiled water.
---
Also, lock your water purifiers (and other resource collectors) if you don't want randos looting them.
---
Ostrich syndrome... if they don't see it, it doesn't exist
---
You'll be missed
---
Just let me say: I don't want so many restrictions in the building mode, I loved the fo4 building mode including the glitches.
---
But, this is not fo4 nor a single player game
---
If Bethesda could give us more freedom it would be great. Maybe we get the freedom with the announced shelters. 
---
But in the meantime it is a MMO and if you want all the cool things of a single player game play a single player game. 
---
What have broken pathfinding in your camp to do with me? Nothing, but there will be at least asany people crying about broken pathfinding as people crying about a fixed wallglitch. Development resources then are going to fix the pathfinding instead of introducing new stuff, which gets more people crying about missing content...
---
I play bows. Love them. Just need more ammo
---
The doctors of old believed that putrid air, was what made people sick. If the air smelled or tasted bad, that was the disease cause. Plague doctors wore the masks, and lined the nose cone with good smelling things to prevent them selves from getting sick. They weren't real doctors, not all of them. Most were people who just took the job. They were often used to preform biopsies, and to take count of the infected. Many of the doctors died during the Plagues. 
---
The mask should not in fact stop airborne hazards.
---
Oh trust me i know, but to be fair they put there self in that situation. There was a reason no one made a online game using that engine. 😂
---
Yeah sure. I beat the game a year ago.
---
In the back when times, my biggest gripe was when Feed the People was fixed and it was no longer a server wide reward upon completion.
---
Luckily I started on my secondary. I think my main still has a few thousand in its scrap box.
---
Provide proof of the events existence in the game then. We'll wait. It was added just as the SS pocketed limb mods were. Go find those while you're at it.
---
But it's so pretty!
---
Also fixes the raider quest line. It's literally fixed and cannot be progressed.
---
I'm on AU XB Game Pass as well, mine had to pull down a 50Gb update QQ
---
When you get a chance do us all a favor and scroll to the top of this page then click the "Leave" button...
---
Because of a non descriptive title. Elipses are always auto flagged. 
---
FYI you get two full power armor sets through the main quest, along with with plans to craft 2 more.
---
Not to mention that none of them were multiplayer. Timing issues, validations, scalability are much more critical now that you have client-server game. Now i don't work in the gaming business (Dynamics 365 developer), but if they have their own engine instead of using one readily available, they're bound to have many more issues which have to solve themselves, some of which will impact multiple areas, and you may end up in over your head (makes me flip the table). 
---
It already happens to me sometimes due to platform limitations or maybe because I'm a shitty coder compared to c++ devs (modders or otherwise), I can't imagine these guys being in a better situation than mine in a big game.
---
After getting banned for two weeks and then when my account was unbanned but completely wiped, I was heartbroken.
---
My favorite game and everything I worked so hard for was gone.
---
Now that I've had 2-3 weeks away from 76 and playing other games, I realize how bad and broken fallout is.
---
The ban was needed so I could wake up to the bullshit that is Bethesda.
---
Now, seeing the state of the game still,  I couldn't be happier that I'm done.
---
Could you imagine how pissed someone would be if they sold all their primary ammo type by accident because it had no "Are you sure" check
---
I'm going to tell Liberty Prime on you
---
For me it's downloading the complete 75.6gb though :(.
---
I'm just referring to the previous comment which declared this as an exploit
---
I understand that this fix is frustrating for some of us, but imagine this glitch would have never existed and you never would have been able to put wallpapers on both sides of a wall. 
---
So you have the monitoring tools for AWS Memory and Core usage, latency for all connected clients and can exclude that 20 300% mega glitchy camps do no impact to others performance?
---
Cool
---
Honestly, just being able to wallpaper the opposite side would be best. It SHOULD have been possible before, but now, the opportunity is here. 
---
Remember in Fallout 4 where you couldn't "snap" a wall with a doorway inside a building without Trickeration? That was annoying. So, in 76, they fixed that, and it's awesome. So fix this!
---
What? They doubled the framerate on TLR screen?!?
---
Yeah go play rust
---
This seems like a troll. Why would you not submit bug reports? What does that accomplish?
---
Yep, between the stash limit vendor cap limit there was a LOT of legendary trickle down from power gamers to casuals.
---
Back in my time, there was no gripe at all! Sure, there were problems but they were bearable and we hadn’t been putting up with their bullshit for almost *two years,* but... I first started in October, and the worst glitch I had then was the disappearing corpse glitch.
---
That's why I'm not sure about having a bloodied shotgun in the first place, I can do 2000 damage in one sneak headshot so is it worth having a shotgun that can't get near this number.
---
I know! I'll probably keep one in some corner of my camp, but unless they change it I'll never actually use it.
---
Underrated
---
"But prioritize the walls. For obvious reasons. We cant have these ungrateful customers blatantly cheating like *this*."
---
At the same time as the big "unsubscribe" row after the masks and Fasnacht, they opened the PTS to all PC users and removed the NDA for players. Coincidence or not?
---
You must be talking about something else. They are not in the game.
---
You’re still playing their game and they still already have your money at the end of the day
---
Why do people feel a need to tell the "community" they're leaving? Who cares? I swear I see posts like this every update.
---
I can’t even get into the mine to start the first raider quest. The entrance to Carleton Mine is bugged for me and everyone else I’ve talked to.
---
I’m a first subscriber and started playing right after wastelanders dropped I have a good bit of steel saved up.. I donated 2k just to see what all I got (I saw the spreadsheet before I donated) 
---
3 plans two of which I knew .. some stim packs and water/booze and a quite a few caps.
---
Yep I’m good my auto ffr railway rifle needs the steel more than the BOS it (the rifle) gets me better plans for less steel
---
Thats the one!
---
I'm glad there is a voice of reason to explain. Not a software engineer myself, the only exposure to those types I get is through movies and books where computers may as well be magic: the tech types a few things, slaps the monitor, and the problem is fixed.
---
Go berserker! It's fun to run naked killing everything, especially pvp
---
I stopped buying First a couple of months ago. Yesterday I turned in one stack of steel at Atlas, and after reviewing the rewards that will be my last turn-in for the whole event.
---
Meh, I just started selling the largest amount, back, sell, back sell, failure, back, sell medium amount, sell, back sell, back, sell, failure, back, sell lowest amount, back, sell, back, sell - repeat until failure. Got 50k Ammo 'points' in about 15 minutes. 
---
I DO wish you could just 'sell inventory' on any ammo type and it would figure it out based on the standard sell amounts.
---
ok thanks. I thought I was pretty far along in that but I guess not!  
---
What about good material farming spots?
---
Could it be related to loaded perk cards or other stat boosters your using?
---
Is this like a straw that broke the camels back type of thing?  
---
I'm going to be honest, if the rewards from an optional event not being up to snuff is causing you to quit then I question how much you enjoyed playing the game in the first place.
---
Bugs are always disappointing but if there is an event or something where I don't feel it's worth my time or effort to participate I just don't do it and go do something that I want to do in-game like level up or farm legendary enemies.
---
Strange in numbers perk card, and whether you are on a team or not can affect this.
---
Ahh I see. Still gonna boycott.
---
I think it’s funny out of all the broken things in game, they decide to mess with the builders of fo 76.  I guess “ magic weapon bug” or straight up hacked weapons are not a big priority or the million of other bugs but getting creative with walls is worth the fix above the rest.  I’ve never seen anyone complain about walls before, I don’t get the logic
---
This is the part that affects what I knew how to do, and the wallpaper I just bought a few days ago. 
---
I understand that the problem is much worse than double sided walls; however Bethesda could be trying to give us the building blocks we need rather than removing necessary workarounds.
---
I'm glad the larger problem has gotten a lot of attention though, and hope that Bethesda reverses their changes.
---
Yeah, ive been using bethesda launcher since day 1. 
---
Had this prob rn since patch 21. 
---
Verifying game files fixed it tho.
---
Or just hold B and get out, go back into it.
---
Who cares? They changed the ability to quick change a wall to a door that could be exploited especially in trap bases. As a camp builder I'll just find other ways within the constraints and I'll still buy atoms if I like the stuff in the store.
---
Also cant wear a mask with it.
---
Nah, you really could just put up two doorway walls butted against each other, then swap them for side walls, no flames required.  That's how all the interior walls are currently in my camp because I wanted to wallpaper all my inside walls. Apparently I'm just never changing my camp now, because screw having ugly mismatched walls inside lol.
---
settle down.  Grahm the wandering mutant sells the meat hook plan.
---
Are you telling me all these grindy dailies, cap/scrip/bullion/weight/camp limits, and build restrictions aren’t holding your attention or fun? Don’t you want to chew 5 pieces of bubblegum while naked leveling up next to a fissure site taking a picture in photo mode?
---
Today I learned there was a double wall trick. Damn. Too little too late
---
It'd be insane if they had an ability to quick access stash boxes and Scrap boxes. /s
---
I know Graham can sell the plan for the meat hook. It may also be a reward from the new ATLAS donors provisions. You’d have to find a rewards list to confirm.
---
Yeah exactly. I own basically everything here. The ones I dont own is the ones i really dot care about. This event is a let down.
---
I've never had more than 100 treasury notes, and you have 1000?
---
 Even if you could turn them all in at once you would run out of things to buy and be in the same place you are in now.
---
Yeah, me too. It's a great world and 300 hours or whatever in I'm still not bored by it.
---
Thanks. In your demonstrations you have camp budget shown in numbers instead of just simple bar. Do you know what mod does that?
---
[Choo choo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-fabeNWc5U)
---
(This horse is flogged, but honestly any excuse for Nic Cage).
---
Which is surely the completely wrong outlook to have.
---
All over a wall change? I build most of my play time and this is not a big deal, just another band wagon rage party of Fallout players who think they're ideas and "BeThEsDa BaD". This will pass in no time, just like everything else this community rages about.
---
This Reddit was always a terrible.
---
Had the same issue. The game was corrupted because it was saved to my Hard drive and not my main disk so it decided to redownload the whole game.
---
Some bug/feature of gamepass, no other platform had a patch anywhere close that size. Its almost the full install that had to redownload for whatever reason.
---
No. I'll keep playing my game and ignoring the toxicity on this sub.
---
lol, they added it for the only piece that I don't use deep pocketed on in favor of dense mod.
---
Perfect.
---
It also makes me wonder, is the PTS there for nothing? I got the steam version so I don't have access to it but at least, some testing has to be done...
---
I said it before and I'll say it again. 
---
IF YOU STILL PLAY THIS GARBAGE GAME YOU DESERVE EVERYTHING BAD THAT HAPPENS TO YOU IN IT.
---
I have an L50 PerfectStorm.  It’s not the best weapon I have, but works for tagging and most of the stuff on the west side of the map.
---
What people need to understand is that Bethesda didnt *create* their engine. A very long time ago, they purchased a full ownership license for the ancient Gamebryo engine (its from 95-96 ish.) For the last 25 years they have been tinkering with their private copy of the gamebry code;  bolting on bits and bobs, inserting things with shoe string code, and just generally splicing on things with the programming equivalent of duct tape. And suffice it to say, the engine was in no way shape or form intended to be used for online gaming.
---
This is why bethesda games are the way they are. Especially 76.  As the OPs reference alludes to - and as The Todd himself more or less admitted, Bethesda quite literally does not understand the engine they use. They didnt write the code. They clearly have not mastered modifying it in the ensuing two and a half decades.
---
I thought some rep on this sub-reddit said this issue was to ab addressed 2 patches/updates ago?
---
Break building? please
---
Ok that’s good to here then, I can pretty much just jump straight into it then.
---
They only work if they load in *after* the walls. Same with the glowing pumpkins.
---
Beyond the shadow of a doubt.
---
"Our game" lol ya'll a bunch of crybabies
---
It happens every patch. People freak out over one little thing. Interestingly, the wall thing wasn’t in the patch notes. So for all we know it could be a bug. 
---
Will be interesting to see if any challenges auto complete today and if anyone will notice if they don’t.
---
THIS RIGHT HERE
---
I reluctantly agree, **BUT ONLY BECAUSE YOU ASKED**, you're a bitch.  
---
I agree that it is bad that the walls are only part of the package.
---
Seriously, they fixed the wall?! That means, that i am now stock with the camp im having now, cuz i aint going back to wallpaper on only one side again...
---
Dude, i really feel for you. I have had alot of thoughts like the ones you stated. And i find myself log onto the game less and less. I really like the game and I really hate it on the same time. 
---
I feel like we just lost one of the good guy soldiers in an endless war.
---
Yeah but I could then start grinding for the roll I want out of the plans I buy with the gold
---
Shelves that you can actually put stuff on so we don't have to glitch stuff to make it usable. (If it is too hard beth, then just make shelves all displays, you got that mastered..)
---
Ability to slide chairs up to a table or under a desk.
---
Triangle ceilings, foundations, and roof pieces for more complex builds.
---
Reduce the limit for shops, what is the point. Your shop limit is set by your stash anyway.
---
THIS HAS BEEN ASKED OVER AND OVER, add a freaking spawn point for your camp. I am tired of getting stuck in a freaking foundation. 
---
Ability to fully remove all freaking trees in your base parameter.
---
SQUARE perimeter option! The circle is limiting, and the result is tons of empty space.
---
Posts that go down to the ground, make stilt houses look more believable.
---
Unbroken bathroom fixtures.
---
Ability to add our own photos to photo frames. 
---
Closets.
---
Ability to turn off roaming for allies in your base. " I chime in with a  
---
"Haven't you people ever heard of closing the goddamn door?"  
---
Junk Object, ie in Fallout 4 mods, there was an object which allowed you to place junk anywhere in the world, think a display shelf for one item.
---
Wall-mounted vending shop options.
---
Pillows/Blanket objects for beds.
---
Hi. As someone who has spent time making mods for Bethesda games, I can tell you the roadmap for content is pretty trash. Modded servers are the only way we will see this get better - Bethesda lacks a serious creative vision on how to improve this game and the last patch made that abundantly obvious. But by the time modded servers get here, the game will be dead and Skyrim/Fallout Together will have beat them to it. Nobody asked for an “MMO” anyway.
---
I found one trying to build my camp last night, too. It would randomly spawn foundation floors when it lagged. So if I was trying to place foundation floors down, moved whilst it was loading the previous one it would put a random one where I was looking (not snapped). I couldn't remove them, couldn't event select them. I had to leave the server and come back and then it would be gone.
---
Yeah, rage/cancel culture at it's finest over a change to a game that we don't own.
---
While I respect your opinion on how you feel about decon showers, I am going to have to respectively ask you to shove it. My CAMP is a reflection of my needs and design. Now I have tried to respect players by adding an on/off switch to my shower at my primary entrance. My door is open to allow other players to use it, but primarily it is my CAMP.
---
Why are you still giving them money? Surely you've seen at least one 'vote with your wallets' type speech here before? Seems like you're literally asking for what you're getting.
---
Camps matter. I hope they remove the ability to make floating bases too.
---
Keep everyone from turning in supplies please. Boycott Atlas
---
No problem :)
---
Hmm I do like that BOS dogtag idea. The goal amounts should've been much lower/achievable also. 150 million just for the first goal? Even if the player base was at its peak, they ain't reaching, not to mention the goals after get higher with rarer types of junk, like cork.
---
For sure Bethesda will need to modify/falsify the achieved numbers, or else goals won't be reached and with moral how it is right imagine, imagine if the only pathetic excuse for content that was actually able to be delivered, isn't rewarded because Bethesda were greedy in setting unobtainable goals in order to make people play their game more.
---
Give the Fallout franchise to CD Projekt Red. Change my mind.
---
Nope, the same thing has happened in previous updates. How they keep forgetting to add the things they said they are adding is beyond me. If there is a large uproar(for the said issue), we will get a quick fix, but their MO typically is to push it off till the next patch if they can.
---
"Outraged and depressed" over a change to the wall system? Speak for yourself. I'm a builder and it's not a big deal. Ya'll just love your circle talk and reinforcing "bethesda bad".
---
Yep deffinatly, 30% damage increase x 6 is nothing to be scoffed at tbh.
---
Give it the increase from adrenal reaction, explosive ( if the weapon is), tank buster, lone wanderer, bloody mess and adrenaline and your dealing serious damage per hit.
---
Not to mention drugs and alcohol that also boost dmg
---
Join the masses and boycott atlas.
---
Haha lol never thougt about that
---
This game still has a community??? What's it like over there?
---
Scroll through the top posts from yesterday, you'll see.
---
For wood, Pickett's Fort and Helvetia have, between them, over 50 piles of wood, so just hitting those spots twice each will clear the 100 gather challenge.
---
I'm out. I'm fucking over Bethesda's greed and inability to fix the things that matter. I've been patient since the Beta because I love Fallout, but one of my favorite things is building and they just keep taking tools to a already shitty building system. Add to that removing ability to gain atoms and being channeled into having to get the same thing everyone else does just sucks. Not to mention the Legendary Run feels less like fun and more like work. I have a Fallout First account, but I'm going to cancel that now. Like right now.
---
In short i think its all about spending so much time, and a bit of money (fo1st) and resources, but never be awarded for it. And if thats the case then i completly understand where he/she is coming from
---
Because its not a new item.

You will get &gt;!a full set of raider!&lt; power armor after finishing &gt;!rose’s quests!&lt;
---
You will then get a &gt;!full set of ultracite!&lt; power armor after finishing &gt;!the BOS questline!&lt;
---
Simply they promised it to be ready long time ago and we still have sweet fuck all and I’m not talking only about Colossal problem. There are tons of stuff they promised and we got nothing...
---
I've checked grahm multiple times and his inventory hasn't changed
---
I'm not at the point of deletion if only because of the PITA of downloading this game again.  When I took a break for a couple of months, I got a lot of stuff done IRL and it was nice.  I don't think I'll have trouble stepping away again when I have had enough.
---
Trying making it a blue print and take over a workshop to see if the blueprint still works. That could enable you moving your camp.
---
The best part of me preordering this game was getting the pip-boy kit to build. Logging in the first day, 45 minutes before launch and having to re-download the entire game should have been a huge red flag that we were in for one hell of a ride.
---
Here I was working towards getting a bow set up. They don't even have it so the iron sights or glow sights line up with the crosshairs, so jesus, they just made it worse than bad.
---
Fo1st has the survival tent which can be placed literally right next to the observatory, I know because mine is placed there currently.
---
These things will get addressed. People need to take a deep breath.
---
The fact that bugs all the way from fallout 3 still exist shows it's the same engine with a few tweaks.
---
I’ll have to try this out I’m on pc so I hope it works the same
---
Maybe in patch 33
---
-Wayne Gretzky
---
So 7600 hours multiplied by let's say 0.1kW for an idle tower PC then multiplied by $0.12 for the average US kWh price is about $90.
---
Buying 5000 Atoms for $40 and 2400 Atoms for $20 would be $60 for 7400 Atoms. So buying the Atoms is way cheaper than afking the whole time. Not that any of those two options would be sane anyways.
---
How long have you played? It might seem like a silly thing, sure, but time and time again every single update bethesda gives zero fucks. We see the love their other games get and then we see fo76. Its shit. About the only thing they put any effort into is microtransactions. We had project paradise, thats the end game you all want. Total shit. Wastelanders, better but broken and it looked like the turn of a new leaf. Finishing it only made you realize how little thought went into it. Now we get to the bos, this shit was hyped. Major let down. The only new thijg that they added was 1 npc. It's constant recycling of content. Time and time again. Bethesda beat the shit out of the player base and tells us to go back into the basement. Fo76 is the bastard step child and it shows.
---
Broken, just like the community's spirit.
---
It's more than that, this change takes away the ability to make round/hexagonal buildings, eg: that totally sweet lighthouse that's been making the rounds here.
---
You don't sound toxic at all, I agree we need to put our money where our mouths are and vote with our wallets.  It's the only way to get through to them.  That's why I cancelled.  I don't rule out renewing in the future but only if I see some big changes that will probably never happen.
---
no power armour, if I get an explosive ill be running an explosive.
---
I miss our mods so very much in this game. Much repect
---
If you mention the negatives in certain fallout discord you'll get eaten alive for negativity. It's incredible that people are still defending Bethesda stripping features from the game and monetizing them.
---
I play so I can build, if the building was more evolved i wouldnt have stopped playing fo76
---
Probably in a month's time.
---
Remember, Adrenaline was broken for an entire month.
---
What is called when they say/promise something and its not the case?
---
Oh right Lying. Lying's bad em'kay.
---
I'm not sure i understand.  The event is optional.  I know before i logged on yesterday what the rewards were donating from datamines and knew it wasn't worth my time.  
---
As for fallout 1st its just a subscription that we pay for and we get all the benefits it offers.  Not really sure i follow.
---
I understand being disappointed with the event, but quitting the game over it?
---
Corn soup should give 10 anyway,as it is 5x2. But in beth's math 5x2=6, so it becomes 8 with strength in number.
---
I absolutely feel the same way. I hadn't played in a while and game back for game pass, but this update just destroyed my desire to play.
---
It does, but a lot of us purchased it when it was first available. Myself, I purchased it one week after it became available. That means October will see a huge number of yearly renewals - far more than normal I'd imagine.  If the majority of those users decline to resub Bethesda will notice.
---
Yeah i used up about 1k steel yesterday to see if i could get something worthwhile. But no. It's all junk. 
---
Not going to do that again for a while
---
Did the same thing fist 20 mins in.
---
That was such a big let down. It's only for the chest piece and it replaces the jetpack. FUCK THAT. I'm done with this game for a long time.
---
Yeah, Legendary Run is easy for the most part.  I usually get 3/4 of the challenges done just doing stuff I'd normally do.  When the weekly challenges reset I usually finish them in 1-2 days.
---
I thought I was going mad when I couldn’t find them. Must have slowly gone through that list (and clicked on the torso deep pocketed) 4 times. Infuriating.
---
PS4 also, had issues similar last night.  Server I was on crashed and when I tried to log back in I got a string of immediate disconnects from the server, 5th attempt I got in.  Keep trying would be my suggestion.
---
This guy gets it. 
---
I honestly cannot believe I'm reading this many posts complaining about getting junk for JUNK.
---
Nuked it three times in one sever, everyone left lol
---
Why would anyone give money to this fallout 4 rip off. Truly pitiful.
---
You're absolutely right with everything, but my question was rhetorical.
---
Imagine trying to take a stand on imaginary high ground for not using power glitches in a Bethesda game.
---
I read that in Jeremy’s voice even without the prompt lmfao
---
I’d have been all over it if there were decent rewards such as rare items we may have missed out on or even scrip or legendary modules.
---
I suppose they didn’t want to make the rewards worth duping!
---
It is in the patch notes:
---
&gt;Walls: Fixed an issue that could allow walls to be snapped to overhanging roofs and upper floors, which could be used to create floating walls.
---
I see people a little annoyed not outraged or depressed
---
Either that or farm a shitload from line in the sand and then sell it to other people, then buy ammo and the exact plans you may need from the drops from others, whilst operating at a net positive.
---
I don’t understand why you’re getting downvoted, this is genuine comedy right here XD
---
Does it make a difference if you give a lot at once or if you give a small amount many times? I don't care about the Beret at all.
---
25 to 500(?) gold per 250 steel, plus either mildly useful stuff or a few more caps in vendor trash, depending on what it is.  Up to you to decide if that's a good conversion rate.
---
The only way to deal with the fascists.
---
I would've been down for over looking some of this crap if they'd just added the option to learn T-60 plans. That's all I fucking wanted
---
Yeah, was going to be doing some base redesigns and can't do that now.
---
Except the CMs acknowledged it was a bug months ago. So which is it?
---
Cool. That makes me happy.... wait isnt that 2* combat armor only? Or did you get it from the queen herself?
---
Which part of the building problem are we reporting? That list is far too long to just report it all.
---
That very insightful and probably quite right.
---
Yes, this is how nuke key cards are acquired.
---
Oh shit , my apologies,  I perceived it differently haha 
---
They are definitely bending the community over either way
---
I think that's going to happen naturally, without actively ignoring it. This is a long event with really bad immediate rewards, so I'm guessing people are just going to forget its going on at some point. The funny thing is once the new BOS content drops and we have to grind reputation with them, people are going to be a bit upset if they did turn in a bunch of scrap and they're starting at base level like everyone else.
---
Sloths aren't generally known as the fastest of things.
---
Played since june of 2019 1200+ hours.
---
I guess i just know what I'm getting at this point.. once vault 94 closed i knew they wouldn't cater to endgame players anymore. But i still enjoy lots of the game especially the social and collecting aspect.
---
I guess I'm just surprised that others are still surprised at this point.  Like this update was par for the course...  if I didn't wana put up with it i would've left a long time ago and not continued to spend my time and money on something i had so many problems with.
---
Bro.
---
How can they be this incompetent?? Seriously, how???
---
It usually means a player initiated that from the Enclave Bunker; he is then tasked with taking it down so he can get the Nuclear Keycard. Though I’ve also seen “marked” cargobots even on my private server with no other players on it.
---
It is possible it was killed on the way to your house. I generally will kill the baddies in the immediate surrounding area and then fast travel to my house and it is typically there.
---
Do you think people are going to be buying steel etc to donate?
---
Didn't people say the same thing would happen regarding The Outer Worlds? I swear they said that game was going to completely kill Fallout 76.
---
I know. Personally if they tested everything including cosmetics on the private test server I'd prefer them go back to that
---
I would love to see the players actually come together and boycott that event. How awkward for Bethesda when they have to auto complete the event because it has to happen in order for the next BOS content to arrive. You can do nothing and still get the rewards. I'm only going to log in to get them then go back to playing games of quality and substance.
---
Hackers in NW (both obvious and subtle), hacked weapons during events...
---
But the mods for PC are game changing.
---
The new wall bug that everyone's been talking about, I learned about it from this post, I dom't know if you've seen it but here it is: [Wall Bug Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i3qfd4/congratulations_bethesda_you_just_alienated/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
I have always found this subreddit to be helpful not trollish like every other game. But thanks for proving my point that Bethesda has turned it into hot garbage.
---
You won't get any penalty for picking that lock
---
Can do!
---
Key card crates are typically only a level 0 lock, they do say steal.
---
I'd say likely a glitch, but after the patch who knows what's doing what now.
---
I think I might be almost done with that first lot. :)
---
The only issue I have is that you arent shown how many you have of the current ammo you're trying to exchange.
---
Even you're saying "probably" instead of "will". Think on that.
---
When the time comes to renew I'll be asking myself, "Am I still enjoying this?" Making it harder for me to build what I want in CAMPs to show off to other people (something that can't be done in FO4) is a huge step in the wrong direction.
---

Don't wory about it it's the internet lol I don't take anything serious really. I get where you're coming from im at the point of being done once I hit score 100. I would have already quit for a bit but I'm like OCD and need to finish it 😂
---
This fixed it for me, thank you very much.
---
boycott atlas
---
"You give incentives to new players but what about us veterans?" It's an argument as old as time. Most companies do this. They want new customers and you have already shown you are willing to be a customer. Not saying I agree just saying how it is.
---
Ya'll need to go read the steam and xbox reviews of ESO, its the same thing as Fallout 76. Day one bugs never getting fixed, laggy as all hell servers. They have the Crown shop we have the Atom shop, they even made PVP the same, dueling and a separate PVP mode. They're turning FO76 into ESO and thats what no one wants.
---
&gt; addicted to the Bethesda "secret sauce" gameplay loop
---
You should give 7D2D on a nice community server a try. Especially if you're into building. :)
---
Its not just this event mate, its been building up from before the event. 
---
Thats how i understood the message.
---
Ordinarily not, but who knows. A lot of people (me included) are reticent to sue their stores. As a 1st player I have mountains of resources. but honestly with the lack of interesting comment I am considering cancelling that soon, so I wanna save all I can.
---
I DO however have a lot of stuff I sell regularly, and a cap limit, so I'd definitely buy steel to get rid of some caps and then turn it in for "free" without using my own stores. But maybe I'm a minority. 
---
I'm gonna try it myself regardless.
---
I play D2 and there’s a pretty big difference in the 2. I donated almost 100k fractaline and I got some God rolled weapons that I still heavily use to this day, it was very much worth it for me. From what I understand about this event in 76 is there’s hardly any reward for donating so much. I think it’s more relatable to the Seraph Towers event that Bungie had to change the numbers to because they weren’t getting anywhere near the activity they hoped.
---
It doesn't change if you leave with the same character and load back in. They changed that some time back. So you'd have to visit with multiple toons to see different inventory. It's not particularly rare it just swaps places with things like sledgehammer, super sledge plans. If you can hold out we're about to have meat week and you can infinitely swap servers and refresh his goods. Buy as many as you want then.
---
That doesnt make any scenes to me.  Why would anyone turn anything in if there were no rewards?  Its not like there is an effect beyond a reward.  I suppose maybe if you roll play...
---
I've seen them play on Twitch.  Well, the community reps. And they do things like use Gatling Lasers during Line In The Sand so people can't loot all the meat piles.
---
Even the people that "play" the game don't understand the actual mechanics of the game.
---
:( &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; My  face when i read this
---
:D &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; My face when i remember.... I just have 4 walls and stairs. That's my camp.
---
I play on PC and it crashes probably at least once a day. Most often right before the 'Line In The Sand' event is about to finish so I don't get credit for it.
---
Ah, ok that problem. Yeah that one is bad, I'll back you on that.
---
Agreed on all points. I was just saying to a friend last night that I would prefer it if they just spent 6 months focusing on nothing but bug fixes and polishing.  The game has plenty to do and would be better served by improving QOL and the overall player experience.  I don't understand the people that gripe about "lack of content" in this game - I still have some pre-wastelanders content I've barely touched and all kinds of new stuff I'm not even close to starting.  I guess different people want different things out of this game, and that's OK.  But the "no content" argument doesn't hold water with me.  Yet Bethesda seems terrified that players will leave without a steady stream of new things to do, and we end up with everything half-assed as a result.
---
The best glitch was the unlimited carry weight with pocketed armor.  Oh, the good ol days.
---
Every possible CAMP object in the game. There's very few I don't have.
---
Why are they hyping showcasing camps and builders like Aqua Nova at QuakeCon if they are eliminating building techniques? A builder who relies heavily on glitches to build her beautiful camps, that doesn't even make fucking sense.
---
People defend bethesda like girls defend there abusive spouse. They'll stop when it kills em.
---
LOL FO1st cucks downvoting me. Nice.
---
How's it feel to grease the master gear who doesn't care about you, boys? Keep on paying.
---
The annoyance is less from using these things and more to do with the fact that I keep seeing these players melting legendary enemies (including the Scorchbeast Queen) before the rest of us who don't have access to a Magic Weapon or Legacy Weapon have a chance at tagging those enemies to get Legendary Loot.
---
The BOS content is going to be released whatever we donate or not, the only stuff are affected by the dontaion event are the mediocre rewards for each tier/material. The only decent reward imho is the BOS collectron but as a normal player without FO1st scrapbox I don't have the weight/space nor the time to collect resources for a event I know we're going to fail because those unrealistic numbers. I'm going to miss that collectron but fuck it.
---
Do you remember Patch 16? It was very... eventful.
---
You won't buy fancy interior walls from the atom shop in a bundle for JUST over the cost if the small atom pack if you can do double walls.
---
I'll donate once, rest of the steel I find is for my stuff, Brotherhood of Steal
---
&gt; too much people defending Bugtesdas every move
---
Because there's too much people hating on every Bethesda move and overexaggerating issues. So when someone comes and actually takes a moderate stance to things, they look like Bethesda defender because they are not jumping on the hatetrain without thinking first.
---
Not to put too fine a point on it, but if their actions up until now haven't embarrassed them, I doubt this is going to be the patch that puts them over the top :(
---
They "fixed" this so they can sell "interior rooms" in the atom shop.
---
Something will be released that costs money to "solve" this issue.
---
Part of me kinda wants them to pull the plug on this game. I just completed two days of not playing and it feels good, like a weight lifted off my shoulders.
---
I agree, if you don't enjoy playing there's plenty of other games that are super fun
---
You definitely should, almost certainly worth more than the ‘rewards’ you get from donating
---
Thank you so much, I had no idea they changed that. Hopefully I get lucky on my alt with caps.
---
Ok I was just nervous because of what happened last time lol
---
&gt; Even if you don't have Twitter, just get it
---
Lol have fun playing a broken game 2 years after its release
---
You are right! But it seems, Outer Worlds failed to do it. I wonder why...oh, I know, OW is a singleplayer game F76 is an mmo. Two different style. It is like they try to compare Doom to Starcraft...
---
Bruh. How the hell are you getting upvotes when I get showered with downvotes when I say something about legal rights?!?
---
That's why i started my reply how I did.  I was asking if there was some underlying feelings of dissatisfaction and this was the last straw.    
---
I guess for me, If you've been through all the crap already this is just par for the course.. but if someone is that dissatisfied then they should spend their time doing something else.  For me, if I start feeling that way about a game I won't continue to pump time and money into it until it builds up and I can't take it anymore.
---
Definitely on the same goal mate , I log in for my daily grind of gold and my S.C.O.R.E , currently on 72 and I have enough atoms to finish that now .. thinking of doing it a little softer now,  not really in a rush
---
Can you elaborate please? Not using tesla but curious.
---
Yeah it really saddens me because all they needed to do was rip the entirety of New Vegas, improve the gameplay and guns, and amp up the story. 
---
Also if it wasn't obvious I'm slightly salty about this. I spent £80 on fallout 4 on my old ps4 only to never be able to use it after a Creation Club update caused all my game saves to auto corrupt after 1 hour of game time. You know what support said? YOU GET 100 ATOMS. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
---
Oh whoops, I didn't realize they added it to PC gamepass too
---
Even before patch mine would bug . It would let me run infinite for awhile. Then it would fix itself. Like I ran probably 2 or 3 mins .
---
Don’t forget about that Settler at foundation who greets you by saying “yo”. I’m pretty sure “yo” wasn’t used as a greeting in the 1950’s/60’s.
---
Pretty much diluted Christmas gifts.
---
I dont even go for rep or gold anymore its just not worth it too me atm
---
I mean what the fuck am I reading? I preordered, I took off work for release day into the weekend. I fought the haters, and fan boy's so hard but finally accepted this is a piece of shit. Left the reddit a month later and now that this hit the front page I figured I would read the comments. REALLY. WHAT THE FUCK? it sounds like you can't do anything you want to do unless you break some mechanic, glitch the game, cheat, or abuse some kind of bug to get an advantage. Why subject yourself to something this fucking stupid? Yall are paying a monthly subscription for it too right, or did they fix that? Jesus.
---
Well you shut him up lmfao.
---
Haha damn Dorsey!
---
My sloth took a day to get here. And it is possible it can be killed so
---
I have despised the Brotherhood from the beginning.
---
I'll be damned if I donate one single item to them.
---
The reward is that you get to stop playing for several weeks.
---
I've had this since well before patch 21. The bar will work fine for a long time and then show considerable lag even when the game itself is playing fine. Makes fights rather interesting when using high VATS cost weapons.
---
nope, no man sky had this feature before they released cross platform lol and hello games is a smaller studio compared to Bethesda but they managed to do it with ingame % banner that's working very well even after the crossplatform update..
---
That already was fixed with this patch. They’re pretty much normal now. Much less satisfying but to be fair, rather than doing say, 500 damage between its pellets, each pellet WAS 500 damage. It made them super satisfying to use, but they did fix that with 21
---
This sub has been toxic and troll like so it’s dawn of creation. This use to be a sub that I would see posting only toxic content for months on end. I put this right beside PCMR IMO.
---
I'm sure the Colossal Problem and Meat Week events are lovely...but the entirely of Deus Ex Mankind Divided was only a 47Gb download.  This minor patch to the PC Game Pass version of the game was 49.6Gb.
---
That is in no way reasonable.
---
Pretty sure mine has been erratic and like this since release.
---
Yeah I agree
---
I could maybe give yo a pass but the game is soaked in the same types of inconsistencies. They all add up to a feeling that something is off
---
&gt;  I gotta admit they pulled me back in with FOMO
---
So much this. I played through Wastelanders, did the dumb rep grind, and was unenthused about the whole Legendary Run bullshit; and yet, here I am, logging in daily and even briefly resubscribed to FO1. 
---
The problem is that - as I'm sure you'd agree - underneath all of the bugs, bullshit, and garbage MTX items, FO76 is somehow still a thoroughly enjoyable world to inhabit. So we grit our teeth and deal with it, because there is fun to be had here and it's worth having.
---
But I swear... if I described my relationship with this game without mentioning it was a game I'd probably be told to seek therapy for battered spouse syndrome.
---
Bethesda
---
Personally, I'd believe the dataminers over the CM, especially since it has never been fixed.
---
Dude you described it perfectly. Some intern got a list of shit and figured the best fix was double walls. No real dev could actually be this incompetent.
---
Well, starting with the beta they took away fast travel mats, then early on they took away the trick with using campfires to place foundations, then they made it even harder to stack foundations after that.  There have been constant problems with turrets and tamed animals.  They mucked up the way stairs work and made it so that you have to scrap everything attached to the stairs if you want to move them.  They've cut down the number of areas on the map you can place a camp.  And now the latest one that everyone is pissed about is removing the ability to fake a double-sided interior wall.
---
I'm sure I've forgotten other issues.  These are all things that we never should have had to work around in the first place.  They seem to think that more freedom in camp building will lead to some kind of exploitation, but exploiting what?  With PVP basically a forgotten relic at this point, and without any real boss fights, I don't understand what they think we could possibly exploit.
---
Woodchuck and fort prickett exist.
---
Wait, was that in the patch notes? If that’s the case, then yea fuck that. That would’ve been a perfect fix. Fire faster but with less force
---
Gold is a  must currently!! Bought up all the SS and T-65 stuff ... but them helmets 😥 too expensive so I've left em till last
---
Okay so I am a vault dweller from pretty much the launch of this game and have learned to just play and enjoy what I can. The grind sucks blah blah blah.  It's a game, right?  Made by imperfect humans. I am no way an advocate for the developers but a realist, old wise man who at 58 y/o (and my wifes displeasure) still enjoys being a gamer. 
---
So, there may be 2% of the overall 300,000(?) gamers in F/O76 are on this sub.  Bethesda may get wind of your comments, but honestly they are not going to care about the comments of a small percentage of the overall player base because people will play, and if they don't they will open up the vault flood gates for a free weekend and get a new base.  Share your grievances to get them off your chest if it makes you feel better.  The F/O series means a lot to us who have played over the years, hopefully it will improve but they can't make everyone happy.
---
Haha yeah i was exactly the same the first time i opened one. Not really sure why it has the warning on it to be honest
---
I went and donated 250 steel just to see what it was like.  Got some booze and a grenade.   I left it there.   Won't be back.
---
Yea... that is not the same as no longer being able to change wall type
---
No Power Armor, but I did see the delayed visual score pop up notifications earlier whenever I was in a transaction/menu.
---
When I went to go buy mine, I thought that the pocketed mod for the chest piece was what they added. Biggest waste of 500 gold. It replaces the jetpack, fuck that bullshit. What a joke.
---
Then I'll chime in as someone who plays both killer AND survivor... the game is HEAVILY killer favored so much it's not even funny. Only thing survivors got going for them is looping, and that's *if* the killer lets themself be baited into it. Very few killers are semi balanced, the rest....well let's put it this way, I can take a single perk ghost face and slaughter a decked out, full  SWF red rank group within minutes. 
---
Thats just game balance, then you have shit like why the fuck is it still a peer to peer system (with all the fucking licenses they constantly grab there's no fucking way they don't have money to make legit fucking servers), lobby bugs that require you to constantly quit out of the entire game to fix, etc. Lots of things that frankly, shouldnt exist
---
Hardly, when I get them from Murmur or events.
---
The Gamepass version has a significantly different file structure when compared to Steam or Beth launcher version as it is technically a rental and not a game you actually own so every time there is an update the Gamepass version will be bigger because MS has to adapt the patch to the Gamepass version before pushing it to the user.
---
I agree with this, they literally dont care lmao
---
Basically
---
No it does not, I spent 5k and got loads of alcohol, stims, grenades, and some plans from vendors.  Totally not worth it.
---
I be playing both, as i enjoying this game with my group of mates. Its like people cant believe others can play more than one game.
---
I have 4k sitting on me I only buy from merica boy then dont bother
---
Instructions unclear, when i deleted c:/ system 32 windows got weird.
---
wat do?
---
You’re so right to be honest, and it would only be toxic if the comment wasn’t well deserved. It’s getting to the point where I feel like even if everyone just stopped paying them through the atom shop and F1st, they’d just give up instead of trying to actually fix the damn game.. that’s what really saddens me
---
God no - when they take a deep breath, it's usually just to start screaming again.
---
Just FYI it shows up as “power armor chassis” in your inventory. It has zero weight until you deploy it
---
I enjoy the game, but I don't play that often. When I do play video games I start with fallout. Today I played all day, I didn't really notice a difference. Nothing in my camp changed so that part doesn't bother me. I will most likely renew 'cause I don't plan on leaving anytime soon. Still super fun to me
---
I also havnt bought like anything yet
---
it saves you time, Bethesda rarely responds to its bug reports if ever.
---
You don't have to, it's just a suggestion. And, your choice is your choice
---
Crackheads.
---
Sneak. Also... dumb question.... but what is your health sitting at?
---
Are we talking about the same thing? Bunch of random numbers when having specific legendary effects? (i.e. limb dmg?) If so, then I guess it's time to stop playing this damn game. Unless they also fixed the SUPER op heavy guns affected by the same bug..
---
I agree with it.  I started playing March after the release. I have never and will never buy a Bethesda title on launch day - let other people beta test their crap. Even doing that I've never played a Bethesda game long without mods. Even my copy of Fallout 76 is modded, though what can be done is far more limited and UIX related.
---
I like building.  I've been neglecting Minecraft - perhaps I'll get back into that.
---
Yes, it definitely seems like they don't play the game the way everyday players do.  They seem very disconnected from the realities of how the game is played and what players want.  I always think of the time someone pointed out that some of the CMs or other low-level Beth employees were playing on a livestream and they were using normal weapons and buying ammo from the vending machines at train stations.  No one, and I mean NO ONE, does that.  It's laughable.
---
It just seems like Bethesda is going the backwards route with the patches and content, instead of making the game better, the patches always seem to break it. Instead of releasing new content to enrich the game, they just seem to find new ways of making the game more excrutiatingly lame. 
---
I donated 500 steel to the BOS last night, and I got a bunch of floater grenades, a mole miner gauntlet plan, a laser gun plan, and a couple of bottles of liquor.  No more steel for this event from me.
---
 They're capable of providing level based rewards with random mobs,  there shouldn't be any reason that they can't provide level based rewards for these events.
---
I didn't say a damn thing about leaving.  I said I'm withdrawing my financial support.
---
Apparently, some of the Underarmours have been converted to Outfits instead, or at least the BoS Fatigues were affected by the change.
---
Not sure if this was mentioned in advance, or just slipped into the patch notes, but it seems to have caught a lot of players by surprise, and some of them are rightly annoyed at losing the mats and stats from upgrading them.
---
Thanks to these posts I've seen today, I'm doing it
---
Had a stroke reading this....
---
If you don’t report a bug, you aren’t really in a position to complain IMO
---
There's no way bringing this whole community together. There are people who are defending Bethesda no matter what. Then there are people who jump on every issue and present it as something supercritical. And then there's the silent majority who simply doesn't care or think before raging and realise the actual severity of these issues. Yet, the silent majority gets also accused of defending Bethesda, because they don't jump on the hatewagon. Trying to talk sense into the current overexaggeration rewards people with labels like "bootlicker" or "shill". How do you expect the silent and reasonable majority of this community to join your cause when you harass them in the first place for seeing things differently?
---
I personally find this patch really sloppy and it shouldn't have been published. Yet the actual severity of the issues is overplayed. Tiny portion of players who use camp glitches get falsely labelled as "all camp builders". In the grand scheme of things, this patch is crap, but it's also harmless to the regular player. The worst issue objectively are the major performance drops in some areas. Yet the outrage crowd doesn't talk about it, because it's not a juicy topic and cannot be mislabelled to take a jab at Bethesda. I cannot join a crowd that act before they think and are basically doing the right thing for the wrong reasons...
---
If you have herbivore/carnivore for a particular food it boosts the benefits. For you likely herbivore.
---
If you have strange in numbers, that boosts your mutations (such as herbivore) which in turn, will make the benefits better. So team up, the stranger the better
---
I feel exactly the same, older dude, loved Fallout 4, FO76 firs preorder, love building. Cancelled my FO 1st today and they won't see any more of my "disposable" income.
---
Herd mentality mutation also modifies this as well I hear
---
I didnt think of it being connected, but did notice when I exited power armor last night i had a bunch of dings come up at once. Maybe that is how they "fixed" the UI complaints in the pa?
---
I whole heatedly agree with the sentiment. Bethesda is out of touch. Their community folks don't Seem to understand the mechanics of the game even. They have ultra casual builds and use weapons in events that screw over other players. They also run around and disrupt efficient clearing of group events, behavior that in another MMO with group chat would have been corrected. And they just screwed over the builder community by taking away tools that aren't exploitive, even I'd they do depend on a buggy engine.
---
But I'm going to push back on some of what you said. As someone who works with devs for products that are in many ways less complicated than an MMO, you are crazy if you think Adrenaline should have magically taken a day to fix. 2-3 weeks to fix makes sense to me depending on how it was broken. The SBQ cripple issue isn't as important as other bugs either. Clearly, they have some room for improvement with how they are prioritizing work and testing results but saying nonsense things about the time to fix a bug will make a dev stop reading, which is the opposite of what we want.
---
Have you seen the new Grounded game that released last week for Xbox and PC? That had a dev team of 13. Been in development for only 2 years. Despite these facts, it looks better, plays smooth, and is more interesting than fallout 76, and it pains me to say that considering how much of a fan of the franchise I am.
---
Its just there as a way to track your hours played.
---
Aha, so it was listed in the patch notes but isn't in the game actually, just like SS pocketed limb mods were added...
---
I never said I was going anywhere
---
Agreed.
---
Another player mentioned their BOS fatigues becoming an outfit and not an under armor any more. Maybe this has to di with the new BOS outfit being added to the Atlas event rewards. As for other under armor, my Shielded marine wetsuit still has all its stats. What other under armor did you check?
---
I'll continue to support a game I like regardless of the outrage culture in this sub because everyone of you will get over it and still be on the game and on the sub. It's "cool" to be outraged apparently.
---
A building bundle with double sided walls that costs slightly more than the small bundle of atoms. They just want $. My goal is a total boycott of the event, lets see it fail.
---
Bethesda's real life version of forgetting to include the attachment with the email. 
---
It's like there is one dude that works there because of some sort of court mandate. So much missed QC'ing and small, yet easy to check before something goes down the shoot for delivery.
---
well after reporting countless bugs I think we are. also not a complaint on my part simply a statement explaining that Bethesda bug reports are a waste of time.
---
Exactly hahah
---
FUUUUUUUUCK I remember that! God damn absurd
---
Stuff that's been removed/restricted since Fo4   
---
- Non-foundation floors placed on ground without snapping to stairs  
---
- Free placement of walls without snapping to floors  
---
- Free placement of stairs and balcony/fence pieces    
---
- The metal railings from the concrete wall set   
---
- More snapping points (3 per edge, IIRC) for interior stairs from barn/warehouse sets  
---
- Upper floors snapping to the top of walls without the need for stairs   
---
- Delayed off switch   
---
- Logic gates (at least give me XOR so I can do doors)
---
Give me back my double walls beth!
---
Yeah, both are. I donated 500 steel last night, and got a pile of junk returned. I'd rather have kept my junk instead of being given junk, at least I wanted my junk.
---
right behind you, bud. renewal is on the 20th. getting all the scrap i can until then.
---
That’s what it’s used for, but it’s an actual challenge with an actual reward. People that get the challenge just don’t get to know how many hours they have after that?
---
This.  It's not actually supposed to be an "achievement".  If the reward was significant then people would be rubber-banding controllers while they sleep for months on end causing all sorts of server-related issues while they AFK to get it.
---
Leaving the server gives it the opportunity to fall thru the map on load in...if he never shows up and you tame another creature, stay on the server
---
Health is sitting at 20% where Nerd Rage kicks in. And you think I should be running automatic instead? I always did a semi-auto build for the sake of saving ammo, is there a higher DPS or something?
---
I did take a break, and a fairly long one.  They lured me back in about a month ago.  I'll probably be taking another break after I finish the Legendary Run.
---
Yeah, it just boggles my mind.   I've kinda had it.   I traded 450 of my atoms for the last three ranks in the legendary run.  I'll be checking the roadmap.   I'll be back when some new content is introduced.   In the meanwhile, I'm off to play something else.  This really does feel more like a chore than fun.   Congrats on the stupid caps and bugs, Beth.
---
Ha! I was reading a comment about the other tool they took away, my apologies. Got confused there.
---
I wish enough people would come together to actually boycott the game but quite frankly I think there’s too many people of the ‘get over yourself’ attitude or those who don’t care enough to partake.
---
Ok, that was always allowed.
---
It may be easier if you recreate your build on:
---
[Nukes and Dragons Build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)
---
A two-shot rifle should definitely be doing less than a bloodied. Others may be able to help, but usually the build’s problem isn’t that your missing a good perk as much as you’re filling it with bad ones. Those are harder to find without a full build.
---
Here’s how this works, at least since beta. Bethesda Maryland studios began work on this game and had about 70-80% of it done when everyone was put on the Starfield project. Fallout was then shipped to Bethesda Austin for the finish work. Austin was a new, small studio that had recently been purchased. None of the people there had ever worked with the engine. None of them had any experience with Fallout. These are the same people who are working on the game today. They’ve had two years of experience, so they’re marginally better than they were when this whole thing started, but their still a small group of devs trying to stay afloat. It’s a dumpster fire, and every update they put out seems to add fuel to the fire. I’ve got almost 4000 hours in game, level 1043 and I’ve seen it all. Is the game better now than at release? Without a doubt. Is it the game it COULD be? Not even close. I love the franchise. I’ve been a fan since 1997, but Bethesda is slowly chipping away at the goodwill of the fan base. If this had been a once or twice thing, it wouldn’t be a problem. However, we’re seeing these problems with every...single...update, even after the addition of the PTS. If you stick with the game for a couple of more months, you’ll see. Welcome to the party :)
---
And Covid has also disrupted everything. So you know.
---
Bloodied works best at just below 20%, low enough to activate nerd rage, high enough to give a small buffer against incoming damage. If you die and respawn you will still have low health but it will sit higher than optimum until you add some extra rads.
---
Also I find sitting back and using a little Stealth works wonders in maintaining the multiplyers for very high damage. Keeping in caution or better will add that 2x or better effect for superior averages.
---
They probably will, eventually.
---
Right now, they're probably avoiding this sub like the plague to avoid the hate being thrown there way right now, which isn't surprising considering they've done the "Head in the Sand" strategy a few times, becoming more active again as new content approaches, and becoming quiet again after each major patch.
---
On the other hand, venting on Reddit isn't any more likely to get their attention either, but it's cathartic.
---
People screaming about bugs and glitches and demanding a response literally within minutes or hours of a patch just don’t understand how software patches work. Complicated software has a tendency to have unintended bugs when you start making changes, and you can’t find them all. Nor can you just roll back tiny pieces in most cases. It’ll be okay, nothing that broke was critical or mattered to the great majority of players.
---
Morally gray choices, doing the lesser of 2 evil things. Has been one of the best aspects of fallout before F4
---
I feel all weapons need a skin for fuck sake the dragon has one....
---
they got a huge amount of feedback from the PTS but they just hose to ignore it.
---
&gt;This double wall thing I'm hearing about I literally learned about today... 
---
I knew about this glitch, but because I discovered it myself. I had completely no idea about the other glitched that got fixed. And I'm quite interested in campbuilding.
---
This just shows that a tiny minority of players were using these glitches and that most of this camp outrage is fake just for the sake of being angry at Bethesda. Instead of complaining about bugs that plague this game and are affecting the enjoyment of many (like fast-travel bug, SBQ crippling, various weapon glitched, NW hackers), we are circlejerking about a meaningless issue (meaningless in comparison).
---
Why are we shouting "REVERT CAMP FIXES NOW!!!" when we should be shouting about fixing more important bugs? This community is doing the same shit as Bethesda. Just like Bethesda are fixing low-impact glitches, we are also caring the most about fixes for low-impact glitches.
---
at this point, all we get in patches are fixes to bugs from the previous patch and new bugs for the next patch to fix, and we get to wait over a month for each one. it's ridiculous.
---
Again, not needed? maybe... probably...
---
But lets be honest, most camps are just basic stuff. I never \*ever\* saw a round camp in game myself, and lets be even more honest, most camps are just ugly, unrealistic flotting immersion breaking crap.  
---
So, I am not sure this is an "entire community" thing.   
---
It's a niche thing.   
---
Not a lot of people enjoy using time consuming tricks just to align stuff in a not intended way. (note: I don't say it's a bad thing to do that at all, but I just see a disconnection between reality and all this shitstorm...)
---
My hot take?
---
They totally forgot that you could find it in the game already.
---
I thought about trying that game,  but when I saw, "Bethesda", it was knee-jerk "no" on my part.  Sounds I was right.
---
I came here to ask about this.  i just started experiencing it (first flamer build so that could be a causing factor but i noticed it a TON yesterday) but i get it with shotguns too.  I have even seen it with a few melee weapons.  to be sure its the same thing what happens is 1 of 2 things.
---
thing 1 exactly as you descrbe attacking enemy all going well all the sudded enemy heals and wont take damage for a period of time
---
thing 2 like the above but a neat little twist enemy appears to take damage normally down to a sliver of health and then becomes unkillable and glitchy for a period of time.  
---
this is game breaking! so much ammo wasted.  I feel for the wall guys i really do but this is basic gameplay.
---
Honestly, this didn't seem like a very complex patch/new content in my mind. It's like the longer this game goes, the more they whiff on fundamental changes. Maybe they want to get this thing to bleed out so they can move on to something else.
---
You do not benefit from inspirational unless there is an actual person in group with you. This is very easy to test ingame. Cap two workshops, let them fail the defend event. Run both retake events. The first in a group without inspirational equipped. The second in a group with it equipped. You will get the same xp for both.
---
Lone wanderer does not function if you are grouped, regardless of how many people are in that group. The ap portion is easy to test if you encumber yourself, the dmg portion is testable but less easy to quantify.
---
Herd mentality works if you are in a group regardless of how many actual people are in that group. This is just plain obvious.
---
The water well you can buy with gold bullion from Foundation is actually a great non-rad source for dirty water. When u click the “drink” option and while the animation of the bucket is coming up, spam click the “collect” button to get around 22-26+ waters in one go. You can easily get about 100+ dirty waters in under a minute. 😬😬😬 Just thought I would share.
---
Man that was a lot of effort to say nothing.
---
Ah okay i get your point now. And yeah you are probably right about stoping sooner then. Some of us just likes to keep our hopes up for a better game (myself included), for the love of the franchise, eventhough it keeps hurting us. And one day the cup is just full
---
Shame really, I like the skin very much.
---
 From patch notes

---
Well, I think the logic goes something like this:   Is there any way this could hurt our bottom line?   Fix it immediately!   Does it not hurt the bottom line but can destroy players' experience with the game?  Who gives a F.
---
Yeah, a friend taught me that exploit. I expect that bug will get fixed, but without addressing the basic inadequacy of high-cost items like the well or rain barrel.
---
&gt; Apply new texture
---
... and I guess this new texture just created itself?  That's handy.
---
Yea donated my 250 ....saw the rewards.  Nope.  Until they actually add working skins, backpack plans, or anything else that is fun or tradeable ill be doing my scrip, gold, and score daily runs and then onto my back log.  Event the main event rewards are horrible.  Ive only done one meat week and I found it unbearable for a stupid hat and a two hand that takes up 20 stash wt.   I don't need to do it twice.
---
Yeah that’s a good point, but most companies also listen to their player base, destiny devs interact with their games’ subreddit to at least acknowledge gamers’ concerns. Others do podcasts to talk about this stuff, hell it seems all but Bethesda actually put the stuff they say they’re gonna put in with updates, or at least give us a heads-up that it’ll be delayed. I’d much rather Bethesda do what Bungie have done with their latest upcoming DLC: push it back a few months to make sure it’s gonna go down really well, instead of drip feeding us a pathetic excuse for content that’s going to drive away what little community they have left.
---
I disagree. Takes like 15min tops to walk from line in the sand to atlas with 250+ steel even over-encumbered and when you get there you get rid of it.
---
It always just seems to be the loudest people that complain about things after every patch. It’s always the same. Patch releases, there’s a bombardment of angry posts and comments about how the game is literally going to die because of [insert issue of the week here], people get their upvotes and blow off steam, and everything is back to normal in a week. 
---
I think the community event is really cool, and a neat way to naturally build up the story leading into the BoS return. Not to mention this exact kind of event with real tangible world changes has been something I’ve seen requested on here numerous times, and now that it’s here it’s suddenly something nobody wanted?? Hell, the last community event with killing the shit-ton of Scorched didn’t even reward you with any immediate rewards like the ATLAS donor provision
---
Good advice here, folks! It also begs the question of what kind of frigging client are we really dealing with here anyways? If this game is so limited so as to have them resort to underhanded and senseless inhibitors as we have now, what does the future hold for us? As i see it, there is barely one spark keeping this dream alive. This client must suck hard and I don't think we know the half of it. 
---
There's also the fact that not only does Bethesda ignore our cries for real bug fixes and game stability but they basically ignore us period. This is no way to run a business and if Bethesda does not come down off their cloud and soon there may be no way to save it.
---
I bought the yearly server and also am a FO76 monthly sub, that changes as of today; they will not get another cent from me until their attitude gets serious about making this game better first and foremost. Enough with the insanity already, you guys should be embarrassed at being such a failure.
---
I made my build on there.  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=6f433be&amp;d=la2lu2l71lt2li2cu2ir2sf2pd2pk2pl2pp2ei2eu0a12sg2am2au2pe2a01&amp;m=c2f836&amp;am=18-18-18-18-18&amp;wp=w5&amp;wm=142737&amp;n=Lemon%27s%20Bloody](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=6f433be&amp;d=la2lu2l71lt2li2cu2ir2sf2pd2pk2pl2pp2ei2eu0a12sg2am2au2pe2a01&amp;m=c2f836&amp;am=18-18-18-18-18&amp;wp=w5&amp;wm=142737&amp;n=Lemon%27s%20Bloody)
---
Probably not.  Comparable to the amount of Settler/Raider stuff you earn in the base game which is... almost nothing.
---
At the same time, people generally like the BoS way more than the Settlers.  And the Settler aesthetic was, to be blunt, kind of dumb looking anyway.  Sweater and necktie with overalls?  Really?  It would look passable in BioShock Infinite, but not a 1950s future world.
---
Yeah i get it.  I think partly I'm just numb to it after years of online gaming and having experiences like this.  I think a lot of people coming from other Bethesda single player games with not much experience in online gaming could see things differently and I think that's probably where the disconnect could be.
---
I suspect the problem is with their validation process... I do software development in my day job.   Each new feature or bug fix gets a separate ticket and once implemented, a person is assigned to validate it.  Either someone isn't doing their job in the testing area, or Bethesda does not have a testing process at all, leaving it to developers to verify their own features/bugfixes.  Either way this is indicative that they have a very immature development process, so the fact that anything actually releases in a working state is a miracle anyway.
---
Just use the red barn door wall piece with the door. I never used the double wall trick and I had rooms in every camp I built. It stood out and didn't match the rest of the wall paper, but whatever, one wall being a different pattern isn't the end of the world.
---
I’m not into the whole C.A.M.P. building scene, but I would say that a majority of the player base is. That’s a huge chunk of the community that’s upset right now.
---
And then you open up the BOS packages and realize they are re-skinned holiday gifts.  Rare plans my ass!
---
Yeah, I grabbed 5x of those rewards and was like whelp, there's no point in this nonsense. If there's anything good to be had, I'll just wait for the dupers to do what they do because creating an endless loop of go fetch is not new content.
---
It just works.
---
Authentic Bethesda experience. That's what happens when you have modders do QA for you for decades then release an online game on 20 year old spaghetti code and prohibit those same modders from fixing it.
---
That would be great, if it were helping a cause, the whole point of this event is to get a couple of apparel items, that’s it. It’s not like donating steel and cork is gonna save some starving children somewhere, we’re supposed to be throwing away our useful resources in return for what? Alcohol and floater grenades?
---
I knew I wasn't going to hit 100 when Seasons started. I got to 75 yesterday and the constant grinding and now overused Challenges for score is boring. Human imagination can be limitless even given a context of "Challange quest in Fallout 76 given this location". It's NOT HARD.    
---
Your CAMP looks awesome!
---
The good news is after a month or so you’ll have most of the things you want. You’ll walk by the treasury machine, tip your hat and keep moving. But yea, the scrip grind is the real limiter
---
Just found out that Steam thinks none of my purchases are valid, so I have to buy it again.
---
Screw this, I’m going to EGS.
---
Which is sad really. 😢
---
It just confuses me how some people are oneshotting everything, or those people who shred the Scorch Beast Queen instantly and I am doing less damage than I was doing before. I will certainly try using stealth when I can.
---
You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.
---
there is no reason for me to even donate my junk, all I am getting is a mystery box that already has plans that I already have learned either through earning them, finding them in the world, or just buying them from a vendor in white springs. 
---
all that I get is a loss of junk, a box that has weight. and when opened, a .25 weight already learned blueprint that will stack up with my other known blueprints in my inventory to add more unnecessary weight to my already close to carry capacity limit for my character. 
---
I remember dropping my blueprints just to see how much they took up, it turns out, I had over 30 weight in known duplicate plans on my character. and I can't sell them to vendors and players aren't going to buy a common plan that they could find in the waste, but I have no idea which of my hundreds of blueprints are common, uncommon, rare, or super rare.
---
Of all the things people complain about, this is the one that makes people look the worst.
---
Day 1/BETA: I stopped playing when the summer challenges came. Took Atom and reduced it, and the grind to get everything would be like working full time plus some more. 
---
Fuck that shit, I want to have fun not be limited by stash, time gates, cap, scrip, and gold bullion hard limits. 
---
I payed for 1st for 2 months but spread out between 3 when Wastelanders came out. If they got a cheaper option for just a scrap box I’d get it. I’m not paying 12.99 a month or 100 bucks a year.
---
collector’s edition of the game should have had Fallout 1st free for a year. That would have been cool
---
And, until it was released on Steam, PC.
---
So that's 2 out of 3 platforms that don't have that tracking ability.
---
I can't even give most of those plans away.  Rare plans my ass ... where's the Insurgent Outfit plan for example???
---
You learn the mod from scrapping meat hooks. There IS a plan, but scrapping is the easiest way to learn it.
---
You know I might just do that today. Get more people to boycott this trash
---
So me wanting fewer restrictions, i shouldn't speak out about that ?
---
I think bethesda is partly to blame for people being hooked on the game. It feels very much like a slot machine when you learn the gameplay loop, the rewarding chimes to remind you of your never ending chances to get certain items. 
---
Exactly the same things gambling machines do except Bethesda don't want just your money (though they want some of that too) they want your attention. 
---
They want you staring endlessly at a menu pondering how to deal with the miniscule storage size
---
They want you spending 20 minutes mashing the use key on the same loot youve taken 100 times and a slight chance at a good safe RNG
---
 They want you or rolling through vast cycles of randomly created weapons, always chasing that god tier drop. 
---
Chasing the dragon at every level of thought. No freedom to do anything since doing anything means using resources you need. Want to collect? Here's 800 for EVERYTHING
---
Want to experience this cool fallout event? WAVE MOB ENEMIES AND RNG.
---
If that is the case, it would really be a poor decision. Alienating and punishing legit players, while not adressing the real issue. Either way, it's very hard to find a good reason to part with my junk for this event.
---
I have a similar build but auto commando instead of semi-auto rifleman. If you really want rifleman then I’d use a lever action or fixer, but full auto just seems way stronger to me. 9 points in commando would seem like overkill to me.
---
There are two main problems about the event.
---
1) we don't have enought weight/storage to farm those massive numbers of junks the event is asking, and this have been a problem that us players have been complaining since long ago. 
---
2) the numbers are unrealistic, the game doesn't have enough active playerbase fo fill those requeriments. 1-2 million should be dificulty doable but 100-200 millions for each material is ridiculous.
---
It's not being selfish, it's being realistic. Atlas event is going to fail whatever we participate or not.
---
I'll miss ya, buddy. Take care.
---
You must be new to this game. You act like outrage isn't warranted at their continued incompetence. 
---
But sure, you support that sinking ship buddy.
---
It's all just icky. Even the new wannabe BOS character is bollocks. So much for my greatest pleasure on the game as well, camp building. I'm so done.
---
I think people forget that the real way to boycott is not spending money. Making a game unenjoyable for others is not an appropriate way to boycott one's  favorite game, it's what kills the game and destroys it. There will always be trolls trying to get into the boy's hole...
---
So they can make it seem like they're "fixing" things on paper
---
And so they can resell "features" later.
---
Don’t forget u/valseek
---
Exactly! Bethesda really hit us with a low ball here. Im definitely not contributing to this.
---
project clean appalachia, to prepare for Wastelanders (at least, the initial release before it was delayed six months). all you had to do was kill scorched and scorchbeasts. there werent even individual rewards for doing this, just the community ones.
---
They’d should have compensated players who already had it modded. Most likely because of the bulkier details you liked and the fact that it isn’t special enough to warrant a stat boost like ss underarmor bethesda decided it made more sense as a outfit, and didn’t want to deal with the hassle of making an underarmor and costume version that would need a way to clearly differentiate the 2. 
---
Seems like they could’ve just had a toggle for armor to appear or not, since it already disappears when applying costumes
---
They don’t need it, they’re lying to us so they can sell it to the vendors for drug money!
---
Its a game, give up your 250 steel and move on unless you like paying for the crap they give you in return.  No matter how much they get they will validate the totals in the end to keep the BoS event moving forward.
---
I think making it 760 is fair and looks better than 20.  It wasn't meant to be a serious challenge, just a way for players to track how much time they've spent in the game.  If you make the reward too good, you would encourage some people to just run AFK bots the whole time, much like what we see in Nuclear Winter.
---
Gonna need a link, since somehow I've missed this Lighthouse build.
---
My BoS RP character is who Elder Lyons will base his philosophies on, so definitely the good guys.
---
The list is out?
---
I feel like your comments should be sent to Bethesda and every morning they should be have to hear it blared over their office intercom while they drink their first coffee.
---
I'm not a believer of constant posts about trivial things like wonky ammo machines and walls.  Those issues are symptoms.  Fix the thing causing the problems, the antiquated, had-a-good-life-but-should-now-be-put-out-to-pasture software that just makes their lives and jobs more difficult.
---
And its win-win for them.  Todd could YET AGAIN port friggin Skyrim.  He loves doing that.  If he could port Skyrim to my kitchen mixer he would.
---
You've been ingesting too much shoeshine if that's the best you can respond with when asked to provide proof of your claims.
---
How CAN anyone be interested in doing it? Sinking metric f#$k tons of valuable material that tbh could be better used for other things than donating them to the BoS for very little gain.
---
A re-skined beret or a crappy sign a Bethesda developer probs took 10 min to create...whoopdedoo, that's 100's of thousands of material well spent there and community effort.
---
The community isn't being selfish, it's proving a point that it's had enough of Bethesda's bullshit and tbh can you honestly think Bethesda will let the event fail? It'll mysteriously have the numbers at the last minute because it can't afford to piss off the community
---
Aw, damn. Wait for a sale it is then. Thanks!
---
Makes me wonder what Bethesda is spending all of our money on if they're not hiring more employees. 400 is a tiny amount of people for how successful they are.
---
Why do they have such a hard time making differnt challenges it seems there are the same 4 everyday.
---
I still feel like this game was always meant to be a battle royale, but they didn't know how to announce it without making it into a survival game first.
---
Wouldn’t a sudden drop in 1st subscriptions and Atom shop purchases tug at their heartstrings more?
---
The 2 that I opened, probably the only 2 I'm going to open, ever. I got the plan for the Mole Miner Gauntlet and the Laser Pistol, both easily found in the world. Plus, a handful of Floater Grenades, and some alcohol. 
---
Extremely underwhelming exchange for 500 steel. I'd rather have changed that steel into ammo.
---
only 1 new added? the patch was yesterday, give it some time
---
Thank you for putting into words my thoughts so much better than I can.
---
I do have an M79 that has amazing accuracy. When fighting random SBs, I can vats and shoot, and my grenade will follow through the air and explode about 20-30 seconds later. But I burn through as many grenades to kill the thing than if it were to just land and hit it with my vampiric handmade.
---
Im still depositing steel just like everyone else.
---
The statement was more alluding to the position that I am much more likely to part with steel as it is more common and easier to gather than cork, especially when there is no exclusive reward or reason for me to farm cork in huge amounts.
---
I could drop 40k steel tomorrow and not feel it, but 4k cork would clean me out on every character, just about.
---
There's a daily limit on caps?
---
Lol so true
---
when the bunker prefab comes out, I am going to have it where All signs point to it, make it look secure as fuck, and once they open the door (if the door isn't glitched like the red rock one and doesn't take 2 months to fix), they are going to find the slocum joe's vendor, and all it is going to sell is .38, you have been insaulted notes, propaganda fliers, and wood armor. and when they turn around to leave, in brought neon lights, "have a nice day"
---
Oooh yeah you're probably right.
---
These are strange times indeed fellow member.
---
Ya, it's 1400 from the vendor bots.
---
Aye!
---
I have never done full auto builds just for the sake of ammo, I always felt like I could kill enemies just as easy with less bullets, but I will certainly invest some levels in to commando instead. I have yet to get The Fixer plan but I will hope I can get it some day as I do like semi auto a lot.
---
i dont think you can. no idea what they're talking about.
---
I understand this sort of sentiment but I need to ask what sort of reward were you expecting? This was the most likely outcome, and they didn't put other items in because they wanted to avoid the hate they got for the crocollus backpack but since this is Bethesda they're screwed if they do and screwed if they don't
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5e513fd&amp;d=la2lu2l71lt2cu0ir2pd2pk2pl2pp2eu0sg2a02s01p01ee2l11a72ar1an2ao0a32&amp;m=c2f836&amp;am=18-18-18-18-18&amp;wp=w5&amp;wm=142737&amp;n=Lemon%27s%20Bloody
---
Nice! Remember to share this tip to all your friends!
---
ESO is objectively more polished and has way more content, but the monetization is orders of magnitude worse than 76. Buy to play, expansions, paid DLC, a subscription, a shop that makes some free to play games look generous by comparison, gambling crates with less than 1% drop chance for the desirable items. It goes on and on.
---
I built my base in the mire and haven’t moved it once, because I’m that good. All without double sided walls. I’d rather save the budget for something else.
---
I highly doubt that the event will tank even with all the complainers. The vast majority of players will still be donating and completing. The reddit users complaining are just a minority. For the record I completely agree with all the complaints, the event rewards are crap. I just choose to not complain about it to anyone who will listen with another post just like the hundreds before it saying the same thing
---
Or at least free if you own Fallout 4. I’m pretty pissed at Bethesda but I do think they should earn $ for work done. I just don’t value a single set of power armor anywhere $20.
---
Yikes, I was going to play for the first time in a while yesterday but the servers were down, since then I've heard nothing but negative things about the patch.
---
Well, here's hoping the next update will get me back into things.
---
In waiting to play cyber punk on the new consoles.
---
This is what I run, with all the usual mutations. After a few traah mobs you will be hitting for almost 3k per headshot.
---
1) Bin it.
---
2) Burn it.
---
3) Bury it.
---
That skin is new, so there is hope.
---
And the Dragon is sonewhat legacy, there is no more legendary Dragons in the loot pool.
---
Brin in a PvP Ballance and give us the Survival Servers back is a point relatively important to me.
---
 I know many don't like it but I think it should have been an essential feature from the beginning. 
---
Like daddy Todd said "You are the NPCs, to create your own advwnture" (something like that). It's still the Apocalypse not Sims and no farming Simulator.
---
There’s things in the patch that are fuck ups. Like the mods for pocketed and deep not actually getting added. I wanted the deep pocketed. Having to wait does not frustrate me. 
---
The change to double sided walks. Sucks. I’m not sure it was intended or accidental by fixing something else.
---
But it’s a serious change for camp builders. Of which I’m one, even though I’m currently not using that trick. But I have. 
---
They really need to give players a double sided wall option. In fact it should have been put in game already. 
---
There’s other things.
---
But this event isn’t something to be this enraged about because it doesn’t give uber rewards?
---
“More money that I’ll admit to my wife” I still log in just to do dailies than log out for this reason. Don’t know how much longer that will last.
---
the event is a poor value proposition, people dont tend to want to waste time or energy on things that are poor value propositions, its that simple. calling people selfish for not wanting to waste resources on shit they already have is just silly, and honestly you just sound 10x as entitled as the people whining about the event. NO ONE is obligated to participate in the event. you just want to whine and play martyr, so fine donate your junk and fall on the sword, noone cares.
---
there is NO community focus with the event, its not like the previous one where people would team up and kill scorchbeasts. that was fun, this is just dumping crap into the void for bad rewards. you dont have to do it with other people, we cant see out progress in real time to motivate people, and everyone knows bethesda is going to give us the rewards irrespective of the actual junk donated.
---
I mean....adrenaline IS working now soooo theres that i guess?
---
I get it, you guys were part of the development team and you know that the sole intention of this challenge was to track hours, despite 2/3 platforms having that ability built into their systems.
---
At this point I think the VATS problem is unfixable or they would have addressed it by now.
---
I agree that the ammo torture device got worse. At least the previous incarnation detected type and quantity of ammo in your inventory. It should be similar to the Armco device. In the terminal, Just set what types of ammo you want to convert (this should remain fixed until you change it) and identify what ammo you want. The converter checks your inventory and converts it all to the new ammo, with any remainder converted to ammo points.
---
There are explanations for the caps, white springs vendors accepted them for an event that was never manually shut off so they continued to sell for caps, it’s been 20 years so I wouldn’t doubt people would use the word super mutant, can you give examples of buzzard decisions? And legendary weapons are not cannon, they are just there to make the game easier.
---
We all still enjoy the game, so that’s why it returns to normal. But time and time again they just fuck up. Badly. And to be honest at this point that’s just unacceptable and laughable.
---
Right, also if it were some awesome reward people would be AFKing all day to get to it
---
I think adding pvp public teams would be a step in the right direction.
---
For the sake of clarity: being anti-stupidity doesn't make me pro-Bethesda. Two completely separate ideologies.
---
Even if they add some of these at low return rates.
---
* Circus cage trailer
---
* Crock backpack
---
* Treasure hunter outfit hat
---
* Insurgent outfit / hat
---
* T60 plans
---
* Gold / Scrip
---
Would make the rewards actually worth doing.
---
It’s more of a cherry on top of the shit-pie that is the decision-making for this game. I know it’s not a big deal, i even said so in the post. It’s just another thing that makes me go “wtf” when looking at Bethesda’s decisions with the game.
---
I've played since beta. Outrage isn't worth anyone's time and is just a way to fill time and make yourselves feel important. And stay on a sinking ship? It's still floating isn't it? Probably because I support games and don't get on bandwagon hate trains like you noob children.
---
I will not buy the Grognak Bundle. I want the throne, but I already have the weapon skin and emote. I could've and should've bought the bundle before, I understand. I just wish I could get a discount for owning items in bundles.
---
Well, the main reason is that there are only so many hours in a day.  Most people will drop this (and everything else mind you) to play the shiny new game.  I'm sure it will be lovely but eventually it, like everything else, will run its course and people will either revert to their old pastimes or move on to the next new and shiny game.
---
But, most people are unable or unwilling to split their time up and the new thing usually wins over the old thing...for at while at least.
---
Thanks for the heads up we will bring this up.
---
I mean, they could have at least made it 80 atoms like some of the other challenges, but yeah I get the point.
---
It's only a cap on what you can sell, and realistically, how long are you playing on a daily basis that you hit it, unless you explicitly went out of your way to make a cap farm at your CAMP?
---
“All of” 
---
No they didn’t.

---
You called it a nerf and Bethesda calls it fixing exploit but yes it got fixed this change was posted in the patch notes:  
---
Combat:   
---
**Exploit:** Fixed an exploit allowing Bows to fire much faster than intended.
---
I wanted to watch but it’s over 3 minute and I already wasted enough of my life on payout drama queen post.
---
The BoS in F3 was just like the minute men. Some even broke away because that BoS chapter was helping too much and not hording technology enough.
---
OK you ARE really new to 76.. In detail then.. Technically speaking what they fixed was a glitch. But it was a glitch that was used by almost everyone who ever build a nice camp to get a wall in place, to get a cable through a wall, to get double-sided walls and a lot lot more. In short nobody ever wanted that fixed, because it made the many inaptitudes of fo76 CAMP building more bearable, possible and even opened up some creative options. Thats gone now.
---
And.. many fear (me amongst them), that Beth. only fixed it in order to sell a new atom shop item (like a 2-sided interior wall) which will arrive shortly in the shop for only 5 bucks.
---
Go aheah an try to build sth, that isn\`t an ugly, square box.. and then have to demolish half of it, because you would only to build it with a glitch or because you missbuild step 56 in you 1540 step to build your base, just because you forgot about buildung in a specific order to get every wall where it belongs.. or you need to remove a stair.. nightmare that.. or place a pillar on a corner of a foundation.. 
---
The whole building system is no more than a buggy, glitchy mess.. And when you spent hundreds of hours learning the rules.. The rules get changed, because now.. that is aglitch a of a sudden and not a feature.
---
So yeah most builders a fed up with that shit. And Beth reads this subreddit.. They have noticed... believe me. But no response so far.. That usually means.. it was intented that way it is now.. and if thats the case.. I am out for good.. Another player fom Day 1 bites the dust..
---
yep, all part of their plan to make everyone use only tesla rifles
---
no not broken. your looting needs to be more varied.
---
basically loot 180 -240 other things before going back.
---
It seems the only things they are capable of fixing are things the player base wants to be left alone.
---
It does ruin the enjoyment of this sub, all the repetitive posts.  But it'll calm down eventually.  The outrage can only sustain this ridiculous level for so long.  Spend time on other subs for now.  r/whatswrongwithyourcat is pretty good.
---
It’s selfish to think people will dump their mats for rewards that have been reused for the third time...
---
They have users in PTS that could have flushed most of these problems out in advance. What kind of software shop use one version for testers and release a different version?
---
Some of the bugs really improve this game a lot and those seem to be the teams focus for some reason? Why not fix the ones that matter like how every time I have a photo saved I inevitably get a blue screen?  How I get disconnected at least once a day for no reason? The lag? I could go on but no Bethesda you go on fixing the bugs that actually provide us with a small amount of entertainment while we're waiting for you to fix the otherwise tedious grind of a game that barely functions.
---
Can they increase the frame rates on console?? LoL!! That's what I want
---
We blew it up once we’ll do it again
---
I think your camp building point is great, however this isn't a feature in wich I would say it's fixed. I'd rather have more side quests and stuff like that.
---
I have about 1300 the 20 per day cap is bullshit tbh
---
Steel is so plentiful, it doesn’t even matter how much of it you donate
---
That said, I only planned on donating 5,000 so thanks for your contribution
---
I mostly like it cause it doesnt give me rads like the pump or the sinks, I'm running a vanguard and unyielding so its convenient for me
---
thanks for the info!
---
You're leaving Fallout first right? Okay then. Who cares?  These posts with play stats and what you bought is just another way to make yourself feel important in a video game.
---
It's all about profit. These ungrateful builders getting 2x the value out of our wallpapers. Its gotta be fixed so we can sell em interior walls and more contemporary home bundles for outside walls.
---
In return for the apparel items you just mentioned
---
Try going to steam settings, downloads, clearing download cache. Also restart the client after doing that. Its apparently fixed it for some.
---
They're just trying to make their nut like any other business. Try adding $$$ or "money", or "ill pay $$$" into ur posts, that might get their attention. "Cancelling fo1st" is not gonna be attibuted to anything major and only give them LESS incentive if anything.
---
If they first bring Ballance to the system yes. I onced mad a post on how to safe it and make it fun for everyone. Still got down voted to oblivion since some people really hate pvp.
---
Laziness.  
---
Fallout would be best made with input by the fans. You wouldn't want to work on something you love as a job. You'll end up hating it and few people find that middle ground.  
---
BGS is a business like any other. 76 is another MMO time sink just like EVERY one before and that will come after it. There's no end to it.  
---
All MMOs are:
---
Designed to bend you over, and give you a fast one with no lube while you scream how much you like playing it.  
---
Mediocre at best rewards for time played. Time is something you cannot get back and you don''t own anything in the game. Should they decide to cancel 76 for whatever reason all the info is on their servers and you are F'd.  
---
There have been many good choices in it. Keeping things only cosmetic is good and the newer addition of kits isn't pay to win. It simply decreases time for people who wish to pay for such things.  
---
They are quite simply and until a couple of days ago I could finish in less than 2 hours. It has become so bland I'm not looking forward to the grind no matter how small.
---
For $49.99 (no tax included), a Legendary Chameleon Todd Howard will fall from the heavens to give you a special reward to aid you in your quest. Don’t know if you know it by now, but it’s called Skyrim. 
---
Also, your system ded.
---
I love it, too, other than the maximum capacity. And great to hear that it doesn't give rads... I'm honestly surprised.
---
You know I have the urban scout mask and one piece of urban scout armor. But I’ve never seen other pieces of armor drop.
---
I can safely say you're about the only one who thinks a bloodied build's damage is lacking :)  99% of enemies in the game die in 3 or less shots.
---
Totally agree game need the time gating removing or at least let us use tickets to get gold of smiley.
---
Something more than the worst possible items in the game: alcohol was made even more abundant than it already is due to the Christmas duping, floater grenades you can’t even scrap properly without having to confirm you want to which is a pain, especially since you can’t even sell them either. I said in my post it would’ve been nice to at least have a chance to get some BoS-themed rewards, possibly the BoS jumpsuit, would’ve even been a good way to bring back the Initiate paint for the T60 power armour. Something other than just a watered-down reskin of the Christmas presents, because at least with those you got junk back.
---
It is more the fact that they gave us a throw away event that only rewards stuff we already have gotten twice.  Its very low effort.
---
Yeah I think it would be a bit better if they just increased it to 3 like the small water purifiers
---
I kind of wonder if there would have been as much backlash if they didn't have the loot boxes.  The "Kill a bazillion Scorched, get community prizes" events seemed to work fairly well without the added rewards.  Seems like that's really what this event is, at the end of the day.  Maybe the added loot box turn-ins are just an add-on, not the goal.  I think I'll be looking at it that way, at least for the amount I intend to contribute toward rewards I actually want. (Collectrons!  Gotta catch 'em all!)  Makes the whole exercise a little more palatable.  
---
FWIW, regarding the BoS content, I think they've said an upcoming SCORE season will be BoS themed.  So maybe they're saving the cosmetics for that, as well as for future Atom shop items.
---
Yeah, we know your point was "It's not what I would do, therefore it's wrong." You don't have to keep explaining it.
---
Hours per day?   Whaaaatttt... are u stuck at level 1 or something?
---
Mole miner event was - give me your caps
---
Seasons - give me your atoms
---
Bos - give me your junk
---
And btw fuck your camps
---
On a "per wall type" basis of course.
---
You’re saying 200m resources or whatever stupid amount they’ve stated is worth a beret with the BoS emblem on it?
---
Still waiting to see that event that was added, as you firmly believe...
---
Lots of booze.....;)
---
I doubt that. 
---
Did I say sunk? "Sinking" means that it is in the process of sinking. Yes, It is still floating you highly observant creature, and you can continue supporting a growing pile of shit, but the rest of us who can actually pay attention realize this goes well beyond the building fix. They promise things and don't deliever, straight up lie, backpeddle, and consistently add in more bugs than content that is released as a buggy mess. If you're a beta player, you'd know that better than anyone, noob child.
---
It’s literally impossible to waste digital
---
Items in a game that has an infinite endless supply of everything.
---
😜👍
---
Wait... they 'fixed' the double walls but STILL did not fix being able to put wallpaper on wood windows? Wtf.
---
&gt; This guy gets it.
---
No he doesn't. The community rewards are a *gamble*, we may not even reach half of them, let alone one. So people could be pouring thousands of steel scraps and have nothing to show for it.
---
Steel is also used in tons of other areas of the game, from crafting to selling.
---
This community challenge ask for a sacrifice of your resources in *hope* you *may* get the golden carrot at the end of the stick. If you don't, well, enjoy your hundreds extra mount plans ontop of the ones you still haven't sold.
---
&gt; getting junk for JUNK.
---
People are investing, so they expect something in return, it's natural and legitimate. The scorched community event from last year asked for nothing else but time so of course people are annoyed that the second community challenge feels worse on short terms.
---
Wait, the capitalist jocks want us to SHARE our resources with them? Sounds a lot like COMMUNISM to me?
---
Jokes aside, fuck the BoS. They ain't getting shit from me. Worst faction in the game.
---
Working on getting that proof to you.
---
I started playing again just recently and decided to keep a notebook of bugs and glitches I've found, while ignoring minor ones that don't happen more than once. It's been 2 weeks, and I've filled 4 pages. No spacing and small letters. Along with their inability to listen to their community, when trying to report bugs on their tickets, it's nearly impossible to do so correctly since you have to fit such a specific criteria.
---
Thank goodness. All the ammo "points", perk "coins",  those immersion breaking flashy popups, the silly sounds that comes with the above. Makes it feel like this is a ftp amusement park mobile game and not a Post Nuclear Role Playing Game.
---
That's true for all the menus (inventory, main menu, friends list, vendors, pip boy, etc.)
---
Yeah it's probably a good thing I've quit tbh, I don't really buy many  games and because I was kind of addicted to this, I wanted almost everything that was getting put in the store and the dailes and atoms from fallout first weren't close to enough. I know it's not great and most will see it as sad, but probably put over 1k into this game
---
It's actually coming to kitchen mixers next year.
---
Close, but it'll be SLIGHYLY askew where no wallpaper lines up correctly and than never fixed after you've bought it cause they just suckered you outta more atoms.
---
You can sell a handful of mutation serums and hit the cap quite fast. Once you have money buying serums is one of the true cap sinks in the game.
---
jesus christ thats unbelievable. as if the bows were viable before
---
That's happened to me as well. I was a bit peeved, to say the least. Is the timer just an arbitrary thing there? Every other event goes until the timer runs out or the goal is met.
---
But I want more meat week
---
Man I get you, I cancelled my Fo1st sub even before the legendary run because and stopped being a diehard, I'm pretty much just exhausted of the game loop now. This game is nothing but Beth telling you how to play and what you can or cannot do. Met all the limits of the day? Well trot off, you've opened the game, seen the atomic shop, that's all we care, go buy skyrim again why don't you, maybe buy our creation club points? Lavish our wallets with the profits we're not willing to invest into this game to make it better.
---
The fact that I don't even have the will to open the game to play with some of my friends who just recently got into this game really makes me feel bad. Tho funnily enough, all three of them are already dead set on not poking the endgame because they know its bad. Just play whats new, bounce to another game, come back for whats new for about a week, repeat. The game is pretty much anti-casual due to how much you miss out and relies on exhausted diehards.
---
Depending on how you build it’s actually a big deal. It’s also a lot more tedious to build now.
---
Dumb question.. but did all the NPCs you were supposed to defend, die?  Or is this just about others not helping with ore which is annoying yeah.
---
Ya anything with pvp gets downvoted to hell
---
I guess I could concede to the caps point but the way caps are used in conversations is completely off 
---
I mean super mutant is used like some sort of years old agreed upon term which it wouldn't be. A good example of this is in the walking dead mythos, different groups have different names in short periods of time which will eventually converge into one, but that takes time. 
---
The tone of NPC conversations feel dry and stiff, NPCs asking for strange things and the world feeling like complete cardboard in the Hub towns. 
---
It doesn't have that thought out feeling I got with previous titles. I will admit it still has the visual flare but it feels more like a paint job
---
Why do you always resort to hyperboles and exaggerations to make your point?
---
And why do you seemingly ignore the arguments I gave you yesterday about this?
---
I can admit I played the B.E.T.A. and never bothered to play after release. Finally started again after wastelanders and have played every day since. It at least feels like a Fallout game with NPCs.
---
Its up to you to decide, no one is forcing you to do the event, if you dont want to donate then dont donate, i personally put in 25k steel last night and got 104 packages from it, from those packages i got 2 plans i didnt already have (which at this point is hard to come by) so yeah its worth it for me, steel is by far the easiest material to get in this game too
---
Only those that are true Bethesdanders will have the event pop for them after dropping nuke.
---
Kinda like the emperor's new clothes.
---
You are too noob to kill Earl. Try again after buying fallout 1st, 2nd and 3rd.
---
He doesn't have infinite time, he's saying he can better spend it elsewhere.
---
I’m amazed you still follow the sub for it.
---
I think people do understand this.
---
WHY do we have to pick specific amounts of ammo abd do multiple clicks? WHY can't they include a "convert all of &lt;ammo type you choose&gt;"
---
You can't even use the converter unless you look up your exact ammo counts so you know which ammo amount option to pick for conversion...
---
Hey, wood chips and paraffin wax candles are the way to go for homemade fire starters.
---
I noticed this, too. It's like it's underwater or something.
---
"We've added images so you can see all of the rewards, plus we slowed the cursor down 1000X so you can make sure to see them! You're welcome!"
---
This.
---
Unyielding is bugged :D Try reequipping your armor
---
You can’t get explosive energy weapons!
---
I haven't played since this was added (or just didn't do it yesterday...)
---
What's the best way to donate? Bulk, or like one single piece at a time?
---
My best guess would be one of the mods that alter the interface. Out of your list, I personally have Perk Loadout Manager, Better Inventory, Save Everything and intRaw, but I have not yet updated any of them after installing patch 21. I'll try again after updating all of those mods and report my results here.
---
Just going on to do daily challenges and some events gets me enough water, stims, and meds as event/quest rewards to burn through most of the daily cap.   
---
If I want to sell off bulk scrap, or the loose stuff (asbestos, circuitry, gold etc.) I'll drop off the meds and water at a low level player's CAMP, or in the Overseer's stash box at Wayward, otherwise I'll hit the caps cap without fail.
---
"Welcome to the hotel Appalchia.."
---
Last one?
---
Ah thank you I was buggin’ 🤓
---
Commando will give you more damage per second. If you want rifleman you are best off with hunting rifle or lever action IMO. Handmade, combat rifles, assault rifles seem to be best optimized with a powerful automatic receiver.
---
Probably. I have no idea how, but I'm sure there are some smart people out there who have some ideas on how.
---
I convert all those nearly empty cores to Ultracite. Then they are fully charged again.
---
Is there a way to see how much has been donated so far?
---
If an exploit is the only thing keeping a weapon semi-competitive in the current meta it should be looked at with more nuance than just simple putting an end to it.
---
Still not updated yet.   I'm really surprised that there isn't something in the game, or perhaps on the opening screen. \*shrug\*
---
I dont know lol. Great username btw
---
You could do so many different builds using it. Floating things, curves, etc.The conduit was probably the smallest issue with the change.
---
I run auto and you can use it like a rifle.  Just tap your fire button
---
Not dumb, I actually *rage fast travelled* out of there, I'm now guessing nobody defended those scavers.
---
Didn't think of that, weren't that many people their and they were harvesting XP I presume 👍
---
NITPICKING??? Getting annoyed at lying and breaking promises as well as suddenly saying: "Sorry, that will happen later kthxbye" is NOT nitpicking!
---
Not yet, but rumor has it this is definitely the culprit.
---
Idea being Bethesda is struggling with server instability and camp budgets because the 'creation kit' is a dinosaur and they will likely try and spin this as a win/win; they get your cash (likely the walls, if sold, will be feasible at 500-700 atoms, but also allow players to eliminate wall use to help scale down the budget and improve the CAMP's detrimental effect on server stability.
---
I love Fallout, but lost all faith that Bethesda puts good games as priority over quick profit.  If only obsidian could get a chance again as their quality is also dipping, but less shitty than Betb by far.
---
See you when the next big content update that isn’t delayed releases.
---
Sounds like maybe they fixed a bug that was giving you extra stars. Because baseline 15str+15unyielding is 30. Radicool puts that at 35. Herd mentality+SiN puts that at 38. Do the math yourself- what other things do you have that increase or decrease your strength? 
---
(They did fuck up at least 1 under armor so check that too)
---
Jeeze everyone is overreacting over some walls lol
---
Happened to me once also.  Time was 3:24.  Excavators were still all alive.
---
Ya, just selling scrap and guns you scavenge during adventurers helps you hit it quite fast.
---
I like pvp but we'd need a team just for balancing alone. Survival servers again would be a nice touch. I always dreamed of raiding a settlers camp...
---
As other guy commented, I'm betting the scavers all died, not enough people I think. 🤷‍♂️
---
Supposed to be fixed patches/updates ago, but another false promise.
---
I just got really pissed, tbh. I got useless grenades and useless booze, while I lost very useful steel. This whole patch, between the donation rewards to the ammo converter change (it damn sure wasn't an improvement, by any stretch of the imagination) felt like a big troll from BGS. I HAD been looking forward to the BoS bit quite a lot, but now I don't know. I want the SCORE rewards, I guess, but beyond that, I just don't know. I'm guessing now would be the time to go ahead and cancel FO1, since I don't see myself using it too much anymore. I am really upset about it, too. I had enjoyed it but this was insulting.
---
Burn the witch!  Burn the witch!
---
(I agree with you.  People need to chill)
---
Cause it’s fun
---
Didn’t even have to do that- it just randomly switched to Play.
---
I'm also using a Bloodied Pipe Revolver Rifle (with +33% VATS). Its great and carried me from level 50 to level 555 so far. But double dipping into Rifleman and Gunslinger perks eats up a lot of perk slots. I hope the legendary perks don't get delayed again so that I can fill some holes in my build with them.
---
Bethesda killed fallout with 4. 76 was a weak attempt at farming more money out of us and it’s been an entire shit show since release
---
There’s 2 lose conditions and 1 win. 
---
Timer runs out without collecting any ore- lose
---
All the scavengers die- lose.
---
Timer ends with at least some ore collected and at least 1 scav alive, win. 
---
All the scavs probably died.
---
No, it isnt, its childish
---
This probably bethesda's way of clearing up all the duped junk from earlier
---
It baffles me that so many people even bought into the Fallout 1st thing.
---
You guys are the ones to blame for every shit coming at us.
---
Killing scorched and donating some of the most valuable scrap resources are very different though, especially for people who don’t grind daily or don’t have a proper resource farming setup, two thinks that’ll likely be a big factor for new players - the ones this event is aimed at. I agree aiming for the end goal instead of the boxes is a better way of looking at it however it still feels like a punch in the gut in many ways, especially with the lack of effort put into the entire patch, not just the event. 
---
That’s the thing though, they’ll likely have a few BoS-themed rewards on the SCORE pass next season, maybe 15 or so? But the majority will come from the store, and unless you’re new and have just bashed out the challenges for the atoms, unless you’re already paying for F1st, you’ll likely be forking out money to get these new items, and as much as I want to support the game I’m really starting to get fed up of almost wasting my money at this point when it’s getting more and more obvious they genuinely do not care.
---
Haha understood!  It's definitely annoying to have people who don't want to help.  I know some people like to get ore and hold it til the end but I've had too many instances where no one else is even going for it.
---
And if they are not even defending the NPCs as in your case then that's doubly lame.
---
Imagine how much better it would be if they used something like Unreal or Unity. Much, much better.
---
What does this have to do with fallout 76.
---
That means my C.A.M.P. is legacy, if I ever get back into playing. Damn.
---
Seems bugged. It’s now flagged as an outfit
---
Did you get your weapon from a drop or buy it from a vendor? People can rename weapons and thus, scam people out of their caps. Does the description actually say increased damage the lower your health?
---
I have the scout mask too. Theyve come out with a forest camo for the SS but itd be cool to see a urban is all I have to say about it
---
Yeah I really don’t understand why it now displays transactions you can’t complete instead of the previous way it was. I honestly can deal with the interface if they would just switch it back. The transaction failed screen shouldn’t exist. That being said I’m happy to have gotten rid of 200k 10mm ammo so quickly. Really opens up some space in my stash.
---
Now that I’m thinking about it, it wouldn’t hurt to fact check myself. Be right back
---
you took the bait tho.. knowingly
---
I thought that was the whole point of interior camps. They'd be loaded per user and not part of the main world.
---
Toodaloo
---
Pretty sure it’s a bug and unintentional.
---
I just unsubscribed.  I was a happy little whale, Beth, way to go
---
I honestly thought at first that maybe BGS is just trying to screw it up just enough to get people to stop playing so they can pull the plug without an uproar. After this last patch, it's the only thing that makes sense. The ammo converter is even worse than before, and the rewards for the BoS donation stuff are insulting, really.
---
If it is possible to do something in the game people will do it, just bored players who hate the game and think they are getting their own back on Bethesda. Must be eating them up inside 😒
---
Not knowing that he would destroy my entire base
---
This is B.S. Give us interior walls if we can't do doorway glitch. I love building, probably more than anything.
---
Well, crap...
---
(....gets out wallet....)
---
I also wouldn’t be surprised if they did say we failed it but don’t worry guys we are putting the rewards on the atom store.
---
Suppose under armor + 2, str pieces +2, radicool +5. Am I doing this math thing right? Lol
---
Edit: see you said radicool
---
Only everyone is bound by that. So it's a pointless counter argument.
---
Same thing happening to both me and my girlfriend . Shit .
---
I would love to have card/perk loadout slots that I can switch on the fly.
---
I hate having to go in a swap around my cards every time I come across a lock or terminal. Even if it was only two loadouts that were swap-able with a hot key. You could have you combat perks in one and all your crafting/repairing/hacking/farming on the other. Or switch between your sniper and heavy weapons build on the fly.
---
It would also be cool to get an extra special point every ten or twenty levels after cap. The developers keep saying they will never do that because of balance, but balance went out the window long ago.
---
unfortunately most of us got banned lol
---
The Bethesda launcher doesn’t have it built in. It’s only been on Steam for a few months. So that hot take of yours is wrong.
---
Can confirm.
---
I run a bloodied build. However I rarely even use my bloodied guns anymore. Got an instigating +crit dmg +reload lever action from a vendor a couple weeks ago for like 600c and it 1 shots everything but the big mobs. They get to be melted by my bloodied handmade.
---
hopefully they spend zero development time on this idea..
---
game is fucked enough without scotch taping on a bunch of wholly new mechanics..
---
no thanks...
---
It does, however it’s still littered with bugs that have existed for ages that they say they’ll fix but never do, the QoL of this game is on a steady decline due to the increasing lack of effort they’re putting into it with each update, like they’re trying to just get as far as they need to with it (likely until the next game) and I can guarantee they’ll either stop working on it altogether, or leave a couple of people on it to sort out any major bugs (or problems with the atom shop of course)
---
Not a bug, feature of scorch killer receivers due to having ultracite materials.
---
Because that's definitely the only thing this is about.
---
I’ve decided to see this season to completion as I’m already at rank 70.
---
Then I’m only popping back for major updates like the brotherhood etc.
---
If you know of a good bug, dont fucking talk about it.
---
Gamers aren't known for logic
---
Cheaters don’t fuck with my playing house.
---
Hey were not going to give you triangular foundations or interior walls but we ARE going to take away the ability to work around thia fact. Thanks allot Bullthesda.
---
I'm not a huge BOS fan in any case and the rewards are poor, at best.
---
Having said that I am desperately curious to see what they need 200,000,000 cork for.
---
I would be Todd Howards boss and make him my work-bitch
---
It sounds like you do in-fact need a break from the game.  Best of luck.
---
It´s not just making double sided walls, it is a way to build all types of different and unique  structures, one of the if not the biggest tool to not make a boxy settlement.
---
Because they can. 
---
I see many posts about how wonderful and friendly the community is both ingame and out...obviously those people havent been playing long enough or been on Reddit at Patch day+1. Sadly there's a small minority who are just idiots, you can often identify them by their weapons - most times I've been pvp'd (I usually don't take the bait which upsets them) I see an Explosive Fixer or similar. It's a bit of a giveaway as legitimate users seem rare, and even less those who actually beet the rng to get their uber gun.
---
Great points. Legendary perks and loadouts have been heavily requested!! Delay after delay though.
---
It technically wasn't a one shot with his Gatling Plasma, except you were below 110 HP. I do PvP often, but I don't attack players below level 80, even though they could technically be my strength. Except they really want it and attack me multiple times. Last mistake...
---
Why use an assault rifle if you’re a rifleman build? Get a lever action.
---
And is your assault rifle modded for automatic or single fire...
---
It was fun for people to build 'outside the box' and make interesting imaginative camp structures.
---
Bethesda come across as big kill joys in many things they do. Fun seems to be the antithesis of this company, it's all about the mighty $$$
---
Your reaction right here. This is why people do it.
---
I was more a porpoise, but yeah, no more money from me.
---
There is no such thing as a "sinking ship" in video games, regardless of your hatred of Fallout 76. It all boils down to investor, incomes and player count. Maybe from Bethesda's perspective everything fun fine and well, enough to warrant the production of content until 2021.
---
This subreddit isn't even 1% of the playerbase. Just because you witness and dislike how things are handled doesn't mean the game is doomed by any means.
---
And I say this as someone who has his own share of problems with the game so I'm not trying to shield it... But "sinking ship" is an inaccurate hyperbole.
---
Attacking low levels yes. Attacking High-levels no.
---
Just don’t ever take the bait. This game teaches you patience like a screaming 2 year old at 3 am will. Don’t ever give in to griefers.
---
A) this was an "easy" fix
---
B) Not many of the money spending casual people goe crazy for building
---
C) the more negative bugs affect gameplay, more likely they are to sell atoms to buy the kits that go directly against their "The atom shop will ONLY be cosmetics" statement from before release.
---
Ever heard of google though?
---
Looks like there’s a few perks you could probably go without for a bloodied build. My guess is your problem is that you aren’t leaning towards stealth or vats. Those tend to be where the extra dmg can start getting good. 
---
[I removed/reduced a few perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=6f433be&amp;d=la2lu2l71lt2li2cu0ir2sf0pd2pk2pl2pp2eu0a12sg2am2au0pe2a00&amp;m=c2f836&amp;am=18-18-18-18-18&amp;wp=w5&amp;wm=142737&amp;n=Lemon%27s%20Bloody)
---
Not required to make these changes, but DR boosting skills tend to waste your perk slots as the resistance they provide as you get stronger get incredibly small(assuming your armor is better than wood).
---
As a low heath you wouldn’t need healing from rads as rads are probably the reason your health is dropping and some perks just give you such a small boost after the first rank. in charisma, strange in number would be a good perk for you and you’d probably also want the eagle eyes and herd mentality mutations if you’re ok with always playing on a team - you can play in a public team by yourself and heard mentality will still help you.
---
I think once you choose between stealth or vats you’ll see a good difference!
---
I always thought of it as a meme achievement. Because if it was a serious achievement then we would also get a platform trophy, but we don't soooo.
---
naivete isnt an excuse..
---
now you know better.. lesson learned...
---
Or make him play his own game would be a good fucking start! Lol
---
Grrr! I hate this! I have a legacy house now too, fml. I used the wall wire glitch so much because Bethesda's crappy conduits kept not working or placing well or at all. This is such B.S.
---
You could also get fractaline by not doing anything but playing the game how you normally would. You have to stop playing and start scrapping for no real payoff other than you have a hard on for the BOS. They can’t reward guns or armor because of scrip limit. It’s like every system is fighting each other so we can’t get the feeling of being rewarded for the time we put in.
---
Blame Bethesda. No new meaningful endgame content for months. High levels have resorted to griefing as a way to find enjoyment in this game. 
---
Sucks, but it is what it is
---
How about new devs? Like fuck those guys currently in power. We need a revolution!!
---
You really haven’t been paying attention. This isn’t even remotely just about the walls. They broke more things than they fixed this patch. In fact about the ONLY positive thing this patch brought was a fix to adrenaline... which they broke like 3, 4 months ago?
---
If I still play after that joke of a patch yesterday, that will be the ONLY thing I'm doing it for, too. I'm going to miss that survival tent and scrap box, but I can't keep supporting this. I used to think BGS was the best game studio ever and now I don't even recognize them any more. What the hell happened to them? I'd really like to know.
---
I do agree its short but if you do everything its still about 30hrs or so
---
Bethesda is vault-tec....we r the residents...time for the social experiment to start lol..
---
Honestly, the fix made no real difference as regards ease of use; it's effectively just as janky and useless as before. Too many clicks, too much guessing, and conversion rates are pitiful.
---
I'm going to free up CAMP budget and junk it, since it's so tedious to use I never bother. I'd rather just give away ammo, and buy .45 rounds off players with the caps one can easily make by playing.
---
One of the BoS recon parties scared the colossus away. They protected the settlers from it.
---
Only you are putting your value in for everyone else. And that's the selfish part.
---
Turned in 250 steel for 3 fuckin beers and 5 grenades. 
---
What a joke
---
He asserted his dominance over you.
---
I don't have explosive energy weapons.   There are other things that are extremely powerful that I'd hate to lose.
---
Oh, but it’s on Steam now. So it can be tracked. So it’s 2/3 platforms can track inherently, yeah? Glad that’s cleared up
---
If you're at the point of the game where you are just bulk creating serums and selling them to vendors, then what are you even getting the Caps for?  
---
Yeah, you can go and buy all the mutation serum recipes faster...but to what end?  To have a wider variety of mutation serums to sell to the vendor?
---
And great, let's say you cut the time down in 1/2 to get all the serum plans.  Now what?  You have them all?  Now what do you need the caps for?  Even if we extend it out to all the plans, did we really accomplish anything by cutting the time down by 1/2.  Let say you could farm them all in one day, then what?
---
Mutation serums (and plans in general) are a cap sink, but they aren't a \*good\* cap sink, since you eventually get all of them, and it's not even rewarding since everyone can easily get all of them (and more so if we removed the caps), and most plans don't even create anything useful since you can't craft legendaries and non-legendaries are worthless. 
---
Plus you can still continue to earn caps in a day, just not from selling things. 
---
Really my point is this, is increasing the vendor sale amount (or any of the other caps) really fixing anything other than accelrating you towards and end goal, with nothing to do after that?
---
what u say is true, but hands down gauss shotty all day.
---
I wasted all my steel and got nothing. Back to West Tek to get more for myself I guess
---
Iirc it is. It starts at 76, then 760, then 7600.
---
Good idea, but Bethesda can't even keep up with the game as it is. Everything gets delayed and the only good aspects get "fixed".
---
I unsubbed and haven't played for over a month now. I was a day one also and I'm burnt out past the point of no return. I'll hop on when BoS comes out but most likely bail after finishing that questline. I'm not doing the grind anymore.
---
Sorry but this is a  bit dramatic isnt it. It's only a computer game after all
---
Might not even be the devs at fault here, but upper management. That Final Fantasy MMO comes to mind. When it turned out to be shit, it took the then president of the company to replace everyone responsible and turn it around. But yeah, Zenimax and Bethesda would never admit fault within their management.
---
No idea myself. 
---
Just seen dozens of complaints about it since Tuesday, so I'm not sure what it affects, if it's a bug, anything.
---
All I know is there's a few people having the same issue.
---
Water based items are a particularly weak area for Bethesda - water well, water wheel, clean sink, and now the barrel are all very underwhelming (at least initial release).
---
Seriously who was mad about double sided wallpaper... how was is possibly hurting other players...
---
250 steel got me some water, stims, booze, and a frag grenade. I want my steel back.
---
So really, what does increasing the cap accomplish.
---
Ok, now you can now earn 3k a day.  is there anything even worth buying that you need to rush getting caps faster?
---
And let's say now we cut down the time by 1/2 to get everything...then what?
---
The real issue is that we don't have a good cap sink that's rewarding in this game, and there's no content worth pursuing once you've done everything else.
---
Sold! Where do I sign up?
---
I never really trust Atom shop items. I mean, they did say long ago they were going to be just cosmetic. I mean, that ended up being a lie -to some extent- but I still take it at that word.
---
I love the lever, but it breaks way too fast
---
Meh, I just quit and went back to real mmos
---
Due our entire order was built to wipe out the raiders...
---
Edit: my bad, dyslexia missed out the BoS part, I mean yeah I just dislike the BoS intensely from other games because they're basically high tech raiders / nazis
---
I spent 2000 hours in this game because I love it and Fallout. I have stopped my subscription and playing due to continued incompetence from a high tier developer with resources to make a decent product. 
---
The fact you construed my wanting Beth to actually fix shit and make good on what they say with Hatred shows that you already have what you think is my tone in mind. 
---
Also, no shit.
---
If you want some 45, let me know. I usually have quite a bit and can drop it for you.
---
Sounds like Bethesda just need a better camp building system that doesn’t rely on glitches 
---
They could start by leveling the ground where you place your camp offer round foundations and other different shapes to start with
---
No shit, Sherlock.
---
Even after this latest patch? They claimed in patch notes they added some last fixes and it shouldn't happen. But they also claimed other stuff in those same patch notes that were lies.
---
You have to reach ally status with the Settlers, then you have to spend gold bullion to buy the plans from the guy that hangs out near the gold press machine at Foundation. You also need 2 legendary modules to craft it so you need to spend some scrip on that at the Rusty Pick.
---
Not weird. I got a junkies and several others with the so-called magic effects. Should be awesome. It's not.
---
Misses in vats. Can't be used up closed, where shotguns are supposed to shine. Can't stand the charging thing. Horrid weapon. If they fix the vats bug, maybe I'll give it another chanse
---
Before I switched to commando I would just use multiple bloodied lever actions.  I carried a b3390 (most situations), a b5025 (large, stronger enemies), and b1090 with a scope for occasional use. 
---
The cool part with using two is if one goes empty you quickly swap to a full lever.  It makes using levers viable even if you are being swarmed.
---
One day we may hear stories from 'Inside Bethesda' when the ex employees are no longer tied by non disclosure contracts.
---
No, the community acted like this too when Fasnacht shit the bed on the first day of the event.  Everything will be back to normal in a week or so.
---
Also something seems really suspicious that they’re coming all the way from California but that’s just me
---
Given how rare cork is I am surprised it was picked.   That said it is a global collection rate and 200M cork assuming the deposit of 250 remains the same. You only need 800,000 people to deposit it one time to reach the goal.  And the more multi deposits from people the more that number drops in total people needing to participate to get the reward.
---
I've done several of these sort of things on Runescape across the decade or so time I played the game. It is set up the same way as something to do that take you 5 minutes if you are bored and you get little rewards.  The reward for doing the collecting event isn't what matters it is the end game effect.  Dumping sand on Lumbrige crater wasn't the point of the event it was the beach event that comes after were you can get a lot of exp doing event activities and event specific rewards.  
---
Just like gathering scrap isn't the point of the event it is the community cosmetics and the bonus challenge weeks.   
---
The event is going exactly how I expected it. Not because I have low expectations from Bethesda but because I've done this before and have the right expectations.  It is extra side content to do if you have some spare scrap and nothing more. It was never designed for people to sit there and grind scrap for hours and get massive returns on the scrap they put in.
---
It's interesting...  Presumably Bethesda has access to the real, accurate analytics.  They should KNOW how many players, how many hours, how many units of scrap, etc. are generated per unit of time.  Presumably, they would set the target goals at achievable levels.
---
Of course, perhaps they set the goals very, very high to create the impression that those goals were obtainable and give the appearance of high population/participation/hype?
---
Or maybe they are just idiots who set the goals arbitrarily without actually looking at the analytics?
---
Or maybe they didn't bother with the analytics because they intend to claim that the goals were met regardless.
---
Or, more interestingly, they set the goals at an impossible level to make SURE that the goals weren't met.  The BOS might not be happy that the local serfs didn't cough up their tribute...er...supplies as they demanded...er...politely requested.
---
My money is on the "idiot" option but you never know.
---
I kind of feel the same way but mainly because I worked so hard to get the damn thing! 
---
If it's more annoying to use than a standard shotgun and not a ton more effective in most combat situations, why do you prefer it?
---
Doesn't rank 3 fireproof stop you hurting yourself with the explosive damage?
---
obviously a builders community....
---
I guess, still scummy
---
Lol they did fix the backpack clipping issue!
---
But yeah they broke a lot more then they fixed, again!
---
But before the Race it used to be like 3 or was it 5 bubblegum for a daily. Now it's so much easier, thankfully
---
Water well is actually Ok for water, if you drink it straight from the well it functions as a Purified water source, no rads etc but not if you collect it in bottled form, Water wheel as a easy to build generator isn't too bad either granted you live near a water source.
---
&gt; The fact you construed my wanting Beth to actually fix shit and make good on what they say with Hatred shows that you already have what you think is my tone in mind.
---
Well.............
---
&gt; and you can continue supporting **a growing pile of shit**
---
Sure, no hatred there at all. You may have had good faith down the line but it was well hidden behind your hostile wordings. Calling the game a "sinking ship" and a "growing pile of shit" is unhelpful as a whole, not productive and is definitely not a valuable data.
---
He could have just T-Posed
---
Yes this was in the patch notes.
---
God damn I thought double walls was a FEATURE
---
If you’re honestly getting this worked up over a game, you might want to take a break from gaming in general, not just 76. Go camping or something g for a few days. Build model planes. I dunno man. But no game should make you this upset.
---
&gt; value proposition
---
"It must be worth doing the thing to make something do the thing."
---
That's it. That's the simplest way to describe everything from cellular biology all the way up to grinding dumb events in a game. Marginal utility, opportunity cost - all of these are just ways of defining whether doing something is worth your time.
---
And for many of us, this new "Fortifying Atlas" thing is just not worth our time. I don't want to waste my scrap, I don't care about the BOS, and the rewards for my time are valueless to me.
---
If someone else wants the things this "event" offers, then go for it. But me? I'll just keep to the game loops that interest me.
---
Nothing directly.  All the complaints I’m seeing on the last update just remind me of that experience.  It really feels like what the players of Zombie Jombie went through before they pulled the plug on a game they could never get fixed.
---
I completed the legendary run...... I've not played since.
---
Well, yes, these people were never affected by any of those bugs because they enjoyed mainly the camp building. 
---
Now they are affected as well and suddenly it's no longer cool to worship Smuglord Howard. Funny how it takes one thing to turn mass downvoters into critics.
---
It seems to have been because they wanted to remove the "wall with no floor" exploit which required you to swap out roof pieces. 
---
Also, speaking of roofs, why do we still only have one type of roof and no interior corners?
---
That's probably a good thing to remember. I returned after a year, and between the Collectrons, repair/scrap kits, etc  there seemed to be lots if utility.
---
I dont really regret buying it, it has a good look for my herbivore garden, just wish it was actually useful
---
What scummy sales tactics did they use that are illegal in the EU? Just curious.
---
From patch 21 notes: 
---
* **"Walls:** Fixed an issue that could allow walls to be  snapped to overhanging roofs and upper floors, which could be used to  create floating walls."
---
The hilarious thing is how lazy this event is.  The story behind it is just bad. The reward list was bad when it was new. The rewards for actually completing it is just the opportunity to regrind events. I mean holy cow, whats going on. People would have been happier if they just pooled all the BOS event drop lists together, tweaked some of the drop rates, made sure all the calibrated shocks had a chance to drop, and called it a day. Add in the occasional script or treasury notes for extra credit. There is a ton of plans and items already in game that are so rare people would have grinded like crazy even if they had a 0.5% drop rate on this thing. But instead they went with grenades and liquor.
---
Thanks for your detailed and well written complaint, I hope that thhis dfrustration we are seeing so many have with Bethesdas decisions lately will cause them to think about how to move forward.
---
Neat thing about double walls is if you have a house with rooms the outter wall texture is now on the inside of the house.  This is a visual eyesore.  With double walls I can have wall paper on both sides, inside my building.  I think I'm understanding the "double walls" concept :/
---
Yeah idk why they think I'm comparing them as games. I'm definitely referring to the latter as in where your time is spent
---
Russell Dorsey is an Enclave plant, sent to turn people against the BOS before they get a foot hold in Appalachia and to steal all the steel before the BOS can get their hands on it.
---
I know people are really frustrated right now, but I find it hard to believe someone with over 1000 hours in the game won't come back when Steel Dawn and Fractured Steel drop, tbh.
---
Everything is deleyed except the new "event".
---
this event is pure bullshit. no one interested, not useful for low level (they haven't the materials) and totally stupid for high level, hey i dream about grenades...
---
80% of the patch note IS NOT TRUE ! 
---
SBQ cripple ? NO !
---
SS new mods ? NO !
---
patch for auto completion challenges ? NO !
---
Magic weapons ? NO !
---
Melting SBQ under 3secs ? NO !
---
Adrenaline Works now (Cool but yay the SBQ dies even quickier... RIDICULUS !)
---
But hey, we have patched what people used to have a little bit of fun.
---
AND PEOPLE CAN SAY "THANK YOU" !? ARE YOU CRAZY !? WHAT THE WHATTTT
---
Yeah. It's a steaming pile of shit. That is an informed opinion of someone who loves it and played it a shit ton. Go edit your comment more.
---
Do you not use the purveyor? I almost exclusively get urban and forest scout pieces.
---
How quickly can you gather water from the well? I hate gathering from sinks, and pumps because of the long animations.
---
Your point B is waay off the mark. Who do you think is buying all these overpriced CAMP item bundles? Who do you think just spent 1200 atom points for the new bundle *just* to get the junk walls for their CAMPS? 
---
The CAMP builders, the same people that are pissed about this "fix".
---
People are just bored and have nothing better to do. It’s the sad truth. One day, when I was lower leveled, I was just minding my own business and playing with my normal group. As you do, I fast traveled to my camp to drop some scrap and check on my vendors and what not. Saw 2 other players on the map, one closer to my level, the other a higher level. Thought nothing of it. As soon as I loaded in I was hearing explosions. These rude people had just decided that destroying the base of someone you never even interacted with was more fun than minding your own business. They were throwing these bombs I’ve never seen before, can’t remember the name. Destroyed almost my whole camp. I was very lucky that someone had recently gifted me an abundance of scrap, because I was able to build it all back almost immediately. I’m so sorry people are bullying.
---
yes! Also i like only 2 or 3 of the legendary run rewards. i dont even bother with the shity run. Todd is an ass
---
Except they put the least frequently used options (buy) at the top of the pick lists and the way more highly used feature (sell) on the bottom. They need to employ a REAL user interface designer/engineer.
---
The Vats thing is ridiculous for the shotgun and pistol. I was pretty happy about the BFFR Gauss pistol I rolled, but it can’t hit anything in Vats, so I’m back to my 10mm.
---
I like the duality this tread represents.  People complain and demand no advantages are given from atomic shop items. And so items like this are released and it is shitty because it really doesn't give an advantage.
---
Not any more. Worked very well before patch 20, got nerfed apparently.
---
mine has explosive damage too, it's silly
---
Should we just stop playing ? Doubt this will be fixed and this quest needs to be completed to even start main campaign .  What a joke
---
Give it another update, they’ll be sure to fuck it up again.
---
I have Mole Miner Gauntlet for 'sale' at zero caps and still no one buys it.
---
I'm not comparing them as games I'm comparing them as in "I have time to kill,  where do I kill it"?
---
Or just have plain walls and with wallpaper on both sides broken down into two kinds, outside paper and inside paper?
---
Feature? Maybe, existed since beta, loved by players, useful.... oh I see whats missing, they didn't get any money from us for this feature. Can't wait for them to sell us double walls in the atom shop.
---
Really? Been looking forward to Gauss shotgun and have fireproof in my build. RIP my excitement.
---
&gt; it needs raids, dungeons,  
---
It had those but people didn't want to do them because soloing them didn't give a x4 cap return rate on the resources spend to do it.
---
I never used the glitch really, but I was about to move and have the secret fireplace door just open up to a brisk wall. So much for that.
---
Isn't this the M.O. for Bethesda patches?
---
But, it’s not 1 little thing. 
---
There’s only 1 actual positive change with this patch that I can think of, and that’s fixing something they broke 3-4 months ago (Adrenaline). 
---
I can think of 4 things right off the top of the head that they changed/broke that are *negative*
---
So this patch is an absolute loss as far as I can tell.
---
Weight is for the same reason. It's hard to throw 50K on a mule if they weigh a pound each.
---
I keep seeing posts about the swap issue and wanted to point out that they've also killed this too
---
Nothing in the game has value. It’s a game played for fun and entertainment. Once you move past that you’ve lost perspective. 
---
You either play and have fun or you don’t. And if you don’t have fun you should stop.
---
If you want to do the event do it. If not then don’t. 
---
But all this bullshit about waste and value and such is just that. Bullshit.
---
The bottom line is because you feel the rewards don’t give you something amazing and awesome you have to make a big stink out of selfishness. 
---
That’s it. You literally want everything to be more and more because you’re entitled.
---
It's a bit long, but function wise it provides a good wack' of purified water per animation to make up for it.
---
Because they got bullied in school and no parents care about them. No I’m serious.
---
LoL yeah, I guess you're right. I'm a returning player, spent a year away. Guess I forgot the ATOM store was basically cosmetic.
---
Just wish we had something like Industrial water purifiers for dirty water.... or could use purified water in cooking.
---
Fair enough. I actually just removed a Large Water Purifier from my CAMP as I never bother taking/needing to take any out of it and selling water isn't worth taking up the CAMP budget when there's loads of way to sell things to vendors for Caps.
---
Stairs that you can put to the left or right side of any foundation/floor unit instead of being awkwardly in the middle (also, yes, that would include being able to put stairs going up along a wall but i bet bethesda can't even handle that lmao)
---
Spiral stairs that go directly up one level within the same unit/space
---
Let us put as many items as we want in one camp store vending machine so we don't have to keep reorganizing and forgetting which of our vending machines have which stuff since the lists are not separated
---
These people will always find something to bitch about. No matter how minute or petty it is... and if they can't find anything, they'll make something up. It's pretty amusing.
---
You're being combative and hostile against someone who doesn't even disagree with you that the game is problematic. 
---
I just wanted to react to the fact that disliking the state of the game isn't representative of the true game's health and thus saying it's "sinking" isn't factually true. Nothing more. 
---
I definitely didn't come in here to be dragged down in a hole with you. It's not a hill worth dying on.
---
Good luck.
---
They self destruct every Tuesday
---
Me too but I gave up on rank 70 two days ago. Got bit by the auto-complete bug and said enough is enough. The only two things I want out of the season are the backpack and Captain Cosmos PA skin. But I've been real with myself, I know for a fact I realistically won't use those rewards as I don't use PA and I can't bring myself to swap from my Blue Ridge Caravan backpack because I paid 6500 caps for the plan. 
---
I already have the black matte skin on my handmade and heard the blood eagle skin is broken. The chicken coop is useless to me. I don't care for the fireplace door and I've seen the planetarium in action and it's pathetic. Way smaller than I thought and barely lights up.
---
No, it just takes your explosive dmg resist from 30% (lvl 2) to 45% (lvl 3)
---
There adding multi-player to it down the road, you know.
---
Yes, let's all thank Bethesda for being consistently incompetent.
---
I hope this is because Bethesda will be releasing interior walls... otherwise totally unnecessary.
---
You sound like you are whining right now
---
My anger about the state of this game has fueled me to exercise on a regular basis.
---
my favorite was the supply drop crate that was following me around yesterday. every time i fast travel to new location, i'd hear the flare noise and the sound of crate dropping. inside, a combat knife and some scrap cloth. It became my friend.
---
I really don't mind that. If you misclick you are less likely to sell the ammo that you actually use this way. There were a couple of time I clicked buy .38 when I wanted to sell and it just gave me a transaction failed. Super relieved
---
Probably adding a cap to maximum SPECIAL stat boosts.  Say a maximum of 22 to 25, with additional buff/legendary effects doing nothing.  That seems like it would be the least painful way to partially rein in Bloodied/Unyielding builds and bring them a bit more in line with other metas.
---
A power armor rebalance is probably in order.  I shouldn't be weaker and less armored when I step into power armor.  If nothing else, they should explicitly add the damage reduction percentage to the power armor piece descriptions.  Reportedly, power armor has a flat percentage damage reduction, but you'd sure never know it from what the game actually tells you.
---
Getting a bit ahead of things, but I'd also say give out a couple Legendary Perk Coins as event rewards, like they're currently doing with Caps, Legendary Scrip and Treasury Notes.  I hope they're planning on doing that anyway, which would possibly explain why the legendary perk upgrade costs are so high on the PTS.  Or, alternately, they should reduce those costs.
---
I wish I could buy another player's treasury notes.  I just can't be bothered to do 90 percent of the events.
---
They want us to build pathetic little box shacks and that's it. Just a shack with some furniture in it like some of the crappy camps you see
---
2 dirty water xD for 500 atoms sounds about right, it's Bethesda.
---
&gt; But I don't want the event to fail.
---
If you think it will fail, then you don't understand how corporate business works.
---
Bethesda is never going to announce that the targets weren't met and the donation drive failed. Because to do so would be an indictment on the game itself. It would reflect badly on the playerbase numbers and player retention. Which would also make Bethesda look bad when compared to their competing companies.
---
Nope, I expect once this is all over, some fudged numbers are going to pulled out of the air, and the event will pass with flying colors and be a raging success ...regardless of what the players *actually* do.
---
Alcohol, which I get for free from my collectron.
---
Something like that is stuff I wouldn't write down, that's just a nice little glitch ya know? My top one is mirelurk kings stun locking my player to the point they glitch me into walls lol
---
because it bears the same IP and many assets from a single player, not a mystery
---
your reasoning is fine but boy howdy are your comments making me cringe big time
---
Also you bought Atoms, why? You're so against shit practice and still did it, to what benefit?
---
So it makes you completely immune to scorchbeast scream attack but not to bullets exploding too close. Seems legit. Guess I'll just go shoot it at the wall when I get it to kill off any excitement I had for getting it.
---
As if bugs are the only major problems this game has, even for base builders.
---
Yeah just wait until you want to sell a few large stacks of .38 and realize you've just paid a ton of ammo points to buy it.  Hopefully by then you're just used to the poor menu ordering and won't make the mistake.
---
It's not about earning caps, it's about getting rid of the crap you accrue during the course of normal gameplay.   
---
Stash limit and caps limit combined put a hard **stop** point on gameplay.   
---
Short of just throwing stuff away you reach a point where you can't loot, stash, or carry anything else. And if you can't loot anything there's not a whole lot of point in continuing.   
---
Compare to Fo4, with no outside force limiting your ability to play the game, you can do what you like when you like. Fo76, once you reach levels above 50 and finish the quest/story content, becomes a daily chore. You can't even wander aimlessly because any loot you find is a burden rather than a reward.
---
They can still work from home. It’s not like they have to mix concrete remotely...
---
I've had this happen since day 1, on PC, I have a video showing it happen somewhere on my computer though I don't think that will help in anyway as it just displays the bug.
---
What’s the point of this post?
---
I would also add: Making Ward sit in his office all day, its not like he was difficult to find in teh first place, it was either his office, bed or he was playing music.   
---
Now he has everlastying insomnia while still asking me to get the last water cooled bone saw that when I return with it he then reveals they actuallky have a few more of these.
---
# If you want to fix Ward give him more danm things to say than feckin BONE SAW
---
&gt; It's not. It's fucking NOT. The constant grind for gold bullion, that  sorry-ass piece of shit battlepass you call "content", THE ENDLESS  AMOUNT OF GLITCHES,   ALL THE DUPLICATED WEAPONS THAT REPLICATE THE HAND  OF GOD ITSELF, I'M SO SICK OF IT. 
---
Why are you so obsessively grinding for bullions? It is designed as a passive grind that happens as you play the game. Hence why you get the tokens from doing events.
---
Battlepass is fine. Lots of cosmetics unlocked without needing to pay a dime. Now if they start charging for the battle pass while also restricting your ability to earn atoms if you don't pay then maybe you will have a point.
---
&gt; Are. You. KIDDING. ME.? Is this a late ass April Fools prank cause I  ain't laughing. None of us are. My friends just said "Thats tough". No.  NO! I WAS WAITING FOR THIS FOR SO LONG! I STAYED WITH THIS GAME SINCE  THE BEGINNING, AND WHAT I GET EVERY TIME FOR WAITING IS A CURB STOMPED  BY TOD HOWARD HIMESELF. 
---
So you don't realize that working from home due to Covid has an effect on game developers? That by choosing to delay it they are trying to polish it as best they can. Remember how the entire community has repeatedly said they would rather see content delayed then released in a shit hole state?
---
And yet you are mad for them listening to their community. Ironic.
---
&gt; And the Atlas provisions. 
---
Are exactly what I expected them to be. You aren't going to be getting massive rewards for just depositing scrap.  They might as well be handing out 3 star legendary weapons for logging in.
---
maybe they are trying to glitch IN the mine xd
---
 Performance and Stability
---
* **Performance:** Fixed an issue that could cause client performance issues when attempting to stack many C.A.M.P. objects in a small space.  
---
Just saying. Sounds like this was the "stacking many items" issue that was causing problems.
---
whatzver Bethesda decides to do right now wont change anything. The vaste majority of players will migrate to Cyberpunk, the same way they did for TW3.
---
And Im very scared for TES6 sering hiw blatantly outdated this engine is and they dont want to dévelop a New one.
---
Camp building is the only end game left. And they screwed that up.
---
From my testing it appears to be a visual bug only. When I removed Class Freak my stats actually went down but when I added it back they were the same as before.
---
Man, even though some go overboard. You don't think they deserve criticism for this?
---
Nothing because I saw the rewards before the event started and figured that 250 Steel are better invested in ammo. 240 Steel (plus some lead and gunpowder) gives me 1080 .50 rounds.
---
I just realized they broke the wallpaper workaround when I accidentally destroyed a wall trying to scrap my newly unlocked game board and put it somewhere else. Knowing Bethesda, I probably ruined my C.A.M.P. forever. This is so annoying. 
---
Come to think of it I don't think they actually broke it, but rather they "fixed" it. Because now you can't replace a wall/windowed wall with a doorway and can't replace a doorway with a wall/windowed wall. I think they did this on purpose.
---
760 is of course better than 20, but they should really make it 1776 or 2776 or 7600. 760 by itself isn’t a meaningful number other than adding a 0 after 76.
---
Dunno if it's a visual bug or not. 
---
EDIT- actually I'm not sure what it is doing, seems to be visual though, as I unequipped it and my nerd rage went off, meaning I had some effects removed or changed, however unequipping/reequippnig the card solved it and they're all giving the correct effects now for me.
---
Just saying. Sounds like the wall thing was the "stacking many items" issue that was causing problems.
---
It's management and resource allocation. There's a pandemic hurting so many industries EXCEPT digital entertainment, and Bethesda STILL mismanages an extremely popular game. This is maddening! Why is Bethesda so bad at this? They deserve the terrible reputation that this game has earned them!
---
&gt; (spoilers don't bother me if anyone wants to fill me in).
---
They're code pieces, and funnily enough you don't even need them at all. There's a website that cracks the nuke launch codes every week. Everyone just uses that.
---
Criticizing this community for a completely misguided and hipocritical sense of activism, when the game has much worse problems and reasons to actually boycott it.
---
The Karen developer team really nailed it this time.
---
Broken for me as well. Made it halfway thru and had to log out and go to work. Tried again after work (and update) and now I cannot enter the cave. It's my first playthru and part of main quest so sorta frustrating.
---
Probably because the majority of players that play fallout 76 are single player PVE fans.  I wouldn't be playing this game if it wasn't because I love the fallout franchise.
---
When cyberpunk gets released I probably won't be logging in to fallout 76 for a few months.
---
 Seems like a logical comparison to me.
---
i love to see people saying it's just a game.
---
Sure it is, but it's their work too, if you want that your work have this quality... good for you. I personally find it totally crazy and shameful.
---
when they take your money it's vitual too ?
---
it's their job, we paid. It's totally normal to have a correct service behind, and it's not the case here.
---
I stopped buying atoms because the CAMP budget is too low for me to place any of the new stuff I might purchase with atoms.
---
You started the whole interaction by disagreeing with a word choice because you believe there can't be a sinking ship in vidya and then edit your comments to change your tone. I'm sure you commented to do exactly that. 
---
I am 100% with u, cancelled fo1st this morning.
---
You get XP when your teammates complete quests, it's possible you were right on the cusp of a challenge and that put you over. It's happened to me quite a bit.
---
Yeah, that sucked big time, and I guess that technically makes me a "Day 2" player and not a "Day 1" player.  Lol, I tried everything I could think of to get that shit to work on the first day of beta, and ended up having to get off Discord and Reddit to avoid spoilers.
---
Fair enough.
---
* **Performance:** Fixed an issue that could cause client performance issues when attempting to stack many C.A.M.P. objects in a small space.
---
They absolutely will get addressed. People are acting like the fucking world's collapsing in on itself. I'm getting flashbacks to Fasnacht, and what happened there? We got a few extra free items and the duration of Fasnacht was *doubled* after Bethesda took 24 hours to put a statement together.
---
Jesus. I'm certainly frustrated with this update too, but I can't believe that so many people are apparently making this their breaking point. (Like, literally cannot believe. I'd bet the majority of people who say they're quitting will come back for Steel Dawn/Fractured Steel. It's like that 'Boycott Modern Warfare 2' meme that gets passed around.)
---
It may have been accidental.   I couldn't place a wall with a door on the first floor of my two-story house before yesterday.   Today, I could.   So in fixing that, they broke something else.
---
Doesn't need to be duped. I still have a few dozens of these in my stash (as they have 0 weight) that I collected before I completed the Brotherhood faction quests on this character, which is needed to trigger Forbidden Knowledge. I have some of them for sale for 1 cap and sometimes sell them when the "buy or sell 3 items" daily challenge is up.
---
Me neither
---
Worst is there is no overview how much is collected. Site is not even updated...
---
They were also buggy, laggy, and broken as hell but go off
---
I bet if not everything gets I locked you’ll make up some bs excuse as to why it was in Bethesda’s best interest that they didn’t lie.
---
Went to go look wasn’t there.
---
Okay thanks I noticed that it didn't change my accuracy so I'll submit it as a bug and see what happens
---
I'm with ya. First playthru and now stuck on main quest. Worst part is I had almost finished 'Cheating Death' and had to log out and go to work. Got home and no entry.
---
At this point the only thing I want is an offline version and the creation kit.
---
Wasn't in a team
---
congrats?
---
no, thinking that someone else is obligated to do something they dont want is selfish.
---
Vendors show items as their drop name not the name people give them.
---
Another Bethesda patch. At this point, I am pretty much convinced Bethesda is Vault-Tec, and fo76 is a Vault-Tec experiment to see how badly a company can treat their customers and still survive. Every single patch seems to break as much as they fix, if not more. Old bugs constantly re-introduced, similar bugs constantly and they act surprised. Spending time on shit people do not care about and flat out ignoring issues for months or years that actually effect players enjoyment. 
---
The only logical explanation is they flat out disrespect their customers and are conducting experiments. You have to work at being this bad.
---
oh. well you should be playing on a public team. free XP and caps.
---
I really think that Bethesda is dead if they dont develop a New game engine...
---
Simply because of how bad their games will look on this outdated engine and how buggy the games will be, even after 5 or 6 years of développement.
---
Wait, at one time grass did not come through the floor?  I've been playing since mid May, and that is my least favorite camp building issue.  I once disassembled my whole camp, because I had grass coming up through one corner of my floor.  If I had raised the foundation my fence would not have lined up, tower would not have connected,  etc.
---
That's it right there.
---
Same. Stuck at the door.. Trying to finish Cheating Death.
---
I have been lurking this sub since it's inception.
---
Can't believe people still play this game when there are so many other games out there that are not made by a serial cash grabber. 
---
I wish you all the best with your endeavor and hope the will make fallout great again.
---
Its been broken/bugged for ages. I put 250 50cal rounds in the sbq's head in 1 vats click and the bar didn't move. Seems to be worse the more players are around u. Same way u can jetpack to the moon with enough other players around.
---
YES!  
---
HATE THIS BUG SO MUCH!  
---
Happens for me right after fast travel and the only option that helps me - use sprint again.
---
Funny you mention 7D2D, I picked it up during the Steam Summer sale and played it for about a week.  I really enjoyed it and will be playing some more.  But in a lot of ways it made me want to play 76...   :|  
---
...I think I may have a problem.
---
It absolutely is.
---
&gt; The Atom Shop has been selling overpriced items since launch, many of  those ported Fallout 4 assets and using scummy sales tactics (some of  which are literally illegal in the EU) 
---
Everything in the world is over priced depending on how you look at it. 
---
&gt; Fallout 1st, not only being an overpriced service that gives subscribers  an unfair advantage (storage convenience, a problem which Bethesda  created themselves, only to sell the solution under a subscription  later) but is also a complete break of the promise that the game’s  monetization would be purely based on cosmetic items 
---
$99 USD for a year and you get like $120 USD in atoms for the year. Plus private servers, junk and campsite. Not really over priced for the value you get.   
---
That said junk storage isn't needed at all. People scream advantage but that really is only an advantage if you are a mindless hoarder who carries around 500 of each junk for no reason what so ever.  I think it speaks more to the uncontrollable hording habbits of people to think this is an advantage.
---
&gt; PvP has been completely gutted, survival mode removed, Nuclear Winter having recieved 0 content updates 
---
PvP was never popular. Survival mode maps were empty. Nuclear Winter really doesn't have any new content to add besides a new map location. 
---
&gt; Broken events, game breaking bugs, atrocious balancing 
---
Yea but what does Fallout 3, NV and 4 have to do with 76?
---
&gt; But a C.A.M.P. mechanic being removed is where you guys draw the line?  Everything else is tolerable, but an unecessary bug fix is where people  are cancelling their subscriptions? 
---
People are amusingly random.
---
There are multiple You Tube videos on this already. I know of others that I don't share.
---
How is FO76 an MMO ?
---
The gates have killed it for me, along with the garbage rewards for Rebuilding Atlas.  Playing another game until at least Meat Week, if not September.
---
I play WoW as a singleplayer PVE game. Very rare I enter to raids there. But I know it is still an MMO, not a singleplayer rpg.
---
Yeah, your choice seems logical. I do not care about Cyberpunk, but Ill take a break in F76, when WoW's new expansion comes out in fall/winter.
---
From what most people were saying it is because I am using a semi-auto Assault Rifle, I will try and hunt down something different instead. I am not doing bad damage at all, it is just not that much better compared to what I was doing before, but I did have a Two Shot Explosive Assault Rifle, I will try and get a Fixer or Lever Action with Bloody on it.
---
Serums in particular are nice when you get close to the caps limit.  They're commonly available from player vendors for 400 to 500 caps, and sell for that value to NPC vendors.  (I get 470 caps with Charisma 8 and level three Hard Bargain, 500 if I pop a Grape Mentats.)   But it is inconvenient to only be able to cash in a couple of them at a time.
---
That said, it's not too hard to make that much selling off weapons after a longish play session.  That's only 56 weapons at an average of 25 caps each to hit the 1400 caps mark.  Not unreasonable, but you do have to target your grinding to get it.
---
Seems like jumped ship at a perfect time, I beat wastelanders a couple months ago and I haven't played the game since. Just seems line everything is getting worse and it's not doing a great job enticing me to come back
---
They did exactly what the community wanted them to do. They just can't win
---
Also make him be nicer. Accept his quest and if you don't leave immediately, he starts complaining that you should be out looking for the lost item in an angry tone.
---
My Tesla rifle was fine last night.   Not sure what is up with OP's.
---
It is a online multiplayer game. So it is an MMO.
---
Welcome to your second day on Reddit!  If you're on your phone, swipe to the right to see a list of (heavy quotes) "popular" posts!
---
Better DPS, cores can get lighter with perk card. 1 core is significantly lighter than 250 2mm. Explosive works better than gauss. Only thing gauss has over it is it looks way cooler.
---
Yup, the moment I hit that cancel button I started thinking about how I was going to have to go full "loot vacuum" for the next month or so while I still have that scrap box.  The BOS ain't getting shite from me!!!
---
I donated 250 steel to get a box of stimpacks, water, and other crap I sell because I have too much of it already.  Steel, on the other hand, I need to farm constantly to make ammo and repairs etc.
---
I won't be donating anything else.
---
And that ammo convertor?  Man.....added it again, tried it, and found it an even worse experience than version 1.  I scrapped it again.
---
I AM happy that I can now continue my Daguerre quest line, so there's that I guess?
---
I dont see why base building is the hill to die on in this game.  If you love base building so much, play a game that was really intended for it.
---
Don't be one of those people that throws around Karen like it means every insult that you are too lazy to think of a real name for
---
You're better than that man
---
I just feel like if they just listened and cared it wouldn't be a problem. 
---
When I'm done with cyberpunk, what are my reasons currently to go back to Bethesda? Bad communication? Constant nerfs?  The endless disappointment?  It's all I'm saying...
---
Yeah I always make sure to look at the effects and the levels of everything I buy, I think I just need to try and get lucky with a different type of rifle or start using automatic instead of semi-auto.
---
Walk to up the nearest stream and spam the collect button. I build my camp near water for that specific reason.   
---
I do agree about cooking with purified water however. We should be allowed to do that and remove the rad effect.
---
the grind for one the power and distance are huge but most of all the ammo. 2mm the easiest to make. it would be great if vats was ever fixed.
---
No one is saying we weren’t complaining about the many other bugs but a large group of players stayed for the building.
---
Simple.  People are dicks. I always try and help lower levels. It's just the right thing to do.
---
On my first playthru and made it halfway thru Cheating Death had to go to work. Got home couldn't enter Carleton Mine. Searched here this morning. Yup it's broken. It's a main quest ffs. I really like this game, but every patch it seems to run worse, have more glitches and cause me confusion as a newer player. Anyways it sucks - I am basically stuck unless I want to go Foundation route or play my alt I just started.
---
yep, this is how to do it
---
" And great to hear that it doesn't give rads... "
---
Probably a bug that will get fixed with the next patch!    LOL
---
I might pull my weight on this one:
---
August 31 – September 3
---
Deliver 200,000,000 Cloth 
---
Brotherhood of Steel Collectron Station.
---
I don't know how many players there are or how many that are up to this so I don't have any idea if the other 'rewards' are doable
---
Depends on which glitch you are refering to the double wall glitch allowed people to create interior walls that allowed them to use the wall papers to make the structures look closer to a real house or divide up a house like you have in your home without it looking like you've ripped out a wall from a barn or such you could replace those walls with normal walls therefore creating a dividing point in your house which could be used to make rooms.
---
I had the same thing happen with the same plan.
---
It's worth noting, too, that this and other service style monetization schemes (I'm thinking of Wolfenstein: Youngblood and ESO, specifically) to come out of Bethesda is after ZeniMax media, their parent company, came under the influence of a private equity company, Providence Equity Partners. 
---
Much like what happened with Toys R Us and Sears, there's an aggressive push to cut costs and boost profits for shareholders, while endangering the brand and IPs under its control through an overall reduction in quality of the produced product.
---
The creatives working on this and other games are likely under an immense pressure, which I think can help explain these persistent issues.
---
No people were specifically claiming about the poor payout at the end and having to spend more ammo then they got back.
---
They didnt add ANYTHING for limbs. They added shit for chest but nothing else
---
It is a single fire. It is easier said than done to just use XXXXX weapon as it is all RNG, even in player shops most of the good shit is already gone, despite me having caps I cannot spend them.
---
I did a quick google search of the best sound proofing materials available and found that plastic, fiberglass, cloth, wood, and rock wool beat cork in that category.
---
Which in no way means that this isn't what Bethesda has in mind, their lack of imagination is just a bit disappointing.
---
Yeah, and CDPR confirmed it probably won't be until at least 2022.
---
So Star Wars Old Republic is a single player game too? It bears the (almost) the same name as the Star Wars Knights of The Old Republic...
---
&gt; Your move, Bethesda, or I do not see any future game sales recovering from this farce. 
---
Don't fool yourself. 
---
While I agree with the overall post I can guarantee you that the moment Smuglord Howard enters the stage to announce the next installment of whatever people will fall all over themselves to applaud Bethesda for it. He'll even work in a joke or two about their games being buggy because that's what he's read on the internet.
---
i think i have a junkies radium
---
Ah ok, didn't know that.
---
I dont think you understand.  I'm talking about the secret service armor. Not the scout armor
---
That's what I do currently. I run a multitude of food buffs in a session, and easily burn 50 dirty water a session.
---
No problem. Yeah I had a bunch but yesterday when I logged on it will say on top left corner of screen that they will self destroy. But I don’t know why I even collect them because if you run silo and get to end look up nuke codes for the week. So much easier then decrypting code.
---
So yeah that gives fo76 time to marinate. But if it doesn't improve by then, idk man.
---
You can easily do both stealth and vats.
---
I wanted to like bows, but they suck. I’m sticking to crossbow. They suck slightly less.
---
Thanks for the pointers! I will take a look and try and change my build up. I never bothered much with Vats but I could start using it with a build.
---
&gt;And for those people saying "no one cares" or whatever - it seems quite a few people agree with the sentiment, so go pound sand
---
Haha.  I love your sauciness. 
---
But yeah, I'm a pre-BETA player with 2,000 hours into the game and I'm not going to sink anymore money into it.  I bought a year of Fallout 1st but I'm cancelling when that's up.  They are focused on all the wrong things with this game.  As much as I love about the game, it's always *something*.
---
 The TSE nerf had to happen.  There was absolutely no reason to use any other kind of weapon in the game.  Once you had one, no legendary weapon you'd randomly find was worth even picking up prior to the purveyors release.
---
Just build a water pump (ingame plan), water well (settlers reputation) or clean sink (S.C.O.R.E. reward), press the drink button then spam the collect button while the animation is running. You will get around 30-60 dirty water depending of the animation of the furniture, extra kudos for the water well because it have the longest animation and doesn't radiate you.
---
Save those 500 atoms for anything more worth.
---
I got lucky and started the download with about 35 mins to go before launch. I have a 200mbps connection so that helped. I was able to get the file downloaded and installed in about 28 minutes. I was so happy to be greeted with someone yelling why they we're stuck in a wall, another guy live streaming and dictating his every move and a third guy eating loudly in his mic. We didn't know about the hot mic issue right away. It was so bad but yet it was fun to experience how awful it was at launch. I don't think a game can launch worse than this one ever.
---
Nitpicking? A game that a lot of people payed full price for, is still broken, and objectively worse, is nitpicking? Every paying customer has the full damn rights to pick at every nit this game has. Maybe if issues that have been asked for months to be fixed were fixed, and it were just small minor issues, but being a day one player, damn I still recognise half these bugs that they can go on Disney's Classic collection.
---
It's still bad to use
---
This is understandable. But I do not count WoW as a F76 killer, nor Doom, nor Starcraft2.
---
I fully agree.
---
Well, I am holding out a sliver of hope that we are MEANT to fail and that it will figure into the story line somehow, but honestly I suspect that idea is as unreal as Santa Claus :(
---
Psycho isn’t gonna buy itself!
---
You may be ok with their performance but I can't justify constantly coming back to a middle finger. I do like the game. I'm not trying to see it fail. In fact I want it to flourish.
---
Same, I built a fence and theres only one entrance that I gotta open for them to get in, unless y'all jump over
---
I think that this sub has a toxic habit of bandwagoning on issues as if it even matters. It's all about hating the newest thing that doesn't meet expectations. It's the toxic youtube videos except in written form. Play or don't play, don't spend money on it, but every post bitching about the updates? Nah
---
I would rather donate my building supplies to the true builders of this community you screwed over instead of a bunch of drunk BOS scumbags #freethebuilders
---
Big fan of the game, but great post. Really a shame the path they are choosing. 
---
No worries Bethesda a few more patches like that and their won’t be an active fan base to patch the game for. Keep it up!
---
86 bugs in the code. 86 bugs in the code. Take one out, patch its around, 99 bugs in the code
---
And working from home takes a lot longer and is harder to do.  Uploading and downloading over the internet takes a lot more time then simply using a LAN to upload and download in an office between systemsm
---
You can get a magic gauss minigun pretty easily.  I think if you compare "fair" versions, legacies are better, but w/ magic on the table, it really doesn't matter.
---
You can do wired through walls. Use wooden windows, connect the wire through the window, then switch to whatever wall you want. Not ideal, but you can still do it.
---
Good call! Honestly after this fo76 is only still installed to reserve storage space for cyberpunk
---
Bethesda going to kill it long before anything else in my opinion. The replayability in cyberpunk is really why I would call it a killer.
---
At first glance the listed effects numbers don’t seem to line up with the special numbers when you check them. But not totally sure what’s up since the patch.
---
Everything you just said is bullshit. I want a camp items to work when they are released. I want items to actually be excited over. I want cool plans that are rare and can't be gotten easily from any other event in the game. I want to not waste a valuable resource on a artificial event that doesn't even really add much to the game. 
---
There is not even a single fight to go along with it or a side quest. For fuck's sake you unlock a double point weekend or w/e instead of them just giving it to you like every other time. Such a low effort update where the things they said they added "deep pocketed secret service arms"" are not even in the game,also others found plans that are more unique and rare supposed to be on the list for the even'ts loot but it's disabled instead of being in the game like it was flagged to be and they care so little they won't even hotfix the bugs in a timely manner while the event is still going when it matters the most.
---
Yeah but how does the gameplay you have in this game, eveb if its massively (could even argue about that) multiplayer and online will differ from the Gameplay of a game like Cyberpunk ? Besides 1 event (scorched earth), everything else is designed exactly the same way if it was added in FO4 for example.
---
There is no raids, no dungeons, no mass PvP, not even any Kind of PvP, and lore importantly, the interactions between players are marginal.
---
So yes, its sold as an MMORPG but its far from being one and its close to FO4 than WoW for example.
---
Amen
---
All you mentioned was the easy tasks try levelling up a high level character and dont leave out the wastelanders daily quests to get gold 
---
I'm sorry but I have a life outside of fallout and I need a game that does not pretend to be a mobile styled game
---
Yeah. Also this is a game that you can scrap and reuse wood. Where several pencils can be turned into a wall for you home. 
---
So.
---
that building change is essentially them saying "Fuck your creativity buy our prefabs"
---
It’s super crazy. The outrage does not equal what happened at all.
---
this update did nothing the community wanted lol
---
You mentioned the subscription. I was going to get one before this patch because i was getting really into the game and wanted the junk box and everything else included. After seeing how they botched this patch, i dont think i will lol. At least i got the game through game pass so i never actually spent any money on bethesda yet
---
At least they fixed the fast travel bug...
---
LOL kidding.
---
As weird as it sounds maybe we should go after there investors then?
---
Why have a pocketed AND a deep pocketed mod? Is there a difference other than one holds more stuff? Just seems like a waste to have both.
---
your team bond
---
You can just do the math yourself.  It's not that complicated.
---
people use explosive bait to damage camps.
---
I wasn't talking to you, was I?
---
What is meant by "What really gets me is that you expect us to be ok with wasting our resources to unlock a double SCORE weekend?"
---
What's this talking about?
---
Free platform man. If you disagree that's completely ok. I'm not that "stop having fun guy". Like I said it's just my two cents given the current climate, that's all.
---
Ha, so bugs have really become features that people want to keep in the game? Only Bethesda could have pulled this off lol.
---
I understand but what I meant is that even if they start Caring, the game is so buggy that the result will still be bad and players will still be mad at them ag least for that.
---
I'm nearly there too. Just beyond aggravated with them adding more restrictions. Unless they revert this change I'm going to cancel before it renews next month, and likely try to find another game to play, because building is half the fun of this game for me. If they're going to basically say "yeah we're going to keep significantly dumbing down what you can build, we don't care" by keeping a change like this one then what's the point of staying around. I've put up with enough already.
---
lol, i never knew this, been running bloodied without it. If I didn't die every now and again combat wouldn't be exciting
---
I farmed 15k steel in the last few days and donated them yesterday. This was a lot for me as I don't have Fallout 1st. Most useful thing was caps, then sugar bombs and some of the alcoholic drinks that I keep for the daily quest with the bot in the tattoo studio. I sold all grenades and dropped the floater versions. All plans that I got I already know, even though I still miss a lot of plans. I just added them to me vendor station for 5 caps each and will see if anybody wants them.
---
Okay, if this is the reason, they should have introduced double-sided walls.
---
I think autocomplete bug was a pretty big thing they fixed. 
---
What were the major things broken in the patch that I haven’t been paying attention to?
---
I don't want the bonus XP though. This game is easy enough as it is, I kinda dislike how quick you level up and breeze through things
---
Patch 21 Proves only one thing about Bethesda and how they treat the players nowadays, they'd probably lie and screw over even a Make a wish foundation kid..
---
Bonds develop with team members over time. More bonds means a higher multiplier for the team bonus.
---
The update itself is pretty bare but the community has been very adamant that bethesda test and refine content before releasing, especially after fasnacht with the animal spawns being bugged a month prior
---
I had the issue. It’s certainly a bug.
---
Give this people air
---
In gameplay, it differs that F76 will be here for a few more years, CP will be forgotten, like Outerworlds. They said, OW will kill F76, and that is an Obsidian game, a good one. Still, F76 is not dead.
---
Each bond aplies +1 bonus
---
This is how I feel about 99% of questions people ask on here. A 2 minute google search would answer your question.  Why should I.
---
Idk though. Hello games was in the same boat until they reached out to their community.
---
Bonds that Will increase slowly over time and when the blue fills the bar you will get bonuses depening on your team goals
---
Nobody gives a fuck.
---
If their idea of "many" is two...I have additional concerns.
---
Two walls is not "many CAMP objects", and the "Performance" label never before meant that they altered a functionality, just that doing that thing doesn't cause a performance problem anymore.
---
So I really doubt that's the case.
---
I think fixing auto complete was a pretty great change for a lot of players. 
---
What are the 4 awful thins broken in this patch?
---
I’ve only reached the Grafton vendors so far, been going every day for the past 1-2 weeks and haven’t found the plan on sale yet
---
I decided to try and do a quick steel run to see what I could get in 15 minutes. 2012 steel with scrapper perk. I just do not under the whine some of you people make. It is a game do an event or don't, don't whine about 3 minutes wasted.
---
Except I have said if you don’t want to do the event you don’t have to. 
---
I make that very clear. This wasn’t about you have to do the event. 
---
This was about not trying to get others to help you tank the event.
---
Only selfish people can’t see that. Because selfish people lack reading ability.
---
Maybe not sorry I'm at work quick readin.
---
First Welcome! 
---
Second... take everything you read here with a grain of salt. 
---
Third... Just play. I've been here from day 1 and I've experienced only a tiny fraction of the things that people here constantly bitch about.
---
As a bow main (yes) I was also disappointed by that change. 
---
You can have a mutant be 3 ft in front of you and vats will 100% miss but yes sure ruin manual firing instead
---
Here ya go! :D

---
Hahaha me too. My purchases were always porpoiseful.
---
Yeah they didn’t get added.
---
I run 2. Ribeye steak and Sweet Tato Stew only because cows spawn near my camp and I can grow everything for the stew and with green thumbs I double my harvest.
---
Is Bethesda even playing the game? I mean is like they dont know what is good or bad and what is priority and what is not. Also it look like they dont even try the new things they add and verify if it works properly.
---
That's an old bug I had like over a year ago. They just rotate bugs.
---
Drink, then spam collect? I didnt know that.
---
I like the look of the rain barrel in the garden, somehow I just expected more production, or options to  build bigger like the purifier water.
---
Thanks for the drink/harvest tip though. I didnt know that.
---
Are you unaware that you can earn atoms in game?  You never have to spend real money, just play the game
---
Don't worry, Bethesda can literally not allow this event to fail because it would imply that the playerbase isn't big enough to get it done. Bad PR and all that.
---
The event will succeed, we will get the rewards, done.
---
The only way to make Bethesda change their way is not buying the Atom Store shit and roasting them constantly until they either pull the plug on this failed experiment or get their shit together.
---
Let's be honest. Beth has already made their coffin at this point. People will come back, I know this,  but I seriously doubt it'll be a ton of people like they have currently.
---
I couldn’t agree more with you! Drives me nuts especially when there still exists exploits and broken weapons since day 1. Don’t blame the players blame Bethesda...because everyone has used an exploit in a game at some point in their life plus if they want to play it that way by all means knock yourself out because this isn’t even a pvp game.
---
If this is your arguement, then Terraria was a fo76 killer for me.  When the most recent update came out for it, I played it quite a bit.
---
Bethesda doesn’t care about VAT people.
---
If I wanted to make a garden, I'd make a garden. If I put down foundation for a room, or even a porch or some such - I want the floor on the ground, without the weed underneath growing through it.
---
But you're giving a bonus to other people as well.
---
Whats the bigger kicker is that SBQ not being crippled isn't a bug, she got a new buff tag onto her that prevents her from being crippled. That was the attempted anti-melt fix for the SBQ, was introduced with wastelanders, but not on the patch list. All they need to do is revert that change (they've acknowledged and passed onto the "team"), yet here we are. 
---
Also, if you want a tip, look at the release dates for new content, add a month onto that date, maybe 3 if you're feeling generous, that'll be the correct date.
---
Right! It was a fun trick that in no way whatsoever bothered other players.!!
---
And another bug worth mentioning that is detrimental to new players: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/cant_enter_carleton_mine/
---
Unable to complete the Raiders quest for the Wasteland story, since we are unable to enter the mind in both PC and Xbox (reported so far)
---
Definitely sucks :(
---
I'm not a F1st player, I rarely have the stash space to horde any quantity of material...so I'd have to go out and do scrap runs over and over to really participate in this, and hope that I don't overload so I can fast travel there.
---
This is an event for F1st players...do a scrap run, dump in scrap box at mobile camp then move on and repeat until you're ready to dump at Atlas.
---
I don't intend to waste my time trying to go back and forth there while I have all these other grinds they've given me. I'll leave it to the F1st players to add all the materials since it's so much easier for them. If we get the rewards great....if not then \*meh\*.  I had planned on helping a friend who has F1st but since nothing is tradeable then why bother.
---
I fully believe this is a Hanlon's razor situation, but replace 'stupidity' with 'incompetence'. If you notice, that's *really* not an endorsement of Bethesda.
---
Yeah, Bethesda will kill it, they are already doing it. But Outer Worlds are also have much replayability, and it was said, it will kill F76 as soon it comes out. It never happened. OW is a great singleplayer game, and such, has limits. F76 is an MMO, and such, it has less limits, they can add more and more for years. Bethesda doing a semi-bad job with this, they could do it much better. But as we said: Bethesda ruins F76.
---
Good luck 🤞 probably not playing this again
---
Its a direction issue overall. This patch is just amplified by that. It you let the negativity of this patch (which is well deserved) convince you to not come back youre probably gonna have a hard time convincing yourself to come back.
---
You'll probably be changing that tune in September when they implement Legendary Perks and realize you didn't save enough Levels/Perk Cards to max out the Legendary Perks of your choice.
---
I know there are 76 more of these already but the more you whinge and bitch, the more likely the Bethesda CMs are to see, not that they do anything that provides results...
---
Its not dead yet, yes, but simply because no games will keep players out of it for long enough.
---
Im pretty sure that most of the players thar will leave for CP wont come back, even when they finish playing CP.
---
Just look at the numbers before the game became aviable on the Xbox pass, they were really bad, and not that long after an update that générated positive buzz around the game.
---
It would be hilarious if someone actually duped millions of cork scrap.  I don't think that one is getting done.
---
I have melons, carrots, tato, blackberry, corn, razorgrain, in the garden. I also have firecracker, soot flower and silt bean nearby. I basically make 2 or 2 of every single food/drink I can and run Good With Salt. The "perma" bugs I have from food are amazing
---
I doubt the wall part was the issue described there. Having two walls seperately should take up the same performance and camp budget. It really shouldn't matter if they're in the same spot or not.
---
And besides, it's not like anything changed for the CAMPs that currently still have double walls from before the "fix". Those still exist.
---
Exactly!!! They have showed cases camps using this and many other glitches. So they were ok with players doing it.
---
If they are going to change something like this they should have thought father ahead.
---
And when there's other better options out there, and this keeps happening over and over, would you be inclined to come back?
---
Its cool you were worried for your firend, but that is not relevant here to this subreddit. This isn't a "thoughts and prayers" place.
---
Yeah, the flying scorched corpses are very satisfying. If your standing in the right spot up on the hill above the parking lot it's like watching a sadistic form of volleyball. Plus any stragglers in the area with unfailingly run straight through the lot and get blown up too. I love getting a quest that sends me to or near Valley Galleria. I always start the chain reaction with a Nuka grenade because of how the explosion looks. I love the Nuka grenade. Bakeretsu, bakeretsu, la, la, la!
---
I feel like there was no real goal with this game when it was created, and now each dev lead changes the goal to what they had envisioned. 
---
All I keep seeing is Bethesda saying "No, you can't enjoy the game that way...We want you to play it this way!"
---
Much of it is sheer incompetance.
---
Well unfortunately We don't get to send out TOS agreements to all of our customers completely divesting myself of any and all liability for the product and any issues that may arise with it.  
---
Video game development is one of the few privileged professions,where you can royally fuck up and face absolutely 0 negative repercussions for it.  It is what it is.
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
Holy crap.  I'm getting more and more depressed reading this BS.  I mean I use slanted roofs all the time, how the hell will you close the gap now?
---
A few months prior, it was possible to crash a server by building multiple (of a certain type) walls in a single space. More recently, people were able to glitch and expand their build budgets to extreme degrees. Many of those camps were filled with double-walls, sometimes in the amount that it that could cause stability issues. Additionally, (in rare edge cases) this instability could allow access to those players’ stash boxes through the vendor. edit: double-walls were definitely not the sole reason for instability, but their existence did contribute to what was already a problem with SOME overloaded camps.
---
There ARE actual reasons for this fix, but there’s absolutely been nothing communicated to the general player base why this was possibly in their interest. If Bethesda had explained and/or paired FREE double-walls to us, this response would have been at least somewhat muted.
---
The brotherhood of steal (intentional) is gonna build a wall and make us Appalachians pay for it. Nah.
---
same
---
I guess this means the glitched/stacked (call it what you want)  shelves with items inside. When you have 2 or 3 full glitched/..... Shelves in a row or corner. But I can't imagine that the walls cause performance issues because I build all my camps with he double wall thing and never had performance issues and I have like 50% of my budget just for walls.
---
That’s my new goal! Sounds more fun than collecting SCORE!
---
Unrelated. Don't try to make the bullies into victims.  Bethesda needs to add content to the game, but there are plenty of other things a player can do to make their own fun in the game that doesn't involve ruining someone else's fun. 
---
You have to be a certain type of person to enjoy those activities, and using Bethesda is just an excuse.
---
Nope. No rads.
---
Legit gave 2000 steel and dropped everything I got out the provisions on the ground. I hope this event fails to complete. No new “rare” plans for my hard earned horde of resources.
---
Hm old repair allows to repair weapons/armor in inspect view like it was before think the nw update i think, dunno why it should effect the build menu but may a combination of my mods caused this bug. 
---
I've also have a bug that i can't select the wallpaper menu in buildmode i usually disable mods to place wallpapers (since wallpapers are placed once you build the walls it does not brothered me much) but this bug is related to the replacement bug i guess.
---
"I've played through it all because despite the problems, I am addicted to the Bethesda "secret sauce" gameplay loop and I believe this game has the potential to be something better than it is." 
---
\^\^\^this is me...every bug, every updated bug, every fucking time I log in...why am I here? why do I keep doing this to myself?!? because of the fucking potential...
---
On the bright side though - it does have a really nice transmog/customization system that is way better than FO76. I rarely felt the need to spend real money in that game because of the free transmog system it provided.
---
This is the real crime of the update, right here.
---
It happens all the fucking time in this community. It's hard to take it seriously at this point because people treat every misstep with the same level of severity and outrage. It'll blow over in a bit when people stop getting so much karma and awards for saying that they're leaving 4evr and most of them will slink back in.
---
We agree on this. Don't forget stubborness
---
Unfortunately so far based on posts I read it seems that Patch 21 broke an Ounce of Prevention quest for that single change to that quest they made and it broke some instance quest areas this includes Cheating Death and From Russian with Lev quests.
---
You can either hope for Bethesda to push for a hot fix in the next couple of days or your looking at waiting 4-6 weeks from now when they release patch 22 in September for a fix.
---
Shhh
---
Yeah I wonder if this is just some /r/Gamingcirclejerk post in disguise?
---
Didn’t say he couldn’t use cards from both, but he’s better off focusing on one and going from there. he’s not going to have the space to 3* all of them.
---
I honestly just want the ability to change wall and have them floating as I need it for building. I never used double walls to save budget,so i'd be fine with just that revert.
---
Wow. Who cares
---
Do both. Especially the cancelling fallout 1st.  The great lack of understanding their player base is just insane.
---
Can't cook with purified water. Which makes the rain barrel more useful than my water purifier (which also can only hold two purified waters but  between finding it around the world and it only useful for drinking I get more purified water than I can even sell to players so I usually end up dropping a lot).
---
&gt; I keep reading posts of people having their camps destroyed
---
Enemies (ie: mobs) can destroy it as well. And it can even happen when the owner isn't at their base. It only needs *some* player to be nearby to spawn the enemies in, and then they can go to town.
---
Just to see what would happen, I once stayed in stealth mode near somebody's camp that was located right next to WestTek. Why they built it there I have no idea, but it didn't take long for the level 60+ super mutants to lay waste to the entire thing.
---
Then I stand corrected. Thank you.
---
Devs != Upper management.
---
The downvotes will likely begin, but this is the perfect time to showcase that it's only Bethesda's fault when it affects them. That is the mentality of many here. If it doesn't affect them, then whoever did the exploit is a witch and should get bent.
---
But if you’re on pacifist it protects you from it right.
---
...oh no, the game I want to be hard is gonna get marginally harder. What ever shall I do
---
Like you leave the vault level 1 and immediately kill 10 liberators with just your fists. I absolutely would not mind a difficulty spike
---
I wasnt planning on participating until I saw all of the stupid boycott threads rolling through the sub..
---
its gonna kill me too.. I fucking hate the BoS...
---
slightly inspirational
---
I'm looking forward to donating lots of glass. You get so much of it, but it's barely used for anything.
---
More than once I found him glitched inside the rocks outside Foundation so having him stationary was a nice plus for me.
---
I think their thought on the event rewards this time was "ok they said no head plans, also they hated the grind for the ultra rare plans last time so we'll just make those community rewards"
---
The problem is their solution went straight from impossible difficulty to participation trophy, discounting the fact that people want something to show for turning in more rewards than other people did.
---
Really a great point:  I think Bethesda has pissed off the wrong people with this fix.  More than any group, the builders are likely the biggest one to throw money at the game and likely have the least negative impact on the player base, and now THEY are mad.
---
If we’re going to care this much about performance, we better tear down Berkeley springs.  I’ve not once run into town and not had loading waits on the buildings there, unless I’m just not “supposed” to run places.
---
The root cause of all of this is that the walls we have are just not that great, and one can use the wallpaper (still not that great imho) and spice up the build a bit.  Well, the root cause is the engine, but let’s not go there...
---
The Fortifying Atlas bullshit where if we donate enough resources (150 MILLION+ OF each Steel, Cork and etc) we get another DOUBLE SCORE event that they fucking owe us already for all the autocompleted challenges.
---
I gave up 5k in steel and got jack ish for it and I won't be doing it anymore. Seems like they just give the same rewards everytime they add new stuff to the game. I just wish they fix the game period BEFORE adding more content.
---
You don't need to. My build is posted in this thread. It is hyper efficient and effective
---
Thats the main difference with singleplayer games and mmos. Singleplayer games have a limited lifespawn, even if you could replay it 50 times in different ways. MMOs, if they do it right, can live years and years. Bethesda will kill F76, not other games.
---
Bought me a few hundred fusion cells last night and then noticed my points were going down.  Before the fix the option to sell was on top and buy was on the bottom when selecting what to do.  Now they flip the order around just "because".
---
Auto complete was patched dude..
---
Yea, I saw the patch note "Now Ward will stay in his trailer in Foundation"... were there players out there that couldn't set Vital Equipment to active and find the easily seen diamond shape?
---
It boggles my mind that they put effort into 'fixing' things that were not broke.
---
Wow, been playing almost since the beginning and I’ve barely seen anywhere but Whitesprings and the SBQ spot hit.  But I guess if you have a camp in a commonly hit spot you’re going to remember every time that spot gets hit!
---
Star Wars, as an IP, is expected to be a very broad brand that broke off from it's OG format in the 80's - a move which happened with relative lightspeed (for it's time) by comparison to the Fallout IP. Also, the point I was making is that it isn't totally absurd that people are confused by the format switch, not an ironclad apology as to why everyone is entitled to be confused always.
---
Kinda lost faith but there wasnt much to begin with. Their ability to put out content in general as well as on time is going downhill.
---
Legendary perks are Nice but as he said, The game is easy enough as it is. We really dont need more buffs than what we have. Im really exited for it though
---
if you're unhappy and you know it...
---
I was all about Settlers when I started, but I’ve switched to Raiders. Pretty sure I can teach them how to farm and be self-sufficient. Settlers will stay inept assholes.
---
Here’s the one that gets me. They patched lifegiver without that being listed in the patch notes. Ok cool. So now healing factor mutation has a place again, it’s not as good as lifegiver’s glitched health regen but it’s fine and the game works as intended.
---
But healing factor is a big element of the fast travel bug, which, remarkably still isn’t fixed.  So the thing that benefits us is patched out, and probably the #1 most complained about glitch for years still remains and is now more prevalent for me because of healing factor. Come. On.
---
It can be buggy sometimes, but once you’re in a groove it can be nice to just fire and crit back and forth. Will def feel a lot different for a non-auto rifle! Also, you probably don’t need the evasive perk either. Sorry thought I took that one off.
---
Even then, the rewards are watered down presents. Less caps, same plans, and grenades instead of junk items and half the grenades are floater so you cant trade or sell
---
Were you in PA previously? I was noticing last night that my challenges were completing but I never got any of the notifications of Score moving up. Until I left my PA to do some crafting and I got 4 levels worth of Score notifications. It had already awarded the Score prior to that, but the notifications delayed until I left my PA.
---
It’s a bug...
---
They also changed the ammo converter, and now it shows all ammo types, even ones you don’t have in your inventory. I convert all my ammo except two types, and I have a raider collection who collects my ammo. This has been causing me to constantly be going in and out of my pip boy and back into the ammo converter just to check which ammo I have and how much.
---
Why doesn’t it only show ammo types you have in your inventory! I don’t need to convert my 40mm grenade rounds because I don’t FUCKING HAVE THEM.
---
Ya don’t say
---
So they apply a fix, but if this issue was so popular, why didn't they stop and think "My golly, the community sure does love having wallpaper on both sides of a wall, and both different ones aswell, my, my, we could make an interior wall! Then, they no longer need to exploit to do what they like!"  
---
Also 2 walls isn't much, never had performance issues from that. I get more issues walking into Watoga or Whitesprings than somebodies camp using this glitch. Someone please tell them to patch those places out mah performance fee fees.
---
*sighs* pathetic
---
I had the same basic thought. 
---
The thing is this. Bethesda has showcased many camps that use glitches to be awesome. Using them to brag about how creative their players are. 
---
If Bethesda is ok with it, then maybe in this case players are justified in being upset.
---
Eh. I won't be surprised if we get a hotfix or statement soon addressing some of the concerns. Remember Fasnacht? Similar levels of outrage but the event ended up being doubled in length and players got a few free items out of the deal.
---
Yeah, I’d like to see that fixed too.
---
Gauss for scorchbeasts, lever/handmade/rad rifle for cqb, hunting rifle or pipe bolt for sniping.
---
I learned that trick literally yesterday while reading this subreddit and tested it today with both water well and clean sink.
---
bondage
---
Also seems to have broken the ability to enter Carleton Mine which prevents doing "Cheating Death" main story Crater quest.
---
What you have said here, can literally be applied to every patch they do. Pretty terrible overall.
---
Have to wonder if that's what's coming.  The wall switching thing is straight up bullshit, too.  That was the only way we could apply wallpaper to windows for a while.
---
I know the technical concerns are different with a server-based game like this, but for settlements I don't know why they can't offer a locally stored, instanced interior with a larger construction budget.
---
Imagine going through a train tunnel door to an enclosed, somewhat spacious "trainyard" area where you can build something bigger, something that lets you use all those Atom Shop CAMP items they want you to spend real world money on.
---
There are definitely concerns about how players might camp, or harass others, at the entrance to this instanced interior, but you could make the location a fast travel target like Vault 76 or your CAMP, and avoid that altogether.
---
Your camp has one solitary wall? Most don't you know.
---
I agree that there is a double standard. I disagree at some points but at its core its not intended to be possible. Yes they should simply add it as a thing so people wouldn't have to exploit for it.
---
Also dont forget bethesda unbanned an unknown number of dupers.
---
That's what 1st is for though. If they made it have no weight they wouldn't get the moneys
---
It's not new (I bought it a long time back). And I think it does cause at least I don't seem to have a problem anymore with those and I'm almost always wearing mine (in fact I think I got a note one time that I was being protected cause of my mask).
---
Have you tried building a wall first, placing the piece that closes the gap to the roof and then deleting the wall?  Is that possible or will it give you an error message?  The example in your third picture.
---
It's not worth it. Youd be better off buying loads of recall cards to use slowly and get fixer plans to sell when you need more caps
---
They don’t want to encourage people to AFK. The challenge is just there as a means to track play time. Nothing more.
---
No ones excited for the ultimate recycle event. 
---
It’s only in Bethesda’s best interest to drain your scrap box right now. 
---
It shows - from afar - a lack of effort and vision that they couldn’t be bothered to even toss a clean BOS scientist outfit reskin in loot lists or a dirty BOS flag or poster. 
---
You can’t even display the damn box. What’s with that?
---
Anyways It’s not like they aren’t sitting on a mountain of BOS assets they could convert to workshop placeables. 
---
As always whether it’s accurate or not this is more fuel on the dual burning optics fires that they don’t care / play and misplaced priorities. 
---
I’m sure there’s good intentions on the teams itself but whoever’s calling the shots is nosediving this project into the ground.
---
I hope you see the difference between this and people who are very negative and angry.
---
It means clearly it's better, but the bar is so low that literally anything would have been better than where they started. It's asinine to say it's better than the start.
---
Why cant they just be like eso and just let us put everything anywhere in our little allocated spot. Like you think they would support creativity more :v
---
IT'S FUCKING STEEL.
---
YOU'RE NOT PROSTITUTING YOUR MOTHER.
---
IT'S JUST FUCKING STEEL.
---
The (heavy quotes) “edge lords” and their, “PeOpLe PlAy ThIs?!” posts. Meanwhile they play elite dangerous lol.
---
It's unfortunate because you'd think interior walls would've been one of their first additions, especially after almost 2 years.   
---
Or if they plan it, maybe release them *before* ruining existing camp construction methods.   
---
It's the same kind of decision making that let the ammo converter out the way it was.  
---
I have no doubt that there are some very good people who work on this game, and I feel for them every time the boss basically reigns them to a week of getting shit on. But something must be said for someone to take notice.
---
Despite being a serious bug with a core gameplay mechanic, it's not important enough for Bethesda because they're not losing money not fixing it.
---
Might be time for that to change.
---
That's completely fine m8. I probably will move on if this keeps happening, but if you enjoy it I'm happy to hear it.
---
It should have no weight in your stash box. You could store unlimited junk in fallout 4, but 76 has limits because of server load and game performance. We shouldn’t be penalized for that with a monthly fee.
---
My biggest issue is my 250 steel scrap got me 4 grenades and a water. I dont want the brotherhood to come if that's how they're gonna do me.
---
Have you read the comments on those posts? They thought they were autocompleted because of the new checkmarks added. 
---
They weren’t actually auto completed and still can complete the challenges. 
---
So yes. They were patched.
---
Personally I'd rather have polished content to play. Plus there's still that shitty bug where you can't spawn after dying at the end of an event. Hopefully that big will be gone when the event gets released
---
what if people didnt hoard mountains of useless crap all the time?
---
IMO its not about hoarding aLL tEh StuffS.. its about hoarding the right stuff...
---
That's the kind of stuff the devs need to be shown.   
---
Wall placement like that is not unreasonable and shouldn't have been prevented.   
---
Really seems like they "fixed" an "issue" without thinking about it at all, or taking a second to ask the actual playerbase about it.
---
This should be stickied or something. In the vast sea of toxicity and blind outrage in this sub, this is the most well thought out and sensible comment I’ve seen.
---
OP is right though. If they want to sell cosmetics, then they should do just that, and they basically don't do that. It's too often a clone object that's its own thing, and made wrong.
---
First, the alien baton that was it's own weapon, and not a skin for the baton. It didn't even use baton animations, but switchblade ones. For some reason.
---
Last week the Camo SS underarmor was it's own underarmor, rather than a skin for the actual underarmor. It didn't even use SS underarmor linings, but Casual ones. For some reason. And didn't even work.
---
Now this thing. Couldn't they just make it a skin for the Settlers water well? They decided to go out of their way and give it its own functionality, and make a shitty one at that. For some reason.
---
It would be so easy to offer good content and still remain within the purely cosmetics promise. The way they handle the Shop doesn't make any sense whatsoever.
---
You can actually log all the way to desktop, log back in and still get the same private world, so long as you do so quickly enough. Private instances persistence has nothing to do with your own client.
---
Won't be holding my breath.
---
Pack rat would still be useful for unscrapped junk.  Making people pay to store more scrap is kinda silly.  Plus who walks around with junk?
---
I would expect fixes to come with the update in a two weeks to activate the Colossal Problem event, if it isn't updated this week with a hotfix. Waiting for Patch 22 is a bit too long for a main quest breaking bug.
---
Stupid thing to care about imho
---
This made me cackle
---
God bless.
---
Although admittedly that didn’t work out too well for us, so we may want to think this through more this time
---
I just realized something: when was C.A.M.P. interiors coming? I think they did this to push people into using that feature. Think about it;
---
Will C.A.M.P. interiors lower the server load or make their job easier in some other way once they add it? I think it might. If so, would people who like to have open world houses want to use C.A.M.P interiors? I myself wouldn't because I like it when a player teleports to my camp, checks out my house and gives me a thumbs up but a lot less people would do that if a loading screen was involved. C.A.M.P. interiors feature will probably involve just that. So people will be less inclined to use it because they like to show off but if you remove double-sided walls and make it so that every wall in a C.A.M.P. interior a wall you can put wallpaper on both sides of, people will have no choice but to use it. I think this could be the logic behind removing double walling.
---
Between OP and myself, we've donated 55,000 steel scrap.  
---
You're welcome, BoS.
---
It’s really disheartening to see people encouraging others to not do the atlas event also. It’s supposed to be a community building event. 
---
I think the event is poorly designed personally and it was more exciting killing scorched last year but would never try to actively sabotage it. It’s really sad.
---
That’s the BoS for you.
---
Bethesda bout to get sued for false advertisement.
---
Glad I'm not the only one who thinks so. For one I liked how before it knew already if I had the ammo. Which meant I could just spam sell until it stopped offering it to sell.  Now I gotta remember how much of each ammo I'm selling I have or deal with going through more menus when it denies me cause I don't have enough.
---
It also defaults really to buying when I am mostly selling (because you get a lot less back then you put in you are going to sell more than buy). Buying should be the options below sell, not above as the most likely thing you are going in to do is sell.
---
I'd be fine with it still having weight in inventory, but we don't want to add extra layers of complexity.
---
I see your point, but the basic principle is the same. Except now, the rules only don't apply when they can make Bethesda money via some free advertising.
---
Of course, it's much easier to justify this case than others, and this post is more food for thought than anything else.
---
Also remember its quakecon this weekend and they're doing some things with the community so another way for the community to get heard.
---
As much as I would like for this boycott to work, I know it won't.
---
I'm pretty sure the donations count across all systems, even if they didn't 125,000 steel isn't alot for the majority of the playerbase. 
---
Not every Fallout 76 player uses reddit. I know because I play with 5 other people and none of them besides one frequent Reddit. I even know people to have already donated 3000 to 6000 steel because it's very easy to actually farm. 
---
I'll participate in it, but I'm not getting my hopes up that it'll do much.
---
I think theyre just hoping if they continue to break stuff and add useless shit people will forget lol.
---
I hate how the trajectory of this game isnt matching ESO at all. Its taking 2 long for the proper fixs and stuff to happen while over there every patch was something positive and new fixed all the way and kept going till the game wasnt hated anymore. At least we know they play the damn game cause they stream the new content a lot of the times including small stuff.
---
Me too.
---
&gt;it's proving to be a bit more complicated to address without causing more issues.
---
When has that ever stopped you before?
---
Brotherhood of Steel?
---
You mean the Brotherhood of Cork, after we’re done with them.
---
U glitched the game and now want comp?
---
What’s wrong with Elite Dangerous? That and No Man’s Sky are my other go to games!
---
Investors board members
---
It amazes me that wallpaper ruins the game for so many people.
---
Just about have it ready. Hang tight...
---
We are not ready for this conversation
---
W... wo.... Wolverines?
---
VATS has been broken for way longer than 113 days.
---
Well according to this
---
We are over half way to the goal already.
---
Read the entire post then we can have a discussion, because I’m not complaining about the steel, I’m complaining about Bethesda’s handling of the entire patch and their attitude towards the player base
---
5k steel gets you much the same. 
---
Not sure I’ll drop more.
---
oh i'm happily wrong, 
---
It's just took them 1,5years. great.
---
Completely agree. Just recently came back and spent 330 hours plus levelling to 140 and subscribing to fo1st to have this shabby event be plonked in my face and building capabilities neutered. This could be the final push for a lot of players. Not donating anything to bos. The amount of shit this game has put out through my constant defending of it is unbelievable. The atom store is completely overpriced and long term supporters of the game through sub have been completely rear ended by and I don't say this lightly a money grabbing EA wannabe.
---
Truly these are true words
---
Firstly, you must know that there is always an element of risk here, but it is not particularly significant unless you accidentally log back into an adventure server and not your private world.
---
Secondly, you have to find an empty container that says 0/0 storage capacity. These are the ones with no storage limit. Ive transferred close to 600 lbs in one go before, over probably a hundred different stacks of various items. For scrip related stuff, the ice machine outside the Rusty Pick works well. Inside, the pie machine dispensing box works too.
---
Them having to delay content nonstop for the past year is super unprofessional. Not with the amount of money dumped into this game from the store and subs not for a fucking instanced cave with 1 boss.
---
&gt; Not going to bother reading beyond that. You’re a terrible troll. 
---
Or because it is an argument you can't really address without admitting that value of anything is subjective.  I see people walking around with designer and brand name clothing and think they are wasting their money on their over priced bullshit.  
---
Yet just because I view it as over priced doesn't mean that they also view it as over priced. Indeed by the very nature of buying it it shows that it has enough value to them to be worth the cost. Were as to me it doesn't have enough valid to warrant the cost.
---
Equally I've seen countless people complaining that no video game should ever cost more then 20 dollars. Because to them all video games are only worth 20 dollars and anything else is massively overly expensive and not worth the value.
---
I suspect that this is an attempt to 'legitimize' the game in a way by removing all of the excess materials that have 'appeared' over the game's tenure.
---
Your focus is clearly different than his though, and it’s still missing perks that a complete vats or stealth build would use. Which is why i suggested he decide on one and do it himself than just copy pasting someone else’s.
---
I only donated like 6,500, but yeah, some decent weapon plans I'll put in my vendor, one plan I didn't know (some prime receiver I'll never use) and nothing else of consequence. I was hoping for some dense mod plans or maybe heavy metal armor plans. I may or may not donate other scrap, but it's going to be in much lower quantities.
---
And Jet! They have a secret dealer.
---
I knew it! 
---
(killed by synths, replaced)
---
Are you a synth?
---
I get that, I totally do. Yet any sane developer would not come to the client on the release date and tell the customer "sorry, the big update you were waiting for is not ready. Instead we give you this feature where you can get worthless things, oh and by the way you can no longer use this feature because we think it was an exploit an it may cause lag for other customers".
---
Would anyone really be surprised if this customer then gets his shotgun?
---
The real problem is that Beth does not communicate nor does it really listen to what their customers say. It's like a petulant child learning to code and sneaking sniplets behind QS into the game.
---
I’ve been a big believer in this theory since right after launch. It’s unheard of that so many things are broken with each and every update. That doesn’t happen with other games to this degree. The overseer is toying with us, for sure!
---
Yeah it's better if you have a lot of ammo to convert. For those of us who convert it as we get it it sucks balls (for the reasons people already outlined). And no, I don't want to wait until I have more to convert... I don't want to waste my box space with that. Why shouldn't I be able to easily convert small amounts at a time easily?
---
Maybe those of you who have a lot of ammo to convert will realize it sux once you've converted your stash and then rely on trying to convert as you get it.
---
It doesn't even have to be a it's good for one or the other. There are several ways they could have made it good for both. Hell, they could have made it at least the same as the old one for us with little ammo to convert and improved if we get a lot by two simple things. 1. Not list amounts we cannot trade (the old ammo converter did that so I don't buy that can't be done). 2. Put the sell options first above the buy options. And I guarantee that would also improve it for people who like to convert a lot of ammo.
---
This isn't the first time a patch did more damage than helping. Think of all the previous patches and how each one they release they lose players. I myself haven't played the game in over a year now. Wild to still see the same style posts that were common back then.
---
Alcohol and grenades. And 25 caps. 0/10
---
what so now informing people that the rewards are dogshit, and you are better off just keeping the junk is trying to make the event fail? yeah no. there are a few circlejerk boycott posts, but you just want the write and essay and pretend you have some sort of moral superiority on the internet.
---
That's exactly what I did. I was all excited to get the gun, called my wife over to show it off, fired it at a nearby wall and broke my damn leg. I was pissed.
---
Bethesda fixed the clipping issues that were plaguing the backpacks.
---
Atleast my Red Shift backpack is working properly now.
---
steel is pretty common yo.. its not like theyre asking for ballistic fiber...
---
Cyberpunk 2077 has been delayed 2 times and will not have next gen enhancements on release of the consoles. And yet the internet loves CDPR. So your words are a bit..hypocritical.
---
I know, it was a ridiculous time. The point of that was more that it was an oversweeping nerf that was a bit too harsh on those effects, and it also made shotguns and heavy explosives nearly useless. Before the bug that makes them deal insane damage in vats, barely anybody used shotguns. Heavy launchers still don't have too much use besides meme value, you can realistically achieve the same damage with a shot or two from a handmade/fixer under any condition
---
Well it’s fixed. That’s a good thing.
---
logged in 5 minutes ago. atlas observatory is nuked in the server I’m at. 
---
this says a lot.
---
But does it have a scrap box. I assume that's what OP meant.
---
IM TIRED OF READING THIS SAME POST OVER AND OVER AGAIN IT STOPS BEING FUNNY AFTER 50 TIMES.
---
I noticed this too. And for a post update, the PS4 servers seemed unusually laggy last night.
---
&gt; it's proving to be a bit more complicated to address without causing more issues.
---
Yet, this latest patch was released. Main quest broken, half the things in the patch notes aren't in the game, more broken weapons. But it still released? So why is that a concern now all of a sudden?
---
Bethesda: sorry, the glass is broken, instead you must donate stable flux, in return you get wine and grenades
---
Just started doing this on PS4 too. Was totally fine before the update.
---
Ive seen people talk shit about it so no . Especially cause features are being removed, but right there your comparing a entire game being delayed and a small update with 10 minutes of content
---
It bothers me that day 1 we are at 75 million of 125 million steel turned in
---
That guy for sure cheated.  There is a guy over 10k on ps4 as well. 
---
I'm at 2180 or so right now and I've never done the god mode glitch.  I was documented on Reddit months ago in the 1200s. With what is possible and how long the game has been out I'd say max believable level is 3500 to 4000 maybe. 
---
The 1023 is a bug, and how I found this post to begin with.  I crossed 1023 last November, and no matter what level you are it shows as 1023 on the map.  It's likely the same toon. Visual bug.
---
Me too. Just keep it in perspective that most of these things *will* be fixed. We *will* get deep pocketed mods on the SS armor. We *will* see A Colossus Problem come out eventually. I can pretty much guarantee the ammo producer will see another UI update. People will forget about their frustrations with the provisions when they play the second week of Meat Week (which I'm certain will come whether the community actually meets the numbers or not). 
---
The only thing I'm wary of is double-sided walls, tbh, but I won't be surprised if we see *something* that'll at least imitate that ability when the instanced interiors update comes.
---
Was disappointed.  The "silver lining" is that this is a bug that will get fixed.  Quite possibly the only one though...
---
Don’t forget a colossull problem delayed, AGAIN.
---
Avengers... assemble! But yeah, f**k the BOS. They just take take take and help out only themselves.
---
The enemies I’m aware of. I actually avoid putting Turrents in my camp because all turrents do is attract their attention. Get destroyed because they can’t take on a level 1 scorched. And then the enemies proceed to destroy the camp.
---
Not long after launch they introduced the feature that would remove small world objects when placing a camp object in the same location, this worked with trees, bushes, rocks, cars, and grass. But somewhere along the way they broke it and grass as well as some other small objects, started popping though the foundations of both new and old structures. Personally aggravates me because I have been a fan of building since launch and some of my older builds that I love so, are now littered with objects poking through the floor.
---
I donated about 10k, and after the “rewards” I got from doing that....the Brotherhood can find somebody else to supply their power armor materials.
---
Nice write up!! Agree with all you wrote.
---
&gt; **Bethesda, this patch is embarrassing** 
---
Aren't they all though?
---
It is definitely for the best.
---
However there are several, and I mean a mountain of issues yet to be addressed. Every patch and every bit of content they release seems to cause more problems. When they do decide to fix some things it's usually lesser (probably easier) things to fix. There are a couple of bugs that have been in the game since release. 
---
I think the biggest issue is they consistently release things that seem like they simply have never played fallout 76. They release crap no one wants or asked for. 
---
You can only polish a piece of shit so much. I guess but people are still going to notice its a piece of shit.
---
You think a VERY small minority of the players who are here will do anything to make them change their mind?
---
It better be free 😑
---
LOL great reply, I think you replied on my post once in a similar fashion but that time you yelled at the sun.
---
Watch them add those and break something else as they always do...
---
I think they really only unbanned people not out of principle but because of lost revenue/the number of tickets to go through was not possible given the size of their team. Then again, it's possible some folks were just first offenders and were treated with leniency (which I actually applaud Bethesda for if that's the case).  
---
But again, this is about someone else deciding how we play, without quite knowing why we're here in the first place.
---
First thing one of my friends who has long since quit tried to do was get wood by using an axe on a tree. 
---
I just gazed with a tear as the sweet summer child learned the hard way
---
ESO team even with the few flubs cause thats just development is just 100 miles ahead on problems still even back then every patch was just something good, improvements here and there constantly. Im loosing faith this game will ever make it out
---
Hasn’t been years from launch, and the games improved quite a bit since relaunch. But it’s still not in a good state
---
Spaghetti code™ in action.
---
Same. Cancelled this am too.
---
It is now and there is 0 chance 75 million was donated.
---
That's why no one has heard of the Appalachia branch 200 years later, BOC was a poor choice. LOL
---
Knowing how upset the community is, it would be good for them to talk about this in more detail with them. I’m sure you’re right that this is the patch note responsible, but the community is fomenting, so take some time to explain why they felt this trade off was more important. Granted people will still be upset, but it still helps.
---
&gt;OP is right though. If they want to sell cosmetics, then they should do just that, and they basically don't do that. It's too often a clone object that's its own thing, and made wrong.
---
Looking though the atomic shop menu 90% of the store is cosmetics.
---
&gt; Now this thing. Couldn't they just make it a skin for the Settlers water  well? They decided to go out of their way and give it its own  functionality, and make a shitty one at that. For some reason. 
---
Perfect for impatient people who just want to throw money at things and get the same result as if they didn't.  And honestly how I support Bethesda monetizing the game. Let the idiots who are to lazy to actually play the game throw money at them to get a sort of half assed thing they could have done without paying money.  
---
I really have no problem with Beth making money off stupid lazy people. 
---
&gt; It would be so easy to offer good content and still remain within the  purely cosmetics promise. The way they handle the Shop doesn't make any  sense whatsoever. 
---
And your source on this is? Do you have access to sale records of the game?
---
Oh man that's insane
---
Yeah, I figure it will be completed no matter what, and seeing this 75 million this morning kinda confirmed it for me.
---
Nvm I thought you were mocking it
---
Oh yeah they will, no one says they won't but I will be happy if they will compensate for the wallpaper thing because my camp looks like shit right now...
---
just downvote that troll, its new acc anyway
---
Sharring stuff with the BoS for a better future is a very Communist way of thinking. They should get their own shit and grind for 4 months just to get enough faction rep with us to where we don't nuke their sorry asses every time we see them.
---
you spelled 2 wrong.. there is no 5 or 0 in it...
---
It's not even like they broke anything major, they just don't like the changes that were made.
---
I dropped about 1.5 mil....don't trip ill carry us all the way.
---
I am OP lol. Sorry if confusing, I was trying to point out that they did this b.s. on purpose as another "fix" that messes up those exact basic building uses :)
---
A lot of people play this game. Don’t let this sub fool you.
---
To be honest, I'm in the camp where I think Bethesda will artificially inflate their numbers if necessary (at least for the big ticket items like a second Meat Week), but I do think it's shitty when you see people who brag about how they'll enjoy the awards by coasting off the backs of everyone else because they don't want to part with their digital junk.
---
wait, you don't like floater grenades and wine?
---
5k steel and all I got was a bunch of booze and garbage I don't need. Destroyed any desire to participate in this joke of an event.
---
Same, man. People just wanna complain about anything they can, especially now adays.
---
dont wory, they have a top guy on it. trust him, he is a business man
---
Yup. Can't enter either. Tried re-logging and changing from public to private server. No luck.
---
My post was only addressing the limit on caps from vendors.  Even in FO4 there were limits on how many caps the vendors had.  Sure you could do tricks like quick save, kill them, and reload so their caps were refreshed, but that's pulling an exploit to get more caps.  
---
But there was really no purpose in getting more caps after a while (and the same can be said about FO3 and FONV). At least FO4 had unique weapons you could buy from vendors that were pricy.  Best Fallout 76 has is Smiely who sells gold bullion.  
---
In this way, the Atlas event, had they put worthwhile items as reward, would have been good as a permanent sink for caps (as well as help  a bit with the stash issue).  People might have bought scrap from players to turn in for reward, and may even have bought bulk scrap from vendors. 
---
Of course, since the rewards are trash, no one wants too.  
---
The issue of the stash limit is something else that I wasn't even addressing.  I do think people keep too much, but that's a different story.
---
If they sell it - they are gonna cross another line with people - calling it now. 
---
It’s not that hard to add a new plan in. 
---
They could fix this controversy easy by being making a (tiny) power move like that.
---
Exploit is an exploit is like saying a crime is a crime. It is more nuanced. 
---
Duping devalues others achievements, whether it’s grinding at gathering resource or levelling and grinding to obtain a powerful weapon. People duping weapons to keep people playing is a poor excuse, people duping to obtain unlimited ammo is just not the game, as it stands. You are artificially accelerating your or others progression in the game. This demeans honest progression.
---
Someone utilising exploits to “improve” their camp has little impact on other players. It is subjective to say it’s immersion breaking, &amp; even if it is, it’s limited to that camp on that site. Duping permeates across the player base.
---
I agree with you that’s it’s for Bethesda to fix, but to say an exploit is an exploit &amp; accuse others of hypocrisy is just wrong. We don’t treat shoplifting &amp; murder as the same crime.
---
I donated 1,500 for lower end Christmas present rewards. Needless to say, I’m not in a hurry to donate again.
---
Bye!
---
Either that or the things that don’t get unlocked will just be put up in the atom shop, probably for Broken Steel.
---
I'm filing for a law suit against it right now! /s
---
Laughs in fo1st while holding every workstation on the map.
---
We auto completing boys.
---
People have reached new depths of pathetic whining about steel.
---
I'm sorry, but if you haven't figured out how to get steel efficiently enough that it's completely worthless to you, then I'm amazed you're able to even figure out how to turn on your computer.
---
or just mirelurk kings in general being way more OP than any other creature in the game? I'd rather solo SBQ than take on a pack of those fuckers
---
7d2d is a fantastic game!!!  + neebs gaming has a series on it
---
Yeah but hey, next time we have to consume 5 alcoholic beverages for S.C.O.R.E, we will all be set.
---
I didn't know this was a common statement. I joined this sub a month ago.
---
And yet all of gaming reddit had nothing but praise when both announcements were made.
---
Anyone who has ever developed a game even a small indie one knows even small content can still take a long time to balance and bug fix.  Forcing the dev team to scatter to their own homes and rely on the internet to upload and download files and shit will slow anything down.
---
everything can be found or bought from a vendor. what is the point of even donating besides giving away your hard earned junk and adding more pointless weight to your character
---
Ahh I see. Thought you couldn't change it to any different wall type
---
Some people have said it has, some said it hasn’t. For me it wasn’t but now it is, maybe it’s different depending on platform? Or what Xbox you have?
---
sometimes, one cannot simply yell enough
---
that's another figure I'm interested in, but can't really get an accurate number on.
---
Selling it will be a big mistake. Jet fuel to an already bad optics problem. 
---
Calling the controversy now.
---
You have to start somewhere. 
---
The people who were fed up with the player vendor/display case issue enough to end their Fallout 1st subscription might have thought the same too. However, we all saw how quickly Bethesda responded to that issue once several people. The month or so before people stopped their subscription - no response. Once people started to stop their subscriptions - very responsive all of a sudden.
---
It's no different here.
---
It may not amount to much in the end. However, one thing I do know is that someone is going to have to write a report on the results of the event and it's harder to ignore missed community goals than it is general displeasure on Reddit that amounts to little more than noise. Cause, if Reddit posts and comments did matter, Bethesda would have been considerably more responsive a lot sooner over many other past issues.
---
While I agree with the sentiment and the rest of the post, it doesn't seem like most builders are actually that mad. r/fallout76settlements has far less front page complaining about it than this place does. It seems like an even split between people sharing the new method(s) of making interior walls and people going about their business sharing creations as normal. This seems to largely be an issue of people getting outraged on behalf of a group they don't belong to, which is sadly all too common nowadays
---
Because people in this sub represent tiny fraction of fallout 76 players. If people on this sub are outraged it doesn't mean every Joe and Mary across the globe is.
---
According to what, exactly? Was there an official statement from the developers saying that? I’m not saying it doesn’t make sense, I’m just seeing a whole lot of people tell me what we all use it for. It’s a challenge, i can only assume challenges are meant to be completed.
---
Just a heads up! Think you pasted the link in your text box instead of creating a link to the page, so it’ll just show up as regular text.
---
I tried all of your mods and none of them made this work for me, unfortunately. Maybe one of yours is outdated and is from before wallpapers were added? That would explain your inability to place wallpapers and is probably related to this.
---
I totally agree this is a mobile cash grab game pretending to be a normal game low in content high in urgency to buy things
---
This was not the game I brought it has changed so much and mostly in a bad way
---
I hate losing I hate losing 14 hours per week of gameplay I'm expected to do or I will loose out what happened to the games of progress at your own speed to accomodate people who have a real life outside of gaming
---
This is now a trash money grab and they dont even try to hide it
---
Because the people who post to online message boards are by far and away the vocal minority of the player-base.
---
Edit: Also still says 0 for me.
---
That’s where I am now. Literally can’t play game. Great. That’s like the one thing left I could do with this camp nonsense.
---
Steel is by far one of the easier resources. Additionally those of us with fo1st dropped tens of thousands of steel scrap to test the waters of the loot table. I won’t be doing any more donations and I doubt the loot table will draw the attention of duper’s who have millions of scrap.
---
They fuck up too, but most of the time they communicate the fuck ups and explain their decisions. There's always dev commentary explaining things. Here, the only explanation given is fuck ya'll, give us more subscription money.
---
stop trying to start circlejerk, the event is shit, people not wanting dump useful junk for garbage is selfish? dude you are the entitled one here.
---
No kidding.   I took some steel up there to see what it was like and left the stupid grenade and booze on the ground right there.
---
nothing is going to remain locked in an event/challenge like this.. ever
---
leaving a reward locked would be shooting themselves in the foot.. which they do enough of as it is already...
---
if for some reason they chose not to cook the books to show the challenge met.. they would still give out all of the rewards anyway...
---
See? This is what I’m talking about. It’s not even the fact that it happened, it was either a mistake or testing out a new feature. Mistakes happen, but what isn’t acceptable is when they make a mistake, get huge backlash, and then refuse to fix it for months. If it’s as simple as you say it is, it could’ve literally been fixed with a hot fix or maybe an extremely minor update within days
---
Assuming patch 21 didn't shut it off, the holiday NW rewards are available again as people doing the NW Legendary Run challenges were getting them.
---
Hot damn, looks like I’ll be headed back with 1,500 more.....
---
I use both, Gauss for range and combat for up close and personal.  I tend to use my combat more.  I like the Gauss for AWOL and Queen runs.  The vats issue can be mitigated by going into vats first and then charging up the weapon.  Doesn't always work but it works most of the time.  Also all the magic effects apply to the Gauss shotguns.
---
You are wrong. It's not the same thing.
---
Duping is an exploit which gives you major advantage and it ruins game economy.
---
Double walls is a trick or a glitch which gives you an ability to decorate your camp better without any other advantages.
---
I can build two buildings in my camp with one set of walls or I can build one building with double walls. It will be almost the same camp budget. How is this affecting anybody?
---
I'm definitely with you there, the wendigo cave took me about a half an hour to kill 3, when the cave boss took me around 1 minute. Don't think they should be able to do their ranged attack and lunge at the same time mainly, that's what wall clips me
---
Something like [this](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+view+hours+played+on+xbox), maybe?
---
The issue was resolved last night.  By 10:45pm Central my Bethesda games were showing up again.  So I'm not sure if that is what fixed your issue.
---
Can’t wait to not see bethesda respond to this post and carry on acting like everything is great!
---
Because people keep paying. Until the atom and Fallout 1st money starts to dry up, they aren’t going to make a real investment in this.
---
Weight is an arbitrary value that has no actual relevance in programmatic terms. Whether a gun weighs 1lb or 1,000,000lbs is irrelevant as far as digital storage goes.
---
Similarly whether you have 1 banana or 2,147,483,647 bananas (assuming it's stored as an INT) is also irrelevant - still takes up the same amount of digital storage space.
---
What really matters, programmatically, is the number of unique items that you have.
---
The notion that someone with 100,000 steel scrap in their stash box is putting load on the server is complete BS - UNLESS the engine treats each one as a unique item.
---
Well if by lifespawn you mean doing thensame dailies over and over again, so yes, I agréé with you.
---
 But thats exzctly why its not a real MMO for me. Quitte the opposite in fact, as it lacks the content that trully differs, like raiding or dungeons 
---
And thats why People are getting bored by this game.
---
Can we fix the ammunition foundry exploit as well... its been going on for more than 2 weeks...
---
I hit 100 last night and it's extremely relaxing to not care anymore about this grind.
---
Of course, you'll still get the Score popups everytime you hit 10K or hit a daily/weekly because they couldn't even be arsed to supress that but it's still nice to play as if this event never existed in the first place.
---
I'll continue to do some legendary farming, get my gold and some scrip but once Meat Week is over I'm taking a break.
---
It’s common sense. The fact it is such a nominal amount shows they aren’t trying to encourage people to rubber band their controllers and take up server space. 
---
Increasing the atoms would be encouraging people to AFK.
---
They’ve fucked it into the ground. I’m a look on the bright side person with games,  but don’t piss down my neck and tell me it’s rain, Beth.
---
The last community event. IIRC, that was for killing Scorched and Scorchbeasts.
---
So many of you love using the term circlejerk. 
---
It really makes me question what’s really going on with  you.
---
A vast majority of people have crackerbox shacks and don’t use this. I’m calling bullshit for the reasoning.
---
That's actually something I will believe
---
My group of friends all quit when it became impossible for us to join each other on private servers due to the friends list issues on xbox live. Ended up more frustrating than it was worth.
---
My main is at lvl 378. Everytime i do guided meditation, radiation rumble, project paradies or the bugged event at fort defiance i level up. My biggest struggle is to have enough ammonition.
---
Im not chaseing goldbullion anymore because im sitting on 5000 max and have no idea what to do with it. Got my full set of buttrested unyielding ss armor with a jetpak. The new wastelander weapons are not worth the efford.
---
Long story short: Use the right perkcards, food buffs, chems and mutations and F76 is the easiest game in the world and much less time consuming.
---
There are much less convoluted ways to track hours in a game. Like, they could just list the amount of play-time you have on each character, like any other game does. Like any other *Bethesda* game does, too.
---
Xbox one x of you look at my past post I have been complaining about it.
---
It’s been so long but I very vaguely remember that they didn’t protect at first, but then they added that feature in (though it might not say so in the description). Unless they’ve changed that, but I never get airborne hazards in them either. I think there was a mild fuss at the time about pay-to-win since they didn’t have the perception debuff that gas masks do, but the veil of mysteries doesn’t either... but that feels like 500 years ago in FO76 time, so I could be misremembering.
---
I feel bad for Joe and Mary... do they even know how horrible Patch 21 was?
---
Seriously, so many articles on game sites got made screaming Bethesda was a monster for making the icebox it was ridiculous.
---
The disconnect is always going to be a problem though. It's a senior management issue. Unless they go, nothing is going to change there at all.
---
It's not the devs that don't get it. They get it. Probably even the lead devs. It's the senior management and execs that don't.
---
It's clear as day that they don't play their own game or give a shit about the average player experience. Unless it directly impacts revenue, it's not an issue for them.
---
People who don’t still come here? Wow.
---
Lol! Once again bringing up a completely different reason. Informing. Again not even a subject I brought up.
---
You are really selfish.
---
Nope. They dont.
---
I smell bullshit
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i3xrx5/new_and_old_still_remaining_issues_with_the/
---
Still not fixed, and also a few new issues popped up as well.
---
Best Fallout right now is Wasteland Warfare.
---
You'll find that 'an exploit is an exploit', is the term that most folks were using when the duping wave occurred, hence the terminology being reused here.  
---
You do raise a good point- there's a little more potential for harm in duping, but can you not also exclude yourself from partaking as well? In a sense, you do not have to trade items with players, just as you do not have to go to other people's camps.  
---
I'd argue that 'honest progression' is simply not possible to the point many people wish to be at, and if there were a reasonable path provided beyond just luck, less folks would be enticed to dupe.  
---
I agree with you, we shouldn't treat shoplifting and murder as the same crime. That's why when some players duped \~5 items, I don't think we, as a community, should have told them to screw off. 100+? To sell online? Yes. But there should be more understanding in *why* these offenses take place, if we're to better solve the root of the problem.
---
Truthfully this is the community you DIDN’T want to fuck with, say goodbye to your atom shop profits morons
---
The achievement was created LONG before it was on Steam. So that’s not a valid point to bring up when talking about intent.
---
Double walls wasn’t related to the stacking “fix”. The logic (or lack there of) in nerfing regularly used wall glitches has yet to be expressed.
---
From what I understand, there is a partial solution - using the brick wall and fire trap trick you can still get double sided walls. Someone posted something about this in another thread. Hopefully that will help at least for the moment.
---
I think the math adds up. There’s about 9k players on steam at one given time, we could assume that number is 1/3-1/2 of the actual player base and PC is less than half the f76 players. So we’re looking at somewhere between 40-60k players.
---
Even if it was just 40k active players we’d each need to donate 35k steel. At halfway that means the average is around 17.5k steel. 
---
Between the steel dupers and FO1st with 100k+ collected over the year, there’s probably more than enough to make up for the players who are on strike. Plus a lot of those players didn’t give up on the event until after donating their rss. 
---
and these number would just be based on the minimum. It’s possible we have way more players donating than we can gather from steam analytics.
---
I didn't mind the provisions that much, I only gave at least 1k worth but I didn't get anything special but I don't care for the rare plans.
---
The Raider quest line is totally broken now.
---
Most armor does.
---
You are being hostile for no reason, and aren't even making much sense.
---
Most of the items in the shop are their own items, and not paints or cosmetics appied to existing in-game objects. The Fasnacht masks are their own mask, not a paint for the actual mask, to give another example, as are most of the outfits and dresses, even when they are a recolor of something else, like the camo SS underarmor. Until not long ago, backpacks used to follow this same logic as well. The only things that actually work as paints are weapons and PA paints and skins, and not even always (See Invasion from the Stars baton).
---
I don't understand what you thought I was saying when I said that it should have been a reskin for the settlers water well, but of course what I meant is that to build it one should have the water well plan learned, so no bullion grind skipped. It should have been the logical conclusion after the other two examples, but okay.
---
Lastly, I never implied that the way they handle the Shop leads to bad sales. I've never spoken about sales at all. Just that it doesn't make sense.
---
You know with a lot of these fixes no one asked for, I wouldn't be at all surprised if there was a bug fix quota that the devs need to meet and it's less about the quality or priorities of the bugs fixed vs the actual number of bugs fixed.
---
It'd explain why there are so many bug fixed no one asked for, trivial fixes made over more pressing ones, why features are stated as being fixed when they're not, and so on.
---
Ok? It’s a design choice.
---
Thanks, I think I fixed it now
---
You can see the scav healthbars in the event information in the upper right....
---
I’m starting to understand why people fail events.
---
I do the same.
---
I read so many posts that complain about people selling plans, because "no one buys them so just drop them."
---
Being realistic, I would say I make about 2k caps a week just selling plans like "small letters" and "metal tables."  Add in Fasnacht plans, and I'll sell an additional 3k.
---
If they wanna pull this crap it needs to included double sided interior walls.
---
I was unaware this was a community issue..
---
Wait, I’m a new player (lvl 27, not from gamepass, just unfortunate timing) and I just thought that sometimes I suck at vats or don’t understand how it works. What’s wrong with it? This whole time I’ve been thinking I’m the problem.
---
They fix the things that don't need fixing, add things to break the game more, and give us useless rewards for community wide events. Booze and grenades? Really?!
---
One of my 4 CAMPS mind you uses a few techniques that current with building restrictions can't be done anymore.  Did my stacked stairs cause your game to crash, NO!  My build budget is the same as yours.  I never have used an "exploit" to mess with the build budget.  I don't consider one of the most requested features builders like myself have been asking for, and willing to spend money to obtain, unreasonable.  Someone figured out how to create double sided walls because the devs refused to create them.  Why, I don't know, no one has ever provided a reason for no double sided walls.  That is part of the problem from day one for the entire game.  Lack of communication from the devs/publisher to the players.  Will double sided walls and half-walls cause server instability?  I don't know, if they do then please tell me.... Someone from the dev team, someone from the publisher... but not one person has told us builders anything other than some vague comment mentioned in patch notes, related to the current method. Sorry, I spend quite a few hours building, making my job harder is not doing me any favors and not making anyone's game better either!
---
Holy shit the first reasonable take I've ever seen on here.
---
I'll search for it, thx a lot.
---
I’m on just the normal Xbox one so it might have something to do with it
---
It's just poison damage in general.  Bloodbugs aren't exactly dangerous but they are definitely more powerful than they should be too, and it's all because poison damage is stupidly powerful for no goddamn good reason.  Especially since half the time I'M IN FULLY ENCLOSED POWER ARMOUR it makes absolutely no fucking sense but then what in this glorious shitpile of a game makes even a lick of sense?
---
Just don't change the arcing from non-explosive versions.  I love that you can bounce arcs for a kill!
---
This is a bad take. Everything about this game is about micromanaging your stash and defining everything’s inherent value. Why would I give Bethesda my steel for stuff that I won’t use and doesn’t barely vendor for anything? My stash doesn’t have room for a ton of alcohol, so I don’t even know what I would do with the rewards aside from just drop it on the ground....
---
Lmao yeah this happens every update. Boycott the game, cancel your fallout 1st sub, ask for refunds on every purchase you ever made (that's fraud in most countries btw), send death threats to devs. Literally nothing ever comes of it, it lasts a few days or maybe a few weeks. If people actually cancelled their subs and kept them cancelled, bethesda wouldn't keep getting away with this, but they do, so clearly people aren't actually following through with anything they say they'll do. It's also just annoying after a while seeing people complain about small things like this. It's like they either weren't around for the REAL issues with the game, or they forgot what it was like to play back then
---
thats a bloodied stealth build
---
Same issue, Xbox also
---
Its not so much the wallpaper itself. Its Bethesda just removed a glitch. That hurt no one and did nothing other then give people more design freedom. It basically alienated the building community. That spend hours upon hours. Painstakingly building beautiful design. 
---
Meanwhile we have busted weapons, some perk cards are probably still messed up. Plenty of glitches that have been in game since beta. 
---
Their was a post on here the other day. Where someone broke down weapon by weapon what needed to be fixed. That should be Bethesdas focus but instead they fixed a harmless glitch.
---
Take our money
---
I disagree.   
---
Duping does not necessarily give you a major advantage. It depends on the extent to which it is done. If a person dupes items for themselves, or for their friends, and does not put that item into the economy, there is no harm.
---
To be frank, this is not a game where you compete against others. How do you have the opportunity to have an advantage if you treat this as a single player game? It's not like there's any actual PvP.
---
The same can be said for camp building. In the extremes, camp exploits can be so bad that it can cause performance issues for others.
---
&gt; Why turn in your hard earned mats anyways? screw the BOS. They wouldn't do it for us.
---
I did it for the rewards.  I haven't been playing as long as you guys;  for me, the caps were worth it.  And it was nice to fill out a lot of recipes I didn't already have.  It seems like it only dropped them if you didn't have them learned.  
---
I ended up with about 15k in cap rewards for turning in ~60s steel.  Learned a ton of recipes I didn't (that I'll never use, but I still like getting it).  Probably another 4-5k in caps to vendor the stimpacks/radaways and so on.  
---
Only took a month to get that steel, so I'm sure I'll have another 60k before I need it again.
---
Besides steel?  I doubt I'll turn any in.
---
No on both being the same. These are super far from the same thing. One is people who are cheating to obtain in game items without the required work, and profiting from selling or trading said items, thus damaging the markets in the process. The other is simply people being innovative with Camp designs. 
---
I do agree fully that Bethesda’s ignoring who is playing their game. Or, they have decided to monetize the wall glitch by selling exterior wall paint in a future atom shop update.
---
That's so dumb like yeah fix that but don't bother fixing more important things that actually affect game play like the fast travel bug. The freaking double wall let us have some creativity and made our camps look nicer instead of constantly asking for interior wallpaper for the exterior sides. That's so dumb an pointless on Bethesda's part.
---
Thank you I have been doing a lot of work
---
I guess the fact that in all this time (indeed more than 113 days btw) absolutely nothing could be done about a "top priority" issue kinda explains a lot......
---
I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if dupers contributed a fair number towards this.
---
There's was at least 10,000~ active players on Steam today and Xbox Live puts Fallout 76 as the #26 in the most played Xbox games at the moment so I would say this sub doesn't even account for 10% of the current active player base for this game.
---
I started playing just 2 months ago and I just canceled my subscription too. 
---
I enjoy the game but they aren't addressing the major issues the game has right now so they won't be getting any additional money from me until they do. 
---
Bug fixes, graphical errors and lighting problems in soooo many interiors. It's bad even just compared to older Fallout games let alone any other AAA game. 
---
I just hope they continue to improve the game prior to releasing any sort of paid content.
---
Holy hell are people angry, all I want to do is beat up raiders in x01 while x gon give It to ya plays in the background
---
I felt that hard when you said how much you spent and what you got. I spent 1k steel and got shit. Absolutely no reason to keep donating.
---
I like you!
---
That was insane. People were more angry about not getting to play fasnacht than they were about NPCs stealing their bloodied explosive fixers
---
It’s as bad if not worse in terms of game breaking bugs. I played off and on for about 3 years, then around Halloween last year they absolutely made it unplayable. For each issue they address, they create 25 more. As a community we defended it by saying certain bugs were intentional intricacies. 
---
I’ve admittedly not played NMS.
---
Really rich too.  So rich, in fact, you aren't allowed to see how much he pays in taxes.
---
Seriously??
---
Yeah it appears to be broken. I can not enter as well on Xbox. Can't finish Cheating Death.
---
Right, and it’s illegal to say a design choice is stupid?
---
It’s a game about collecting junk. This event is trading our collected junk for stuff that is worse than that junk....
---
Well, WoW has an even more brutal daily grind (and reputation grind). It has ome raid in each tier, but you farm that over and over and over again, with the RNG (and there are some pararels: 1-2-3 stars here, normal-titamforged/cursed/etc-extra gemmed there).
---
In F76... it is not as bad.
---
All issues are due to expectations not being met.I spend a lot of money on atoms because I primarily build. This update is non-issue for me. I used the wall to door just to get in and out of my base. I've used it to clip lines and such before, but it's not required. It's not game breaking and it sure isn't a reason for this many people to get up in arms. It's no different than the ammo convertor or all the other ridiculous things people complain about. This issue will disappear just like all those and then something else will happen and the cycle starts over. There's nothing noble or productive about it.
---
Who?
---
Ladydevann, can't you just make another external account and truly tell the community what's going on behind that curtain? We all KNOW those 'concerns' already that's why we see broken patch after broken patch. You're the CM of this company, everytime this company fucks up the people come up at you, aren't you some day tired of getting all the blame for mistakes that weren't your fault only because your boss doesn't want to move a finger?
---
While they are at it can they look at how a player's level on the map tops out at 1023 no matter how much higher they are? Been in the game since last November. 
---
It got worse after public teams.  It used to show correct level if you were at the same location, now it's 1023 no matter what.
---
You underestimate the amount of players this game has and you overestimate the opinions from reddit.
---
Where uhhhh did you farm for that?
---
Does complaining on here actually reach them?
---
nice! I don't like having to build near water sources just to cook conveniently. That sounds handy!
---
Agree 100%
---
its not everyone.. its the same people over and over..
---
almost like they just wait for patches and then furiously dispense derision ans division for a few days.. and then go away until the next patch..
---
a quick spin through post history usually bears this out..
---
I agree with most of these things except the hunger and thirst one. I am all for taking that away. Tired of lugging around useless food and drink all the time. I'm happy they went the route that if someone wants the buff from eating and drinking, then they can do so, if they don't, they can also do that. Maybe I am the minority but I never liked this mechanic.
---
selfish? i put 10k in lmao
---
we are at 75 million steel at this point, your post is completely irreverent.
---
Damn,this was a hell of a write-up. You really exposed Bethesda's lack of communication with the 76 community.
---
I'd love to see an official response to this from BGS.
---
There's a fair few players in the game, if even a quarter of them drop in a bit of junk it'll add up. They also just recently unbanned plenty of dupers without inventory wipes, so they might be dropping in some junk as a thank you. There's always the possibility that the numbers are getting fudged too, although 60% in one day seems a bit too obvious if so
---
All people tagged are Bethesda community managers. They're on here.
---
I agree, I love this game too and I do believe it'll get better by the end of this year.
---
Dude I still need to put the Project76.ini file into read mode every time I want to run the game
---
Ok but the question wasnt specific to secret service armor. The question was about the mods.
---
This is why I’m not participating in the event. I just know Bethesda’s going to auto-complete it and the fact that they aren’t showing metrics is basically the smoking gun to this whole thing. They’re lying to our faces.
---
And you believe that number?
---
Nah, people do the same in every game. WoW is a good example... whine, whine  whine...
---
Normal mentality people just ignore those crybabies and play the game... and god forbid: enjoy it.
---
IMO it’s actually Bethesda attempting to silently nerf PVP.
---
Yeah I agree with you on some points. But 1. Gold bullion was designed to make players go out of their way to slowly grind for treasury notes only to turn in 200 a day. Now imagine if a person with a job wanted to get T65 power armor. And can't get on each day. How long will that take? I don't know. Probably longer than a casual player, which can lead to it being a drag.
---
2. The season pass IS free content. Yes. But when most of all apparel is glitched out or broken it shows how Bethesda really doesn't care too much. And they replaced the free atoms with SCORE. Which pretty much sucks. We were making so much atoms back then. Now we really have to pay to get the new Atomic shop items.
---
And 3. The ATLAS provisions have nothing of value inside them. I understand if its not gonna be amazing but at least make an effort. Like maybe a backpack skin or a new BOS outfit. Something small and simple that will make donating your hard earned materials worth it.
---
That's all I have to comment on.
---
&gt;First of all I would like to say to the community managers its not your fault
---
Actually, I disagree. They're part of the problem.
---
Community managers don't do what their own job titles says - manage the community.
---
The only thing they respond to are bug reports and the occasional positive post. Everything else is ignored.
---
They're less community managers and more data analysts that collect and report data from the community for the dev team to mostly ignore.
---
If they actually managed their community like a lot of better managed gaming communities are, do you think we'd have half the issues we've had? Like the 6 days of not knowing if Seasons would be free after the first one? Would this post even be necessary if they responded to community issues?
---
Bethesda need to hire Fallout 4's modders to fix the game
---
People have 1000s off hours played but there is no content?
---
Which raider questline? Wastelanders?
---
It's Bethesda inflating the numbers, not players doing it
---
I respectfully disagree. You are viewing this from a single perspective. For starters, not even who duped did it to profit. If you run the numbers, you'll see that some of these items are virtually impossible to obtain. That's the reason people exploit in both cases: Poor game design.
---
Ahh I see, sacrificing, not choking. Will try that next. And just to be clear, it's your own chicken or can it be anyone's chicken? Asking for a friend
---
I didn’t see them in there yesterday at all on XB1. I plan to check again today after daily resets.
---
This game is falling into the same hole that destiny did, time gating exhausts the players drive to play. This game will loose majority of the playerbase as more vets aquire everything they want and get over the legendary run. I'm surprised this game isn't dead already, it's like an abusive relationship with the lies that Bethesda has spread since day one. Bethesda has broken the record of bad choices made for any game I've played. They're first mistake was using the Creation Engine, which obviously is the root of alot of the bugs and technical problems. And then making private servers paid and not making mods widespread showed the community how inept the devs are at doing their jobs. All the while nothing is tested in game before release, and even if it is its pushed back a month, sometimes longer if it's broken enough, due to how unserviceavle and broken it is. It's incredible how much of a mess up this game is. Seems hypocritical coming from a Lvl 200+ but I'll gladly uninstall this game to play anything else at this point.
---
Tldr this game doodoo
---
Oh no, no, no, no,....forget SLIGHTLY askew (generous of you to be so optimistic :D).....they will be wholly unable to snap to current walls, floors or themselves!!!
---
Yup main is busted, you can’t progress.
---
I truly beleive that fo76 was so unsuccessful compared to other titles, that Bethesda pulled out the majority of competent developers and is barely keeping it alive with a skeleton crew. All these 'major updates' have been incredibly barebones and lackluster
---
I've noticed that a lot of the time (like every two out of three shots) with VATS are a miss. I waste more ammo using vats than not. Honestly at this point I use it to locate enemies and then back straight out.
---
&gt;You cannot reasonably justify purchasing an asset bundle for 1/6th of the price of the game the assets were ripped from.
---
You can not reasonably justify purchasing a T shirt that has a logo on it for x2 the price of a shirt without the logo on it. Same concept applies. Value is in the eye of the beholder and not everyone has the same value on things as you do.   
---
I bought the black bird pain job for power armor with a 10 dollar boost to my atoms and I am satisfied with my purchase because it was worth the money to me. 
---
A T-shirt or a GPU or anything doesn't have a set value. It's value is what ever the seller thinks they can get away with while still drawing in customers.  When AMD creates a new GPU the heavens do not open and the voice of God doesn't declare the price of it as a fundamental nature of reality.  No AMD looks at the cost to make it, looks at the market and it's prices and how well previous new GPU's have sold and comes up with the sale price that will ideally provide them the most profit per unit sold and be low enough to target anyone looking to upgrade to purchase theirs instead of Intel's. 
---
Your complete and total failure to address any of my arguments is the Dunning-Kruger effect in full force.
---
&gt; Other games have monetization, nothing close to being as ridiculous as the Atom Store.

Ignorance is not a defense.  Fortnite and Apex both have cosmetic skin sales AND paid battle passes. GTA Online's card sharks have not followed inflation as on launch 99 USD getting 8 million GTA$ would let you buy all the high end cars. Were as now most high end cars are 2-3M each meaning your get less for the same value.  And it was passed around reddit not to long ago that to buy all the Sims 4 DLC would cost around 300 dollars.  
---
So yea there are plenty of games that are close if not worse then the atomic store. Depending on your PoV.
---
&gt; You’re a tool. 
---
The fact you refuse to address any arguments I make actually shows you as the tool. You are afraid of people with a different opinion and you know your own doesn't have any ground to stand on so you deflect and evade because actually addressing my enlargement would render you disarmed.
---
Armor an weapons used to give higher defense and attack damage when they over repaired to 200% but they fixed/took it away that when they introduced repair kits. Something we never asked for in the first place.
---
Ok thought so. It’s just annoying to level out the foundation to slightly abound the grass...
---
They aren’t there as of 8:30 a.m. (EST) today.
---
Maybe not, but they are asking for your time to go collect steel and for you to spend materials that you could craft ammo with instead. You'll get way more out of turning that steel into ammo, than turning it into Atlas.
---
I think I'd actually have been more annoyed if they put in some incredible exclusive ultra rare plans with ridiculous drop rates and no trading. As a non-FIst player I wouldn't stand a chance of actually getting any for the amount of grind I would need while FIst players would find it pretty easy with the amount of scrap they've collected.
---
Not that I wouldn't want others to have stuff...but if they were at least tradable so I could help my friend with his scrap box collect materials then he could pass along extra plans it wouldn't be so bad.
---
At this point it just seems so worthless...I'll just use my minimal time to get the legendary run score events done first.
---
No. But you should be open to the fact that there is a reason behind it and not being combative when people try and explain it to you calmly.
---
Do you think they should actively incentivize people to AFK in an online game? It seems like you didn’t consider that in your post.
---
Yeah I am in the same boat. Can't enter the mine to finish this quest.
---
I have found a new way to earn caps. Do line in the sand, scrap all the weapons which can net me up to 4000 steel. Donate the steel and if lucky get 1000-2000 caps. The grenades and booze suck though.
---
What was the exploit?
---
A company that gives a shit would do it your way but Bethesda is not such a company.
---
First day and we are halfway there? Good.
---
Now it’s 11, but yes.
---
Lol! That’s your value. Don’t foster it onto others. For new players that haven’t gotten everything they might see it different.
---
Thinking only your values count is again, selfish.
---
Maybe I'm missing something but I leave thousands of steel on the ground every day as it's worthless.
---
I thought getting a participation beret was pretty good.
---
I didn't know I should be given diamonds, furs and fast cars for it!
---
If that’s what you think
---
Holy crap.. I decided to throw some steel at it to see... a stimpack, a bottle of bourbon and a floater grenade for 250 fucking steel!? what kinda assetry is that x.x  
---
That was a thousand rounds of 50cal worth of steel wasted x.x
---
Oof. You poor fellow. Having such low expectations. You're like the poster child for mediocrity.
---
Yep I’ll miss 2-3 95% shots in a row. Even at close range
---
BoS should be endgame content. They should be raiding camps to take resources they feel entitled to. They should be mobbing workshops. You should be finding BoS Hordes in areas. And if you want to join them they can recognize paints and uniforms the way the responder eyebot recognizes you in gear.
---
FYI, there are 9k people online on steam alone. Probably close to 40-50k across platforms.
---
I agree with your sentiment though.
---
All is good for you now adrenaline is fix huh?
---
Well maybe now you can down off the pillar and join the event with everyone else.
---
Broken on Xbox as well. I am standing in front of it as I type this. Can't enter the cave..
---
imagine writing this internet essay acting like the moral majority only to find out that there absolutely zero substance to the concern that people will make the event fail.
---
Accurate at every point 👌
---
Viva la Revolución!!!!!
---
I'm new to game but why are you using ground pounder if going full rifle?
---
I think this happens all the time because it's actually two different people that the brain has grouped into a monolith, a very common whoopsie. People will do this with their political rivals as well. I think the common thread here is that the challenges aren't fun so they often feel like an insult. Something that is very simple can seem difficult if it is so bland that the boredom it causes is hard to bear. Think of gamer achievements: these don't have any bearing on the game but when they identify some hyper-specific activity you perform by referencing a bit of the narrative and through wordplay, it feels intimate and meaningful. Now think of chewing bubblegum for the 5th time this week, hollow and mechanical. Imagine if all of the challenges were space themed in the legendary run? If there were 3 different phases of challenge that changed depending on the phase of the run you were on. Just like that you can take a simple thing like the name of a challenge and make it immersive and moody.
---
Perhaps, but I’d rather be put into a centralized hub world and then join another server where I don’t have to wait 5 minutes to wait for players and choosing a map.
---
It would also solve the problem of people loading in faster because it wouldn’t be loading in an entirely different cell it would just be displaying a map over the same cell
---
Well, not in the corner, otherwise SBQ ragdolls off into glitched hell
---
I donated 6K, mainly because there are some regular raider armors I don't have and they aren't sold by vendors.  
---
I didn't get anything worthwhile with the 6K, so I'm done donating.
---
They've most likely not seen the loot table.
---
Hmm. I’m on the middle of it now and haven’t hit that wall yet I guess
---
Also, those "lot of people" just the loud minority, they try to be look bigger, but they are just a minority.
---
Because feed the people with 10 people in sure is hard
---
Yes, of course, but the games who have 100000 on steam are available on other platforms as well.
---
Well there went 15 minutes of my day! How dare you post an awesome sub about goofy cats! That, sir, is a malicious use of cuteness and distraction! How DARE you!? :D
---
Right, most players make no consciouss effort to make believable bases, but the game doesn’t exactly make it easy for those who want to do that either. Instead of grounded looking building options, it’s all a mishmash of modern looking house and mansion sets, with bizzare decorations that look like they’re out of Disneyland. But this is a whole other topic
---
heh, is the donation guy in a Hazmat suit?
---
Sweet...I know handmade is preferred but how is the radium for you?does it rock in pvp? Worth trading for one?I think the fact that mods for it are low chance to learn is very intriguing to me
---
Im Gonna go ahead and guess the numbers of actual devs on The 76 team.....
---
3
---
I can't fathom why they fight against building so much.  This game would be AMAZING if they just let you build anything anywhere and have full persistence.  It would be like Fallout Minecraft, and many thousands of people would all be here just building worlds.  Nope, here's your tiny camp.  It's vastly smaller than what you could do in FO4.  You might lose it.  You may have a hell of a time placing it if it's complex at all or big at all.  We want to make it really hard for you to actually design anything.  Oh?  You want to make it even harder to build?  Cool!
---
The strange thing is Bethesda is fighting against one critical element that could generate them high revenue.  They have an Atom store that could be FILLED with cool building kits, custom skins for all types of designs/themes, and they could sell all of this on top of the basic set originally given.  There's a lot of people that want world building games and FO is a tremendously great platform for that, especially if you work with spawn points, agro systems, and maybe even a.i. work and enemy camp growth systems.  Heck, get fancy and work with faction/race reputation based on who you help/fight against and incorporate trading between a.i. and humans too.  This might be reputation or through stealth and costume.  Work with or against raiders, with or against super mutants, or stick with humans and factions of those humans.  This could be tremendous and very dynamic gameplay.  Fight for resources and manipulate the landscape.  Bethesda could be pumping out piles of custom armor and weapons for all these groups, all kinds of skins, thousands of them, and just let the game worlds run wild with whatever people make up.  People could nuke giant enemy camps and shift the landscape or just be a dick and nuke a human town and force the people to rebuild.
---
The fun part is every server is a new world that's built entirely different.  You could stick with one server for a long time and shape that "planet" over time, or hop between servers and get wildly different landscapes.  One might be human dominated with huge cities, and another might be a super mutant empire with small human presence.
---
All Bethesda would ever have to do is host servers and pump out skins.  Heck, allow private servers, and let people make custom worlds, maybe even be able to tweak the metrics of that world to make it pleasant, harsh, strong enemies, barren, lush, etc.  Maybe the main game servers are already this way, each tweaked a certain way.  Bethesda just lets the players go wild, and they just sit back creating new armor, weapons, building pieces, furniture, and piles of skins for each to sell.  They could rake in a billion dollars a year if they just had a good system in place.
---
Its sad to see bethesda go from one of the most beloved game companies a few years ago to being worse than EA now
---
Many people have already made that comparison before that the ingame limits are more like 'energy' in mobile and f2p games. If you now look at the previous main focus of Bethesda Austin (the amateur dev studio currently messing with 76) it makes sense why they would approach it like that.
---
HEHE
---
You know, even when vats was stationary in fallout 3 and new vegas, I still had problems with 95% hit ratios. I don't know why they haven't fixed it. I want to defend Bethesda on this but I honestly can't on this issue because this is very well known and has a past history. 
---
The least bethesda can do is give us an explanation why it's not fixed. I'd take that over feeling ignored.
---
You mean you don’t li...
---
I'd also ask, how is the Assault Rifle modded?  Did you overlook something obvious, like giving it a long barrel?
---
"A successful multiplayer game has 100000 players online, we are like 12000."
---
This number is steam only. There are 2 consoles and Bethesda launcher versions that are not included.
---
It’s the time and the resources (primarily steel) can be used else where. Like ammunition and crafting for legendary rolls. This is strictly an opinion and I don’t know why people take things to heart. This is how I feel about the state of the game. I’m not trying to persuade someone else’s opinion.  But I agree with you. Time inside and out side of the game holds the value. You can get the weapon you desire but how long are you willing to wait or pay for it. 
---
It all comes down to personal presences and points of view.
---
&gt;They design great worlds but basically they are just like modders.
---
You take that back, modders actually care about the game. Bethesda's developers are more like random people off the street that they threw into a van, gave a half-assed 5 minute walkthrough of about a third of their toolset, and then just told to do whatever.
---
I doubt many will even read the long ass rant haha
---
No, I had high expectations on F76 after playing every other fallout. But now I play it for 1,5 years and I'm just realistic.
---
The only thing missing is icon on your end. 
---
It’s annoying for sure
---
&gt; looking into my legal rights 
---
LOL. Ok.
---
Join the Enclave...we have cookies.
---
Sounds right. I’ve come to see this about those players.
---
They are only interested in some aspects of the game. Which seems to be centered around grinding for specific armor and weapons. It’s doing only a handful of events for get this to happen,
---
In short, their only interest seems to be around making powerful characters so that nothing in the game is a challenge. 
---
And every time something in the game doesn’t serve their only interests they freak.
---
Sure. It’s still a top title even if there are other games that are more popular. Just saying a lot of people do play the game.
---
Will there ever be shadowed mods made available?
---
Oh.
---
yes I know, but the games on steam who have 100000 are available on other platforms as well. So theres no real difference here.
---
Scavenger collection gets fiber optics and circuits
---
If the Purveyor Sale doesn't include 50% off the Modules, I really don't care. It never has, why would this time be any different. I'm not going to buy harpoons, broadsiders, and missle launchers with my scrip.
---
Nope you can even be killed by explosive bait with pacifist on I believe.
---
youd have to be pretty clueless to think that bethesda inst going to give out the rewards irrespective of the actual junk donated. like really, you think they are going to public show that there wasnt enough interested to donate simple junk to get a reward? reah right, the numbers are designed to make the games playerbase *look* active, whether it is or not. we are in no risk of not getting this stuff, no point in dumping 100k steel into this event.
---
Not giving to a lazy and uninspired event? Yea I'm not calling for boycotts but this ain't worth it.
---
Faster reload and better hip fire.  Weapons that do more than 1000 damage don't benefit from tank killer
---
Im a day 1 Fo76 player, and played Runescape from RSC to RS3, almost 14 years. I understand the grind.
---
I really hope there are 800k+ active players, but the numbers I hear mostly for player population are in the 400k - 500k range.
---
And for Runescape events it didnt seem matter if you have lvl 1 skills or 99, everyone gathered at about the same rate and didnt have the stash limitations 76 has.
---
In 76 though, if you dont have First, you likely have less than 200 cork in your stash unless you bulk, offload to a mule or have grade A stash weight management skills.
---
That, like I said in my OP leaves first members and vets to do the heavy lifting/donating and farming of items, so that we actually complete the donation portion of this.
---
No or not enough donations = no rewards or BGS has to auto complete the event so the game doesnt look like a flop.
---
And whats my incentive to help the community?
---
1.Alcohol that I already drop and vendor because of weight and abundance
---
2. stimpacks that mostly end up in my vendor because of weight and ease of finding them
---
3.grenades that I already drop and vendor because I cant use them fast enough
---
4.plans that ive already been collecting and grinding on for the past umpteen months
---
5.caps that im sitting on stacks of because there arent many good wastes of caps once you've bought and collected every plan including serums and have barely any stash left for legendaries.
---
And im not looking for amazing rewards, if you reread my original comment I noted I would be more than happy with reskinned items already in the game and plans for assets already in the game, like the Bomber jacket with the black underarmor instead of orange.
---
All I was hoping for was a little something BoS themed for my donations, not more stuff thats going to be dropped or vendored because of stash/weight limitations. Even bullion + scrip rewards would have been some incentive... but no. 
---
All they keep throwing at us lately seems to be low effort/recycled content attempts on their part, to get us to log into adventure, play NW, and fluff their numbers.
---
Its also not the first time vets have been treated this way. We got given a fancy outfit for sticking around before Wastelanders dropped and the helm still isnt able to be crafted.
---
So while im not quite at pitchfork territory...
---
Enough is enough BGS.
---
We are talking about in the past few weeks you were supposed to be gathering steel. Many people have no place to put said steel so they didn’t gather it. Now they have to run around and collect it themselves.
---
Also, 15 minutes while overencumbered is a **lot of time**. Idk if you know this about game design, but 15 minutes is something you need stuff to happen in otherwise it creates a negative player feedback loop.
---
How is the Appalachia Brotherhood “fascists”? Are you conflating it with the more xenophobic Brotherhood of Fallout 4? Bear in mind, Fallout 76 takes place only 25 years after the bombs fall. Arthur Maxson, from Fallout 4, won’t be born for another 156 years.
---
This is one of my strong feelings as well.  In looking in my 1st box, I realize I simply don't need the vast majority of what is in there, which is why I donated some to the atlas event.
---
"Plus not everyone reads the patch notes!"
---
It's not really Bethesda's fault that most people in this community pick and choose what to read about the game.
---
I have deep respect for modders, but they dont code, they work with a precoded engine and a frontend.
---
steel is everywhere yo.. making the run from 76 into overseers camp will net hundreds without many bullets spent(until we get one wasteland'd)..
---
shit.. noobs can melee every mob in that loop no problems
---
much ado about nothing IMO..
---
I bulk and vend more steel for a portion of my daily caps limit than I actually use on 2 out of 3 of my toons(3rd is commando so.. yeah.. that one isnt donating any steel)
---
I agree there are areas for improvement. I just don’t see 10+ minutes between matches.
---
"Hey bethesda where's our BoS thing, we donated all the steel you wanted?"
---
Bethesda: No, we wanted the 150 million per player...
---
"Wtf?!? That's not... why?! "
---
bethesda: (makes todd face)
---
(confused screaming)
---
bethesda: "We need cork..."
---
[edit: (stroke)]
---
I think my combativeness comes from all the frustrations with this game added up, and then getting shit on when I voice them. I know this is a very trivial thing but there are much better-worded complaints about the more important things, this is just something i glanced at and (like always) scoffed at and thought i’d post about.
---
You’re right, i didn’t consider that people would AFK for it. And i’m sorry that i came off like a dick.
---
I think it’s just time to hang this game up again for a while. Would you happen to know if ESO is worth trying out? I’ve honestly heard nothing bad about it other than when it first came out, and apparently they’ve improved QOL and other issues significantly since then.
---
I think something that should be communicated to those in charge is that Bethesda has proven to be *extremely* out of touch with the user base. In particular with regard to priorities and scheduling.
---
Time and time again, things are patched/nerfed/broken for absolutely no quantifiable or sensible reason, and it has the unintended consequence of driving away large chunks of your user base. The recent C.A.M.P. "fixes" are a shining example, but there are countless others.  The developers are spending time and resources "fixing" these things that _nobody_ wants "fixed", while neglecting issues actually worth addressing. Like say......V.A.T.S.  And just like before, this is just one example, there are countless others.
---
It's also very disappointing as a user to see the A.T.O.M. shop full of pointless campy gimmickey cosmetic items (which again, take *time* to create) while leaving game crippling bugs for almost half of a year.
---
In my opinion this speaks to a massive failure on two fronts. The biggest failure is scheduling and priorities. With as many game crippling bugs there are in this game, that is the ONLY thing people should be working on. There are massive bugs that need to be fixed. This should be an "all hands on deck" situation. When you fix the game, then go back to working on the next stuffed animal for sale.
---
The second massive failure is that of user engagement. Whoever is directing the dev tasking is so out of touch, they have failed at their job in the worst way. There are so many places you could engage your users and find out what they actually want and how they actually play the game. Bethesda really needs to take advantage of that, or this game will fail.
---
Sooner than you think.
---
Yeh, it's another scandal... So many issues. It's embarrassing, I can't find another word.
---
Then it's kinda weird you made your previous post as a reply to me. I was just answering your question about reaching the cap. Stash limit is relevant to that discussion since it's one of the root causes of the problem.   
---
Like I said, the caps themselves aren't important. In Fo4 they serve a normal purpose for a currency; you buy stuff you need. Fo4 doesn't have a universal caps pool for every trader in the world, and you're not limited in terms of storage.   
---
There's no pressing need to sell your loot unless you need to buy something.
---
At a certain point in 76 caps basically become a way to convert the progress you make into something you don't have to throw away to save inventory space. And you're even capped on the total caps you can hold.   
---
Legendary purveyor rolls *could* have been a caps sink, but they made scrip the currency for that and there's no direct conversion from caps to scrip (unless I'm forgetting something)   
---
Bullion *could* have been a caps sink, but Smiley is limited per week and, much like caps in every other game, there's not a whole lot worth buying after a while.   
---
All I'm really saying is the systems that 76 has actively prevent you from being able to just play the game.   
---
Log on daily. Do your chores. Come back tomorrow.  
---
EDIT: And to be clear, I'm not saying raising the caps cap (or even having a worthwhile/effective caps sink) would *fix* the issue, but it would likely alleviate it a bit in terms of your daily play session.
---
I came back to the game recently, and that just so happened to be the quest I was on when this patch was implemented (Cheating Death). Wonder how many months it'll be before I can clear that one. 🙄
---
The idea is probably to allow players to gradually increase carry weight. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Maybe it’s because the company ZeniMax decided to add under the Bethesda banner is newer, pretty much screwing the company over by giving them a difficult project to work on and are probably inexperienced rather than using their own team, ZeniMax online, who works on ESO.
---
It's not, you just offended some salty fanboys
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but to my knowledge fo76 is already limited to 60 fps, if you don't change the setting manually in the ini.
---
I plan on donating till one of my characters gets the Ultracite Gatling Laser Plan.  I haven't been able to score one yet from Cranberry Bog missions and I have a sweet legendary one that could be sweeter if modded!
---
I exhausted my steel supply crafting 10k ammo for my 50 cal and 13k ammo for my prime Two Shot Gauss minigun   in preparation for the colossal problem event (which didn't actually launch with the patch).
---
What a bunch of baloney...
---
The difference is the game was over a year old when it was finally released on steam. So the vast majority of players are on the non-steam side. While almost every single other game releases on steam at launch. I'm not defending bughesda or this travesty of a game, just saying your numbers are wrong.
---
I think it might have actually been used back then? But I get the same feel from this as I did from the one Railroad dude in Fo4. I like when stuff is cheeky though, so yo
---
&gt; You are being hostile for no reason, and aren't even making much sense. 
---
I'm not being hostile I am amused by the apparent contradiction in people.
---
&gt; Most of the items in the shop are their own items, and not paints or  cosmetics appied to existing in-game objects. The Fasnacht masks are  their own mask, not a paint for the actual mask, to give another  example, as are most of the outfits and dresses, even when they are a  recolor of something else, like the camo SS underarmor. Until not long  ago, backpacks used to follow this same logic as well. 
---
And what effect does the Fasnacht Mask have? What effect does the camo SS underarmor have?
---
Am I the only one that shows 0/125M?
---
i did once, restarted ps4, fixed it
---
The general player doesn't keep tabs like the reddit community. Many players may see the the ITV or the promotion for the event coming and then go to play. It's them that get caught even more off guard
---
That seems a bit optimistic to me, but also quite possible.
---
But you also have to wonder how many of the total players know to contribute, I would say that while the people on here are not the majority of player, they are for the most part well informed players, as compared to your average player..
---
There's also a good number of players from Wastelanders and the Xbox game pass thing that might not be in a position to donate thousand of steel easily.
---
We won't truly know, but it will be interesting to see how it unfolds, especially on the rarer mats.
---
Because spamming an emote is inspiring.
---
I never knew snapping a half wall to a roof to make a fireplace would have such a detrimental impact on the entire community.
---
Picked this up from /all
---
I stopped playing 76 a couple of months ago, but this post could have been posted then.  Just goes to show that the 'care' for this game never changes.
---
I mean, just think about this patch you're describing.  Two screwups and the only fix is taking away something people use as a harmless work around.  That's where the devs head's are.
---
Also, ESO is being produced by Zenimax, not in house Bethesda.  I remember being so pissed FOR YEARS that Zenimax could have a slice of the TES IP.  Now I'm so fucking glad that someone other than Todd and Bethesda can keep a decent product in the mark for us to enjoy TES.
---
My main camp is double wall cinderblock. I literally made Crane's treasure hunter warehouse.  I'm stuck by Slocum's Joe now. I don't want to lose my build.
---
Are you kidding? Cheaters in NW get to frolic around ghost punching everyone for weeks if not -MONTHS- before they finally get banned, only to come right back on a new burner.
---
Last I checked a guy I saw flying and insta-killing everyone in the match still hasn't been banned and it's definitely been over a month now.
---
To be fair... The water purifier you can place on the ground can only hold/produce two purified. 
---
Still, you’d think a rain collector would actually *collect* a bit.
---
isn't the tally already at 75 million donated
---
I haven’t played ESO personally but I know a lot of people do enjoy it. My understanding is there are more p2w elements but I could be wrong. Seems like it would be fun to pick up.
---
In general, one should not remove the armor, but replace it with a similar piece. Each piece of armor affects stealth. Your test is not entirely correct.
---
It should be done wrong. Take armor with a perk and the same, but without it.
---
The junkies prolly said it back then, or the Cubans lol
---
That may not be about the double walls though.
---
Also, you pay in camp budget for double walls and camp budget is what is used to manage the performance of camps.
---
One of my biggest complaints is the misc tab in the pipboy, mine is so full of keys, multiple keycards to hornwright a and b and other stuff I can’t drop I can’t find the stuff I actually want.
---
still feels like actionboy and gunsmith are broken but when I brought it up it seem like nobody else does...
---
Yes. The average (majority) player do not know about datamined stuff etc. like people on this rather active sub does.
---
Bethesda, I posted and sent errors reports about tons of my camps being built. all of which took over at least 1-5 hours to design due to Testing to ensure they Look Good, serve Function, and were less likely to bug out. They all showed Green when I tried to place them from storage on the flattest none-obstructed lands possible. But they will not place.
---
On top of that, you haven't reached out to us about these issues. I said before, I just want to know that you guys are trying to fix these major issues.
---
I have cancelled my subscription, and I am going to change my recommendation to don't buy on steam. I really love your game designs and your quests and stories. I've been playing since Oblivion. But to lose hours of work to a simple placement bug, its too much.
---
I understand now why people hate this game so much, and I hope you guys will do better next time.
---
Yes actually a keyring to condense much of that has been a regular request here. I forgot to add that one
---
It wouldn't matter if people boycotted. They would most likely just auto complete the event and say it was a success to give the false impression that people actually participated.
---
Do you honestly think with everything that's happening, Bethesda has time for the PR embarrassment of missing turn-in milestones? Of course they're cooking the books! These are not real numbers.
---
Hold on to your scrap, the rewards are trash and our contributions don't matter.
---
Hate to say, but it was like this at times for me before this patch. Could draw the bow, but no arrow was put in.
---
I honestly think their doing instanced camps because the software can not handle them on the map at once. I don't get the server lag on private server.
---
&gt; Yea I'm not calling for boycotts
---
Then this wasn’t aimed at you was it?
---
Keep hoarding, bro.
---
They had to go ahead and get rid of the wallpaper trick now so there will be less backlash when they introduce Interior Wallpapers for 2000 Atoms in the Atomic Shop later.
---
Come join the raiders. You don’t have to give shit to anyone. In fact you can go and steal shit from others we don’t care
---
never used it, and I can't remember if I stashed or vended. You on PC?

According to the "ref" tab all the brewing stuff, bulk scrap and quest/event items are on the list. From the gold bullion stuff I only see the Secret Service Armor, Thorn Armor, Solar Armor and Strangler Heart power Armor there, so maybe weapons will trigger it. Haven't tested it.
---
Boycott atlas too, incase the whole stop giving them money approach fails
---
The math I did earlier suggested we just needed to donate 17k a player at max to reach that number. Could be half that number though. 
---
Considering all the dupers and FO1st with upwards of 100k, only 1/10 of players could represent the entire population. Like others have said, while the game is seeing a decline the players saying they were done with this game is representing a minority who cared that much. not many people were upset with this update as opposed to how many players got bored after wastelanders finished, when the game number dropped off by 50%.
---
Modders just have more experience with the game engine. Developers lay the ground work and don't really do or can't really do quality checks in their work due to time restrictions. Zenimax seems to want decent products out the door that work OK but great.
---
Then you got take two interactive and they know who they have working for them so they let them work and if the game needs to be delayed by some months then they allow it cause damn the expense. Once the game comes out,its always an absolute hit and the quality shows in the developers work. Namely Red dead redemption 2. Gta:o is another beast in itself though. It just prints too much money to let go for minimal work and so much expertise now with that game engine.
---
You can speak about what you want.

Complaining about removing of an unwanted and unintended feature is not the same as talking about new features... 
---
But, reddit has its own way and everything what is not exactly the opinion of the crowd gets down voted...
---
I'm sure they have their motives and fucking with the player base is absolutely not their motive..
---
So let's down vote this one...
---
This sub drives people away with it's large negative tone. So it gives a very skewed perception of the players. It's literally why there are several FO76 forums. Filthycausals was formed because people couldn't talk about the game here without being always attacked by the hardcore players who are demented.
---
maybe try another browser

I was with you my man.  Still am. This event is just another reminder that they mail in events.  Are they ever   gonna fix the big problems?  Fast travel, trade glitch, wonky ass AI.

BOYCOTT ATLAS
---
It is so sad that they can't live up to the way ESO is in all honesty. This game could be the bees knees, yet the fuck with our heads and get our hopes up for nothingness. Add some dungeons battlegrounds and an activity finder and this game will demolish.
---
Agreed!
---
Rather rarely, though.
---
Although I suppose they could just program it so the chance of finding junk with fiber optics or circuitry could be somewhat uncommon itself.
---
“I’ll fuckin’ do it again...”

Considering pre-war Fallout was set in the late 21st century, that doesn't really matter.

And I've been here since beta, so I'm not looking for instant gratification, just a shot at something cool. Since I have every single thing in these packages, my motivation's low. If there were a few unique things in the mix (Again, like the unique stuff in the Miner Pails), or even some neat stuff that I can't get more of, like the BOS paints, even with a low drop rate, I'd be in. I'm not looking for "Get a circus trailer for 250 steel, every time" levels of drop, but one of those 1% things, like the Pants Suit or Shorts Suit from Halloween. Low odds, but still a chance, you know? And by being so low, it'd encourage more investment from the community since everyone would be chasing that drop.
---
The other events were done better is all I'm saying. I played a *ton* of Fastnacht and never got all the masks but that's fine. I played a ton of Meat Week and only finally sold my last Tenderizer a couple months ago. I'm real bad at all the combat stuff but I still have fun playing.
---
I'm just not going to throw away tons of loot for a bottle of booze and an Ultracite arm plan, you know?
---
welch (use bench on ground level by the crowned spawn) to hunters (use the chemists lab to scrap in the trailer on the road towards west tek) to radio picking everything up I saw also At that point odds will be high that you are fat and waddling even scraping at the back building so if you have 1st ready your tent.  
---
Timing it from landing in welch was 15:12. In welch do not go upstairs in the houses but do loot the lower levels for pots pans whatever you see.   
---
Though the best farm is a glitched line of fire event you can get 3-4K in steel easy.
---
I seem to remember reading this wasn't supposed to happen but I made a new camp last week and guess what, grass through the floor.  Looks like shit. What happened?
---
At this point? Good. The game is utter trash, not because of the premise or even most of the existing gameplay features, but because of the sheer ineptitude of the developers. Every step forward brings us two or three steps backward, with them failing to test even basic things they add to the game like fucking armor skins. It's a joke, but I'm not laughing any more.
---
yeah, the "event" isnt even an event. its just everyone individually dumping shit in a box. woo
---
if your first shot is 95% and you miss. dont take the next shot. exit vats and enter it again, then the 95% will be a hit.
---
"This sub drives people away with it's large negative tone." I honestly think bughesda is doing that themselves. People here are just responding to extremely bad choices in game design and the amount of issues the game still has, while being nearly 2 years old.
---
Update about the situation: Im gonna try the quest on my other pc. If it works i'll let you guys know.
---
I am hopeful that this protest will show result. I don't think this is unfair or bad language people are using. This jus shows that the community is there and cares.
---
In my experience it shaved off almost the whole weight of heavier armor while giving an ap boost. The difference was always like 3 weight which I have learned to trade off for the boost.
---
&gt;	But you also have to wonder how many of the total players know to contribute,
---
Fair point. They don’t do a good job informing players in game. I guess my point is there are a lot of super passionate players who will carry the team. 
---
We will certainly see.
---
I'm with you.  Trying to grab a few of those raider under-armor plans.  Still probably won't get them with horrible RNG.
---
To simply write off calls for action with some bigger things in 2020 rant is aimed at me.  People use thos shot to escape 2020 my friend.  Some people arnt gonna take on the world but might wanna express frustrations on a message board.
---
Okay. I agree with everything you said except one thing. I came to FO76 from ESO, after giving up on it after 3 years of actively playing it because they DO NOT communicate, they don't even have customers support except for the name nor do I ever received a reply to support ticket, nor the mentioned problems  ever been addressed to..  I'm not saying FO76 is way much better, but I like it more. Sure they make a lot of poor decisions, but the game is continuing to slowly improve. It takes time and competence which is a rare resource nowadays almost anywhere. And before anyone replies I'm not defending them at all, this criticism is well deserved and they ought to do something about current problems. But I hope Fo76 will never become what ESO now is, they always ignored community's feedback, they never cared about subscribers (never gave them shit for buying sub which is almost as expensive as FO1st) nor did they care about bugs unless those benefited players.
---
So Im a spinless wasted soul? If youd like to think so, go ahead. Id like to think youre wrong.
---
Maybe i save my anger and activism for things that matter and play games to escape real life stress. IMHO If games arent fun youre doing it wrong.
---
I am truly blown away that they would dedicate ANY resources to fixing loopholes in the camp building that allow players to do cool things in their camps when there are so many more broken things in the game that actually negatively impact the playerbase. 
---
Whoever OK'd this must be TRYING to piss the players off.
---
Yeah, I'm about to the "fuck this game" stage. I'll just watch Angry Turtle videos till Cyberpunk 2077 comes out.
---
Agreed, though purified water is a very different resource, and is only available via purifying machines or by finding the odd canister in the world.
---
Dirty water is freely available from almost any body of water, has no value other than consumption, and is required in larger quantities due to the need to boil it.
---
One has a tangible reward the other is simply aesthetic, I would call the walls a visual glitch, not an exploit to gain an unfair advantage. There is no advantage to having interior walls by stacking them. It is only aesthetic and not a tangible advantage.
---
*”Finding it... that’s not the hard part.*
---
*It’s letting go.”*
---
I think I the individual rewards are completely worthless but it would feel bad to miss the first very easy goal so I only donated 3k steel. I only had 1st for one month and stocked away 24k during that time and don't plan to ever re-up so I did not take any from there. But I have 2 characters that were overencumbered with excess steel from normal gameplay so they donated to the cause. I was too lazy to farm lead to make it into ammo or try to trade it and I never need caps so selling wasn't really an option either. Didn't do any specific farming but just dumped current excess for space. 
---
Now when we start to get to materials I actually need or want I will likely skip.
---
As a 2 day old player to this game, I was wondering why some camps wall paper was set up all fucked up, now I know. Thank you.
---
I think it was, but one patch changed that I guess. At least for me its running unlimited out of the box and I read something about it online
---
100% but, make a post about it and the Beth people come flying over assuring how they are banning that person. In no way is Beth addressing the real NW problem
---
Looks like we already know how many devs are working in FO76. 2 or 3. And none of them plays the game.
---
You are grossly missing the point here.
---
For the mask, the point is that by paying one could skip the Fasnacht grind for rare masks, since those were supposed to be rare, but now everyone can own a retexture of it at the price of 500 atoms. It kind of defeats the purpose of having the thing have a 1% drop rate for the best completition. Quite literally an advantage. Only if you got the mask you should have been able to change its color, in order to remain in the purely cosmetic promise.
---
The Underarmor and the Camo underarmor have linings, so they do have effects. The camo SS doesn't even work, and even if it did, it uses the wrong linings. It should have been either only unlockable after buying the regular underarmor plan, and still use the SS linings, or better simply be applied to the original object as a paint, instead of having to waste duble the flux just because the cosmetic item is its own thing and not a paint appliable to the original object.
---
Zenimax Online team couldn't do this to begin with. ESO is running on Unreal Engine, which was a sane choice. FO76 and its Creation Engine... Let's just say only select and completely demented masochists work with it. 
---
What they could've done is learned about the importance of good support and communication. But they didn't, so here we are.
---
Camp changes kinda suck. I don't think any of the camp hijinks are giving people a competitive advantage or anything silly like that.
---
I still can't show off my Captain Cosmos game board either.
---
I'd like to hear how you're getting 4000 steel out of Death Tambos, pipe weapons, combat rifles, and maybe the occasional assault rifle. 
---
Even with the scrapper perk, maybe 700-800 steel if you're lucky, but 4000? Maybe a bit of an exaggeration, you think?
---
Way more people are estimated to play across platforms. Last number I saw was something like 400k current players. The vast majority of those were console.
---
Just put your camp where enemies don't spawn to avoid this.I don't use turrets(no wasted budget) because nothing can spawn where I camp.
---
&gt; But 1. Gold bullion was designed to make players go out of their way to  slowly grind for treasury notes only to turn in 200 a day. Now imagine  if a person with a job wanted to get T65 power armor. And can't get on  each day. How long will that take? 
---
Good thing T-45, T-51,T-60 spawn in the game world and after a quest you can create Excavator, Ultracite and X-01 PA to take it's place while you get it. That said for me at least I've rarely ever hit or surpassed the 200 a day cap.  Really it has only been during the legendary run thing that I have actually started to reach it. Or even surpass it by 10-40 bullion.  And even that has been reduced since I figured out the level up challenges is far easier to do by making a throw away account and getting to level 5 and then deleting and starting over.

---
&gt; 1/128 chance then a 1/4 chance to obtain a Godsword hilt (if you fail the 1/4 you'll get 19,501-21,000 coins instead) 
---
Yea that shit I'm well use to by playing an actual MMORPG.  I've killed that boss at least 1,000 times and never got a hilt.
---
&gt; The season pass IS free content. Yes. But when most of all apparel is  glitched out or broken it shows how Bethesda really doesn't care too  much. And they replaced the free atoms with SCORE. Which pretty much  sucks. We were making so much atoms back then. Now we really have to pay  to get the new Atomic shop items. 
---
Not had glitches for any of the stuff I've been using. The only glitch I'm aware of was one with the cameo with large guns. The free atoms are replaced with Store that in turn give free cosmetics. At least during the duration of the event.  
---
Once the event is over and they do not revert it to atoms then you would have a point. 
---
&gt; And 3. The ATLAS provisions have nothing of value inside them. I  understand if its not gonna be amazing but at least make an effort. Like  maybe a backpack skin or a new BOS outfit. Something small and simple  that will make donating your hard earned materials worth it. 
---
Junk isn't hard to get. I literally had 2k worth of steal that just build up in my stash because I wasn't paying attention.  That is gone now donated and turned into 5.56 ammo. In fact at least once a week I normally purge my stash of all the usless extra junk I have. Were at least now I have some place I can deposit it to get rid of it.  
---
Getting junk takes no effort. That is like asking for a legendary weapon just for logging into the game.  The real rewards of the community events if we reach the goal.
---
Precisely!  I can see how 1,000 different hunting rifles might cause issues, but not the number of wood scraps I have.
---
lol boycotts..
---
there is Zero chance every reward offered is not unlocked every time they do an event like this...
---
The game was rigged from the start...
---
The problem is that you're not comparing apples with apples.
---
Duping is an exploit yes but the spirit of it is negative for the game as it gives dupers an unfair advantage over those that don't dupe plus it messes stuff like economy or bypasses rarity rng etc.
---
The building "exploit" on the other hand doesn't work the same way. The camp budget exploits of the past could be classified the same as the duping exploit because you're getting more than what you should, once again, over those that don't.
---
What do you get with the double-wall exploit? The ability to have wallpaper on both sides of your wall? That's your exploit? Seriously?
---
It's the same with the rug glitch. You're not gaining extra budget or better abilities or more advantages. All it does is allow items that would not normally be allowed to exist in the same space to do so. That's it.
---
You're still spending the same budget if your glitched the walls or didn't. Actually, from a certain point of view it's a disadvantage because you're spending more budget to have wall paper on the other side of it.
---
It'd a dumb thing to "fix", especially given all the most serious and more pressing issues that should have been fixed before that. Even if they do fix it (fair enough), you'd think they'd at least wait until they implemented double interior walls, the whole reason why the double-wall glitch is used in the first place, before "fixing" the issue.
---
But then, that'd be the smart thing to do.
---
If aesthetics is your endgame, and you wish to 'compete' with others based on camp aesthetics, is that not an advantage?  
---
You do not get to decide what is an advantage and what isn't when there are so many ways to play a game.
---
I noticed in my effects tab it would be the full negative -4 strength on bird bones etc, but when I unequipped and equipped class freak again it went back to being -1. Im guessing that's visual.
---
"CP will be forgotten" like ongoing sales of TW3 didn't boost CDPR (still technically an indie studio, mind you) to be the second most valuable European game studio behind only Ubisoft earlier THIS YEAR. 
---
GTFOH.
---
We are not. They are lying about it so nobody notices the fiasco they made.
---
See, right there. Bughesda. Stuff like that. That's immature. And it's negative. 
---
You are soaked in the whole hate culture, you can't see it. And Bughesda is not even the harshest. 
---
And you justify what you say and do because other approve when you do, making you feel like you belong. While driving those who disagree out.
---
I just wish my ally would put his clothes back on, nobody wants to see an old man in his undies.
---
Yeah, that one I know but this wasn't a mag transfer glitch. That's why its so odd.
---
I love how he has an emotional response calling people stupid and lazy, and then tries to act all intellectual by asking for sources LoL
---
There clearly is a mix of purely cosmetic items, and ones with utility. Some with great utility like the Collectron. Some people would draw a conclusion that the rain barrel might have similar benefits. The post is more about reminding people the store is cosmetic (which I had honestly forgot) and to set proper expectations. Don't let yourself get drawn into an argument with someone derailing the topic and trolling.
---
crazy. i hit almost every shot with vats. Glad im not having that issue lol.
---
Xbox..I see where this was going so I appreciate the gesture for real.!
---
this.. or.. worst case scenario..
---
"aww you guys got so close and tried so hard we are going to unlock it all anyways.."
---
I’d lean to this answer as well.  I think we can tell BS numbers when it comes to cork.  I’m a hoarder, checked all my characters and have about 100k steel total.  Cork?  Not even 5k, and they’ll pry that from my cold dead hands even if the rewards were decent.  The rewards are just plain awful from the turn in packages.  2-3 new BoS items from the packages and people would be doing this happily.  Nothing new?  A big why bother.
---
Uhh I turned in a total of 32,250 yesterday. I did it for the hat the box was just a whatever. Never did see a "rare" plan though. Granted I don't know what they count as rare versus what I count as rare.
---
I'm guessing you haven't donated much or any steel?
---
You still here?
---
Turned an under armor into an outfit (BoS fatigues). Totally “poofed” quite a few people’s sheilded linings. 
---
Broke Tesla rifles in all sorts of weird ways.
---
Apparently broke a number of quests (haven’t run in to this personally, but they seem to be story quests and I’ve done all those)
---
Managed to make bows even worse than they were at launch.
---
Fucked up a bunch of building tricks (not just walls) even though they just had a community event highlighting all the cool unique CAMPS... that were only possible with said tricks.
---
Managed to fuck up the ammo converter instead of improving it (I’m calling this one a side-grade, though)
---
That’s just off the top of the head while I’m working. I’m sure I can find more going back through the subreddit. 
---
On top of that several things they claim to have done in the patch notes (deep pockets for SS; ward staying put, for like the 3rd patch notes now) clearly have not been done.
---
lol here I am at level 10 starting 2 days ago and was wondering the same thing, among others, I still think it's an awesome game but I'm guessing that will wear off, then again I've been playing Bethesda games since Morrowind dropped and well, I can say pretty damn confidently from experience, bugs are Bethesdas specialty, fixing them is a complete different beast. I only paid 6 dollars for the game (and 4 dollars for fallout 4 at the same time) so that might also have an effect on my opinion.
---
Agree let's give those hotels what for! Down with the hostels 😂 whouldnt want them to be more hostile
---
Lets see those sale numbers in the 5th year, shall we?
---
The outfits are crafted at an armor bench and the tent is by opening the favorites wheel and pressing Y iirc...assuming youre on xbox
---
Don't stay and expect a developer to change things to keep you. If enough people leave they will change things to bring you back.
---
It certainly isn't unwanted. And it just seems like you are trying to ruffle things up. Why do you get involved if you don't care. And if they have motives they could keep putting dev notes behind patches like they did to explain to the very interested community why they are doing things. Yeah you are getting down votes because people disagree with you, isn't that the whole part of the up vote down vote thing? what do you expect, a lot of up votes on a post that is complaining about this ? doesn't make your opinion in valid, but that's just how it is. If i go posting in religious Reddit abut atheism im going to get down voted.
---
I've noticed that it doesn't register that I have class freak 3 on. So each time I log on, I have to remove the perk and add it again. I never had to do that before yesterdays update
---
Just huck them at Russell to lighten the load.
---
Oh no, don't give up your goodies for that trash.
---
Im keeping my steel for shure need bullets more than old plans
---
i understood it that way: you bought a modded (aka already used) weapon from a player vendor and changed something, then you realized that it had a 500mag.   
---
i assume the previous owner bugged it before selling it, and you just noticed it after modding and testing the weapon. or did you shoot it before you modded it?
---
why are you grinding this?
---
just play your regular game and if you get some steel.. donate it
---
the individual rewards are supposedly shit anyway right?
---
It is 100% filler chore b.s.
---
Yup. Welcome to what Bethesda considers content.
---
Based on your refusal to address any of my points as well as assuming your world view is the only possible one and that you know more about this then you really do. This is more a fact.
---
Turbo fert helped me make lots of adhesive when i needed it.  It might not be the first choice.  But making bulk chems, adhesive and other junk.  It really helps.
---
I agree with you to a certain extent- but apparently the double-wall exploit can cause performance issues (according to other posts on here), which was their reason for removal.
---
You might not necessarily get an advantage other than aesthetically, but if my game crashes because of your camp, that's a negative, no?
---
As a software developer, I can understand the need to avoid causing more issues. I find it very hard to believe that VATS is top priority after reading the patch notes and seeing all the issues caused by the latest patch.
---
It’s not selfish, it’s smart. I don’t owe anyone my steel.
---
The problem I have is, if I miss something (legendary run) then I'm no longer interested in the game cause I'm miss content XD that I may never get
---
&gt; A dude took my workshop
---
'nuff said
---
Gamma rounds ARE useful,my b ffr automatic gamma gun works with rifleman perks for some reason and it makes short work of ammo thieves.
---
This has been threatened since the canvas bag "thing". FO76 is still here.
---
Don't waste your money. It's really really not worth it lol
---
It varies but yesterday I got 2700 steel alone running it once. It was glitched so they all spawned in the middle though and I used a quad tesla. and scrapping so many assault rifles and grenade launchers. I believe that level decides what weopon they drop and your luck determines their condition (maybe more scrap from over repaired weapons. I was 1000lbs owerweight if that is any kind of indicater.
---
People gotta be real dumb to dupe steel. With less than a month of 1st (first and last month) I had like 50k legit steel. I even dropped some at Atlas but no way Brotherhood is gonna get my cork with those lame rewards they're  throwing.
---
You know that you have a counter to this that doesn't involve posting on reddit, right?
---
Just report them, block them and move on. I mean still post if you want to but reporting them if your way of actively dealing with the issue.
---
Oh, I'm sorry.. I don't know their names so I just thought others complained and discussed it with each other. I know there's the contact support for Bethesda I may be an adult but I don't mess with much and can be ignorant.
---
I don't want FO76 to fail, I love this game, this franchise, but I so want to see this BOSA material drive fail so hard to send them a message. It would be the laughing stock of gaming history.
---
I posted about this before, the pop up notifications of score seem to be popping up randomly later than you got them. Keeps happening to me when I exit power armor - I know you said you don't use it, I'm still sure you already got the score it just didn't give you the notifications til later on. It's pretty confusing.
---
None of this IMO warrants the outrage. You’d think they committed murder by some of these comments.
---
The BOS underarmor will be fixed. It’s clearly a bug. Hopefully mods are restored.
---
Nothing is permanent.
---
I think those of us missing some plans will have better luck with player vending and the random suitcase find.
---
Lucky you then. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
THIS! I've been saying the doorway "fix" is a cynical attempt to force people to buy the craptastic prefabs they're shoveling into the Atom Shop at record speed. I'd hate them a whole lot less if they were standard sized and the foundations actually snapped to existing foundations!!!
---
ESO even just the normal non DLC part is amazing. It is a massive world with countless hours of gameplay in it. 
---
If you get the subscription there you get the DLC with it (although I think you get it a couple months later than those who just buy it) and as far as I know when you buy a new DLC you get all the DLC that came before it.
---
I really enjoy that game...I think if F76 could have had half of what ESO has going for it, it would have been a much better game. I've had a lot of hours of play and I've barely scratch the surface of it having completed the main quest (but not the ton of side quests) in only one or two of the dozen or more areas...never mind the overall main questlines.
---
Pa Heavy or stealth commando are the 2 current metas
---
If your on PC, the tent is located on the weapons wheel, lower corner.
---
Same, on Xbox
---
It has the most optimal mods that I can apply to it for damage and other factors.
---
Does this “fix” the glitch that allowed foundation-less buildings? ie...using the roof to hang walls of of it.
---
&gt; It wouldn't matter if people boycotted
---
Exactly...which is why making threads calling for the boycott of the event are super stoopid thinly veiled karma farming attempts...
---
I'm not here for advice I'm a higher level player than you and I know fully how to play the game my argument is the constant grind and cash grab has now become to much
---
No worries. If anything, contacting support has proven to be useless as those tickets seem to be getting routed the same way the suggestions and bug reports do - straight into the void.
---
I just wish they would say that.  A percentage of the problem is not knowing.  Simple, "We took the ability away but are providing building pieces that will allow construction in the future, etc, etc." Radio silence is not helping.  Taking away the ability to use the glitch to build and not offering a real method is just like delaying Wastelanders and still offering FO 1st.  Right?  They don't learn, because it can't be double sided walls will hurt performance, they would have told us by now, LOL!
---
I didn't test it out until after I modded it, but I didn't know the mag transfer glitch worked between players. Very interesting indeed
---
Yeah, even raiders are way nicer. This is why I stopped doing his dailies, for now at least. He annoys the hell out of me
---
More like the Brotherhood of "Steal"...
---
So they want all the Steel from your inventory for I'm guessing a worthless beret?  And yall buying this hook line and sinker lmao
---
You know it probably has no bonus effect right;)
---
Yes, steel is prevalent, not arguing that point. I can get a ton of it by doing Uranium Fever, or Harpers Ferry, but I'm still not willing to throw anymore at Atlas for zero benefit.
---
I used specific pieces to avoid that.
---
-the marine RL has +int and is buttressed. neither affect sneak. ultra-light does, supposedly. but only when moving and I was stationary for this test.
---
-the wood RA has +luck, which also has no effect on sneak. shrouded does, being the equivalent of a shadowed piece. but it doesn't work at the moment.
---
-same applies for the wood LL and LA, only difference being they have disease resistance and +int instead.
---
they're also all unyielding but my health is at 100%. more importantly, if any of the pieces were actually affecting my sneak, at all, then the bar would move. but it doesn't.
---
If only you realized it's all the legitimate players quitting and not the dupers because this game encourage cheating and punishes legitimate players
---
This needs to happen non stop on all servers.
---
What we have here...is...a failure to communicate.
---
Simple thing, modders usually play the game and want to better their own experience too.
---
A Bethesda dev probably doesn't even come from the 'gaming' sector and are just there for their monthly salary while not giving a single fuck about what their monthly line of code actually produces at the end.
---
It is a chore.  It's a lot of work collecting that much steel and you get pretty much nothing in return.
---
Is that a.. work around? No worries it will be fixed next patch so you can’t do it anymore!
---
It's ridiculous. I can make an entirely free floating building, but I can't place an object or relocate my building ***ON THE GROUND*** because the structure is floating?
---
(ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻
---
The meta players and builders are entirely different communities. How's it feel knowing you'll never have a good enough weapon OR a good enough C.A.M.P.?
---
Out of curiousity what kind of numbers are you dealing in combat? Right now I am getting 230 per hit, but from what I have seen from other players they are doing a lot more even without stealth or VATS.
---
So, make people who are satisfied with Fallout 1st drop it just so it can please another group of people ? Good luck with that.
---
Dude, just stop trying to have fun in this game. It is too hard
---
I think sneak commando is The best when youre alone. When the enemie is in combat with anything the sneak bonuses does not count. So overall i think heavy Guns are the best. Since they often has very high firerate the dps Will be higher than with slowfiring/hardhitting weapons generally
---
Hands down this and the scrapbox are the best reasons to purchase it
---
uh oh you're going to rile up the hundreds of weird enclave LARPers
---
Tent is on your weapon hot wheel, hit triangle on ps4.
---
Outfits can be crafted on the armor bench.
---
The Raiders / settlers expansion IS wastelanders, but there is also a bundle(s)you can only buy with real cash that gives you ingame raider/settler cosmetic overrides that you can buy in the store.
---
Not to mention that, utility-wise, the double SCORE weekend was garbage compared to the Double XP weekend before it. I got WAY more board progress during the 2XP weekend. Double SCORE weekend advancement was pitiful.
---
Call of the void. They get to return to the void they once came from....nah its probably cause you made them fat in junk.
---
Cancelled FO 1st last night, I'm not feeding this broken machine.
---
these statistic numbers bethesda releases, are always going to make bethesda look good, and that the playerbase is active. there is ZERO fuckin chance that they would public post that they couldn't even garner enough interest for people to do even the simplest junk donating event.
---
there is also ZERO fuckin chance that we dont get the rewards either, especially with everyone pissed off about one thing or another in this patch.
---
that being said, i could see this first challenge getting completed legit, with how easy steel is to get, and a higher percentage of people who haven't figured out the rewards are bull. but if we pass the cork one, i call bullshit, that or a mega duper dumped some of their cork reserves lol.
---
Yup, that's gone 🙃
---
I don't personally believe one build is better than another but really depends on the situation.  Like commando is great only of you're alone but heavy is great for teams although they do well solo too. 
---
Heavy gunner- Large Dps,  tankiest build. Very expensive to feed
---
Sneak ranged- More dps than heavy, but must be alone and is very delicate.
---
I'm not soaked in no hate culture. I'm just an realist who is highly critical about major issues the game has, what you obviously are not. You are the real issue here. You close your eyes and take all the BS they stuff down your throat, and thank them for it. Even if the game would be considered to be in beta stage by any other gaming company there is.
---
1000% correct!  Proves the disconnect between all parties related to this game even more.
---
Been playing Bethesda Games since Morrowind dropped on the Original Xbox. I can confidently say after all these years, and span of many titles, Bethesda specializes in bugs. Just not fixing bugs.
---
Source: Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout 3, Fallout 4. 
---
Havent experience enough Fallout 76 yet to have complaints, and if I do I have to remember I spent 6 bucks for the game, and got Fallout 4 at the same time for 4 dollars, so that's where I'm at.
---
Also please note I left New Vegas out of that list, as Bethesda had no hand in that, and sadly it's hard to admit that another game company took one of Bethesdas main games and released quite possibly the best title in the series.
---
One day I'll have kids, then theyll have kids, and when those grandkids are playing Skyrim The Ultimate, Final, Remastered, Ultra,re-re-re release because we still hadn't gotten The Elderscrolls 6 and Bethesda wants to keep making money by kicking a dead horse I'll be sure to tell them the story of Bethesda.
---
Raiders and Settlers packs aren't expansions they're cosmetic bundles that were added with wastelanders. Wastelanders was a free update for everyone.
---
The rewards are as one would expect, absolute trash.
---
Well.. Is there a way to in a sense protest somewhere much more openly like Twitter?
---
sure, you can drop the weapon, log out or anything.  
---
the only thing to fix it is either empty the whole mag or drop all ammo.
---
Ive been bringing this up ever since wastelanders dropped only to be ignored every time.
---
Its driving me mad. That and fast travel constantly failing.
---
What have I experienced recently before and after 21...
---
* Many times XP is not indicating it is being awarded when it should be (people in these comments have mentioned several situations already)
---
* SCORE is not awarded while you're in power armor (wtf?!), once I disembarked from my PA I got a bunch of SCORE notifications
---
* Hotkeys like Q (VATS), - (my Stimpak key) and 0 (my food key) intermittently not responding, have to be spammed to make work
---
* PA fusion cores being used up at an incredible rate suddenly? Had 6 going into a SBQ fight, ended the fight with the "low power, exit your armor" message with 0 cores left
---
* The fix to the ammo exchange machine causes the machine to not 'hide' options that weren't available to you - for example if I only had 16 of one type of ammo and needed 18 to submit for Ammo Points, that option would not be on the menu. Now all options are listed and you only find out after trying to cash in 100 (or more) of an ammo type that you can't do it.
---
* VATS as mentioned by many others does not match its percentages up to the likelihood you will hit. Even with VATS showing 95%, likelihood is closer to 25% or lower that you will hit.
---
* Big guns (50 cal) initiating a reload with anywhere up to 80 rounds remaining in the mag.
---
I'm sure there are more that I'm forgetting or haven't experienced yet.
---
But thank God we fixed that goddamn photo mode frame.
---
This isn't even counting everything with the ammo converter either. I waited for this patch to use it because the first version of it was so bad.
---
This one... Isn't much better.
---
Sent a dm
---
Alcohol, stimpaks, grenades and radaway.
---
Al extremely useful for a teetotal mutant who can heal themselves with healing factor and sunlight, who's aim is so bad they sell more grenades than they ever use. I guess at least I'll get a few caps.
---
Just place the clean sink in your camp. Aim at the drain. Hit "DRINK" AS the water is running into the drain spam the "COLLECT" button. Can get about 15 dirty water per drink/collect. About 5 to 10 seconds.
---
Downside: catch a few diseases. I got the thirst quenched card and equip it every time I'm cooking Razer soup.Also learned how to farm for some disease cure ingredient through a YouTube video. To clear any I do catch.
---
Not trying to be a smartass. -m-'
---
Why does anyone still play this game? It's been nothing but one screw up after another. It's never once been in a stable state without one major issue or another. Bethesda has repeatedly lied to their player base. 
---
"I canceled my subscription" - this has been going on long before subscriptions were even a thing. Why did you subscribe to begin with? 
---
I just don't get it. I tried to like this game, I really did, but I have zero interest in supporting a company that has no passion for their product or consumers. It's a cash grab, plain and simple.
---
Was just coming here to post this.  Tried to move my weapon boards and they sink into walls instead.  All red.  Very sad.
---
I saw the note. It isn't clear that it's the double-wall issue that it's talking about.
---
Even if it were, we pay for that performance hit with budget. That's the whole point of the camp budget system - to manage camp performance issues.
---
&gt; You might not necessarily get an advantage other than aesthetically, but if my game crashes because of your camp, that's a negative, no? 
---
While I would normally agree with the point you're making here, the problem is context. 
---
The double-wall thing isn't new. People have known about this since very early on with the game. It wasn't an apparent performance issue back then, so why is it now?
---
If I were to hazard a guess, it was low hanging fruit for a lazy dev who needed to make their bug fixing quota. That to me makes more sense than it being enough of a performance issue that it needed to be addressed now.
---
Like I said, if it needed to be addressed, you'd think as not even a smart person that "oh, they're doing this for a reason. maybe we should fulfil that need and address the issue at the same time".
---
Where did you see that number? It seems unlikely. Perhaps that’s closer to the number of copies sold this year but it’s a safe bet that at least half the current f76 fan base on pc is running it through steam and that capped out at 32k in may/June. Now it’s at 9k. I couldn’t see it being much higher than 100k, but even then that seems like a lot given the steep decline. Only thing that could have made that number grow was gamepass, but that’s a temporary boost and those players probably wouldn’t be able to contribute much to alter the event donations by more than a couple million.
---
That's fine and all, but that's not what people are angry about. This is like saying all lives matter and ignoring the ones on fire
---
Maybe this is secretly the colossal problem event 😂
---
You pressed "revenge" instead of "respawn". Rookie mistake.
---
lmao
---
Wow!!! Glad I finished Wastelanders on my 3 alts!!!
---
all good mate
---
I mean as someone with addictive personality tendencies, I don't blame the design I blame myself for being infantile and dumb to want something repetitous and instantly gratifying to placate the stress that comes from otherwise difficult things that are delayed gratification in life. If that makes any sense.
---
If enough upvote it, it becomes a community issue.
---
Reddit.
---
What’s the best way to pump up my defense for those weapons then?
---
&gt;This game is falling into the same hole that destiny did, time gating exhausts the players drive to play. This game will loose majority of the playerbase as more vets aquire everything they want and get over the legendary run
---
Honestly, I think they're just doing gating *wrong*.  Look at EVE Online's character progression, by comparison; it's a hard time-gate.  To learn a new skill takes X time, whether that's minutes, days, or weeks.  But, and here's the important part; you just pick the ability to work on next and let it run, and *then you play the game*, and nothing about playing contributes to that time-gate.
---
Where Destiny and games like FO76 run short is because their time-gates are weekly *caps*, on elements of gameplay.  Do events!  But not too many events, because now you're capped and can't turn more treasury notes in.  Find legendary loot! But not too much.  Can only turn in 150 scrip a day.  It puts a hard limit on *how much you should play.*  That's what chafes people.  It effectively penalizes you for enjoying the game *too much*.
---
Unhitch the time-gates from gameplay.  If you got your 200 Bullion from doing the daily quest for either Raiders or Settlers, and they eliminated treasury notes entirely, I don't think it would be as problematic (for instance).  You got your 200 daily Bullion, the gate is the same, but you can't stack up thousands of treasury notes that you effectively can't ever turn in, and which will bug you every time you trade your 20 notes in every day.
---
Reminders you could play and unlock *more* incentivize play.  These kinds of reminders that you've played *too much* disincentivize play, for the same reason.
---
I’ve never duped. I’ve never traded with another player for a weapon. I don’t like the player trading mechanic.
---
Whilst there is an element of random luck as to which weapon you get there is also grind to improve your chances. The progression of the more events you complete, the more legendary items you pick up the more Script you can gather, the more chances you have at the rusty pick. It’s the main progression of the game. Most players have played for months, managing their resources, their weight, upgrading weapons, grinding for plans. Duper’s undermine all of that. 
---
My progression is “honest” I refuse to believe that most people dupe. What is more likely is that you just don’t like the grind and so you are trying to justify cheating. Nobody likes the grind, the sense of achievement is getting through that repetition to garner decent weapons, farming materials to obtain enough ammo. Duping and the spread of duped materials diminishes that achievement of others. Whereas a two sided wall does not impact other players to anywhere near the same degree.
---
As to motives for duping? Most games in life are “easier” if you break the rules, that’s why there are rules. Duping is done by people who don’t want to grind, the game is firmly based on the grind, therefore duping is cheating. 
---
We could all do it, but that’s not the game! The same reason we don’t break the 100m world record sprint by using a motor bike.
---
reddit is a fraction of the 76 community..
---
you know that right?
---
I'm not sure if it's still a eunning thing. First time gamepass users would get a $1 gamepass trial.
---
I'm also having trouble collecting scorchbeast DNA samples for "Heart of the enemy" after the patch.  I'm on PS4 the option is still there but when I push the button noting happens.  I tried collecting molerat blood samples for "An ounce of prevention" on a new character and that wasn't working either.
---
The way the dupe worked it could take less than an hour to have hundreds of thousands. If you’re risking your account to dupe fixers, night as well risk it duping everything else as well.
---
Better late than never
---
You don't get rads from that? Hmmm? Maybe it is worth the gold?
---
they are going to give the rewards anyway, nothing we do will matter.
---
whatever it takes to get ya through the day yo..
---
Good. My friend just bought fo1st right before I told him this. Now. I. Cry.
---
The "rewards" are just a bonus, the real reward is completing the objective. Getting an "amazing" Beret for this first objective.
---
Really poorly thought out resource sink. I won't be making much effort with this event.
---
I subscribed when Wastelanders was released to show support for a game that seemed abandoned by the developers prior to that. Since nothing's been improved since then, I'm ending my support.
---
what were you expecting for rewards?
---
* Points at OP, "HA HA!"
---
There there edgelord. Sempai will notice you some day.
---
Feel like it should end up like the credits of a Monty Python film...something like:
---
Todd: We apologise for the bugs and difficulties in the original game release. Those responsible have been sacked.
---
Todd: We apologise again for the fault in the bugs and difficulties in Watelanders. Those responsible for sacking the people who have just been sacked have been sacked.
---
Because if it's not obvious by now, there's like 3 guys working on the game.
---
I had a ton of steel (50K) so i turned in enough for about 60 Provisions. (wanted to do my part) out of the 60 provisions i opened i only got about 8-9 plan drops. So not only are the plan rewards bad but they have low drop chances on top of that.
---
"Such a buggy place"
---
agreed, they were pretty bad. I feel the only cool stuff you can get is via the Atomic shop, which I spend my free credits whenever I can.
---
1. A shared stash for all your characters
---
1. Improve camp building
---
1. Remove daily script limit.
---
What I don't understand is why they are pushing new content and setting new deadlines (their roadmap) instead of just taking a break from making new stuff and spend that time to fix what's already in the game.
---
I wouldn't complain if they postponed everything for an extra month if they would spend that time to fix long lasting bugs that makes the game feel like it's still in beta.
---
[Look at this freaking list!](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i3gegy/an_updated_list_of_weaponrelated_issues_still_in/) And it's only about weapons ... 
---
Like they say in France : "Mettre de la chantilly sur de la merde la rendra présentable mais ça restera de la merde" (Adding whiped cream on a pile of shit will make it look better but it's still a pile of shit)
---
Using a glitch to build double-sided or floating wall is in which world "legit"?
---
Precisely.
---
Same. It's the only thing I want from the bundle, I'd have bought it separately.
---
Wow, yeah, that’s exactly what I’m experiencing. I assumed that it was something I was doing wrong, but yeah, you’d think a 95% would hit more often
---
+1
---
You ABSOLUTELY proved his point with this comment. Newsflash, Bethesda has been making these exact same mistakes for 4-5 games. There are people who are going to be outspoken and negative, such as yourself, and there are people who just want to talk about and play the game.    
---
I am quite in the middle of this whole situation, because I am on this subreddit and I do know what each of the patches and updates do, but I also enjoy the grind of this game, so I don't necessarily have to enjoy all the new content to enjoy the game.
---
How much you want to bet they added everything to the game and just forgot to add the plans to Regs' vendor list.
---
How about the drinking fountain ? Does it work like fountains found in abandoned buildings (i.e each press collects water) ?
---
Ok, but one is literally cheating to obtain something without working for it, or trying for it at least, and the other is a glitch that allows you to build a certain way, but gain nothing without serious work. Simplified: no work vs. work.
---
I can't enter either. PC player btw.
---
yet again. not the first patch acting against the users.
---
Yepp, same reason reddit boycotts hardly ever pan out.
---
Squeaky wheel still generally gets the grease.
---
uh huh
---
I had my amount of experience with  individuals try instigate unwanted Pvp. Since day one. Jumping in front of my shots, Melee me to see if my mutations start PvP. Car explosions, bait mines, kill Brahmin and traps. I ignore, emote and walk away. Now if they persist or use strong language. I note their name, block and server hop. Never having to deal with them again.
---
Then stop playing. If you want good content then you need to speak with your wallet and with your time.
---
Yeah, the issue isn’t 2 walls. The issue is instead of having 28 walls, people had 56 walls I can only imagine what rendering that in would do to the server load when it has to read that there are 2 walls in the same spot 56 times (or more)
---
I’m missing a load of wallpapers since installing the most recent patch, is this a bug?
---
It depends on the armor, sometimes it lowers almost the entire weight of the limb, and Ultra light helps wither you're wearing it or not where deep pocketed makes the armor heavier, occasionally wiping out that 10 carry weight by itself!
---
Building in FO4 wasn't nearly as fun for me because there was nobody to share it with.
---
Servers been crashing a lot.
---
You just go to Morgantown airport.
---
“Working tirelessly”
---
I donated 10k steel thinking there would be some decent rewards, after learning it's all crap I won't be donating anything else.
---
very much this. 
---
💩💩💩💩💩
---
I  wish they had i believe it was the Maryland studio which helped them work on wastelanders bc then maybe bugs would be fixed quicker and probably better updates
---
unequip gun-fu.
---
now we can finally play the game
---
I suspect postponing the content for 2 weeks will likely make very little difference to bugs/ issues etc.
---
the patch notes did say it was fixed, but who knows any more.
---
That's very possible. I used VATS a lot with my old melee and with the new unarmed guy it seems to happen when I'm punching fast in mobs. I was thinking it might be tied to SB or the missile launchers in the Bog, because it's happened to me only in the those surface to air events recently. Wasn't paying great attention though, mostly just trying to quickly quit.
---
I’d take the three points of evasive out of agility and put it towards bloodied mess. Youre a bloodied build?
---
Same on PC
---
Thank you for this
---
There's a few things I can say about this build but first what is your Damage Resistance and Energy Resistance?
---
hur hur neckbearders. classic. What an absolute zinger. brilliant. 10/10 would read again
---
My comment was about getting cloth. 
---
For steel, I like Line in the Sand too.
---
Yup.  Though... I DO have a canvas bag now!
---
I wish i could donate all my fertilizer to let them know how shit this event is
---
yes, but it looks ok and thats the point.
---
I was wondering if the FPS hit I saw at Line in the Sand last night was a one-off, or some new bug.  Of COURSE it was a new bug...
---
I haven't bought that one. I'll wait to hear others' experiences before spending the atoms.
---
Huh, ok then. Thanks for clarifying!
---
i imagine an adderalled horde of nervous bitter pale people, slightly twitchy, nervous, yet sad
---
[edit: Nervous x2]
---
depending on your gear and mutations.. you should be gibing pretty much everything you come across...
---
if youre going to be bloodied.. you should have adrenal reaction mutation.. that is the glaring omission that comes right to my eye
---
curious what gear you have.. even in a non min/maxed state bloodied should be fairly OP
---
One guy in a photo booth!
---
It is annoying but just triple tap VATs.
---
Shared stash is a great one.
---
Who cares. 
---
Unless they act like other dev teams for other games where they directly respond to some community posts and nip problems in the bud asap to spare the community and themselves some headaches, who cares what some random person is in the dev team.
---
The only people I care about happen to be the ones that respond to the community - LadyDevann, Valseek and LoneVaultWanderer.
---
loop is just a backwards pool
---
"wow, sarcasm. That's original."
---
Dr. Horribles sing along blog. You should really watch it though
---
During the youtuber event, pre-beta, someone at Bethesda said that junk was weightless when scrapped. Then when the beta came, scrap suddenly had weight, for server stability they said. So much for server stability being the reason now that we have the scrap box.
---
Neither does bethesda
---
But if you're interested in modding theirs tons of helpful youtube videos that modders put out. I can try to find the one I watched of youre interested on armors and slot values. It kinda neat making the game the way you want it to be.
---
I would stop if I had the rep finished, but I still have like 2 weeks of it to go....
---
may i tell you bad news? the whole development process were like this. fo76 were never intended to exist in the first place, and they only had one year to make everything since someone wanted a quick cashcow to boost money into their next prestige projects and development on their engine to be fit for next gen.
---
Hahaha!  Gold!   When I logged in yesterday, I got the incoming nuke alert and actually laughed thinking someone had immediately nuked Atlas in protest!  Instead, they nuked the mine expecting to trigger the Wendigo C event.
---
usually if your first 95% is a miss, your next coiple of 95%ers are also misses. not sure if bug or feature.
---
Well, shit.  
---
I just started a new char a few hours before the patch.
---
The outrage is not misplaced: played at launch for 3 months and been playing since two weeks before wastlanders came out and I am bored in the game I have other games to play sure but fallout grabs me not in the trumpy way but in the man can't wait to sit down and relax and see what I can grind out today maybe I'll get lucky kind of way. There is nothing to grind for anymore and am at max caps and pretty much done everything rep wise possum wise and such I have a second character who is 101 and I just can't bring myself grind him out as well...some of you have been around way longer than me and I have no idea how you have stuck around so long with nothing to do that is love. So after all this if i have had enough after about 6 total months of play time about 1000 hours I am not even mad at ya and I will join in cancelling my subscription as well. A point needs to made like the point is being made out in the streets except we have to talk with our money not with signs and chanting.
---
(runs into traffic, screaming)
---
[edit: "Eaaaaaaaagllllllllle"]
---
How does a "good enough" camp look like?
---
5 bullet farms inside? 200 waterpurifieres placed? 
---
The most camps ar floating shitholes and if you want to build a perfect home go and play Sims... 
---
The perfect weapon is only to one similar build perfect... I love all the bloodies dying during the events and complaining about someone who launched the nuke not exact as they want causing them to not anticipate at this event because radiation is their enemy
---
Perfect weapon builds crying about a bit of radiation... My favorite ones...
---
ty, simple minded down voters taking over this thread sadly.
---
There's zero point in not allowing plans to be vendored. One of the many inconsistencies of the game.
---
I like it! And how about a quest to find plans for a trebuchet to "deliver" the fertilizer from a distance?
---
I give them my steel. It's delivered via Gatling Gun but it's the thought that counts.
---
&gt;Then it's kinda weird you made your previous post as a reply to me. I was just answering your question about reaching the cap. Stash limit is relevant to that discussion since it's one of the root causes of the problem.
---
How was it weird?  
---
1. Someone asked "There's limits on caps", 
---
2. the OP commented yes, 
---
3. I replied to him asking what he's doing to earn caps, 
---
4. you replied to me with how quickly you achieve your cap limit with vendors, 
---
5. I asked how raising the cap solves any issues
---
6. you went on to talking about the caps AND stash limits.  
---
You're the one that moved the whole conversation to the stash limit, it was never about stash limit from the first responses, and I've only been focusing on the caps aspect.  
---
Adding more caps to the vendor doesn't solve the root cause of the problem that there is nothing to use the caps on. d, if the atlas event was done right or we in general had more activities where we turn in supplies then multiple issues would be resolved.  
---
Adding more caps to the vendor doesan't solve the root cause of the problem i was addressing that there is nothing to use the caps on.  
---
&gt;Like I said, the caps themselves aren't important. In Fo4 they serve a normal purpose for a currency; you buy stuff you need. Fo4 doesn't have a universal caps pool for every trader in the world, and you're not limited in terms of storage.  
---
The entire thread was about the caps limits, it's the first idea that was recommennded by the OP. I disagree that the two issues are as tied together as you make them.  
---
But to go down that path, in FO4 you're not limited in terms or storage, but there's also no purpose in just hoarding items.  How many times have you finished a playthrough of FO4 (or again, any of the other ones) with stock piles of stuff you never used.  
---
Being able to endlessly hoard stuff isn't necessarily good game design, and it doesn't mean that implementing it here would solve any of the many player economy, lack of engaging content, or other issues this game faces. It's subjective to say that it would make the game more fun or balanced in the long run. 
---
&gt;At a certain point in 76 caps basically become a way to convert the progress you make into something you don't have to throw away to save inventory space. And you're even capped on the total caps you can hold.
---
Hoarding things isn't progress.  If you are saying "I ran Fort Defiance and now I have 46 surgical trays converted to aluminum, but no where to store the scrap and I can't sell anymore" you didn't make progress just because you couldn't store the stuff.  
---
Just because previous fallout games (and Elder Scrolls games) were hoarding simulators doesn't make that good game design that they should implement here. It serves even less purpose in a multiplayer game where players are encouraged to rely on each other. 
---
&gt;Legendary purveyor rolls *could* have been a caps sink, but they made scrip the currency for that and there's no direct conversion from caps to scrip (unless I'm forgetting something)  
---
&gt;Bullion *could* have been a caps sink, but Smiley is limited per week and, much like caps in every other game, there's not a whole lot worth buying after a while.
---
I don't disagree that they could have been made into caps sinks, I think there could have been "Better" cap sinks out there that would have been permanent.  Of course all the duping and everything has kinda made things suck anyways. 
---
&gt;All I'm really saying is the systems that 76 has actively prevent you from being able to just play the game.  
---
Log on daily. Do your chores. Come back tomorrow.
---
I guess it depends on the definition of what you consider playing the game, I do leave legendaries on the ground if it's crap and I've hit my scrip limit for  the day, I stop picking up most things once I've hit my caps from the vendor.  I still can continue to play if I'm not picking up everything off corpses or looting everything. I just make the tough choice of what to save.
---
This certainly needed to be a post.

If I place down a solid wall then try to use the conduit it turns red and says it is interfering with another object. I would have to place down the doorway, then place the conduit inside the doorway part of the wall, and then change the doorway into a solid wall. But since you cant just change a doorway into a solid wall anymore, I didn't know if any way to use the conduit.
---
/agree
---
Yeah my rep is far from finished too, but I just need some time away from Ward. He's always bitching about something and his "Finally, someone with the guts.." I swear I'd pull his guts if I could..
---
&gt;I really hope there are 800k+ active players, but the numbers I hear mostly for player population are in the 400k - 500k range.
---
That was just for the cork which is the highest requirement one for some reason. 200m vs 125M for others is a lot more breathing room. 
---
&gt;And  for Runescape events it didnt seem matter if you have lvl 1 skills or  99, everyone gathered at about the same rate and didnt have the stash  limitations 76 has.
---
Junk is just as piss easy to get. And since each specific scrap has it's own week it is very easy to only horde the scrap of the week.  This week I'm only gathering steel. So the lack of other resources minus what are needed for daily and weekly challenges gives me space for the steel scrap.  
---
On top of that I can't speak for everyone but my stash always has at least 50-100 lbs free.  yesterday was the first time in nearly 7 or 8 months that my stash box has been full.   
---
Then again I'm the person who hits max script amount. Buys as many 3 star range weapons as I can and then drops 80% of them if not slow walks to the nearest rail road and sells them. If I could change the level on them I would be dropping them to new players like a wasteland Santa giving everyone automatic weapons.
---
They want to enslave us to build them a base before they come. Sounds pretty fascist to me.
---
&gt; This game would be AMAZING if they just let you build anything anywhere and have full persistence
---
I'm not quite sure about that. I played ARK on official PVE servers and if there's no active moderators, most of the good places will end up being either griefed or privatised.
---
in F076 people arent interested in your base too. They run to your vendors and fast travel away. People posted youtube videos of their buildings in FO4 just like they do in F076. But in game, they have no meaning besides your vendors.
---
See that’s easy to claim I’m not concerned but your wrong. I’ve voiced my concerns. But I’ve got experienced in things like this. You clearly don’t.
---
For example. I was looking forward to the added SS mod plans. They didn’t make it into the game. I’ll probably have to wAit 2 weeks, when they update again. Unless they do a hot fix. 
---
Either way, eventually I’ll get them. The thing is, I’ll still be able to play and do all the things in game I like. 
---
The delay in A Colossal Problem. Same. I’ll just have to wait.
---
The build thing is my biggest concern. They really should of had seen this problem. They really should have. 
---
The event? There’s nothing wrong with it. It’s an easy simple thing to do, and no one is required to do it. Do it or don’t. It’s that simple. Doesn’t matter how little content or how much there is in any given game.
---
It’s not always going to appeal to everyone. There’s things in the game I don’t like. 
---
So no my eyes aren’t closed. I see exactly what you are.
---
Shotguns are underpowered. They're only good in some edge cases where you want mobs to be alive but crippled e.g. Radiation Rumble event.
---
You might be better off switching to something with more firepower but still can kind of leverage off your special distribution i.e. heavy build.
---
Comedy gold, OP.
---
How do you mean ? I've let it loop upto rank 100 thinking it would go away it just starts all over again from rank 1
---
Diffuse maps are separate from normal and specular maps. Diffuse only gives an object color and pattern, normal and specular handle things like wrinkles, definition, gloss, light, etcetera. So no, by creating a new diffuse map you won't end up with 'something out of roblox'. You'll end up with a set of military fatigues that have a different color / pattern.
---
The 'new textures' present in the 'new' cosmetics are just copied and pasted Brotherhood of steel logos and generic camouflage patterns, even if you opt to make them from scratch, it's not going to take you very long using a cloth texture filter on a BOS logo or urban camo pattern.
---
yes, you are correct. i've also heard you can be killed by radiation damage from certain guns with pacifist on
---
Agreed.  Either they should have added double walls, which were a legit use of this build quirk, or they should have fixed the actual exploit rather than disabling the functionality en masse.  So now you can't even do something basic like swap a window for a door.
---
This was a slapdash "fix" that was clearly born from the mind of someone who doesn't actually play the game or build CAMPs, or else they'd quickly realize how irritating it is.
---
Coming soon to the Atom Store only "*Double Sided Walls*"  
---
*Beth - see guys, we listened to the community!*
---
Yes back to score cycle and not leveling up to much so I lose points game...
---
Did the Secret Service limbs Deep Pockets mods need to be refined or were they forgot?
---
This morning I tried to launch the game and it still wasn't working. Thats when I went looking for a solution.
---
Man what a mess I'm glad I decided to take a break before I started hating the game.
---
Can you please explain to me what does legacy camp mean? I read the patch notes but since I haven't tried to change anything in my camp I don't quite understand what's going on. Is it about floating walls and floors?
---
Me neither since i haven't moved or expanded my camp  since the update.
---
If you keep dangling the promise of new content people will keep playing to prepare for it. Say there's a content drought coming and people won't stick around.
---
It does look pretty decent in my herbivore garden, that's true
---
This is a great idea, let us donate the shit baseball bat or rolling pin we got from the SBQ and let them scrap for building material just like we have to.  BoS may have seconds thoughts of coming to Appalachia.
---
I logged on last night to unusually long load screens, traveled to Atlas, dropped my tent to grab steel, got disconnected from sever, and turned off my PS4. I'd just completed the Legendary run the day before by buying the last five levels with Atoms because I was so sick of the stupid dailies. I'm in no mood with this game to log in every day just to give away my junk or take a photo of Paige, so, no, I won't be playing at my usual rate. Great time for a break. There's nothing to play for at this point.
---
You're right in that we've not got enough information to determine whether or not the double-wall thing is in fact, the cause of performance issues. But the fact is that they have claimed so as the reason for it's removal.   
---
I'm not so sure that they would have chosen this of all things as to reach their quota, however, as any person with the slightest idea of how the game is played could see this backfiring.  
---
But yes- at the root of it all, someone's been making some poor decisions recently.
---
Looks like you showed them /s
---
Cry some more. 😂
---
I'm one good week rest from the end you people are fucking crippled mentally
---
Can confirm, we would not. Not for all the vodka in the Wasteland. If you would be willing to sweeten the deal with, say, some rare plans.. well then we might consider it. ;)
---
As a Raider I approve of this message
---
This was possible because the devs who built wow from the ground up were still around and knew every nuance of the system.  It is becoming apparent that whomever is developing FO76 now is not who built the game originally and certainly the engine has been around for ages but adapted in completely different direction than originally designed.
---
&gt;You are grossly missing the point here.
---
No I am not. You said that they were not cosmetic. 
---
&gt; The Fasnacht masks are  their own mask, not a paint for the actual mask,  to give another  example, as are most of the outfits and dresses, even  when they are a  recolor of something else, like the camo SS underarmor. 
---
See your own words say that. So if the mask isn't cosmetic it must have an effect or provide some bonus that other masks in the game do not provide.  If the camo SS underarmor isn't cosmetic then it must have some ability that other under armor doesn't have.
---
&gt; For the mask, the point is that by paying one could skip the Fasnacht  grind for rare masks, since those were supposed to be rare, but now  everyone can own a retexture of it at the price of 500 atoms. 
---
Yes recolored which allows people to show off their genuine mask and the imitation one.  So the people who earned it the hard way still have a distinction. 
---
&gt; The Underarmor and the Camo underarmor have linings, so they do have  effects. The camo SS doesn't even work, and even if it did, it uses the  wrong linings. 
---
And are these linings unique and unable to re replicated by stuff in game?

Thanks for the reply. Not sure what’s going on tried restarting, but still not working. 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
What make u think that crybabies from reddit represent majority of playerbase
---
I don't know what their excuse is for that. I'm still on need of the muffled mod
---
yepp
---
This just reminds me of the fact that Bethesda is always so hung up on using the same dialogue for characters instead of letting them switch it up when they greet you. Like how hard would it be for Ward after a few times say "Hey, nice to see you helping again", and then after a bunch of times greet you with "Hey there, you know the routine, usual theft and all that, we know you will get it though."
---
Like damn, show some change in the characters. Even just a few pieces of dialogue make all the difference in the otherwise endless repetition.
---
95% chance mean 5% to miss get high perception and it will increase the roll ability of hitting that 95
---
Lmao true. There's bound to still be bugs but that's a given at this point
---
I wouldn't blame dev team.  
---
In most cases management decides task priority, unless there is a hard enough team/tech lead, who will force different priorities (and in most enterprise companies this is still impossible).  
---
And in most cases top management should be punished for those fuck ups.
---
Never noticed because third person is trash
---
Appreciated, the real problem is we shouldn't have to
---
Had to find some use for the excess Steel I had in my scrapbox that I'm not cancelling.
---
Triple tap VATs, not the best fix but it is quick and easy.
---
But then how do you get the other conduit pieces to attach to it so that you can run wires outside with your generator inside? Because my game won't let me connect anything to the wall pass through conduit unless it is placed inside the wall so that the side with the wire attachment is inside and the other side with the 2 connecting ports coming out of the other side of the wall (if that makes sense)
---
I can see it. Ugh.
---
Yea as I said i'm probably very ignorant due to me never having worked or know anything about code at all :)
---
It's just astounding to me how many titles is like this. Both online and offline!
---
But yeah it's very true what you are saying :)
---
seriously tho, the sauce has got me too. I remember many  [u/Aten\_Ra](https://www.reddit.com/u/Aten_Ra/)  bug roundups going basically unnoticed when people were screaming at the top of their lungs for fixes that were clearly outlined.  it was crazy frustrating watching that work done in vein and thats only from an observers point of view, i could only imagine it from the actual person who put forth all the effort. this game effectively raised me up when i needed it, then took me to the shed and gave me a good mental whoopin when i thought i was having fun. prolonging the grind is not content and taking away what little player made content we have left is a bullshit move.
---
Forgot. One of the CMs replied that they were indeed supposed to be in the game now and they're currently investigating.
---
Basically, they'll be added in patch 22.
---
Or, in another light: being able to obtain a weapon that can still be obtained, vs being able to have a certain type of camp that otherwise could not be obtained.
---
I just want to finish so I don't have to play anymore...
---
I've tried countless other ways to use it but how I did it before was the only way that would work for me and my game
---
What do you mean? Wallpapers you purchased can no longer be placed?
---
Well well well ;)
---
They broke the main quest; any competent studio would have that hotfixed in 48 hours tops.
---
If you payed for them. Send a ticket. There’s nothing we can do here. If you had them unlocked because of an atom store bug that gave you access to wallpaper you didn’t buy. Then don’t send a ticket. There was a bug that gave people wallpaper they didn’t pay for and that was correct a few weeks back. Hopefully that helps. Sending a ticket is you best bet if youre missing a purchase.
---
Man I stopped playing after month one, but occasionally pop into this sub to see anything they're doing well and its always nothing good. Adding broken raids to the game, stale content, and then taking away the one thing this community had left, camps. What an absolute waste of money this game was. We all got swindled
---
Just cancelled, I'm over this shit
---
Well I never play in 3d person either, but sometimes i like to take a look of my character or take a pic or just walk around in a safe area. It's not because we don't use 3d person view much we need to get shit like this.
---
I agree. I was annoyed when wastelanders got delayed multiple times, but at least they cleaned up most of the worst bugs it had before release. (There were still a few bad ones though) 
---
But EVERYONE was praising them for doing it and taking the time to fix things before release. Now this time around everyone just wants to ignore the fact that they did that last time and just need their “shit on the game” fix because they’re complainer junkies.
---
Irony: sell them at 1c and you'll probably move them considering the SCORE challenge.  I tried buying a 0c Mole Miner gauntlet recipe and it didn't count for the challenge, so sell 'em at 1c and you might actually get rid of them.
---
I haven’t even looked at it yet. Steel for beep is a bad deal in the wastelands
---
So I'm wasting my time going to Vault 79 and keep checking back for the deep-pocketed mod is this is frustrating I have gold saved up and I want those deep pocket and what about the legendary perk system is that ever going to be implemented has it been implemented and I'm just missing it I'm confused
---
Yeah. The most annoying thing isn't the lack of content in these updates which is a downer.
---
Its the fact that they are hardly fixing any fucking bugs.
---
Fast travel bug being prevelent months later. Auto complete bug. How long was that in the game for????
---
Its not good enough. Its not fun waiting  a month minimum hoping that a big may get fixed and at the same time praying that the patch won't bring about 20 more fucking bugs. Or reintroduce one's which were fixed before.
---
Its getting to the point where i feel this game is truly beyond repair. Its fucked. It won't get better. And that is piss poor coming from a major studio.
---
How far behind? I just cracked 40 on my alt and I am fairly certain I can make it.
---
Did you claim outfits from atomic shop? Once you do you need to craft them. 
---
Tent you pull up your weapon wheel and see a prompt at the bottom to deploy.
---
I'm not sure if they are worse than EA, but i would say they are a strong contender.
---
Bethesda when fixing a game act like they have 0 brain cells, but when patching a duplication glitch be like getting past the chinese censorship
---
Congrats mate! I can't belive the crappy rewards of these entitled MFs
---
I’m wearing it. But I applied it pre patch 21.
---
What are these spoons doing in the pancake drawer?!?...
---
... knife wreeeeeeench!
---
Yep. No rads. Or diseases (when I’m running low on purified water, since I only have 1 small purifier, I just drink straight from the source when I’m at my camp. )😆To me its worth it. I boil a lot of water for disease cures and booze. Lol. I don’t like to take radaways or take a decon shower just to collect a lot of dirty water from a lake or stream, since I run low health. 😅😁
---
&gt;I'm not so sure that they would have chosen this of all things as to reach their quota, however, as any person with the slightest idea of how the game is played could see this backfiring.
---
Oh wow...
---
Do you honestly believe for a second that this would even be a consideration of any dev at Bethesda given the past history of bug "fixes" we've had with this game?
---
I'm not talking about some dev in some company. I'm talking about these specific devs in this specific company. 
---
It's laughable on the face of it to even entertain that comment.
---
I'm so happy, I finished my new camp on monday 😅
---
This deserves a sticky, or at least top spot in the front page, but you know it won't. The hive mind is strong.
---
I like how everybody thinks this is how companies always work. 
---
There’s gonna be the devs working on the actual game, that are being told what to do, and if they’re allowed the time to test things themselves before they’re live or to put it in game right then. 
---
Then there’s another team that works on ATX. 
---
Then there’s one or two people that right things, such as the ITVs and patch notes, who are just told what to say, and have a possibility of just typing but not confirming with the devs about if what is being said is true or not. 
---
Then there’s the managers/team leaders/investors that just tell everyone what to do/what they want to happen. 
---
You can’t just blame the foreman of a construction crew for the workers under them not being paid, or for the house not looking as it was described to whoever contracted them. That blame goes to HR and the marketing team.
---
I've not seen any immersion breaking camps, the hideous "wallpaper" being sold in the atomic shop is pretty immersion breaking, but there's nothing more immersion breaking than crashing to desktop in the middle of an event or having to restart the game because you're completely unable to do damage to enemies.
---
Thank you. Should have stated PC. Started PS4 last year. Starting over PC this time. Now to find a way to get back to the level I was quickly.
---
Upvoting cuz I'm a first member you are right. Also I'd like to add something I just realized...if a car salesman sells a 2020 vehicle with 2003 engine wtf is that called and is there legal recourse. Because they are selling us crap we have already used and played with they ha e monetized 3 video games against us.
---
But the thing is, hacked weapons and gear *do* indirectly hurt the bottom line.
---
The entire conceit of the game is the grind.  People throwing themselves at the mercy of Murmrgh or killing thousands of Legendaries for the minute chance that they'll get something amazing.  That's what keeps people logging in every day, keeps the numbers up, keeps them going to the Atomic Shop.
---
And then you have these players who are magically able to get whatever they want, whenever they want it, who *flaunt* this at every opportunity, and are *never* punished for it.  They've essentially "beat" the game and have no reason to come back.
---
It's kind of a problem, especially when everything you do now is focused on making the grind more arduous and unrewarding.  Why should anyone bother?
---
#reverttheupdate #notanotherdollar #unsubscribefromfallout1st
---
Real big shame. The building system already has so many arbitrary restrictions on it.  A large portion of the player-base are camp builders.  Bethesda occasionally spotlight and compliment camps that use these glitches.  Just, why?  They are hellbent on sapping all enjoyment out of the game.
---
You have to donate in batches of 250 steel. 250 steel = 1 provisions package.
---
I also spent a few minutes yelling at the sky, maybe that was the trick...
---
... if that doesn't work, google "rebuild ps4 cache" that might help if you have a ps4 older than 3 years
---
Y'all care too much about this video game. If you don't have fun, play something else. If you do have fun, enjoy! Maybe you guys spend too much time playing 76, idk.
---
Exactly! I mean even Blackeye for whom you bring some meat is way nicer and after a while calls you her favourite supplier! And not everybody even know about her! But the very character that gives the only daily for Foundation rep is like this.. Guess logic does not apply in this games.
---
The game is finicky about placement, but you can attach conduits to the top and bottom of one side, wire to the other. You can also put the piece that is a wire connector with a conduit connection. I use them all the time to get power through a wall.
---
It makes sense but it is really shitty for the players. If you wanna make a f2p game then make a f2p game. Don't make a game that has every component of a f2p title and then charge 60$ for it.
---
I made a post a while ago saying same thing. I literally do camp fire tales everytime and just now received my first one since I got my original 8 for High capacity back pack mod. I know when I was grinding for them it was so inconsistent that I did a lot of the challenges for badges instead of events. I wanna buy the other mod but after 1000 events and only receiving 1 is kind of disheartening
---
Gotcha, thanks
---
My point exactly. Someone may have discovered a gamebreaking bug or something. I'm glad they're delaying stuff this time instead of rushing an unfinished piece
---
While EA is talking about releasing that new Star Wars Squadrons for $40 with no microtransactions... what world is this?
---
Though then again, we shouldn't have to use a double-wall exploit to have double-sided interior walls either.
---
From the outside, it appears to be a combination of absolutely incompetent management, and not staffing enough actual developers, as in people who primarily design and write code (not just people who make changes through the Creation Kit)
---
Damn Greg and his necrophyllic tendencies.
---
Im not mad
---
Ive never used an exploit and my camp is awesome I also have never got a duped weapon but have got good rolls like furious explosive 25 less AP handmande, junkies explosive fixer and just yesterday I got a junkies 25 handmade from the blood eagle captain in riding shot gun, point is you dont need exploits for a good camp build or to get a good gun.
---
Having to waste more time to do something i could simply 48 hours ago is the issue.
---
Yeah, only a handful are available, most of my wallpapers have disappeared.
---
You think only 7k people play the game?
---
9k are on steam alone at this minute.
---
I have more.  Don't test me.  I'll send you down the deepest youtube hole......
---
100%
---
Are you sure it's not just floating above your head? Are you crouching?
---
Hate to say it but this entire game became a chore.  We at least used to have the hope that wastelanders would add some interesting stuff but alls it really added was more chores.
---
A show on Amazon.
---
Your one of the few. 😅
---
I put in 4K steel. Then I vendor hopped and farmed Wes Tek and Line in the Sand to get it all back after getting a sack full of floater grenades and some bs plans. Patch 21 you disappoint me.
---
Yes before patch 20 I could shoot explosive bullets at enemies I can touch, now I’d kill myself right away if I do that.
---
You might make it because of the upcoming double score but it's gonna be a grind. Without that though, no chance.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hm3f2d/legendary_run_score_rundown_guide/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share 
---
That post tells you where you need to be by what day to finish the run by the end of it.
---
Yeah that's what I would do but I can't get it to work anymore because I can't do the thing with the wall anymore and I can't get it to work any other way. So I'm just trying to figure out another way to do it
---
That was the amount of players online at any given time. The same people aren’t playing 24/7 and steam is a small slice of the pie.
---
9k on steam, my guess is around 40k across all platforms. If average playtime is 2 hours that means roughly 480k daily active players.
---
Yeah. When they announced they disabled the event because of the critter spawn issue I’m fairly certain they broke the internet for a few hours there.
---
We saw the same thing pre-Wastelanders though.
---
76's team apparently isn't big (or profitable) enough to work on more than one large content drop at a time.  So, in between these larger updates, we get this scrap content, probably made by the "B-team," so to speak, while the A-team goes and makes a new main quest and seems to have a genuine interest in improving the game.
---
Personally, I'd prefer if there was a more consistent flow of modest updates rather than saving up for "the big one" every time.
---
Right, the bos inclusion is off in many, many ways
---
Why donate any
---
I get that it's the principle but if they rushed an unfinished event which has the chance to be dogshit everyone would be unhappy
---
Camp Budget is a general limitation to help keep things from getting completely out of hand for the average user, it's really isn't a catch-all for all possible camp issues. Two different camps with a full budget could have very different effects on performance depending on what's in them.
---
This. You don't get separate regular (Responder), settler and raider tents. You just get one tent to place down but your choose the 'skin" it takes on.
---
👏👏👏
---
But I’ve been told by angry redditors that the event numbers were going to be impossible to obtain and that nobody was going to do it?? How could this be possible???
---
still occurring post maintenance today.
---
I submitted a ticket on this and referenced this thread
---
Actually... Have you played Fallout 1 or Fallout 2? Because in the first game they genuinely tried to help the vault dweller from vault 13 as best they could. In two you could not join if you had ever killed a child in the game.
---
Meanwhile in Fallout two the Enclave were genuinely the bad guys. 
---
Then Bethesda took over... And Fallout plot for factions got... Weird. I am gonna say weird.
---
This Brotherhood is supposed to be the originals that went west to see the state of the country and start towards a rebuild. I just hope Bethesda does them justice and either retcons the newer story of them from Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, and Fallout 4 OR actually strongly works to demonstrate as the Lore in those games mentioned that a divide between the coasts happened.
---
But then, opinions are like assholes. We all have them and they all stink so... Take it with a grain of salt and feel however you feel about each Canon long term faction.
---
The whole thing is stupid and they should have reworked that conduit when they "fixed" the walls but oh well
---
Let me know how that works out for ya.
---
Definitely, but at least now we have a workaround. I just wish it didn't require a mod, I hate that this does nothing to help console users.
---
Wait I’m out of the loop, what building workaround did they mess up?
---
The free stuff of this week is worth a lot more than the Atlas rewards...
---
I'm not mad, I'm disappointed
---
As far as mobs go, I had to server hop to find mobs that have already been picked off for quests and stuff. Idk about world loot. In fact I've also been on missions with om teammates and they'd go around, pick a whole rooms junk clean and I leave it there to see if they need it. Then they pick it up and it's still there for me.
---
I think everyone gets their own world loot too, not just mob loot. Once it's gone for you it's gone until the server resets each day, AFAIK.
---
I got one from Operation Tidy recently. Within the last 3-4 days at most.
---
How long have you been playing for? For the veterans, this is just more of the same bullshit 1 step forward 2 steps back, except the camp building is HUGE for a lot of people. 
---
There isn’t really a combat endgame. A lot of longtime player’s “endgame content” is camp building. So fucking up THAT? Is a big deal.
---
And you clearly can’t have been playing long if you think “the BoS under armor will be fixed” and “nothing is permanent”. Their track record of fixing bugs, is very, very bad. Let alone reimbursing people for lost mods, hahahaha....
---
Guess how many bugs are still in game that have been here since launch? Or that were fixed at one point, but then came back and are still bugged? You might as well call those permanent, because in our timeline, they are. 
---
Hell even touted “features!” That they introduce, and later broke, are still broken (camp bulldozing with grass/bushes being suppressed by foundations. Yeah, that was really cool for the few months we had it! Then they broke it again and it’s still broken.)
---
What is *blindingly* clear to anyone who’s been playing for a while is Bethesda doesn’t have ANY form of version control (the same bugs keep coming back) and virtually no QA/play testing (the sheer obviousness of so many of these bugs- the SS deep pockets that they say the patch added? How do you fuck that up!), and pay very little attention to the player base’s concerns.
---
I'm telling the Prydwen on you
---
You mean the Enclave yal work with to get access to those nukes? Anyone who calls the Brotherhood fascists are either people who never played before Fallout 4 or are over reactionists who immediately saw them as racists for not liking ghouls, mutants, and synths, despite there being actual reasoning to their stance.
---
So your issue is placing the passthrough conduit through the wall to begin with?
---
And they proved yet again that new content mean more bugs that may or may not get fixed. I understand that monthly fee games must have regular new content but who would pay a monthly fee for a game full of bugs? People dropping their 1st membership are all over reddit since last patch. 
---
Taking some time to actually fix things would probably be better for the sales in the long term instead of luring people with new content, disappoint them yet again because that new content adds ton of new bugs to a pretty long list and see them leave.
---
Mine didn’t show up when in pip boy. They still count and accumulate though.
---
I'm sure none of this will actually work. People these days just want to complain. That gets us nowhere tho as that's all we've been doing for 2 years now...
---
30k steel for 10 plans.... christ, no lube right up your back end
---
My theory:
---
Bethesda wanted to create a “Battle Royale” style MMO. MMO are cheaper to maintain &amp; easier to monetise. An Event once created can be played ad infinitum, a quest line takes writing and is often one and done. However to garner the investment they had to bring their fallout audience along with them. So they created 76 and advertised it as being your usual Fallout but with further functionality. The reality is it’s Fallout lite and mainly MMO.
---
Therefore Bethesda really do not care too much about camp building or quest lines, they are merely legacy things they had to give us in order for us to transition to the new game style.
---
"After I finish this season."
---
Stand tall, OP.
---
&gt; Two different camps with a full budget could have very different effects on performance depending on what's in them. 
---
We're talking about wall pieces, so you're point is pretty meaningless given how elementary in both performance and budget walls are.
---
That's tough talk for someone who lost the Brotherhood-Enclave war
---
Lol that’s not at all what I said. Doesn’t even say 7k in my post
---
900+ hours last I checked. Started in November 2018
---
Not really stealing if it's a donation.
---
Don't judge me😂 I'm less than 20 levels away and I've worked hard. 😂
---
Nothing changed about the events dropping loot. What changed was the loot pool that can drop.
---
I really like how the BOS has turned basically fascist in FO4, that there is regional difference or progression over time. Their shaking down of the population in 76 is really provocative.
---
People who build those camps aren't part of the building community you imbecile. You're only crying about one group of people but shifting you're hatred towards everyone else. Also, yes. There's a right and wrong way to drop nukes. If you don't see the advantages of the meta, even of you don't tailor you're playstyle to them, then you'll never be the best you can be. Exploits or not. I don't main legacy weapons, I don't use magic weapons, I do have an amazing C.A.M.P., it does not float, I am a bloodied build. You. Are a sad individual.
---
Fallout 76 is developed by "Bethesda Game Studios" but not the one in Maryland. They have a studio in Austin that developed 76.
---
You misspelled "game" as "patch"
---
Didn't you all die in-universe?  Everyone in game is an implant.
---
It was purely in the context of the OP announcing they're quitting. Are you actually bothered by that? Genuinely concerned that some anonymous whosits on the internet is quitting a game? There may be some valid points in there but they have been greatly overshadowed and pissed on by the 'I'm quitting' nonsense. I mean, is this Facebook?
---
This 69^420
---
Was not aware. So they're just $30 cosmetic packs essentially?
---
Point in case: the odds of rolling a B2525 fixer are ~ 1/55000. Here’s the math:
---
There are 22 primary prefixes that can roll on a ranged weapon. Therefore the odds of me rolling a Bloodied ranged weapon are 1/22. There are 6 secondary prefixes that an roll on a ranged weapon. The odds of me getting a 25 weapon are 1/6. The odds of getting any one ranged B25 weapon are therefore 1/132. There are 9 tertiary prefixes that can roll on a ranged weapon. As a result, the odds of getting xy25 are 1/9. So, the odds of getting a B2525 weapon are 1/1,188. Now, since there are 47 different ranged weapons that can roll, the odds of the weapon being a fixer are 1/47. 
---
So, if the odds of a fixer are 1/47, then the odds of a blooded fixer (1 star) are 1/1,034. Those odds are already bullshit. Let’s ramp it up a little more. I want it to be B25. So now it’s 1/6,204. Thomas has never seen such bullshit before. But no, I’m after B2525. This makes the odds 1/55,836. That is a 0.000017909592378% chance of getting a B2525 fixer from the purveyor. Round it up to 0.00002%. That is still absolutely fucking mental. I have more chance of winning £1000 from a scratch card than rolling a B2525 fixer from the purveyor. This is why the RMT cunts were able to sell them for £100 each on eBay and the like.
---
Oh and by the way, these odds? They get even longer if you want to roll from a legendary monster. I will update this comment shortly with further calculations (for a B2525 handmade as you can’t get legendary fixers from the wild.)
---
let others do what you don't can.
---
fadingsignal did a ladder mod. like alot of other modders, they know the game and engine obviously way better then the developer themself... let them work for you, like the base idea of the creationclub was before bethesda screwed up this aswell ofc...

---
I thought it was just me. There is nothing I fear more in this game than a pack of mirelurk kings. They are way OP.
---
As we all should be. ✊🏻
---
EA at least releases games that *mostly* work.
---
Do you really take those numbers as truth, Beth wouldn't let this crap fest fail, terrible pr
---
Instead of just making the Chinese Armor helmet actually prevent waterborne diseases, they just attempt to change the name. Pathetic. Now I know why I kept getting waterborne diseases while playing Heart of the Swamp, that helmet wasn't doing anything.
---
Thing is it wasn't even just a notification. My bar actually went up and I unlocked the next 2 rewards on the list
---
Ally is top status, correct?
---
(Donates 250 steel)
---
(views rewards)
---
(World goes slow motion, greyscale, enya's "only time" plays, throws controller at wall, misses wall, dies)
---
Are you sure you're not pushing it too far/not far enough through the wall, or too close to other objects perhaps? For me it works exactly as intended.
---
Dude It's still not about the event. At all. Stop ignoring the actual problems of the update
---
agree. it's just too boring now. same events, same monologs, blah.
---
✊
---
(barks at internet)
---
Wut
---
It was inconsistent and it needed a pass.
---
The Secret Service and Black Shovel Backpacks didn't clip for me, but the Corvega one always did.
---
I don't know how it looks now, but the Backpacks always looked ridiculous on Robot Armor too.
---
Hey, I get it. The Run has me playing hours every day.
---
Wait until those whiners tell you that it is an autocomplete thing and Bethesda cheats the meter...
---
I see the “boycott” is going well.....
---
When buried under 10 lbs of micro... oh, yeah....
---
I was trying to back into your number. 125,000,000 steal is needed. You said 17k per person. That comes out to roughly 7k players (rounding down a few hundred ). 
---
125,000,000/17,000=7352 players 
---
Maybe you can explain the 17k per person number as I must have misunderstood.
---
you're missing the point completely.
---
I mean considering they fucked up something as simple as a texture change on the camp item, making your camp map marker completely disappear, it's no wonder they fucked up this patch.
---
Thanks to all who do donate. I hope you make it. But I need my steel as I don't have loads
---
the reality is, most of the issues brought up here are exaggerated. Like when the bans were starting, I saw things like, "90% of players are duping, if they ban there will be no community." 
---
Then you see things like, "I completed the legendary run. there's no end-game content, this sucks." I just got the ammo converter. I am prolly below average on time spent in fallout, but I would imagine that the average player WILL NOT complete the run, but reddit will say, "everyone finished it and there's no content now."
---
A lot of complaints about this patch have to do with "fixing" a glitch that people were using. I understand that the building doesn't work and it sucks you have to resort to workarounds, but you are describing a complaint about a glitch. A glitch is not used by the majority.
---
If things weren't so exaggerated, I am sure more would be willing to join in your crusade, but it's hard to know. I read all these complaints on here, i jump in the game and experience no issues.
---
I can't believe that they are actually justifying paying people real money to build this crap. They need to start monetarily penalizing the devs who put out crap updates.
---
Oh, i see thx.
---
That literally the only thing I noticed they fixed it correctly on this update, before the update all my backpacks were merging into my toon and now they finally looks on the correct position.
---
https://imgur.com/a/RfjLPz6
---
Sadly I don't have screenshots before the update, but to give you an idea, more than half of the wood frame of the blue ridge caravan backpack was inside my toon.
---
To be honest, it feels like Beth gave up on the game since it failed so horribly at the start and just put the lowest tier Devs they have on it to save it from dying out all together.
---
If it is, then it's pretty impressive
---
Prepare to be severely downvoted for bringing sense to the table.
---
Basic functionality needs to be restored. Or rather, introduced lol. All perks and legendary effects work as intended, Vats working as intended.
---
It really can't be overstated just how shit their game engine is at this point. Like even Unity would work better than the dumpster fire they call an engine.
---
That’s just a guess with random numbers though, which is why I asked where that number came from. 
---
The only source I even saw that suggested that number(which you’re saying is actually bigger), was 400k and that was a sourceless article from 8 months ago and the numbers have dropped since then.
---
Something tells me every milestone in this event will be reached:
---
75.19m steel, over halfway to the first level on a single day.  Sure, it's a common resource easy enough to gather, but still.
---
what are the new building changes?
---
It’s pretty typical given types of bugs we have seen in the past.
---
new camp skin from run breaks it
---
Did you put the future rev skin on it? If you did that’s an issue.
---
Stealth Commando is pretty great, but I prefer a Rifleman build with a Bloodied or Junkies FFR lever to any weapon in the game. With AGI high enough you can sneak anywhere and deal death to any regular mob in one headshot. So much cheaper on resources too. The others are certainly viable but I can get thru all my dailies and score challenges with the ~300 rounds of .45 my ammo machine makes a day. 
---
However I switch it up and play heavy non PA vs SBQ. My FFR Primed Bloodied Gatling slays.
---
Or the trade bug...
---
Really? I knew fallen order was good, but i didn't even know of a C&amp;C remaster
---
Y'know, the Mole Miner Pails were a pain in the butt.  A lot of people probably don't have the plans introduced in that, like the Circus Cage, the Crococolossus Backpack, or even the Insurgent and Treasure Hunter gear.
---
Maybe they could have kept those rewards in the pool.  It would at least be something *new* for most players.
---
But no.  Can't have that.  Instead, it's the exact same pool that was already duped to high hell.
---
Fuck the Brotherhood of Steal and the Enclave. Appalachia belongs to the vault dwellers, raiders and I guess we can let those pansies at Foundation hang out for a bit.
---
I jumped off this dumpster fire train forever ago. I still follow to see if anything changes. Guess not.
---
I am taking a break from the game, I can't play a game where the gamers love to play it as it is but the company doesn't give a shit about it or it's fans.I am done for now.
---
And I don't mean to tell you what to do but if you care about Fallout everyone should stop playing it, send them a message because it's only going downhill from here if you don't.
---
no they aren't, you think they care for those awards?
---
If you were a realist you'd realize that a video game is not really worth getting repeatedly outraged about.
---
The vast majority of current issues will be fixed with patience. If it's that big of a deal, there's other games until then. We dealt without those things fine. The world will continue turning for the couple weeks max it'll take for them to be added.
---
Ha the notification pop up looping in middle of the screen is most annoying thing ever. I have to aim and shoot before it pops up again for a split second
---
 I wish I could but due to the new bug I can’t, but thanks for telling me!
---
Sounds like it's not so bad after all
---
Precisely
---
bugtesla
---
The sentiments on this sub are in no way reflective of what goes on in the game, should have learned that by now.
---
to be fair those same people also said bethesda would fudge the numbers and make us win regardless. these progress bars are manually updated daily, so while i would like to believe its legit, it is entirely possible the numbers are BS.
---
There should also be a “sell all of this type” button and “sell all ammo of all types” button
---
The pocketed &amp; deep pocketed SS limbs is there. I finally finished my vault 79 raid &amp; Regs is right there with the pocket/deep pocket SS plans. Not cheap, but they're there.
---
Why would rain water be dirty?
---
Hm, this broke before in the Patch 20 PTS version, and I actually reported it, and it seemed to be fixed. I didn't run the MQ again for Patch 21 because I was busy with the Season and I've run it around ten times now. Guess it re-broke.
---
And if that's the case then there to blame. Ive definitely gave bethesda hella money over the years. Including paying there stupid sub that i can never cancel. But one day you have to say enough is enough. Bethesda abuses us... physically and mentally and were sitting here accepting it...
---
Or they don't care the way people who spend a lot of time on game-specific subs on reddit do?
---
Somebody data mined the rewards. It's crap we already have and junk plans that still exist in the game. Nothing new was added. But wait, there's a collectron skin and he'll collect....the same junk the others collect. Whoopty fucking Doo.
---
It's just bizarre really. It is as if they want to get rid of players that explore the game in-depth. For example, PVP support has been practically non-existent and the PVP community is filled with incredibly knowledgeable, passionate players. (I know people hate PVP on here but I would argue its problems are mostly due to Bethesda's negligence). 
---
And now giving a stiff middle finger to the building community? Builders are also some of the most passionate players remaining, not to mention the biggest spenders. Once again I'm left scratching my head- why do they continue to ostracize their most loyal players?
---
exactly
---
It's like being in an abusive relationship. You might be best off applying a similar solution to that problem - stepping away from it. At least for a while.
---
Maybe things will turn around. Maybe they won't. However, at least you won't be jerked around in the process. Either you can come back when things have smoothed themselves out somewhat or you've dodged a bullet and put all that time and energy into better and more fruitful pursuits.
---
We can still rig wires through wall, that's not an issue *yet*. The issue is that it's not completely impossible to get wallpaper on both sides of a wall.
---
Here's what I want you to do.
---
I want you to go to your company Slack and hit up Patrick Labrie. Tell him International_XT sent you. He'll know who this is, although he'll likely deny it. I want you to tell him to take 30 minutes out of his very busy day to put together a community-friendly explanation of what is making the VATS bugs so hard to fix. If he doesn't have the answer, tell him to go shake some trees and see what falls down. 
---
This community is about at a boiling point. Do what you've been hired to do, and communicate. If someone is throwing up roadblocks, go higher. These cesspools of negative sentiment in this community and others cannot be fun to work with for you, but you actually have the means to change the narrative for once. 
---
We need answers, and "it's tricky" isn't good enough.
---
I have posted, and commented, and seen nothing.  After searching this was not archived, so here I am.
---
I'm looking for a solution...
---
I agree that the previous events like the Christmas thing, while also a grind, were at least active and fun.  They got the community to play together.
---
This is a very passive, forgettable activity.  And not only that, but Russell Dorsey's smug face is imminently punchable.
---
Get em
---
WOW!
---
This is great to know but a heads up about it sooner would have been nice!
---
there was a bug not many were talking about where you had access to wallpapers yoy didnt pay for. i wouldnt be srurpised if that was fixed. check the atomic shop to make sure you actually own the wallpaper you wanted to build.
---
Unfortunately so far based on posts I read it seems that Patch 21 broke An Ounce of Prevention quest most likely thanks to that change they made to the quest listed in the patch notes and it broke some instance quest areas this includes Cheating Death and From Russian with Lev quests.
---
Do you have class freak equiped?
---
this game is cool. i like it. i play other games too though so i end up not really running out of content on 76.
---
Yes this is my experience as well.
---
I did it once and became disillusioned. I went on a run and gathered enough steel and I came out with some useless stuff.
---
The community is not mad, it's disappointed and confused. You have a point, but I cannot completely agree with it. I've only recently started actively using reddit because sometimes you can get more info here than anywhere else about the game, but to the point. The community is actually very helpful and what's going on now, this outrage and frustration, is sorta a cry for help. This stage is followed by refusing to play, only it won't get the game fixed but more likely will let it die. Even if we all stop playing it as an act of revolt or something it won't help, because new players will come who won't know/care about this whole thing. The petition sounds more reasonable, but then again it won't have any effect. From what I've heard from people who bought this game when it launched, FO76 has improved a lot after a massive outrage of players who've been basically cheated on and for the sake of their reputation they started doing shit. If only there was a way to endanger their reputation again. But this is just my opinion on your opinion.
---
Those are hell Especially the Trapped spawns
---
"Wear a uniform so they recognize you just like the responder eyebot recognizes those uniforms."
---
Like Russell Dorsey did when I rocked up in my BOS Elder T-60 Power Armor? Or when I hopped out of my PA and stood there in my full BOS Combat Armor, with BOS Officer under armor?
---
Who is this Russell Dorsey shmuck anyway?
---
EDIT: BOS ain't arriving ... we've been here the whole time
---
So funny. Just a day or two ago i had like 4 people telling me its 100% worth it
---
Yep. But we have to do something about those dupers!
---
KEKW
---
If I just place it on the wall to where it doesn't go through the wall then it lights up as green, but the second I push it any further into the wall to use it as intended then it turns red and I can't place it. This is regardless of if there is something next to it or nothing in the room at all.
---
I honestly just want to see what the BOS questline is all about then I hope they shut it down. It's ran it's course.
---
So what we, as a community, need to do is not feed into Bethesda’s “other projects” (whatever they are) and instead use the subscription service here as a way to show our like or dislike or released content. If they put out a patch worthy of our time, we subscribe or purchase things in the shop. If they keep doing this kind of stuff, we simply boycott anything they can make money from. Then we do like the OP did and let them know why. That’s the best we can do to fix the game by fixing their budgeting priority for the devs.
---
I've got my money's worth. And if it means the next proper installment, so be it.
---
This is the crowd where business is as usual. It's different from the ranters. Boycotters might be the loudest but the game has a silent majority.
---
Sooooo, what, do they need to ask for our permission before they can fix anything in the game?
---
the real question is, why isnt there a way to check the progress?
---
We need to pick a day or week and go on strike, no one play, let them servers sit empty.
---
It'a red when you start pushing it but should turn green once it's far enough through.
---
You mean the raiders that only lived because they fled with their tails between their legs?
---
Abuses us physically???
---
Yeah I think the building was the only thing really keeping me in but we know where that went with this patch.
---
Yep, they're still dropping from the dailies and from campfire tales, I've earned around 25 badges now and I've only been playing this character for 2.5 months.
---
When they “fixed” the Gatling gun bug I was really frustrated because it nerfed my build considerably. When they eventually “fix” magic weapons that’s probably gonna be it for me playing this game. I’m not about to spend hours grinding and trading for other good gear just to get it nuked from existence
---
Been seeing a whole lot of nukes dropped on them lately.
---
...Let them burn...
---
I absolutely will. Ot be touching any of the new shit they are slinging
---
No. There has been too little content in the game for a looooong time - also usually the people creating new content are not the same that fix bugs. There may be an overlap depending on the type of content (because new content may also need new coding), but it should be easy to do both.
---
20 steel and 2 plastic is 7 caps.
---
But actually it's 0 because you should be maxing out your vendor caps anyway.
---
If you sold it through the vendor it would be 35k caps.
---
But actually it's 0 because no one buys steel, even people looking to dump caps because they're at cap limit.
---
So actually it's 4000 caps you wouldn't have had otherwise.
---
It never changes to green again. So maybe my game building is just bugged
---
Try resetting your router and modem. That helped for me when I had this issue a couple weeks ago. It might not necessarily be tied to the update. But then again, this is Bethesda we're talking about so it could be.
---
I’ll totally hit it with this one as soon as I transfer over some Unyielding gear and grind XP.
---
Yup. Saw it last night and have run it multiple times in the last week. I always do that and AWOL Armaments because they are one of the best sources for max level legendaries now that One Violent Night has been nerfed. Plus, there are a supposedly a couple weapons that you can only get as legendaries from the smart prizes like the dragon and ripper. Though the chances of getting one are next to none and they'll only be one-star.
---
Ok, I’m just ass irritated as most players - I haven’t played in a couple weeks, cancelled my 1st sub, moved on to another etc... but outraged and depressed? My personal opinion, but if an update to a game made you raged and depressed, it’s prob due to some other underlying issues that you should work on. No game should make you feel that way. Irritated and annoyed enough to “rage quit” is pretty normal these days, but depressed? Come on dude. Sounds like you’re just torturing yourself.
---
If they were inflating the numbers, I imagine they'd make it look like we were a little bit behind to encourage people to go donate, or they at least wouldn't make it this intense. Them inflating it to like 60% in like eight hours would be a wild ass-pull. Tbh, I'm one of the people who thought Bethesda would inflate the numbers to reach the rewards if necessary, but based off the activity I saw on the map for ATLAS when I played yesterday I'd fully believe this. Dupers and scrap boxes exist.
---
Yes! Really crappy rewards. Alkohol and a couple of stims was all I got for 3000 steel, wont do it again.
---
Been gone 2 days..... What's all the hoopla and belly aching about?
---
Yeah, thank you I un equipped and it showed up
---
Fair. I’ve donated over 5k this morning. Just doing it for the fun of helping out.
---
Things were worse towards the end of the last roadmap. At least we're getting content still, albeit being delayed over and over.
---
There isn't a deadline that Bethesda won't miss and there is no good feature that goes unpunished. However, so long as that microtransaction money keeps flowing and morons keep throwing money at Bethesda to "support" them, the game will still be up and running.
---
I know let's unban them!!!!!!
---
It's less disappointing than steel.
---
It's going to auto complete no matter what we do.
---
But you helped everyone get closer to the community prise!
---
bruh i made a reddit account just to reply to you stop being dense af
---
Lol yeah I'm sure you did
---
Then that new content better be fucking awesome and worth it.
---
Because if 50% of the community donates 500 steel that number would have been met yesterday. A lot of people aren’t doing it.
---
:)
---
I've probably got 300 or so if you're going to be on later tonight
---
Do yourself a favor.. Make use of Reddit's hide and block features. Hide whiney posts and block users that seem to only have negative things to say. I only blocked a hand full of people, less then ten and the discourse here greatly improved. Also try to avoid this sub for 2 or 3 days after any update. It doesn't matter how good or bad the update is, people will come here and act like Bethesda violated their human rights or something.
---
Sorry didn’t mean to assume, but you previous comment alluded to everyone dupes (I think) &amp; then something about trading, sorry that bit wasn’t clear to me. 
---
The grind, the arbitrary limits, the numerous ponderous currencies are a big part of the game, love them or hate them. That will only change if people do leave the game, that’s the only impact Bethesda will listen to.
---
With previous Fallouts if you wanted to cheat, hack use exploits, that’s fine. You are cheating only yourself. But in FO76 you are cheating the community, whether it’s 1 item or 1000. It barely impacts Bethesda but for honest players the playing field is no longer level.
---
If people find other games easier, less of a grind, then go play that, don’t break my game &amp; I won’t break yours.
---
I gave up having hope for FO76.
---
I bet they lost a good number of players from this alone.
---
I had 44k scrap steel saved up. I was planning to drop most of it on this event. But after 20 donations (5000 steel), the most useful thing I got was maybe a dozen plasma grenades. Not donating again until we get a chance at something that doesn't suck. Even if I was low level, the rewards aren't even close to being worth the exchange since Appalachia is practically littered with alcohol, radaway, and grenades.
---
I didnt know it had a hide and block. Thank u for the advice. 😁
---
The camp building nerf is such a senseless and tone deaf move.   More that any unintentional bug, this one was very intentional.   Its my biggest disappointment thus far.  
---
BTW, I like your position of play but not pay.  I too am still holding out hope that it might yet get better.  As you stated, I love the fallout series and still see such potential with 76... if they did an about face and expand camp building instead of crippling it.
---
So wait?  My UFO camps are now legacy? Am I misunderstanding?  I'm not home to test.  So can't change doors to walls anymore/vice versa?  This sucks, was going to help a friend build a spaceship, going to have to break the beth news to them. :/
---
While that works, it aint right. I shouldn't be forced to purposely click in error multiple times as a workaround to a shotty UI. Neither should I have to keep backing out and bringing up a second screen (pipboy). Nor should I have to bring pen and paper into it.  
---
It should, you know, just work.
---
You get it. That guy's not thinking about the big picture, they just want to get this "event" finished faster than bethesda ever expected.
---
It's mind boggling to me that anyone actually bought this game.  I've played all of the fallouts since I was a kid starting from the original but I passed on this one because it was clearly a low effort, buggy, cash grab.  Stop buying/rewarding developers for doing this type of stuff and they will have to make better games so that they will sell.
---
I don't care about any of that, I just want the trophy
---
If u exit your power armor, its gonna play the animation. However your still earning the score normally, so dont worry about it. Just slap that in the huge list of visual bugs.
---
I'm gonna be on most of the day, hopping from vendor to vendor to look for some. Much appreciated!
---
u/Aten_Ra was one of the main modders on Raider Overhaul for FO4.  He could have actually implemented the fixes he was outlining if they'd just let him.
---
Oooo, what you gonna do?  Threatening Bethesda?  C'mon, guy.  Its just a video game.  Calm down
---
Possible but doubtful
---
It's because you agreed (to some extent) to let the gold remain in the Vault so it can back the treasury notes.
---
Umm... Maybe try the Fallout 4 and Skyrim subreddits for that info...
---
If you were going off of 79m and divide by 1700 that still only implies 46k players, which I would argue is still incredibly low seeing as it’s a top 20 title on Xbox and 8k on steam right now
---
40k is probably close to how many are online at any given time, not throughout the day.
---
I have over 20k steel in my scrapbox and I've only donated 500 steel. I would do more if the rewards were better.
---
I saw someone else suggest this yesterday but it would have been an absolutely perfect opportunity for ultracite pa mod plans.  A few of these are all but impossible to get and it would fit the theme perfectly.
---
Read there patch notes. They delayed the colossal event again along with fixing building "glitches" that made building better. Along with a good bit of other things. My main problem is just the empty promises being tossed out and not given.
---
They will probably hand out temporary suspensions for everyone using those building "exploits". They just love to go out of their way to make things worse.
---
The ammo converter is still a case study in terrible UX. Shameful that this is an improvement over the original.
---
It's not only that. There was a trick where you could build a door frame, build electrical wires through the door space, *swap* the door frame with a wall and voilà. Same was possible with the flat/not flat roof.
---
I had a problem of a floating backpack after I purchased Raiders Package (my biggest mistake), so the backpack and the outfit didn't feet each other even though they were logically designed to fit well together.. But all the rest was decent, now I can't say even that. It might be good with armor, but if you use an outfit it's really out of place.. Just why can't they fix anything properly..
---
I understand the upset with the double sided wall I just don’t want them to add a double sided wall and not restore the old camp building
---
What should they say?
---
You can still do it with flamethrowers but it takes way more time
---
it was happening to me before the update, last night after the update is worked fine
---
Casuals are fucked either way.
---
I'm sure you already know about Nexus. I haven't modded Skyrim yet but for FO4 one great mod that comes to mind is the one that shows you your true response in a conversation. Not the vague answers that don't line up with what you actually say. The holstered weapons ones are fun but take a bit of tinkering to get working. Plus they only show you a certain version of the weapon, not the exact one you've created. Having Dogmeat with you and a second companion is fun too.
---
Imagine this happens and nw still is in beta. Then putting all focus for next year getting that out of beta, while no ft fix.
---
😂 tuesdays. Every tuesday until they fix the game. (That's shop reset day.)
---
That's called Fallout 1st...
---
Scrap is meant to be just annoying enough that you consider purchasing FO1st, become addicted to zero weight scrap, and maintain a subscription. We're never going to see zero weight scrap as a normal player unless one of the devs royally pooches an update somewhere along the line
---
The walls are funny on sloped ground. Where is your camp?
---
So, you've played the previous Fallouts, know the Brotherhoods history and struggles in the past, yet still think they're facists? And I dont think you understand all the was happening in 76 if you think they were "shaking down" the populace, especially when that populace was telling the BoS to screw off when they were fighting a threat to the survival of humanity.
---
They died, the newcomers are all alien
---
"We heard you loud and clear, double xp weekend" /s
---
Thanks to the dupers and pc hackers👍.
---
Do you find yourself making wildly implausible predictions a lot? Or do you save them for us?
---
Me and my buddy have done it in 48 seconds (start of event until death, not the actual fight) with a bloodied lmg and a suppressors cryolator with no exploits, just psycho big guns bobble and the right builds
---
Ok, makes sense. So where are the perk loadouts then? Lol
---
 Just want something new to the game, starting to get bored. Colossal Problem should be a good one, once it’s finally released. 
---
 The community donation event is kinda lame. Made a few donations yesterday but the incentive to keep grinding donations isn’t really there. Sounds like quite a few people agree.
---
They don't really respond to many issues. They probably won't respond to this one.
---
Lmao I've never seen such overreaction
---
What shotgun do you currently have?  I think your PER points could be used elsewhere (skeet + awareness)
---
The VATS thing is rediculous in general but especially with the guass shotgun.  For me, 90% of the time a 10% VATS chance hits the enemy on the first shot. 5% of the time a 95% VATS chance hits on the first shot. It's like they reversed the numbers. That's on my anti armor gun. The two shot gun is way worse and does less damage half the time.
---
There's a trick to VATS for the guass shotgun though.  Enter VATS at 95% chance, exit VATS, re-enter VATS and shoot. It seems re-entering VATS will correct the issue. It wastes AP but it's better than missing 5 times times standing on top of the enemy.  I've started using my Chinese stealth suit and sneak perks. I'm walking irony. A stealthy, non silenced shotgun wielder.
---
I just learned about the magic weapons. Last night I got a magic 1 star lvl 45 stalker pump action shotgun off a random drop. Complete shit without the bug. Only 101 damage with perks. I have no VATS perks yet I'm replacing my guass with this for now or until I find another magic weapon. Why? Inside VATS: 6 or 7 shots downed a lvl 50 scrochbeast... 1 to 2 shots for a death claw... 3 for a gulper... AND 95% VATS chance is actually 95%.
---
Pretty sure they are fake. I went 2x to the event and checked on it over the course of 7 hours. I donated 2k steel. Realized the rewards were shit and stopped. Never once did I see anyone at the event. I mean they could be real but I strongly doubt it. The community is pissed. It would be a bad move on bethesdas end to not let us pass. That said the true colors will shine when the object is cork. I think we'll have an idea then. If the boycott is working theirs no way we will reach the cork limit.
---
I did, if you play the game eventually you will get good rolls, if you dont believe me thats your choice, I just am stating fact, not everything in the game is from being duped or exploited.
---
Do you know what alienated means????
---
Is this trick possible to do with the sink? I dont have my camp at a water source and it's sooooo boring slowly getting dirty water from the sink.
---
it definitely wasn't around 1950 when the bombs fell
---
This. most of the events are unplayable right now.
---
"Sorry, we fixed an exploit" maybe.
---
I wonder, dupers also wants a "sorry" from Bethesda if they fix a dupe exploit?
---
lol your no issues fix will be plagued with issues. nice try though
---
The entitlement and childish whining is unreal. Gamer Karens are so cringe.  
---
Also note: Not defending Beth/76, they done fucked us over multiple times for real, but like c'mon man, you ain't suing no one. Go start your petition.org, that shit always works cuz "YoU gOt RiGhTs!!"
---
Wow, thanks all so much, already a lot of ideas.
---
Not a bloodied build originally. But need the gear for it, lots of player vendors carry bloodied legionaries.
---
My Armor is: 406 Phsyical, 478 Energy, and 15 Rads W/perk benifits.
---
well I guess that's what "you"/we get when they put a Fallout multiplayer title on a f2p-MTX-focused amateur studio by making them abandon their previous title because you didn't like their previous monetization concept.
---
Its waaaay more valuable to me then the measly crap you will get 90% of the time.
---
So I aint bothering.
---
Pc specs?
---
I get why they can’t have normal VATS in an online game but goddamn, I wish they would just figure it out and do it.
---
Totally agree, it feels like 76 is just some filler material between the main FO titles - one last paycheck from their old engine, I paid less for it than most of the fallout DLCs so I can't complain about value for money
---
&gt; Well, unfortunately these types of "dont give them your money!" boycotts tend not to work very well. 
---
And yet the same thing that happened when the player vendor/display case thing wasn't addressed for over a month suddenly got attention and response once people started stopping their Fallout 1st sub. 
---
Hell, it even pushed Bethesda to offer a free bundle on the Atomic Shop, as cynical and low-effort as those recoloured items may have been.
---
I've met a few people who were. I know not everybody is interested in that aspect of the game, but some are, and that's enough for me. I also enjoy exploring other players' camps, which is something you can't do in 4 without downloading and installing them first, which reduces the joy of discovering them.
---
The cool thing about 76 is that even after the patch comes out most of the stuff is still broken
---
Maybe if you stopped abusing your dead fish, it would like you more....
---
&gt; Haha.  I love your sauciness. 
---
And I love your username!  I remember seeing your posts and comments here back in the early days and it always makes me laugh
---
Uny +1s? That's what mine is and have sheilded underarmor adding more strength
---
The wasteland is always more tolerable with friends. Be them high level or low
---
Also, watch out for the assholes that will complain that you didnt get the 'experiance' since you got help. Weirdly seems to be more of em now than ever
---
For kids!
---
Lol funny how PVP has been getting nerfed to shit soon as camps get nerfed everyone flips out, why don't you nerds go play sims this is a wasteland
---
I for one, cant wait until they fix magic shotguns.. the melt will be glorious...
---
What's the fast travel bug?
---
So they killed you at the workshop. You spawned at your camp. They fast travelled to you and then destroyed your camp. Do you live next to the workshop?
---
Wait.. why did this get down-voted? It's probably not far from the truth. 
---
Add content that we should already have, and fucking charge us for it. The Bethesda way.
---
&gt;And yet the same thing that happened when the player vendor/display case thing wasn't addressed for over a month suddenly got attention and response once people started stopping their Fallout 1st sub.
---
That is just speculation.  They didn't address it til they did because it took them that long to sift through the spaghetti code and found something to do about it.    
---
Furthermore that's an actual exploit as opposed to you just not liking the event.
---
Noticed that a "tented" LITS on PS4 was unplayable after a few rounds due to the extreme FPS drop. Only way to even move is to not face at the meat piles and attempt to stagger far enough away for things to normalize again. I'm guessing this is intentional on B's part as this was not the case prior to patch 21
---
This. There was no reason for the restriction. If you are a builder you already spend hours building these things. Now it will take longer if you use these methods and some things can’t be built anymore. They made us now jump through hoops to build what we want when it used to be simple and quick.
---
I've stopped buying atoms since F1st was added (I've never had F1st). This was going to be the update that I'd have bought some more atoms, but among all the other things endlessly listed in the sub since patch 21 hit, my main issue is that I can't buy the junk fences separately.
---
Put the prime receiver on the ultra ammo is the only way to run .308.
---
I wasn't really expecting anything, nor do I really need anything, honestly the worst part of their rewards are the useless grenades. why are we still getting grenades, missiles and 40mm rounds?
---
Happens to me too. Never had any issues with fps before. But now if there are lots of meatpiles FPS drops very low.
---
What about just making it?
---
All these posts like this like the devs give one single fuck lol
---
Not only that, but they implemented the exact same "fix" in update 20, and it didn't stop Ward from wandering around Foundation.
---
i7-8700, 1080ti, 24gb of ram, game is on ssd. Its not on my end.
---
Definitely! I’ve been pleasantly surprised by how not toxic the community has been in my experience so far. And I’m not out to impress anyone so thankfully I have no such insecurities, lol.
---
Bethesda: we made this adjustment, and here is why.
---
Karens: we don't like this, and demand a response.
---
Bethesda: ...
---
Karens: this is abuse, plain and simple. this injustice cannot stand.
---
Probably means that diseases should be permanent with it on. Says so on the serum text.
---
What changed is the possibility to drop legendaries that are in the purveyor loot table. Like the fixer, it gauss shotgun if you have the plan learned
---
Also heard 2* &amp; 3* legendary items can drop now from events that would usually only drop 1*. Not 100% sure on that yet
---
Thanks.
---
Replace the hole development team with them
---
Cool. Thanks for the feedback. I haven’t received one in a couple weeks and was wondering if others were experiencing the same as me. I’ll keep trying
---
It's not just the camp building getting dumbed down, too.  The re-working of enemy spawns in so many areas has eliminated much of the challenge to the game.  I basically walk through most areas like the Terminator now.  I'm really afraid of how badly "One Wasteland" is going to fuck it all up.
---
Nope still have access to some of them. Even the new pallet wood thingy from the hunters bundle.
---
If you think there's zero benefit I hope you don't plan on participating in the second Meat Week or claiming the BoS collectron.
---
People don't understand what fascism is, and either think it's synonymous with Nazism, or they use it in place of "authoritarian," when that makes about as much sense as using "communist" in place of authoritarian, which is arguably more accurate.
---
Oh gotcha. Thanks for the feedback. I’ll keep trying
---
Give this man a raise
---
I haven't personally tried it myself, but somebody posted a reply here stating you could actually do it with the clean sink...but you could catch diseases I guess. ;)
---
I would but it doesn't make enough rounds for what I need them for
---
Glad to be a Steam player haha.
---
This is the way.
---
Y'know before I started playing 76 I played star trek online, I complained a lot about it from its nickel and diming and recent lackluster updates but credit where credit is due, at least they release patches weekly instead of waiting for a freaking month or more.
---
lol  LMG user huh?
---
I just got off the phone with Bethesda. They are sorry and didn't mean to hurt you.
---
highway by Robco, so while there is some slope but very little, but it might just be that. 
---
Either way, i've got the concrete tire wall which are as tough, and cost like 1/5th so phooey to the (s)crap walls, maybe hen they can be bothered export the junk fence gate I'll take a second look.
---
So gun-fu is causing the vats issue? Thats bad. So adrenaline is broke and gun-fu breaks vats. So stacking damage is fucked.
---
All this effort you put into posting this, and the devs aren’t even gonna see it/care about it.
---
I didn't see the spoilers so my deception watching the beers and the sugarbombs in my inventory after donating 5000 steel has been devastating
---
Also imagine a  server of player houses made out of pathing issues. Invading critters or mobs confused to working out double walls. The game trying to accept two clipped walls into one space. Though none of this would have been a problem If they listened to anyone since the birth of fallout4 build system. We just want triangle floors,ceilings and interior walls. Freaking basic. How hard would it be to put one guy on adding those three things  to five tile sets. It just seems so lazy to have it all there and just stop short. It’s clearly a massively popular topic considering half the store is buildables.
---
Bethesda's behavior post-Wastelanders has alternated between abject incompetence and being nakedly predatory.
---
I actually enjoyed the Wastelanders stuff quite a bit, it was reminiscent of Fallout 3. But the grinds that come after, the time gating, the failure to fix perks and legendary effects, the horribly unrewarding events. It's too much and frankly makes me feel like an idiot for putting up with as much as I did, for as long as I did. 
---
I've been on sabbatical for a month, I'm going to remain away from the foreseeable future. My sincere hope is someday this becomes a game worth playing again but given Beth's priorities the past several months I do not hold out much hope.
---
I already have a prime Gatling gun, I just need regular .308 rounds for my LMG
---
Thats a fat rip then, let's see how long for them to fix.
---
Yeah I’ve finished all the challenges so I’ve been hoping to earn some through the events. Haven’t received one since the season pass started and was hoping it wasn’t bugged out
---
from 144 to 10 when looking at a couple of meat piles, did they change any thing about them or what?
---
Correct! Chews through them like a fat kid with cake
---
Bethesda: "have you tried turning it off and on again?"
---
Lmfao, if only Beth would even look at me XD Honestly at this rate I’ll take her ugly stepsister Stacey...
---
Because small fixes fills the update list so it looks... Filler.
---
(Donates steel, opens crate)
---
(drops floater grenades)
---
(Donates steel, opens crate, drops floater grenades)....
---
"Woops, pulled the pi-" BOOM
---
Minus “All these posts like this” ;)
---
Welcome to Bethesda!
---
But seriously, give FO76 to the ESO devs.
---
They’re useless for people that use them as well. This is not a bad idea though
---
Todd has your money and doesnt care about u guys anymore the next game is gonna be half assed so dont get your hopes up
---
We should all quit and play WoW classic
---
I’ve received maybe 4 badges out of a total of 30 completed missions.  So yah, something is going on.  I do operation tidy/ stings and things daily (sometimes twice with the latter). And I haven’t seen a drop in about 3 weeks.  I also do campfire tales anytime it pops up and nothing...
---
I guess thats plausible. 125 million isn't a whole lot when you put it into perspective.
---
Argh 😖 I wonder if foundation stacking still works.
---
no just standing at my workbench. even in the armor bench menu when it applys it shows nothing?
---
combat shotgun, w/Excutioner effect (-\_-) Can't get a good legendary shotgun, If I reconfigure my build, it may help find the best shotgun to work with it.
---
I will. (Note to self, get some friends.)
---
I run a lmg. The only way you can keep it fed is using ultra .308.  It is a much better ratio of mats to ammo.
---
Just cancelled my sub also, for the 1st time in months, i didnt feel like logging in this morning after beein hyped for the BoS return, what a f\*\*\*ing letdown..  12k steel scraps, got 5 shitty plans and a bunch of booze and grenades, im done donating, screw it
---
Wait, what? Where is this meat girl?
---
Just nuke it my myself too.   
---
For me after I get S.C.O.R.E level up to 100, then it's adios from me until we get more story missions and stuff to do with friends. I got 200+ unplayed Steam games in my list.  
---
Ad Vinum!  [https://imgur.com/a/jecbKoQ](https://imgur.com/a/jecbKoQ)
---
I'd say then they shouldn't have unbanned the dupers if they don't want items duped.
---
oh that me too everyday on the phone about 100 times...LOL!
---
Yeah, I think there needs to be more building freedom, but I enjoy having my camp and take pride in it when I do build one. 
---
Gave up atm because bugs prevent me from placing/moving anything without having to pay to move my camp and start all over, but hopefully I'll feel motivated to try again.
---
Either way, the servers would be so bogged down if everyone built everywhere, and the nukes..
---
I say keep the individual placements, but add some more freedom and fix the damn bugs.
---
Its an urban scout mask ive had prob since the first month of the game. Atonic camo paint applys just fine.
---
Like? I used it today and they seem mainly fixed
---
Understandable. But that hardly makes it special, because every issue seems to be complicated to address without causing more issues in this game (or maybe, engine, or maybe, content managing used in development).
---
Can't Bethesda just swallow the biter pill and allow modders to fix their issues like they have always done?
---
Well they should, not paying VAT is a criminal offence.
---
I'll have to see if I know the prime receiver for it
---
Top xbox games is a good one to build on, as For Honour is near F76 in popularity according to Microsoft’s most played games chart.
---
For Honor had it’s largest constant player base in Aug 2018 at 216k players. This was reported by Ubi directly as being a little over 1 million active players. So this number listed on steam was 1/5 of the player base. The number has since dropped down to 4K users, meaning for honor is really working with somewhere around 20-40k players now and is still in the most popular charts by F76. Even if For Honor is double that it’s still no more than 80, and that’s without game pass help. FO76, with fudged up number because of random gamepass players trying it out and dropping it it for something else.
---
I really just don’t see a way that the 400k suggested is at all possible, given what we’ve seen this month.
---
I doubt if any of the individuals in community management or development are at fault. Community managers can only promise action if they know the people they pass it to will take action.
---
I think it's more likely the fault of how Bethesda are structured. Indie developers do these sort of things really well because the community manager usually has a personal relationship with the devs, may even be in the same room. Somewhere like Bethesda it wouldn't surprise me if they weren't even in the same city with some level(s) of middle management getting in the way of the whole community/devs interaction.
---
Huh? Serums have nothing to do with diseases.
---
That's fair enough. I didn't mean to sound rude btw  :)    it's just funny it comes up each time but we don't ever prove anything.
---
Perhaps there's genuinely an effect on only some people but not every one? That sounds *unlikely* but not *impossible*.
---
WOW!  A bleeding shame.
---
My double staircase was causing irreparable harm to everyone on my server.  I'm worst than the most evil person you know.
---
If they let us have our glitched walls to run wallpaper they won't be able to sell us their new double sided wallpaperable walls.
---
From where you're kneeling it must seem like an 18-carat run of bad luck.  
---
Truth is...the game was rigged from the start.
---
Ima jump to
---
I am also still here...
---
Using herbivore, thanks for the clarification.
---
Got 'em.
---
Do the stings and things quest.
---
Yep. Me too. I honestly just save it for a Target worthwhile. Otherwise I just make 50 cal. I'm always on the hunt for 308. Super mutants drop it a lot but it takes a while to rack up a thousand rounds that way. Even the ammo converter is bad for it. Add me I am on PS4. SinistrMark. I got a bunch of high-level friends that run melee, Commando, whatever. I'll see how much they have.  Every time I get to like 1,500 rounds im like "Yes!!!" and I burn it all in like 5 minutes LOL.  
---
I have one of those magic lmgs so I'm going to try and see how it does in the SBQ solo.   Usually it gets too laggy on a public server for the magic effect to kick in so I'm going to try it on a private.
---
VATS is useless in PvP - a stealth boy will sort that out. Free aim all the way!
---
Dont talk shit bout my pa-jamies
---
I normally get \~60 fps, and also drop to 10 or so with few of them on screen. If i turn away from them everything goes back to normal. No idea what the hell they did this time. I suggest you too make a official bug report.
---
 [https://help.bethesda.net/app](https://help.bethesda.net/app)
---
Stuck as well. Xbox
---
dang
---
I assume this is sarcasm?
---
Oh no, they use the complaints to make sure they don't touch the things the community needs fixed. 
---
And they know what things aren't being complained about and decide to fix those.
---
I swear they are so ass-backwards and it wouldn't surprise me if they got their inspiration, to piss everyone off, from those tickets.
---
Ty.
---
&gt; They didn't address it til they did because it took them that long to sift through the spaghetti code and found something to do about it. 
---
No, actually that came afterwards. If you follow the reddit posts, they responded very quickly (Bethesda, not just the CMs saying that they're aware of the issue) stating that they're making it a priority and will address the issue. However, it took weeks after that before we got the actual fix and apology bundle.
---
You're right in that it's speculation but it seems odd that there was zero real response to the issue until a number of posts of people dropping their subs and posting screencaps of proof that they did and then suddenly a direct response from Bethesda.
---
&gt; Furthermore that's an actual exploit as opposed to you just not liking the event. 
---
That's just an intellectually dishonest comment. It's not just an event people don't like (though there is some element of that too). It's being used as a vehicle to show the community's displeasure with recent events.
---
If scrap weights nothing it becomes absolutely worthless, I get where you are coming from but I tried using a weightless junk mod for fallout 4 and it took out all the challenge from the game, I know 1st users can just plop down their tent but most have their tent placed like a secondary camp to save fast travel cost therefore making them think twice about moving it just offload some junk.
---
Yeah, the sea of salty tears will be limitless that day, reddit will have a few dozens of "Give us back magic weapons or Ill cancel my non existent sub!!".
---
I can agree that number is on the lower end, but FO76 is a subscription service game that requires a good portion of time to be worth logging in. I don’t think we’re looking at a lot of players logging in a couple hours each day as much as players spending most their free time trying to complete the multiple daily challenges and events. Perhaps early on before bullion and legendary run, but it’s taking more time to just do daily quests, much less the actual game.
---
Here are the inputs you need to calculate:
---
Number of players playing right now (we know steam, so how many on other platforms?)
---
How long do players play for on average?
---
24/average playtime* active users right now will give the estimate.  It’s not plausible IMO that only 40k people play right now. Average playtime would need to be close to 20 hours lol
---
Are you trying to shame people without actually knowing them or the circumstances they work in?  Go wild on Todd and Bethesda leadership, but going after development people who are probably hard working individuals who are stuck working with an antiquated system combined with poor leadership goals is tacky as fuck.  It's like yelling at a customer service rep on the phone when they are just trying to do their jobs in the environment they are stuck in.  Shitty behavior, trying to shame people.  Just real shitty.
---
Again, leave a bag of dog poop on Todd's doorstep all you want, but don't belittle the actual people who probably do care how the game works, and put their hearts and souls into it.
---
Instanced buildable areas are coming, it's on their roadmap. Not sure how they will implement it though.
---
They stopped it so they can put double sided walls in the atom shop. And charge you for exterior paint.
---
Cork will be the defining one to tell if they're fudging the numbers.
---
Sure, some people might be boycotting the whole event for reasons. Others may not be turning in steel because they feel they really definitely need a stockpile of 30k steel.
---
For others though, steel is an easily acquired resource, so they may as well chuck some steel in the box - its not like you cant get 500 more from going through westtek once.
---
Cork however is not as easy to acquire, and doing so is more tedious - shooting SM/mole miners is "fun". Picking up golf balls is not so.
---
So while I dont mind scrapping all the (hundreds) of assault rifles I get through normal play and chucking the steel in to get a few random plans, I'm not going around picking up golf balls to do that. Especially as 250 steel is 13 assault rifles. 250 cork is 250 golf balls. Fuck that.
---
This is literally in the patch notes.
---
What do you expect? Bethesda is a small indie company crowdfunded by Patreon.
---
It fits with the SS armor to actually look good. Using the SS armor with other underarmors looks like you have no shoes on.
---
I’m still trying to figure out how. Xbox.
---
And to be clear, i'm just trying to pinpoint the root cause of the issue.  
---
People are used to the previous entries in the series (and elder scrolls) - you go out to a dungeon/location - kill the enemies, pick everything up, keep items you know you'll need and sell the excess. 
---
Now having no caps works fine in a single player game, since no one cares if you finish in one day or one year, the content is there and that's it. 
---
Here the caps serve multiple purposes.  Having a ceiling on how many caps you can carry does have some positive effects on the economy.  No one can sell a bloodied fixer for millions of caps if you can't carry millions of caps.  Some of the other caps do two things - one, yes it encourages you to log in every day, but also two, it slows progression down.

Now wanting people to log in every day and slowing progression down makes sense in a multiplayer game.  Lots of games do that (such as WoW with their dailies) and it's not the same as the time gating that mobile games do since there's (at this time) no way to spend money to remove those gates (only one is the stash limit, and that's for scrap only).  The problem is with the way the game is right now those limits are tied to the ONLY reason to play. 
---
What the game needs right now are two things:
---
* First, We need more events like the Operation Atlas, but done right. One that is actually rewarding, permanent, repeatable, and that are varied.  For example, let's say that we add an NPC to Crater that collects Buffout.  You turn in 30 buffout and you get "something".  Preferably something consumable (and not dupable) so you want to come back.  Maybe it could be scrip. Maybe if you increase the amount you get a legendary module.  Then you have a reason to keep playing all day.  You go out, buy buffout from other players, go hunting for buffout, buy buffout from vendors, and even hunt down ingredients to craft your own buffout.  Even if the vendor cap limits remained, the scrip limits remained, the bullion limits remained - if there was no limits to events like this, then people still have something to focus on.
---
* Second, we need challenging content with random rewards.  If you've ever played games like World of Warcraft.  Imagine if West Tek was a challenging group event, that leads up to a powerful, named, supermutant that always dropped a legendary minigun or a legendary piece of metal armor and then has a rare drop of a unique minigun that has a unique appearance, name and maybe even legendary effect.  Maybe all the prefixes are the same on the other drops all the time, maybe one is set and the others are random.  And it has to be challenging.  Not the kind of thing you go in and solo and server hop twelve times.  Don't put a limit on it, but make it hard so it's not a 5 minute rush through.  Something you are actively using chems, food, etc. on.  The vault raid they added almost got us there.  The cursed weapons they are adding almost getting us there.  The fact we now have group instances is almost getting us there.  They just need to take that extra step.

(to the tune of Love Shack)
---
Fish slap, baby, fish slap
---
Exact same thing happens to me. I get the score of popups like 5 minutes later when I get out of it.  Its Bethesda!!!🤷‍♂️
---
Just found out why my strength dropped by 2 and this was the cause...  time to switch underarmors I guess.  I can't fathom how changes like this happen unexpectedly.
---
thanks!
---
Well you ARE a wasteland veteran so I'm inclined to believe you. I'm not personally boycotting this event. There's just so much anger on this subreddit, all the time. It gets a bit unsettling. I'm usually more of the "silent" community member in the sense that I dont hate Bethesda and I'm not mad at the game. I play it more than I probably should. I guess it's nice to know the in-game community is the antithesis of reddit.
---
Are you worserer than duper’s? Even really really duping ones?
---
I've submitted about 5 tickets in my 76 life since the beta. Most the bugs are QOL issues, but the VATS is almost game breaking. 
---
Did they intentionally turn off damage in VATS in pvp too?
---
Happened to me. I was waiting to see later if it's only one of the daily quests, or if both will not trigger.
---
Same here went there yesterday and nothing.
---
Haha
---
Adrenaline is supposed to be fixed now
---
Lol what are you mama's boy? Just kidding, thank you for the comment!
---
It was a rhetorical question. It was more poking fun at the past reported glitches with the ghillie suit.
---
Sorry, my bad for not making that clear.
---
Just reported it also tweeted [bethesda support](https://bethesda.support) on twitter.
---
Looks like is another "feature" of yesterday update. I did today both foundation and davenport dailies without problems but when I went to crater it didn't triggered the daily quest there.
---
This honestly infuriates me to no end. Just make it work. Is this really that hard!? Like god damn Bethesda. Things like this are what really make me put the controller down.
---
yes i got one from both my dailies yesterday
---
No more c.a.m.p. only zuul
---
Fuck man I just built an airship and couldn't wait to start my next one. If I can't attach a slanted wall to an overhanging floor or roof how am I supposed to create that "fin" look? 
---
Wtf does this even improve?
---
It is a daily dude.
---
I only really occupy workshops on a private server if I want resources.  If there’s a daily for claiming a workshop on adventure mode, I claim it and leave.  They can have it, I don’t care
---
I mean, only Bethesda really knows. I can't truthfully claim that they do or do not rig these events therefore I cannot believe it so either.
---
Imagine being this upset because of a game...
---
enemy that you cant kill... they just stuck there on full health.
---
There are those who are Fallout 1st subscribers, who I think have more reason to speak up and have say since they are paying. Like, prioritize Fallout 1st members more of a voice by letting their feedback improve the game. From a transactional pov, if I am implementing pay2win type ish in a game, it is hard to tell who is using those features to enhance the game, or who just has a disposable income and wants to cheese the game. And as someone who does not pay for anything but my PSN subscription, I find myself not as offended by SCoReee mitagating what atoms were before: not easily persuaded on the atom shop: screw that, I'll make it a point to have the most haggard sort of camp I don't need to be bougie abt it lol. So with that said, it doesn't hurt me to use my atoms to advance across the board. Tbh, I think it is equally a slap in the face to not even use the atom store and just burn it on the SCOREEE BOARD and not even buy any atoms after the fact. It aint like oh shoot I used all my atoms to beat dr zorbo, guess I need to buy some atoms to make up for the ones I lost there.... Nooooooope. If i am that hard pressed, i'll see what challenges i can do to get some more atoms. 
---
The point is, I guess, how you want to invest your time and money, overall. I invest enough time in this game that I dont need to spend anymore money on it, is what im tryna say. Not to be dismissive of those who do pay for 1st. I suppose if I had a private server, i'd have way more legendaries to script and resources to burn... As far as the gold bullion thing, my ocd wont let me get another piece until i get the roll i want for the piece i already have. As this is happening i am in no rush to farm notes, since it takes so long to get the roll i need that i can sleep on turning in those notes as it already is adding up while i burn thru scripts on modules. Makes me laugh cuz i stop to remind myself... Hey i am already OP enough without this SS armor, but.. I guess it will be cool to have at some point...
---
Truth be told this event is great for newbie players who are doing melee builds, get tons of chems/grenades/plans/money quickly. Not so much for veterans. I think a lot of the choices made recently by beth. was with the idea of fo76 having a huge influx of new players from it being on xbox game pass.
---
It's not the only reason,since there are other platforms. However i think a lot of choices they are making is to accommodate newer players who are coming in from wastelanders and trying the game on game pass for free.
---
An example of this would be introducing the legendary run that kinda pushes players to spend atoms to play a game of catchup on the legendary run to get items they may want, as well as offering deals and sales on the atom shop. The miner mole event recently was more geared towards newbie players, as well as the rewards from this, as well as legacy bundles(grognak) being offered on atom shop at a discount with free items often. It's to suck new players in.
---
My instigating gauss rifle should one-shot kill a lot of things, but it ended up being a hassle. Went back to balistic ammo rifles and the Vats problem is no more.
---
Don't make me come for your dead fish too ok 👀
---
it's a good metaphor for what the game potentially could be, and what we end up with
---
Yep. Foundation and Davenport were available, but not Crater.
---
Same here :/
---
Haha, what? Source? I actually want to read about this. That scenario is not really surprising.
---
I noticed that too.
---
In your niche situation of comparing your camp to others as a competition, I suppose it could be considered an exploit in the world of vanity, which is not a tangible asset by the way, so my point stands.
---
Bethesda isn't about actual fixes. They only care about things that are easy or quick to fix.
---
Why do you think we have so many workarounds and patches that may fix an issue (eventually) but often don't address the underlying problem that causes a lot of these issues in the first place.
---
Oh I know that, it just not for the build I want. Since I'm a bloodied build with most mutations that decrease strength, and I don't really have lot of strength to begin with. I pretty much try to put up strength whenever I can. It's nice the finally updated it to be modified though.
---
100% this. More people need to be aware of just how stacked the system is against them. These calculations should be pinned on the front page of this sub until something changes. Thank you for doing this.
---
This type of game design is lazy and is what gives people a reason to cheat in the first place. 
---
I'd argue those odds are more of a reason to make a fuss than your walls not looking pretty.
---
I just take the caps and reinvest it into buying more scrap and junk from players.
---
Just for the record, this doesnt help.
---
Lol I can just imagine the character just blowing up the workbench and rag dolling.
---
I guess, otherwise why would removing building workarounds be more important than fixing bugs that were imported over from FO4, or broken quests, broken promises.  I mean doesn't law enforcement go after those nasty jaywalkers long before they bother to catch a serial killer.  LOL.
---
it's invisible
---
one step forward, two steps back. every update, same shit. yawn.
---
i know they changed it on the latest patch from 3 samples to one.  Did you start the quest before the patch and try and complete after?
---
The game board that unlocks at Legendary Run rank 100 is surprisingly large and pretty cool looking, however... applies to the wall behind the wallpaper.  
---
This happened using the Contemporary Walls and Slocum's Joe wallpaper.   
---
Pretty disappointing.
---
I slapped it onto the outside of my Red Rocket Prefab garage just to see it, and it works there because it hovers 3 inches off of the wall (like anything you try to place on the side of the RR Prefab)... however the game board is unable to be selected so I have to scrap/store the prefab to remove the game board from the exterior wall.
---
All of the fo76 community when Bethesda pulls the plug on the game allowing us to be free to do other things lol
---
https://youtu.be/rw9uNgvfJsY
---
same, anyone anyone know if I do the settlers quest instead will I be able to get into vault 79 or will I not be able to until I have done both...
---
so annoying I have done all the other side missions and saved the main story until last...can only do events over and over until this is fixed I assume...time to play another game I guess
---
He's the raider punk in disguise
---
Nope, servers running smoother than peanut butter for me. Better than normal actually, most of the STASH lag is gone for me now.
---
No silly you, 1st.
---
VATS is definitely messed up at times, but remember it’s still quite possible you’re also a problem.
---
You got plans!?
---
As wildly implauaible as expecting Bethesda to manage to keep this game's bug count below 50% without "fixing" them and create 2 others in their place? You tell me.
---
I cant even play! There's been a server issue for people playing through Xbox gamepass pc version where if its not on your c drive then it doesn't play but alot of people don't have room on the c drive as its usually like 30 gigs sometimes that are available. Frustrating. Its been a motnh now
---
Whatever happened to the super settlement system? You know the thing that  would motivate players to want to have more furniture from cash shop and build more of a cool "base" that BoS furniture would fit?
---
Fo76 is the land of unrealized potential.
---
I feel like this comment embodies my exact feelings and will be sadly overlooked by the majority here.
---
T65 headlamp was also noted as fixed and it is not
---
People are furious that you can no longer change a door into a wall or window. You can still change a wall into a window and vice versa, but can’t change a door into a wall. It prevents folks from doing double walls with wallpaper on both sides, but not much else.
---
Presumably the radioactive particles in the ground water also evaporate into the atmosphere where they form radioactive rain. We've seen "radioactive storms" where the sky turns green and everyone takes rads, which lends some credence to the notion that radioactive elements are not staying on the ground. Of course, the real answer is "because it's Fallout".
---
The button isn't even needed. Drop the ammo, get the points. 
---
The current design is so bad I have to believe there is something else going on...
---
Not everyone has more than an hour or two of free time a day lol. Average age of a gamer is 35. Being in that demographic and having multiple kids I can tell you, we have other responsibilities!
---
Also it’s not a subscription game. You *can* buy fallout 1st, but it’s hardly required.
---
it was for the future tech camp breaking glitch where you can't fast travel back to your camp
---
Wait for the next steps, the first one not counting.
---
Bethesda Developers are now officially called Bethesda “NERFERS”

everyone who complains about shitty running servers.. thats who...
---
You really are the worsterest!
---
Yes, BOS in 4 are fascist, or on the cusp of fascism, absolutely. I do see them as different from other iterations, although the depiction in 3 was sadly very uninspired (for example). What's going on in 76 is debateable. Showing up and shaking down people like some cartel is not a good thing.
---
I appreciate your eye-opening but it‘s coming way too late. People like you are cows that were already milked long enough by Beth to have a big fucking surplus of revenue on this shitfest they call a „product“. Ppl like you spending money on the ingame shop and being FO1st subs for years while bearing all the bad stuff the managers are doing without you reacting is the reason there will always be companies acting like this and the next Bethesda game probably being the same crap like FO76 - because people are cashcows with a big enough udder to be emptied before they unplug themselves from the not so fun milking machine.
---
Not everyone uses stealth boys all the time, before they nerfed it I killed plenty of people with VATS.
---
You can be a hacker AND have 1st you know.
---
Might have one for yea if your on ps4
---
You tha real MVP!
---
I wonder if the 267K community number are the amount of people actively participating.  I'm guessing that at least 50% of that number have moved on to other games.
---
I agree with a lot of what you are saying. Imagine if there was an update that said "patched an issue that allowed foundations to be placed in water" and players responded "of course you shouldn't be able to place a foundation in water, that was an exploit, stop whining" 
---
No, there was a function and it was taken away to further limit players for some unknown reason.
---
Where we differ- I don't see how anything camp-building related could be considered an exploit unless it affects others i.e. crashing servers
---
Duping is definitely an exploit albeit one with a positive effect on the game. I'm not a gambler. Rolling legendaries doesn't entice me to keep playing. I want to earn good gear in a practical way so I can actually get to the gameplay. In spirit, I don't agree with duping, but for many players it was a solution to address the ridiculous RNG non-content.
---
Again, I don't condone duping, but I agree with your explanation of what the issue was and why it was a solution for many.
---
I know full well what fascism means. In 4, it's clear the BOS is on the cusp of using violence as a means of politics control. Even look at their entrance until the area, all pomp and aesthetic display.
---
Probably insane, who in their right mind would continue to play this game with all its nonsense.
---
if rnd(100) &lt; 95 then hit!
---
They should have done what Square Enix did with FFXIV when it launched the first time and was awful. Take the game down, overhaul it, build it properly then write it into the lore as why it was scrapped.
---
I donated 25k
---
Cork has the highest payout for loss of atoms for BGS. Another double score event likely means less people having to spend atoms to complete the Legendary run. 
---
Which is likely why the cost is so high, BGS wants us to fail it or struggle, because it will mean more atom sales for them if it fails.
---
Some junk is piss easy to gather i'll agree, there are tons of guides available for farming it. Other junk like cork, not so much. There arent many good places to farm cork, which means if you dont stockpile ahead of time, gathering during that donation phase could be tough if you dont have a private server or access to a stash box. 
---
Which means again the alienated Vets and First members are expected to donate their junk for no incentive, so that hopefully we carry the community through the challenges.
---
So again, explain why Vets and First members should bother to donate?
---
When I already have 6 - 7 characters @ Max scrip and Caps. 6 characters fully decked and geared with 3* stuff. A mule and a half full of legendaries for long term storage and scrip exchange. Two crafter characters that know 98% of every plan in game.
---
And HUGE stockpiles of everything given as rewards from the Atlas Provision?
---
Im more incentivized to sit and watch the event fail and hopefully act as a wake up call that we are getting sick of recycled rewards, than to actually waddle my way up to Atlas and donate. And based off the posts and comments Im not the only Vet that feels that way.
---
And as a side note; I burn off my gunpowder after every play session making ammo, pick up and scrap everything that isnt nailed down and loot everything off mobs. Even after several hundred hours of playtime, I checked my stash last night and I had a little over 13k steel, 4k acid... and 516 cork that barely ever gets used for anything outside of the odd mod, and took several months to accumlate that much...
---
"Yepp BGS is fully connected with how their game is actually played..." /s
---
Yeah, but I didn’t have time to get any samples before the maintenance anyways

Not really, still broken, with two new issues that are new.
---
O.O I've heard of those.....Aren't they places where you while away eternity because you chased one idea and ended up eyeball deep in why flat earthers have asexual potluck parties with presidents and rhubarb plants?
---
ha! that's the first thing I thought of as well.
---
there should be, say, a .1% chance, every time we craft an explosive that it'll blow up in our faces :)
---
Sure, GT?
---
I don't have the flux to make any
---
I canceled my subscription the day I bought Fo1st (July 1st) and they charged my credit card anyway on Aug1st.
---
Just received one from stings and things
---
Oh man, hope it's not just me 😂, glad it's working better for you tho 👌
---
So, how are they fascist in 4 exactly? I earnestly want to hear your rationale. And I never said it was a good thing in 76, it was a necessity as literally no one would support them because the Brotherhood was forced to scale back patrols in order to face the scorched, and it would turn out that all those factions would say "the Brotherhood was right" and would fall to the scorched.
---
I'm just baffled at how an improvement made it much worse. I'd rather it go back to the way it was than deal with this new version. How does that even happen?
---
Tiny Lipid, (pfp is Avatar Korra)
---
Workshop FT has been broken, so I'm blowing 45 caps per fast travel between my camp and WSs, caps aren't a huge issue but it's awful.  Put the FT caps back into our vendor caps.  
---
You can't loot things at events if someone is using a plasma weapon which makes the goo that covers meat piles.  Worst examples of this are at Radiation Rumble, Line in the Sand (which is majorly glitched and all the nurses now spawn in front of the sonic gen) Uranium Fever and Campfire Tales.  Same goes for ash piles.
---
CAMP budget is already so tight that running an extra 2 wires and conduit will break my camp. 
---
Oh and I get spawn fucked anytime I travel to someone's camp.
---
&gt; Pass things on to ~~the developers~~ the void.
---
Ah yes, the hero that is `/dev/null`.
---
In all seriousness though, I only started playing the game since it released on PC game pass (~1 month ago) and it's still as bad as I was expecting. I can't even *imagine* what it was like at launch, and this seriously isn't helping their case.
---
I have a similar thing! I just crafted my first bow last night and that thing is a nice one shot kill to most enemies. Too bad it doesn’t work in vats. I gotta practice my aim for this one.
---
Another day in Fallout 76:
---
Ahaha you’re probably right. It’s most likely a combination of both.
---
The receiver or the ammo?
---
You'd think by 2020 maybe the MMO format would evolve more, but nah. Honestly, this is the same pattern as any MMO game. A new patch is released. Things get nerfed. Ppl get pissed, complain. Some leave. Another patch comes out. One thing got fixed, twenty other things get broken. At some point, you just experience enough of the game that things change. You see past the illusions and shit. Man, it's weird to say this, but in retrospect, I almost feel like an old head referring to MMOs in the early 2000s. I played Vanilla WoW up to WotLK... Things kinda went in a direction where I felt the game had become too easy, too friendly for newbies (make them do the work!), that, lEEEgit, I sold my account for $1200 and was like okay cya I won the game dont need to keep playing another 3 years winning it
---
I had to google this one when I got first.
---
Three questions. 
---
1. What exploit took double sided walls? 
---
2. How long does it take to slap the code for wallpaper walls on two sides of a wall?
---
3. How many atoms are you going to charge for the interior walls in the atom shop?
---
I die a little inside whenever someone says “I’m cancelling my fallout 1st membership!” 
---
1. Why were you subscribed in the first place? It’s fallout 76. 
---
2. Your subscription is what encouraged the complacency and lack of care with the game’s stability. Don’t give them money
---
So, every other faction in the Commonwealth literally skulks around or is dead without the PC, the BoS comes in actually declaring their intentions, and they're the villains?
---
A few people say something like that. I won’t do anything like that in my next thumbnail - sorry.
---
^ Sucker born every minute...
---
Dude that's freaking amazing!@@
---
Seriously! It was supposed to be a reward, for goodness' sake! Now it's a chore. I'd rather just craft or buy what I need than try to deal with it, especially since most menus are a buggy mess to begin with.
---
and im out its been fun boys
---
I've seen a level 4,000+. His alt was 1023. His icon is the Raiderbwith pistols. This was about 90 days ago.
---
Well said. Your position is entirely understandable.  I'm not asking folks to condone duping, but to understand that doing so doesn't make those people evil. They're still members of our community, and many of the decisions by Bethesda that led them to take those actions are underlying problems for the rest of us in the near future. This is something we need to be aware of before more elements of our gameplay are limited for "reasons".
---
Thanks for bringing this to light
---
No, vats is completely fucked.  Melee vats fails 9\10 even with a 99%.  Any weapon with a spin up is basically useless with vats.  My cyro weapons useless with vats.  Which would be fine if it wasn't necessary to get 25-50 crits and week now.  I honestly don't remember if it was that bad during BETA or year 1.  Welcome to the Wasteland, if you need help or a team feel free to inbox me.  My husband and I play daily.  💜
---
I'm a little late here, it sounds like the way they did the rad interface might be causing the fast travel bug, or maybe something to do with saving your rad state before fast travel. I think I remember having the same problem when I was trying to farm mutations, but rarely before or afterwards at full health, I also a lot of frame rate problems while my rads were high.
---
That might be why they haven't fixed it as they can't reproduce it when they are full health.  If there any way we can loop in the Devs?
---
^ Cynical asshat shat out every other...
---
It might have been they fixed a serious issue with clipping through walls for creatures or other things as well and as a result this glitch was fixed. We should nicely ask them for more building tools instead of pointing the finger.
---
Hahaha I keep thinking about that one particular fix every patch that they come out with.
---
I seriously think they are punishing the community for complaining. Like, "Y'all just thought it was bad before! Check it out now!"
---
Took me a couple weeks to finally notice the prompt too.
---
The really need to update the help section in game.
---
Me too.  I use auto rifles with full Commando/Expert/Master.
---
I've been using 1\* Adrenaline, but never actually noticed it not working, only 1\* though.
---
Just added Gun Fu since the patch and still seem to be hitting targets most of the time, but I generally wait until it's at about 80%+ before firing.  Maybe a two shot auto handmade with 95%+ accuracy helps.
---
Laughed more than I should've!  Lol hilarious
---
Both
---
Or make the grenades themselves actually worth a damn? Using them feels like throwing those little popper things they sell with fireworks at people's feet to just startle them a bit.
---
K sure, you’ll get a friend request with something horseman88 sorry I forgot
---
9k was the peak, that means the average number is usually lower. That number has dropped to as low as 5k though. just generalizing would suggest the average is somewhere 7k for steam 
---
Bethesda had announced early on that the game was between 4-6 avg play time per a person
---
So 4-6 hours a day multiplied by 7k average player base is between 28-42k double that for a rough estimate of the console players and that’s 52-84k. My estimate is short of that math but still less than 1/4 of 400. Even if console was 2/3 the player base that’s still 70-126k at most.
---
But it’s also not as simple as just take a few numbers and divide. Players leaving their consoles on all the time, for instance, will make it seems like they played all day, when really it was only a few hours. Using that formula, For Honours math wouldn’t make sense either, even though it was directly reported by Ubi.
---
i had it an hour ago...
---
... but why not, why not make this atlas thing even more (vomit noise)
---
[edit: violent vomit noise]
---
I just wanted to point out that the green "Framed Invasion Poster" (with the alien "The Invasion From the Stars" on it) has a similar problem on most walls where the poster clips behind the wall, much like the Captain Cosmos Gameboard is doing.
---
You can find T-60 plans using Treasure maps.  That's why I buy up treasure maps when I find them in player Vendors.  I gather about 20 to 30 of each map then go on a treasure hunt as you can hit the same mound as many times as you have maps.  I usually end up with a lot of power armour plans this way.
---
I just think they should only work when they're powered on. That way we can just disconnect a wire.
---
There's a bug that causes it not to work at all despite reading 95%
---
Translation.  
---
Once we figure how much to charge we will bring back double walls.
---
Man, even ol’ Luke wouldn’t have been able to smile through this.
---
When did you quit?
---
it's a top* priority!
---
*with the exception of fixing picture frame bugs, "fixing" nonissues with CAMP building, removing special rewards from NW, and fixing all of the other things we broke in the last patch, one month ago. we also had time to basically make up an event overnight to deal with the overload of duped scrap in exchange for lootboxes with abysmal odds.
---
oh and don't forget our other "top priorities" from the past few months like crippling the SBQ and the auto completion bug.
---
but yes, *top* priority.
---
The new fix is still trash.
---
At least before, it wouldn't show ammo types you didn't have enough of to return.
---
Now, it just gives you an error message, "go get more ammo."
---
I have no doubt there were a few dubious individuals that took advantage of those walls and used them to cause lag. However, the question still remains - why aren’t you addressing other, far more pertinent problems that affect EVERYONE such as VATs? Why have these issues been ignored for years now? What gives?
---
It seems like the wall issue was something that could’ve waited until you had a suitable replacement mechanic in place. It has become abundantly clear that you are not a part of the community surrounding your own dame game, play 76 yourself and take an active role in engagement. It feels like we are interacting with a corporate Twitter account, not a community manager. This kind of communication is not cutting it, we should learn from *you* that the colossus event was delayed, not from the patch notes after the fact. You’re so far removed from the things that’ve been plaguing this game for years now and are, instead, leaving your dedicated long time players in the dust. Excuse me while I go turn in some steel to ATLAS for a fucking stimpack and beer.
---
You could retrigger the quest from a terminal as many times you wanted. This was a good method to bypass 150-200 scrips per day limit.
---
and when those double sided walls will be released in atom shop?
---
I mean, are you the one who decides what can and can’t be posted? 
---
He’s frustrated. And so is a lot more people. He’s voicing his opinion. He doesn’t like what Bethesda’s doing, and he’s protesting against it.
---
I’m bothered by someone on a high horse says that opinion and frustration doesn’t matter. But yeah dude, keep doing what you’re doing.
---
Stunning and brave.
---
That's nice.
---
abandon quest, start over?
---
Much worse than the wall problem is they made it so you can't place foundation pieces under any unattached roof or floor. I tried to build two buildings attached by a roof with a stream running between them and after I took the roof over the stream it wouldn't even let me place a foundation on the dirt below the roof till I deleted the roof. So not only can you not snap walls to roofs anymore before snapping a foundation under the wall, you can't even try to manually line up a foundation under a roof and then snap walls to the foundation. Same goes for placing roofs over unattached foundations. You can't extend a roof over top of an unattached foundation or wall piece. It just goes red and won't place.
---
 I haven't tried using the flamethrower to destroy the roof pieces yet to see if that trick works, but it's really difficult to get a flamethrower to the right height to destroy a roof (maybe destroying the attached wall will work though). That said the flamethrower trick is tedious and annoying and that's really not what this game needs more of.
---
Bye, I am sure you won't be missed.
---
My boyfriend and I play daily too. Doing missions together is like a date, and he’ll pretend like I’m his online xbox girlfriend when we first join a party, or he’ll say something like “hey girl, haven’t seen you in awhile” if we haven’t played for a day. It’s hilarious.
---
It was okay yesterday but not okay today. 
---
We recognize our changes had other unintended consequences.
---
Instead of rolling back in our source code repo, we are going to push forward. Like we always do. Always be pushing code even if it’s untested. Because this is Fallout, and would we not break immersion if at each and every patch we make there was some fallout from our community too?
---
Yeah but vats is fucking essential in workshops when you have 18 dogs across the damn Mega Stop, or ghouls stuck outside the junk yard.
---
They'd rather screw up camp busing for everyone than fix something that actually matters
---
Yeah man I hear you, I bit the bullet and Unsubbed yesterday too.
---
I just can’t believe play a game where I find I don’t use fast travel in the hopes of experiencing some content.
---
That's adorable.  💜
---
Yup I decided to make 30k .50 bullets instead!
---
Which is too bad, because Vats allow for non-fps players to have more fun in such a game. 
---
I found an instigator explosive handmade and i made it auto: good both for vats and non-vats at leasts.
---
Thank you for responding to the community. I am passionate about camp building and I must ask if there will ever be a way to switch doorways to different types of walls again?
---
It is still possible to build double-sided walls, but
---
the ability to switch wall types allowed for a ton of creativity- half-width hallways, placing doors wherever needed outside of doorways, circular structures, etc. Removal of this ability has crippled many builders. This was one of the most valuable tools to a camp builder. Will this ability ever return?
---
I tried it out again last night, will probably just end up dumping all my unwanted ammo and scrap the machine.  It’s garbage...
---
I'm surprised how many people are quitting over a few changes to how you build your CAMP. I give very few shits about my CAMP, I'm never there.
---
An event being delayed? Big whoop. All these Events and DLC have been free, and what exactly are you doing in between these events anyways? Do that. Play something else. Take a break from the game.
---
I cancelled this morning. Not ready to quit 76 but I feel some time away is definitely needed
---
Cancelled. But not quitting.
---
Fallout 76 died for me with this legendary run.
---
A new checklist to do, full of useless chalenges , taking lot of my precious time for challenges that if i miss one or two days it can spoil all my progress and the only way to compensate the days i lost is using atoms. and now with 80% less free atoms.
---
I really miss the game before Gold bullion/ Score grinds.
---
I used to play arround with my friends in my few available hours , now iam taking most of my time to do some useless activity like claim 5 workshops or leveling in NW.
---
While score have issues like auto complete bug , they should make every weekend with double score instead of making a useless community chalenge to unlock it.
---
Fallout is taking bad decisions trying to be a destiny. Fallout kind of gameplay seems much more like a skyrim/ the sims that people play hours and hours for fun and not for unlocking cosmetic stuff or perfect gear.l but they keep trying to make it the new destiny that enncourage grind for competitive purposes. And fallout 76 its so broken that bethesda should accept it and make at least fun to play like it was before all these new currency and score system.
---
Already posted avg playtime by Bethesda in the other comment. For every 35 year old with a job and kids, there are teenagers, retirees, or ppl with fewer time restraints that make up for that groups lack of time. 
---
It’s built like an MMO, which is what I had said. There are multiple daily checks required for continued content, which alone take at least 2-4 hours. And there is still a large player base that with memberships. 
---
While it’s not required, this isn’t a game built for only a couple hours of play and then just log off. It’s a major time sink.
---
still have mine. are you looking in intelligence?
---
Cool, so we’re going with conspiracy theories now not even a day into the event
---
I'm not using gun-fu or adrenaline and I'm still missing shots like crazy
---
Did u do a giveaway?
---
Yes, they have: [Here.](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i4951h/recent_camp_fixes_in_update_21/)
---
Dont worry, Ill buy one instead of you.
---
Fucking cry more...jesus christ..............
---
No according to my dad, Those are socialists, and he's not entirely wrong. The minutemen are the only way.....
---
By the way a settlement needs our help i marked it on your map.
---
It’s so much worse now.
---
I'm still gonna play, but I'm gonna let my FO1st expire more than likely until such time I feel they are listening more to us.
---
Dude I’ve been back on this game for only a week and time and time again I will use my shorty to shoot something point blank in the chest and the mob just ignores it - no hit detection - no dmg. 
---
It’s more than VATS it’s their whole crippling game engine.
---
Dude no. I've played both of these games quite a bit. Fallout 76 is not at all comparable to ESO. F76 is an absolute shit show in comparison. ESO is one of the better mmos out there right now and the pvp I way different and better.
---
I don't have gun-fu. All of my perk cards are for scavenging and carrying capacity. And vats still misses with me.
---
Hold down the back button. This works on every terminal.
---
well idk if there is a sum-up of the whole process, i was just soaking up every infos i could get about the fallout franchise. the info that fallout 76 were once a private project of a single developer without any order of the lead developer were once said by todd howard himself as the game was announced at some game-convention.
---
"The idea for *Fallout 76* arose out of a desire to implement multiplayer into the *Fallout 4* engine. Eventually, a decision was made to develop this as a standalone project. " --&gt; [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout\_76](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76)
---
the thing about cashcow is literaly self-explaining, watching how bad the publisher or developer are interacting with us player is one of the worse i ever saw in a video game (as example, bethesda's senior vice president of global marketing and comunication Pete Hines were deadly silent for months right as the game got released, the only posts he made in public were some advertisment for eso while he advertised fo76 as the best and advanced game they ever made).
---
also they lied pre-release about literally anything, 16x the details etc.
---
remember the canvas bag power armor edition? yeah, the one who was advertised as real canvas and ended up being cheapest plastic? they claimed that the material cost were too expensive, but a few weeks earlyer they invited some influencer to the real whitespring hotel and GIFTED real and nice canvas backpacks filled with high quality merch to everyone...
---
i could proceed with way more then 100 examples, i don't know sources to read tbh. but, i know some mentionable videos!

---
Hold down the cancel button.
---
Nope, none. 
---
Though, you could take Grafton Steel and use the event's, mobs, etc. for the Daily Legendary Run achievements and use the scrapped weapons for Fortifying Atlas.  That way you are mixing several different acheivements/awards in one.
---
Confirmed for me too.
---
An attempt to have a higher level of discussion with some of these people is futile.  Thankfully, however, this seems to be a day where there are more people willing to listen. Rock on and do you.
---
I cancelled mine and haven’t logged into the game in about 6 weeks. Waiting for new content.
---
I've played both. ESO is far better quality, polish, more content and a far more competent and larger dev team. F76 unfortunately is not comparable.
---
its not a bug, it was like this from the introduction of the converter.  
---
i dont that its okay, it should access the stash also, no doubt.
---
No issues on mine
---
April fools
---
yea that thing still sucks balls...i have Bandolier and I'm still thinking of just dumping all my ammo I never use to save the minuscule amount of space it takes up because it's infinitely faster to just mine the mats required to make my ammo...and FAR more of it...
---
Brick or crash? Brick means the system no longer turns on properly, whereas a crash is usually data colliding in a negative way in which the application can no longer function without restarting.
---
One has to be born for every one of you so we can let you know when you are doing stupid stuff with little to no thought behind it.
---
That's really what it sounds like.
---
BYE
---
At this point Fallout 76 code is probably equal or worse to yandere simulator...
---
I don’t give a shit about building or any of the stuff being delayed. It’s more of the fact that they’ve consistently shown that they don’t give a shit about you or your concerns for very obvious things that need change or to be fixed. I’m not quitting the game, just simply not giving any more of my money to a company that blatantly disregards important community concerns.
---
Well this is great for those still on the rep grind then...
---
The thing that really irks me is that Bethesda has such a great community that is ready, willing and able to do their job for them. Bethesda can make so many improvements to their games just by looking at the most popular mods on nexus. It's such a shame that Bethesda will rather nickel and dime their customers than work with the community to make a truly great game.
---
Same here
---
They fucking with you guys
---
&gt; The bug just seems so .... careless 
---
You just described Bethesda - careless.
---
The exploit he refers to ,was that one where you placed a million walls in the same spot to lag the server. That was the 1st step of an exploit I don't even remember what was used for, but it was patched promptly ,as all the major ones.
---
I still want my freedom of building,not for the double side wall,but for all I could do with switching door"wall types and floating door frames.
---
Well, I was thinking the button was necessary as a safety mechanism, to prevent you from say, autoscrapping 10,000 rounds of precious 2mm electromagnetic because you accidentally put it in the box instead of that pile of 10mm.
---
Still doesn’t stop the problem of losing out on caps before you can back out of the server or stop the person from buying more items for that fact
---
I'm a new player but bows sucked even before this update in my opinion. Half of my arrows just sail straight through enemies without doing damage or just don't fly to where my crosshair is aiming at.
---
Double sided walls NEVER showed any performance issues, even 300% camp builds showed no performance issues. I'm sure there could be backend fun with that kind of camp, but they didn't come forward to me, or any of the hundreds who ive talked to who have come through my MANY different camp builds.
---
This is the reason there is a market. I’ve obtained most of my top wanted weapons over time by trading things I got that were valuable, but didn’t fit my build. Whining about the odds and stopping there is pure laziness.
---
I appreciate this but please DO NOT charge for this.
---
1. There was a budget exploit along with a player vendor dupe (heard a rumor about the thanksgiving display also able to dupe but never saw it first hand)  
---
2. Knowing them quite some time, a basic just framed interior wall would be easier to implement  
---
3. I would hope this would be a charity case as one of the largest draws is SIMS Fallout
---
You might have found this but players were noticing that it only hope happens when they low health builds, or have a lot of rads. 
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i1f9nn/comment/fzxl0zz](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i1f9nn/comment/fzxl0zz)
---
They broke much more than double sided walls. They placed more restrictions than they listed in the patch notes. I took a worshop this morning just to test and see what I could build and the changes are depressing.
---
Also you can still stack punji boards. They removed two methods, now just about 10 more methods to go I guess.
---
Stalin killed people, period. Not completing quotas. Telling him quotas could not be met. Not telling him quotas could not be met. Joe was a monster.
---
That said, I point out Joe was not a communist (you could tell just by looking at him at dinner time, compare his habits to that of Lenin). Not does he prove any value in capitalism (while I agree capitalism is basically unavoidable, due to the nature of humanity, he's not really a communist so much as an authoritarian dictator, and just because one system does not work does not innately prove a different system does).
---
If anything, we need to watch less for economic policy and more for legal policy. Because Stalin was very much an Authoritarian, and, well... *\*glances meaningfully at the news in the past few years\**
---
Have a good summer, keep in touch
---
It worked! Thanks.
---
The same goes with flat/corner roof pieces. You can no longer change between the two, which completely removes the ability to create high and multi-tiered roofing. If there are multiple variants of the same piece, **let us replace/change between them!** If they are going to showcase camps that use these "tricks" then they shouldn't remove them!
---
#**Any and all changes should be run through the PTS Server for testing and review before being implemented! No exceptions!**
---
Testing all changes would prevent countless problems, domino-effect bugs, and backlashes. My FO1st subscription lapsed today, and will not be renewed **until all changes are tested on PTS!**
---
Horse Armor anyone? Beth was rigged from the start
---
I think angry turtle did a video on this and it depends on certain weapons. If you click the vats button 3 times then vats works like it should.
---
I bought that new concrete wall paper because I had an idea for a little bunker I could make with it using double sided walls... oh well
---
The Minutemen isnt a way, they literally only exist by the PC, a single person, dragging them to their feet. They're very likely to end up with the same foundational problems as the Legion.
---
Just allow us to wallpaper both sides of every wall. If we want to wallpaper the *outside* of our buildings, then so be it.
---
You just gave us a cinderblock wallpaper, it only makes sense for this to be able to be applied externally as well as internally.
---
I subscribe to jam the bottomless scrap box with as much junk as I can gather or workshop for a month, then unsubscribe and live off the bank for a month.
---
kinda like my financial situation in real life.
---
so in other words, this bug has never been fixed? This is in no way can be explained as a "feature"
---
So u/LunarChemist found a fix. If you analyze the sample before putting the fuse in it works.
---
So this wasn't just me last night. I though I may have just been on a laggy server or something.
---
Yeah I was going to wait and see what they do about this but decided I'll just resubscribe to 1st *if* they do anything about fixing how badly they broke camp building. Cancelled my monthly sub this morning.
---
The rewards are a crummy uniform to help indoctrinate you into their cult.
---
Yes it is 100% the meat piles tanking the FPS I made a post about this yesterday I hope Bethesda fixes this it’s unplayable
---
This is the exact sentiment people had on release, and the game is nearly 2 years old now. If your still playing the time to feel “betrayed and angry” has come and gone imo, the possibility that Bethesda would only further their low effort high cost policy after release was always very likely. If your not willing to keep sticking with the game through disappointment after disappointment just stop playing before you get disappointed again.
---
[They did.](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i4951h/recent_camp_fixes_in_update_21/)
---
Wait, it's all just a Chore? &gt;Always_Has_Been
---
Ok, there's the communication.
---
Will it make a difference? No.
---
its may be glitched now.  hmm. if you havent yet, quit the game.  It usually sets you back in a quest one or two steps.  i did it once or twice on the main quest.
---
How do those Brotherhood boots taste, bootlicker?
---
Brick. The Xbox made a weird noise during fast travel and then completely turned off.
---
Ya it seems to be events with lots of meat piles
---
FWIW I never experienced any performance issues either, nor have I heard of any glitches surrounding them.
---
Um so yea, F*** the Brotherhood Fascists and Long Live the Free States
---
I have the same problem on ps4
---
I am also stuck, nothing to do with your PC
---
Do you really want to know why this shit takes a month?  Why we're going to be waiting a month for the next patch as well and for every patch after that for all eternity?
---
It's not because Bethesda's incompetent, it's because of the fucking consoles.  If this was a PC game we could be getting big updates and small hotfixes as often as they wanted or needed to release them.  Every patch no matter how big or small that touches a console game has to go through cert with both Sony and Microsoft to be tested for basic stability issues to confirm they won't flat out brick a console.  These certifications take time to complete and cost the developers money each time they submit one.  This is why every update we get is a hodgepodge of random crap all crammed together, because Bethesda has to wait and pile up everything  they work on over a long period of time and compile it into one big update that  they can submit for console cert.
---
You're not "wasting" your resources for a double score weekend, there's a whole fucking list of unlockable cosmetics, camp items, bonus events and sales of which the bonus score is just a part of.  Why would people waste their time on this shit?  Because they fucking did the same thing last year and no one whined like a little bitch about it.  Were you not around for last years summer community goals?  Where we did the SUUUUUUUUUUUPER rewarding task of killing millions of scorched and non-legendary scorchbeasts for a far more shit random collection of rewards, most of which were fucking icons and picture frames?
---
Also... you do realize that this game is NOT made by the same people that makes ESO right?  Fallout 76 is developed by Bethesda Game Studios while ESO is developed by Zenimax Online Studios.  They share a parent company in Zenimax and that's about it.
---
There was no active budget exploit, and none I've known ever with double sided walls. Even less so any dupes using them. I am interested in this claim though. I would love any information on this, as I feel any proof of an exploit that allowed duping OR budget exploit would fully explain their actions. It shows a huge disconnect from the player base that they removed a huge mechanic without a word.
---
I’ve been trying since yesterday right after the update. I have tried probably 30+ times with no luck.
---
Why yes, that is exactly what that is.
---
You are a genius. That worked and it is finally gone. Thank You.
---
Useless is the very definition of explosives in this game.
---
But I agree, let us scrap them.
---
Well, in fixing that, a useful error was also fixed. It was technically broken first.
---
Please add to the plasma caster that it's scope isn't aligned to the barrel's 'splitter" thingy, despite it working well after release but 2 patches ago it broke for whatever reason...
---
Rather make piles of 5.56. I gave it a second try and donated 4K on top of the 10k I had already done. I got 1 plan try for the gamma gun from 16 crates. Not a single plan I couldnt find at a npc vender.
---
I got two yesterday, one as a reward for Stings n Things, one from Campfire Tales, no idea what the drop rate is, but I run Campfire tales alot and getting one from that is fairly rare.
---
Why shouldn't we be mad at Bethesda?
---
Maybe it's just me but say I needed to fix this bug because it's causing legit issues (bearing in mind its been used since very early on with no real issues but let's just ignore that for a moment), you'd think that given it's such low impact or priority, you'd actually implement the feature for which the bug exists in the first place i.e. double-sided interior walls, thereby removing the need for the wall hack and then fixing the bug would be a non-issue.
---
There are so many bugs that are of a much higher priority than this wall thing and yet they don't get addressed but the one no-one asked for gets fixed, nerfing a much used feature by the build community days after a community activity of showing off your camp builds starts.
---
Let me just make this clear before I make this statement. I have almost 8000 atoms and Fallout 1st, so by saying this, I am not saying it because I couldn't pay for the option but.....
---
DO NOT MAKE THIS HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE ATOMIC SHOP OR FALLOUT 1ST.
---
This would be wrong and further alienate your community.
---
I think it's worth submitting bug reports and cancelling. The thing with the bug reports is... bethesda will likely just give a generic reply that their changes to camp building are intended and not a bug. There's only a really small chance the fact that tons of people are reporting it as a bug will make it to anyone who will recognize it's because people are pissed off and didn't want those changes, and an even smaller chance that they will care enough to revert them or remove the much hated build mode restrictions.
---
But you'd ruin the dirty water market!
---
honestly i feel like people actively search for things to be mad at bethesda for. i agree the game was not good at launch. i agree there is not a ton of end game content. other than that people actively nitpick everything that they do, lots of times for no reason in my opinion. if the game really pisses you off that much then leave because i don’t want to open up reddit &amp; have to listen to a bunch of people bitch about how they spawned in one persons foundation after 8 hours of playing. games have bugs, the bugs get fixed now calm down &amp; play it or don’t.
---
It's interesting to note that the backpack is a separate layer than the character model and outfit altogether, you would think they could scale it to the character model using the dimensions you select in the character edit screen. A lot of outfits will scale to your character, however some outfits have a preset body type. Backpack should take into consideration dimensions of current settings and adjust spacing accordingly.
---
76ers will be playing 76 and Cyberpunk. It just is
---
"Dammit Greg, this again?"
---
Same for me.
---
Yeah, once you exit all the pop-ups you missed start rolling in...I exited after hours of play and doing Line in the Sand....omg, it was like 10 minutes of pop-ups. Beth why!? xD
---
Good.
---
Cancelled as well
---
He’s making sure you don’t try it again 😂
---
Yes my wife had this problem last night after the update.
---
Zenimax owns Bethesda. That is the only reason why I bring up the game. The 2 subsidiaries off Zenimax Media - Zenimax Online Studio and Bethesda could've communicated about making this game better from start based on ZOS experience with MMO genre which Bethesda had none.
---
Zenimax isn't getting a slice of TES IP. They own all Bethesda IP.
---
Please give us back the camp wall fix
---
To save everyone an unnecessary click:
---
Hello everyone,
---
We want to acknowledge that we hear your concerns about the fixes we released for C.A.M.P. building in Patch 21. So many of you are incredibly passionate about C.A.M.P.s in the community, and we absolutely love the creations you share with us and everyone else. 
---
To give you more context, these fixes addressed issues that, while seemingly harmless on the surface, could and were being used by some individuals to take advantage of unintended exploits. Something we overlooked is how this would impact certain quirks in the C.A.M.P. building system. This is unfortunate, and it was not our intention to limit or remove parts of the C.A.M.P. system, but those issues needed to be fixed.
---
That said, we really appreciate all that you do and create, and we want to do right by you. The situation is not as simple as reverting changes, which could cause exploits and performance issues to return. However, we are actively looking into our available options to bring some of these building methods back to 76 in a more intended and secure way. For example, we’re discussing what it would take to implement double sided walls. 
---
We hear your frustration on this, we’re talking through what we can do to make it better, and as soon as we have more concrete plans in place, you all will be the first to hear about them.
---
As always, thank you all so much for your feedback.
---
Won't matter, because of all the Karens we have here.
---
Yeah. They posted it here a little while ago also.

🎖️ Have my medal pls. I'm poor. Do the community managers even read this subreddit?
---
I'd be rich with dirty money!
---
Thanks! That's good advice.
---
Well, they wear suits of power armor, so itd actually be treads. But I cant say I'd know, why would I taste my own treads?
---
And the story of failed Fallout 76 patches continues... they never learn and apparently they don't know a jack about testing and profiling.
---
Hackers in NW and hackers duping rare items making them less valuable.
---
Personally I used ONLY doors in all my builds to start them, think of it as an opened house plan, I can run from one side to the other etc. Then once I've set my room ideas I'd start closing it, turning the doors into walls.
---
That article seems a bit clickbaity. He didn’t provide sources. plus it was written 8 months ago, when the game had better numbers, and didn’t provide any sources. Looks to be a clickbait gamer piece
---
But PlayerTracker isn’t an active counter. The founders admit on their homepage that it’s just an algorithm that attempts to get close based on what they can find and is only really meant for analyzing market trends and not a live player count.
---
For instance, Brawlhalla currently has 22k players online on Steam. But PlayerCounter says there are only 16,930 despite Steam having the exact number listed.
---
This sounds like a bs response you'd get for submitting a ticket. Def canceling FO1st. Can't move my camp or I'm stuck with an ugly cube, can't progress the raiders questline. Literally all I can do is roll 150 scrip for something I don't want or side with the settlers which I don't plan on doing to get to the point I can actually earn bullion. This game has turned in to a steaming pile of shit.
---
So, you don't know how to fix the undeletable floating walls without nerfing the system.
---
Why not just let anything be deletable without the stupid rules?
---
Because they didn't go into this shit with the goal of fucking over double walls for the sake of fucking over double walls.  There's three different fixes in this patch aimed at issues with walls, at least one of those fixes either necessitated this change or inadvertently caused it. 
---
How the fuck is this so hard for people to comprehend this concept that they'd much rather go with the suuuuuuuuuper rational alternative that this games developers just like wasting their time fucking with their playerbase for no specific reason?
---
People are really crying over them fixing a bug. Just play fallout 4 online for christ sakes &amp; stop bringing down the mood of the community
---
This would be fine IMO, then they could bring out various exterior wallpapers like those bricks which would be cool.
---
This answer is not conclusive of what exploit the walls were providing. Please provide what exploit these walls were providing to the player base.
---
On the surface, this was a harmless option that allowed players an option for camp option placement of wallpaper. Please communicate and let us know what exploit was giving players or this statement is meaningless.
---
Just so you are aware, the player base doesn't trust you with how inconsistent and fraudulent your claims are when you are saying that your delivering positive content to the game. Bugs are still rampant from BETA that have not been fixed, and every piece of new content has been damaged and delayed. This is causing overlap for new events and game quests.
---
Yeah idk from the outside it seems like a easy fix. Pre update only some backpacks would work with that outfit and some would still float, but post update all backpacks seem to float. However increasing my characters body to the biggest they can be on the triangle makes the backpacks work and sit properly on my characters back. But then the outfit looks weird and stretched. annoying to say the least aha.
---
If you will still be using the PSN account on the new one than yes you’ll have all your progress from before still.
---
lmao what clowns
---
I think the chance is greater they will listen to someone offering a suggestion over someone who is whining. Even if it's justified whining. It's about choosing the best route to getting our voices heard.
---
We want them to feel encouraged instead of demoralized. We want them to be excited to serve us instead of dreading opening the wall of text that spews venom and negativity.
---
I run a two handed melee blooded build that **can** use automatic rifles with w 2 *3 commando perks and 1 3* tank killer, 3*Bloody mess, 3* Nerdrage, Starched genes maxed, and for mutations:
---
Adrenal reaction
---
Marsupial
---
Carnivore
---
Chameleon 
---
Talons
---
Twisted muscles
---
Electrically charged
---
That’s just off the top of my head. Will have to check after work.
---
&gt;only 2 build styles are truly viable so the demand for those weapons is vastly outnumbering supply.
---
Imagine being this breaindead and thinking Bloodied/Junkie is the only way to play the game.
---
This game is very easy.  You'd have to go out of your way to make a build that isn't 'viable'.
---
I use a double barreled shotgun for flavor and 1 or 2 shot just about any enemy,  I'm convinced half the people on this sub don't know anything about this game.
---
This actually made me giggle despite all the issues. Thanks!
---
So your answer to people duping by lagging the servers, which isn't even the common method and last I heard was patched out, was to break building which was the one thing your game had going for it  over other similar titles... double u tee ef man.
---
You probably would have been better off not responding at all.  This is disheartening to say the least and further proves you are completely out of touch with your player base.
---
I'm more pissed of that I can't change a wall in to a door frame and back again as I have a secret space that only I have access
---
Liberty prime was the powerhouse of the brotherhood in fallout 3 and 4
---
If you're gonna be like this about it, why even bother asking them to communicate?
---
I had to Google it
---
That's rough. I did get a weird glitch a few weeks ago which gave me the black screen bug, I too heard a weird noise before it happened. Decided to shut her down for the day and restart my systems. I don't own an Xbox so I'm not sure if you guys experience the same glitches and hiccups that we do on ps4.
---
Does it still turn on? Have you tried another game?
---
Sorry... already running an in game "cult" (used jokingly) of my own so sorry BoS. Already have the BoS Onsie.
---
That sucks man.  Good luck, I hope you find an answer soon.
---
Where can we report this?
---
I at least appreciate the acknowledgement of the impact to creative camp builders and communication.
---
As a matter of fact i do. However, great job adding to the conversation. Love that out of my whole post. Any number of things you could have replied too. You took the time to reply with a smartass insult.  
---
Some people  🤦🏼‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Alienated, outcasted, disregarded. Fill in whichever word you find better. Now I’m more then happy to have a mature discussion about the pros and cons of this game with people. but clearly your incapable of that. So good day to you.
---
Fallout 4 wasnt bad, they tried something new. It wasnt as great as F3 or FNV, but it was good. Its DLC strategy was disappointing and lackluster, but the base game was far from shitty, bad, disappointing, etc
---
I’m kinda happy there’s nothing special in the provisions. I wasn’t looking forward to more grinding to try and get plans with a .45% drop rate and blowing through all my scrap in the process.
---
Sure, because corporations are people and doublespeak isn't a thing. Give me a break.
---
My headcanon will just be that the downvote was because someone was afraid Bethesda might see the post and get the idea to do it from there.
---
Um, they made FO3 and Vegas.
---
...What the fuck are you on about lmao
---
What's your gut say my good man. Just curious about your opinion.
---
it was for sale
---
I loved 3 and NV, even enjoyed 4 way more than most. I started to get the whole greed thing after the creation club was added to Fallout 4. Still thinking about reinstalling FO4. I kinda feel guilty because I remember thinking it'd be super cool to have friends be able to play with and show my builds to. Well, guess I expected it to be the same but with multiplayer and it just isn't
---
I enjoy 76 a lot, but that's not saying much since I only started playing about 32 days ago, I'm sure I'll eventually reach the burn out point many people speak of.  (Already losing faith based on the handling of this most recent update, even though I want nothing more than to just love Fallout)
---
I really hope we can ditch the multiplayer after this, it really didn't work out
---
I just hope they revert ALL of the changes this patch made, and then some, and not just the double wall fix. They screwed up multiple build tricks with this patch (or maybe it was with another recent patch, but all I know is I can't do several things with foundations and walls that I could do before).
---
Despite all their changes you can still stack punji boards using several methods. LOL
---
TBH I don't even care about the punji stacking. As long as they don't allow them to stack on each other that's good enough to deter instadeath traps.
---
 One of the changes they made this time was to make it so that rugs won't stack on a punji board (or several other things, apparently, now either) because people were using rugs to stack them. So now they edited something with rugs that's screwed up a lot of the rug tricks that I was using for decorating.
---
Ugh, just so frustrated with this.
---
Exactly
---
I bought mine. Best decision ever. Can play freely without wasting time dealing with scrap 80% of the time. Can also gather more wraps and armor to sell. Keep on truckin!
---
They literally arrive to cause synth genocide, sounds pretty evil to me. And don't even get me started on them wiping out the Railroad despite them being hardly a threat or stealing from settlers.
---
Yeah I feel like its the paper bag, but with the texture replaced.
---
Same colliders etc.
---
They were part of it. But didn't own the rights back then.
---
Actually youre wrong, at this point Bethesda responded and claimed they directly had to fix double walls because of an exploit with them. Their goal was 100% to remove a very wanted mechanic, as you can tell its wanted by the outpouring of anger at its removal. They made a major change to the camp system we know without a viable work around or conversation with the players at all. This is our anger. Not they broke our stuff but, they broke our stuff and refuse to fix it.
---
Recruitment Blues can’t be completed until you register for the Army. With your certificate, you must now return to Charleston Capitol building to get your military ID. (The ID is your key to getting entrance onto the top floor at Fort Defiance.)
---
We have an official statement
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/422354/recent-c-a-m-p-fixes-in-update-21
---
i'm not 100% sure, but i noticed way less missed hits without.
---
i guess it's with healing factor and fast travel bug... without the mutation you encounter this bug less frequently, but you still do encounter it sometimes.
---
Current seam player count is 9,043
---
https://store.steampowered.com/stats/
---
Console players are more than what you see in steam. Steam doesn’t event represent all of PC. Again, I think you’re being overly conservative. 
---
Anyway...
---
Out of curiosity, do you have a set amount that you charge for building items like metal shelves and stuff? I usually sell most of them for 50 caps but turnover is kind of slow sometimes.
---
I'll go days without selling something and then someone will show up and buy like 10 plans at a time.
---
Exactly. The spacing should be automatically adjusted per the dimensions of your body type and outfit. Surely a game like this knows how to count how many pixels deep your chest is, cut that number in half, and the distance from the center of chest (or shoulders) would be the anchor point. Measure the pixels occupied by body and outfit, place backpack. Boom seamless.
---
The line "Listening is the key to life..." is quite apposite. Bethesda could have kept us for ever. It will go down as the most broken game I've ever played (at least those I bought after the 1980s).
---
Keeping in mind that all that is gross guesstimating, but yeah. A lot of people, in general and on this sub, have no idea just how complex modern AAA development is. Which is normally fine, until they start reeeee-ing over it. It's one thing to complain about design choices (such as the Gold Bullion grind, which I happen to feel is ludicrous). But acting like any sort of bug fix is easy or simple boggles the mind. There is a reason Fallout 4 and Skyrim *still* have bugs.
---
It's not just the fast travel, it's the scrap and stash boxes allowing for instant storage, a sleeping bag for an XP boost and healing, and an instrument that normally requires a plan to craft at camp for bonus AP regen.
---
All without needing to waste caps to move camp, waste time traveling to camp, or wasting both going to a train station.
---
That's not including the exploits that were/are available, such as funneling the scorched at the Asylum Event, or stacking them to gain a height advantage over enemies (these might have been patched out).
---
It's not a big one, but it's still an advantage.
---
🙄🙄🙄
---
Yes, you cannot change from doorways/walls/windows now. That's gone.
---
How are you farming materials?
---
I think 2 hours a day for a video game is a lot lol. It got me to 900+ hours in this game, way more than I’ve put into any other game.
---
They literally *did* own the rights when Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas were made.
---
Youre declaring war on a video game company like an edge lord. If you dont like the game just play something else lol.
---
HE’S EXPRESSING INDEPENDENT THOUGHT! SEIZE HIM!
---
Please explain the logic.
---
This topic needs to be pinned ASAP.
---
Lol!
---
They did
---
Nice to see a post that’s not just complaining. I’m definitely pissed with all the building changes especially, but I’ve heard complaining for 2 years now. At some point, people just either need to quit or do something productive.
---
You are aware they put out a response the the walls thing today right?
---
In general though, bug reports are how companies can track severity of a bug. Data is our friend.
---
Same here, that was much more convenient.
---
I think it is also a bit unique approach to MMO gamę? I mean there is no other game like this with open world building etc. Its mostly due to game being Direct port of single player game which is fo4 no other developer did something like this. This game just dont feel like traditional MMO because of that and that it what drives us towards it despite all of bugs and bad solutions.
---
for me it also works when just make a short break from fireing, about half a second or something. i also think it depends on which weapon you are using, i have way less problems with a fixer then a handmade, the bow has the worst hitchance imo with 95%.
---
Afraid that wouldn’t work ;) I’ve played previously however after beating all the OG story and the wastelanders I’m refusing to play until something fresh comes
---
I honestly think Far Harbour was pretty solid
---
Did they actually fix adrenaline?
---
How long does the average player stay at Atlas to drop off their junk? A 1-2 minute visit does not leave much time to stumble across them.
---
Add a piece of 15% damage while blocking armor and your magic shotgun will magic it’s ass off in vats
---
Just used it a few minutes ago, its under intelligence tree.
---
They patched in it, the BoS Fatigues is now an outfit and not an under armor.
---
Why the duck are you commenting here 🙃
---
About a month after the wastelanders update.  I stay in the sub because im a longtime fallout fan
---
Oh I get flux from queen fights, my friend stores it but I used a bunch on ultra 5mm
---
I can't afford it every month, but every so often I'll buy a month at a time. It's one of the best opt in features of any video game IMO.
---
WTF? Bethesda!!! You can’t stop the duping  and explorers, but you sure as hell can keep us from putting 2 brick doorways together to make interior walls? I’m so close to walking away from this damn game it ain’t funny...😡🤬😡🤬
---
wtf
---
Ok, I figured something was up. I logged off last night and everything was updated properly this morning when I logged on.
---
I have seen two types of things going on with this.  The first is exactly what you have described and it does seem to have gotten worse.  The second seems like the same as the first but I think it's got to do with lag.  I have shot something point blank with a shot gun in vats and not only no damage but all  of the sudden they are no longer where they were and I have taken damage, died a few times and I am out of the ammo I shot.  At the time this happens I have noticed a lag.
---
I was at 25k last night with 3 mins left on feed the people event..2 mins later max caps.spent 6k after with the gold guy after but I knew I was close
---
I've had this problem since they launched the legendary run. XB1X
---
The Brotherhood will turn its guns on the people of the Commonwealth before long. You think they'll give up their structure of power?
---
You do realize that double-sided walls are a metaphorical drop of water in an _OCEAN_ of issues that have plagued Fallout 76 from the start.
---
I replied to another thread here:

I hope that you take the time to read it and consider the points raised.
---
Funny enough it worked fine the first time I logged in and then after that it felt like zorbo was pulling on my cursor.
---
My building Discord is working on finding work-arounds.
---
&gt;to further pad out the end-game grind, they refuse to do anything about the complete lack of viable build diversity
---
I do just fine with my build.  Maybe.. get better at the game?
---
&gt;arguably the most loyal and supportive customers who subscribe to FO1st not only pay a steep monthly cost when compared to other games, they have consistently been lied to about the rewards they'd be getting with no apologies or explanations
---
Stop listening to clickbait YouTubers.  Fallout 1st people get discounts, free stuff, and everything they were promised.  People who actually play the game and have it know this.
---
&gt;the season pass system feels like it was deliberately designed to not only give players less free atoms, but actually even motivate them to spend money instead, as anyone with a job or a somewhat busy life will have a hard time finishing the season otherwise
---
I already finished it without spending a single atom.  Not sure what your complaint is.  You can finish the dailies in under an hour.
---
Beth acquired the franchise rights in 2007.
---
Not sure why the pass through conduit dosent work for you.
---
Look at this guy! He cancelled 6 weeks ago because patch 21 was so bad!!
---
They are a structure of domination and control and their guiding principles are subjugation and extermination. This won't end well for the people of the Commonwealth.
---
Especially grenades made out of floating gas worms
---
You're the only person I've heard who's having issues to this extent. Sounds like a user end problem.
---
Cancelled last month. Been on fo1st since day 1. Dumped hundreds into this game thinking it would help make it better. I was a fool. I went from 4-6 hours a day to try and get my dailies done as fast as possible so I can play something else.
---
They should really give us the fucking Patch notes on the PTS. We can't test stuff if we have no idea what's been changed.
---
Oh no, we can't have people spending 500 atoms and being the CEO of dirty water.
---
*spams collect on ANY water source*
---
Yeah I posted about this earlier
---
i mean they have to, cuz its really unplayable rn
---
I had 370 steel on me apparently and decided i'd donate the 250 to the cause.
---
I got a nice box of wine and whisky which...was absolutely not worth it one single bit
---
I'd actually be pretty funny if they didn't meet their quota at the end of the time periods. But i don't think there's a running total anywhere to view it anyways so we'll probably never know.

---
These are their words not mine.
---
Pretty sure it’s a bug. I don’t know why people act like it’s intentional. It’s not in the patch notes.
---
Most people dont think they have to research to play their game. Saw the ITV and that's a lot. I dont know any other game I read this much about not playing it.
---
Im only 15 levels behind based on that post someone linked.
---
If i can get home every day from work (work across border and covid stops me coming home daily) I should get it done easy enough.
---
Not entirely though surely as it was obsidean (not sure if I spelt it correctly) that produced the game and did the previous two.( correct me if I'm wrong)
---
I've yet to complete it. Also the only way to do it is to side with the settlers of you haven't started the raiders side. You can't enter one of the mines currently needed for the first raider mission
---
Lead and steel?
---
New Vegas was not a Bethesda game. Obsidian did it.
---
It's ok to complain. The wrong stuff gets fixed and glaring problems have existed for a long time. That being said I still think solutions need to be heard on how things can be better. If something gets enough attention then maybe it happens.
---
“Given”
---
Havent searched but there certain events drop gear?thought only faschnaut or scorched earth dropped weapons..should I look for certain events
---
Unplug your xbox for a few hours. Don’t touch it for id say at least two hours. I had a similar experience with a different game and that seemed to get it working again.
---
Cancelling 1st isn't enough. Bethesda can see the number of uninstalls so do that instead. If you're serious about wanting this game to ever improve just make it clear that you are not willing to contribute either money or time. Bethesda is still making money from you as you are part of the content in an online game.
---
For what it's worth I don't think the game is saveable. Life has taught me that some messes are so fucked up it's best to just walk away.
---
Well they already built a lore reason for why they would show up anyways....they don't even know who the guy is who is collecting materials for them. He is taking it upon himself to ingratiate himself with the brotherhood. They would come either way.
---
Well, as I said 4-6 is direct number from Bethesda last year. 2 hours for someone with a job and children is a drop in the bucket for teenager with no summer plans. Had many of friends when I was in hs and college who pulled all-nighters. Even developed 2hr sleep cycles so they could maximize game time without passing out. A lot of ppl have a lot of time on their hands. Especially with this pandemic. The unemployment stimulus checks are still being handed out in most states, which means a lot of ppl with free time.
---
You get you pay for in atoms alone to be fair. Nevermind the survival tent and private server. Oh and the exclusive content. How dare they?
---
Bethesda treats both the same - it's ignored. 
---
The only thing they'll even address (proof being the recent response to the wall issue) is if there is enough backlash that people stop their Fallout 1st subs before even giving a response, let alone resolving the issue.
---
We have two examples of it now where it's the only effective means of getting Bethesda to respond to community-wide concerns.
---
Ya some of these rewards may be trade-able collectibles so dupers would love to get their hands on them, and dupers actually love supporting the community ironically
---
You are trading steel for alcohol and grenades. There is nothing valuable in that deal. Keep your steel for ammo.
---
i have almost 400 lbs of junk on me without perks , with perk+ one armor piece i have 90% reduction, but its always risky when i die and ppl are around
---
You mean the people that live in terror of the things the Brotherhood fights? And how are they a structure of domination? Control, yes, but they hold themselves to that same structure to an extreme.
---
Nope. Donated 15k steel ( i got 60 boxes) and didn't get a single plan i didn't already know but I got around 5k caps, 40-50 floater grenades, 60 plasma grenades, 28 frag genades, around 100 stims, like 20 super stims, 100 radaway, about 30 rad-x, and a shit load of alcohol including 11 Nukashine.
---
Are you using balloon mod? Disabling it fixed fps issues
---
If you choose to do the main story quest i would recommend taking all the gold bullion for yourself. Reputation is easy to farm and you only lose a little.
---
Also you can't get treasury notes from exclamation "!" events until you beat the main story. So your missing out on the daily bullion grind you will need for faction rewards anyways.
---
Obsidian entertainment made new Vegas.
---
Thanks for the tip! I still haven't chosen a side, so this is good to know.
---
What new content?
---
&gt;The situation is not as simple as reverting changes, which could cause exploits and performance issues to return. 
---
It's such a pressing issue -  *2 years in*, that they can't revert the change until they find other solutions?!  Solutions to some vaguely referenced exploits - I don't buy it.
---
You're incorrect. Fallout 1 and 2 were developed by Interplay/ Black Isle studios.
---
I would love double sided walls. I never even knew it was a thing people figured out how to do and I totally missed out. :C
---
I've post this once already but since this post is by an official Bethesda account, I'll post it again:
---
&gt;I don't understand why they keep not giving play testers the patch notes in advance, so that we could actually test the patch in the PTS.
---
&gt;This iteration they didn't give us any note at all, apart from a few superficial points about things that are not in this patch. How are we supposed to know what to test is we don't know what has been changed? 
---
&gt;u/Valseek, u/Ladydevann,  can you please tell the team it's impossible for us to actually test your patches if we have no idea what changes they make? Really, any new PTS iteration should start with "Update # Patch Notes". And actually give us patch notes after subsequent patches, unlike the last two PTS updates.
---
&gt;Like, instead of (Edit: or in addition to) just telling us to test stuff that's months away, without even detailing it, we should have the whole patch notes, and debug tools, and yes, I mean cheat stuff and the console. It's the PTS, we can't take anything over to the full game so why not give us an easier time instead of having to grind to test your stuff, sacrificing the grind on the live servers? Since you willingly made the live game a daily-gated grind, you should expect that people have less time to waste on progress that's not going to be saved, especially since 99% of that time is going to be useless grind to get to the point in which we are able to test stuff. 
---
&gt;There have been tons of posts in the PTS forums about rebooting our characters to keep testing the Legendary Perks after having exhausted all the coins, and all those requests have been completely ignored. Not only that, but you also x5 the grind needed to update the cards, and still didn't give us the fabled lv 250 test character.
---
&gt;If we are to successfully test your game, 1. LET US KNOW WHAT HAS BEEN CHANGED; 2. ACTUALLY PUT IN THE PTS THE STUFF THAT NEEDS TESTING (Legendary Run and its items, hell even atom shop items which are routinely broken, Fortify Atlas, or a Nuclear Winter anticheat); 3. GIVE US TOOLS TO ACTUALLY TEST THE GAME MORE THAN JUST ONCE (if we're lucky).
---
&gt;You created the problem, you need to give us the solution if you want successful testing. Otherwise this backlash will keep repeating itself, over and over and over again.
---
u/BethesdaGameStudios_, please consider bringing this feedback over. We here and even more so on the PTS forums really love this game and want to do our best to make it better, but BGS isn't making our life easy to say the least.
---
Actually they all dont... or did you miss that amazing fur coat Elder Maxson wore... or the abundance of people on the ship not in full power armor...
---
Are you sure you even go here;)
---
Yes, because they have every other time? When, in the entire history of the Wasteland, has the BoS claimed to rule over any peoples? You're drawing conclusions with no actual evidence or rational basis.
---
I'm convinced Fallout 4 is partly a test to see if people recognize the risks of fascist domination or not.
---
It would also help if the devs would play the game. 
---
Secret Service Armor mods for the limbs are listed as fixed and being available when they are still missing from the game. How hard is it to login, travel to Vault 79 and talk to Regs to check this kind of shit? 
---
If I'd be that shoddy at my job I'd be told to box my shit and go away months ago.
---
Anyone know what happened to the mod?
---
When did they say 4-6 hours is average play session? I must have missed that.
---
Anyway, even with 6 hours on average (seems high to me), I think 40k playing right now is a pretty reasonable estimate, but let’s say 30k to be super conservative. 
---
30,000 x 4 = 120,000 daily players. That’s using very conservative numbers. 
---
120k players delivering 70 million steal so far is 583 steel per person. (getting back to original post) hah. 
---
Anyway this math is fun and all but I should get back to work.
---
Plague Walker Serum says that diseases become permanent.
---
The exploit in question had to do with item stacking that could crash the server and be used to dupe
---
I wanted to say I'm surprised the double wall glitch wasnt patched out sooner. When strangler heart PA was being mass produced they would crash the server using a varient of the wall glitch to confuse the server and bring it down. This would cause players on the server to lose about 5-10 minutes of progress due to roll back if they hadn't recently done an action which would warrent an auto save. This was very problematic as the server crashes were chaotic and unpredictable. You could be in the middle of a trade or buy a God roll from the purv and lose it all and your caps. People would threaten to crash the server if you didn't meet their demands.
---
So...anything that helps with game stability then we are going to have to adjust and figure out another new trick to achieve similar result.
---
I clicked the link and a few auto plays later I watching Carl weezer Sing red bone
---
I unplugged it and did a hard reset. It is working again. Strange
---
I have 400 hours in the game and have been subscribed to FO1st, what are you talking about? Sticking your head in the sand because you don’t like valid criticism isn’t any better than mindlessly listening to clickbait videos. Nobody is saying you can’t have fun in the game, or we wouldn’t even be here.
---
Please?
---
No, I have never run into any meat girl as of yet. I just started the game a couple months ago
---
No but that's great to hear. I can't find it though, do you happen to have a link you could help me out with?
---
Lead is about 900 and steel is like 4 or 500
---
Man I did not know that. I haven't played them either yet.
---
I'm going to wait and hope they hotfix it. I want to do the raider stuff and break in with them. Thanks for the tip though.
---
Exactly the kind of brainwashed response I would expect. Your Victorium subscription is about to be cancelled! This land belongs to the vault dwellers.
---
The newer players can buy most of the plans in player vendors for 50 caps, or for free in a bag dropped by someone needing the room.
---
I understand where you are coming from, however i don't think making a suggestion based on bitterness is a good way of doing it. I just hope the community rallies in a positive way and they take notice just like they would with a backlash.
---
Ah, I see we've reached the 'make up shit to be mad about' point of outrage.
---
As both a player and a software QA intern looking for full time work, Bethesda, I will take on this task.
---
It seems its much easier to shut u down than think about what u are actually saying.
---
this is insane that this is how the game works. incompetence on the devs part.
---
Yeah I canceled my FO1st too. Adrenaline/Tenderizer/Gun Fu perks being broken for no reason and then taking over a month to fix made me take a long break. 
---
I wanted to come back this patch and hit the ground running on the Colossus event and the BOS challenges, but this is just getting ridiculous. Bethesda seems really out of touch with what players want.
---
It's for performance

So what is the solution ?
---
Do i really need to do an 80+Gig Fresh install ?
---
They were filled with perfume to cover the smell, people back then thought that the smell was what made you sick since they didn't know about bacteria or anything even close to that.
---
as someone who still hasnt gotten around to getting all the power armor plans, i got a T-45 helmet plan that was nice.
---
but otherwise, no. and i know im in the minority on that, so. yeah. nothing special.
---
I'll say again, clearly someone didn't read. I like the game plenty, but Bethesda needs to get some loose screws back in the proper places. I'm using "declaring war" as a figure of speech here. Just saying ppl should do something to convey to devs that things need changing for the better.
---
Actually that sounds like fun server hoping and nuking  atlas.   Thanks there is actually something to do now
---
You are 'actively looking into' ? Just like all the bugs that you are actively looking into ways to fix them for months now? 
---
How many devs work on the game these days?
---
Wow, ..and here I was ticked off by a recent patch when I noticed the light box building trick vanished.  (You used to be able to build light boxes on top of each other vertically, then horizontally, then you would be able to selectively delete the lightboxes you didn't want so you could make them float.)  Now after a recent patch (not this latest one), you could no longer do this, removing any lightbox other than the original placed would delete them all... this little change pissed me off a few weeks ago... NOW THIS??? LOL Makes that issue I had a joke.  Wow.. just wow, they must've wanted FO1st cancellations to take place after this latest patch.
---
Every time you are giving away 250 steel you are effectively giving away 1080 rounds of .50 cal.
---
No one expected a fair "trade" but these rewards are just garbage.
---
 :-)
---
To be fair,you have a valid point.
---
the problem was they were being lazy and reusing assets in the game. &amp; if the want to be lazy then i have an even better idea of how we can use this....literally just make it a fucking trade menu with a new currency
---
And frankly I think he's reading too much into that message. The Brotherhood isn't coming to provide relief or help survivors; they're coming to investigate the destruction of a chapter in hostile territory, at least in part caused by the locals not cooperating. They're just as likely to show up and blow Dorsey's head clean off as anything else.
---
Just sell the scrap instead and buy the plans you want from player vendors. Many vendors are selling the few valuable plans or save it for ammo and farm events!
---
Really can't take these posts seriously, I get you're frustrated and mad at Bethesda but c'mon.
---
Rather than "hear your frustration", what about actually doing something about it, post haste. 
---
There's no planning required. All you need to do is put a dev onto the task of making a double-sided interior wall as quickly as possible and this problem goes away for all parties.
---
Sooner rather than later I'd suggest or otherwise you might start to see more and more Fallout 1st subscribers cancelling their subscription.
---
I’m not nerdy on building, would love to devote the time but I’m lazy to learn all the tricks. But have you guys been putting walls together to have wallpaper facing outwards? And it got fixed? That’s what I’m getting anyway and it makes me laugh considering last week they released an outside style breeze block wallpaper.. I thought we could’ve used it on the outside but.. anyway it’s hilarious the amount of trollage going on at Bethesda they are literal trolls.
---
Nice! That helps sometimes too, just unplug for a bit. Do you know how to run system maintenance on your console? I know how to do it for ps4, but not Xbox.
---
MAGA
---
Make Atlas Glow Again.
---
And I admitted 40k is conservative, but you threw out 480k lol. There’s just no way Fallout has that playerbase when they can’t even afford to release hotfixes before a major patch. 
---
9.5k is clearly listed as the peak, that means it doesn’t get any higher than that. The graph shows that number go up and down a lot and as low as 5k. So basing the final number on that max player count leads to over-dramatized numbers.
---
The smallest purifier is 2
---
5k steel. All I got out of it is my desire to contribute anymore killed.
---
I can't say for sure dude, I'm a PC player. But I can tell you that even the most incensed outrage posters from this latest update aren't reporting problems like you are. I'm assuming you've checked how good your internet connection is? Other than that I can't say.
---
Bethesda: how do we sell more bulk ammo scrap on Gameflip.
---
Doesn’t work
---
im not using any mods
---
Ahhhh sorry I misunderstood what you said.
---
I also seem to hit every time, junkie auto fixer with full commando/expert/master, ground pound, bloody mess etc. I do not run gun fu or adrenaline.  I wonder if it is the type of weapon?
---
It is dirty water that it collects.
---
Just been told it is only me having problems.
---
My Cursor barely moves,then hangs for like 10 seconds.
---
The Game for me was also lagging terribly.
---
So much so i ran speed tests.
---
Had no problems prior to that f\*\*\*ing update arghhhhhhh.
---
Apparently with this patch every event shares the loot pool of the purveyor
---
Just go wild and do every event you see
---
I don't think they're actually going to do this to the game or the community, I'm just making a dumb joke.
---
I almost guarantee this where the feud between enclave and brotherhood begin. Both seek supremacy over the technology of these lands. Enclave feels entitled to it,being the biggest and brightest minds pre-war that controls everything and  the former army/govt in the brotherhood who feel entitled to federal property as well. Both have a ideological clash based on their own justification.
---
Just Spam Back
---
Why?? The way Bethesda handle the game. Handle it's released. Handle the way they I engage with the community is very poor. All I'm interested in is people's opinion on the developers and really if fallout series should revert back to its original developers and producers. Ie obsidean fallout new Vegas and the fallout 1 and 2 wich were done by black isle I think someone in the comments said.
---
I’m sitting in the same boat here OP. Been playing since Beta and have only taken one or two months of a break from playing since then. I even subbed for the one year FO 1st and have bought maybe $80 worth of atoms and I bought the tricentennial edition, yet I feel utterly screwed at this point by this game. I want to love it, truly I do. I’ve met so many friends and built so many camps and have done so much with over 2000 hours logged...yet I feel like instead of this being a playable game, it’s now payable to how bethesda wants you to pay and play. No creative outlooks and even the most minor exploit gets you banned...sad isn’t it.
---
Hold whatever the back button is on your platform.
---
I like the exhausts n skulls totem. Love the automotive stuff, Fits my raider camp well!
---
Holding down the back button should exit you out of any terminal.
---
What if these numbers are just inflated to make it seem there are a lot of players participating but this is actually a controlled event??? WHERE THE FLUFF IS MY TIN FOIL HAT?!
---
They fixed goo piles (now disappear after they have been looted, no more goo piles obstructing meat piles) and fixed adrenaline, so that’s nice.
---
Other than that I’m hugely disappointed.
---
Yeah I play this as an RPG and it’s like ‘MY CORK’
---
Doubt it, lifetime membership. But besides, the Vault Dwellers have accomplished what exactly? If left alone, all they do is drop nukes on each other and stuff themselves full of FEV. All that the Dwellers have accomplished is as a result of those who did all the work before them.
---
Like I said, I’m in the same boat of being frustrated! But that’s all this subreddit is now. No solutions, just problems. Can’t understand why so many people even enjoy playing if all they want to do is waste so much time on reddit saying it sucks.
---
Hold down the B button if on Xbox
---
FOR ALL THE WINE. But no seriously, proud of y'all.
---
Nuka and Harbor were great. Mechanist was meh, and the over abundance of workshop DLC kinda sucked all around. 
---
Would've been better if they just had 1-2 more full expansion DLC and rolled workshop content into them
---
it gives dirty water.
---
apparently it gives 2 dirty water cap at a time
---
Or that
---
What do you mean tradeable collectables, you mean the plans everyone who has been around more then 2 months have? or the alcohol?  or the award everyone gets
---
Yah that’s why I said do the math yourself- I wasn’t trying to be snarky; I don’t know what you do and don’t have, there’s a lot of variables. But you have access; add up the numbers and see what it “should” be.
---
Hell...will do just that then!
---
I don't disagree with your sentiment but if both are going to be ignored anyways, which you go with just becomes academic. The result is going to be the same either way.
---
This should be in the description. It's not, but it should be.
---
There was a red strobe light that came in the caravan bundle, I stuck one on the outside of my rail car.
---
If you read what bughesda has told us about the reason for the fix, you see that exploiters/dupers used the wall thing as one way to crash servers. So instead of blaiming bughesda, blame them.
---
You're out here talking shit and you dont know anything about the franchise?
---
Flush it.
---
Thanks for auto-completing for us, Bethesda!
---
Ohio adventure or whatever it's called, there's a raider called Blackeye, talk to her and she'll offer to give her supplies daily - mirelurk meat, soft shell meat, mirelurk eggs or mirelurk queen meat, all in different amount. There's also a guy named Fishbones, if you talk to him he can offer you to help them defend the water purifiers. Both can be done every day and both give a little rep to raiders.
---
Sacrifice your first born
---
I had no idea that was a thing!! Thank you!
---
Go dupers 👍😂
---
Could try a scan &amp; repair, maybe delete or rename the .ini files
---
I dont get why everyone hates the brotherhood... but again, i only played fallout 4.
---
What ever they did I got the 2 scout masks and jumpsuits from uranium fever last night
---
Hardly talking shit. Merely stating the obvious about the current game.
---
All these flies on 16x the details....
---
Alt+f4
---
V.A.T.S.! Don't forget V.a.t.s. It is still broke!
---
I havent either.  I have about 200 hours in the game level 138 and i just finished I am become death last week. (Well somebody launched a nuke while i was at the purveyor so it auto completed for me. And I ran my first silo monday night but put in the wrong code and it ate my only nuke card.) 
---
Anyway I usually just come on and do the score challenges.  Other than that I'm just trying to max my scrip out for the day.  I am a power armor user so I don't really care about the Secret Service armor.
---
Alright guys fvck this post just bulk and then scrap
---
Only found out myself a few days ago 🙃
---
"I'm offering my ass to get fucked for $1 and complaining when I get paid in quarters," is how you all sound.
---
Hahaha, exactly. It's not too bad tbh
---
UGL plan is pretty rare, congrats!
---
Why? Because noone had a problem with Bethesda and the fallout franchise until their handling of this game. Yes 76 is a frustrating mess, but trying to say they shouldn't have had the franchise is just silly. Don't worry, when Fallout 5 comes out everyone will have forgotten about 76 and love it again.
---
I’d play WoW classic instead mate
---
I kinda agree. Fallout 3, 4 and 76 are lackluster compared to 1,2 and New Vegas - which Bethesda did not create.
---
The sense of freedom is enormous.
---
it works as intended.  
---
not userfriendly, no logic at all (otherwise we would have to keep the junk in the inventory to build or craft something) but thats the way someone thought it is good.
---
Last I saw, there were dungeon packs you could either buy or get by subbing, and there were chapters which you had to buy no matter what. If you buy the newest chapter for $60 you get the previous ones. Is that accurate?
---
Yea so you just nuked an innocent civilian because the brotherhood isn't here yet
---

76 has been running like a Bag of shit on my PS4 Pro since that update.
---
Literally the game is unplayable.If i can get past the load Screen.
---
I  got a message on the ps4 telling me the game was corrupted. And i need to do a fresh install.
---
The Ps4 literally spit the disc out.
---
Then how can you possibly be so blithely confident that it will be fixed? I’ve got a million examples that remain unfixed and far fewer that are fully, truly fixed, and I can’t even have confidence that those will remain that way given how many “fixes” get re-broken a patch or 3 later.
---
I just donated 500 lmao...ain't getting all my steel!!!
---
Game was released as garbage, every critic unanimously agreed it was garbage, even Bethesda agreed it was garbage. Every patch has introduced new exploits, bugs and glitches
---
Your still playing though. This is your fault at this point.
---
I hope so. I really do hope so. Heck I'd be willing to pay if it's gonna be as good as fallout 3 and new Vegas ( I have doubts though)
---
FYI I just checked in the workbench and it says it only air born diseases for the Chinese helmet. Like most changes it is not retroactive so the old helmet still has the water born text. From what I have seen.
---
I donated about it.00001 percent of that
---
That's an adorable sentiment.
---
I get the sense that you've never left feedback for the PTS. Bethesda ignores most of them there too. 
---
Even if they implement it on the PTS, it probably won't help much if they don't listen and have people cancelling their Fallout 1st subscription before they respond.
---
Hell, that was happening to me before the update.
---
I’m only doing it cause it can drop t-51 plans
---
Very well put.. i don't blame anyone for speaking out. When this game first came out, it was very unstable, at times unplayable. In my opinion this game gas ruined the fallout series for me. I loved fallout played the first game and played 76 for 4 months when it first came out. During those 4 months rather than giving us more content they started doing scaling downgrades in secret cause they knew they didn't have the content. This is the reason why I stopped playing... they will patch things and break other things, they don't listen to their community, they do things in secret and not doing the things they need to do to improve the game. Maybe the game has been improved since I stopped playing but none the less their out of touch with their community.
---
Fullier
---
Bethesda have already posted this here themselves.
---
The ammo convertor has bugs even when I have the 10x or 100x amount of ammo in my inventory it won't convert them and not even reached close to maxing my converter points
---
Nice
---
Official Bethesda Response... "NO, but thanks for your money! Muahahaha!"
---
How very DARE you bring common sense, facts, and reason to here, this place of ALL places!
---
Don't you realise that people here have every right to be annoyed about something they haven't read?!
---
Good day, sir.
---
I SAID GOOD DAY.
---
They arent used to having to fix their own game. They usually release it barely playable and let the fans mod it into working order. They probably dont know how to patch to save their lives.
---
Ad ~~nauseum~~ victoriam!
---
I chipped in 3K glad it helped 👍
---
FO1st still doesn't have all the features promised at launch.
---
Things like discounts aren't even shown to the FO1st players, so even they are often unaware that they're getting it. Bad communication / UI design on Bethesda's part creating an even worse perception of a bad product.
---
source: https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events
---
Same here. I also have around 200 hours (level 143) and it took me around 150 hours to finnish the original main story line and launch my first nuke.
---
Dang guess it bricked a lot of people’s consoles
---
I’ve seen a lot addressed based on community feedback? I saw the response from Bethesda less than an hour ago. I have seen the game improve (albeit slowly) pretty dramatically since launch.
---
You didn't understand a little.
---
Armor imposes a stealth penalty based on its weight. The heavier, the higher the penalty. By removing armor, you improve stealth. Therefore, you should not remove it, but change it to the same one for an accurate test.
---
You assume they aren’t padding the numbers or just making them up wholesale
---
They are apparently adding pets at some point, I imagine kinda like the tamable monsters atm. Doubt it will be for abit though but it is on their radar.
---
Canceled my sub shortly after the legendary run started. It’s a joke. I’ve supported this game since the beta, but I have two kids that are involved with extra curricular activities and a full time job, them making the game more of a chore at every turn has completely turned me off from it. As it stands right now I’ll be getting star field when the price comes down because I just don’t trust these fuckers to do right anymore...
---
No extractor inside foundations anymore - spent so much time building camps and ALWAYS integrate the resource extractor in the basement. Never again 😭
---
Yeah, the cat's cute and everything, but the liberator has a *smiley face* drawn on it!
---
None of this matters because we've finally gotten the change we **all** asked for.. the Wastelander photomode frame now has a rifle, not a musket.
---
I forgot to mention as well that secret service armor plans and the guass weapons plans as well as many other things can be purchased with gold bullion's. You can spend 500 legendary scrip for 10 legendary modules a day, this allows  you to craft 10 pieces of randomized 3 star gear based on what piece you craft. You can't trade these items to other players, nor can you sell them to vendors, you can only trade them in for more scrip or scrap them.
---
So there is that grind your missing out on as well.
---
They work so hard to implement one npc...
---
This fucked up the entire story for new players, Ounce of Prevention is broken and I cannot progress the story on my second account
---
If im willing to side with the Imperium in 40k then the brotherhood sounds like the lesser evil in fallout universe... they do kinda remind me of the space marines...
---
In fallout 4 they seemed like the best choice, i dunno what kinda shit they got into in the previous games tho, but in 4 they didnt seem so bad.
---
I'm not giving the brotherhood shit. They can send a detachment from 1 end of Post-War America to the other, but don't give them the supplies necessary to actually build a base and survive when they get here? Brilliant plan.
---
I think steam is a pretty small % of the player base for this game. 
---
I don’t know what you mean by them not affording to release hotfixes. They have hotfixes all the time.
---
I wouldn’t even still spend a penny on this game if it had the best update
---
uhm, maybe hardware related like your keyboard don't support more then 2-3 inputs at once? i have a keyboard where a big selling point were "up to 11 several imputs simultaneously!" with big letters on the package. idk if it was a marketing stunt tho. i have btw no problems using several keys at once on pc.  
---
best to try it out is to check if you can push more keys at once in other games or download a key binder software where you see which key is pressed and faceroll the keyboard.
---
It's Bethesda. If they fuck up again (which they will) not much people will be surprised.
---
Double sided walls aren't the only issue. 
---
We need to be able to place foundations under roofs they're not attached to and walls under roofs in order to build connected buildings over uneven terrain like rock overhangs and lake shores.
---
We also need to be able to snap staircases to the bottom of floor pieces for when we want stairs to descend to a place where we can't or don't want a foundation piece placed, like into water.
---
We were using tricks involving staircases to place upper floor pieces as finished ceilings under roof pieces because of the lack of ceiling wallpaper/textures but a recent change made it not possible to place roof pieces on top of walls that already have an upper floor snapped to them.
---
There are more issues than that, but those stick out in my mind right now.
---
Yes it's unfortunate that those building techniques are all tied to the same mechanic. I still think we should be able to switch a wall to a door or whatever.
---
Well my action started long ago considering I never bought 1st to begin with cuz this game's consistent poor quality has never deserved a subscription from the start; not to mention it was their first major lie to us. It's literal pay2win (especially with the new legendary crafting slot machine which is a huge pain in the ass on your inventory) and a bandaid over a problem they intentionally created (and lied about, saying the stash would ruin server performance). We were told monetization would be cosmetic only on the game's announcement. I've always been surprised by the MASSIVE amount of people who happily threw money at it immediatly but I guess my willpower stat is higher than most.
---
I am however one of the fans who happily preordered and payed full price without complaints (even expecting major bugs at launch) for the game for the sole reason of supporting it. I never complained about atom store prices, I always thought it was fine since cosmetic only... but Fallout 1st and now this awful Battle Pass thrusted into a broken game... it's just way too dickish to me and my respect towards them has plummeted so far into the dirt. 
---
If they are struggling hard for money and talent maybe they should ask for help and explain why they're doing all this sleazy stuff and why they can't fix anything. Otherwise I'll just assume dickish greed.
---
Done that mate.
---
The game was also lagging really bad.
---
My first thought like yours was Broadband issues.
---
I pay a premium price for it so i expect a minimum 100 Meg,it was 102.
---
I am going to try and log on again in a bit.
---
Have you any ideas how a fresh install would affect my character ?
---
having 389 levels in and top tier Gear,it worries me.
---
Cheers in advance.
---
Judging by some of the things I've read on this sub, I dont believe a fair amount of the &gt;250k members even play this game at all, at least not anymore.
---
&gt;I think you just dont' understand how it works.   100x doesn't mean 100 pieces of ammo. it means 100x the required amount.  So tthat, Trading in 3 nukes  = 1 transaction.  10x and 100x are transactions meaning 10x &amp; 100x = 30 &amp; 300 nukes respectively.  NOT 1:1
---
Actually they didnt come to cause Synth Genocide, they came to prevent their continued creation, by destroying the Institute. The Railroad were a group that believed that turrets had sentience, and that by wiping a synths' mind, they were actually saving them, they were entirely delusional. "Stealing from settlers" is entirely at the discretion of the player character, the moment you show me a unaltered interaction in Fallout 4 where the Brotherhood is personally stealing supplies from the Settlers themselves, I'll give you $20 over PayPal.
---
Oh, Bethesda already brought the "fertiliser", it was update 21.
---
We need our own liberators like this, or ones we can even paint and decorate on our own
---
Why would it collect purified?  Have you seen the nuclear skies 😂
---
This happened to me too on my Xbox but I reset my router and it was working fine after that.
---
They just posted on their website that they are talking about how to get double-sided walls back in a different way
---
When I lock on to an enemy in V.A.T.S. for some reason it misses the first shot, hits the second shot, and then loses lock on the enemy and I have to start all over again. It is getting to the point of being unusable!
---
Oh goody... :(
---
I think the idea here is that if we rally in a positive way and had 4k likes on a post that was positive ideas that would also have a major impact. But i could be wrong.
---
I think it's less about the backlash and more about the attention the issue received.
---
The budget exploit was a way for half walls to cost 0 budget to place but gained budget back when removing, wasn't tricky but did require half walls double mounted fulls and 2 slants to do, I doubt most even noticed it unless you liked to try to make the most odd structures you could. Overall it was not very effective for the slow gains. As for the dupe method it existed, I can't provide you evidence since it is not something I recorded. What I can say is that it was an encased vendor with double walls all around it and 3 people needed with 1 being an anchor.
---
Well I'm glad they responded but it makes me feel like they will address double sided walls and that's it. I gave them a list of some of the other recent build mode changes that have messed with the ability to build creatively, so hopefully they will look at broader changes than just adding interior walls.
---
And it'll cost 1300 Atoms probably
---
Floater grenades is you're lucky!
---
That sort of thing should be saved server-side, not on your console. You should be able to access your character and your gear just fine if you create a fresh install. I can't guarantee doing so will fix your issues, though, but good luck.
---
Weapon definitely seems to make a difference. My gauss rifle and gauss shotgun miss in VATS most of the time, even with 95% hit chances, even if I don't charge them. My explosive lever action almost never misses, even with hit chances in the 20s and 30s.
---
We will have to wait and see
---
Sbased off of their track record: double walls will appear in testing in 6 months, and get scrapped indefinitely a month later due to "bugs"
---
The point I was making is that many people on here have complained that Bethesda hasn't been communicating. Even if they did, it wouldn't make a difference to those people.
---
Pretty  sure  an ounce of prevention is broken too,  wont let me analyze  the blood sample
---
I appreciate the info. The budget glitch super weird, gonna look more into it. Dupe I've heard nothing about at all. That deserves an immediate fix though so I get it.
---
Ever since the patch, I’ve been CTDing about 4 times per hour. Some forums said on PC you have to clear your cache on Steam in order to even play the game, but it’s still a hot mess for me for some reason.
---
Ad Victoriam!
---
This is why I use virtual credit cards on anything I buy/subscribe to online. I can set the max spend limit and turn off the card so they can try all they want and they can't get a penny more than I say, when I say. I have an annual FO1st plan so I keep my card disabled until it is time to renew, that way if I decide to cancel but forget to do it they can't charge the card and I get an email saying they tried to as a reminder to enable or cancel. Good luck getting your money back from Beth I have a friend that never got a refund from an atom purchase issue.
---
Double sided walls scheduled to release in patch 32 delayed to patch 34, breaks unyielding and no guns reload.
---
You’re correct on all counts.
---
If you’re claiming that’s Bethesda’s claimed reason, though...
---
Everyone forgets this game is (or at least started as) a survival-lite game. That means limits based on some form of “realism”. 
---
Scrap having weight is a limit based on realism.
---
Yeah, FO1st scrapbox. That’s a pretty typical enticement to get people to actually put money into the game.
---
Sorry, misspoke.  Bethesda owned the rights. Which is what the OP mentioned.
---
I chipped in 250.  I already have all the plans from those boxes so I'm not wasting any more of my 15k steel scrap.
---
You kinda concocted your own little scenario there and ran with it. Impressive.
---
Lol i know it doesn't sound fun, but it allows you to craft your own legendaries when comes to bullion plans which is pretty sweet.
---
The advantage of this is that your getting legendaries on a piece you want or a weapon you want instead of being random legendaries on a pipe pistol.
---
110% agree. I canceled my fallout 1st subscription a few hours ago.
---
Sideroad is my guess. A number of long-standing RPGs have gone the MMO route and returned to solo campaign.
---
&gt;Is Fallout 76 the future of Fallout or a dead end?
---
Yes.
---
This post, absolutely.
---
Fair enough, my understanding was foggy at best.
---
Thanks for clearing up the details of the relationship.  \m/
---
These are the posts that’s should be trending during this community event, not all the whining.
---
As mentioned, shotguns are underpowered unless you have a few Explosive Combat Shotguns and the Enforcer and Adamantium Skeleton perks.  At least then you can cripple almost anything and then finish them off with a double barrel.  
---
You basically have two options, switch it up to a heavy gunners build or a Melee build.  The strength perks lends themselves nicely to these playing styles.
---
If you want to stick with shotguns and weapons, I would go with a heavy gunner build.  A decent 50 cal can do a lot of damage, and a nice legendary can kill almost anything with ease.
---
I would swap 1x perk point from Endurance to Stength to max it out, 1x perk point from Endurance to Intelligence (so that you can run Stabilized perk when you do want to get into power armour.  Stabilized makes heavy guns pinpoint accurate at distance), and 1x perk point from Endurance to Perception (so that you can run Skeetshooter, Glowsite perks.  It also gives you enough slots to use Commando perks when you want to switch to handmades, etc. for variety).  
---
My Heavy Gunner build has 14, 9, 6, 3, 12, 6, 6.  I have higher points than in perception than a normal Heavy Gunner build as I like to switch from heavy gunner to Combat Rifile and Snipers Rifle.  My character actually started out as a Melee and Shotgunner build.  The 12 points in Intelligence are so that I can run Batteries included (for Fusion &amp; Plasma Cores) and Gunsmith (guns break slower, explosive weapons break quickly) and Demolition Expert.
---
There needs to be a double-sided blank wall for building internal walls.
---
So you do that at a special bench? Can I craft specific weapons, or is it just weapons?
---
Ye
---
Did you quit the game and reload so it sets you back to having the fuse in your inventory?
---
We don’t need a buggy dumb faction from bugtesta lol my junk not theirs
---
wait... your yes is for...? lol
---
Don’t forget ostracized!
---
They dont all, but the majority do, in 76, there are, what, 4 non-PA'd BoS bodies?
---
wait, are they nerfing the Chinese helmet?
---
Always a convenient excuse for them.
---
"But it seems going downward spiral with the update"
---
This will never fail to make me laugh.
---
I wouldn’t bet on it
---
NO FUN ALLOWED
---
No Bethesda contracted obsidian to make new Vegas. They never owned obsidian.
---
If the developer needs to be able to reproduce the problem more quickly, have them configure a character with 5 pieces of unyielding, adrenal, nerd rage, and drop HP below 20%.  Shouldn't take too long to run into the stall.
---
I cant enter either and their link to submit tickets isn't working so idk
---
Yeah, like 4 times.
---
I wish I could be this brave.
---
What exactly is causing your game to be “beyond unplayable” because after yesterday’s update my game has been running just like it did prior.
---
You just go to the armor/weapon bench you already got, it's relatively cheap to make all pieces. You just need to use normal junk and 1 legendary module for each one which gives you a  random 3 star legendary on the piece of your choice. Modules reset daily, but you can only get 250 scrips a day and it costs 500 to buy them everyday.
---
Yeah my friend who likes to play like a bull in a china shop (and dies repeatedly for it) annoys me for this reason. My sneaking doesn't seem to work at all even though I should still be hidden.
---
Are you unaware that the main source of atoms was removed and all that’s left are one time challenges that most people have already done, which means the only way to get atoms is to buy them?
---
Please note: What I am about to say is not a personal judgement on you. It is a general statement about both the state of the sub and the nature of sub posters. I will also use some degree of hyperbole and strong language, for both humor and impact.
---
That's customer-power fan wank.
---
Bethesda is not going to look at the sheets, see "Atom Purchases are down 7%", and assume that 1) its because of the wall "fix" and 2) Reverting it will solve the problem. Posting our opinion will not make Mighty Bethesda change their mind, and saying "power of the wallet" is ludicrous. Most of the players won't care. They don't read reddit, they didn't know about the double wall thing, and they won't care even if they did. We're a vocal minority.
---
That does not mean posting is pointless.
---
What is more likely to happen, if anything, is that one of the PR folks who visit here will see the reaction and maybe, if they can find any, read some of the more reasonable posts and possibly say, "they kinda have a point." They will then send out a memo or meet with their boss and say, "hey, how feasible is it for us to restore this functionality?" They maybe decide to investigate it, and if it is feasible on their end, in a couple weeks time we get a Behind the Vault saying "We heard the community, and will revert this in a future patch."
---
The difference between the first and second option is that the first demands, and the second requests. In the end, anyone who might help us in this is a person, not a faceless corporate shill.
---
I fully encourage folks to post about this or any other issue they have. But they need to stop being goddamn monkeys about it. Reading the sub right now is like reading r/Donald (RIP). It is full of people doing their damnedest to one up the outrage, the furious talking points, the demands of everyone else so they can get more precious fake internet points and tell themselves Bethesda's PR people will even *click* on a post titled "Bethesda, don't be fucking stupid, fix mah thing" or "I canceled 1st" or...

If you really want to send a message, upvote the most *reasonable* post about it. That way, if we're lucky, the above mentioned PR assistance will see it and have that vital thought.

Fix was for performance gains

How about being less spineless and perma ban the fucking perpetrators.

Let's see how many accounts they can buy.
---
Snipe them all down and let's see who's going to cry.
---
Haha, you do seem VeryAgitated. You’ll be back. THEY ALWAYS COME BACK!!
---
Thanks!!!
---
Never said they owned obsidian, and not what the OP was asking. They owned the rights to the game.
---
Thanks, I like to think I'm creative but really I just rip my ideas off from other, better posters.
---
I thought it was funny
---
Honestly. I was heavily invested in the legendary run for awhile, but the bugs and glitches and lack of end game content is bothering me so bad that I’m now farming with my guild for the AQ event on WoW Classic because that is somehow more engaging than F76
---
Your gonna miss out on the colossus event being delayed a few more times.  Your loss
---
What event
---
Highly doubt it...
---
I agree with most things you post... but saying that the players should be unpaid testers/quality assurance for a game or else they don’t get to complain is silly. Bethesda should be testing their own game, not charging the player base $60 to do it. Not reporting bugs puts the ball back in Bethesda’s court, essentially saying “we’re done helping you out, fix your own shit”.
---
I'm sorry, I misunderstood your post. I thought you were saying Bethesda was just saying shit with no intention of backing it up.
---
Granted, I wish there weren't so many fucking issues in the first place, but they do seem to be aware of players' concerns even if things aren't always fixed in the most timely manner.
---
Look at recent history.
---
The player vendor/display case being disabled for ages was not responded to for over a month. Once people started cancelling their Fallout 1st subs, suddenly a rapid response and an eventual fix a few weeks later.
---
The double interior wall "exploit" was fixed. Didn't get any responses for days after many highly upvoted posts until people started cancelling their Fallout 1st subs. Suddenly around an hour ago we get a response from Bethesda with no immediate fix but one that apparently will eventually come.
---
In an idea world, thoughtful suggestions given in a constructive manner would be the way to go. For Bethesda, it's threats to their revenue that they respond to and little else.
---
Don't trust what I say though. Watch for the next major screw up. It'll follow the same pattern. Big issue -&gt; massive community response (both positive and negative) -&gt; no response -&gt; cancellation of Fallout 1st subs -&gt; prompt response from Bethesda.
---
and this will be the last we hear of this for months or possibly forever.
---
I think the dupers are on our side this time. Some people have Hundreds of Millions Junk in their Fallout 1st Chest.
---
Fallout 76 is the dead end future of Fallout. They continually double down on toxic regressive monetization models and the worst possible technical service.
---
Or the means of rooting out ultra libs who see authoritarian and immediately try to block it out with safe spaces.
---
They're sending a unit to Pittsburgh.   
---
Should get there in ~150 years.
---
Tbh I went back to ESO recently and my build is so bad in that game I can barely kill creatures, it takes time, and I'm level 30 + in that game or something like that. The level scaling is just eh to me, it lets me know my build is trash and idk how to fix it. Least with 76, I have some concept of builds until they level scale
---
I wish I had known this during 2x XP lol
---
This is my problem with the season also. It was my concern at the beginning and is my concern now.
---
That's nice
---
Ps4 player here same here
---
Just because a few people on this subreddit are complaining doesn’t mean that’s how everyone feels about the game, there’s others like myself who play the game with its faults and donate too.
---
Same I'm getting real tired of 76 the only fun thing I can do is help low levels, everything else is boring
---
Proof?
---
But this is all stuff I need gold for? I can buy modules at the purveyor already.
---
Mate, you’re browsing gaming subreddits to complain about people who care about gaming.
---
If you edit your comments atleast own up to it you clown, don't play it off like a counterargument.
---
I disagree.  I predict that double-sided walls will go straight through their testing and right into a content update.... and will cost 1200 atoms.
---
That’s not what I’m saying.
---
But reporting bugs is helpful. Refusing to report bugs, does nothing but ensure bugs will persist. I just submitted a ticket on the BOS fatigues bug. Took 45 seconds.
---
Cancelled
---
Seems like a lot of wasted effort to me. Dorsey will just (presumably) put on a rad suit like the folks at Crater/Foundation do, and it's not like you're going to catch anyone off-guard with a three-minute warning.
---
I’m curious how many will read this and try it lol
---
Agree, this subreddit its just a tiny percentaje of the players; some people act like we are all here
---
?
---
It used to have the option go away when you didn't have enough ammo to sell it again, and now you have to continually leave the terminal, go to your pipboy and check, and then come back.
---
That depends.
---
I’m guessing you’ve got some combination that’s making your combat shotty do “magic” damage. Because without that, or just outside of VATS, the damage (and RANGE!) difference really shows up.
---
Normally I'd agree with you, but what would submitting a bug report accomplish here? They already have a pile of them that they're not dealing with.
---
Have they actually fixed any of the real issues? The things they do fix take at least a month to get done, no matter how important they are. Yes, they fixed the Fashnacht issue 'fast', but that was ages after the issue with the critter spawns were raised.
---
Every updates breaks something new, and most fixes don't actually fix the issue they're meant to. IE they don't actually know what they're doing. I doubt there's anybody on the dev team who really knows the engine, or know how they FO76 changes to it were implemented.
---
Face it, Bethesda have a bug reporting feature to make you feel like they care, but the don't. If they did, things wouldn't be this bad.
---
If you want to believe that you are welcome to. That in no way disqualifies what I said.
---
I mean it is kinda smart, in a way, to keep job security.
---
So... you admit that it’s taxing on the client then, like as in the reason they fixed the exploit at all. I just assumed it was a server load thing. I’m not the game developer you all seem to be. Sorry!
---
Best thing I got was some prime plans. I mean we don't have a nice new hat . Also I think ya just have to do it once to even get the reward
---
Seems like you did know where to begin. Thanks for enlightening me.
---
&gt;  I'm just trying to blow off some steam. Not make a debate and discussion. 
---
Then scream into a pillow or rub one out.  If you post on a public forum expect a debate and discussion.
---
I’m fully expecting my first post-arrival visit to Atlas to include seeing Dorsey’s rotting corpse laying in front of the place. Their radio message doesn’t sound like they’re coming to chit chat, they’re probably going to shoot first and look at all the presents he gathered later.
---
That patch in particular created more bugs and broke more stuff than any other patch I can remember.  This new patch has nothing on that one lol.  A few months later I remember another patch note that had something to do with fixing a bush where the texture was floating slightly above the ground ....
---
Where in the hell they get their priorities from for some of this stuff confuses me deeply.
---
I could ask you the same, no just a plausible theory.
---
2 dirty water for 5-10 mins of waiting? Shit i could get 30 dirty water in 10 secounds if i just walked three feet to a fucking river. Sounds like a waste of atoms, thanks for telling us so i didnt make the mistake of buying it.
---
Didnt edit a comment, cool guy. In fact, made it clear that I misspoke.  If you want, I can link you to a definition of 'edit' so you know for future use.
---
Well for starters, the frame rate dropped substantially whenever another player was around, sometimes. It worked fine other times but most of the time it just wouldn’t function. I got robbed of loot from legendaries 3 times (including the SBQ), as in the loot just plain didn’t show up. And I UNLOADED into the SBQ, and the other two legendaries I was the only one who shot them. 
---
I made a post yesterday about not being able to walk through doors in my camp, it’s like there’s a wall there. Lights don’t project light properly in my camp now either. 
---
And on top of that, feral ghouls seem to be immortal now. They don’t even move. This problem (enemies not moving or attacking) has seemingly gotten worse with the update. 
---
Beyond that, just things like the 4-6 second lag whenever I open my pip boy and favorites menu, and now whenever I try to use a workbench (any bench) my character just stands there for a good 30 seconds first.
---
Dupes do get patched often, this one just kind of effected a majority of people. I need to be clear I was a duper once, I belonged to a few private groups that explore ways to do it. I still have IRL friends that do dupe. I lost interest when I found it made the game boring it is literally no fun to have it all at all times. To them it is all about "breaking" the game as it is their fun to do.
---
That's the issue of them using this ancient business hierarchy, the people that have a say are the most disconnected from even the company itself living somewhere on private island and don't even know or care that this community exists at all. In return though the people that know most of the community and the current game aren't allowed to speak up and only have to follow orders from the higher-ups. If Bethesda/Zenimax doesn't change this there's little hope to this game turning around any time soon or ever at all.
---
Ad Victorium, friend.
---
Remind me what exploits utilized this trick? How is it fair to punish the entire camp building community by doing this just to try to stop the small minority that is the exploitation community?
---
&gt;I shall be looking into my legal rights regarding false advertising on your product. I would not be surprised if others do the same.
---
That's been attempted before, you don't have legal grounds at all...
---
a lot of ppl r having the same problem all we can do is  hope bethesda doesn’t take long to fix this
---
Lol I purchased this game last year and couldn’t really get into it since I didn’t have a lot of extra time on my hands. Now that I do, I decided to sit back and play.... that didn’t last too long because the main quest and some of the side quest are glitching... I can’t even complete them. 🤦🏾‍♂️
---
You could have gotten substantially more caps selling the steel. And by recipes I can only assume you mean plans as there are no recipes in the loot table.
---
$1,000?
---
Agree to disagree on this. There is a difference between having a skills/resource gap when it comes to addressing problems timely and maliciously ignoring things.
---
not sure what youre getting at..
---
seems like another post patch wednesday in the 76 sub to me...
---
Yup, no more circle bases or double interior walls.  Stupid!
---
Yep. Same here.
---
I'm cancelling FO1st as I type this. Pure embarrassment
---
nope. no. please don't. only on private servers - maybe.
---
Hell, they can even do IP bans, I just don't know why they wouldn't.
---
Oh! I forgot to mention that sometimes an enemy will be standing two feet or less from me and V.A.T.S. will not lock at all? I aim my gun and see the enemy is hostile but V.A.T.S. will not see it no matter how many times I press the lock button?
---
Not showing up for anyone.
---
I am not a duper, but I follow a bunch of discords, and do enjoy a good build capacity glitch, i had never heard of this one though.
---
Cheers Mate.
---
Just tried logging on again.
---
The little Cog in the bottom corner just spins out indefinitely when i go to join a World.
---
Looks like i will have to indulge in the Last of us 2 for a bit.
---
Oh this is one they ‘fixed’ with patch 21 if I recall the notes correctly. Might be they fixed it too good.
---
Yep, and so moral he hangs out with child traffickers and wishes them well.
---
Do click on the button under your comment and read for me what it's labeled.
---
Not true at all (((SHILL))) Todd Howard has my family captive and working in his gulag because we spoke out about his horrible game.
---
I'm working with a high tier team of lawyers to sue him at this moment. This dream team surpasses OJ Simpsons lawyers and WE GAMERS WILL HAVE JUSTICE
---
END THE OPPRESSION.
---
/s of course.
---
Same here, PS4 base version.
---
Hey I was trying to get into this game but performance was already awful for me before the update so I'm giving up too. Was wondering if Fallout 4 was worth it (never played one before).
---
classic beth right there
---
Bows should be able to fire in a single button press and holding it down increases distance and strength depending on how long it's held till it reaches max charge and be able to fire at any point during that hold... like pretty much all other games. But I guess they're behind by a few decades and that kind of coding is too advanced.
---
Legendary effect of your primary weapon; nonspecific damage perks (bloody mess, nerd rage), nonspecific mutation (adrenal reaction).
---
Hello fellow cat lover 😺
---
North of Welch and just Northwest of Welch station in the ash heap there is a place you can build your camp where a named cat spawns.  His name is Murgle if you need to google a better location.
---
Bos one
---
My guess based on physical design this was the original plan but they couldn't figure out how to do it with out causing a dupping bug
---
I like how op tries to shit on the building community with no proof at all, showing how much of a dumbass he or she is.
---
It looks like they added several animations and effects to the board that slows things down. Or that is my theory anyway.
---
Bos event
---
It's something similar to ESO, it's just a Fallout so we have something to play until Fallout 5's release.
---
They literally have you kill every synth on sight, including the ones hiding in Bunker Hill, Paladin Spoiler and even Acadia which isn't even close to them.
---
According to an early behind the scenes for 76 they did. They seem to have gotten their help in adding the multiplayer and server coding but after that... *shrug* I feel like zenimax always intended 76 to be the way to make money while original BGS continues to make single player titles, the update focusing mostly on fixes to store items and the amount of time put into art assets (take a long time to make) just reaffirms that theory.
---
there was never more than zero chance this event will fail..
---
So what did u guys donate?
---
It was planned to the 18th anyway in four stages, then a week break before another 4 stages.
---
Rewards from reaching the milestones
---
That event is across all platforms. The steel part of it only goes until the 7th
---
Yes, last 30 mins or so I’ve been having problems.
---
I don't have to provide proof. You have the burden of proof, my guy.
---
It does work doesn't it...
---
Errm yes in a consumer culture the customer does somewhat, have power and the right to direct the flow of capital to some contemporary degree.. I mean, we keep these cunts afloat buying cow suits and black versions of guns..
---
I saw a thread where they are done and might patch in any day, but has anyone heard officially, I was really looking forward to getting those.
---
Project Alpha runs until the 17th for everyone
---
Its built on sand sadly.
---
it's still 1 dollar an hour so I think it's a good balance. Personally I'll never buy atoms but I understand those that do.
---
3,4, and NV are great. 1/2 are GREAT. 76? It could be :/
---
Unfortunately I'm on Xbox.
---
This is one way of doing it i guess, i am not going to say you are wrong for having the mindset to be upset at Bethesda..it does produce results. However i think the developers are in abusive relationship with their community which is why their team is so demoralized always receiving venom every time their is community engagement.
---
It's not the fault of low-level individuals who work on the game and the staff who reads the Reddit. It's the knuckleheads who are in charge of marketing and direction.
---
I remember pete hines saying he had to tell developers that replay ability wasn't a focus...even though the entire MODDING community is all about that. So i think some leadership is out of touch.
---
You maybe you are right that the only way to break through all the silence is to hurt them in the wallet.
---
However, i still genuinely believe we could also have an impact if we engaged as heavily in a positive way as well using this as a way of introducing new ideas. It's already brought to their attention through the backlash maybe they will be more willing to listen to things about this subject from the community in a more positive  way?
---
So technically I'm throwing Bloodied Throwing Knives then?
---
What platform are you on and what kind of internet do you have?
---
Where did you read this? 
---
And I haven’t had a server crash in a LOOOONG time (months?) so... clearly it wasn’t happening much.
---
Pretty much :)
---
Of course you do, it means you don't have to aim. The tesla is super OP in PvE and PvP. Hence the nerf making it so arcs don't bounce off the ground. Its already fixed in the PTS, they just accidently broke the fix for it with this update. This is something the PvP community has been requesting for the last year.
---
So what you are saying is there are still PLENTY of boots for you to lick... but I guess you'd be doing it even if there werent;)
---
I have yet to see anything from BGS in this regard.  What is the source please?
---
Also, with the torrent of backlash against 21, I'm not optimistic they'll pay any attention to this issue.  It would have been easy enough to offer the original captain cosmos bundle again to quiet some of us down,
---
Well it’s not recommended to drink rainwater in real life either, so it wouldn’t be any better after a post nuclear apocalypse.
---
Also, a literal water-well produces dirty water in 76.
---
You all must be new :(
---
Perfect!
---
I suppose I should upgrade to Tomahawks for the extra boost, those are still somewhat in character
---
Bethesda is known for their games with permanent bugs.Over the years many have been fixed or there are work arounds for it if you're on PC. I have only played Fallout 3 and newer on PC. Without going into a history, console commands for a PC game can be really fun and help with glitches.There are times I REALLY like building but with the nagging food/drink thing in 76 I like it even less. Lag is largely your ISP and their server less on your hardware and software as long as you have a better than average PC.People in Fallout tend to look like better claymations of their ancestors. There's no way you're going to get mocap level on everything.Seems BGS has been hiring people who are inexperienced in their engine which also needs to be replaced. There's a lot they did right but sadly things keep going wrong. I'd rather them take the game offline and implement a permanent fix to most of the problems before turning it back on.    
---
Concerning Fallout's future.....it better not be online from now on. I LOVE the fact that 3, NV, and 4 are solo experiences. The only real variable is me when I play. Fallout 5 must return to being solo. However, some games(I can't recall) have an online mode and I'm not experienced in it so I can't say much.
---
You're not even a true bethesdander because fallout 1 and 2 aren't even made by Bethesda's. Fallout 3 was there first attempted at it and if it's only a fallout 1st thing that's just dumb putting behind a pay wall.
---
I stumbled upon it myself trying to make an owl faced building I used it to get rid of the ghost turret leftover, it really wasn't super effective and could be why it didn't catch on.
---
You gotta give and take
---
It's well known that dupers have millions of junk stockpiled
---
Pinging u/ladydevann ; u/valseek to the thread.
---
I know it's being investigated but can we expect these to be added via hotfix or will we have to wait until patch 22 drops?
---
What’s the issue with the Future Tec Camp skin? I’m just about to unlock it.
---
Ok, Todd...
---
i did 10k. so did 2 of my pals. Another did 5k. 
---
So there's 35k right there.
---
Why do I have to proof this? The possibility is high enough that some people act liked this. But why don't you have to provide proof?
---
They also drop from the event Distant Thunder at a rate roughly 4x as the rate from treasure maps. Just not quite as farmable.
---
Wait, lol. You mean I changed "them" to "the rights"?  Again, check the OP's title. If you don't understand this thread is about the rights to the game then choose another hobby than reddit toughie.
---
You know what? I'd even be okay with it destroying the excess ammo if it meant spending less time in that damned terminal screen. I really don't care that it destroys 20 X .38 ammo if it auto-recycles 6,000.
---
Ahh I see.
---
But they don’t benefit from twisted muscles, gladiator, etc. I don’t even think they benefit from incisor, but don’t quote me on that.
---
Basically they’re strong at the start of the game but don’t scale. A bloody stealth build with a sneak attack can take down a scorched with one, but I mean, you can take down a scorched with a strong sneeze, so...
---
Tosh, it's just at a line and a number in a database.  Having 10 of something or 1000000 makes no difference.
---
What’s does it mean?
---
So I have built a few pvp arenas and floating walls are the only way to make everything fit.  Are we going to get a better way to do floating walls and roofs that are unrealted to any atom shop purchases?  Additionally would any solution to interior walls cost us more money?
---
At this point the way you have changed the build mechanics has driven me not to play.  All I enjoy doing was building and not all the cool floating stuff I used to take for granted is gone.
---
Why not field this idea amongst your players first?
---
What did we do to deserve removal of an element that we grew to love in our designs?
---
AD VICTORIUM!
---
I'm pretty sure those numbers are true. And i guess it also follows zipf's law. 80% of that junk was donated by 20% of players who want a lot of atlas provitions to dupe or collect
---
I mean it was just in the store recently I think
---
it lags in regards to the fuse, so you have to try a few times if it doesn't work with regards to the t-fuse. You should be able to analyze the blood if you did not install the t-fuse yet, which is the most important part. It isn't a surefire way, but its the only way it worked for me after two hours of testing.
---
I think Titanfall 2 when I see this
---
Your logic does not track good sir
---
I'm not sure. I swear I just saw it though. It was in the greatest hits
---
I found a good scrap run that is totally safe and it gives me tons of weapons mods plans. I just go to emmet mountain (which is 200m from my camp, give or take) and kill all the settlers (they don't aggro if you kill one of them) take all their weapons (at least 2 each) and go back to my camp with 150 pounds of stuff to scrap. At least 400 steel, tons of new mods and it just takes a server hop to reload.
---
Yes, there is a difference. Barely.
---
Not having the skills is a management issue. The skills exist, either elsewhere in the company itself, and quite possibly the modding community for FO4.
---
If it's ignoring the bugs, it means bad developers, and management failing to deal with them, or bad management leading the effort and priories.
---
But in the end it still comes down to how the project is run in general.
---
In the end, we still get screwed, with no action on Bethesda's part to address it.
---
But these patches *are* adding more glitches
---
CAMP Building is still special.
---
Totally, I've been running pretty much the same build since launch and have always had this issue. I feel like since Wastelanders I've noticed it happening more frequently, but at the same time I'm desensitized to it
---
But Fallout 1st and the atom store is a huge revenue stream for them.
---
It depends on how bothered you are by it, but for me, the main one is the hand holding the barrel is clipping into it. 
---
I know they say your weapon is an extension of yourself but that's taking it a little too literally.
---
Yeah my friend just told me I’m just to dumb that I let that pass
---
Side with the Free Radicals against the Wayward so you can get their mask.
---
Toxicity is criticizing Bethesda's failures?
---
Some people here simply can't take a joke about their almighty developer...
---
Maybe give a a two-sided blank wall.  No one wants that nasty exterior on the inside
---
Member, you made MODUS proud.
---
It isn't? I thought rainwater was very pure.
---
Awesome tip! My gaming style never really required it until now, but quick google on hardware and you are absolutely right: There is something called 'key rollover' and n-key rollover will be a feature of more expensive keyboards. Mine is likely 2 key rollover (it excludes ctrl alt shift). 
---
Tbh and a bit ignorant I thought by being wired would be ideal.
---
I'll explain better. A lot of things follow that law, here is a [vsauce video that explains it](https://youtu.be/fCn8zs912OE) . All i'm saying is that it takes a few players with hundreds of thousands of duped steel/grinded steel to finish a big part of the event
---
Support must be crazy busy at today
---
&gt; in atom shop
---
Calm down, Satan.
---
Errrrm. Ok?
---
Which makes absolutely no sense.  Cooking with Boiled Water should give rads while cooking with Purified Water should give less rads or no rads depending on the ingredients used.
---
Purified water is more useful to me as 5 caps.
---
If cork gets a lot in a day then maybe I’ll be skeptical because after hours and hours of playing I only have 700
---
I for one will be protesting the arrival of these so called bastards of steal. Not having some tin can wearing outsider taking mah jerrb!
---
Bonuses and tropical vacations for the execs, obviously.
---
Yes but only during the weapon dupe glitch, still no one really got banned on PS4
---
It’s actually easily attainable with just 250k players. If the entire community actually participated it would have been completed in a few hours.
---
Purified water isn’t that easy to get for new players since they wouldn’t have the plans or mats to build purifiers, so boiled water makes more sense to use for cooking because it’s more common to get since you can literally get it from any water source
---
Yes, this is how all the strangler heart power armor got duped so it is a thing
---
Add in the still missing deep pocketed mods for secret service limbs while you're at it.
---
I’m gonna keep an eye out for it, thx for letting me know this!
---
Because you all continue to play the game. If people continue to log on it doesn't matter to them. I quit a while back and don't regret it for a second, regardless of investing 1200 hours in the game.
---
As a consumer you're voting for what is acceptable with your time and money. Letting them do this non stop but continuing to play the game is counter intuitive. You can't demand better and then support the developers when they give you shit. Because you support the shit. So they keep giving you shit.
---
VATS has been broken from day one with certain weapons like the crossbow and railway rifle. The bug just expanded onto the other weapons more recently. Don't count on a fix ever.
---
And I even doubt they broke the building workarounds on purpose. 
---
 But what? No more waterborne protection from the chinese stealth suit? Why???
---
I was thinking of doing that soon anyways. Thanks.
---
Knowing Beth, they would say they added it to the game but then it would end up being a wall with two exteriors.
---
Thanks!   It's so interesting to see what others do.
---
I don't have to provide proof because I didn't make the claim, you did. So again, where's your proof for this baseless claim?
---
Dont worry, you'll eventually find some respect in real life.
---
I had already completed this quest which is why I’m confused.
---
The overworld and main quests (when functioning) are on par with previous fallout games, and the map is better than fallout 4's in my opinion. However the monetization has become more and more invasive to the point it becomes diffcult to enjoy the simple pleasure of Bethesda exploration.
---
Highly recommend playing fallout 3, new Vegas and 4 if you haven’t already done so... I also encourage you to play all the DLC for the games although I’m slacking and haven’t finished all the fallout 4 DLC I can tell you that what I have completed is an amazing experience.
---
Also Fallout 3 has best dlc cmv
---
I said it before and i'll say it again. Fuck the brotherhood.
---
Also, I like that pve players are finally seeing what pvp players have been bitching about
---
The end of the world, I know.
---
It falls under main quests so I can’t abandon it.
---
How great would it be if the community had the opportunity to shun the Brotherhood by not donating anything? Would be cool if Bethesda implemented another set of rewards/story path based on the conscious decision of the players to not donate.
---
I don't have an update for this just yet but will let you know when I hear what they're doing.
---
Its painful how accurate that is
---
Provide evidence, I implore you.
---
Lol, knowing Bethesda they would probably read this and say “these people want their own liberator, well they have a raider collectron, why not reskin it and make a liberator skin for a foundation collectron”
---
I understand the frustration with most of the legit issues. I get frustrated with issues, and have put in my fair share of tickets, sometimes that's the only way stuff get's fixed.  I just specifically think it's petty to bash the developers for fixing a known glitch that you're exploiting, because it affects how your camp looks, or no you're no longer able to place. I'm a fo1st paying player too, and have bought every game since it hit the shelves 1997. I was merely stating that fo76 IS better than when it first came out, and I think they are working to make it better, that's all. /me battens down the hatches...
---
Its mainly gauss weapons that are affected by this bug. And bows too, because of the chargeup/draw before firing I suppose.
---
They dont have you do that, they wipe out organized and established synth groups because, as DiMa proved in Far Harbor, a semi-immortal being that has complete autonomy and a disconnection from humanity can cause massive destruction.
---
damn
---
Go to Xbox Live and sign in, and then account setting under your game tag pic. Then go to services and subscriptions. Fallout 1st will be in there and click Manage.
---
Proof????
---
Thanks for lmk.   Why do you think they treat FO76 like the scapegoat of the family (in comparison to ESO)?
---
Gotta nuke something
---
As a general rule, when someone makes a claim, the burden of proof is on them. The burden of proof of the opposite is not on the person questioning your claim, as they're only questioning your claim because you haven't provided evidence to back it.
---
It's a generally understood position when debating positions.

---
 &gt; I don't have an update for this just yet but will let you know when I hear what they're doing.
---
If it was made by a competent dev team, who actually listened to the player base. And the game was given enough time and money to get stuff right the first time
---
Then another multiplayer fallout could be brilliant
---
However at this point id be very surprised if we got a fallout 5, because of what 76 has done to the brand
---
You'll always have the fans, who will give any fallout game a good go, but i think as far as appeal to a wide market, fallout has had its day
---
Nada. Ain't gonna donate ever. The payoff is lame but I know others will so I'll just enjoy the rewards as they come
---
K bud, have fun with that inferiority complex.
---
Yes they are, i had received a message that i already had received my Atoms on the Account im playing, but that was not the Case i was wrote the Ticket about... They dont even Read Tickets, this support employee  only worked according to the description the Ticket was filled onto the System, dont even read my ticket...
---
Feels like there are only 2 Support Employees are working for Bethesda... Sad.
---
I hope that's true but I can believe it was donated. I donated over 40k last night and I've heard that called weak stash numbers by other fo1st players.
---
you're not a whale. they only care about whales.
---
They patched the assaultron scrap method. It wasnt intended "exploit/glitch/dup" and they patched it and banned people for it. Why are you being so standoffish? This is simple logic: I'm not trying to be mean... Are you perhaps being defensive?
---
You’re going to need to add the “don’t tread on me” flag wavers to that pile as well. Authoritarianism doesn’t sit well with them.
---
Thank you.
---
Dang,thanks for the feedback though.I had no clue what was going on
---
You are not the only one, looks like a PS4 issue only though.  Theres quite a few posts exactly like yours.
---
exactly, they should however add the possibility to choose which type of water to use, it would be more convenient for players who have a lot of it.
---
Never left. Always been here. 
---
And planning to stick around, seeing as your reactions over simple non-offensive comments were so entertaining, Kevin.
---
I tell you to enjoy the benefits of the glitch and you cop an attitude?
---
Heh, that’s hilarious.
---
The gold machines will actually reset when you server hop.
---
Running wire through the doorway then turning it into a solid wall with means that you need one less power conduit with would inevitably crash the server. /s
---
Ta jerk mauh jherb!!
---
Not true. I know two people still banned.
---
You should try support again. If you do a chargeback Bethesda will likely suspend your account.
---
That's not quiet true, I used half metal walls on my exterior full height walls combined with slanted roofs to make supports for my over hanging upper floors.  I rather like the effect.  
---
This "fix" breaks more than double sided wall paper.
---
Those are lilley the same people who post that its impossible to play the game without it now. They are wrong but it shows how the subscription makes players feel like they are trapped.
---
It's real. I don't but I know folks in this realm from before the display case/vendors were patched
---
The BoS ending to bunker hill is to murder the runaway unarmed synths, all they are trying to do is go live normal lives.
---
Even I’m for the BoS as I love military style stuff, and I ain’t giving them anything. I couldn’t care less about booze and grenades ffs.
---
I’m wondering if this was related to the camp budget exploit.
---
Just a sad day and completely unnecessary. This "fix" never needed to happen as it only impacted... nobody.
---
what you say is incredibly true.
---
a lot of people are loosing their minds over loosing something in the game that was originally not mean to be there, and because now it is gone and become an inconvenience to them, the world of Fallout is over for them (or so they say). i personally didn't even know about the double wall exploit thing. mainly cause i was never told about it by other friends and never tried it to begin with. Like you i'm not defending Bethesda with their handling of the updates and fixes. i get annoyed with the countless bugs but i also don't feel like typing a mile long angry letter about my displeasures with the game and just continue on playing. i enjoy it it as it is, just wish for a bit more event based content.
---
Yeah choosing would be better, but personally I’ll stick with boiled for cooking because I don’t usually carry a lot of purified water
---
You need modules to craft for the gold bullion stuff which is much better than any other armor or weapons you find in other places.
---
So bullion is used for plans, and scrip can be used for vault steel to craft strangle heart armor or modules for guass weapons and secret service armor. You don't really need modules until you start getting gold bullion stuff.
---
Bethesda when hackers and cheaters ruin NW and hacked weapons Adventure mode: *\*sleep\**
---
Bethesda when somebody places double-sided walls to get wallpapers on both sides: *\*YEET\**
---
Really? I  didn’t notice this when I playing yesterday...I would have to check when I get on later. Also, what platform are you on?
---
Trying to get it all out of the scrapbox just... Hurts....
---
the real crime is the friends we made along the way.
---
What ever way you deliver steel it’s up to you, i have my way and only this way my delivery works... 🤘
---
Because the boiled water is part of a recipe. To be able to craft with purified water, Bethesda would have to make a second copy of every recipe, and change them to use purified. And then, you’d have two recipes of the same result in your menus.
---
Yeah that option doesn’t even show up unfortunately
---
That's been an ongoing reward 'package' for months
---
Good shit getting it though, still rare as hell
---
Ok so they make content for all players and not just people lvl 400 with bloodied builds
---
Wheredingo... damn man, that's gold!
---
You missed the text on the Chinese stealth suit helmet which falsely claims that it protects against disease. They couldn't even fix a damn line of text.
---
It depends on a lot of things, like where you live, are drinking it straight out of the sky or is it pouring into some container like the barrel from Atom shop.
---
Air pollution will mix with water during condensation on top urbanized areas and acidic rain/humidity is dangerous even when breathing it.
---
And given how we have literal rad storms moving in and out in, I can’t imagine the atmosphere being that pure.
---
Not to speak of all the nukes we are dropping on Appalachia.
---
makes sense
---
Except the Brotherhood hasn't tried to rule over any people, the Institute would most certainly be those peoples' enemies.
---
Was it once or multiple times?  How much SCORE are you getting?
---
If it was once, I’m wondering if it might have been a lag from a prior SCORE award.
---
Right, what people are saying is they would rather the game fill with bugs and break then test and fix the game for free while Bethesda continually disappoints large chunks of the player base. Think of it as a bug report strike. The worse the state of the game, the worse the reviews and player experience, the worse the bottom line is in sales (IE all the people canceling their FO1st the last few updates). If Bethesda didn’t have the paying player base as it’s testers the game would be crippled.
---
1 and 2 SUCK ass.    
---
Turn based, top down 3/4, anal seepage graphics? F that.    
---
3 was my start into the Fallout wasteland. NV got boring after playing it too much. 4 isn't perfect but it is done well and the addition of Building is good. No game will please everyone or their expectations. Like it or leave it.    
---
They really need to step up on 76 and all the problems including the BLAND mediocre rewards for quests. Random shit gear this char won't/can't use? Let it sit in your Vendor b/c 'everyone' wants to stupidly be a Fallout Gazlillionare or scrap for Script and getting shitty returns on 'random' Legendary picks.    
---
It's done on purpose. All MMOs are designed to be a time sink with little reward.
---
Didn’t play fallout 3 but f4 dlcs were pretty solid I encourage everyone to try them.
---
They still got your money.
---
Not gonna pay and play anymore? Oh well, I guess we’ll just shut down the servers and move on to another grift.
---
I’m not saying your words and actions are meaningless, but I am saying that Bethesda doesn’t care because they already suckered everyone in with Fallout 4, 76, Wastelanders update, Skyrim ports out the ass, and they’re gonna keep doing it because they know they’re the top in the unhealthy relationship between their audience and their IPs.
---
I’m just saying if u glitched ur camp then get mad they patched it don’t think u will get anything out of it
---
Same, a 1st/ Beta player here and I barely have 500
---
I'm asking for evidence of accounts with 100s of millions of scrap
---
Day one BETA player here too. I cancelled 1st 3 months ago and haven't picked the game up since. Never really had an issue with bugs that caused me aggro but the direction the franchise has gone as a whole just wasn't for me. I get enough grind at work. The game just ain't fun anymore!
---
Given your track record on fixing things I would surprised if:
---
a) this actually fixes the issue at hand
---
b) gets any real attention, just like all the other issues you have acknowledged and failed to address.
---
Over promise and under deliver must be a motto there or something
---
Could be but I don’t understand why they wouldn’t  just tell us that was the reason
---
And your complaining about it. I would imagine if other people are getting the same results they would want you to shut the hell up. Just sayin.
---
On a scale of 1 to invading Russia in the winter How would you guys rate this Atlas run?
---
&gt;  lag from a prior SCORE award.
---
This is the answer. Same thing happened for me. Someone bought 3 things but the score pop up didn't appear until I got out of my armor.
---
Xbox 1 and I can confirm
---
Ah yeah, you're right. Damn.
---
Please join me 8/8 for a no log in protest and mass fo1st  subscription cancelation.

---
True, some of my mutations aren’t suppressed
---
In short, yes.
---
I was playing all morning and mine was working fine
---
It’s every time I exit the armor and It’s probably 250 idk
---
It’s something, but unless you got the plan they’re hard to acquire, and they weight almost 3x as much
---
While I agree with you that the amount of outstanding bugs is crazy, the people that make the cosmetics for the ATOM shop are very much not the people you would see bug fixing, or even would WANT bug fixing.
---
An artist is not a developer.
---
Oh no they’re gonna be so mad! :fart:
---
ah capitalism, sucking the value away from the end user as much as possible
---
Oh, it can definitely be made to work. But there are some issues.
---
The first issue, which is by no means insurmountable, is what to do when the player doesn't push the button. Because if the player can just put ammo in the container and leave it there, you don't have an ammo *converter*, you have an *ammo storage box*. Which is something that probably should be in the game, but would be put behind a paywall like Fallout 1st. So you probably need a timer where ammo automatically gets returned to your inventory after a period of time.
---
The second, much bigger, issue is that code doesn't always behave the way you'd expect in practice. Coding step 3 sounds very simple, but there's a major likelihood of a small delay between pushing the button and removing the ammo from the container - a delay that can be potentially exploited to gain free ammo points by putting in a bunch of ammo, hitting the button, and removing the ammo from the container after the game has calculated how many ammo points to give you but before it has removed the ammo.
---
So if Bethesda did it this way they'd probably be playing wack-a-mole with dupers for the next 6 months as increasingly complicated exploits are found and patched. Which might be fine for a core game mechanic, but I can see why Bethesda don't want to go down that path for a season reward camp object.
---
If you can find fallout 3 Game of the year edition on sale for 20.00 or less then grab it, the game is worth it and imo better than fallout 4... fallout new Vegas is my favorite game though
---
Jokes on you,I’m not logging in anymore.Dont have the time.
---
But I’m looking forward to the elder scrolls XI tho,hopefully it will be better than TES IX,that was a really shitty game.
---
Egg head for example
---
Ah, the desperate, last ditch insult. Even though the accuser just argued back 'n forth about how a fictional factions members wear boots or not. Dont really have any room to throw that stone bud.
---
No, crit shots are pure shit. Check angryturtle's videos, he talked about it.
---
I'm only sorta crazy....I mean they are. The voices. I mean....uh what's that?!
---
Expel brotherhood, expel foundation, expel everything. By the forces of nucs. I loved Appalach the way it was without people.
---
It really is a bummer. A lot of the good bugs relied on doorway switching. Doorway logic was something I was just starting to understand.
---
they should only add the ability to decide which type of water to use without creating new identical recipes
---
The team being demoralized is not our problem though. They're paid to do a job. We're their paying customers. We pay them for a service and they're expected to deliver. They don't. Over and over and over again.
---
Look, I get it's all run by people and stuff but the very simple fact of the matter is that Bethesda are not delivering on a service they are paid to deliver.
---
This isn't a charity, it's a business. It doesn't matter in the slightest if one of the devs is having an off day or their having trouble at home or the like. Either you deliver or you don't. Bethesda has been doing a lot of the don't sadly, hence the response. 
---
Like I said, being nice about it hasn't helped one iota. If this doesn't make it crystal clear for you, nothing I say will. Bethesda just an hour or so ago responded to the wall "fix" issue because of all the people cancelling their Fallout 1st subs.
---
On the other hand, the promised features that Bethesda said they'd implement and have failed to i.e. deep pocketed mod for SS armour, absolutely zero response.
---
I go by the facts and evidence as they are, not as I'd like them to be. Don't get me wrong, I'd like for them to be the way you're suggesting. However, Bethesda just doesn't respond to reasonable (or unreasonable) complaints and feedback. If it doesn't involve the loss of short term revenue, they just don't care.
---
To be fair, this sounds like a pretty fucked up situation.
---
Thank you for fixing the glitch, I'm all for Beth fixing bugs
---
It is. But becoming less so each time they try to "fix" things that don't need fixing.
---
And having to worry now that I can't do my old tricks when fiddling with power (gotta keep that ugly wiring hidden) makes me unwilling to even attempt to play with my setup. My legacy CAMP will remain as is until such day that they reverse course on this disastrous "no, it's your fault" mentality and make building less frustrating.
---
So probably never.
---
bro i sold a bloodied 33 handmade for 3k caps bc i had a tse!
---
Aside from the reports of lackluster rewards, there was absolutely nothing about the story or "entrance" that made me want to donate. 
---
1. random repeating vague radio message
---
2. random guy asking for milllions of caps worth of material to help a group he's never actually had contact with and we have no confirmation of. 
---
This is literally the definition of a scam. If you want me to donate mats by the truckload, put in some effort on the story.
---
People on this forum can be very loud with their opinions, but not everyone who plays this game is even on this subreddit. It is possible that we will not get the rewards (which I honestly hope happens if we don't do it because what's the point of this if not to have consequences for actions), but there are many people who don't look at reward lists or simply give what they can to give. 
---
People are upset with the rewards, I'm included with that, but that isn't a good poll for all people who play this game.
---
Que?!
---
That was the only suggestion I could think of, because I've had that issue as well. I've also heard, go loot all the adds, then come back to see if the loot has appeared (2-3 minutes later).
---
I don't think the engine can actually handle "either this or that" recipes so you'd need 2 recipes for every single item. One for boiled water recipes, one for purified water recipes.
---
The game already tends to choke when you mass cook so this would only further decrease performance.
---
That's fair. I can only provide context. I had a friend once give me 100 balistic fiber. I was low level thankful and confused so i asked for clarity. He was a present duper and (Yes you guessed it he is banned). He expressed having "legit millions of most raw materials". I have no way of uploading something not on my account but based on what i saw from this player prior to ban: it's more than plausible. I'd say probable. I know you want evidence. This i cannot provide. Just common sense and a suggestion to be LESS contrarian.
---
I was dressed like Braveheart when I wrote this.
---
I get what you're saying but they still do care, the Atom shop and Fallout 1st are their main money makers and consistent source of money. You underestimate how much they get from those two things...
---
I’ve had this happen a few times and tested it with a build 5 floor or wall decor challenge while in my pa and it didn’t count it as complete until I exited my pa which leads me to agree with you on lag or it might be a new bug. I’ve also noticed every time I go to the legendary run page it’s real laggy when trying to traverse the page to claim rewards
---
Just keep an eye out. It comes through a lot
---
As a daily player, I don’t know why anyone would want to make the player experience worse. We would be hurting ourselves.
---
I don’t see any point in cutting off your nose to spite your face
---
They should be fixing bugs with existing maps/mesh/textures.
---
There are numerous.
---
Like a parrot... "BAWK! Downward spiral! BAWK! Dumpster fire! Totally unplayable! BAWK!"
---
That bums me out.
---
Well it is a sandbox lol
---
I seriously don’t get any of them problems
---
Why did you literally copy and paste Bethesda’s exact post? That’s the most pointless thing you could’ve done
---
And then they ignore all the feedback from the PTS.
---
Or bases built in high up places.
---
Why are you sorry though?  Aren't they supposed to be pr?  Its their own damn fault for lack of communication and their opaqueness with their community.
---
Just burned 5k (20 donations) of steel to see what rewards were given. The rewards are jack shit. Never donating again.
---
Same question.  I get op is mad but I'm not sure exactly at what
---
I am aware.  They should be fixing existing bugs with maps/mesh/textures.
---
its happening on pc too
---
That's not toxcity at all, it is not wrong to voice your displeasure with a product you bought. We have every right to, and it isn't toxic. Toxic is sending death threats to Beth employees, not saying "This new event has shitty rewards."
---
Wrong, during the early years, the Brotherhood secured routes through the savage divide for civilians and traders to pass through. They also led the fight against the super mutants alongside the Responders. It was only after a member of the Brotherhood, Hank Madigan, deserted and joined the Responders, did their relationship go south. And they actually were the only ones capable of dealing with the scorched, as the Free States, Responders, and even the returned Raiders all came to believe.
---
So it isn’t just the S.C.O.R.E. that auto completes itself with no rewards! With almost the entire playerbase alienated and pissed about almost every aspect of this game; how could we not believe the donations are inflated. 10 million in first 24 hours sounds more feasible, but still improbable. I myself have huge stacks of scrap, and once this community challenge is done I will go back to dropping random amounts of essentials at the door to Vault 76( if there are people actually starting to play the game still).
---
Point blank range if melee.
---
Yeah I'm still gonna play, I still have enjoyment from the game. Only action I am taking is letting my F01st expire for now.
---
I hate to sound like an idiot, but VATS is broken? How?
---
Childish, yes. Unfair, no.
---
"For example, we’re discussing what it would take to implement double sided walls."
---
Seriously? How incredibly hard can it be to make a wall that can be wallpapered on both sides....
---
haha
---
That’s how I build as well
---
They also removed the floating camp bug which is so stupid because it did no harm and allowed players to test their ingenuity and make truly amazing structures without needing a set of stairs to ruin it. I can’t bring myself to play the game anymore after seeing them acting like this fixing bugs that made the game fun and did no harm but leaving all the game breaking bugs in the game.
---
With a shotgun ... lol.
---
Ok I’ll try that the next time it happens.  Thanks!
---
Also the floating camp glitch which really pisses me off.
---
Ok. Stop playing the game. Message sent. No """""figures of (edgy) speech""""" required
---
Disgusting
---
So you essentially can’t swap out a doorway for a wall of the similar building set? What the fuck. 
---
That wasn’t a bug to begin with lol
---
Yea that happens with me too
---
You know support is a 3rd party company, right?
---
It's not an engine problem, it's a developer problem.
---
They rarely give details about exploits when they patch them (or any other time).  I don't know if this change was related to some exploit, but if fixing an exploit removed the ability to do this, we may not hear any details.  They're not going to say that was exploitable, so that people don't look for similar exploits.
---
I doubt this is what's going on, more likely they fixed or changed some other aspect of building that inadvertently stopped this.  Or they're going to be selling interior wallpapers in the atom shop.  Take your pick.
---
&gt; Cork has the highest payout for loss of atoms for BGS. Another double  score event likely means less people having to spend atoms to complete  the Legendary run. 
---
Debatable given having the legendary run costs them more in atoms. As does giving away 120 dollars worth of atom for 99 dollars for a year of subscription. 
---
&gt; Some junk is piss easy to gather i'll agree, there are tons of guides  available for farming it. Other junk like cork, not so much. There arent  many good places to farm cork, which means if you dont stockpile ahead  of time, gathering during that donation phase could be tough if you dont  have a private server or access to a stash box. 
---
Debatable given cork comes from stuff like golf balls that always have several dozen there at any one time. 
---
&gt; Which means again the alienated Vets and First members are expected to  donate their junk for no incentive, so that hopefully we carry the  community through the challenges. 
---
I'm a Vet and I'm not alienated at all. 
---
&gt; So again, explain why Vets and First members should bother to donate? 
---
Because it is a community event.  And I really can't give you any more because I really don't have an egocentric view of the game were everything has to benefit me directly and fuck everyone else view when it comes to events like this. I will contribute and if we make it Yay and if we don't I shrug and move on. 
---
&gt; Im more incentivized to sit and watch the event fail and hopefully act  as a wake up call that we are getting sick of recycled rewards, than to  actually waddle my way up to Atlas and donate. And based off the posts  and comments Im not the only Vet that feels that way. 
---
Failing the event won't change anything save losing out on the bonuses.
---
Doorway to solid wall is needed to make a rounded building as well. No more making a rounded birthday cake building in game anymore
---
It's in the container category I'm pretty certain.
---
I dont care about that Acount, this Account have nothing i need or try to play on.
---
"because of what 76 has done to the brand"
---
Might want to tell Amazon about that, since they are making a TV show under the brand.
---
I don't think there's many "game-cripping bugs" wrt the maps/mesh/textures. IIRC the major ones (that came from SCORE items, like the ghillie suit problems) were fixed with the latest patch?
---
Also, for a community that seems voices so much scorn for the atom shop, people here also get super pissed when it's not updated. Were you here when it was updated like an hour late during the Fasnacht debacle? Not pretty.
---
and just like that you lost all credibility to your own argument.
---
I never said they dont kill synths, it's just not their primary reason for being there. And even then, those same synths could, at any point, be wiped or turned hostile to all around them, solely at the behest of the Institute, with a simple phrase. Not to mention that the Railroad clearly isnt doing its work very well if they decided holding a dozen escaped synths in one place was a good idea.
---
Stash
---
I find it ironic, you start posting about creativity in camps yet show complete lack of understanding of the creativity by simply not testing the fix for this yet unnamed exploit you claim you fixed.
---
It is as simple as rolling back the fix, and re-working it, because anything otherwise you will just sell in the Atom shop or as a Fallout 1st item.
---
You do not deserve one inch of breathing room or forgiveness, patch 21 is a damn mess, out of all the exploits and broken things in the game, you continue to ignore what bothers the community, the very people paying you for this game and fix things to piss off the community?
---
I am staggered many are as forgiving as they are, but that will wear out one day.
---
The wall "fix" impacts a lot more than just double sided wallpaper. You can no longer "sink" an object into a doorway and switch to a wall for example. If you have a vendor that you hide behind a wall when not active, you must remove the wall if you want to place the doorway and this could be problematic due to decoration and or wire placement. I don't think they fully realize how restricting this change really is and people have been going on all year that the camp system is very restrictive already.
---
this shit is fucking comical.
---
If the double walls took up double camp space (which I don't know as I didn't try using this), then no it's not about performance.
---
Thanks for posting your thoughts i found this conversation very enlightening. I just wanted to have a positive thread where people posted their ideas. God only knows how many negative threads there is dedicated to this subject already.
---
Yep. So no more easy swap, sometimes I have to redo everything to move one wall or floor, so it's a major kick in the ass.
---
No more double-sided wallpaper, no more garage door over windows/doorways, no more round bases.. what else am I forgetting??
---
Bethesda hasn't replied....
---
It's a variant of the default Vault-Tec Stash box
---
I don't use adrenaline or gunfu, using a death claw gauntlet,  and despite hearing the hit land, the enemy sounds off that they were hit, a huge splash of blood, but no damage is dealt, and that's when it even let's me swing and just let's me sit there at point blank taking hits.But without using VATs enemies will rush right through my swing or barely side step it somehow.
---
Well I'll be damned ! Thanks!
---
Thank you sir!
---
it's all saved server-side, so if you're using the same account you're good. all you'll lose is photos you took.
---
Steam summer sale you can ussualy pick up the entire fallout franchises with dlc and everything for less than 50
---
im playing on PC (Steam)
---
I'm not sure if its the same issue, but I feel like my shots hit but don't register in VATS.  Like the audio makes a thud sound as if the bullets are making contact, but the health bar doesn't drop.  I ended up switching from a Fixer to a Handmade because I do more damage aiming manually now.
---
The first two. I haven't played them. I've played fallout 3 new Vegas 4 and 76...
---
This is how the pvp community has felt for months
---
MODUS is life
---
Flux disappears when you die at SBQ now. That way griefers cant take it.
---
It’s a money grab detour. FO5 will be good because it’s single player and that’s what they are good at imo.
---
Stop fucking ruining it for everyone else. You don't like them. We get it. Now shut up and complain in silence
---
I donated 250 steel yesterday but then went online and saw the crap their giving away for doing it and theirs nothing of interest no real rare plans or anything so don't see the point in wasting resources or the caps travelling to it so won't be donating anymore.
---
NOICE!
---
And yet they failed. Because they wouldn't get off their high horse and properly ask for help from the other factions. Even when you consider them helping the Responders, the terminal and journal pages detailing it always come off as painting the BoS as a sort of knight in shining armour come to help the less fortunate, rather than as equals working together.
---
oh god i thought it was just me cuz my internet's been shit lately. this is an actual thing? man. that sucks.
---
they have responded to this  
---
what do you mean
---
I only said that because of how 76 is generally represented
---
Look how many posts get made on this sub asking what state the game is in, and if its worth picking up
---
Of course some people will just troll, and youtubers dont help at all by shitting on 76
---
I'm more referring to the general gamer audience, that will buy the game, complete it and move on.
---
Not the die hard fans of fallout, who will play the game over and over again
---
Bethesda patch bad. Reddit gold, silver, and other awards good.
---
The flux disappears when you die after the queen fight. Its important to stash it asap after the event.
---
Would never have thought of looking there , thank you
---
This was happening pre patch. It seemed to happen whenever you'd play for awhile
---
I feel you, I play and stream every day as well. Worse case scenario is the game continues to be broken in a myriad of ways, best case scenario the game continues to be broken and without players sending in reports Bethesda is forced to actually hire people to test the game professionally and things get fixed.
---
I'm having a lot of trouble with this. Trying my 8th server to try and farm some Squirrel Bits, and over half of what I kill is unlootable if it doesn't spontaneously die when I simply approach it
---
Nice and easy today 👍
---
RIP building community, another tool taken away
---
When you die right after SE, you will lose your Flux. Nobody is taking it, it disappears if you don't stash it or manually drop it and pick it up.
---
"bethesda shouldnt own the rights to the franchise!"
---
"i never played the games that were not produced by bethesda tho."
---
you sound like a bandwagoner, just hating on bethesda cuz it's cool.
---
Bethesda, you ignorant slut.
---
They do not typically crosspost to Reddit and I received an alert from the data miner discord that was a couple of minutes old. The forum thread also only had two replies when I made this.
---
But they forgot to enable the mods to be bought so they still not actually added lol
---
Lmao naw bro... you took it far.  Mine is sarcasm... you sound like you really believe it haha;)
---
Wtf does that have to do with a videogame? Kinda insensitive, no?
---
Source: Jewish.
---
I’m confused about the bitchfest going on about this. I started playing in March and had ~50k steel scrap I wasnt using at all. So I donated it, actually made 8k caps off the provisions.
---
These sourpusses just keep on drinking their own lemonade and hoarding their useless scrap. That’ll show Bethesda for sure.
---
I'd help out more but I need that steel to keep the Action Hero fed.
---
I'm WAY ahead of Dr. Zorbo or w/e he's called and haven't spent a great amount of time grinding. Definitely complete all my dailies and weeklies and took advantage of double XP/Score events.
---
The turn in of resources for another double SCORE is pretty lackluster. I will complete the lvl 100 board long before the enemy does w/o any other assistance. Now farming up thousands of resources for another Plan: ivory handle revolver  is just stupid imo. I'll save it to make ammo.
---
Considering I had to convert 152k of various ammo's for 22k .308. It's Bethesda's mantra. you put in 7 times the effort for the little we provide ... and you're welcome.
---
They failed as a result of shutting themselves off from outside help, after having members desert to other factions, namely the Responders. Yet many Responders joined the Brotherhood, namely Scribe Grant. The Brotherhood had actually been helping civilians for some time, just check the logs in Big Bend.
---
I’m just trying to get the chicken coop than I’m out for an extended break.
---
...my IGN is TheScotchBeast.  I do not approve of making stew out of my various meats.
---
Yeah. I am dubious about the cork. Everything else will be hit i believe. But that would b a little far fetched getting that much cork. In 2 months of having 1st i've only collected 2168 of it. Not that i have actively been seeking out like i have with steel and lead.
---
My main character's CAMP is going nowhere.  In fact, after the last update I now have 2 legacy CAMPS if you want to call them by that classification.  At least, the "rep for dev team" today finally said they'll look into double sided walls.  Of which, I don't even use, I just have to support fellow builders who do.  Poor choice of words I'll admit.  By compensation I meant alternative like the dev team creating an official method to do x,y,z instead of a glitch.
---
Cause of people like you who complain in silence Bethesda is getting away with stuff they are doing! No go back to Todd and lick his back passage... but your tongue probably can’t get brown anymore than it is already...😂
---
You mean, other than you making the same points other people have been making for months?
---
You the type of guy who listens to video game boss music in public thinking you are such a badass.
---
My helmet makes me special
---
Its been pretty much all of them.
---
Let me get this straight, for any veterans, there is nothing new and this is not worth participating in because there is no NEW reward for this grind?
---
Do they know if you have uninstalled your Steam copy? I uninstalled the old Bethesda launcher version and installed the Steam version. Or do you need to delete your account too to really send the message?
---
I'm going to play all fucking day
---
If my use of """"""""figures of (edgy) speech"""""""""" offended you then sorry (not sorry). Not trying to be the second asshole in this conversation. If you don't like what I post you can voice your opinions then leave and I'm free to post whatever I want. But I'm still hoping that the game will get better so I won't quit on it.
---
Smort
---
I'm not allowed to have fun in Fallout 76?
---
Oh that's fantastic! I guess i missed that patch note. Was it recent?
---
That's so Bethesda!
---
I stopped playing long ago. The loot system and loot in general is AWFUL. Combat system leaves a lot to be desired
---
The update reset all videos preferences and settings, go into settings and change them to what you need.
---
On PC, the update deleted the fallout76custom.ini file, so if you were using a custom ini file you'll need to recreate it.
---
Meh. I deleted the game earlier, but not out of protest or anything. I just got bored of it.   
---
Same reason I dropped it last time. Seems 76 can only hold my attention for a month or so at a time, then I take a year off.
---
I have updated the OP to include the list
---
Idk, that was the reasoning Bethesda gave.
---
"""abuse"""
---
Global warming, erosion of civil liberties, undermining of democracy, crumbling infrastructure...but yeah you go, get all civil disobedience on a subpar vidya game.  Get some, buddy.
---
Wow... Fantastic job trivializing the plight of an oppressed people.
---
I actually enjoyed multi player part, it is refreshing! I really dont like is how missions are made, very... shallow in content.
---
?? Missle Silo State?? Which tape?
---
Ah yes, this poem about Nazi Germany absolutely relates to a video game. 
---
Like yeah, we all knew Beth dropped the ball with F076, like real hard. It was FOs first foray into multiplayer and it did not work well.
---
I just hope we move back to single player fallout, and then maybe Beth can salvage Fallout from all of this.
---
I’ve collected 1000 in a week not even trying now I know where to look
---
Last fall, I think. It's been quite some time.
---
Yeah, you can no longer just spam your way through and hit and exit short cut. I have an intermediate level of coding knowledge and I could tell you that an iteration based system without an exit command is a horrible idea. It’s just one more option in the interface that brings you back to the beginning. This is almost as sloppy as an infinite loop without an exit command.
---
This is very helpful, thank you!
---
I can see that...
---
No worst case scenario is the game gets bad reviews, people stop playing, game stops being profitable, game stops being supported. There is zero good that could come from actively sabotaging the game. It is short sighted.
---
Seriously?  You haven't seen or heard of any exploit that didn't lag or crash a server?  Or did you mean specifically about the wall thing?
---
Russia is beautiful in the winter tho.
---
Indeed, especially over a video game no less.
---
Tbh there might be a few mistakes sometimes but pretty rare on my end. I usually have a fairly smooth gameplay now a days, sure there might be one enemy who is stuck and cant be killed or attack you but I see that as such a minor issue. I love the interaction with NPCs, building, the new team system, and now that some perks that were crucial got fixed im loving this game more than I used to. And thats coming from someone who didnt even want to play Fo76 because I thought it was a disgrace to Fo4 and the rest of the series. But I am actually enjoying this game finally and not a hater like I started out.
---
What happens to the community being nice and friendly. Smh. Just cause I haven't played the first two games wich Bethesda didn't make doesn't make my option invalid.
---
Ah shit, I have missed out on rep!!!
---
Yeah, got that all mixed up with the haste of making the comment. Oops.
---
Yeah not sure why he thought that worked well lol
---
I’m assuming it tied up a loose end on how you could stack walls to dupe the strangler heart armor back when. It’s literally the only possibility I can come up with.
---
No it’s not. But 75 MILLION in a day?  Doesn’t strike u as a huge amount considering the rewards are all garbage?
---
They won't. They're here cherry-picking praise posts and some year old issues to say they're still looking into them. Gotta justify salaries without getting their feelings hurt somehow.
---
That was discovered within minutes of the Atom shop update last week. Top Men are on it right now.
---
I'm not gonna report it but I don't want him in this or the appalachian community ostrcizing people and shit. Ffs
---
The good thing is it's not like you're giving the game away. It's all still there if you decide to come back in a few weeks/months and check out what's new.
---
I wandered trough the deep trenches of the first beta session, saw abominations I couldn’t describe even if I wanted to, super mutants fused with the ground itself, screaming in pain. I saw the world collapse on itself multiple times. Scorches asserting their dominance by aggressively t posing. Stretching limbs and bodies frozen in time, invisible guns and silent gunshots. We started out small with camps that could hold barely enough to survive. People worshipped the power of ancient relics of forgotten wars : the black powder weapons. I went back to the vault and pleaded to let me back in. We were not ready. We should have never opened the vault. We should have never stepped into this cursed reality. 
---
It has been two years since I stepped into the wasteland, yet I cannot unsee the horrors of the past. When I close my eyes at night I can still hear their screams.
---
Based on a cursory glance at those statistics, I think the numbers aren't exact.
---
Good point pretty sure this has been covered a lot lol
---
Can we open up the process to the community by sharing the bug list and letting everyone vote on what is important?  Then prioritize accordingly.  Understandably the Atomic Shop cosmetics are separate, but for example no one asked for the Purveyor to be an icon on the compass.  We all knew the Purveyor was at the Rusty Pick.  Non-issue, but apparently given great priority.  Meanwhile many important things remain broken.
---
So you deposit steel in the lead up to the BOS arriving back in Appalachia so they have a base of operations.
---
LOL ... yeah, like 95% of the time. :)
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/422354/recent-c-a-m-p-fixes-in-update-21?language%255B%255D=en
---
Not what they said here, though I don't pretend to keep up with everything they post about.
---
I dont think anyone working on fo76 has played the game in months
---
You're kidding.   (Looks at Bethesa events page.)   Geez, you're not.   I am amazed.
---
Hard to imagine as V.A.T.S. is a signature feature of the Fallout games.
---
What settings are those on console?
---
level 23x (or something like that) - I don't have gun-fu card yet.....
---
Thanks, friend! This means they had a whole week to fix it before update 21 and totally dropped the ball (again)!
---
... You don't even use the wall trick everyone was pissed about. Which means that, rather than refusing to put more money into it and just playing the game you already paid for in some sort of gesture of solidarity, you're quitting because other people are unhappy with a thing not even relevant to you.
---
And not some moral imperative thing, like I saw a lot of with Borderlands 3. At least that was over an actually immorality. Because of a unintended option being removed.
---
My mind is blown. You gain nothing by quitting beyond a tearful dramatic goodbye and some fake internet points. You don't even gain the whole "boycott Bethesda" thing. You already paid for it.
---
Don't get me wring, I am quite discontent with this, and I actually used that trick extensively. And I sure the hell don't buy Fallout 1st or atoms anyhow. But to just walk away for no other reason than to join the disproportionate public fury... Well, that's your gig. Hope things go well for you. Don't tell your wife ;)
---
Of course they are. Do you honestly think they'd publically announce that the majority of their player-base gives zero fucks? No matter how many materials are *actually* donated, the "community" will exceed all goals.
---
Yep - it is
---
A lot of people upset with this last update are cancelling their FO1st memberships.
---
It just might happen.
---
It can be summed up easily. You play their game by their rules, they don’t make the game according to yours.
---
Mhmm, I just hope he realizes his mistake and corrects it.
---
That would be a start but it doesn't address putting wires through walls.  
---
Nor quickly changing out doors for windows/walls when you're playing with the configuration.
---
Don't worry, they'll bring 'em back.
---
..as part of a 1200 atom pack.
---
No one here will honestly know. As far as I can tell they will rotate those items sometimes and other weeks it’s just been the same item. I can’t get on where I am, since the storm knocked out everything. But if it’s the same items today. They’ll probably be there all week.
---
Making sure it's done correctly....
---
You could do with learning that lesson on a LOT MORE THINGS WITH FALLOUT 76.
---
Power down, go outside.  I hear there is a big ol world out there with lots to see and do. This is all very reminiscent of the Allen Iverson rant....
---
We aren't taking about real life, we are talking about a game..... A game man, not real life, we are talking about a game....
---
Here's something that affects my camp, do you intend to fix the [reflection issues affecting AMD graphics cards?](https://i.imgur.com/vqssGQd.jpg) It has been an issue since the steam release.
---
It is a pc game too, dumbass. It is just as bad on pc
---
You put your steel in a box and pretend it’s content.
---
Maybe you can make powered walls that hide power connectors and wires behind wallpaper. So you place a wire in and out of walls using a custom power outlet that comes out of the wall. 
---
Also allow phasing of objects inside other objects,
---
At this rate seems I will be waiting a yr for the chance to get the mothman fog machine I missed out on.
---
That's why im passive RN. Im heated just trying to keep level and patient. *wheeeeeeew* breathe
---
I just donated 6k steel to the BOS and got a lot of beers.
---
It no longer gives STR and END :(
---
Were getting close to the point of “ToDd HowARd is LiteRaLly HiTlER”
---
I'm guessing you're relatively young? This is how games looked. You're comparing and old ass p.c. game designed to mimic table top games that were popular af at the time to a 3d looted shooter.
---
Oof
---
I was half way through challenges yesterday and remember what’s the point I don’t get atoms for them and I just finished battle pass.
---
bahh-ha-ha-ha-ha, they \**already*\* did it. Thank you for the link. I'll be sure to share it around where appropriate.
---
Roughly 400k across all platforms. Down from 1.4 million at launch. https://www.gamersdecide.com/articles/fallout-76-player-count
---
That was patched awhile back though right? I'm trying to understand why they've decided to implement THIS change now.
---
You got triggered enough to defend a fictional faction but you do you and make your assumptions to feel better about yourself. Good day.
---
Fucking Brotherhood of Snowflakes
---
Yaaaaaa..... This is awkward.
---
Sorry to hear about your power outage, but yeah it’s honestly annoying since the items typically rotate daily with discounted prices and all..
---
Not even. Any combat shotgun I pick up can kill anything on two legs with a VATS blast to the face. Gulpers, anglers and larger creatures take a few shots.
---
Edit: I'm talking about up-close combat. of course you can't touch the gauss shotty in terms of ability to kill from farther away compared to a muggle shotgun... but at that range i'm more comfortable using a rifle with a larger clip and more accuracy.
---
"...which could cause exploits and performance issues to return."
---
What exploits? What performance issues?
---
I don't know about anybody else, but I am so very very sick of Bethesda's "Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain" attitude with it's players. If you want us to accept this, give us detailed reasons.
---
Words like "exploit" and "performance" lose their impact when Bethesda lets known bugs and performance issues that cause tangible impact to the player base go unaddressed for months.
---
What about your build?
---
Let's start a revolution
---
Yeah, I apologize for his insensitivity. Looks like he went ahead and deleted it.
---
Now, excuse me, going to watch the intro of Fallout 4 again since it's one of the greatest cutscenes ever made.
---
Hope you feel better soon
---
Not rewarding bad behavior is a positive in my eyes. I’m not a hostage to this game... if it fails because the company doesn’t do it’s due diligence it’s no skin off of my back and I’m sure most people feel the same. Hopefully Bethesda will learn a lesson. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Damn that’s rough, I’ve been waiting for the vault boy and girl mascot heads to make a reappearance and last I saw they were available in March of this year and haven’t been back since... It’s so frustrating to say the least lol
---
This is art
---
I can’t believe that anyone bought subscriptions for this shit. If you buy a subscription to a broken game, that’s on you. The company clearly does not give a shit and I don’t understand why people still defend this total crapshoot.
---
If you are on Xbox or pc, try the game pass. So many great games that will only take you between a day to a week to complete. It’s so great getting a nice fulfilling game experience without feeling like you have a second job. I’ve been playing these live service type games for so long now, I had almost forgotten what that’s like.
---
When will you guys add zetans to the game? Just wondering
---
It's probably not exact. I'll probably do a couple of self test. For example after I quit fo76 the tracker messged me my session playtime and added it to my total play time. I'm assuming I could just run my own timer to compare the times. 
---
Idk i just think it's pretty cool how something unofficial can time track 9000+ players on all Playstation platforms. it even tracks my Netflix on my ps3.
---
300Mbps isn't a total indication of what you're playing with.  Latency is a huge factor, and would effect all of the things you mention (for the most part).
---
Laggy controls sounds like video latency, though it's hard to tell without seeing what you are.  When I crank up the settings and play on 4K, I feel like there's a 2 second delay between anything I input and what happens on the screen.  VERY sluggish.  If I turn things down, or play on a lower resolution, things feel totally snappy.  (I'm running on a 1080, so I'm a bit behind the times).
---
Canceled just now
---
Mine seems to be working fine. Have you tested it, or are you just going by what it says in the PIP boy? The PIP boy descriptions don't always show the correct information.
---
So you’re saying I look VAT in these jeans?
---
No clue. I’m assuming 500k but that could be WAY high. If I knew that number I could roughly know how many people are actually doing the event. So either a majority of the player base isn’t participating or the number of active players is significantly lower than my estimate.
---
They broke this quest with the latest update. Unfortunately, you'll just have to wait and hope that they fix it quickly.
---
So I’ve been having this problem on Xbox. So when you see a enemy that’s legendary go over near it as for like a ghoul hit it by bashing it and it will get up but get stuck. Then just sit there bashing it until it dies but you have to hurry up and hit the pick up button right when it dies. You have a half of a second to get it or it disappears. It sucks I lost so many guns from this until I said screw this im going to find a way it and works. That’s how I got my furious explosive black powder rifle
---
I've been missing CRITICAL shots in vats lately (not every time, but often enough).
---
You’re only hurting yourself.
---
Hello Everyone,
---
We want to acknowledge this is something you care deeply about.
---
Too bad.
---
As always thank you all so much for your feedback.
---
PS. You'll see this fix soon in an Atom Shop near you!
---
It's ok.  Bethesda has been dropping the ball for years so now another company can take the mantle of this genre away from them.  Cyberpunk gives me some hope but I'm not going to buy that either until I've seen gameplay and reviews.  It's simply not wise to trust marketing at all - even from companies who have/had a good track record.
---
I can’t, sorry. I have to sit here and list why the latest patch is the worst thing ever.
---
This issue is VERY apparent with the gauss set weaponry. I have used VATS with a 95% hit chance and have MISSED with every shot. I'm also noticing that the enemies are becoming harder to kill by either some weird healing factor glitch or an increase in their coding. Before this patch, it took me almost a full clip to kill a mirelurk king with a bloodied dark matter automatic combat rifle. It now takes 4 AND A HALF clips to kill one now and its not just one but 7 i have tested this on at 3 different locations. I agree, these weak ass patch works need to stop.
---
I think people missed your reference, but I want you to know I got it! Lol
---
Hardly. My statement is based of the games you have made. I'm not critising the first and second titles. I'm critizing the most recent two. Fallout 4 and 76. It's far too obvious that their morals changed after fallout 3. Everything changed to a quick cash and dash and leave everything to be half heartedly done. Resulting in two meh games and the developers knowing that people will continue to buy into their bullshit. They deserve everything coming to them with the most recent patch.
---
It's not about the collecting, it's about the stockpiles, not even trying my main has 27k Steel, yet despite me collecting Golf balls (Plastic) and Globes (Screws) I only have 500 Cork
---
It's only the worst until the next one.
---
Stop blaming devs.
---
It's totally management fault and in normal companies up to top management everyone should be punished in one way or another.
---
If they care about the game itself.
---
No. It will be a 2500 wall bundle. Subsequent bundles will be 1500 and 800 for single painted walls respectively. Also BOS themed will will require 500 hours to farm from an event and 250 steel to build. No sign of doors... That will come in a separate patch.... Likely patch 30 when we can finally  fight Earle.
---
Note: sarcasm above is based in hindsight at previous Bethesda goings on.
---
Ok Karen
---
How do they even manage to F that up? Thanks to our almighty god Turtle tho
---
They spout more bullshit then a politician on election day.
---
The whole game is embarrassing.
---
Fallout 4 is worth it for everything but the story. If you’re into building, world exploration, and gunplay then FO4 is for you
---
But.. but patch bad.
---
Notice the 1st icon on one and not the other?
---
[https://i.imgur.com/bivw4HU.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/bivw4HU.jpg)
---
This is exactly what it is. Same thing with being in your pip boy I believe (at least that’s what I experienced last night)
---
And fuck that persons camp apparently too lol.
---
Man I can’t argue with that logic I stopped using mine after getting a bffr Gatling gun because 5mm is so damn easy to get lol
---
Yep I know. Just saying if u know where to get cork you can aquire a lot quickly. That being said if that gets 75 million in a day I’m calling bollocks
---
Your camp doesn't show up on the map for anyone,including yourself ,when using the skin.
---
Vats in 76 isn’t anything other than target lock on. Mix that into a multiplayer game and it’s a mess regardless of the players ability.
---
I'll do my part... one poop grenade at a time.
---
Bethesda took away a building mechanic and the foodbuilds are crying over it even though this has been happening to PvP players since the beginning they feel entitled to whine about it
---
Hmm thats weird we did line in the sand and there was hella meat piles and didnt cause a drop but this is on PS4, that sucks it happened on PC and Xbox.
---
What?
---
I must admit I have felt really tempted to do so as well:
---
I really don’t like that Bethesda didn’t gave alternatives to the players that don’t want these new BoS to settle in Appalachia, whether you don’t like the faction or for roleplaying reasons your character (mine is an Enclave member) wouldn’t support them.
---
... You need therapy for video game addiction if FO76 going away “hurts”. Literally nothing changes but the game I launch on my console if this games disappears tomorrow.
---
The exploit was patched,not the wall thing that could lag the server.
---
Yes I think there is zero benefit and I don't plan on participating in the THIRD meat week. The BOS can shove their goddamn collectron where the sun doesn't shine.
---
I don't have any stats to even speculate. Neither do I have any real interest in the BoS. But these crates aren't the reward. The rewards are collectively reaching the goals. 
---
And as far as the crates being garbage, I agree... but junk is junk. And steel especially is super easy to accumulate just by picking up and scrapping weapons. If you have it to give, give it to reach the community goals which is the real prize. If you don't, then don't. 
---
Either way crying about it is getting really old and tiring.
---
Lol it's funny that you think you know why people are downvoting you.
---
Meat/ashpiles are broken and causing this. Make official bug report.
---
Welcome to Appalachia, mutha fukkas! The Brotherhood is implied, but I like the way you think.
---
LOL... you think the game has more than 250k players?
---
as an example I notice that birdbones was giving me -4 agility, as soon as i un/re equip it showed -1. And yes I was going off what was said in the PIP Boy
---
1. Way too much to list 
---
2. Way too much to list 
---
3. Don’t see the need for that, just make small improvements to help balance some of the weaker weapons with the god tier. 
---
4. I don’t think so. Just strengthen other builds to match or at least come close.
---
The thing is last Summer it was "Play the Game - get stuff" If the community Challenge was Kill 1 million Scorched - 1 Million Mole Miners - 1 Million Blood Eagles - 1 Million Cultists, then we'd actually be killing stuff and playing/leveling up instead of using our time farming for resources we could use for other repairs/crafting/building. (although you do get resources from killing stuff) It would also make sense to reduce the number of cultists and blood eagles before BOS was able to move in.
---
ATLAS is now a camp dead zone apparently.
---
I never said I was leaving because of the wall trick, I said I was leaving as I feel the devs are out of touch with the players and that's from a combination of many things over the last 6 to 12 months.
---
Also I have used the wall trick around the back of the base quit a lot, but I accidentally destroyed a part of it and couldn't remake it (also added to me been annoyed,) it's why I only showed the front and inside.
---
This post was just to show off a base I was proud before going
---
Being fair the individual rewards are overall pretty bad and after a single day the community is already over halfway past the required amount, so I don’t think doing this will affect people as much as you assume:
---
The Brotherhood Fatigues underarmor was reclassed as an outfit and no longer can be modded with the lining mods.
---
Gotcha.
---
It works now. Best to just drop 1 point on it. The other 1% increases each point are not worth it. 1 point is already 6%.
---
I am almost to that point.  I want to believe ... I know this is a super-complicated coding and engine mess ... but man.    
---
At this point, I will be happy if they fix the cheaters, permanently this time.  That's what burns me the worst.  They are hurting the good players, the ones who love the game, and letting the dupers and ammo collector glitchers run wild.    
---
Again, I know it's hard.  It's complicated beyond what my brain prefers to handle (I was a CIS major and got sick of it my junior year and switched), but they have GOT to have people listen to the players and people that actually play the game.  A decade or so ago, I worked for a company that launched a DISASTER of a web site that was built by very smart people who did not participate in the activity the site was designed for.  The users despised it, and part of my very thankless job was to run the company blog.  Needless to say,  it was horrible, and that company has still not recovered to what it was pre-site-launch days.  I hate to see that happening to the Fallout franchise, just in slow motion.
---
I enjoy playing the game and would like to continue being able to. Thanks for keeping it civil.
---
In my humble opinion,the largest problem is simply communication. What is said, and how. More importantly what is not said. From perk card descriptions to game changing patches there's almost no clear communication. Everyone makes mistakes, if they could be explained then they would get a lot less anger from the community. Not telling testers what to to test????
---
ah yes, leave that to beth.
---
you arent just criticizing 76 though. you said bethesda shouldnt have gotten the rights to the franchise. without them owning fallout, 3 and NV wouldn't have been made (a detail you apparently didnt realize, based on your other comments). not to mention the company that DID make 1 and 2 also made Tactics, which got a mediocre reception at best, and Brotherhood of Steel, which everybody agrees was trash. so it's not like the original company still owning them would have been a good thing either.
---
companies make missteps. and they deserved to be called out on them so they can fix their mistakes and do better. i am not denying that. but the exact words YOU said- that bethesda shouldn't own fallout- rings hollow when you've never experienced fallout without their involvement.
---
I fully don't believe that you won't take advantage of *any* of the benefits, but okay.
---
At this point its like placing your camp next to the prime fissure site, i feel bad for them but they are too close to the blast zone
---
You're not missing anything. Move along. Nothing to see here.
---
Im not offended i just think its adorable
---
"Hey don't you know how lucky you are to get to buy this game play this game and pay extra for everything! You don't know how good you got it!" - Bethesda
---
wasted nukes
---
Wait for it ....
---
That's Bethesda for you
---
Ok Bethesda, I've read your response to the community and I find it vague. Since you supposedly fixed some nasty bug, please provide more details about these exploits they were causing. I'd like to think this community is generally pretty nice and understanding, but you just "fixed" something that most people thought was a normal building mechanic, that had some (possible unintended) extra features you could utilize to build some cool structures. Then you reply to the massive community uproar with a P.R. damage control style of reply. Please do better!
---
Easy things, ty
---
Pretty sure it’s a bug seeing as it wasn’t in the patch notes. I submitted a ticket.
---
I don't know why, but that particular insult out of the many many many I've seen on the reddit these last two days made me laugh.
---
Also, if they were paying attention they could have left the server.
---

---
in the basement they moved it for fortifying atlas and messed up the markers such a rarity for bethesda!!!
---
don’t even waste your time
---
I don't even play this, I just wanted karma tbh
---
They even put some answers to those lore questions! For example, why do people use caps? Well, the robots at the Whitespring were set up to take Nuka Cola caps as money due to a promotion that was in effect when the bombs dropped. So the economy was a kind of robot trade standard. Reasonable, hardly alluded to!
---
I don't use a console, google fallout 76 video settings for your console or just experiment.
---
 "Could and were being used by some individuals to take advantage of unintended exploits".
---
How? How could building two-sided walls taking advantage of anything? Other than using wallpaper we bought and paid for?
---
Blame the players as usual... EVERYTHING IN THIS GAME IS AN EXPLOIT! Because this game was never well designed!
---
If you are using top tier weapons / builds then it is overkill. Absolutely not needed. I'm not putting it back. If you are struggling to kill stuff, go for it.
---
For something you find "adorable", you sure were makin a big fuss about it
---
i got 100 caps for clearing the silo and some flux stuff from some enemies, though i would have done it for free on principal
---
Hi everyone. OP is correct, Class Freak has issues as described.
---
Keep an eye on all mutations.
---
Thanks OP for bringing it up, have you submitted a ticket?
---
Xbox here.
---
You have to set it active to do the quest anyway.
---
It's too obvious though regardless. I don't mean to be stubborn but it's far too obvious that shift in morals and the direction of the game has changed for the worse. Quite permanently considering two of the recent titles have been very poor in comparison.
---
Same issue, 8-5-20 - 2:09PM CST
---
Tried private world, several public worlds. Powerarmor and not. Seems to be the destination node is corrupt or inaccessible
---
I was going to submit a ticket later tonight
---
Probably a bug. Submit a ticket.
---
Cool.

PS4.

Select "Deactivate auto-renew".

Those are good reasons.
---
Aw c'mon, they JUST started discussing it!!  Give them a few....(?)
---
My sneak builds didn't miss it at all. I really noticed the improvement on my junkie heavy. I dont like gun fu, so will prolly just keep it.
---
If you guy's do add double sided walls to the game, DO NOT MONETIZE them(yet) like you have with almost everything else in this game. The base game items have gotten barely any love/polish since this game released and everything is pushed into the atomic shop. Give us a free option for each building material type(wood/metal/barn/etc.) first, before you add them to the atomic shop.  
---
It will put you in very bad light should you choose to remove our way of doing it just so you can make a quick buck off all the builders
---
That’s legit.
---
Boycott reddit? 
---
What you are doing is just the same, just for a different reason.
---
Not a bad idea, definitely not putting 5 back in though.
---
I wonder how much of that missile counted towards the [75.19 million pieces](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events) delivered so far...
---
This will probably get taken down by mods.
---
In that case:
---
1. No hard feelings, you just do your jobs
---
2. I just needed to air out my frustration
---
Ahh they not de-spawning? It never used to be a problem?
---
HA!! that exactly what i was thinking!!!
---
Yeah, totally agree. I just never even considered losing it as a perk before this.
---
I think we ate them.
---
Do you have any armor pieces that have 15% limb damage reduction as their 3rd star?  Because that will turn pretty much any shotgun into a magic one.
---
I didn’t even think about that.
---
What do you think is really in that canned meat stew?
---
How long were we in the vault for? The cat probably just got old and died.
---
On the fence. But pay attention how many people do you see there with all the great bursting at the seems new content? Seems pretty damn empty on my end
---
You sir are probably not a builder. So therefore you opinion doesn't count. Just sayin
---
No they are just causing massive drops on fps. For some reason. There are few posts about it here. If you look the other way the issue dissappears. My friend normally has 140+ fps on his high end pc, with meatpiles on screen it drops to 10'ish.
---
Thank you for posting this.
---
Now... can everyone please calm down? (gotta show your asses every freakin time)
---
A very possible explanation!
---
Great ideas.  I wish they could sell off FO76 to a competent company who really cares and could fully realize the potential of this really unique and amazing game.
---
What is the 12 below your rad meter?
---
It has a few hour cool-down on each Server, not sure how long exactly, but try switching servers and trying there.
---
yeah it's more the fact they are fixing things that don't affect anyone yet they continue to ignore game breaking bugs
---
The fix that broke double walls via wall-switching fixed something we've all live without for a long while we probably never noticed: doorways attached directly to stairs. 
---
It was a bug that was addressable either by doing the floor-flipping trick or simply having an extra floor tile to serve as a buffer between the stair and doorway.
---
Since Update 21 I've now been able to, with a bit less finagling, attach stairs directly to doorways without wallpaper.  The funny thing is, I've also noticed another problem: the Vault Tec-type stairs are too far off the ground that directly attaching them to doorways prevents people from entering if descending. I had to switch to the less conspicuous rail-thin Red Rocket stairs.
---
K
---
Still not a reason to spam fucking reddit about it
---
Best of luck!
---
Or...CANNED DOG food omg!
---
Bethesda responds to exactly one thing - a loss of short term revenue.
---
Case in point, two issues of the most recent patch - the wall "fix" and no deep pocketed mod for secret service armour. Both had people complain, both politely and less so. The wall issue lead to people cancelling their Fallout 1st sub over it, the missing mod didn't.
---
Guess which one got a direct response from Bethesda and which one didn't.
---
It doesn't matter how polite or fair or reasonable you are. They'll ignore you just the same as someone who is rude, whiney and unfair.
---
All Bethesda cares about is anything that impacts their short term revenue. It's why we kept having our free atom options restricted. It's why bugs that affect the Atomic Shop e.g. free topiary, get fixed very quickly. It's why Bethesda responded promptly to both the player vendor/display case issue as well as the wall "fix" one.
---
Politeness and treating them like people have nothing to do with it. If it did, Bethesda would directly response to those posts that are posted in a constructive and positive manner. They just don't.
---
Ah so it’s based on the server and not the person thanks I will try
---
The patch also deleted pc users game settings and fallout76csutom.ini files leading to tons of players experiencing massive drops in frame rates and killing their friends since the pacifist setting was changed.
---
Complete it and swap servers for unlimited amount of fun!
---
It was right in front of us all along
---
It's depending on the server and if someone already run this event before you join. I think it has round about 1h cooldown. Just server hop and try your luck again.
---
oh bullshit.
---
If building glitches don't hurt server performance,  leave them alone! I like camp building. I used double walls for boarding up windows. Texturing exteriors. Wallpapers for exterior. Why pick that first?
---
Fix magic weapons.
---
Thanks I am just doing it for all of the energy weapons
---
They never heard of try {} catch {}
---
Lol 😆 🤣 serves him right who shoots a man that just heart emojies you in the back
---
This seems to be a new bug/feature came with latest patch. Never had issue doing Line in the Sand in the past but right after the patch it became laggy like shit when there’s a bunch of meat piles in sight.
---
Glad it isn't just me
---
Please communicate such intentions with the players next time. Or put it on PTS first. I'm aware that player may not catch it there, but for this reason you should also make patch notes for PTS builds.
---
The point is, while I still believe in you (which seems rare around here nowadays), you are not omniscient. Making a fix with heavy impact known before it goes public helps you to get feedback from players and you may end up realizing something you never knew before.
---
In general, you should really step up the communication. Many issues with the game are result of poor communication. You only make such post (like now) only when the shit hits the fan. You should make such posts regularly, to outline what are you going to fix and what change. If you don't want reddit for such posts, then append them to weekly Inside the Vault articles. Noone's going to complain when you tell us "We are planning on fixing long-term issue of X and Y" or "We are still working on fix for Z and we think we are close to solving it".
---
my thing is with it, i hit with vats at 1000-2000 damage on an enemy, and then the enemies health fully restores. on REGULAR enemies. but when i do it regularly, without vats, instant death with 200 damage. its beyond broken.
---
Yeah but you keep coming back so its worth it. Hey say something edgy again lol.
---
The Chameleon mutation doesn’t make you fully transparent but it is really difficult to see someone when they are using it. The markers don’t show up unless you are in a team with the player.
---
Cool just a quick question with the extra loot is it randomly spawning or is it in a certain place all the time ?
---
The lack of working Adrenaline made me even consider the real need for Bloody Mess. Most likely will drop it from my everyday build and use it for bosses only.
---
I'm just glad they didn't fix the firework glitch. I love my hyper fast reloads.
---
This is something I don't get at all. There's functionality in FO4 that doesn't show up in 76, I love building in FO4 -- well, with a few mods but generally it's all good. I picked up FO 1st so I could have a private server to just hang out and try out camp designs and such with friends.
---
I have money to spend and, yes, I will happily spend it if I'm getting time/enjoyment returns at my current "entertainment rate"...which I generally price out at about $5/hr. If I spend $5 and get an extra hour of fun, I'm good. That's a ridiculously low bar.
---
Where is my Atom Shop wishlist? Where are my outer wall textures? Why is it so freaking hard to place things? Why won't anything snap to prefab buildings? Where's things like walkways, docks, bridges, plywood? Where's the "action furniture"?
---
I picked this up to try it for a month and I don't know if I'm going to continue, after putting hundreds of hours into toodling around FO4 quite happily.
---
EDIT: replaced a deleted line, ty touchpad. :p
---
If they at least give us double-sided walls, let us wall-paper both sides, and let us change them between windows, walls, doorways, etc, I will be fine.
---
System?
---
They figured that users pressing a button 480000 times will be fun.
---
25 years. pet should logically be dead.
---
Well hopefully they'll actually stick to their word (unlike some people....*looking at you Todd Howard*). If they continue to do this, then they'll find themselves becoming the EA that everybody once knew, before microtransactions
---
The best kill is overkill 😄
---
Xbox
---
Yup, donated 2k steel got shit.  Came to Reddit, looked up thread, confirmed all shit rewards for anyone who has any real time in game, no new rewards and made decision not to participate further.
---
I'm not donating shit. It's my shit.
---
Also don't get close to more than about 4 meatpiles or you'll experience the same frame rate while in game.  They'll even thrown in  black checkerboard graphic artifacts for good measure.
---
75.18... 😂
---
You do you I guess
---
Exactly what the other guy said. I used it as a must have, but since losing it and replacing it with other stuff, I put it back on and it was just pointless overall for my build as I don’t struggle with killing stuff at all. 
---
Since I got the SS jetpack the full action boy is much more useful, as was thru hiker and marathoner in its place. Won’t be using adrenaline anymore I feel.
---
Ufff kill creatures again
---
Empty bs that'll lead to a completely unsatisfactory outcome in 6 months through a half assed item to pay for in the atomic shop.
---
Just like every other time you've tried to sweep blatant issues under the rug and sell a fix rather than fix your core design.
---
Am really lucky I wasn't in the middle if rebuilding my camp for the 80th time when this hit. Will probably be impossible to recreate my camp now, and its not particularly crazy either.
---
Its designed in such a way where 2 separate buildings on 3 different cliffs levels snap together perfectly in a specific juncture between them.
---
I'll kill you and hard boil your insides and feed them to Cerberus as a pre dinner snack, you heatheanis welp. Lol
---
Yeah, I think it was the SBQ I noticed it wasn't actually stopping me from killing her, It does make it easier but it's definitely no deal breaker to not have it.
---
Online games are Skinner Boxes. Mouse presses button, receives food pellet. Don't like the flavor? Press button again. Damn, same flavor. Keep trying!
---
can i drop them though?
---
I'm actually quite thrilled to have seen so many of these posts today. yes, the patch &amp; all other complaints absolutely suck.
---
knowing that more &amp; more people are taking part in making a stance is inspiring me. not from group mentality but from the passion of wanting to see this game to as good as it deserves to be.
---
cancelling my FO1st. not donating to BOS. 
---
I plan on using my final month-worth of filling that bottomless scrapbox with thousands of junk.
---
Was so excited to get Deep Pocket for the single roll that I've gotten a keeper (out of 100's) and then what, its not actually there.  Liar liar pants on fucking fire.
---
Not sure at all but there are like 7/8 spawn places where the loot can spawn randomly . When you know the places after a few runs you can collect them pretty fast solo during the event
---
doing so automatically destroys them.
---
Can't argue with a single word of that dude.
---
Who else would give a fuck. I'm sure there was something that pissed you off that nobody else gave a fuck about. That street goes two ways.
---
Honestly, I think the simplest solution that would require no extra coding is to make wall variants of every wallpaper type with the pattern applied to one side and the other side able to have a wallpaper applied to it, be it the same one or a different one.
---
This might be a complete clusterfuck in the menus but it would be a relatively simple fix that I think would resolve the public outcry.
---
Well..yeah lol.
---
The performance issue with Radiation Rumble is that players aren't PERFORMING their duties and not collecting ore. They're just milking it for XP.
---
Cool thanks
---
I don’t remember exactly what it was but whatever it was, it had absolutely nothing to do with the post. I think he meant to comment it on another post
---
Me too, it made layout planning easier and also gave easy access to reach difficult places by turning walls into doors temporarily to reach a roof for example.
---
it was bound to happen. i knew someone would
---
Oooohhh. I'm going to play around with that.
---
Nice call dude.
---
They have a few different locations they can spawn.
---
Lol why is everyone so mad all the time about this game. If it’s so upsetting stop playing, maybe that will calm you down.
---
https://youtu.be/c91XUyg9iWM
---
I donated 15K steel, fallout 1st and Before that I had 2 accounts and kept all my scrap junk.
---
I have been thinking the same thing.  I will probably keep it but not at 5 points.  I really don't have issue with killing things unless the whole vats thing.
---
Sounds like we have to wait weeks for you guys at Bethesda to "fix" something that wasn't broken. I'm sure all the little things that you've broken here will get "fixed".
---
Same as chameleon armor. When weapon out, and not moving, nothing but a distortion field. If in same group, you have a triangle over your head but no name (dumb).
---
Armor is better because it only requires sneak. Stealthboy mkIII with secret agent is best because it lasts like 5-8 minutes and stays active while running/shooting (pretty sure about the shooting anyway. It’s been a loooong time since I’ve bothered with PVP)
---
Canceled last night.
---
I only used the 3* adrenaline perk anyway but I've started using a bloodied pipe revolver and so I've invested in pistol perks because that weapon benefits from that and rifleman perks, doubt I'd change back to adrenaline unless I change what weapon I'm using
---
Came here to say that, verbatim.
---
You know about reproduction of the species?
---
When a lady cat love so much....
---
Saw it in a Juicehead video referencing a Reddit thread.
---
I think I might actually have [stumbled onto a solution for these issues](https://i.imgur.com/rBrZkT6.jpg) we’ve been having...
---
Using gun-fu helps with vats. When I use gun-fu I don’t miss that first shot as often.
---
I may have gotten the name wrong. It's that super mutant merchant
---
Were talking about limb mods brother.
---
Whats the game?
---
Thats the spirit! Theres the edgelord i told you that you are!
---
Can you fix the bug with Gauss rifle accuracy in VATS that makes them unusable?
---
I want that Enclave tag behind my name. How do you do that.
---
this
---
Donated 500 maybe ill donate 500 again.
---
I mean I donated 3,000 cause I have something like 15K in my scrapbox, so it was meaningless. I would have donated a lot more if there were decent rewards. So I could see that number being accurate considering how many players have first. The real test will be the cork one, because in all the time vacuuming up scrap to put in my scrapbox and after putting ultra-light on all my armor for sale, I've only got like 1K cork and I'm certainly not donating any of that for some caps and booze.
---
the blast zone that you specifically selected, for no reason other than to get some upvotes.
---
76
---
I don't know what the issue is, but getting mad because cosmetics are being released rather than fixes is kinda... dumb.
---
Don't get me wrong, I get it, but those are also (more than likely) 2 different sets of employees. I'm sure the artists doing the new skins for guns or whatever are not the same people trying to fix a bug.
---
It's like yelling at the social media people for a game about your bugs... their job is to post pictures to Facebook, not bug fix the game. 
---
But by all means continue raising a stink about the bug because yeah... probably needs to get fixed ASAP but I don't think yelling at artists is the way to get a programming bug fixed.
---
How does the legendary run cost them atoms?
---
They are giving us recycled assets meant for NW/survival, and they took away the easier in game ability to earn atoms.
---
Ranks cost atoms, 150 atoms adds up fast if your 20+ ranks away from what you really want.
---
You realize printing off atoms costs them nothing? They want your real world cash, tossing you a few atoms for it is as easy as passing gas for them.
---
And umm ya, scavenge the entire golf course and maybe come up with 60-100 cork.
---
Or I do one run through Uranium fever or Westek and come out with 1000+ steel.
---
Cork is totally as common as steel.
---
If its a community event, shouldnt the rewards benefit everyone? Not just the new comers?
---
And if your a Vet and your not noticing BGS slowly trying to slip the blanket over our eyes again.
---
Take another look, because we are long past the point of "oops we messed up again" and much more firmly in "is this all a vault experiment seeing how far they can push and milk the vault dwellers for before they break/quit?"
---
You can only let so much slide before you begin to wonder if it isnt conscious effort on behalf of the other party. Or your a BGS troll/shill and you eat it up.
---
Failing the community events will be napalm for those that want to see the game fail.
---
Pretty sure people like me who warned at beginning that devs doesn't listen. Now look at it.
---
Grahm. He did this to me a couple weeks ago, started attacking my concrete barricades at Hemlock Holes. Never thought about storing turrets
---
Jesus Fucking Christ how stupid are you?
---
No shit it's a PC game too, and the PC version sucks as much ass because Bethesda is locking all versions of the game to the same build and update schedule.  PC only gets updates when they're finally ready to go for consoles.  If they just updated the fucking PC version when they were able to instead of waiting if a patch like yesterdays broke shit they could have it hotfixed within hours, but instead we're waiting a fucking month until they're ready for consoles.
---
This bug drives me nuts. Happens on my Xbox One X, does _not_ happen on my partner's Xbox One. Has existed since the Legendary Run started for me, and has made claiming any levels a pain in the ass.
---
Once every like 15 times I go in there it'll work perfectly. I can't find a rhyme or reason. Some folks say it has to do with play time, it doesn't. It'll happen on boot for me. It'll go away in an hour, and come back later.
---
Fond it.😁
---
It will, someone else will spend in your place. Try playing a different game if you hate this one so much.
---
This isn't Fallout 4.
---
Depends on the situation. Queen fight for my HW guy? 5star all the way. 60% is 60% and the queen is a sponge. The rest of the time? I hardly even need 1star, but I also don’t have many other worthy investments as a B HW PA player
---
Silver lining is that we've gotten a break from "SCORE autocomplete" posts.
---
It's okay to disagree.
---
I'll only be one for you "friend"
---
Disappointing to see it's so difficult for them to employ their own game mechanic properly huh
---
Then they need to add patch notes to changes on the PTS.
---
Blizzard can do it with overwatch, DBG can do it with Planetside. 
---
Absolutely no reason Bethesda can't either.
---
I will be shocked if they fix it before next year.
---
Their own damn fault for putting that shit in the atomic shop instead of making it available through gameplay in the first place.
---
I have noticed it goes away but then I un equip and then re equip and it's back
---
Lol no I said related to the double wall thing
---
So you think that's toxic?
---
fix vats
---
Correct. Easiest way to tell if it’s on cool down is if the one of the three traders for the caravan is not on the watoga side.
---
🤣🤣👍🏼👍🏼
---
So ban the assholes that do that then
---
No point, reported issues are very rarely fixed. Gave up on PTS because almost all issues reported are ignored or bandaid fixed.
---
Why dont people just do one megathread where they discuss that shit
---
Yes - plans.
---
Fusion cores. He's wearing PA and using the alternative HUD
---
Double sided wallpaper is nice but wouldn't be enough for me, it'd save me budget but it still doesn't address my ability to create pavilions using floating roofs and metal beams, using the door of choice on any doorway by replacing it, and snapping curtains to doorways by using a window then turning it into a doorway. I still wouldn't be able to build.
---
there's also cousin Karen...
---
Okay but... 95% isn't 100% 
---
It's completely possible to miss 3 95% shots in a row because it's not a guaranteed hit.
---
Brotherhood of the Steel is gonna be the new end game. Once expeditions come out. Next year.
---
No they aren’t, Duchess is local and came back. At least some of the Raiders probably are.
---
To trigger the event the requirement is less time, more the fact Two named Blue Ridge Caravan Personnel must be at the location at the time, 1 guard, 1 Trader, EG Eugiene and Keiran must be at the location for you to trigger the event.
---
Logically yes...but this is FO76 so maybe Fluffy is out in the wild and has mutated and we’re gonna get a storyline to find them and this will enable us to properly get pets. I hope it includes robots as pets!
---
More like this whole game is embarrassing
---
Wait all my mods work just fine without having to recreate the custom ini?
---
Now you know how the PvP community feels.
---
When I went on a public server last night there was around 4 other higher levels submitting some. But consider though that it only takes like a couple minutes to drop things off, so it’s already going to be unlikely you see a bunch of people turning in at the exact same time. More PC and Xbox servers will also have more lower level players that won’t really know about the event anyways because of Game Pass, so the higher donators will be spread among more servers. And also note that many of the grinders will be doing so on a private server for fresh spawns of resources and total control on workshops, so you won’t see them turning things in either
---
Lol. I finally got this game about 3 months ago after pretty much boycotting it thinking it was turning around. It was fun for a month or two, probably just because I’m a huge Fallout fan. Now I have to really force myself to play it for the daily score, and it’s been 2 days since I’ve even done that. 
---
I remember learning about the vault 94 raid, and looked forward to something to grind to get some rare stuff. Then I found out that was removed. Because the engine couldn’t handle it or something. LOL.
---
I also expected the colossal problem event or whatever it’s called to come with the addition of the gross battle pass fortnite garbage.
---
Really hope they start to ACTUALLY turn this game around in the coming months. Because I find myself falling back into the mindset of “76 is total dogshit and a disgrace to the fallout franchise” everyday. Which sucks, the world is pretty neat, and the community is honestly one of the best I’ve come across in a game.
---
But goddamn, I cannot wait for the next single player Fallout lmao
---
I don't know if it's organized to be called anything in particular (I like alot of flexibility), but here it is. 
---
S 14 - bear arms, bandolier, and full sets of perks to use heavy weapons/shotguns/edged weapon/gauntlet as chosen...might be getting rid of shotguns when it come time for Legendary Perks
---
P 9 - commando, sometimes in use with Glow Sight or Concentrated Fire depending on event
---
E 4 - lifegiver, good doggy
---
C 9 - Inspiration, bodyguards/lonewanderer, travel agent, suppressor
---
I  6 - nerd rage, batteries included
---
A 6 - action girl, sneak, and/or ninja
---
L 8 - serendipity, class freak, starched genes
---
I spend most of my time out of power armor (full set of unyielding SS armor), only using PA for SE or anywhere if I keep getting killed and want to end it.   That *used* to be 
---
West Tek, but now with the Anti-Armor Gauss Minigun, PA isn't necessary there any longer.  
---
On mutations, what I can remember being offline:   adrenal, bird bones, egghead, healing factor, marsupial, scaly skin, speed demon.  I'm level 287 now; just an okay player. My alt is around 150 IIRC.  She enabled me to do both endings of Wastelanders.  :)
---
Yeah, just the first was fun to grind because tingles.
---
BATHESDA Your lame ass “we hear you” is pathetic! You are now the Trump of video game development just realize that.
---
armor weight only affects your ability to sneak while moving. I was stationary throughout the whole test.
---
I went ahead and tested it anyway. as expected, same results:

Why you always so toxic an negative? You've commented on tons of other post toxic trash. You need to get off the internet for a bit buddy.
---
go see a therapist
---
That's great, and was not my sole reason for quitting today. You guys need to fix frigging bugs to make your game more enjoyable. I am not paying for a game in this sorry state Todd!
---
Added!
---
Oh you were in the same server with me i geuss i had that happen too
---
Too much for Beth.
---
Go write a productive comment
---
I paid a month with PayPal and they will block payment if you deselect through their site.
---
Somewhere where their is a list of the plans you can get?
---
It is the mirror ball, I was so excited about the whole thing that I misspoke LOL
---
Same here. Hopefully it’s looked into 
---
u/ladydevann
---
u/Valseek
---
Do you feel better now?
---
Action Boy 3, Marathoner and Thru-Hiker are the exact cards I replaced it with...
---
i mean to be fair there was a vault in 4 that had a living cat in it. now that particular vault had opened in the past to trade with people, and the cat actually leaves and returns to the vault as part of a quest so it could have come from outside initially, but still, that's a cat inside a 200 year old vault. while i say logically any pets in 76 should be dead after 25 years, im sure bethesda will find a way to explain it. whether or not it's a well-written explanation is a matter of opinion, but it will be *AN* explanatikn lol
---
I hope for a new fallout game with a new twist.
---
Lets say you become a mutant and you work your way up to accidentally become smart after getting shot in the head. And you try to be the strongest one to lead the mutant horde to the promised land. And on the way you need to grow the horde by raiding settlements. Basically a giant sandbox of maps 
---
 that constantly changes  during the hordes migration and you can even revisit old locations and the decisions you made in the past and be stuck with the consequences.
---
Honestly? A bit
---
From where I'm sitting, it's everyone else who is being toxic and negative.
---
You've gotta admit. This patch did kick the perfectionist base builders in the prick a bit.
---
And Bethesda rely on base builders to spend atoms. So this could effect future development if they lose money.
---
well it's not that much anyway
---
Lol with a modded gauss shotgun..shoots right by them .2 out of 3.
---
Ticket Number 4 they closed now, just letting paypal now doing their job. Im done with that Company and this Game i just let the paid Fallout first from 01.08.2020  just expire i have paid and play it this month with my community, after this i look for a new game to play, they are not even able to fix their bugged game and fixing nonsense no one asked for.
---
Apart from that it takes 3 months to bring out 1 new event and this isnt even ready to get playable.
---
Still can't Cripple the Queen and force her to land.
---
Thanks for that update.
---
Much appreciated.
---
Maybe you should read the post before commenting something stupid
---
It did, but its not a reason to post what? ~20 a day discussing it
---
i have a pet mirelurk king?
---
edit: you realize you can tame a cat or a dog or other creatures
---
Or maybe its that the games are the absolute same on pc, and you are an entitled dumbass who feela that he should get special treatment for playing on a specific platform.
---
I don't think you can use wallpaper in prefabs either, or am I doing something wrong?
---
What upvotes? im literally losing karma from this post (this was true at the time of initially writing, however this is not true as of the edit), and why would i care about some fake internet points
---
Going to give it a day,or two, and see if it rectifies.
---
Before doing a fresh 80+ Gig install. :-(
---
I wonder if his builds are gonna need to be reworked???
---
Let's open up the development bug/work list to the community. We'll vote on what's important to us, and the devs just work on what we approve by priority of votes.  Simple.  We're the customer after all, and the customer is always right.
---
And wallpaper on ceilings. !!!! 
---
I would love to have the glowing star wallpaper on my ceiling.
---
We see the exact same swarm of "I quit" posts every time there is a patch with any sort of error.
---
Further, you argue both that we all are ignored, polite or not, and that they are also not ignoring us because some things get fixed when we complain and cancel.
---
Then there is an argument that they would directly respond. Why? Because polite though that post may be, any post they make, any post at all, is met with the same tired angry statements. Just look at the thread from the post link Thelnia shared above. They make a statement that they are going to try and find a way to return the interior wall options to us, after explaining why it was removed and acknowledging the outcry, and the entirety of that statement is ignored in favor of more of the same. They literally gain nothing out of engaging with the community beyond the bare minimum needed to convey their actions and reactions.
---
Further, frankly, nobody gives a damn about the missing mods. You remember the months of complaints about how nobody is doing the bullion grind? You notice the complete lack of complaints about the missing mods? You surely noticed the flood of angry "give us back our walls" posts.
---
In short, your post above runs headlong into the wall of what's actually happened previously, contradicts itself, and boils down to "It's okay to be an asshole, I'm a paying customer."
---
You know. Like a Karen.
---
The enclave isn't necessarily the enemy of the bos at this point in the storyline. The 2 groups don't know enough about one another yet and the events of fo1 haven't taken place.
---
Its less hate about the game, more about the way the games handled.
---
I don't get it.
---
This community has become TOO whiny and reactionary. The only thing I'll be quitting is this sub.
---
Yes, my husband had a pet Deathclaw who eventually disappeared. :(
---
I would like a more reliable pet system but it is what it is.
---
Fallen through the floor twice
---
I got used to not using it and have redirected my pint elsewhere
---
Don't buy any more of their products until this one is fixed.
---
I don't get why people are so angry about this. 
---
I'm a avid camp builder..... I've built a plethora of different camps and I could care less about this fix.
---
And they fixed the "visor headlamps" too. The visor type skins (like the Primes) were broken, the light came out of the right feet, and not from the visor in 3rd person view, only with the T65 PA. It is fixed, it was mentioned in the patch notes. I am happy :)
---
That’s what you get for canceling
---
Hey man. Don't ask, don't get.
---
And with Bethesda you've gotta scream like a toddler having a meltdown to be heard.
---
 I started playing in March because my son started playing and saying how good it was, I decided to try it because of fo3 and fo4. I absolutely loved it, especially when fasnacht came out. 
---
    Since that's ended, this game has spiraled down hill, so fast, without a care for their players. I would almost compare it to the way Trump is handling the Coronavirus......sketchy at best.....?
---
  Basically I thought long and hard and realized that it's best to unsubscribe and start a new survival game. 
---
 Bethesda, you really disappointed me.
---
There's different locations but for me it's usually on the right side, then on the left in the middle where you fight the captain. Down where the mole miners are. After that, if solo don't push the button and you'll have plenty of time to find the other two.
---
And it's an awesome base. Don't let my response detract from that. Don't usually see a lot of good in-building bases.
---
Meanwhile, forgive me if the incredible timing gives implications. Coincidentally, they already posted over on the Bethesda forums as to why they did it, acknowledged the reaction others had, and stated how they intend to handle it.
---
Will be addressed in patch #22.  
---
^(lol, just kidding)
---
Wow and here I was all excited to unlock a new camp skin. Goddamn Bethesda
---
Good post, take my up vote.
---
My question is this has been in the game since beta. Why wait nearly 2 years to change it? You didn’t change it when people were duping strangler heart armor. Didn’t change it when people were glitching in weapons through camp. What exploit could be so bad that it happens now and not months or a year ago?
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
How you people continue to give this company money with this Fallout 1st bullshit is the true embarrassment here. Why would they change their ways if you let them scam you?
---
All of this. It’s so depressing, I was so excited for this update and it’s a total joke and FU to the players.
---
I thought I was the only one experiencing this.
---
I'm not. I'm simply stating one thing people were annoyed about. I'm not disparaging peoples right to be angry about what bethesda have and haven't done.
---
I used 5k steel and THEN decided to check the rewards list that was my fault never again.
---
I had that issue a lot yesterday and it's the first time I've encountered it.
---
Hilarious. I meant what is your game show game
---
People always fall back on the "it's a performance issue" crutch to defend this game and the devs. We can only have 30k caps because of "performance". Please, I can't believe people still buy into that crap. They built an awful game and fanboys won't admit it.
---
No one ever mentions the positive stuff lol
---
Steel is easy to come by with scrapper perk.  I have around 25K steel on each of my two main characters.  No big deal... What boggles my mind though is that this is the event's least needed scrap type.  They want way more cork, plastic and glass.  My same two main characters have like 500 cork each on them... lol not gonna happen.
---
I always thought 10, but after this patch I'm guessing 2. And juniors at that.
---
Shouldn't rolling back to Update 20 be doable? Nobody wants the BOS event anyway -- I'm not dumping 8K steel into getting plans I'm just gonna drop on a low-level's feet, and I can make my own beer thanks -- the deep pocket Secret Service mods are still missing, and Colossal Problem's delayed anyway, so just rollback to Update 20, then you can use the time to give us the BOS event with better rewards starting Update 22.
---
Its like talking to a fucking wall.  Bye.
---
&gt;How does the legendary run cost them atoms?
---
Because they are giving a way a shit load of stuff rather then charge for it. If you complete the challenges at least and earn score.
---
&gt;And umm ya, scavenge the entire golf course and maybe come up with 60-100 cork.
---
Good thing people have an entire week to do this.
---
&gt;Cork is totally as common as steel.
---
Never said that. Only that it isn't as rare as you make it out to be. And that due to it having almost no use people regularly don't farm it.
---
&gt;If its a community event, shouldnt the rewards benefit everyone? Not just the new comers?
---
I'm certainly benefiting from it.
---
&gt;And if your a Vet and your not noticing BGS slowly trying to slip the blanket over our eyes again.
---
No what I see is Beth releasing a small event to build up to a major release and people being upset that it isn't being treated like some massive deal. Even though they are given pretty generous rewards for completing each mile stone. And frankly the game isn't a big deal. No game is. You play it when you feel like it and you put it down when you don't.
---
I was just on 76 did my dailies and was starting to do some of the treasure maps I have build up and randomly said fuck it and now I'm on Ark.  And I will probably play that till I say fuck it and jump on another video game or maybe look at some porn if I'm in the mood.
---
&gt;You can only let so much slide before you begin to wonder if it isnt  conscious effort on behalf of the other party. Or your a BGS troll/shill  and you eat it up.
---
It really speaks volumes about someone when presented with someone who disagrees with them they start to scream troll/shill. As if the concept of someone not fully agreeing with them is an impossibility.  That is extremely egotistical and frightfully to common on game forums and social media.
---
&gt;Failing the community events will be napalm for those that want to see the game fail.
---
But it will not. People drastically over estimate the value of their opinion. And drastically over estimate cause and effect.  I've listened to far to many claims of "X will kill Y game" or "X game is dying because I don't like it" only for the game to remain strong and healthy for years afterwards. To take this as anything but egotistical ramblings.
---
You’d better talk fast, because a lot of us aren’t coming back until this is fixed.
---
I actually hate the debuff from hunger and thirst, it makes my game lag down to like 5 FPS and makes the game unplayable. I welcome that one change.
---
Oh I'm sure it will be!
---
I don't think they're capable of fixing it. They've certainly proven themselves inept and incompetent when it comes to bug fixes so far.
---
I'm not an expert, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't work like that. Radioactive particles don't evaporate. The wind blows and lifts radioactive dust in to the air. It rains and those particles are in the rain drops. When the rain hits the ground and dries, you have radioactive dust, and the process repeats.
---
In other words "we don't give a fuck but we had to respond so that we can try to con people into still buying camp items in the atom shop while giving you hope double walls may be implemented at a later date that we never bring up again"
---
$1000 on FO76
---
Guess I’ll keep playing FONV that I got for $20 including all DLC.
---
Excellent! Those are ...usually...fun!
---
Not sure what you mean dude, I was stating one of the things people are angry about on top of everything else. I wasn't denying anyones views
---
I’ve had this issue since it launched (xb1) very rarely it would be quick.
---
There was a community manager commented in a similar thread yesterday that they were intended to be added and they’re trying to figure out why they’re no available. They should be but we know how that goes
---
Thanks for the legwork. Seems like a solid shortcut.
---
(I'm sure someone will find a reason to be negative about this.)
---
Strangler heart
---
Absolutely. All these posts about the same thing screams toxicity. If it was in a single thread, sure no problem. Grieve, be depressed, angry and whatever other feelings you have, but do it in a single thread. Right now it's just a bunch of crybabies.
---
You will...
---
Ok I didnt see that post.
---
I'm at a loss as to why they didn't just do it vendor-style (not that I love the new vendor system compared to buying/selling in previous FO games) and have ammo points as a currency at a given vendor. Ammo vending machines (does anyone use those?) could easily be converted into the same kind of machine for outside CAMP. Pop over to a train station, drop off your crap ammo, pick up some you can use, move on.
---
Bruh
---
You just sound like a master race groupie that wants things first
---
It’s ok- there’s been so many it can be hard to keep up
---
I love this. It looks so good from a distance! Great job!
---
Thanks for your review.  2 units is abysmal.  Guess I'll save the atoms and budget and keep drink/spam collecting out of the sink.
---
I wasn't missing the point or ignoring it, I was stating the one thing (out of many) that people are disappointed about.
---
Thanks, I've worn power armor for about ten minutes of 300 played hours.
---
It’s not their engine. It doesn’t seem like they test their code.
---
You're just upset because it's not what you want to see. One post won't accomplish the same as what's going on now.
---
Well I'd kinda like some new content....
---
Atomic Shop incoming lol
---
I don’t think they test their code. There are too many trivial bugs that go unnoticed by them.
---
Signed.
---
Especially when every new content patch they release only brings more and more bugs that are not getting fixed. It seems that with all the fixes and bugs it's always one step forward and two steps back.
---
Thats why I'm on the fence. Steel is easy, the true colors will show with cork and other harder to get resources.
---
What? Explain please
---
They have "marketing gurus" running this shop. They do not understand or play the game. But somehow they think we can live with endless bugs but heaven forbid if someone was able to place an interior wall on the outside. The server would crash and humanity would question its very being if someone put wall paper on the outside of a structure.
---
I mean I want new content. Endgame is boring rn
---
The clunky UI of the converter, the craft time being 15 minutes vs 5 minutes. There will always be something negative to say about the ammo converter.
---
I’ll put this out here too since people are saying it’s underwhelming — Shotguns are highly effective when using VATS and stealth.  Don’t need a special legendary for it or even the “magical” kind.  I had 3 points in shotgun and a 100% accuracy vats shotgun and I OHK tons of enemies.  Not even specced for it and I’ll take down a level 76 yao in two hits.  Properly specced or with a good shotgun it’ll be ohk.  
---
Problem with running a heavy build is you won’t be able to max out shotgun and heavy perks.  I run a rifle/heavy/shotgun hybrid.   Use shotguns, lever-action and handmades.  For SBQ I swap to rifle/heavy.  
---
Originally I was going for melee, but wasn’t getting the kills I wanted.  But, with strength points I can mix and match at will for melee/shotgun/heavy all while keeping rifle perks
---
Preach it Bro! (I also concur about the BOS Atlas event... all I got was alcohol and crap floater grenades for all the steel I donated! Useless junk.)
---
It's a side project and probably a testing grounds for some future project just like the Skyrim port was a test for Fallout 4. It's pretty clear that 76 has been a low priority for Bethesda. They handed it off to a new studio who only had done one game after rushing it out the door to make a release date. And the only times it actually gets fixed is when they get their main team involved like they did with Wastelanders. Right now their main team is likely working full force on Starfield and the next Elder Scrolls which will be their next cash cows. 76 is obviously still making them money or they wouldn't be putting out new content. But it's also not making them enough money to actually put enough devs on the project to fix it properly. If it was anything more than a side project you'd see Austin hiring a whole lot more devs to get the bugs under control so it could be the next ESO for them. My personal theory is that they originally wanted to put multiplayer in Fallout 4, but realized it would be too much work, so decided to break it off into a side project, where they discovered it was even more work than they had initially thought and now they have to decide if it's successful enough to keep pouring money into.
---
Just play a different game lmao
---
I mean I’d like to see actual content
---
I want new content, in particular I want zetas
---
YOU don’t want new content. I have yet to encounter a game breaking bug for myself, but doing the same thing over and over again has become a boring grind. Scrip and treasury note limits are too low, the amount of times events pop up is way too low, and each event I’ve probably a done over what feels like a billion times. They’ve also dumbed down the game, from Beta it was definitely a lot more of a challenge.  Now it’s a bubble wrapped snowflake game. That’s just my opinion though.
---
One of the goals will no doubt be close, but we will hit it just in the nick of time.
---
Is it hard to type while licking Todd Howard’s toes?
---
You can’t. I’m saying they frick up the wall system so badly that no one even cares about that and just builds the pre-fabs
---
Hate to burst you bubble, but there was just 2 vault dwellers who got a little different behind closed doors.
---
Zoom in all the way. Only way to get stable fps.
---
I found him attacking my acid extractors with a bunch of turrets unloading on him. I only figured it out because they were pretty close to bringing him down so I just stored them and he stopped then the actual enemies came out
---
I mean for me it's always run like that.
---
I mean, there are legitimate performance concerns. Camp budget being the most obvious. 
---
But who says caps are for performance reasons? Really the caps cap is part of attempting to reduce the rate of inflation. Likewise fast-travel costs (and thus people asking for free fast travel to crater/foundation is never gonna happen- public groups have already given us a ton of free fast travel, especially if your group has FO1st members!)
---
I stack everyone I have a and low level characters
---
He once leveled 1/3 of my camp to get to and destroy my weapons workbench. I just sat back and watched in shock.
---
also please fix the hooded rags outfit.
---
&gt; which is a huge design flaw in Bethesda as it’s never actually shown to the player that it’s a boss you should fight.
---
I never realized that.
---
I've fought one, randomly, that I got a kill on because no one knew it was there and nuked the area *again*, but there's no notification.
---
No big cry in the distance people finishing SBQ can hear. 
---
Why not?
---
You embarrass yourselves by continuing to support Bethesda.
---
Self owned. No pity. Stop buying shitty Bethesda games.
---
Well that didn't take long lmao!
---
Everyone got final warnings for duping. It would have been better to flat out ban the minority using the exploit instead of fucking the majority. They’re scared to ban people and now we all pay. This is coming from someone who got the final warning.
---
This is why I use pacifist, can't hurt anyone or be hurt by anyone while spraying during events
---
I thought they announced that they were going to be doing instanced interiors in the roadmap...
---
So between fixing a bug and being done with it... or leaving the bug as it is and then spending the rest of the lifetime of the game letting people exploit it and putting in the extra effort to track them down and punish them... you'd rather go with the later?
---
Wonder if it’s a Hemlock Holes thing. Only place I’ve ever seen him attack player built items in a workshop. You saved yourself some circuits...Grahm would have claimed that workshop.
---
Maybe to monetise the solution ? 100% they will add double walls and skins for them in the atom shop
---
It's weird because Minecraft is one of the biggest games that exist, and it's just building.  Most other building games are super popular.  Games that focus on skins and items as the profit metric work great too.  LOL makes a billion a year on skins and hero sales.  The FO world is a LOT bigger with a lot more content that they can create for.  All the weapons.  All the armor.  All the building pieces.  Style sets, theme sets, holiday sets, etc., etc...  How is this hard to figure out?  After FO4 and the big success building was to many people, and then FO76 went backwards.  It's even more problematic because up until FO76, there was a big modding community filling in all these needs.  Then FO76 cut all of this out, and then they didn't refill this need through the Atom shop.  They even cut OUT content from the Atom shop, a ton of content, and then create artificial scarcity as a sales tactic.  It's all so predatory and totally backwards.  They could be rolling in cash with like no work.  All they ever needed to do was let people fuck around in this FO world actually do the work rebuilding society and fight the wasteland.
---
Stop whining about the whiners
---
In case you didn’t know, he’s a traveling merchant who is also a super mutant, you’ll know it’s him because he always has his brahmin with him
---
That's Amazing
---
Logged in and did my dailies I stopped my timer at 38:11, and the bot had me in at 39:00. Not bad, its probably rounded up.
---
Agreed. 
---
As a camp builder I don't really care about this fix. I don't even build houses anymore.... 
---
Just locations. My towns, compounds, and such? Don't really need this, somehow, invaluable exploit.
---
Basically, from what I've gathered, people are mad they can't put wallpapers on both sides anymore by glitching walls together
---
Not much honestly. There's a battle pass which we're too far into for you to get caught up on that gives you some stuff for completing daily tasks instead of giving you atoms. Other than there's a teaser community event which is pretty lame that teases the upcoming BoS update.
---
Idk what this means but consider my bubble burst
---
The best power armour for PvP is no power armour
---
I threw some steel up on my vendor for 1 cap and after about 6 hours of over yesterday and today no one had bought any. Ammo and plans were selling fine so it wasn't like no one was visiting.

There go circular buildings.

---
They also already replied to the outcry, stated why it happened, and informed us that they plan on finding a method to re-enable double sided wallpaper if not other functions.
---
it is adorable that you think that will make a difference when this sub has been busy upvoting people screaming that this is a conspiracy to sell double sided walls in the atom shop some day.
---
While that certificate thing is true, I don'T think it's for everything. Gearbox seems to be rolling out hotfixes fairly regularly for Borderlands 3, either the process of approval isn't that bad or it's not required for things like hotfixes. There must be an explanation to why some studios do it and some don't.
---
&gt; Because small fixes fills the update list so it looks... Filler.
---
The tough part there could be many *valid* reasons.  As simple as:
---
1.  New engineer starting;  they are getting their knowledge transfer/learning by doing easy bugs.
---
2.  Free time at the end of the day / end of a Sprint.  Before a vacation.  Whatever it is.  
---
Though, I do worry it's likely a bad reason too.  Like - management sets a target, you need to delivery X bug fixes per patch.  And they cherry pick to make the number.
---
Everyone is complaining about the double wall fixes. I want to see people's camps. The camps that would be ruined without the double wall trick. 
---
The camps that if the exploit didn't exist, would look like trash.
---
I tweaked my points when it broke to shunt 2 more into Charisma, initially for tenderiser but I switched it to suppressors. I used Action Boy/Girl in the meantime and having now shuffled a couple of points back into Agility, the boost to my sprint time and little extra wiggle room for the jetpack has made it too hard for me to go back to Rank 5 Adrenaline, so I've dropped it down to a 2 point card and to be honest, it's doing the job just fine.
---
if you want it, yes. or do you have other ideas we are able to unlock it?
---
I hope you sue, and I hope you lose and are forced to pay Todds legal expenses.
---
Same, I logged in today got my gold at Crater, and saw dozens of plips around Atlas, and was disgusted. 
---
Just logged back out.
---
Is there a progress tracker to see how the community is doing? I probably just missed it, but I would sure appreciate being pointed to one.
---
I've donated 10k steel so far, which I recognize is only 0.008%, but that was a lot of steel for me and it would be nice to see how that is adding up with others' donations.
---
Agreed, they're junk, happy I didn't waste bullion on the plans
---
this sounds great, but using the logic they apply to every other facet... 'congrats team, no new bugs were reported this patch, a new record! we've fixed all the bugs'
---
You calling me a wall yet you actually just said the same thing as if that is an answer to my point...
---
Always found it strange that they made the secret service under armor also str/end when there was the bos fatigues.
---
Welp, guess more gold to earn.
---
Just let us clip and delete whatever we want. No more of this floating bullshit that requires convoluted solutions to fix. Double sided walls won't be enough, you need to overhaul the building system to make it more liberal and less a chore to work around.
---
The Chinese stealth armor lasts forever and doubles as a hazmat suit
---
And you sound like a console fanboy that would rather see this game take two steps forward and one step back every month because you think you're missing out on something.
---
I had the same problem on my xbox one x even before the update. Most of the time it‘s terrible. Sometimes 1 of 10 it‘s smooth.
---
They're either sidelined or incompetent.
---
If they're being sidelined, they need to assert themselves.
---
If they're incompetent, they need to be replaced.
---
They need to play the game more than for promotional streams.  They should have a finger on the pulse of the community and be able to anticipate what kinds of things are going to cause backlash and know what will be well received.
---
If they are having a difficult time parsing community feedback, then they need to establish a sort of player council made from regular users with 1K+ hrs who can help to guide and prioritize actions and recommendations.
---
It’s not so bad with the scrapper perk, I can collect a few thousand steel pretty fast by clearing a few areas and scrapping all the weapons. Sadly I won’t pay for a 1st subscription so it mostly gets bulked and sold once I craft any ammo I need.  I guess me sharing my scrapper perk in groups may finally pay off.
---
Just thinking as Devil's Advocate here, but is there any way in which the double-walling thing could be putting some kind of extra pressure on the servers or how the game runs? It does essentially involve the 'outside' walls constantly hanging in mid-air doesn't it?
---
This has always been how it is for me
---
Nope. Your chances of getting your stuff back is slim to none
---
Guess you didn’t hear about the texas girl who supposedly makes 6 figures a year acting like a puppy.
---
Uh, how do I sign up?
---
Quantums + stealth boy + t65
---
Everything is possible on PC. Still your stupidity triggers me, but I think that's your intension
---
so it's ok to sell us the same stuff we already had in the PREVIOUS game?
---
let me guess, you are one of these guys paying fifa each year and buy the boosters to get the same ultimate team asap once a year?
---
or are you just fine getting items where you know they are 0 effort, you already had them and are insanely expensive? guess some people forgett where the problem of recycling ingame items 1:1 for an overpriced tag is... but hey, go on and let you fool on, as long as there are peole who let them betray so easylie no wonder they continue like that :D
---
Wait, like another thing to buy or spend atoms on? lol, jesus christ. I wonder what the actual investors in this game think. Like, the official investors as opposed to microtransaction investors.
---
Not sure if this is a sarcastic post or not, but I noticed the game was running much smoother in the PTS. Was happy to see that the regular game post-update is running much better too. I'm running at a semi-steady 90-100 fps with almost no stutter in the cranberry bog

Not too hard.  I'd recommend grinding sbq or buying them from someone.  I would Google it/check the wiki.
---
T-65,strangler,and T-51 are the best to use for pvp
---
I only use it for 5mm now because anything else is too much of a chore, they don't show the balances and you still always have leftover ammo. I dont know why it's not just a trade screen like every other thing in the game.
---
Dunno. Can you smell flowers in the wind despite having your head up your ass? Are you capable of normal social interaction without assuming anyone who is not foaming at the mouth is a white knight?
---
It's annoying that all options are shown as available even if you dont have the stuff for it.
---
And the sell/buy are so close. Almost accidentally bought 100x .38 when trying to get rid of some. Luckily I didnt have points enough for it.

Naw, I run a full set of SS but none of the pieces have limb damage reductions. One has 15% damage resist from scorched and the other has 15% from animals, but nothing specific to limb damage... unless those also count for shotgun magic?

Canceled last week.
---
Also related to this thread. Taggerdy had social issues not unlike nuerodivergent person when it cam to talking to civilians. Great Paladin, awful face person. It literally tells us about her issues talking to civilians in comparison to her ease to talk to military folk. So of course their were disagreements during high tension when you literally go, "We need this to help you." instead of, "Hey folks. If you help us keep the supplies moving we will supply the military wielding guns and power armor support."
---
The different factions each have two sets of how interacting with others went. One good, one bad.
---
The battlepass is free
---
Honestly I feel like Bethesda is just telling us to get Rekt with that response. 'There was an exploit! We did not consider how much you liked the freedom an aspect gave you! So we removed it entirely and you should be grateful. Sorry, too much work to reverse it an actually fix the exploit itself and not something it's connected to. Maybe we'll bother giving you what you've been begging for since release. Or at least, considering bothering."
---
Complete agreement here. Shouldn't have to wait weeks for a fix to something, and console players would get a more polished product.
---
Yup.  If only there was a way to block picking up items.
---
Man I have been apart of this sub since the game came out and have given up with the hope all this crap gets fixed, but it still sounds like they have a lot to do, guess I will just keep checking in from time to time.
---
Playing Ghost of Tsushima meanwhile this resolves...
---
I hope this post reaches 1k upvotes and then some, cheers.
---
Because it's probably more complicated than you'd think? Lets say they just add them in based on what's available in the game now... you place a double sided wall down, go to the wallpaper tab, pick your wallpaper and it applies it to the wall... to both sides of the wall.  
---
Because that's how wallpapers work, you're applying a single texture to a single object.  People obviously wouldn't be happy with that and would demand the ability to place different wallpapers on different sides of a single wall and THAT is something that will require a rework of how wallpapers even work before they could implement it.
---
We're looking into these reports and gathering information for the appropriate teams. Thank you! We will let you know if we need any more info.
---
No joke. There's still that lock-up on the favorites wheel after logging in, but I'm no longer getting heavy stuttering every few moments running through the map. My character is stuffed with different weapons though, so maybe they focused on making inventory management more efficient on the servers
---
No, not another thing to buy. rewards for playing the game.

You just do challenges and get rewards and people get eliminated per round

What you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it.

Again today I've dropped my 1st Sub.  I just cannot do it anymore.  Bethesda you need to change management and soon, because your a dumpster fire right now.

I have no idea dude. But, when I removed Class Freak and replaced it (because I noticed it wasn't working on Marsupial) it reset the negative effects properly.
---
Then, I've since logged in and out, and we have different mutations being affected and Marsupial is back to losing 4 INT??
---
Same boat, except that I'm on Xbox instead of PS4, but it's the exact same problem and my friend and I tried the exact same 'fixes' with no luck either... The workaround we do is to have one joining a world, and then the other joins the game through the Xbox native friendslist instead of the game's social menu, but I don't know how the friendslist on PS4 works, but it's worth a try.

---
unfortunately bethesda is better at taking items than giving them back
---
I've been thinking for a while that it's just being screwed by the money men at the top. Bethesda are probably putting everything into Starfield &amp; ESVI at the moment, so FO76 is more of a 'sustainable if we don't spend much on it' type of affair.
---
I mean think, it must be making money else it would've been cancelled by now. But I see the same non-friend people over &amp; over across this supposed huge sprawl of servers, so something tells me the player base isn't big enough for them to invest development.
---
Same here, i think it runs a little better now actually...
---
Don’t use wooden walls
---
That used to happen with mods not being updated properly. If you are using any, update those. If no mods, make sure your documents files are not set to read-only, and try verifying game files after that
---
Wow, it's been a long time since I saw that spreadsheet. It's really been fleshed out!
---
Well, technically you can complete the Legendary Run without spending atoms and many dedicated players are on track to do so. But you can also pay atoms to skip to the end. But yeah, their investors only see the $$$ that companies like Epic and Rockstar are rolling in and they want some of those sweet microtransaction bucks. If you aren't too worried about getting everything, the Legendary Run is pretty easy and gives you some ok items that would otherwise have been in the atom shop, so it's not all bad.
---
Too bad mods work only client side.
---
I've had a really hard time keeping up with the posts about this. I lost count after 25 or so.
---
&gt;Just watched angryturtles video on monday where he was preparing for the event and explaining it, 
---
Yes I saw that. He assumed that it was dropping with the patch.  That was a perfectly reasonable thing to assume, because Bethesda has been hyping both the event and the patch alongside each other.
---
Lagging servers isn't bad enough for you?  How about the fact that super lag tends to be a factor in most duping exploits? Or one of the recent bugs where laggy camps let people loot others stashes?
---
Even if a bug like this on it's own isn't harmful beyond the lag the danger is all of the other shit that can be done using it.
---
You don't leave massive and easily accessible vulnerabilities in your game just because removing them inconveniences some people.
---
Reddit doesn't like me and I can't see your response to me.  Itd be great if you rewrote it and commented it again.
---
Just because you haven't heard of it doesn't mean it doesn't exist...or are you that deep into the exploit community? :P
---
Sorry, but the exploit excuse is hollow. The infinitely stacked wall camps were used to create lag for the purveyor/caps for scrip glitch and to crash a server for armor duplication. Both of those issues were already addressed. There is no current method that I have seen anywhere to lag a server with a camp. This is plainly an excuse for an epic fuck up on their end.
---
Couldn’t really work unless you are on a private server.
---
we all know that the servers, especially the public ones are laggy af, there is no need to point out that a 300mbps network \*could\* be the problem he has. everyone experience them, from 50 to 1000mbps.
---
laggy controls are becouse of the bad performance the game delivers, especially on consoles. i had to disable grass and some other settings to get between 60-140fps depending on which zone and player density. it's wide known that consoles struggles to perform above 30-40fps with fallout, which is the explanation of imputlag (4k res = lower Frames Per Second obviously since there are 4x more pixels to calculate impacting the framerate).
---
my sub machine gun definitely misses more than a minigun, tested both with single clicking in vats
---
They build system is extremely clunky and broken. FO4's system was better and it was a headache that was fixed by molders.
---
No interior walls, limited camp budget, trying to design anything but a box is nearly impossible.
---
Also this wasn't a bug fix for walls. A bug fix addresses an issue while leaving a feature in place. You just removed the feature (ability to change wall types). That is the most half ass way to code. I'm somewhat appalled by your software development. More than once you put out a patch that appeared to revert an earlier fix. Are you guys using version control properly? That typically means you're working on multiple forks of a code base and someone screws the merge. 
---
My impression as a software engineer is that either you're outsourcing some of your development and they're not delivering quality (which from experience with my company, unless you're looking over their shoulder constantly this happens) or your entire organization is lacking any kind of functional development process.
---
In this long a time I would have heard about it. And this entire fucking game is an exploit get over it.
---
Please add this to the list of auto delete suggestions. At this point I am starting more annoyed by the posts then the action
---
Yeah there's been a lot - it would be nice if there could be central threads for each topic - not only so there's not so many but so everyone can see the posts from the community managers or player based solutions etc
---
but are you actually losing those 4 int points? check your special tab, is it the correct value?
---
Not that I known of, just the 3rd star effect that reduces limb damage.
---
Neat, but just a hollow shell since you used most of your budget on walls
---
It’s only been a few months so not much..
---
You should be able to rebuild armor pretty easily, right?
---
Thanks a lot 🤣✌️
---
Fallout 76 as a whole is broken. It's the laughing stock of videogames. It won't be fixed ever. If you still enjoy it for whatever reason, try to make the best of it I'd say.

PA isn’t that hard to replace though. Unless it’s the strangler heart. But you can buy the stuff you need with gold. If it’s other more common people sell them for 5k caps fully modded

Frankly Steven, you're a bore.
---
I'm just gonna say it Bethesda just doesn't deserve our love anymore their lack of care and disconnect from the player base is all too apparent.
---
This is like the 30th post or so I've seen on this subreddit about people leaving the game and I say to them. Good for you.
---
Leaving this game is like leaving a relationship where you started off good (not really) and you had good times but they just over time soured and turned, they started just asking more from you while getting nothing in return. The abuse isn't worth it anymore.
---
The whole game is embarrassing!
---
I'd rather them test the fix for the exploit while leaving a commonly used thing in the game. If they can't do that then enforce bans on those exploiting the server to lag.
---
Their fix is the equivalent of taking a machine gun to a guy robbing a lemonade stand
---
Lmao what I’ve never even heard of this thing before now. Besides there’s a building budget. Anything within that should be fine. Their argument of server stability is the dumbest shit on the planet and it doesn’t explain this whatsoever
---
Deuces.
---
Or to hide purifiers or run electric in blind spaces. Just logged in and cant get into my camp without scrapping a wall i cant rebuild. Time to finally move on.
---
Of course not - after all, it is a solution of sorts to a problem that should not exist to begin with.
---
Yeah, Grahm. ;)
---
Wish I could tell you what I was at baseline, UNY Bloodied here. Certainly possible it's just a visual bug.

Here's hoping, no-one else so far seems to be having an issue. That's a good sign.

I started to do it, but then realized I'm paid up through November.
---
Don't blame devs? The ones that let exploits and dupes run rampant? The ones that break perks and other game features every patch? 
---
Yeah, I'm blaming them for their sloppy work.
---
To fix the fix, build a wall, destroy it with a flamer and build another wall. Friend of mine that builds alot says its a usable work around
---
Or just keeping people out.

i'M GoiNG To tELl LiBErtY prIMe oN yOu.
---
Go ahead.  Tell that hunk of junk I know where it's base is and it's gonna get nuked back to the stone age.  Again.
---
For fuck sake it's not about who gets it first.  The entire point is that IF console players get it first it's easier to fix the bugs and polish the game because you're not restricted to patching things once a month.  
---
Lots of games do this.  Look at a game like Warframe for example where they often release PC builds MONTHS ahead of console releases because when something breaks they can have a hotfix ready sometimes WITHIN THE FIRST HOUR to fix problems.  You can't do that kind of shit on consoles.  Thats why PC goes through finding all of the broken shit, the developer fixes it all and then consoles eventually get everything a bit later but they get the fixed and polished final product.
---
Yup, Grahm*. ;)
---
You can use the pass-through-wall conduit to fill that role
---
Oh, I know who he is. ;)
---
Agreed, i’m out. I’ll keep my $12/month and maybe spend it on a game that gives half a shit about their consumer base.
---
It's also been that way before the patch. Could be a little worse now but still insanely bad before
---
I think there are just many things the devs can't do. So, they fix what they can.
---
I'm not saying this to be judgmental; but, it seems as though they've inherited code that they can't fix-- whether it's a knowledge issue or just bedrock limitations with the game itself... who knows.
---
You misspelled 'was'
---
I have nowhere near 300 connection, and I have none of the issues.  My latency is great though (and I've fixed the performance part of the problem locally).
---
He tagged the post PC help, so I don't think consoles come into play here.
---
Settings too high and bad latency (including a lot of wifi connections) could easily explain what OP is experiencing.  Other players can also cause problems with exploits, but even running around with too much inventory will seriously slow down your performance, and I suspect that has an effect on other people nearby as well (though I haven't experimented with that myself).
---
The servers are AWS, it's not like Beth is running the place on old Dell workstations in the basement.  The code is *crap*, and that definitely has an effect on performance, but the servers are very likely not the problem at all.
---
.......
---
This is kind of my point. It's a house. A pretty generic house. The use of double walls doesn't make it any more interesting, or would have been impossible to build without it. 
---
No offence meant here, early camp okay. It is still however just a generic house.
---
"you can't notice what you don't know."
---
all of my friends are PS4 players, i am the only on on PC with a high end setup.
---
they all say their console games are running smooth and without any issues, but i am used to play with at least 90fps and ultrawide. playing on their consoles i always, really always notice framedrops, low framerates and heavy imputlags. there is no difference on PS4 or Xbox, since the problem is the same - if you only play on one closed platform with lowered but stable quality, there is just simply no difference to sense.
---
I think that started happening with Wastelanders.
---
It's hard to tell what it really looks like on here. There are children and adults of all kinds on here from all walks of life. Many of us (probably all - including bethesda staff) are dealing with a very upended world and are emotionally more frail. That being said there are still serious integrity issues because all of this stuff (making/playing video games, chatting about video games) is deeply human activity. There are all sorts of different projections in various theatres of the mind about the situation because these are pretty unnatural circumstances for quorum and interpersonal communication. Some people are raised to communicate their needs through, frankly, annoying means. This doesn't make their yearning less valid, it does require grace to entertain. I'm not always up to it either. Getting bothered over a likely human response is just another useless human response right? not an improvement? I mean it happens to me constantly, it just never seems to improve things. It does indicate where trouble or trauma might be.

I think frog legs is 3 seconds. Could be wrong though. 1 big jump. One medium jump. Down to regular jump.

---
Hrm, like I've gone into places that seemed picked over; and I just watched a lead farming video where a guy was talking about picked-over sites.
---
Never bought it in the first place. Never bought Atoms. My family bought two copies of the Power Armor edition and had to buy an extra copy of the game so my brother and I could play on the same platform (store limited you to only buying one PA edition per platform) -- I already gave Bethesda more than enough of my money for this broken game.
---
The more that cancel, the better.
---
Figured you had run into him once or twice. He can be evasive tho
---
Oh, they're only allowed to fix bugs you're personally aware of now?
---
As someone who has just been casually playing the game for the past few months and has this sub in my feed its been an endless fountain of hilarious cringe today.  Some of you guys sound like this game is the only thing your life revolves around, y'all know there are other games out there right?  Your wall glitch will get patched eventually lol
---
I would make the container flagged as forbidden the instant you hit the button. Or better yet, have the button push transfer the ammo into an invisible and inaccessible container inside the body of the furniture item itself, and have the game calculate ammo points from THAT box, not the box you put the ammo into.
---
Both are great weapons.  Caster for everyday use,  minigun for the boss events.
---
From datamining, it was determined that the devs just didn’t turn the code on to add them.
---
They jamped to get back out!

I’m sure you can still smell flowers neck deep in your stretched out anus, I’m sure that’s why you’re asking someone who doesn’t ride Bethesda’s dick 24/7.  Sorry, can’t answer your question.

But I can confirm that you are a blind BGS apologist, not even worth my time talking to someone in your cult.
---
I had to delete that shitty annoying converter yesterday because it would t let me out of the screen. It just kept going blank and than going back to the annoying selection screen.
---
THAT. I 100% agree
---
Exactly. 
---
These "camp builders" who are complaining, seem to think that the use of a wall exploit somehow makes or breaks their camp design.... 
---
In their gaudy, overdone, 1 of 384747383 boring single house camps
---
I'm wondering if they're outsourcing bug fixes. My company does and they absolutely have quota from their company (not from ours). We get bombarded at the end of the month to approve their solutions and then get ordeals when we refuse to because they're suggesting a quick fix that isn't viable or is just a shitty solution.
---
It was this one indeed.first step was lagging the server by placing max number of walls in the same spot.
---
It's the strangler heart armor head and torso pieces.
---
to fix the main issue with the fix, just give us double sided interior walls that can take two different wall papers on them
---
I'm just anal with spelling. ;)
---
Thank you for proving my point. You ignored that I am unhappy with the exact same change, ignored the commiseration. I'm not raving mad, theirfor, apologist. Wanker.
---
15 k steel, 60 boxes, and only get trash it's no possible only get prime receivers plans, the Christmas presents have more variety than the atlas boxes.
---
if they don't add more stuff this event will failure
---
I got tired of the grind yesterday and just purchased the last three ranks.  I've got like 7500 atoms left.   Now.....   nothing to do.   Looking at Outer Worlds until Meat Week drops.  Oh yeah...except for dropping in daily to convert some of my 240 T notes.
---
There are exploits to increase the budget by using half walls. Players can very well go over the intended budget.
---
WHAT exploits. Every single one of your responses to any of the community’s concern is some fucking hidden cryptic message shrouded in mystery. WHAT CAMP exploits were so game-breakingly important that you had to screw the entire building community? 
---
Every single CAMP in the game that has a shred of creativity is using SOME type of exploit to be able to build something decent with the shitbox of a building system we have. It’s like you want us all to just build nice perfect white picket fence houses surrounded by prefabs. 
---
That’s not how these incredible CAMPS get built. They get built by using every little possible trick to get around this crippling building system, which you have just further restricted.
---
No, but I do play this game a whole heck of a lot and hear about most exploits like this. I don’t know of anyone who did this. Maybe they did, maybe they didn’t, but a lot more people used the double wall trick to make creative camps than to exploit.
---
You kinda contradicted yourself
---
there is no "or".
---
plazma caster and GMG.
---
there is no problem with ammo if u have good version of GMG with one barrel.
---
Genuis!
---
This isn’t church don’t bring religion into this
---
I’ve been using the plasma caster with regular plasma cartridges. Once I got some heavy perks and cards on my build it seems to be pretty good at shooting most things.
---
I’ve only used the one I got from the purveyor, and I’ve never crafted or received a mini gun.
---
that's the *only* thing you have to say for yourselves...?
---
So am I...and for some reason, I spelled his name GRAHAM as well for months. LOL
---
Took you guys long enough
---
Ah, yeah. Pre-fabs are not really an improvement bc they're so hard to place and you can't snap anything to them except the metal stairs if you get lucky. :p
---
No, it does not.
---
This is true. I would probably notice it if I was on pc but I’m used to this now so I guess I just appreciate what it is
---
Those are your “rare” plans they promised
---
*whoosh*
---
Unequip everything and all cards to see base. Then try to put on card then off to see changes on stat screen.
---
Illusion.
---
There is a black version here: https://youtu.be/MFIebRY2NTc
---
god bless the enclave and no one else
---
I usually aim for 10% of the listed value. So most range from 5 caps for a recipe to 35 for a plan.
---
But things like power armor plans I’ll do at 100-200, depending on how desirable it is. Like jet packs and emergency protocols sell well, but an ultra cite left leg doesn’t.
---
If I see it sits for weeks, I’ll knock it to 10 caps. But the same thing happens, sometimes someone comes and cleans the machine out.
---
Yeah. I spent €70 on fo76. I got fo3 + for for €11.
---
They could offer server side support. Other games have it. You'd just need to opt in, but the mods that would be supported would be selected by the company. Unless they go the Minecraft direction.
---
Am I supposed to guess now or were just hoping I wouldn't expect you to elaborate?
---
Thank u very helpful :)
---
Seems like too many of y'all canceled their 1st...
---
Nah. Too busy foaming at the mouth like a pack of Karens who found a pickle on their hamburger and calling anyone who is upset but not raving like a lunatic a toe licking apologist.
---
Faschnat always got me too 🤣🤣
---
They responded but they still won't do anything for another month or more.
---
I actually use grenades and I still drop/delete them. What's the point of these things requiring bullion for the blueprint and creature parts to make if they do less damage and cover a smaller area than my trusty Nuka grenades?
---
So that’s what I did also. I had 4K atoms and I said screw it and bought rest. I have outer worlds and should really start playing all my back log games
---
&gt;Stop shilling
---
This is the most reddit shit ive ever heard. Someone makes a valid point about something and they are immediately a fucking shill. Lmao and people wonder why basically no dev team takes any sort of feedback on reddit seriously...
---
For the record, im not defending the BoS event or anything.
---
You white knighted Bethesda in response to very valid criticism from someone who was obviously heavily invested in the game, making asinine assumptions about the OP’s intentions.  You’re not just a fanboy apologist, you’re an aggressively ignorant fanboy apologist.  
---
And your whataboutism over “I was not pleased by this thing” mean nothing, sheep.  
---
People like you are the reason Bethesda doesn’t listen to critics.
---
Thanks most been seeing people just link to the patch notes.
---
you want me to tell all servers are always running smooth? are you kidding me or do you play a different game? sure the netcode is crap since it's like the whole engine is like frankensteins digital monster. server stability is not equal to latency, it doesnt matter if your ping is fast when the server having trouble calculating everything and send the data back to everyone. rubberbanding and bouncing healthbars are clearly serverside.
---
just at this moment while typing i got  [disconnected](https://i.imgur.com/Mpl3rh9.jpeg) btw. stable servers approved! or, must be my ftth network...
---
My camp is still floating as intended because it's the apocalypse.
---
Chalk it up to naivete or wishful thinking.
---
My wife and I play this because we've always wanted a Bethesda game we coulld play together, and we've been together since Morrowind. This is so frustrating, because even the stuff you normally think of them doing well they're kind of screwing up right now.
---
Gauss minigun for that sweet sweet magic
---
Yesterday vats did not work all day for me I would press the button and it would make a sounds effect but nothing would happen it did not even drain my AP it was broken but it’s better today
---
Nobody’s crying. I’m questioning 75 million in a day. Seems rather high. And begs the question are they even counting or just giving the award anyway?  Cork will tell I guess. 50 million in a day will be astonishing
---
Had an armour plan that I didnt know - not that it really matters now I have SS armour.
---
That's what I had to do with my son...yep
---
The broadcast tape for the treasure hunter sign
---
They work really well IF you hit something practically dead on.
---
Bye bye!
---
Yeah and the scorched were pretty easy to find and all you had to do was shoot em.
---
But a much more unique post
---
can confirm
---
What Dev? Some middle manager opened the second enevelope and it said 'blame double walls'.
---
And this will actually accomplish what now.......?
---
I bet someone who has completed that quest will give you theirs. Xbox or you could have one of mine
---
I wanna know who said "we are working on 76, cancel everything else. Great, now even though we have a shit tone of time let's release it early" then after that, got a random guy from the void and was like "we just went live with a broken ass game that you have never heard of. Go make updates for it but ignore the feedback."
---
PS4 - Hit X then it grays out and I get nothing but standing infron of the door..... I had such a flow going this sucks.
---
I donate 15k and get 60 boxes, for the plans I get just was the prime receivers you get for Christmas boxes nothing new, so don't waste your resources
---
You seem to have a problem with reading comprehension.
---
either you don't actually play the game (or at least have never bothered to pay attention to anyone else's camps) or you're just a troll (and not a great one either).
---
Nobody has said that you can't build anything anymore. Houses can still be built of course. But having a house with exterior walls all on the inside isn't exactly appealing, is it? I know because the first camp I built I didn't know about the double wall glitch and was not happy with how it was looking. I spent all my caps to get the brick plan so that my "accent wall" was at least brick and not crappy wood.
---
As soon as I learned about the double wall glitch, I rebuilt my camp... several times. It allowed for much more freedom in design.
---
I also paid for the cinder block wallpaper with the express desire to build a small bunker with the wallpaper on both sides so it looked like the bunker was built out of cinder blocks. I was lucky enough to build it on a new character I had started recently, and blueprinted the design just before the patch. I'm on my laptop at the moment but I will upload a couple of pics if you can't imagine what the cinder block wallpaper would look like on both sides of a wall.
---
tl;dr just because the change didn't affect you doesn't mean it didn't affect a large portion of the community for whom building is an integral part of their fallout experience.
---
That’s fair I suppose. That will indeed be a ton of cork to donate
---
This has to be the most incel community I've ever seen.
---
Yeah, except Bethesda already replied to explain that the change was to eliminate an exploit...
---
" To give you more context, these fixes addressed issues that, while seemingly harmless on the surface, could and were being used by some individuals to take advantage of unintended exploits. Something we overlooked is how this would impact certain quirks in the C.A.M.P. building system. This is unfortunate, and it was not our intention to limit or remove parts of the C.A.M.P. system, but those issues needed to be fixed. "
---
So is there a place on your website or in game that let's us see how the community is doing on these ATLAS events? Like a meter or something? It would be nice to be able to check and see if we have even a snowball's chance in hell of getting the community rewards before blowing all our precious salvage on crates containing mostly booze, radaway, and obsolete power armor blueprints.
---
The stacked walls crashed the server for power armor duplication,  and the lag camps were used to buy items for caps from the purveyor. Neither of those mechanics have been viable for months.
---
Yeah, I logged on to my bow character and half of my shots wouldn’t fire. I got used to using this method when enemies got too close, now I struggle with mole rats.
---
Feeling like I might as well delete or respec the character.
---
It does when an interior wall bundle finds it's way in the Atomic Shop in 2 months. Screenshot this.
---
Your view on how people speak here is the most spot on view I've read and could apply to any subreddit quite frankly. Typically it's up to those who moderate to give it's user base an essence of the tempo of discussion. This place isnt that sort of environment. Ive had posts deleted for trying to trade with people but have seen post remain calling devs monkeys through screenshots and other verbal attacks. Those posts are viewed as grievances toward a game but what it does is create a tolerance for attacking people which bleeds into direct attacks on other social media.
---
I served in combat and a top lesson is during the heat of a situation to put the emotion of the situation aside and focus on it with a logical approach. This has extended into my life in all areas including gaming politics and what cereal to buy my children. Simply put if there aren't anyone around to stop people from talking the way they do in fear of being attacked or downvoted the loud voices prevail.
---
Still looking for a fix that breaks something else entirely?
---
exploits. ofc. 
---
nice reasoning... it's like "it's prohibited since it's illegal!"
---
A little tide comes in and it all tumbles over...
---
I liked rifle/melee when I ran it for a while.  You cant go as in depth with any specific thing, but having two different weapons can be nice.
---
No most of the lag comes from players hoarding every outfit, note and holotape in the game.
---
Because it shows Bethesdas screwed up management. Fix bugs that affected gameplay for a long time? NAH! Fix random bug that never really bothered anyone? HELL YEAH!
---
They definitely seem to have a problem with whoever is prioritizing their backlog (wonder what priorities have actually been set for the devs).
---
I will cut them slack on fixing some minor items - sometimes you have room in a sprint and you can fit some smaller things in.
---
np anytime :)
---
one good thing is, you guys don't have hackers and hacked gear.
---
But that’s not even advertisement.
---
Could be anything between you and AWS.
---
I don't think it's the network, as I said the code blows.  But that doesn't explain everything.  I said the code is crap, and it causes issues, but there's no reason not to look for solutions closer to home when it's just as likely someone is overcranking the graphics or playing on wifi from across the house.
---
Here you go: [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events)

I didn't even know about it until it got removed.
---
Pssst. They're already in the game files
---
i was on that server
---
i think
---
Maybe there was some sort of pathing issue for NPC’s. I know Graham and the vendor bot will travel up that road.
---
I didn’t know until it got removed as well
---
They prioritize minor bugs rather than the major bugs  and this particular bug was welcoming like example they didn't fix SBQ limbs but fix this very minor bug wow great initiatives bethesda
---
If you say all the negatives yourself, they will have nothing to say

Praise the lord modus for the cleansing of that sin

Some of these videos display builds that are effected by the other camp patch regarding hanging unsupported walls from roofs. This is what helps you make flying structures as seen in the last few links.
---
Ah yes, a nice refreshing "Hey everybody, stop complaining about things I don't care about" post, so original, so daring.
---
Sorry i got what you are trying to say but you clearly haven't met many people on 76 with what you said.
---
Ammo hoarders are not frustrated, they have soooo much ammo. So many of them have millions of ammo for sell. People have actually just get given tons of ammo by these guys as the recent glitch has murdered the need to hoard ammo.
---
Event types haven't said anything other than they want the new event but don't mind waiting if they get something not broken.
---
Most people hate that duping lags and glitches the game. No one cares really about duping but the negative effects to performance it creates in the servers. Plus the dupers know more than 2 builds people play, a duper I once spoke to said Bloodied and Junkies is not the cash maker some think as people with other builds are normal or want to have more freedom with there builds.
---
As for getting the law involved, unless you live in Australia. Chances are you'll waste more many then you spend on and in the game to get no where. Most countries have had people got their lawyers and lost their cases. Australia policy only had a case because the game has changed on launch and people felt conned. It tuck over a year. You on the other hand would be better of returning the game if your countries laws let's you. 
---
Sadly that about it because here has been no false advertising. Live service games have content delays and issues, Fallout isn't close to how bad some live service games have been. Plus if you want to dismiss that. Its common knowledge the game is broken. So you fulling for advertising when you been able to into the game for 2 years doesn't help you there. Everyone trying to sue now will fail and waste money.
---
Anyway not trying to 100% be a ass. Bethesda's last update is terrible, no different to most of them. You should stop playing the game and play something else what you actually like :P
---
That's so messed up but I can't stop laughing every time I read it. This was at your camp?
---
It takes multiple days and quite a bit of scrip grind
---
Well Google " Fallout 76 dupers inventory scrap" and you see
---
Cept they end up taking your gear. I havnt repaired a weapon since the Queen started dropping improved repair kits. I've had so many I've got to drop them in the ground
---
Yes, they Spawn on the rail.
---
I'm kind of bummed out about it. NW is the only reason I play 76 and it gets pretty much no attention. There's still a bunch of really bad bugs from day one.
---
Fire truck in the firehouse at Whitesprings is gone as well
---
No one I know. Of course people got banned.
---
Just break up guns with Scrapper perk on.
---
Yup
---
It's too bad it requires vault steel but t 65 doesn't.  Seems weird.  It seems to me that excavator is the correct choice 95% of the time for most things.
---
I've come back, then left thrice this year. One time with a (now refunded) fallout 1st sub.
---
Its just not worth digging through shit for that one clean kernel of content I know this game has.
---
I keep subbed to this subreddit the way you keep tabs on that one ex that you hope gets off the hard stuff. Yet, as each patch comes to pass more and more track marks pop up in more and more upsetting places
---
Well, does it solve the AI problem?
---
Canceled as well.
---
That's correct, but I don't have to prove it since he can just Google it. I mean dupe glitches we're all arround in the last few months.
---
Capitalism is awesome sometimes
---
Sort of depends on the gun for me. With my shotguns and rifles it seems to work pretty well. But when I equip my gauss shotgun or gauss rifle... holy crap, it's really apparent. As others have said, I can miss 5 95% shots in a row. 
---
Backing out of VATS and going back into it seem to help. But that's so many key strokes, it's just ridiculous. I'd rather use a different gun that works better with VATS.
---

Worth note, they responded already.
---
Also the dumb truck in the parking lot next to the fire station in ws
---
Sorry, been trying to post photos, wtf happened to that?
---
Anyway. It went very weird. Got my baseline after stripping, then unattached and attached perk.
---
Problem was, after I reselected Class freak, it changed the frikkin mutations affected. So stat numbers couldn't be compared.
---
I'll try and get undumb and post photos.
---
And it that time you lose the ability to roll for new legendaries every day, which was a huge draw for me.

To eliminate those exploits/glitches/bugs every single feature should pass QA/QC process and as you can see there are some problems with this part.
---
What happens if you can't complete the mission because it's bugged out for me too
---
the game has AI? where?
---
Yeah the .esm file (master game file) is shared between all platforms.
---
XBOX gets its own texture compression, so those texture files are different.
---
The .exe and other helpers are unique to each platform.
---
But the .esm updates can definitely be more frequent on PC. It's not asking for special treatment - it's using PC as a guinea pig.
---
Exactly! Plus side to all of this, Lucky Hole Mine alone takes me nearly half an hour to clear, Dealing with a clunky UI for 3 minutes is still better than 30 minutes in a mine for me.

I canceled fallout first already! What’s the point of unlimited camp supplies if I can’t build the way I want to?
---
I’ve been playing bethesda games since I found arena on a discount shelf as a teenager and was immediately hooked. They’ve always had bugs and you just put up with it while they laughed alongside you and you were fine with it. You’d contact them and theyd do their best to find a work around if it was gamebreaking but usually it just was what it was. I mean you want to drag a severed head around the wasteland full of power armour that’s your problem 🤣. But over the last few months of 76 they’ve gone dead silent and (for me anyways) it’s started to feel like it’s them versus their player base. I can forgive a flop of a game but not the attitude. I tried submitting a ticket and have gotten far superior customer support from activision. And by that I mean they just auto closed my tickets so there is no customer support. Just their general tone towards their player base has changed and it’s soured me towards my favourite game company. I feel like they’re telling me not to play their games and I think I might listen. Throw them on the heap of companies like BioWare  who’s games I just wont buy anymore.
---
&gt; Tbh I went back to ESO recently and my build is so bad in that game I can barely kill creatures, it takes time, and I'm level 30 + in that game or something like that. The level scaling is just eh to me, it lets me know my build is trash and idk how to fix it. 
---
That's a you problem, not a game problem.
---
In ESO you can basically build any way you want and still kill stuff. My shitty full tank Warden can kill things, it just takes forever.
---
I subbed and willfully pay loads more a month like that dad that unconditionally loves a problem child.  It’s toxic.
---
Same on the Xbox as well.
---
You can’t display power armor. Once you place it it will be collected back into your inventory.  If you drop it it will generally  stay until either someone else takes it
---
Confirmed here
---
Although it's dated, it at least makes something shoot or hit you.
---
That was quite obvious even since the "beta" that should have been a year long, and they should have actually done something real with it as a beta.  It only recently feels like the original release once they brought NPCs into the game.  THAT felt like the original release of the game.  However, we also had more than a year of manipulation top down that has affected what the came became.  It's worse off for it.  It's not a bad game at all.  Many aspects of it are quite good.  It's just that if Bethesda wanted to bank on a model for just money making, there are better ways, vastly better ways.  Instead, we have methods built around whales and predatory sales tactics. It's...dirty.  In the end, they're making maybe 1/10 of what they could be, plus better methods could scale up with time.  You can't really scale whales.  It's a tiny market of premium buyers.  It's a super small pool to bank on for a game.
---
You're right, the player base is not big.  It wasn't geared for the masses.  It was tailored to hardcore FO fans and whales.  It alienated everyone else and lacks elements that make it more fun and sustainable for masses.  I also find FO76 has much less replayability than older FO games.  Unless you like grinding, it's not a game that holds onto attention.  It's tailored wrong for retention.  It's tailored wrong for replayability.  I could start on level 1 of FO4 a thousand times and be happy every time following some new build path, trying out some new mod, and building settlements in new ways.  I restart FO76, and my first thought is "Ugh..." and the first action I'm doing is grabbing piles of resources, not enjoying the game and story.  That's a pretty bad focus to have in a game unless that's all you're about, and for FO76, it kind of is.  It's kind of fun one time through.  It's far less fun every time after.
---
I'm mostly disappointed in Bethesda because the FO franchise is PERFECT for a good profit model.  It's a big franchise with a lot of long time fans.  It's got a wide array of weapons, armor, and since FO4, building components.  All of these can be skinned and sold.  They made an Atom shop that fits this great...IF...they'd use it right.  They created a great world space in FO76, the best they've made so far.  They gave a great premise of rebuilding the wasteland.  They were so set to make this into something like Fallout Minecraft (in a sense).  They had settlement building down since FO4.  They even already had creep spawns and scalability to settlement size.  They had traders and settlement caravans in FO4. They had factions.  They could push that further with reputations, events where you pick sides, and custom job boards/quests that allow you to gain/lose faction favorability.  There's so much there and so much they could do.  With a small amount of work, they could have AI create bases, farm land, and build up settlements (friend or foe).  There's just so much that could be done, and the FO world and pre-existing games already had them so close.  And then they rushed...something, this, the thing we have.  At least now it feels complete at least, but god it could have been a whole different world of a game, and it would have made them so much money, just hand over fist, just by selling skins, style sets, holiday sets, new weapons, armor, and furniture from time to time, whatever.  By now there could be 100,000 unique items on the atom store for people to buy to customize their weapons, character, house, whatever.  If there were a jobs system, you could even have store model sets, custom signage, decorations, etc.  I'd even pay money for a SDK package to build in game events/quests/jobs for other players, and these quests could be built on resources (giving you more reason to go out and farm materials).  There could be so much stuff in this universe, and it's not a far jump at all to there.  And it's ALL this content that gets more people to play, more people buying, and every new player is looking at those 100,000 atom shop items and going "oooh, I want that!"  But, it's a matter of getting the bodies into the game, and the game needs to be tailored for that.
---
OH MY GOD IT'S BEAUTIFUL
---
I only have a basic knowledge of programming.  Can someone more experienced in such things explain why it's not that simple?
---
It won't fail. If it does, they fudge the numbers to make it look like we surpassed goals.
---
It reflects poorly on the game to let these things fail.
---
Had the Secret Service, Responders, Corvega and regular ones. No issues back then..
---
Building is pretty much my entire focus in 76..... 
---
I'm not a troll. I'm an avid builder who thinks that this double wall thing is being dramatically overblown. 
---
I don't care for, nor find interesting/creative someone's house they built that they've interior decorated to look like a.... House. Their interior double wall makes little difference.
---
I like builders who build into the setting, or make locations that fit right into the environment. People's interior walls are of little interest.
---
😂😂😂 Love it
---
Blaming management and "just following orders" is a cop out. 2 years of broke events and patches that fix 1 thing an inadvertently break another tells me the devs have no grasp of the game engine, no testing, no quality control at all. Devs need to be held accountable as well or replaced. Good intentions isnt an excuse. 
---
Management is absolutely to blame for their failures but they aren't exclusively at fault. Its a team working on a project that you all fail on or succeed on and if people are throwing others under the bus that speaks volumes to the person or the environment they work in.
---
I'm pretty sure its visual.
---
Hey if it makes you feel any better I think a lot of us have done this. I had an MMO I used to play where I bought a lot of pets from the shop and gambled kind of frequently with their lootboxes. 
---
I then realized just how much money id put into the game and I was horrified, and haven’t bought anything since. 
---
The good thing is that you were able to take a step away from it and realize how much you were spending. I think a lot of us are about to call it quits with 76, and it’s kind of sad but the game just isn’t improving. 
---
Anyway your camp looks really cool though, I’d like to think that means it was time well spent when you played, in spite of all the state of the game (:
---
My post was accurate. Take a seat, chief.
---
For me it runs smoothly when I first launch the game - and not yet joining a world. 5 FPS once a world is joined.
---
&gt;we’re discussing what it would take to implement double sided walls.
---
Being exclusively available in a 1200 atom bundle?
---
Giving what a buggy mess this game is, Bethesda is in a grey area regarding exploits.
---
Yes, there's a clear moral difference between what's an exploit or cheat, and whats not.
---
But the game is buggy and untested that things that should work, don't, and shouldn't work, do. They probably had to unban all the dupers because I don't think legally they have a leg to stand on.
---
They want us to play the game the way they intended, but not the way they made it.
---
Except they don't "let" it happen. They have a boss, who tells them what to work on at any given time based on a set of priorities given to them by THEIR boss, who makes basic decisions in their sphere of influence, but must also follow the dictates of THEIR boss. The devs, the actual programmers and artists and so on, have nothing to do with what is an is not fixed. Nor do they generally control when patches come out, how hard those patches are tested, or any number of other causes of our woes. They generally don't even have contact with PR, which is a separate department entirely. That's why the Bethesda replies are "we'll tell the team." That's literally all they can do within the scope of their jobs.
---
You are comically missing the entire point of this post, as is most of this sub.
---
It is a grind and that’s why after buying all secret service armor and having to only roll the arms and chest twice to get 3 star unyielding and having to roll each leg almost 50 times each just to get it. And after buying all the guns that where new, I was going to buy the strangler heart and I even bought a bunch of vault steel. But I eventually went with t65 because I didn’t feel like having to spend time getting legendary modules again and having to deal with that crap again. I got all my t65 unlocked plus the mods I want. But I know how shitty it must be to lose your stuff after spending time to grind for it. I now say fuck modules and just spend my script on legendary rolls from purveyor and her sweet ass gave me my first bloodied fixer. So I think if you do stick around say fuck strangler heart and get t65
---
Tried switching servers?  Maybe that'll help.
---
the invincible naked enemys are saying something different.
---
or, do you mean the dive-spam from the SBQ should be something worth called "intelligence"?
---
/s ;)
---
Is your budget full?
---
Yeah, the problem is they don't QA anything.
---
It would seem to me the solution is creating a new wall item that has the interior wall on both sides, yes? But that does mean you’d have to do it for every wall type - windowed, second windows, door frames, second door frames, solid walls, wood, brick, metal...et al. 
---
Good luck tho. Appreciate your work!
---
Sure. I’m not going to give you a camp tour, but I’d like to show you a couple specific examples of why being able to use the previous glitches were important to my camp.
---
I build rooms as small as possible in order to stretch my budget. The ability to fill in blank space gives the impression of detail and liveliness. It’s not entirely unlike balancing a painting and I actually try to make use of color and lighting when I approach my camp building. I want any potential frame of view to look inviting.
---
[This is my living room](https://i.imgur.com/IOqH5uk.png): without the double-wall trick, there would be two regular walls on the left side immediately drawing in your eye and destroying the cozy look I was going for.
---
[This is my kitchen](https://i.imgur.com/jf3dBWH.png): without the double-wall trick, the balance of red and white would be shattered and attention would no longer flow naturally over the items placed in the room. It would also no longer make the kitchen pop and look appealing [from the exterior window](https://i.imgur.com/jvrSWDC.png).
---
There’s more vital things one might not realize they’re looking at, however. There is [a shelf](https://i.imgur.com/2AWU9OV.png) placed halfway between the wall behind the chemistry bench creating the illusion of a curious glass case. I use the other side for adding a touch of detail in a backdrop, the white backing with a lit poster frames a Slocum’s vendor unit. This sort of little detailing is no longer possible, limiting creative efforts and more importantly, solutions.
---
A lot more significant than the aesthetic limitations brought on by this, my kitchen felt really empty and unbalanced without [the large table](https://i.imgur.com/SXhFwqW.png) on one side. I was really attached to it too, as no other counter looked quite right. Except said table was so large, it didn’t allow for use of the stove. The game would awkwardly pause trying to figure things out in the space given, then just give up and let my character go. The only way I could fix that was using the doorframe-to-wall trick in order to [clip just enough of the pipes through](https://i.imgur.com/w1bNtvB.png).
---
Without the ability to have all these little details in place, my camp just wouldn't be quite the same. It'd be less balanced and less functional. Which is why I won't be moving it any time soon!
---
What are your backlog games?
---
I agree with most of this. However, exploits typically abuse a game mechanic in a certain way that is hard to just discover. One person finds out how to do it and then shares it. But the camp thing could literally be found if you just tinkered with the walls for a little bit. I actually found it this way before I saw anyone talking about it. Also, duping is on a whole other level with the real money trading aspect involved. Those trades (and duping in general) are against the TOS, and as far as I know having double-sided walls is not.
---
It's like yelling at a customer service rep on the phone.  At a person who is most likely trying hard to do the right thing under difficult circumstances, leadership decisions and policies they have no real control over.  It is tacky and disrespectful.
---
Sure, leave a bag of dog poop on Todd's doorstep, but respect the developers trying to make the game work.
---
Uncivil titwanks.
---
Epic, rockstar and bethesda make "good" battle passes, by good i mean battle passes that give you enough credits so you can buy the next one. Some games don't do this, and you have to spend ~10€ for each pass
---
It’s Bethesda.
---
You don't seem to understand what words mean.
---
Get an intern on it.
---
Great idea I would've donated for past rewards I don't have
---
Not only have I cancelled my Fallout 1st sub, I've also cancelled my ESO sub.
---
People on here have been right all along and game companies no longer give a damn about the consumer. Bethesda and other companies can go to hell at this point.
---
What’s the remaining method to do double sided walls, if I may ask?
---
Lol, that isn't redundant at all. 
---
And meh, credit card will give me my money back once I file the fraudulent charge. Just trying to give beth a chance to make it right. lmao
---
If you go to vault 76 and drop just outside there, there aren’t any npcs to yoink your stuff
---
Did it shrink your entire download after you downloaded the 50 gigs? Or did it just add to the overall file size?
---
Chortle....
---
Just wanted to say thank you. This sub has, as it often does, devolved into rabid fury, and whenever it does, there tends to be a lot of very ignorant people saying very uninformed things and then backing them us with very Karen-esq arguments. It's refreshing to see someone who, while just as frustrated as I am, is none the less also in enough control to not have an indiscriminate tantrum over it. So, cheers. hopeless as it was, I sent you an upvote :)
---
I know what will be the Official Bethesda Response: System Stability...next they will remove the station.
---
Same here, just recently I dropped \~175 repair kits. I wouldn't mind keeping all of them, if there wasn't any weight associated to them. I'm surprised it has weight since it's an ATOM shop item. I'd have expected them to be weightless, maybe they would have sold more that way.
---
I've had bad times doing that. I stick with containers now. 
---
Next time I'll go to the lighthouse.
---
Still got mine :)
---
It’d be great if it had a larger variety that’s the equivalent of a large purifier.
---
Still, this saves me from clicking simulator.  I use melons mostly.  If you want relish, you need 2 collectors per relish.  Seems unimersive.  Keep the rate per unit, but bring it up to 5 or 10 to go with the tank size.
---
Yes it is broken, can confirm.
---
Everyone upvote this one please.
---
Bethesda needs to hotfix something for once!
---
You can do double walls using halfwalls (I've heard whole brick walls work too but haven't tested it myself) but you have to destroy the one side with a flamethrower to place the other side
---
It depends on many factors, including budget and your junk items. If the turrets cost more than you can afford in junk or budget you cannot build them
---
Doubt it I'm a small camp

Oh I’m big dumb. Please ignore me
---
Yeah, it was just a play style choice. I wanted to be tanky while everyone used low health bloodied builds I wanted to be tanky with dots and 2h dps. It was shaping up to be fun.
---
Tbh, non pa builds already have enough storage as it is.  They shouldn't have misled us, but it's not a huge deal.
---
Ya if you wait 10 min or so after SBQ the Colossus often spawns in sundew Grove.
---
Omg so many. Still have never beat Witcher 3 being I didn’t buy it when it first came out I bought it after I replayed fallout 4 and finally found out why ppl loved the game. See I bought fallout 4 on Xbox when it came out. It came with fallout 3. I played both, enjoyed them but never really played them like they should be. But once I did I knew I needed more games like that. So I was told about Witcher 3. So I got that game on back log, I got metro exodus, ghost of tshumia, last of us 2, red dead 2, spider man, outer worlds, I mean god I can’t even think of all of them. Like it’s a serious problem. Being I love story games, but then I start them and something new happens on fallout or some other online game and I get sidetracked and don’t go back. I prob got a good year of backlogs to play
---
I figured someone would post Aqua's stuff eventually. 
---
Impressive, creative, very cool, polished camp builder 
---
Still a house builder though. Arguably the most impressive house builder I've seen. 
---
Aqua being upset by the change? Sure. That's the exception. Most people complaining about it, are sad their pretty inside walls are gone. Not because they've built something creative.
---
thank god these devs dont work with launching real nukes. btw the buggest game of the world i ve ever played.. its bugs have some bugs.
---
I got 2 back to back about a month ago and I haven’t gotten any since. I’m not sure if the later ones are time locked or you need to turn in x number of data. But I’ve heard a few people say they got early ones then nothing for a long time.
---
I’m curious, what happened exactly? Did your stuff disappear?
---
Can confirm that it’s just as bad on PS4.
---
It blocks out the stairwell and blocks out my room. That closes up giant open spaces that can be decorated to make the space feel more lived in and more aesthetically pleasing. It also helps keep your eyes at certain points of the build. I’m trying to make a visually pleasing build and not some 3rd world mud hut where the living room, bedroom and kitchen is all the same room.
---
That's really too bad.
---
No I'm max at 470 lbs. Without the torso deep pocket. But I still want it lol.
---
Glad I quit a long time ago. The game will never be fixed and the devs will continue to defraud the playerbase.
---
My immediate thought after reading this was, don't wait for a official fix, use mods, then I saw your on PS4...
---
With the fix, we are now limited to the generic exterior walls (brick, steel, sheet metal, contemporary, barn). So maybe 6-7 options. 
---
Without the fix, we had the option to use any wallpaper for the outside. Some of those look very nice and realistic as outside walls (cinder block and that light colored wood for example, gives your place that rustic pine cabin look). Hell even that red brick moth man wall looks cool on the outside sometimes. 
---
To me it’s not so much the fix as the lack of a compensatory mechanism (like allowing us to retexture both sides) that kept all those options open.
---
No one plays the vault raid because it doesn't exist anymore.
---
You get the plans with gold now.
---
0 if its bugged like mine
---
More or less. I think you take some damage, but not a lot.
---
Yeah what in the fuck is that garbage reward we were given in exchange for an absurd amount of steel?
---
Not having internet at the moment withstanding, my issues with the game just get longer with each passing month.
---
Or they could make the interface from FO4 shops - sells for ammo points at the left side (which currently is all display) then use those ammo points to buy in terminal
---
Thank you. I could only imagine what it would have looked like with vending machines and wall papers when those came out.
---
Interesting! I do enjoy using hellfire to create. The Power of...Decision...is lovely. (I hope you read that in Modus’ voice.)
---
Thanks for the link, that's definitely helped me out
---
Yep. Nothing I'd stresss about thankfully.
---
For frog legs I usually count to 5 for a full big jump
---
Yeah the rewards are so pathetic. This game continues to disappoint.
---
Tenderizer works for firearms and melee weapons.
---
I traded all my steel so I could get a dozen boxes with wine and grenades.... worst decision I've made in game....
---
What do you say to a faction based in a smoldering crater?
---
Nothing, you already told them once.
---
My immediate reaction was "oh. Another house"
---
But I definitely agree, in your case at least, the use of a few little tricks improved your look. Especially noting the table and saving space with the pipes.
---
Basically.... it's the only reason you see a lot of high end builds use it myself included
---
Desk fans shm just server hop freddy's fear house theres almost always a wendigo that drops five screws at a time I've got 200 in 1hr before
---
I thought about that, but figured players would enjoy a nice SBQ. I am considering nuking Wavy Willards just to see what happens.
---
"What a fool!  Doesn't he realize, that all he's managed to do is ensure his own demise?!" - Perfect Cell, "Dragon Ball Z".
---
I recommend going to west tek, nuke silos, and the big bend tunnel, glasses cavern, and uranium fever with scrapper on for a load of steel. Also try the market subreddit and trade some gear for steel.
---
It sounds like they’ve expanded the loot table for this event as they have others. I suspect that’s going to lower the already slender BOS Paint chances on Technical Data rewards.
---
I’ve probably averaged 5 technical data drops a week, I forget sometimes, and I currently have just 4 of the paints. I got two in the same month one time, but in 20 months 4 is a very small number, even allowing for my casual approach.
---
ok, i laughed
---
Fair enough, I probably reacted more harshly than was necessary, so apologies.
---
However, just because you don't find those types of camps interesting, doesn't mean others don't. I'm not obsessed with building, but it's certainly a feature of the game I really enjoy (and I really enjoyed it in Fallout 4 as well). But I'd say the majority of tutorials I've watched on camp building would fall into the category you "don't find interesting" which is fine.... I just think you need to realized that as a builder I don't think you're in the majority here.
---
I appreciate all build types, and building a camp that looks like it could be a natural part of the game environment is super cool. But it's not the only way to build a camp (nor should it be).
---
I'm not going to stop playing because of the bugs in this last update (mind you I only started playing with the release of Wastelanders so I'm still 'wet behind the ears' I guess, even though i've logged over 500 hours thanks to covid lockdowns) but I can understand the frustration of those who have been around since beta.
---
I agree I think the reaction is over-the-top in some instances, but I think this is a case of being the straw that broke the camel's back.
---
New slideshow gameplay! Seeing this is a game wide issue now from the comments... How does stuff like this get past the dev team and the PTS server????
---

official Bethesda response. 
---
&gt; For example, we’re discussing what it would take to implement double sided walls.
---
&gt;We hear your frustration on this, we’re talking through what we can do to make it better, and as soon as we have more concrete plans in place, you all will be the first to hear about them.
---
This post is stickied
---
Speaking of wallpapers I've noticed some of my posters and the legendary board clip through the wallpaper you van unlock from the challenge. Had to remove all of them to place my stuff.
---
I might have to do that, I didn't know that it didn't need vault steel.
---
At this point I can't say I am really ignoring it.   More like the motivation isn't there. The rewards suck and do I need another hat or another outfit?   Well no. I don't.
---
They actually posted about this in their forms. They are looking ways to add back some of the camp stuff back but it seems they had to patch the walls to patch other exploit used to harm the performance of the game.
---
I gave up on Fallout: 76, and the price I paid to get it I consider an investment on FO:5 and pray God a new rendering Engine. If there ever is one. I figured with the project dubbed “the first 100 days” that Bethesda had a definitive plan in place to optimize, adjust, and apply. I re-downloaded the game 2 months ago to try Wastelanders, and promptly uninstalled shortly there after. Nothing about this game is anything I ever wanted. I love the region they chose due to the lore, and it could have tied in beautifully with a Vault-Tec experiment gone wrong and been somewhat canon. Nope. Irrelevant story. Clunky game play. Inability to get exploits under control (thanks to the idea of giving the tools to render and edit - awesome idea in a single player game. TERRIBLE when in a live server). And of course, the bugs.
---
Cheers to the next one everyone. and anyone who would like to point out that if I don’t like it the why comment? And that’s because I waited sooooo long for this game and had such high hopes. Those dreams were dashed and crushed by this incomplete experience. Not a hater, just disappointed.
---
Wonderful! I had visions of psycho chickens from the strobe. 🤣
---
Back before one tamerial came out, my build wasn't bad at all. That was basically the last time I played. I came back recently to try it out, and my Dragonknight build was just doing little to no damage to anything. I made it thru summer set and all the way to the Sea Sload or whatever it's called, and that thing took me 2-3 days to actually beat, and it was awful. I'm a solo player, so maybe that's also my problem with it and my build maybe isn't for solo players, idk. But when I look up builds for my character, I get even more over whelmed. I'm just trying to do a Dragonknight staff build and it just wasn't doing it. It wasn't enjoyful to take long periods of time to kill things, but maybe I just need to look up faster paced builds and give it a try.
---
it was affecting gameplay.. says so right in the patch notes...
---
I was putting up wallpaper upstairs in my Slocum's Joe and I noticed that two of my triangle walls were backwards so I removed them to flip them and now they won't snap either way and now I have a giant hole in my roof. What in the actual fuck were they thinking?
---
I've got about 40 pieces of Tech Data, I'm just waiting for the quest to pop up again so I can turn it in. That's what I liked with Fallout 4, is that you unlocked the Knight, Paladin and Sentinel paints from ranking up, the Knight Sgt, Knight Cpt and Elder paints you got from stealing the PA's.
---
It reduces the scream damage to almost nothing.
---
I know I couldn't place a wall to my booze room until they did this fix.   It was like the 2 x 4 on the ceiling was blocking it because when I tried it on another side of the room, it wouldn't work with the ceiling tile that had the small beam down the middle but would with one that didn't have it.   Now I can place it regardless of that small beam.    
---
Not that I'm happy with side effect of not being able to replace a wall with another type of wall (solid versus one with window or door).   I was going to completely block off one area and just remove the wall when I wanted to access it....looks like that's not possible now.
---
Just donated 250 steel ... got three beers and a couple grenades.  
---
...  
---
hahahahahahahahahahaha ... dumb
---
Don't want to pay for the high cap price to buy it off the Whitesprings Bunker vendor huh? Also you should know that Buying/Selling/Trading on this sub isn't allowed.
---
that should always be an option in a perfect world; everything should be available in gameplay...but unfortunately, Beth gotta make bank for their shareholder overlords..
---
You haven’t played this game long enough if you are just beginning to express your outrage.  
---
Another brick in the wall!!
---
I just need to find some Tech Data so the quest can appear for me to turn it in.
---
First time?
---
Even rank 2 will make you pretty darn close.  It's a great perk to have in the bog.
---
Did you think you just invalidated my whole post or something?
---
This backs me up even more because now we know EXACTLY why they did it, and counter to all of the massively upvoted and awarded threads on the subject it is neither because they saw it's existence as a standalone "bug" as something worthy of fixing nor was it a plot to sell us atom shop double walls that don't exist.  It was enabling lag based exploits and would continue to do so if they hadn't removed it.
---
Honestly, just pick stam or magicka and slot in spammable abilities, especially AOE and you're good to go. 
---
I've never looked up a guide yet but my DPS builds melt enemies outside of actual endgame content.
---
Bethesda sure as hell fix anything atomic shop related but the mountain scout head piece that’s still missing. I have been noticing in the scorched queen event at times junkies trait, bloodied trait and the unyielding armor not registered.
---
That or dense mod on chest piece (I prefer dense)
---
I am on Xbox sorry forgot to mention that part
---
Could probably create a simple AutoHotkey script to bulk convert .  Basically it emulates you pressing keys.    You have to add pauses so it doesn’t get out of sync.  I don’t see easing the tedious-by-design work in PvE as unfair to other.  Especially something so intermediary as this.
---
It will likely earn you a ban hammer, but at this point who really cares?  It’s just emulating human behavior with input device.
---
Bethesda:  “Have you tried purchasing more Atoms?”
---
I didn’t know that, thanks.
---
Bugs from _Morrowind_ still exist in Fallout 76. There are bugs in the engine that are old enough to drive.
---
same, after update whatever backpack I equip it floats 😠
---
I checked the other night and realized these event reward and mob dropped floater grenades had built to like 12 lbs of carry weight. Please stop Bethesda, same thing for missiles and mini nukes. It’s hard enough to control stash and carry weight without these heavy items.
---
#NukeATLAS
---
I'm doing my part!
---
I think the issue is more that they never said it was a glitch.
---
 with the number of bugs in the game and number of issues with CAMP in general, for all anyone knew we were supposed to be able to double up walls but it was a bug we couldn’t, just such a minor one with a work around they didn’t bother to fix it. I mean we still can’t apply wallpaper to the wood wall with windows.
---
They’ve seen and commented all this time on how wonderful camps people made were and never said “oh, you can place walls back to back, that’s not intended sorry, we’ll look into it”
---
Nope just need the plans and there is a bug where you can put a jet pack on it without buying the plan for it which is 2000. I bought all other armor for it and found out that I could jet pack even tho I didn’t buy it. Best thing about it. Unlsss they patched it
---
Guess I won’t drop anymore
---
It's a visual bug the perk card is still in affect even if you don't bother to fix it the way you suggested.
---
I also love how they are having some of the devs play A Colossal a Problem. You know that event that isn’t ready for the game but is perfectly fine to showcase to a bunch of players
---
Ah, good to know.
---
Your point being? The patch notes also say that the ss armor now has deep pocketed mods. Guess what the ss armor doesn't have?
---
Lol.  I’m 352 now.  Been playing since the beginning.  Loyal FO customer since it all came out.  
---
But I’ve come to the conclusion it’s always been one step forward two steps back with 76.
---
Ah. So the 40 you have are useless. The quest only triggers when you pick up a brand new one. Any you pick up in between that are useless vendor fodder for one cap.
---
For me, I had 405 carry weight, did what I suggested, and it got up to 420 carry weight. Some cases might be visual but the card didn’t register as active even while it was equipped
---
Ok weird, but thanks, I guess I'll look around elsewhere then.
---
Yes, I thought this was a laggy server yesterday. I'm on Xbox too.
---
This..., I will definitely miss the originally of people's camps. 
---
To the builder, amazing scary build in a scary landscape. Impressive, lol
---
Apparently it's still doable, just in a different way than most of us used to use. What I was told yesterday: Place a brick wall (has to be brick) facing one direction. Use a flamethrower trap to destroy it. Place the second wall up against it (so the two brick sides would be touching, wallpapers facing out) and then repair the first wall. Repeat and enjoy. It's more time and resource intensive than the back-to-back doorways method, but honestly I'll take what I can get.
---
I haven't had the chance to test this yet, but apparently this trick has been around for a while; I'd never heard of it til last night. It seems it also works on half walls, which have always been the bane of my existence in my high-ceilinged rooms...
---
"we are looking into this, thank you"
---
Boom, saved you the time waiting for their response.
---
I just absolutely love the beauty of the fucking passive aggressive sarcasm in the title.  It made my day
---
You don't need double sided walls. Just allow wallpaper to be applied to both sides.
---
Going for a high str high agi high luck character allows for a decent heavy, solid vats pistols, and pretty good melee characters. If you want to be able to pick up any weapon and be effective go 12str 15per and 12agi to allow for any weapon to be functional
---
whatever the listed price is, I drop the last digit, so I sell them for 10% of cost (when I player vendor)
---
Some days I go from 400 plans to like 200, but that is the less-common ones if I save up for some many weeks
---
Exploitation... Patching a exploit that was letting people to create lag meant patching the walls. Some tricks you can do with walls in turn no longer work.
---
So people are angry because they can no long style their camp how they want, no longer create lag and hating Fallout 76 for every reason is popular.
---
They'll shut up and play again later, they always do this every update xD
---
You just have to be on a team for it to work. Distance is not important...
---
Broken Steel? We're getting Fallout 3 DLC!!?!!
---
I do the same
---
Oh my god yet another week/month away from a game I want to love so FUCKING MUCH!!! I have literally stopped logging in to complete challenges since just after the "season" started for the first time since beta and it is not because I don't want the rewards I would love to have the rewards. 
---
Its simply because of the lack of communication and the apparent lack of care that goes into this games development. We get events delayed or they arrive broken, we get patches that destroy hours of gameplay or arguably worse make the game more unbearable. I am currently paying for my first year of Fo1st(Yes I bought the year in a rally of support that didn't pan out. My mistake.) I will continue to leave this game alone until you actually show you care and btw taking hundreds of hours of material collection to earn something I should have got for free is no acceptable reward and neither is a jumpsuit you changed a little patch on.
---
\*Proceeds to rip out his own hair.
---
Because it's waaaaay more complicated than that. It isn't just a single line of code determining how the shot hits, it's running multiple variables real-time as well as running the percentage to see if the shot even hits, a 95% still means it could miss after all. And by tracing the code and changing a few variables across multiple lines, it can easily cascade and now all of a sudden you've fucked up the RNG on spawning legendary guns in the Mire. Or it's something unrelated from a previous fix causing a cascade effect of bugs, and so you've got to back track and find out the cause of it. On top of all of that, you've also got just general bugs caused by the engine, and the various things you've done to get around engine limitations that could be causing problems. And on top of *that*, you have so many other bugs to track down and fix, and catching other new bugs cause by changes and additions, but you only have so many people on the team to dedicate to all of this.
---
Yeah I might sell them. I've heard The Whitespring Bunker or VTU usually has Tech Data in them
---
What's your build and race? I chose dark elf and Dragonknight and it's just, horrible. Least for my play style I was hoping for. I reset my build with some help from other people in the eso sub, cause I had points in all 3 and was trying to just keep it even and then realized that it wasn't the way to go. I might have to go back. I loved the story just the combat was bad for my build.
---
I was in a team so idk what the issues is/was
---
250
---
There this other sub that cannot be name here for the msg will get auto deleted.
---
But u can buy serum off players for around 200-500 caps. Don’t pay more then that
---
M.AR.K.ET.7.6 **cough
---
If ure on PS4 I can hook u up later tonight
---
The damn legs...  Always the legs.
---
I'm done with this game, haven't touched since fashnaught ended cause there's no point. They kill the fun everytime. Will wait for one Wasteland to get the raider quest line achievement and I'm out. Glad I only bought the game and never any atoms.
---
250 Steel.
---
&gt; Something we overlooked is how this would impact certain quirks in the C.A.M.P. building system
---
I call BS on this. with all the wonderful CAMP videos and pictures you’ve seen, with all the you tubers that make videos, you knew the effect it was going to have. 
---
The issue isn’t that you had to change it, it’s that you didn’t warn people ahead of time, and changed it without having a replacement option ready.
---
They’re good in PvP, just not in pve
---
You're not even hiding the fact that you're trolling at this point.
---
Both the server and the console decide how much damage was calculated. Whatever the server said is final. So you can turn on damage numbers and see yourself do 500 damage on a creature but the server decided you did zero. 
---
There's probably some issue between when it begins calculating the damage and when it's applied, likely the same issue which doesn't apply modifiers at all.
---
Ty, if u donate 500, do u get 2 packs or no?
---
You get xp just from breathing in this game, it will be much faster to level up if you’ll acquire mutations and go full UNY build
---
Ty
---
Post-Apocalyptisims is my favorite game ever.
---
Personally, they should just release it as single player with private multiplayer server support, and open it up to modders.
---
Only way any TES/FO bethesda game maintains it's longevity.
---
If this is true, then a hot fix or emergency patch must be issued. This is a crucial perk for just about all of the player base. Adrenaline being broken sucked but could be ignored. Class freak on the other hand can't as this can totally alter the whole build.
---
Oh tell me about it’s like when it seriously took me two rolls to get both arms and chest I said oh man this is easy.... oh let me tell you. I was completely wrong lol
---
Yeah it is, but not as embarassing as the people who still pay for shit like Fallout 1st, and have been since it's release. You've allready given them your money, they dont give a shit now, why are you surprised? They're very well known for being like this and have been for a long time now. Focus your outrage elsewhere because they are not listening, never have and never will.
---
Do a new character. You would have to move a point than get a perk over the next 30+ levels. It can be done significantly faster from scratch.
---
Yeah. The bunker I can find three at usually. I’ll find one go turn in it and then come back and check more desks.
---
I have done respecs on existing characters numerous times and recently I decided to just make a new character to try a new play style. 
---
Making a new character is more time consuming because you have to lvl it up obviously to get your perks where you want them. But even after hitting rank 50 you still need to lvl up a fair amount to get other essential perk cards to the ranks you’ll want them. It turns into this fun little game of knowing where and when to add points to your perks while you’re leveling to 50 so you don’t have to move points around after 50 and can just focus on maxing cards out. 
---
I would say if you have enough lvl ups just do a respec if you want to use the new build right away. Otherwise it could turn into days or weeks worth of leveling depending on how often you can play.
---
The asshole who no longer wants to work on this project and is actively seeking ways to sabotage it so they can get all the praise of a "normal" Bethesda title they thought they were getting when they accepted the job.
---
\*My personal opinion.
---
You keep taking stuff away from the people that support you without giving in return. I don’t care about whatever exploit others are doing it doesn’t ruin the game for me. What does is taking away how I can build. My wife heard this cancelled her sub and deleted the game. Get back to embracing your player base instead of alienating them. She’s not alone either this patch instantly cut my friend circle in half in game. And these are older long time bethesda supporters you’re loosing now not exploiting children. The whole feel of Bethesda has changed with me and I’m not alone. I know this seems petty but we’ve been talking about it and it’s a perception of how you are embracing your player base that is changing and that taints an entire company not just one game. It’s not this one thing it’s just the straw that broke the camels back.
---
I found Who Shall Not Be Named. Thanks!
---
Doing the lord's work.
---
Sad to see people still giving them money for it as well.
---
If you go up to the box it says 250 so I don't believe you can add more than that at once
---
same here...
---
That could have been said about every problem since launch as nothing is fixed in a timely manner unless it cost Zenimax/Bethesda money.
---
Increments of 250. Don’t bother bulking like when selling to train stations as the collection boxes will not accept.
---
It is far more likely that whoever worked on Fallout 76 is no longer working on the patches for Fallout 76. Those people are on to a new project now. These patches aren't from the same team.
---
I thought to myself, "wouldnt it be glorious if everyone just didn't bother donating anything, and then Bethesda would need to update the rewards for donations into something it should have been in the first place!"
---
But then I realised, no, they will just fuck it up as well.  Like they FUCK.  EVERY.  SINGLE.  FUCKING.  THING.  UP.
---
No, I'm not. My age doesn't matter b/c not every young person is an idiot. A good many including most of the Millennials are.  
---
It may be old but plenty of 'old' games are better than a lot of shit games out today. Fallout has largely improved over what it used to be.
---
They recently changed it to only require a feral ghoul sample, so it might be bugged in a way where it doesn’t think you put the right sample in if you have all 3. Might need a new character straight up
---
Ok ty.
---
Thank you for your service! 
---
I think learning to hear through a persons unreasonable humanity can sometimes provide great insight into solving their problem while at the same time providing insight on how to prevent more of those personnel liabilities that are certainly unacceptable.
---
Agreed, bunkers and instanced camps will be launched likely later this year. This is step one of removing surface unique camps.
---
He just *really* wants to trade
---
Are you stealth? I carry a death claw gauntlet I use unless it's lvl 60ish guys since arrows are hard to come by
---
Each time you log in and out, the affected mutations change, and the stats are directly affected by the changes respectively.
---
Whether it's just a visual glitch, I can't say. But stats definitely being changed.
---
Good tip ty!
---
You need good communication *and* follow through.
---
Otherwise it’s like a worthless unemployed spouse who does the dishes once a month and thinks that’s helping, while everything else in the house is falling apart
---
I need to get Fallout 1st, so I can get access to the Scrap stash box as my normal one is completely full and my character inventory is overweight lol, before heading off to The Bunker and turning it in.
---
Well, you've got me there.
---
Is there anything we can do about this???? Really pissing me off
---
Yes, you would add 250 then immediately add another 250.
---
What gave you the impression that a backpack would be a pack on your back?
---
Same never used gun-fu. I use grim reapers sprint sometimes but not often.
---
No its not gun-fu...
---
sucks
---
PC
---
They do it to get reactions like this post.  If you let it bother you, they won.
---
I said yeah, as in, yeah there's no evil plot or anything. I said except as in, except the reason isn't what you think, it's because of an exploit they saw the need to fix.
---
Nobody's trying to invalidate your post. At least, I'm not.
---
you on the xbone?
---
You mean the free loot/death drop bag? I noticed that I have to crouch down at a very specific spot in front of the bag or I can’t loot it. Annoying as fuck.
---
This is Bethesda since the Toddfather took over sadly.  He caters to the casuals and fucks over the hardcore.  Although 76 doesn’t seem to cater to anyone really.  I’m enjoying it because I just got into it but I can see already the writing on the wall with this game which sucks cuz I thought the SCORE stuff and Colossal Wendigo would be awesome for the players especially the long term ones but from everything I’m reading they are just trying to squeeze as much money from it as possible while doing the least amount of work.  Just look at the atom shop from FO4 and Skyrim.  That stuff is overpriced garbage and they put lipstick on a pig saying they were trying to find a way to get the modding community money for their hard work but that really just took modders out of the community and didn’t create anything worthy of the price - horse armor all over again.  Really sucks because I love the Elder Scrolls and Fallout franchises but TES6 and FO5 are going to probably be even worse based on what they’ve shown us with FO76.  I just got FO1st a couple days ago (monthly subscription) but probably going to cancel unless they do right by the community.
---
Seems to me people aren't talking about the real problem in all of this.  People were double stacking walls as part of a work around so they could put wallpaper on both sides of the wall.   But a work around should  never have been necessary. You should just be able to put wallpaper on both sides of the damn wall.  Double stacking walls was more of a tedious work around that should not be needed.
---
Just play normally and donate if you feel like it. Honestly I've only seen like 2 people donate and dispute being day 2, half of the steel has been donated. The creates you get are pointless but a hat, flag and extra score points will be available regardless!
---
What happened with speed demon?
---
I know that this comment was made 3 months ago, that's why I'm actually answering this now; I assume that you've had ample time to finish the Wastelanders questline. If not, then spoilers ahead.
---
You can turn in treasury notes to &gt;!gold press machines in Foundation and Crater in order to get a few extra Gold Bullion per day (there is a cap on the amount that you can get every day).!&lt;
---
The game also doesn't really tell you how to get gold bullion after you finish the Wastelanders line, so you could totally miss this part if you don't look up how to actually earn gold.
---
Stam-based damage over time. I put attribute points into stam and health at a 2:1 ratio and I take all the morphs from the two dps class lines that do damage over time with a stam cost. 
---
You basically want to focus on either stamina or magicka for dps. For staff you can basically just spam force shock and you're good lol
---
Yeah!! Such great stuff!!!! Keep donating and don't bother looking on this sub to find a thousand posts on this very topic!!
---
There are many exploits that work only or more consistently with laggy servers. The obvious ones are duping, but there were also things with people abusing scrip machines to trade untradeable items among other things. Probably helpful in instakilling the SBQ too
---
Did you use a credit/debit card or platform specific wallet?
---
Bethesda could be tasked with a singular job, find people wanting to enjoy an orgy at the PlayBoy Mansion.  They'd turn up with two nuns, and a giraffe.
---
Can I add, the whole merchant system is terrible?  I mean, they make anything worth buying thousands of caps/gold bars, but make getting enough to spend impossible. You get enough stuff to sell to earn caps? NOPE! All merchants are now out of caps!  You beat the main game until the next DLC?  Good luck earning notes to get gold bars!
---
I can spend all day in the game, but I'm never any closer to getting enough caps and gold bars to do anything worth the work.  (Same with getting the different types of flux, but that's another rant)
---
LOLOL HAHA \^\^\^This guy still believes in patch notes LOL.
---
(Just joking brother)
---
I feel like you're over-selling the Brotherhood of Steel a little bit. In the first game they're a highly-secretive tech cult who only tried to help the vault dweller after trying and failing to have them killed, and they still have to be convinced to actually do anything useful, despite knowing that there's problems before you did.
---
By the second game, as a result of being highly-secretive weirdos, they've stagnated to the point of barely being present and immediately being outclassed by the Enclave.
---
Their behavior in New Vegas is pretty well in line with their behavior in the first two games, and in 3 and 4 they're an entirely different group on an entirely different side of the country.
---
No, PlayStation card
---
I figured this would be how it went :(
---
Climate change caused by nuclear fallout.
---
Where do we donate?
---
Dense mod and fire proof rank 3? No damage from regular explosives. However I find that I can die fairly easily by energy explosives.
---
The fog machine is cool but it won't stay on. You have to turn it on every time you log in. I kinda just forgot about it
---
You are much better off making a new character imo. I've done 3 major respecs on my main. And I have 5 characters total. It is much easier to set characters up down certain paths early on in the game than changing them up later.
---
At the same time, if you plan to main the character, it may be better to keep one and change it to what you want. When I first started back in beta I was running a 2 hand PA build and decided a year ago, after hitting like level 100 or so, to delete it and start over with my new main. I'd definitely be much higher level by now had I just respecced my old main. But I kind of enjoy leveling builds so it was worth it.
---
you got fuckin' rekt.
---
Sometimes
---
Wow. That didn't take much to show how hypocritical you are given the tone of your post VS the tone of this comment.
---
I really have nothing further to add.
---
You can get some weapon and armor plans that you may or may not have (power armor, fgrognak axe, etc
---
I had that problem when I started 3 weeks ago where one attack my workshop while defending, there was many other workshop not claimed. Was  lv120 ish with a LV 46 friend but I just block them and  moved on
---
what killed you?
---
Scrap box
---
Technically not their own, the people who worked on originally creating the fo4 building systems are in a different studio and could very well be gone altogether by now. Although yes, any modder can tell you that working with these games is a huge pain no matter what youre trying to do
---
I got 3 in a row soon after I turned L50 and started turning in tech data.  After those three, have not gotten another....so at least a year and 175 more levels, lots of other stuff, but no more paint.
---
Oddly enough, they worked fine with the Ranger armor outfit and VTU jacket and jeans
---
I vote for a complete re-vamp of CAMP building, the rules are too tight, too restrictive.  
---
At first I cared about flaoting CAMPs, but now I really do not care about a few immersion breaking CAMPs, if the rules were lifted, there would be many many more creative CAMPs that look amazing, no matter what you'll always get at least a few immersion breaking CAMPs, but with the current rules in place, people dont feel like they should even bother trying to build good CAMPs, just a box or a staircase with a box on it.  
---
Loosen the restrictions, a Foundation should not be required for building, clipping objects together should be allowed.  
---
We already have a set build limit, its really not going to make any difference how the objects are placed if we can still only place x amount of them in our CAMP spaces
---
I am doing this because I do not agree with the recent changes made to camps.  Whether or not it accomplishes something is irrelevant.  If it accomplishes something great.  If not, I had fun doing this and that is what matters.
---
It wasnt. I lived off crits for my first 200 levels and now I regularly miss 2 out of 5 crits.(Bar still gets depleted in those situations as well.
---
On your playstation go to [Settings] &gt; [Account Management] &gt; [Account Information] &gt; [Services List]. and see if it shows up in there.
---
And yet, Kyle, you keep coming back for *more*.
---
how else were they supposed to fix adrenaline? there can be only so many perks that work active at once
---
Same here. Just did Radiation Rumble and it was terrible.
---
I stopped after 750, best thing I got was a plan for a T51B mod, hydraulic bracers or something like that and the rest was alchohol and floater grenades that I just trashed.
---
yes, but that's only **one(!)** of the problems.  
---
Every single software has at least one bug/issue. But amount of bugs that are delivered to end-user also depends on testing!
---
I liked this the first time I read it.
---
Ps4 here 
---
Yeah it's not working for healing factor or grounded on 3 out of 4 characters.
---
  There are a number of NPCs that tell you “I know a guy that can fix that”
---
So I’d venture it is (or was) in the grand plan.
---
same thoughts. I guess this subreddit is all about complaining. Players who enjoy the game are not welcome here.
---
Yeah, last time it was the bag that was supposed to be in the collectors edition being delayed and literally  a plastic trash bag, this time its the patch that brought the duffel just ruining half this subs gameplay
---
I switched to dodgy and I definitely missed it. I would rather kill stuff quick than tank damage for a while....
---
Ok this response from Bethesda is appreciated, I honestly assumed it was due to exploits so makes sense but we really need additional tools for camp and as a fallout 1st sucker you would keep me hooked if membership included a no mans sky style of turning off requirements for wiring.
---
We used to but lately I cant even log in. I've resorted to BR games. Bethesda needs their ass handed to them for this kind of behavior. BTW holly shit I have read 20-30 comments without a fan boy comment yet. Is everyone feeling ok?
---
Thanks for responding to it. I don't really have much else to add but thank you
---
It's good for newer players who don't have a lot of rare plans like mounted heads.
---
My 2nd and 3rd characters I leveled up as fast as possible....At level 50 I had about 35-40 points saved up.  At that point I only used the points towards the build I wanted.  By about level 65 I had my build complete.  I then added in my QoL cards as I ranked up.  I had help from friends and also used my 1st character to help out as I went along.
---
They broke the meat/ashpiles. They cause massive fps drop when you look at their direction. Go make official bug report to get it fixed faster.
---
Wow! u mad!
---
Try checking carry capacity as that's derived from strength
---
Me three
---
- Play on PS4 Pro
---
- Install an SSD
---
- Get better internet
---
- Get a PS5 in the future to force the game to run better through Boost Mode.
---
I was wondering what was going on when I tried crippling the ghouls during radiation rumble yesterday with my gauss shotgun. Now I know why.
---
If you have a lower level character, you may be better served to transfer your steel to that character for the turn in to make use of plans it may not have learned yet.
---
Lol its only considered an exploit because in the event you use it in pvp, you could have an "advantage." Like anyone would use it in pvp and even if they did, it would be far from an advantage.
---
Bethesda, who cares man! Nobody is going to use it in pvp and probably only 2% of players do pvp anyway. The bow is a pve weapon and a crappy one at that.
---
 I’m a melee build, but I notice on the rare times I use vats, it’s not too great.
---
Yeah but it just changed the way some wall worked with accidentally made some wall trick placements work. They might even just change it back. Honestly don’t know why everyone is stomping feet and holding their breathe over it. Just don’t build double walls for a couple of weeks and see if devs can change it back. There is already one workaround just using brick walls instead.
---
99 bugs on the wall.  99 bugs.  Patch one down and pass it around, 127 bugs on the wall.
---
If you think about it, like really think about it, every elder scrolls and previous fallout games feel the same way once you did every side quest and main  quest. There's just nothing to do. Difference is you felt fulfilled in those games due to the story. This game, the ending is anticlimactic. It's as if your presence doesn't even matter.
---
Us people against FO1st did say don’t subscribe from day 1!
---
Do you want x01?  I know it doesn't hold a candle to Strangler heart
---
Watch angry turtles video on power armour. The difference between raider and ultracite is minimal.
---
I cancelled too. Played since beta . .. I checked in on score but I've basically checked out on this game when Pete Hines said no one pvps. since survival isn't coming back.. it's really hard to invest myself. I saw this event as nothing but a resource suck. I can't afford to give up my stash since I don't have fallout 1st anymore but I'm not giving them any of my mindlessly grinded resources until they give me FACTION WARS/ PVP WHICH WAS PROMISED BEFORE SURVIVAL WAS ANNOUNCED YET THEY NEVER DELIVERED. Still waiting on that.. fuck some brotherhood cosmetics.
---
That's a rather specific insult for somebody making a joke in a video game
---
They didn't. It's been bugging like that for awhile now. He/it is randomly all over the area.
---
It was really this issue just alot sooner on the timeline. I feel right from the start they had a great team and then Bethesda shifted them off the project after the map was mostly complete and noobs have been in charge every since beta.
---
Call me stupid but I just wanna stop wasting AP on vats when my character decides to melee while pressing l1/r1
---
It's not just the walls or this patch that was totally f\*\*ked up! It is EVERYTHING for the past two years just boiling over and people are getting tired of it! This is a whole lot bigger then you are painting it out to be! But I am sure your good friends at Bethesda appreciate your touching attempt to make things right tho! Probably Not?
---
I was having issues with camps and enemies loading in last night and game was choppy on PS4. Game usually runs very smooth, so leaning towards it being patch/server side rather then coincidental internet might have been acting up on patch day.
---
Nothing new. 
---
Lol wanted to change the title. Something more fitting, you know?
---
did one before on xbone and had no problems, well, apart from 4 dead scavengers and no ore collected
---
Lol nailed it
---
You need to press the exit button for a few seconds
---
We don’t have everything that was promised though. 1st players were supposed to receive larger camp budgets and radius, workshop permanence and more support. We’ve heard nothing regarding any of these things since they were promised before 1st went live.
---
they are not even on the loot tables on these boxes.  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W0nsHf67V3\_ke0RLgsIMwPb8kpI0kLgfX\_0\_bZPTTs/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W0nsHf67V3_ke0RLgsIMwPb8kpI0kLgfX_0_bZPTTs/edit#gid=0)
---
If you use Unyielding then that also has problem with carry weight, especially when damaged.
---
I recently gave up on Fallout 76.  Or should say that I am trying to.  Still have an OCD-like itch to log on and do something.  But, I have come to the conclusion - at least for me - that grind is nothing but OCD behavior.  You grind for the sake of the grind.  The rewards don't seem to be worth it (to me) and any new content just seems to be another reason for grinding my way towards nothing.
---
I tip my hat to those who still enjoy and play 76.  I hope that their love for this games continues.  But I think I am done.  I am thinking about ordering a hard copy of Fallout 3 - game of the year version - and seeing how much I might enjoy revisiting that world.
---
Good luck with your search for a new game! I like that "airship" concept of yours.
---
the times when it is not killing a creature for NW daily, I find 5 creatures back to back. the one time the daily is to kill creatures, I cant find a single one to save my life
---
I will. Thank you. And I agree.  Pvp in power armor is foolish. I dont pvp, but would like all of my characters to be able to a bit. I just finished wastelanders with my heavy and will now grind either t65 or strangler heart. So I'm just trying to decide which one.
---
Their not double walls in Atom shop their secure walls just so your watching for the right items.
---
Unfortunately so far based on posts I read it seems that Patch 21 broke An Ounce of Prevention quest most likely thanks to that change they made to the quest listed in the patch notes and it broke some instance quest areas this includes areas used by the Cheating Death and From Russian with Lev quests.
---
The only real complaint I saw was that the enemies gave next to no exp. I remember something like 12 exp for charred ghouls. If you didn't keep having all your progress reset due to disconnects or a laggy terminal/door taking too long and failing the timer, I don't think people would have been upset at trading all those resources for unique armor plans and a legendary
---
Or just get a mildly decent drop and sell it for 15k 5mm on the market place and skip making ammo all together.
---
I find that the end game for me was just collecting powerful and rare weps and gear that just get duped eventually so I was wasting my time.. as far as I’ve seen this game is a failure and is now a cash grab with the fo1st and people  can’t see that unfortunately... I wish this game did really well because I love the whole universe and the settings it’s just all poorly executed..
---
I’m going to try out outer worlds soon!
---
Im just gonna fill em with as much fertilizer as i can to reflect the amout of thought that went into this crappy community challenge. Whoever at bethesta came up with this needs sacked.
---
I'll buy that for a dollar.
---
Aren't really builds in this game. Cept use these cards to live and fight, user this one too make etc... Kinda annoying and cumbersome to even use.
---
Certain people don’t understand by looking at the upvote ratio they can’t accept that this a shit game and no amount of whining will change that
---
another crying baby. it is a game, pal. if u dont enjoy this one try something new.
---
Switching weapons supposedly removes the buff
---
I knowww and I'm very against micro transactions in video games. This game turned me into a hypocrite. Endless scrap storage and monthly atoms was too alluring. It also became the main game I was playing for months. But you're definately right. I should've known better.
---
I think there was actually confusion over the model in that it was based off of a 1970's Soviet missile transport vehicle? It's possible they're redesigning a more appropriate fire truck.
---
If you're on Xbox and need some of the plans I will join you up for free. I got most of the plans that drop from it from treasure maps just collecting dust.
---
Mhm yeah. The workshop stuff straight up sucked.
---
It used to heal you while moving IF you had an effect active that increases your maximum life. There are many effects that increase maximum life but lifegiver was the easiest way. It was relied on quite heavily by bloodied players to stay alive at low health.
---
Anyway, it was fixed (nerfed) so we gotta use stimpacks again, but on the upside we get 4 perk points freed up.
---
Quality info mate
---
These kinds of posts were a daily occurrence back in the old days. There really is nothing else to it other than wanting the validation. Everybody else who plays the game and comes here to talk about it knows roughly what the experience is like. You don't need to tell a mechanic that fixing cars can be messy work. But coming here and having other people agree that you're a victim because the game isn't working right is something different entirely
---
Just experienced this with Radiation rumble.  Wasn't even worth it to me to try and pick up the loot it was so bad.
---
It's on you for playing such a piece of shit game. It was a piece of shit when it launched. And it remains a piece of shit. No amount of patches can change this turd sandwich. Time to abandon ship.
---
Right forgot to mention that, I'm on PC D:
---
I audibly went 'ugh' when I read that.  Who cares about lore, right?
---
\^ This is fact
---
I checked, logged in with Class Freak equipped, checked stats and carry weight, removed then re equipped it and stats were the same.  
---
It looks like it's just a visual bug.
---
 "its their game that they have designed this way for a reason."
---
Lol you're gonna get downvoted to hell. Nobody speaks up against entitled dicks
---
They're not even rare with duped presents. I see them in so many vending machines
---
People are selling them by the thousands and tens of thousands on eBay and also use them for trading.
---
yeah the hitbox for the duffel is suuuuper small
---
In PvP there is a damage cap per hit. 110 or somewhere around there last I knew. It may be a little higher now but I’m unsure. 
---
So no matter how much damage your weapon does to enemies and creatures it will only do up to the cap against another player.
---
Edit: VATS doesn’t work in PvP anymore and being a bloodied build is why you got killed so fast. Your HP total was probably near or below 110 so the other player only needs to land a couple hits to kill you.
---
bcz there is no other life for them i guess. and they cant enjoy what they got.
---
It all depends on what you want to do.  Do you want to frequently switch back and forth?  If so, have 2 characters to do so.  
---
If you are progression minded, do not start a new character.  Despite what people are saying, levels come faster the farther you get into this game.  Whatever damage you've done to your build, you can overcome it quickly if you're smart. 
---
Legendary perks are coming, and experience is the most important thing for progression right now.  If you wish to get as far as you can quickly, you will want to on your highest level character get some unyeilding gear and a preferably a bloodied weapon and start getting lots of xp.  It's not necessary by any means, but you'll be able to get levels faster.  I play about 1-2 hours a day, only about 30 mins - hr of actual grinding, level 725 currently, and I can get about 5 levels a day in that time period.  People think that as you level up it gets harder and harder, but honestly it gets easier and easier.
---
There are other games with uncapped levels, thinking of black desert, where it actually gets harder to level up significantly, this game is nothing like that.  Experience and levels are like candy the higher you go, if you play smart.  Starting over significantly slows you down.  I just recently swapped from a rifleman build to a shotgunner/heavy gunner build myself with high intelligence ever since the PTS info on legendary perks came out.  It took me about 15 perk points to swap it all, and in the mean time I've gotten over 200 levels.
---
Oooowch.
---
They just totally screwed up everyone's camps and ways of building using certain glitches. So all these builds they are trying to showcase are based on methods that probably don't even work anymore.
---
Clearly you have never been to the World or warcraft or the Overwatch forums....
---
Not sure if related, but at least one of my bonuses on the Effects tab are visually bugged.  My carry weight bonus from having carnivore is correctly doubled in terms of how much I can actually carry, but the Effects tab shows it as the default un-doubled value.
---
Maybe they borked the whole Effects tab in general?
---
Asinine.
---
I want to know everything the developers are working on and have the community vote on what should be the priority.  No work that is not on the list, and only work on what we approve as the highest priority.  We're the customer.
---
Good call. Logged out..yada yada.
---
Eagle Eyes changed from -4 to -1 (STR) and carry weight remained consistent. 
---
Put class freak out/in all STR were fine, weight stayed constant. 
---
Crazy visual bug for whatever bethesda reason then?
---
Hold down O on the ps4 controller.
---
Or ESO ones.....
---
Oh i heard that they were, well damn that sucks. Thanks for the link i was looking for this.
---
No, you can grind rep with both factions.
---
Well since you asked: 
---
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.gamespot.com/amp-articles/witcher-3s-sales-by-system-how-the-game-has-sold-o/1100-6475832/
---
Probably but it's more fun if you play the game
---
Wouldn't put it past them lol. 
---
Tested a few times with the advice of another user, it has to be some crazy visual bug. Keeps changing.
---
Yeah your right I mean its not like a GMC looks like a chevy or a chevy like a chrysler ever. Clearly conglomerates never share info with their subsidaries.....
---
Yeah it's so bad of a fetch it's laughable. It comes down to: what do i get out of this? Is it immersive in any way? No. Does it make me care about the brotherhood of STEEL? No. Was 2 purified waters, a radaway, 3 arrows, and stimpack worth it? No, I could literally get the same rewards from doing a daily.... Anytime I open the map, Atlas is empty as shit. I went there and was baffled by how bare bones it is. Must have been a similar feeling to when fo76 first launched?
---
So do I want to keep returning 250 steel to see if I yield better rewards? No. Do i want to turn halloween candy in at monster mash? No. Do i want to farm the mine events for tokens? No. 
---
All the no's aside, it's one less bullshitty thing to do in this game when I could be doing other bullshitty things that at least serve my best interests. Guess the brotherhood of steel will become the brotherhood of jackshit
---
You have to use full set to get bonus
---
I *do* own the game.....
---
Alright thanks. Wanted a certain answer before I pick a side.
---
I donated 10k and after opening 40 boxes I got over encumbered with booze and grenades. I’ll pop in here and there if I remember but otherwise I’m pretty much all set with this event. They nailed it with the Christmas scorched event and slowly degraded after that.
---
Hey thanks man! As someone who owns the Fallout 3 game of the year edition I'd definately say it's worth it if you love the fallout universe. Id avoid Mothership Zeta if i was you, but if not, don't say i didn't warn ya! I'm thinking about trying out 1 and 2 for the first time myself.
---
I have a junkies fast fire rate gauss minigun and I don’t see any magic on it😞
---
Oh really he’s always been in the same place for me before
---
Yeah it wasn’t even showing a button to exit worh
---
I actually run T-65 :). But as the armor isn't tradeable, they didn't take any of that. I appreciate the thought, though!
---
Bethesda wants you to stop using the perk and start paying for their service that will reduce the negative effects of mutations with atoms
---
THis \^\^\^\^\^
---
Yes I think so
---
Shhhhh...duuude 🤣🤣
---
Wait what? I thought that you only had to use the arms to get the mining bonus and the full set for extra carry weight
---
Ha.  I was talking to two people.  I meant to ask you what kind of weapon you use.  Maybe I could get something for you similar
---
I remember from FONV, the NCR drove them out.
---
They either have a skeleton dev team or incompetent dev team, both likely possible due to a small customer base/low revenue from the game. The more likely result is it will shut down but maybe they need a wake up call.
---
Many, many, *many* issues.
---
ESO is a masterpiece compared to this and I have been paying for ESO + for years with no complaints(Have not logged in a 6 months) All I do is regret giving them money for FO1st.
---
Hold up, there was a fallout 4? I don’t recall there ever being one...
---
I’m not the first to say this but make it like a vendor. Select ammo, sell for points. 
---
Sell points, get ammo
---
I was so pumped for this when It was first released and it’s been nothing but a disappointing time waster
---
It's almost like exploits and performance issues are higher priority than some freaking walls on a CAMP. ikr?
---
Oh wait... crap.  Bethesda don't listen to me.  Or hire me, either one.
---
And the canvas bag was LEGIT false advertising (until they were eventually shamed into coughing up) unlike this.
---
We can only hope in the future we see a camp overhaul like a whole event for it as well.
---
Don't see any?  I think you need triple barrel btw
---
The tent is very useful too. I’ll usually put it down outside the fort where I turn in the data. That way I can bounce back and forward from the bunker for a little less caps. The tent acts as a free fast travel point.
---
You've never seen a feature demoed before release?
---
Wait until you hear about movie trailers. That's gonna blow your damn mind.
---
Good for you.
---
I made the same mistake :))  
---
so, yep, full set for extra carry weight + extra mining
---
For me it has been like 50/50 if he is correct place or not. Furthest he/it has been for me has been 180 feet from the grill. Been happening for maybe 3 weeks? Something like that.
---
Yes fallout 3 and fallout new Vegas released on Xbox 360/PS3 and Fallout 4 released on Xbox one/PS4
---
Picking a side gets you faction, if you take all the bullion for yourself you get small loss in faction for both sides, but i say it's worth it since you can just max it out eventually anyways. Getting bullion fast is important.
---
They can't handle the truth.
---
I know I love the franchise but some fanboys can’t admit that it’s trash
---
We live and we learn.
---
It is the torso, not the arms that gives the mining bonus.  You only need the full set to get the increased carry weight.
---
Dang, I always do at a train station and never had probs. 
---
Is this new? Only asking bc I got to wonder if the is like the old NPCs strealing weapons during some events when wastelanders dropped.
---
&gt;IF console players get it first
---
I'm assuming they lack the common sense to figure out you meant PC players. Reading comprehension is clearly not their strong suit
---
Ah. I could have hooked you up. Got a vendor with them all for 250 each. Most people sell them for about 250-450. It's all i seem to do these days. Peddle my serums to the masses.
---
More like 2041, if the game survives that long
---
It's literally become a different style of game, it's just based off of old lore. I'd seriously recommend giving them a try. Yes the graphics are dated and it's an RTS game with a timer but you will never experience the hilarity of a low int.character like they did in 2 in any future release.
---
Let me save you the time. I donated 10k steel and got 40 boxes. Rewards??
---
6 plans I already know
---
A dick ton of booze
---
A bigger dick ton of grenades
---
Chems
---
Over encumbered
---
Spot on man.  Game pass was one of the best things I've ever done.  Also they've put so many  original Xbox and 360 titles on the store for like 5 bucks.
---
Perfect response, take an upvote  from me.
---
I am pretty sure in one of these threads I mentioned I am not going to spend anything on this game again until they start fixing the game breaking bugs, this one chief among them. I won't even spend the atoms I have accumulated.
---
If there was no malicious intent (because they don't like the way the community complains), or they wanted to avoid total screw-ups like is, or even cared about the community. They could just do what everyone has been bitching about for two years. TEST, TEST, TEST, TEST!
---
&gt;The situation is not as simple as reverting changes, which could cause exploits and performance issues to return. However, we are actively looking into our available options to bring some of these building methods back to 76 in a more intended and secure way. For example, we’re discussing what it would take to implement double sided walls. 
---
Cool. I am actively looking into my available options to play a game that is supported by people who care about their community enjoying themselves. Those games will get my money, some of which I have back in-pocket by refunding my FO1^st subscription.
---
The latest patch, in spite of it's ridiculous size, managed to break things that weren't broken before, patch things no one wanted patched, and offer a pitiful "event" with rewards that even I'm not interested in after playing less than 200 hours. Any actual improvements that were supposed to be included were half-assed (why not just add all the usual mods to SS limbs?) and didn't even get implemented due to *yet another bug*. The bar was already so low, and it was still a failure.
---
I'm surprised anyone still plays this trash, vote with your wallet and dont give Bethesda another cent, the fallout series is a fucking joke now, its been running on the same engine since fallout 3 all the way up to fallout 76 just slightly upgraded
---
Thanks for talking to us. Here's some solutions, that might take a bit for you to do, but should be considered something you push to the top of the list.
---
Walls that can be wallpapered on both sides. Like when you see a house being built, but it's just the wooden/metal frame and studs that they will attach the drywall too. There should be doorways and multiple window options. 
---
BETTER STAIRS. This can not be made important enough. The current stair set that takes up two foundations are very hard to work with. More so, since they only come in open grating, often interfere with the style and look people are going for.   
---
I recently put together a visual guide to many things that could be added to the game via plans, and NOT THE ATOMIC shop. I love the atomic shop, I buy a lot of camp stuff. But we need more in game plans. because
---
1. We love stuff for our camps
---
2. we love finding plans for our camps
---
[So please check this out.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout76settlements/comments/hxv9sa/a_visual_guide_to_items_i_think_should_be_added/)
---
We want to really, really make our camps like home. So please, consider what I've outlined here.
---
Story checks out
---
What issues?
---
Like one I found via search is that it'll miss 95% shots alot on the SBQ - anything else?
---
I've been able to repeat it right after completing it, since the update too
---
no u
---
I use the tri barrels already but can’t see significant damage and I feel like my bloodied 1* is stronger than that
---
Thanks for letting us know! Lol, think there going to fix it so you get what you earned...No!
---
Ya i came back to the game with wastelanders after stopping playing once survival mode went away (i am not an op griefer, i just liked the challenge of avoiding ppl while getting exp boost and prob died A LOT). Saw that there are wayyyy too many bugs that make no sense to still b in the game, realized that balancing will never happen, cuz u know a punch will b more powerful than a literal nuclear bomb 🤨. And now after seeing how they just destroyed the only part of this game i still enjoyed i have officially lost all hope for this game. I am not going to support this company anymore and will only buy used physical editions of their games well after they release, no matter how good they are
---
Honestly I stopped playing Fo76 daily just to play Apex what a sad fucking world we live in.
---
A couple of times I rushed to Mothership Zeta so I could get the alien weapons and use for the rest of the game.  I think I have completed the game 15+ times. That is why I haven't purchased the game yet (I can't find my disks anywhere).  I may do 1 and 2 instead since I have never played those. But I do agree that MZ is not the best of the DLCs they release.
---
Todd? Is that you?
---
And neither can you lol
---
Upvote for actually saying zenimax instead of Todd as if one man is able to care about details at that level.
---
A server-wide message/notice board would help with this. 
---
I set up a CAMP near the Wayside, and I got some visitors but not a lot of transactions. Plus, everyone CAMPs there now so finding a server took forever.
---
You should read this about those exploits that don't hurt anyone. 
---

---
That part I knew. I just wanted to know if my morality would end up screwing me out of some cool raider loot.
---
The team needs at least 1 other player than yourself.
---
I just let mine FO1ST lapse.  That means I end up with stuff I can't store.  I trade it for a bag of stuff.  OK.
---
Generally it's good business practice to listen to feedback both good and bad from your consumer base.  While some stuff may be way out there, they would just like to see the product improve.
---
&gt;You all act like you own the game and Bethesda has to listen to your requests, its their game that they have designed this way for a reason.
---
Oh we are gonna use the BF5 strategy of "we made it this way, don't like it don't buy(play) it"  let's see how that worked out...  (extra insult to injury since I've been a huge fan of that series since 2, until the 5 situation)
---
Performance issues? I call fucking bullshit. I've had the worst performance AFTER this shitty patch. 5 fps at every event.
---
Huh.  I have 33% vats and bloodied 3 star and I can definitely tell a difference between that and a vanilla one I made.  I was at full health to account for bloodied.  Maybe try to roll some more and get a better one?
---
I often leave my character in my camp while i do other stuff like social networking, reading, yoga, things, stuff.
---
I find i get people coming over to look by joining a party or starting a party. Also. Speaking from experience players LOVE junk. I'm not saying you should put some really overpriced junk in your vendors to attract people.. but you do you.
---
I've been quite frustrated too, and wish I'd never had prepaid for a year of FO1st.  Do they give a prorated refund you think if you cancel early?  I've got like 10.5 months left and this shit is getting worse each patch.
---
You ain't wrong. One person literally ended his rant with an all caps. 
---
QUIT FUCKING UP OUR GAME!!
---
Logging in every day no matter what for Legendary Run dailies is definitely a chore. I like having something to do in the game, but I’m no longer enjoying the game. I can’t wait to get to 100 and take a break.
---
Honestly I think Todd had a secret deal already in place for a TV and movie for fallout. But he knew as long as a game for so popular he was afraid that doing the movie and TV would take away from the games. So he and his group made this game as terrible as They did. Just so they can pitch the idea of a movie and TV series to save the franchise
---
Apparently people dont like the truth
---
Same here. I am getting in to COD:Warzone though. Trouble is I can solo win NW but I have yet to win a Warzone match. I think the steep learning curve will be worth it though.
---
You guys really need to start reaching out to the modding community. You'd be surprised of what you could accomplish on this game if you would just asked for help. Stop being foolish and proud. Clearly the millennial's you have on staff are only tackling the easy fixes to say they got something accomplished, and are leaving the harder stuff for 'someone else' to do. But, they don't realize that there isn't anyone else, because all the people with an actual work ethic no longer want to work with them.
---
It's a lot of ridiculous behavior, over some of the dumbest shit imaginable.
---
This game is a mess and I've played about half a year now. I get that it's not the same as Fallout but I highly recommend ESO, Zenimaxx does a great job with it and I've played it on and off over the years. Every aspect of it is night and day vs this game. I can't think of a game that gives you more bang for buck in content for the price of the base game alone.
---
It is going to happen. No matter what Bethesda does. Almost.
---
Whahahahahaha
---
had the idea to rent ad space on the login page but nobody cared for it
---
Best use of that bullshit subscription so far. I get about 300 score everytime i run it
---
No Francis, it's my thread. You're the one who keeps coming back.
---
I disagree. A single post by the sub to discuss this specific issue will. "You're just upset" nice toxic reply bro.
---
Nope, as long as you're in a public team even by yourself it works. Things like Strange in Numbers needs another in team tho.
---
Xbox one here, the card not working for speed demon on my main Charakter and the action girl card does not work properly either
---
Yes correct. Full set needed. I read once where someone said you only needed arms or just the torso. I though it was wrong so I tested it with just arms and just torso. You do not get anywhere near the same amount of ore as you do when wearing the full set.
---
Ahh.. isn’t the junkies alone is already magic?
---
Ammo brings them in.
---
Im a roadside attraction, I have 6k ammo (10mm) and they seem to stop by to see what it is, when they see the ammo count on the map when looking at my camp.
---
Sure, they don't buy the 10mm, but they usually leave with some plans, or some water, or some nukashine
---
Pls. XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
---
I don’t think I can talk to people anymore, didn’t seem to be working today, I will have to check again tomorrow.
---
You're definitive of toxic doesn't fit like 80-90% of this subs definition dude, maybe you're wrong?
---
I have yet to be on a gaming sub where people didn't act like this.
---
Naw they ain't ballsy enough to do that.
---
I feel ya. Love the game, the immersion. Have endured and chuckled at the quirks and keep pushing on looking for cool stuff. Except after donating 250 steel....that was the epitome of "meh".  So...i went back to playing the way I like playing and looking for cool people to hang out with.  I thought I had done everything and just stumbled across Death and Taxidermy for the first time. Then I blew up a Radrat Horde for 2 legendaries, which beats an SBQ rolling pin.  Maybe I will take out Heather Ellis tomorrow...and her little dog too.
---
Stop donating. Seriously.
---
 Haven't heard it before. 
---
So it's either new, or no one else transfers near any npcs.
---
Things are shitty, I get that. What I don’t get is the weird perception some of you have when it comes to software development. Most of the time when a product is bad it’s all down to leadership and very often is a bunch of people you’ve never heard of. Project managers, directors, marketing folks. 
---
No developer ever in the world wakes up with the intention of making bad software
---
It’s a public discussion, Karl. 
---
And again, you getting so triggered over me simply saying to enjoy the benefits is too delicious to let go just yet.
---
Just how heavy *is* that cowchip on your shoulder?
---
*And that edit was literally seconds after I posted, because that’s the full entirety of what I intended to type but hit send a bit too fast.  But it’s so amusing watching you continue to be upset, event when I corrected myself to express my intended meaning.*
---
Must be nice being perfect!  Oh, wait, I looked at your other posts. You’re not. Even you admit it. 
---
Keep on with the rant and whining. Entertain me.
---
workshops are pvp zones. they attack you because they want to pvp. the game even warns you about this, so you have no right to be upset about it.
---
Thing is, I don't think it will take away the need for me to lug around water, since the difference in AP regen is very noticeable.  Unless they get rid of that too, (and I have not heard any suggestion that they will), then it will make no difference to me.
---
Walk around shouting adverts into your mic like an old time town crier
---
Yes. It's supposed to be.  But who knows tbh.  For all I know, it could work on everything but this specific gun.  I recommend more "science!"
---
What was your best reward so far for it?
---
When the fast travel fails for me I crouch so it says "hidden" or I stand and crouch again so it says "hidden".  Works nearly every time.  Still annoying though
---
does un equip / equip work for AG? I didn't even notice, I will check it out tonight
---
Do both sides missions before you do the final one
---
if you cant find anything about this, you arent looking hard enough.
---
Try holding the back button down for a while!
---
It brought us together before, it shall do it again!  At least till day 3 when everyone is bored of beating those drums
---
My game in regular adventure mode has been super laggy after this update and gotten kicked out of the server 5 times already tonight. On ps4
---
Congrats. Now you gotta set yourself up with speed records to see how fast you can do a silo
---
Hold the button instead.
---
PSN: MothmanLoyalist
---
U would get the exact same xp/score as u would if u solo it killing everyone. This just bunches them together. I'm totally with u that its the best use of the subscription tho.
---
it's caps, booze, various grenades and landmine, stimpaks and sometimes plans. I've gotten 4 plans I didn't know so far. Donated about 8k steel.
---
Actually had fun collecting it. I can carry about to about 3k steel. Me and my friend spent a good part of the time really exploring Morgan town, top to bottom. Found a lot of things we didn't know. Then we went supermutant hunting. Because with scrapper perk, and using a Guns and Bullets issue 5 mag, I was getting between 25-40 steel for weapons.
---
Didn't really care about the rewards. Just found a way to make it fun.
---
Yeah I’ve done that. I’m just at the point where I need to choose.
---
You wanna know the funniest thing?
---
*This is pretty much how the ammo press in The Pitt worked.*
---
Stop lying, Charles. You and I both know your original comment was "It's a bug." Nothing more, until you added two more sentences so you wouldn't look like such an ass after people started downvoting you.
---
Was just on a server where someone did this. Holy crap my frame tanked completely. I mean all the way to the point that I had to FT away and leave all that sweet sweet loot behind.
---
Found the guy who leeches SBQ and makes it take longer for all the players actually contributing to the fight.
---
Ok, checked and I've not noticed any difference.
---
I also don't understand how you'd die because your mutations aren't supressed.
---
nothing I was loading into the vault and then I immediately got killed
---
We were dancing moments before the clip too! It's sad how people turn in you in the wasteland! 😞😋
---
Saved my ass I feel dumb
---
It can spawn during and after. read somewhere if you kill everything in the grove and check after 10 minutes it might have spawned.
---
Give it 2 years they will fix it
---
Isn't 5k the limit you can hold? If so, be careful. ;)
---
It's almost always been that shitty for me on my X. My girlfriend's less powerful S can handle it just fine. Good optimization Bethesda. Fucking morons.
---
only of his name is Specialist Zach and he bitches and moans about everyone around him being incompetant while wondering how the hell i broke my shotgun so badly again.

You should really check out grounded, it’s still in early access but it launched on the 28th. Made by obsidian the guys behind new Vegas. But the mood tone and setting are all pretty intact already and there is a creative mode outside of the base game so you can just freely build which is what I’ve done as I encountered a bug one the base game. 
---
This is not shameless plug but here’s a list of videos of things I’ve personally built in it again not to get another viewer just a fallout 76 player that loved the game until recent months. But there’s a lot to like already even it’s first stages. 
---
It’s also free on game pass for pc or $29 on steam 
---
[grounded build playlist ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC3JKUx5FGaBLCMywtOehfNAzncnAVAOW)
---
Meanwhile I wanted to donate but I only have 230... gotta save some space in that tiny camp.
---
I didnt know about the alt hud till someone told me, you can find it in the settings! It takes up much less space in the screen than the regular PA hud😋
---
Show me the hundreds of posts and complaints about that issue. Also, acknowledge my other points, since you want to go this route.
---
How much do you sell your nukashine for ?
---
I've tested whole brick with the flamethrower; still works.
---
TBF This game was never good, it was just addicting because the addicting mechanics are all they put effort into. I was super into it but I started to realized I enjoyed what it could be way more than what it was and that the devs had no intention on making it the game it could be. It's sad. But whatever.
---
I have the same problem but it only last for 10 seconds, I thought it was my old Xbox.
---
Some other decent ammo for earning points to convert on the cheap depending what resources you have access to are cannonballs (lead only), railway spikes (steel only), .50 ball (lead+steel only), harpoons (time only with flechette mod)
---
I just said that. I **just** explained that I made the edit very shortly after to clarify my meaning since intended to include more detail but accidentally didn’t. 
---
Oh, but Mr Perfect can’t let that go. He can’t even recognize positive intent and has to throw around that cowchip on his shoulder. 
---
Clearly, you’re salty about other things than a simple edited comment. 
---
Please, continue to amuse me.
---
Wait is it not in this patch either?!?
---
Is this any different from sports fanboy who always support their team no matter how much they suck? What incentive do they have to win/improve if they have your money regardless?
---
You forgot about the people who blow up the cars. *Minivan Mininukers*
---
Right on, thanks dude.
---
I'm not saying it's right. However, this game is very confusing and not straight forwards in anyway. This has been a bug for a long time. Devs have been nerfing base building, but turn a blind eye to this. Don't hate the player, hate the game.
---
Got his ass.
---
I personally look to see what you have to sell. If a little of everything then yes. If lots of ammo, yes. If a bunch of stimpacks, ain’t happening.
---
Just some plans I didn't know. Me and my friend decided to make it fun. We first explored Morgantown top to bottom. It's actually a good place for ammo. Found some things we didn't know. 
---
Then we hunted Supermutants. Their weapons give a lot of steel. More with scrapper and more if you use a Guns and Bullets issue 5. I was getting between 25-40 steel per weapon. 
---
We did line in the sand, and no one placed a camp to cheat, so it was fun, and the scorched have good weapons to scrap. So over encumbered we went to the Blue Ridge Caravan camp to scrap. 
---
Was so much interested in the rewards. I don't play the game for getting uber stuff. I play for fun. And uber stuff just comes my way.
---
Logging in today. I've seen just as many camps and vendor Green V's on the map as I do any other day. If people are "leaving en masse" I don't feel it in the game. Just loud proclamations on this sub.
---
I don't feel like it's a chore, because I dumped what steel I had in, got a dozen or so """rewards""", realised it is 100% pointless, and have absolutely no reason to do it again.  It's not a chore if you can just say, "fuck it".
---
I am perfect, thank you. It's good to recognize your betters, Wayne.
---
Nuclear material delivered
---
Reporting isnt gonna do anything. Now workshop explout/glitch has had any repercussions to any user, even the dupe display exploit
---
Not to mention it is literally what they are paid to do! Sorry guys but I just didnt feel like checking the quality of these projectiles today but I expect my check to be there at the end of the week.(I wish the government accepted this answer every week.)
---
Why not both?
---
Gatling gun is my favorite
---
Ok karen

Bethesda, I am very happy to see that you are acknowledging that this is a problem but this needs Hot patched right now. This is a huge issue. The changes have absolutely destroyed camp building and camp builders give you more revenue than any other segment of the Fallout 76 community. This is no just about double sided walls. It is now impossible to make structures with double doors or screen doors. Both of these require that you are able to change a doorway to a regular wall. Not being able to hang walls from ceilings or the bottom of other walls is also a huge limiting factor. You have made building so restricted in this game that it is almost impossible to build anything other than a plain box or a prefab. I am a Fallout 1st member and I have spent a ton on additional Atoms. I have spent several hours building in this game I currently have three camps none of which could even be built now (I spent approximately 40 hours each on these builds). One of my camps was recently featured on a camp building YouTube channel and every build you have ever seen featured on a Youtube channel has used at least one of these techniques. Bethesda revert the camp building changes implemented in Patch 21 NOW. I am seriously close to quitting this game not only does Bethesda refuse to fix real bugs and exploits either in a timely manner or at all but they fix things that were never broken. I find it hard to believe that these changes were needed to address any real issues there is a build budget and as long as you are within the budget double sided walls should not cause performance issues. I understand patches to do away with budget glitches because I realize that over budget camps can cause sever stability issues. Bethesda, please just admit that you made a mistake and revert the camp building changes. If there was a real problem that you were trying to address look at other ways to fix it without destroying our camp building system and further restricting it.
---
are you on PC?
---
You need to pull your head out your ass, ESO no different than FO76, Summit1G just started playing ESO, millions of people are watching this shit show and begging him to quit playing, he has shown over and over again how terrible the servers are and how buggy the game is, its literally a point and fucking click adventure, Elder Scrolls is a First Person RPG, ESO is spitting image of fucking WoW, you telling me that aint cash grab? ESO is ao fsr removed from Elder Scrolls its beyond what Fallout 76 is compared to past Fallout games, ESO is a complete rip off of WOW and if thats your definition of a masterpiece your probably pissed about the lock down and not being able to see the new Star Wars movies in theaters.
---
So from what I can gather from your description you’re doing a bloodied build. If that’s the case, you want to get perks that increase your damage resistances. And probably the most common thing bloodied players do to get their health low is just to get a shit ton of rads. This way your health stays low but due to your perks you will almost never die unless you do something stupid. Hope that helps.
---
No. You can't make me. LOL.
---
Just put 1 in each level of perk for that weapon class. This will raise your bottom line damage, you won't do the "most" damage, but you will be able to use a lot more weapons effectively.
---
My stealth rifleman has max perception, 15. I picked 1 each rifleman and commando, expert and master. This balanced to a total of 6 perk points being used in the PER tree for main weapon damage increase 30% for 2 weapon types. I then have room for tank killer 3, Longshot, grenadier, and other situational damage boosts.... Or lockpick without screwing up my damage. Per/Agi
---
I also have a berserker semi auto/ pipe gun build that is fun as well. Agi/Lck
---
And junkie heavy gunner/shotgunner/crafter. Str/Chr/Int
---
No I don’t want this game to fail either I play it constantly and I have a lot of love for it. I just want shit to work as intended.
---
What level are u
---
Noooooo! HeHe
---
Lol! This event is a scam. I just donated 250 steel to see what the provision box looked like. I don not plan on donating anything else. Remember we will "hit" the milestones regardless of donations.
---
I was kinda over the issues with builds in general. Namely, microcracks between walls and foundations that you could see daylight through and with dark wallpaper looked utterly shit... This is after I abandoned the backwoods camper because it's walls won't allow posters, frames etc anymore to be placed on them which (albeit fixing the windows so people can't jump through them) is still busted after this patch. 
---
Now I run a seedy shed with a garden tile next to it as my whole camp. After this patch I feel like this Spartan lifestyle is the only thing likely to not go down the shitter. 
---
I'd sit and cry in my shed as my nuka cola lamp spins but even that doesn't work properly.
---
what platform are you using?
---
I didn’t know that, thank you!
---
Aye, Fasnacht. Haha.
---
And this seems to be the current developers hopes in my opinion for sure.
---
So I can’t just walk into my C.A.M.P. by switching a wall to a doorway. My camp is a maze and now I have to traverse my own maze to get to my vendor.
---
I really wouldn't bother. the rewards really are shit.
---
It's like this game is some sort of cruel Vault Tek experiment...
---
Have lots of different items so not just weapons and armour. Everyone’s looking for different things. But having plenty of legendary weapons helps.
---
What is happening is your character is aiming in first person, and if you switch camera views you will find your character locked looking down sights, and can hit the ads button to unlock them and switch back.
---
It is annoying how many things are broken in third person the first person mechanics override them.
---
Honestly man if you are into elder Scrolls at all I highly recommend ESO. It's absolutely night and day from this game which is clearly barely on their back burner. Thankfully Zenimaxx runs that not Bethesda.
---
TIL
---
Could have bought something nice with 50k steel tbh 
---
or just sold it in your vendor for a cap a piece
---
Lots would say Gatling Laser, but personally I like the normal Gatling gun
---
And with such confidence too!
---
Guys, this game has been a fucking joke since launch. Why are you still hanging on, thinking things will change?
---
It's quite literally the definition of insanity.
---
They'll have it fixed in 6 months with an update that breaks something else.
---
Sucks. You shoulda stayed and soaking in that free xp
---
Millions would disagree and I'm one of them. Maybe its not what you want. Its exactly what I want and I have no issues with the NA servers so maybe you should lighten up and not be such an asshole.
---
And as someone else pointed out, they’re probably going to just say we reached the goal regardless of the actual outcome to avoid a shitstorm
---
Guys, its so easy to fix things on a cross serve, cross system MMO game. 
---
Or, odds are, bugs are hard to fucking fix. Not sure if you've ever had to go thru 900,000 lines of code for the one mistake before, but it isn't fun or easy.
---
So, they probably have two teams. One that fixes bugs and one that manages new content. Now, id focus my bug team on game breaking bugs like duping, god mode and flying, and leave a glitched quest as a side project.
---
I wonder about that revenue stream. There's a lot Fallout 1st players. I run into stash boxes and that yellow camp armor all the time.  Not to mention camps filled with Atom shop items. Their probably doing all right.
---
Gotta wait for the next patch pal.
---
bruh if you let stuff like this bother you, you are playing the wrong game.
---
Dont bother reporting, bethesda has like 8000000 reports, they dont do shit.
---
Fucking test what?  If they did it on purpose there's nothing to test and bethesda has already come out to say there WAS a reason for them to remove it.
---
There was a bug.  That bug was allowing people to stack walls to make double sided walls.  That but was ALSO allowing people to continue stacking walls and continue stacking walls and continue stacking walls and continue stacking walls and continue stacking walls and continue stacking walls and lag the server and trigger exploits.  They got rid of the bug.
---
&gt; "ESO is a masterpiece compared to this"
---
Learn to read dipshit.
---
Yeah the % seems about right I've gotten two already (knight and knight captain?) in less than 30-40 and God it's so easy to do as a quest. I play games speed clearing the cabin and surrounds, using inappropriate weaponry.... Anything to spice up a glorified postage run.
---
gat and 50 for ease of ammo, gat plasma is awesome, and LMG if you want to have a weapon you can only use for 14 seconds a day.
---
Yup! And they take weeks to fix other "issues" barely anyone cares about!
---
Thanks for the criticism!
---
Yes keep checking back every 15 min or so. It’s one of a dozen possible spawn scenarios.
---
75 million in the first day. I guess it's not going to be all that hard to complete.
---
Tired of these posts of ass hurt jerks that scream cheater when there was no cheating involved in getting the ammo factory.
---
- Gatling Gun for normal encounters and if you want to conserve ammo
---
- Final Word and Ultracite Gatling Laser for Scorchbeast Queen
---
Yeah, there's actually website for the game. Lots of information there. Pretty handy.
---
Lost my cookies on this comment. Hilarious!!! Sending you a thousand "likes" if I could...
---
I love how any obvious bug that gets fixed that people actually liked is called a nerf.
---
I've been using the 50 cal but I only have a level 25, you know any ways of getting a better one?
---
I left a month into wastelanders..right around the time I couldn't use the displays anymore.. super bummed about the fact that they just couldn't listen..
---
 I'm not sure you understand what fascism is.
---
Any recommendations?
---
Just curious.  It sounds like you're looking at the Effects tab in the pip boy to see the change from -4 to -1.  Does your agility actually go up 3 points under the SPECIAL tab too?
---
"Sometimes" say the people directly benefitting with more technological wonders created the last 150 years than the 10,000 before thanks to capitalist industry.........
---
Buttressed is the best armor upgrade 'mod'
---
Jetpack torso + cushioned legs is a great combo for unmatched mobility in regular armor, and now with *reduced fall damage*
---
Fuck arm mods, all my homies hate arm mods
---
And LOL I can't let this one slide. You say "cross system" like no other game is and that Bethesda is taking on a monumental task. Nah. They wanted this live service game, so they should have been prepared. :)
---
I'm hoping all these Karens leave their negativity at their CAMPS. Chally and I do not need that bullshit while we celebrate Meat Week.
---
Get to level 50, buy from player vendors (I see 2+ final words a day, great starter 50)or get lucky at the perverts.
---
Bolstering gives you the best overall damage resistence.
---
What mods did you use on previous armor?
---
I was using lead lined at some point before using SS armor. So "best" is what you like to use.
---
The magic effect can only be felt and can’t be told in the number of damage right?
---
Thankyou sir, i tried googling it but could only find the patch notes.
---
You guys are so brave.
---
Steam or BL? Sorry about all the questions but I am trying to see if its a steam  / xbox  problem
---
Correct.  Do you know about the super mutant behemoth southwest of Solomons pond?
---
Ok if anyone else has this problem I managed to find a solution that worked for me. I made a new character and then went back and tried to load what I was doing before and it worked. idk about this game....
---
I've gotten used to it tbh and kinda enjoy it now. Sucks juggling perks, but there is builds. Builds around bloodied, junkies, bloodied junkie hyrbid, Instagating, etc. There isn't many builds you can expand on but they are there. I'm hoping the perk loadouts change things up some
---
I can’t image devoting precious camp budget to this item that generates virtually nothing in return. A water pump is a better value, as you could get more dirty water quickly for minimal additional complications. Few rads? Whoopie.
---
I'd like good damage resistance overall somethin tanky
---
yeah that needs to stop then.
---
I don’t why these people feel the need to make long confession posts akin to a Youtube apology. This isn’t Facebook. If you’re bored/disappointed/unsatisfied/Bethesda killed your dog/etc. just go play a different game for a while.
---
I found him last night at the workshop attacking ghouls.
---
I got a 3\* Star Junkie's 50 cal drop last night and seriously considered trying it out.
---
Then I realised it was only a level 35 and died a little inside, so the Final Word remains in pole position.
---
I lost about 10 pounds of shotgun ammo because of the converter. and I still have 6000 rounds in my inventory
---
*sometimes.*
---
I wasn't using mods and the files weren't read only, but I did manage to find a fix. I posted it below.
---
Take a break. Hell, I just learned there’s an update. This game isn’t my life nor should it be. I have other aspects of real life that steal me away from the game. Then, I go back.
---
So the only way to test it out is to solo SBQ right?😂
---
What platform? Seems the performance is the same on PS4 pro. Did experience a huge lag after Line in the Sand though.
---
Final word is a great gun until you get a god roll.
---
It’s in the game just not enabled. Sucks tbh I really want the wc skin rug.
---
I'm playing no man sky, re2,3. Dead by day light is fun
---
Explore homes
---
I understand, running from the Bethesda client.
---
Hm, I'm gonna have to redownload and see what I can mess around with. Thanks for the help man. I really wanna enjoy the game, cause the story and lore is always very deep. But like, I'm one of the few who didn't like Skyrim too much. I hope I can get back into it
---
Yes because honestly they don't care. If they did this would never have been done.
---
Atlas
---
XBox gamer here -- you know, one of the biggest single group of players around?  So I just have to ask, "What Public Test Server"?"
---
/Sarcasm off
---
Yeah, I noticed that with my commando build. The first 3 shots will hit then I'll be firing 'blanks' at her for the next 22 rounds. The only work around I have found for this is releasing, and repressing the trigger. I still end up missing a couple shots, but I shouldn't have had to figure it out. It doesn't just work Todd!
---
Yup. Same exact link
---
If i had sub i would cancel it too. I play the game for about 2 months (plus 1,5 month before wastelanders) and i had the desire to add sub so many times just for the scrap box. In every mmo game that i have play i always add a vip sub just to support the game but in this one it doesnt worth it. 
---
It just unlock features that the game should had it by itself for free..
---
If they don't add dungeons, new map, new story something new to explore and see. Then i don't add any sub.. 
---
I have spent so much time to take many items with gold bullion (full set of ss and mods) but for what? There is no real end game content here.. no expansions.. no real threat.. 
---
The game has so much potential and bethesda ruin it... SHAME OF YOU!
---
It wouldn't bother me if two guys didnt use this exploit to take up my camp budget. Now I'm forever lost 2% bc they places those without my knowledge.
---
Here’s the thing: the dead Appalachian chapter and the Enclave that existed before the vault 76 dwellers met Modus may have had little to no interaction, but the incoming BoS group will definitely notice a group that is: a) building &amp; reprogramming military grade robots to conduct patrols around Appalachia, b) dropping supplies from orbit, but more importantly, c) conducting (nuclear?) bombardments from orbit, as a potential threat, given their doctrine in regards to pre-war technology and its potential misuse.
---
*FO76* is embarrassing. 
---
Accepting unfinished games just means they're going to keep doing this forever.
---
Yes scrap box, but paying a monthly fee to store scrap just doesn't seem right.  I'd much rather see a one time purchase of a scrap box.  I couldn't care less about the rest of the 1st bonuses, but you should not have to pay each month to be able to store more scrap.
---
I got 40 boxes yesterday. Can confirm all trash
---
Sacrilege.... Even though I too am swimming in them don't be surprised if someone who *looks* like me is following you around sifting through your trash bags...
---
Occasionally I have trouble getting into first. Usually have to reboot my system to work. Always seems to happen after an update.
---
yes I did it. Removed and refitted. it does not help. I have already reported it because I have had a ticket open for over a week because of errors in the cards. no idea why it got me but in normal game (not on a PTS) I can always see the new legendary cards and the corresponding currency in Pipboy to buy them.
---
I had tonne of lag and stutter out of no-where a while back, still dont know what the issue was but disabling grass worked for me :/
---
No one's asking you to care clown.
---
I agree with this. It took almost two years to fix an "exploit?" I know where this is going guys and gals and I want you to think about this for a second. They removed it so our camps are boring and generic but have you noticed the uptick in prefabs???? Thats where they want it now. To pay for cool camps.
---
That's why I just tell the low levels whenever I'm on a team with them that I'll take them into a private server. Like kids on Christmas.
---
One of the mostly poorly optimized settings on PC is "shadow distance". Set it to low or medium to get a lot more frames with negligable impact to visual quality. 👍
---
good to know thanks.
---
Hey you noticed. But obviously you want someone to care or you would not have posted.
---
Buddy of mine has 40 ammo machines in an underground base...he just handed me 100K in .50 cals....Im not complaining
---
We could always get super lucky and have a Final Fantasy XIV situation. Yoshi-P spent sometime trying to use the old system until he realized it just wouldn’t work and crashed the moon into the planet. Maybe the same can still happen here?
---
I stopped reading after “wE aRe LoOkInG iNtO wAyS tO fIx OuR MiStAkEs PlEaSe DoNt CaNcEl YoUr FaLlOuT fIrSt mEmBeRsHiPs.” Lemme guess, your gonna fix it in patch 22 and then realize you forgot and fix it in patch 23
---
Can you imagine the backlash if they did this?????? Whew boy!
---
Same here... ps4
---
Can i ask why everyone is getting so mad? Isn't it just two sided walls? I'm so confused.
---
Was just a joke by the way.
---
Hi friend! Yes I have recently returned to the game and before hand the game ran fine. Went through the wastelanders DLC with no issues but now I have came back to the game it is running like absolute garbage again like when I first got it. I just don’t understand how to fix it lol...
---
Interesting. I kinda already miss the old way of completing the quest. Sad face gamer emote!?
---
The silencer isn't skinned correctly on it. It looks stretched like it's about to enter hyperspace.
---
The problem is making a story that works with multiple random characters without it being weird
---
It’s original plan was to confetti bomb your photo but its supply was NULL
---
Yeah the drop pool was a watered down version of the Xmas gifts. I only did it to see what the "package" looked like.
---
Since there isn't a live, auto-updated every hour, bar I don't believe a word from Beth.
---
Photo mode glitch through the door maybe?
---
I know I do. I'm not sure anyone who passively accepts BOS in this game does.
---
Yeah, bethesda. And since they responded in a thread earlier today it shows they're reading these posts. But yeah def not you.
---
I didnt think of doing that, I just uninstaller it and reinstalled it &amp; it works
---
Hello! Yes I have already tried this and I have shadow distance at low and the game still gets every minute or so a massive fps drop. I can’t quite understand what the problem is. Maybe a new update?
---
If i can i usually check the grove during scorched earth. 3 times i've found the wendigo and brought it out to meet the queen. Makes for a pretty epic moment

I had this problem last night after line in the sand and uranium fever. Looting meat piles was impossible.
---
Every mod titled aligned, reflex dot sight, quick magazine.
---
Never tried Elder Scrolls at all.  I'll look into it.   Thanks.
---
I'm already switching to another characters play through to see if its just bugged for this instance... Will let you know if that works....
---
Sorry mate but neither do I, welcome back to the wonderful world of fallout 76.
---
All I can say is just to trail and error changing settings and the ini settings to see if anything just clicks
---
Right.  I use the behemoth I was talking about.  Are you familiar?
---
Correct again I didnt read it. Are you a psychic? A wizard? Like I said joking. You guys get bent quick. Relax man this isnt a serious matter.
---
They have bad stash box management and therefore carry a lot of scrap with pack rat equipped?
---
I find that I receive them more often when I turn in more than once during play. So find locations with multiple tech data then start turning in. I finally got the elder paint. Only took my 400 levels!  Lol
---
Sorry to see you go. Your camp is great btw. 76 is an ok game. Kills time. Starfield is the only thing I am looking forward too from Bethesda atm and if it is full of suck then I am over their games.
---
The damage cap is why the Tesla rifle is so op since it hits so fast it doesn’t get damaged cap
---
Real shame Bethesda hasn’t changed their very old crappy engine! Very frustrating to say the least. Oh well, be seeing you out in the wasteland friend.
---
"I already cancelled my subscription and won't be renewing until actual issues are fixed."
---
its fucking ridiculous that you bought it in the first place
---
I already rock 6 different characters and will continue to test play. I know, I know, I may just be a dumbass with high expectations!
---
While that makes sense from a morality sense, I and probably a good deal of people are still going to want to play even with all the issues. From an impact perspective, I'd recommend everyone still play that way they have to keep the lights on and servers up, but are only sinking money into their electric bills and not seeing returns via their monetization models.
---
But I was listing factions whom do not like each other. What person could possibly dislike people who blow up the cars?! It's like fireworks!
---
Totally agree, listen to feedback.
---
But the way its presented is a joke. I saw one thread along the lines of  **Change this right now or else**
---
I'll have you know I put a lot of effort into my meme
---
Yes, is happening, normaly i play  in ultra (high end grafic) and the temperature oscilates betwin 54-68ºc, 60fps without any drop, yesterday at radiation rumble my grafic card cosplayed of a heater... lowest fps drop i caught was 12 with 86ºc.   
---
No temp problems today, but had some fps issues doing events that imply many piles of meat (LITS, Rumble...)
---
You people still play this?! *Snort*
---
I have a brand new rig with great specs and since the updates I've been losing frames/having serious stuttering too so that's a real possibility.
---
Not in the sense im referring to. You own a copy of the game (which Betheada could ban anytime if they wanted). They own the game in having the ability to make change
---
Darn you helped him, you ruined it
---
targeting a specific piece of an otherwise un-blueprint-able structure so you can make a blueprint and build it else where is an exploit, in this case the very definition and of a cheat.
---
They may no care or do anything about it, but let’s not mince words and pretend it’s normal game play. otherwise we’d be ok to do the same with the super steel extractor from graft on steel or the food processor from sunshine farms
---
Awesome thanks a lot bro.
---
They went to war with the NCR because they decided they owned every piece of advanced technology and tried to strong arm people into surrendering their laser guns and shit. They have a history of just showing up places and deciding they're in charge.
---
"We know better than everyone else" is like a core belief of the Brotherhood of Steel.
---
OMG THANK YOU DirectX saved me.  I was so mad it wasn't running
---
For me personally the new ammo converter was my biggest disappointment in this patch.
---
"See guys, we received your feedback and fixed it :)"
---
Yeeeeeeeee shore gg
---
My biggest turn-off, the bad performance on PC, will probably never fixed. It's just a crappy old Engine, not designed for their vision of a MMO.
---
I will quit after the legendary run and will come back...
---
*but I don't know when... *
---
sigh, it looks like you are correct, the spcial effect are correct but the stats in the effect tab are wrong. Thanks for your help
---
It's a long shot but... are you on a team?
---
I noticed sometimes in the previous patch, I could not enter Vault Tec University or the Overseer's home. Then I realized that when I was not on a public or private team, I was able to enter fine. Tested by joining a team, and when I couldn't enter, left the team and I got in.
---
Not sure if this is related whatsoever but I'm curious.
---
and now we wait another 5 weeks for the next minor fixes that should of been fixed as soon as the issue arrive
---
Excellent work, member
---
The people who *really* like to blow up cars.
---
Also if your graphics drivers are out of date that could be a culprit too 🥴
---
It’s good to know I’m not the only one suffering at the wrath of Bethesda’s horrible game engine! Truly disappointed to say the least on the outcome of this game performance wise!
---
Good to know. Ty Sr.
---
I definitely enjoyed my time massively, personally one of my favourite games I've played in quite a long time. It's why I didn't even bash the devs or go on a rant, as they obviously have a vision for the game that is going a different direction to what I personally want, I can't really fault them.
---
It's just time for me to move on, so thought I would share.
---
Glad you enjoyed the camp 😁
---
I sub to various game specific subs and this "do the devs even play the game" thing goes on in the others too.
---
I personally use just rank 2 and never notice any extreme damage from the SB or SBQ. Maybe I'm not paying attention enough though lol
---
I have a very similar experience. I decided to step away for a while. No Man's sky, and back to Skyrim, which is vastly improved now that Bethesda keeps their hands out if it and lets players mod.
---
Not exactly seeing where they claimed to govern or rule over those individuals. Unlike the NCR who has aggressive expansionistic tendencies and have committed actual genocide, all to throw their citizens into a meat grinder instead of giving them proper equipment like the tech they denied the Brotherhood.
---
😂 brilliant!
---
Honestly I really do want the BoS outfits and Camp items, but I’m not about to grind my ass off for it. Luckily it seems some people out there are carrying the load since the first goal is more than halfway met after one day.
---
Thanks for checking!  I guess it's good that it's only a visual bug, but still frustrating that they manage to break random things with each update.
---
Pretty sure things went south when the BoS started forcibly conscription responders. The Free States were worried they were gonny start doing the same to them and started gearing up for war.
---
I have a similar setup and setting everything to low but the shadow quality actually made it "somewhat" playable. I have shadow quality at ultra, if not the game would look horrible, and for some reason i lag when they are low.
---
This may also help you
---
https://youtu.be/byE4qyx8kwA
---
Not having a limit would make caps worthless.
---
U know as well as I know people only get fallout 1st for the box so no they would not make that a thing unless it cost a lot like 100 plus
---
"Forcibly conscripting", where is your evidence of this? Maria Chavez begs her people to stay with the Responders, implying they were leaving by choice, not force.
---
Its a bug. They acknowledged it. Surprised it wasnt fixed this update...
---
Likely be fixed sometime in the future... and yes that's wide open
---
Faxx
---
Hard yikes. Thanks for letting me know!
---
Anyone who does that should just be perma banned. Trying to lag the entire fucking server? Are you serious? Yeah get rid of these fucking people.
---
Thank you friend, I will get back to you on how your suggestion works for me on my rig. Do you have Texture quality on low too? Thank you for the response! :D
---
Me too, tried a few hours ago, tired again now. Grey out and can't  enter. (PC)
---
Wow. Of course. I’ll just see myself out.
---
It's not unusual...
---
Yeah if a camp designer wants their camp to be a hodgepodge Frankensteinof a creation, with things floating and gaps in their designs everywhere, so be it. The underground exploit is the one I think is unfair
---
The duffel is just cheap vinyl
---
Funny thing, I've done Meat Week, it's okay but not the end of the world - one week of it is plenty, the fact that dangling a second week of it for some kind of reward isn't anything to be worried about missing. And, I don't use any of the Collectrons, because they repeat the same dialog infinitely - I had enough from the Santatron in December to last me a lifetime. 
---
There's more benefit in keeping your steel, making ammo, or whatever else. Besides, you know what, the Scorched Killing Community Event that preceded the release of Wastlanders was far more fun than this. This event directly impacts your gameplay and has you spend time and effort to hand over resources that you need to play the actual game with, and in exchange you get items that are readily availible in the game. If this had been handled differently, I'd probably be defending the event, but after a few times of hearing all of this hype build up, I guess I'm just a bit sick of being disappointed.  If you enjoy disappointment, by all means, enjoy your second, third, fourth, or entire year of Meat Week.
---
Several players have also reported seeing white "chain-chain" X markers showing up as a visual glitch when using a Tesla Rifle and there is corresponding server performance degradation.
---
Not sure who buys steel, Ive tried selling it over the months but got no buyers at that price. With scrapping perk and knowing where to farm for weapons to scrap anyone can make 2k steel in less than an hour. Hell, I can make that in 20 minutes with Line in the Sand and some grenades.
---
I use gun fu and don't have any issues except it not going into vats. I'll hit vats on the controller and nothing. And that's only occasionally.
---
Anytime! Yes, for some reason i get huge stutter when texture quality is set to even medium, so i keep it at low, it doesn't bother me much.
---
I even server jumped 6 times thinking I was going mad lol
---
Same in melee build. I miss the first time most the time, but it does seem to work on crits better.
---
I’m not on a team but I’ll try joining one to see if that changes anything. Thanks for the idea
---
I don’t believe them numbers for a second.
---
Have you ever played with an MMO-RPG where the ingame economy works?
---
something changed with meat piles, they are the reason for those fps drops
---
I play with 4 different characters, for the one, Roxy's quest hasn't triggered in weeks. For the others evening  works.
---
Same.
---
How the fuck can a main quest be broken? Does any of the developers do a play through?
---
I don’t see much a difference between low and ultra when it comes to 76 anyways. The game doesn’t look very ‘next gen’ to me lol...
---
Let’s hope for the best then, thank you. Is there anyway to report a bug directly to Bethesda?
---
Awesome. Thank you!
---
I promise, if you’re looking for bow play like destiny, far cry, skyrim, that is not this. These are SO awful.
---
I’ll give it a shot when I play again. Thanks
---
With no limit, everything will be at the mercy of those who can accumulate unlimited caps.
---
Exactly haha
---
I thought I just hap shit inteenet
---
Oh this i has happened before. And people have worried FO76 isn’t going to last many many times and yet it’s still here.
---
The vast majority of those saying they are quitting aren’t going to. 
---
In two weeks no one will care anymore,
---
This is gunna be the most nuked area on the map. This could really backfire on Bethesda. Is there any chance that community entirety wants to even meet these goals?
---
It is. Nothing to buy lol
---
In your opinion how many active players are there across all platforms?
---
I've seen nothing from Bethesda that the Tesla was ever going to be nerfed.
---
I think the player base that's remained this long will stick around pretty much no matter what so Idk
---
I don't see removing a limit as giving them value, and with a limit they don't have value.
---
I think no matter what they do it'll have no value.
---
What we really need is an in game auction house or market like most other games of similar style.
---
Why do I need to go hunting on 3rd party playforms to find what I need, why do I have to risk getting scammed to trade items for items.
---
We need in game player to player market.
---
We need a higher limit for caps at a minimum.
---
We can keep vendors just for fun.
---
And as for scrip let me at the least have a note system like bullion... My options should not have to between having mules, dropping stuff I can scrip or log off until things reset. I just want to play.
---
Bethesda games have never worked properly, idk what y'all are talking about.
---
The Brotherhood needs your tribute, civilian.
---
Depends, new players, you can get some good stuff.
---
Veterans, you can get wasted on alcohol.
---
Canceled since it was released (never bought this scam).
---
Elder Scrolls online **economy** works *pretty well*. No primary currency cap. Gifting of premium currency. Lots of gold sinks.
---
Too bad their system to sell sucks fucking ass
---
Lol u do know that the cost to repair most gear would be a lot. At least based off new Vegas prices where it could cost 12k for one repair
---
It’s been an on going bug with events and loading into cells, sometimes the npc just die for no reason. Weirdest thing is when it happens in horde events and by the time you load in you’re just surrounded by corpses with no other player to be found
---
bye
---
I appreciate where you're coming from looking for potential solutions to certain problems, but CAMP building and it's functions should be available to all F76 players.
---
It was a bug being exploited. It was causing problems. Get over it.
---
It's not a joke, just straight negligence. I miss the 200% condition buff. It made the chainsaw........ feel like a chainsaw. 
---
The Chainsaw should be more awesome, you could have put the AutoAxe skin out for it and i would have spent real americans dollars to get that skin.
---
And you're right, the mods don't do shit, just glorified skins. The only mod that actually functions is Flamer, which isn't counted for Friendly Fire.It's extra weak since it got omitted from weapon perk card boost. Adrenaline and Bloody mess are the only cards that work for it. 
---
And it's even more of a slap in the face to us since it's found in a few of the blood eagles camps as well as the usual spawn spots.
---
And the Bull Barrel mod....... is just another kick in the balls to players. Seriously, change it. Remove that image from the atomic shop so we can stop getting our hopes up
---
No come back I wasn’t trying to make fun
---
not wrong
---
the limit is what has made caps worthless, and forced high end trading off to 3rd parties.
---
That why I said just move on,it's not like there only one workshop
---
Personally, caps only mean two things to me:
---
1) Allows me to purchase recall cards
---
2) Allows my to purchase 300 gold each week
---
wow. the bos on fallout 4 are the worst of all.
---
I'm pretty sure that Bethesda does have to apply to Microsoft and Sony for an update but to how much it takes for them to approve, I have no idea
---
I used to be a game tester. May take a few days. But it still depends on what the manager wants. Like how long should we test it. I am not really sure about the programmer's part.
---
Scarcity is what drives value....economics 101
---
67 or 68
---
No problem! It can definitely be a bit confusing but for the most part I find it pretty easy to get the hang of. I also have a long MMO background though, which helps. If you have more questions feel free to ask, I'm no meta expert but I've been playing since the beta so I have a lot of game knowledge lol
---
This probably was easier to fix
---
They could have just made an ammo scrip machine:
---
* Open converter
---
* Displays a Shop window, where the currency is AmmoPoints
---
* Each piece of ammo has a fractional AmmoPoint value
---
* Buy/Sell for fractional ammo points
---
In an MMO-RPG where the ingame economy in healty grinding is a normal thing, people who grinding mutch are richest, I don't understand your problem
---
To clarify, the bug reports I'm talking about are to the calls people are making on this subreddit stating that the "fix" they made to walls is a bug. This was a decision someone with an unknown amount of authority made, and thus submitting a bug to undo this "fix" will probably be read by someone NOT in a position to revert this change.
---
Describing the issues with targeting/shooting, in a multiplayer game, to a non programmer is tough. 
---
Think about trying to play Chess with a friend, over the phone, on a bad connection, and only your friend has an actual chess set.  Now imagine that to make a move, you have to tell him how to move a claw-machine game, like at arcades, to pick up a piece and move it.  Now pretend the chess board is rotating on a lazy susan, so your friend continuously tells you where each piece is, as you try to tell the claw how to move, over a bad phone line.  That's what targeting looks like to a game.  
---
It's tough to nail down, but it has been figured out.  There's lots of programmers who know how to do this and make it work.   I get the impression that they don't work at Bethesda studios though.
---
Thanks for the responses everyone. I never thought ammo would draw people in but I'll give that a go! 😊
---
Mate my hotel camp is right there could you not 😂😂
---
I was excited for bos but not anymore. Fuck this shit, I'm not wasting my time giving them steel.
---
No mans sky is a GREAT exploration game with new updates still coming in
---
Yes I used to test weapons on the behemoth, but I found that it’s really hard to see the difference because I could shred it with every weapon😂
---
Indeed not, nor will Atoms transfer.
---
I Don't as well and given the horrible rewards of provision after the first 2500 steel I gave I won't be giving a drop for any of the other goals. No one I know as well plan on donating a drop anymore as well.
---
The other reason I don't believe the numbers is because the lore is this is to set up the BOS base... like what happens if we don't make goal? They cancel the BOS update? They have a bad base?
---
I doubt the put all the effort into whatever they have planned for us to fail and them also have an alternative fleshed out.
---
Its going to maybe be close on some goals but I think they will just say we made it each time.
---
Where do I get the bloodied stuff like armor and the perks are¿ Ik theirs 2 for luck and I think 1 for intelligent but idk which perk card it is
---
I looked at the guage this morning and its already past half way. I have a lot of doubt thats come from players. I only donated enough steel to get 6 provision packages (still have more steel than ill probably use so won't miss it) and all i got out of it was plans I already knew and a bunch of worthless alcohol I ended up offloading for pennies at a vendor since i dont use it. 
---
I am so beyond underwhelmed by the whole thing. Even the way its set up in game is lacklustre and not even remotely inspiring to participate. Im not wasting any more time or resources on it outside a single 250 donation of each. And the only reason Im even bothering with that is for my own peace of mind so I dont feel like a "freeloader". I highly doubt our contributions are going to matter because at this point Im 90% certain its going to complete regardless of what we contribute
---
Did you actually try it or scrip it already?  I have been stuck with a level 35 bloodied 50 cal for ages waiting for a better one to drop and the thing still does fantastic.  I got the final word, compared it to the level 35 and then scripped it.  Max level or not the level 35 outperformed it by miles.
---
Which makes the Gauss shotgun and pistol boat anchors.   No way I’m grinding rep on my alts; not worth it.   .
---
I haven’t played WoW in a few years, but the cost of goods would always increase dramatically, especially when new DLC was released and quests gave out better rewards. Why sell Copper ore for silver when people will spend 10 g for it
---
Everquest is worse now, things are sold for multiple platinum at this point. Common low level items for alts are priced so far out that no new player could ever afford it.
---
Caps aren’t necessarily a bad thing, especially with the lack of a cap sink in this game, and with the months of duping that brought us mounted head plan-acolypse
---
but....they aren't in appalachia yet....they are still otw
---
My problem is that you don’t understand economic theory.
---
Without scarcity, there is no value.
---
Even before the new patch I lost my 5k steel I don't know why.
---
DO.  NOT.  SELL.  FIXES.  FOR.  REAL.  MONEY.
---
...no, but YOURS had the person who owned it inside the perimiter that allows pvp. why claim a workshop and hope someone walks by when you can go pvp the sure thing?
---
again, the game tells you that workshops are pvp zones. you agree to this when you start the claiming process. if someone kills you while in a workshop zone, that is by design and you have no right to be mad about it. don't like it? dont claim workshops.
---
i dont even like the pvp in this game but im at least aware enough of the rules to not be mad when something i agree to happens.
---
Ok. You want a bloodied build?
---
Then they act like their opinions matter when they downvote you to shit. What a bunch of losers..
---
About all it means for me at this point.
---
That and vendor hoping once every day to look for stuff to buy so I don't hit max.
---
That people still play this game is embarrassing
---
Lol there are people who still play this game? Wow.
---
Welcome to every patch since day one
---
If you look at the main part of the machine. It looks like it was intended to be that way. 
---
With a button pad on the side and a turbine to drop bullets into. And a dispenser near the bottom for new bullets
---
Yes, we seriously need an auction function in the game, another question, what you think, what is the ideal cap limit for the actual game with the actual endgame items?
---
Cant use the tent anymore and you cant add to the stash box but youll keep whats in the stash box.
---
Honestly wondering if they are trying to get the game to die so they can put money elsewhere.
---
Never use private teams with strangers.
---

---
That’s what I run. Radiate yourself to 19% health.
---
See I’m in it for the long haul, I don’t care about the supply crates for donating, why you might ask? Because I can give them to a lower level who has nothing yet or even better yet I can take the items and place them in my vendor for low prices so people can have them. I have a FO1st membership, not getting rid of it any time soon, and probably get 1,000 or more steel every day so I have no problem donating it.
---
All this patch has done has made everyone mad, not a single good thing from it
---
I didn't think so, but it's been so long.
---
Check the bottom to answer your scrapbox question.  [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/fallout1st](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/fallout1st)
---
That sounds good but people would just spam the same bugs or what they don’t like about the game and nothing would get done
---
They have been saying the same about WoW for years too. People still don’t realize they are a vocal minority. I could care less about a double wall what ever. Bethesda knows that this thing will drive off .000001% but if it provides stability for 99.99999% of players then it’s a net gain.
---
Wish the 5% miss proc was as gratuitious as other low chance procs. Or maybe a perk card in perception that grants 100% vats accuracy.... Nah maybe small spikes in server lag account for the skips in vats? I have a feeling the vats wont ever truly be fixable. It's about as common as your character clipping through parts of the graphics, and that's practically ineliminable from the game as well, no?
---
Adorable that you think it'll even make it to patch 32... ;(
---
I donated 20k... Got about 400 pounds of nothing.
---
I would check if some of your dailies didn’t autocomplete
---
Good heads up.
---
Can add to the collection of useless water items with the water well
---
Pretty sure they aren’t paid to get shat on by the community. All they do 24/7 is get tagged in reddit posts and have to read never ending hate because everyone refuses to see them as human beings just trying to survive like everyone else. I get that Bethesda is terrible at communicating, but u/valseek and the others aren’t in charge of that. They probably know just as much as we do about what is going on with the game. All they really do is reach out to the developmental/technical team on our behalf.
---
That is what I’m sorry for, for dragging them into this along with all the other community managers. Originally it was said in jest, but upon seeing these replies I feel an explanation was warranted because you guys obviously don’t get it.
---
and where are the IRL caps then, if they are rooted in economic theory? they arent there because price ceilings dont fuckin work. 
---
the cap isnt there for economics, its there to increase grind. they want you to have to go out and earn enough caps to pay for things like serum plans. wouldnt have to grind if you could just use 500k from an alt.
---
30k isnt enough as a unit of account to differentiate value of high end and BiS gear, so people switched to different stores of value, making caps far less valuable.
---
Why? Because I acknowledge that Aqua makes good architecture type camps?
---
I noticed it both before and after the update, but it doesn't always happen.  Sometimes it is responsive AF, sometimes it's like the cursor is stuck in molasses.  Happens both in game, and at the main menu.  Can't figure it out.
---
Now this is the quality content I come here for.
---
Great photo.
---
I don’t understand what part of them thought that they should waste time fixing a “glitch” in camp building that actually makes camps so much better, when they could have fixed the colossal problem event instead of delaying it with NO WARNING for the second time
---
Does every pellet inflict double damage on full health enemy?
---
Any questions?
---
Yeah, I am a little. Thank you for sharing more details. Also, I easily admit I would love to see the humanity protecting ideal be Brotherhood of Steel Knights and Engineers making new science from old science.
---
I want positive, weird, and quirky with a sense of honor. I like the idea of the divide in methods of Patriotism that segregate the Enclave and the Brotherhood of Steel. I even like both being options which are not exclusive from each other.
---
Shit man, Bing on the Synths too!
---
Bye
---
Pikachu face.
---
Honestly, as someone whose entire build revolves around roleplaying a drunken demolitionist, those rewards sound kinda good. Though the roi on that amount of steel is pretty low.
---
I was relieved tbh, the thought of having to un /equip every time was not something I was looking forward to
---
This has just happened to me, the whole Defiance quest line including Back to Basic, Defiance has fallen, Recruitment Blues has disappeared from my Data Quest list, I had already completed all of it, I can no longer access the top floor of Fort Defiance. It's all just vanished.
---
Hope this resets some time. Must be something to do with this last patch.
---
Yeah, they also didnt say anything about nerfing 25% less vats cost, but they did. Its already changed in the PTS. They just messed something up while implementing it in patch 21.
---
You may want to give it a day, I’ve heard a number of instances are having these issues intermittently. You may get it work later, or if it’s really really broken (I’ve tried 20 times), Bethesda May lush an emergency patch.
---
Genuinely curious - how do double walls impact stability? They still take up budget space...I'm confused.
---
Same. Would work occasionally though.
---
I usually have this problem after Line in the Sand, but only after I have already looted about 30 meat piles. I can't imagine how bad it would be now.
---
Thank you, I'm glad you liked it. That was exactly my goal, wanted it to be dark/scary/ run down looking and try to fit in with the area. It's why I didn't have many lights though the build as I felt it spoilt the aesthetic
---
I was so confused when I started playing and then I noticed I wasn't gaining my health back. Such sadness.
---
I had that happen to me last night. I was PvPing someone who was using a tesla and after I killed them the chain words popped up on the ground
---
Unfortunately for them I cancelled this morning sooo
---
Again, the Brotherhood went to war because they decided they deserved other people's property. That they should be in control of how other people use technology. 
---
And if you think the Brotherhood's not aggressive expansionists who have committed actual genocide then I don't know what to tell you, you must have missed the parts where they show up uninvited and start murdering ghouls, supermutants, and synths where ever they go.
---
the game feels more like a mobile game with the constant need to sign in daily to progress and timers on everything, all focus being on atom shop items ect.
---
Also worth noting that the promised “upcoming” features for 1st have not appeared, and have not been mentioned since 1st was announced, including: increased camp budget and radius, workshop persistence on private worlds, and mod support. Not a peep.
---
I had paid for the year sub as it was cheaper in the long run. I’ve since since cancelled the renewal on that, and will definitely not be renewing if those features fail to appear by the year anniversary of 1st.
---
Hah, I asked a similar question recently ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i0p80q/why_does_a_bass_line_play_for_notifications_when/)). It's happening any time you get a message in the upper left - both the text ones ("you're overencumbered" and the boxes ("Hey, there's an event happening"). In my experience, it starts happening after switching from Nuclear Winter to Adventure, although others have said it happens without even doing that. I've been told it can be fixed by hopping servers, but if that doesn't do it you'll need to exit/relaunch.
---
*Throws over-ripe tato at bullshit vague excuse non-apology post.*
---
Why not both? The engine is dated IMO
---
This is one of the most ridiculous theories anybody could possibly have about anything
---
Errrrr.... now instead of grinding lead, acid and cloth, you're grinding aluminum, adhesive (or corn/tater/mutfruit/purified water), and plastic.  I'm not seeing the benefit here, it's not like those resources are in far more abundance than lead and acid are...
---
No clue why you're being downvoted. I'm sorely tempted to just pay for the rest (I'm at level 70 or so on the board) and the building nerf has drained every last desire I have to play for now.
---
It seems like your reasons for not wanting to play are because Bethesda gave us a mechanism to get rid of junk in our Junkboxes and the loot you get is a re-skinned Holiday Gift and that they fixed a bug that wasn’t supposed to be there in the first place? And this is making the game unplayable?
---
Dude, you’re getting caps, plans, stimpaks, and booze for Steel Scrap. The double wallpaper glitch wasn’t supposed to work like that. 
---
Give some lowbie your legendaries before you leave.
---
Yes really! 
---
The new designs some People made with outside wallpaper look Amazing. Just let us do that if we want!
---
I got a refund on my Xbox fo1st but I was probably only 2-3 weeks in the first month. Steam however gives no refund option.
---
All this horrific press and they just keep doubling down on their ignorance and buffoonery. Yet have the nerve to tell people "dont worry 76 is great now after wastelanders" this company is reaching EA levels of stupidity mixed with sticking their heads in the sand.
---
Yeah, guess he really didn’t like my setup
---
Preaching to the choir brother, game needs a major overhaul not just Atomic Shop pacifiers. Actually got down votes yesterday for discussing my boredom on here🙄
---
Wow my base is now special because theres more than one wall per floor!!!
---
This is just beyond stupid.
---
You wont
---
Had the same happen. When i relogged again to see if that would fix it, the ones that I missed where autocompleted. Hope you have more luck, but you prob got hit by the famous bug
---
Probably also trying to weed duped junk out of the world as well
---
I don't even think reed richards could stretch this far.
---
I think it's full bugged, I've heard people are having the issue across all platforms. Do you know if there's anything I'll miss aside from rep grind if I just side with the settlers now? I'm getting bored lol.
---
This has happened to me a couple of times at Watoga where the robots would emerge from their pods already dead.  Weird.
---
That first paragraph is easily interchanged with the NCR and would still be 100% accurate.
---
And if you think killing feral ghouls and super mutants is murder, then please, by all means. Go tell them you feel their pain as you're ripped to shreds, have you really played this game and still have such a naive belief in your head?
---
Fatman is scrip almost always for any level.
---
But all the sweet xp you could want
---
Judging by the failures after failures of this team I’d say they’re understaffed and inexperienced(lord have mercy if they’re not). Add that to a large amount of copies they sold at release,atom shop, fo1st and now game pass , I’d say they are making a good profit
---
Meh I quit, Bethesda are just bad at this right will see in a year or so maybe more
---
I love this game
---
Leave it too the damn brotherhood if you dont donate they take it
---
I like to camp near seasonal high foot traffic areas. Plan ahead. Meat week is coming up. If it’s in the same location as last year which it probably will be, there’s a great spot right behind the event. You’ll get a TON of traffic all throughout that event, like unusually high. 
---
Also with this current community event, setting up near atlas observatory might be a great idea. I just find camping in spots players are likely to visit anyway gets people in the door as opposed to camps being in rarely traveled to locations.
---
Oh that’s my favorite one! You stand out front of a pod waiting just to see a protectron hunch over and fall out of it.
---
Well just you wait!!! Grahms BBQ is way more challenging!  
---
Lol.  At least the events leading up to it have some actual enemies you can fight though.
---
No sweet clue.
---
Personally I don't care if it's limitless. But considering the ways to legitimately earn/generate caps in game is only in the thousands per day at most (not counting trading with others) I'd be careful of going too high because you'd have inflated prices causal may struggle to reach. Other games address this by just having the player base lean on its auction house and regulates itself.
---
Maybe just make the cap pool account bound and not character bound and have it at 150k or maybe a little boost to 200k-250k
---
Just let me access my caps no matter If I'm on my main or alt.
---
What part Should I put buttressed on ??
---
ah yes, genuinly trying to help the vault dweller from vault 13, by sending them on a suicide mission with the complete intent that they would die and not come back.
---
Does this patch fix all of the underground camps I see everywhere?
---
Oh look, another post about this. 🤦
---
I used wall glitches for other things than double walls.
---
* Hiding electrical wiring and conduits.
---
* Covering my foundation blocks with much more attractive fascia (general brick style wallpaper)
---
So this change has ruined the one aspect of the game that is compelling since I \*LOVE\* building and rebuilding CAMPs. I can't even consider touching mine since I have a buried fusion generator (99% inside foundations), walls that go to the ground (covering foundations) and hidden wiring. Anything I touch could potentially break and be irreplacable now
---
All due to some very fishy looking claims of an exploit.
---
Thanks Bethesda. You're saving me the headache of playing this sinking ship AND the cost of FO1st. If you ever get your shit in order, I'll give it another shot.
---
Speaking of MMOs, I'm going back to a real one. Shadowlands (WoW) is looking rather promising, at least compared to the current RNGtastic mess. And it has actual content and at least some level of respect for my time.
---
had a cat in the vault and a deathclaw at my camp lol
---
Ok that was always allowed. But you’ve also already made the choice to come back.
---
Soooooo.... If I save this post, and a few months from now Bethesda releases a patch that adds double-sided interior walls at no cost, retroactively adding them to all wall styles you might already own, what exactly am I allowed to say to you about how much I think you are a crack-pot conspiracy addict?
---
Turn-about is fair play - at that point, when the issue is actually settled, I give you the right to call me anything you want and I'll take it like a gentleman.   I just want to set the ground rules.....
---
I had logged on to a public server because we always have to buy/sell 3 things (which was missing from my list); when I logged onto my private server just a minute ago my list was back to 9, and buy/sell and gold star were autocompleted. Fucking joy. And this a day after camps got screwed over.
---
You magnificent bastard!
---
Everyone??
---
How can you see one and not?
---
Where’s the 500k on the alt coming from of your not grinding?
---
"They're mean and kill things that can kill me in a heartbeat, clearly they're facists".
---
Ultralight&gt; deep pocket because less ap drain and about the same who cares about 2lbs
---
I've had a drop in FPS since the update even without meat piles. Just running around in the wilderness has me down to 20 (used to be 40-60), and events are unplayable (1-10 FPS).
---
they are all in one place.. its usually my goto if for some reason Im looking for something at a vendor
---
It's like a very big maybe and def not doing fo1st
---
You're not wrong.  Have fun hunting the sbq then

Same fer me xbox
---
So since im playing play station i cant criticism capitalism? Is Capitalism perfect?And There is no one true capitalism going on.
---
New feature, anti-grav backpacks!
---
Exactly why I stopped playing when I had been playing for ages. The hype of having settlers and raiders update was a huge flop and sorely lacking.
---
All these "camp builders" from the camp building "community"....
---
Are all conspiracy theory raging because their boring generic house no longer can be built with inner walls, as if those walls don't make their camp any less boring than the 18373 other generic houses.
---
My suggestion would be to trade them for scrip so you can get legendaries at your level.  Better to have something you can use immediately...
---
Quick edit: the only exception would be highly-desired legendary effects like Bloodied, Instigating, Junkies, Furious, or 2-shot. You could make some good caps selling them in your vending machine, if you didn’t want to hold onto them for later use.  fed76.info has a nice pricing tool so you can check if something is valuable.
---
Yes, I wandered about this possibly as well.
---
That’s how much I donated. A ton of stimpacks, radaways, alcohols and plans I already knew.
---
&gt; They probably know just as much as we do about what is going on with the game
---
Community managers should be more transparent and open with the community.  It creates a better experience for everyone involved.  It really doesn't matter if they know or don't.  Bethesda is dropping the ball either way.
---
Dude, literally all I was claiming is that there's not "zero benefit" for the ATLAS challenge. You being disappointed by the rewards does not mean they don't exist. My feelings on the event as a whole range from not-giving-a-shit neutral to disappointed, but I do like collecting collectrons, so there's that.
---
Meat Week happened before I picked up this game so I haven't experienced it yet, but I'm capable of being happy for the people that seem pleased by it. Shockingly, the community rewards reward the *community* and I'm glad to see people get stuff they enjoy-- from what I've seen, it runs alongside Fasnacht as a fan-favorite, and I'm sure I won't pass up the opportunity to run it a few more times myself.
---
Issues with Class Freak do not seem to be only visual. I've seen a bug on Angry Turtles stream a few minutes ago. He had the problem that his Intelligence was lower with Class Freak equipped than it was without having it equipped.
---
Oh take a chill pill.
---
Maybe as a community we should all completely ignore the event as a sign of protest?
---
Seriously, they would just come and take it.
---
It’s summer ! Enjoy the weather while we have it, wait for cyberpunk and pick up something old you already have for another playthrough during downtime (what I’m doing anyway)
---
And if you have a pc , Beth was giving away free downloads of fo1+2 ( idk if this is still the case,it was around Christmas time). If you’ve never played them , I highly recommend them . Gameplays not for everyone but the writing was superb
---
use this site  [https://fed76.info/pricing/](https://fed76.info/pricing/)  stick in the details of the weapon and it will give you an indication if you should scrip or keep them. I am gonna guess they gave you stuff that was heavy and not valuable but you never know. There might be a gem in there.
---
Use to be a glitch where you could stack walls until the sever crashed so I'd say it does mess with stability
---
Ummmmm....ever hear of inflation?
---
Sorry, but I’ll put a degree in economics against your opinion.
---
Maybe take off heavy gunner perks?  Everything would do way less damage then its supposed to, but you could still compare between weapons.
---
My first tip, stay drunk while playing. 🤷
---
Bloodied exploding plasma gat....good luck
---
Can somebody list the 9 because after playing an hr or so earlier I think mine may have autocompleted...
---
Sounds like a trap!!
---
I wasn't having too many problems with Vats before but since the patch I'm missing point blank 95% vats shots 5 or 6 times in a row. -_-
---
Get drunk and lose it!
---
I'd rather have a rad barrel plan and/or emmett mountain hazmat suit. I can get better xp elsewhere.
---
Maybe if the rewards were good
---
It's not meant as a full on replacement, but rather a means to lighten the grind of acid, lead, steel, etc. These quantities make 32,000 rounds, which should be more than enough rounds to organically gather enough materials to craft the desired ammo without a grind, as well as arrows for conversion.
---
I’ve saved the post as well.
---
It’s always fun to watch the doomsayers turn oddly quiet when their predictions fall flat.
---
Its a little early but if I start the game now Im sure itll be time to drink by the first crash lol
---
Delete it LOL
---
This is my first (and possibly) last break. I've played since BETA and endured so much bipolar quality that I'm done for now.
---
FO1st cancelled.
---
Legacy CAMP will sit where it is since I can't risk even doing minor changes now (I relied on the wall/door swap to do fun things like hide electrical and extend walls over foundations for a cleaner look).
---
Which bugs?
---
It's already been reported and they are looking into it
---
Launch your next one at Atlas.
---
Really though... that is hilarious! lol
---
Oh, good.
---
Ok thanks I’ll check it out
---
I was at a scorched earth event today when after she was killed, I received zero loot.  Nothing on the body, nothing for completion.  It was like I wasn’t even there wasting thousands of bullets and resources lol
---
I turned in 2,000 steel today.  I got 1 plan.  It was not rare.
---
I am done with this event.
---
All parts. Seriously.   Jetpack the torso, cushion the legs (if you don't have perk cards for landing) and wait till Bethesda drops the deep pockets mod for arms.
---
Yep and it weighs 10x a normal outfit. If u put flux into upgrading it, thats all gone too.
---
Of course that's true. They should be restructuring the organization, reducing manpower on the "cosmetic" teams and adding resources to whatever team is supposed to make the game work.
---
WELCOME! Got a copy and paste reply. 
---
Put a few points into luck as early as possible and use pharma farma. You will have more drugs than you need eventually. (Most builds require at least 5 luck anyways so it'll come in handy after 50)
---
Melee as much as possible to save ammo in the early game.
---
Join a public team. Building gives a boost to INT and higher INT gives more xp. You can then fast travel for free to your teammates and their camps. 
---
Junk is used to make everything. When you build a camp try put it near a junk pile and build an extractor on it. And once you have 500 atoms your first purchase should be a collectron. it collects scrap and junk from around your camp.
---
Capture workshops. They give XP, loot and caps (and usually a free fast travel point but that's buggered). You can then either defend or let it to be captured and then take it back. Taking back is quicker and easier as it's only one wave of enemies. Defending can be up to 4. When you build in a workshop if the junk needed to build something is green then it comes from the workshops own stash so build away. Workshops are pvp zones though. Someone can come and beat you up and steal your lunch money.
---
Everytime you see a workbench get in the habit of scrapping all junk to lighten your load. And then when you see a stashbox (found in camps, train stations, red rockets)
---
Scrap weapons and armor you're not using as you get components and a chance of a mod. 
---
And this link tells you where to find ALL of the things. It is pre wastelanders so some stuff may be wrong now.

---
Sleep in a bed and play an instrument until you get a bonus. Takes like 30 seconds. 
---
Plant some crops in your camp. Corn or Razorgrain. And then make soup. 
---
NGL! Game has bugs and problems. Either ignore them and move on or don't and complain about them on the internet and hate the game
---
Yes and no.
---
If you've only got one, very specific, change to make a patch can be done in as little as two days. We know this because they released a hotfix on January 31 2019, literally 2 days after patch 5 (January 29 2019). Here are the hotfix patch notes: https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/44hSMCa7BGSxsftNvbMUQT/fallout-76-hotfix-notes-january-31-2019
---
But there are a lot of reasons developers lean towards doing fewer, larger patches, most of which are ultimately good for gamers as well:
---
1. Patching files, particularly on consoles, often requires re-downloading an entire file even if only a small part of it changed (note that the hotfix I linked earlier had a 1GB download size on consoles but was only 14MB on PC). Lots of minor patches means a *lot* of wasted bandwidth.
---
2. Games are really complicated, and so proper testing requires checking that fixing one bug didn't inadvertently create issues somewhere else. The adrenaline bug is likely an example of this *not* working properly - Bethesda probably didn't even touch that perk, but they changed something somewhere that affected adrenaline somehow. Avoiding issues like this generally requires doing a bunch of bug fixes and then doing testing to check that they all work, both individually *and* when all put together.
---
3. Consoles have a certification process whereby devs have to let Sony and Microsoft check the patch before they allow it to be sent out. I'm not sure exactly how long this takes and to what extent there is a financial cost associated, but it is often cited as an important factor in patches coming out at a slower rate.
---
I triggered Recruitment Blues today, too. Defiance Has Fallen is still showing as complete, but there's no way to get Recruitment Blues off my to do list. If I talk to Major Gutsy he just hands me a fresh certificate and the diamond stays over his head like I need to talk to him.
---
Meh im sure there's enough entertainment here to get me through until Horizon Zero Dawn launches on PC tomorrow night lol. Right...? Lmao
---
yeah.. but i cant make no more double sided walls.. game is unplayable anymore
---
Interesting thought!
---
Don't bother with the trolls/fanboys in the comments.
---
They either refuse to see the issues in a classic "I've never had a bug" or "game making is hard, so give them more money" approach... or just want to see the whole thing burn for some reason.
---
BGS is incapable of fixing day 1 or even BETA problems. Hell, there are issues dating back to Oblivion at the LEAST (goo/ash piles are still a huge issue despite claims of fixing them). And this "exploit fix" smacks of trying to just pad the patch notes more than anything else.
---
They shit on the pvp'ers with bogus and lame changes that catered to cry babies instead of just fixing passive mode
---
They shit on the builders by making build mode overly restrictive 
---
They shit on the event runners by recycling rewards and failing to bring us new content
---
I'm pretty sure there's no one left to shit
---
I'm a vegetarian- I'll be the player on the sidelines holding the PETA sign.....
---
I stepped away before the vault raids.  Was sick of the delays and bugs.  It did a world of good.  I came back after wastelanders and had a real blast.
---
Right now...I'm thinking it's maybe time again.  Gamers shouldn't loyal to just one brand.  There are plenty of games on the market all wanting our attention and money.
---
I love fallout.  It's amazing.  Most of the frustration here is only down to the potential it has.
---
I don’t know that it does, no one outside of Bethesda does. I can tell you that no company spends the money to fix a bug that has no detrimental effect. If I was guessing I’d say it could affect load performance, perhaps it causes clipping on the wall unseen to the player but taxing the server as the app tries to correct.
---
As a settlement mod maker for Fallout 4, it would take a days work to add double sided walls. Seriously, I'll provide you the f\*\*\*ing files if you need me to.
---
We know you're going to take months to fix this, meanwhile no one with more than a box house can move or edit their camp.
---
*fixed
---
Thats not a new thing. Class Freak never worked on Speed demon ... the negative is uneffected from it and always was like this.
---
&gt; The main rewards are what we get when we reach the community goal. Honestly I wasn't even expecting individual rewards for helping. Anyone getting annoyed at this part lives on instant gratification in my opinion.
---
No rewards would be better than the trash we get just because of the time it takes to clear out my inventory after receiving it.
---
Biggest issue I have with all this is the fact that we have to EARN a double SCORE event after challenges getting autocompleted for a month. And it's behind Cork, not something easily obtainable like steel or wood. But the other community rewards you bring up aren't that much better. 150M steel for a beret lol?
---
I replaced the 4 points with #3 in fireproof and full adamantium skeleton since I kill tons and tons of queens. We’ll see how that goes.  Might toss 3 back into charisma to run inspirational instead, idk. Been running around with 1 charisma and haven’t really missed it.
---
I don’t, i’m stuck there too 😩
---
Right, I see what you did there Todd 😜
---
Maybe maybe maybe 😂😂😂
---
Not sure if sarcasm or not since no where did I mention the update just the event so imma take you as sarcasm and say yes game ruined.
---
So your solution is firing people during a pandemic? K.
---
So which certain perk card should I use for mutations
---
Good idea! Thanks for your advice. Why didn’t I think about that 😂
---
*Looks at declining player numbers, lack of active pts testers, and current bug roster*
---
If you say so chief. Also vocal minorities typically don't get their own reddit thread in addition to a forum thread which means a majority of people are unhappy which kind of hurts the argument that its just loud redditors. You at least are active daily, is everyone voicing complaints on either community just butthurt?
---
?  Do You mean which mutations to run?
---
50 cal and 5mm are so abundant in the world, why would you make it
---
Those complaint are just entitled and selfish. 
---
In a week they’ll be pissed about something else and start the drama all over again.
---
I lost 10k last night due to a Fixer plan selling before I was able to shut down my vendors (I'd already had some sales and was heading back since I was 25k caps).
---
The solution of turning off vendors (doesn't work except to stop broadcast) or hiding them somehow (I do, but it requires manual intervention of shutting down power to doors) is idiotic. The cap limit of 30k is idiotically small and honestly has no need to even exist.
---
People are going to find ways around the limit and already do using alternative currencies (ammo) or straight trades. The only ones being restricted/punished are people using player vendors as originally intended.
---
Yep. Learned that the hard way :(
---
The way Bethesda operates, I'm not even sure, if they are actually able to know how much junk was donated. My guess is that goals will be met no matter what, because admitting that your community doesn't want to or can't reach your donation goals, because the player numbers are not high enough, isn't exactly a good look for them.
---
Oh my bad crossed my mind you can have it on all parts sounds good thank you
---
It was amazing when the second season of Star Trek Discovery aired - the haters suddenly grew very, very quiet on that sub because it was really, really good.  Bliss.
---
Because people in this sub breathe drama and everything Bethesda does is immediately assumed to be malicious.
---
Then don't do it. No one is forcing you to do this event. You are choosing to donate you materials and then complaining about what you get back. Do you donate to a charity and then complain when they don't give you anything back?
---
Has something changed in camp building? Is
---
Foodbuild some way of stacking food buff or something?
---
Uhh.. the nuclear bombardments are done by the players. If anything that would make the BOS hostile to them, not MODUS.
---
Fo sho
---
Too little, too late at that point.  None of my friends (who moved on to other games) have come back to FO76.  Once you decide to jump ship, that bridge is usually burned
---
99 bugs in the code
---
Take one down, pass it around, 112 bugs in the code
---
Yeah I am dude, no point in talking with them haha. Since this patch, there is a platform wide problem with frames dropping to like below 5 on console and low teens for pc with the ash piles (I didn't have the frames nearly that bad before the patch, maybe 15-20 frames,it's 1-5 now...). And yeah most things they "fixed" are not, like the ps4 crashing issue. They had dedicated server maintenance/patch to fix that a month+ ago. I'd argue it crashes more now.
---
Nein, Ad Victoriam.
---
I have been trying really hard to get my son to like this game and play with me.  He usually only wants to play Fortnite.
---
Every time he plays with me I hear, "why is this game so buggy?"
---
Oh because YOU haven’t seen it cause lag problems means that it hasn’t created ANY lag problems. So when you log onto 2 or 3 servers over the course of a few hours that gives you a big picture of how the other hundreds of servers are performing right?
---
And you know what’s going on in all the private servers you can’t even log into?
---
Give me a break. Get your head out of your ass.
---
I've noticed that about half this community. If you say anything that's not negative they attack you for defending the game. That's why I made that disclaimer lol and I bet it'll still do ignored.
---
Adrenal reaction/bird bones/eagle eye/marsupial/herd/carnivore or herbivore/ and whatever else you fancy check the list. Don’t worry to much about the negatives because u have a perk card that reduces those by 75% just look at the positive side.
---
No like when u have that one armor like unyielding which I also need, I want to have mutations and the perks that give me like more damage
---
Respect.   I can appreciate that philosophy.
---
If that is true, then I will give him whatever he wants so I can have a suite at the Whitespring
---
Eh.  Most people don't test things all that regularly.  I actually tested some stuff earlier and didn't even think about it then.  Just now.
---
You do know crashing the server by stacking walls was how it was possible to dupe strangler heart PA.
---
Join a group and help others. Everything else falls into place after that.
---
Hi. *Actual* creator of Mappalachia here...
---
~~It's great that you ported a similar concept to the web.~~ But I would have really appreciated if you had contacted me first about using the name which I gave my project...
---
For the record, I'm not associated with this work and I have never heard of it until now. I *am* however working on a hugely more feature rich, desktop version of Mappalachia. So - watch this space.  
---
\*Edit: Actually looking at this site it's not actually real-time mapping anything. You've just embedded my work as images into a frame and slapped a UI over it. You edited out my watermark but didn't bother to change the colour coding of the legend. Shame on you.
---
Does people cheating REALLY effect your gameplay though? Anyone I’ve ever met “hates” cheaters, until I’m giving them stuff for free.
---
Which are the perk cards
---
I've seen you call people unhappy about the wall change "Karens" multiple times now.
---
I'm honestly curious... is there any aspect of gameplay that would make you angry enough to complain here? Or is everything just fine no matter what happens?
---
I used my steel for bullets, which I'll happily donate to the BoS - two at a time, at speed.
---
They just need to add a PTS to the Consoles. I don't understand how a game like PUBG can pull it off but a AAA studio game can't
---
Big surprise, another post about this because the entire front page of the sub being covered in them wasn't enough.
---
I honestly didn't know there was an individual reward on each turn in until the patch went live, so it's a bonus to me.
---
That build with full unyielding and a bloodied handmade will one shot everything in the game except scorchbeasts which will take 3-5 shots. Vats lock hold down the crit button and fire.
---
This game is 100% saveable. Bethesda is just either incompetent, simply doesn't give a single fuck, or both. It's probably both, at this point.
---
Ive got some cards lol
---
Community managers are there to communicate good or bad...
---
Don't be daft. Restructuring isn't firing.
---
Well said.  I think you speak for a large portion of the senior player base here.  If we are burnt out now I cant imagine using the legendary perk system.  Bethesda is really fucking the dog here.
---
I’m with you too, just a matter of time I guess.
---
I have some friends and fun... despite the game. I guess we will start looking for a new one.
---
At least those two you listed I would turn in for scrip, they’re heavy items and aren’t worth saving them. However if you can I’d also suggest saving as much scrip as possible until you’re a higher level, so when you do buy something with it you get a higher level weapon that you might find more useful long term
---
I can see them adding double-sided walls to fallout 1st players only. Then a few months later adding them to the store for 1200 atoms
---
*demands your tribute
---
That was exactly my feeling. I was just excited to see the community goals contained BoS stuff lol
---
I'm not. Not because of the rewards in general, but because gating a double SCORE event behind it is an insult after all the autocompleted glitches.
---
I am imagining the reason this event is handing over core resources is to try and deflate the ridiculous amount of resources people have stocked up. What would have been better is giving people options of handing in legendary and other more rare equipment to try and reboot the economy.  
---
The ammo converter is the kind of thing people are always going to complain about. Yeah it was implemented poorly but mainly for people who were hoarding ammunition they didn't need. In small quantities it could be tedious but hardly aggravating.   
---
I handed in about 4k worth of steel, most worthwhile thing I got was a Raider power armor plan for the left leg. I went into this knowing that the reward wasn't going to be worth the input. They've not exactly promised the world, what they mainly promised is the rewards for hitting targets and feeling like you're contributing to the BoS being implemented. Though what affect it would actually have on the story is another issue.  
---
Interior walls are annoying, that I understand because I hate having boxes as a house and I feel like it shouldn't be this hard to implement interior walls. This I agree with but to be honest base building in this game just needs to be overhauled because it's just disappointing most of the time. Sure you can make a cool CAMP but outside of shit for people to gawk at there is no socialisation or community that would make a decent CAMP better   
---
Main issue that I have with this is THAT is the fix that the game desperately needs. Public teams are not being used to socialise but just for XP boosts and ticking boxes in your dailies. we need ingame chat, we need better ways to roleplay, we need ways to create quests that launch from our camps.   
---
The delays in the Wendigo boss though is also shameful and should have been communicated better but more shit to grind is just tiredsome at this point.
---
Nah.  I'm a middle aged gay man who has lots of sex, respects women, votes left, loves exploring the world, and occasionally likes to lightly troll people who take things way too seriously.
---
But hey, maybe there are others here that are incel-adjacent....
---
Oh okay thx
---
Why is double stacking a wall a problem?  Maybe I want high ceilings
---
At least FO76 kept the original fucking camera perspective. The day FO76 is on the level of ESO I quit, cause thats not a fucking game I want to play.
---
It doesn’t affect me directly though right? Like unless I receive one of those duped items I’ll be fine?
---
Hey awesome write up and thanks for the response. I have a couple questions if thats okay. How do I go about joining a public team? Is it something in game in the ui that will be explained in the tutorial or is it just picking a group on reddit or something of the sort? Second, as I don't see myself playing this in the long term, would I have a better experience getting FO 1st just for the month to get access to the ToddScam benefits like the tent and infinite stash or are they only worthwhile to more invested players? Basically is it something the game desperately needs thats held back or is it just an unfair pay-for-convenience from a grinding sense?
---
Edit: spelling
---
This worked for me.
---
Confirmed. (XBox)  Never had lag on the board screen prior to this last update.  Now almost unusable.
---
If you have tent skins unlocked, they will be in the Fallout First section of the atom shop.
---
They were limited time fallout 1st rewards.
---
I think they're talking about certain Enclave events.
---
Very cool, but ouch on needing adhesive and plastic for arrows!!
---
Ya what you want is WoW or LoL thats not competitive, ESO is fucking trash and millions agree with me. Its an exact replicate of a mobile fucking game, people love mobile games though, I find them cheesy as shit.
---
Sure, I get it. Not that upset about it getting fixed...but added healing factor again to compensate which means constant fast travel bug. Argh.
---
So I assume my JFFR gauss minigun is a magic weapon, am I right?
---
I guess ppl get mad when they see someone used their atoms on moving up the board even tho I wasn’t buying anything with them. And I am not off work, I am not a kid. I’m 33, have full time job and a family. So I got up to 80 without buying any levels. I work 55 hours in a lumber yard as a supervisor. If I feel as if I wanted to pay just so I didn’t have to grind every challenge everyday then so be it. First time in the whole time I’ve been on reddit I’ve been downvoted so oh well. But again I don’t even know why I took the time to explain why. Because it’s not their atoms or money.
---
I noticed something was off with my stats, but couldn't figure out what!  Will check this out
---
I nuked them cuz i gave them a buch of steel and what did i get ? F@ wine bottles and candy. Nuke them whenever you can. Hahahaha (laugh in enclave voice).
---
Yup. More posts means more eyes see it and therefore more interest to push Bethesda for change. 
---
By your mentality you should only say the pledge of allegiance once and never needs saying again. I mean, someone said it... So let's just let it go... 
---
Or one person once said "black lives matter" so let's let that go...
---
Or one person stood up to Britain and their oppression, so that gets us a new free country...
---
Smart...
---
Mmmm, kill stuff fast = less bullets. Less bullets = less grinding for mats. Less grinding for mats = more time for killing. More time for killing = more bullets. Fuuuuuuuuuck!
---
What the fuck do you think "reducing manpower" means? Artists can't just be shuttled over to coding, dude, that's not how making games works.
---
Yeah they're absolutely brain dead. If us stupid consumers can see how to fix it, you'd think they would too given their sole purpose is to make more money..
---
considering the next legendary season will include halloween it's always possible to see more cryptic content
---
and honestly I'm surprised they didnt shove big foot into the game as well
---
Well they just release the same fucking game every year and rename it. It's bound to work if its been in development that long
---
Oddly enough I had an extra 15k lead in my scrap box for some reason and theres no trades I've done and I highly doubt my daily routine got me that much
---
It was because way back in the day some people used this exploit in a different way to lag servers to be able to buy legendarys for caps. But it was a tedious way to lag it and has been abandoned as a method to lag servers.
---
I'm not seeing some of my favorite fanboy/trolls active atm but give them time.
---
It honestly boggles my mind that people are so willing to defend a game company that is so wildly out of touch on every last thing.
---
I \*LOVE\* the franchise. I've played since 1. I was super excited when this was announced (though more than a bit trepidatious given the dumbing down of RPG aspects in 4), and ordered the Tricentential edition without a second thought.
---
The past nearly 2 years have been a painful eye opener. There seems to be no aspect of this game that they can't screw up in some way, often remaining completely SILENT about it for months only to fix it behind the scenes without a word (greenhouse is a great example). Or just never fix it, giving us empty palliatives about "letting the dev team know" or "thanks, we'll pass it up the line".
---
Unless there is a massive culture shift in this division of Bethesda, this game won't be around in a year. Then where will all the abused gamers go for their Stockholm Syndrome Simulator "fun"?
---
Did anyone figure it out yet? I was just standing in my camp and got a whole level?!
---
eh yes you and your totally real internet degree. im sure you got that from the harvard institute of yaleford.
---
inflation is either caused by there being far more currency being added than being removed (printed) which the cap has nothing to do with, this would be in relation to quest and event caps and the daily vendor cap limit.
---
or 
---
its demand-side, not enough supply to meet demand. (fixer plans being a rare drop and highly sought after. this also isnt a function of the caps cap.
---
the inflation everyone is so afraid of already happened, its why people were doing 10:1 trades before the recent dupe. if anything, the cap made inflation worse early on, because noone is going to log in to a second alt just so they can make a 30500 payment. if you are going to go 30k+ might as well tack more to the price to make it worth the loading screens.
---
If you don't donate to them they'll just steal what they want from you anyway. You should be happy for those grenades and water.
---
Pts is largely youtubers, very casual players, and people with a mouthful of bethesdas nutsack.
---
Yep, but boring events are just going to turn people off. If it was not for the Legendary run I would probably take a break from F76 and there wouldn't be any reason to subscribe. I know some people don't like it but we are all just different. Just hope the Colossus event doesn't get pushed back one more time only 10 lvl left.
---
Are you on PlayStation and did this yesterday. Either i was on when you nuked atlas or its a popular thing. I was on yesterday dropped off a bunch of steel and a lil later someone nuked the observatory. I was like “huh, well not my problem.”
---
Also I want to add why is it people who have fallout 1st aren’t getting more skins?? Right now People are paying for a scrap box and that’s it. Why isn’t there a special camo for every month if not every week something new for 1st members. I just think it’s a bit fair to give people who are paying monthly a title more since you know they are contributing more to the company 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Performance issues?? The game is almost completely crashing after the update anytime I’m near a meat pile
---
It's not a bug it's a fix.
---
*our stash *our steel
---
I really enjoy building and pvp.  I wish the pvp community had been half as vocal as the building community
---
The fact you bring up political bullshit in response to me saying a topic in a video game gets posted about too much really speaks volumes about the type of person you are.
---
I've completed it so many times perfectly - full ore/ all people surviving and go no different rewards than I did failing the event so I just bought the plan and the hazmat suit from players. The hazmat suit isn't even worth it because it's not able to be repaired right now.
---
Feels like a cartoon. Vault boy walks into an office room with his eyes closed and opens them only to notice a small crack in the wall. He pulls out a tube of caulk and patches up the already unnoticeable hole, he nods in self congratulatory fasion and closes his eyes again to leave the room through the door he entered in. 
---
The camera then zooms out to show the whole room was on fire and the people in it were running around in a panic while they and their work desks were on fire. The camera then fades to black.
---
The game itself runs at 5 fps anytime I’m at events like line in the sand or rad rumble and it seems to be caused from meat piles
---
A 50 cal will get you plenty far. If you want to be conservative on ammo do a Gatling gun, the ballistic not the energy.
---
It's almost as if they're trying to make up for it with all these double score events since the code doesn't allow them to just give score away. Or maybe I'm trying to be positive about what's going on, who knows.
---
I dont even think I've used a grenade the entire 91 levels I've played lol
---
Sorry, I’m not interested In discussing economic theory if you’re going to start off with base insults.
---
Too bad, because it could have been interesting.
---
SBQ is just as bad. My minigun fires like a gatling
---
What does the engine being old mean to you? I’m not trying to be interrogative—I simply want to know where you’re coming from.
---
A game engine is simply a collection of software libraries. They normally evolve over time. If there is development work done on the engine all the time, it progressively gets better (it’s clear in the case of Bethesda, the bugs in the engine go unchecked because they don’t test and patch them).
---
Yeah I mean decent content though. Not a cheap house of thrills for a week with wierdos in costumes.
---
All these? There's been 1. If they wanted to make up for it, They should've  given us one without requiring 200,000,000 Cork lol. They are able to give us one with cork, so why not one without? When they owe us SCORE for their mistake? Especially when there are people who lost 20-30k or more in SCORE? That's 50M more cork, than steel, which is a far more easily obtainable material. 
---
And why cork? Why not put it behind steel or wood? It's almost as if they didn't want to use an easier material for that reward so people resort to paying for the last couple of ranks?
---
I believe you can only buy X01 mods from Enclave, though I am rather drunk and might be confusing PA sets.
---
Keep the bottle close, you're gonna need it.
---
had one hazmat suit drop on an alt i was levelling. There's little level 25 me gathering ore while all these high levels just sit and ignore the dying NPCS
---
The only time I ever use them is when a magazine or bobblehead is out of reach. You can drop an explosive by them and they'll get moved so you can interact with them most of the time.
---
Bullshit.
---
The CMs (who granted are nothing more than goodwill ambassadors who are not allowed to do anything but comment on the most neutral issues or feelgood posts), have responded quite a few times on posts of camps that OBVIOUSLY required significant glitching to accomplish. It's not like this was unknown. Or if it was, then that seriously calls into question the ability of BGS to even understand their own game.
---
I personally only used the door&gt;wall&gt;door glitch to do harmless things like hiding ugly wiring or placing walls "in front" of foundation blocks for a more aesthetically pleasing exterior. I'm one of the MANY builders who truly love this one aspect of the game, choosing to ignore the broken shooting and loot in what is essentially a looter shooter, \*NOT\* an MMO.
---
This change, well intentioned (or more likely completely accidentally given the teams track record) is a huge blow to a sizable proportion of the community who has put up with so much nonsense. Take away a huge avenue of creativity, only to attempt to monetize it down the road, and you've lost a LOT of people.
---
If the Axe doesn’t have Fast swing, Id go with bat, make it All Star/aluminum and with electric coil mod.
---
Big if true
---
Thank god they fixed the camp wall glitch though. The games playable now. Oh, you’re not able to progress in a quest due to Bethesda breaking the quest? Oh pish posh lad just buy the rest of the quest for 750 atoms : )
---
LMAO cant argue so you just pretend you have an economics degree.
---
just stop kid.
---
You get it from white springs bunker. Believe there’s a terminal in the armory where you get them for free
---
The armor plans are found in the enclave bunker terminal in the military wing. The mod plans are for sale at the production terminal near the north entrance to the bunker. Just go in and go straight and the modus on your left
---
It appears Bethesda is hellbent on everyone having boxes for CAMPs...
---
Nah.
---
Canceled this morning also
---
Reporting these people is such a passive-aggressive thing to do and it won't result in bans. 
---
Lockpick the factories, and change the ammo type on the terminal to .38 or an ammotype you need. Nuke their camp if your these factories trigger you so bad.
---
&gt;the harvard institute of yaleford

🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
Can you bring feed for Chally?
---
I know these 6: 
---
Complete 2 events
---
build anything at camp/workshop (5 items)
---
buy from/sell to 3 players
---
capture a workshop
---
level up
---
Complete 5 dailys
---
==
---
Not sure about the other 3 - it was too early when I did those.
---
I think one was kill 10 critters and another was something with a public group.
---
No idea what the NW one was
---
HTH
---
It looks like tons of people are just leaving the game. I don't blame them really it's time for this BS to stop. Dev's need to start fixing their games and doing what the community demands of them.
---
It should be, but I would test it against another gauss minigun that you would expect not to be magic with the only dependent variable being the magic part of the gun.
---
I didn't realize ZeniMax only had this one game. My bad, dude. Carry on then. You'd think a company with some 2000 employees and worth a few billion dollars would even have HR and training programs. But I guess if they're just stuck with what they've got then, well, it is what it is.
---
Oh no your not, were gonna put you on collecting the green meat for the herbivores!
---
Healing factor causes the fast travel bug? That would explain why I never had it at all, then one day it suddenly became an issue...
---
I assume it's that but by now I kinda thought you guys got used to it and not expect any "wows" in every update. I recently joined to catch up with news since I'm going to play Fo76 soon.
---
i usually run friendly fire to heal them but atm i'm still grinding the legendary run and as I refuse to pay to win I need all the xp I can get. normally none of the scavs die because nothing gets past me but unless someone else runs ore then we usually fail
---
Okay, you're the one who brought up the NCR, though.
---
I've played every game since I grabbed the first two in like 2001. That's how I know that the Brotherhood doesn't just kill feral mutants (Even Lyon's Brotherhood, the one that actually made it a mission to help people, was known to open fire on the ghouls of Necropolis), and that not all Super Mutants are insane murderers - particularly on the West Coast, where the Brotherhood is actually from and where supermutants have founded multiple perfectly civil and functional towns and some even joined the NCR's Rangers.
---
I’m probably a hell of a lot older than you, and mature enough not to try to argue with idiots.
---
In a battle of wits, I don’t fight unarmed combatants.
---
I teach my kids better.
---
Yeah, I noticed something with this when I first logged in today. I swapped my cards and it fixed it. I can’t for the life of me remember what was going on but I remember instantly thinking that they broke it and I was getting extremely negative mutation effects.
---
Ah, ok, those aren't necessarily nuclear, they could just be kinetic or conventional.
---
This post is so good, I put it in a table.
---
WHAT WE WANTED |  WHAT WE GOT
---
---------------|-----------
---
A fix for the fast travel bug  |  Some comments on various Reddit posts that it is a priority and the team is working on it?
---
VATS bug to be fixed  |  Some comments on various Reddit posts that it is a priority and the team is working on it?
---
The rest of the mods for the secret service armour  |  Yet another bugged release that doesn't work
---
The colossus problem event that has been hyped and promised  |  Well after an initial delay, the PTS feedback saying the event is ready and past ITV's telling us it will release with the patch we had no indication of any delays until after the patch notes dropped
---
Interior walls to be able to put wallpaper on both sides of a wall, bigger camp. Bigger camp budget to utilise all the new items that keep getting released.  |  Disabling one of the most versatile and creative ways to create camps that most of the community has done, not to mention anyone into camp building that sees guides or watches camp building on YouTube sees the creativity and wants to try something different. Plus the new CAMP skin that disables fast travel to your camp and doesn't show your vendors anymore.
---
An easy way to sell or exchange ammo. Then we wanted a usable interface for the ammo converter that is just like the current interface we have for vendors and stash with a sliding bar because its simple  |  Something more complex, though it does require less clicking there is still not even a way to see how much ammo you have without exiting and going into your Pipboy and something that genuinley confuses the community on who designed this? Who thought this was a great design and approved it? Who tested it?
---
A fix to the Scorchbeast Queen not being able to be crippled as it was a tactical way to experience the fight  |  A continued experience of RNG hoping she will land since with a bullet sponge that has had its only real tactics removed. This has been bugged since Wastelanders released so how many new players have joined since then that have never been able to experience the fight the way seasoned players have?
---
The current BOS community challenge to be engaging and involve BOS items for donations  |  Disappointment. Alcohol, radaway and generic plans that are in many camp vendors by the hundreds and some caps. Seriously many veterans will be dropping the drinks, aid items plans etc and the caps for many seasoned players are already plentiful. We understand this can be a help to new players so why design an event targeted to the veterans doing all the donating? Not even a chance for a single BOS plan in the mix? Just donate all your resources for a flag? No chance at getting scrip? The new rewards are already made so we cant trade them without opening them first. You want to combat dupers yet you unbanned many of them with the duped items still in the inventory.
---
Freezer or a way to preserve food  |  A fridge that is not as good as the good with salt perk that still does not go far in preserving food where many recipes often involve a lot of grinding for ingredients. Can we get a freezer added to the secret service vault? Hell as a commando build that has already purchased the secret service build I need things to spend my 300+ treasury notes on
---
An adjustment to hunger and thirst because eating 3 meals and drinking 5 waters every 10 minutes was excessive, better ways to utilise recipes that require complex ingredients and a lot of farming (See Freezer)  |  According to Dev Q&amp;A they are removing the de-buff from hunger and thirst making players no longer need to eat or drink which we never asked for and many dont want as its more changes that make the game far too easy and removes all sense of balance
---
An easy way to manage our daily quests and when they have reset  |  A terminal that has since been seemingly forgotten that only keeps track of Biv and 2 possum scout dailies
---
A way to track vendor purchases through our personal terminal you put which also gives it some functionality  |  Silence
---
Cool new ways to customise our characters and make them our own with personal touches,  |  A gillie suits for secret service armour that blocks views in first person, bugged cosmetics that require over a month to fix
---
New weapons, Skins for popular weapons like The Fixer  |  A skin for the Fatman, a skin for the Dragon which are hardly common weapons, a broken skin for the Handmade that required a future fix that should of been a new weapon
---
Perk load outs (I know PC has mods but console doesn't), the ability to turn off the prompts to open card packs after a certain point, passive perks for things like lock-picking etc as we arent doing this in a fight, its not giving an unfair advantage it is simply saving us having to go through mutliple menus to swap some cards around then swap them back  |  A complicated perk point coin system that punishes players for opening card packs and losing duplicates, that punishes players that have used level ups to re-spec their characters and try new builds and only after disappointment from the community is getting some perks that actually seem useful. Can we please just abandon forcing us to need to scrap perk cards for coins and just base it on our level?
---
An easy way to trade items not simply sell them for caps  |  Silence
---
The ability to separate armour and clothing  |  Apparently the dev's know its a requested feature?
---
Challenging areas/dungeons  |  Laggy vault raids now removed and no indication of return, the burrows which apart from easy ghoul killing XP has little replay incentive, survival mode which has been scrapped and an announced One Wasteland that has been stated a level 1 and a level 100 will require approximately the same amount of ammo to kill the same creature with scaling difficulty (I cant be the only one that loved the way it was/is now with having to earn your way to explore the map and the sense of pride that comes from seeing how far your character has come?)
---
I'm sure this will be the one that turns it all around
---
On your map screen it will say social at top. There'll be an option for public teams. make or join one =0
---
I wouldn't get first now. Once you hit the point where you have a full stash think about whether or not you can see yourself playing on. If you get it for just a month though you want to go absolutely HAM and gather as much junk to shove in that scrapbox as possible. I don't need 99% of the junk in my stash box. I only have it because i can store it. We managed before the scrapbox and we managed when the stash only held 400 (barely kinda sorta)
---
I’d like to read the article
---
If you can't reproduce the error, it's darned near impossible when dealing with a huge amount of code.
---
for the rewards system, i totally agree! when finishing commander dagguerres ally quests i was so fucking dissapointed when i got a LEVEL 20 (mind you most of the dungeons and enemies you enciunter in the series of quests are 50+) alien blaster (even if it was level 50 its completely useless because the only farming method to get alien blaster rounds is whatever the refreshing rate for loot items is in an unmarked location, 15 rounds ata a time) i mean the gun isnt even good! even at level 50 (without the legendary effect) an alien blaster does a revalitively moderate amount of damage and *you* can convert it to use fusion cells but that just really bumbs down the damage rendering it useless (even if it's level 50) all it is, is a showpiece with its different mods than the normal alien blaster.
---
No luck here. Was hoping when I found this thread there was a fix but apparently everyone is having the same issue. At least we can suffer together lads!
---
It's like they completely forgot how to make a npc
---
100% agree man. I love Fallout, and I love playing this game when it isn't being buggy and laggy as all hell. That's why I'm pretty disappointed in Bethesda's choices, lack of communication, and being out of touch. There are so many things they can do, big and small, to help make this game great, but they miss it by miles and miles. The fact they see what we post on this subredditt, yet completely miss, shows they just don't give a shit because many people still buy hundreds of dollars worth of overpriced atomic shop items, and we love this game, so we play it. It's just very unfortunate, my dude.
---
Can i get the link? I'm curious to how using double sided walls could dupe items
---
Thanks.  Yah I think  the last 3 didn’t even show up on mine...
---
you can, the rewards should help you, but i think if you go to atlas to donate steel and other players see you do it you might receive lots of hearts and a few donations for yourself ;)
---
Maybe in the form of a nuclear missile.
---
See the replies you get. They hate the event, they aren't going to do it. And yet, they have to always keep talking and talking about it and and letting everyone know just what they think. 
---
They make up all kinds of stupid reasons. Like, I have to waste time deleting the rewards from my inventory. And they are insulted for having to do so. How dare Bethesda give them a reward they don't want and didn't ask for when they still can't get the SBQ to have sex with them! 
---
It's ridiculous.
---
same. Well. except for the xp part. If i heal the npcs nobody gets ore. if i go for ore the npcs die. 
---
the game should add some kind of quest involving friendly fire.
---
Also BF2 is pretty damn good and has been for at least a year. The dev team has really put care into that game and it shows, plus the community is pretty great too
---
you dropped you fedora and navy seals medals lmao
---
They should have been an outfit from the beginning anyway
---
Do you want to? If the answer is yes. Then donate.
---
Lol none of you nerds matter, y'all always get mad about some dumb camp thing and you're still gonna pay for 1st nobody believes any of you
---
I got so frustrated after trying to exit that I hard closed the whole game and walked away hating FO76 for the first time ever. THIS is improved version? Would it have killed them to have a visible or intuitive exit open? (PS4 here)
---
trading. i mean, as a way to stop you buying everything immediately for a new character.
---
Good one.
---
Joining a team is easy in game. There is a pop up notification when you log in. 
---
Fallout 1st is totally optional fir a casual player. If you fill your stash you have too much stuff. Sell it or scrap it. If you play for more than 10 hours a week for a month, you should consider it though. The tent is great and the stash box comes in very handy after a while. 
---
Welcome! The game is pretty stable these days. I get a server crash occasionally but it’s not a big deal. Hope you have fun in the wasteland
---
At that level you need your mat's more than the BoS does,  all the "end game" players will offset your cost.  (Were already at 75m/125m anyway)
---
^ This. Swing speed makes a world of a difference. I used to use a B/PA Grognaks axe but then picked up a B/SS sledge and oh, boy, shit dies quicker.
---
Get off my land
---
Every time I see a camp like this it makes me feel just a little bit inferior, I try to make nice camps but they always just end up being like three rooms, an upstairs, a downstairs and a “back room” where my generator, Armco ammo machine and vendors are. I actually just found out about the double wall trick and used it for the first (and I guess last) time on my current camp to make a closeable “store front” using rolling garage doors and windows. I really like it and since I can’t do it again I guess this is my forever camp (on this character at least)
---
I'm level 53, I have been hard-core into this game for 2 weeks. I'm quickly running out of steam. FO76 is my first experience into the Fallout franchise.
---
Or https://support.playstation.com/s/article/Cancel-Auto-Renewal-for-Subscription-Services?language=en_US
---
As I didn’t even realize it was going to auto renew in the first place, just wanted to try it out but ended up getting three months of it before getting fed up
---
Just make both sides of a wall able to have wallpapers, but add the look of all external walls to the wallpaper options.
---
Sell or scrip generally
---
Happens after every patch - People always complain, say they are dropping 1st, say they will never play again.....
---
Been that way for well over a year and a half.  How many really do, I have no idea. 
---
Lots of good info is shared in here, but I don’t think this sub represents the plurality of players, much less a majority.  
---
Ad Victorium, keep calm and play on.... :)
---
Haven’t been on in a couple days. What happened?
---
Just played "Line in a sand" on PC steam, we has scorched spawn at the center of emitter, fps at the end was reaching 10-13 on my gtx1060 6gig.
---
I honestly don't think they have good leadership, typically issues like this (and most of the issues faced by FO76 since launch) can be traced to ineffective leadership.
---
just like real life lmao. work more = more money. but no, we have to keep the prices of extremely valuable items in the dirt so casuals can buy endgame gear for pennies lmao.
---
Can you send me the link?
---
Word of caution that website will over inflate the prices on some items and tell you to scrip other weapons that have value. It’s a guide but not gospel.
---
Or cancel the auto renewal, not auto cancel
---
Edit: and dearest Bethesda, get your house in order and I’ll be the first to resubscribe
---
Edit 2: downvote all you want, that’s not why I posted. I’m just trying to help people regain control of their money.
---
Yes and those fucking dupers have been the true cause of ww2!
---
Can I have your caps?
---
Idk I guess they made some players mad about camps somehow, idk why peolel play a wasteland game to build camps when they could be killing other players and stealing junk
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/. It's at 75m today.
---
That’s not what I got from their response today
---
Yea at level 20ish I wouldn't be giving anything away.  Lvls 25-40 are a slog.
---
yes but they do not sell mods
---
They did. We've had at least one double score weekend since the whole autocomplete bug. And let's not forget they gave us extra challenges daily and weekly. We at first only had 5 weeklies and 6 dailies, if you don't include nuclear winter challenges. Maybe you're choosing to forget that so you can focus on all the negatives?
---
Maybe they put it behind cork unintentionally, maybe they did it because they hate their community and want to see someone suffer. Or maybe if you think someone is out to get you, you assume everything they do is to hurt you. 
---
Now I'm not saying everything they do is perfect. This game is still pretty buggy and they do tend to put too many items in the atom shop, but digging around just to hate on something because you want to doesn't hell anything.
---
Absolutely... somebody just sent this to me today and I was so mad. At least there's a reason now for why...
---
*builds walls to block out your negativity*
---
"they did exactly what the community wanted to do, they just can't win" 
---
I’m sure we can both agree that physics is especially messed up in Skyrim. The physics engine itself is actually a very exceptional piece of software that has been integrated into many AAA games (Google “Havok games” to see a few); however, its integration into Skyrim was done quite poorly, causing the host of physics-related issues we see today.
---
Personally I’m in it for the pve. I like to build camps that look world appropriate (apparently that’s unusual). 
---
No idea what they could have done though.
---
Don't get me wrong, I like the theory here.  I'm just stuck on seeing 900 aluminum and adhesive and wondering why I should grind those out or just run Lucky Hole again.  'Organically' I don't have much aluminum lying around, I've been churning out Gauss Minis trying to get one or two that are usable.  Is there some untapped source of massive quantities of aluminum I'm missing?
---
It's the aspect of the game that hasn't been a constant disappointment and downward slide into further mediocrity.
---
It's not an MMO. Stop lying to yourselves people (not you /u/mvw2). It's a looter shooter that does both rather poorly since launch and parts of those have even managed to get worse somehow. It's a rather bland and poorly managed such game, but somehow manages to elevate itself CLOSE to greatness insofar as the setting and building.
---
But for some reason, BGS is allergic to money. Builders spend a LOT on the atomic shop. I know I have.
---
I love building. It's the only part of the game that isn't constantly broken (though it damn well has its share of problems, bad glitches and the like) and is a wonderful creative outlet.
---
Now all I have left to do is endless chores, grinding for RNGesus to get a couple better pieces of SS armor (which oddly \*STILL\* don't have the mods they claimed added in patch 21) and look sadly at my really nice CAMP that I can no longer safely tinker with.
---
Good job BGS. You took away the one thing which brought me joy in this game.
---
Can confirm, I have recently played "Line in a sand" on PC steam, we had scorched spawn at the center of emitter, fps at the end was reaching 10-13 on my gtx1060 6gig.
---
I tried it out for the first time today, I feel like my character is legit standing there taking apart bullets and trying to convert them by hand. That’s how long this process takes. Even worse you still don’t get rid of every thing. You’re always left with some remainders due to the number of stacks you can buy and sell at. To be honest, I rather just throw away my excess ammo into a doggie bag and let someone find it and take what they want while I go scavenging first what I need. The converter is just extra work
---
&gt; I shall be looking into my legal rights regarding false advertising on your product. I would not be surprised if others do the same. 
---
lmao is the biggest crybaby comment I've ever read, which is saying a lot for this sub full of whiners.
---
If you build it, they will come!
---
I found 1 point in fireproof to be sufficient, I'll have to see if I need more after playing around post speed demon fix
---
Is there anyway to stay posted on this issue? Or just keep trying and hope it eventually works? Lol
---
Did you try logging out and back on?
---
How often does this update?
---
Oh I know, I honestly enjoy trying to civilly discuss these kinds of topics and see who gives in first. Personally I try to find the positives and enjoy the game I'm playing, if I wanted to be pissed off at what I was doing why would I keep doing it? I can't understand that negative mindset.
---
https://www.kotaku.com.au/2020/02/fallout-76-players-keep-crashing-servers-to-duplicate-the-games-strongest-armor/amp/
---
I'll never understand developers who disregard advice from the community. The people who play the game every day tell you what the perfect solution would be to make them happy and you ignore it?
---
And something else broken
---
now you're just contradicting yourself. just stop digging yourself a hole because you're arrogant and have to reply to everything.
---
I have a two-shot and it's underwhelming and self-harming, confirmed
---
hoping the quad that just dropped today is better
---
I'm still waiting to see the game become free to play since that was a big proclamation well over a year ago.
---
I guess that makes sense. Thank you. It's just knowing what the desired outcome was supposed to be makes the actual outcome pale in comparison.
---
#killbos
---
Ooh preach!
---
I had that issue pre patch actually
---
No it isn't, hand over the game to the modding community, they'll have it fixed in 15 minutes!
---
I literally made a post months ago about consumer power and putting a stop to supporting Bethesda and got downvoted into oblivion and called an idiot. 
---
Todd Howard made fun of the consumer audience at E3 years ago and said they’ll stop remaking Skyrim when we stop buying it.
---
Also keep in mind grounded only has 12 developers working on the game
---
You do realize fo4 is an offline, single player game right?
---
They had 1. Which was scheduled before autocomplete bug became a thing. It was on the roadmap before the season really started. It's just been that 1 scheduled event. There's been no event given to make up for their mistake.
---
Sure, they did add 2 extra daily challenges. And no, they did not add any weekly challenges as you say they did. Something that once again requires effort when none should be needed when SCORE loss was caused by their mistake. There's no digging around needed to see that people were screwed out of SCORE and are now being asked to do extra work for it either through donating their resources or doing extra time consuming challenges.
---
Seeing how you're seemingly ok with it and actually defending and sugarcoating it with so much false information, I don't see a point in continuing this. Especially when I read things like 
---
&gt; Maybe they put it behind cork unintentionally
---
Reaching out this far to defend this is delusional.
---
My theory is that there are currency limits are because Bethesda is scared that dupers will learn to dupe them.  With a limit, they can only dupe so much but no limits means that they can flood the economy with duped currencies, which would ruin the economy (and the game) completely.
---
No, you brought the NCR as it was the opposing force of the NCR-Brotherhood war you were referencing. In which, the NCR also made it clear that it was unwilling to share power. So, you make a clear mistake in your statement, "Necropolis" is in California, not D.C., second, even the ghouls in UNDERWORLD, admit that they have never been harmed by the Brotherhood, they were shot at to keep them inside, never once does it mention they harmed them, let alone killed them. 
---
And buddy, if you've spent 150+ years fighting the same enemy, that has torn your people to shreds, slaughtered countless civilians or just forced survivors to become one of them, and there has been a small handful of that number being reasonable or even not being a simple minded slaughter machine, then yes, you're going to shoot first. Especially on the East Coast, where there have been 2 whole super mutants who weren't declared enemies of humanity. Please, please tell me how it's the Brotherhood who are in the wrong.
---
Keep drinking while you play and you will be fine
---
Welcome to the club, its been like that for 99% of us since wastelanders.
---
Well i fell in love with fo3 and here I'm with three female characters that I adore , and have spent so many hours building their camps. My first girl is a gunslinger,  second a commando and 3rd a heavy weapons or melee. The 3 of then are lvl250. To be honest with you I could care less about bugs duppers, griefers if I like something I enjoy it. I was always a lone player, and made a couple of friends here and I feel satisfied with the gear I have. Now I'm helping low level players with spare gear, just returning the favor other people did with me. What I like most is visiting camps and getting ideas, playing bows or crossbows it's also fun for me. So, it's just a matter of whatever floats your boat. But friends here is a fun factor.
---
Play a different game they just broke it again.
---
Yep.  Sometimes you can run there during or directly after and it will be there.
---
Then you can run back, tell people to follow you and they will shoot you in the face because they don't want to follow some scrub around. 
---
Then you go kill it with one other person who wasn't an ass and actually came along.  Lmao.
---
Haha. Didn’t take it that way. I honestly felt dumb in a lack of common sense way.
---
It’s on GamePass. Therefore Bethesda isn’t charging to access the game. 
---
And it’s always been free to play. There’s no monthly access fee.  Just the initial purchase cost. And that’s fading out.
---
From what I’ve heard it requires hundreds if not  thousands of stacked walls to actually pull of the exploit. And that’s if it actually even ever existed in the first place. I feel fairly certain that if it did exist, it probably wasn’t happening in public servers. If it’s not effecting the public community it shouldn’t be this much of a priority. Crashing private servers is of no concern to me or my friends doing events in public servers.
---
At that point I would say the dupers actually deserved whatever they are getting out of it. Imagine spending hours in your camp, staring at literal walls in order to get something sooner rather than having to farm for it over the next 3 years.
---
I used to use healing factor but I don't think I'll go back to it because there are some situations such as radiation rumble where it is advantageous to remove rads and still remain low health.
---
Yes it's a Meat Week Reward.
---
On a more practical level we could use the UI of the Legendary exchange machine, since it works along the same principles: items to points when items are moved from inventory to machine, points are visibly deducted from machine and added to your balance, and items can be purchased from machine for points. The purveyor uses a modified version of this UI, and it even has a slider for precise bulk purchases.
---
Instead of being snarky, maybe you can state outright what you mean, if you know so much about game development? Do you think lifelong artists can suddenly start professionally wrangling code after a couple months' training? Do you think waving off an Austin worker to wedge in with the Maryland studios to suddenly start developing assets for Starfield from home is at all realistic? Do you believe this fanbase won't get pissy all over again if they aren't satisfied by the Atomic Shop updates and don't see new content drops like are planned for this fall and winter because you've deigned that the asset creators shouldn't be doing their jobs?
---
Damn. I imagine doubling up walls using the flamethrower glitch will probably get nixed too due to this. We still need a legit way of having wallpaper on both sides of a wall, but im actually much less angry at this patch now. Don't know why your post is getting down voted, but maybe include the link in the main post because this makes it clear as day as to why bethesda patched this with no notification.
---
playing on xbox and just did line in the sand, seems like it s linked to the number of meat/ash pile. line in the sand was unplayable at the end, couldn't even move and the weapon start shooting 1-2seconds after i press the button
---
It won't matter. And the rewards people will literally just give you if you ask
---
well, we all hope to see you again one day! goodbye!
---
Once a day, around 12 EST.
---
Every single public server I do the event on has someone doing it and I don't even do the event that often.
---
Just go to the event..... no reason to ask someone to do it for you.
---
Thanks 👍
---
I thought that was always the case? Most of the power connectors in my experience have always provided ambient power. (Although I definitely haven’t tested all of them.)
---
They are the favorite scape goat/excuse. That and server stability. But they promised they where coming up something to replace it the wall thing. Super, duper pinkie promise they where working on it. That and VATS. And figuring out why the SS mods where in the release notes but never made it into the patch. I had time to consider all this as I watched someone melt the sbq in 3 minutes from a FO1st tent floating about a hundred feet in the air.
---
This article is 6 month old...
---
I've been playing the game since release and I am really tempted to give it up.it's just been one disappointment after another, one exploit after another, one issue after another, it just goes on and on and I don't think I can handle it anymore.
---
You can still do double sided walls what you on about?
---
The date on the article is from 6 mo ago.......
---
ironically, currency itself is the only thing that hasnt been duped. sure items that drop it have, but the the actual serverside currency.
---
but no, not everything is to combat duping like people here think. its about keeping people in a gameplay loop, get caps, buy thing, get caps. the limit forces people to do the "buy thing" part far more often then you might otherwise.
---
Aww, OP deleted the post.
---
Yes same here. Couldn't mine my precious copper.
---
I have that with plants near my base
---
Dude instead of apologize, add double wallpaper walls or a way to get our electricity through walls. Find a solutions. Apologizing is the easy way for such a company. Cmon ppl pay you a lot for this game.
---
Yeah bf2 has one hell of a redemption arc, its just a shame that their promise to only release free content lead to its downfall
---
And one more thing is please add all ammo types. Indeed，not many people use flamethrower. But it does not mean there is none.
---
Just buy them from bot vendors? IIRC outside of Ultracite Gatling Laser they are all available for purchase and your other option is to browse player vendors to buy them.
---
Exactly. If you can’t make the game fun, stop playing. Today me and my friend spent time collecting steel. We explored Morgantown and found things we hadn’t before. Then we hunted Supermutants for their weapons. 
---
It was fun. And I actually got some plans I didn’t know.
---
Why does it always have to be demon? He is single handedly responsible for a lot of dupe glitches going from a super small minority to major problem with his YouTube channel. This includes the most recent dupe glitch that led to the ban wave. Btw, all of his 122k subscribers are complicit in this bs. He posts all these dupe glitches because you all want to watch them. He then makes money off of advertising for sites that sell duped items.
---
And I'm curious why the market is flooded with legacy and bloodied weapons but not power armor lol
---
You see people writing on Reddit. You don’t even know if these people ever played lol
---
Thanks I’ll be looking at vendors inventory I usually sell to them and don’t buy
---
That's 12 times more developers than FO76, at least we still have a monkey working on ~~killing the fun~~ fixing bugs.
---
Can't wait to get it. It will really complete my kitchen lol
---
Grounded is too dry for me, for now anyway. I like the aesthetic but not much to it. Is it only Co-Op?
---
I’ll test it later with my bloodied one at 50% health as they have same damage at that point
---
Yeah I always run around with 2 and haven’t had an issue there.  I figure 3 of fireproof and skeleton will have a little more tankiness in the queen fights. Tend to get crippled a lot and ss legs don’t have the strengthened mods.
---
Or just toss all 4 into adrenaline idk.
---
I stopped playing a month ago and it changed my life for the better. Don't have to deal with this anymore.
---
Ha, that's creative i like it. With the weekly challenge of needing to scrap everything from oil to copper to aluminum to wood to steel, i never realized how easy it is to indiscriminately take all weapons and all junk items to salvage em, overencumbered. Wouldnt be hard for me to swap a few cards in strength for extra carry weight and food perks and just become a walking junkyard haha
---
Can't they might mod in free cosmetics. It's much better that the game remain broken then Bethesda lose a single atomic store sale.
---
I feel that man rebuilding camps kept me going. Always looking towards that next build. I couldn't wait to build a better looking ship. I figured, "I'll just save my supplies for now for the upcoming event". And now I'm pissed about that too. What a huge let down. And had I known about the reward drops I would've said fuck it and rebuilt my ship in a better spot. But now I'm stuck with it. Don't get me wrong I like it, but it was my first airship and I know I could build a better one. But nope, not anymore. 
---
In fact building that ship revitalized my love for the game in a way, as my enjoyment was starting to stagnate. 
---
Anyway, I applaud you for finding a better game. Ill be on the lookout as I don't have a gaming pc. Just an old laptop that can only play old games. Still waiting for a better mmo for consoles. Certainly not playing ESO.
---
id say just over a million, so people can play millionaire with BiS gear and have a little left over to FT. then there would be lots of room to differentiate value. you could price stuff at 50K 150K 350K 700K ect depending on its true value.
---
so can we not replace a window for a wall for the wallpaper any more? honestly that was the only way to wallpaper the windows.
---
You guys need to give Bethesda a goddamm break over this. It's a stupid subject even to be asking to revert and delay future content for something so stupid as fucking double sided walls to post your horribly uninmmersive looking wallpapers. Your camps suck ass, give it a rest already. 
---
Now something I AM angry about is the delay of the wendigo colossus event, legendary perks, and I'm worried about BOS major update.
---
I appreciate this, thank you.
---
that link is expired.
---
I quit playing in April after they took the masks and a few other things that was the last straw for me. I’ve played a couple thousand hours and have 5 characters ranging from lvl 500 to level 150. I’ve spent lots of money on atoms and FO1st. Sadly I paid for a year of FO1st in March and they are refusing to refund any portion of it.. even though I won’t play the game anymore. Judging from all the comments it seems I made the right decision to leave as its not getting any better. They had to make it game pass just to get people to play! Instead of trying to get new people, maybe they should try to keep the loyal fans/players they had.
---
Do you have any proof that this is something the patch broke and not simply more to do with you not hitting the item cycle limit in order to mine those nodes again?
---
Damn synths....
---
Not to be mean, but the fact so many people like yourself subscribed to Fallout 1st and brought atoms regardless of the state the game is in is the reason the game is not fixed and has soooo much wasted potential.
---
There's literally no reason to fix the game and allow it to become great if people spend so much on it  willingly. Every fix, dlc and so on cost money but every time people show "support" via micro transactions or subscriptions. They tell them not to fix this game. How? Because it's not normal in business to pay extra for things you're not happy about or want improved. Thus broken Fallout 76 because people told Bethesda with their wallets that they want that.
---
Again I'm not trying to be mean. 100% good you decided this isn't a game to pay extra for because you have issues. If more people were willing to do that then Fallout 76 might actually get fixed and meet its potential.
---
That would probably work better.
---
If you have any skins then you can select them in the atomic shop. One example is the settler or raider ones that came with the wastelanders bundles.
---
level 3 safes also have a chance to spawn weapon plans, including heavy weapons.
---
Get your swatters here!
---
That’s why lifegiver was awesome, you could have a little rad cushion of empty meter and the health would always snap to just below nerd rage.
---
Always find a lot of animals during a match but when you need the there isn't a single one.
---
This is accurate.
---
Oh but hey, they're adding more content to the game! Like the option to turn in tonnes of building supplies into a vendor in the hopes of unlocking a cosmetic! What a dynamic addition!
---
I actually didn't know that! Thats even more mind boggling how great of a company Obsidian is.
---
Lmfao. The response after I clicked on the link was fucking priceless! Sorry bout your day though, seriously, I feel your pain.
---
No more Meat Week would do it
---
Oh ok thanks
---
Ohhh OK...well that sucks seriously.
---
I guess I'll be looking for a Damm telsa.
---
Thanks for the info.
---
The “Explore Appalachia for 7600 hours” challenge now rewards 760 atoms.
---
Of course!
---
I would try that but I don’t got 3 lock pick yet and I’m getting one gun army
---
i have bitten the bullet and deleted the entire game.
---
doing a fresh install.
---
i will report back my findings.
---
This issue is 6 months old. Did you expect anything else from Bethesda?
---
We don't necessarily know your best bet is to contact customer support the only thing we can tell you is that based on previous posts is that the first refund is always guarantee but going past that? Who knows.
---
Nah you can go solo too! I agree that its definitely at its bare bones right now but on the 27th they're adding a bunch of stuff to the water biomes like a new kind of spider and stuff so I'm hyped. They said they'll be doing monthly content drops too!
---
Happened to me as well, they changed the required blood from 3 to 1. Wondering if the computer still thinks we need 3 samples to progress.
---
I wish they would just sell the game to a game studio that actually cared.
---
They're pushing the duping/server stability angle on it, making it seem like it was an essential change or else bloody fixers and legacy weapons would rain from the sky while servers where spontaneously exploding with enough force to kill your dog and children.
---
You can’t know till you ask.
---
6 months? Thats a quick fix for them. Theres still bugs from a year ago
---
As a side, not sure if it's only for FO1st members because I bulked and then used the scrap box to scrap. I assume anyone can do it because it's just the same button to scrap as anywhere so if anyone tries it please reply
---
I have about 500-700 hours of play time through the two years the game has been out and I can attest to the fact that this game lacks content. If you call daily fetch quests game content then I guess I’m wrong
---
Removing words is easier than fixing functionality, well it should have been at least!
---
I don't know about the switched one, but all the other pylons and small connectors have always radiated power in a roughly 2x2 tile radius.
---
Man I was working on some cool high up builds with that...
---
This has been getting more attention and makes for some enjoyment. Therefore will be patched out sooner than unlootable legendaries.
---
Ooh that’s cool. I’m guessing there’s no open lobbies or worlds like 76? Hopefully eventually they add that feature. Definitely a cool game.
---
Im on PC and not xbox but I lag out during the same events now since the last update, and noticed when someone uses a blue fire grenade or w/e it is, my fps goes from 50 to 5 until I relog.
---
Touché
---
That’s really a you question. If you don’t have any of the plans I say why not. The caps are certainly worth it at your level.
---
Lol i wouldn't be suprised if its the same monkey that nasa is trying to yeet into the sun.
---
MODUS is the way, the truth, and the life.  No one gets to the nukes except through MODUS.
---
I brought up the NCR solely as who the Brotherhood went to war with on their quest of control, not as any sort of "the NCR is better than the Brotherhood" comparison. But you're right, I forgot about that - because the NCR wasn't actually the point. It wasn't just the NCR the Brotherhood was trying to control.
---
I also got two ghoul towns with similarly-themed names mixed up, how silly of me. So you admit that the Brotherhood shot at non-feral ghouls all the time, though. Non-feral ghouls in their own home, for that matter. And your defense of them is that they haven't actually hit anyone.
---
I already told you how I think the Brotherhood is in the wrong - showing up where no one asked for them, attempting to install themselves as Top Dogs, and attacking/murdering people because they've decided they're the enemy without regards to what the "enemy" was actually doing.
---
Do you always get this triggered?
---
All hail breaker of chains!!!
---
two shot was my first and i couldn't wait to get rid of it. The gun has terrible accuracy as it is and the two shot was even worse
---
You really should be getting a ton of upvotes for the mass cleverness and hilarity of this comment.
---
Bethesda: Its a feature. We want our consoles to feel like they are run by the same processing power of the computers in game.
---
There is actual proof that they are the reason why as bethesda says it was related to a exploit different from what us builders were using it for.
---
Same exact mods. Get them from modus
---
The Pleasant Hills Cemetery above Lewisburg has three lvl 3 safes, and I’ve found heavy weapon plans there.  I *think* many lvl 3 safes throughout Appalachia have weapon plans among their loot pool...
---
Ok Next time I level up I’ll get lockpick 3 also thanks
---
I know! Took them this long and THIS is how they "fixed" it
---
This same thing seems to happen with the Nuka-Cola stairs. Attach a doorway to the bottom and you can't pass through.
---
I noticed that too, when they updated that it prolly messed it up.. oh well all we can do now is wait I guess.. not to be an asshole but I'm glad I'm not the only one lol
---
Deep Pocketed is always a favorite, kind of a just generally useful one.
---
Someone mentioned being sore and deleted immediately but I’ll bite. It’s not about being sore, it’s just a game. So we will do the mature thing and move on to better ones with better quality control. No skin off our asses.
---
How many times are people going to post this conspiracy theory. Did you even read the response from them today?
---
Indeed
---
They probably wanted to. But they won’t due to the backlash
---
Why do you have to wait 10 minutes?
---
I still am mad about the 60 bucks I wasted pre-ordering this steaming turd of a game.  I swear the fans in this subreddit are like battered wives that insist the main problem with their abusive husband is that he’s misunderstood.
---
I'm on xbox and can also confirm that this is happening, I think it my be connected to the sparkle the legendary rewards now have for some reason
---
This game in a nutshell
---
Unnecessary restrictions
---
I hope when the bos arrives, modus and the BOS will have some tension
---
I play since beta and did not notice this xD
---
I wired up all my structures around before with the small conduits.
---
Nevermind
---
Yeah right? I dont fully understand how this glitch works but its ruined everything for creative building.
---
I cant discover Bogtown. Its August 5, 2020. 
---
They havnt fixed anything. Theyre more worried about taking good items out of the game so players are just where they want them. Constantly playing, trying to get that one thing that they will never get u less they go to ebay. Gacha/fusion is their main concern. Stopping you from succeeding is their main concern.
---
Xbox here, can confirm broken.
---
You've never been able to "drop" strangler PA, so I question the accuracy of that entire article. Plus it's on Kokatu, which has been a bullshit click bait site full of misinformation for years.
---
Unbunch your panties. The odds of this being the reason they fucked with the building system are slim to none.
---
The last duping exploit worked with trainstation vendors. This is all bullshit.
---
Ah shit my bad dog
---
B/SS/str always wins out.
---
Most but not all.
---
For example, if it wasn't for a wave of mostly negative feedback on legendary perks system from us testers, I guess we'd already see that utter mess being a part of the game since patch 20. Or 21. But they continue receiving negative feedback and keep postponing that feature to even further release.
---
But yeah, whether or not they'd be able to deliver the system that's gonna appeal to the majority of playerbase from beginners to veteran players is whole another story of course. Honestly I don't really believe they're capable of delivering quality content anymore.
---
Anyway, we need more transparency to know and be able to test all implemented features/fixes one way or another, otherwise it kinda defeats a purpose of test server.
---
thx!
---
I hated the game without playing it when it got out.
---
Then decided to try it last December.
---
I was actually surprised.
---
It was not bad at all.
---
Then I saw the devs ass raping their customers. Then it was me.
---
They are not even hiding it now.
---
"Here's your ass fucking for the week."
---
All the gripes are about end game content and now base building things. If your in it for the story gameplay until end game you'll have a very good time.
---
Well, it’s Bethesda so...F NO!
---
It's a bit late in the season to grow frustrated now. Everyone else who would have left over something like this left over something like this sometime over the last 2 years. You stuck in this long, something tells me the wallpaper isn't going to keep you away for long. And I don't mean that disparagingly or anything, but this is the least of the problems since launch.
---
If On Xbox you can hold b
---
To be honest, I’ve watched his videos out of curiosity on how they found these out, and also how to protect myself in some rare cases where exploits can be used against another player.
---
Never had the inclination or need to dupe, though.
---
Where's the response at? I don't see it on their site or twitter page
---
That's not entirely true, the glitch has already been confirmed. Video.
---
On xbox just hold b &amp; it exits, if your on another system then I guess hold whichever button is the back button for a bit longer &amp; then you should exit
---
I think it might be just a visual bug. Not sure though.
---
THANK YOU!!!
---
You don’t. This is your life now
---
Yeah I've heard that they'd be trying to make servers that try to act like rust and ark? Idk but I think that would definitely be pretty sweet.
---
They are the true heros of the wasteland.
---
They just put them in
---
I never pretended to know how to manage a game studio my dude, that was you. I do understand how managing teams works though and when your product is shit you figure out quickly how to fix it or you fail. It's obvious to anyone that they're lacking in manpower in some critical positions on this project. Ideally they would fix that with the resources they already have, as any business would. If they want to save the jobs of the people already working at ZeniMax they fix this hot mess before they're run out of town altogether. Cheers, I hope the rest of your day goes better.
---
&gt; This is supposed to be an mmo. Where are the dungeons? Where are the raids? Where are the mounts? Where are the guilds? Text chat? 
---
Says whom? Show me one quote from anyone related to the development and publishing of FO76 where they said "the next great MMO"
---
"I don't think that means what you think it does" - Fezzik
---
***YOU*** want it to be an MMO? Well, newsflash, it's not an MMO or a looter shooter, or an open world adventure. This is my third post at least, advocating that people stop trying to make FO76 something it is clearly not, nor was it ever intended to be. Just enjoy it for what it is and get on with your lives, people.
---
Damn people still play this?
---
Brave
---
I feel ya I finished the so called main story not as involved and game changing as was fallout 3 n new Vegas how they made people come after to on how your treating the people of the wasteland etc, I’m trying to hang on tryin out NW it’s new and fun spin on royals mode but I’m losing faith as well
---
Yup. For future reference, anything that just has a ⚡icon simply needs to be in range of a connector or pylon. Anything with an actual power requirement (like ⚡8) needs an actual wire attached.
---
U say no content but maybe 700 hours is all the content and people need to move on to other games if this one isn’t doing it for them
---
Lol who would have guessed?
---
I laughed because that's how I was yesterday. Ran dailies and went outside to do some lawn work. Felt nice. Kids had fun too!
---
It's just all broke... idk. I just wanted to inform the community. This just sucks lol. But on a high note, I'm just glad I finished building my base!
---
adding aswell that there is some drop on the sbq after the first wave of mobs and it dropping more and more after each waves so there is no game left for us grinding events and queens
---
I'm not surprised it took a month. The codebase is likely such a nightmare, making changes extremely difficult. Not an excuse, just a sad reality of what this game is
---
Funnily enough I’ve only dealt with mean level 60s and 70s when I was a lower level
---
I’m a big fo fan and I agree. We pull other companies up so why not Bethesda. Fuck what the other fan boys think , we have to recognise facts.
---

Thanks, didn’t know that. Pretty cheap too, maybe I’ll actually get it
---
Yeah I literally just started destiny 2 with my wife and we can’t play now lol, timing is great
---
Who in their right mind donates Steel anyway..
---
Unless you have Fallout 1st and shit loads of the stuff.
---
This has to be directed at them,and encouraging more subscribers.
---
Scrap it

20 bucks on steam summer sale recently. Plus one month of 1st. 160hrs in. Level 120.
---
Yeh I'd say I got my money's worth. It's so far less than 0.50$ an hour for entertainment.
---
yeah and if you're connected the game doesn't recognize that you're F01 member if you are
---
It’s clear whatever dev team is working on these bugs fixes only know how to fix building glitches but when it comes to the actual game, it’s just monkeys bashing a wrench on their PC. 
---
INT. Check failed Bethesda. Come back when you aren’t fill with Brahmin shit
---
ps4

---
I am fully for redemption stories. But bethesda shows no signs of slowing down. They doubled down on fallout 1st, they double down on stupid decissions that could've easily been avoided if they listend.
---
If creation engine wasn't bugs on top of bugs on top of bugs this wouldn't be an issue.
---
I have all of the available Fallout games that aren't in obscurity.  
---
I have tried 1 and 2. While I did grow up with Diablo and similar games they most are far too dated for my time.
---
Relax. This isnt anything new at all. All your post did was link the recent reasons that Bethesda gave us on their forums for why they made the camp changes to the actual glitch. Three groups to blame: duper’s for doing it, demon for disseminating it widely, and Bethesda for taking 6 freaking months to come up with lame method of preventing it.
---
I'm most likely getting downvoted but it's worth it for the few that read it
---
I love this game so much but if certain things don't change especially the way to rank up the second legendary run I might finally turn my back.
---
I've never been good with grammar in any language
---
A glitch to have double sided/wallpapered walls won't work anymore and the Atlas event has insultingly bad, rehashed rewards from the holiday gifts. But seriously, when is this sub not angry? Most of the people enjoying the game are too busy playing to be posting here.
---
Hope you weren’t planning on putting double sided walls in your camp anytime soon
---
Deleted their whole account.  That's not suspicious.....
---
I’ve gotten two, both were within a month of each other. They’re pretty lax about it unless you try to abuse it
---
Then is for listing things chronologically, than is for comparing things
---
Yall think yall got it bad. I just decided it was a good idea to put my base at the raider outpost along the road near monongah mine.
---
I think it’s because EA doesn’t own Star Wars, Disney does, and Disney forced EA to correct their game because they were tarnishing the brand. Bethesda owns fallout and they will drag it through the mud as much as they want as long as they are making a profit, they have no accountability like EA has with Star Wars.
---
Maybe the CMs can shine a light on some of these issues and why they are still current.
---
 u/Ladydevann   u/Valseek
---
EA has some businesses practices that some don't like but they can make competent games. Anthem even with all the issues it had was a fully competent game that pushed boundaries. It's devoid of content too but I can't remember the devs just straight up lying about what updates contain
---
so you need to build another stair somewhere to replace the stairs now? That's fucked up because there are certainly scenarios where people cannot do that. So the only way for them would be to move camp.

Ultracite Gatling Lasers seem so few and far between that I had to craft them to scrap and learn the mods, otherwise I was stuck at 3/15 mods known after almost 2 years of playing.
---
I'm happy to see things happen in the game. The devs are under stress and a lot of work. It's the execs that make dumb decisions and force devs to focus on Atom Shop vs bug fixes. People need to just relax.
---
You make the best point I’ve heard in a long time
---
I'm on PS4 and I shut down the game today to get out.  Then deleted it from my camp when I relogged.  It's hard to believe that they made it worse when they tried to fix it.
---
Wait what ? What did they do ?
---
Press and hold “0” to quickly exit
---
What he said up top
---
Thought they were suppposed to fill the auto complete bug?
---
4 of my weekly challenges were completed, which means 4k down the drain. One of them was "Complete a Daily Star Challenge". The funny thing is that daily challenge is not even done yet!
---
So you’re saying they have removed the only good bug in the game ?
---
I do this every time. That is why my plastic is too precious to give to those metal diaper wearing babies in the Brotherhood of Steel.
---
I nuke it each and every server I get on
---
This collection method (hit drink then mash collect) works with any controlled water outlet.
---
Have you ever tried to drop a pa set with strangler armor on it recently? I haven’t, but I’m pretty sure bethesda patched it a while back so that it’ll destroy the items if you tried. So I’m not entirely sure you are correct in your assessment. But again, I’ve never owned a set to test it so I’m not saying you are wrong. I’m just wondering if you considered questioning it.
---
That is a fair point. But I hope these companies realise that if they make good games instead of bad ones that they can make so much more money. But I suppose they make more then enough as is so they don't give 2 shits. It's quintity over quility these days
---
Make more bosses. Give better rewards for said bosses. Seriously Bethesda.
---
Ight that’s it im cancelling first im sick of this shitty company ruining there game even more
---
10 minutes might be a slight exaggeration but that’s how long it feels from the point of leaving a match, sitting in the main menu whilst it tried to find a new match, then waiting in the lobby for it to begin
---
that item is for workshops ONLY. not for camps
---
This is 100% the way to do it if you don't want to spend caps on plans. Pick a level 3 safe and if you don't get a plan you want make sure not to loot anything. Just log out and try again, the items will be different.
---
Yep currently having this same issue.
---
Same, Though I’m quitting f76 if the game doesn’t get upgraded to Xbox series x
---
Serendipity will be your friend. If you're going rifleman go sneak. Doesn't matter how low your health is if nothing ever shoots at you lol
---
If you enjoy the franchise, you should enjoy 76. Once your end game is 100% legendary hunting, and camp building you start to notice the flaws more. But I had tons of fun the first run through. Inventory management/cap limits/scrip limits were my main issues on my first run through. If you are a digital hoarder like me, fo76 can be frustrating. I know I don't need 250 stimpacks and 1500 steel but dammit, it goes against every fiber of my being to just throw them away (since I already maxed my 1400 cap limit). So, learning what you need on a daily basis and what is easily replaced is helpful.
---
New patch. New wendigo event delayed, which is actually getting the least amount of heat out of everything if you believe that. New BOS event launched, really mediocre rewards are turning people off. Bug fix in building which messed up the work around people used to make interior walls, so builders are furious. No SS mods, even though the patch notes say they where in this patch. Several things referred to as exploits, such as crafting and scrapping assaultron helmets for screws, where changed. Similar thing with bows, which enraged the last two people who use bows. I'm sure I missed several other things, but those seem to be the high lights.
---
While I don't mind fo76 the way it is (I have admittedly not paid much attention and rejoined during Faschnact), I don't think a complete reset would be terrible.  However, being one of those players who was on the original FFXIV at the launch for maybe a week before I gave up and provided my negative feedback.  That reset happened relatively quickly, which is why I don't hold much hope for them doing this with fo76.
---
No, Ward's daily auto completing still works just fine.
---
Yep, if you have a "legacy camp" I would highly advise not moving/editing until all "fixes" are know to the community so you can avoid loosing it all like me. :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
---
I hope so. The seasonal events are my favorite part about this game, and I hope the Halloween one comes back even though it’s not on the roadmap
---
I'm level 76 on the season.  Going to log in exclusively to do the dailies and finish out the season, I feel I've worked too hard at it.  Then I'm calling it quits
---
My first time back to do that event, right as I started talking to the guy, hear a nuke and this man equips a hazmat suit.
---
I think it’s back now, just logged back in
---
Chameleon bugs date back to then, off the top of my head.
---
This better be a joke or I’m gonna lose my mind they nerf the bow that no one uses they delay the thing I actually wanted to do and atlas is shite ! What a world !
---
It works anywhere
---
You're the one who suggested "reducing manpower on the "cosmetic" teams" to fix the game man, not me.
---
I actually agree that F76 needs some serious work and would benefit greatly from additional resources, but cutting back the artists isn't what's going to fix it. 
---
Pretty sure everyone at Bethesda's Austin studios would get fired before the higher-ups at ZeniMax got the briefest touch, though.
---
Good info to have, but I honestly get the scrap challenges done through normal game play.  This seems like great info for those that have very little time to play.
---
Yep. During any other challenge it's like fighting in a zoo. The creatures are obviously smart and kniw they're being hunted.
---
I don't know what they're paying Valseek, but it ain't enough. Buddy is relentlessly professional.
---
Yeah... While I appreciate the 10x/100x trade option, the fact that it no longer hides my invalid options has made it differently frustrating. Also needed is a simple exit option, not spam back until I undo every trade to exit the terminal.
---
Oh, and they changed the ammo converter UI and supposedly made it worse. I haven't tried it, so no opinion on that one.
---
Only 3 more months to Cyberpunk 2077.
---
You donated 10k steel? I'm sorry
---
And honestly, I'm both skeptical they'll keep their word and skeptical how good the game will be if they do. 
---
As annoying as microtransations are they usually encourage continued support. I guess it's just been too long since something has come out with decent customisation/fashion in the base game, i don't trust 'em.
---
This post is me in a nutshell and ONE OR TWO EVENTS AINT GONNA CUT IT BETHESDA
---
Lol. There is literally a 6 month old video of this method on youtube. 
---
Additionally Bethesda posted that they made the change because people were using the build system to cause server instability: https://bethesda.net/community/topic/422354/recent-c-a-m-p-fixes-in-update-21?language%5B%5D=en
---
Here is a reddit post from January talking about people selling and trading the armor through an exploit: https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/en3cnw/people_buying_and_selling_entire_sets_of/
---
People still play this game?
---
Lol yeah, I agreed with everything up until then.
---
That’s all i was doing because all i wanted was the fireplace door.
---
Fuck the fireplace door. What am i gonna build it in? The vanilla boring ass house that Bethesda wants us all to build?
---
If you do it shortly after doing it already then it doesn’t work
---
Yea same for me sorta, mine worked good for one day so basically they just fixed the glitch on yours that made it run good. Its not a bug.. its a feature.
---
I used to be running low on plastic. If you use the scrapper perk card and scrap all the laser rifles you get from the muties at West-Tek, you’ll get roughly 10-12 plastic per gun.
---
I HAVE to do this now lol
---
This update is the "gift" that keeps on giving hey?
---
The whole stairs thing was a big enough pain in the arse before. It beggars belief really since so much of the atom shop purchases would be for CAMP related items that they would so spectacularly fuck up shit for that player base
---
You are a VAT VUCK!
---
This article is 6 months old &amp; doesn't even mention the heart of your complaint, about the patch being driven, almost solely, because of Youtubers.
---
Sweet!
---
So, a faction has to be asked to show up for it to have any right to existence? Makes sense, it's not like the civilians of the Commonwealth lie in constant fear of the threats that the Brotherhood takes out. But you're right, the Enclave, Institute, Master's Army, NCR, and Vault 87 Super Mutants were completely in the right.
---
Actually, Underworld isnt their home, they're squatting, they have no more ownership to that building than any other person in the Wasteland, they didnt create it. And, I know this may be hard to fathom, but if the Brotherhood had meant to harm those ghouls, theyd be dead. And despite all your heresay, theres not a single example of the BoS, EVER, killing sentient ghouls, so please, replay/reread whatever you need to to confirm this statement.
---
The only reason that the Brotherhood had stepped up its tech hoarding in the West was directly tied to an increase in the NCR's expansion and their growing military force, all of it was reliant on the other to have happened. By not including their rationale in their decision making, and dumbing it down to ignorant statements like "we just know better", make your arguments invalid, logically and factually.
---
Edit: They're very clearly aware of what the opposing faction is doing before declaring war on them, did you actually play through their storyline or did you just immediately label them fascists and try to kill them? Because it's becoming pretty clear that either your memory is shoddy, you never paid attention, or you never actually bothered learning their side of things.
---
Thats a 6 month old article?
---
Honest answer just passing through. I'd say just focus on building your character, you have the potential to become an unstoppable god like monster in this game if you plan your build well. But you have to start at the beginning. Most people stick to one weapon type focused builds to maximise damage so maybe start by figuring out what weapon you prefer, this also applies to playstyle, do you go in guns blasing with a mini gun or do you stealth kill them with a silenced rifle? I am currently on a bloodied stealth gunslinger build (bloodied and junkie builds deal the most damage). 
---
You can also run a charisma build that focuses on playing in groups mainly, but it is also useful for the wastelanders questlines. 
---
Basically, start building your character, leveling up, and trying out weapons.
---
(From someone who made a very similar post on this sub not too long ago, followed commenter's advice, and is now capable of dealing 1700 damage with their gauss pistol. Thanks again guys)
---
Edit: Also, read up on perk cards. They took me a while to get the hang of.
---
I only use the one mod that makes it superior damage resistant and the jet pack for chest and deep pocketed for chest. Use jet pack at first on first chest piece I rolled but didn’t enjoy it. And I was more worried about carrying more and wanted to use my unyielding chest and arms I rolled after two rolls each. So I bought deep pocketed but I switch my whole build around after purveyor gave me a bloodied fixer. So might switch it back to having jet pack being my agility is now 12 I believe. So it should be way better this time around. But yeah I saved my gold forever after getting all guns and some of the mods. The armor, under armor after they added the ability to mod it and jet pack. So I kept waiting and waiting but nothing new so I said screw it i bought all t65 and couple mods. Only had everything but helmet for a weeks then finally got it all. Don’t need to buy jet pack for it being there is a glitch you can have one without knowing the plan for some reason. So now all my gold will just sit there forever.
---
Probably not.
---
So whatever performance gains you managed to gain from taking away our building freedom is why the game is buggier and slower POST-patch?
---
Corporate bullshit and a very weak excuse.
---
Doubt it
---
I hate this club &gt;:( ha ha
---
As much as every single one of us wants that, i think the chances are pretty slim to fuck all.
---
At this point most of us are tired if these posts.
---
Imagine a Car Company putting out a shitty car, then a bunch of people figure out how to fix it up and make it awesome, and then getting angry at those people instead of the Car Company for the car being shit.
---
Don't try to cover for the developers, 100% of the problems from this game originate from them.
---
Are Henrietta and Slick able to wander? Or they’re in the coop permanently? The Brahmin roam, and as I have a rooftop garden I had visions of chooks gliding down from the roof to land on unsuspecting visitors.
---
With the way Bethesda is, I sadly have to agree
---
X D
---
Yeah, but the video is confirmed to have been a working glitch. Unfortunately, this is the only reason we currently have for why Bethesda has chosen to cripple the building system. Only time will tell. To be honest we still dont k ow if this was an intentional "fix" or an accident. Regarding Bethesda, no one really knows up from down.
---
When you pick up an item. You can server hop all you want. That item will not spawn until you pick up 180 other items around the world. Pick up all the junk you can and after 180 you can farm your lead again.
---
Of course no one else, you killed everyone except the Brotherhood
---
I noticed that moving away to around the 2 ranges of a weapon and back resolved the FPS drop for me
---
If it brings any consolation, I hear that they do want to fix the building issues soon enough. Hopefully a hotfix before the next update
---
I love scrapper perk despite my initial disappointment that it didn't get top tier junk like screws I was originally expecting. Luckily those piles of plastic and steel it does provide helps fuel my never ending secret service armor crafting chase.
---
Ah yes cause without steel you definitely can craft weapons, armor and ammo. Definitely not good.
---
You can spend 700 hours doing the same thing, which unfortunately you have to do if you want the best gear. Of course that is a choice, but in most games the endgame goal is to get the best stuff. The problem is that so much in this game is subject to RNG, and the only way to consistently get a *remote* chance of getting the best stuff is doing the same exact things over and over and over again
---
Moving around 2 weapon ranges away seem to fix the fps drop even if loot piles are still there.

Go on trading markets for fallout. You clearly have no idea what you’re talking about.
---
Sounds like you have a problem, yes.
---
I didnt do anything special to get the blueprint. So you are incorrect to call it a cheat.
---
That we can place as many as we want is really the only part that doesn't seem right.
---
I have the food machine on blueprint but it always says item is floating and I cant place it.
---
I could get the fusion core generator but the game gets stuck in a thinking process but it wants to work.
---
The FACT is we can target these machines in build mode and they do interact with blueprints.... would suggest that this is just another broken feature of the game.
---
If you continue to play this game, you are the reason this keeps happening.
---
You also lose in every game you are in.
---
Have you tried using 50cal or a minigun? Even though the first one is quite ammo-effective, it ain't no sniper rifle when it comes to ammo consumption. It needs (much) more bullets than what you can reliably find in the world if you use it as a main gun tbh. Even if it is bloodied.
---
Plans you can find for a few caps in vendors.
---
PC seems to be working fine so far.
